5	Incidence and properties of renal masses and asymptomatic renal cell carcinoma detected by abdominal ultrasonography. Renal ultrasonography was performed in 45,905 adults, including 41,364 without any signs suggesting urinary tract malignancies, 1,667 with microscopic hematuria only and 2,874 with some signs of malignancy. Renal lesions were found in 355 adults (0.858%) in the asymptomatic, 39 (2.3%) in the microscopic hematuria and 75 (2.6%) in the symptomatic groups, respectively. Renal cell carcinoma was found in 35 (7.5%) lesions: 19 (5.4%) in the asymptomatic, none in the microscopic hematuria and 16 (21.3%) in the symptomatic groups. A total of 47 patients, including 12 other renal cell carcinoma patients transferred from related hospitals, was grouped into 28 without and 19 with symptoms. Primary tumor size and clinical stages were significantly smaller and lower, respectively, in the asymptomatic group than in the symptomatic group. Radical nephrectomy was performed in all but 2 asymptomatic patients. The 5-year survival rates after nephrectomy were 94.7 and 60.9% for the asymptomatic and symptomatic groups, respectively (p less than 0.01). The results indicate that ultrasonography is a useful tool to detect low stage asymptomatic renal cell carcinoma at low cost. 
1	Squamous carcinoma of the distal esophagus: a survival study. A survival study for squamous carcinomas of the distal esophagus treated by the Southern California Permanente Medical Group in the interval of 1954 to 1988 was undertaken. We found radiation therapy and surgery equally efficacious in terms of cure for patients without distant disease and performance status sufficient to tolerate treatment. We did not find survival benefit for patients treated with palliative surgery, and plan less invasive endoscopic means along with chemotherapy and radiation for palliation, reserving surgery for special circumstances. 
1	Primary hepatic carcinoid tumor. An electron microscopic and immunohistochemical study. A case of primary carcinoid tumor of the liver with striking morphologic and electron microscopic features is reported. Conventional histologic examination showed a prominent paranuclear clear zone in numerous tumor cells. By electron microscopic examination, this clear zone corresponded to a paranuclear mass of intermediate filaments admixed with neurosecretory granules and other cytoplasmic organelles. 
4	The failure of serial pneumatic cuff venous occlusion plethysmography to predict patients at risk for pulmonary emboli after trauma. Over a three month period, attempts to perform serial Pneumatic Cuff Venous Occlusion Plethysmography (VP) were carried out in 51 severely injured patients felt to be at risk for Pulmonary Embolus (PE). Studies could not be performed in 25 of these patients due to the nature of their injuries. Of the remaining 26 patients, two showed evidence of deep vein thrombosis (DVT). Venography confirmed the diagnosis in only one of these patients. Serial VP failed to predict PE in all five patients in whom it was diagnosed. This article concludes that serial VP is not an effective predictor of PE in these patients. 
3	Is it correct to correct? Developmental milestones in 555 "normal" preterm infants compared with term infants. To determine whether correction for preterm birth should be applied during developmental assessment, we conducted a prospective national survey of very premature infants (born at less than 32 weeks of gestation); neurodevelopment in the first 2 years was studied with the Dutch child health care developmental assessment. In 555 preterm children who had no evidence of handicap at 2 years of age, the age at which developmental milestones were reached was established. The results were compared with the results of the same assessment in Dutch children born at term. During the first year, the development of the very premature children equaled the development of normal children when full correction was applied. At 2 years of age, development was equal to or better than normal children's development without correction. We conclude that full correction for prematurity should be applied in the first year to avoid overreferral for developmental stimulation, whereas at 2 years of age correction is not necessary. 
4	Assessment of right ventricular oxidative metabolism by positron emission tomography with C-11 acetate in aortic valve disease. Evaluation of right ventricular (RV) oxidative metabolism is limited by the inability to easily determine oxygen extraction by the RV myocardium and the complex morphology of this ventricle. Because left ventricular C-11 clearance rate constants closely correlate with myocardial oxygen consumption, it was postulated that C-11 clearance rate constants for the RV free wall should also reflect its oxygen consumption. Therefore, RV C-11 clearance rate constants were compared with RV loading in 21 patients with aortic valve disease to assess the possible use of this technique for noninvasive evaluation of RV oxidative metabolism. RV free wall C-11 clearance rate constants correlated with the product of systolic pulmonary artery pressure and heart rate for all patients (r = 0.65, p = 0.002), but the relation was stronger if 2 patients with overt RV dysfunction were excluded (r = 0.83, p = 0.001). On the basis of mean pulmonary artery pressures, patients were stratified into subgroups with normal (group I, n = 8) and elevated (group II, n = 13) pulmonary pressures and were compared with 10 normal control subjects. RV C-11 clearance rate constants were significantly higher in group II than in group I and in normal control subjects (p less than 0.05). These data suggest that RV C-11 acetate clearance rate constants can provide noninvasive evaluation of RV oxidative metabolism. This technique may allow serial assessment of RV performance in various cardiac and pulmonary diseases, and particularly of changes associated with therapeutic interventions. 
1	Epstein-Barr virus transformation of B lymphocytes from IgA nephropathy patients and first-degree relatives results in increased immunoglobulin synthesis not restricted to IgA. In order to study B-cell activation patterns independent of T-cell regulation in patients with IgA nephropathy (IgAN), peripheral blood mononuclear cells from 67 patients with IgAN, 15 first-degree relatives of patients with familial disease, and 13 normal controls were transformed with Epstein-Barr virus (EBV). Culture supernatants of these transformed cells were assayed for levels of IgG, IgA, and IgM, and results obtained on the three populations were compared. EBV-transformed cells of IgAN patients, as well as the population of first-degree relatives, secreted significantly elevated levels of all three isotypes as compared with the normal controls. However, in comparing ratios of secreted isotypes, it was determined that more IgA relative to IgG and IgM was synthesized by cells of these two populations as compared with the normal controls. Our results imply that (1) the population of B cells susceptible to EBV activation is increased in IgAN patients; (2) this population of "activatable" B lymphocytes is polyclonal and not restricted to the IgA class; and (3) even though there may be a primary B-cell abnormality in IgAN, an additional defect(s) is probably operative in the pathogenesis, since cells of clinically unaffected relatives behaved in a pattern similar to that of patients. 
5	New horizons in management of hypothermia and frostbite injury. Diagnosing hypothermia requires a high index of suspicion. Restoring lost heat with careful attention to hemodynamics usually results in complete recovery. Frostbite is best treated by physicians who are cognizant of the pathophysiology of cold injury. Although alternative methods of intervention are being tested, rapid rewarming and anti-inflammatory agents are integral to treatment protocols. 
1	A phase I clinical trial of 2-chlorodeoxyadenosine in pediatric patients with acute leukemia. To evaluate its toxicity and clinical efficacy in children with relapsed or refractory leukemia, we performed a phase I trial of 2-chloro-2'-deoxy-adenosine (2-chlorodeoxyadenosine; 2-CDA) given as a continuous 5-day infusion at doses of 3 to 10.7 mg/m2/d. In this study of 31 children with acute leukemia, the only dose-limiting toxicity was myelosuppression. At the highest dose level, three of seven patients developed fatal systemic bacterial or fungal infections. At dose levels above 6.2 mg/m2/d, significant oncolytic responses occurred in all patients. In addition, there was a significant correlation between both the responsiveness by cell type and dose of 2-CDA, such that more oncolytic responses were noted in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) patients than acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) patients (P = .02). Although this was a phase I trial in heavily pretreated patients with refractory disease, two AML patients treated at 5.2 and 10.7 mg/m2/d, respectively, had complete hematologic responses, and one patient treated at 10.7 mg/m2/d had a partial response. In addition, there was a dose-response relationship in all patients with improved cytoreduction of peripheral blast cells at higher doses of 2-CDA. In vitro evaluation of 2-CDA uptake and anabolism by leukemic blast cells from 22 patients demonstrated that 2-chloro-2'-deoxyadenosine (Cld-AMP) and 2-chloro-2'-deoxyadenosine 5'-striphosphate (CldATP) reached concentrations close to steady-state levels within 1 hour. Intracellular nucleotide disappearance rates were high with half-lives of 1.29 and 2.47 hours for CldAMP and CldATP, respectively. This suggests that continuous infusion is necessary to maintain the desired plasma concentration. The results of this study confirm the antileukemic activity of 2-CDA and the lack of prohibitive nonhematologic toxicity. Phase II trials in patients with AML and ALL are warranted. 
4	Sinus node-atrioventricular node isolation: long-term results with the "corridor" operation for atrial fibrillation The "corridor" operation is designed to restore sinus rhythm to patients with atrial fibrillation by electrically isolating the sinus node, a band of atrial tissue and the atrioventricular (AV) node from the remaining atrial tissue. Nine patients with drug-refractory atrial fibrillation underwent this operation; four patients had chronic atrial fibrillation and five had paroxysmal atrial fibrillation; the mean duration of symptoms was 12 +/- 8 years. Patient ages ranged from 25 to 68 years (mean 48 +/- 12). At preoperative electrophysiologic study, no patient had evidence of an accessory AV pathway or AV node reentry. Sinus node recovery time could not be determined in five patients because of recurrent atrial fibrillation during or before programmed stimulation. At operation the corridor of atrial tissue connecting the sinus and AV nodes was successfully isolated from the remaining left and right atrial tissue in all patients. One patient required early reoperation for recurrent atrial fibrillation before hospital discharge. At the predischarge electrophysiologic study, the corridor remained isolated in all patients except for one patient who had intermittent conduction between the corridor and excluded right atrium. One patient had nonsustained atrial fibrillation and one had atrial tachycardia evident in the corridor. Atypical AV node reentry of uncertain significance was induced in one other patient. Over a total follow-up of 191 patient months (mean 21 +/- 20), seven patients remained free of atrial fibrillation. Two patients had recurrent atrial fibrillation, which in one patient was effectively controlled by a single antiarrhythmic agent. A permanent pacemaker was implanted in four patients for sinus node dysfunction. 
5	Environmental risk factors in siblings with Parkinson's disease. To investigate possible risk factors in Parkinson's disease, we conducted a case-controlled study of 19 families having two or more siblings with Parkinson's disease. Demographic data were collected, including lifetime histories of places of residence; sources of drinking water; occupations, such as farming; and exposure to herbicides and pesticides. Rural living and drinking well water, but not farming and herbicide exposure, were significantly increased in 38 parkinsonians compared with 38 normal control subjects. A comparison of parkinsonian siblings with siblings with essential tremor revealed no differences in any risk factors for the years of shared environment. These data suggest that living in a rural environment and drinking well water are risk factors for Parkinson's disease and that the total life exposure to an environmental toxin may be more important than exposure in early life. 
4	Lipids, vascular disease, and dementia with advancing age. Epidemiologic considerations. Elevated plasma lipid and lipoprotein levels are associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular disease in middle-aged men and women. It is still not clear, however, whether lipid and lipoprotein abnormalities continue to be risk factors for cardiovascular disease in the elderly population. It is not even clear what normal lipid values are in the elderly, and whether diet or drug therapy should be advised on the basis of lipid values established in middle-aged populations. Ischemic heart disease does remain the leading cause of death in the elderly, and there is now preliminary evidence from epidemiologic studies that relative elevations of levels of lipid and lipoprotein fractions in an elderly population might be associated with an independent and increased risk of coronary heart disease, stroke, and possibly dementia. Intervention studies are about to begin that will assess various lipid-and lipoprotein-modifying therapies and their ability to reduce vascular disease risk in the elderly. 
2	Preventive therapy of first gastrointestinal bleeding in patients with cirrhosis: results of a controlled trial comparing propranolol, endoscopic sclerotherapy and placebo. Propranolol and endoscopic sclerosis of esophageal varices are the two approaches currently used in prophylaxis of the first gastrointestinal hemorrhage in the cirrhotic patient. One hundred twenty-six cirrhotic patients with esophageal varices and no histories of bleeding were included in the trial regardless of the gravity of the cirrhosis or the size of the esophageal varices. Patients with hepatocarcinomas or other cancers, clearly impossible follow-up, previous treatment for portal hypertension or contraindication to beta-blockers were excluded. After randomization, 43 patients received propranolol twice daily at a dose reducing the heart rate by 25%; 42 patients were treated with intravariceal and extravariceal injections of Polidocanol; 41 control patients received vitamin K orally as placebo. The patients were seen at 3-mo intervals for 2 yr. On entry to the trial the three groups were comparable in terms of clinical and biological parameters, including size of esophageal varices (grade I = 51, grade II = 54, grade III = 17), Child-Pugh classification (A = 29, B = 61, C = 32) and the origin of cirrhosis (alcoholic in 79% of cases). Twenty-four patients bled (two bled in the propranolol group, nine bled in the endoscopic sclerosis of esophageal varices group and 13 bled in the placebo group). Actuarial estimates (Kaplan-Meier) of the time of onset of first bleeding showed that the differences were significant between propranolol and placebo (p less than 0.004) and between propranolol and sclerotherapy (p less than 0.03) but not between sclerotherapy and placebo. 
1	Skin exudate levels of interleukin 6, interleukin 1 and other cytokines in mycosis fungoides. The role of locally released cytokines in inducing lymphocyte activation and infiltration in the skin lesions of mycosis fungoides has been investigated. The levels of selected cytokines were measured in chamber fluid samples from lesional and control skin. Biologically active interleukin 6 was significantly elevated in lesional samples and a recombinant form of this cytokine was shown to induce lymphocyte migration in an in vitro assay. Biologically active interleukin 1 was detected in all control chamber fluid samples. Significantly reduced levels of this cytokine were present in lesional samples, which may be the result of the release of preformed material. Interleukin 2 and tumour necrosis factor activity, and gamma interferon and granulocyte macrophage colony-stimulating factor immunoreactivity, were not detectable in any of the samples. Interleukins 1 and 6 may play a role in the pathogenesis of the lesional lymphocyte infiltrates in mycosis fungoides. 
2	Serum gastrin and blood glucose levels during halothane-nitrous oxide anaesthesia and strabismus surgery in children. The purpose of this study was to determine whether serum gastrin levels are increased by reflexogenic stimuli applied to the extrinsic muscles of the eye. Serum gastrin and blood glucose concentrations were measured in ten normal children aged between 5 and 12 yr during general anaesthesia with halothane and nitrous oxide and during strabismus surgery. Fasting basal concentrations of gastrin (33.6 +/- 14.8 pg.ml-1) and of glucose (4.43 +/- 0.72 mmol.L-1) were in the normal range of values for children. Intravenous atropine (0.01 mg.kg-1), general anaesthesia with halothane in nitrous oxide and oxygen by mask for three minutes, tracheal intubation, extraocular muscle stimulation and surgical stress did not cause any variation in the mean serum gastrin concentration. On the contrary, tracheal intubation and surgical stress increased blood glucose concentrations (P less than 0.05). There was no difference in the serum gastrin levels after extraocular muscle stimulation between children with positive or negative oculocardiac reflexes (44.5 +/- 16.7 pg.ml-1 vs 38 +/- 14.7 pg.ml-1, respectively). The incidence of vomiting predischarge was 60 per cent. Serum gastrin levels did not differ between children who vomited and children who did not (44.3 +/- 18.5 pg.ml-1 vs 47.1 +/- 16.9 pg.ml-1, respectively). Vomiting after strabismus surgery cannot be attributed to high gastrin serum levels. Consequently, it is unlikely that vomiting after strabismus surgery is linked to an "oculogastric reflex" with the vagus nerve as the efferent pathway. 
3	Serial neurobehavioral assessments in preterm infants. The purpose of this study was to compare serial neurobehavioral assessments in a sample of preterm infants with intraventricular hemorrhage (IVH) to those of a group of unaffected preterm infants. Of the 30 infants included in the study, 5 infants had a grade III or IV/VI intraventricular hemorrhage. Infants with IVH demonstrated more abnormalities in mental status and a cluster of abnormal neurologic findings (persistent ankle clonus, tremulousness, and brisk deep tendon reflexes). Of the 30 infants, 20 infants were included in a brain metabolism study. Infants who had experienced an IVH had significantly different brain metabolism findings, as measured by nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (NMR). There was a significant correlation between one measure of brain metabolism (PCr/PI) and the neurobehavioral assessment rating for infants with IVH. 
4	Coronary sinus occlusion: effect on ischemic left ventricular dysfunction and reactive hyperemia. Pressure-controlled intermittent coronary sinus occlusion (PICSO) has been shown to reduce experimental infarct size. To examine the role of PICSO in limiting the consequences of brief ischemia on left ventricular function, we studied the effect of PICSO in nine open-chest anesthetized dogs. PICSO was performed using a pump-inflated, balloon-tipped catheter in the coronary sinus until coronary sinus occlusion pressure reached a plateau (10 +/- 3 seconds). The balloon was then rapidly deflated (2 seconds) and the cycle was repeated. Regional left ventricular function in the ischemic zone was assessed by sonomicrometry. Coronary blood flow was measured with a flow probe around the left anterior descending artery (LAD) proximal to an occluding suture. Measurements were obtained at baseline, during a 3-minute LAD occlusion, and for 10 minutes of reperfusion. In an additional five dogs, this sequence was repeated during an infusion of adenosine at a dose that abolished reactive hyperemia following LAD occlusion. The addition of PICSO beginning 15 minutes prior to ischemia and continuing throughout LAD occlusion and reperfusion did not prevent, reduce, or shorten ischemic left ventricular dysfunction. PICSO uniformly blunted reactive hyperemia during reperfusion. However, PICSO also reduced coronary blood flow during maximal vasodilatation achieved by adenosine infusion prior to LAD occlusion. Therefore, it is likely that PICSO decreases reactive hyperemia due to mechanical factors arising from venous engorgement rather than by reducing the ischemic stimulus causing vasodilation. 
4	Prognostic determinants in extracorporeal membrane oxygenation for respiratory failure in newborns. Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) is becoming an accepted therapeutic modality for newborn respiratory failure, but there is little information available regarding the prognostic determinants with this technique. One hundred thirty-five newborns treated with ECMO over a 4-year period were critically analyzed with regard to the influence that birth weight, gestational age, age at initiation of ECMO, best blood gases before ECMO, number of hours on ECMO, renal failure, intracerebral hemorrhage, and long-distance air transport had on survival. Infants with meconium aspiration and those undergoing long-distance transfer showed significant differences in blood gases before ECMO, with survivors having more normal pH and carbon dioxide tension values. Intracerebral hemorrhage and renal failure that developed during ECMO were grave prognostic signs, with few survivors in either group. These data show that ability to ventilate patients before ECMO, giving normal carbon dioxide tension and pH values, is an important prognostic sign in infants with meconium aspiration and undergoing long-distance transfer for ECMO, whereas renal failure and intracerebral hemorrhage are usually lethal complications of ECMO. Each center performing ECMO should continually reevaluate this invasive technique and its results and complications. 
4	Insulin as a mitogenic factor: role in the pathogenesis of cardiovascular disease. Evidence has been accumulating that insulin has actions that may promote the development of atherosclerosis. Research has involved three broad areas: actions of insulin on cultured arterial cells, the effect of insulin on isolated artery preparations, and the development of lipid-containing lesions in the arteries of experimental animals. Insulin, in concentrations similar to those found in physiologic conditions, stimulates proliferation of cultured arterial smooth muscle cells from a number of species, including humans. Insulin also stimulates migration of smooth muscle cells. Cholesterol synthesis and low-density lipoprotein interaction with its receptor in smooth muscle cells are stimulated by insulin. Insulin's mitogenic action appears to be mediated by the insulin-like growth factor receptor. Endothelial cells cultured from large vessels are resistant to the actions of insulin, but hyperglycemia inhibits their proliferation. Insulin deficiency protects animals from experimental atherosclerosis; this protection is lost with insulin treatment. Insulin administration results in lipid-containing lesions in chickens and rats fed a normal diet, and in increased lipid synthesis in the arteries of pigs and dogs. Isolated artery preparations from insulin-deficient or insulin-treated animals undergo lipid metabolism at a rate that correlates with the insulin concentrations in the donor animals. The biological actions of insulin (and glucose) on arterial tissue suggest that hyperglycemia and hyperinsulinemia may promote the development of atherosclerosis. 
2	Congenital tracheoesophageal fistula associated with carcinoma of the lung in an adult. A rare case of adult congenital H-type tracheoesophageal fistula was diagnosed. Subsequently, at operation, large cell, undifferentiated carcinoma of the right middle lobe with extension to the right lobe and adherence to the diaphragm was documented. The diagnosis, surgical intervention, and 4-year follow-up are presented. 
5	Posterior nuchal cystic hygroma [published erratum appears in Clin Perinatol 1990 Dec;17(4):viii] When cystic hygroma is detected antenatally, the prognosis is usually poor, and intrauterine or neonatal death are common. This seems especially true for Turner syndrome (the largest etiologic group associated with cystic hygroma) and the lethal multiple pterygium syndromes. However, some fetuses with Turner syndrome, and also with certain other diagnoses, had a good outcome, and further study of these conditions is required before more definite prognostic indicators and risk figures will be available. Increasing numbers of syndromes are being reported in association with fetal cystic hygroma, and lymphedema may be a common element in their pathogenesis. Mild, short-lived, or otherwise uncomplicated jugular lymphatic obstruction may be a cause of the neck webbing seen in the Noonan, familial pterygium colli, and distichiasis-lymphedema syndromes. With earlier and more widespread fetal ultrasonography, and more sensitive techniques, a greater number of resolving fetal cases may be reported. This may clarify the natural history and provide prospective criteria for the conditions that have better prognoses. The associated conditions include autosomal dominant and recessive genetic traits. Careful ultrasound study for other malformations, polyhydramnios and fetal growth parameters, a fetal karyotype, and, if appropriate, pathologic examination are required to determine the etiology and recurrence risk. The parents should be asked about exposure to alcohol or other agents and should be examined for signs of pterygium colli or Noonan syndrome. If the decision is made to continue the pregnancy, and there is doubt about the natural history and prognosis, multi-disciplinary supervision should include social services, neonatology, pediatric surgery, cardiology, and genetics specialties when indicated. 
5	Transient renal acidification defect during acute infantile diarrhea: the role of urinary sodium. We studied urinary acidification daily during the hospital course of 16 infants with acute gastroenteritis and metabolic acidosis. Urine pH value on admission was higher than 5.5 in 14 (87%) patients. We hypothesized that inappropriate urinary acidification was due to sodium deficiency and inadequate sodium delivery to the distal nephron. Forty-one urinary samples were collected during metabolic acidosis. The mean pH of 24 urine samples with sodium concentration less than 10 mmol/L was significantly higher than the pH of 17 samples with sodium concentration greater than 10 mmol/L (6.04 +/- 0.06 vs 5.19 +/- 0.1; p less than 0.001). The urine ratios of titratable acid to creatinine and of total acidity to creatinine were significantly higher in urine samples containing more sodium (p less than 0.02), whereas the ammonium/creatinine ratio was not. After administration of furosemide or correction of the sodium deficit, appropriate acidification was observed. We conclude that impaired urinary acidification is frequently found during metabolic acidosis in infants with acute gastroenteritis and results from a sodium deficit rather than from transient distal renal tubular acidosis. 
3	Abnormal single motor unit behavior in the upper motor neuron syndrome. We studied the discharge pattern of single motor units (SMUs) in the left and right biceps muscles from a patient with nonspastic weakness of the left arm. Detailed statistical analysis of the behavior of discharge patterns of 4 of 4 single motor units on the affected side showed abnormalities with characteristic features of an upper motor neuron lesion. Five out of 5 single motor units recorded from the right biceps were normal. An upper motor neuron lesion affecting the left arm, predicted by our results, was confirmed by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), which showed a lesion in the right precentral gyrus. It appears that changes in single motor unit firing characteristics, caused by an upper motor neuron lesion, can be detected at a time when there is no evidence of increased "tone" and/or hyperreflexia (spasticity) in the affected extremity. 
3	Sexual behavior of a sample of females with epilepsy. A sample of 700 female epileptic outpatients was examined between 1985 and 1987. The incidence of psychosexual disorders was 18%. Epileptic females with psychosexual disorders were compared with epileptic females without sexual disorders and with normal female controls on selected clinical and EEG parameters. Epileptic females with sexual disorders showed: lower marriage rates, a longer duration of illness, sexually colored prodromata, predominance of partial complex seizures (83%) and a higher incidence of menstrual abnormalities. Hyposexuality and exhibitionism were the psychosexual disorders most frequently noted. Temporal lobe EEG abnormalities were significantly higher. 
4	Pressure-length loop area: its components analyzed during graded myocardial ischemia. The changes in total pressure-length loop area were compared with changes in effective shortening area, systolic lengthening area and postsystolic shortening area (defined with respect to end-diastolic and end-systolic lengths) of the pressure-length loop during myocardial ischemia in seven anesthetized dogs instrumented for measurement of left ventricular pressure and regional segmental wall motion (sonomicrometry) in the minor axis of the apical region of the left ventricle. Ischemia was induced by gradual tightening of a micrometer-controlled snare around the left anterior descending coronary artery, which supplied the apical myocardium. Data were obtained at normal flow, after critical constriction (loss of pulsatile coronary flow), mild ischemia (ischemia 1: onset of regional dysfunction, i.e., postsystolic shortening and mild hypokinesia) and moderate ischemia (ischemia 2: marked hypokinesia). At each stage, acute afterloading was performed by partially occluding the descending thoracic aorta. The pressure-length loops were analyzed in terms of four areas: total loop area, effective shortening area, postsystolic shortening area and systolic lengthening area. Total loop area decreased only when marked hypokinesia was present (176 +/- 18.3 mm Hg x mm at ischemia 2 versus 245.1 +/- 26.9 mm Hg x mm at ischemia 1, p less than 0.05). However, effective shortening area (98.2 +/- 0.8% of total loop area at baseline; 93.8 +/- 2.4% at critical constriction; 76.3 +/- 7.2% at ischemia 1; 51.9 +/- 12.2% at ischemia 2) and postsystolic shortening area (1.8 +/- 0.8% of total loop area at baseline; 5.2 +/- 1.9% at critical constriction; 14.3 +/- 3/4% at ischemia 1; 23.8 +/- 5.1% at ischemia 2) changed significantly with each progressive stage of ischemia. 
3	A surgical approach to the cervicothoracic spine. We describe a method for approaching the lower cervical and upper thoracic spine, the brachial plexus and related vessels. The method involves the elevation of the medial corner of the manubrium, the sternoclavicular joint, and the medial half of the clavicle on a pedicle of the sternomastoid muscle. We have used this exposure in 17 cases with few complications and good results. Its successful performance requires high standards of anaesthesia, surgical technique and postoperative care. 
3	Magnetic resonance imaging in motor neuron disease. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain was evaluated in 20 patients with motor neuron disease (MND) and in a control group of 11 healthy people. Bilateral increased signal areas of various sizes in the centrum semiovale, corona radiata, internal capsule, pedunculi of midbrain, pons, medulla and even in the frontal lobe, topographically related with the corticospinal tract, were found in 8 out of 20 patients. Three out of 4 patients with progressive bulbar paralysis and 5 out of 11 cases of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis had abnormal MRI. Such MRI abnormalities have neither been found in patients with progressive muscular atrophy nor in controls, suggesting that they may be the hallmark of pyramidal tract degeneration in motor neuron disease. 
5	Ascites after rupture of dissecting aortic aneurysm into the right atrium. We report successful repair of an aneurysmal aorta-right atrial fistula causing intractable ascites. The clamped "ascending aorta" was drained for mixed return after perfusion through the femoral vessels and opened during hypothermic arrest. Return cannulation through the fistula permitted definitive repair. 
3	Human olfactory discrimination after unilateral frontal or temporal lobectomy. Olfactory discrimination and detection was studied in 106 patients with unilateral cerebral excision in the right or left temporal lobe, right or left frontal lobe, left parietal lobe, or right frontal and temporal lobes, and in 20 normal control subjects. Detection thresholds for n-butyl alcohol, measured separately in each nostril, did not differ across subject groups or across nostrils, thus excluding any primary sensory loss. The discrimination task involved monorhinal presentation of repairs of unfamiliar odorants, which the subjects judged as same or different in quality. The results showed a significant deficit in discrimination confined to the nostril ipsilateral to the lesion in patients with temporal lobe removals. Patients with frontal lobe excisions were also impaired and, for patients with right frontal lesions including the orbital cortex, the impairment was found in both nostrils. Patients with left parietal lesions did not demonstrate any significant deficits. Normal subjects showed consistently better performance in the right than in the left nostril. The results are interpreted as reflecting the importance of the orbitofrontal cortex in olfactory discrimination. Temporal lobe lesions may disrupt the input to the orbitofrontal cortex, thereby producing poorer performance. The nostril difference in the normal subjects, together with the birhinal impairment in patients with right orbitofrontal damage, suggest a relative advantage of the right orbital region in olfactory processing. 
4	Warm induction blood cardioplegia in the infant. A technique to avoid rapid cooling myocardial contracture. The use of profound hypothermia and total circulatory arrest for repair of heart defects in neonates usually involves a period of systemic and myocardial bypass cooling. Rapid cooling of muscle (skeletal, smooth, and myocardial) can result in contracture through elevation of cytosolic calcium levels. The increased myocardial tone caused by cooling might render the heart more vulnerable to a subsequent period of cardioplegic ischemic arrest. Infants may be more susceptible to contracture because their small body mass allows more rapid myocardial temperature change when prearrest bypass cooling is used. The influence of avoiding rapid myocardial cooling before induced cardioplegic arrest was analyzed in a group of infants weighing less than 6 kg at the time of open cardiac operation. Myocardial ischemic arrest by warm (37 degrees C) induction blood cardioplegia was used in 57 infants and compared with results in 440 infants treated with standard blood cardioplegia. Multivariate logistic regression analysis revealed that patient diagnosis, weight, and age at operation were significant risk factors for operative mortality. The use of warm induction blood cardioplegia had a strongly positive independent effect on survival (p = 0.0003) for any patient weight, age, or diagnostic group. We recommend the avoidance of rapid myocardial cooling on bypass in all patients before induction of cardioplegic ischemic arrest. 
4	Repair of posterior left ventricular aneurysm in a six-year-old boy. Left ventricular aneurysms and diverticula are rarely encountered in the pediatric age group. This paper reports a case of congestive heart failure and mitral regurgitation in a 6-year-old boy with a large posterolateral left ventricular aneurysm. Complete repair was successfully performed by excision of the aneurysm and Dacron patch reconstruction of the left ventricular free wall. The patch extended onto the posterior annulus of the mitral valve, thus restoring the mitral valve to normal geometry and correcting the mitral insufficiency. The surgical literature on congenital cardiac diverticula and acquired aneurysms in children is reviewed and summarized. 
5	The Senior Care Study. The optimal use of medications in acutely ill older patients. Geriatric assessment units have improved pharmacotherapy for their patients by decreasing the number of medications prescribed. The Senior Care Study, a randomized controlled trial, compared a multidisciplinary-team approach to patient care to the standard medical practice of the institution. As a part of the trial, the effectiveness of an interdisciplinary team intervention in improving the use of medications was studied. Study goals were to decrease medications used, decrease unnecessary medications, and improve medication choices in our acutely ill inpatient population. A pharmacist interviewed all experimental patients and patient records, and presented medication concerns and recommendations at a team conference. Medications were counted on admission and on the third day, sixth week, and third month after randomization. Medications were paired with patient problems. Medication:problem pairs were judged as inappropriate choices if there were potential side effects that would affect patient function, and if better alternatives were available. The 215 control and 221 experimental patients in the study were similar in age, sex, place of origin, and number of medications on admission. Experimental patients took fewer medications than controls on the third day (5.3 versus 5.9, P less than .05). Experimental patients received fewer multiple unpaired medications (11% versus 19%, P less than .025) and fewer inappropriate medication choices (20% versus 37%, P less than .005). The results suggest that the team intervention was effective in improving pharmacotherapy in the acute-care setting. 
1	Prostate-specific antigen for staging prior to surgery and for early detection of recurrence after surgery. The exact usefulness of prostate-specific antigen for staging before radical prostatectomy is still unclear. Perhaps the marker's most exciting feature is its value in detecting residual disease after radical prostatectomy. The author also discusses the technical questions in testing and interpretation. 
5	Abdominal aortic aneurysm with perianeurysmal fibrosis: experience from 11 Swedish vascular centers. Case records of 2026 patients operated on because of abdominal aortic aneurysms from 11 Swedish Vascular Centers were reviewed and revealed 98 cases (4.8%) of inflammatory abdominal aortic aneurysm. Also included in this case-control study was an analysis of a randomized group of 82 patients from the same centers who had noninflammatory abdominal aortic aneurysms. Four inflammatory aneurysms were ruptured, compared with 16 in the noninflammatory group (p less than 0.01). A higher proportion of patients with inflammatory abdominal aortic aneurysms had symptoms that led to radiographic investigations. The median erythrocyte sedimentation rate was 39 mm versus 19 mm (26% of patients with inflammatory abdominal aortic aneurysms had erythrocyte sedimentation rates greater than 50 mm; p less than 0.001), and the serum creatinine level was increased in 27 and 8 patients (p less than 0.01) in the inflammatory and noninflammatory groups, respectively. Preoperative investigations revealed ureteral obstruction in 19 patients with inflammatory abdominal aortic aneurysms, of whom 12 had preoperative nephrostomy or ureteral catheter placement. At operation, 20 additional patients exhibited fibrosis around one or both ureters. Although ureterolysis was performed in 19 patients, preoperative and postoperative creatinine levels did not differ between these patients and the conservatively treated ones. Duration of surgery (215 vs 218 minutes), intraoperative blood loss (2085 vs 2400 ml) and complications did not differ significantly between the groups. Overall operative (30-day) mortality was equal (11% vs 12%) but was increased for patients undergoing elective surgery for inflammatory abdominal aortic aneurysms (9% vs 0%; p = 0.03). 
1	The risk of lymph node metastasis in colorectal polyps with invasive adenocarcinoma. One hundred fifty-one patients with colorectal polyps containing invasive adenocarcinoma treated by resection were studied to determine the incidence of lymph node metastasis and whether lymph node metastasis was related to the depth of invasion. Other variables evaluated included size and configuration of the polyp, grade of adenocarcinoma, presence or absence of lymphovascular invasion, and degree of differentiation. In patients with sessile polyps, the incidence of lymph node metastasis was 10 percent. Eighty percent of these lesions had lymphovascular invasion. For pedunculated polyps, the overall incidence of lymph node metastasis was 6 percent. However, there was no incidence of lymph node metastasis when the depth of invasion was limited to the head, neck, and stalk of the polyp (Levels 1, 2, and 3). Only when the depth of invasion reached to the base of the stalk (Level 4) was the risk of lymph node metastasis high (27 percent). The other risk factors were not associated with lymph node metastasis. We concluded that the most significant risk factor for lymph node metastasis in patients with invasive carcinoma in a polyp was invasion into the submucosa of the bowel wall (Level 4). 
1	Effects of FUdR on primary-cultured colon carcinomas metastatic to the liver. Hepatic arterial infusion of fluorodeoxyuridine (FUdR) has demonstrated efficacy in the treatment of metastatic colorectal carcinoma of the liver. In this study, the direct cytotoxic effect of FUdR was measured on ten metastatic and two primary-site colorectal carcinomas in a primary culture assay system. Overall, clinically achievable concentrations of FUdR (0.4 to 4 microM) induced partial cell kill in 75% of tumors, including a greater than 50% reduction in viable tumor cell number in only two tumors and less than 50% in the remaining seven. Total cell kill was not observed in any tumor. Three tumors were resistant to these FUdR concentrations. Tumor sensitivity correlated with the size of the tumor growth fraction. Increasing the exposure time to FUdR from 3 to 7 days approximately doubled the magnitude of the response. 5-Flurouracil and cisplatin, at clinically achievable concentrations, were more toxic to metastatic tumor cells than FUdR. Because of the limited chemosensitivity of metastatic colorectal tumor cells to FUdR in vitro, we postulate that other mechanisms besides direct cytotoxicity contribute to the clinical efficacy of FUdR in vivo. 
1	Flexible sigmoidoscopy as a screening procedure in rural patients. In this study of flexible sigmoidoscopy as a screening procedure for rural, impoverished patients, 16% of asymptomatic patients who were screened by sigmoidoscopy and 23% of patients with a positive test for fecal occult blood were found to have a polyp or carcinoma. Flexible sigmoidoscopy appears to be an important part of the physical examination of patients older than 50. It is a test that can readily be done by primary care physicians in a rural setting. 
5	Intracatheter streptokinase for recurrent peritonitis in CAPD. Intracatheter streptokinase (SK) is advocated as effective treatment with minimal adverse effects in both recurrent bacterial peritonitis and catheter fibrin blockage in continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD) patients. We reviewed 35 instillations in 20 patients noting a high (86%) side effect profile consisting of fever, onset of turbid dialysis effluent and/or abdominal pain. SK probably releases fibrin clot containing bacteria, leukocytes and debris from the colonized catheter into the peritoneal cavity causing a "peritonitis-like syndrome" of 1 to 3 days duration. Fungal peritonitis occurred after SK in 2 patients. Failure of SK therapy was encountered in Staphylococcus epidermidis infection (p less than 0.05 versus other organisms), which may be related to its protective capsular polysaccharide slime and ability to adhere to plastic prosthetic devices. SK, in this study, was useful treatment in relapsing bacterial peritonitis (50% overall cure) but failed to correct catheter malfunction. 
1	Capillary hemangioma of the maxilla. A report of two cases in which angiography and embolization were used. This article presents two clinical cases of capillary hemangiomas of the maxilla. Such lesions are rare, as demonstrated by the review of the literature included in this article. The presentation, differential diagnosis, histopathology, management, and follow-up for each case are discussed. Our rationale for approaching these types of lesions, as well as our opinion that microembolization should be considered as a first line approach to treatment, is presented. 
5	Pathological observations of intrahepatic peribiliary glands in 1,000 consecutive autopsy livers. III. Survey of necroinflammation and cystic dilatation. Pathological changes and significance of intrahepatic peribiliary glands, hitherto poorly recognized intrahepatic elements, have been evaluated in our laboratory. In this report, we surveyed necroinflammatory and cystic changes of the peribiliary glands in 1,000 consecutive autopsy livers because these two changes coexisted frequently in the same liver. The necroinflammatory change was found in 228 livers (22.8%) and the cystic change in 202 livers (20.2%), and 103 cases showed both changes in the same liver. The necroinflammatory change was frequently found in intrahepatic cholangitis and extrahepatic biliary obstruction with bacterial infection, suggesting that biliary bacterial inflammation extends into these peribilary glands. This change was also frequent in systemic infection or septicemia without biliary bacterial infection, implying that the peribiliary glands were also damaged in such conditions without direct infection. The cystic change was frequent in livers with portal hypertension or obstruction, adult polycystic disease and necroinflammation of the glands, suggesting that the cystic change of the glands could occur as the result of the disturbance of intrahepatic circulation or as the result of inflammatory destruction of the glandular conduits. Some of peribiliary cysts may be of congenital origin. Dysfunction related to these pathological changes in the glands may diminish seromucous secretion and cause alterations in hepatic bile composition. The cystic change of the glands may retard bile flow by compressing bile duct lumina. 
5	Neonatal small bowel atresia, stenosis and segmental dilatation. In 8 years, 44 neonates were treated for small bowel atresia, stenosis or segmental dilatation by one surgical team. There was a single lesion in 30 infants and 14 had two or more sites of intestinal obstruction. Associated gastrointestinal abnormalities were found in 23 (52 per cent) patients. Resection of the atresia(s) and primary anastomosis were performed in 34 infants and staged procedures were carried out in ten patients with complicated lesions. Patients undergoing staged procedures had a higher complication rate than those having primary repair (six out of ten and 11 out of 34 respectively). The overall initial survival rate was 93 per cent, rising to 100 per cent in those without associated anomalies or prenatal complications, but more than a quarter (27 per cent) of survivors have long-term disabilities. 
2	Disorders of esophageal motility. Patients with esophageal motility disorders usually have dysphagia and many also have chest pain similar to angina. The diagnosis is suggested by the clinical presentation, and supporting evidence is often provided by contrast roentgenography. Esophageal manometry is usually necessary to confirm the diagnosis. Conservative therapy using pharmacologic agents is often useful as an initial trial, although many patients who continue to be symptomatic ultimately require surgical intervention. 
4	Successful treatment of an excimer laser-associated coronary artery perforation with the Stack perfusion catheter. A 64-year-old woman underwent excimer laser angioplasty of the right coronary artery. The procedure was complicated by perforation, which was successfully managed without complication with a Stack perfusion catheter. This report describes successful nonsurgical treatment of laser-induced coronary perforation and makes recommendations for avoiding this complication in other patients. 
2	Extracorporeal cholecystolithotripsy without oral chemolitholysis. One hundred thirty-six patients completed extracorporeal biliary lithotripsy (EBL) for symptomatic cholecystolithiasis. Sonographic evidence of complete clearance of all stone fragments was the only criterion for treatment success, which occurred in 32 of the 71 patients (45%) followed up for 24 weeks and in 36 of the 59 patients (61%) followed up for 52 weeks. The authors' protocol varied from protocols of other researchers primarily in that no adjuvant chemolitholysis was used. However, the number of treatment sessions and total number of shock waves (a maximum of 4,000 shock waves per treatment session, 12,000 shock waves in a patient demonstrating no significant fragmentation, and 20,000 shock waves in a patient whose stones responded well to fragmentation) was higher than those in other reports. The results of treatment and complication rates in this study are comparable with those at centers using both shock-wave lithotripsy and chemotherapy. The authors conclude that EBL is developing into an important alternative to surgery, which was obviated in all patients with complete clearance of fragments from the gallbladder. 
4	Cardiogenic hepatorenal syndrome. A variant of hepatorenal syndrome occurring in patients with chronic congestive heart failure following an episode of cardiogenic pulmonary edema, and in the absence of hypotension, is described. This was observed in 13 patients during an eleven-year period. The clinical picture is characterized by hepatic injury and functional renal impairment. Increase of serum glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase levels as high as 2100 IU; prolongation of prothrombin time; elevation of serum bilirubin, creatinine, blood urea nitrogen, and potassium levels; decrease in urinary sodium excretion; and a normal urinary sediment are the salient laboratory abnormalities of this entity. Treated with conventional medication, the patients' course was fatal in 4 cases. When the splanchnic vasodilator dopamine was added to the patients' management, 5 of 9 patients recovered. Cardiogenic hepatorenal syndrome is a severe but potentially reversible complication of heart failure. The apparently beneficial effect of low-dose dopamine needs further evaluation. 
4	Complications in percutaneous transluminal angioplasty: relationships with patient age. Five hundred consecutive attempted lower limb angioplasties for ischaemic disease (370 patients, mean age 65.6 years, range 33-91 years) were reviewed. Significant complications occurred in 44 cases (8.8%). Nine patients (1.8%) underwent emergency surgery related to a complication. A further 12 patients (2.4%) underwent elective surgery related to a complication. In addition, four patients died within 30 days of the procedure; one following surgery performed because of a complication of angioplasty, one following a myocardial infarction, one following severe bleeding associated with subsequent thrombolytic therapy and one during emergency surgery related to a complication of angioplasty. A correlation was found between complication rate and age. This relationship was independent of the approach to, the position of, and the severity of the treated lesion. Elderly patients are at increased risk of complication in lower limb angioplasty. 
5	Detection of active intraabdominal arterial hemorrhage: value of dynamic contrast-enhanced CT. Contrast-enhanced dynamic CT was used prospectively to diagnose and locate the site of active arterial intraabdominal hemorrhage in 18 patients. Active arterial extravasation was confirmed by angiography in five patients and by immediate surgery in nine. Two patients not undergoing surgery or angiography required multiple blood transfusions to correct rapidly falling hematocrit due to a coagulopathy. One patient died of hypovolemic shock, and autopsy confirmed a large acute retroperitoneal hematoma. Another patient with a splenic laceration and massive hemoperitoneum on CT had no active bleeding at the time of surgery, which was delayed 1 hr from the time of the CT. All patients were clinically thought to be hemodynamically stable and had systolic blood pressures greater than 110 mm Hg at the time of CT. In seven patients, hypotension developed either during (two patients) or immediately after (five patients) CT scanning, necessitating either immediate surgery or angiographic embolization. Contrast-enhanced dynamic CT is valuable in the diagnosis and localization of active arterial intraabdominal hemorrhage. Identification of the anatomic site of this potentially life-threatening hemorrhage is critical in determining whether immediate laparotomy or angiographic embolization is the preferred method of treatment. 
5	Tumorigenic 3T3 cells maintain an alkaline intracellular pH under physiological conditions. One of the earliest events in the response of mammalian cells to mitogens is activation of Na+/H+ exchange, which increases intracellular pH (pHin) in the absence of HCO3- or at external pH values below 7.2. The proliferative response can be blocked by preventing the pHin increase; yet, the proliferative response cannot be stimulated by artificially raising pHin with weak bases or high medium pH. These observations support the hypothesis that optimal pHin is a necessary, but not sufficient, component of the proliferative-response sequence. This hypothesis has recently been challenged by the observation that transfection of NIH 3T3 cells with yeast H(+)-ATPase renders them tumorigenic. Although previous measurements indicated that these transfected cells maintain a higher pHin in the absence of HCO3-, whether H(+)-ATPase transfection raised the pHin under physiologically relevant conditions was not known. The current report shows that these transfected cells do maintain a higher pHin than control cells in the presence of HCO3-, supporting the possibility that elevated pHin is a proliferative trigger in situ. We also show that these cells are serum-independent for growth and that they glycolyze much more rapidly than phenotypically normal cells. 
5	The significance of gastrinomas found in peripancreatic lymph nodes. A patient with Zollinger-Ellison syndrome (ZES) was found to have a solitary, extrapancreatic, extraintestinal gastrinoma in a peripancreatic lymph node. Preoperative studies did not show the location of the tumor. After excision of the gastrinoma the patient's fasting serum gastrin level dropped from preoperative levels of 596 pg/ml to 120 pg/ml (normal, less than 200 pg/ml). Fasting and stimulated gastrin levels have remained within the normal range at 18 months follow-up. This patient had previously undergone antrectomy, so it could not be determined if this tumor represented a primary lymph node gastrinoma or metastasis from an unrecognized tumor that may have been present in the resected stomach or duodenum. The outcome of this case confirms the previous reports that ZES can be controlled after resection of gastrinomas that were contained within abdominal lymph nodes, even if a primary enteropancreatic tumor is not found. Our results also support the use of an aggressive operative search aimed at eradication of the tumor in patients with ZES even if preoperative localization studies fail to identify the site of the gastrinoma. 
1	Prognostic factors in craniofacial surgery. From 1979 to 1989, 21 patients underwent craniofacial resection for malignancies involving the anterior skull base. Histologic types included 8 squamous cell carcinomas, 3 chondrosarcomas, 2 melanomas, 2 basal cell carcinomas, 2 adenocarcinomas, 2 poorly differentiated carcinomas, 1 malignant schwannoma, and 1 malignant hemangiopericytoma. Survival was 57%, with follow-up of 41 months. A 50% complication rate included osteomyelitis, cerebrospinal fluid rhinorrhea, meningitis, brain abscess, epidural abscess, and syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone. Recurrent disease occurred in 9 patients (41%), the most reliable predictor being dural invasion indicated preoperatively by CT scan or at operation. Patients demonstrating dural involvement (N = 9) had a 22% survival rate, while patients without (N = 12) had a survival rate of 83%. The impact of dural invasion on long-term survival is emphasized. Though complications were frequent, long-term results were favorable. 
5	Supplemental emergent chest computed tomography in the management of blunt torso trauma. The efficacy of conventional chest X-ray (CXR) in comparison to chest computed tomography (CCT) in acutely injured blunt trauma patients was examined. Over a 21-month period, 50 patients underwent CXR and CCT according to a standard protocol, and their films and records were reviewed retrospectively. Hemo- and/or pneumothorax (HPTX) was noted in 12 patients (five by CXR, 12 by CCT). Pulmonary contusion (PC) was identified in ten patients (four by CXR, ten by CCT). Three additional false positive PC were diagnosed by CXR. Therapy changes based upon CCT findings occurred in seven of seven HPTX and five of six PC. The two imaging techniques were complementary in detecting fractures. Atelectasis was a common CCT finding (58% incidence). Chest X-ray is less sensitive than chest computed tomography in the detection of HPTX (42% vs. 100%) and PC (40% vs. 100%). Emergent chest computed tomography is recommended in stable patients with: 1) blunt high-energy torso trauma, 2) "cross-body" injury pattern, and/or 3) a mechanism of injury suggestive of chest trauma. 
5	Saccular aneurysms of the distal anterior cerebral artery. We report a series of 42 consecutive patients with aneurysms of the distal anterior cerebral artery (ACA). Of these, 36 patients had one aneurysm, 5 had two aneurysms, and one had three aneurysms. Thirty patients had a ruptured distal ACA aneurysm; among these patients, the size of the aneurysm was less than 5 mm in diameter in 20, 6 to 10 mm in 7, and larger than 11 mm in 3. Eighteen patients (42.9%) had multiple aneurysms, and distal ACA aneurysms were responsible for a subarachnoid hemorrhage in 10. Thirty-four patients underwent direct surgery, and 30 of these had excellent outcomes 3 months after surgery. The treatment of patients with distal ACA aneurysms is often technically difficult, because of their broad neck configuration and the coexistence of other aneurysms. Nevertheless, the present study emphasizes that distal ACA aneurysms tend to bleed, irrespective of their size, and that excellent outcomes are obtainable by direct surgery. 
4	Does isoflurane lead to a higher incidence of myocardial infarction and perioperative death than enflurane in coronary artery surgery? A clinical study of 1178 patients To examine if the choice of volatile agents influences cardiac outcome in coronary artery surgery, 1178 patients undergoing elective coronary artery bypass grafting without additional operations received enflurane (608) or isoflurane (570) as their primary anesthetics. The inspired concentration of volatile agent (administered with 50% nitrous oxide) was adjusted depending on the level of blood pressure at the discretion of the anesthesiologist. In addition to the volatile agent assigned, each patient received small doses of fentanyl at induction and before sternotomy (total 0.006-0.008 mg/kg). The groups did not differ in preoperative and surgical characteristics except for a more frequent history of renal dysfunction in patients given isoflurane. The rates of postoperative myocardial infarction, administration of positive inotropic agents at the time of weaning from cardiopulmonary bypass, and in-hospital deaths in the enflurane and isoflurane groups were 1.8% and 4.0% (P less than 0.05), 4.9% and 8.1% (P less than 0.05%), and 0.3% and 2.1% (P less than 0.01), respectively. Although the mechanism of the adverse effects of isoflurane could not be clarified in this study, these results demonstrate that the use of isoflurane could be inappropriate in patients undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting. 
5	The morbidity and financial impact of colostomy closure in trauma patients. During a 10-year period, 87 patients who had undergone elective colostomy closure at Bellevue Hospital were retrospectively reviewed in order to evaluate the morbidity of colostomy closure after traumatic injury and its financial impact. Sixty-two per cent of the colostomies were in the left colon and 38% were right sided. The interval from the original injury to colostomy takedown varied from 20 to 465 days, with a mean of 144 days. The mean postoperative hospital stay for the entire group was 15.13 days at a cost of $13,995. There were no deaths and no anastomotic leaks in the entire series, but a morbidity rate of 25% ensued. Small bowel obstruction was the most frequent significant complication, occurring in ten patients (11.5%) and resulting in a prolongation of hospital stay by 7 days at an additional cost of $6,500 per patient. One additional patient developed a subphrenic abscess which required operative drainage, necessitating an additional 24 days in the hospital at an increased cost of $22,200. Other complications which did not prolong hospital stay included eight superficial wound infections, one transient respiratory failure, and two patients who returned at a later date with incisional hernias at the stoma site. The 25% morbidity encountered in this series suggests that colostomy closure is not a low-morbidity procedure and should be considered as an important factor favoring primary repair. Coupled with the significant financial impact of both colostomy formation and takedown, ample justification exists for greater efforts in avoiding colostomy formation whenever feasible. 
1	Reversible hearing loss from cerebellopontine angle tumors. We report two patients who presented with a dramatic recovery from severe sensorineural hearing loss after total surgical removal of cerebellopontine angle tumors (meningioma and jugular foramen neurinoma). The factors that differentiate these "non-acoustic tumors" in relation to the prognosis for hearing are discussed. A surgical approach that maintains the labyrinthine structure and preserves the arachnoid membrane of the superior cerebellopontine angle cistern during tumor removal is stressed. 
5	Fine needle aspiration of pancreatic fluid collections. The complications of pancreatitis remain diagnostic and therapeutic challenges. Patients with simple pancreatitis, pancreatic necrosis, pseudocyst, noninfected fluid collection or abscess may all have similar clinical pictures. During the last decade computerized tomography (CT)-guided needle aspiration of peripancreatic fluid collections has been increasingly used as a diagnostic tool for pancreatic abscesses. This study reviewed the effectiveness of CT-guided needle aspiration of peripancreatic fluid collections at our institution in terms of diagnostic accuracy, correlation with eventual outcome, and safety. Charts of patients who underwent needle aspiration of de novo peripancreatic fluid collections over the past 2 years were reviewed. Thirty-five patients underwent 50 aspirations. Eleven patients (31%) had a positive aspirate culture; seven of these had a positive Gram's stain. There were no false positive Gram's stains but four false negatives. Twenty-four (69%) patients had negative aspirate Gram's stains and cultures. Patients with positive aspirate cultures were treated with antibiotics only (2), CT-guided drain placement (7), or surgical drainage (3). The mortality related to each of these therapeutic modalities was 50 per cent, 0 per cent, and 33 per cent, respectively. Of the 24 patients with negative aspirate cultures, five had no further treatment, 12 received antibiotics, and six underwent CT drain placement. All these patients survived. There was one false negative aspirate culture. This patient underwent delayed surgical drainage but expired. There were no major complications from CT-guided aspiration. CT-guided aspiration appears to be a safe and reliable method of diagnosing infection in peripancreatic fluid collections. 
2	Atracurium decay and the formation of laudanosine in humans. Several groups of investigators have reported that the plasma concentrations of laudanosine, a metabolite of atracurium, are high immediately after administration of atracurium and thereafter decline. Such a time profile of a metabolite in plasma is very unusual. The authors describe a model of atracurium decay and laudanosine disposition that satisfactorily explains these data. The model reveals the following: 1) each atracurium molecule is degraded into two of laudanosine; 2) the generation of laudanosine occurs through two processes--a rapid one, involving approximately 31% of the atracurium dose and proceeding with a half-life of 0.25 min, and a slower one, involving the residual 69% and proceeding with a half-life of 51 min; 3) atracurium degradation by Hofmann elimination proceeds in the central and the noncentral compartments; 4) laudanosine formed from atracurium gains access to its central compartment and disappears from plasma in a biexponential pattern; 5) in cirrhotic patients, only 18% of the atracurium dose is degraded rapidly and laudanosine is disposed of more slowly. The authors propose that the rapid degradation of atracurium in plasma proceeds through a nucleophilic substitution reaction, with plasma nucleophiles substituting for the laudanosine moiety in atracurium. Because both laudanosine moieties in atracurium are required to establish and sustain plasma concentrations of laudanosine, excretion of atracurium or its degradation through pathways not generating laudanosine must be small. 
4	Different plasma ionized calcium correlations with blood pressure in high and low renin normotensive adults in Utah. Plasma ionized calcium levels have been shown to be lower than normotensive control levels in hypertensive patients with low plasma renin activity and higher than control levels in hypertensive patients with high renin activity; they did not differ between high and low plasma renin activity groups of normotensive controls. To see if ionized calcium may have different relationships with blood pressure across renin categories in normotensive individuals, plasma ionized calcium was measured on 875 healthy individuals, ages 3 to 83, who had never been diagnosed as having hypertension. Blood pressures were measured in the sitting, standing, and supine positions, along with pressures measured during two stress maneuvers: isometric handgrip and a 50 degrees tilt from a supine position. There was no linear correlation of blood pressure with plasma ionized calcium in the entire sample of youths or adults. However, after dividing the adults into tertiles based on plasma renin activity, there were significant inverse correlations between ionized calcium and systolic and diastolic blood pressure in the low renin group (r = -0.16 to -0.25, P less than or equal to .05), while the systolic blood pressure correlations were significantly positive in the high renin group (r = 0.14 to 0.22, P less than or equal to .05). Adults with normal renin levels did not have any significant correlations of plasma ionized calcium with blood pressure. These confounding effects of renin were greater for systolic than for diastolic blood pressure. These correlations within renin tertiles occurred even though there were no differences in mean blood pressure, plasma ionized calcium, total plasma protein and plasma sodium across renin categories. 
5	Infection with HIV as a risk factor for adverse obstetrical outcome. We carried out a case-control study to investigate the role of sexually transmitted diseases (STDs), including infection with HIV, as risk factors for adverse outcome of pregnancy. Overall, 1507 women were enrolled within 24 h of delivery. Cases (n = 796) were mothers of low-birthweight infants (less than 2500 g) or of stillborns. Low-birthweight infants were divided into preterms (n = 373) and neonates small for gestational age (n = 234). Stillborns were separated into intrauterine fetal deaths (n = 120), and intrapartum fetal deaths (n = 69). Controls were selected from mothers delivering a live baby of greater than or equal to 2500 g (n = 711). The maternal HIV seroprevalence in the control group was 3.1%. Prematurity was associated with maternal HIV antibody [8.6% seropositive; adjusted odds ratio (OR) 2.1; 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.1-4.0], as was being born small for gestational age (7.7% seropositive; adjusted OR 2.3; 95% CI 1.2-4.2). In mothers who delivered a stillborn baby, both intrauterine fetal death (11.7% seropositive; adjusted OR 2.7; 95% CI 1.3-5.5) and intrapartum fetal death (11.6% seropositive; adjusted OR 2.9; 95% CI 1.3-6.5) were independently associated with HIV seropositivity in the mother. Maternal syphilis was confirmed as an important risk factor for intrauterine fetal death (14.3% positive; adjusted OR 4.8; 95% CI 2.4-9.5). No significant association was found between other STDs, including gonococcal and chlamydial infection, and adverse obstetrical outcome. These results suggest an association between maternal HIV infection and adverse obstetrical outcome, defined as low birthweight and stillbirth. 
1	Preliminary studies for an immunotherapeutic approach to the treatment of human myeloma using chimeric anti-CD38 antibody. Multiple myeloma is a disease in which conventional chemotherapy has only limited value, but which may be ideal for treatment with passive antibody against a suitable cell surface antigen on the neoplastic plasma cell. The CD38 antigen is known to be present on the majority of neoplastic plasma cells, and this was confirmed by detailed examination of bone marrow aspirates from three patients. Strong expression of CD38 was confined to cells which, by the criteria of light-scattering profiles and possession of cytoplasmic Ig, were plasma cells. The vast majority of neoplastic plasma cells appeared to be involved. Using a cell line as a model, it was found that the CD38 antigen acts as a target for a chimeric antibody prepared from the antibody OKT10. The chimeric antibody consists of the Fab portion of the mouse monoclonal antibody linked by a stable thioether bond to an Fc molecule derived from human IgG1, thereby forming mouse Fab-human Fc. In contrast to the parent antibody, the chimeric molecule mediates antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) very efficiently with human blood mononuclear effector cells, and is effective at low concentration. Also, even though the CD38 antigen is present on natural killer cells, there appears to be little deleterious action of the antibody on effector cell function. The antibody also failed to affect the growth of progenitor cells of the granulocyte/macrophage or erythroid lineages present in normal bone marrows, despite the suspicion that these cells express the antigen. Other advantages of the CD38 molecule are that it is not found in the serum of patients with myeloma, and it does not appear to modulate in vitro. Fourteen patients with florid myeloma and on various chemotherapeutic regimes had an undiminished capacity to mediate ADCC with the chimeric antibody, when compared with normal individuals. The maintenance of ADCC activity, coupled with the known suppression of the antibody response in these patients, augers well for treatment with chimeric antibody. 
2	Immunohistochemical demonstration of pancreatic secretory trypsin inhibitor in normal and neoplastic colonic mucosa. Specimens of normal and neoplastic colonic mucosa from 52 patients were analysed by immunohistochemistry using a monospecific polyclonal antiserum against human pancreatic secretory trypsin inhibitor (PSTI). In normal colonic mucosa PSTI was found in the goblet cells in the basal parts of the crypts. In adenomas of tubular, villous, and tubulo-villous types PSTI was also found in the upper parts of the polyps, usually occurring in the regeneration zone. There was a more intense staining reaction in polyps with increased atypia. Carcinomas of different types and of various grades of differentiation and of in situ type did not contain PSTI. These findings indicate that PSTI could be a marker for adenomatous rather than carcinomatous epithelium in the colon. Furthermore, the absence of the inhibitor in malignant cells might facilitate tissue invasion by malignant cells because of deficient protease inhibition. 
3	Epirubicin at two dose levels with prednisolone as treatment for advanced breast cancer: the results of a randomized trial. Two hundred eleven patients with advanced breast cancer were randomized to receive either epirubicin (E) 50 mg/m2 and prednisolone (LEP) or E 100 mg/m2 and prednisolone (HEP). The intended treatment consisted of 16 courses of LEP or eight courses of HEP given at 3-weekly intervals. Reasons for stopping treatment early included progressive disease, stable disease without symptomatic improvement, or severe toxicity deemed intolerable by either the patient or physician. Toxicity was recorded at 3-weekly and response at 9-weekly intervals using the World Health Organization (WHO) criteria of response and toxicity. Two hundred nine patients were eligible for analysis, 98% of whom have been followed for more than a year. One hundred four patients received LEP and 105 HEP. Significantly worse myelosuppression, alopecia, nausea and vomiting, and mucositis were seen in the high-dose arm (P less than or equal to .001). More patients in the LEP arm stopped treatment before the fourth course than in the HEP arm, and the commonest reason for stopping was progressive disease. A similar median number of courses was given in each arm. There was a significantly higher response in the HEP arm (HEP - complete response [CR] + partial response [PR] = 41%, LEP - CR + PR = 23%). Despite this, no statistically significant differences was seen in overall survival or progression-free interval. The median survival for HEP and LEP was 44 and 46 weeks, respectively. 
4	Alterations in aldosterone secretion and metabolism in low renin hypertension. Low renin essential hypertensives (LRH) have normal plasma aldosterone levels which are inappropriately high in relation to their PRA. Posture is the major determinant for plasma aldosterone and PRA levels, but it is not known whether postural increments (delta) of plasma aldosterone and (delta) PRA are also abnormal in LRH. To evaluate this, LRH (n = 8), normal renin hypertensives (NRH; n = 9), normotensive controls (n = 18), and subjects with idiopathic hyperaldosteronism (IHA; n = 5) were studied in a metabolic unit on a controlled diet over 7 days. Overnight supine and 4-h upright PRA, plasma aldosterone, and 24-h urinary tetrahydroaldosterone (THA) and aldosterone secretion rates (ASR) were measured. The delta in plasma aldosterone after 4 h of upright posture was not different in the four groups. The ratio of delta plasma aldosterone/delta PRA, however, was elevated in both IHA and LRH compared to that in NRH and normals. THA excretion was also elevated in IHA and LRH, but LRH had a normal ASR. This resulted in a higher fractional THA excretion (THA/ASR) in LRH compared to the other three groups. These data further support enhanced adrenal angiotensin-II sensitivity in LRH. Aldosterone was preferentially metabolized to THA in LRH. Since THA has reduced biological activity, this may be a compensatory mechanism to reduce mineralocorticoid activity in LRH. 
5	Flow cytometric detection of tumor metastases during urologic surgery. Flow cytometric studies were performed on peripheral blood obtained before, during, and subsequent to urologic surgery. The results suggest that 7 of 11 patients had a brief period during surgical manipulation when they had cells from the primary surgical site in the peripheral blood. Concentration of such cells was generally less than 10(2)/mL even during the intraoperative period. These findings suggest that perioperative tumor seeding is a real concern, and that flow cytometry can be used to study maneuvers to reduce its incidence. 
1	Occupational sunlight exposure and melanoma in the U.S. Navy. Melanoma is the second most common cancer, after testicular cancer, in males in the U.S. Navy. A wide range of occupations with varying exposures to sunlight and other possible etiologic agents are present in the Navy. Person-years at risk and cases of malignant melanoma were ascertained using computerized service history and inpatient hospitalization files maintained at the Naval Health Research Center. A total of 176 confirmed cases of melanoma were identified in active-duty white male enlisted Navy personnel during 1974-1984. Risk of melanoma was determined for individual occupations and for occupations grouped by review of job descriptions into three categories of sunlight exposure: (1) indoor, (2) outdoor, or (3) indoor and outdoor. Compared with the U.S. civilian population, personnel in indoor occupations had a higher age-adjusted incidence rate of melanoma, i.e., 10.6 per 100,000 (p = .06). Persons who worked in occupations that required spending time both indoors and outdoors had the lowest rate, i.e., 7.0 per 100,000 (p = .06). Incidence rates of melanoma were higher on the trunk than on the more commonly sunlight-exposed head and arms. Two single occupations were found to have elevated rates of melanoma: (1) aircrew survival equipmentman, SIR = 6.8 (p less than .05); and (2) engineman, SIR = 2.8 (p less than .05). However, there were no cases of melanoma or no excess risk in occupations with similar job descriptions. Findings on the anatomical site of melanoma from this study suggest a protective role for brief, regular exposure to sunlight and fit with recent laboratory studies that have shown vitamin D to suppress growth of malignant melanoma cells in tissue culture. A mechanism is proposed in which vitamin D inhibits previously initiated melanomas from becoming clinically apparent. 
5	Effect of dietary alpha-linolenic acid on growth, metastasis, fatty acid profile and prostaglandin production of two murine mammary adenocarcinomas. The purpose of this study was to determine whether dietary (n-3) fatty acids would affect mammary tumor growth and metastasis. Weanling female BALB/c mice were fed diets that contained 10% corn oil (CO), linseed oil (LO) or a fish oil-corn oil mix (FO) for 3-8 wk prior to receiving subcutaneous injections of one of two syngeneic mammary tumor cell types (410 and 410.4). Tumor growth was assessed by monitoring mean tumor diameter and tumor weight upon removal. Feeding LO, but not FO, reduced the growth (p less than 0.05) of 410.4 mammary tumors compared with growth in those fed CO. Metastasis data paralleled the tumor growth rate. Feeding LO and FO enhanced (p less than 0.005) incorporation of (n-3) fatty acids into tumors. Tumor prostaglandin E (PGE) production was reduced (p less than 0.005) by LO and FO, compared with CO. FO feeding reduced 410.4 tumor PGE synthesis more (p less than 0.05) than LO feeding, yet tumor growth was only inhibited by LO. These data suggest an inhibitory effect of dietary linolenic acid [i.e., 18:3 (n-3)] on mammary tumor growth and metastasis. However, this effect did not directly correlate with diet-induced changes in PGE synthesis. 
4	A note on the measurement of hypertension in HHANES Using data from the HHANES, we found the rates of elevated blood pressure readings on clinical examination to be extremely low for a sample of Mexican American and Puerto Rican women. The prevalence rates were one-fourth to one-fifth the rates found for a comparable sample of White women from NHANESII. These findings are discrepant with the little that is known about hypertension prevalence among Hispanics and with estimates of hypertension prevalence for Mexican Americans and Puerto Ricans drawn from NHANESII. While our HHANES samples women had much lower rates of clinical high blood pressure than Whites, they reported hypertension histories in excess of Whites. Rates of medicine usage among Hispanics were insufficiently large for effective treatment to explain the disparity. The prevalence estimates increased, but the relative discrepancies remained when we altered our sample specifications and clinical high blood pressure measure. A possible explanation for these discrepancies is that few physicians performed the majority of blood pressure readings in our HHANES sample. This may have been statistically inefficient. The discrepancies noted suggest that HHANES may not be a reliable source of information on hypertension among Hispanic women. 
5	Brachial-jugular polytetrafluoroethylene fistulas for hemodialysis. A retrospective analysis was made of 16 patients who had received a brachial-jugular polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) graft for hemodialysis. In four patients, the procedure was used to treat malfunctioning brachio-axillary fistulas due to long venous stenosis in the axillary vein. In 12 other patients, the operation was chosen in cases of exhaustion of the veins in the upper extremity because of previous multiple failed fistulas. Two patients died with a functioning fistula 7 and 10 months after placement of the graft of causes unrelated to the vascular access. The other 14 patients retained functioning fistulas between 8 and 26 months after construction of the shunt. Three patients needed graft thrombectomy to treat occlusive episodes. No venous stenosis was found in a postoperative fistulography made in those patients. One patient needed substitution of a graft segment due to stenosis of the prosthesis crossing over the clavicle. We believe that the brachial-jugular graft is a procedure that can be considered as vascular access for hemodialysis in cases where the use of veins in the upper extremity and the axilla is not possible. 
5	Potential value of hormone receptor assay in carcinoma in situ of breast. The estrogen receptor (ER) expression of invasive breast cancer has been extensively studied both biochemically and with specific monoclonal antibodies against ER. Relatively few studies have attempted to characterize ER pattern in breast carcinoma in situ (CIS) and in other premalignant lesions. In the current study, the authors investigated the pattern of ER expression in 62 cases of breast CIS, 30 of which had a component of invasive cancer, and 36 cases of atypical hyperplasia. Paraffin sections of formalin-fixed breast tissue underwent enzyme pretreatment to expose nuclear antigenic sites as previously described. Breast tissues then underwent estrogen immunocytochemical assay using specific monoclonal antibodies (Abbott Laboratory, Chicago, IL). The cases were evaluated for heterogeneity, intensity of staining, and percentage of ER-positive cells. An attempt was made to study the relation between the pattern of ER expression, nuclear pleomorphism, and type of CIS. The results of ER immunocytochemical assay showed positive nuclear staining for ER in 75% of the CIS, 73% of CIS with invasive cancer, and 100% of atypical hyperplasias. ER expression in CIS agreed with that in the invasive carcinoma in 29 of 30 cases. This study also suggests that comedocarcinoma has a higher incidence of negative ER expression than the other types of CIS, particularly when it is associated with significant nuclear pleomorphism. There was no significant difference in ER tumor heterogeneity between premalignant and malignant lesions. 
4	Two-way factorial study of alcohol and salt restriction in treated hypertensive men. The aim of this study was to determine whether moderate restriction of dietary salt intake leads to an additional fall in blood pressure in treated hypertensive men who are asked to simultaneously reduce their usual alcohol intake. Sixty-three subjects entered an initial 2-week familiarization period during which they continued their usual alcohol intake and commenced a "low sodium" diet (less than 60 mmol/day) supplemented with 100 mmol sodium chloride per day as enteric-coated tablets. Subjects were then randomly assigned to either drink a low alcohol beer alone for a 4-week period (reducing their self-reported alcohol consumption from 537 to 57 ml/week) or to continue their usual alcohol intake (543 versus 557 ml/week). Within the low and normal alcohol intake groups, subjects were assigned to either a low or normal sodium intake. The low sodium groups continued the sodium-restricted diet but were switched to placebo sodium chloride tablets for the 4 weeks. This resulted in a fall in the 24-hour urinary sodium excretion from 144 to 69 mmol/day. The normal sodium groups continued the low sodium diet but kept taking 100 mmol/day of the sodium chloride tablets, and their urinary sodium excretion remained unchanged (125 versus 142 mmol/day). Regular antihypertensive therapy was continued throughout. Fifty-nine subjects completed the trial. In those who reduced their alcohol intake there was a fall in both systolic blood pressure (-5.4 mm Hg supine, p less than 0.01) and diastolic blood pressure (-3.2 mm Hg supine, p less than 0.01). 
3	Plasticity in the aging brain. Reversibility of anatomic, metabolic, and cognitive deficits in normal-pressure hydrocephalus following shunt surgery. The course of idiopathic normal-pressure hydrocephalus was studied in a 78-year-old woman with a 4-year history of progressive dementia who underwent neuropsychologic testing, quantitative x-ray computed tomography, magnetic resonance imaging, and positron emission tomography with fludeoxyglucose F 18 to measure rates of regional cerebral glucose utilization. Preshunt cognitive testing demonstrated progressive deterioration during 2 years, and positron emission tomography showed significant reductions in regional cerebral glucose utilization of 34% to 49% as compared with age- and sex-matched control subjects in frontal, temporal, parietal, and whole brain regions. Periodic testing, carried out during a 2-year period after shunt surgery, showed steady improvement in clinical status. Parallel to the clinical changes, there was a significant reversal in neuropsychologic test scores with increased brain volume and increased regional cerebral glucose utilization in several brain regions. These results documented the considerable potential for recovery of compromised brain function in older subjects even after 4 years of progressive brain disease. 
1	Data compression: effect on diagnostic accuracy in digital chest radiography. High-resolution digital images make up very large data sets that are relatively slow to transmit and expensive to store. Data compression techniques are being developed to address this problem, but significant image deterioration can occur at high compression ratios. In this study, the authors evaluated a form of adaptive block cosine transform coding, a new compression technique that allows considerable compression of digital radiographs with minimal degradation of image quality. To determine the effect of data compression on diagnostic accuracy, observer tests were performed with 60 digitized chest radiographs (2,048 x 2,048 matrix, 1,024 shades of gray) containing subtle examples of pneumothorax, interstitial infiltrate, nodules, and bone lesions. Radiographs with no compression, with 25:1 compression, and with 50:1 compression ratios were presented in randomized order to 12 radiologists. The results suggest that, with this compression scheme, compression ratios as high as 25:1 may be acceptable for primary diagnosis in chest radiology. 
2	A simple score for the identification of patients at high risk of organic diseases of the colon in the family doctor consulting room. The Local IBS Study Group. In order to develop a scoring system for selecting patients at high risk of organic diseases of the colon, who would need a colonoscopy or a barium enema, we conducted a study with 14 GPs in the local health care district of Modena. Over one year, 254 consecutive patients who consulted their GP for chronic abdominal pain were asked to answer a guided questionnaire. A checklist of simple parameters suggestive of the presence of organic diseases of the colon was also registered by the GP. For the final diagnosis, the patients underwent either a colonoscopy or a barium enema. Data collected were analysed by means of a stepwise logistic regression analysis to obtain a weighted score for the diagnosis of either irritable bowel syndrome (score less than 0) or organic disease (score greater than 0). Out of the 25 parameters explored, six were significantly more common among patients with organic disease and weighted as positive score (namely ESR greater than 17 mm, first hour, history of blood in the stool, leukocytosis greater than 10,000 cm3, age greater than 45 years, slight fever and presence of neoplastic colonic diseases in first-degree relatives). On the contrary, five parameters were more frequent among patients with irritable bowel syndrome and weighted as negative score (namely visible distension of the abdomen, feeling of distension, presence of irritable bowel syndrome in first degree relatives, flatulence and irregularities of bowel movement). Our scoring system correctly classified 83.5% of the cases, and it was very sensitive (82.4%) for the diagnosis of organic disease. 
3	Vagus nerve stimulation in humans: neurophysiological studies and electrophysiological monitoring. Evidence from studies of experimental animals indicates that electrical stimulation of the vagus nerve alters behavioral and electrographic seizure activity. We report on effects of electrical stimulation of the vagus nerve in five patients with medically intractable seizures as part of a clinical trial of chronic vagal stimulation for control of epilepsy. The mechanism of action of the vagal antiepileptic effect is unknown, and it is hoped that analysis of electrophysiological effects of vagal nerve stimulation will help elucidate which brain areas are affected. Stimulation of the left vagus nerve in the neck was accomplished with a programmable implanted stimulator. Effects of stimulus amplitude, duration, and rate were studied. Noncephalic reference recording of the vagus-nerve-evoked potential showed some unusual properties: a scalp negative component occurred with latency of 12 ms, very high amplitude (up to 60 microV), and widespread scalp distribution. Field distribution studies indicate that this potential is generated in the neck, in the region of the stimulating electrodes. Muscle paralysis confirms this observation. Stimulation at various frequencies had no noticeable effect on electroencephalographic (EEG) activity regardless of whether the patient was under general anesthesia, awake, or asleep. 
5	Clinical evaluation of an acetaminophen meter for the rapid diagnosis of acetaminophen intoxication. STUDY OBJECTIVES: To test the accuracy of a newly developed meter that determines serum acetaminophen concentration after a 30-second analysis of one drop of whole blood. DESIGN: Sixty-six blood samples from patients with known or suspected drug overdose were analyzed for the presence of acetaminophen. In all cases determination of serum acetaminophen concentration was performed simultaneously with the meter and by a reference laboratory. SETTING: Eligible patients were those who presented during a nine-month period to the emergency departments of two tertiary care hospitals (including a pediatric hospital). RESULTS: Thirty-one specimens had a laboratory-confirmed detectable acetaminophen concentration. The meter identified these toxic specimens in all cases; there were no false-negatives (sensitivity, 100%). Among the 35 specimens not containing acetaminophen, the meter invariably confirmed a nondetectable serum acetaminophen concentration (specificity, 100%). Acetaminophen measurements by the meter correlated strongly with laboratory determinations (r = .985, P less than .001). Repeated testing of one specimen documented the precision and reproducibility of the meter's analysis; mean coefficient of variation was .08 in measuring toxic acetaminophen concentrations. Drug coingestion had no significant effect on the accuracy of the meter. Instrument accuracy was maintained after more than 100 uses without recalibration. CONCLUSIONS: This meter identifies the possibility of rapid and accurate determinations of serum acetaminophen concentration. The instrument is ideally suited for patients with acetaminophen poisoning in whom expeditious and appropriate administration of antidotal therapy is desired. 
2	Modulation of mediator release from human intestinal mast cells by sulfasalazine and 5-aminosalicylic acid. Intestinal mast cells are thought to contribute to the mucosal inflammation in ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease through release of inflammatory mediators. Since sulfasalazine and its metabolite 5-aminosalicylic acid are effective therapeutic agents in inflammatory bowel disease and have been shown to inhibit generation of inflammatory products in other cells, we examined the effect of these agents in vitro on human intestinal mast cell mediator release. Sulfasalazine (5 x 10(-4)-10(-3) M) was found to significantly enhance goat anti-human IgE-induced histamine release from intestinal mast cells, which is the same response as seen in human blood basophils, whereas its metabolite 5-aminosalicylic acid was an effective inhibitor of stimulated histamine release in both mast cells and basophils. 5-Aminosalicylic acid also inhibited production of prostaglandin D2 by the stimulated intestinal mast cells. Sulfasalazine alone, without immunologic stimulation, did not induce histamine release from mast cells or basophils, but the enhancement of ongoing mast cell activation by sulfasalazine may explain some cases of adverse reactions to the drug. The inhibition of mast cell histamine release and prostaglandin generation by 5-aminosalicylic acid demonstrates a potential therapeutic modality of this agent. 
2	Somatostatin prevents acute pancreatitis after pancreatic duct sphincter hydrostatic balloon dilation in patients with idiopathic recurrent pancreatitis. The purpose of this study was to determine whether prophylactic somatostatin infusion can prevent pancreatitis after hydrostatic balloon dilation of the pancreatic duct sphincter segment in 16 patients with idiopathic recurrent pancreatitis. This study demonstrated that prophylactic administration of somatostatin before, during, and after the procedure diminished the incidence and severity of acute pancreatitis. We recommend consideration of such prophylaxis in patients undergoing this procedure. 
4	Evidence for decreased coronary flow reserve in viable postischemic myocardium. To try to unravel the complexity and heterogeneity of the "no-reflow" phenomenon and its underlying mechanisms, we studied tissue perfusion in reperfused heart muscle by using tracer microspheres in an anesthetized dog model of 90-minute coronary occlusion followed by reperfusion for 2 1/2 hours, 24 hours, or 1 week. Regional myocardial blood flow was determined both in basal flow conditions and during reactive hyperemia. The effect of intracoronary adenosine administration was examined, and the ultrastructure of postischemic myocardium was analyzed. In viable reperfused tissue (as delineated by triphenyltetrazolium chloride staining), reflow in basal conditions is unimpaired. Coronary flow reserve (as approximated by peak reactive hyperemic flow) is intact at the start of reperfusion, decreases by more than half after 2 1/2 hours, and recovers completely within 1 week. This impairment of coronary reserve can be relieved by intracoronary adenosine administration. On ultrastructural examination, the capillaries are patent. On the other hand, in irreversibly damaged myocardium, both the basal reflow impairment and the decrease in coronary flow reserve are severe and permanent. Coronary flow reserve is already decreased at the start of reperfusion, and the pharmacological intervention has no beneficial effect. Ultrastructurally, extracellular and intracellular edema invariably are present, whereas the vascular endothelium is damaged and the capillaries are packed with red blood cells. We conclude that the no-reflow phenomenon (i.e., mechanical obstruction to blood flow) is limited to infarcted tissue. In viable myocardium, however, coronary flow reserve is transiently diminished, probably because of washout and subsequent insufficient availability of the chemical mediator adenosine after breakdown and slow recovery of the precursor ATP pool. 
4	Prevention of renal disease and conservation of renal function. In summary, we have reviewed some of the most frequently encountered areas of prevention of renal failure in the elderly. They include obstruction, hypertension, drug interaction, and inappropriate use of drugs and the silent killer of the elderly, renal carcinoma. Only by a thorough understanding of the altered physiology of the aging kidney can the physician avoid making the same mistakes when new drugs are developed or new types of diseases are encountered. Proper early diagnosis and understanding the guidelines to therapy in these conditions, can save huge human costs in terms of mortality, morbidity, and money. 
4	Greenfield filter as primary therapy for deep venous thrombosis and/or pulmonary embolism in patients with cancer. In 1985, as a result of the high complication rate associated with anticoagulants in patients who have cancer and deep venous thrombosis (DVT) and/or pulmonary embolism (PE), we established a policy of placing Greenfield filters (GFs) as primary therapy instead of anticoagulation. Since 1985 we have been asked to consult in the treatment of 18 patients with cancer and with DVT and/or PE, and we have placed a GF in each of these patients. This represented 34% (18/53) of the filters placed during that same period. Over the same 4-year period, 11 patients with cancer and DVT and/or PE underwent anticoagulation therapy. The purpose of this study was to compare the results of anticoagulation versus GF insertion in these two groups of patients. A significantly higher number of major complications (n = 4) occurred in the anticoagulation group (p less than 0.05, Fisher's exact test) than in the GF group (n = 0). The four complications that occurred in the anticoagulation group included three bleeding episodes (tumor bleeding, gastrointestinal bleeding, and hip hematoma) and one PE, despite adequate anticoagulation. Two patients died as a direct result of these complications (PE and gastrointestinal bleeding). The three patients with bleeding complications each required a transfusion of more than 3 units of blood. All four of the patients with complications had metastatic disease (pancreatic carcinoma, chronic lymphocytic leukemia, prostate carcinoma, and uterine carcinoma). Although this is a small, nonrandomized, nonprospective study, the data seem to indicate that GF placement is safer than anticoagulation for DVT or PE in patients with cancer and particularly in patients with metastatic disease. We conclude that GF insertions may be a better primary treatment than anticoagulation. 
3	Perception and action in 'visual form agnosia'. A single case study of a patient with 'visual form agnosia' is presented. A severe visual recognition deficit was accompanied by impairments in discriminating shape, reflectance, and orientation, although visual acuity and colour vision, along with tactile recognition and intelligence, were largely preserved. Neuropsychological and behavioural investigations have indicated that the patient is able to utilize visual pattern information surprisingly well for the control of hand movements during reaching, and can even read many whole words, despite being unable to make simple discriminative judgements of shape or orientation. She seems to have no awareness of shape primitives through Gestalt grouping by similarity, continuity or symmetry. It is proposed that many of these perceptual disorders might be the combined result of (1) a selective loss of the cortical elaboration of the magnocellular visual processing stream, and (2) a selective output disconnection from a central processor of visual boundaries and shape primitives in the occipital cortex. 
1	"Pinch modification" used to repair a large surgical defect on the scalp: other proposed uses. Dr Peng's "pinch modification" of the linear advancement flap, a reconstructive technique used to correct surgical wounds on the nose and suggested as a surgical alternative in other non-hair-bearing skin, was used successfully to correct a surgical defect of 55 mm in diameter located on the occipital area, on hair-bearing skin. Other possible uses for this technique are suggested. 
1	Treatment planning for internal radionuclide therapy: three-dimensional dosimetry for nonuniformly distributed radionuclides. A calculational approach is described that provides the spatially varying radiation absorbed dose, presented as isodose contours superimposed on CT images, from nonuniform and/or irregular cumulated activity distributions. CT images are read from magnetic tape and are displayed on a high-resolution color graphics display monitor. Source tissue geometries are defined on a series of contiguous CT images automatically (by an edge detection algorithm) or manually (using a trackball), thereby obtaining a three-dimensional representation of the various source volumes of activity. Dose calculations are performed using a radionuclide-specific absorbed dose point kernel in the form of a lookup table. The method described yields the spatially varying dose delivered to tumor and normal tissue volumes from a patient-specific cumulated activity distribution in a clinically implementable manner. This level of accuracy in determining normal tissue and tumor doses may prove valuable in the evaluation and implementation of radionuclides and radiolabeled compounds for therapeutic purposes. 
2	Isolated ventral pancreatitis in a patient with pancreas divisum. A previously healthy 22-yr-old woman was found to have chronic pancreatitis restricted to the ventral pancreas in association with pancreas divisum. When conservative treatment failed, sphincteroplasty of both papillae was performed with good results. This well-documented case represents a clear exception to the commonly held concept that obstruction of the dorsal duct is the essential pathogenic factor in the development of pancreatitis associated with pancreas divisum. The importance of visualizing both the dorsal and ventral pancreatic ducts to direct therapy for patients with idiopathic pancreatitis is discussed. Theories of the pathogenesis of concomitant pancreatitis and pancreas divisum are reviewed. 
4	Pulmonary hypertension after heparin-protamine: roles of left-sided infusion, histamine, and platelet-activating factor. Severe pulmonary hypertension after protamine neutralization of heparin is an infrequent but life-threatening event following cardiopulmonary bypass. The effect of left ventricular infusion of protamine on pulmonary hypertension as well as a possible role of platelet-activating factor (PAF) or histamine in the heparin-protamine reaction was investigated in 30 pigs in four different groups during general anesthesia. Group 1 animals received 250 IU/kg heparin, followed by 100 mg protamine intravenously after 15 min. In group 2 protamine was infused into the left ventricle. Group 3 animals received the histamine H1- and H2-antagonists clemastine and ranitidine 5 min before protamine infusion. In group 4 the PAF receptor blocker WEB 2086 was given 5 min before protamine. Platelet-activating factor was measured by a bioassay in serum samples of group 1 and group 4 animals. In all four groups protamine caused severe pulmonary hypertension, thromboxane A2 release, and a transient decrease in leukocyte counts. No PAF release was detected after protamine infusion. Neither left ventricular infusion of protamine nor histamine or PAF antagonists prevented or attenuated the reactions after protamine infusion. The authors conclude that left ventricular infusion of protamine provides no protection from pulmonary hypertension, and that histamine and PAF are not involved in the acute pulmonary vasoconstriction after protamine neutralization of heparin. 
3	Litigation and employment status: effects on patients with chronic pain. In order to study the effects of compensation and litigation, 201 chronic pain patients were selected from a sample of 444: 99 were working, 15 were working and litigating, 53 were receiving Worker's Compensation, and 34 were receiving Worker's Compensation and litigating. Employment (working vs. Worker's Compensation) and litigation status (litigating vs. not litigating) were analyzed in a 2 x 2 factorial design with measures of pain, disability, psychological distress, and selected demographics as dependent variables. Compared to Worker's Compensation patients, working patients reported significantly less disability (down-time, days spent in bed, interference of pain in daily activities) and pain of a longer duration. Compared to litigating patients, non-litigating patients reported less pain (on the McGill Pain Questionnaire) and less disability (stopping activity, interference of pain in daily activities). On two measures of psychological distress (depression, anxiety), there were significant interactions: Worker's Compensation patients who were litigating reported less distress than non-litigants, while working patients who were litigating reported more distress than non-litigants. The results indicate clear differences in self-reports of disability associated with both employment and litigation status. They also suggest that litigation may function as a coping response for patients who are distressed by the adversarial nature of the Worker's Compensation system. Limitations of the study as well as suggestions for further research also are discussed. 
1	Embryonic stem cell virus, a recombinant murine retrovirus with expression in embryonic stem cells. The expression of Moloney murine leukemia virus and vectors derived from it is restricted in undifferentiated mouse embryonal carcinoma and embryonal stem (ES) cells. We have developed a retroviral vector, the murine embryonic stem cell virus (MESV), that is active in embryonal carcinoma and ES cells. MESV was derived from a retroviral mutant [PCC4-cell-passaged myeloproliferative sarcoma virus (PCMV)] expressed in embryonal carcinoma cells but not in ES cells. The enhancer region of PCMV was shown to be functional in both cell types, but sequences within the 5' untranslated region of PCMV were found to restrict viral expression in ES cells. Replacement of this region by related sequences obtained from the dl-587rev retrovirus results in MESV, a modified PCMV virus that confers G418 resistance to fibroblasts and ES cells with similar efficiencies. Expression of MESV in ES cells is mediated by transcriptional regulatory elements within the 5' long terminal repeat of the viral genome. 
5	Computerized tomography in acute gastrointestinal disorders. In recent years, computerized tomography (CT) has become one of the most important imaging modalities in evaluation of patients with acute gastrointestinal disorders. Its role, diagnostic accuracy, indications, and limitations in some of the most commonly encountered acute abdominal conditions are succinctly presented and reviewed. CT should not be used indiscriminantly, but is best considered a valuable primary or complimentary diagnostic tool in critically ill patients. Its selective use in a variety of emergency abdominal diseases will significantly improve accuracy of clinical diagnoses, leading to a prompt and adequate medical or surgical management. 
5	Molecular and hematologic characterization of Scottish-Irish type (epsilon gamma delta beta)zero thalassemia. The DNA deletion associated with an example of (epsilon gamma delta beta)zero thalassemia (Scottish-Irish type) was characterized. The deletion is approximately 205 kb in length and involves the epsilon, G gamma, A gamma, delta, and beta globin genes. The breakpoint is located 263 bp 3' to exon 3 of the beta globin gene. An LI (KpnI) repeat element approximately 320 bp in size is found at the 3' end of the novel DNA sequence. Different clinical phenotypes for three heterozygous neonates suggest that the deletion alone does not predict severity of (epsilon gamma delta beta)zero thalassemia at this age. 
3	The molecular biology of occlusive stroke in childhood. It is very likely that many of the same factors involved in occlusive disease in the adult are operative in the child. The major difference may be in the factors that damage endothelium in these two age groups and thereby initiate this catastrophe (atherosclerosis versus "other" causes of endothelial changes). Our task in this next decade is the rational exploration of the effects of endothelium-mediated kinins, endothelial secretory products, angiospasm, platelet aggregration, prostaglandins, and lipoproteins on pediatric stroke. 
5	The pathophysiology of anoxic injury in central nervous system white matter. White matter of the mammalian brain is susceptible to anoxic injury, but little is known about the pathophysiology of this process. We studied the mechanisms of anoxic injury in white matter using the isolated rat optic nerve, a typical central nervous system white-matter tract. Optic nerve function, measured as the area under the compound action potential, rapidly failed when exposed to anoxia. Postanoxic recovery was variable, depending on duration of the anoxic insult; after a standard 60-minute period of anoxia, the compound action potential recovered to 28.5% of control. Irreversible anoxic injury was critically dependent on extracellular Ca2+; maintaining the tissue in zero [Ca2+] solution throughout the anoxic period resulted in 100% compound action potential recovery. Increasing perfusate [Ca2+] during anoxia from zero to 4 mM resulted in progressively less recovery. Anoxic damage to the optic nerve appears to depend on the gradual accumulation (over tens of minutes) of Ca2+ in a cytoplasmic compartment. The inorganic Ca2+ channel blockers Mn2+ (1 mM), Co2+ (1 mM), or La3+ (0.1 mM) had no effect on recovery of the compound action potential after anoxia; only Mg2+ (10 mM) significantly improved recovery. Treatment with the dihydropyridine Ca2+ channel blockers nifedipine (1-10 microM) or nimodipine (1-40 microM) also had no effect on recovery from anoxia. Thus, Ca2+ influx during anoxia does not occur via conventional Ca2+ channels. Preliminary evidence suggests that this Ca2+ influx may occur via other cation channels that are imperfectly selective for Ca2+ or via the Na(+)-Ca2+ exchanger. 
1	Phase I clinical and pharmacokinetic trial of flavone acetic acid. Flavone acetic acid is a synthetic benzopyrone derivative with an unknown mechanism of action. Thirty-eight patients (30 men and 8 women) were treated once a week for 4 weeks every 5 weeks with doses of flavone acetic acid ranging from 0.33 to 12.5 g/m2. At doses less than or equal to 3.9 g/m2, the drug was administered intravenously over 1 hour; at doses greater than or equal to 5.28 g/m2, the infusion period was lengthened to 6 hours. Treatment of all patients included hydration before and after treatment and alkalization to maintain urine pH at greater than or equal to 6.5. A dose-limiting toxic effect was hypotension at 10 g/m2. Pharmacokinetic studies revealed linear behavior in the eight patients studied, beginning at 3.9 g/m2. Peak plasma levels ranged from 125 to 630 micrograms/mL, with a mean terminal half-life of 22.4 hours. Immunologic monitoring was performed in three patients at 10 g/m2. A transient increase in CD16- and/or Leu-19-positive cells was noted in all three patients. In one patient, this increase correlated with a 10-fold increase in K562 cell killing. There were no objective tumor responses seen in this trial. The recommended phase II dose on this schedule is 8 g/m2. Further studies to elucidate the drug's mechanism of action and to define its immunologic properties are recommended. 
5	Similar time course of ST depression during and after exercise in patients with coronary artery disease and syndrome X. To assess whether the time course of ST segment depression differs in patients with coronary artery disease and patients with angina and normal coronary arteries, the exercise tests of 54 patients with documented coronary artery disease and 25 patients with syndrome X (angina, positive exercise test, no evidence of coronary artery spasm, and normal coronary arteries) were compared. All tests were performed with therapy withheld, using the modified Bruce protocol. In each test, time, heart rate and blood pressure were measured at the onset and at 1 mm of ST segment depression, and at peak exercise. Recovery (return of the ST segment to baseline +/- 0.2 mm) time was also assessed. Peak ST segment depression was similar in coronary artery disease and syndrome X patients (1.5 +/- 0.3 versus 1.6 +/- 0.4 mm). In 42 coronary artery disease patients, ST segment depression developed early (less than or equal to 6 minutes) during exercise; this was associated with a short recovery (less than or equal to 3 minutes) in 17 (40%) and with a long recovery (greater than 3 minutes) in 25 (60%) patients. In 17 patients with syndrome X, ST segment depression developed early; it was associated with a short recovery in six (35%) and with a long recovery in 11 (65%) patients. Late (greater than 6 minutes) onset of ST segment depression was observed in 12 coronary artery disease patients; of these, eight (67%) had a short recovery and 4 (33%) had a long recovery. Late onset of ST segment depression occurred in eight patients with syndrome X; six (75%) had a short recovery and two (25%) had a long recovery. 
5	Treatment of patients with isolated axillary nodal metastases from an occult primary carcinoma consistent with breast origin. The records of 42 patients who had axillary metastases compatible with a clinically occult breast primary were reviewed. Forty patients had mammography performed as part of their evaluations. Mastectomy yielded the primary tumor in one of 13 patients; biopsy yielded positive results in one of five. Among the 29 patients who did not undergo mastectomy, 16 received breast irradiation, and 13 were simply observed for signs of the primary tumor. For the patients who did not undergo mastectomy, the 5-year actuarial risk for appearance of a primary was 17% in the irradiated group versus 57% in the nonirradiated group (P = 0.06). Patterns of failure are correlated with stage and local and systemic therapy. The results affirm our belief that patients with axillary metastases histologically consistent with breast tumor should be treated identically to patients with similar nodal stages and proven breast primaries. 
1	Regional and systemic distribution of anti-tumor x anti-CD3 heteroaggregate antibodies and cultured human peripheral blood lymphocytes in a human colon cancer xenograft. Anti-tumor antibody (317G5) covalently coupled to an anti-CD3 antibody (OKT3) produces a heteroaggregate (HA) antibody that can target PBL to lyse tumor cells expressing the appropriate tumor Ag. The i.v. and i.p. distribution of radiolabeled HA antibody 317G5 x OKT3 and of radiolabeled cultured human PBL were studied in athymic nude mice bearing solid intraperitoneal tumor established from the human colon tumor line, LS174T. Mice were injected with 125I-labeled HA antibody, 125I-labeled anti-tumor mAb, or 111In-labeled PBL, and at designated timepoints tissues were harvested and measured for radioactivity. 125I-317G5 x OKT3 localized specifically to tumor sites. Tumor radioactivity levels (percent injected dose/gram) were lower with 125I-317G5 x OKT3 HA antibody than with 125I-317G5 anti-tumor mAb, but were similar to levels reported for other anti-tumor mAb. The major difference in radioactivity levels observed between i.v. and i.p. administration of 125I-317G5 x OKT3 was an increase in hepatic radioactivity after i.v. HA antibody administration. HA antibodies produced from F(ab')2 fragments, which exhibit decreased m. w. and decreased Fc receptor-mediated binding, demonstrated improved tumor:tissue ratios as compared to intact antibody HA. 125I-317G5 F(ab')2 x OKT3 F(ab')2 antibody levels were equivalent to intact HA antibody levels in tumor, but were lower than intact HA antibody levels in the blood, bowel, and liver. Tumor:bowel ratios (20:1 at 48 h) were highest when 317G5 F(ab')2 x OKT3 F(ab')2 was injected i.p. Autoradiography confirmed that anti-tumor x anti-CD3 HA antibodies localized specifically to intraperitoneal tumor; that i.p. administered HA antibodies penetrated tumor directly; and that i.v. administered HA antibodies distributed along tumor vasculature. Cultured human PBL distributed in moderate concentrations to intraperitoneal tumor when administered i.p., but not when administered i.v. The poor localization of i.v. injected PBL to tumor may reflect species disparity in homing receptors and/or endothelial ligands, a problem which may be overcome with a syngeneic model. These results suggest that regional therapy with HA antibodies and PBL may offer advantages over systemic therapy for initial clinical trials. 
4	Prolonged anginal perceptual threshold in diabetes: effects on exercise capacity and myocardial ischemia. Anginal perceptual threshold (the time from onset of 0.1 mV of ST segment depression to onset of angina during treadmill exercise) is prolonged in diabetic patients with coronary artery disease. In the present study, the functional significance of this perceptual abnormality was evaluated by analysis of its effect on exercise capacity and the severity of myocardial ischemia. Treadmill exercise in 32 diabetic patients and 36 nondiabetic control patients showed a close linear correlation between the time to onset of electrical ischemia (ST segment depression) and exercise capacity in both groups (r = 0.8 and 0.9, respectively; p less than 0.001). However, the slope of the relation was flatter in the diabetic group because prolongation of the anginal perceptual threshold permitted continued exercise as ischemia intensified. The anginal perceptual threshold itself showed a close linear correlation with exercise capacity in the diabetic group (r = 0.8, p less than 0.001), although in the nondiabetic group these variables were unrelated. The permissive effect of a prolonged anginal perceptual threshold on exercise capacity is undesirable as reflected by its correlation with ischemia at peak exercise (r = 0.6, p less than 0.001): the longer the threshold, the greater the exercise capacity and the more severe the ischemia. Indeed, the inverse relation between the severity of ischemia at peak exercise and exercise capacity in the nondiabetic group (r = 0.4, p less than 0.02) was completely lost in the diabetic group. Thus, in diabetic patients with coronary artery disease, anginal perceptual threshold is a major determinant of exercise capacity. 
4	Timing and mechanism of in-hospital and late death after primary coronary angioplasty during acute myocardial infarction. The effect of early myocardial reperfusion on patterns of death after acute myocardial infarction (AMI) is unknown. Thus, the mechanism and timing of in-hospital and late deaths among a group of 614 patients treated with coronary angioplasty without antecedent thrombolytic therapy for AMI were determined. Death occurred in 49 patients (8%) before hospital discharge. Four patients died in the catheterization laboratory. Death was due to cardiogenic shock in 22 patients, acute vessel reclosure in 5 patients, was sudden in 8 patients and followed elective coronary artery bypass surgery in 8 patients. Cardiac rupture was observed in only 2 patients after failed infarct angioplasty, and did not occur among the 574 patients with successful infarct reperfusion. Intracranial hemorrhage did not occur. Multivariate predictors of in-hospital death included failed infarct angioplasty, cardiogenic shock, 3-vessel coronary artery disease and age greater than or equal to 70 years. During a follow-up period of 32 +/- 21 months (range 1 to 87), 55 patients died. The cause of death was cardiac in 36 patients, including an arrhythmic death in 23 patients and was due to circulatory failure in 13 others. One patient died of reinfarction due to late reclosure of the infarct artery. Actuarial survival curves demonstrated overall survival after hospital discharge of 95 and 87% at 1 and 4 years, respectively. Freedom from cardiac death at 1 and 4 years was 96 and 92%. Multivariate predictors of late death included 3-vessel disease, a baseline ejection fraction of less than or equal to 40%, age greater than 70 years and female gender. 
1	Medical comorbidity of major depressive disorder in a primary medical practice. Despite much speculation about the relationship between depression and medical comorbidity in primary care settings, few investigators have examined this issue empirically. Using a two-stage screening procedure, we assessed 618 patients aged 18 to 64 years in an academic general medicine clinic. Forty-one patients (6.6%) suffered from a current episode of major depressive disorder (MDD). We compared this group with a 20% random sample of nondepressed patients. While patients with MDD were younger (mean age, 41.1 vs 47.2 years), they were assessed by the Duke University Severity of Illness Scale as having more severe medical illness. Patients with MDD were more likely to have malignant tumors and "ill-defined conditions" than nondepressed patients. The 18 patients with MDD (44%) who were correctly diagnosed by their physicians had less severe medical illness than those whose depression was clinically undetected. A logistic regression model predicting MDD group membership included female gender, younger age, higher Duke University Severity of Illness Scale score, and more frequent inactive ill-defined diagnoses. These findings are consistent with assertions: (1) patients with MDD have more physical illness than nondepressed patients and/or (2) somatic symptoms and disability caused by MDD add to the burden of physical illness. 
2	Motility changes in primary achalasia following pneumatic dilatation. The changes in esophageal motility after pneumatic dilatation were evaluated prospectively in 51 patients with achalasia. The patients were evaluated for a median of 14 months. Pneumatic dilatation led to a clinical improvement in 41 patients. On manometric evaluation, a significant decrease in lower esophageal sphincter pressure was observed (28.4 +/- 14.9 mmHg vs. 13.5 +/- 7.2 mmHg; p = 0.001); the resting pressure of the esophageal body dropped from 4.8 +/- 4.2 mmHg above gastric baseline to 0.1 +/- 3.9 mmHg below gastric baseline. After therapy, peristaltic activity was present in 10/51 (20%) patients; in 1 case, complete relaxation of the lower esophageal sphincter was recorded. Treatment-induced motility changes could not be predicted by clinical history or the lower esophageal sphincter pressure before or after therapy. However, the resting pressure of the esophageal body before and after therapy was significantly lower in these patients in whom peristalsis recurred after therapy than in patients with an unchanged motility pattern. The reappearance of peristaltic activity after pneumatic dilatation was unrelated to lower esophageal sphincter pressure. In conclusion, motility disturbances of the esophageal body in patients with achalasia do not simply reflect the functional obstruction of the lower esophageal sphincter. These findings support the hypothesis that achalasia is not a distinct motility disturbance but should be regarded as part of a broad spectrum of different interrelated esophageal motility disorders. 
4	Regression of the left main trunk lesion by steroid administration in Takayasu's aortitis. A 62-year-old man with unstable angina due to severe narrowing of the left main trunk (LMT) was examined. Emergency bypass surgery was performed with an internal mammary artery graft, instead of a saphenous vein graft, because of the thickened, edematous ascending aorta. Postoperative coronary angiography showed the lesion of the LMT markedly regressing. Presumably, this stenotic lesion of the LMT was caused by active aortitis and was partially reversible by steroid administration both during and after surgery. Steroid therapy can be added to the list of treatments for cases of LMT disease associated with Takayasu's aortitis, if signs of active inflammation are present. 
5	Long-term clinical results with the Ionescu-Shiley pericardial xenograft. From 1977 to 1987, 829 Ionescu-Shiley pericardial valves (Shiley, Inc., Irvine, Calif.) were implanted in 766 patients at the University of Ottawa Heart Institute. There were 476 patients who had aortic valve replacement, 234 who had mitral valve replacement, and 44 who had double valve replacement. The standard-profile design was used in 508 patients and the low-profile design in 321 patients. Follow-up was obtained for 97% of patients, with calculation of event-free probabilities. At 10 years the overall probability of freedom from structural failure was 48% +/- 7% after aortic valve replacement, 44% +/- 15% after mitral valve replacement, and 79% +/- 11% after double valve replacement. Although at 5 years the probability of failure was statistically lower with the low-profile design, this favorability was lost by 6 years. Freedom from structural failure was only 47% +/- 7% for the standard-profile valve at 10 years. Thus the probability of freedom from reoperation was only 46% +/- 7% after aortic valve replacement, 39% +/- 6% after mitral valve replacement, and 65% +/- 20% after double valve replacement at 10 years. Thromboembolism occurred in 69 patients, for a predicted freedom from this complication at 10 years of 79% +/- 3% after aortic, 73% +/- 7% after mitral, and 96% +/- 4% after double valve replacement. There were 31 cases of endocarditis. The 10-year predicted freedom from endocarditis, therefore, was 86% +/- 3% after aortic, 98% +/- 1% after mitral, and 97% +/- 1% after double valve replacement. A total of 221 operative and late deaths were recorded in this series. Prosthetic valve failure accounted for 27% of late deaths. The 10-year survival rates were estimated to be 56% +/- 5% (aortic valve replacement), 54% +/- 6% (mitral valve replacement), and 51% +/- 8% (double valve replacement). We concluded that the Ionescu-Shiley pericardial xenograft provides less than optimal clinical performance and its use has been discontinued. 
4	The spectrum of portal vein thrombosis in liver transplantation. Thrombosis of the portal vein with or without patency of its tributaries used to be a contraindication to orthotopic liver transplantation (OLTX) until quite recently. Rapid progress in the surgical technique of OLTX in the last few years has demonstrated that most patients with portal vein thrombosis can be safely and successfully transplanted. Presented here is a series of 34 patients with portal vein thrombosis transplanted at the University of Pittsburgh since 1984. The various techniques used to treat various forms of thrombosis are described. The survival rate for this series was 67.6% (23 of 34 patients). Survival was best for patients who underwent phlebothrombectomy or placement of a jump graft from the superior mesenteric vein. The survival rate also correlated with the amount of blood required for transfusion during surgery. Overall it is concluded that a vast majority of the patients with thrombosis of the portal system can be technically transplanted and that their survival rate is comparable to that of patients with patent portal vein. 
5	Indigenous cases of Lyme disease diagnosed in North Carolina. Between January 1984 and December 1989, 102 indigenous cases of Lyme disease were reported in North Carolina. Lyme disease was reported in each of the three major geographic regions of the state: mountain, piedmont, and coastal plain. One or more diagnoses were made in 42 of 100 counties. Patients ranged in age from 5 months to 78 years (median, 27 years); 58 patients (57%) reported a history of tick exposure within 1 month of the onset of symptoms. Erythema migrans was reported by 93 patients (91%). Arthritis (30%), neurologic symptoms (10%), and cardiac abnormalities (7%) were observed. Thirty of the 102 cases were confirmed serologically by indirect fluorescence microscopy or enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. 
2	Alanine aminotransferase in clinical practice. A review. Alanine aminotransferase is an enzyme produced mainly in the liver. When serum activity is measured, it provides a marker of hepatic disease. This review explores the biochemistry and laboratory analysis of alanine aminotransferase in terms of its significance in human health and disease. Cut-off levels that define abnormality are rather arbitrary and this decreases the specificity of the test in apparently healthy patients. A small, but important, group of patients with alanine aminotransferase abnormality have underlying liver disease that may be treatable. Most can be diagnosed based on history, physical examination, and biochemical-serological profiles. Liver biopsy can complement the diagnostic process in selected circumstances. Literature pertaining to this is critically reviewed. 
4	Left ventricular diastolic dysfunction limits use of maximum systolic elastance as an index of contractile function. We tested the hypothesis that maximum systolic elastance (Emax) fails to detect a decline in left ventricular (LV) contractile function when diastolic dysfunction is present. Canine hearts were studied in an isolated blood-perfused heart apparatus (isovolumic LV); contractile dysfunction was produced by 60 or 90 minutes of global ischemia, followed by 90 minutes of reperfusion. Nine normal hearts underwent 60 minutes of ischemia, and five underwent 90 minutes of ischemia. After the ischemia-reperfusion sequence, developed pressure, pressure-volume area, and myocardial ATP level were significantly less than those at baseline in all 14 hearts. In the group undergoing 60 minutes of ischemia, LV diastolic pressure did not increase, whereas Emax decreased from 5.2 +/- 2.5 to 2.9 +/- 1.4 mm Hg/ml (p less than 0.05). In the group undergoing 90 minutes of ischemia, diastolic pressure increased (from 10 +/- 2 to 37 +/- 20 mm Hg, p less than 0.05), and Emax did not change significantly (from 5.1 +/- 4.3 to 4.3 +/- 2.5 mm Hg/ml). A second series of experiments was performed in 13 hearts with pressure-overload hypertrophy (aortic-band model with echocardiography and catheterization studies before the ischemia-reperfusion protocol). Five had evidence for pump failure, whereas eight remained compensated. After 60 minutes of ischemia and 90 minutes of reperfusion, developed pressure, pressure-volume area, and myocardial ATP level were significantly less than those at baseline in all 13 hearts. In the group with compensated LV hypertrophy, LV diastolic pressure did not change, whereas Emax decreased from 6.9 +/- 3.0 to 3.1 +/- 2.3 mm Hg/ml (p less than 0.05). 
4	Coronary angioplasty in young adults: initial results and late outcome. The initial and late outcome of coronary angioplasty was studied in 148 patients less than 40 years of age (mean 36.4 +/- 3). Angioplasty was performed on a single vessel in 70% of patients and on multiple vessels in 30%; it was performed on a totally occluded vessel in 20%. Angioplasty was successful in 90.5% of patients, unsuccessful but uncomplicated in 7.4% and complicated by myocardial infarction in 0.7%, emergency bypass surgery in 0.7% and death in 0.7%. At late (mean 3.7 +/- 3 years; range 0.5 to 11.5) follow-up study after successful angioplasty, 94% of patients were alive, 79% were free of angina and 85% had returned to work; late myocardial infarction occurred in 4%. Actuarial survival at 5 years was 95%, and 85% of patients were free from death, infarction or bypass surgery. A second angioplasty was performed in 29 patients (22%) (mean 6.1 +/- 8.4 months) and was successful in 27 (93%), with no deaths. Elective coronary bypass surgery was performed in 8.5% of patients, with perioperative infarction in 9% and no deaths. By univariate analysis, late death was more likely to occur in hypertensive patients (15% versus 2.5%; p less than 0.01) and diabetic patients (21.4% versus 3.6%; p less than 0.01). Cox proportional hazard regression analysis identified hypertension (p = 0.007) and diabetes (p = 0.04) as independent time-related predictors of subsequent death. Thus, early and late results after coronary angioplasty in young adults are favorable, but certain risk factors are important predictors of outcome. Late revascularization procedures (repeat angioplasty or surgery) for restenosis or disease progression are common. 
3	Grading white matter lesions on CT and MRI: a simple scale. We developed and tested a simple three-point scale for grading white matter lesions in anterior and posterior regions of the brain. Twenty four CT scans and 24 MRI scans were separately judged by 11 and five observers, respectively, on the presence and severity of white matter lesions. The observers were radiologists and neurologists. For CT scans, these periventricular changes were graded according to their extent as absent, or partly involving the white matter, or extending up to the subcortical region. The MRI lesions were graded as no lesion or only a single one, multiple focal lesions, and multiple confluent lesions. The pairwise agreements of all possible combinations of observers for each scan were corrected for chance (kappa statistics; maximal agreement 1.0). The weighted kappa value, for anterior and posterior regions combined, was 0.63 for CT scans, and 0.78 for MRI scans. This three-point scale for two separate regions seems suitable as a basis for cross-sectional or longitudinal studies of large series of patients. 
1	Nitrite from inflammatory cells--a cancer risk factor in ulcerative colitis? Elevated levels of luminal nitrite and a lowered luminal pH were found in 77 percent of patients with acute ulcerative colitis. No luminal nitrite was found in healthy control subjects. Nitrites are a secretory product of activated macrophages and neutrophils of the lamina propria, whereas the lowered luminal pH is due to diminished bicarbonate formation by impaired colonocytes. A hypothesis is put forward that nitrites, lowered pH, and bacterial amines are conducive to formation of carcinogenic n-nitroso compounds, which reflect a cancer risk in patients with ulcerative colitis dependent on the type and extent of inflammatory cell activation as well as metabolic impairment of colonic epithelial cells. 
4	Doxazosin therapy in the treatment of diabetic hypertension. The incidence of cardiovascular disease in non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM) has not been reduced by the control of hyperglycemia alone. Hypertension and dyslipidemia may be the major determinants of macrovascular disease in these patients. With the high prevalence of hypertension in NIDDM, antihypertensive drugs are likely to be important determinants of an atherogenic lipid profile. To date, there is no completed major randomized controlled trial of antihypertensive treatment outcome in a diabetic population, and as such, drug choice for the treatment of diabetic hypertension is often based on evidence extrapolated from studies in nondiabetic groups. However, two short-term studies have assessed the effects of doxazosin antihypertensive therapy in subjects with NIDDM. Both studies showed that the significant reduction in blood pressure with doxazosin treatment was associated with favorable effects on the serum lipid profile. In one study, contrasting adverse effects of atenolol treatment on glycemic control, lipids, and lipoproteins were observed. Doxazosin therapy was associated with a trend toward correcting the disturbances of lipoprotein metabolism characteristic of NIDDM. These metabolic effects, combined with effective lowering of blood pressure by doxazosin, may be important determinants of cardiovascular disease in the long term. 
4	Dietary sodium reduction for hypertension prevention and treatment. Nutritional-nonpharmacological approaches for the treatment and prevention of hypertension are of great interest. Sodium reduction is one of the primary methods recommended for these purposes. The general public is interested in the reduction of dietary sodium intake and has responded with a decrease in table salt use, the purchase of lowered sodium food products, and the use of food labels to help guide food purchases. Countervailing trends in the use of convenience foods and dining out increase the difficulty for individuals to lower sodium intake. Clinical trials that have used sodium reduction alone or in combination with other lifestyle therapies have demonstrated the feasibility of reducing dietary sodium intake from 30% to 50% for up to 4 years, in a variety of populations. Trials that used lifestyle and weight loss interventions have also achieved significant reductions in body weight and alcohol consumption and increases in physical activity. A variety of studies indicate that long-term sodium reduction is feasible and that it is acceptable to patients. No negative consequences of these interventions have been observed, and in some cases improvement in the intake of other nutrients has occurred. Nonpharmacological interventions have resulted in hypertension control in significant proportions of the trial populations. These studies demonstrate that the foregoing types of interventions can significantly contribute to hypertension treatment and prevention. 
3	Frontal impairment and hypoperfusion in neuroacanthocytosis. Cerebral blood flow tomography, by xenon 133 inhalation or HMPAO (99mTc-d, l-hexamethyl-propylene amine oxime) technetium Tc 99m injection, revealed a severe hypoperfusion in both frontal lobes of a 40-year-old woman with confirmed neuroacanthocytosis. This finding occurred in conjunction with neuropsychological deficits consistent with selective frontal lobe dysfunction. This observation is the first documentation of this type of dementia in neuroacanthocytosis. 
1	Comparison of myelography with CT follow-up versus gadolinium MRI for subarachnoid metastatic disease in children. We evaluated 17 children with primary intracranial neoplasms for subarachnoid metastatic disease (SAMD) using myelography with computed tomographic follow-up (Myelo + CT) and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) histopathologic examination, as well as magnetic resonance imaging with gadolinium DTPA (MRI + Gd), between December 1988 and December 1989. There were 12 boys, and the median age was 5.7 years (range, 0.8 to 21.8 years). Tumor histology included 8 primitive neuroectodermal tumors (PNETs), 3 ependymomas, 2 low-grade astrocytomas, 1 anaplastic astrocytoma, 1 glioblastoma multiforme, 1 atypical rhabdoid tumor, and 1 malignant fibrous histiocytoma. Thirteen tumors originated in the posterior fossa, 2 were supratentorial, and 2 were in the spinal cord. The median interval between the 2 diagnostic tests was 2 days. MRI + Gd was positive in 11 (65%), Myelo + CT in 8 (47%), and CSF in 5 (29%) cases. MRI + Gd was superior in delineating spinal cord nodules and "sugar coating" whereas Myelo + CT more readily revealed nerve root sleeve filling defects. There was no case in which Myelo + CT was positive that MRI + Gd did not reveal SAMD. MRI + Gd is a safe, noninvasive test that should be used as the initial imaging modality for the presence of SAMD. 
1	Benign parotid tumour enucleation--a reliable operation in selected cases. The method of surgical treatment for benign tumours of the parotid gland had not yet been rationalized, but many authors recommend parotidectomy as the most appropriate procedure. A series of 289 operations for parotid swelling is reported; the majority of mixed and Warthin's tumours underwent enucleation without either complications or recurrence. The rationale of parotidectomy versus enucleation is discussed but in fast growing, deeply infiltrating and recurrent tumours, parotidectomy appears to be the best choice. In the other group of more commonly occurring tumours, enucleation represents a reliable time saving option. 
2	Geographic variation of inflammatory bowel disease within the United States. One approach to learn about possible environmental risks in inflammatory bowel disease relates to studying its geographic pattern of occurrence. The geographic variation of inflammatory bowel disease within the United States was analyzed using the accumulated 17.5 million hospital discharges of all U.S. Medicare beneficiaries during two consecutive years. To validate the geographic pattern shown by the Medicare data, hospitalization was compared with mortality from inflammatory bowel disease among different states. Mortality and hospitalization statistics both suggested that the occurrence of inflammatory bowel disease was determined by environmental factors that had a marked geographic variation within the United States. Both Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis appeared to be more frequent in northern parts of the United States than in southern and in urban more than rural parts. These trends were observed for men and women and for blacks and whites alike. Similar geographic patterns of Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis suggested the influence of one or more identical risk factors for both diseases. 
5	Regional H2O2 concentration in rat brain after hyperoxic convulsions. O2 toxicity of the central nervous system (CNS) may be a result of enhanced generation of reactive O2 species such as superoxide and H2O2 at high PO2. In this study, we measured H2O2 production in six regions of the rat brain before and after convulsions induced by hyperbaric hyperoxia (HBO). H2O2 concentration was determined ex vivo using a method based on the H2O2-dependent decline in catalase activity in the presence of the irreversible inhibitor of compound I, 3-amino-1,2,4-triazole. Regional catalase activity in the brain ranged from 0.029 +/- 0.004 to 0.055 +/- 0.004 mumol O2.min-1.micrograms DNA-1 in cerebellum and medulla-pons, respectively. In the presence of aminotriazole, catalase activity declined after HBO-induced convulsions to 26-45% of normoxic values. The rates of inactivation of catalase were used to predict average steady-state values for H2O2 concentration in different brain structures. Estimated H2O2 concentrations during HBO varied from 31 to 51 pM in cerebellum and posterior subcortex and represented increases of 2.2-7.3 times normoxic values. These findings suggest that H2O2 is an important mediator of selective neuronal vulnerability to CNS O2 toxicity. 
4	Functional status after coronary artery bypass grafting and percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty. Two cohorts of consecutive patients of comparable age with similar preprocedure cardiac function who underwent either coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG; n = 106) or percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA; n = 64) were entered into a prospective comparison study examining functional status and return to work during the first year of recovery. Patients were evaluated using standardized functional status instruments for activities of daily living, work performance, social activity, mental health and quality of social interaction at 1, 6 and 12 months after the procedure. Within the CABG group, statistically significant improvements of functional status on every subscale were noted over the 1-year follow-up. Patients undergoing PTCA demonstrated significant improvement in all dimensions except for the quality of interaction at 1 year as compared with baseline. When the 2 groups were compared, the PTCA group demonstrated greater participation than the CABG group in routine daily physical and social activities at 1 and 6 months, but this apparent advantage disappeared by 1 year. Measures of psychological functioning were better after CABG than after PTCA. A reduction in the number of those with employment occurred in both the CABG and PTCA groups, independent of physical functional status measures, which improved in both groups after the procedures. For those with employment, the CABG group reported the greatest improvement in work performance. 
5	Effects of changes in level and pattern of breathing on the sensation of dyspnea. Breathing during hypercapnia is determined by reflex mechanisms but may also be influenced by respiratory sensations. The present study examined the effects of voluntary changes in level and pattern of breathing on the sensation of dyspnea at a constant level of chemical drive. Studies were carried out in 15 normal male subjects during steady-state hypercapnia at an end-tidal PCO2 of 50 Torr. The intensity of dyspnea was rated on a Borg category scale. In one experiment (n = 8), the level of ventilation was increased or decreased from the spontaneously adopted level (Vspont). In another experiment (n = 9), the minute ventilation was maintained at the level spontaneously adopted at PCO2 of 50 Torr and breathing frequency was increased or decreased from the spontaneously adopted level (fspont) with reciprocal changes in tidal volume. The intensity of dyspnea (expressed as percentage of the spontaneous breathing level) correlated with ventilation (% Vspont) negatively at levels below Vspont (r = -0.70, P less than 0.001) and positively above Vspont (r = 0.80, P less than 0.001). At a constant level of ventilation, the intensity of dyspnea correlated with breathing frequency (% fspont) negatively at levels below fspont (r = -0.69, P less than 0.001) and positively at levels above fspont (r = 0.75, P less than 0.001). These results indicate that dyspnea intensifies when the level or pattern of breathing is voluntarily changed from the spontaneously adopted level. This is consistent with the possibility that ventilatory responses to changes in chemical drive may be regulated in part to minimize the sensations of respiratory effort and discomfort. 
3	Progressive degeneration of the right temporal lobe studied with positron emission tomography. A 79 year old man with a twelve year progressive history of prosopagnosia and recent naming difficulty, in whom other intellectual skills were preserved, is described. Positron emission tomography (PET) revealed an area of right temporal lobe hypometabolism, with an additional area of less severe hypometabolism at the left temporal pole. This may represent an example of progressive focal cortical degeneration similar to that associated with primary progressive dysphasia, but affecting the right temporal lobe. 
4	Increased Ca2+ signaling after alpha-adrenoceptor activation in vascular hypertrophy. In an effort to explain the increased sensitivity to agonists of hypertrophic vascular muscle, intracellular Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]i)-signaling mechanisms were studied in normal and hypertrophic rat aortas from normotensive and coarctation-hypertensive rats. Based on both fura 2 fluorescence and aequorin luminescence measurements, qualitatively different patterns of Ca2+ mobilization occur in normal and hypertrophic rat aortic muscle. Normal rat aortic muscle contracts to phenylephrine with little or no increase in [Ca2+]i, whereas the angiotensin II-induced contraction is accompanied by a marked [Ca2+]i transient. In contrast, hypertrophic rat aortic muscle shows a dramatic increase in Ca2+ signaling after phenylephrine stimulation. Moreover, both the amplitude of the angiotensin-induced [Ca2+]i transient and the contractile sensitivity to this agonist are decreased in the hypertrophic muscle. Our results strongly suggest that the amplitude of the [Ca2+]i transient after agonist stimulation determines the contractile sensitivity and that there is an altered coupling of the alpha-adrenoceptor in the hypertrophic vascular muscle. 
1	Occurrence of beta-hexachlorocyclohexane in breast cancer patients. The residues of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) and neutral organochlorine compounds in breast fat of 44 breast cancer patients and 33 women free of cancer were determined. No statistically significant differences appeared between the two comparison groups with regard to occurrence of PAH compounds. Of the neutral organochlorine compounds, residues of beta-hexachlorocyclohexane (HCH) were found more frequently in breast cancer patients. After adjusting for age and parity by stepwise logistic regression, beta-HCH remained a significant risk factor of breast cancer. Using a cutoff point for the residue level of beta-HCH in breast adipose tissue of more than 0.1 mg/kg fat, the odds ratio was 10.51 (95% CI, 2.00-55.26). 
1	Adenoid cystic carcinoma of the esophagus. A clinicopathologic study of three cases. In a group of 245 cases of primary carcinoma of the esophagus the authors found three cases of adenoid cystic carcinoma (ACC). Clinical and pathologic data of those patients (one female and two male; age range, 49-74 years) were analyzed. Tumors were localized in the middle third of the esophagus. One patient lived 15 months after surgery. Another is a case of early ACC who has been living 4.5 years after surgery and is without specific symptoms. The third patient had not had surgery and died 13 months after the onset of dysphagia. An autopsy showed only a locally invasive tumor growing into the surroundings of the esophagus, and regional lymph node metastases without distant parenchymal metastases. These findings support pathologic and biologic similarities between ACC of the esophagus and ACC of the salivary glands. There are synchronous tumors of the esophagus and the vital localization which makes the prognosis of ACC of the esophagus worse than ACC of the salivary glands. 
4	Penetration of the pericardium by a gastric ulcer--survival after pericardiocentesis. Elderly patients often have unusual manifestations of common illnesses. We describe a geriatric patient having a pneumopericardium from pericardial penetration by a gastric ulcer. Benign gastric ulceration causing perforation of the pericardium or other cardiac structures was recognized as early as 1854; however, until 1964, the condition was invariably fatal. Our patient survived the episode after early pericardiocentesis and medical treatment. Aspects of this uncommon clinical entity and a brief review of the literature are described. 
1	Renal vein leiomyosarcoma. The 11th case of primary leiomyosarcoma of the renal vein is reported. Unique features of this case included concomitant resection of an isolated hepatic metastasis, intraoperative radiation therapy, and the use of electron microscopy and immunohistochemical stains in confirming the diagnosis. A review of the previously reported cases shows a tendency toward slow tumor growth and infrequent recurrence (18%). Metastases are common (82%), primarily to the lung and liver. Aggressive surgical resection and adjuvant radiation therapy, including intraoperative radiation therapy, are recommended. Adjuvant chemotherapy should be considered, although its benefits at present are unclear. 
2	Comparison of omeprazole and cimetidine in reflux oesophagitis: symptomatic, endoscopic, and histological evaluations. Symptomatic patients with endoscopically verified reflux oesophagitis were randomised to a double blind trial in which they received either omeprazole (20 mg once daily) or cimetidine (400 mg four times daily) for four, and if necessary, eight weeks. In an 'intention to treat' analysis, oesophagitis was found to have healed after four weeks in 77 of 137 (56%) in the omeprazole group and in 34 of 133 (26%) in the cimetidine group (p less than 0.001). By eight weeks these values were 71% and 35% respectively; p less than 0.001. Histological assessments were available for 73% of the patients. At entry, 63% (66 of 104) in the omeprazole group and 60% (56 of 94) in the cimetidine group (ns) had abnormal histology. After the study, the proportions of patients who initially had had abnormal histology but who then progressed to normal were 67% (44 of 66: omeprazole) and 48% (27 of 56: cimetidine) respectively (p less than 0.001). All patients had reflux symptoms at entry. After four weeks, 46% in the omeprazole group and 22% (p less than 0.001) in the cimetidine group were asymptomatic. Diary cards completed for the first two weeks showed that patients treated with omeprazole experienced fewer reflux symptoms by day and night and used fewer antacids. Omeprazole, 20 mg once a day for four to eight weeks, healed a greater proportion of patients with reflux oesophagitis than cimetidine, 1.6 g per day, assessed endoscopically and histologically, and relieved more patients' symptoms. 
1	Serous papillary adenocarcinoma of the tunica vaginalis of the testis with metastasis. Testicular or paratesticular neoplasms that resemble the common epithelial type of ovarian tumor are quite rare. The authors report the case of a 29-year-old man with a metastatic serous papillary adenocarcinoma arising from the tunica vaginalis. To the authors' knowledge, this is the first reported case of a serous carcinoma of the tunica vaginalis behaving in a malignant fashion. The fact that clinically apparent metastatic disease occurred 4 years after initial presentation suggests that development of metastases is a late event. Unfortunately, the tumor has been refractory to therapy with chemotherapeutic agents with activity against ovarian malignancies. 
1	Solitary thyroid nodule: a prospective evaluation of nuclear scanning and ultrasonography. The aim of this study was to assess prospectively the value of thyroid nuclear scans and ultrasound examination in the preoperative investigation of patients with a solitary thyroid nodule. Total thyroid lobectomy for a solitary thyroid nodule was performed in 68 cases. Each patient had a thyroid isotope scan (except two women who were pregnant) and thyroid ultrasound examination. There were 10 (15 per cent) malignant nodules, 11 (16 per cent) benign neoplastic nodules and 47 (69 per cent) benign non-neoplastic nodules. All of the patients with malignant nodules who were scanned had a solitary cold nodule on thyroid scan, as did 40 (69 per cent) of those with benign solitary nodules. Ultrasound examination of the thyroid suggested correctly that one of 16 (6 per cent) cystic lesions, four of 16 (25 per cent) complex solid-cystic lesions and three of 18 (17 per cent) of solid lesions were malignant. One lesion reported as multinodular on ultrasonography and one reported as normal also turned out to be malignant. Thyroid isotope scans and ultrasound do not accurately differentiate between benign and malignant conditions and their routine use in the investigation of a solitary thyroid nodule should be abandoned. 
4	Importance of hemodynamic response to therapy in predicting survival with ejection fraction less than or equal to 20% secondary to ischemic or nonischemic dilated cardiomyopathy. To identify patients with left ventricular ejection fractions less than 20% who are likely to survive on tailored medical therapy after referral to transplantation, this study of 152 patients addressed the hypotheses that (1) severely elevated filling pressures initially measured at referral would not necessarily predict poor outcome, (2) survival would be best when low pulmonary wedge pressures could be achieved with therapy tailored for hemodynamic goals, and (3) coronary artery disease would be an independent risk factor for early mortality. Despite an average initial ejection fraction of 0.15, cardiac index of 2.0 liters/min/m2 and pulmonary artery wedge pressure of 28 mm Hg, the actuarial survival with tailored therapy was 63% at 1 year, with 34 of 41 (83%) deaths occurring suddenly. Survival was not related to initial filling pressure elevation, but was best predicted by the pulmonary artery wedge pressures during therapy; patients achieving pressure of less than or equal to 16 mm Hg had 1-year survival of 83 vs 38% (p = 0.0001). The other independent predictors were serum sodium and coronary artery disease. Patients with high filling pressures during therapy and coronary artery disease had 21% survival at 1 year. Survival after referral to transplantation with an ejection fraction less than or equal to 20% is better than previously described. Patients in whom left ventricular filling pressures cannot be adequately reduced by tailored therapy, particularly if coronary artery disease is present, should be considered for early transplantation. 
2	Surgical aspects of sclerosing cholangitis. Results in 178 patients. Of 178 patients with sclerosing cholangitis treated since 1950, 88 patients had associated inflammatory bowel disease, 72 had no such history, and 18 had iatrogenic injury or stone disease. A total of 233 biliary operations were performed, with a 75% rate of temporary improvement after initial operation. Subsequent operations resulted in a lower success rate and a higher mortality rate. Radiologic findings included predominant extrahepatic, intrahepatic, and diffuse disease in 29%, 28%, and 43% of patients, respectively; no survival differences were noted. Seventy-five of one hundred three deaths (73%) were related to liver failure, bleeding, or sepsis. Of 14 patients undergoing portosystemic shunt, 13 died of surgical complications or related disease. Orthotopic liver transplantation was performed in 16 patients and resulted in eight deaths, mainly in patients who had previously undergone extensive surgical treatment. No survival differences were seen between the patients with inflammatory bowel disease, those without the condition, or those who had colectomy. Surgical treatment in patients with sclerosing cholangitis should be minimized. Orthotopic liver transplantation should be offered as the treatment of choice for patients with portal hypertension, refractory cholangitis, advanced cirrhosis, or progressive liver failure. 
4	Studies on the pathogenesis of hypertension in Cushing's disease and acromegaly. The pathogenesis of the hypertension associated with Cushing's syndrome and with acromegaly is poorly understood. We have investigated the possible roles of sodium retention, activation of the renin-angiotensin system and increased sympathetic nervous system activity in untreated patients. In 11 patients with Cushing's disease, seven of whom were hypertensive, total exchangeable sodium was normal despite increased levels of the mineralocorticoid hormones, 11-deoxy-corticosterone and corticosterone. The renin-angiotensin system was also normal. Cardiac sensitivity to the beta-receptor agonist isoprenaline was increased, but this was not due to an increase in beta-adrenoceptor density. Hypertension in Cushing's disease is neither sodium-dependent nor angiotensin II-mediated, but increased cardiac sensitivity to catecholamines, by increasing cardiac output, may contribute to the pathogenesis of hypertension. In nine patients with acromegaly (three of whom were hypertensive) total exchangeable sodium was elevated. Although no correlation between blood pressure and exchangeable sodium was found, hypertension in acromegaly is probably sodium dependent. No evidence was found for a pathogenetic role for either the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone or the sympathetic nervous system. 
2	Endoscopic management of retained cystic duct stones. The finding of residual common bile duct stones after cholecystectomy is a relatively frequently encountered problem for which effective nonoperative therapy exists. Retained stones in a cystic duct remnant are very rare. We present a case of multiple retained stones in a long variant cystic duct remnant following cholecystectomy and common duct exploration, which was successfully managed with endoscopic sphincterotomy and balloon extraction. 
1	Response by women aged 65-79 to invitation for screening for breast cancer by mammography: a pilot study [published erratum appears in BMJ 1991 Jul 27;303(6796):234] OBJECTIVE--To determine whether there is sufficient benefit to be gained by offering screening for breast cancer with mammography to women aged 65-79, who are not normally invited for screening. DESIGN--Pilot study of women eligible for screening but not for personal invitation. The results of this study were compared with the results of routinely screened younger women (aged 50-64) from the same general practice. SETTING--One group general practice in south Manchester. PATIENTS--The 631 women aged 65-79 on the practice list. A total of 42 (7%) were excluded by the general practitioner, and 22 (4%) invitation letters were returned by the post office. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES--Response rates to invitation for screening assessed by three indices: crude population coverage ratio, crude invited population coverage ratio, and corrected invited population coverage ratio. RESULTS--344 Patients aged 65-79 (61% of those invited, excluding those who could not be traced) were screened compared with 77% of women aged 50-64. The three response indices were higher for younger women than older: crude population coverage ratio = 66.5%, crude invited population coverage ratio = 69.3%, corrected invited population coverage ratio = 76.8% for women aged 50-64, compared with 54.5%, 58.4%, and 60.7% respectively for women aged 65-79. All four biopsies done in the older women gave positive results, giving a cancer detection rate of 11.6/1000 compared with 4.1/1000 among younger women. CONCLUSIONS--These results show that there is a potential for high attendance at routine screening by older women if they are invited in the same way as younger women. If these results are found elsewhere the costs and benefits of screening older women should be reassessed. 
2	Visceral protothecosis mimicking sclerosing cholangitis in an immunocompetent host: successful antifungal therapy. A healthy 39-year-old man who had clinical findings consistent with sclerosing cholangitis was found to have systemic protothecosis at surgery. Severe granulomatous inflammation and palpable nodules were found in the gallbladder, on the surface of the liver, and in the duodenum. Prototheca wickerhamii was detected in biopsied specimens and stool; the titer of indirect fluorescent antibody to this organism was 1:2,000. The patient recovered after a short course of treatment with amphotericin B and 3 months of oral therapy with ketoconazole. He had no other concurrent illness and had no abnormality in his immune system. This is the second reported human case of systemic protothecosis. An elevated IgG level, an elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate, eosinophilia, and abnormal levels of enzymes in the liver were found in both cases. Protothecosis should be considered in the differential diagnosis of hepatic and biliary inflammatory diseases of uncertain etiology. 
5	Physician response to notification of acute problems in nursing homes. A frequently cited example of physicians' alleged disinterest in nursing home patients is their failure to respond rapidly or appropriately to telephone calls about acute events or important changes in patient status. This study of 45 SNFs and their 15 attached ICFs evaluated the length of time required to reach physicians by phone about significant clinical changes in patients' conditions and the appropriateness and timeliness of action taken by the physicians once contact was made. Calls on administrative matters, updating of orders, and similar routine calls were excluded. Seven hundred and fifty calls were identified from 24-hour nursing reports; the nature of the problem and the time and details of physicians' responses were recorded from patient charts. Judgment on the quality of physicians' responses was made by consensus of the regional UR committee except in the case of infections where decisions were based on detailed criteria developed in a previous study. The most frequent clinical problems were acute infections (32%), trauma (12%), GI tract disorders (11%), cardiorespiratory problems (10%), neurological disorders (7%), and diabetic control (7%). Results were very encouraging: 96% of physicians' call-backs and actions were judged to be timely, and 87% of physicians' actions taken were judged to be appropriate. However, actions taken were judged inappropriate for certain specific clinical problems, ie, in 22% (54/243) of infections, 24% (4/17) of CVA's, and 12% (6/49) of diabetic control problems. Implications for nursing home care and recommendations for improving the response to acute problems are discussed. 
1	Clinical, radiographic, and pathological features of symptomatic Rathke's cleft cysts. The clinical, radiographic, and pathological findings in 155 patients with symptomatic Rathke's cleft cysts are discussed. Eight patients were treated by the authors and 147 were collected in a review of the literature. This lesion occurred more often in female than male patients by a 2:1 margin, and the mean age at presentation was 38 years. The average patient had been symptomatic for nearly 3 years at the time of treatment, with the most common symptoms and signs being pituitary dysfunction, visual disturbances, and headaches. Affected children generally were pituitary dwarfs. The sella was enlarged in 80% of cases, and the cyst was situated in both an intrasellar and a suprasellar location in 71%. Computerized tomography revealed a low-density cystic mass with capsular enhancement in one-half of the cases. A variable appearance was seen with magnetic resonance imaging. Partial excision and drainage of the cyst by the transsphenoidal approach is the recommended treatment, as the recurrence rate is low. Most symptoms and signs improved or resolved following surgery with the exception of hypopituitarism and diabetes insipidus. The cyst lining was usually composed of ciliated cuboidal or columnar epithelium. Theories as to the origin of Rathke's cleft cysts are also discussed. 
5	Inpatient theophylline toxicity: preventable factors. OBJECTIVE: To identify preventable factors contributing to inpatient theophylline toxicity. DESIGN: Case series. SETTING: Tertiary care public hospital. PATIENTS: Forty consecutive adult inpatients (mean age, 56.5 years) with theophylline levels greater than 140 mumol/L (25.0 mg/L). MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: A retrospective chart audit was done. Toxicity was produced in 27 of 40 patients by inpatient or emergency department theophylline administration. Management errors found included delay (greater than 10 hours) in taking action from time toxic blood levels were drawn (20 patients), inappropriately high dosing of patients with congestive heart failure (17 patients), failure to recognize obvious symptoms (16 patients), recurrent toxicity (11 patients), additional emergency department treatment of already toxic patients (7 patients), overlap of intravenous and oral therapy (6 patients), patient discharged with no physician awareness of toxicity or dosage change (5 patients). CONCLUSIONS: A set of recurring management errors was identified as contributing to inpatient theophylline toxicity. Effective preventive mechanisms could have prevented most toxicity and associated morbidity. Theophylline's overall risk-benefit ratio in the inpatient setting may be less than that measured in well-controlled studies of the drug's efficacy because of these management errors. 
4	Alterations in collateral blood flow produced by isoflurane in a chronically instrumented canine model of multivessel coronary artery disease. The actions of isoflurane and adenosine on left ventricular myocardial perfusion during a total occlusion of the left anterior descending coronary artery and concomitant stenosis of the left circumflex coronary artery were investigated in dogs chronically instrumented for measurement of systemic and coronary hemodynamics, regional myocardial contractile function (via ultrasonic sonomicrometers), and myocardial blood flow (via the radioactive microsphere technique). An Ameroid constrictor was implanted on the left circumflex coronary artery to produce a slowly progressive stenosis that gradually depleted the coronary reserve of the distal vascular bed. The reductions in reserve were evaluated by daily measurement of baseline left circumflex coronary blood flow velocity and the hyperemic response to injection of adenosine. At a stage of moderate or severe left circumflex stenosis development, the left anterior descending coronary artery was totally occluded via a hydraulic occluder to simulate multivessel coronary artery disease, and control measurements of hemodynamics, regional contractile function, and myocardial blood flow were completed. In separate groups of experiments, either adenosine (0.64 and 1.28 mg/min) or isoflurane (1.6-1.8 and 2.3-2.5%, end-tidal) was administered and measurements remade during steady state hemodynamic conditions. Finally, diastolic aortic pressure and heart rate were adjusted to levels present in the control state during administration of adenosine or isoflurane, and additional measurements were recorded. Isoflurane reduced mean arterial pressure, left ventricular systolic pressure, and the rate of increase of left ventricular pressure at 50 mmHg (positive dP/dt50) without change in heart rate. Administration of isoflurane decreased blood flow in normal, stenotic, and occluded regions; however, when arterial pressure and heart rate were restored to levels present in the conscious state, myocardial perfusion in all regions was maintained at control levels. Ratios of flow between occluded and normal or stenotic zones remained unchanged from the conscious state during a constant aortic pressure and heart rate. Similar results were obtained in dogs with either a moderate or severe left circumflex coronary artery stenosis. In contrast, adenosine produced a dose-related decrease in collateral flow and occluded-to-normal or occluded-to-stenotic zone flow ratio. The results of this investigation indicate that adenosine but not isoflurane redistributes blood flow away from collateral-dependent myocardium to other regions in a chronically instrumented canine model of multivessel coronary artery disease.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS). 
5	Simultaneous superior oblique sheathectomy and inferior oblique tuck in congenital Brown's syndrome. Since Harold Brown, in 1950, described the superior oblique tendon sheath syndrome, numerous surgical techniques have been explored to treat this condition. Tenectomy of the homolateral superior oblique, alone or in combination with a weakening procedure on the homolateral inferior oblique, has been the technique most advocated. However, good functional results are rarely achieved in a single procedure, and delayed complications are frequent. Taking advantage of the improved dissection and reduced trauma afforded by the use of a surgical microscope, one of the techniques first recommended and later abandoned by Brown was reappraised. The technique consists of dissection of the sheath and attachments of the superior oblique, while preserving its tendon, combined with a 10mm tuck of the homolateral inferior oblique. Both a typical and a severe atypical congenital case, according to the classification of Brown, were treated in this fashion. Full correction was achieved in both. 
4	Orthopedic complications. Compartment syndrome, fat embolism syndrome, and venous thromboembolism. Specialized education in the care of orthopedic patients includes an understanding of the common complications for which patients require monitoring. With a socioeconomic backdrop of decreasing hospital stays and prospective payment, patient care must be managed proactively. For all three complications presented, there are unique sets of risk factors that, when present, contribute to a high index of suspicion for morbidity. Clusters of symptoms have also been discussed representing the expected normal patterns. With this knowledge as a foundation, clinical application is essential to incorporate other salient aspects of individual situations. Nurses diagnose and treat human responses to health problems. The end result of human responses to injury or orthopedic conditions can be the development of complications. Stringent adherence to patient monitoring protocols can promote timely nursing interventions to prevent, minimize, or detect complications or treatment side effects. Although definitive treatment is often physician directed, nurses are in a key role to impact final patient outcomes. 
2	The effect of ambulation on recovery from postoperative ileus. To determine whether ambulation hastens recovery from ileus following laparotomy, 34 patients were studied, 10 of whom followed an ambulatory regimen beginning on postoperative day 1 (group A). The other 24 patients (group C) did not become ambulatory until postoperative day 4. All patients underwent placement of seromuscular bipolar recording electrodes on the Roux limb, if present, stomach, jejunum, and colon at laparotomy. Group A was recorded before and after ambulation so comparisons could be made to determine if ambulation had an acute effect on myoelectric activity. Group A preambulation and group C recordings were compared to judge whether there was an over-all effect of ambulation on myoelectric recovery. No effect on slow wave frequency or percentage of slow waves with associated spike potentials was noted acutely or overall in the stomach, colon, or jejunum in continuity with the duodenal pacemaker. Transient increases in phase II spike activity in patients having a Roux limb and their jejunum distal to the enteroenterostomy were noted on postoperative days 1 to 2, but these differences resolved by postoperative days 3 or 4. The data suggest that ambulation as a means to help resolve postoperative ileus and its accompanying cramps and bloating may be more perceived than real. 
5	Peripheral nerve function in sepsis and multiple organ failure Forty-three patients who had sepsis and multiple organ failure (critical illness) were studied prospectively to determine the incidence and severity of peripheral nerve function and to correlate such function with a number of variables. Electrophysiologic studies indicated a primary axonal degeneration of motor and sensory fibers in 30 (70 percent). Fifteen (30 percent) had the clinical signs of difficulty in weaning from assisted ventilation, weakness of limb muscles, and reduced or absent deep tendon reflexes. Full recovery from the polyneuropathy occurred among the 23 (53 percent) who survived, except three who had a very severe polyneuropathy. A peripheral nerve function index, computed from electrophysiologic measurements, showed statistically significant (p less than 0.01) negative correlations with the time in the critical care unit, and the serum glucose value; the serum albumin level showed a positive correlation. Multiple regression analyses indicated all three factors accounted for 47 percent (r2 = 0.4678) of all potential variables. In a separate analysis, the nerve function index correlated with the amplitude of the diaphragm compound muscle action potential (p less than 0.01). The results were consistent with the polyneuropathy being due to the same mechanisms that are currently postulated to cause dysfunction in this syndrome of other organ systems (including the neuromuscular respiratory system). 
1	Magnetic resonance imaging of facial nerve neuromas. Facial nerve neuromas are uncommon tumors often confused with other tumors of the temporal bone and cerebellopontine angle. Radiologically, it may be impossible to differentiate an intracanalicular facial nerve neuroma from an acoustic neuroma. We present three case reports of facial nerve neuromas arising within the internal auditory canal to show the important magnetic resonance imaging features of these tumors. One tumor extended into the cerebellopontine angle, middle cranial fossa, and middle ear. Another filled the internal auditory canal and extended through the cerebellopontine angle to the brain stem. The third occurred in a patient who had neurofibromatosis as well as numerous other intracranial tumors. We feel that gadolinium-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging provides the most useful information in the preoperative assessment of this disorder. 
1	Factors influencing survival after pancreaticoduodenectomy for pancreatic cancer. Eighty-nine patients with carcinoma of the head of the pancreas underwent pancreaticoduodenectomies. The actuarial 5-year survival for all 89 patients was 19%, with a median survival of 11.9 months. The 81 hospital survivors were analyzed in an effort to determine factors influencing long-term survival. Negative lymph nodes and the absence of blood vessel invasion both favored long-term survival. The strongest predictive factor was negative lymph node status with a median survival of 55.8 months, compared with 11 months with lymph nodes involved with tumor (p less than 0.05). Blood transfusions were also predictive, with patients receiving two or fewer units having a median survival of 24.7 months, compared with 10.2 months for those receiving three or more units (p less than 0.05). The most important determinant of long-term survival after pancreaticoduodenectomy for pancreatic cancer is biology of the tumor (lymph node status, blood vessel invasion). However, performance of the resection (units of blood transfused) also appears to be an important factor influencing survival. 
5	Surgical management of cervical soft disc herniation. A comparison between the anterior and posterior approach. Anterior cervical fusion was initially described in the 1950s for cervical spondylotic radiculopathy. The indications for this procedure in the management of soft disc herniation have not been clearly defined. In addition, controversy exists as to whether a cervical soft herniation should be managed by an anterior approach or a posterior cervical laminotomy-foraminotomy. The authors report the results of a prospective study comparing anterior discectomy and fusion to posterior laminotomy-foraminotomy for the management of soft cervical disc herniation. Twenty-eight patients underwent anterior discectomy and fusion (Robinson horseshoe graft) while 16 patients underwent posterior laminotomy-foraminotomy. The disc herniations were classified into two types. Type I were single level anterolateral herniations (33 patients) while type II were central soft disc herniations (11 patients). Clinically, patients with type I herniations manifested signs and symptoms of radiculopathy while patients with type II herniations manifested signs of myelopathy or neck pain and bilateral upper extremity paresthesias in 4 patients. Confirmatory studies were myelography in 12 patients, myelography combined with computed tomography (CT) in 26 patients, and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in 6 patients. For type I herniations, 17 patients underwent anterior fusion while 16 patients had a posterior laminotomy-foraminotomy. The 11 patients classified as type II herniation all underwent anterior discectomy and fusion. There were 27 men and 17 women. The age range was 21 to 52 years (mean, 41 years). The follow-up was 1.6 to 8.2 years (mean, 4.2 years). 
1	Regressing atypical histiocytosis. Aberrant prothymocyte differentiation, T-cell receptor gene rearrangements, and nodal involvement. Two cases of regressing atypical histiocytosis were studied. New findings reported include the presence of CD1 epitope on large atypical histiocytoid cells and apparent early lymph node involvement. Because regressing atypical histiocytosis may demonstrate aberrant thymic differentiation antigen expression and T-cell receptor gene rearrangements, initial lymph node involvement, and eventuation in conventional lymphoma in some cases, the alternative term regressing-phase anaplastic lymphoma is proposed as a more accurate designation for this entity. 
4	Reperfusion arrhythmias after thrombolysis. Electrophysiologic tempest, or much ado about nothing. Arrhythmias that may accompany myocardial reperfusion have generated significant clinical interest. First, there were concerns, based on animal studies, that high-grade ventricular tachyarrhythmias would pose a serious threat following thrombolytic therapy to treat an evolving myocardial infarction. Second, lower-grade arrhythmias, such as accelerated idioventricular rhythm, were cited as useful, noninvasive markers of successful reperfusion. Critical review of the current data, however, indicates that arrhythmias following thrombolytic therapy for acute myocardial infarction are usually neither dangerous clinical events nor consistent markers of reperfusion. 
4	Hyperadrenergic orthostatic intolerance as a result of postpartum blood loss. This article describes a young women in whom orthostatic intolerance developed as a result of protracted postpartum vaginal bleeding. The cardiovascular abnormalities were unresponsive to usual treatment measures, and she required combination therapy directed at increasing plasma volume and decreasing sympathetic nervous system activity. After resolution of her symptoms, the patient required no long-term therapy. Chronic blood loss has not been reported as a cause of this syndrome. 
5	Prognostic determinants in extracorporeal membrane oxygenation for respiratory failure in newborns. Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) is becoming an accepted therapeutic modality for newborn respiratory failure, but there is little information available regarding the prognostic determinants with this technique. One hundred thirty-five newborns treated with ECMO over a 4-year period were critically analyzed with regard to the influence that birth weight, gestational age, age at initiation of ECMO, best blood gases before ECMO, number of hours on ECMO, renal failure, intracerebral hemorrhage, and long-distance air transport had on survival. Infants with meconium aspiration and those undergoing long-distance transfer showed significant differences in blood gases before ECMO, with survivors having more normal pH and carbon dioxide tension values. Intracerebral hemorrhage and renal failure that developed during ECMO were grave prognostic signs, with few survivors in either group. These data show that ability to ventilate patients before ECMO, giving normal carbon dioxide tension and pH values, is an important prognostic sign in infants with meconium aspiration and undergoing long-distance transfer for ECMO, whereas renal failure and intracerebral hemorrhage are usually lethal complications of ECMO. Each center performing ECMO should continually reevaluate this invasive technique and its results and complications. 
5	Ruling out acute myocardial infarction. A prospective multicenter validation of a 12-hour strategy for patients at low risk BACKGROUND. Although previous investigations have suggested that 24 hours is required to exclude acute myocardial infarction in patients who are admitted to a coronary care unit for the evaluation of acute chest pain, we hypothesized that a 12-hour period might be adequate for patients with a low probability of infarction at the time of admission. METHODS. Using a Bayesian model, we developed a strategy to identify candidates for a shorter period of observation from an analysis of a derivation set of 976 patients with acute chest pain who were admitted to three teaching and four community hospitals. In the derivation set, patients whose clinical characteristics in the emergency room predicted a low (less than or equal to 7 percent) probability of myocardial infarction had only a 0.4 percent risk of infarction if they had neither abnormal levels of cardiac enzymes nor recurrent ischemic pain during the first 12 hours of hospitalization. In an independent testing set of 2684 patients from the seven hospitals, 957 admitted patients (36 percent) were classified as candidates for this 12-hour period of observation according to a previously published multivariate algorithm. Few of these patients were actually transferred from a monitored setting at 12 hours. RESULTS. Of the 771 candidates for a 12-hour period of observation who did not have enzyme abnormalities or recurrent pain during the first 12 hours, 4 (0.5 percent) were subsequently found to have acute myocardial infarction, and only 3 (0.4 percent) died after primary cardiac arrests, all of which occurred three to five days after admission. Rates of other major cardiovascular complications were low in the patients who might have been transferred from the coronary care unit after 12 hours with this strategy. In patients with a higher initial risk of infarction, the standard strategy of 24-hour observation identified all but 11 of 739 acute myocardial infarctions (1 percent). CONCLUSIONS. Emergency room clinical data can be used to identify a large subgroup of patients for whom a 12-hour period of observation is normally sufficient to exclude acute myocardial infarction. Patient-specific evaluation and treatment can then proceed without the restrictions imposed by "rule-out" protocols for myocardial infarction. 
5	Intraoperative management of severe endobronchial hemorrhage Endobronchial hemorrhage due to pulmonary artery perforation by a Swan-Ganz catheter developed during coronary artery bypass grafting while weaning from cardiopulmonary bypass. After reinstitution of cardio-pulmonary bypass with pulmonary artery venting, bleeding was localized to the right lower lobe bronchus using fiberoptic bronchoscopy. A Fogarty embolectomy catheter was inflated in the bronchus to tamponade successfully only the right lower lobe. This case illustrates a method of distal bronchial blockade for maximal retention of pulmonary function and avoidance of pulmonary resection. 
5	From chimney sweeps to oncogenes: the quest for the causes of cancer. Over the past 200 years, a bewildering array of chemical, physical, and viral agents has been identified that can cause cancer, but the mechanisms involved are only now becoming clear. In the leukemias and lymphomas, it appears that the activation of cellular oncogenes is important. The genes involved are present in all normal cells and are often associated with cell growth and regulation. When activated, they act in a dominant fashion to cause a cell to express the malignant phenotype. There is increasing evidence that in solid tumors, a more important mechanism may be the loss of a suppressor gene. The classic example is retinoblastoma, in which the retinoblastoma gene has been cloned and is also found to be associated with several other common cancers including sarcomas and small cell lung cancer. It is likely to be one of a family of such genes. It may well be that the activation of one or more oncogenes or the loss of one or more suppressor genes, or both, is required for a tumor to progress from initiation through promotion to a metastasizing malignancy. 
1	Roentgenographic evaluation of the augmented breast. We performed a retrospective study to determine the sensitivity of mammography in detecting breast cancer arising in women with augmented breasts. Of eight women with breast implants in whom breast cancer developed, six had mammograms before biopsy. Only two of the six cancers were identified mammographically (sensitivity = 33%), and one of these two was seen only in retrospect. In both cases, the mammographic findings suggested a benign rather than a malignant process. All eight women had a palpable mass and early disease, and all are clinically disease-free at present. The sensitivity of mammography in detecting palpable cancers in a control group of women without implants was 92% (118 of 128). For tumors of 2 cm or less, the sensitivity was 88% (58 of 66). These results suggest that the sensitivity of mammography in detecting breast cancer is decreased when implants are present. Further investigations are needed to determine the effects of prostheses on mammographic evaluations. 
2	Serological evidence of infection with Helicobacter pylori may predict gastrointestinal intolerance to non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) treatment in rheumatoid arthritis. Specific circulating antibodies to the spiral gastric organism, Helicobacter pylori (HP) were detectable in 43% of 68 patients with rheumatoid arthritis by complement fixation test (CFT) and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), a frequency comparable with that of a normal, age-matched population. Presence of these antibodies correlated strongly with a previous history of peptic ulcer disease (PUD) and to the severity of NSAID-related dyspeptic symptoms, the latter often leading to multiple drug intolerance. This contrasts with short term, prospective NSAID toxicity data, which show little relationship between ulceration and HP carriage. This result suggests, however, that HP may have a definite role in the pathogenesis of symptomatic PUD associated with more chronic NSAID usage, and may have important implications for ulcer prophylaxis in these patients. 
2	Typhlitis due to Balantidium coli in captive lowland gorillas. Typhlitis caused by Balantidium coli and requiring surgical resection occurred in three captive lowland gorillas over a 30-month period. Not one of the other gorillas in the colony or their keepers was ill. B. coli is distributed widely geographically and widely among mammals. Asymptomatic commensalism predominates, but invasion of the colonic mucosa can produce diarrhea and dysentery and set the stage for local or systemic spread. 
2	Prevention of a false diagnosis of sexually acquired reactive arthritis by synovial lymphocyte responses. Three cases are reported in which a diagnosis of sexually acquired reactive arthritis might have been made erroneously from the history, but the enteric origin of the reactive arthritis was evident from synovial lymphocyte responses. The importance of making the correct diagnosis and the avoidance of unwarranted spousal dysharmony is stressed. 
4	Limitation of retinal injury by vitreoperfusion initiated after onset of ischemia. We tested whether vitreoperfusion, a new method of perfusing the vitreous cavity with solutions containing nutrients, can limit retinal injury if initiated after the onset of ischemia. Severe bilateral ocular ischemia was induced in cats with healed lensectomy-vitrectomy wounds; 30, 60, 90, or 120 minutes later, one eye from each of 18 cats underwent vitreoperfusion while the ischemia continued for 120 minutes. The other eye simultaneously underwent either continued untreated ischemia or reinstated circulation. The histopathologic abnormalities evident after 8 days depended on the duration of ischemia. Reinstated circulation yielded less retinal damage than continued ischemia. Nine additional cats underwent bilateral ischemia for at least 210 minutes. Vitreoperfusion was initiated in one eye after 30 minutes. In each cat, the vitreoperfused eye fared significantly better as observed histopathologically and electroretinographically. We believe that no other treatment has similarly limited retinal injury in vivo when initiated so long after total ocular ischemia has developed. 
4	Heparin as the cause of coagulopathy which may complicate grafting of the liver. Disposal of heparin is accomplished rapidly by the normal liver, but the effects of ischemia, flushing and hypothermia during hepatic transplantation have not been investigated before. The results of the present study showed that neither laparotomy, hypothermia nor insertion of the portosystemic bypass seemed markedly to affect the coagulation profile, but autograft associated with 30 to 45 minutes of warm ischemia resulted in a twofold prolongation of the t1/2 heparin as calculated from sequential measurements of the activated clotting time. Unexpectedly, the storage of livers for four hours in EuroCollins solutions seemed to result in more rapid disappearance of heparin than in animals after laparotomy. After hepatectomy, the clearance of heparin was delayed for two hours but, thereafter, the slope of the disappearance resembled that in sham operated animals. Autograft and allograft of livers in normal pigs that did not receive transfusion were also associated with changes in fibrinolysis and declining levels of fibrinogen together with severe intraoperative bleeding problems and rapid death on the operating table in 30 per cent of the pigs. While administration of heparin alone did not appear to precipitate these changes, use of the drug after dissection, mobilization and storage of the liver may release other tissue factors that activate fibrinolysis. 
1	Response of the Lambert-Eaton myasthenic syndrome to treatment of associated small-cell lung carcinoma. We evaluated the outcome in 16 patients with Lambert-Eaton myasthenic syndrome (LEMS) associated with histologically verified small-cell carcinoma (SCC). Thirteen patients received specific tumor therapy (chemotherapy, radiation therapy, or resection) and most also received pharmacologic and immunologic treatment for LEMS. Seven of 11 patients surviving for more than 2 months after tumor therapy showed substantial neurologic improvement (1 patient being in complete remission at 7 years); in 3 of 11 improvement was transient. An EMG index of disease severity (compound muscle action potential amplitude in abductor digiti minimi) was significantly increased at final follow-up (p less than 0.01; n = 11). A pretreatment amplitude greater than 3.0 mV was a good prognostic sign. We conclude that a combined treatment approach in SCC-LEMS usually results in neurologic improvement. 
5	Management of perineal wounds following abdominoperineal resection with inferior gluteal flaps. Our experience treating perineal wounds secondary to abdominoperineal resection, either for inflammatory bowel disease or cancer, is presented. A total of 16 patients were treated either on a delayed basis or at the same time as the abdominoperineal resection. All wounds were closed using the inferior gluteal myocutaneous flap. Fifteen of 16 patients have achieved healing, eight of whom had no complications. Only minor revisions or local wound care were required in the remaining patients, with only one patient failing to heal. Our results compare favorably with previous reports of treatment of this difficult problem. 
4	Divergent effects of serotonin on coronary-artery dimensions and blood flow in patients with coronary atherosclerosis and control patients BACKGROUND. Studies in animals have shown that serotonin constricts coronary arteries if the endothelium is damaged, but in vitro studies have revealed a vasodilating effect on isolated coronary segments with an intact endothelium. To investigate the effect of serotonin in humans, we studied coronary-artery cross-sectional area and blood flow before and after the infusion of serotonin in seven patients with angiographically normal coronary arteries and in seven with coronary artery disease. METHODS. We measured the cross-sectional area of the coronary artery by quantitative angiography and coronary blood flow with an intracoronary Doppler catheter. Measurements were obtained at base line and during intracoronary infusions of serotonin (0.1, 1, and 10 micrograms per kilogram of body weight per minute, for two minutes). We repeated the measurements after an infusion of ketanserin, an antagonist of serotonin receptors that is thought to block the effect of serotonin on receptors in the arterial wall but not in the endothelium. RESULTS. In patients with normal coronary arteries, the highest dose of serotonin increased cross-sectional area by 52 percent (P less than 0.001) and blood flow by 58 percent (P less than 0.01). The effect was significantly potentiated by administration of ketanserin. In patients with coronary-artery atherosclerosis, serotonin reduced cross-sectional area by 64 percent (P less than 0.001) and blood flow by 59 percent (P less than 0.001). Ketanserin prevented this effect. CONCLUSIONS. Serotonin has a vasodilating effect on normal human coronary arteries; when the endothelium is damaged, as in coronary artery disease, serotonin has a direct, unopposed vasoconstricting effect. When considered with other evidence, these data suggest that platelet-derived factors such as serotonin may have a role in certain acute coronary ischemic syndromes. 
3	Survey of adolescents with severe intellectual handicap. A diagnostic survey was undertaken of children aged 11 to 19 years in Tameside with severe learning difficulties (intelligence quotient less than or equal to 50). Eighty-two children were identified and their medical records reviewed. A specific diagnosis for the retardation was documented in 25 (30%) of the children, 18 of whom had Down's syndrome. A probable aetiology or a disorder of unknown aetiology had been identified in a further 21 (26%) children. To confirm the existing diagnosis, identify new diagnoses, and offer genetic counselling, the parents of 63 children were offered detailed reassessment of their child. Fifty three children were reviewed, and a specific disorder identified in 25 out of 31 previously undiagnosed children. The most frequent diagnoses made were fragile X syndrome and Rett's syndrome. On completion of the survey, 61 of the 82 children (74%) had a specific diagnosis or probable aetiology identified, 12 (15%) had associated disorders such as cerebral palsy, and in only nine of the 82 children (11%) were there no clues at all to the cause of their retardation. 
4	Ultrasonic evaluation of early carotid atherosclerosis. We investigated the prevalence of carotid atherosclerosis, including mild early lesions, and its association with cervical bruits and various risk factors (age, male sex, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, diabetes mellitus, obesity, and cigarette smoking) in 232 consecutive Japanese patients. High-resolution real-time B-mode ultrasonography was performed to determine the extent of atherosclerosis, and it was quantified by using a scoring system. The prevalence of carotid atherosclerosis was 49%, 59%, and 41% in all 232 patients, the 100 symptomatic patients, and the 132 asymptomatic patients, respectively. Although carotid lesions were detected frequently (87%) in the 30 patients with cervical bruits, bruits were noted in only 30% of the 88 examined patients with carotid atherosclerosis. Independent risk factors for carotid atherosclerosis in these patients were found to be age, male sex, and hyperlipidemia; diabetes mellitus was a possible risk factor for carotid atherosclerosis. Our study did not show a close association between hypertension and carotid atherosclerosis, and this might be caused by the high prevalence of hypertension in our patients. Our findings suggest an increasing prevalence of carotid atherosclerosis in the Japanese, though this should be confirmed in a population-based study. Our study demonstrates the clinical usefulness of high-resolution B-mode ultrasonography for the evaluation of early carotid atherosclerosis. 
1	Granular cell tumor of the esophagus: endoscopic ultrasonographic demonstration and endoscopic removal. A 35-yr-old Japanese man with a granular cell tumor of the esophagus that was removed by endoscopic polypectomy is presented. Radiography and endoscopy showed a 20 x 12 mm sessile protrusion in the distal esophagus. Endoscopic ultrasonography demonstrated the hypoechoic mass in the submucosa without continuity to the muscularis propria. The lesion was successfully treated by endoscopic polypectomy without complications. The cross-sections of the resected specimen were quite in agreement with the ultrasonographic findings. Endoscopic ultrasonography is valuable to assess the exact location and extent of the tumor, and to determine the indication for endoscopic polypectomy. 
1	Coexpression patterns of vimentin and glial filament protein with cytokeratins in the normal, hyperplastic, and neoplastic breast. The authors studied by immunohistochemistry the intermediate filament (IF) protein profile of 66 frozen samples of breast tissue, including normal parenchyma, all variants of fibrocystic disease (FCD), fibroadenomas, cystosarcoma phylloides, and ductal and lobular carcinomas. Monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) to cytokeratins included MAb KA 1, which binds to polypeptide 5 in a complex with polypeptide 14 and recognizes preferentially myoepithelial cells; MAb KA4, which binds to polypeptides 14, 15, 16 and 19; individual MAbs to polypeptides 7, 13, and 16, 17, 18, and 19, and the MAb mixture AE1/AE3. The authors also applied three MAbs to vimentin (Vim), and three MAbs to glial filament protein (GFP). Selected samples were studied by double-label immunofluorescence microscopy and by staining sequential sections with some of the said MAbs, an MAb to alpha-smooth muscle actin, and well-characterized polyclonal antibodies for the possible coexpression of diverse types of cytoskeletal proteins. Gel electrophoresis and immunoblot analysis also were performed. All samples reacted for cytokeratins with MAbs AE1/AE3, although the reaction did not involve all cells. Monoclonal antibody KA4 stained preferentially the luminal-secretory cells in the normal breast and in FCD, whereas it stained the vast majority of cells in all carcinomas. Monoclonal antibody KA1 stained preferentially the basal-myoepithelial cells of the normal breast and FCD while staining tumor cell subpopulations in 4 of 31 carcinomas. Vimentin-positive cells were found in 8 of 12 normal breasts and in 12 of 20 FCD; in most cases, Vim-reactive cells appeared to be myoepithelial, but occasional luminal cells were also stained. Variable subpopulations of Vim-positive cells were noted in 9 of 20 ductal and in 1 of 7 lobular carcinomas. Glial filament protein-reactive cells were found in normal breast lobules and ducts and in 15 of 20 cases of FCD; with rare exceptions, GFP-reactivity was restricted to basally located, myoepithelial-appearing cells. Occasional GFP-reactive cells were found in 3 of 31 carcinomas. Evaluation of sequential sections and double-label immunofluorescence microscopy showed the coexpression of certain cytokeratins (possibly including polypeptides 14 and 17) with vimentin and alpha-smooth muscle actin together with GFP in some myoepithelial cells. The presence of GFP in myoepithelial cells was confirmed by gel electrophoresis and immunoblotting. Our results indicate that coexpression of cytokeratin with vimentin and/or GFP is comparatively frequent in normal basal-myoepithelial cells of the breast.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS). 
1	Carotid artery disease in patients with head and neck carcinoma. Irradiation has been shown experimentally to cause accelerated development of atherosclerosis in exposed large arteries. However, occurrence of such an entity in carotid arteries of patients after treatment for head and neck carcinoma is unknown. Therefore, we reviewed 179 patient charts who had undergone head and neck operations with or without irradiation between 1979-1987. Of these 179 patients, 107 (59.8%) were dead at time of follow-up. Cause of death was unknown in 42 (40%) patients; in the remainder included: respiratory arrest--33; carcinoma-related--18; cardiac--6;pneumonia--7; and trauma--1. Average interval from treatment to death was 23.5 months. Of the 72 patients known to be alive, follow-up was obtained in 52 patients. Their average age was 64.9 years. Risk factors for atherosclerosis included: male gender--43; smoking--50; hypertension--9; diabetes--4; coronary artery disease--12; and peripheral vascular disease--4. Seventy-five per cent of these patients received postoperative irradiation. Average follow-up was 64.5 months. Duplex scans were performed on 34 patients. Three patients had common or internal carotid stenoses greater than 75 per cent. All of these patients had received irradiation and none of them were symptomatic. Seven patients had carotid stenoses between 50 to 75 per cent; five of these had received irradiation. Of these five patients, one had a stroke 60 months postoperatively, and one had a TIA 36 months postoperatively. The remaining 58 patients (of which 48 had irradiation) had carotid stenoses less than 50 per cent and none were symptomatic. 
2	Hepatic fibrin-ring granulomas in a patient with hepatitis A. Hepatic fibrin-ring granulomas were found in a 30-year-old patient with serologically confirmed hepatitis A. Other causes associated with the presence of fibrin-ring granulomas in the liver, such as Hodgkin's and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, cytomegalovirus infection, visceral leishmaniasis, and consumption of allopurinol, were ruled out. It is suggested that hepatitis A must be included in the differential diagnosis of a patient with hepatic fibrin-ring granulomas. 
4	Neurogenic control of the cerebral circulation during global ischemia. The influence of the trigeminal nerve on the cerebral circulation was investigated in chronically denervated cats during and after reversible four-vessel occlusion for 10 minutes combined with controlled hypotension (50 mm Hg). Postocclusive hyperemia 30 minutes after reperfusion was attenuated by up to 48% in cortical gray matter of the anterior, middle, and posterior cerebral artery territories on the side of trigeminal ganglionectomy. Similar results were observed for denervation accomplished by direct surgical ablation and by the topical application of capsaicin to a cortical branch of the middle cerebral artery. Denervation did not alter basal cerebral blood flow or the duration of hyperemia, nor did it impair the cerebrovascular response to hypercapnia. These data demonstrate the importance of neurogenic mechanisms in the development of postischemic hyperperfusion and suggest that strategies directed at blocking axon reflex-like mechanisms may be beneficial in reducing the morbidity that follows severe cortical hyperemia. 
5	Bronchiolar inflammation and fibrosis associated with smoking. A morphologic cross-sectional population analysis. The lungs of 42 smokers and 13 nonsmoking males of various ages who died suddenly and unexpectedly were examined grossly using Gough-Wentworth whole-lung sections and by microscopic planimetry to assess the severity and prevalence of emphysema. The bronchioles in representative histologic sections were evaluated for inflammation and epithelial metaplasia as well as for fibrosis and muscular hypertrophy. Postmortem interviews with next of kin established a history of cigarette smoking and excluded possible occupational exposures to toxic or particulate inhalants. Emphysematous changes were not prominent in members of the study group, but they tended to be more severe in smokers (p = 0.059) and increased in severity with age (p less than 0.001). Inflammatory changes (so-called smoker's bronchiolitis) were evident in smokers of all ages, although they were significantly less prominent in the lungs of older smokers. On the other hand, respiratory and membranous bronchiolar wall fibrosis was increasingly evident in older smokers (p less than 0.05). Muscular hypertrophy in the bronchiolar walls was significantly greater in smokers, but a change with age was not observed. These findings strongly suggest that bronchiolar fibrosis is associated with chronic cigarette use. These lesions occur independently of emphysema and may account for some of the subtle physiologic alterations observed in smokers. 
1	Intramuscular hemangioma in the oral region: report of three cases. The occurrence of intramuscular hemangioma in an intraoral or perioral localization is rare, and a thorough knowledge of these tumors is necessary for adequate diagnosis and treatment. Three cases are presented with discussion, and their histopathology and differential diagnosis are discussed. An adequate primary excision is necessary to avoid recurrence. 
5	Rupture of a giant carotid aneurysm after extracranial-to-intracranial bypass surgery. We report a case of a fatal rupture of a previously unruptured giant aneurysm of the bifurcation of the internal carotid artery (ICA), which occurred after an extracranial-intracranial (EC-IC) bypass and the partial occlusion of the ICA. Interim angiography showed retrograde filling of the proximal middle cerebral artery to the aneurysm. There have been four previously reported cases of giant aneurysms rupturing after treatment with an EC-IC bypass and carotid ligation, and it appears likely that a change in pressure/flow dynamics produced by the bypass may have been the cause. The technique of carotid ligation with an EC-IC bypass is used frequently to treat unclippable intracranial aneurysms, and the resulting hemodynamic changes need to be considered carefully to prevent this type of complication. To minimize hemodynamic stress on the aneurysm, we suggest that 1) the bypass caliber should be as small as possible consistent with sufficient cerebral blood flow after ICA occlusion, and 2) complete ICA occlusion should be performed as soon as possible after the bypass. 
5	Colon cancer in pregnancy with elevated maternal serum alpha-fetoprotein level at presentation. A case of colon cancer in pregnancy is presented in which the maternal serum alpha-fetoprotein level was elevated. Failure to evaluate colon cancer as a cause of the elevated maternal serum alpha-fetoprotein may have accounted for the poor outcome. 
4	The origin and fate of complex coronary lesions. Complex irregular coronary artery stenoses, representing plaque rupture/thrombosis, are associated with the acute coronary syndromes. However, the natural history (origin and fate) of these lesions is not known. To examine this issue we studied 255 patients who had had two to four arteriograms within a mean interval of 2.6 +/- 1.7 years. Of 53 irregular lesions that had progressed on a later arteriogram, 35 (66%) originated from areas that were smooth and less than 50% in stenosis diameter. Of 44 irregular lesions on an earlier study, 10 (23%) became totally occluded, five (11%) progressed in severity (all remained irregular), 25 (57%) showed no change in severity (all remained irregular), and four (9%) regressed (two became smooth). Nine of the 10 lesions progressing to occlusion were greater than or equal to 95% stenosed on the earlier study. Only 2 of 44 lesions (5%) showed smoothing. These findings are in agreement with the concept that irregular lesions represent ruptured atherosclerotic plaques and demonstrate that they usually originate from mildly occlusive smooth plaques. Markedly narrowed irregular lesions (greater than or equal to 95% stenosis) frequently progress to occlusion. Irregular lesions less than 90% narrowed commonly remain angiographically stable, and irregular over several years. They were found rarely to evolve into smooth-walled plaques. 
5	Absent or minimal cerebrospinal fluid abnormalities in Haemophilus influenzae meningitis. A case of Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib) meningitis in which the diagnosis and treatment were delayed because of normal cerebrospinal fluid analysis is presented. A retrospective review was conducted at two children's hospitals to determine the frequency and clinical characteristics of patients with Hib meningitis whose spinal fluid had a normal total white blood cell count, normal chemistries, and negative Gram stain, but subsequent growth of Hib in culture. Of 379 cases of Hib meningitis, two had completely normal CSF, and two had CSF containing small numbers of polymorphonuclear cells as the sole abnormality. In three of the four cases, the duration of symptoms was less than 24 hours, and appropriate therapy was significantly delayed because of benign-appearing CSF. Normal CSF cell counts, chemistries, and Gram stain do not exclude the possibility of bacterial meningitis, and one should remain suspicious when a child has clinical findings suggesting meningitis. 
2	Hypophosphatemia and renal tubular dysfunction in alcoholics. Are they related to liver function impairment? The study was designed to evaluate (a) the role of reduced renal phosphate reabsorptive capacity assessed as the ratio of maximum capacity for renal phosphate reabsorption (TmPO4) to glomerular filtration rate (GFR) in the pathogenesis of hypophosphatemia in alcoholics, (b) possible mechanisms leading to reduced TmPO4/GFR, and (c) the effect of liver function impairment on TmPO4/GFR. The TmPO4/GFR, its major extrarenal determinants, ratios of urinary excretion gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase and of alpha-glucosidase to GFR (uGGT/GFR and uAGL/GFR), indices of structural damage of renal tubular cells, and fractional clearance of lysozyme, an index of proximal renal function, were evaluated in 31 alcoholics with alcohol-related liver disease, 24 alcoholics without alcohol-related liver disease, 14 patients with non-alcohol-related liver disease, and 25 control subjects. Hypophosphatemia was found in 35% of alcoholics with alcohol-related liver disease, 29% of alcoholics without alcohol-related liver disease, and no patients with non-alcohol-related liver disease. A reduced TmPO4/GFR was the major determinant of hypophosphatemia in both groups of alcoholics. No difference in extrarenal determinants of TmPO4/GFR was found between alcoholics with and without hypophosphatemia. Alcoholics with and without alcohol-related liver disease had increased uGGT/GFR and normal uAGL/GFR regardless of serum phosphate level. Fractional clearance of lysozyme, instead, was increased only in hypophosphatemic alcoholics with and without alcohol-related liver disease. The TmPO4/GFR correlated inversely with the fractional clearance of lysozyme in both groups of alcoholics (P less than 0.01). The TmPO4/GFR and urinary enzymes were normal in patients with non-alcohol-related liver disease. It was concluded that a reduced TmPO4/GFR is involved in the pathogenesis of hypophosphatemia in alcoholics. A proximal tubular dysfunction seems to be responsible for the reduced TmPO4/GFR. Liver function impairment is not required for the expression of this tubular dysfunction. 
3	A retrospective study of spontaneous remission and long-term outcome in patients with infantile spasms. The spontaneous remission rate and long-term outcome in 44 patients with infantile spasms not treated with hormonal drugs were studied. The cumulative spontaneous remission rate during the first 12 months after onset of infantile spasms, as determined by retrospective analysis, was as follows: 1 month, 2%; 2 months, 2%; 3 months, 5%; 4 months, 7%; 5 months, 9%; 6 months, 11%; 7 months, 11%; 8 months, 14%; 9 months, 16%; 10 months, 18%; 11 months, 25%; 12 months, 25%. The average age at follow-up was 80 months. Nine percent of patients had normal development or only mild impairment. The remainder showed various degrees of retardation. These data should be useful in the design and interpretation of therapeutic drug trials in patients with infantile spasms. 
5	Intestinal perforation due to cytomegalovirus infection in patients with AIDS. Intestinal perforation due to cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection in patients with AIDS is the most common life-threatening condition requiring emergency celiotomy in these patients. The authors describe a patient with AIDS with intestinal perforation due to CMV infection, and review 14 additional cases reported in the English-language surgical literature. The diagnostic triad of pneumoperitoneum on x-ray, evidence or history of CMV infection, and AIDS occurred in 70 percent of patients. The most common site of intestinal perforation was the colon (53 percent), followed in frequency by the distal ileum (40 percent) and appendix (7 percent); perforation usually occurred between the distal ileum and splenic flexure of the colon. Colonoscopy, rather than sigmoidoscopy, is recommended as a screening examination in patients with AIDS suspected of having colonic ulceration due to CMV infection. Multiple biopsies of ulcerated tissue should be obtained. Gross and microscopic analyses of involved intestinal tissue reveal the characteristic findings of ulceration and CMV infection. Despite aggressive therapy, the operative mortality rate in patients with AIDS with intestinal perforation due to CMV infection was 54 percent and the overall mortality rate was 87 percent. Postoperative complications occurred in most patients and consisted mainly of systemic sepsis and pneumonia caused by Pneumocystis carinii infection. An increased awareness of this syndrome by physicians frequently called on to manage patients with AIDS is recommended. 
5	Clinical and anatomical considerations for nonoperative therapy in tibial disease and the results of angioplasty. For a 6-year period, 96 patients had 146 below-knee angioplasties. There were 31 total occlusions and 95 multiple stenoses. All patients had distal ischemia, and 40% had gangrene. The primary success rate was 97%, and the 2-year limb salvage rate was 83%. The ankle/brachial index increased from a mean of 0.25 before the procedure to 0.62 afterward. At 2 years (35 patients), the mean ankle/brachial index was 0.55. For the same period, 320 femorodistal bypasses were performed. The results of angioplasty are comparable to those of surgery, but angioplasty is only suitable in about 20-30% of patients presenting with isolated tibial disease. Suitable lesions are five or fewer stenoses and occlusions 5 cm or less in length. 
2	Outcome of hepatitis B virus infection in homosexual men and its relation to prior human immunodeficiency virus infection. To investigate the effect of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) infection on subsequent hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection, HIV antibody was sought in homosexual men who developed HBV infection during a hepatitis B vaccine trial. Among 134 unvaccinated HIV-1-negative men, 7% became HBV carriers, 64% had viremia, and 42% had clinical illness. Among vaccinated HIV-1-negative men, HBV infection severity decreased with number of vaccine doses administered. When adjusted for prior hepatitis B vaccination status, persons with HIV-1 infection preceding HBV infection had a significantly higher risk of developing HBV carriage, viremia, prolonged ALT elevation, and clinical illness. Among HIV-1-infected men, the risk of HBV carriage was increased in unvaccinated persons (21%) and those who failed to respond to vaccination (31%) and further increased in those who received vaccine doses at the time they developed new HBV infection (56%-80%), suggesting inactivated hepatitis B vaccine may temporarily impair the immune response to HBV infection in HIV-1-infected persons. HIV-1 infection was also associated with reduced alanine aminotransferase elevations during the first 36 months of follow-up of men who became HBV carriers. 
5	Peripheral neuropathy associated with eosinophilia-myalgia syndrome. In 1989, the Centers for Disease Control recognized the existence of an epidemic illness characterized by myalgia and eosinophilia in individuals taking preparations containing L-tryptophan. We evaluated 3 patients with eosinophilia-myalgia syndrome who presented with subacute progressive neuropathies. The neuropathies were predominantly motor and maximal in the lower extremities. Two patients were confined to a wheelchair and one was ventilator-dependent and bedridden. Sensory loss predominantly involved small fiber modalities. Electrophysiological studies showed multifocal marked conduction slowing and conduction block indicating segmental demyelination, with associated axonal degeneration that was accentuated distally. Examination of sural nerve biopsy specimens demonstrated axonal degeneration in all 3 patients and perivascular infiltrates in 2. Levels of quinolinic acid, a neurotoxic metabolite of L-tryptophan, were elevated in the cerebrospinal fluid in the 2 patients in whom it was measured. The cause of the neuropathy is unknown but may include immune mechanisms or toxicity of eosinophils, L-tryptophan, its metabolic products, or contaminants within L-tryptophan preparations. 
4	Metabolic considerations in hypertension. The frequent concurrence of other cardiovascular risk factors in hypertensive patients, such as obesity and diabetes mellitus, suggests that overlapping genetic and environmental factors may contribute to the common metabolic and cardiovascular derangements observed in these populations. Hypertension and hyperglycemia accelerate atherosclerosis in diabetics, and play an important role in associated morbidity and mortality. Several abnormalities in blood pressure regulatory systems such as the renin-angiotensin system, the sympathetic nervous system, and sodium/volume control have been described in diabetes mellitus. Sodium retention and cardiovascular hyperreactivity appear to occur early in the course of diabetes mellitus, even at normal blood pressure levels and before onset of renal failure, and could set the stage for the development of hypertension. The relationship between obesity and hypertension is also well-established, and may reflect metabolic and cardiovascular adaptations in obese subjects which predispose to blood pressure elevations. Obese subjects display changes in sympathetic nervous system activity, sodium metabolism, and vascular hemodynamics. Sodium-sensitive blood pressure responses in the obese may be secondary to increased cardiac output or fluid volume, and are directly related to circulating insulin levels. Certain metabolic and vascular characteristics of obesity and diabetes mellitus are found in patients with essential hypertension. It has been suggested that insulin and insulin resistance may be the common link between these risk factors. Improved understanding of metabolic considerations in the treatment of obese and diabetic hypertensives should lead to more careful selection of medications that avoid metabolic complications. Although diuretics and beta-blockers may be useful in some patients, there are several reasons not to recommend their use as initial therapy in obese and diabetic hypertensives. On the other hand, calcium channel blockers and angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors are highly effective, with minimal effects on metabolic parameters, and are well-suited as first-line therapy in the treatment of obese and diabetic hypertensives. 
5	Morphologic comparison of patients with mitral valve prolapse who died suddenly with patients who died from severe valvular dysfunction or other conditions. Clinical and necropsy findings are described in 56 patients with mitral valve prolapse: 15 patients, aged 16 to 69 years (mean 39), died suddenly and mitral valve prolapse was the only cardiac condition found at necropsy (hereafter called isolated mitral valve prolapse); the remaining 41 patients had other conditions that were capable of being fatal. Of the latter 41 patients, 7, aged 17 to 59 years (mean 45), had associated congenital heart disease, and 34 patients, aged 17 to 70 years (mean 52), had no associated congenital cardiac abnormalities. Compared with the 34 patients without associated congenital heart disease and with nonmitral valve prolapse conditions capable in themselves of being fatal, the 15 patients who died suddenly with isolated mitral valve prolapse were younger (mean age 39 +/- 17 versus 52 +/- 15 years; p = 0.01), more often women (67% versus 26%; p = 0.008) and had a lower frequency of mitral regurgitation (7% versus 38%; p = 0.02). The 15 patients dying suddenly with isolated mitral valve prolapse also were less likely to have evidence of ruptured chordae tendineae (29% versus 67%; p = 0.04). The frequency of increased heart weight (67% versus 59%), a dilated mitral valve anulus (80% versus 81%), a dilated tricuspid valve anulus (17% versus 17%), an elongated anterior mitral leaflet (86% versus 54%), an elongated posterior mitral leaflet (79% versus 77%) and fibrous endocardial plaque under the posterior mitral leaflet (73% versus 63%) was similar between the two groups. The severity of the prolapse (mild 20% versus 11%; moderate 27% versus 58%; severe 53% versus 32%) also was similar between the two groups. Thus, persons with mitral valve prolapse dying suddenly without another recognized condition tend to be relatively young women without mitral regurgitation. 
1	Human papillomavirus in oesophageal squamous cell carcinoma. Thirty seven cases of oesophageal squamous cell carcinoma were studied by applying DNA slot blot analysis and in situ hybridisation using type specific probes for HPV 6, 11, 16 and 18. Cases of condyloma accuminata, cervical carcinoma, and laryngeal papilloma were used as controls. Blocks including areas of invasive carcinoma, intraepithelial neoplasia, and normal epithelium were studied in each case. No HPV genome was detectable in any of the oesophageal cases. It is concluded that these types of HPV do not have an association with oesophageal squamous cell carcinoma. 
1	The effects of interleukin-6 on tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes derived from human renal cell cancer. Tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TIL) are a heterogeneous population of T cells with potent antitumor activity against a wide variety of tumors. TIL from renal cell cancer (RCC) typically exhibit diminished growth and antitumor activity after four weeks in vitro. We have therefore investigated effects of varying doses of interleukin-6 (IL-6) (0, 25, 100 units/ml.) on in vitro expansion, proliferation, cytotoxicity, and expression of cell surface phenotypes of long term renal TIL cultures from three RCC patients. Among the various conditions tested, three of three TIL cultures displayed a mild increase in cell expansion when grown in IL-2 with the addition of 100 units/ml. of IL-6. Two of three TIL cultures grown in IL-2 and 100 U/ml. of IL-6 demonstrated enhanced proliferation as determined by 3H-thymidine uptake. TIL could not be isolated or maintained in vitro when grown in the presence of IL-6 alone without IL-2. IL-6 was also found to enhance the long term non-specific cytotoxicity against an allogeneic nonrenal tumor target. No consistent effect on autologous tumor-specific cytotoxicity was demonstrated. We conclude that IL-6, when used in combination with IL-2, may modestly enhance the long-term growth of RCC-derived TIL. 
3	Evidence for platelet-activating factor as a novel mediator in experimental stroke in rabbits. Platelet-activating factor is a potent mediator of inflammation, which has untoward effects on cerebrovascular and neural elements. While several investigators have reported attenuation of ischemic damage after treatment with antagonists of platelet-activating factor, no study has proved endogenous production of platelet-activating factor in ischemia of the central nervous system. We hypothesized that endogenous production of platelet-activating factor participates in the early pathologic manifestations of deteriorating stroke. In 12 rabbits, we found tissue levels of platelet-activating factor measured by the release of serotonin from washed platelets to be elevated by approximately 20-fold in spinal cord injured by 25 minutes of ischemia and 2 hours of reperfusion (2.80 +/- 0.98 ng/g) compared with that in normal spinal cord (0.15 +/- 0.06 ng/g, p less than 0.01). Given during ischemia to seven rabbits, 10 mg/kg i.p. of a highly selective and potent antagonist of platelet-activating factor (BN 50739) accentuated the early postischemic hyperemia and prevented the delayed hypoperfusion measured by on-line laser-Doppler flowmetry (-35 +/- 7% of baseline [n = 7] without versus 33 +/- 14% with treatment, p less than 0.01) and the edema formation measured as the increase in tissue water content (4.4 +/- 0.7% without [n = 6] versus 2.1 +/- 0.6% with [n = 7]treatment, p less than 0.05) after 2 hours of reperfusion. This neurochemical and pharmacologic evidence emphasizes a new perspective of ischemia-induced phospholipid degradation and suggests an important role for platelet-activating factor in the early manifestations of stroke. 
3	Cardiovascular responses to arm cranking and FNS-induced leg exercise in paraplegics. Twelve spinal cord-injured males performed arm-crank exercise (ACE) with and without concurrent functional neuromuscular stimulation (FNS) of paralyzed leg muscles to investigate the hypothesis that FNS would augment cardiovascular performance during submaximal ACE. Six men who exhibited vigorous isometric contractions of thigh and calf muscles were classed as "responders" to FNS (R), and the remaining subjects with poor or nonexistent contractions served as "nonresponder controls" (C). Steady-state heart rate and oxygen uptake during ACE at 30, 60, and 90 W were not appreciably different from the ACE + FNS condition. However, cardiac outputs in R were augmented by 30% during FNS at rest (from 4.9 to 6.4 l/min), by 18% during 30-W ACE + FNS (from 8.6 to 10.1 l/min), and by 28% during 90-W ACE + FNS (from 12.1 to 15.6 l/min). Similarly, resting stroke volumes were increased by 18% (9 ml) and by 23% (19 ml) at 60 W during FNS in the R group. Calculated total peripheral resistance was reduced at rest and during 90-W ACE + FNS by approximately 24%. In contrast, no alterations of circulatory hemodynamics were observed for C subjects. These data indicate that FNS-induced contractions of paralyzed leg muscles augment venous return to aid central cardiovascular control during upper-body submaximal exercise in paraplegics. 
1	Chondrosarcoma of the soft tissues. Two different sub-groups. Chondrosarcomas arising from soft tissues are rare. Two different varieties are described, myxoid and mesenchymal. We have collected nine cases of the tumour, five myxoid and four mesenchymal, from a review of 513 cases of chondrosarcoma seen between 1904 and 1988. We report the principal clinical, radiographical and histological differences between the two varieties and discuss their surgical treatment and prognosis. 
1	Cerebral venous thrombosis: new causes for an old syndrome? The range of disorders affecting the cerebral veins and sinuses is increasing and now includes blood disorders, abnormalities in the patterns of blood flow, and infiltrative or inflammatory conditions, all of which may promote thrombosis. We describe 10 patients with cerebral venous thrombosis: two had protein S deficiency, one had protein C deficiency, one was in early pregnancy, and there was a single case of each of the following: dural arteriovenous malformation, intracerebral arteriovenous malformation, bilateral glomus tumours, systemic lupus erythematosus, Wegener's granulomatosis, non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. The recognition of such diverse aetiology may be importance since clinical features are non-specific, and may consist only of raised intracranial pressure, allowing confusion with 'benign intracranial hypertension'. The existence of effective treatment both for the thrombosis and for many of the underlying disorders makes early diagnosis essential. The prognosis of treated patients may be favourable. 
1	Central neurogenic hyperventilation in invasive laryngeal carcinoma. We describe a patient with central neurogenic hyperventilation secondary to extension of a laryngeal tumor into the base of the brain, resulting in extrinsic compression of the medulla. Such an association has not been previously described. Unique features which distinguish this patient from previously reported cases are emphasized. Possible mechanisms involved in pathogenesis, as well as types of therapy, are outlined. 
1	'Locked-in syndrome' for 27 years following a viral illness: clinical and pathologic findings. We describe a man who, after a presumed encephalitic illness, was "locked-in" for 27 years. His CT and autopsy findings showed atrophy of the brainstem and a cystic lesion at the base of the pons. He survived longer than most other patients in a similar state. 
5	Snow skiing for the physically disabled. The sport of snow skiing by the physically disabled, which originated in Europe in 1935 and first received attention in the United States in the 1940s, is reviewed in terms of opportunities available, instructions, adaptive equipment necessary, and benefits provided. Persons with a wide variety of disabilities (such as cerebral palsy, multiple sclerosis, spinal cord injury, hemiplegia, amputation, blindness, spina bifida, and muscular dystrophy) can participate. Accordingly, a wide range of adaptive equipment is available--including outrigger skis, flip-skis, canting wedges, ski bras, "toe spreaders," sit-skis, and mono-skis--to allow safe enjoyment of the sport. Programs for instruction of the disabled skier are increasing in number and popularity, and numerous opportunities are available to enter competitive events sponsored by National Handicapped Sports. Both the participants and the instructors relate the numerous physical and psychologic benefits that can be derived from skiing; the sport provides an almost universal enjoyment of the sense of freedom and independence. Snow skiing is an enjoyable, beneficial, outdoor cold-weather activity that the disabled population can safely learn with proper instruction. 
5	Improved biocompatibility by postfixation treatment of aldehyde fixed bovine pericardium. Long-standing release of locally cytotoxic aldehyde concentrations is responsible for lack of spontaneous endothelialization and increased calcification of glutaraldehyde fixed bovine pericardium. Postfixation treatment with amino acids made in vitro endothelialization of bioprosthetic heart valves possible. Such treated pericardium calcified significantly less (13 +/- 4 micrograms/mg dry weight) than did conventionally processed pericardium (114 +/- 25 micrograms/mg) after 63 days of subcutaneous implantation in rats. To test the ability for spontaneous in vivo endothelialization, 5 sheep had 6 mm grafts made from postfixation treated pericardium (PTP) implanted into the carotid artery, compared to PTFE grafts on the contralateral side, which spontaneously endothelialize in animal models. In a pregnant animal, both grafts occluded. All remaining pericardial grafts remained patent, but one additional PTFE graft occluded and another one was stenosed. The area covered with red thrombus was significantly smaller in the PTP grafts (3.05 +/- 3.9%) than in the PTFE grafts 42 +/- 14% (p = 0.0036); TEM and SEM showed endothelial cells growing directly on the PTP, but only on myofibroblasts in PTFE grafts. Postfixation treatment of glutaraldehyde fixed pericardium aids spontaneous endothelialization and decreases tissue calcification. 
5	Early hospital discharge of children with cancer treated for fever and neutropenia: identification and management of the low-risk patient. Children with leukemia and solid tumors are often hospitalized for empiric broad-spectrum antibiotic therapy because of fever during periods of chemotherapy-induced neutropenia. Conventional practice dictates that parenteral antibiotics be continued until the patient is afebrile and has recovered from neutropenia, ie, until the absolute neutrophil count (ANC) exceeds 500 cells per cubic millimeter. However, the practice in our center has been to discontinue parenteral antibiotic therapy and discharge many such patients before resolution of neutropenia. Since the feasibility and safety of this approach has not been studied, we reviewed the records of 114 consecutive hospitalizations for fever and neutropenia in 61 patients during a 13-month period. Seventy-seven children (68%) were discharged to their homes while still neutropenic after they had been afebrile for 1 to 2 days on parenteral antibiotics, had negative blood cultures, appeared well, and usually had some evidence of bone marrow recovery. Five patients (4.4%) developed recurrent fever and required rehospitalization within 7 days of discharge. Only three of the 77 patients (3.9%) who were sent home with neutropenia had recurrent fever. Each had a brief and uneventful second hospitalization. Two of the 37 children discharged with an ANC over 500 cells per cubic millimeter required rehospitalization. A declining ANC and advanced malignancy were risk factors in predicting recurrence of fever following discharge. A rising monocyte count was a predictor of imminent recovery from neutropenia. These results suggest that "early" discharge of an afebrile yet still neutropenic patient is safe when the patient is in remission, has no evidence of serious infection, appears clinically stable, and has indications of bone marrow recovery. The conventional approach of routinely continuing the hospitalization until resolution of neutropenia may be unnecessary in such low-risk patients. 
4	Selective inhibition by a synthetic hirudin peptide of fibrin-dependent thrombosis in baboons. To determine the importance of the thrombin substrate recognition exosite for fibrinogen binding in the formation of both arterial and venous thrombi, we evaluated the antithrombotic effects of the tyrosine-sulfated dodecapeptide from residues 53-64 of hirudin (H peptide) in a nonhuman primate model. This peptide was studied because it inhibits thrombin cleavages of fibrinogen by simple competition without blocking enzyme catalytic-site function. When an exteriorized arteriovenous access shunt model was used in baboons (Papio anubis), thrombus formation was induced by placing a thrombogenic device made of (i) a segment of tubing coated covalently with type I collagen, which generated platelet-rich thrombi under arterial flow conditions, and (ii) two subsequent annular regions of flow expansion that produced fibrin-rich thrombi typically associated with venous valves and veins. Thrombus formation was quantified by measurements of 111In-labeled platelet and 125I-labeled fibrinogen deposition in both arterial-flow and venous-flow portions of the device. Continuous infusion of H peptide (0.5, 15, and 75 mg/kg) proximal to the device for 40 min interrupted, in a dose-response fashion, formation of fibrin-rich thrombus in the regions of disturbed flow and generation of fibrinopeptide A. In contrast, H peptide did not inhibit the capacity of platelets to deposit on the collagen surface (P greater than 0.2 at all doses) or to form hemostatic plugs (as assessed by measurements of bleeding time; P greater than 0.1 at all doses). These findings suggest that, by competitive inhibition of fibrinogen binding to thrombin, fibrin-rich venous-type thrombus formation may be selectively prevented. This strategy may be therapeutically attractive for preserving normal platelet function when conventional anticoagulant therapy is contraindicated. 
1	Reconstruction of mandibular defects in irradiated patients. In this prospective study, mandibular reconstruction using titanium plates was evaluated in 31 patients treated between July 1988 and January 1990. Sixteen patients had prior surgery; 13 had prior radiotherapy. In 11 patients, prior radiation and surgery had failed. Sixteen patients received postoperative radiotherapy either in standard or accelerated fractions. Twelve patients had complications of either intraoral (8), extraoral (5), or combined (1) plate exposure or fistula formation (2). Factors significantly related to complications were poor nutrition, accelerated radiation, and recurrence. Sixty-one percent of all patients healed uneventfully. When patients with complications secondary to recurrence who subsequently died were excluded, the success rate was 73%. Only one patient had an unacceptable result that produced a cosmetic and functional deformity despite secondary repair. 
2	Utility of upper endoscopy in the evaluation of noncardiac chest pain. The diagnostic yield of esophagogastroduodenoscopy, esophageal manometry, and Bernstein testing was assessed in 100 consecutive patients being evaluated for non-cardiac chest pain. Manometric studies revealed the nutcracker esophagus in 21 patients; non-specific esophageal motility disorders in 19 patients; a hypertensive lower esophageal sphincter in 4 patients; diffuse esophageal spasm in 2 patients; and normal motility in 54 patients. Endoscopy was normal in 38 patients; but revealed grades II to IV esophagitis in 24 patients; gastritis and/or duodenitis in 18 patients; a sliding hiatal hernia without evidence of esophagitis in 14 patients; and gastric or duodenal ulcers in 6 patients. Twenty-five individuals were found to have normal manometric studies in combination with a negative Bernstein test. Among these 25 patients, however, 7 patients had esophagitis (grade II or higher); 6 patients had gastritis and/or duodenitis; five patients had a sliding hiatal hernia without esophagitis; 1 patient had peptic ulcer disease; and only 6 patients had a normal endoscopic exam. Our results indicate that endoscopy can identify a significant number of patients with acid-peptic disease who present with non-cardiac chest pain, that would not have been otherwise diagnosed by esophageal manometry or Bernstein testing alone or in combination. 
1	Aspiration biopsy cytology of occult breast lesions by use of the "scouting needle". A prospective study of 261 cases. The increased use of mammography for the detection of impalpable breast lesions has resulted in a need for new diagnostic techniques. In a prospective study of 261 occult breast lesions, aspiration biopsy was done with a standard fine needle and syringe. This "scouting needle" technique permits the collection of diagnostic cytologic material in the clinician's office without specialized radiologic equipment. Thirty of 53 malignant lesions (57%) were detected cytologically. A benign cytologic diagnosis, which was made in 220 patients, did not preclude additional investigation. Aspiration biopsy using the "scouting needle" is a rapid, low-cost, easily performed, initial procedure which complements "watchful waiting." When diagnostic of carcinoma, it results in immediate surgical intervention and may obviate two-stage surgical treatment. 
5	Perioperative myocardial ischemia in patients undergoing noncardiac surgery--I: Incidence and severity during the 4 day perioperative period. The Study of Perioperative Ischemia (SPI) Research Group. To determine the incidence and characteristics of perioperative myocardial ischemia, the electrocardiographic (ECG) changes consistent with ischemia during the 4 day perioperative period were documented and characterized in 100 patients with or at risk for coronary artery disease undergoing noncardiac surgery. Using continuous two channel ECG monitoring (leads CC5 and CM5), the frequency and severity of ECG ischemic episodes defined by ST segment depression greater than or equal to 1 mm or elevation greater than or equal to 2 mm during the preoperative (up to 2 days), intraoperative and early postoperative (first 2 days) periods were compared. Preoperatively, 28 patients (28%) exhibited 105 episodes of ischemia; intraoperatively, 27 patients exhibited 39 episodes and postoperatively, 42 patients exhibited 187 episodes. There was no difference between the pre- and intraoperative episode characteristics. However, postoperative ischemic episodes were the most severe. The mean ST change was 1.5, 2 and 2.6 mm for pre-, intra- and postoperative episodes, respectively (p less than 0.0001 postoperative versus pre- or intraoperative); duration of ischemic episodes was 69, 45 and 207 min, respectively (p less than 0.005 postoperative versus preoperative, p less than 0.001 versus intraoperative) and area under the ST curve was 88, 74 and 383 mm.min (p less than 0.009 postoperative versus preoperative, p less than 0.005 versus intraoperative). Ninety-four percent of all postoperative ischemic episodes were silent; 80% of all episodes occurred without acute change (+/- 20% of control) in heart rate and 77% of intraoperative episodes occurred without acute change in blood pressure. 
3	The management of the painful first metatarsophalangeal joint in the older patient. Arthrodesis or Keller's arthroplasty? We report a prospective randomised trial comparing Keller's arthroplasty and arthrodesis of the first metatarsophalangeal joint for the management of symptomatic hallux valgus and hallux rigidus in the older patient. In 81 patients (110 feet), with a minimum of two years follow-up, both procedures gave a similar degree of patient satisfaction and symptom relief. The incidence of metatarsalgia was also similar. As there were no obvious advantages to arthrodesis, and since six out of 50 arthrodesed toes required revision, we suggest that Keller's arthroplasty is the better operation in these patients. 
5	Alterations in left ventricular diastolic twist mechanics during acute human cardiac allograft rejection. BACKGROUND. Contraction of obliquely oriented left ventricular (LV) fibers results in a twisting motion of the left ventricle. The purpose of this study was to assess the effects of acute human cardiac allograft rejection on LV twist pattern and the twist-volume relation. METHODS AND RESULTS. Tantalum markers were implanted into the LV midwall in 15 transplant recipients to measure time-varying, three-dimensional chamber twist using computer-assisted analysis of biplane cinefluoroscopic images. Twist was defined as the mean longitudinal gradient of circumferential rotation about the LV long axis. When plotted against normalized percent ejection fraction (%EF), the resulting twist-normalized %EF relation could be divided into three phases. In systole, LV twist was linearly related to ejection of blood. In contrast, diastolic untwist was characterized by early rapid recoil with little change in LV volume, followed by more gradual untwisting when the bulk of diastolic filling occurred. During 10 acute rejection episodes in 10 patients, maximum twist, peak systolic twist rate, and the slope of the systolic twist-normalized %EF relation did not change. In contrast, the slope of the early (first 15% of filling) diastolic twist-normalized %EF relation (M(early-dia)) decreased significantly (-0.194 +/- 0.062 [prerejection] versus -0.103 +/- 0.054 rad/cm [rejection], p = 0.0003), resulting in a prolonged tau 1/2 (time required to untwist by 50% [20 +/- 5% versus 28 +/- 5% of diastole], p = 0.0003) and decrease in percent untwisting at 15% diastolic LV filling (62 +/- 11% versus 36 +/- 13%, p = 0.0003). Therefore, a greater proportion of LV untwisting occurred later in diastole during rejection, as reflected by an increase in the slope (M(mid-dia)) of the middle to late (from 15 to 90% filling) diastolic twist-normalized %EF relation (-0.018 +/- 0.009 versus -0.030 +/- 0.010 rad/cm, p = 0.0015). Peak rate of untwist was not affected. With resolution of rejection, M(early-dia) and percent untwist during early diastole returned to baseline levels (p = NS versus baseline). There was also a trend for M(mid-dia) to return toward prerejection values (p = NS versus baseline), but this change did not reach statistical significance compared with rejection values. CONCLUSION. Acute cardiac allograft rejection is associated with altered diastolic twist mechanics in the absence of any demonstratable systolic abnormalities. During rejection, myocardial edema and other factors may result in intrinsic changes of the elastic properties of the myocardium, thereby leading to modification of recoil forces responsible for the early, rapid unwinding of the deformed ventricle. 
5	Expression and characterization of TCA3: a murine inflammatory protein. TCA3 is a cDNA originally isolated from activated T cells. Transcription of this gene has been shown to correlate with Ag-induced cellular activation of both T cells and mast cells. Based on the predicted amino acid sequence encoded by the cDNA, we previously proposed that TCA3 represents a cytokine. In this report we have used rDNA technology to express TCA3 in two mammalian cell lines. In both cases, TCA3 was expressed as a secreted molecule with an apparent molecular mass of 16 kDa. Digestion of the (rTCA3) with the enzyme N-glycanase revealed that approximately 8 kDa is caused by N-linked glycosylation. Intradermal injection of rTCA3 into mouse footpads resulted in a rapid swelling response. The sites of injection were characterized histologically by a local accumulation of neutrophils. These findings are discussed with particular attention to a family of related proteins, some of whose members also have inflammatory properties. 
5	Role of dopamine and arterial chemoreceptors in thermal tachypnea in conscious cats. In mammals submitted to a warm environment, intracerebral injection of dopamine (DA) produces no change or an increase in body temperature accompanied by an increase in metabolic heat production, but its effect on heat loss mechanisms such as vasodilation and tachypnea is not clear. Because the principal mechanism of heat loss in the conscious cat is thermal tachypnea, we studied the influence of DA on thermal tachypnea in response to heat stress (ambient temperature = 33-36 degrees C) in five conscious cats. We first studied the steady-state response to a DA agonist, apomorphine, which crosses the blood-brain barrier. Intravenous injection of apomorphine greatly reduced thermal tachypnea by decreasing respiratory frequency (from 94.9 to 52.5 breaths/min) and increasing tidal volume (from 13.2 to 20.4 ml). The subsequent injection of the DA antagonist haloperidol, which also crosses the blood-brain barrier, restored the initial tachypnea. To further investigate the mechanism involved in thermal tachypnea, we studied the influence of peripheral chemoreceptors by transiently stimulating or inhibiting carotid body (CB) activity during tachypneic breathing. CB stimulation by intravenous injection of NaCN or domperidone reduced thermal tachypnea mainly by decreasing the respiratory frequency, whereas CB inhibition by DA tended to increase frequency and thus tachypnea. It is concluded that 1) in a warm environment, central DA receptors are also greatly involved in heat loss mechanisms, 2) arterial chemoreceptor input appears to counteract this tachypneic breathing, and 3) thermal and hypoxic tachypnea may be controlled by the same mechanism in which a DA-like system has a key role. 
5	Normalization of ventilation/perfusion relationships after liver transplantation in patients with decompensated cirrhosis: evidence for a hepatopulmonary syndrome. To examine the effect of liver transplantation on the respiratory and cardiovascular functions, ventilation/perfusion relationships were determined by multiple inert gas elimination technique in six patients with end-stage liver disease 1 to 19 mo before and 2 to 6 mo after liver transplantation. Cardiac output and pulmonary vascular pressures were measured after catheterization of the pulmonary artery. All patients had normal spirometry and chest x-ray films before transplantation. PaO2 before transplantation was 78.8 +/- 7.4 mm Hg (range = 51.8 to 102.8 mm Hg). All patients had perfusion of poorly ventilated lung regions (low ventilation/perfusion relationships) varying from 3% to 19% of cardiac output (mean = 8.5% +/- 2.4% of cardiac output) and two patients had intrapulmonary shunting (3% and 20% of cardiac output). Measured and calculated PaO2 agreed closely, indicating absence of pulmonary diffusion abnormality, as well as of extrapulmonary shunting. After transplantation, PaO2 normalized in all patients, and both shunting and low ventilation/perfusion relationships disappeared. Cardiac output decreased from 9.1 +/- 1.4 to 6.6 +/- 0.5 L/min (p less than 0.05), and the pulmonary vascular resistance increased from 0.69 +/- 0.14 to 1.64 +/- 0.43 mm Hg/L/min (p less than 0.05). The systemic vascular resistance also increased (before = 8.7 +/- 1.0; after = 15.3 +/- 1.1 mm Hg/L/min; p less than 0.001). Normalization of respiratory and cardiovascular alterations, after liver transplantation, in patients with end-stage liver disease indicates that these changes have a direct functional relationship to the diseased liver. It is hypothesized that this is part of a "hepatopulmonary syndrome,' which in similarity to the hepatorenal syndrome disappears with improved liver function. 
2	Clinical management of gastric cancer and concomitant esophagogastric varices. We report the late results of treatment of 13 consecutive patients with gastric cancer and concomitant esophagogastric varices. Of seven good-risk patients classified as Child's class A or B, gastrectomy together with selective shunt operation was performed in two, total gastrectomy with splenectomy in three, and distal partial gastrectomy with paraesophageal devascularization without splenectomy in one. The remaining patient with early gastric cancer underwent distal partial gastrectomy following repeated endoscopic injection sclerotherapy (EIS) for treatment of the esophageal varices. Although the majority of patients who underwent surgical repair of varices (i.e., shunt, splenectomy, or devascularization) died, total gastrectomy with splenectomy was the only procedure that led to control of the esophageal varices. Since partial gastrectomy combined with EIS limits the morbidity and mortality of an extensive resection and at the same time controls esophageal variceal bleeding, it is probably the procedure of choice for patients with a carcinoma in the lower two-thirds of the stomach. Concerning non-surgical cases, two patients were effectively treated using laser endoscopy and EIS, without the occurrence of variceal bleeding. The remaining four patients, given chemotherapy or irradiation for treatment of gastric carcinoma, died within 4 months with variceal bleeding or liver failure. For the poor-risk patients with evidence of severe liver dysfunction, laser treatment and EIS would be the treatment of choice. 
1	Occurrence of uveal melanoma in contact with a chorioretinal cryocoagulation scar. A case of a uveal melanoma arising in an eye previously treated with cryocoagulation for a horseshoe retinal tear is described. In the anterior border of the tumor, a notch, clearly fitting the curve of the chorioretinal scar was observed. Possible mechanisms which may be responsible for the local arrest of the tumor extension are discussed. 
1	Esophageal ultrasound and the preoperative staging of carcinoma of the esophagus. Esophageal ultrasound allows the esophageal wall to be viewed as five discrete layers. Lymph nodes are easily identified, and their size, shape, margin, and internal structure can be assessed. This provides an alternative method of preoperative (clinical) evaluation of the primary tumor [T] and the regional lymph nodes [N] of patients with carcinoma of the esophagus. Esophageal ultrasound was attempted in the clinical staging of 28 patients with carcinoma of the esophagus. Six patients (21%) were not assessed because of the inability to pass the esophageal ultrasound probe through the malignant stricture. The staging system for carcinoma of the esophagus developed by the International Union Against Cancer and the American Joint Committee on Cancer was used. Twenty-two patients had the true T determined by pathologic review of the resected esophagus. Esophageal ultrasound correctly identified T in 13 patients (59% accuracy). In four patients (18%) the disease was overstaged by esophageal ultrasound; all these patients had early T1 tumors confined to the submucosa. In five patients (23%) the disease was understaged by esophageal ultrasound; all of these patients had advanced tumors (four T3 and one T4) that invaded beyond the esophageal wall. Seven of the nine incorrect esophageal ultrasound determinations were called T2 (three T1, three T3, one T4), which suggests that the borders of the muscularis propria require careful attention when evaluated by esophageal ultrasound. Twenty patients had the true N determined by pathologic review of the resected specimen. Esophageal ultrasound correctly identified N in 14 patients (70% accuracy). Three patients were falsely identified as having N1 disease and three were falsely identified as having N0 disease. The sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value for N assessment by esophageal ultrasound were 70%. Esophageal ultrasound provides an alternative method of visualization of the esophageal wall and regional lymph nodes. Our early experience shows promise for esophageal ultrasound in the clinical staging of carcinoma of the esophagus. 
2	Gastrointestinal tuberculosis. Report of four cases. Gastrointestinal tuberculosis is a rare disease in the United States. Correct identification is often delayed because it is not considered early on in the differential diagnosis. Four patients with gastrointestinal tuberculosis and the symptoms, diagnosis, complications, and treatment of the disease are discussed. Gastrointestinal tuberculosis should be considered in Asian immigrant patients who present with symptoms and signs of inflammatory bowel disease. 
1	Multimodal therapy in locally advanced breast carcinoma. Among 879 patients treated for breast cancer between 1975 and 1984, advanced disease was found in 125 (14%). A subgroup of 34 (4%) presented with untreated locally advanced disease without demonstrable distant metastases at the time of diagnosis (stage IIIB = T4abed, NX-2,MO). During the first 5 years (1975 through 1979), 17 patients were treated primarily with sequential radiotherapy and chemotherapy (Group A). From 1980 to 1984 (Group B), the management consisted of four courses of induction multi-drug chemotherapy followed primarily by mastectomy and additional chemotherapy. The mean follow-up for the most recent group (Group B) is 48 months. Follow-up was complete. While the local disease control rate was the same for both groups (76%), the survival was remarkably different. Group A patients experienced a median survival of 15 months, and only one survived 5 years. In Group B, the median survival was 56 months with nine patients (53%) alive between 40 and 76 months, seven (41%) of whom are 5-year survivors. While the overall mortality of patients with inflammatory breast cancer was greater in both groups when compared with the group with noninflammatory disease, the survival of patients in Group B was better than in Group A for both inflammatory and noninflammatory cancers (p less than 0.01). Estrogen receptor, nodal, and menopausal status did not influence survival. These data suggest that neoadjuvant chemotherapy improves survival for patients with stage IIIB breast carcinoma and delays the establishment or progression of distant metastases. Mastectomy is an important component in the treatment of this disease. 
1	Preliminary characterization of growth factors secreted by human pituitary tumors. To investigate the secretion of mitogenic factors by human pituitary tumors we have cultured cells from 54 adenomas in serum-free medium. Conditioned media from 28 (52%) elicited dose-dependent stimulation of [3H]thymidine incorporation into rat GH3 cells (22-338% above control), while 14 (26%) inhibited GH3 proliferation. Stimulating activity was observed more frequently in nonfunctional tumor-conditioned medium (73%; n = 22) than in secretory tumor-conditioned medium (37%; n = 32). Of 10 tumour-conditioned media with mitogenic activity for GH3 cells, only 4 produced modest stimulation of HEp2 (human laryngeal carcinoma) cells. In contrast, [3H]thymidine incorporation into A431 (human squamous carcinoma) and PC12 (rat adrenal pheochromocytoma) cells was enhanced by each of 15 tumor-conditioned media (up to 342% and 275%, respectively), 8 of which had shown stimulatory and 2 inhibitory effects on GH3 cells. Gel filtration of pooled conditioned media from 10 nonfunctional tumors showed significant growth-promoting activity for GH3 cells in fractions corresponding to mol wt of 2-3 and 11-18 kDa. Proliferative activity on A431 cells also eluted in two positions; one corresponded to the higher mol wt peak seen with GH3 cells, while the other, not observed with GH3 cells, was in the 3- to 6-kDa range. These findings suggest that cells derived from human pituitary adenoma tissue synthesize and secrete several growth factors, each of which may have its own target cell specificities. These factors have yet to be characterized, but we suggest that they may have a role in stimulating the development or maintenance of human pituitary adenomas. 
4	Characteristics of a new angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor: delapril. Delapril, a nonsulfhydryl angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor, which has an indanylglycine moiety differing from the proline moiety of captopril or enalapril, is an esterified prodrug that is converted in vivo to its active metabolites. Delapril effectively inhibits rabbit lung ACE activity and lowers blood pressure in spontaneously hypertensive rats. Delapril has several characteristics that differ from captopril and enalapril, including high lipophilicity and weak bradykinin potentiating action. Delapril is a more potent inhibitor of vascular wall ACE activity than enalapril or captopril. It also shows a weaker potentiating action on the citric acid-induced cough in the guinea pig model compared with captopril and enalapril. In 12 out of 150 patients with essential hypertension who complained of cough during treatment with enalapril, changing to delapril resulted in resolution of the cough in 6 out of 12 of these patients: the percentage of patients in the total population with cough decreased from 8% to 4%. 
1	Cryoprobe as a "handle" for resection of metastatic liver tumors. Resection of metastatic liver tumors can be a difficult and risky procedure. Using a cryoprobe as a "handle" can greatly facilitate resection by providing a taut surface for transection and improving visualization of ductal and vascular structures. In addition, this technique may decrease the risk of contaminating surrounding tissues with cancer cells, and may inhibit tumor recurrence within the margins of resection. 
1	Toxic dermatitis induced by 10-ethyl-10-deaza-aminopterin (10-EdAM), a novel antifolate. A new methotrexate analog, 10-ethyl-10-deaza-aminopterin (10-EdAM), was found to induce a particular form of skin toxicity different than the skin rash reported to result from methotrexate. At histologic examination, it was found to be a toxic dermatitis that clinically most often first appears on the lower legs but can occur anywhere in the body, especially if treatment is continued. Nine cases are reported. A specific risk factor could not yet be identified. Discontinuation of 10-EdAM administration leads to complete healing; concomitant corticosteroid treatment also induces healing. 
4	Experience with esmolol for the treatment of cocaine-associated cardiovascular complications. The authors report their experience using esmolol, an ultra-short acting beta-adrenergic antagonist, for the treatment of seven patients with cocaine-associated cardiovascular complications. No consistent hemodynamic benefit was found with the use of this drug. Although there was a decline in mean heart rate of 23% (range 0% to 35%), they were unable to show a consistent antihypertensive response. Adverse effects occurred in three patients. This included one patient with a marked exacerbation of hypertension and one who became hypotensive. Another patient developed emesis and lethargy during esmolol therapy and required endotracheal intubation. They do not recommend the routine use of esmolol for cocaine cardiotoxicity. 
4	Prevalence of hemodynamically significant stenosis of the carotid artery in an asymptomatic veteran population. The results of previous studies have suggested that significant stenosis of the carotid artery occurs in less than 6 per cent of asymptomatic patients. However, some populations studied were not representative of those seen by most vascular surgeons. Accordingly, we examined two cohorts of patients at the Veterans Administration Medical Center using Duplex scanning. There were 153 volunteers in group 1, all more than 50 years of age, who were being treated at our outpatient department for nonvascular problems. There were 116 patients of similar age in group 2 but who were known to have significant arterial occlusive disease of the lower extremity. The majority of patients were men with a mean age of 64.4 years. Risk factors in the total population included hypertension, diabetes mellitus, coronary arterial disease, peripheral vascular disease and smoking. Over-all, significant (greater than 50 per cent diameter) stenosis of the carotid artery was discovered in 25 of 269 patients. The prevalence for those in group 1 was 6.5 per cent versus 12.9 per cent for those in group 2 (p = 0.058). The prevalence in patients with cardiac disease was 15.2 per cent compared with 6.8 per cent in those without cardiac disease (p = 0.032). Smoking was associated with a 10.6 per cent rate of significant disease compared with a 2.3 per cent rate in nonsmokers (p = 0.065). Hypertension and diabetes were not significant risk factors. Significant stenosis of the carotid artery was found in seven of 40 patients in whom coronary arterial disease, peripheral vascular disease and smoking were all present. 
5	Asymmetric growth of the lateral cerebral ventricle in infants with posthemorrhagic ventricular dilation. Lateral cerebral ventricular volume in 36 preterm infants with or without an intraventricular hemorrhage, and with or without posthemorrhagic hydrocephalus, was measured longitudinally and compared with the ventricular index measurements of the same ventricles. A poor correlation was found (r2 = 0.67). To determine a reason for this poor relationship, we analyzed the volumes of the regions of the ventricles by a segmental volume analysis. The occipital region of the lateral cerebral ventricle enlarged at a much faster rate (1.904 +/- 0.477 ml/day) than either the anterior region (0.546 +/- 0.253 ml/day; p less than 0.01) or the middle region (-0.209 +/- 0.334 ml/day; p less than 0.01) in infants with posthemorrhagic hydrocephalus. The rate of growth of the middle region of the lateral cerebral ventricles was the same for all infants. Linear indexes, such as the ventricular index and the lateral ventricular ratio, do not allow for accurate serial estimates of ventricular size in posthemorrhagic hydrocephalus because of asymmetric growth of the lateral cerebral ventricle. We conclude that sequential volume measurements are more useful than ventricular index measurements to follow ventricular size sequentially in infants with posthemorrhagic hydrocephalus. 
5	Surgical complications with the cochlear multiple-channel intracochlear implant: experience at Hannover and Melbourne. The surgical complications for the first 153 multiple-channel cochlear implant operations carried out at the Medizinische Hochschule in Hannover and the first 100 operations at the University of Melbourne Clinic, The Royal Victorian Eye and Ear Hospital, are presented. In the Hannover experience the major complications were wound breakdown, wound infection, electrode tie erosion through the external auditory canal, electrode slippage, a persistent increase in tinnitus, and facial nerve stimulation. The incidence of wound breakdown requiring removal of the package was 0.6% in Hannover and 1.0% in Melbourne. The complications for the operation at both clinics were at acceptable levels. It was considered that wound breakdown requiring implant removal could be kept to a minimum by making a generous incision and suturing the flap without tension. 
3	Acute urinary retention secondary to Herpes simplex meningitis. We report a case of acute urinary retention in a 24-year-old man with Herpes simplex meningitis without genital lesions. Since the differential diagnosis in young patients who present with acute urinary retention also includes multiple sclerosis, lumbosacral disk herniation, rheumatological disorders and drug intoxication, a thorough history and careful neurological examination are of paramount importance in distinguishing these syndromes. As part of a directed neurological evaluation prompt performance of lumbar puncture is indicated; a lymphocytic pleocytosis is suggestive of herpetic meningitis. Culture of Herpes simplex virus from the cerebrospinal fluid should be attempted. We recommend conservative management only, typically with intermittent catheterization, since bladder function usually normalizes within 10 to 14 days. 
4	Intracranial hemorrhage from aneurysms and arteriovenous malformations during pregnancy and the puerperium. Intracranial hemorrhage (ICH) from an intracranial aneurysm or arteriovenous malformation is a grave complication of pregnancy and is responsible for 5 to 12% of all maternal deaths. We critically analyzed 154 cases of verified ICH during pregnancy from an identified intracranial lesion, including 2 patients treated at our institution and 152 cases previously reported in the literature in English. Aneurysms were responsible for ICH in 77% of patients, and arteriovenous malformations in 23%. Hemorrhage occurred antepartum in 92% of patients and postpartum in 8%. Women with angiomatous hemorrhage were younger than those with aneurysmal hemorrhage; however, in contrast to previous reports, we found no differences between angiomatous and aneurysmal hemorrhage with respect to parity or gestational age at the time of the initial hemorrhage. Hypertension and/or albuminuria were present at some time during the pregnancy in 34% of patients with documentation, which sometimes made it difficult to differentiate angiomatous or aneurysmal ICH from that associated with eclampsia. In a logistic regression analysis, surgical management of aneurysms, but not arteriovenous malformations, was associated with significantly lower maternal and fetal mortality, independent of other covariants. For those patients with a lesion not operated on, cesarean delivery afforded no better maternal or fetal outcome than did vaginal delivery. We conclude that the decision to operate after ICH during pregnancy should be based upon neurosurgical principles, whereas the method of delivery should be based upon obstetrical considerations. The perioperative and anesthetic management of the pregnant patient with a neurosurgical complication is discussed. 
5	ST segment alternans during percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty--a case report. The occurrence of electrical alternans of the ST segment has been reported in patients with variant angina. The authors encountered a patient with typical electrical alternans of the ST segment in leads V4 through V6, which developed during percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA) of the proximal left anterior descending artery. Hemodynamic pulsus alternans of the aortic pressure tracing was not observed during electrical alternans, and a Ca2+ blocker could not prevent this phenomenon during PTCA. 
5	Irritable bowel syndrome in women having diagnostic laparoscopy or hysterectomy. Relation to gynecologic features and outcome. We identified irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) in 47.7% of 86 women having diagnostic laparoscopy for chronic pelvic pain, 39.5% of 172 women having elective hysterectomy, and 32.0% of 172 controls age-matched for the hysterectomy group (P = NS). Constipation and pain subtype IBS were more common in hysterectomy patients than controls (P less than 0.05). In laparoscopy patients, dyspareunia was more common in those with IBS than in those without it (P less than 0.05). In the hysterectomy group, more IBS patients had chronic pelvic pain (P less than 0.005), and abnormal menses (P less than 0.01). Chronic pelvic pain was more frequently the only prehysterectomy diagnosis in IBS patients (P less than 0.05), and IBS was present more often when pain was a reason for hysterectomy (P less than 0.01). One year after laparoscopy, IBS patients gave lower overall status ratings (P less than 0.01) and lower pain improvement ratings (P less than 0.05) than non-IBS patients. In women who had a hysterectomy for pain, there was less pain improvement one year later in those with the pain subtype of IBS than in non-IBS patients (P less than 0.05). IBS is associated with gynecologic symptoms and affects the symptomatic outcome of diagnostic laparoscopy and hysterectomy. 
4	Clinical perspective on celiprolol: cardioprotective potential. beta-Adrenergic blockers have had widespread use in the treatment of cardiovascular disease. Some agents of this class have been shown to reduce the incidence of total mortality, cardiovascular mortality, sudden death, and nonfatal reinfarction in survivors of acute myocardial infarction. The mechanism for this cardioprotective action is not known. Antiarrhythmic action and hemodynamic alterations have been suggested as possible mechanisms. An anticoagulant mechanism is another possibility, although the antiplatelet effects of beta-blockers are weak. It is now believed that antithrombotic effects may be related to the prevention of coronary artery plaque rupture and the subsequent propagation of an occlusive arterial thrombus rather than a direct anticoagulant action. The therapeutic ability beta-blockers to attenuate the hemodynamic consequences of catecholamine surgers, as they do in aortic dissection, may protect a vulnerable plaque from fracture, reducing the risk of coronary thrombosis, myocardial infarction, and death. Celiprolol, a third-generation beta 1-selective adrenergic blocker with partial beta 2-agonist activity, is comparable to other beta-blockers in antihypertensive and antianginal activity. It has additional actions that may be beneficial to patients: (1) it does not adversely affect lipids and lipoproteins; (2) it does not appear to depress the myocardium in patients with left ventricular dysfunction; (3) it can lower serum fibrinogen levels; and (4) it can cause regression of myocardial mass in patients with left ventricular hypertrophy. 
4	Ultrasound screening of first-degree relatives of patients with an abdominal aortic aneurysm. The pedigrees were constructed of 43 patients (probands) who underwent resection of an abdominal aortic aneurysm. Seven probands (16.2%) had a first-degree relative (parent, sibling, child) known to have had an abdominal aortic aneurysm (multiplex family). To determine the prevalence of undiagnosed abdominal aortic aneurysm, ultrasound screening of first-degree relatives over age 40 years was undertaken. Of 202 eligible relatives, 103 (51.0%) were screened. An occult abdominal aortic aneurysm was defined as an infrarenal aortic diameter greater than 3.0 cm or an infrarenal/suprarenal aortic diameter ratio of greater than 1.5. An incipient abdominal aortic aneurysm was defined as a clear focal bulge of the infrarenal aorta, which was less than 3.0 cm in greatest diameter. Four of 103 relatives (3.9%) were found to have an occult abdominal aortic aneurysm (age/sex: 57M, 60M, 62F, 65M), and three (2.9%) were found with an incipient abdominal aortic aneurysm (age/sex: 56M, 60M, 67F). These smaller abdominal aortic aneurysms were in patients younger than the operated probands (average age men, 67 years; women, 69 years). Six of seven individuals were in families previously considered simplex, increasing the actual multiplex family frequency from 16.2% to 27.9%. All seven new abdominal aortic aneurysms were found in the 49 siblings age 55 years or older. There were no abdominal aortic aneurysms found in the 39 relatives under age 55 years, in 14 children ages 50 to 59 years or in one parent. Therefore of the siblings age 55 years or older, 5/20 men (25.0%) and 2/29 women (6.9%) were found to have a previously undiagnosed abdominal aortic aneurysm. 
1	The vascularized fibula graft in mandibular reconstruction. The use of a vascularized graft from the fibula for mandibular reconstruction is presented. The great strength, pliability, and long vascular pedicle that characterize such grafts make them particularly suitable for this type of repair. The results in six cases were highly satisfactory. Masticatory function was well restored, without alteration of the facial contour, and with minimal sequelae at the donor site. 
5	Reduced allergen-induced nasal congestion and leukotriene synthesis with an orally active 5-lipoxygenase inhibitor BACKGROUND AND METHODS. The clinical importance of leukotrienes in human allergy has not been defined, in part because there have been no selective 5-lipoxygenase inhibitors that have been effective and safe for use in humans. To address the hypothesis that stimulated leukotriene synthesis causes symptoms of immediate-hypersensitivity reactions in vivo, I investigated the effects of a new 5-lipoxygenase inhibitor, A-64077, on provoked allergic nasal symptoms and mediator release in a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled study. Eight subjects with allergic rhinitis underwent nasal challenge on two occasions after an oral dose of 800 mg of A-64077 or an identical-appearing placebo. RESULTS. Allergen-induced nasal congestion was significantly attenuated (P less than 0.02) by A-64077; peak levels of leukotriene B4 (median, 684 pg per milliliter) and 5-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid (median, 704 pg per milliliter) in nasal-rinse fluids were markedly reduced (to 67 and 185 pg per milliliter, respectively; P less than 0.01), whereas levels of prostaglandin D2 were not. Histamine release and sneezing were not reduced significantly by A-64077, but there was a significant correlation (P less than 0.01) between the changes in these variables within subjects. The mean (+/- SEM) stimulated synthesis of leukotriene B4 in whole blood ex vivo was markedly reduced by A-64077 (from 153 +/- 19 to 20 +/- 9 ng per milliliter, P less than 0.01), and the specificity of A-64077 for 5-lipoxygenase inhibition was verified by its lack of effect on the synthesis of serum thromboxane B2 or 12-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid. CONCLUSIONS. These results provide direct evidence of an important role for the 5-lipoxygenase products of arachidonic acid in allergic rhinitis and support the notion that further experiments in this area may lead to new therapeutic approaches to allergic disorders. 
4	Fish oil amplifies the effect of propranolol in mild essential hypertension. Forty-seven male patients with mild essential hypertension were randomly allocated to three subgroups. After a run-in period of 4 weeks, the first subgroup (n = 16) received propranolol (80 mg/day) for 36 weeks followed by a placebo period of 4 weeks. The second subgroup (n = 15), after a run-in period of 4 weeks, was given a supplement of encapsulated fish oil (9 g/day) for 36 weeks with a subsequent period of 4 weeks in which fish oil placebo was given. The third subgroup (n = 16), after a run-in period of 4 weeks, was given propranolol (80 mg/day) for 12 weeks, propranolol (80 mg/day) plus fish oil capsules (9 g/day equivalent to 1.8 g/day of eicosapentaenoic acid and 1.1 g/day of docosahexaenoic acid) for 12 weeks, propranolol plus fish oil placebo (same doses for 12 weeks) with a subsequent period of 4 weeks when propranolol placebo was administered. The results indicate a blood pressure-lowering effect of fish oil, which was comparable with that of propranolol. The simultaneous intake of fish oil plus propranolol was more effective than propranolol or fish oil alone. Propranolol treatment resulted in a decrease of plasma norepinephrine, plasma renin activity, and thromboxane B2 formation. After fish oil supplementation, plasma norepinephrine and thromboxane B2 formation were likewise reduced, whereas plasma renin activity appeared increased. The decrease of serum triglycerides, total and low density lipoprotein cholesterol as well as the rise of high density lipoprotein cholesterol are concomitant beneficial effects, which justify the consideration of fish oil alone or in combination with antihypertensive drugs for the treatment of mild hypertension. 
1	The justification for surgical treatment of metastatic melanoma of the gastrointestinal tract. Fifty-six patients with symptomatic metastatic melanoma of the gastrointestinal tract (GIT) treated surgically at the Sydney Melanoma Unit between 1974 and 1989 were reviewed. The majority of these patients presented with abdominal pain or symptoms of anemia. The small intestine was the site of metastasis in more than 80 per cent. The mean over-all survival time was 11.7 months (range of one to 60 months) after surgical treatment of a first metastasis to the GIT and 3.6 months (range of zero to 12 months) postoperatively for a second GIT metastasis. Forty-four of the patients reported complete relief of their symptoms postoperatively. The results suggest that an aggressive approach to symptomatic GIT metastases from malignant melanoma is justified both to relieve distressing symptoms and to prolong life. 
3	Horner's syndrome from hypothalamic infarction. We report a case of Horner's syndrome due to ipsilateral posterior hypothalamic infarction, occurring in the absence of other signs of hypothalamic dysfunction. Associated symptoms of contralateral faciobrachial weakness and dysarthria correlated with the extension of the infarct into the posterior limb of the internal capsule seen by magnetic resonance imaging. The likely vascular anatomy of this lesion is discussed. 
5	Thyroid antibodies as a risk factor for Down syndrome and other trisomies. To test whether the presence of thyroid antibodies in a parent is a risk factor for meiotic nondisjunction, we measured the levels of thyroid antibodies in serum samples drawn during early pregnancy from 101 gravidas who delivered a child with a trisomy, from 11 gravidas who had had a trisomic child in a previous pregnancy, and from 44 of their husbands. For each case mother, three controls were randomly selected from the same population and matched for age, race, sex of the child, and hospital of birth. Cases and controls came from two longitudinal populations, the Child Health and Development Studies (CHDS) and the national Collaborative Perinatal Project (CPP), together comprising more than 70,000 live births. All cases with both a definite diagnosis of trisomy-Down syndrome (DS) or other-and available serum were included. Overall, there was no association between the presence of thyroid antibodies in a mother and a trisomy in her offspring (odds ratio [OR] = .98, confidence interval [CI] = .54-1.85). The lack of association was seen in all three subgroups (DS only, other trisomies, and DS in a previous pregnancy), in all ethnic groups, and in the age groups of white mothers either less than 30 years of age (OR = .80, CI = .40-1.6) or greater than or equal to 30 years of age (OR = 1.26, CI = .82-1.9). In the CHDS population, case fathers, as compared with control fathers, did not have a higher prevalence of thyroid antibodies. 
5	Natural death as viewed by the medical examiner: a review of 1000 consecutive autopsies of individuals dying of natural disease. A study of 1000 consecutive autopsies of individuals dying of natural disease was conducted. Cardiovascular disease was responsible for 60.9% of all deaths with coronary artery disease--not only the main cause of cardiovascular death but also the main cause of all natural deaths--accounting for 45.1% of such cases. Diseases of the central nervous and respiratory systems accounted for 8.7 and 8.6%, respectively, of the natural deaths. Seizure disorders and pneumonia were the main causes of death in these organ systems. There were 124 deaths of children less than one year in age, 91 of which were due to sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS). All of the SIDS deaths were in children less than 10 months old. 
5	Effects of cisapride in patients with cystic fibrosis and distal intestinal obstruction syndrome. In a double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover trial, we investigated the effects of the prokinetic drug cisapride in patients with cystic fibrosis and chronic recurrent distal intestinal obstruction syndrome (DIOS). After a baseline period, 17 patients (12.9 to 34.9 years; 12 boys) received, in random order, cisapride (7.5 to 10 mg) and placebo three times daily by mouth, each for 6 months. Gastrointestinal symptoms (flatulence, abdominal pain, fullness, abdominal distension, nausea, anorexia, heartburn, diarrhea, vomiting and regurgitation) were scored three times monthly and physical examinations assessed. At baseline and at each 6-month period, assessment included food intake for 7 days, 3-day stool collection, pulmonary function tests, and abdominal radiographs. During cisapride therapy compared with placebo, there were significant reductions in flatulence (p less than 0.005), fullness, and nausea (p less than 0.05). Patients with the worst symptom scores benefited most from cisapride. With cisapride, 12 patients felt better and three worse (p less than 0.05); physicians judged 11 patients improved and two worse (p less than 0.05). No side effects were noted. There were no significant differences between cisapride and placebo periods in nutritional status, x-ray scores, pulmonary function, food intake (fat, protein, calories), stool size and consistency, and fecal losses of fat, bile acids, chymotrypsin, and calories. For acute episodes of DIOS, intestinal lavage was needed 6 times in 4 patients during treatment with cisapride, and 11 times in 6 patients receiving placebo. In comparison with unselected patients with cystic fibrosis and pancreatic insufficiency who were receiving enzyme supplements and who had no distal intestinal obstruction, fecal fat losses (percentage of intake) were almost twice as high in the study group with DIOS (31.2 +/- 20.6% vs 16.2 +/- 17.6%; p less than 0.01). We conclude that in the dosage used, long-term treatment with cisapride appears to improve chronic abdominal symptoms in patients with cystic fibrosis and DIOS, but fails to abolish the need for intestinal lavage. Cisapride treatment had no effect on digestion and nutritional status of cystic fibrosis patients with pancreatic insufficiency. 
2	Serum amylase in patients with renal insufficiency and renal failure. Results vary with regard to the upper limits of serum amylase seen in patients with renal failure, and very little has been reported with patients with renal insufficiency not yet requiring dialysis. To determine the level of serum amylase elevation in renal insufficiency and renal failure, we determined serum amylase values in 128 subjects with creatinine clearances less than 90 ml/min. Serum amylase remained in the normal range when creatinine clearance was greater than 50 ml/min, and did not become elevated until creatinine clearance was less than 50 ml/min. The highest serum amylase recorded in the absence of acute pancreatitis was 503 IU/L (normal, less than 128 IU/L). Serum lipase and trypsin values paralleled those for serum amylase; values remained normal when creatinine clearance was greater than 50 ml/min, and were normal or elevated when creatinine clearance was less than 50 ml/min. These results indicate that elevations of serum amylase (i.e., amylase greater than 128 but less than 500 IU/L) in asymptomatic patients with impaired renal function are not evident until creatinine clearances fall below 50 ml/min, and probably do not represent acute pancreatitis. 
5	Leukoaraiosis, intracerebral hemorrhage, and arterial hypertension. To investigate whether the observed association of leukoaraiosis with intracerebral hemorrhage is direct or mediated by risk factors, we compared 116 patients with intracerebral hemorrhage confirmed by computed tomography and 155 controls without intracerebral hemorrhage, evaluating the prevalence of leukoaraiosis and vascular risk factors. Leukoaraiosis was observed in 21 (18%) of the 116 patients and in 12 (8%) of the 155 controls (p less than 0.01). Only two (6%) of the 31 patients with lobar hemorrhage had leukoaraiosis on computed tomograms, compared with 17 (24%) of the 71 patients with basal ganglionic hemorrhage (p less than 0.05). Leukoaraiosis was significantly correlated with intracerebral hemorrhage after controlling for age and sex by using multiple logistic regression analysis, while the correlation disappeared after controlling for hypertension. Our results indicate that leukoaraiosis is not an independent risk factor for intracerebral hemorrhage. 
5	New approaches in the rehabilitation of the traumatic high level quadriplegic. The use of noninvasive alternatives to tracheostomy for ventilatory support have been described in the patient management of various neuromuscular disorders. The use of these techniques for patients with traumatic high level quadriplegia, however, is hampered by the resort to tracheostomy in the acute hospital setting. Twenty traumatic high level quadriplegic patients on intermittent positive pressure ventilation (IPPV) via tracheostomy with little or no ability for unassisted breathing were converted to noninvasive ventilatory support methods and had their tracheostomy sites closed. Four additional patients were ventilated by noninvasive methods without tracheostomy. These methods included the use of body ventilators and the noninvasive intermittent positive airway pressure alternatives of IPPV via the mouth, nose, or custom acrylic strapless oral-nasal interface (SONI). Overnight end-tidal pCO2 studies and monitoring of oxyhemoglobin saturation (SaO2) were used to adjust ventilator volumes and to document effective ventilation during sleep. No significant complications have resulted from the use of these methods over a period of 45 patient-years. Elimination of the tracheostomy permitted significant free time by glossopharyngeal breathing for four patients, two of whom had no measurable vital capacity. We conclude that noninvasive ventilatory support alternatives can be effective and deserve further study in this patient population. 
4	Diagnosis of left atrial thrombi in mitral valve disease by coronary arteriography. Arteriographic findings of neovascularity and fistula formation between coronary arteries and left atrium have occasionally been described in association with left atrial thrombosis in patients with mitral valve disease. The validity of these coronary arteriographic findings in diagnosis of atrial thrombi has been evaluated in 112 patients with mitral valve disease. Comparison was made with surgery. The study furnished these diagnostic values: sensitivity 70%, specificity 85%, positive predictive value 72%. Even if this angiographic finding is complementary in diagnosis of atrial thrombosis, its identification during coronary arteriography in patients with mitral valve disease is useful. Its detection could improve diagnostic prediction of thrombosis, especially in patients without previous embolic events or where echocardiography failed to reveal thrombi. 
5	Nasolacrimal obstruction after inferior meatus nasal antrostomy. Transient epiphora following rhinoplasty or intranasal procedures is a common occurrence. Permanent nasolacrimal duct obstruction, however, is rare. This article documents four cases of nasolacrimal duct obstruction following intranasal antrostomy. Three patients were cured by dacryocystorhinostomy and a fourth refused surgery. The anatomy of the nasolacrimal duct in the inferior meatus has considerable variation. Although the duct typically opens in the inferior meatus immediately under the insertion of the inferior turbinate, the orifice can be a single hole, a slit, multiple holes, or a trough, and can be located anywhere from 30 to 40 mm dorsal to the anterior nares. We review the embryology and anatomy of the nasolacrimal orifice in the nose and make recommendations for safe surgery in the inferior meatus. 
2	The role of methanethiol in the pathogenesis of hepatic encephalopathy. Mixed disulfides of methanethiol represent a relative estimate for an exposure to methanethiol. The concentrations of methanethiol-mixed disulfides, methionine, 4-methylthio-2-oxobutyrate and ammonia were measured in patients with different stages of hepatic encephalopathy, in patients with chronic kidney failure and in healthy subjects. In patients with hepatic encephalopathy, the mean serum concentrations of all these compounds were elevated. However, the elevations of methanethiol-mixed disulfides were small and partly caused by decreased renal function. In addition, the levels of methanethiol-mixed disulfides did not differ significantly between the different grades of hepatic encephalopathy. The concentrations of methanethiol-mixed disulfides were substantially lower than those previously observed in healthy subjects after an oral methionine load or in a patient with a deficiency in methionine adenosyltransferase, the latter without causing encephalopathy. We concluded that the role of methanethiol in the pathogenesis of hepatic encephalopathy is probably minor, if not insignificant. In the patients with hepatic encephalopathy, a significant correlation was found between the concentrations of methionine and 4-methylthio-2-oxobutyrate and between 4-methylthio-2-oxobutyrate and methanethiol-mixed disulfides, supporting the theory that methanethiol is formed by way of the methionine transamination pathway. Evidence is provided that, besides the methionine transsulfuration pathway, the transamination pathway is also impaired in patients with hepatic encephalopathy. 
5	Nd:YAG-laser in the microsurgery of frontobasal meningiomas. Forty-three patients with big frontobasal meningiomas underwent a microsurgical removal of the tumor. The 1.32 microns Nd:YAG-laser has proved useful in this prospective series particularly with the contactless shrinkage of the tumors and the necrotization of the dural and bony attachments. Tumor shrinkage was achieved by radiating the tumor surface with the Nd:YAG-laser. This technique facilitated the microsurgical dissection and reduced the blood loss by half. The Nd:YAG-laser necrotization of the dural and bony attachments reduced the recurrence rate following grade two resections from 20% to zero. The postoperative quality of life was excellent with a complete rehabilitation in 76% of the patients. The use of the 1.32 microns Nd:YAG-laser improved significantly the results of microsurgery for frontobasal meningioma. 
5	Salvage from cardiogenic shock by atherectomy after failed emergency coronary artery angioplasty. In this case report of a patient undergoing angioplasty for cardiogenic shock during acute myocardial infarction, recurrent occlusion resulted in recurrence of shock. Atherectomy reestablished lasting patency and reversed the patient's hemodynamic collapse. Atherectomy deserves further investigation as a means to salvage vessel patency during unsuccessful coronary angioplasty. 
1	Hormonal dependency of cerebral meningiomas. Part 2: In vitro effect of steroids, bromocriptine, and epidermal growth factor on growth of meningiomas. Cell culture and biochemical techniques have been employed to examine the effects of steroids, bromocriptine, and epidermal growth factor (EGF) on the growth and proliferative potential of meningiomas. In cell culture, the growth of meningiomas was not altered by progestogens, antiprogestogens, or 17beta-estradiol. The progestogen, norethisterone, had no effect on the uptake by meningiomas cell cultures of 3H-thymidine. Furthermore, cytosolic deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) polymerase activity of meningiomas did not correlate with the progesterone receptor status of the same tumors. In contrast, the androgen antagonists, cyproterone acetate and 11-alpha-hydroxyprogesterone, and the dopamine agonist, bromocriptine, all inhibited the in vitro growth of meningioma cells. The growth of meningioma cell cultures was stimulated by EGF, and there was a positive correlation between the EGF content and DNA polymerase activity in meningioma cytosols. These results demonstrate that female sex steroids do not influence growth of meningiomas in vitro, whereas antiandrogens and bromocriptine have an antiproliferative effect. Consequently, bromocriptine and antiandrogens may have a role in the medical treatment of meningiomas. In addition, these results suggest that EGF may be involved in the genesis and/or progression of meningiomas. 
4	Prognostic importance of delayed Q-wave evolution 3 to 24 hours after initiation of thrombolytic therapy for acute myocardial infarction. The timing of Q-wave evolution and its prognostic significance was studied in 201 patients who received thrombolytic therapy for a first acute myocardial infarction (AMI). One hundred forty-one patients (70%) had evidence of a Q-wave AMI within 3 hours of the initiation of thrombolytic therapy, 31 (16%) developed Q waves after 3 hours but before hospital discharge, and 29 (14%) were discharged with a non-Q-wave AMI. Laboratory indicators of myocardial damage and in-hospital morbidity and mortality were greater among patients with Q-wave AMIs than with non-Q-wave AMIs. When these indexes were examined with respect to the timing of Q-wave evolution, the prognosis of patients with delayed Q-wave development was similar to that of patients with non-Q-wave AMIs. Thus, compared to patients with early (less than or equal to 3 hours) Q-wave evolution, patients with delayed Q-wave evolution or with a non-Q-wave AMI had a smaller creatine kinase peak (mean 661 to 1,081 vs 1,251 to 1,541 IU; p = 0.005), better preservation of left ventricular function as measured by radionuclide ventriculography before discharge (mean +/- standard deviation 54 +/- 11% vs 47 +/- 13%; p less than 0.01), and a lower incidence of congestive heart failure at discharge (3 vs 15%; p = 0.02). In-hospital mortality was lower among patients with delayed Q-wave evolution or with a non-Q-wave AMI (5 of 141 vs 0 of 60; difference not significant). 
4	Efficacy and safety of low- and high-dose sotalol versus propranolol in the prevention of supraventricular tachyarrhythmias early after coronary artery bypass operations. Supraventricular tachyarrhythmias are reported in up to 40% of patients early after coronary artery bypass graft operations. In a randomized study, we compared the efficacy and safety of the class III antiarrhythmic beta-blocking drug sotalol versus propranolol at low and high doses in the prevention of supraventricular tachyarrhythmias in 429 consecutive patients after coronary artery bypass graft operations. Patients with severely depressed left ventricular function and other contraindications for beta-blockers were excluded. From the fourth hour up to the sixth day after coronary artery bypass, 74 patients received low-dose sotalol (40 mg every 8 hours), 66 patients low-dose propranolol (10 mg every 6 hours), 133 patients high-dose sotalol (80 mg every 8 hours), and 156 patients high-dose propranolol (20 mg every 6 hours). Baseline characteristics were comparable in all groups. Supraventricular tachyarrhythmia was observed in 10 of 72 (13.9%) who received low-dose sotalol, 12 of 64 (18.8%) who received low-dose propranolol, 13 of 119 (10.9%) who received high-dose sotalol, and 19 of 139 (13.7%) who received high-dose propranolol (not significant). Drug-related adverse effects necessitating discontinuation of the drug occurred in four receiving low doses (2.9%) and in 31 receiving high doses (10.7%) (p less than 0.02). In conclusion, no medication was found to be superior, although supraventricular tachyarrhythmias tended to be less prevalent in patients treated with sotalol than in those treated with propranolol. Moreover, significantly fewer adverse effects were noted in both low-dose groups. Therefore, low-dose beta-blocking treatment, especially low-dose sotalol, seems preferable. 
4	Nephrotoxicity of allopurinol is enhanced in experimental hypertension. Hyperuricemia is present in 20-40% of pediatric and adult patients with essential hypertension. This metabolic abnormality may represent an additional risk factor for the development of cardiovascular disease. Therefore, we performed the following studies to determine 1) whether hyperuricemia is more prevalent in the spontaneously hypertensive rat (SHR) and 2) whether allopurinol treatment has a beneficial effect on the development of hypertension in this strain, based on its capacity to lower the serum uric acid concentration and to act as an antioxidant agent. SHR and control Wistar-Kyoto (WKY) rats were assigned to two groups, one given tap water to drink and the other provided water containing allopurinol (400 mg/l) to furnish an approximate daily dose equal to 100 mg/kg body wt. This treatment was maintained for 15 weeks. The serum uric acid levels were similar in untreated SHR and WKY rats (1.85 +/- 0.10 versus 1.66 +/- 0.14 mg/dl; p = 0.28). In the control WKY rat strain, allopurinol therapy did not adversely affect weight gain or hematocrit and did not cause an increase in mortality. It resulted in a moderate decrement in kidney function (creatinine clearance: allopurinol-treated group 0.32 +/- 0.09 versus control group 0.46 +/- 0.04 ml/min/100 g body wt, in conjunction with mild-to-moderate tubulointerstitial inflammation (allopurinol-treated group 0.9 +/- 0.4 versus control group 0). 
3	Extrageniculate vision in hemianopic humans: saccade inhibition by signals in the blind field. The functional competence of extrageniculate visual pathways in hemianopic humans was demonstrated by showing that distractor signals in the blind half of the visual field could inhibit saccades toward targets in the intact visual field. This inhibitory effect of unseen distractors in patients occurred only when distractors were presented in the temporal half of the visual field, was specific to oculomotor responses, and did not occur in normal subjects. These results show that a peripheral visual signal activates retinotectal pathways to prime the oculomotor system and that these pathways can mediate orienting behavior in hemianopic humans. 
3	Long-term morphology of spastic or flaccid muscles in spinal cord-transected rabbits. Despite difficulty in long-term maintenance of spinalized rabbits, muscular pathologic changes in chronic spinalized rabbits could be observed for a period of four weeks. Rabbits were prepared by spinal cord transection at T10 (spastic paralysis) or by spinal cord removal below L7 (flaccid paralysis). Spastic preparations showed hind-limb spasticity and reflex incontinence one to two days after operation. Hypertrophic fibers began to appear in spastic muscles after two weeks. This hypertrophy, thought to be caused by phasic repetitive contraction, was verified by electron microscopy to be different from normal exercise hypertrophy. Flaccid preparations maintained hind-limb flaccidity and overflow incontinence. In flaccid muscle, marked muscle fiber necrosis indicated rapid atrophy. Spinal deformity and joint contracture inactivate spinalized rabbits, and cause pressure sores. However, feeding assistance and avoidance of complications make long-term maintenance possible. 
5	Embryo reduction in multifetal pregnancies after infertility therapy: obstetrical risks and perinatal benefits are related to operative strategy. To assess the benefits that can be expected from embryo reduction of multiple pregnancies after infertility therapy, we report 58 consecutive cases of selective termination using either a transcervical or a transabdominal approach. The initial number of embryos was five or more in 13 patients, four in 29 patients, and three in 15 patients. The miscarriage rate after transabdominal procedures (23%) was one half of that after transcervical aspiration. Forty pregnancies resulted in the live birth of one child or more. The rate of prematurity was strongly related to the number of embryos left. Mean gestational age at birth was 35.5 weeks but reached 37.7 weeks when only one embryo was left. A reduction in premature birth after selective termination appeared clear for pregnancies with four or more embryos but was less significant for triplets. 
1	Clear cell adenocarcinoma of the vagina and cervix. A report of the Central Netherlands Registry with emphasis on early detection and prognosis. The Central Netherlands Registry (CNR) of women with vaginal or cervical clear cell adenocarcinoma (CCAC) was established in 1985. An overview is presented of clinical and pathologic data of 55 patients who were registered at the CNR until July 1, 1988. All Netherlands Departments of Pathology (NDP) maintain a patient registry and 95% of the Institutes are connected with a Central Archive via a computer network. The histologic slides and clinical status were reviewed at the CNR. Twenty-five tumors were classified as vaginal carcinoma and 30 as cervical carcinoma. The mean age of the patients was 22 years. Fifty-five percent of patients (63% of patients with known maternal history) were exposed to diethylstilbestrol (DES) in utero. The majority of cases was initially diagnosed after 1980. Cytologic examination before the initial histologic diagnosis indicated that cervical tumors were detected in 80% of cases, but vaginal tumors were detected only in 33% of cases. It was concluded that an examination of DES-exposed women should consist of colposcopic inspection of the cervix and vagina, cytologic examination of the cervix and four quadrants of the vagina, and careful palpation of the cervix and the entire vaginal wall. The most important prognostic parameter for patients with CCAC was stage and grade of nuclear atypia. The results of a statistical analysis showed that these features were the most effective to distinguish between nonsurvivors and patients surviving more than 5 years. 
1	Epithelial cyst of the fourth ventricle. Case report. A case of epithelial cyst in the fourth ventricle of a 4-year-old child is described. A single epithelial layer with a clear basement membrane lining the cyst wall was observed. There were no prominent histological findings to suggest a pathogenesis for this cyst based on immunohistochemical or ultrastructural studies; however, the cyst fluid contained significant amounts of carcinoembryonic antigen. It is considered that the epithelial layer lining the cyst wall was possibly of endodermal origin. 
4	Comparison of pulse oximeters: accuracy at low arterial pressure in volunteers. A laboratory model was developed of limb hypoperfusion in volunteers, using parital occlusion of the brachial artery with consequent reduction in radial artery pulse pressure. This was used to compare the function of 13 pulse oximeters and the effect of reduced pulse pressure and mild hypoxia on these devices. With the exception of one device, all the pulse oximeters studied demonstrated similar accuracies at pulse pressures exceeding 20 mm Hg. There were however, significant differences between several of the pulse oximeters in both ability to display readings and accuracy of readings displayed when brachial artery occlusion reduced radial artery pulse pressures equal to or less than 20 mm Hg. 
3	Glucagon: prehospital therapy for hypoglycemia. STUDY OBJECTIVE: This study evaluated the efficacy of glucagon for prehospital therapy of hypoglycemia in patients without IV access. DESIGN: Prospective clinical trial. SETTING: Prehospital in a busy, urban emergency medical services system. TYPE OF PARTICIPANTS: Fifty consecutive patients presenting with documented hypoglycemia (ChemStrip BG less than or equal to 80 mg/dL) and symptoms of decreased level of consciousness, syncope, or seizure were enrolled. MEASURES AND MAIN RESULTS: Data collected included pretreatment (ChemStrip BG) and post-treatment serum glucose (hospital assay) as well as assessment of level of consciousness by a quantitative measure, the Glasgow Coma Score, and by a qualitative scale (0 to 3). The mean pretreatment blood glucose of 33.2 +/- 23.3 mg/dL increased after treatment to 133.3 +/- 57.3 mg/dL. Qualitative level of consciousness increased from a mean of 1.26 +/- .96 to 2.42 +/- .94 and Glasgow Coma Score increased from a mean of 9.0 +/- 4.19 to 13.04 +/- 3.68. The mean time until response was 8.8 minutes in those who responded to both level of consciousness criteria 82% (41 of 50). Glucagon administered for hypoglycemia resulted in a glucose increase in 98% (49 of 50) with headache as the only side effect noted in 4% (two of 50) of patients (P less than .0001). CONCLUSION: Glucagon is safe and effective therapy for hypoglycemia in the prehospital setting. 
5	Hemolytic transfusion reaction following transfusion of frozen and washed autologous red cells A case of hemolytic transfusion reaction, accompanied by hypotension and followed by transient renal failure, occurred after the transfusion of 1 unit of previously frozen autologous red cells. Subsequent investigation revealed the probable cause of the hemolysis to be inadequate deglycerolization of the unit. The cause of the associated symptoms is unknown. Possibilities include nephrotoxic effects of hemoglobin or stroma, toxic effects of glycerol, or release of vasoactive or thrombogenic substances from lysed red cells. This case of a hemolytic reaction adds to the known risks of autologous transfusion. 
5	Severe cerebral and systemic necrotizing vasculitis developing during pregnancy in a case of systemic lupus erythematosus. We describe a fatal case of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) developing cerebral and systemic necrotizing vasculitis during pregnancy. The patient was discovered to have SLE at 14 weeks' gestation. Although the symptoms disappeared without treatment with corticosteroid in the 2nd trimester, she presented with meningoencephalitis due to vasculitis in the 3rd trimester. Polyarteritis nodosa (PAN)-like necrotizing vasculitis of the small muscular arteries and arterioles, with acute and healing lesions in the leptomeninges, brain parenchyma and visceral organs was observed at postpartum autopsy. PAN-like vasculitis in the central nervous system is quite rare in SLE. This case is also suggestive in terms of the influence of pregnancy on the activity of SLE. 
1	Expression of class II molecules on intestinal epithelial cells in humans. Differences between normal and inflammatory bowel disease. Expression of class II antigens on human intestinal epithelial cells was assessed using a sensitive avidinbiotin-peroxidase technique. HLA-DR was present predominantly in the normal small bowel with diminished but evident expression in the colon. HLA-DP staining was less prominent, and HLA-DQ was absent. In inflammatory bowel disease the expression of both HLA-DR and HLA-DP was increased, but that for HLA-DQ remained absent, suggesting an inherent defect in the ability of intestinal epithelial cells to express HLA-DQ. In related experiments, an interferon gamma-treated malignant epithelial cell line T84 also failed to stain for HLA-DQ and HLA-DP despite the presence of HLA-DR. Isolated RNAs for all three subclasses of HLA-D were detectable by slot-blot analysis, suggesting that the lack of HLA-DQ expression relates to posttranscriptional defects in intestinal epithelium. These and other differences with conventional class II antigen-positive accessory cells (macrophages/B cells) may help to explain the unique properties of intestinal epithelial cells as antigen-presenting cells. 
5	Effect of intraesophageal location and muscarinic blockade on balloon distension-induced chest pain. Intraesophageal balloon distension has been introduced recently as a provocative test in the assessment of patients with noncardiac chest pain. In order to examine the effect of balloon location and muscarinic blockade on distension-induced pain, 10 asymptomatic male volunteers were studied on two separate days using a low-compliance perfused manometry system that incorporated a silicone rubber balloon. Five-second-duration balloon distensions using balloon volumes of 2.5, 5, 7.5, and 10 ml of air were performed with the balloon located both 16 cm (proximal site) and 6 cm (distal site) above the lower esophageal sphincter (LES) before and after administration of atropine (10 micrograms/kg intravenously) or placebo in a randomized double-blind fashion. A standardized scoring system was used to assess the balloon distension-induced pain. Pain scores varied directly with balloon volume but were consistently higher with the balloon located at the proximal site versus the distal site. This was not associated with any differences in intraballoon pressures between the two sites; however, contraction amplitude orad to the balloon was greater with balloon distension at the proximal site. Atropine significantly decreased pain sensation scores with the balloon located distally but not proximally. This attenuation was not associated with significant changes in intraballoon pressures; however, contractions orad to the balloon were markedly inhibited by atropine with distal but not with proximal distension. These studies indicate that balloon distension-induced pain varies depending on the location of distension. This difference is not explained by differences in esophageal wall tension at the site of distension. 
5	Chloroprocaine antagonism of epidural opioid analgesia: a receptor-specific phenomenon? Sixty healthy patients scheduled for elective cesarean delivery under epidural anesthesia were randomized to receive either lidocaine or 2-chloroprocaine as the primary local anesthetic agent. When patients first complained of postoperative pain in the recovery room, they were given either fentanyl 50 micrograms or butorphanol 2 mg, epidurally, in a randomized, blinded fashion. Postoperative analgesia, quantitated on a visual analogue scale, as well as time elapsed until first request for supplemental opioid, did not differ for patients receiving butorphanol after either 2-chloroprocaine or lidocaine anesthesia. In contrast, epidural fentanyl produced a shorter and lesser degree of sensory analgesia after 2-chloroprocaine use, whereas epidural fentanyl after lidocaine anesthesia provided pain relief similar to that seen in the butorphanol groups. Side effects were limited to somnolence with butorphanol and pruritus with fentanyl. No evidence of respiratory depression was seen in any patient. We conclude that 2 mg of butorphanol epidurally provides approximately 2 to 3 h of effective analgesia after cesarean delivery with either lidocaine or 2-chloroprocaine anesthesia. Epidural fentanyl seems to be antagonized when 2-chloroprocaine, but not lidocaine, is used as the primary local anesthetic agent. We suggest a possible mu-receptor-specific etiology for this effect. 
5	Diagnosis of obstructive sleep apnea. The diagnosis of obstructive sleep apnea is frequently made by taking a meticulous history coupled with a high index of suspicion. Snoring and hypersomnolence are clinical features common to individuals with sleep apnea. Since snoring is said to be a "disease of listeners," it is not uncommon that bed partners reported an increased incidence of depression and marital displeasure. It is for this reason that the spouse or bed partner should be interviewed, since the patient may not be aware of any sleeping problems. Physicians should also be alert to complaints of excessive daytime somnolence, because studies have shown that patients with obstructive sleep apnea are at increased risk for automobile crashes. It has been estimated that approx 58,000 motor vehicle accidents involving people with sleep apnea will occur in the US each yr. By proper diagnosis and treatment, the physician is in a unique position to prevent at least some of the automobile accidents that result from falling asleep while driving. Polysomnography is the only definitive way to obtain a diagnosis of sleep apnea. This allows the physician not only to diagnosis the disorder, but also helps in the evaluation of the severity of the syndrome and selection of therapy. An ENT evaluation is also important in ruling out anatomic disorders that can cause upper airway obstruction. Certain factors, such as alcohol and sedative ingestion, may aggravate the condition in a person predisposed to sleep apnea, and subtle changes, such as unexplained hypertension, polycythemia, and cor pulmonale, should lead one to investigate the possibility of sleep apnea as the etiology. 
5	Transformed and nontransformed cells differ in stability and cell cycle regulation of a binding activity to the murine thymidine kinase promoter. A DNA binding activity to an upstream region of the murine thymidine kinase gene is regulated differently in a transformed and nontransformed cell line pair. Differences in regulation were observed (i) after serum levels were reduced, (ii) when serum levels were returned to initial high levels, and (iii) while protein synthesis was inhibited. After reduction of serum levels, the binding activity was unstable in nontransformed BALB/c 3T3 clone A31 cells but was significantly more stable in benzo[a]pyrene-transformed BALB/c 3T3 cells. After serum concentration was returned to high levels, the kinetic pattern of the binding activity differed between nontransformed and transformed cells. While protein synthesis was inhibited, the binding activity was unstable in nontransformed cells and stable in transformed cells. Partial inhibition of protein synthesis--a more stringent condition to test instability--prevented the induction of the binding activity in nontransformed cells. Previously, the labile protein hypothesis set forth the criterion that a protein regulating the onset of DNA synthesis should be unstable in nontransformed cells and stable in transformed cells. The DNA binding activity described here satisfies this criterion. 
1	Mucinous cystadenoma of the lung. A report of two cases with immunohistochemical and ultrastructural analysis. We describe two patients who presented with solitary pulmonary masses that consisted of unilocular cysts lined by columnar mucinous epithelium. The cysts contained copious mucus. The epithelial lining of the cysts showed foci of stratification and papillary infolding. Histologically identical lesions have previously been termed unusual mucous cysts or mucinous cystadenomas. We believe that these tumors are true neoplasms differentiating toward the respiratory epithelial mucous cell. They should be distinguished from a variety of pulmonary neoplasms including bronchoalveolar carcinoma, bronchial mucous gland adenoma, mucoepidermoid carcinoma, and metastatic adenocarcinoma. 
3	Brain death and organ donation in a neurosurgical unit: audit of recent practice OBJECTIVE--To assess the potential for increasing the yield of donors by comparing the current pattern of brain death and organ donation in a neurosurgical unit with that reported in 1981 and with a recent national audit. DESIGN--Retrospective review of all deaths for 1986, 1987, and 1988 and prospective data for 1989. SETTING--A regional neurosurgical unit serving 2.7 million population. RESULTS--Of 553 deaths, 35% (191) patients died while on a ventilator and 17% (92) after discontinuation of ventilation. Medical contraindications to donation were found in 23% (32) of 141 patients tested for brain death, in 38% (19) of 50 patients who died while being ventilated who were not tested, and in 12% (11) of 92 patients no longer being ventilated. Consent for donation was sought in 88% (96) of 109 medically suitable brain dead patients and granted in 70% (67) of these. Half those with permission for multiorgan donation had only the kidneys removed. CONCLUSIONS--More organs may be lost owing to transplant team logistics than by failure to seek consent from relatives of brain dead patients. The estimated size of the pool of potential donors depends on what types of patients might be considered. Ensuring that all who die while being ventilated are tested for brain death and considering the potential for donation before withdrawing ventilation could yield more donors. Ventilating more patients who are hopelessly brain damaged to secure more donors raises ethical and economic issues. 
1	Overexpression of HER-2/neu in endometrial cancer is associated with advanced stage disease. Prior studies have shown that overexpression of HER-2/neu occurs in one third of breast and ovarian cancers and that overexpression is associated with poor prognosis. We used a monoclonal antibody to assess immunohistochemically the level of HER-2/neu expression in normal and malignant endometrium. In 24 normal endometrial samples light to moderate (1+ to 2+) staining for HER-2/neu was seen in the glands, and there was no variation in intensity of staining during the menstrual cycle. Among 95 endometrial adenocarcinomas, nine (9%) were found to have heavier staining for HER-2/neu than was seen in normal endometrium (3+). High expression of HER-2/neu was found in 27% of patients with metastatic disease compared with 4% of patients with disease confined to the uterus (p less than 0.005). High HER-2/neu expression also was associated with absence of estrogen receptor (p less than 0.005) and with increased mortality from cancer. Further studies are needed to determine the significance of HER-2/neu overexpression in endometrial cancer. 
3	Modification of stroke susceptibility by genotype-dependent maternal influences. The influence of the prenatal and postnatal maternal environment on stroke susceptibility was evaluated by reciprocally crossing the spontaneously hypertensive (SHR) and the Dahl salt-sensitive (SS/Jr) inbred rat strains to produce reciprocal F1 hybrids that were nurtured, respectively, during prenatal and postnatal life by SHR or SS/Jr mothers. Following placement on a high-salt diet containing 8% NaCl at 35 days of age, F1 rats reared by SHR mothers had shorter survival times and were more likely to die with cerebral hemorrhage than F1s reared by SS/Jrs. Across reciprocal F1 female groups, enhanced susceptibility to stroke was associated with greater elevations of systolic blood pressure, but this association was not seen across reciprocal F1 male groups. There was also an association between blood pressure and stroke within each F1/gender subgroup: Rats eventually suffering strokes developed higher blood pressure after placement on the high-salt diet than rats that did not suffer stroke. Lower day 35 body weights (before exposure to the high-salt diet) were associated with greater likelihood of stroke both across the reciprocal F1 groups, and within three of the four F1/gender subgroups. The differences in stroke susceptibility between the reciprocal F1 groupings may be due to systematic differences in the prenatal and/or postnatal environments of SHR and SS/Jr mothers and may be mediated by variations in the nutritive capacity of the two inbred mothers. 
1	Absence of estrogen receptors in dysplastic nevi and malignant melanoma. Benign nevi, dysplastic nevi, and primary and metastatic malignant melanomas were evaluated for the presence of sex hormone binding and estrogen receptor protein. We have confirmed the observation of Ellis et al. that some pigmented lesions possess sex hormone-binding proteins. We could not demonstrate a true estrogen receptor in any benign nevi, dysplastic nevi, primary melanomas, or metastatic melanomas. Thus the ability to bind estrogen or progesterone does not correlate with the presence of a true estrogen receptor. Lack of nuclear estrogen receptors suggests that the influence of estrogen on the pathophysiology of melanoma or of benign melanocytic nevi may not be significant. 
5	Memory-contingent saccades and the substantia nigra postulate for essential blepharospasm. Essential blepharospasm and cranial dystonia are related focal dystonias of unknown aetiology. Blepharospasm induced by acute dopamine depletion in parkinsonism restricts saccade initiation possibly via the substantia nigra pars reticulata (SNpr). If essential blepharospasm and cranial dystonia similarly restrict saccades, then a selective, somatotopically arranged pathway such as the SNpr may be involved. To test this possibility memory-contingent and visually-guided saccades were measured in patients with essential blepharospasm and cranial dystonia. The latency of both forms of saccades was either significantly prolonged or excessively variable, while the accuracy and peak velocity of these fast eye movements were similar to age-matched control subjects. Essential blepharospasm and cranial dystonia alter the initiation of saccadic eye movements. Subcortical brain regions or pathways where eyelid, saccade and cranial/cervical motor control are somatotopically approximated, such as the SNpr, may be involved in blepharospasm. 
5	Itraconazole therapy for nonmeningeal coccidioidomycosis: clinical and laboratory observations. Itraconazole, a new oral triazole antifungal agent, was administered in 75 courses to patients with chronic coccidioidomycosis at dosages of 50 to 400 mg/day for a median duration of 10 months. Assessment of efficacy was made with a standardized scoring system. Responses were seen in 42 of 58 assessable courses (72%). Nonresponse occurred exclusively in patients who had failed previous therapy and was most common in pulmonary disease. Toxicity was minimal at the doses studied. Pharmacokinetic analysis of itraconazole in serum at steady state showed negligible circadian variation; differences in serum concentrations among patients were large. Clinical isolates of Coccidioides immitis showed uniform in vitro susceptibility to itraconazole. Itraconazole shows impressive activity in this series of patients with refractory coccidioidomycosis. Further evaluation of itraconazole in this and in other systemic mycoses is in order. 
2	Improved scintigraphic assessment of severe cholestasis with the hepatic extraction fraction. In previous studies, we found that biliary scintigraphy with technetium-99m-labeled iminodiacetic acid ([99mTc]IDA) provided excellent discrimination between intrahepatic and extrahepatic cholestasis, except in patients with profound cholestasis who had poor visualization of the biliary tree. In this study, we have used deconvolution analysis to determine the hepatic extraction fraction (HEF) of a hypothetical single circulatory pass of [99mTc]IDA. Our hypothesis was that extraction of radionuclide from the blood would be normal in patients with extrahepatic obstruction alone, but would be impaired in patients with intrahepatic disease (IHD). The purpose of this study was to compare the HEF in patients with profound cholestasis (bilirubin greater than or equal to 3.0 mg/dl) due to either IHD or common bile duct obstruction (CBDO). Normal subjects (N = 13) had an HEF of 100%. Patients with CBDO (N = 13) had slightly reduced HEF values (92.8 +/- 3.2%) despite profound hyperbilirubinemia (6.1 +/- 1.0 mg/dl). Patients with IHD (N = 23) had a markedly reduced HEF (43.1 +/- 4.1%) which was significantly lower than patients with CBDO and normal subjects (P less than 0.001). We conclude that the determination of the HEF during biliary scintigraphy is helpful in distinguishing between intrahepatic and extrahepatic disease in patients with hyperbilirubinemia (bilirubin greater than or equal to 3.0 mg/dl). 
3	Local anesthesia for neonatal circumcisions: are family practice residents likely to use it? Dorsal penile nerve block with lidocaine (DPNB) is a local anesthetic technique for neonatal circumcision which is both effective and consistent with ethical concerns for infant welfare. As such, it should be included in training programs that prepare residents to care for newborns. To assess the current level of DPNB use by residents in a family practice training program and to identify attitudes and other factors that relate to use, a survey was sent to 127 residents in the Department of Family Practice and Community Health, University of Minnesota. Of the 101 respondents, 55% had used DPNB, and 17% could be characterized as high users, employing the technique for over one half of the circumcisions they performed. Residents with comprehensive understanding of the newborn's capacity to feel pain were more likely to be using DPNB than their less well-informed counterparts. Four factors were identified as predicting use: cooperation of nursery staff for the procedure, accessibility of instruction in PNB technique, belief that PNB is effective in reducing infant pain, and likelihood of parents giving consent for PNB. These results suggest strategies which may be implemented by family practice educators who wish to promote the principles and techniques of DPNB. 
3	Choroid plexus tumors in the breast cancer-sarcoma syndrome. Choroid plexus neoplasms are rare epithelial tumors of the central nervous system. A carcinoma of the choroid plexus occurred in a child from a family with the breast cancer-sarcoma syndrome (Li-Fraumeni or SBLA syndrome), an inherited condition characterized by the development of diverse neoplasms (sarcoma, breast cancer, brain tumors, leukemia, adrenal cortical carcinoma, and others). Choroid plexus carcinomas were identified in two kindreds previously reported with the syndrome. The literature contains reports of choroid plexus neoplasms occurring in families and in individuals with multiple primary tumors. Choroid plexus neoplasm may be a manifestation of the inherited proclivity to tumor development in the breast cancer-sarcoma syndrome. 
5	Blue breath holding is benign. In their recent publication in this journal, Southall et al described typical cyanotic breath holding spells, both in otherwise healthy children and in those with brainstem lesions and other malformations. Their suggestions regarding possible autonomic disturbances may require further study, but they have adduced no scientific evidence to contradict the accepted view that in the intact child blue breath holding spells are benign. Those families in which an infant suffers an 'apparently life threatening event' deserve immense understanding and help, and it behoves investigators to exercise extreme care and self criticism in the presentation of new knowledge which may bear upon their management and their morale. 
5	Surgical treatment of the retethered spinal cord after repair of lipomyelomeningocele. In a series of 75 patients with surgically treated lipomyelomeningoceles, the neurological condition of six patients deteriorated 6 months to 14 years after the operation due to repeat tethering of the spinal cord. The tethering resulted from postoperative dense adhesion between the cord and the overlying dura mater. Two of the six patients underwent conventional repeat untethering procedures, and the remaining four were successfully treated with a new surgical technique developed by the authors to prevent such dural adhesion. For this procedure, after complete untethering of the spinal cord, the lumbosacral cord is retained in the center of the dural sac by fine stay sutures between the pia mater of the conus medullaris and the ventral dura mater. In addition, the dura mater is tacked to the posterior arch which is reconstructed with bone grafts at one or two bifid vertebral levels. During a postoperative follow-up period of 1 to 3 years, no further deterioration has been observed and magnetic resonance studies have demonstrated a space filled with cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) around the lumbosacral cord. The authors conclude that long-term observation, both neurological and radiological, is essential even after successful repair of a lipomyelomeningocele. This new surgical procedure can maintain a CSF bath around the lumbosacral cord, thus preventing dural adhesion. Application of this technique will hopefully be beneficial in lipomyelomeningocele patients with a high risk of cord retethering after initial repair. 
4	Clinical and Doppler echocardiographic follow-up after percutaneous balloon valvuloplasty for aortic valve stenosis. Percutaneous balloon valvuloplasty has been shown to increase the aortic orifice area and to improve clinical symptoms. However, there are only few data concerning long-term results after balloon valvuloplasty. In this study, 36 patients (11 men, 25 women, mean age 75 +/- 8 years) were followed after balloon valvuloplasty for a period of up to 18 months by means of clinical parameters and repeated Doppler echocardiographic measurements after 1, 3, 6, 12 and 18 months. Invasive measurements revealed a decrease of the systolic peak gradient from 78 +/- 24 to 38 +/- 13 mm Hg (p less than 0.001), and an increase in the aortic orifice area from 0.58 +/- 0.23 to 0.93 +/- 0.2 cm2 (p less than 0.001). The Doppler echocardiographic approach revealed that the maximal instantaneous gradient decreased from 96 +/- 26 to 67 +/- 22 mm Hg (p less than 0.001). The aortic orifice area increased from 0.49 +/- 0.16 to 0.73 +/- 0.21 cm2 (p less than 0.001). Three patients (8%) died in the hospital. After hospital discharge, 16 patients (44%) died and 8 patients (22%) underwent successful aortic valve replacement after a mean follow-up of 8 +/- 6 months. Nine patients (25%) were alive after a follow-up period of 18 months. Seven of these (19%) remained clinically improved. During follow-up, the Doppler echocardiographic results revealed a continuous trend toward the preprocedural severity of the aortic valve stenosis. Progression of restenosis assessed by Doppler echocardiographic measurements was accelerated in the group of patients who subsequently died or underwent repeat balloon valvuloplasty or aortic valve replacement. 
5	Severe tricuspid regurgitation after mitral valve repair: diagnosis by intraoperative transesophageal echocardiography. Transesophageal echocardiography facilitates the evaluation of valvular repair in the operating room. The functional valvular morphology and degree of valvular regurgitation can be assessed before and after repair. This technique can also identify unsuspected findings--in this case, severe tricuspid regurgitation complicating cardiopulmonary bypass. We report a previously undescribed cause of traumatic tricuspid regurgitation. 
3	Calcium antagonists in the management of patients with aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage: a review. Cerebral arterial vasospasm and infarction is the leading cause of death and disability among patients who reach a major medical center after aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH). Recent evidence suggests that two calcium antagonists, nimodipine or nicardipine, may be useful in preventing this important complication of SAH. This paper reviews the current status of these two calcium antagonists in the management of SAH. 
1	Postoperative follow-up of patients with early breast cancer. Patterns of care among clinical oncologists and a review of the literature. Eighty clinical oncologists in the southeastern United States were surveyed to determine their strategies for follow-up care after primary treatment of early-stage breast cancer. The frequency of use of the history and physical examination, complete blood count, liver function tests, carcinoembryonic antigen levels, chest x-ray, skeletal survey, bone scan, liver scan, and mammogram for observing hypothetical low- and high-risk patients was assessed. Yearly mammograms were recommended by more than 95% of respondents. History and physical examination were the modalities used most often, whereas periodic bone and liver scans were used only in a minority of patients. A review of the literature supported the strategy of the respondents in this survey and further underscored the cost-effectiveness of the history and physical examination in detecting recurrence during follow-up. Based on this survey and supporting literature, recommendations for reasonable yet cost-conscious follow-up are presented. 
4	Prognostic significance of Doppler measures of diastolic function in cardiac amyloidosis. A Doppler echocardiography study. BACKGROUND. We have previously characterized the left ventricular diastolic filling abnormalities in cardiac amyloidosis by Doppler methods. The various filling patterns were shown to be related to the degree of cardiac amyloid infiltration. The purpose of this study was to determine the value of Doppler diastolic filling variables for assessing prognosis in cardiac amyloidosis. METHODS AND RESULTS. We performed pulsed-wave Doppler studies of the left ventricular inflow and obtained clinical follow-up data in 63 consecutive patients with biopsy-proven systemic amyloidosis. All patients had typical echocardiographic features of cardiac involvement. The patients were subdivided into two groups according to deceleration time: Group 1 (33 patients) had a deceleration time of 150 msec or less, indicative of restrictive physiology, and group 2 (30 patients) had a deceleration time of more than 150 msec. Of the 63 patients, 32 (51%) died during a mean follow-up period of 18 +/- 12 months. Of these deaths, 25 (78%) were cardiac deaths, and 19 of the 25 patients (76%) were from group 1. The 1-year probability of survival in group 1 was significantly less than that in group 2 (49% versus 92%, p less than 0.001). Bivariate analysis revealed that the combination of the Doppler variables of shortened deceleration time and increased early diastolic filling velocity to atrial filling velocity ratio were stronger predictors of cardiac death than were the two-dimensional echocardiographic variables of mean left ventricular wall thickness and fractional shortening. CONCLUSIONS. Doppler-derived left ventricular diastolic filling variables are important predictors of survival in cardiac amyloidosis. 
4	Clinical and pathological features of bacillary peliosis hepatis in association with human immunodeficiency virus infection BACKGROUND. Peliosis hepatis is characterized by cystic, blood-filled spaces in the liver and is seen in patients with chronic infections or advanced cancer and as a consequence of therapy with anabolic steroids. Cutaneous bacillary angiomatosis is a bacterial infection that occurs in patients with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection; its histologic appearance is that of a pseudoneoplastic vascular proliferation. METHODS. We studied liver tissue from eight HIV-infected patients with peliosis hepatis, two of whom also had cutaneous bacillary angiomatosis. For comparison we examined tissue from four patients who had peliosis hepatis without HIV infection. Tissues were examined histologically on routine sections and with special stains and electron microscopy. RESULTS. The histologic features seen in peliosis hepatis associated with HIV infection, but not in the four cases unrelated to HIV infection, were myxoid stroma and clumps of a granular purple material that on Warthin-Starry staining and electron microscopy proved to be bacilli. The bacilli, which could not be cultured, were morphologically identical to those found in the skin lesions of cutaneous bacillary angiomatosis. The clinical courses of two of the patients with this "bacillary peliosis hepatis" indicate that it responds to antibiotic treatment. CONCLUSIONS. HIV-associated bacillary peliosis hepatis is an unusual, treatable opportunistic infection, probably caused by the same organism that causes cutaneous bacillary angiomatosis. Our failure to find bacilli in non-HIV-associated cases implies that other pathogenetic mechanisms may also be responsible for peliosis hepatis. 
1	Cyclosporine enhances the growth of carcinogen-induced enzyme-altered foci in rat liver. Cyclosporine, a powerful immunosuppressant, has been used successfully for organ transplantation. Its efficacy on liver transplants of patients with primary hepatic tumors remains controversial because of a high rate of recurrence of the original tumors in the transplanted livers. In this study, we experimentally tested whether cyclosporine exerts any effects on the growth of carcinogen-initiated liver cells using the short-term assays of rat liver carcinogenesis. Dietary cyclosporine, which maintained sufficient levels of blood cyclosporine and suppressed host immune functions, enhanced the development of the glutathione S-transferase, placental form-positive hepatocyte foci in the liver of male F-344 rats treated with a single weekly dose of diethylnitrosamine (75 mg/kg) for 3 wk. Dietary cyclosporine also accelerated the growth of preformed glutathione S-transferase, placental form-positive foci induced by a single dose of diethylnitrosamine (250 mg/kg) followed by the promoting regimen of a choline-deficient diet. It is possible that the enhancement of the size of hepatocyte foci by cyclosporine could be due to stimulation of growth or inhibition of regression. The mechanisms by which cyclosporine modifies the growth of preneoplastic lesions in the liver are not yet fully understood. Possible involvement of immunologically relevant cells in the liver, Kupffer cells and pit cells in the process is suggested. 
3	A cellist with arm pain: thermal asymmetry in scalenus anticus syndrome. We report on a cellist with pain and coldness of the upper extremity. Abnormal thermographic studies were instrumental in uncovering intermittent compression of the subclavian artery, and this prompted us to study the effects of cello playing on skin temperature asymmetry. Temperature asymmetry was defined as the temperature difference (delta-T) from one hand to the other. In 57 controls, mean delta-T at rest was .309 +/- .254C. Exercising the upper extremities by prolonged elbow flexion or by movements mimicking cello playing in controls did not significantly affect delta-T. In our patient, delta-T was ten times control (3.6C). Angiography showed extrinsic compression of the subclavian artery occurring only after cello playing; sympathetic ganglion block relieved the pain. Our patient's abnormal skin temperature may have reflected sympathetic vasomotor hyperactivity. Intermittent neurovascular compression and sympathetic hyperactivity appear to be factors in scalenus anticus syndrome. 
3	Cauda equina syndrome associated with multiple lumbar arachnoid cysts in ankylosing spondylitis: improvement following surgical therapy. A case of cauda equina syndrome with multiple lumbar arachnoid cysts complicating ankylosing spondylitis (AS) is described. The value of computerised tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) as a non-invasive means of establishing the diagnosis is emphasised. In contrast to previously reported cases the patient showed neurological improvement following surgical therapy. Surgery may be indicated in some patients, particularly when there is nerve root compression by the arachnoid cysts and when the patient is seen early before irreversible damage to the cauda equina has occurred. 
5	Carotid-cavernous sinus fistula associated with a primitive trigeminal artery. Carotid-cavernous sinus fistulas are not rare, but they have never been reported in association with persistent primitive trigeminal artery. We recently encountered such a case. The Jaeger-Hamby procedure was employed, with mandatory occlusion of the primitive trigeminal artery. 
2	Apical secretion of lysosomal enzymes in rabbit pancreas occurs via a secretagogue regulated pathway and is increased after pancreatic duct obstruction. Lysosomal hydrolases such as cathepsin B are apically secreted from rabbit pancreatic acinar cells via a regulated as opposed to a constitutive pathway. Intravenous infusion of the cholecystokinin analogue caerulein results in highly correlated apical secretion of digestive and lysosomal enzymes, suggesting that they are discharged from the same presecretory compartment (zymogen granules). Lysosomal enzymes appear to enter that compartment as a result of missorting. After 7 h of duct obstruction is relieved, caerulein-stimulated apical secretion of cathepsin B and amylase is increased, but the ratio of cathepsin B to amylase secretion is not different than that following caerulein stimulation of animals never obstructed. These findings indicate that duct obstruction causes an increased amount of both lysosomal and digestive enzymes to accumulate within the secretagogue releasable compartment but that duct obstruction does not increase the degree of lysosomal enzyme missorting into that compartment. Pancreatic duct obstruction causes lysosomal hydrolases to become colocalized with digestive enzymes in organelles that, in size and distribution, resemble zymogen granules but that are not subject to secretion in response to secretagogue stimulation. These organelles may be of importance in the development of pancreatitis. 
5	Acute experimental allergic encephalomyelitis in SJL/J mice induced by a synthetic peptide of myelin proteolipid protein. Clinical, histologic, and ultrastructural characteristics of acute experimental allergic encephalomyelitis (EAE) induced by sensitization with a synthetic peptide corresponding to mouse myelin proteolipid protein (PLP) residues 139-151 HCLGKWLGHPDKF were studied in SJL/J mice. Groups of mice were immunized with 20, 50, or 100 nmol of the peptide and were killed from seven to 28 days after sensitization or when they were moribund. Beginning on Day 9, the mice showed signs of EAE and the disease progressed rapidly to paralysis. Central nervous system (CNS) inflammation, edema, gliosis, and demyelination were found in all mice killed between Days 10 and 28 and white matter lesion areas correlated with clinical score at the time the mice were killed. Peripheral nerve roots and the cauda equina did not have lesions. Within the range studied, the severity of clinical or histologic disease was the same regardless of the PLP peptide dose. Two of ten mice immunized with 100 nmol and none of 14 mice given smaller doses of a synthetic peptide of mouse myelin basic protein (MBP) showed clinical EAE. These mice had small numbers of CNS lesions that were indistinguishable from those in PLP peptide-sensitized mice. These findings demonstrate that immunization of SJL/J mice with PLP peptide 139-151 produces a disease with the clinical and morphologic features of CNS tissue-, whole PLP-, whole MBP-, and MBP peptide-induced acute EAE. Thus, PLP is a major encephalitogen and immune reactions to epitopes of different myelin proteins may induce identical patterns of injury in the CNS. 
2	Six physicians with inflammatory bowel disease. This essay tells the stories of six physicians with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) to emphasize how important denial and control become when a physician is a patient. Guilt at the supposed psychosomatic "origin" of IBD suggests that we as physicians should never blame our patients for getting sick. 
4	The variable extent of jeopardized myocardium in patients with single vessel coronary artery disease: quantification by thallium-201 single photon emission computed tomography To assess the extent of jeopardized myocardium in patients with single vessel coronary artery disease of variable severity and location, quantitative exercise thallium-201 single photon emission computed tomography was performed in 158 consecutive patients with angiographically proved single vessel coronary artery disease. The extent of abnormal left ventricular perfusion was quantified from computer-generated polar maps of three-dimensional myocardial radioactivity. Patients with only a moderate (51% to 69%) stenosis tended to have a small perfusion defect irrespective of the coronary artery involved. Whereas a perfusion defect measuring greater than or equal to 10% of the left ventricle was found in 78% of patients with no prior infarction and severe (greater than or equal to 70%) stenosis, this was observed in only 24% of patients with moderate stenosis. Perfusion defect size increased with increasing severity of stenosis for the entire group without infarction and for those with left anterior descending, right and circumflex coronary artery stenosis. However, the correlation between stenosis severity and perfusion defect size was at best only modest (r = 0.38, p = 0.0001). The left anterior descending artery was shown to be the most important of the three coronary arteries for providing left ventricular perfusion. Proximal stenosis of this artery produced a perfusion defect approximately twice as large as that found in patients with a proximal right or circumflex artery stenosis. However, marked heterogeneity in perfusion defect size existed among all three vessels despite comparable stenosis severity. This was most apparent for the left anterior descending coronary artery, where mid vessel stenosis commonly produced a perfusion defect similar in size to that found in proximally stenosed vessels. 
5	Are cystgastrostomy and cystjejunostomy equivalent operations for pancreatic pseudocysts? To compare the effectiveness of cystgastrostomy and cystjejunostomy for treatment of pancreatic pseudocysts, 39 patients with cystgastrostomy were compared to 59 patients with cystjejunostomy. The groups were comparable in age, sex, cause of pancreatitis, pseudocyst location, symptoms, and preoperative serum amylase level. Cysts treated with cystgastrostomy were larger (mean diameter, 11.1 +/- 0.9 cm) than cysts treated by cystjejunostomy (mean diameter, 6.7 +/- 0.7 cm) (p less than 0.05). Mean duration of surgery was 148 +/- 11 minutes for cystgastrostomy versus 265 +/- 15 minutes for cystjejunostomy (p less than 0.05). Mean blood loss was 397 +/- 82 ml for cystgastrostomy versus 703 +/- 80 ml for cystjejunostomy (p less than 0.05) Mean intraoperative fluid requirements were 2640 +/- 313 ml for cystgastrostomy and 4403 +/- 362 ml for cystjejunostomy (p less than 0.05). Cyst recurrence was 10% for cystgastrostomy versus 7% for cystgastrostomy. Postoperative gastrointestinal bleeding occurred in 8% of patients with cystgastrostomy and in 2% of patients with cystjejunostomy. Infection problems with cystjejunostomy included two wound infections and one case of septicemia; infection problems with cystjejunostomy included five intraabdominal abscesses, two wound infections, and one case of pneumonia. Two patients died with cystgastrostomy (both from gastrointestinal bleeding); two patients died with cystjejunostomy (one from intraabdominal sepsis and one from pulmonary embolus). Cystgastrostomy was used for significantly larger pseudocysts and was associated with significantly less blood loss and operating time than cystjejunostomy (p less than 0.05). Morbidity and mortality from cystgastrostomy and cystjejunostomy were comparable, although gastrointestinal bleeding was more common with cystgastrostomy and intraabdominal abscess was more common with cystjejunostomy. Since cystgastrostomy can usually be performed more quickly and with less blood loss, it should be considered whenever anatomically feasible. 
5	Increased susceptibility to hypoxia of prolonged action potential duration in ventricular papillary muscles from diabetic rats. The action potential duration (APD) of ventricular muscles obtained from diabetic animals is reported to be prolonged. We studied the effect of varied periods of diabetes on APD prolongation using isolated ventricular papillary muscles from streptozocin-injected rats. We found that a diabetic period greater than 30 wk was necessary for the evolution of significant prolongation of APD. We then studied the effect of repeated hypoxia (PO2 40 mmHg) and normoxia (PO2 300 mmHg) on prolonged APD of diabetic muscles and compared the findings with those from control rats. Transmembrane potentials were recorded with conventional glass microelectrodes. Under normoxic conditions, the APDs of diabetic muscles were significantly prolonged, the maximum upstroke velocity of action potentials tended to be decreased, and the resting membrane potential was not changed significantly compared with controls. The first hypoxia (20 min) shortened the APD in both diabetic and control rats but more so in diabetic rats, thereby making the APD of diabetic rats virtually identical to the control rat APD during the hypoxia. On subsequent reoxygenation (30 min), these hypoxia-induced changes were almost recovered. The second hypoxia (20 min) produced more severe shortening of the APD in both muscle types, and the effect was again far greater in diabetic rats than controls, ending with a reversed sequence of APDs and the APD of diabetic muscles much shorter than the controls. Excessive shortening of APD in diabetic muscles during hypoxic conditions was speculated to be due to greater increases in the outward K+ current through ATP-regulated K+ channels that may be secondary to the more severe reduction of intracellular ATP concentrations in diabetic versus control hearts. 
5	Differences between florid osseous dysplasia and chronic diffuse sclerosing osteomyelitis. Florid osseous dysplasia (FOD) is confused in the literature with chronic diffuse sclerosing osteomyelitis. Two cases of each condition are presented to demonstrate the differences between them. In FOD, there are multiple lobulated sclerotic masses in several quadrants of the jaws, usually in black females. In some cases, the sclerotic masses are exposed to the oral cavity, resulting in a secondary osteomyelitis. Periapical cemental dysplasia is often found in association with FOD. Chronic diffuse sclerosing osteomyelitis is a primary inflammatory condition of the mandible. Patients have cyclic episodes of unilateral pain and swelling. The affected region of the mandible exhibits a diffuse opacity with poorly defined borders. Although women are affected more often than men, black persons are not particularly susceptible. 
5	The IVH complex of lesions: cerebrovascular injury in the preterm infant. The term intraventricular hemorrhage has become associated with a variety of cerebrovascular insults in preterm infants. Because of a shared pathophysiology and timing, these are the neurologic lesions to search for when evaluating sick preterm infants. This complex of lesions is common and, when parenchymal injury occurs, likely to result in neurologic sequelae. A review of the variety of injuries, their pathophysiology, their diagnosis by cranial ultrasonography, and their prognosis is offered. Emphasis is placed on the need for assessment over time when evaluating parenchymal lesions in preterm infants. 
1	Colorectal cancer: have we identified an effective screening strategy? Three currently used screening methods are aimed at detecting colorectal cancer when it is asymptomatic and curable, and at detecting polyps so that they can be removed before they can progress to cancer. Digital rectal examinations are relatively cheap and easy but can detect only a small fraction of large-bowel cancers. Sigmoidoscopy is more sensitive, but its low acceptability to patients has been only partially mitigated by the introduction of the 35-cm flexible instrument. Fecal occult blood testing has limited sensitivity because blood from cancers and polyps is neither continuously shed nor uniformly distributed in feces; specificity and positive predictive value are also low because of other sources of blood in the stool. Prudent judgment suggests that all of these screening tests may prevent death from colorectal cancer in some patients. However, none has been proven effective in general use by well-controlled studies. Case-control studies can provide timely and valuable new evidence in this regard; the authors' investigations in progress are described. The current lack of strong evidence in support of these screening tests should not be interpreted as evidence against their use. 
2	Estrogen receptors in the external anal sphincter. Inasmuch as anal competence in women is reduced after the age of 50 years, it may be dependent on effects of estrogens. In this study, samples of the external anal sphincter were analyzed for the presence of estrogen receptors and were found to be present at a median concentration of 5.0 fmol per milligram of protein (range, 1.9 to 13) in women (n = 7), and 1.1 fmol per milligram of protein (range, 0 to 3.2) in men (n = 7). These findings are of interest with regard to the treatment of idiopathic anal incontinence. 
4	Turner's syndrome, fibromuscular dysplasia, and stroke. We report a 43-year-old woman who presented with a right frontoparietotemporal ischemic stroke. She had been diagnosed with Turner's syndrome during childhood and had a history of chronic estrogen therapy. Cerebral angiography showed lesions characteristics of fibromuscular dysplasia involving the right internal carotid and right vertebral arteries. We are not aware of any previous reports describing an association between fibromuscular dysplasia and Turner's syndrome. Although chronic estrogen therapy cannot be ruled out as a cause of this patient's stroke, we suggest a possible etiologic relation between these two entities. 
1	The role of gastric resection in the management of multicentric argyrophil gastric carcinoids. A patient with pernicious anemia, atrophic non-antral gastritis, hypergastrinemia, and widespread hyperplasia of enterochromaffin-like cells and manifest enterochromaffin-like cell carcinoma was followed up during 39 months, including 15 months after gastric resection. In this case normalization of gastrin levels did not prevent the development of multiple gastric carcinoids in the fundic mucosa, suggesting that factors other than gastrin are of importance in the pathogenesis. 
1	The potential of 2-deoxy-2[18F]fluoro-D-glucose (FDG) for the detection of tumor involvement in lymph nodes. To assess the potential of FDG for PET imaging of nodal tumor metastases, we evaluated its uptake into normal lymph nodes, tumor-involved lymph nodes, and subcutaneous tumor xenografts in rodents. Normal lymph nodes in mice and rats accumulate FDG moderately, developing node/blood ratios of 1.3-11.9/1 at 2 hr following i.v. injection. By contrast, FDG given subcutaneously to healthy Sprague Dawley rats developed very high normal draining lymph node/blood ratios (272/1) versus 7.7/1 by i.v. injection. In nude mice, subcutaneous human ovarian cancer xenografts had 1.27-fold more uptake relative to blood than did normal popliteal lymph nodes. Subcutaneous tumor xenografts of rat breast cancer developed tumor/normal node uptake ratios of 4.91 +/- 0.43/1 and tumor/blood ratios of 6.6 +/- 0.9 at 2 hr postinjection. Mouse nodes involved with 38C13 murine B-cell lymphoma had mean node/blood ratios of 42.9 +/- 6.7/1 and tumored node/normal lymph node uptake of 6.3/1. Thus, FDG given intravenously but not subcutaneusly (due to high normal nodal uptake) has potential as an agent for the detection of metastatic tumors in regional lymph nodes using PET scanning. 
4	Pathophysiology of hypertension in blacks. The pathophysiology of hypertension in the black population differs to some extent from that of the nonblack population. Although black hypertensives exhibit enhanced sodium retention, expanded plasma volume, lower plasma renin activity, and a greater increase in blood pressure in response to high levels of Na+ intake compared with nonblack hypertensives, there is considerable heterogeneity in these studies. Alterations in ion transport mechanisms, such as a decrease in Na+K(+)-ATPase activity and Na+K+ cotransport, have been demonstrated in the black hypertensive population. Those features provide the physiologic basis for the differential response to monotherapy with diuretics and, perhaps, with calcium channel blockers, that is observed in black hypertensives, particularly when compared with responses to beta-blockers or angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors. 
2	Increased uptake of bromodeoxyuridine by hepatocytes from early stage of primary biliary cirrhosis. The relationship between DNA synthesis activities of hepatocytes in biopsied specimens and liver volume was studied in various stages of primary biliary cirrhosis using an in vitro bromodeoxyuridine (a thymidine analogue)-anti-bromodeoxyuridine reaction and computed tomography. The mean bromodeoxyuridine (+/- SE) labeling index for 10 patients in an early histological stage (stage I, 4, and stage II, 6, 3.4% +/- 0.4%) of primary biliary cirrhosis was 17 times that for 6 control subjects (0.2% +/- 0.1%, P less than 0.001), and was significantly higher than that for 19 female patients with chronic aggressive hepatitis (0.9% +/- 0.2%, P less than 0.001), 14 compensated cirrhotic patients of viral origin (all female, 1.1% +/- 0.3%, P less than 0.01), and 5 patients with stage III primary biliary cirrhosis (0.5% +/- 0.1%, P less than 0.001). The mean (+/- SE) liver volume in the early stage of primary biliary cirrhosis (1225 +/- 40 cm3) was about 1.5 times that in control subjects (835 +/- 42 cm3, P less than 0.001). These results suggest that liver volume has already become large in the early stage of primary biliary cirrhosis perhaps because of markedly increased DNA synthesis in hepatocytes. 
5	Fine surface structure of an intraspinal neurenteric cyst: a scanning and transmission electron microscopy study. The case of an 11-year-old boy with an intraspinal neurenteric cyst, which recurred 8 years and 3 months after surgery, is presented. Scanning and transmission electron microscopy of the cyst epithelium revealed marked resemblance to that of the respiratory tract, despite the presence of numerous goblet cells mimicking intestine on light microscopy study. Detailed ultrastructural findings are described. 
5	Acid aspiration prophylaxis in 288 obstetric anaesthetic departments in the United Kingdom. The choice of drugs for acid aspiration prophylaxis in 288 obstetric anaesthetic departments in the United Kingdom was determined by questionnaire. The results are compared with a similar survey of anaesthetic departments 5 years ago. The prescription of sodium citrate and the H2 receptor antagonist ranitidine has superseded that of Mist. magnesium trisilicate. 
3	Advances in the treatment of complex cerebrovascular disorders by interventional neurovascular techniques. Treatment of complex cerebrovascular disorders, including intracranial aneurysms, carotid cavernous sinus fistulas, vertebral fistulas, arteriovenous malformations, atherosclerosis of brachiocephalic vessels, and arterial vasospasm, is being performed in selected cases by interventional neurovascular techniques. Recent advances in microballoon technology, permanent solidifying polymers, newer embolic agents, high-resolution digital subtraction angiography with road-mapping technique, and steerable micro-guide wires and catheters have greatly improved access in the distal intracranial circulation and markedly reduced the morbidity associated with these procedures. Interventional neuroradiology is emerging as an important adjunct to neurosurgery for selected cerebrovascular disorders. 
5	Transfer function of sound transmission in subglottal human respiratory system at low frequencies. The amplitude of sound transmission from the mouth to a site overlying the extrathoracic trachea and two sites on the posterior chest wall was measured in eight healthy adult male subjects at resting lung volume over the 100- to 600-Hz frequency range. The ratios of the estimated magnitude spectra of transmission of each of the chest wall sites to the tracheal site were determined, with the resulting spectra representing effective transfer functions of transmission in the subglottal system. For the group, the transfer functions exhibited a single peak, which occurred at 143 +/- 13 Hz (mean +/- SD) with a quality factor (Q) of 2.0 +/- 0.2 for the upper chest wall site and at 129 +/- 6 Hz with a Q of 2.2 +/- 0.4 for the lower site. The trend of decreasing spectral energy with increasing frequency was indicated by roll-offs of -10 +/- 4 and -17 +/- 5 dB/octave from 300 to 600 Hz at the two sites, respectively. The fundamental radial mode of a model thoracic cavity, which is a large rigid cylinder filled with lossless lung tissue, provides a good estimate of the observed low-frequency resonance. This agreement suggests that thoracic cavity resonances may have particularly important effects on sound transmission at frequencies below approximately 250 Hz, where the magnitude of parenchymal attenuation appears to be small. 
4	Results of repeat percutaneous balloon valvuloplasty for pulmonary valvar restenosis. Follow-up cardiac catheterization studies were used to evaluate 105 patients who had undergone percutaneous balloon pulmonary valvuloplasty. Fifteen of those patients who had peak systolic pulmonary valve gradients greater than = 40 mm Hg at follow-up underwent repeat balloon valvuloplasty. For the initial balloon pulmonary valvuloplasty, the mean ratio of the balloon diameter to pulmonary valve annulus diameter was 0.98 +/- 0.2; at repeat valvuloplasty the mean was 1.19 +/- 0.12. The immediate post-repeat balloon valvuloplasty results showed a reduction in the peak systolic gradient from a mean of 70.2 +/- 17.8 to 29.1 +/- 19.0 mm Hg (p less than 0.001). This reduction in the gradient was maintained at a mean of 14.3 +/- 5.0 mm Hg in 8 of the 10 patients who underwent further follow-up studies. We conclude that successful repeat balloon pulmonary valvuloplasty with the use of larger sized balloons is feasible in patients who have restenosis after the initial percutaneous balloon valvuloplasty--including partial but not complete dysplasia of the pulmonary valve. 
4	Double-blind comparison of doxazosin and enalapril in patients with mild or moderate essential hypertension. The antihypertensive efficacy and safety of doxazosin and enalapril were compared in the general practice setting (n = 54). Both agents produced comparable, statistically significant (p less than 0.05) reductions in mean blood pressure with no clinically relevant changes in heart rate. Side effects in the two groups were mild or moderate and disappeared or were tolerated with continued treatment. Doxazosin, in contrast to enalapril, produced a significant (p less than 0.05) reduction in the total serum cholesterol concentration, a reduction in the level of triglycerides, and a favorable increase in the high-density lipoprotein/total cholesterol ratio. The reduction in calculated coronary heart disease risk produced by doxazosin (-27.58%) was highly significant (p less than 0.0002) and greater than that produced by enalapril (-18.49% p less than 0.02). 
5	Bilateral reexpansion pulmonary edema following unilateral pleurocentesis. Acute ipsilateral pulmonary edema following reexpansion of the lung after pleurocentesis or pneumothorax is a well described entity. We report the unusual occurrence of bilateral pulmonary edema following unilateral pleurocentesis in a young male without heart disease. Various hypotheses regarding the mechanism of reexpansion pulmonary edema include increased capillary permeability due to hypoxic injury, decreased surfactant production, altered pulmonary perfusion and mechanical stretching of membranes. This case suggests that forces leading to ipsilateral reexpansion pulmonary edema also affect the contralateral lung. 
4	Payment mechanism and patterns of use of medical services: the example of hypertension. This study explores the relationship between the use of medical services by hypertensive patients and mechanisms for payment within a single primary care practice. Three payment mechanisms were explored: public assistance, a capitated health maintenance organization (HMO), and fee-for-service. Patterns were examined across reimbursement type for the following variables: age, sex, visit reason, number of visits, medications, tests ordered, referrals made, and recommendations for follow-up visits. Illness severity was controlled in two ways: (1) by the study being focused on one diagnosis--mild to moderate hypertension, and (2) by concurrent chronic illnesses being enumerated and included in the analysis. Medical visits to the physician were examined over a 2-year period for 25 to 30 patients randomly sampled from each of the three payment mechanisms. Statistically significant differences were found for patient behaviors (total number of patient visits) and physician behaviors (number of medications and recommendations for revisits). The highest visit frequency was found for those on public assistance, followed closely by those covered by an HMO, and more distantly by those choosing fee-for-service. In a climate of cost consciousness, further study is needed to explore the impact of reimbursement mechanisms on the use of health care services. 
3	Effects of neuro-developmental treatment and orthoses on knee flexion during gait: a single-subject design. The interactive effects of neuro-developmental treatment and inhibitive ankle-height orthoses on gait were examined via a single-subject research design. Knee flexion during gait at initial contact, mid-stance, heel-off, and mid-swing were measured in a 2-year-old girl with diplegia by use of a goniometer and freeze-frame videography. During the treatment and treatment/orthoses phases, a decrease in excessive knee flexion was noted. Changes in trend over time were greater in the 3-week treatment phase than in the 3-week treatment/orthoses phase. Changes in level at the initiation of the treatment/orthoses phase were greater than in the treatment phase. The described neuro-developmental treatment activities were conducted correctly 92% of the time according to an independent observer. The interrater reliability of goniometric data measured by videography was .93 using intraclass correlation coefficients. The results of this study suggest that both methods of treatment can be used to decrease excessive knee flexion during gait in a child with diplegia. 
5	Indications and results of relaxing retinotomy. The authors report their results of a consecutive series of 40 eyes undergoing relaxing retinotomy during vitrectomy to achieve retinal reattachment for the following indications: proliferative vitreoretinopathy (PVR), 21 eyes (52%); trauma, 10 eyes (25%); diabetic retinopathy, 6 eyes (15%); and expulsive choroidal hemorrhage, 3 eyes (8%). Thirty eyes (75%) had undergone previous vitreoretinal procedures. Extended tamponade was achieved in all cases with either silicone oil (27 eyes, 68%) or long-acting gas (13 eyes, 32%). Retinotomy size ranged from 45 degrees to 360 degrees. Intraoperative retinal attachment was possible in all eyes with 33 (83%) achieving total or subtotal retinal attachment including the macula for 5 months or more. Twenty-seven eyes (68%) achieved 3/200 visual acuity or better and 10 (37%) achieved 20/400 or better. Thirteen eyes (32%) failed to achieve 3/200 visual acuity secondary to recurrent detachment (18%), corneal decompensation (8%), macular dysfunction (5%), and glaucoma (3%). 
5	Increased septic complications with three-drug sequential immunosuppression for cadaver renal transplants. In 152 renal transplant recipients, the results of immunosuppression with three-drug sequential (Minnesota antilymphocyte globulin, prednisone, azathioprine, and cyclosporine) immunosuppression (n = 107) were compared with those of a two-drug sequential protocol (Minnesota antilymphocyte globulin, prednisone, and cyclosporine) that excluded azathioprine (n = 45). The study groups were comparable by age, sex, etiology of renal failure, incidence of diabetes, and degree of HLA matching. Patient survival at 1 year was not significantly different in the two groups (two drug, 93% versus three drug, 86%; p = 0.19). One-year graft survival was superior in the two-drug group (two drug, 93% versus three drug, 75%; p = 0.02). Analysis of primary transplants only (n = 116) yielded the same results. During the first year, the serum creatinine level remained stable in both groups. As expected, the three-drug therapy group had significantly more bacterial and viral infections. For low-risk primary cadaveric renal transplants, two-drug sequential immunosuppression is superior. 
5	Effects of salt, race, and hypertension on reactivity to stressors. Blood pressure and heart rate reactivity to a psychological stressor and to a cold pressor test were examined in a group of 51 normotensive and 37 unmedicated hypertensive men. All were studied twice, once while the participants were maintained on a moderately high salt (200 meq sodium/day) diet and once while the participants were maintained on an extremely low salt (10 meq sodium/day) diet. Dietary salt had no effect on blood pressure or heart rate responses to the two stressors. The systolic and diastolic responses of the white participants to the psychological stressor were greater than those of the black participants (both p less than 0.05); however, there was no difference between blacks and whites in reactivity to the cold pressor challenge. As compared with the normotensive group, the hypertensive group reacted to the psychological stressor with increased responses in systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure, and heart rate (all p less than 0.05). The hypertensive group also hyperresponded in terms of the systolic pressure response to the cold pressor task (p less than 0.05). Plasma norepinephrine and epinephrine responses were not significantly different across the two diets, races, or diagnoses. 
5	Percutaneous cholangioscopic or transpapillary insertion of self-expanding biliary metal stents. Fifty-two self-expanding metal stents were implanted in 39 patients with malignant (35 patients) or benign (4 patients) biliary stenoses. The stents were inserted and properly released by means of a 7 or 9 French gauge delivery catheter via the percutaneous (20 patients) or transpapillary (19 patients) route. In all cases the endoprostheses expanded to a diameter of 7 to 10 mm and achieved complete biliary tract drainage. Jaundice disappeared in 36 of the 39 patients. No early complication was observed. After a median follow-up of 121 days (range, 30 to 422 days), 19 of 36 patients are still alive and 17 died of non-procedure-related causes. Biliary re-obstruction occurred in five patients due to tumor overgrowth above or below the prosthesis (four patients) or bile encrustation (one patient). In patients with malignant stenoses, the probability of stent patency is 78% after 200 days. We conclude that large-bore metal stents are safe, effective, and provide better long-term patency than conventional endoprostheses. 
5	Incisional parapubic hernias. A parapubic hernia, distinct from other lower abdominal wall hernias, is identified as a particular type of incisional hernia. This hernia results from the disruption of the musculotendinous elements of the abdominal wall as they insert into the pubis. This disruption is brought about by either the destruction of these musculotendinous tissues at their lower end or the resection of portions of the pubic bone as is sometimes done in suprapubic radical prostatectomies for easier access to the prostate. Seven cases have been identified and reported. Men and women were seen to make up a clinical picture that is suggestive of the diagnosis, namely, multiple previous operations through the lower abdominal wall, procedures of a gynecologic or urologic nature, a herniation that mimics an incisional or inguinal hernia, and a defect that cannot possibly be corrected without the use of a prosthesis. When the diagnosis is accurately established, the polypropylene mesh is inserted in the preperitoneal space and anchored laterally to the ligaments of Cooper and in between to the arcuate pubic ligament and the periosteum of the posterior aspect of the pubis. Excellent results have been obtained, and the success must be ascribed to the recognition of the parapubic hernia as a distinct entity. 
1	Diagnostic imaging and surgical treatment of dumbbell tumors of the mediastinum. We describe the diagnostic procedures and surgical approaches employed in 5 patients with dumbbell tumors of the mediastinum. Magnetic resonance imaging accurately described the existence and longitudinal extension of the intraspinal component of the tumor and assisted in choosing the appropriate surgical approach. Both the intrathoracic and intraspinal components of the tumor were resected at one time by a thoracic and neurosurgical team. We employed the Grillo technique three times and a separate laminectomy and thoracotomy approach. Magnetic resonance imaging proved the most useful diagnostic technique for suspected dumbbell mediastinal tumors. In our experience, the extended thoracotomy proposed by Grillo and co-workers worked well for small tumors involving only one foramen in which the intraspinal extension was limited to 2 to 3 cm, and when no more than two laminectomies were required. On the other hand, thoracotomy and a longitudinal paravertebral incision are preferable for larger tumors (more than 4 cm) involving more than one foramen in which the intraspinal extension exceeds 2 to 3 cm, for tumors requiring multiple laminectomy, and when bony infiltration is present. 
5	Persistent segmental cutaneous anesthesia after a brown recluse spider bite. Patients with brown recluse spider bites commonly suffer from pain, muscular aching, and a variety of local dysesthesias during the acute and resolution phases of toxin-induced injury. This is our first well-documented observation of persistent cutaneous anesthesia caused by a spider bite. The anesthetic area conformed to the distribution of a specific nerve, the transverse cervical cutaneous nerve. The identification of the spider as a brown recluse and the location of the bite over the nerve's usual pathway strongly suggest that the venom was responsible for this complication. 
4	Vasculitis as a paraneoplastic syndrome. Report of 11 cases and review of the literature. In a study of 222 patients with vasculitis, we identified 11 who had an associated neoplasia. Seven had hematological neoplasia and 4 had solid malignant tumors. In 4 patients vasculitis gave the first evidence of the neoplasia or of its recurrence. Nine of our patients had cutaneous vasculitis. The other 2 had vasculitis involving the intestine and resulted in acute abdomens. These 2 patients needed prednisone treatment for the vasculitis. Neoplasia should be considered in patients with vasculitis without an apparent cause. 
1	Treatment of metastatic melanoma with an autologous tumor-cell vaccine: clinical and immunologic results in 64 patients. We treated 64 patients with metastatic melanoma using a melanoma vaccine preceded by low-dose cyclophosphamide (CY), and monitored immunologic effects and antitumor activity. On day 0, the patients were given CY 300 mg/m2 intravenously. Three days later, they were injected intradermally with vaccine consisting of 10 to 25 x 10(6) autologous, enzymatically dissociated, cryopreserved, irradiated (25 Gy) tumor cells mixed with bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG). This treatment sequence was repeated every 28 days. Of 40 assessable patients with measurable metastases, five had responses, four complete and one partial, with a median duration of 10 months (7 to 84+ months). In six additional patients, we observed an antitumor response that seems to be peculiar to this vaccine therapy: the regression of metastatic lesions that appeared after the immunotherapy was begun. Delayed-type hypersensitivity (DTH) to autologous, mechanically dissociated melanoma cells that had not been exposed to extraneous antigens, such as enzymes or fetal calf serum, increased significantly following immunotherapy (day 0 v day 49, P less than .001; day 0 v day 161, P less than .001; day 0 v day 217, P = .021). Antitumor responses to the vaccine were strongly associated with DTH, as indicated by three observations: (1) eight of 10 patients who exhibited tumor regression had positive DTH, (2) in postsurgical adjuvant patients, there was a highly significant linear relationship (P less than .001) between the intensity of DTH to autologous melanoma cells and the time to recurrence of tumor, and (3) nine patients who developed DTH to the autologous melanoma cells in their original vaccine developed new metastases that failed to elicit DTH or elicited a much smaller response. In three cases, we were able to excise regressing tumors for histologic examination; such tumors were characterized by an intense infiltration of lymphocytes. This demonstration that an immune response to melanoma-associated antigens can be elicited in cancer-bearing patients provides some basis for optimism about the prospects for developing active immunotherapy that has practical therapeutic value. 
4	Major clinical diagnoses found among patients with Raynaud phenomenon from the general population. This study of 62 individuals with Raynaud phenomenon (RP) drawn from the general population of South Carolina shows a profile of associated diseases that is different from the one reported from hospital based studies. We found that connective tissue diseases affect a much smaller fraction of patients with RP than previously reported. Compared to RP negative controls, our RP positive group was found to suffer more frequently from a variety of diseases, both RP related and not RP related. 
1	Pedunculated soft-tissue mass on the alveolar gingiva [clinical conference] A case of peripheral ameloblastoma, a rare intraoral neoplasm, has been presented. The lesion appears most commonly as a mass on the mandibular lingual gingiva of patients in their fifth and sixth decades of life. The peripheral ameloblastoma does not share the aggressive nature of the intraosseous variant. The lesion has been overtreated in the past and warrants only a local supraperiosteal excision. 
5	Stunned myocardium and myocardial collagen damage: differential effects of single and repeated occlusions. It has been suggested that collagen loss and damage is responsible for the dysfunction seen in stunned myocardium. To test this hypothesis we compared collagen in canine hearts stunned by repeated occlusion with collagen in hearts stunned by a single occlusion. Regional contractile function was equally depressed in both groups: segment shortening at 1 hour after reperfusion averaged 37% +/- 9% versus 32% +/- 9% of preocclusion values in repeated and single occlusion models, respectively. Midmyocardial collagen content was not different in either single occlusion (10.5% +/- 0.4%) or repeated occlusion models (9.5% +/- 0.7%) when compared with nonischemic hearts (8.5 +/- 0.8%). Collagen damage, which was revealed with polarized light microscopy, was seen in 5 of 6 dogs after repeated occlusion but was not apparent after a single occlusion. Thus although both models of stunned myocardium produce similar dysfunction, there was no apparent collagen loss. Furthermore, collagen damage was only seen after repeated occlusion. Therefore it appears unlikely that collagen damage is a primary mechanism of stunned myocardium. 
5	Mechanism of antitumor activity of tumor necrosis factor alpha with hyperthermia in a tumor necrosis factor alpha-resistant tumor. Cells from a radiation-induced fibrosarcoma (RIF-1) are exceedingly resistant to tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha) in vitro. We tested whether the addition of mild hyperthermia (42.5 degrees C, 30 minutes) could enhance TNF-alpha activity against RIF-1 tumors growing in syngeneic hosts (C3H mice). TNF-alpha was administered intratumorally. Tumor cell killing essentially was not measurable following TNF-alpha, hyperthermia, or a combination of the two. Single-modality treatments also had no effect on tumor growth delay or on the x-ray dose (given 24 hours after the primary treatment) required to sterilize 50% of the tumors. The combination of TNF-alpha and hyperthermia, however, resulted in a marked increase in tumor doubling time and a highly significant reduction in the x-ray dose required to sterilize the tumors. Syngeneic lymph nodal lymphocytes and blood leukocytes did not appear to mediate the action of TNF-alpha on RIF-1 cells in vitro. Necrosis and hemorrhage were the most prominent histopathological alterations in the treated tumors. Electron microscopic studies 6 hours after therapy showed increased damage to capillary endothelial cells and accumulation of neutrophils in the capillaries of tumors treated with TNF-alpha with or without heat, suggesting that neutrophils may mediate the endothelial cell injury. These observations indicate a greater than additive tumoricidal effect of TNF-alpha with hyperthermia. Furthermore, they support the concept that the interaction between the two agents damages the vasculature, compromising the microcirculation and ultimately causing ischemic tumor necrosis. 
5	A prospective evaluation of the AO/ASIF universal femoral nail in the treatment of traumatic and reconstructive problems of the femur. Beginning in October 1986, we prospectively evaluated the AO/ASIF Universal Femoral Nail in the treatment of traumatic (89 nails) and reconstructive (11 nails) problems of the femur. For treatment of isolated femoral fractures, the mean time of patient positioning and nail insertion was 2.4 hours with a mean blood loss of 389 ml. Seventy-eight per cent of the patients were followed for a minimum of 12 months. There were no infections, one case of nail failure, two cases of screw fracture, and three nonunions. Sixteen nails have been uneventfully removed. The AO/ASIF femoral nail provides results comparable to other intramedullary interlocking devices. 
4	An unusual late complication following surgical repair of tetralogy of Fallot. A case is presented of extrusion of right ventricular outflow tract patch material through a mediastino-cutaneous fistula occurring five years after repair of tetralogy of Fallot. The focus of the mediastinal infection was an infected epicardial pacemaker electrode placed at the time of initial surgery. Subsequent echocardiographic studies showed minimal right ventricular outflow tract or pulmonary arterial dilatation, and, with no further surgery, the child is well after two and a half years follow-up. 
4	Sympathetic drive and vascular damage in hypertension and atherosclerosis. Current knowledge of the links between the sympathetic nervous system and vascular damage in hypertension and atherosclerosis is summarized. The main mechanisms leading to the structural changes of the arterial wall as a consequence of enhanced adrenergic drive are reported. Hemodynamic mechanisms, including increase in pressure leading to changes in the arterioles and alteration of flow pattern with impact mainly in the large arteries, respectively, account for the typical target organ damage observed in hypertension and is involved in the development of atherosclerotic lesions. Regarding the direct effect of catecholamines, the atherogenic effects of epinephrine and norepinephrine in the absence of changes in blood pressure and cholesterol levels have been demonstrated in vivo in monkeys and rabbits. In rats, catecholamine administration induces polyploidization of aortic smooth muscle cells in vivo and in vitro. Regarding the effects of lipid metabolism, adrenergic stimulation may induce free fatty acid transformation into triglycerides with secondary increase in very low density lipoprotein plasma levels and decrease of very low density lipoprotein transformation into high density lipoprotein through circulating lipoprotein lipase inhibition. Catecholamines may also increase cholesterol levels of the arterial wall, probably by triggering the acyl-cholesterol-acyl-transferase activity. Finally, indirect evidence of the pathogenetic role played by the sympathetic system in the development of vascular disease derives from the results of experiments showing that sympatholytic agents are capable of reducing both medial hypertrophy and atherogenesis. beta-Blockers, alpha- and beta-blockers, and centrally acting sympatholytic agents not only ameliorate hemodynamics but also appear to inhibit the direct effects of catecholamines on the arterial wall. 
3	Anton's syndrome in a patient with posttraumatic optic neuropathy and bifrontal contusions. We describe a patient who manifested Anton's syndrome after sustaining head trauma that resulted in optic nerve damage and bifrontal contusions. Denial of monocular blindness, generalized anosognosia, and confabulation were prominent neurobehavioral features. Anton's syndrome is most commonly encountered in patients with bilateral occipital cortex lesions. Patients previously described who demonstrated Anton's syndrome secondary to a peripheral lesion have had an associated delirium or profound dementia. Our case demonstrates that Anton's syndrome may occur in association with blindness from a peripheral lesion, even in the absence of a delirium or significant dementia. We suggest that the bifrontal dysfunction may have been a critical factor in the production of Anton's syndrome. Implications for the role of frontal lobe dysfunction in the genesis of anosognosia and confabulation are discussed. 
4	Intermittent pneumatic compression to prevent proximal deep venous thrombosis during and after total hip replacement. A prospective, randomized study of compression alone, compression and aspirin, and compression and low-dose warfarin. A prospective, randomized study of the effectiveness of intraoperative and postoperative use of intermittent pneumatic compression, alone or in combination with oral administration of either aspirin or low-dose warfarin, was done of a consecutive series of patients who had a total hip replacement and were more than thirty-nine years old. All patients began walking by the third postoperative day. One hundred and ninety-six patients who had 217 total hip arthroplasties were included. Twenty-eight per cent of the procedures were revisions of a previous total hip replacement or of an endoprosthesis, and the remainder were primary arthroplasties. Patients were randomized as to the type of prophylaxis that they received: intermittent pneumatic compression alone, seventy-six hips; intermittent pneumatic compression and aspirin, seventy-two hips; or intermittent pneumatic compression and low-dose warfarin, sixty-nine hips. Before discharge from the hospital, and at an average of seven days after the operation, all patients were evaluated for the presence of proximal deep-vein thrombosis with either venography on the side of the operation or with bilateral venous ultrasonography. The relative frequency with which thrombosis occurred in a proximal vein was not significantly different in the three groups; the over-all relative frequency was 10 per cent. Intermittent compression during and after the operation effectively reduces the rate of proximal-vein thrombosis after total hip replacement. With the number of patients in our study, the effectiveness of this technique could not be shown to be augmented by oral administration of either aspirin or low-dose warfarin. 
5	Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography in infantile cholestasis. The difficulty of distinguishing surgically correctable causes of conjugated hyperbilirubinaemia in infants from other causes means that some infants may undergo laparotomy and intraoperative cholangiography unnecessarily, and others may be referred for surgery too late. In an attempt to improve the diagnostic accuracy in infants with conjugated hyperbilirubinaemia when standard methods produced equivocal results, we have been using prototype paediatric duodenoscopes (PJF 7.5 and XPJF 8.0; Olympus) to perform endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP). From 159 infants with conjugated hyperbilirubinaemia, 11 were referred for ERCP, which was performed in nine. In four in whom bile ducts were definitely visualised laparotomy was avoided. Operative cholangiography confirmed patent bile ducts in one in whom visualisation had been uncertain. Three of four in whom bile ducts were not seen had extrahepatic biliary atresia. Visible bile drainage in the fourth excluded atresia. No major complications ensued but there was radiological evidence of gall bladder perforation in one (common hepatic duct block) and overinflation with air was a problem until finer cannulae (Wilson-Cook) were introduced. In appropriately selected patients with conjugated hyperbilirubinaemia, ERCP with paediatric duodenoscopes in experienced hands may provide useful diagnostic information. 
5	Physical examination and echo Doppler study in the assessment of femoral arterial complications following cardiac catheterization. Femoral arterial complications following cardiac catheterization have been well recognized. The development of an inguinal mass in these patients can represent a simple hematoma, a pseudoaneurysm, or an arteriovenous fistula. The utility of the physical examination in diagnosing these complications was assessed by using the echo Doppler study for comparison. This study shows that any single clinical sign should not be used in isolation, but a constellation of physical findings can suggest the correct diagnosis. 
3	Immunoassay of P2 protein in cerebrospinal fluid in neurological disorders. Cerebrospinal fluid samples were obtained at lumbar puncture from 53 patients with a wide variety of neurological disorders. Cerebrospinal fluid samples were tested for the presence of P2 protein, a constituent of myelin, with an enzyme linked immunosorbent assay technique using a specific polyclonal antibody. High concentrations of P2 in the cerebrospinal fluid paralleled a raised IgG index (clearance ratio), the presence of oligoclonal bands, as well as raised white cell counts or depressed albumin:IgG ratios. Twenty one patients had been diagnosed as having definite or probable multiple sclerosis and the remaining 32 had other conditions. Of the 13 patients with high positive P2, 12 (92%) were in the multiple sclerosis category; of the 40 patients with low (12) or undetectable (28) P2 concentrations, only nine (23%) were diagnosed as having multiple sclerosis. In this patient population the presence of high immunoreactive P2 concentrations in cerebrospinal fluid was closely associated with evidence of intrathecal immunoglobulin synthesis and with the clinical diagnosis of multiple sclerosis. On this basis it is suggested that immunoassay of P2 concentration in the cerebrospinal fluid may be of potential value in the investigation of patients with demyelinating disorders. 
5	Pulmonary malakoplakia in a patient with the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome. Differential diagnostic considerations. Malakoplakia is an unusual inflammatory condition characterized histopathologically by accumulations of benign macrophages, or von Hansemann's cells, that are associated with diagnostic intracellular and extracellular calcospherites, termed Michaelis-Gutmann bodies. Currently believed to represent an acquired defect of macrophage digestion, malakoplakia most commonly occurs in the urinary tract and is associated with a variety of infectious agents, notably gram-negative bacilli. We describe a patient with the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome who presented with a cavitating lingular mass. A transbronchial biopsy specimen revealed pulmonary malakoplakia, the seventh reported case of this condition and the second reported occurrence of pulmonary malakoplakia in a patient with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome. Microbiological cultures were positive for Rhodococcus equi. The significance of this finding, and the differential diagnosis of intra-alveolar histiocytic proliferations in patients with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome, is discussed. 
1	A clinical pilot study combining surgery with intraoperative pelvic hyperthermochemotherapy to prevent the local recurrence of rectal cancer. Intraoperative pelvic hyperthermochemotherapy (IOPHC) with mitomycin C (MMC) was prescribed for 14 patients with resectable advanced rectal cancer in an attempt to prevent a postoperative local recurrence. Immediately after rectal amputation and extended lymphadenectomy, IOPHC was performed using physiologic saline containing 40 micrograms/mL of MMC at 45.5 +/- 0.6 C for 90 minutes, with an apparatus devised for IOPHC. At the end of IOPHC, the esophageal temperature was 37.2 +/- 0.8 C and cooling was not required. Antitumor efficacy and complications in the IOPHC group were compared with findings in 12 rectal cancer patients who underwent surgery only within the same period of time. Operation time was not prolonged with IOPHC treatment. In cytologic examinations of the pelvic lavage just before IOPHC treatment, viable cancer cells were detected in 6 of the 14 patients but were never detected in the postoperative exudate drained from the pelvic cavity. Of the 12 patients in the control group, 2 had a local recurrence, while in the IOPHC group there was no local recurrence for 16.9 +/- 9.7 months at this writing. Postoperative complications did not differ between the groups. This IOPHC treatment is a favorable method in eradicating cancer cells for postoperative local recurrence of rectal cancer. 
5	Expressional potency of mRNAs encoding receptors and voltage-activated channels in the postmortem rat brain. The stability and integrity of mRNAs encoding neurotransmitter receptors and voltage-activated channels in the postmortem rat brain was investigated by isolating poly(A)+ mRNA, injecting it into Xenopus oocytes, and then examining the expression of functional neurotransmitter receptors and voltage-activated channels in the oocyte membrane by electrophysiological recording. This approach was also used to assess the stability of mRNAs in brains that were incubated in oxygenated mammalian Ringer's solution for various lengths of time and from brains that were freshly frozen and then thawed at room temperature. Oocytes injected with mRNA from up to 21-hr postmortem brains gave large agonist- and voltage-activated responses, indicating that mRNAs encoding neurotransmitter receptors and voltage-activated channels are relatively stable in postmortem brain tissue. In contrast, oocytes injected with mRNA from brains incubated in Ringer's solution exhibited smaller responses, and oocytes injected with mRNA from tissue that was frozen and then thawed displayed very small or undetectable responses. Northern blot analysis using a nucleic acid probe for rat brain Na(+)-channel mRNA indicated that the size of the Na+ currents in injected oocytes reflected the levels of mRNA for Na+ channels in the different mRNA preparations. Thus, the expressional potency of mRNAs encoding neurotransmitter receptors and voltage-activated channels is quite stable in postmortem brains in situ, but it is reduced if the brains are kept in oxygenated saline, and freezing and thawing of tissue results in rapid degeneration of mRNA. 
1	Cell cycling in bladder carcinoma determined by monoclonal antibody Ki67. Current methods of predicting prognosis in transitional cell carcinoma of the bladder fail to provide consistently reliable information about future tumour behaviour. The monoclonal antibody Ki67 recognises an antigen present in actively dividing cells and Ki67 reactivity has been shown to correlate with conventional prognostic indicators in several tumours. In this study, Ki67 antibody was used to determine the proportions of cells undergoing active division in 26 transitional cell carcinomas of the bladder. The proportion of cells stained in muscle invasive tumours (12.3 +/- 5.4%) was significantly greater than in superficial tumours (4.3 +/- 1.9%) and poorly differentiated tumours showed significantly greater proportions of cells staining compared with well or moderately well differentiated tumours. These results show that Ki67 reactivity correlates with high tumour stage and poor differentiation. Ki67 staining provides an easy method of determining tumour cell turnover that might provide additional prognostic information. 
1	Expression of aminopeptidase N (CD13) in mesenchymal tumors. For a long time, CD13 molecules have been considered to be restricted to myeloid cells and related neoplasms. Meanwhile, however, expression of CD13 has also been detected in some hepatocellular, gallbladder, renal, and lung carcinomas, and even in some fibrosarcomas and malignant melanomas. In this study, expression of CD13 antigen was immunohistochemically examined in non-neoplastic mesenchymal cells, along with 33 benign and 83 malignant mesenchymal tumors (MET) using CD13 monoclonal antibodies (MAb) My7, U71, WM-15, and MoU48. In non-neoplastic mesenchymal cells, expression of CD13 was restricted to perivascular fibrocytes/blasts, tissue histiocytes, osteoclasts, and to the perineurium of peripheral nerve trunks. Under neoplastic conditions, CD13 was detectable in some tumors of smooth muscle, fibrous, fibrohistiocytic, synovial, osteogenic, and peripheral nerve sheath origin, and even in some tumors of adipose tissue. Tumors of striated muscle origin, of autonomic ganglia, and of cartilage-forming tissues were CD13-negative throughout. Thus in most but not all tumors studied the pattern of expression of CD13 mirrors the situation found in their cells of origin. These findings enrich the data on expression of leukocyte differentiation antigens in extra-hematopoietic tissues. Expression of CD13, which meanwhile is known to be identical to aminopeptidase N, an important peptide-cleaving enzyme, in only some MET might reflect a special functional state of these neoplasms. 
1	Role of systemic therapy in advanced non-small-cell lung cancer. Increasing evidence supports the investigation of chemotherapy in patients with non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Randomized studies in patients with stage IV disease have shown increased survival in chemotherapy-treated patients compared to best supportive care and indicate the ability of chemotherapy to alter the natural history of this disease. Randomized studies involving adjuvant and neoadjuvant chemotherapy have also shown encouraging results. These studies and results of recent pilot studies utilizing neoadjuvant chemotherapy and concomitant chemoradiotherapy indicate a potential benefit from the use of chemotherapy in patients with NSCLC and call for its continued intensive investigation in clinical trials. 
4	Captopril-stimulated renal vein renin in hypertensive patients with or without renal artery stenosis. To examine the efficacy and usefulness of captopril-enhanced renal vein renin (RVR) measurements in detecting the functional significance of renal artery stenosis found in hypertensives, we compared these values in 22 patients with arteriographically documented renovascular hypertension due to unilateral (URVH: 14 patients) or bilateral renal artery stenosis (BRVH: 8 patients) and 12 patients with high renin essential hypertension (EHT). Before captopril administration, RVR ratio was less than 1.5 in 8 patients (36.4%) with renovascular hypertension and all patients (100%) with EHT. Captopril enhanced the lateralization of renal vein renin in renovascular hypertension; the postcaptopril RVR ratio was greater than 2.0 in 18 patients (81.8%) and greater than 1.5 in all the patients (100%). On the other hand, RVR ratio remained unchanged in most patients with EHT. There was no significant difference in the postcaptopril RVR ratios between URVH and BRVH. However, the postcaptopril RVR ratio was higher in atherosclerosis (10 patients) than in fibromuscular dysplasia (11 patients) (P less than .05). Captopril also elucidated contralateral renin suppression as expressed by a contralateral/peripheral renin ratio of less than 1.0, which was associated with a favorable outcome of unilateral surgical intervention. Captopril-stimulated RVR indices were valuable in detecting the functionally significant renal artery stenosis and predicting surgical curability in renovascular hypertension. 
4	Effects of anxiety on family members of patients with cardiac disease learning cardiopulmonary resuscitation. The effects of anxiety on learning cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) by family members of patients with cardiac disease was examined. Family members of hospitalized patients (n = 17), family members of nonhospitalized patients (n = 12), and a control group (n = 21) all took one of nine Heart Saver programs in which CPR was taught and performance evaluated. Subjects took the State Anxiety Inventory three times: immediately before the program, immediately after the performance test, and 2 months after completion of the program. Family members of hospitalized patients had significantly higher before-program anxiety scores than the other groups. This difference was not present immediately after the program or 2 months later. Family members of hospitalized patients showed a significant decline in anxiety over the three testing times. These outcomes support the benefit of teaching CPR to this group. 
3	Risks factors for cerebral infarction in good-grade patients after aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage and surgery: a prospective study. A prospective series of 265 patients with aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) of Grades I to III (Hunt and Hess classification) upon admission were evaluated as to neurological outcome and computerized tomography (CT) findings 1 to 3 years (mean 1.4 years) after the SAH and surgery. A total of 73 patients underwent acute surgery (within 72 hours after the bleed: Days 0 to 3), 86 were operated on subacutely (between Days 4 and 7), and 91 had late surgery (on Day 8 or later). Fifteen patients died before surgery was undertaken and another 20 patients died during the follow-up period. A total of 104 patients received nimodipine and the rest of the patients received either placebo (109 patients) or no medication (52 patients). A logistical regression analysis revealed the following prognostic factors for cerebral infarction, in order of importance: the amount of blood on the primary CT scan; postoperative angiographic vasospasm; the timing of the operation; and a history of hypertension. The use of nimodipine was associated with a significant reduction of cerebral infarcts visualized by CT scanning in patients who received intermediate or late surgery. In patients who underwent acute surgery no significant difference between the incidence of cerebral infarcts was observed. 
3	Experience with surgical treatment of Takayasu's disease. We reviewed 28 patients with Takayasu's disease to determine the incidence of stroke and its relationship to the involvement of the thoracic aortic arch and its branches. We describe surgical experiences with 10 of the 28 patients who required 21 vascular surgical procedures for critical thoracic aortic arch arterial stenoses, upper and lower extremity ischemia, and renal artery stenoses. Four of the 28 patients initially had a stroke caused by occlusion of one or more thoracic aortic arch arteries. Six of the 10 patients underwent 7 bypass procedures for critical thoracic arch stenoses. All have remained free of stroke for 5 or more years. Four patients had five anastomotic stenoses or graft occlusions in late follow-up; the development of these stenoses did not relate to disease activity at the time of the operative procedure. All bypass grafts originating from the subclavian axillary artery developed anastomotic stenoses; no anastomotic stenoses occurred in bypass grafts originating from the ascending aorta. In contrast to other reports, no anastomotic false aneurysms occurred. Occlusions of major aortic arch arteries in Takayasu's disease cause stroke. Bypass of critically stenoses aortic arch arteries protects against stroke and is best performed with grafts originating from the ascending aorta. Anastomotic stenoses but not anastomotic aneurysms are common. This study suggests that aggressive surgical treatment can be performed with good results. 
2	Mechanisms of gallstone formation in women. Effects of exogenous estrogen (Premarin) and dietary cholesterol on hepatic lipid metabolism. Our aim was to define mechanisms whereby conjugated estrogens (Premarin, exogenous estrogen; Ayerst Laboratories, New York) increase the risk of developing cholesterol gallstones and to determine the role, if any, of dietary cholesterol. We studied gallbladder motor function, biliary lipid composition and secretion, cholesterol absorption, cholesterol synthesis and esterification by peripheral blood mononuclear cells, the clearance of chylomicron remnants, and bile acid kinetics in 29 anovulatory women. 13 were studied on both a low (443 +/- 119 mumol/d) and high (2,021 +/- 262 mumol/d) cholesterol diet. Premarin increased the lithogenic index of bile (P less than 0.05), increased biliary cholesterol secretion (P less than 0.005), lowered chenodeoxycholate (CDCA) pool (P less than 0.001) and synthesis (P less than 0.05), altered biliary bile acid composition [( CA + DCA]/CDCA increases, P less than 0.005), stimulated cholesterol esterification (P less than 0.03), and enhanced the clearance of chylomicron remnants (P = 0.07). Increases in dietary cholesterol stimulated the biliary secretion of cholesterol (P = 0.07), bile acid (P less than 0.05), phospholipid (P = 0.07), and as a result, did not alter lithogenic index. The reduction in CDCA pool and synthesis by Premarin was reversed by increasing dietary cholesterol. Off Premarin, only 24% of the increase in cholesterol entering the body in the diet was recovered as biliary cholesterol or newly synthesized bile acid. On Premarin, 68% of this increase in cholesterol was recovered as these biliary lipids. We conclude that Premarin increases biliary cholesterol by enhancing hepatic lipoprotein uptake and inhibiting bile acid synthesis. These actions of Premarin divert dietary cholesterol into bile. 
5	Anaplastic carcinoma presenting with cervical lymphadenopathy. We describe 50 patients with anaplastic carcinoma presenting with a mass in the neck. The diagnosis of anaplastic carcinoma was confirmed by immunocytochemistry to exclude very poorly differentiated squamous carcinomas, amelanotic melanoma, and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. The primary site was established immediately in 26 patients (25 in the head and neck; 1 in the lung); a further 4 had radiological evidence of a primary tumour in the lung. The primary site was established later in 1 patient, in the ethmoid sinuses. In 20 patients the primary site was never established. The commonest primary site was the nasopharynx. The basic treatment policy was radiotherapy, although 20% of patients with a known primary tumour, and 50% of those without, were untreated. The 2-year survival was about 30% in both groups, and did not differ significantly. Prognostic factors for survival were age, performance status, and T status of the primary tumour. Sex, node status, node level, and laterality of nodes, were not. 
3	The South Karelia Air Pollution Study. The effects of malodorous sulfur compounds from pulp mills on respiratory and other symptoms. The paper mills in South Karelia, the southeast part of Finland, are responsible for releasing a substantial amount of malodorous sulfur compounds such as hydrogen sulfide (H2S), methyl mercaptan (CH3SH), and methyl sulfides [(CH3)2S and (CH3)2S2], into ambient air. In the most polluted residential area the annual mean concentrations of hydrogen sulfide and methyl mercaptan are estimated to be 8 and 2 to 5 micrograms/m3 and the highest daily average concentration 100 and 50 micrograms/m3. The annual mean and highest daily concentrations of sulfur dioxide (SO2) are very low. We studied the effects of malodorous sulfur compounds on eye, nasal and respiratory symptoms, and headache in adults. A cross-sectional self-administered questionnaire was distributed in February 1987 and responded to by 488 adults living in a severely (n = 198), a moderately (n = 204), and a nonpolluted community (n = 86). This included questions about occurrence of the symptoms of interest during the previous 4 wk and 12 months and individual, behavioral, and other environmental determinants of the symptoms. The response rate was 83%. The odds ratios (OR) for symptoms experienced often or constantly in severely versus nonpolluted and moderately versus nonpolluted communities were estimated in logistic regression analysis controlling potential confounders. The odds ratios for eye (moderate exposure OR 11.70, Cl95% 2.33 to 58.65; severe exposure OR 11.78, Cl95% 2.35 to 59.09) and nasal symptoms (OR 2.01, Cl95% 0.97 to 4.15; OR 2.19, Cl95% 1.06 to 4.55) and cough (OR 1.89, Cl95% 0.61 to 5.86; OR 3.06, Cl95% 1.02 to 9.29) during the previous 12 months were increased, with a dose-response pattern. 
1	Systems used to study the nature of the leukemic cell and predict treatment outcome in patients with myeloproliferative disorders. Cell culture techniques have been used to study normal and leukemic hematopoiesis. Investigations provided data on the nature of the clonogenic leukemic cell, its patterns of in vitro growth, role of stimulating factors, and effects of chemotherapeutic agents. Assay systems developed to study leukemic progenitor cells or self-renewal capacity have been useful clinically as predictive indicators of success of remission-induction therapy and have allowed testing of drug sensitivity in vitro. Alternative approaches using short- and long-term suspension cultures have provided systems to evaluate leukemic cells, including nonclonogenic, biochemical, and kinetic events. In vitro systems have been introduced to measure cell cycle events accurately and to identify metabolic mechanisms of drug resistance. The information provided by all of these systems has allowed a more comprehensive and multifocal characterization of the nature of the leukemic process and has better directed our approach to treatment. 
1	Complications of stapled anastomoses in anterior resection for rectal carcinoma: colorectal anastomosis versus coloanal anastomosis. Postoperative results of 48 patients who underwent anterior resection using the EEA-stapler were evaluated. In all but 2 cases the indication for surgery was colorectal carcinoma. In 24 patients an anastomosis was created above the 5 cm level (above the anal verge: colorectal anastomosis) and in 24 at the 0-5 cm level (coloanal anastomosis). There was no perioperative mortality. The only complication observed in the colorectal anastomosis group was one case of late anastomotic stenosis. In the coloanal anastomosis group there were 4 cases with early anastomosis leaks, 3 cases with late stenosis and 5 cases with various degrees of late fecal incontinence, ultimately resulting in a permanent diverting stoma in 5 (10.4%) patients. We conclude that for rectal tumors the EEA-stapled anterior resection provides excellent functional results in most cases. Stapled coloanal anastomoses more often demonstrate various (early and late) complications. Nevertheless in spite of chronic discomfort, many patients still prefer their complaints to a permanent stoma. 
4	The Greenfield filter as the primary means of therapy in venous thromboembolic disease. During a five year period at Akron City Hospital, 165 Greenfield filters were placed in 165 patients. Of this group, 78 patients were available for long term analysis, and of these, 42 did not receive anticoagulation treatment for venous thromboembolic diseases, either acutely or on an outpatient basis. An analysis of the outcome for these 42 patients who had the Greenfield filter only as the primary mode of therapy for the disease included chart review and asking each person a standard set of questions. Leg swelling was the most common complaint, occurring in 33 per cent of patients. Venous stasis ulceration occurred in two patients and recurrent deep venous thrombosis occurred in one patient. When compared with a historical control group with venous thromboembolic disease that was treated with anticoagulation alone, the incidence of these sequelae in Greenfield-treated patients was not significantly different. Finally, in this review, the Greenfield filter is better than 95 per cent effective in the prevention of pulmonary embolism. This is no less effective than anticoagulation alone, the efficacy of which is 95 to 98 per cent. The placement of a Greenfield filter is a safe procedure that can usually be done after a local anesthetic was administered to the patient with a complication rate of less than 10 per cent. Unfortunately, major complications of anticoagulation (usually hemorrhage) are relatively common at a rate of 2 to 15 per cent, and occur more frequently in the older population. It is for reasons of safety of therapy and of an equal or better efficacy that the Greenfield filter is recommended in a broader range of clinical circumstances. In particular, it is concluded that the Greenfield filter should be used as a primary means of therapy in venous thromboembolic disease, particularly in those patients who are more than 65 years of age, when the risks of anticoagulation are most threatening. 
5	Intralaryngotracheal thyroid. A case of intralaryngotracheal thyroid in a 57-year-old man is presented. The treatment modalities are considered and the previous literature is reviewed. 
2	Endoscopic appearance and significance of functional lymphangiectasia of the duodenal mucosa. Intestinal lymphangiectasia is found in a wide variety of pathologic conditions. Functional lymphangiectasia has not been well characterized. We report 20 patients followed for 9 to 55 months (mean 30 months) after incidental detection at endoscopy of lymphangiectasia. Our study indicates that functional lymphangiectasia is not pathologic and does not warrant repeat endoscopy in the absence of other clinical indications. 
5	Elective diagnostic laparoscopy. Laparoscopy developed as a science at the turn of the century, and many scientists assisted in the evolution of this technique. However, it was many years before the multiple trocar system was developed that allowed internal organs to be moved and biopsies to be obtained. This has led to the development of numerous indications for elective diagnostic laparoscopy. Adequate preparation and attention to instrumentation ensure the safety of this operation. Elective diagnostic laparoscopy is a useful adjunct to many other diagnostic modalities such as, for instance, the assessment of abdominal pain, abdominal masses, fever of unknown origin, and gastrointestinal bleeding. In many other circumstances, such as the assessment of oncology cases, this modality is superior to conventional radiology because biopsy specimens may be obtained. If the procedure is correctly performed, the diagnostic yield is extremely high and the morbidity and mortality are low. The role of this important technique should not be underestimated by today's practicing surgeon. 
5	Long-term outcome following anterior cerebral artery ligation for ruptured anterior communicating artery aneurysms. The long-term prognosis (15 years) was determined for 17 patients who had undergone anterior cerebral artery (ACA) ligation as the sole treatment for an anterior communicating artery aneurysm. The number of early and late rebleeds was lower than expected from previously ruptured aneurysms. Late ischemia was not a major complication while late postoperative epilepsy occurred in 19% of survivors. In a review of previously published series, ACA ligation appears to have significantly reduced the rates of both early and late rebleeding. This study helps to define the late results of "conservative" operations for ruptured aneurysms. 
4	Prolongation of ventricular refractoriness by class Ia antiarrhythmic drugs in the prevention of ventricular tachycardia induction. The effects of class la antiarrhythmic drugs (procainamide, quinidine) on the right ventricular effective refractory period (VERP) and intraventricular conduction time were assessed during serial invasive electrophysiologic studies for sustained monomorphic ventricular tachycardia (VT). In 47 patients with remote myocardial infarction, sustained VT was inducible by up to two extrastimuli after the basic drive at one of two basic cycle lengths at the right ventricular apex. With oral drug administration, sustained VT was no longer inducible (group I) in 27 patients but remained inducible (group II) in 20 with the same protocol. Class la drugs prolonged the VERP in both groups, but there was greater lengthening when drugs were effective (e.g., +32 +/- 14 msec in group I vs +12 +/- 19 msec in group II; p less than 0.005, basic cycle length 600 to 700 msec). Prolongation of the VERP by greater than 30 msec had an 88% positive predictive value for prevention of sustained VT induction. In all except one patient in group I, drugs prolonged the VERP such that the coupling intervals that had resulted in sustained VT induction under control conditions were no longer attainable. In contrast, conduction time through the ventricle (surface QRS duration) in sinus rhythm and during right ventricular pacing was prolonged similarly regardless of efficacy (e.g., +33 +/- 21 msec vs +27 +/- 27 msec at a cycle length of 400 msec). The presence of similar plasma levels of drug did not imply equivalent prolongation of the VERP in the two groups. These results suggest that greater prolongation of the VERP by oral procainamide or quinidine correlates with drug efficacy against VT induction and is a better predictor of drug effect than achievement of a "therapeutic plasma level.". 
3	Ganglioglioma: a clinical study with long-term follow-up. Gangliogliomas are uncommon tumors of mixed neoplastic glial and neuronal elements. Because of their low incidence, few large series exist that fully describe the clinical characteristics of patients afflicted with this tumor. We have reviewed the medical records of 20 patients at Duke University Medical Center with histologically proven gangliogliomas. These patients typically presented within the first three decades of life and their most common presenting symptom was seizures. Therapies included surgical resection, either partial or total, radiation therapy, and/or chemotherapy. Long-term follow-up was achieved by chart review and by telephone interview. Patients who underwent gross total resection alone seemed to fare the best when comparing all treatment groups, and we therefore recommend this as the main form of treatment. 
4	Familial paroxysmal kinesigenic ataxia and continuous myokymia. A large family with paroxysmal ataxia and continuous myokymic discharges is described. The disorder is of autosomal dominant inheritance. During attacks coordination of movements and balance are disturbed; often a postural tremor of the head and the hands and fine twitching in some of the facial and hand muscles are present. The attacks usually last a few minutes and may occur several times per day. They first appear in childhood and tend to abate after early adulthood. The attacks are frequently precipitated by kinesigenic stimuli similar to those in paroxysmal kinesigenic choreoathetosis. Their occurrence can be reduced or prevented by carbonic anhydrase inhibitors. Between attacks a slight postural tremor and ataxia was found in a few of the elderly affected members. Fine rippling myokymia was obvious in a few and could be detected on close inspection in about half of the adults. Electromyography (EMG) showed myokymic discharges in all affected members. The characteristics and reactivity of this myokymic activity suggest multiple impulse generation in the peripheral nerves. 
3	Sensations during chest tube removal. Nurses prepare patients for chest tube removal, yet little has been written to indicate the sensations to be expected during this routine procedure. The sensations reported by patients and factors that could influence those sensations were examined in this study. The sample consisted of 36 patients after thoracic surgery (24 men and 12 women), all of whom were scheduled to have either a mediastinal or a pleural tube removed. They reported their sensations and the intensity of those sensations (using a 100 mm visual analog scale) within 15 minutes after tube removal. The most frequently reported sensation during chest tube removal was burning, followed by pain and pulling with mean intensities of 64, 62, and 45, respectively. Subjects reported having few sensations after the tube was removed with only five reporting soreness in the chest. The sensations and intensities did not differ for those who did and did not receive analgesia or for those having a pleural tube versus a mediastinal tube removed. The sensations were similar for the old and young subjects with younger subjects reporting higher intensities. Women reported pain more frequently than men, but the intensities of the sensations reported by men and women were not significantly different. The sensations reported during chest tube removal differ from those described in the literature and can be used to prepare patients more appropriately for chest tube removal. 
4	Placebo controlled trial of xamoterol versus digoxin in chronic atrial fibrillation. Thirteen patients in chronic atrial fibrillation with a normal resting heart rate but with exercise tachycardia and episodes of bradycardia were randomised to treatment periods of two weeks on xamoterol (200 mg twice daily), low dose digoxin, or placebo, in a blind crossover study. The results (mean SEM) of symptom scores, a treadmill exercise test, and 24 hour ambulatory electrocardiographic monitoring were obtained. Xamoterol improved symptom scores and controlled exercise heart rate better than digoxin. Xamoterol was better than digoxin or placebo in reducing the heart rate response to exercise and tended to improve exercise duration. Xamoterol, by reducing the daytime maximum hourly heart rate and increasing the night time minimum hourly heart rate, significantly reduced the difference between the two compared with placebo. In contrast, digoxin tended to reduce both the maximum and minimum hourly heart rates through day and night. Both the frequency and duration of ventricular pauses were reduced by xamoterol but tended to increase with digoxin. Xamoterol reduced both the circadian variation in ventricular response to atrial fibrillation and exercise tachycardia by modulating the heart rate according to the prevailing level of sympathetic activity. These changes were translated into symptomatic benefit for the patients studied. 
4	Embolism during caesarean section. We investigated the occurrence of gas embolism during Caesarean section using a Doppler ultrasound probe and found that it occurs between uterine incision and delivery. Embolism is less common during general anaesthesia than has been reported during regional anaesthesia. Both ruptured membranes and a protracted uterine incision to delivery interval predispose to embolism. 
4	Nicotine impairs reflex renal nerve and respiratory activity in deoxycorticosterone acetate-salt rats. Smoking exacerbates the increase in arterial pressure in hypertension. The effect of nicotine on the baroreceptor-mediated reflex responses of renal nerve activity (RNA), heart rate, and respiratory activity (minute diaphragmatic activity [MDA]) after bolus injections of phenylephrine was compared in deoxycorticosterone acetate (DOCA)-salt sensitive and normotensive rats. Osmotic minipumps that dispensed either nicotine (2.4 mg/kg/day) or saline were implanted in DOCA and normotensive rats for 18 days. Anesthetized DOCA-nicotine, DOCA-saline, control-nicotine, and control-saline rats had mean arterial pressures (MAP) of 117 +/- 3, 110 +/- 9, 90 +/- 3, and 89 +/- 5 mm Hg, respectively. Nicotine decreased the sensitivity (p less than 0.05) of baroreceptor reflex control of RNA (% delta RNA/delta MAP) in the DOCA-nicotine rats (-0.92 +/- 0.08) compared with the DOCA-saline (-1.44 +/- 0.16), control-nicotine (-1.45 +/- 0.08), or control-saline (-1.45 +/- 0.21) rats. The reflex decrease in respiratory activity (% delta MDA/delta MAP x 100) was impaired (p less than 0.01) in both control-nicotine (-24.5 +/- 3.3) and DOCA-nicotine (-18.2 +/- 4.6) rats compared with control-saline (-59.2 +/- 9.1) and DOCA-saline (-52.5 +/- 9.9) rats. The reflex decrease in heart rate (absolute delta HR/delta MAP) in both DOCA-nicotine (1.56 +/- 0.17) and control-nicotine (1.54 +/- 0.24) rats was augmented compared with DOCA-saline and control-saline rats (0.91 +/- 0.12 and 0.97 +/- 0.14). 
2	Persistent rectal ulcer associated with human papillomavirus type 33 in a patient with AIDS: successful treatment with isotretinoin. Rectal dysplasia and carcinoma associated with human papillomavirus infection are increasing in prevalence among homosexual men, particularly those infected with the human immunodeficiency virus. We report a case involving a 39-year-old homosexual man with AIDS who developed a persistent rectal ulcer. A biopsy of the ulcer revealed severe squamous dysplasia, and human papillomavirus type 33 was detected in rectal tissue with use of in situ DNA hybridization. This genotype of virus has not been previously associated with anal or rectal dysplasia in homosexual men, including those infected with the human immunodeficiency virus. The rectal ulcer resolved after 2 months of oral therapy with 60 mg/d of isotretinoin, a retinoid. 
5	The t(15;17) translocation of acute promyelocytic leukaemia fuses the retinoic acid receptor alpha gene to a novel transcribed locus. Retinoic acid is a vitamin A derivative with striking effects on development and cell differentiation. Several nuclear retinoic acid receptors (RARs), acting as ligand-inducible transcription factors, have been characterized and indirect evidence suggests that they have distinct roles. One of the most intriguing properties of retinoic acid is its ability to induce in vivo differentiation of acute promyelocytic leukaemia (APL) cells into mature granulocytes, leading to morphological complete remissions. Because the RAR alpha gene maps to chromosome 17q21 (ref. 14), close to the t(15;17) (q21-q11-22) translocation specifically associated with APL, we analysed RAR alpha gene structure and expression in APL cells. We report here that, in one APL-derived cell line, the RAR alpha gene has been translocated to a locus, myl, on chromosome 15, resulting in the synthesis of a myl/RAR alpha fusion messenger RNA. Using two probes located on either side of the cloned breakpoint, we have found genomic rearrangements of one or other locus in six patients out of eight, demonstrating that the RAR alpha and/or myl genes are frequently rearranged in APL and the breakpoints are clustered. These findings strongly implicate retinoic acid receptor alpha in leukaemogenesis. 
5	Hypothermia and acidosis worsen coagulopathy in the patient requiring massive transfusion. Massive transfusion may cause abnormalities of electrolytes, clotting factors, pH, and temperature and may occur in a scenario of refractory coagulopathy and irreversible shock. Identification of correctable variables to improve survival is complicated by the interplay of this pathophysiology. Temperature may be an under-appreciated problem in the genesis of coagulopathy. In vitro studies have demonstrated that platelet function and vascular response are critically temperature-dependent. We reviewed the records of 45 trauma patients without head injury or co-morbid medical illness who required massive transfusions. The mean Injury Severity Score was 55 +/- 6, a mean of 22.5 +/- 5 units of blood was transfused, and mortality was 33%. Nonsurvivors were more likely to have had penetrating injury (88% versus 55%), received more transfusions (26.5 +/- 9 versus 18.6 +/- 1, p less than 0.05), had lower pH (pH 7.04 +/- 0.06 versus 7.18 +/- 0.02, p less than 0.05), had lower core temperature (31 +/- 1 degree C versus 34 +/- 1 degree C, p less than 0.01), and had a higher incidence of clinical coagulopathy (73% versus 23%). Severe hypothermia (temperature less than 34 degrees C) occurred in 80% of the nonsurvivors and in 36% of survivors. Patients who were hypothermic and acidotic developed clinically significant bleeding despite adequate blood, plasma, and platelet replacement. Avoidance or correction of hypothermia may be critical in preventing or correcting coagulopathy in the patient receiving massive transfusion. 
1	The effect of graded doses of insulin on peripheral glucose uptake and lactate release in cancer cachexia. With the euglycemic clamp technique, we evaluated the effects of graded doses of insulin on glucose turnover rates and forearm lactate balance in five weight-losing patients with cancer before surgery and five age- and weight-matched healthy volunteers (control subjects). Insulin was infused sequentially at increasing rates of 0.5 (low physiologic), 1.0 (high physiologic), and 4.0 (supraphysiologic) mU/kg.min for 120 minutes each. Concurrently, rates of glucose appearance and disappearance were derived from [3-3H] glucose infusion. The mean postabsorptive rate of glucose appearance in patients (2.9 +/- 0.1 mg/kg.min) was significantly higher (p less than 0.02) than that of control subjects (1.98 +/- 0.16 mg/kg.min). Complete suppression of endogenous glucose production occurred at high physiologic insulin concentrations. With progressive insulin infusion, the rate of glucose disappearance increased to 3.6 +/- 1.2, 8.7 +/- 0.8, and 13.7 +/- 1.1 mg/kg/min in control subjects and 2.9 +/- 0.4, 5.3 +/- 0.3, and 10.9 +/- 0.9 mg/kg.min in patients, significantly different from that of control subjects (p less than 0.05) during the intermediate (high physiologic) insulin infusion. A comparable slight increase in arterial plasma lactate concentration was observed in both groups with progressive hyperinsulinemia. Baseline peripheral lactate flux was identical in patients (-272 +/- 56 nmol/100 gm.min) and in controls (-271 +/- 57 nmol/100 gm.min). Progressive physiologic hyperinsulinemia resulted in significantly (p less than 0.05) augmented peripheral lactate efflux in patients (-824 +/- 181 nmol/100 gm.min) compared with control subjects (-287 +/- 64 nmol/100 gm.min). Supraphysiologic insulin abolished this increased lactate efflux in patients. Postabsorptive rates of endogenous glucose appearance in weight-losing patients with cancer were elevated, but complete suppression was achieved with insulin concentrations in the physiologic range. Total body glucose use was diminished in these patients, consistent with a state of insulin resistance. This impaired insulin action on peripheral glucose use was associated with an increase in peripheral lactate release in patients. 
4	Dietary fats and oils in cardiac arrhythmia in rats. The effect of long-term feeding of various dietary fats and oils on cardiac arrhythmia was studied in an animal model of sudden cardiac death. After confirmation that a dietary supplement of saturated animal fat (SF) increased the animals' susceptibility to develop cardiac arrhythmia under ischemic stress whereas the polyunsaturated fatty acids of sunflower seed oil (SSO) reduced this susceptibility, we found that diets supplemented with either chemically refined palm oil (PO-I) or physically refined palm oil (PO-II) gave results that were generally intermediate in value between the SF and the SSO groups. However, during reperfusion of a previously ischemic heart, both PO-I- and PO-II-supplemented diets appeared to be as effective as SSO in reducing ventricular premature beats. In addition, the incidence of animals displaying severe ventricular fibrillation was much less after palm-oil feeding than it was after SF feeding. These preliminary results warrant further investigation of the potential antiarrhythmic effects of commercial palm oil. 
4	Holter monitoring of ventricular arrhythmias in a randomised, controlled study of intravenous streptokinase in acute myocardial infarction. The occurrence of ventricular arrhythmias attributed to streptokinase treatment in acute myocardial infarction is not well defined. Holter monitoring was performed for 24 hours in 81 patients with suspected acute myocardial infarction randomised in a ratio of 2:1 to intravenous streptokinase 1.5 x 10(6) IU (n = 55) or placebo infusion (n = 26) 6.7 hours (mean) after the onset of symptoms. No episodes of ventricular fibrillation were recorded. For the whole 24 hour period and during the first three hours after the start of treatment the incidence and frequency of ventricular arrhythmias were similar in the patients randomised to streptokinase and to placebo. But when the results in patients randomised "early" after the onset of symptoms of suspected acute myocardial infarction were analysed separately the frequency of abnormal complexes, pairs, runs, and repetitive arrhythmias seemed to be higher in patients allocated to streptokinase. This may reflect arrhythmias associated with reperfusion. 
5	Hypothalamic glucocorticoid implants prevent fetal ovine adrenocorticotropin secretion in response to stress. We evaluated the role of the hypothalamic paraventricular nucleus (PVN) in control of ACTH secretion in fetal sheep. Dexamethasone (DEX, 700 micrograms) (n = 6) or cholesterol (CHOL, 700 micrograms) (n = 5) implants were placed bilaterally 2 mm lateral to PVN of fetal sheep at 108 to 111 days of gestation (dga). After 5 days recovery, fetuses were challenged with: 1) hypotension (50% drop of blood pressure), 2) hypoxemia (fall of greater than 5 mm Hg in fetal PaO2), and 3) corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) (10 micrograms iv, single injection to fetus). Hypotension and hypoxemia were repeated after 125 dga. Compared with CHOL, DEX fetuses had lower average concentrations of ACTH in plasma after hypotension [23 +/- 0.5 vs. 149 +/- 83.8 and 31 +/- 13.1 vs. 101 +/- 31.3 pg ml-1 at less than 125 and more than 125 dga, respectively (mean +/- SEM, P less than 0.05)] and during hypoxemia [11 +/- 1.6 vs. 292 +/- 152.8 and 33 +/- 9.4 vs. 304 +/- 91.3 pg ml-1 at less than 125 and more than 125 dga, respectively (P less than 0.05)]. DEX and CHOL responses to CRH at 122 to 127 dga (10 micrograms iv) were not different (38 +/- 23.9 vs. 92 +/- 26.7 pg ml-1, respectively). Immunocytochemistry demonstrated that CRH was decreased in PVN and eliminated from median eminence in DEX, but not in CHOL fetuses. Arginine vasopressin (AVP) immunostaining of PVN of DEX and CHOL fetuses was similar; however, unlike CHOL, DEX fetuses showed no AVP immunostaining of the external zone of median eminence. These results show that, in fetal sheep, high concentrations of glucocorticoid near the fetal PVN prevent increases in plasma ACTH secretion seen in controls in response to hypotension and hypoxemia, and exert at least part of their effect at the level of the CRH- and AVP-producing neurons located in the PVN. 
2	Changes in the postenteropathic form of the hemolytic uremic syndrome in children. An analysis was made of clinical and laboratory findings in children with the diarrheal form of the hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS) treated at The Children's Hospital, Birmingham between 1970 und 1987. From 1982 the rate of referral increased, the prodromal illness more often consisted of bloody diarrhea, and the mean age at presentation doubled from 2 to 4 years. For patients with a good outcome there was an excess of males in the period 1970-81, and females in the period 1982-87. Moreover, in the years 1982-87 the disorder was distinguished from that of the earlier time by a positive correlation between adverse outcome and both neutrophil leukocytosis and a higher hemoglobin concentration at presentation. Prognostic scores obtained by logistic regression analysis were specific for each period. From July 1983 stool samples were analyzed for verocytotoxin-producing Escherichia coli (VTEC) and neutralizable verotoxin. Positive results were obtained in 39% of cases. The nature of HUS has changed and the new form of the disorder is associated with VTEC infection. 
2	A nongastrin malignant ampullary tumor causing gastric acid and pepsin hypersecretion. A case report. We report a case of multiple duodenal ulcers with gastric hypersecretion due to a nongastrin secretagogue produced by a malignant tumor of the pancreas in a 78-year-old man. The case resembled a Zollinger-Ellison syndrome (ZES) with high acid output (basal acid output 27, sham meal-stimulated 37, maximum acid output 47 mEq/h), but with fasting gastrin 43 pg/ml, nonresponsive to secretin. As in ZES, pepsin output was comparatively low, and secretion was inhibitable by atropine (50% inhibited by 1 microM). The tumor removed at surgery contained less than 1 ng gastrin per gram, but was many times more potent than pentagastrin in stimulating acid from a lumen-perfused rat stomach. The tumor also contained cholecystokinin (CCK-8 and CCK-33), motilin, insulin, and somatostatin, which were also present in adjacent normal pancreas; in addition, the tumor contained pancreatic polypeptide and pancreatic cancer-associated antigen. This case represents a rare syndrome due to an as yet undefined peptide secreted by a (frequently malignant) pancreatic endocrine tumor and masquerading as ZES. This is the first report of studies of pepsin secretion and of the effect of atropine, suggesting that the physiologic effects of the secretagogue resemble that of gastrin. 
5	Simultaneous occurrence of mitral valve prolapse and systolic anterior motion in hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. This report describes the simultaneous occurrence of mitral valve prolapse (MVP) and systolic anterior motion (SAM) in hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HC). In 25 patients (aged 7 to 62 years, mean 29), 15 (60%) of whom were male, distal portions of the anterior or posterior mitral leaflets approached or made midsystolic contact with the ventricular septum, whereas the proximal portion of the mitral leaflets showed marked cephalad excursion into the left atrium, 5 to 15 mm beyond the mitral annular plane. Three mitral valves that were available for gross visual inspection were not morphologically typical of patients with primary MVP. Clinical features and natural history (1 to 14 years [mean 6] of follow-up), cardiac dimensions, and distribution of left ventricular hypertrophy defined in the study patients did not appear to differ distinctly from those in the overall referral population of patients with HC evaluated at our institution. Hence, patients with HC may show a striking pattern of mitral valvular motion involving SAM into the left ventricular outflow tract, as well as MVP; this prolapse motion is probably due to anatomic disproportion between the mitral valve and the small left ventricular cavity rather than to the coexistence of 2 separate disease entities. Such patients further define the great diversity evident within the broad clinical spectrum of HC. 
5	Intrapleural tetracycline for the prevention of recurrent spontaneous pneumothorax. Results of a Department of Veterans Affairs cooperative study This prospective, multicenter, randomized, "unblinded," controlled clinical trial was designed to determine if the intrapleural instillation of 1500 mg of tetracycline hydrochloride would be effective in diminishing the ipsilateral rate of recurrence for spontaneous pneumothorax. During the 4-year enrollment period, 113 patients were assigned to the tetracycline group; 116 patients were assigned to the control group. During the 5-year study period, the recurrence rate in the tetracycline group (25%) was significantly less than that in the control group (41%). Use of tetracycline seemed to reduce the recurrence rates for patients with either primary or secondary spontaneous pneumothorax and for patients with either an initial or a recurrent pneumothorax. We conclude that the intrapleural administration of tetracycline in patients with spontaneous pneumothorax significantly reduces the rate of ipsilateral recurrence but is associated with intense chest pain. Intrapleural tetracycline therapy is indicated for patients with a spontaneous pneumothorax who are hospitalized and are treated with tube thoracostomy. 
2	Cytomegalovirus colitis in AIDS: presentation in 44 patients and a review of the literature. As part of a double-blind, placebo-controlled study of ganciclovir in cytomegalovirus (CMV) colitis, the clinical characteristics of 44 patients enrolled at one center were analyzed in detail. All were homosexual men who had CMV on colonic biopsy. CMV colitis was the index diagnosis for acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) in 11 (25%) of the 44 patients. All had diarrhea, but it was intermittent in 13 patients (30%). Bleeding was uncommon, but 35 patients (80%) were febrile (median temperature of 38.9 degrees C). Weight loss was reported by 39 patients (89%), among whom the median loss was 6.8 kg. Endoscopy revealed normal colonic mucosa but CMV on biopsy in 11 patients (25%). Colonoscopic biopsies positive for CMV were found only in the cecum in 7 (39%) of 18 patients. Most patients (54%) had received zidovudine before the diagnosis of CMV colitis. The median time to the development of CMV colitis after the diagnosis of AIDS was 16 months in those patients who had received zidovudine and 3 months in those who had not (p less than 0.02). We conclude that CMV colitis can present early in AIDS and often with such nonspecific signs as fever, intermittent diarrhea, weight loss, and hematochezia. Importantly, it can appear normal on colonoscopy and occurs frequently only in the right colon, necessitating full colonoscopy and multiple biopsies for accurate diagnosis. 
2	Portacaval shunt versus endoscopic sclerotherapy in the elective treatment of variceal hemorrhage. Eighty-two consecutive Child-Campbell class A and B cirrhotic patients were included in a prospective controlled trial to assess the efficacy and safety of portacaval anastomosis vs. endoscopic sclerotherapy as elective treatment of variceal hemorrhage. Forty-one patients were randomized to portacaval anastomosis and 41 to sclerotherapy. After excluding dropouts, 34 patients were treated with portacaval anastomosis and 35 with sclerotherapy. The incidence of variceal rebleeding during follow-up (mean +/- SD, 20.6 +/- 14.2 months) was significantly higher in the sclerotherapy than in the portacaval groups, either considering the overall treated group or only patients completing sclerotherapy (40% and 25% vs. 2.9%; P = 0.0002 and P = 0.01, respectively). The 2-year probability of suffering from at least one episode of hepatic encephalopathy was significantly higher in patients submitted to portacaval anastomosis than in those treated with endoscopic sclerotherapy (40% vs. 12%; P = 0.04). However, disabling encephalopathy only appeared in 3 of 34 patients who underwent surgery (8.8%). Early and long-term mortality did not differ between the therapeutic groups; 2-year survival rates were 83% for portacaval anastomosis and 79% for sclerotherapy. It is concluded that portacaval anastomosis is more effective than endoscopic sclerotherapy in preventing variceal rebleeding in spite of the greater incidence of hepatic encephalopathy. The role of portacaval anastomosis in the elective treatment of variceal rebleeding should be reassessed. 
4	The effect of low-dose warfarin on the risk of stroke in patients with nonrheumatic atrial fibrillation. The Boston Area Anticoagulation Trial for Atrial Fibrillation Investigators BACKGROUND. Nonrheumatic atrial fibrillation increases the risk of stroke, presumably from atrial thromboemboli. There is uncertainty about the efficacy and risks of long-term warfarin therapy to prevent stroke. METHODS. We conducted an unblinded, randomized, controlled trial of long-term, low-dose warfarin therapy (target prothrombin-time ratio, 1.2 to 1.5) in patients with nonrheumatic atrial fibrillation. The control group was not given warfarin but could choose to take aspirin. RESULTS. A total of 420 patients entered the trial (212 in the warfarin group and 208 in the control group) and were followed for an average of 2.2 years. Prothrombin times in the warfarin group were in the target range 83 percent of the time. Only 10 percent of the patients assigned to receive warfarin discontinued the drug permanently. There were 2 strokes in the warfarin group (incidence, 0.41 percent per year) as compared with 13 strokes in the control group (incidence, 2.98 percent per year), for a reduction of 86 percent in the risk of stroke (warfarin:control incidence ratio = 0.14; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.04 to 0.49; P = 0.0022). There were 37 deaths altogether. The death rate was markedly lower in the warfarin group than in the control group: 2.25 percent as compared with 5.97 percent per year, for an incidence ratio of 0.38 (95 percent confidence interval, 0.17 to 0.82; P = 0.005). There was one fatal hemorrhage in each group. The frequency of bleeding events that led to hospitalization or transfusion was essentially the same in both groups. The warfarin group had a higher rate of minor hemorrhage than the control group (38 vs. 21 patients). CONCLUSIONS. Long-term low-dose warfarin therapy is highly effective in preventing stroke in patients with non-rheumatic atrial fibrillation, and can be quite safe with careful monitoring. 
5	Episodic hyperammonemia in adult siblings with hyperornithinemia, hyperammonemia, and homocitrullinuria syndrome. A 39-year-old man and his 42-year-old sister, both vegetarians, had episodic confusion for many years, but their mental function was normal between those episodes. They were recently diagnosed with hyperornithinemia, hyperammonemia, and homocitrullinuria syndrome. Hyperammonemia was documented during an episode of confusion in the male sibling but not in his sister. Both had elevated plasma ornithine, glutamine, and alanine levels and persistently low plasma lysine levels. Homocitrulline was present in their urine, and orotic aciduria and orotidinuria developed in the male sibling following ingestion of allopurinol. Studies on their cultured skin fibroblasts showed deficient metabolism of ornithine, indicating a defect in ornithine transport across the mitochondrial membrane. During therapy with citrulline and phenylbutyrate sodium, plasma ornithine levels increased in both patients, while plasma levels of glutamine and alanine decreased to normal. Since therapy started, their clinical conditions have also improved, and no recurrent neurologic dysfunction has occurred during a follow-up period of 20 months. 
1	The epidemiology of cancer among Hispanic women. The experience in Florida. To explore cancer incidence among Hispanic women living in Dade County, Florida, data were analyzed from the statewide cancer registry. For all but three sites, Hispanics had lower rates of the 15 most prevalent cancers than non-Hispanics. However, higher rates of cancer among Hispanics were noted for cancers of the gallbladder, liver, and heart and soft tissue. Subgroups of women had significantly higher rates of cervical cancer and thyroid cancer. Lower rates among Hispanics were observed for cancers of the esophagus, vagina, breast, colon, buccal cavity and pharynx, and malignant melanoma. These data suggest that most cancer sites traditionally higher among US Latino women were not higher among Dade Hispanics, and that sites more common among non-Hispanics have not yet shown an increased incidence among Hispanic women in Dade County. 
1	Decreased mortality in users of estrogen replacement therapy In a prospective study of 8881 postmenopausal female residents of a retirement community in southern California, we evaluated in detail the relationship between estrogen use and overall mortality. After 7 1/2 years of follow-up, there had been 1447 deaths. Women with a history of estrogen use had 20% lower age-adjusted, all-cause mortality than lifetime nonusers (95% confidence interval, 0.70 to 0.87). Mortality decreased with increasing duration of use and was lower among current users than among women who used estrogens only in the distant past. Current users with more than 15 years of estrogen use had a 40% reduction in their overall mortality. Among oral estrogen users, relative risks of death could not be distinguished by specific dosages of the oral estrogen taken for the longest time. Women who had used estrogen replacement therapy had a reduced mortality from all categories of acute and chronic arteriosclerotic disease and cerebrovascular disease. This group of women had a reduced mortality from cancer, although this reduction was not statistically significant. The mortality from all remaining causes combined was the same in estrogen users and lifetime nonusers. 
5	Epidemiologic risk factors for children with acute lower respiratory tract infection in Buenos Aires, Argentina: a matched case-control study. The risk factors that predisposed 516 hospitalized and 154 ambulatory patients to acute lower respiratory tract infection (ALRI) are examined in a matched case-control study. The control group was selected from children attending immunization and well-baby clinics at the same institution that was treating the children with ALRI. Sex, age, nutritional status, socioeconomic level, as well as season and place of residence were used as matching criteria. Because of their distinct profiles, hospitalized and outpatient groups were analyzed separately. However, the four variables with the highest odds ratios (incidence ratios or relative risk) were found to be the same for both groups. These variables were related to the host's condition (bronchial hyperreactivity, presence of persistent symptoms of the upper respiratory tract), family (presence of acute respiratory tract disease in household members), and environment (indoor contaminants). 
3	Lateral deviation of the eyes on forced lid closure in patients with cerebral lesions. We examined 35 patients with unilateral cerebral lesions to determine the incidence of lateral deviation of the eyes under forcefully closed lids and the reliability of this sign in predicting the side of the lesion. Only patients with radiologically confirmed unilateral lesions were studied. Over 70% of patients had contralateral ocular deviation (Cogan's "spasticity of conjugate gaze"), 20% had ipsilateral deviation, and less than 9% of the patients had no deviation. Lateral ocular deviation was as sensitive, but not as specific, as a unilateral Babinski plantar response in determining the side with the lesion. Contralateral deviation was more common with parietotemporal localization, suggesting that the phenomenon reflects an underlying disturbance of attentional mechanisms. 
4	Humoral factors determining the blood pressure response to converting enzyme inhibition and calcium channel blockade. Renin and catecholamine levels were determined in patients with mild to moderate hypertension before and after treatment with sustained release diltiazem or captopril and were correlated with the blood pressure response to these antihypertensives. Eight weeks of treatment with either agent led to equal decreases in both systolic and diastolic blood pressure. Pretreatment plasma renin activity (PRA) and plasma norepinephrine did not predict the blood pressure response to either agent. Diltiazem significantly increased both PRA and supine norepinephrine levels. However, in the diltiazem treated patients, there was no correlation between the change in plasma norepinephrine and the change in systolic or diastolic blood pressure. In contrast, there was a negative correlation (P less than .05) between the reactive rise in PRA and the decrease in systolic blood pressure. Thus, the antihypertensive response to a calcium channel blocker may be determined, in part, by the reactive response of pressor systems. 
1	Changes in the relative frequency of gastric adenocarcinoma in southern California. The incidence of gastric cancer is decreasing in most counties of the developed world, but at the Los Angeles County-University of Southern California Medical Center, we diagnosed 99.8 cases of gastric adenocarcinoma per 10(5) discharges in the period 1982 to 1986 as opposed to 62.2 per 10(5) discharges in 1972 to 1976 (P less than .0001). This change involved primarily Hispanics younger than 30 years of age with 30 cases per 10(5) vs 4.2 cases per 10(5) (P less than .0001) and whites older than 30 years: 87 cases per 10(5) vs 54 cases per 10(5) (P less than .05) during 1982 to 1986 and 1972 to 1976, respectively. There was no change in the relative frequency rates of gastric adenocarcinoma among African Americans and Asians. Although these changes do not seem important enough to make the detection of gastric cancer a high-priority public health problem, they should alert physicians working in areas with high Hispanic populations of the relative possibility of the occurrence of gastric malignancy even in young patients. Also, we have found that gastric cancer is still prevalent in whites of low socioeconomic class. 
5	Medicinal leeches: once again at the forefront of medicine. Medical grade leeches have recently been used in the management of acute problems relative to venous congestion in patients with traumatic injuries and surgical problems. Specific cases, especially in the realm of reconstructive microsurgery, have demonstrated the effectiveness and application of leech therapy. Specific contraindications include arterial insufficiency from either anatomic or mechanical obstruction. We present five illustrative cases of successful therapeutic intervention. 
5	Behavioral management of psychogenic cough: alternative to the "bedsheet" and other aversive techniques. The treatment of persistent psychogenic cough, a potentially debilitating condition among pediatric patients, can pose diagnostic and treatment dilemmas. Its treatment by the use of a procedure called reinforced suggestion technique was described previously. The use of an alternative procedure relying upon parental and self-monitoring of coughing and either social or material rewards for decreasing rates of coughing is presented. 
5	Colonoscopy during an attack of severe ulcerative colitis is a safe procedure and of great value in clinical decision making. Thirty-four patients who had severe ulcerative colitis had a colonoscopic examination during the attack. The indications were resistance to therapy and/or differential diagnostic purposes. Total colonoscopy was performed in 25 cases and less extensive examination in nine. Biopsy was taken in 22 cases. No clinically significant complications occurred. The procedure helped us to postpone immediate surgical intervention in 19 cases. Fourteen of these patients have maintenance treatment and are still well after a follow-up median time of 5 yr (6 months to 10 yr). 
5	Intraoral-extramaxillary sinus approach for ligation of the maxillary artery: an anatomic study with clinical correlates. Surgical control of severe epistaxis is usually reserved for cases refractory to more conservative techniques. We present our experience with intraoral ligation of the maxillary artery as it courses through the buccal fat pad before it enters the pterygopalatine fossa and branches posterior to the maxilla. This technique has been found useful in the control of nasal hemorrhage as well as an adjunct to other surgical procedures, such as removal of benign and malignant neoplasms involving the maxilla and paranasal sinuses. This technique was used for ligation of the maxillary artery in 20 patients. The artery was readily identified in some cases, but required more extensive dissection in others; therefore, an anatomic study in 18 preserved and fresh cadaver specimens was undertaken to investigate the variability of the maxillary artery in the region of the buccal fat pad. There appeared to be significant variation in the distance from the buccal mucosal incision site, as well as variation in the relationship to the pterygoid muscles. This relationship to the pterygoids explains the occasional difficulty in locating the artery for ligation. This technique represents a reasonable alternative to the more traditional transantral approach to ligation of the maxillary artery, as long as the surgeon understands the anatomy of the region, its variations, and where the artery may be located if not immediately apparent. No major complications have been experienced. 
5	Excess purine degradation caused by an imbalance in the supply of adenosine triphosphate in patients with congestive heart failure. To evaluate purine degradation in patients with congestive heart failure concentrations of serum hypoxanthine, lactate, and noradrenaline were measured before and after submaximal treadmill exercise in 12 patients with chronic congestive heart failure and nine healthy volunteers. In four patients the concentration of hypoxanthine was significantly higher than in the controls or in the remaining eight patients with congestive heart failure. Venous lactate and noradrenaline in the four patients with high concentrations of hypoxanthine were also significantly higher than those in the eight patients with normal concentrations of hypoxanthine. Patients who responded normally were also more likely to have been treated with vasodilators and angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors. Exercise induced arrhythmias were more common in the patients with high concentrations of hypoxanthine. These results suggest that the excess purine degradation in patients with congestive heart failure might be the result of a "relative" disturbance in the supply of adenosine triphosphate caused by the shift of cellular metabolism from aerobic glycolysis to anaerobic glycolysis during submaximal exercise and that hypoxanthine (a substrate for xanthine oxidase and a source of free radicals) was increased after submaximal exercise in some patients with congestive heart failure. 
5	Maxillary sinus hypoplasia masquerading as chronic sinusitis. Maxillary sinus hypoplasia is a common condition that may be misdiagnosed as chronic sinusitis. Although hypoplasia can usually be seen on conventional sinus films, computed tomography may be necessary, as in the cases described by the authors in this article. 
1	The clinical pharmacology of etoposide. Etoposide, a semisynthetic derivative of podophyllotoxin, is increasingly used to treat cancer. Etoposide is a phase-specific, cytotoxic drug acting in the late S and early G2 phases of the cell cycle. It appears to cause breaks in DNA by either an interaction with DNA-topoisomerase II or the formation of free radicals. Most studies show a biexponential decay after the intravenous (IV) administration of etoposide. The peak plasma concentrations of drug and the area under the concentration versus time curve (AUC) are linearly related to the IV dose. Considerable interpatient variability of pharmacokinetic variables exists after IV etoposide. Various metabolites of etoposide have been identified, but their detection and quantitation are disputed. Approximately 30% to 70% of an etoposide dose is excreted. The bioavailability of oral etoposide is approximately 50%, but its absorption is not linear with increasing doses within the range in clinical use. Considerable interpatient and intrapatient variability exists in the pharmacokinetics of oral etoposide. There is no evidence of etoposide accumulation after multiple consecutive doses by either the IV or oral route. The exact roles of the liver and kidney in metabolism and excretion of etoposide are uncertain. Etoposide has been shown to be a highly schedule-dependent drug in clinical studies. This, together with the phase-specific action of etoposide and its increasingly widespread use in treating cancer, makes the clinical pharmacology of this drug of great clinical importance. 
1	Immunohistochemical demonstration of the placental form of glutathione S-transferase, a detoxifying enzyme in human gliomas. Expression of the human placental form of glutathion S-transferase (GST-pi) in human gliomas was investigated by immunohistochemical methods, and the result was compared with that of normal human glial cells. The gliomas in this study were composed of five benign astrocytomas (Grade 2), ten anaplastic astrocytomas (Grade 3), and 16 glioblastomas (Grade 4). Normal human glial cells showed only a weak immunostaining response for GST-pi in the cytoplasm or some nuclear membranes. All of benign astrocytomas had diffusely weak GST-pi immunostaining, resembling that of normal glial cells. With increasing grade, gliomas showed a strongly positive reaction for GST-pi. The positive reactions were remarkable especially in the gemistocytes and giant cells in the high-grade gliomas. These results suggest that cells of gliomas have some detoxifying function and the expression of this detoxifying enzyme, GST-pi, is related to the degree of malignancy of the gliomas. 
2	Effect of endotoxin and a burn injury on lung and liver lipid peroxidation and catalase activity. Both endotoxin and a burn alone produce oxidant-induced tissue lipid peroxidation. The endotoxin response is due in large part to hydrogen peroxide. The combination of endotoxin after a burn results in an increased liver, but not lung, oxidant injury. Our purpose was to determine whether the burn oxidant injury inactivated endogenous liver tissue catalase, thereby amplifying a subsequent H2O2 insult. Twenty-six adult sheep were studied. Twelve sheep had a 15% TBS burn. Tissue catalase activity, measured in lung and liver 3 days postburn, was significantly decreased from a control of 3.58 +/- 1.8 and 193 +/- 63, respectively, to 1.72 +/- 0.63 and 148 +/- 33 k(sec-1)/0.5 gram tissue. The addition of endotoxin 3 days postburn resulted in an increase in liver malondialdehyde, MDA, a measure of lipid peroxidation, from a control of 110 +/- 80 to 450 +/- 54 nmol/gram tissue. This value was significantly greater than the 210 +/- 80 nmol/gram tissue seen after endotoxin alone. Lung tissue MDA with burn and endotoxin was 65 +/- 8 compared to 42 +/- 7 for control and 80 +/- 6 nmol/gram for endotoxin alone. We conclude that a decrease in liver catalase activity occurs after a burn. The decrease corresponds to an accentuated oxidant-induced lipid peroxidation after an added endotoxin insult where H2O2 is known to be an etiologic agent. The catalase activity also decreases in postburn lung, but accentuated lung damage was not seen, indicating a variable tissue response from the burn-induced decrease in antioxidant activity. 
4	Usefulness of the electrophysiology laboratory for evaluation of proarrhythmic drug response in coronary artery disease. Two potential manifestations of proarrhythmic responses to type IA antiarrhythmic agents in the electrophysiology laboratory were evaluated in 122 patients with chronic coronary artery disease and previous myocardial infarction: (1) conversion of uniform nonsustained ventricular tachycardia (VT) into sustained VT after drug administration, and (2) induction of sustained VT by fewer extrastimuli after drug administration. Forty-two patients were evaluated for nonsustained VT. Eighty patients were evaluated for sustained VT: 30 of these had spontaneous sustained VT only while receiving empiric therapy with quinidine or procainamide, whereas the remaining 50 developed spontaneous VT in the absence of antiarrhythmic drugs. All patients underwent programmed stimulation in the baseline state and after procainamide. Four patients had conversion of induced uniform nonsustained VT into the same morphology, but sustained VT after procainamide administration. These responses only occurred in patients evaluated for nonsustained VT. Over 90% of patients presenting with sustained VT had uniform sustained VT induced at the baseline study and after procainamide, regardless of whether the spontaneous arrhythmia occurred only in the presence or absence of antiarrhythmic drugs. There was no significant difference in the change in mode of induction from baseline to procainamide study, regardless of whether patients had developed spontaneous VT only in the presence or absence of antiarrhythmic drugs. One patient with no inducible VT at the baseline study had inducible uniform sustained VT after procainamide administration, and 1 patient with inducible VT at baseline developed spontaneous sustained uniform VT after procainamide administration. Both patients had developed spontaneous sustained VT only while receiving therapy with type IA agents. 
2	Islet cell carcinoma of the pancreas presenting as bleeding from isolated gastric varices. Report of a case and review of the literature. Gastrointestinal hemorrhage from left-sided portal hypertension and gastric varices is an unusual presentation for islet cell carcinoma of the pancreas. Islet cell tumors of the pancreas themselves are rare. They present in a variety of ways. Those that elaborate functional hormones cause specific neuroendocrine syndromes. Nonfunctional tumors characteristically present later with symptoms of metastatic disease or as a result of local enlargement. We present a case of islet cell carcinoma of the pancreas presenting with recurrent gastrointestinal bleeding from gastric varices and review the literature for this rare presentation. We emphasize the importance of a careful initial diagnostic work-up that may enable curative surgery. 
1	Oral contraceptives and breast cancer. Review and meta-analysis. To evaluate the relation between use of oral contraceptives and the incidence of breast cancer, the authors reviewed the epidemiologic literature and used quantitative methods to summarize the data. Study results for any use of oral contraceptives were pooled using a model that accounted for both interstudy and intrastudy variability. The authors also explored interstudy variability and modeled a duration-effect relation between oral contraceptive use and breast cancer. Case-control and follow-up studies were considered separately. Overall, the authors observed no increase in the risk of breast cancer for women who had ever used oral contraceptives, even after a long duration of use. These results were consistent across study design. However, data combined from case-control studies revealed a statistically significant positive trend (P = 0.001) in the risk of premenopausal breast cancer for women exposed to oral contraceptives for longer duration. This risk was predominant among women who used oral contraceptives for at least 4 years before their first term pregnancy (relative risk = 1.72; 95% confidence interval = 1.36 to 2.19). Additional study is required to determine whether this finding in a subgroup of exposed women is confirmed and whether the risk remains increased with advancing age. 
1	Local recurrence and survival following nerve-sparing radical cystoprostatectomy. From March 1982 through July 1988, 76 men underwent nerve-sparing radical cystoprostatectomy for carcinoma of the bladder at our hospital. Of the 76 patients 2 (2.6%) had positive surgical margins (dome of the bladder and left ureter) and neither had positive margins at the site of nerve-sparing modifications. Of 3 patients (3.9%) who had local recurrence none had positive surgical margins. The 5-year actuarial local recurrence rate is 7.5%. Thirteen of 76 patients (17%) died of transitional cell carcinoma and 7 (9%) died of other causes, while 53 (70%) are alive without evidence of disease with a mean followup of 38.4 months. The 5-year actuarial survival rates are 64% over-all, 68% without disease and 78% disease-specific. Of the 42 evaluable men who underwent cystoprostatectomy alone 27 (64%) are potent, compared to 2 of the 12 men (17%) who also underwent urethrectomy. We conclude that the nerve-sparing modifications do not compromise cancer control, that local recurrence and survival rates are at least comparable to those achieved with standard radical cystoprostatectomy, and that it is possible to preserve potency in most men undergoing this procedure. 
3	Osseointegration of titanium implants in total hip arthroplasty. Osseointegration is defined as direct contact on the light microscopic level between living bone tissue and the implant. Using titanium screw dental implants in the jaw, a lasting interface under loaded conditions extending over a 20-year follow-up period has been demonstrated. This demonstration brings up the question whether a similar interface can be achieved in total hip arthroplasty (THA) between living bone and a titanium alloy implant under necessitated conditions of immediate loading. Two series of cases are reported. The first series used a femoral, press-fit, titanium alloy component and the second used a press-fit titanium acetabular component and redesigned femoral, press-fit, titanium alloy component. Both demonstrated a high percentage of good to excellent results. Roentgenograms showed that the geometrical changes in the redesigned femoral component gave early indications of a better fixation with loading in valgus, less subsidence, and less evidence of distal stress transfer. A two-and-one-half-year postoperative anatomic specimen study confirmed osseointegration to the press-fit titanium alloy femoral component. Multiple areas of contact between bone and metal without fibrous interposition were seen. Examination by electron microscopy supported the light microscopic findings. These findings support further use of smooth, press-fit titanium components in THAs without the need for porous coating, mesh, or other surface modifications. 
1	Inhibition of tumor growth in a glioma model treated with boron neutron capture therapy. This investigation attempts to determine whether increased survival time seen when the F98 glioma model is treated with boron neutron capture therapy (BNCT) is a result of inhibition of tumor growth caused by radiation-induced alterations in endothelial cells and normal tissue components. This indirect effect of radiation has been called the tumor bed effect. A series of tumor-bearing rats was studied, using a standardized investigational BNCT protocol consisting of 50 mg/kg of Na2B12H11SH injected intravenously 14 to 17 hours before neutron irradiation at 4 x 10(12) n/cm2. Ten rats, serving as controls, received no treatment either before or after tumor implantation. A second group of 10 rats was treated with BNCT 4 days before tumor implantation; these animals received no further treatment. The remaining group of 10 rats received no pretreatment but was treated with BNCT 10 days after implantation. Histological and ultrastructural analyses were performed in 2 animals from each group 17 days after implantation. Survival times of the untreated control animals (mean, 25.8 days) did not differ statistically from the survival times of the rats in the pretreated group (mean, 25.5 days). The rats treated with BNCT after implantation survived significantly longer (P less than 0.02; mean, 33.2 days) than the controls and the preirradiated animals. Tumor size indices calculated from measurements taken at the time of death were similar in all groups. These results indicate that, with this tumor model, BNCT does not cause a tumor bed effect in cerebral tissue. The therapeutic gains observed with BNCT result from direct effects on tumor cells or on the peritumoral neovascularity. 
1	Pulmonary metastases and bone sarcomas. Surgical removal of lesions appearing after adjuvant chemotherapy. Pulmonary metastasis is the leading cause of death in pediatric patients with bone tumors. Multiple thoracotomies for surgical removal of individual lesions are performed at many centers. To explore the efficacy of this procedure and establish guidelines for an appropriate choice of patients, the experience with 43 thoracotomies in 24 children was reviewed. The appearance of first metastasis later than one year after diagnosis, presence of fewer than five nodules, and completeness of surgical resection were favorable predictors of postthoractomy survival. Early or multiple metastases, unresectable disease, and hilar, nodal, or pleural lesions conferred an unfavorable prognosis. With careful patient selection, pulmonary metastecotomy is a safe procedure that has few operative or long-term complications. It must be emphasized that although surgical removal of pulmonary metastases prolongs survival with good quality of life, the majority of patients with bone sarcomas ultimately succumb to their disease after thoracotomy. Follow-up time of greater than eight years is necessary to adequately assess the effectiveness of pulmonary resection in eradicating all disease in these patients. 
3	Long-term effects of nimodipine on cerebral infarcts and outcome after aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage and surgery. A total of 213 patients with verified aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) of Grades I to III (Hunt and Hess classification) were enrolled in a double-blind placebo-controlled trial to determine the effect of intravenous nimodipine on delayed ischemic deterioration and computerized tomography (CT)-visualized infarcts after SAH and surgery. The administration of the drug or matching placebo was started immediately after the radiological diagnosis of a ruptured aneurysm had been made. Of the 213 patients enrolled in the study, 58 were operated on early (within 72 hours after the bleed: Days 0 to 3), 69 were operated on subacutely (between Days 4 and 7), and 74 had late surgery (on Day 8 or later). Eleven patients died before surgery was undertaken and one was not operated on. A follow-up examination with CT scanning, performed 1 to 3 years after the SAH (mean 1.4 years), revealed no significant differences in the overall outcome between the groups. However, nimodipine treatment was associated with a significantly lower incidence of deaths caused by delayed cerebral ischemia (p = 0.01) and significantly lower occurrence of cerebral infarcts visualized by CT scanning in the whole population (p = 0.05), especially in patients without an associated intracerebral hemorrhage on admission CT scan (p = 0.03). 
4	Sclerotherapy of varicose and telangiectatic leg veins. Minimal sclerosant concentration of hypertonic saline and its relationship to vessel diameter The author reports the results of a double-blind, paired-comparison study using saline sclerosant plus or minus heparin additive. The study was designed to elucidate the effects of increasing concentrations of hypertonic saline with regard to vessel diameter, clinical efficacy, complications, and discomfort. Six hundred women with bilaterally symmetrical starburst telangiectasias or varicose veins were entered into the study. Sodium chloride 11.7% appeared to be the minimal sclerosant concentration of saline that produced the most effective vein sclerosis of vessels of less than 8 mm in diameter, while producing the least morbidity. The optimal concentration of the sclerosant may vary with the diameter of the vessels under therapeutic consideration. 
5	Selective breeding of dogs for segregation of limb edema from microfilaremia as clinical manifestations of Brugia infections. Three generations of beagles were monitored for microfilaremia (mf) and clinical disease during repeated infection with Brugia pahangi and were selectively bred for offspring manifesting limb edema and low or amicrofilaremia. A high microfilaremic female mated to a high microfilaremic male produced 7 pups, 6 of which maintained mf greater than 1,000/ml for greater than 2 years after 5 monthly infections of 10 infective larvae each. An uninfected female mated to another high mf male produced 5 pups, 4 of which did not exceed 1,000 mf/ml 7 months after initiation of the repeating infection regimen; 1 of these remained amicrofilaremic after 2 additional challenges. Neither the parents nor the offspring from these matings manifested chronic limb edema. Two matings were conducted with offspring from the microfilaremic female by breeding siblings with the lowest mf and breeding siblings with the highest mf. The high mf siblings produced 4/5 offspring manifesting chronic limb edema (greater than or equal to 7 months duration) and either no mf (in 2 dogs) or less than 100 mf/ml after the repeating infection regimen. The lower mf siblings produced 5 offspring, all with greater than 1,000 mf/ml 6 months after the initiation of the repeating infection regimen; none manifested edema. Comparisons of IgG antibody levels, specific for extracts of adult worms, showed no consistent differences between these 2 litters of dogs that could be associated with limb edema or mf when monitored for 16 months; however, the onset of lymph node enlargement was much earlier in the group of dogs manifesting limb edema than in the other litter. 
5	The influence of hyperglycemia and diabetes mellitus on immediate and 3-month morbidity and mortality after acute stroke. Fasting serum glucose, glycosylated hemoglobin, and fructosamine concentrations were determined in 304 consecutive subjects admitted with acute stroke, within 48 hours of ictus. Based on the medical history and these results, subjects were divided into known diabetics, newly diagnosed diabetics, subjects with stress hyperglycemia, and nondiabetics. The type of stroke was classified as lacunar infarct, cerebral infarct, or intracerebral hemorrhage, based on clinical examination by a neurologist and computed tomographic brain scan and/or autopsy. Immediate and 3-month outcomes were examined in relation to (1) fasting glucose, glycosylated hemoglobin, and fructosamine levels by stroke subtypes, and (2) glucose tolerance categories by stroke subtypes. A high fasting glucose level was associated with an increased mortality, but this was observed only among patients with intracerebral hemorrhage. Patients with stress hyperglycemia, but not diabetics, had increased mortality. In spite of having similar glucose concentrations to those patients with stress hyperglycemia, diabetics did not have a worse outcome compared with nondiabetics. It is concluded that the association between glucose concentration and outcome is a reflection of stress relating to stroke severity, rather than a direct harmful effect of glucose on damaged neurons. 
3	Stiffman syndrome: a rare paraneoplastic disorder? An unusual case of the stiffman syndrome, associated with an oat cell carcinoma of the bronchus, is reported. Pathological examination showed that it was due to an encephalomyelitis similar to that seen in paraneoplastic disorders. This suggests that atypical cases of the stiffman syndrome may occasionally be paraneoplastic. 
1	Characterization and significance of sulfonylurea receptors. This study describes and characterizes a putative sulfonylurea receptor. The radioligand used was [3H]glipizide (9 Ci/mmol). The beta-cell plasma membranes were derived from a transplantable rat insulinoma generated by subcutaneous injection of RINm5F cells and purified by ultracentrifugation on a 15-55% sucrose gradient. Specific binding of [3H]glipizide to purified beta-cell plasma membranes was determined to be maximal at temperatures of 4-23 degrees C, pH 7.3, and an incubation of 2 h. Scatchard analysis indicated a single binding site with Kd = 7 nM and sulfonylurea binding of 0.93 pmol/mg membrane protein. Displacement of [3H]glipizide from the purified beta-cell plasma membranes by various sulfonylureas and their analogues correlated well with their known hypoglycemic and insulin-releasing activities. Various agents, including nutrients, agents affecting Ca2+ flux, gastrointestinal hormones, and pancreatic hormones, had no effect on [3H]glipizide binding to the beta-cell plasma membranes. Putative sulfonylurea receptors on beta-cell and brain cell plasma membranes have been reported by several groups of investigators. Sulfonylurea binding to the beta-cell is hypothesized to close an ATP-sensitive K+ channel, which leads to depolarization of the membrane and activation of a voltage-dependent Ca2+ channel. 
2	Corticosteroid treatment reduces mast cell numbers in inflammatory bowel disease. Mast cell degranulation in the gut causes mucus secretion, mucosal edema, and increased gut permeability and may be responsible for some of the symptoms and signs of inflammatory bowel disease. We have used a novel monoclonal antibody (AAI) against tryptase expressed exclusively in the granules of mast cells to enumerate mast cells in rectal biopsies in order to study the effect of inflammatory bowel disease and drug treatment upon rectal mast cell numbers. Rectal mast cell numbers are significantly reduced in inflammatory bowel disease patients taking corticosteroids (mean 4.95 cells/mm2) when compared with control patients (10.1, P less than 0.001) and inflammatory bowel disease patients not taking corticosteroids (9.7, P less than 0.001 Wilcoxon rank sum test). The reduction in mast cell counts was independent of the degree of inflammation or architectural distortion. There was a negative correlation between the dose of corticosteroids and mast cell count (r = 0.53, P less than 0.05 Spearman rank correlation), and the mast cell count was reduced within a few days of treatment and remained low throughout steroid therapy. Mucosal mast cell depletion may be an important mechanism of action of corticosteroids in inflammatory bowel disease. 
1	Angiotropic B-cell lymphoma (malignant angioendotheliomatosis): failure of systemic chemotherapy. A 65-year-old female with angiotropic B-cell lymphoma is reported. Despite the absence of systemic involvement on formal staging and the favourable response of the cutaneous lesions to triple systemic chemotherapy with prednisolone, vincristine and cyclophosphamide, postmortem findings showed that death was due to widespread disease dissemination. 
3	Transcranial stab wounds: morbidity and medicolegal awareness. In this series of eight patients with transcranial stab wounds, the importance of classifications of such wounds as a separate traumatic entity is stressed. The mechanisms of neuronal and vascular damage in these wounds are discussed and are found to be specific from other head injuries. Cerebral injury by stabbing is largely restricted to the wound tract. Frontal stabs (two cases) are accompanied by the least morbidity and mortality, while temporal stabs (four cases) are more commonly fatal. In transorbital stabs (two cases) carotid-cavernous fistulae resulted. Early recognition, administration of antitetanus serum and antibiotics, and debridement may minimize complications. 
5	Reversed lateralization of cognitive functions in right handers. Exceptions to classical aphasiology. Most current and past research on the cerebral organization of cognitive functions has presupposed certain specialized hemisphere operations. At least for right handers, language and praxis are to be organized in the left hemisphere, while affective prosody, configurational spatial capacity, and global attention are lateralized in the right hemisphere. Deviations from these presuppositions, as in crossed aphasics and perhaps left handers, are generally considered to be 'exceptions' and either to disprove the rules or to be irrelevant to the rule. We report 4 very 'exceptional' cases, right handers with almost entirely reversed lateralization of functions. Analysis of the intrahemispheric relationships between functions suggests that there may be a specific neurobiology to the interrelationships between and among cognitive functions, handedness, and the intrahemisphere localization of the function. 
3	Development and reversal of contingent inefficacy and tolerance to the anticonvulsant effects of carbamazepine. The relationship of the timing of drug administration to anticonvulsant efficacy against amygdala kindled seizures was studied. During kindling development, rats received carbamazepine (CBZ, 15mg/kg) before (CBZ-before) or after each amygdala stimulation (CBZ-after). After kindling to full seizures, when all animals were given CBZ before the stimulation, only the CBZ-after group showed a good anticonvulsant response. The rats that had received CBZ before (during development of kindled seizures) remained unresponsive to CBZ treatment (contingent inefficacy). When drug-naive or CBZ-after animals repeatedly received CBZ before electrical stimulation, they developed tolerance to its anticonvulsant effects (contingent tolerance). The tolerance could be reversed by a period of treatment with CBZ-after or by kindling the animal drug-free, but not by CBZ administration alone or by time off from both drug and seizures. These findings suggest that inefficacy and tolerance to CBZ may be affected by the temporal contingencies of drug administration and that responsiveness can be reinstated by altering these contingencies. 
5	Cystic fibrosis mutations in North American populations of French ancestry: analysis of Quebec French-Canadian and Louisiana Acadian families. A 3-bp deletion (delta F508) in the cystic fibrosis (CF) gene is the mutation on the majority of CF chromosomes. We studied 112 CF families from North American populations of French ancestry: French-Canadian families referred from hospitals in three cities in Quebec and from the Saguenay-Lac St. Jean region of northeastern Quebec and Acadian families living in Louisiana. delta F508 was present on 71%, 55%, and 70% of the CF chromosomes from the major-urban Quebec, Saguenay-Lac St. Jean, and Louisiana Acadian families, respectively. A weighted estimate of the proportion of delta F508 in the French-Canadian patient population of Quebec was 70%. We found that 95% of the CF chromosomes with delta F508 had D7S23 haplotype B, the most frequent haplotype on CF chromosomes. In the Saguenay-Lac St. Jean families, 86% of the CF chromosomes without delta F508 had the B haplotype, compared with 31% for the major-urban Quebec and Louisiana Acadian families. The incidence of CF in the Saguenay-Lac St. Jean population was 1/895 live-born infants. 
5	Estimation of myocardial ischemic injury during ventricular fibrillation with total circulatory arrest using high-energy phosphates and lactate as metabolic markers. STUDY OBJECTIVE: To define the time course of myocardial ischemic injury using high-energy phosphate (HEP) depletion and the cessation of lactate production as metabolic markers. SETTING: Data were collected in a laboratory animal model. TYPE OF PARTICIPANTS: Ten immature mixed breed swine weighing 23.2 +/- 3.5 kg. DESIGN: After thoracotomy, transmural myocardial biopsies were taken in vivo during normal sinus rhythm and at designated times during ventricular fibrillation with total circulatory arrest (VF-TCA). MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Frozen tissue samples were analyzed for adenine nucleotides, by high-performance liquid chromatography, and lactate by enzymatic assay. At five minutes of VF-TCA, myocardial adenosine triphosphate averaged 50% of control. At 15 minutes of VF-TCA, 89% of animals had myocardial adenosine triphosphate levels above 20% of control and adenylate charge ratio above 0.60. With more than 30 minutes of VF-TCA, all animals had adenosine triphosphate levels below 10% of control and adenylate charge ratio below 0.30. In addition, myocardial lactate levels plateaued after 30 minutes of VF-TCA, indicating the cessation of lactate production. CONCLUSION: These results suggest that the myocardium can tolerate VF-TCA for as long as 15 minutes without irreversible injury; however, post-ischemic myocardial dysfunction may occur after as little as five minutes of VF-TCA. With more than 30 minutes of VF-TCA, myocardial injury is likely to be irreversible. 
5	Changes in gastric mucosa that antedate gastric carcinoma. Endoscopic biopsy specimens of the gastric mucosa from 13 patients who were found at follow-up examination to have gastric carcinoma were compared for abnormal histologic features, type of intestinal metaplasia, and presence of immunoreactive carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA), with specimens from 40 tumor-free controls. Villus-like changes and angular infolding, cytologic nuclear pleomorphism, distinct nuclear border, irregular thickness of the nuclear membrane, irregular chromatin clumping, prominent nucleoli, and distinct nucleoli were manifestations of the carcinoma group. Angular infolding, distinct nuclear border, irregular thickness of the nuclear membrane, and distinct nucleoli were also observed in the latent stage before detection of carcinoma. The individual features, however, lacked specificity. Histochemically, a IIB subtype of intestinal metaplasia, and immunoreactive CEA in the cytoplasm of foveolar epithelium appeared exclusively in the patients with carcinoma. These findings indicate that the gastric epithelium of patients with gastric carcinoma tends to be morphologically and histochemically abnormal even before the recognition of classical dysplasia. This can be described as abnormal epithelium and is believed to provide the soil on which gastric carcinoma develops. 
4	Follow-up of patients with low output, low gradient hemodynamics after percutaneous balloon aortic valvuloplasty: the Mansfield Scientific Aortic Valvuloplasty Registry. Symptomatic patients with a low cardiac output and low aortic valve gradient have a poor prognosis but are at high risk for aortic valve surgery. The outcome of percutaneous balloon aortic valvuloplasty in this subgroup of patients is unclear. Therefore, 67 patients (group 1) underwent percutaneous balloon aortic valvuloplasty between December 1, 1986 and November 1, 1987 who had a low cardiac index (less than 2.5 liters/min per m2) and a low aortic valve gradient (less than or equal to 40 mm Hg) before the procedure. The results were compared with 200 patients (group 2) who had a low cardiac index but not a low aortic valve gradient (greater than 40 mm Hg) before the procedure and who had similar baseline presenting symptoms. After balloon aortic valvuloplasty, there was a greater decrease in aortic valve gradient in patients in group 2 than in patients in group 1 (mean +/- SD -33.0 +/- 16.7 mm Hg and -14.6 +/- 6.9 mm Hg, respectively; p less than 0.001) although there was no significant difference in improvement in estimated aortic valve area (0.31 +/- 0.21 and 0.31 +/- 0.22 cm2, respectively; p = NS). In-hospital mortality was 11.9% for patients in group 1 which was not significantly different from the 7.5% mortality for patients in group 2. However, the actuarial probability of survival at 12 months for patients who survived the initial hospitalization was 46% in group 1 and 64% in group 2 (p less than 0.05). Moreover, at follow-up (mean 8.8 months) 64% of surviving group 1 patients displayed clinical improvement, compared with 70% of surviving group 2 patients. 
4	Long-term minoxidil treatment in refractory hypertension and renal failure. Twenty-two patients with severe or accelerated hypertension refractory to conventional hypotensive therapy have been treated with minoxidil for an extended period. Patients were divided in three groups according to different degrees of renal function or the presence of accelerated hypertension. In the first group (8 patients with normal or slightly decreased renal function) BP fell from 197 +/- 11/118 +/- 3 before minoxidil therapy to 157 +/- 7/98 +/- 2 after six months (p less than 0.001), and remained steady during the following eighteen months. In the second group (9 patients with creatinine clearance of 30 +/- 3 ml/min.1.73 m2) BP decreased from 192 +/- 9/119 +/- 4 to 147 +/- 6/91 +/- 4 at six months (p less than 0.001); renal function did not show any significant modification during the eighteen months of the study. In the third group (5 patients with accelerated hypertension) BP fell from 243 +/- 14/137 +/- 6 to 166 +/- 13/99 +/- 7 at six months (p less than 0.01). Seven patients, four in the first and three in the second group, were followed for more than six years; these patients, with mild renal insufficiency (creatinine clearance 50 +/- 4 ml/min) before minoxidil therapy, were on a protein unrestricted diet for the entire length of the study. In this group of patients BP fell from 182 +/- 9/115 +/- 3 to 150 +/- 6/96 +/- 2 after one year (p less than 0.01) and remained well controlled for the following six years or more. Renal function did not show any significant worsening over the years (monthly decrement in creatinine clearance 0.08 ml/min). 
5	A critical review of chemical lymph node clearance and staging of colon and rectal cancer at Ferguson Hospital, 1977 to 1982 A unique opportunity to evaluate the method of chemical lymph node clearance for colorectal cancer exists at Ferguson Hospital. Lymph node clearance has been used at the institution since 1977, and this retrospective analysis was undertaken to ascertain its validity there. Furthermore, the node positive group was evaluated to ascertain if the current staging system (Turnbull, 1967) is prognostically accurate for the Dukes' C group. Specifically evaluated for possible prognostic variance was the survival of those patients whose tumors demonstrated partial bowel wall penetration and only one to four positive nodes, a "C1 subset," previously reported to have favorable prognosis. Eight hundred sixty-four cases of colon and rectal cancer treated surgically from 1977 to 1982 were analyzed. There was a mean of 27 lymph nodes retrieved per specimen and a mean of 4.5 positive nodes per Dukes' C specimen. There were 43 C1 and 201 C2 cases with five-year survival rates of 73 and 38 percent, respectively. The results of chemical clearance at Ferguson Hospital were found to be comparable with that of other centers using chemical clearance and superior to hand dissection. The C1 subset clearly is noted to have prognostic advantage and should occupy a separate designation in any staging system. 
2	The starved colon--diminished mucosal nutrition, diminished absorption, and colitis. Nutrition of colonic epithelial cells is mainly from short chain fatty acids (SCFAs) produced by bacterial fermentation in the colonic lumen. n-Butyrate contributes more carbon of oxidation to epithelial cells than glucose or glutamine from the vasculature. Incomplete starvation of colonic epithelial cells through lack of luminal SCFAs leads, in the short term, to mucosal hypoplasia with either diminished absorption or diarrhea. A chronic lack of SCFAs or complete organ starvation in conjunction with other factors leads to nutritional colitis, either "diversion colitis" or "starvation colitis." Whether predominantly diarrhea or colitis develops in mucosal malnutrition appears to depend upon the severity and duration of starvation. Ulcerative colitis may be classified as a nutritional colitis in that colonic epithelial cells are unable to utilize SCFAs reflecting epithelial starvation despite abundant SCFAs. 
1	Preventing cervical cancer by treating genital warts in men. Why male sex partners need androscopy. The increased incidence of cancer of the genitourinary and anorectal areas has been directly related to the coexistence of genital human papillomavirus infection. The diagnosis and treatment of condyloma acuminatum in men is important not only to prevent cancer but also to decrease the reservoir of virus that is being transferred to women. Screening with androscopy (examination of male genitals with a colposcope after a vinegar solution has been applied to the skin) is indicated for all men who are at risk for this infection. Treatment options include chemical application, cryosurgery, laser therapy, and interferon injections. To be effective, treatment must include both sexual partners. 
5	Practical aspects of pulsatile gonadotropin-releasing hormone administration. Pulsatile administration of gonadotropin-releasing hormone represents a major advance in the treatment of anovulation in women who fail to ovulate with clomiphene citrate and is an alternative for many women who currently receive human menopausal gonadotropin. Four issues must be addressed before administering pulsatile gonadotropin-releasing hormone: (1) safety, (2) efficacy, (3) convenience, and (4) cost. Each of these issues will be affected by the three major decisions a physician makes with gonadotropin-releasing hormone therapy: (1) patient selection, (2) route of administration, and (3) dose of gonadotropin-releasing hormone. The ideal candidate for gonadotropin-releasing hormone therapy is a patient with an absence of endogenous pulsatile gonadotropin-releasing hormone, as seen in hypothalamic amenorrhea. Although women with polycystic ovarian disease can be treated with pulsatile gonadotropin-releasing hormone, a decreased ovulation rate should be expected. The route of administration, intravenous or subcutaneous, and the degree of monitoring can be tailored by the physician to fit each patient's needs. Pulsatile gonadotropin-releasing hormone therapy is a safe, effective, convenient, and economical alternative to human menopausal gonadotropin for ovulation induction in women resistant to clomiphene. 
5	High-risk metastatic gestational trophoblastic disease. A new dose-intensive, multiagent chemotherapeutic regimen. Dose-intensive, multiagent chemotherapy for the treatment of high-risk gestational trophoblastic disease has evolved as the treatment of choice for these patients. High-dose methotrexate in combination with etoposide, dactinomycin, vincristine and cyclophosphamide (EMA-CO) has now been demonstrated to be superior to the traditional methotrexate, dactinomycin, cyclophosphamide chemotherapy in patients with prognostic scores of greater than or equal to 8. An attempt was made to improve upon the EMA-CO regimen by increasing the dose intensity of etoposide and adding cisplatin to the high-dose methotrexate, etoposide and dactinomycin. That regimen was used on four patients with ultra-high-risk gestational trophoblastic disease. 
1	The internal oblique-iliac crest free flap in composite defects of the oral cavity involving bone, skin, and mucosa. The reconstruction of oromandibular defects following ablative surgery is a challenging undertaking. When the defect involves skin as well as mucosa, the challenge becomes even greater. The internal oblique iliac crest osteomyocutaneous free flap is particularly useful for reconstruction of through-and-through composite defects due to the inclusion of two separate soft-tissue flaps on the same vascular pedicle. We report our experience with this flap in the reconstruction of 10 patients with such defects. The utility, and the limitations of this form of reconstruction are discussed in detail. 
5	Extradural implantation of sacral anterior root stimulators. A technique for extradural deafferentation of the S2 to S5 segments and extradural implantation of stimulating electrodes is described, and its application to twelve patients with spinal cord lesions is reported. Nine patients use their implants for micturition, and seven are fully continent. The advantages and disadvantages of this technique compared with the more usual intrathecal procedure are discussed. 
1	The papillary-cystic neoplasm of the pancreas. An increasingly recognized clinicopathologic entity. The clinical course of the papillary-cystic neoplasm of the pancreas is contrasted with that of the pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma. The former occurs predominantly in young women, has a low malignant potential, and is highly curable with surgical treatment. Three cases are reported that illustrate the typical clinical features and the indolent nature of the tumor. One case was discovered after blunt abdominal trauma resulted in rupture of the tumor and hemoperitoneum. All cases were treated by pancreatic resection with preservation of the spleen, an important consideration in younger patients. All patients were free of disease at long-term follow-up. Increasing awareness of this tumor has resulted in the reclassification of several tumors and should lead to better recognition by surgeons caring for patients with pancreatic diseases. 
3	Stroke rehabilitation: Australian patient profile and functional outcome. A prospective, multi-institutional, population based study identified 1274 non-surgical stroke admissions to all hospitals in a major Australian city during 1984. The demographic and diagnostic profile and the nature of functional recovery of all 258 first stroke survivors who were referred for inpatient rehabilitation are presented. The median duration of rehabilitation stay was 49 days. The mean functional independence score, as measured on a modified Barthel Index at admission was 44, compared with 78 on discharge, a mean improvement of 34. Stair climbing had the lowest mean value on admission (12), while bowel control had the lowest residual deficit on discharge (95). The stroke study group was representative of the unimpaired aged population in all respects except ethnicity, where differences are attributed to age. The variables identified as significant are; side and severity of paralysis, age and sex, marital status and ethnicity. Stroke rehabilitation outcome was not influenced by etiology, site of lesion, arterial distribution, occupation or education. 
4	Reversal of cardiac dysfunction secondary to type 1 primary hyperoxaluria after combined liver-kidney transplantation. A 23-year-old man with type 1 primary hyperoxaluria, renal failure, and oxalosis developed a severe cardiomyopathy while awaiting combined liver-kidney transplantation. This manifested as radiographic cardiomegaly, a dilated hypokinetic left ventricle with a decreased ejection fraction, ventricular arrhythmias, and cardiac uptake on bone scanning. On liver and kidney transplantation, these abnormalities markedly improved and/or reversed. The cardiac size almost normalized, the left ventricular ejection fraction increased from 20% to 34%, the ventricular arrhythmias resolved, and the cardiac uptake on bone scanning disappeared. This coincided with normalization of oxalate production and excretion. Severe cardiac involvement secondary to oxalosis in patients with primary hyperoxaluria may improve or reverse with combined liver-kidney transplantation. 
5	Surgical outcome in 435 patients who sustained missile head wounds during the Iran-Iraq War. Variables important in predicting the final postsurgical outcome of 435 patients who sustained missile head wounds during the Iran-Iraq War were evaluated over a 99-month period. The type of projectile, site of injury, and presence or absence of foreign material did not seem to have a significant effect on the final outcome. Of the patients with a perforating type of injury, 48.8% had a poor surgical outcome as compared with 19.9% with a penetrating type and 15.6% with a tangential type. This difference is statistically significant (chi 2 = 14.7 and 17.1, respectively; p less than 0.001). The most important factor in predicting overall outcome was the Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score at the time of admission. Mortality and morbidity contributing to a poor surgical outcome were noted in only 6% of patients with a GCS score at admission of 13 to 15, in 24.6% of those with a GCS score of 9 to 12, in 57% of those with a GCS score of 6 to 8, and in 65% of those with a GCS score of 3 to 5. Of the 71 patients who died, 75% had a score of 3 to 8. Perforating projectiles or those traversing two or more dural compartments were statistically significant in contributing to mortality and morbidity (chi 2 = 17.2; p less than 0.001). The incidence of focal neurological deficit was 100, 90.6, 88, and 52.2% in patients with GCS scores of 3 to 5, 6 to 8, 9 to 12, and 13 to 15, respectively. The two best predictors of mortality in this group of patients were a low GCS score and infection. 
1	Preoperative chemotherapy (cisplatin and fluorouracil) and radiation therapy in stage III non-small-cell lung cancer: a phase II study of the Lung Cancer Study Group. The Lung Cancer Study Group conducted a phase II pilot study of concurrent chemotherapy and radiation therapy (chemoradiotherapy) before surgery in 85 eligible patients with non-small-cell cancer limited to the chest but in whom attempted resection would have been likely to leave residual disease (advanced stage IIIA and minimal stage IIIB disease). Cisplatin, 75 mg/m2, was given on days 1 and 29; fluorouracil, 1 g/m2 per 24 hours, was administered as a continuous infusion on days 1 through 4 and on days 29 through 32; and thoracic radiation, 30 Gy in 15 fractions, was administered on days 1 through 19. Two patients achieved a complete response and 46 patients had a partial response for an overall response rate of 56%. Toxicity from chemoradiotherapy was moderate but acceptable. Eight weeks after therapy was initiated, 54 patients underwent thoracotomy and tumor resection was attempted: 29 (34%) had complete resection and 15 (18%) had incomplete resection. Although surgical dissection was generally more difficult than in patients not pretreated with chemoradiotherapy, there was no apparent increase in postoperative complications. In 8 patients (9%), no viable tumor was detected pathologically in the resection specimen. Of the 18 patients whose tumors were completely resected and had disease recurrence, none had recurrence only in the chest, 12 (67%) had recurrence only in distant sites, and 3 developed second primary tumors. Median survival of all patients was 13 months. The overall results do not indicate a major benefit from this preoperative chemoradiotherapy regimen in patients with advanced but potentially resectable non-small-cell lung cancer. These results suggest a need to define better the relative roles of preoperative radiotherapy and chemotherapy. 
4	Genetic data and natural history of Friedreich's disease: a study of 80 Italian patients. The clinical and genetic features of 80 patients with Friedreich's disease from 64 families are described. Diagnostic criteria were: no evidence of dominant inheritance, onset by the age of 20 years, progressive unremitting ataxia of limbs and gait, and absence of knee and ankle jerks. Furthermore, at least one of the following accessory signs was present: dysarthria, extensor plantar response and echocardiographic evidence of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. Two peaks of onset age were evident at 6-9 and 12-15 years. Analysis of intra-family variation of onset age and absence of clustering of cardiomyopathy and diabetes did not suggest genetic heterogeneity. Peripheral nerve impairment was an early finding and showed slight further progression, whereas involvement of the cerebellar and corticospinal pathways appeared later and mainly accounted for the progressive worsening of the disease. 
4	Push-enteroscopy for diagnosis of patients with gastrointestinal bleeding of obscure origin. Push-enteroscopy using a disinfected colonoscope was performed on 39 patients with gastrointestinal bleeding of obscure origin. Our results show that: (1) A high percentage of patients (38%) have pathological lesions responsible for bleeding located in the distal duodenum and proximal jejunum, which are readily detected by push-enteroscopy. (2) Duodeno-jejunal arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) are the most common cause for bleeding, and these lesions can be conveniently cauterized through the endoscope. (3) An efficient sequence of steps for diagnosis of patients with this problem includes push-enteroscopy when the initial EGD and colonoscopy are normal followed by small bowel radiography. Mesenteric angiography and intraoperative enteroscopy can be reserved for patients with severe bleeding when push-enteroscopy and small bowel radiography are negative. We conclude that push-enteroscopy has an important role to play in the early assessment of patients with gastrointestinal bleeding of obscure origin. 
1	Epididymal metastasis from prostatic adenocarcinoma mimicking adenomatoid tumor. A case of epididymal metastasis from prostatic carcinoma is presented. The initial histologic findings were suggestive of adenomatoid tumor, but a diagnosis of metastatic adenocarcinoma of prostatic origin has been established by prostatic acid phosphatase and prostate-specific antigen immunoperoxidase staining. 
2	Sexually transmitted causes of gastrointestinal symptoms in homosexual men. The possible etiologic agents that may cause gastrointestinal complaints in homosexually active men are multiple, and their diagnosis is complex. This article presents a logical approach to the work-up and diagnosis of gastrointestinal complaints in homosexually active men and to discuss their treatment and disease intervention. 
3	Cerebrospinal fluid rhinorrhea following acoustic neurinoma surgery. Technical note. The authors describe a method of preventing cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) rhinorrhea following surgery for acoustic neurinoma. Mastoid air cells exposed during craniectomy are skeletonized and packed with bone dust, then covered with Surgicel soaked with Tisseel fibrin glue. The use of this technique has reduced the number of acoustic neurinoma cases requiring secondary mastoidectomy for CSF leakage from 16% to 5%. 
1	Prognostic value of immunocytologic detection of bone marrow metastases in neuroblastoma. BACKGROUND. Morphologic evaluation of bone marrow for neuroblastoma cells is a routine and important component of clinical staging. Specific immunostaining of malignant cells with monoclonal antibodies should be more sensitive, however, and may improve the detection of metastases and provide additional prognostic information. METHODS. We looked for tumor cells in bone marrow from 197 patients with newly diagnosed neuroblastoma, using immunoperoxidase staining with monoclonal antibodies (immunocytologic analysis) and examination of smears and specimens obtained by trephine biopsy (conventional analysis). RESULTS. Routine smears and trephine-biopsy specimens were positive for tumor cells in 46 percent of the patients, whereas 67 percent were positive on immunocytologic analysis (P less than 0.0001). Immunocytologic analysis detected bone marrow metastases in 34 percent of patients considered to have only localized or regional disease (Stage I, II, or III). It also identified tumor cells that were not detected by conventional analysis in patients with widespread disease (Stage IV or IVS). Tumor content, as determined by immunocytologic analysis, predicted clinical outcome in relation to the age of the patient at diagnosis. Patients with Stage II or III disease diagnosed after one year of age who did not have occult marrow metastases did well, whereas those with metastases did poorly (P = 0.006). Patients in whom Stage IV disease was diagnosed before they were one year of age did well if bone marrow metastases were few or absent, but had poor survival if the marrow contained more than 0.02 percent tumor cells (P = 0.03). CONCLUSIONS. Immunocytologic analysis of bone marrow aspirates is more sensitive than conventional analysis in detecting tumor cells and provides prognostic information. The relations among marrow metastases, age at diagnosis, and clinical outcome illustrate the biologic heterogeneity of neuroblastoma. 
5	Iliofemoral arterial complications of balloon angioplasty for systemic obstructions in infants and children The medical and radiological records of 64 consecutive infants and children who underwent transfemoral balloon dilation of the aorta or aortic valve were reviewed to determine the incidence, nature, and post-treatment outcome of acute iliofemoral complications. Balloon dilation angioplasty or balloon valvotomy was performed with 8F and 9F catheters without an arterial sheath. Patients ranged in age from 5 days to 15.4 years (mean, 6.4 years). Of 64 patients, 29 (45.3%) had an acute iliofemoral complication, including thrombosis (18 of 64), complete disruption (five of 64), incomplete disruption (three of 64), and arterial tear (three of 64). The arterial pathology was confirmed in 23 of 29 patients by one or a combination of surgical exploration and repair (18 of 29), angiography (six of 29), and magnetic resonance imaging (three of 29). Of eight patients, three with arterial disruption had acute hypotension requiring transfusion and immediate surgery; the other five had absent pedal pulses after the procedure. Of these five, three developed bleeding during thrombolytic therapy and underwent surgical exploration, and two were diagnosed by angiography after ineffective thrombolytic therapy. Angiography in three patients with iliac artery avulsion showed tapered occlusion in two and an aneurysm in one. In patients with iliofemoral thrombosis, angiography showed occlusion from the puncture site to the origin of the external iliac artery. Eleven patients (17% of the entire group and 38% of the group with acute iliofemoral complications) had reduced or absent pedal pulses at the time of discharge. A significant correlation was found between increased incidence of iliofemoral thrombosis and disruption (as well as abnormal pedal pulses at hospital discharge) and low patient weight. 
4	Prevalence of coronary heart disease in Scotland: Scottish Heart Health Study Data from 10,359 men and women aged 40-59 years from 22 districts in the Scottish Heart Health Study were used to describe the prevalence rates of coronary heart disease in Scotland in 1984-1986 and their relation to the geographical variation in mortality in these districts. Prevalence was measured by previous history, Rose chest pain questionnaire, and the Minnesota code of a 12 lead resting electrocardiogram. The prevalence of coronary heart disease in Scotland was high compared with studies from other countries that used the same standardised methods. A history of angina was more common in men (5.5%) than in women (3.9%), though in response to the Rose questionnaire 8.5% of women and 6.3% of men reported chest pain. A history of myocardial infarction was three times more common in men than women, as was a Q/QS pattern on the electrocardiogram. There were significant correlations between the different measures of coronary prevalence. District measures of angina correlated well with mortality from coronary heart disease, and these correlations tended to be stronger in women than in men. There was no significant correlation between mortality from coronary heart disease and measures of myocardial infarction. The study provides data on the prevalence of coronary heart disease in men and women that are valuable for the planning of cardiological services. 
4	The case against childhood cholesterol screening Because some authorities have proposed blood cholesterol screening for children to prevent coronary heart disease, we reviewed published studies to estimate the potential risks and benefits of such screening. Childhood cholesterol levels are a poor predictor of high cholesterol levels in young adulthood and will be an even poorer predictor of coronary heart disease later in life. There is no evidence that blood cholesterol levels can be lowered more easily in children than in adults, and it seems unlikely that cholesterol reduction in childhood will be much more effective at preventing coronary heart disease than cholesterol reduction begun in middle age. Screening and interventions to lower blood cholesterol levels for millions of children would be expensive, could lead to labeling and family conflicts, and may cause malnutrition and increased noncardiovascular mortality. Because the benefits of cholesterol screening are unlikely to exceed these risks, we conclude that children should not be screened for high blood cholesterol levels. 
5	Epidural anaesthesia for labour and caesarean section in a parturient with a single ventricle and transposition of the great arteries. We describe a case of a 29-year-old parturient with a single ventricle and transposition of the great arteries who had lumbar epidural analgesia/anaesthesia with a local anaesthetic for labour, emergency Caesarean section and postoperative pain. Her outcome and that of her baby was successful. The anaesthetic techniques used in other parturients with similar congenital cardiac anomalies are reviewed. 
1	Acute promyelocytic leukemia: impact of hemorrhagic complications on response to induction chemotherapy and survival. From 1976 to 1989, 21 adult patients with previously untreated acute promyelocytic leukemia were seen at the University of Virginia Hospital. We reviewed their cases retrospectively to determine the impact of hemorrhagic complications and other factors on treatment outcome. We observed a complete remission rate of 35%; the median survival in complete responders was 15 months. Evidence of disseminated intravascular coagulation was found in 13 (62%) of the 21 cases at diagnosis. Fatal intracranial hemorrhage was the leading cause of death, occurring in eight (40%) of the 20 patients evaluated. Initial leukocyte count greater than 4.0 x 10(9)/L and platelet count less than 20 x 10(9)/L were significantly associated with an increased risk of intracranial hemorrhage. In patients with disseminated intravascular coagulation, the rate of intracranial hemorrhage was reduced by treatment with heparin. The high mortality of 40% (8/20) due to intracranial hemorrhage during induction was a major contributor to the low complete remission rate of 35% (7/20) in this series of consecutive unselected patients with newly diagnosed acute promyelocytic leukemia. 
4	A systemic non-lytic state and local thrombolytic failure of anistreplase (anisoylated plasminogen streptokinase activator complex, APSAC) in acute myocardial infarction. The relation between coronary thrombolysis and coagulation variables after administration of anistreplase (anisoylated plasminogen streptokinase activator complex, APSAC) was studied in patients with an acute myocardial infarction. Fifty eight consecutive patients with acute myocardial infarction were given 30 U of anistreplase intravenously within 4 hours of the onset of symptoms. A fall in the plasma concentration fibrinogen to less than 1.0 g/l 90 minutes after administration of anistreplase was considered to reflect a systemic lytic state. Coronary angiography was performed 48 hours after thrombolytic treatment. The overall patency rate was 74% (43/58). Patency rates were significantly different in patients with a systemic lytic (83% (43/52)) and a systemic non-lytic state (0% (0/6)). The absence of a systemic lytic state after anistreplase administration seemed to be highly predictive of the failure of coronary thrombolysis. Coagulation studies showed evidence of inhibition of anistreplase induced fibrinolytic activity which may explain the failure of thrombolytic treatment in patients with evidence of a systemic non-lytic state. 
4	Ultrastructural changes in rat hearts following cold cardioplegic ischemia of differing duration and differing modes of reperfusion. Morphologic consequences of prolonged global hypothermic (15 degrees C), cardioplegic ischemia and two reperfusion techniques were studied in Langendorff-perfused rat hearts. A 'gentle' reperfusion technique, with gradual rise in perfusate temperature and pressure to physiologic levels over 30 min, was used for 12 hearts following 2-hour or 3 1/2-hour (6 in each group) ischemia. Abrupt reperfusion, with perfusate at 37 degrees C and 70 mmHg, was performed on 13 hearts (6 ischemic for 2 hours and 7 for 3 1/2 hours). Six nonischemic, perfused hearts served as controls. Randomly selected specimens from the left ventricle after 45-60 min reperfusion were prepared for transmission electron microscopy. Volume fractions of myocardial structural components were calculated from stereologic point-counting on the electron micrographs. Two-way analysis of variance revealed that interstitial edema developed with increasing ischemic time and was not influenced by reperfusion technique. The degree of endothelial damage was independent of ischemic time, but was lessened by 'gentle' reperfusion. Both mitochondrial injury and myocyte edema were less when perfusate temperature and pressure were slowly raised after 3 1/2-hour ischemia. 
5	The mec-4 gene is a member of a family of Caenorhabditis elegans genes that can mutate to induce neuronal degeneration Three dominant mutations of mec-4, a gene needed for mechanosensation, cause the touch-receptor neurons of Caenorhabditis elegans to degenerate. With deg-1, another C. elegans gene that can mutate to induce neuronal degeneration and that is similar in sequence, mec-4 defines a new gene family. Cross-hybridizing sequences are detectable in other species, raising the possibility that degenerative conditions in other organisms may be caused by mutations in similar genes. All three dominant mec-4 mutations affect the same amino acid. Effects of amino-acid substitutions at this position suggest that steric hindrance may induce the degenerative state. 
2	Systemic and renal production of thromboxane A2 and prostacyclin in decompensated liver disease and hepatorenal syndrome. To assess the role of altered renal and systemic production of thromboxane A2 and prostacyclin in the hepatorenal syndrome, urinary excretion of their major renal and extrarenal metabolites was measured in patients with compensated and decompensated liver disease, chronic renal failure, and hepatorenal syndrome. Urinary excretion rates of all prostanoids (renal and extrarenal) were increased in subjects with liver disease compared with normal controls. Moreover, they were considerably higher in subjects with severe hepatic decompensation but good renal function compared with those with hepatorenal syndrome. In contrast, the excretion rate of all metabolites was reduced in patients with chronic renal failure. The excretion rate of all metabolites was markedly elevated during the early stages of hepatorenal syndrome and decreased in parallel with creatinine clearance. When corrected for creatinine clearance, there was a strong correlation between prostanoid excretion and serum bilirubin in subjects with liver disease; there was no difference, however, in the excretion of renal and extrarenal prostanoids between hepatorenal syndrome and severe hepatic decompensation. It is concluded that hepatic decompensation is associated with a progressive increase in prostanoid excretion but that changes in production of prostacyclin or thromboxane A2 are unlikely to be major factors in the pathogenesis of the hepatorenal syndrome. 
4	Lung vascular injury after administration of viable hemolysin-forming Escherichia coli in isolated rabbit lungs. Escherichia coli hemolysin, a transmembrane pore-forming exotoxin, is considered an important virulence factor. In the present study, the possible significance of hemolysin production was investigated in a model of septic lung failure through infusion of viable bacteria in isolated rabbit lungs; 10(4) to 10(7) E. coli/ml perfusate caused a dose- and time-dependent appearance of hemolysin, accompanied by release of potassium, thromboxane A2, and PGI2 into the perfusate. Concomitantly, marked pulmonary hypertension developed. Inhibitor studies suggested that the pressor response was predominantly mediated by pulmonary thromboxane generation. Administration of hemolysin-forming E. coli additionally caused a protracted, dose-dependent increase in the lung capillary filtration coefficient, followed by severe edema formation. The permeability increase was independent of lung prostanoid generation. An E. coli strain that releases an inactive form of hemolysin completely failed to provoke the described biophysical and biochemical responses. Preapplication of 2 x 10(8) human granulocytes was without effect in the present experimental model. We conclude that the hemolysin produced by low numbers of E. coli organisms can provoke thromboxane-mediated pulmonary hypertension and severe vascular leakage. E. coli hemolysin and, possibly, other related cytolysins may thus contribute directly to the pathogenesis of acute respiratory failure under conditions of sepsis or pneumonia. 
5	Heart weights of white men 20 to 39 years of age. An analysis of 218 autopsy cases. Review of autopsy data for 218 white men between 20 and 39 years of age who died of injuries or suddenly and unexpectedly indicated a mean heart weight of 371 g. The mean for those dying of external causes was 364 g whereas the mean for those dying of natural causes was 446 g. A coefficient for heart weight expressed as a percentage of body weight was lower in heavy individuals than lightweight individuals; it ranged between 0.38% and 0.55%, with a mean of 0.48%. Heart weight, including epicardial fat, increased with age and body weight. These data may be useful to those who are called upon to investigate sudden and unexpected deaths. 
1	Chest wall involvement by lung cancer: computed tomographic detection and results of operation. The aim of this prospective study was to evaluate: (1) the role of computed tomographic scanning in predicting chest wall invasion by peripheral lung cancer and (2) the results of operation according to the depth of chest wall involvement and other potential indicators of long-term survival. One hundred twelve patients with non-small cell lung cancer adjacent to the pleural surface who underwent computed tomographic scanning and subsequent thoracotomy were entered into this study. Tumor invasion was confined to the visceral pleura in 53 patients, to the parietal pleura in 18 patients, and to intercostal muscles in 25 patients; invasion extended beyond this layer in 16 patients. The computed tomographic criteria for chest wall invasion were (1) obliteration of the extrapleural fat plane, (2) the length of the tumor-pleura contact, (3) the ratio between the tumor-pleura contact and the tumor diameter, (4) the angle of the tumor with the pleura, (5) a mass involving the chest wall, and (6) rib destruction. The computed tomographic criteria 1 and 3 were significantly related to pathologic findings. Sensitivity was 85% for criterion 1 and 83% for criterion 3, specificity being 87% and 80%, respectively. Long-term survival of patients with T3 disease critically depended on the lymph node state and completeness of resection. The adenocarcinoma cell type and the T4 category were unfavorable prognostic factors. The depth of chest wall invasion did not affect survival, except for extensive rib and soft tissue infiltration. En bloc resection yielded better results than discontinuous resection. 
1	High survival rate in advanced-stage B-cell lymphomas and leukemias without CNS involvement with a short intensive polychemotherapy: results from the French Pediatric Oncology Society of a randomized trial of 216 children. From April 1984 to December 1987, the French Pediatric Oncology Society (SFOP) organized a randomized trial for advanced-stage B-cell lymphoma without CNS involvement to study the possibility of reducing the length of treatment to 4 months. After receiving the same three intensive six-drug induction courses based on high-dose fractionated cyclophosphamide, high-dose methotrexate (HD MTX), and cytarabine in continuous infusion, patients were evaluated for remission. Those who achieved complete remission (CR) were randomized between a long arm (five additional courses with two additional drugs; 16 weeks of treatment) and a short arm (two additional courses; 5 weeks). For patients in partial remission (PR), intensification of treatment was indicated. Two hundred sixteen patients were registered: 15 stage II nasopharyngeal and extensive facial tumors, 167 stage III, and 34 stage IV, 20 of the latter having more than 25% blast cells in bone marrow. The primary sites of involvement were abdomen in 172, head and neck in 30, thorax in two, and other sites in 12. One hundred sixty-seven patients are alive in first CR with a minimum follow-up of 18 months; four are lost to follow-up. Eight patients died from initial treatment failure, 14 died from toxicity or deaths unrelated to tumor or treatment, and 27 relapsed. The event-free survival (EFS), with a median follow-up of 38 months, is 78% (SE 3) for all the patients, 73% (SE 11) for the stage II patients, 80% (SE 3) for the stage III patients, and 68% (SE 8) for the stage IV and acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) patients. One hundred sixty-six patients were randomized: 82 in the short arm and 84 in the long arm. EFS is, respectively, 89% and 87%. Statistical analysis confirms equivalence of both treatment arms with regard to EFS. Moreover, morbidity was lower in the short arm. This study confirms the high survival rate obtained in the previous LMB 0281 study without radiotherapy or debulking surgery and demonstrates the effectiveness of short treatment. 
5	Bacteriology of the ethmoid bullae in children with chronic sinusitis. Cultures from 105 children with chronic sinusitis who had failed aggressive medical management were retrospectively studied. Patients with immunodeficiency and cystic fibrosis were excluded from the study. Because the most common sites of disease were the infundibula and anterior ethmoid sinuses, samples of mucosa removed from the anterior ethmoid bullae during endoscopic ethmoidectomy were routinely cultured for aerobic and anaerobic organisms. Fungal cultures were performed for 55 bullae. The principal organisms isolated were alpha-hemolytic Streptococcus, Staphylococcus aureus, Moraxella catarrhalis, Streptococcus pneumoniae, and Haemophilus influenzae non-type B. Only 12 anaerobic organisms and four fungi were isolated. Of the 204 bullae cultured, multiple organisms were found in 61 bullae and 40 showed no growth. Isolates of other less common organisms were also found. These data are analyzed on the basis of age and duration of symptoms, and antibiotic treatment is described. 
2	Cereal-based oral rehydration therapy. II. Strategic issues for its implementation in national diarrheal disease control programs. Field studies in Bangladesh demonstrated that after proper training, village mothers were able to prepare and use rice-based, salt-enriched oral rehydration solutions containing safe concentrations of sodium, and were capable of achieving significantly fewer treatment failures and a reduction in the duration of diarrhea than with glucose-based oral rehydration solutions (ORS). An additional longitudinal study showed that improved growth and weight gain occurred with the consistent use of ORS; the effect was greater when rice-based ORS were used. In addition, the following possible limitations and benefits of cereal-based oral rehydration therapy, which are relevant to the strategies for its implementation in national diarrheal disease control programs, are discussed: safety, osmolarity, hypernatremia, spoiling, effectiveness, rehydration ability, reduction in diarrhea volume and duration, nutritional effects, effect on food intake, acceptance and usage by care givers, training of health workers, self-reliance of families, effect on other child survival activities, costs, potential problems in changing to cereal-based ORS, and the role of industrial production in packaged cereal-based ORS. 
3	Accidental death from a black-powder rifle breech plug. Authentic black-powder muzzle-loader weapons and replicas are used today primarily for hunting game such as deer and hogs. The following is a case presentation of accidental death from cerebral trauma caused by a .45-caliber black-powder-rifle breech plug implanting in the victim's brain. 
5	Effects of medical and surgical treatment on cerebral perfusion and cognition in patients with chronic cerebral ischemia. The effects of medical treatment with and without cerebral revascularization procedures on cognition and cerebral blood flow were compared among 36 patients with extracranial occlusive cerebrovascular disease and cognitive impairments. Three comparable groups were studied. The first group (N = 18) received only medical treatment by control of risk factors for stroke (including hypertension, diabetes, and hyperlipidemia) and antiplatelet aggregant medication. The second group (N = 10) had the same medical treatment plus superficial temporal-to-middle cerebral artery bypass, and the third group had the same medical treatment plus carotid endarterectomy. Regional cerebral blood flow and cognition were monitored in all three treatment groups over a 3-year interval. All groups showed stabilization without expected rates of decline for both cerebral blood flow and cognition, but no statistically significant differences emerged among the treatment groups. 
5	Spontaneous bacterial peritonitis due to Salmonella enteritidis in cirrhotic ascites. Spontaneous bacterial peritonitis due to Salmonella is uncommon. We report three patients with ascites infected by Salmonella. All three patients had advanced chronic liver disease, typically cirrhosis with portal hypertension. Salmonella enteritidis grew in the ascite fluid culture of the three patients. There was no clinical or microbiological evidence of Salmonella infection other than in the ascitic fluid. One patient died before antibiotic treatment was started, but the other two were treated with different combinations of antimicrobial drugs. One of them died on the fourteenth day of hospitalization, and the other survived. 
4	Randomized trials in the study of antihypertensive drugs. Heterogeneity in response to antihypertensive drugs can be addressed by randomized trials in individual subjects. In such a trial a patient receives pairs of treatment periods (one period of each pair active drug, one matched placebo, in random order); patient and clinician are blinded to allocation, and treatment targets are monitored. These trials can optimize antihypertensive therapy in clinical practice and facilitate the investigation of new drugs and the study of pathophysiology. Such trials also have potential in helping decide whether common, nonspecific symptoms reported by patients are really drug related. 
2	Acute cholangitis. Cholangitis is an infection of the biliary ductal system that results from the combination of bactibilia and biliary obstruction. Choledocholithiasis has been the leading cause of cholangitis. However, in recent years, especially at tertiary referral centers, nonoperative biliary manipulations, often in patients with unresectable malignancies, have become the most common cause of cholangitis. As a result, the complete triad of fever and chills, jaundice, and abdominal pain, as originally described by Charcot, is now seen less frequently. Most patients still have leukocytosis and abnormal liver function tests, but many patients with indwelling tubes may develop cholangitis without significant jaundice. E. coli, Klebsiella species, and the enterococci remain the most frequently isolated organisms, and anaerobes including Bacteroides fragilis are recovered in 15% to 30% of patients. However, Enterobacter and Pseudomonas species, as well as yeasts, are now being isolated more frequently from patients with indwelling tubes, who often have been treated previously with antibiotics. Computed cholangiography usually is necessary to determine the cause and site of biliary obstruction. In the majority of patients with cholangitis, cholangiography can be delayed until the patient has been afebrile for a minimum of 24 to 48 hours. Initial therapy includes bowel rest, intravenous fluids, and antibiotics. Many antibiotic regimens are now available to cover the gram-negative aerobes, the enterococcus, and the anaerobes that are likely to be causing the biliary infection. The combination of a penicillin and an aminoglycoside has been the gold standard. However, recent studies suggest that the newer broad-spectrum penicillins provide adequate therapy for these patients. Only a small percentage (5%-10%) of patients with toxic cholangitis require emergency biliary decompression. The choice of percutaneous or endoscopic drainage should be made on the basis of the presumed site and cause of obstruction as well as local expertise. The nature of the biliary obstruction may be the most important determinant of outcome. At present, patients with end-stage malignant obstruction account for most of the deaths, whereas approximately 95% of patients survive an episode of cholangitis. 
2	Management of the acute abdomen complicating oral anticoagulation therapy. Acute abdominal pain in the patient receiving oral anticoagulants poses a difficult diagnostic and therapeutic challenge. We describe two cases of peritonitis requiring laparotomy in anticoagulated patients, and review 49 similar case reports from the world literature. These patients were usually explored for signs of bowel obstruction. At operation, the intestine often appeared infarcted, but pathologic examination commonly revealed intramural hematomata. In contrast, we present microscopic evidence of hemorrhagic cecal infarction complicating oral anticoagulation therapy in one patient. Intramural intestinal hemorrhage is the most common cause of acute abdominal pain in the anticoagulated patient who undergoes laparotomy. In addition to intramural hemorrhage, 14 per cent of patients had coexistent volvulus, appendicitis, intestinal wall disruption or intestinal infarction. We conclude that anticoagulated patients with suspected intramural intestinal hemorrhage may have severe intraabdominal pathology requiring operation. Therefore, operation is mandatory for patients who fail to improve after a short course of expectant management. 
2	Cardiorespiratory effects of endoscopic esophageal variceal sclerotherapy. Endoscopic variceal sclerotherapy (EVS) is an effective means of controlling variceal hemorrhage, which develops as a consequence of portal hypertension. While esophageal perforation, ulceration, strictures, and mediastinitis are potential complications associated with this procedure, it is not clear whether isolated pleuropulmonary events such as pleuritis, pneumonitis, and adult respiratory distress syndrome are causally related to the EVS. Endoscopy and sedation with the attendant risk of aspiration, particularly in the background of hepatic encephalopathy, may account for some of these events. Recent controlled studies of respiratory function demonstrate that EVS as such results in minor changes in gas exchange, lung volumes, and pulmonary and systemic hemodynamics. Most pulmonary complications have been reported with the use of sodium morrhuate sclerosant. Comparative studies among different sclerosants are necessary to evaluate relative safety. Finally, there have been rare reports of myocardial ischemia and pericarditis reported in association with EVS, but these are of a transient nature. Chest symptoms, roentgenographic pleuropulmonary changes, pulmonary hemodynamics, and cardiac perturbations are transient and should not preclude offering EVS to patients with variceal hemorrhage. 
5	Vasopressin-related bullous disease of the legs. We report a 33-year-old man who developed cutaneous necrosis of the lower extremities with extensive bulla formation after i.v. administration of vasopressin for the treatment of bleeding esophageal varices. Due to its potent nonselective vasoconstrictive action, vasopressin not only may induce cardiac and gastrointestinal ischemia, but cutaneous ischemia as well. As in our patient, this may lead to extensive necrotic skin lesions at sites distant from the infusion. 
4	Long-term prognosis of myocardial ischemia detected by Holter monitoring in peripheral vascular disease. To assess the long-term prognostic significance of myocardial ischemia, as measured by ambulatory electrocardiographic monitoring, in patients with occlusive peripheral arterial disease, 176 eligible patients scheduled for elective peripheral arterial surgery at Brigham and Women's Hospital were prospectively studied. All patients were monitored preoperatively without alterations to baseline medications. Prospective follow-up was obtained during routine medical care as provided by blinded, independent physicians and by subsequent telephone contact with the patients. Thirty-two patients (18%) had a total of 75 episodes of myocardial ischemia, 73 (97%) of which were asymptomatic. During a mean follow-up period of 615 days, there were 9 cardiac deaths, 1 occurring in-hospital after peripheral vascular surgery, and 13 nonfatal myocardial infarctions, 4 occurring in-hospital after peripheral vascular surgery. Cardiac events occurred in 12 of 32 patients with ischemia (38%), including 6 cardiac deaths, and in 10 of 144 patients without ischemia (7%), including 3 cardiac deaths (risk ratio 5.4, 95% confidence interval 2.6 to 11.4). The sensitivity of ischemia was 55%, the specificity was 87%, the positive predictive value was 38%, and the negative predictive value was 93%. In a multivariate Cox proportional-hazards model controlling for age, gender, coronary risk factors, history of angina, myocardial infarction, coronary artery disease and antianginal medications, the presence of ischemia was the only independent predictor of outcome. In patients with peripheral arterial disease, who often are unable to perform adequate exercise testing, ambulatory monitoring for myocardial ischemia is a significant independent predictor of 1- to 2-year prognosis. 
4	An effective treatment protocol for intraarterial drug injection. Between 1972 and 1988, 48 patients with extremity ischemia after an intraarterial drug injection were treated with the following protocol: heparin, dextran 40, dexamethasone, elevation, and early mobilization of the extremity. A tissue ischemia score, derived by assessing the color, capillary refill, sensory function, and temperature of the extremity, was used to assess the ischemic injury. Each sign was scored either normal = 0 or abnormal = 1; then summed to provide the tissue ischemia score (range, 0 to 4). Twenty-four (50%) patients had an extremity tissue ischemia score less than or equal to 2. After treatment 22 of the 24 patients had a normal extremity, and 2 required limited digital amputations. In this group, outcome was comparable regardless of the time interval from intraarterial drug injection to treatment. Ten of 24 (50%) patients with an extremity tissue ischemia score greater than 2 had a normal extremity, 3 had a functional deficit, and 11 required digital amputations. Twelve of the 24 patients were treated within 24 hours and had a significantly superior outcome when compared to the 12 who were treated more than 24 hours after intraarterial drug injection (p less than 0.001, Fisher's exact test). The tissue ischemia score is a useful predictor of extremity outcome in patients with intraarterial drug injection. The outlined treatment protocol is effective in minimizing tissue injury caused by intraarterial drug injection. Institution of treatment within 24 hours of intraarterial drug injection is particularly important in patients who manifest severe ischemia. 
5	Hemodynamic effects of H2-receptor antagonists. Histamine H2-receptor antagonists (H2RAs) often are administered to intensive care unit patients in an attempt to reduce gastric acidity and to prevent stress-related mucosal damage. These agents have an extremely low overall incidence and severity of adverse reactions; however, hemodynamically significant hypotension has been noted. Clinical studies with rapidly administered intravenous cimetidine in critically ill patients have demonstrated a depression in blood pressure in up to 75 percent of patients. Ranitidine, also studied in this setting, does not appear to induce similar hemodynamic changes. The newer H2RAs, famotidine and nizatidine, have not been evaluated in critically ill patients. 
5	Multiplexing studies of effects of rapid atrial pacing on the area of slow conduction during atrial flutter in canine pericarditis model. BACKGROUND. We report that rapid atrial pacing interrupts atrial flutter when the orthodromic wave front from the pacing impulse is blocked in an area of slow conduction in the reentry circuit. To characterize the area of slow conduction during atrial flutter and rapid pacing, we studied 11 episodes of induced atrial flutter, mean cycle length 157 +/- 20 msec, in eight dogs with sterile pericarditis. METHODS AND RESULTS. Atrial electrograms were recorded simultaneously from 95 pairs of right atrial electrodes during the interruption of atrial flutter by rapid atrial pacing, mean cycle length 139 +/- 21 msec. Areas of slow conduction during atrial flutter were demonstrated at one to three sites in the reentry circuit. After rapid pacing captured the reentry circuit, one area of slow conduction either disappeared (10 episodes) or the degree of slow conduction in an area of slow conduction decreased (one episode). Both changes were in association with activation of the region by a wave front from the pacing impulse that arrived from a direction different than that during the induced atrial flutter. Interruption of atrial flutter during rapid pacing occurred when the orthodromic wave front from the pacing impulse blocked in an area of slow conduction that had either newly evolved during rapid pacing (seven episodes) or that was previously present (four episodes). CONCLUSIONS. Areas of slow conduction present during atrial flutter and rapid pacing of atrial flutter are functional and depend on both the atrial rate and the direction of the circulating wave fronts. Interruption of atrial flutter by rapid pacing results from block of the orthodromic wave front of the pacing impulse in an area of slow conduction in the reentry circuit. 
5	Risk factors for multiorgan failure: a case-control study. The aim of this study was to identify factors associated with Multiple Organ Failure (MOF), and assess possible interactions between the risk factors identified as such. We studied 40 MOF cases and 120 controls, out of all the surgery and trauma patients who needed intensive care at our institution in a 24-month period. The univariate analyses showed that age, hypovolemic shock, massive volume administration (MVA), sepsis, and time of evolution before arriving to the hospital (TE) were significantly associated with MOF. Logistic regression analysis showed that neither age nor MVA were independently associated with MOF after adjusting for all of the other variables. Interactions seemed to be present between age, sepsis, and shock. We conclude that in our surgery and trauma ICU adult patient population, hypovolemic shock, sepsis, and TE are independent risk factors for MOF. The importance of the association between shock and sepsis is discussed, as well as the possible relevance of TE as a risk factor. 
1	Localization and surgical treatment of occult insulinomas. Management of patients with biochemical evidence of insulinoma and negative preoperative imaging studies (occult) tumors is controversial, varying from primarily medical management to aggressive, blind nearly total pancreatectomy to extirpate the tumor. Since 1982, 12 consecutive patients with occult insulinoma underwent preoperative portal venous sampling (PVS) for insulin followed by surgical exploration with intraoperative ultrasound (IOUS). Eleven of twelve patients (92%) had insulinoma removed and were cured. Portal venous sampling correctly predicted the location of the insulinoma in 9 patients (75%) and that no tumor would be found in another patient. A fourfold insulin gradient in the pancreatic tail of one patient correctly predicted that a distal pancreatectomy would remove the insulinoma despite the fact that neither palpation nor IOUS identified any tumor. Intraoperative ultrasound was the single best method to identify occult tumors because it correctly identified 10 of 11 insulinomas that were found, including five pancreatic head tumors that were not palpable. Palpation identified five insulinomas. Of the 10 tumors that were identified during operation by palpation or ultrasound, IOUS identified significantly more (100% versus 50%, p = 0.03) and guided the successful enucleation of each. The results support the strategy of preoperative PVS and operation with IOUS to localize and remove insulinoma in patients with occult tumors. Most tumors (75%) will be correctly localized to a specific pancreatic region by preoperative PVS and identified by IOUS (83%), allowing simple enucleation and biochemical correction of hypoglycemia. Morbid blind pancreatic resections are no longer indicated and long-term medical management of hypoglycemia should be reserved for the occasional patient (8%) who fails preoperative PVS and operation guided by IOUS. 
5	Renal disease in chronic arthritis of childhood. A study of urinary N-acetyl-beta-glucosaminidase and beta 2-microglobulin excretion. Urinalyses of randomly obtained samples from children with various types of chronic arthritis revealed proteinuria in 2.3% of patients, hemoglobinuria in 3.5%, erythrocyturia in 4.1%, and leukocyturia in 5.3%; these frequencies are within the range found by screening school children. However, raised urinary levels of N-acetyl-beta-glucosaminidase and/or beta 2-microglobulin (both sensitive measures of renal tubular damage) were found more frequently in children with chronic arthritis than in controls (P less than 0.0001). Abnormalities of either N-acetyl-beta-glucosaminidase or beta 2-microglobulin excretion were associated with active arthritis as measured by physician global estimate of disease activity, with a polyarticular onset of juvenile rheumatoid arthritis, and with the use of slow-acting antirheumatic drugs or the concurrent use of more than 1 nonsteroidal antiinflamtory drug. Abnormal renal tubular function appears to be common in chronic arthritis of childhood. The long-term consequences of this abnormality remain to be elucidated. 
5	Role of nasal allergy in chronic maxillary sinusitis--diagnostic value of nasal challenge with allergen. The role of nasal allergy in chronic maxillary sinusitis without an air-fluid level was studied in 37 patients. Seventy-three nasal provocation tests with various inhalant allergens were performed in 37 patients by means of rhinomanometry, and maxillary sinus radiographs were performed before and repeatedly after the allergen challenge. Forty-one positive nasal responses (NRs) occurred in 29 patients; 13 were immediate only, 18 were late only, and 10 NRs were dual responses. Of these responses, 32 demonstrated radiographic changes, primarily an increase in mucosal edema and/or opacification. These responses were accompanied by increased pressure in the maxillary sinuses, acute headache, and sometimes otalgia. Eight patients did not develop any NRs; however, increased thickening of the mucosal membrane of the maxillary sinuses, accompanied by subjective symptoms, was recorded in three of these nonresponders. These results demonstrate the role of nasal allergy in some patients with chronic maxillary sinusitis, which may affect the diagnostic and therapeutic approaches to this disorder. 
3	The use of obstetric analgesia in Sweden 1983-1986 The use of obstetric analgesia was investigated in a Swedish population-based prospective study of 335,207 births, which represents almost all women who had vaginal deliveries in Sweden between 1983 and 1986. Lumbar epidural analgesia (EDA) was used in 16%, paracervical block (PCB) in 12%, pethidine or morphine in 49% and pudendal block in 62%. All four types of analgesia were much more commonly used by nulliparae than multiparae. Variables such as maternal age, smoking, nationality, relationship with the infant's father and gestational age had only moderate influence on the rates of different types of analgesia. EDA and PCB were more frequently used in larger than in smaller hospitals and in the daytime than at night. No such differences were found for pethidine or morphine, or pudendal block, which were administered routinely by midwives. 
1	Surgical management of renal cell carcinoma with extensive intracaval involvement using a venous bypass system suitable for rapid conversion to total cardiopulmonary bypass. Renal cell carcinoma involves the vena cava in approximately 4% of the patients. Presently surgical extirpation is the only form of therapy that can result in cure. Recently management of extensive vena caval involvement has involved the use of cardiopulmonary bypass with circulatory arrest and hypothermia. We describe a technique using a venous bypass pump system (femoral vein to right atrium) for resection of renal cell carcinoma with suprahepatic vena caval extension (type II), which avoids the risks and complications of cardiac arrest and hypothermia but allows for rapid conversion to total cardiopulmonary bypass should the intraoperative need arise. 
5	Obstructive jaundice: use of expandable metal endoprosthesis for biliary drainage. Work in progress. Expandable metal endoprostheses were implanted transhepatically in 61 patients with obstructive jaundice. Fifty-three patients had malignant and eight had benign obstructions. Because of the small diameter of the compressed stent (7 F), primary implantation of the stent without a previous catheter drainage was preferred. Postprocedural complications occurred in three patients (5%) (biliary pleuritis, peritonitis, hepatic artery aneurysm). The 30-day mortality rate was 8.2%. Reocclusions were observed in six of the patients with malignant obstructions (11%) (observation period, 1-10 months; mean, 4.5 months) and in two of the patients with benign stenoses (25%) (observation period, 3-21 months; mean, 9 months). The higher reocclusion rate of benign obstructions must be interpreted with care because of the small number of patients. From their preliminary experience, the authors conclude that expandable metal endoprostheses offer patency rates equal to those of plastic stents. The implantation trauma is reduced due to the small 7-F introducing catheter system. 
1	Clinical and pathological findings in prostates following intravesical bacillus Calmette-Guerin instillations. The prostates of 36 patients who were treated with intravesical bacillus Calmette-Guerin were evaluated by digital rectal examination and transrectal ultrasonography. When abnormal palpatory and/or ultrasonographic findings were detected, core needle biopsies from the suspicious areas were performed. Of the 36 patients 20 underwent biopsies of the prostate. Pathological findings revealed typical granulomas in 8 patients (3 caseating and 5 noncaseating multifocal granulomas). Nonspecific chronic prostatitis was noted in 4 patients and benign prostatic hyperplasia was noted in 8. The number of bacillus Calmette-Guerin instillations ranged from 6 to 19. The interval from initiation of therapy to biopsy ranged from 1.5 to 14.5 months. Caseating granulomas were found during the early course of bacillus Calmette-Guerin instillations (1.5 to 3.0 months), whereas noncaseating granulomas were detected at later stages (4 to 14.5 months). These findings present a high incidence of granuloma formation in patients treated with intravesical bacillus Calmette-Guerin. The duration of therapy is a determinant factor in the induction of granuloma type. 
2	Evidence for hypomotility in non-ulcer dyspepsia: a prospective multifactorial study. A prospective multifactorial study of symptoms and disturbance of gastrointestinal function has been undertaken in 50 patients with non-ulcer dyspepsia. Objective tests including solid meal gastric emptying studies, gastric acid secretion, E-HIDA scintiscan for enterogastric bile reflux, and hydrogen breath studies were carried out in all patients and validated against control data. Gastroscopy and biopsy were carried out in non-ulcer dyspepsia patients only. Non-ulcer dyspepsia patients were categorised on the basis of predominant symptoms as: dysmotility-like dyspepsia (n = 22); essential dyspepsia (n = 14), gastro-oesophageal reflux-like dyspepsia (n = 11); and ulcer-like dyspepsia (n = 3). In the total non-ulcer dyspepsia population, solid meal gastric emptying was delayed (T50 mean (SEM) = 102 (6) minutes (patients) v 64 (6) minutes (controls), (p less than 0.01) and high incidences of gastritis (n = 26) and Helicobacter pyloridis infection (n = 18) were found. An inverse correlation was observed between solid meal gastric emptying and fasting peak acid output (r = -0.4; p less than 0.01). Indeed gastric emptying was particularly prolonged in eight patients (T50 mean (SEM) = 139 (15) minutes) with hypochlorhydria. In the non-ulcer dyspepsia population oral to caecal transit time of a solid meal was delayed (mean SEM = 302 (14) minutes (patients) v 244 (12) minutes (controls) (p less than 0.01]. Seven patients had a dual peak of breath hydrogen suggestive of small bowel bacterial overgrowth. No association was observed between symptoms and any of the objective abnormalities. 
5	Recurrent peritonitis: evidence for possible viral etiology. A 45-year-old woman who was treated with continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD) developed recurrent peritonitis characterized by cloudy effluents, elevated white blood cell (WBC) counts (predominantly lymphocytes), and negative culture results. This case report suggests that she may have had viral peritonitis as indicated by a positive viral culture, the presence of viral antibodies in serum and peritoneal dialysis effluent (PDE), hematological findings, and cell surface receptor studies. The possibility of a viral cause should be considered in patients with culture-negative peritonitis, especially if they do not respond to antibiotics. 
1	Rectus abdominis muscle flap with microvascular anastomoses for repair of recurrent sarcoma. After radical resection of a recurrent leiomyosarcoma, the thoracic wall was stabilized with a Gore-Tex graft. The skin and soft tissue defect was repaired with a large rectus abdominis flap in which the circulation was secured by end-to-end microvascular anastomosis of the inferior epigastric artery to the internal mammary artery, which had to be cut during tumor removal. 
3	Multiple cranial nerve deficits after ethylene glycol poisoning. We report the cases of two patients who developed cranial nerve palsies after drinking ethylene glycol. A 33-year-old man developed multiple cranial nerve deficits nine days after the ingestion of ethylene glycol in a suicide attempt. Clinical findings included profound bilateral cranial nerve VII palsies and severe dysfunction of cranial nerves IX and X. The neuropathy occurred despite treatment with hemodialysis. The dysphagia completely cleared within two weeks, but at six months a severe bilateral cranial nerve VII dysfunction persisted. A 22-year-old man undergoing hemodialysis for ethylene glycol-induced renal failure developed bilateral cranial nerve VII dysfunction 14 days after ingestion. At a three-month follow-up, the patient demonstrated only moderate functional recovery. The etiology of the cranial nerve deficits is unknown but may be related to oxalate crystal deposition of ethylene glycol-induced pyridoxine dysfunction. 
5	Intraabdominal hemorrhage as a result of segmental mediolytic arteritis of an omental artery: case report. This article describes the fifth reported case of segmental mediolytic arteritis and the second in a survivor. The patient had intraabdominal bleeding as a result of a ruptured omental artery. The pathologic and arteriographic findings are described. The pathology is characterized by segmental disruption of the medial smooth muscle cells and the initiation of mediolysis. Mediolysis is associated with marked segmental thinning of the vessel wall, often with only the adventitia intact. Fibrin is deposited at the adventitial and medial surfaces, and hemorrhage into the media may occur. As in this reported case, lysis of the adventitia leads to sudden, often catastrophic intraabdominal hemorrhage. Little associated adventitial inflammation occurred. Segmental mediolytic arteritis seems to involve the intra-abdominal muscular arteries in elderly patients with nonspecific abdominal symptoms. An angiogram showed patchy areas of narrowing involving ileal, gastroduodenal, and renal arteries that correlated with the pathologic findings observed in the excised omental arteries. 
4	Double-blind randomized trial of perioperative fibrinolytic enhancement for femoropopliteal bypass. Patients with rest pain or acute peripheral arterial thrombosis are known to have impaired endogenous fibrinolysis, which is associated with an increased risk of early vascular graft thrombosis. This risk is exacerbated by the fibrinolytic shutdown which is known to occur after major surgery. Stanozolol, which has been demonstrated to enhance endogenous fibrinolysis, was therefore used in an attempt to prevent this perioperative fibrinolytic shutdown and so enhance graft patency. Twenty-seven patients were randomized to receive either 50 mg stanozolol or placebo intramuscularly 24 h before operation, followed by a 6 week course of either 5 mg stanozolol or placebo orally, twice daily. On the second day after operation, 10-11 MBq of autologous 111indium-labelled platelets were injected, with scanning over the graft on the 3 following days. Despite using a large depot of stanozolol, significant effects, such as raised plasminogen (P less than 0.001), reduced fibrinogen (P less than 0.001) and reduced euglobulin lysis time (P less than 0.001), were not seen until the seventh day after operation, with maximum benefit at 6 weeks. This was reflected in the 111indium-labelled platelet deposition studies. The placebo group had a progressive increase in platelet deposition on all 3 days. In contrast, those receiving stanozolol showed a lower, static picture of deposition. However, these changes did not attain statistical significance. Three patients experienced early graft thrombosis, two in the placebo group and one in the stanozolol group. Only an incomplete inhibition of the perioperative fibrinolytic shutdown was achieved. Much longer preoperative courses are thus required to allow the maximum effect to be present at the most crucial time. At present, perioperative fibrinolytic enhancement does not appear to be a practical proposition, and we must await the development of new safer and more potent agents. 
4	Accelerated transmural gradients of energy compound metabolism resulting from left ventricular hypertrophy. Eighteen dogs underwent transmural left ventricular biopsies for adenosine triphosphate and suturing of the noncoronary cusp, creating valvular aortic stenosis. Three months after aortic stenosis and the subsequent development of left ventricular hypertrophy, animals underwent repeat transmural left ventricular biopsies followed by total myocardial ischemia at 37 degrees C. Left ventricular tissue samples for adenosine triphosphate and lactate levels were determined at 15-minute intervals and compared with 15 control animals. No significant difference between subendocardial and subepicardial adenosine triphosphate levels was found between left ventricular samples taken before left ventricular hypertrophy and 3 months after left ventricular hypertrophy. Significant differences in adenosine triphosphate utilization occurred between subendocardial and subepicardial layers in control and left ventricular hypertrophy myocardium, however. The gradient between the subendocardium and the subepicardium was significantly increased by left ventricular hypertrophy (p less than 0.05). Significant differences also occurred within the same layer when left ventricular hypertrophy and control groups were compared. During total ischemia, lactate concentration was significantly greater within the subendocardium than within the subepicardium in left ventricular hypertrophy. The onset of ischemic contracture was 48.2 +/- 2.1 minutes in left ventricular hypertrophy versus 62.3 +/- 1.8 minutes in control hearts (p less than 0.01). Subendocardial intramyocardial pressure increased significantly earlier than subepicardial in both left ventricular hypertrophy and control hearts. Adenosine triphosphate was used, and lactate accumulated more rapidly in animals with a more pronounced hemodynamic gradient. These data show that after left ventricular hypertrophy, adenosine triphosphate stores in the subendocardium and the subepicardium are unchanged from control values, yet the rates of adenosine triphosphate utilization and lactate accumulation during total ischemia are significantly increased. Furthermore, the subendocardial to subepicardial gradient of adenosine triphosphate utilization during ischemia found in normal hearts is markedly increased by left ventricular hypertrophy. 
4	Chest pain in teenagers. When is it significant? Chest pain in teenagers often has no obvious organic cause. Onset of symptoms with an emotionally stressful situation may indicate psychogenic chest pain. The differential diagnosis also includes cardiac, musculoskeletal, gastrointestinal, and respiratory disorders. Routine testing generally does not help to establish a diagnosis and may even do harm by reinforcing a patient's unspoken fear of serious illness. Most teenagers with chest pain have no such illness, and symptoms usually resolve without therapy. An important role for primary care physicians is to provide support during evaluation and follow-up. 
5	Desmopressin in nocturnal enuresis. The effect of intranasal desmopressin on primary nocturnal enuresis was investigated in a study divided into 2 parts in which the first part was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled cross-over study of 52 Finnish school children 5 to 13 years old. A variety of approaches had previously been attempted in most children, including water deprivation, night awakenings, enuresis alarm and imipramine, without success. The patients were randomized to 4 periods of 3 weeks each: 2 periods on placebo and 2 periods on 20 micrograms. desmopressin spray. The entire 12-week treatment period was preceded and followed by control periods (without treatment). The number of dry nights, measured as calculated averages per week, increased significantly (p less than 0.01) from 0.6 dry nights during pre-treatment to 4.3 and 4.6 dry nights per week during the 2 desmopressin treatment periods, respectively. The placebo responses were 2.1 and 2.4 dry nights per week, respectively. The second part of the study was an open dose-finding and drug safety study of a further 3 months in duration. The aim was to evaluate the efficacy and tolerance of 20, 30 and 40 micrograms. doses. All 47 patients who relapsed during the post-treatment period in part 1 were included. During this period 53% of the patients responded fully, 19% were intermediate responders and 28% did not respond. As reported in other studies most patients suffered relapse after treatment. During continued treatment for 3 months at doses between 20 and 40 micrograms. desmopressin was well tolerated, had no effect on body weight or blood pressure and did not cause any adverse reactions. 
1	'High single-dose' European PUVA regimen also causes an excess of non-melanoma skin cancer. We report the results of a long-term (12.8 years) follow-up study of the detection of malignant and benign skin tumours in patients with psoriasis, who were treated with PUVA according to the European, 'high single-dose' regimen. A total of 13 squamous cell carcinomas (SCC) and 24 basal cell carcinomas (BCC) were diagnosed in 11 of 260 patients. The incidence of both SCC and BCC was increased in comparison with the general Dutch population. The ratio of SCC to BCC in the general population was 1:8 but was 1:2.5 in our study group. A positive correlation was observed between the development of SCC and the total UVA dosage, the age of the patient at the start of the PUVA treatment and a history of arsenic use. This dose-related increase in the incidence of SCC, reported in studies from the U.S.A., has not been found in earlier European studies. The average time period between the start of PUVA therapy and the diagnosis of the first malignant skin tumour was 6.0 years for SCC and 4.7 years for BCC. Among the 49 benign skin tumours were actinic keratoses, a keratoacanthoma and 'PUVA keratoses', a newly described hyperkeratotic lesion, especially found in PUVA-treated patients. 
5	Importance of sampling method in DNA analysis of lung cancer. Lung carcinomas are characterised by considerable histological variation within the tumour. The possible effects of this morphological heterogeneity on the estimation of tumour ploidy were investigated. Multiple tissue blocks were systematically taken from 20 lung tumours and analysed by flow cytometry. The routine, archival paraffin wax embedded diagnostic blocks from these cases were also analysed. Nineteen (95%) of the tumours were shown to contain aneuploid stemlines by systematic sampling, but if only one of these systematic tissue blocks had been taken from each case the incidence of DNA aneuploidy could have been as low as 45%. Only 15 (75%) tumours were aneuploid when all the routine archival blocks were analysed, but by specifically selecting tumour areas from the archival material the accuracy of this method was increased to 90%. It is concluded that tumour sampling methods are of primary importance in assessing the DNA content of lung tumours. Routine paraffin wax embedded archival tissue provides a suitable source of material for this purpose, provided that "turnover" selection is carried out. 
4	Medicare Peer Review Organization preprocedure review criteria. An analysis of criteria for three procedures The Medicare Peer Review Organization (PRO) program includes preprocedure review using explicit criteria to assess the appropriateness of specific procedures. This study evaluates the variability in the PRO preprocedure criteria for the three procedures most frequently reviewed by PROs: carotid endarterectomy, cataract removal, and cardiac pacemaker implants. In August 1989, the PRO review criteria were received from the Health Care Financing Administration. To provide a reference point for reviewing the PRO criteria, national practice guidelines for these three procedures were identified. Wide variability was demonstrated in the PRO procedure-specific carotid endarterectomy and cataract removal review criteria among PROs, and the criteria differed significantly from the identified practice guidelines. The criteria for cardiac pacemaker implants were somewhat less variable, and were based, to varying degrees, on practice guidelines developed by the American College of Cardiology (ACC). Greater attention is needed to improve the development of review criteria, including the use of relevant practice guidelines, to ensure that review criteria are optimal. 
1	Presentation of breast carcinoma as Volkmann's contracture due to skeletal muscle metastases. Metastases to the skeletal muscles are extremely rare. They usually occur during the course of a pulmonary or digestive carcinoma. We describe a case of breast carcinoma presenting with forearm muscle metastases and Volkmann's type contracture. 
5	Locally recurrent parathyroid neoplasms as a cause for recurrent and persistent primary hyperparathyroidism. Between 1982 and 1989, 145 patients underwent operations for persistent or recurrent primary hyperparathyroidism (HPT). At re-exploration, 15 patients (10.3%) were found to have locally recurrent parathyroid tumors (11 patients with adenoma and 4 with carcinoma). These 15 patients had 28 previous operations at outside institutions for HPT. Patients with locally recurrent HPT secondary to adenoma had a longer disease-free interval than patients with locally recurrent carcinoma. At the time of evaluation at the National Institutes of Health (NIH) for recurrent or persistent HPT, each patient was symptomatic and patients with carcinoma had significantly more symptoms and higher serum levels of calcium and parathyroid hormone than patients with adenoma. Locally recurrent parathyroid neoplasm was correctly localized by preoperative testing in 14 of 15 patients. These 15 patients underwent 18 reoperations at NIH for excision of locally recurrent parathyroid tumors. Following the final reoperation (two patients had more than one procedure), each patient had normal serum levels of calcium. In addition each patient remains biochemically cured (based on normal serum calcium level), with a median follow-up interval of 21 months. Local recurrence of parathyroid adenoma comprises a small but significant proportion of cases of recurrent or persistent HPT and can be indistinguishable from parathyroid carcinoma. Findings suggestive of carcinoma include shorter disease-free interval, higher serum levels of calcium and parathyroid hormone, and histologic appearance. Whether the locally recurrent parathyroid neoplasm is benign or malignant, aggressive surgery can control serum levels of calcium in these patients with acceptable rates of morbidity. 
3	Traumatic hyphaema: a retrospective study of 314 cases. A retrospective study was made of 314 consecutive cases of traumatic hyphaema in a mixed urban and rural Scottish population. Secondary haemorrhage occurred in 4.1% of cases and was not associated with a worsening of final visual acuity. There were no identifiable risk factors for secondary haemorrhage. Poor visual outcome was in most cases attributable to retinal pathology. The use of antifibrinolytic agents does not appear to be necessary in such a population, and the importance of detecting associated retinal detachment is emphasised. 
1	Human papillomavirus screening for women with atypical Papanicolaou smears. A study was undertaken to evaluate the utility of human papillomavirus (HPV) DNA screening and colposcopy in the management of women whose Papanicolaou smears demonstrated atypia less than dysplasia. Fifty patients whose initial Papanicolaou smears were interpreted as showing atypia less than dysplasia were evaluated for the presence of HPV 16 DNA in exfoliated cervicovaginal cells and for histologic findings on biopsy. Those 50 patients were compared to two groups of patients: one consisting of 124 patients with biopsy-documented cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) and another of 112 patients with normal Papanicolaou smears. The presence of HPV 16 DNA was confirmed with Southern analysis in 46% of patients with atypical Papanicolaou smears, 46% with confirmed CIN and 11.6% with normal Papanicolaou smears. The 50 patients with atypical smears underwent colposcopically directed cervical biopsies, revealing the following results: 14 (28%) had normal histology, 29 (58%) had koilocytosis without dysplasia, and 7 (14%) had CIN. HPV 16 DNA was present in exfoliated cervicovaginal cells from a large percentage of patients from each category (50% of patients with normal histology, 41.2% with koilocytosis and 57% with CIN). HPV 16 DNA screening did not predict which patients with atypical smears had underlying CIN. Colposcopically directed biopsy remains the evaluation method of choice. 
2	Intracatheter streptokinase for recurrent peritonitis in CAPD. Intracatheter streptokinase (SK) is advocated as effective treatment with minimal adverse effects in both recurrent bacterial peritonitis and catheter fibrin blockage in continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD) patients. We reviewed 35 instillations in 20 patients noting a high (86%) side effect profile consisting of fever, onset of turbid dialysis effluent and/or abdominal pain. SK probably releases fibrin clot containing bacteria, leukocytes and debris from the colonized catheter into the peritoneal cavity causing a "peritonitis-like syndrome" of 1 to 3 days duration. Fungal peritonitis occurred after SK in 2 patients. Failure of SK therapy was encountered in Staphylococcus epidermidis infection (p less than 0.05 versus other organisms), which may be related to its protective capsular polysaccharide slime and ability to adhere to plastic prosthetic devices. SK, in this study, was useful treatment in relapsing bacterial peritonitis (50% overall cure) but failed to correct catheter malfunction. 
4	Coagulation factor abnormalities as possible thrombotic risk factors after Fontan operations. Severe thromboembolism occurred in 3 of 37 patients who had undergone Fontan-type operations for correction of congenital heart defects several months to years after the operation. The patients were screened for coagulation factor abnormalities to find out whether known prothrombotic risk factors could explain the high frequency of thromboembolism. 63 abnormalities were found in 24 of the 37 patients. The commonest and most pronounced abnormality was deficiency of protein C, a known risk factor. Concentrations of antithrombin III and factors II and X were significantly lower in protein-C-deficient patients than in those with normal protein C concentrations. These findings suggest that the high thrombotic risk in these patients is caused or at least associated with an imbalance between procoagulant and anticoagulant factors. 
2	Mortality and causes of death in Crohn's disease. Review of 50 years' experience in Leiden University Hospital. Six hundred and seventy one patients (52.5% women) with Crohn's disease seen at Leiden University Hospital between 1934 and 1984 were identified. Follow up was 98.2% complete. Sixty four (9.7%) of the 659 patients died. The cause of death was related to Crohn's disease in 34 patients, probably related to the disease in four, and unrelated, from incidental causes, in 25. The cause of death could not be identified in one patient. There was a significant decrease of deaths related to the disease after 1973. Causes of death such as amyloidosis and malnutrition have disappeared and postoperative deaths have decreased. The standardised mortality ratio showed an excess mortality of 2.23 for all patients. It was higher for women (3.30) than for men (1.76). A comparison of two recent 10 year periods showed a significant decrease in standardised mortality ratio in men but not in women. Patients whose disease started before the age of 20 years had an excess mortality compared with older patients. This study supports the view that the prognosis of Crohn's disease has improved in general but high quality medical and surgical management is important particularly for younger patients. 
4	Primary balloon dilatation of coarctation of the aorta in neonates. Primary balloon dilatation of coarctation of the aorta was attempted in 10 consecutive neonates (age range 2-23 days). The coarctation site was crossed and the balloon inflated in all but one patient. In two patients with associated severe isthmal hypoplasia there was no change in the gradient after dilatation. In the remainder, the residual gradients were trivial and angiography showed complete relief of coarctation. Severe recoarctation developed 5-12 weeks after dilatation in five patients, each considered to have had an excellent initial result. The coarctation was rapidly progressive in three patients in whom Doppler studies within two weeks of the development of recoarctation had shown no significant gradient. In the other two patients progressive restenosis was charted by Doppler examinations over the course of 6-8 weeks. Three patients had a second, initially successful, dilatation procedure. One patient remained well with no residual gradient 18 weeks later. Stenosis recurred within eight weeks in the other two, and both have undergone successful surgical repair. Balloon dilatation of a native coarctation of the aorta gave excellent immediate results in most neonates. Severe isthmal hypoplasia is, however, a contraindication to balloon dilatation and early restenosis is an important problem. These results do not support the continued use of primary balloon dilatation of coarctation of the aorta in neonates. 
5	Detailed examination of complete bioprosthetic heart valves. Six (3 control and 3 explanted) bioprostheses were examined histologically after embedding the complete valve in "plastic" and sectioning across the valve at 90 degree to the horizontal plane, and then horizontally across a stent post, with a low speed saw. The prostheses, porcine or pericardial, had been in place 52 to 121 months. In addition to cusp changes of degeneration and calcification that have been previously reported, the authors found extensive pannus deposition on the cloth covering the inflow surface of the prostheses, with some extension onto the biologic components; evidence of insudation of tissue fluid and ingrowth of fibroblasts; deposition of collagen; and infiltration of mononuclear cells in the interstices and interfaces. Non-biologic components showed changes which may have affected prosthesis function. The synthetic material covering the metal/plastic frame showed interstitial mononuclear cells. Two of the three explanted valves showed changes in the polymeric plastic, and one in the metal components, including accentuated notching along the surfaces when compared to unimplanted prostheses. A larger number of prostheses must be examined before definite conclusions can be drawn. 
5	Radiographic detection of recurrent carious lesions associated with composite restorations. The greatest potential problem associated with posterior composite restoration is secondary caries detection. It is essential that secondary caries is detected as early as possible to enhance the prognosis for a successful treatment outcome. This laboratory study evaluated the optimum level of radiopacity of composite materials for radiographic detection of secondary carious lesions associated with composite materials. Results indicated that for the radiologic detection of secondary caries, it is sufficient for composite materials to have the same level of radiopacity as enamel. 
4	Characterization of auscultatory gaps with wideband external pulse recording. Three types of auscultatory gaps, called G1, G2, and G3, that occur during blood pressure measurement have been identified by using wideband external pulse recording. We have previously shown that the wideband external pulse recorded during cuff deflation can be separated into three components (K1, K2, and K3), one of which (K2) is closely related to the Korotkoff sound. G1 occurs with cuff pressure just below systolic and is characterized by the presence of K1 and K2 with intermittent disappearance of K2. G1 gaps are related to a phasic decrease of arterial (systolic) pressure and were exhibited by 13 of 60 hypertensive patients. G2 gaps are related to a phasic increase of arterial (diastolic) pressure, occur when cuff pressure is just above diastolic, and are characterized by the presence of K1, K2, and K3 with intermittent disappearance of K2. Seven of 60 hypertensive patients exhibited a G2 gap. G3 gaps occur with cuff pressure between systolic and diastolic and are characterized by an underdeveloped or blunted K2 signal. Three of 60 hypertensive patients exhibited a G3 gap. The identification of auscultatory gaps in relation to the wideband external pulse provides a qualitative measure of their existence, can be of significant value in better understanding aspects of the auscultatory blood pressure measurement technique, and provides an objective basis with which to better understand the mechanisms that cause them. 
1	Synergism of ara-C-imuvert combination in aborting the development of transplanted chloroleukemia in the rat. The development of chloroleukemia in the rat after transplantation of C51 chloroma cells can be aborted by treatment with an exogenous source of differentiating activity (DA) or by stimulation of endogenous DA production by the administration of Imuvert, a biologic response modifier. Success or failure of treatment was determined by the ratio of DA to leukemic cell load. Accordingly, in the present study we examined the hypothesis that treatment with cytosine arabinoside (ARA-C) to reduce the leukemic cell load coupled with Imuvert would be more effective than either given alone. Treatment with ARA-C-Imuvert aborted the development of chloroleukemia in 79% of the animals in contrast to 0%, 9% and 45% in animals treated with buffer, ARA-C, or Imuvert respectively. These results suggest that stimulation of endogenous DA in combination with cytoreductive agents offers a potentially curative treatment for myelogenous leukemia. 
5	Choledochotomy for calculous disease in the elderly. To determine the risk of operations on the biliary tract in the elderly, we retrospectively examined 56 patients 80 years of age or older undergoing choledochotomy for calculous disease and compared their outcomes with those of a contemporary group of 257 patients undergoing similar surgery. Thirty of 56 elderly patients (54%) required urgent surgery for acute cholangitis, acute cholecystitis, or obstructive jaundice (serum bilirubin greater than 5 mg/dL), compared with 97 of 257 younger patients (38%) (p = 0.029). Mortality in elderly patients was significantly higher (5 of 56) than in younger (6 of 257) patients (p = 0.015). In three of the five patients who died, urgent surgery was performed for obstructive jaundice, reflecting the higher mortality experienced by jaundiced patients in the entire series (9.4%). Biliary cultures grew organisms in 25 of 27 elderly patients (93%). This is in contrast to findings of bactibilia in 62 of 118 patients (53%) under the age of 80 (p = 0.001). Similarly, preoperative blood cultures were positive more often in elderly (63%) than in younger patients (26%) (p = 0.007). Mean postoperative hospital recovery was longer in the elderly group (16.2 +/- 8.5 days) than in the younger group (12.2 +/- 9.3 days) (p = 0.002). In conclusion, elderly patients, particularly those with obstructive jaundice, are at higher risk for complicated biliary tract disease necessitating choledochotomy. They appear to be more susceptible to bactibilia and bacteremia, and require longer hospital recovery than younger patients. 
4	Clinical evaluation of high-frequency (ultrasonic) mechanical debridement in the surgical treatment of calcific aortic stenosis. Repair of aortic valve stenosis due to calcific degeneration may lead to hemodynamic and clinical improvement without the problems inherent with prosthetic valves. We have evaluated the use of a device capable of debriding calcium, the Cavitron ultrasonic aspirator (CUSA), as an adjunct to mechanical debridement in the repair of calcific aortic stenosis. Ten patients (five women), ages 63 to 83 years, were studied by M-mode, two-dimensional, and Doppler echocardiography before and an average of 26 (range 3 to 124) days after this procedure. The degree of calcification of the valve cusps was clearly reduced. The maximal cusp excursion increased from 0.7 +/- 0.1 cm preoperatively to 1.5 +/- 0.4 cm postoperatively (p = 0.006). The peak aortic gradient fell from 80 +/- 36 mm Hg to 28 +/- 10 mm Hg (p = 0.0007). The mean aortic gradient fell from 53 +/- 20 mm Hg to 16 +/- 5 mm Hg (p less than 0.0001). Aortic valve area calculated by the continuity equation increased from 0.6 + 0.2 cm2 to 1.6 +/- 0.6 cm2 (p = 0.0009). No patient had more than mild aortic insufficiency preoperatively. Postoperatively, color Doppler flow mapping revealed severe aortic insufficiency in two patients. Seven patients had further echocardiographic evaluation 99 (range 33 to 196) days after the procedure. These studies revealed the development of severe aortic insufficiency in an additional four patients. Four patients with severe symptomatic aortic insufficiency eventually underwent aortic valve replacement. Pathology revealed scarring and retraction of the aortic cusps. Widening of the commissures was responsible for the severe aortic insufficiency. 
1	Cisplatin, continuous-infusion 5-fluorouracil, and intermediate-dose methotrexate in the treatment of unresectable non-small cell carcinoma of the lung. Forty-one patients with unresectable non-small cell carcinoma of the lung (NSCCL) were treated with cisplatin 20 mg/m2/d for 5 days as a daily bolus injection, 5-fluorouracil 800 mg/m2/d by continuous infusion for 5 days, and intermediate-dose methotrexate 200 mg/m2 on days 15 and 22 of a 28-day cycle (PFM). One complete and 23 partial responses were observed, yielding an overall response rate of 60%. There was no significant difference in response rates based on histologic subtype or extent of disease (locally unresectable versus metastatic). Median duration of response was 6 months, and the median survival of all patients was 10 months. Two patients with unresectable disease at presentation became resectable after chemotherapy and remain disease-free at 46+ and 53+ months. Toxicity was modest, with oral mucositis the major adverse effect. Clinically important neutropenia was uncommon. PFM is an active regimen in NSCCL and deserves further study in the "neoadjuvant" setting. 
4	Transoesophageal echocardiography improves the diagnostic value of cardiac ultrasound in patients with carcinoid heart disease. Transthoracic and transoesophageal cardiac echocardiography and Doppler investigations were performed in 31 consecutive patients with malignant midgut carcinoid tumours. The transoesophageal images allowed measurement of the thickness of the atrioventricular valve leaflets and the superficial wall layers on the cavity side of both atria. The mean thickness of the anterior tricuspid leaflet was significantly greater than that of the mitral valve--a difference not seen in a control group of age-matched patients without carcinoid tumours and with normal cardiac ultrasound findings. In addition, the edges of the tricuspid leaflets were thickened giving them a clubbed appearance. Tricuspid incompetence was detected transoesophageally in 71% of the patients with carcinoid compared with 57% by transthoracic investigation. The inner layer of the right atrial wall in the carcinoid patients was significantly thicker than that of the left atrium and that of both atria in the controls. Furthermore, patients with other signs of severe carcinoid heart disease had significantly thicker mean right atrial luminal wall layer than those with less or no signs of right heart disease. Transoesophageal cardiac ultrasound investigation improved the diagnostic accuracy and seemed to show the structural changes typical of carcinoid heart disease established by histopathological investigations. 
5	Myocardial magnesium: relation to laboratory and clinical variables in patients undergoing cardiac surgery. Magnesium concentration was measured in the right atrial appendage of 100 patients undergoing cardiac surgery and associations with serum and mononuclear blood cell magnesium, other laboratory values and patient clinical variables were studied. In addition, magnesium was measured in the right atrial appendage and left ventricular free wall in 23 autopsy subjects to determine whether there was a proportional relation between right atrial appendage and left ventricular free wall magnesium. The mean left ventricular free wall/right atrial appendage magnesium ratio was 2.13 +/- 0.39 (r = 0.67, p = 0.0009). In the group with cardiac surgery, the right atrial appendage magnesium concentration correlated inversely with age (r = -0.54, p = 0.001). The mean right atrial appendage magnesium concentration (micrograms/g wet weight tissue) was lower in patients with postoperative cardiac arrhythmia than in those without arrhythmia (103 +/- 13 versus 111 +/- 10, p = 0.009) and in diabetic than in nondiabetic patients (103 +/- 13 versus 109 +/- 12, p = 0.02). The right atrial appendage magnesium concentration also tended to be lower in patients receiving potassium/magnesium-losing diuretics, although this difference did not achieve statistical significance (105 +/- 14 versus 109 +/- 11, p = 0.16). Right atrial appendage magnesium concentration correlated positively with serum creatinine concentration (r = 0.31, p = 0.002) and negatively with serum calcium concentration (r = -0.29, p = 0.013). Serum magnesium did not correlate with right atrial appendage or mononuclear blood cell magnesium concentration or clinical variables. There was a statistically significant correlation between mononuclear blood cell and right atrial appendage magnesium concentrations in some subgroups of patients. 
5	Morphological observations late (greater than 30 days) after clinically successful coronary balloon angioplasty. This report describes clinical, morphological, and histological findings late (1.6-24.1 months [average, 8.2 months]) after clinically successful coronary balloon angioplasty in 20 necropsied patients with coronary angioplasty restenosis. Clinical evidence of restenosis occurred in 14 (70%) of patients, including six patients with sudden coronary death. Of the 20 patients, 14 (70%) had cardiac causes of death and six (30%) had noncardiac causes of death. Two major subgroups of histological findings were observed: 1) intimal proliferation (60%) and 2) atherosclerotic plaques only. Of the eight sites with atherosclerotic plaques only, six were eccentric lesions and two were concentric lesions. No morphological evidence of previous angioplasty injury (cracks, breaks, or tears) was observed in the eight patients with atherosclerotic plaques only. Proposed mechanisms for the development of intimal proliferation involve the reaction of smooth muscle cells and platelets, whereas elastic recoil of overstretched eccentric or concentric atherosclerotic lesions represents the most likely explanation for the findings in the latter subgroup. On the basis of these morphological findings at angioplasty restenosis sites, specific treatment strategies for coronary artery balloon angioplasty restenosis are proposed. 
4	Torsade de pointes: a critical care nurse's dilemma. Torsade de pointes is a polymorphous ventricular tachycardia characterized by a gradual change in the direction of the QRS complex. Because critical care nurses are the first to recognize arrhythmias, they require the knowledge and skill to intervene appropriately. This case report focuses on identification of the characteristics, contributing factors, therapeutic modalities, and relevant nursing diagnoses for the patient with torsade de pointes. 
5	The effect of intravenous fixed-dose heparin during total hip arthroplasty on the incidence of deep-vein thrombosis. A randomized, double-blind trial in patients operated on with epidural anesthesia and controlled hypotension. Heparin was given in fixed doses intravenously during unilateral primary total hip-replacement operations in a prospective, double-blind trial to assess the effect on the incidence of deep-vein thrombosis. One hundred and fifty patients were randomly assigned to one of two groups before the operation. Twenty-four patients were excluded from the study, leaving 126 patients. Group I consisted of sixty-six patients who received saline solution intravenously, and Group II comprised sixty patients who received heparin. All patients had epidural anesthesia with controlled hypotension. Fixed doses of heparin were administered five minutes before the operative incision was made and every thirty minutes throughout the operation. Mean arterial pressures were maintained at between fifty and sixty millimeters of mercury in all patients. Ascending venography was done on the seventh day after the operation. The incidence of deep-vein thrombosis was 24 per cent (sixteen of sixty-six patients) in Group I and 8 per cent (five of sixty patients) in Group II; the difference is significant (p = 0.03). The intraoperative loss of blood averaged 220 +/- 79 milliliters in Group I compared with 269 +/- 109 milliliters in Group II. An average of less than one unit of blood was transfused for each patient in each group. Postoperatively, there was no difference between the groups with regard to the amount of drainage that was collected in a Hemovac device or the values for hematocrit. 
4	The role of calcium channel blockers in the treatment of essential hypertension. Calcium channel blockers, originally developed for the treatment of angina and supraventricular arrhythmias, have been shown to lower elevated blood pressure effectively in hypertensive patients. Verapamil, nifedipine, and diltiazem represent prototype compounds for unique chemical classes with differing pharmacologic properties. These drugs lower elevated blood pressure with efficacy comparable with other commonly used antihypertensives. Combination therapy with other agents usually results in an additive response. Side effects are usually mild and reversible and usually are an extension of the drug's pharmacologic effects. Moreover, adverse metabolic effects on lipid, glucose, or potassium levels are not common. Because of the excellent antihypertensive effects of calcium channel blockers and their potential importance in a variety of other disease states, these agents should be routinely considered for use as a first-line antihypertensive agent in appropriately selected patients with hypertension of any severity as part of a comprehensive plan to minimize cardiovascular risk. 
4	Isolation of preferentially expressed genes in the kidneys of hypertensive rats. By differential hybridization, three complementary DNAs designated as S3, S2, and SA were isolated, and the corresponding messenger RNAs (mRNAs) were differentially expressed between the kidneys of spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) and normotensive Wistar-Kyoto (WKY) rats. S3 is identical to cytochrome P450 IV A2. SA encoded a protein of 546 amino acid residues, and its carboxyl terminal region had a slight homology to luciferase. No homologous sequence has been reported in S2 sequences. S3 mRNA was about four times more abundantly expressed in the kidneys of 28-day-old SHR than in those of age-matched WKY rats, but there was no difference at age 16 weeks. A low NaCl diet positively modulated the expression of the S3 gene. S2 mRNA was almost undetectable in the kidneys of 28-day-old WKY rats but was clearly detected in those of age-matched SHR. The expression level of S2 mRNA in the livers of 16-week-old SHR was about five times higher than that of age-matched WKY rats. The expression of S2 mRNA in the livers was modulated by dietary NaCl and captopril. SA mRNA was more than 10 times more abundantly expressed in the kidneys of SHR than in those of WKY rats from age 4 weeks. With the administration of captopril, the expressions of SA mRNA in the livers of SHR were positively modulated. Because these three genes are not only differentially expressed between SHR and WKY rats but also related to sodium metabolism or blood pressure control, the identification of these genes may provide important probes to examine the mechanisms of hypertension. 
4	Coronary collateral circulation in coronary artery disease and systemic hypertension. The extent and functional capacity of coronary collateral circulation in patients with systemic hypertension has not been elucidated. In the present study, 313 patients with coronary artery disease were studied to evaluate coronary collateral circulation in relation to the presence of systemic hypertension and left ventricular hypertrophy. Patients had greater than or equal to 95% diameter luminal obstruction of either the left anterior descending or the right coronary artery. Patients were classified into 2 groups: The hypertensive group consisted of 61 patients, mean age 55 +/- 9 years, with systemic hypertension, and the normotensive group consisted of 252 patients, mean age 53 +/- 8 years, without hypertension. The hypertensive group had more severe angina pectoris and less history of healed myocardial infarction than the normotensive group (p less than 0.001). Left ventricular wall thickness was 1.26 +/- 0.1 cm in the hypertensive and 1.03 +/- 0.06 cm in the normotensive group (p less than 0.001). The hypertensive group had more extensive coronary collateral circulation than the normotensive group (p less than 0.01). There was a positive relation between coronary collateral circulation and left ventricular wall thickness (p less than 0.001). These results indicate that patients with systemic hypertension and coronary artery disease have an increase in coronary collateral circulation corresponding to the degree of left ventricular wall thickness. 
3	Substance abuse and cerebral blood flow. OBJECTIVE AND METHOD: This paper reviews acute and chronic effects of drugs of abuse on cerebral blood flow (CBF) and metabolism and their clinical significance. The most important source of information for the review is human research reports published in refereed journals. A few animal studies, book chapters, and abstracts that are especially relevant are also included. RESULTS: In humans, ethanol in small doses produces cerebral vasodilation; higher doses induce cerebral vasoconstriction. Chronic alcoholism is associated with reduced CBF and cerebral metabolism. Sedatives and antianxiety drugs lead to global reduction in CBF and cerebral metabolism. Caffeine, even in small doses, is a potent cerebral vasoconstrictor. Cerebral vasodilation is seen immediately after cigarette smoking, but chronic smokers show global reduction in CBF. Changes in CBF after marijuana smoking are variable; both increases and decreases are seen. Chronic marijuana smoking, however, seems to reduce CBF. Most inhalants and solvents are vasodilators; chronic abuse is accompanied by a decrease in CBF. A number of drugs of abuse, including ethanol, amphetamines, cocaine, nicotine, and caffeine-phenylpropanolamine combinations, increase the risk for stroke. Reduction in CBF associated with chronic use of ethanol, nicotine, inhalants, and solvents is at least partially reversible upon abstinence. CONCLUSIONS: Topics for future research include regional brain function, which mediates drug-induced mood changes (euphoria); CBF concomitants of psychological and physiological characteristics that increase addiction potential; changes in CBF that accompany withdrawal syndromes; mechanisms responsible for drug-induced stroke; and effects of functional and organic complications on CBF. 
4	Results and complications of angioplasty in aortoiliac disease Percutaneous transluminal angioplasty was used to treat 340 aortoiliac lesions in 200 patients who were followed for as long as 90 months (mean, 28.7 months; median, 23 months). The initial success rate was 94.7% for lesions and 93.0% for patients. The indications for percutaneous transluminal angioplasty included claudication in 117 patients (58.5%), rest pain or ischemic night pain in 47 (23.5%), limb salvage in 33 (16.5%), and aiding in wound healing in three (1.5%). In the series, 70% of the patients had two or more cardiovascular risk factors. Angioplasty was initially unsuccessful in 14 patients, and 10 patients were lost to follow-up. Follow-up was obtained in 176 patients. The long-term results were analyzed using the life table method to determine cumulative patency. Fourteen patients were considered failures because of recurrent disease or symptoms. The projected 7.5-year cumulative patency rate was 85%. When the response to redilatation was considered, the projected 7.5-year cumulative patency rate was 92%. The results indicate that percutaneous transluminal angioplasty can successfully correct aortoiliac lesions and provide a long-term benefit for as long as 7.5 years. 
1	Effects of hepatitis B virus, alcohol drinking, cigarette smoking and familial tendency on hepatocellular carcinoma. Independent and interactive effects related to the development of hepatocellular carcinoma were assessed using a community-based case-control study for hepatitis B virus, habitual alcohol drinking, cigarette smoking, peanut consumption and history of hepatocellular carcinoma among the immediate family. All 200 male newly diagnosed hepatocellular carcinoma patients were recruited consecutively through the period of study as the case group from two teaching medical centers in northern and southern Taiwan. Healthy community residents matched one-to-one with cases on age, sex, ethnic group and residential area were selected as the control group. The carrier status of HBsAg and HBeAg was determined by blind radioimmunoassays, and other risk factors were obtained through standardized interviews according to a structured questionnaire. Conditional logistic regression analysis showed a significant association between hepatocellular carcinoma and the carrier status of HBsAg and HBeAg with an odds ratio of 16.7 and 56.5, respectively, for carriers of HBsAg alone and for carriers of both HBsAg and HBeAg. There was a dose-response relationship between cigarette smoking and hepatocellular carcinoma with an odds ratio of 1.1, 1.5 and 2.6, respectively, for those who smoked 1 to 10, 11 to 20 and more than 20 cigarettes a day. A significant association with hepatocellular carcinoma was also observed for the habitual alcohol consumer with an odds ratio of 3.4. Those whose immediate family had a history of hepatocellular carcinoma were more likely to have the disease develop, with an odds ratio of 4.6. However, the frequency of peanut consumption was not significantly associated with hepatocellular carcinoma. 
3	'Locked-in syndrome' for 27 years following a viral illness: clinical and pathologic findings. We describe a man who, after a presumed encephalitic illness, was "locked-in" for 27 years. His CT and autopsy findings showed atrophy of the brainstem and a cystic lesion at the base of the pons. He survived longer than most other patients in a similar state. 
5	Radiotherapy alone versus combined chemotherapy and radiotherapy in nonresectable non-small-cell lung cancer: first analysis of a randomized trial in 353 patients. We report the results observed in a large, randomized study that compared the effects of radiotherapy alone (the standard therapy) with those of a combination of radiotherapy and chemotherapy in nonresectable squamous cell and large-cell lung carcinoma. The radiation dose was 65 Gy in each group, and chemotherapy included vindesine, cyclophosphamide, cisplatin, and lomustine. In this study, 177 patients received radiotherapy alone (group A), and 176 patients received the combined treatment (group B). The 2-year survival rate was 14% in group A and 21% in group B (P = .08). The distant metastasis rate was significantly lower in group B (P less than .001). Local control was poor in both groups (17% and 15%, respectively) and remained the major problem. 
4	Evidence for tumor necrosis factor-induced pulmonary microvascular injury after intestinal ischemia-reperfusion injury. Acute lung injury characterized by increased microvascular permeability is one feature of multiple-organ system failure and the adult respiratory distress syndrome. Intestinal ischemia-reperfusion injury has been linked to this type of acute lung injury. The purpose of these experiments was to examine the pathogenic mediators that link the two processes, with particular emphasis on the roles of endotoxin and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF alpha). Previously described characteristics of the acute lung injury in this rat model of intestinal ischemia-reperfusion include pulmonary neutrophil sequestration, depletion of lung tissue ATP, alveolar endothelial cell disruption, and increased microvascular permeability. Plasma levels of TNF in the systemic circulation of sham-operated animals and those with intestinal ischemic injury less than 60 minutes in duration were very low or undetectable. Intestinal ischemia for 120 minutes was associated with TNF elevation to 1.19 +/- 0.50 U/mL. Reperfusion for periods of 15 and 30 minutes generated 5- to 10-fold increases in circulating TNF levels (6.61 +/- 3.11 U/mL, p greater than 0.05 and 10.41 +/- 5.41 U/mL, p = 0.004 compared to sham); however this increase in circulating TNF was transient and largely cleared within 60 minutes after initiating reperfusion. Portal vein endotoxin levels were found to increase significantly before the appearance of TNF in systemic plasma, suggesting that gut-derived endotoxin may induce TNF release from hepatic macrophages into the systemic circulation. Anti-TNF antibody attenuated the increase in pulmonary microvascular permeability in this preparation but did not prevent pulmonary neutrophil sequestration. These observations suggest that endotoxin and TNF have pathogenic roles in this acute lung injury, but that mechanisms of adherence of neutrophils to endothelial cells independent of TNF may be involved. The accumulation of neutrophils in the lung but the prevention of a vascular permeability increase in the presence of antibody to TNF may imply an in vivo role for TNF in the process of neutrophil activation. These studies provide additional evidence of the importance of the endogenous inflammatory mediators in the development of systemic injury in response to local tissue injury. 
5	Adenovirus colitis in the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome. Adenovirus was identified in colonic tissue by transmission electron microscopy or culture in 5 of 67 (7.4%) homosexual men seropositive for human immunodeficiency virus (51 with the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome) with diarrhea. Colonoscopy showed the mucosa to be normal in 3 cases and mildly inflamed in 2. Light microscopy showed foci of mucosal necrosis that contained chronic inflammatory cells and degenerating and necrotic epithelial cells with amphophilic nuclear inclusions. By transmission electron microscopy, hexagonal viral particles characteristic of adenovirus were identified within the inclusions. Only 1 patient was concomitantly infected by a second potential enteric pathogen. It was concluded that adenovirus, an uncommon enteric pathogen in immunocompetent adults, causes intestinal pathology and may be associated with diarrheal illness in persons with the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome. 
2	Towards a true prevalence of peptic ulcer: the Sorreisa gastrointestinal disorder study. This study, designed to overcome methodological problems inherent in earlier prevalence studies of peptic ulcer, was carried out in a municipality in northern Norway. It included the total population of 2027, aged 20-69 years, and comprised a questionnaire and search for previously diagnosed peptic ulcers in the local medical records for all subjects, and additional endoscopy of all subjects with dyspepsia and their matched healthy controls (n = 619). The overall prevalence was 10.5% in men and 9.5% in women, a sex ratio close to one and a higher duodenal:gastric ratio than previously reported from this region. A substantial 1% prevalence of asymptomatic ulcers was also observed. 
5	The clinical significance of fluid collections in acute pancreatitis. Computed tomography (CT) displays fluid collections in patients with acute pancreatitis as well defined intra- or extrapancreatic homogeneous areas with low attenuation numbers. We followed, prospectively, the clinical courses of 128 patients who had CT during an episode of acute pancreatitis, to determine the natural history and clinical significance of any fluid collections that developed. Fluid collections were found in 48 (37%) of the 128 patients with pancreatitis. Thirty-eight developed in the 86 (44%) patients with alcoholic pancreatitis, five in the 33 (15%) with biliary pancreatitis and five in the nine (55%) with other causes of pancreatitis (excluding chronic pancreatitis, trauma, or malignancy). On clinical follow-up of the 48 patients with fluid collections, 21 patients required operation; two died before an operation was done and 25 did not require operation. Operations were done to treat pseudocysts (14), abscess (5), and necrosis (3). One patient had an operation for a pseudocyst and an abscess. All 14 patients requiring operation for pseudocyst had collections greater than 7 cm and 13 of these patients had alcoholic pancreatitis. Of the 25 patients not requiring operation, five were lost to follow-up, and 19 of the 20 who had spontaneous resolution of their fluid collection(s) had collections less than 6 cm in diameter. The eight patients who required operative pancreatic debridement for abscess or necrosis had multiple small fluid collections. In summary, fluid collections were found in one-third of patients with acute pancreatitis and were often associated with the development of local complications. 
5	CD34 antigen expression in children with Philadelphia chromosome-positive acute lymphoblastic leukemia. One characteristic of Philadelphia chromosome (Ph')-positive acute leukemia is the occasional presence of both lymphoid and myeloid features in the same leukemia. This phenomenon supports the theory that this subtype of acute leukemia arises from lymphoid-myeloid stem cell, pluripotent progenitors. Very few reports, however, describe the immunophenotype, especially CD34 antigen, of Ph'-positive acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). It has been shown that CD34, the human progenitor cell antigen, is found on 1% or less of normal human bone marrow cells, approximately 30% of acute leukemias, and multipotent progenitor cells; CD34 is not found on normal peripheral blood cells. A high frequency of CD34 expression was found in children with Ph'-positive ALL: CD34 was positive for all six patients tested, and one had an acute mixed-lineage leukemia. These findings suggest the involvement of a pluripotent stem cell in Ph'-positive ALL. 
1	Dysplasia and DNA aneuploidy in a pelvic pouch. Report of a case. A patient with an 18-year history of ulcerative colitis was operated on with colectomy, mucosal proctectomy, ileoanal anastomosis, and an S-type pelvic pouch due to intractable chronic continuous disease. The patient was followed by endoscopic controls and biopsy sampling from the pouch at regular intervals. A gradual development of severe atrophy in the ileal mucosa was followed by the development of low grade dysplasia. At the most recent endoscopic control, 4 years after the construction of the pouch, biopsies were sampled also for flow cytometric DNA analyses. DNA aneuploidy was detected in a biopsy from the center of the pouch, and a biopsy taken immediately adjacent showed low grade dysplasia. These findings underline the importance of endoscopic follow-up after construction of a pelvic pouch and focus attention to the potential of malignant transformation of the mucosa. 
5	Round fingerpad sign: an early sign of scleroderma. We describe a clinical skin sign in scleroderma termed round fingerpad sign. This term refers to disappearance of the peaked contour on fingerpads and replacement with a hemisphere-like fingertip contour; this change is especially apparent on the ring fingers. A positive round fingerpad sign was found in 72 of 72 ring fingers in 36 patients with progressive systemic sclerosis in 69 of 72 ring fingers in patients with mixed connective tissue disease, and in 24 of 24 ring fingers of patients with Raynaud's phenomenon and sclerodactyly. In contrast, a negative round fingerpad sign was seen in 240 of 240 fingers in normal women (controls). The high sensitivity of this sign is noteworthy. A positive round fingerpad was seen in sign not only typical scleroderma patients but also in groups with less severe skin sclerosis (i.e., in those patients with mixed connective tissue disease or those with Raynaud's phenomenon and sclerodactyly). The sign is a new and useful clinical marker for the early diagnosis of scleroderma. 
4	Which drug prevents tachycardia and hypertension associated with tracheal intubation: lidocaine, fentanyl, or esmolol? Eighty patients, ASA physical status II-IV, scheduled for noncardiac surgery, were randomly assigned in a double-blind, placebo-controlled manner to receive a preintubation dose of either placebo, 200 mg lidocaine, 200 micrograms fentanyl, or 150 mg esmolol. Induction of anesthesia was accomplished with 4-6 mg/kg thiopental IV followed immediately by the study drug; 1-1.5 mg/kg succinylcholine was given at minute 1. Laryngoscopy and intubation were performed at minute 2 with anesthesia thereafter maintained with 1 MAC (+/- 10%) isoflurane in 60% nitrous oxide in oxygen at a 5 L/min flow for 10 min. Heart rate was recorded every 15 s and blood pressure every minute from induction until 10 min after intubation. Maximum percent increases in heart rate (mean +/- SE) during and after intubation were similar in the placebo (44% +/- 6%), lidocaine (51% +/- 10%), and fentanyl (37% +/- 5%) groups, but lower in the esmolol (18% +/- 5%) group (P less than 0.05). Maximum systolic blood pressure percent increases were lower in the lidocaine (20% +/- 6%), fentanyl (12% +/- 3%), and esmolol (19% +/- 4%) groups than in the placebo (36% +/- 5%) group (P less than 0.05), but not different from each other (P greater than 0.05). Only esmolol provided consistent and reliable protection against increases in both heart rate and systolic blood pressure accompanying laryngoscopy and intubation. 
5	Systemic pattern of free radical generation during coronary bypass surgery. Diffuse impairment of ventricular function after cardiac surgery may be related to the generation during reperfusion of the myocardium of free radicals derived from oxygen. Fifteen patients undergoing elective coronary bypass surgery were studied by previously described assays for peroxidised lipids and for isomerised lipids which were used as indices of free radical activity. Serial blood samples were obtained from systemic arterial, mixed venous, and coronary sinus catheters before, during, and after the ischaemic period. The patients underwent coronary artery surgery on cardiopulmonary bypass with a membrane oxygenator, relative hypothermia 30-34 degrees C, and intermittent cross-clamping of the aorta. During the ischaemic periods there were no significant changes in the indices of free radical activity. During the reperfusion phase there was a significant increase in free radical indices in arterial and mixed venous blood. A small rise in free radical indices in coronary venous blood was not statistically significant. These data indicate that free radical activity is increased in patients shortly after the cessation of cardiopulmonary bypass. The pattern of distribution between the different sampling sites suggests that much of the observed increase in isomerised and peroxidised lipids originates from tissues other than the myocardium. 
2	The human hepatic asialoglycoprotein receptor is a target antigen for liver-infiltrating T cells in autoimmune chronic active hepatitis and primary biliary cirrhosis. Autoantibodies to the human hepatic asialoglycoprotein receptor have been found in nearly 50% of the sera of patients with autoimmune chronic active hepatitis and in 15% of patients with primary biliary cirrhosis. In this study we demonstrate that the human hepatic asialoglycoprotein receptor is also a target antigen for T cell-mediated immune responses. Peripheral blood lymphocytes of 37% (7 of 19) of patients with autoimmune chronic active hepatitis and 33% (2 of 6) of patients with primary biliary cirrhosis showed a proliferative response to highly purified human hepatic asialoglycoprotein receptor, whereas no proliferation was found with peripheral blood lymphocytes of patients with chronic viral hepatitis (0 of 13) and healthy blood donors (0 of 4). Moreover, we isolated T-cell clones from liver biopsy samples of two patients with autoimmune chronic active hepatitis and two patients with peripheral blood lymphocytes. Between 2.8% and 14.3% of these clones showed a specific proliferative response to purified human hepatic asialoglycoprotein receptor. The response was restricted to autologous antigen-presenting cells and could be blocked by monoclonal antibodies against human leukocyte antigen-DR molecules. The response of T cells to the human hepatic asialoglycoprotein receptor did not require the lectinlike activity of the asialoglycoprotein receptor. Thus the human hepatic asialoglycoprotein receptor could be identified as a major target antigen of humoral and cellular immune reactions in autoimmune-mediated liver diseases. 
2	Elevated intracranial pressure and computed tomography of the brain in fulminant hepatocellular failure. Cerebral herniation is a leading cause of death in patients with fulminant hepatocellular failure. Classical signs of elevated intracranial pressure are often absent in these patients. A reliable noninvasive method by which the presence of cerebral edema could be determined is much needed. To assess the efficacy of computed tomography of the brain in this setting, we compared the radiographic findings to the intracranial pressure measured by an epidural monitor in patients with fulminant hepatic failure. Unfortunately, a considerable difference existed between the presence of cerebral edema diagnosed by computed tomography of the brain and elevation of the intracranial pressure. Our observations suggest that in patients with fulminant hepatic failure and advanced hepatic encephalopathy, computed tomography of the brain is of little value in detecting cerebral edema. Pressure monitoring is most important to establish the presence and guide the therapy of intracranial hypertension. 
5	Hemicorporectomy: a collective review. Hemicorporectomy or translumbar amputation has been described as the most revolutionary of all operative procedures. Frederick E. Kredel, who first voiced the concept of the operation in 1950, referred to it as halfectomy. Demonstration of his cadaver studies established the feasibility of the operation. Amputation is effected through the lower lumbar area of the body. Necessary life functions are preserved in the upper torso. Kredel envisioned hemicorporectomy as a curative operation for locally advanced cancer, limited to the pelvis, not encompassable by standard operative intervention. Additional indications are intractable decubitus ulcers with malignant change, particularly in paraplegics; pelvic organs, and bone infection with nonhealing fistulae; and crushing trauma to the pelvis. The first hemicorporectomy operation was reported in 1960. Thirty-four operations have been recorded in the world literature. Two heretofore unreported cases are added, raising the total to 36. Review of these 36 cases confirms the conviction that hemicorporectomy is a humane and ethical alternative to the suffering encumbered by advancing, painful, malodorous malignant disease not treatable by conventional means. While cure rates are not substantial, the best results are reported in paraplegics with intractable decubitus ulcers with or without malignancy. Rehabilitation is prolonged and costly. Most survivors have been restored to preoperative occupations or other gainful employment. 
3	Tay-Sachs disease in Moroccan Jews: deletion of a phenylalanine in the alpha-subunit of beta-hexosaminidase. Tay-Sachs disease is an inherited lysosomal storage disorder caused by defects in the beta-hexosaminidase alpha-subunit gene. The carrier frequency for Tay-Sachs disease is significantly elevated in both the Ashkenazi Jewish and Moroccan Jewish populations but not in other Jewish groups. We have found that the mutations underlying Tay-Sachs disease in Ashkenazi and Moroccan Jews are different. Analysis of a Moroccan Jewish Tay-Sachs patient had revealed an in-frame deletion (delta F) of one of the two adjacent phenylalanine codons that are present at positions 304 and 305 in the alpha-subunit sequence. The mutation impairs the subunit assembly of beta-hexosaminidase A, resulting in an absence of enzyme activity. The Moroccan patient was found also to carry, in the other alpha-subunit allele, a different, and as yet unidentified, mutation which causes a deficit of mRNA. Analysis of obligate carriers from six unrelated Moroccan Jewish families showed that three harbor the delta F mutation, raising the possibility that this defect may be a prevalent mutation in this ethnic group. 
5	Effect of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation on survival of infants with congenital diaphragmatic hernia. To determine the effect of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) on the survival of infants with congenital diaphragmatic hernia, we undertook a retrospective review of 31 infants with congenital diaphragmatic hernia treated at Children's National Medical Center. Infants were categorized by means of the Bohn quadrant analysis to determine the impact of ECMO on infants with congenital diaphragmatic hernia and a "poor prognosis." All infants assigned to the Bohn 100% mortality quadrant required ECMO. The survival rate in this group was 86% (6/7) when assessed preoperatively and 67% (6/9) when assessed postoperatively. Comparison of the change occurring in ventilation index and arterial carbon dioxide pressure demonstrated that after repair the clinical condition of 48% of infants deteriorated, 40% improved, and 12% remained unchanged. Of the 12 infants whose condition was worse after surgery, 11 eventually required ECMO. Our review demonstrates that ECMO improved survival significantly in infants with congenital diaphragmatic hernia who had a "poor prognosis" by the criteria of Bohn et al. We recommend consideration of ECMO for all infants with congenital diaphragmatic hernia for whom maximal medical therapy has failed. 
2	Bronchial asthma and acid reflux into the distal and proximal oesophagus. The prevalence of pathological gastro-oesophageal reflux in children and adolescents with asthma was studied by 24 hour two level oesophageal pH monitoring in 42 subjects aged 9-20 years with moderate or severe bronchial asthma. The importance of oesophagobronchial nerve reflexes and of aspiration of gastric acid as triggers in asthma was assessed by studying whether episodes of reflux into the distal and into the proximal oesophagus were followed by asthma attacks. Twenty-one subjects (50%) had a pathological total reflux time in the distal oesophagus and six (16%) in the proximal oesophagus. Nine patients had pathological gastro-oesophageal reflux into the distal oesophagus together with symptoms of asthma during the day on which the recording took place. In three of them the episodes of asthma symptoms were significantly correlated with preceding episodes of reflux into the distal oesophagus, and in one subject to reflux into the proximal oesophagus. We conclude that pathological gastro-oesophageal reflux is common in children and adolescents with asthma, but it seems to provoke symptoms of asthma in only a few. Symptoms of asthma were more often elicited by exposure of the distal oesophagus to gastric acid, possibly by a vagal reflex, than by aspiration of gastric juice. 
3	Substantia nigra: a site of action of muscle relaxant drugs. Sites of action of centrally active muscle relaxant drugs are not well defined. Clinical experience with such drugs suggests that the spinal cord may be one of the important regions from which pathologically increased muscle tone may be relieved. Supraspinal centers that may also be involved in the expression of muscle relaxant action have not yet been defined. We report here that microinjections of therapeutically relevant muscle relaxants into the midbrain tegmentum of genetically spastic rats decrease muscle tone. The substantia nigra is the region from which midazolam, baclofen, and tizanidine (drugs used clinically in the treatment of spasticity), or gamma-vinyl-GABA, (-)-2-amino-7-phosphonoheptanoate, and [D-pro2-D-phe7-D-trp9]-substance P (experimental drugs active in animal models of spasticity), reduce muscle tone in genetically spastic rats and Hoffmann reflexes in normal rats. The effects of muscle relaxant drugs are topographically restricted to the substantia nigra pars reticulata and are receptor specific. These observations disclose a previously unknown function of the substantia nigra in mediating muscle relaxation. 
1	Cancer incidence among foundry workers in Denmark. Cancer incidence was studied among 6,144 male foundry workers who were invited to participate in either of two Danish national silicosis surveys conducted during 1967-1969 and 1972-1974. Cancer incidence was followed through to the end of 1985 by computerized linkage to the Danish Cancer Registry, and Standardized Morbidity Ratios (SMRs) were calculated based on incidence rates for the Danish population. For the entire cohort, significantly elevated SMRs were seen for all cancers (SMR, 1.09; 95% CI, 1.01-1.18) and lung cancer (SMR, 1.30; 95% CI, 1.12-1.51), and SMRs were at the borderline of statistical significance for bladder cancer (SMR, 1.24; 95% CI, 0.97-1.59). Excess lung and bladder cancer risk were confined to workers who had worked in foundries for at least 20 y. There was a positive correlation between silicosis prevalence in employees at the foundries at the time of the x-ray examinations and lung cancer incidence during the follow-up period. Squamous cell carcinomas, anaplastic carcinomas, and other lung cancers accounted for the excess lung cancer risk, whereas there was not excess risk among the foundry workers for adenocarcinomas of the lung. 
5	Comparison of pulse oximeters: accuracy at low arterial pressure in volunteers. A laboratory model was developed of limb hypoperfusion in volunteers, using parital occlusion of the brachial artery with consequent reduction in radial artery pulse pressure. This was used to compare the function of 13 pulse oximeters and the effect of reduced pulse pressure and mild hypoxia on these devices. With the exception of one device, all the pulse oximeters studied demonstrated similar accuracies at pulse pressures exceeding 20 mm Hg. There were however, significant differences between several of the pulse oximeters in both ability to display readings and accuracy of readings displayed when brachial artery occlusion reduced radial artery pulse pressures equal to or less than 20 mm Hg. 
1	Xeroderma pigmentosum: review and report of a case. Xeroderma pigmentosum is a rare inherited dermatosis that provides insight into the basic mechanism of carcinogenesis. It is a model disorder linking defective DNA repair with clinical abnormalities and neoplasia. UV light-induced damage to the skin begins early and results in multiple benign and malignant skin tumors, especially in sun-exposed areas of the head and neck. Oral cancers, primarily squamous cell carcinomas of the anterior third of the tongue, occur with greatly increased frequency. A patient with multiple facial neoplasia and oral manifestations of xeroderma pigmentosum is presented. The role of the dentist in surveillance of oral and perioral structures is emphasized. The dentist is advised against the use of UV light-curing units in these patients because UV-induced epithelial damage may cause dysplasia when DNA repair mechanisms are dysfunctional. 
4	Carotid-cavernous sinus fistula associated with a primitive trigeminal artery. Carotid-cavernous sinus fistulas are not rare, but they have never been reported in association with persistent primitive trigeminal artery. We recently encountered such a case. The Jaeger-Hamby procedure was employed, with mandatory occlusion of the primitive trigeminal artery. 
1	LDH isoenzymes in cerebrospinal fluid in various brain tumours. This study examined the isoenzymatic pattern of LDH in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) as well as the ratio between the five fractions of LDH among patients with various brain tumours, carcinomatous meningitis and control groups. LDH 1/LDH 2 less than 1 was found significant for carcinomatous meningitis (p less than 0.001) and brain metastases (p less than 0.001). LDH 1/LDH 2 ratio was found to be significantly lower in carcinomatous meningitis than in brain metastases (p less than 0.05). No LDH 1/LDH 2 ratios smaller than 1 were found in the other groups. The LDH 1/LDH 2 ratio smaller than 1 was found in the early stage of carcinomatous meningitis without other evidences of the involvement of the leptomeninges. Examination of LDH 1/LDH 2 can be found as an adjunctive method to identify brain metastases and carcinomatous meningitis at the initial stage. 
2	Radiation-induced proctosigmoiditis. Prospective, randomized, double-blind controlled trial of oral sulfasalazine plus rectal steroids versus rectal sucralfate. In a prospective study, 37 consecutive patients with radiation-induced proctosigmoiditis were randomized to receive a four-week course of either 3.0 g oral sulfasalazine plus 20 mg twice daily rectal prednisolone enemas (group I, N = 18) or 2.0 g twice daily rectal sucralfate enemas plus oral placebo (group II, N = 19). The two groups were comparable with respect to demographic features, duration of symptoms, and clinical and endoscopic staging of the disease. Fifteen patients in group I and 17 in group II completed the trial. At four weeks, both groups showed significant clinical improvement (P less than 0.01 for group I and P less than 0.001 for group II) and endoscopic healing (P less than 0.01 for group I and P less than 0.001 for group II). When the two groups were compared, sucralfate enemas showed a significantly better response as assessed clinically (P less than 0.05), although endoscopically the response was not statistically different (P greater than 0.05). We conclude that both treatment regimens are effective in the management of radiation proctitis. Sucralfate enemas give a better clinical response, are tolerated better, and because of the lower cost should be the preferred mode of short-term treatment. 
5	Progression from lymphoid hyperplasia to high-grade malignant lymphoma in mice transgenic for the t(14; 18). Follicular lymphoma, the most common human lymphoma, characteristically has a t(14; 18) interchromosomal translocation. It is typically an indolent disease comprised of small resting B cells, but frequently develops into a high-grade lymphoma. The t(14; 18) translocates the Bcl-2 gene, generating a deregulated Bcl-2-immunoglobulin fusion gene. Bcl-2 is a novel inner mitochondrial membrane protein that extends the survival of certain cells by blocking programmed cell death. To determine the oncogenic potential of the t(14; 18) translocation, we produced transgenic mice bearing a Bcl-2-immunoglobulin minigene that structurally mimicked the t(14; 18). An indolent follicular hyperplasia in these transgenic mice progressed to a malignant diffuse large-cell lymphoma. The long latency, progression from polyclonal to monoclonal disease, and histological conversion, are all suggestive of secondary changes. Half of the immunoblastic high-grade lymphomas had a rearranged c-myc gene. Our transgenic mice provide an animal model for tumour progression in t(14; 18) lymphoma and show that prolonged B-cell life increases tumour incidence. 
1	Cancer antigen 125, carcinoembryonic antigen, and carbohydrate determinant 19-9 in ovarian tumors. The authors studied data of combination assays of tumor markers, because simultaneous elevation of different types of tumor markers in the serum was puzzling. They interpreted such phenomena regarding cancer antigen 125, carcinoembryonic antigen, and carbohydrate determinant 19-9 in ovarian tumors. The tissue expression of the antigens was compared with preoperative serum levels. Several different factors were found to cause the simultaneous elevation of two or three of these markers in the serum. Furthermore, even when the levels of some of the tumor markers were raised in the serum, the ovarian tumor did not always produce the marker by itself. This study indicates that immunohistochemical identification of a marker in tumor tissue is prerequisite to the use of that marker in the serum to monitor disease status. 
4	Thromboembolism. A complication of weekly chemotherapy in the treatment of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. In a retrospective survey of 85 patients who received chemotherapy as treatment for non-Hodgkin's lymphomas, the authors found that clinically apparent thromboembolic disorders occurred in four of 11 patients receiving weekly chemotherapy, and in none of 74 patients who were treated on less intensive schedules, suggesting that intensive weekly chemotherapy is thrombogenic. The possible mechanisms of this effect are discussed. 
5	European experience with itraconazole in systemic mycoses. Since January 1985 more than 100 patients with deep fungal infections have been treated with itraconazole (200 to 400 mg/day) in Northern Italy. Evaluation of the drug efficacy and tolerance was possible in one patient with sporotrichosis, in 34 with aspergillosis, and in 36 with cryptococcosis (mainly patients positive for human immunodeficiency virus). Response to itraconazole alone was obtained in the case of sporotrichosis and in 24 of 34 patients with different forms of aspergillosis (of the 18 patients with invasive pulmonary aspergillosis, 15 were cured). Patients with cryptococcosis received itraconazole for active infection and/or for prevention of relapse. Active infection was treated successfully with itraconazole alone in 9 of 12 patients and with itraconazole plus flucytosine in 8 of 10 patients. Of the 31 patients who received itraconazole maintenance therapy for up to 27 months, 4 (13%) had relapses; 14 (45%) did not have relapses, and decline of serum antigen was detected in 12 of them; and 13 (42%) were completely cured (serum antigen titer dropped to zero). With the exception of hypokalemia in one patient, itraconazole was well tolerated even in patients who received the drug for several months or years. 
1	Study of preneoplastic changes of liver cells by immunohistochemical and molecular hybridization techniques. The status of hepatitis B virus DNA was investigated by in situ hybridization in multifocal areas of a noncancerous hepatitis B virus-associated cirrhosis. This liver exhibited a marked degree of dysplasia and adenomatous hyperplasia. The results of these studies were correlated with the histopathology and immunohistochemical stains for hepatitis B core and surface antigens. There was clear evidence of a marked reduction to absence of hepatitis B viral DNA by in situ hybridization and absence of HBc and HBsAg in the foci of liver cell dysplasia and adenomatous hyperplasia. These results support the hypothesis that liver cell dysplasia and adenomatous hyperplasia are preneoplastic in nature. 
5	Interpleural analgesia improves pulmonary function after cholecystectomy. The purpose of this study was to examine the effects of interpleural bupivacaine on analgesia and ventilatory capacity after cholecystectomy. Forty-two patients undergoing elective cholecystectomy were randomly assigned to two groups: one to receive interpleural administration of bupivacaine-adrenaline mixture (Group 1 = 22 patients) and the other standard administration of intramuscular meperidine (Group 2 = 20 patients) for postoperative pain relief. The intensity of pain was evaluated by a visual analogue scale (VAS) preoperatively as well as at 2, 8, 24 and 48 hr postoperatively. At the same time, FVC and FEV1.0 measurements were obtained for all patients. The group given interpleural bupivacaine had better pain relief with mean VAS of 0.6 +/- 0.9 (mean +/- SD) 1.1 +/- 1.4, 0.6 +/- 0.9 and 0.8 +/- 1.2 compared with 5.2 +/- 2.2, 5.8 +/- 2.7, 5.5 +/- 2.2 and 4.5 +/- 1.8 for patients receiving meperidine (P less than 0.001). The patients in Group 1 also had larger FVC and FEV than those in Group 2: FVC 22 +/- 14.5 per cent vs 32 +/- 15.2 per cent (P less than 0.005), FEV1.0 25 +/- 15.5 vs 38 +/- 14.8 per cent (P less than 0.001) (mean +/- SD). We conclude that the interpleural analgesia can achieve better pain relief with greater ventilatory capacity than a standard analgesic regimen in the first two days after cholecystectomy. 
5	Assessment of cataracts from photographs in the Beaver Dam Eye Study. Presence and severity of age-related cataract was determined in adults 43 to 84 years of age in Beaver Dam, Wisconsin. Duplicate photograph gradings for nuclear sclerosis (n = 1160), cortical opacities (n = 1159), and posterior subcapsular cataract (n = 1137) were performed. There are five levels of nuclear sclerosis. Exact agreement occurred in 64.7% of the cases; agreement within one category in 99.8%. For cortical opacities, graders estimate involved area in nine segments of the lens. When the continuous scale is divided into 12 categories of severity, exact agreement varied between 73.5 and 82.4%; for agreement within one category, rates varied between 84.6 and 89.9%. For posterior subcapsular cataracts, exact agreement for involvement of the central circle occurred in 95.0% and agreement within one category occurred in 97.7%. Intraobserver comparisons disclosed similar concordance. These grading schemes are semiquantitative, reproducible, and can be performed for the large numbers of photographs from population-based studies. 
5	Prognostic significance of conjugate eye deviation in stroke patients. We prospectively studied the prognostic significance of conjugate eye deviation in 80 patients with acute stroke and compared the 3-month mortality and disability of these patients to those of the Tilburg epidemiological study of stroke. Mortality of patients with conjugate eye deviation was higher (41%) than for the general stroke population (34%), but this difference was not statistically significant (p less than 0.179). Looking at mortality and disability together, we found the outcome of patients with conjugate eye deviation to be significantly worse (p less than 0.001). Deviation of the eyes occurred more frequently to the right (65%) than to the left (35%). In the patient group with eye deviation to the left, mortality was significantly higher (64%, p less than 0.001) than in the group with eye deviation to the right (25%); only two patients of the former group (n = 28) could return home. Compared to the Tilburg epidemiological study of stroke, the group with eye deviation to the left did significantly worse, both for mortality alone (p less than 0.001) and for mortality and disability together (p less than 0.001). The group with eye deviation to the right did significantly worse only for mortality and disability together (p less than 0.01). Our results indicate that conjugate eye deviation is a prognostic factor for poor short-term mortality and disability in stroke patients, especially when the eyes are deviated to the left. 
5	Pathophysiological insights into the cardiomyopathy of Chagas' disease. The evidence gained from both human and animal studies of chronic chagasic cardiomyopathy suggests that the disease occurs as a consequence of several discrete and progressive pathophysiological processes occurring after infection, the ultimate expression of which depends on a host of unidentified factors. Collectively, the infection-associated events compromise microvasculature function and result in hypoperfusion, with consequences indistinguishable from those observed in other, nonparasitological cardiomyopathic diseases secondary to hypoperfusion. Therefore, chronic chagasic cardiomyopathy may share similar pathophysiological abnormalities with other chronic congestive cardiomyopathic states. 
1	Ultrasound-guided hepatic cryosurgery in the treatment of metastatic colon carcinoma. Preliminary results. Cryosurgery, the in situ freezing of cancer, has been proposed in the past as a possible treatment for unresectable hepatic tumors. Its advantage lies in the fact that it is a very focal treatment sacrificing less normal tissue than surgical resection, allowing treatment of multiple lobes. Because cryosurgery does not affect large vessels, tumors in difficult locations, such as adjacent to the inferior vena cava (IVC), can be treated. With the use of intraoperative ultrasound to place the cryoprobes and monitor the freezing process, 18 patients with unresectable metastatic colon carcinoma confined to the liver were treated. Of the 18 patients treated, 4 (22%) are in complete remission as determined by computed tomography (CT) scans and carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) levels, with a mean follow-up of 28.8 months. Four patients (22%) were not adequately treated at the time of cryosurgery. The number of lesions frozen in each patient ranged from 1 to 12, with a mean of 6 lesions. Fourteen patients had bilobar disease; three patients had previous right lobectomies with recurrences in their remaining left lobes prior to cryosurgery, and one patient had unilobar disease. Mean survival of the 14 cases with recurrence was 21.4 months, with 2 of the 14 still alive. Ultrasound-guided hepatic cryosurgery appears to be an effective treatment for metastatic colon carcinoma to the liver that is unresectable (including patients with bilobar and multiple lesions). These preliminary results indicate that the procedure warrants further study. 
4	Duration of the QT interval and total and cardiovascular mortality in healthy persons (The Framingham Heart Study experience). The baseline electrocardiograms of 5,125 original subjects of the Framingham Heart Study were measured to examine the relation of the QT interval corrected for heart rate (QTc) to risk of total mortality, sudden cardiac death, and death due to coronary artery disease over a 30-year follow-up period. Quintiles of QTc (seconds) less than or equal to 0.36, 0.36 to 0.38, 0.39 to 0.40, 0.41 to 0.43 and greater than or equal to 0.44 were studied in relation to these outcomes. There were no significant differences in the risk of total mortality, sudden cardiac death or death due to coronary artery disease according to QTc. A similar lack of significant association between QTc and these 3 outcomes was observed among all persons studied and in the 2 sexes after using a multiple regression analysis to control for several potentially confounding characteristics including age, gender, cigarette smoking, serum total cholesterol, systolic systemic blood pressure and Framingham relative weight. The results of this study fail to demonstrate an association between baseline QTc and overall mortality, and deaths due to sudden cardiac events or coronary artery disease in a large population-based cohort of essentially healthy persons in whom pathologic forms of QTc prolongation are uncommon. 
3	Significance of magnetic resonance imaging in acute head injury. One hundred seventy-seven patients who had incurred head trauma were studied with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Patients varied from those with mild injury without any focal neurological deficit to those with severe injury with post-traumatic coma. Altogether, 177 lesions were demonstrated by MRI in 123 of 177 patients within 3 days of injury using T2-weighted (SE2000/40,2000/111) and T1-weighted (IR1500/500/40) multislice sequences. In contrast, computerized tomography (CT) demonstrated 103 lesions in 90 patients. MRI was superior to CT in the diagnosis of nonhemorrhagic contusions demonstrated as a high-intensity area on T2-weighted imaging. MRI provided some information to evaluate the severity of diffuse axonal injury or to predict delayed traumatic intracerebral hematoma (DTICH). 
5	Effects of hypertension on pregnancy monitoring and results. The effect of severity of hypertension on fetal heart rate tracing changes and neonatal outcomes was evaluated on all patients with hypertension seen in 1980 and 1981 (666 cases, 10% of the pregnant population) in the Chicago-Lying In Hospital. The patients were grouped according to severity of hypertension, and the fetal heart rate monitoring, drugs administered, mode of delivery, and neonatal outcome were analyzed. Half of the patients (326) had mild hypertension and 13% (87) had severe hypertension; the remainder (253) had moderate hypertension. There were 49% primiparous and 51% multiparous women. The diagnosis of preeclampsia was made in 76% of cases, and chronic hypertension in 19%. Only 12% of the total were premature by dates, but 47% of this group were among the severe group. Oxytocin was given to 50%, whereas delivery was spontaneous in 56% of cases, and by cesarean section in 22%. This was higher among the severe hypertension group (37%), and the prematurity rate was 47%. Nonstress testing was done in one third of cases and only nonreactivity was associated with neonatal death. Neonatal depression (Apgar score less than 6 at 5 minutes) was significantly associated with intrapartum fixed baseline and late decelerations; these were the best predictors of fetal outcome. The administration of magnesium sulfate, hydralazine, meperidine, or morphine did not predictably affect the fetal heart rate pattern. The perinatal mortality was 21% in the mild group and 36% and 138%, respectively, among moderate and severe cases of hypertension. Close antepartum and intrapartum surveillance, including proper fetal monitoring, should help to reduce risks for mother and fetus through timely intervention. 
3	Familial Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease without periodic EEG activity. Four members of a kindred with Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease are reported, in whom myoclonus did not develop and in whom serial electroencephalograms performed late in their illness failed to show periodic sharp wave complexes. Otherwise, the patients' disease duration, clinical features, and neuropathological findings were similar to those described in sporadic cases of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease. Our findings and those reported by others suggest that periodic electroencephalographic activity may be rare in familial forms of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, as it is in other slow transmissible encephalopathies. 
3	Occult, bilateral anterior sacral and intrasacral meningeal and perineurial cysts: case report and review of the literature. None of the more than 180 cases of anterior sacral meningocele reported in the past 150 years has been bilateral, and only two have been associated with occult intrasacral meningocele. We report a unique case of bilateral anterior sacral cysts, communicating with the subarachnoid space, associated with occult intrasacral meningeal and perineurial (Tarlov's) cysts, in an asymptomatic woman. The pertinent clinical and diagnostic imaging literature is reviewed. 
3	Intrathecal morphine 0.2 mg versus epidural bupivacaine 0.125% or their combination: effects on parturients. To compare the efficacy and side effects of 0.2 mg intrathecal (IT) morphine with 0.125% epidural bupivacaine, 62 women in labor were studied. They were randomly divided into three groups: group 1 (n = 20) received IT morphine; group 2 (n = 22) received epidural bupivacaine; and group 3 (n = 20) received a combination of both using a combined spinal-epidural (CSE) technique. According to a visual analogue scale for assessing analgesia, neither IT 0.2 mg morphine nor 10 ml 0.125% epidural bupivacaine was effective in producing adequate pain relief in labor, whereas the combination produced excellent analgesia. The use of IT morphine significantly reduced the dosage requirement of epidural bupivacaine. The incidence of nausea, vomiting, and pruritus was significantly higher when IT morphine had been administered, whereas that of urinary retention did not differ. No serious respiratory depression occurred in any of the patients. When the course of labor was studied, the prior use of IT morphine significantly prolonged the duration of the first stage of labor and the total duration of labor. We conclude that the administration of 0.2 mg IT morphine in combination with epidural administration of 0.125% bupivacaine provides better analgesia than the administration of either drug alone. 
4	Felodipine in the treatment of hypertensive type II diabetics: effect on glucose homeostasis. The effect of felodipine on glucose tolerance was evaluated in 18 male type II diabetic patients treated with diet alone, who were hypertensive despite beta-blocker treatment. The study was a double-bind cross-over comparison of placebo and felodipine in addition to beta-blockade. Oral glucose tolerance tests were performed at randomization and at the end of each 4-week double-blind treatment period. The doses of felodipine given were 5 mg b.i.d. for 2 weeks followed by 10 mg b.i.d. for a further 2 weeks. Blood pressure was significantly reduced during felodipine treatment, whereas heart rate remained unaltered. HbA1c and fasting insulin levels did not change during the treatment periods. Fasting and maximal blood glucose levels were not altered between any of the treatment periods. However, there was a small but statistically significant increase (median increase 4%) in the area under the glucose concentration vs. time curve after felodipine as compared to placebo treatment. This increase was not considered to be clinically significant in the short term, but the finding merits further investigation in a rigorous long-term study. 
5	A surgical approach to the cervicothoracic spine. We describe a method for approaching the lower cervical and upper thoracic spine, the brachial plexus and related vessels. The method involves the elevation of the medial corner of the manubrium, the sternoclavicular joint, and the medial half of the clavicle on a pedicle of the sternomastoid muscle. We have used this exposure in 17 cases with few complications and good results. Its successful performance requires high standards of anaesthesia, surgical technique and postoperative care. 
5	CV 205-502--effectiveness, tolerability, and safety over 24-month study. Twenty hyperprolactinemic women (median prolactin [PRL] 2,989 mU/L, range 1,149 to 11,910 mU/L), previously unsuccessfully treated with bromocriptine, were treated in a prospective study, for 3 to 24 months with the new, nonergot, long-acting, dopamine agonist, CV 205-502. Treatment resulted in normalization of PRL in 14 patients, in one daily dose of 0.075 to 0.150 mg of the drug. Three patients were treated in doses above 0.150 mg up to 0.300 mg, but PRL was not normalized during the study. Menstrual function was restored in 15 of 18 amenorrheic patients. Galactorrhea, present in 7 patients, disappeared in 5. Four patients became pregnant and gave birth to healthy children. In conclusion, we found CV 205-502 effective in one daily dose, with good tolerability; it is safe and provides a valuable alternative to the dopamine agonist drugs in use today. 
5	Continuous electrocardiographic monitoring in hypertensive crises in pregnancy. Twenty-four patients first seen with hypertensive crises during pregnancy were studied by continuous electrocardiographic monitoring for a period of 24 hours to detect the presence of serious ventricular arrhythmias. Three patients were excluded from analysis because of low serum potassium levels. Thirteen of the remaining 21 patients had ventricular tachycardia on subsequent analysis of the electrocardiogram. These arrhythmias subsided after induction of anesthesia when blood pressure control was optimal. This finding may be implicated in the pathogenesis of pulmonary edema and sudden death in these patients. 
2	Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug use and increased risk for peptic ulcer disease in elderly persons. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the relative risk for peptic ulcer disease that is associated with the use of nonaspirin nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. DESIGN: Nested case-control study. SETTING: Tennessee Medicaid program. PARTICIPANTS: Medicaid enrollees 65 years of age or older were included in the study. The 1415 case patients had been hospitalized for confirmed peptic ulcer disease at some point from 1984 through 1986. The 7063 control persons represented a stratified random sample of other Medicaid enrollees. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: The estimated relative risk for the development of peptic ulcer disease among current users of nonaspirin nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, compared with that among nonusers, was 4.1 (95% CI, 3.5 to 4.7). For current users, the risk increased with increasing dose, from a relative risk of 2.8 (CI, 1.8 to 4.3) for the lowest to a relative risk of 8.0 (CI, 4.4 to 14.8) for the highest dose category. The risk was greatest in the first month of use (relative risk, 7.2; CI, 4.9 to 10.5). If the association is fully causal, 29% of peptic ulcers in the study sample resulted from the use of these drugs, and the excess risk associated with such use was 17.4 hospitalizations for ulcer disease per 1000 person-years of exposure. CONCLUSIONS: These data support other findings indicating that a clinically significant risk for serious ulcer disease is associated with the use of nonaspirin nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. The data show that this risk increases with dose and recency of use and that use of these drugs may be responsible for a large proportion of peptic ulcer disease among elderly persons. 
1	Oral contraceptives and breast cancer. Among women in general the risk of breast cancer through 59 years of age does not appear to be affected appreciably by the use of oral contraceptives. Nonetheless, concern continues to be expressed about the effects of early age at first use, long-term duration of use, formulation, and a variety of other factors thought to influence breast cancer risk in the presence of oral contraception. A number of recent studies restricted to young women suggest that long-term use may increase the risk of disease occurring very early, but the present lack of consistent findings in well-conducted epidemiologic studies prevents any certain conclusion with regard to cause-and-effect. However, if an increased risk were indeed present, the most plausible interpretation is that long-term oral contraception promotes earlier clinical manifestation of breast cancer in some women while having no net impact on their lifetime risk of the disease. 
4	Response of spinal cord blood flow and motor and sensory evoked potentials to aortic ligation. To produce spinal cord ischemia in the lamb, ligation of the thoracic aorta was performed for 15, 30, and 45 minutes in three animals each. Spinal cord blood flow and motor and sensory evoked potentials were measured before, during, and after aortic ligation. Ischemia with a blood flow of zero during ligation was encountered in the thoracic and lumbar cords, followed by hyperemia upon release of the ligature. Both somatosensory and motor evoked potentials were obliterated during aortic ligation and gradually recovered following resumption of flow. Motor and sensory evoked potentials behaved similarly to high aortic ligation. 
1	An inner city cancer prevention clinic. Design, methods, and early results. An American Cancer Society demonstration pilot project is underway that is designed to provide comprehensive cancer prevention-related services to the underserved community of West Oakland, California. An array of cancer prevention services are being made available through an inner-city clinic (West Oakland Health Center), including cancer risk assessments and education about cancer, physical examinations for cancer, teaching of self-examination procedures, smoking cessation, and nutrition counseling, appointments for Pap smears, sigmoidoscopy, mammography, and other more specialized screening procedures, case management for findings suspicious for cancer, and community education programs. Described is the process of implementing these services, their utilization, and their impact (after 6 months). 
5	Etiology of acute lower respiratory tract infections in Gambian children: I. Acute lower respiratory tract infections in infants presenting at the hospital. Ninety infants less than 1 year of age with pneumonia and 43 control infants were investigated for viral and chlamydial infection with the use of culture and serology and for bacterial infection with the use of blood cultures, lung aspirates, antibody assays and antigen detection procedures. One or more potential pathogens were identified in 62 (69%) cases with pneumonia and in 12 (28%) controls. Infection by respiratory viruses was identified in 42 (49%) cases and in 8 (19%) controls. Respiratory syncytial virus was the commonest pathogen identified and was found in 32 cases (37%). Bacterial infections were also common, being found in 27 (30%) cases and 3 (7%) controls, and predominantly involved Streptococcus pneumoniae (20%) or Haemophilus influenzae (11%). Bacterial infections were associated with raised white blood cell counts and were identified more often by antigen detection procedures (68%) than by culture of blood or lung aspirates (34%) or by serology (33%). Mixed viral-bacterial infections were identified in 13 cases (15%). Infection with Chlamydia trachomatis was diagnosed in 2 infants with acute lower respiratory tract infection and in 1 control infant. 
3	The electrodiagnostic findings in polyneuropathies associated with IgM monoclonal gammopathies. Electrodiagnostic studies were analyzed in patients with neuropathy associated with IgM monoclonal proteins, 7 with anti-myelin associated glycoprotein reactivity (MAG) and 7 nonreactive to MAG. The findings were distinctly different in the two groups. The electrodiagnostic studies of all the MAG-reactive patients had demyelinating features with slowing of conduction and prolonged distal latencies while only one of the MAG-nonreactive patients had a demyelinating pattern. In fact, the MAG-nonreactive patients were a heterogeneous group, both electrodiagnostically and clinically. This study supports the concept that MAG-reactive polyneuropathy is demyelinating in type, and is caused by the activity of the IgM M-protein directed at an antigen in the myelin sheath. 
5	Characterization of distal bronchial microflora during acute exacerbation of chronic bronchitis. Use of the protected specimen brush technique in 54 mechanically ventilated patients. To obtain accurate information on distal bronchial microflora during acute exacerbation in patients with chronic bronchitis, we prospectively studied 54 such patients who had been receiving mechanical ventilation because of hypercapnic respiratory failure. Fiberoptic bronchoscopy using a protected specimen brush (PSB) was performed on each patient within the first 24 h after admission. Cultures of protected brush specimens demonstrated no growth in 27 patients (50%). With the exception of fever (38.2 +/- 0.8 versus 37.7 +/- 0.6 degrees C; p less than 0.05), the initial severity of the episode of exacerbation was similar in patients with and without infection. A total of 44 organisms were isolated in the 27 patients with positive cultures; the predominant pathogens were Hemophilus spp. and Streptococcus spp. (involved in 74% of cases), but other organisms were isolated in 12 of 27 patients. Mortality rates, duration of mechanical ventilation, and duration of hospitalization were not significantly different between patients with bronchial microflora treated with appropriate antimicrobial therapy (n = 27) and patients without bronchial microflora either receiving empirical antibiotic therapy (n = 18) or not (n = 9). These data suggest that distal bronchial infection due to the usual pathogens, as far as shown by protected specimen brush cultures, may not be the sole or even the predominant cause of acute exacerbation of chronic bronchitis in patients requiring mechanical ventilation. 
3	Role of diabetologist in evaluating diabetic retinopathy. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the ability of diabetologists to screen diabetic patients for diabetic retinopathy. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Comparison of eye examination performed by diabetologists with direct ophthalmoscopy through an undilated pupil and by ophthalmologists through a dilated pupil with seven-field stereoscopic fundus photography (gold standard). The study consisted of 67 insulin-dependent and non-insulin-dependent diabetic outpatients attending a diabetes clinic. RESULTS: On the basis of fundus photography, patients were classified as having no or insignificant (30%), minimal (31%), moderate (24%), or severe (15%) retinopathy. The diabetologists and ophthalmologists performed similarly in their ability to classify severity of diabetic retinopathy accurately. When no or insignificant retinopathy (isolated microaneurysms only) was detected by examination, clinically significant retinopathy detected by fundus photography was highly unlikely (less than 5%). On the other hand, if more than isolated microaneurysms were seen on examination, all examiners missed more severe lesions detected by fundus photography. Patients with corrected visual acuity worse than 20/30 had a high likelihood (100%) of moderate or severe retinopathy. CONCLUSIONS: Motivated well-trained diabetologists can screen for diabetic retinopathy. The absence of detectable lesions by direct ophthalmoscopy indicates that automatic referral to an ophthalmologist is not necessary. However, if any level of retinopathy is detected or corrected acuity is worse than 20/30, referral to an ophthalmologist is required. In this setting, fundus photography is advised because it is the most sensitive means of detecting clinically significant retinopathy. If other nonophthalmologists can be trained to achieve similar results, current recommendations for ophthalmologic referral that require annual ophthalmologic examinations for most diabetic patients may need to be reconsidered. 
1	Vegetables, fruits, and carotenoids and the risk of cancer. Low intake of vegetables, fruits, and carotenoids is consistently associated with increased risk of lung cancer in both prospective and retrospective studies. In addition, low levels of beta-carotene in serum or plasma are consistently associated with the subsequent development of lung cancer. The simplest explanation is that beta-carotene is protective. Since retinol (preformed vitamin A) is not related in a similar manner to lung cancer risk, beta-carotene appears to function through a mechanism that does not require conversion into vitamin A. However, the importance of other carotenoids and other constituents of vegetables and fruit has not been adequately explored. Both prospective and retrospective studies suggest that vegetable and fruit intake may reduce the risk of cancers of the mouth, pharynx, larynx, esophagus, stomach, colon, rectum, bladder, and cervix. But because of fewer studies and less consistency among studies, the epidemiologic evidence is at present less persuasive than for lung cancer. 
2	Paf-acether synthesis by Helicobacter pylori. Clinical studies suggest that Helicobacter pylori may play a role in the pathogenesis of gastroduodenal ulcers in man but direct evidence of mucosal injury by this microorganism is still lacking. Paf-acether (paf) causes a number of disorders including ischaemic bowel necrosis and gastroduodenal ulceration. Since paf is produced by Escherichia coli, we investigated whether it could be synthesised by H pylori. Five H pylori isolates were collected from antral biopsy specimens from patients with gastritis and duodenal ulcer and cultured with selective antibiotics. Colonies obtained from both blood agar and brucella broth medium were used. Paf was determined by platelet aggregation assay after ethanolic extraction and subsequent purification by high performance liquid chromatography. Paf was detected in H pylori in blood agar plates (680 (390) pg paf/1 x 10(6) organisms) but not in bacteria cultured on brucella broth medium. Supplementation of the latter medium with lyso paf and acetyl-CoA, two paf precursors present in high amounts in the mammalian intestine, induced paf production in three of five isolates. The platelet aggregating material extracted from H pylori exhibited biological and physiochemical characteristics identical to those of paf released from eukaryotic cells. These findings suggest that H pylori may add to the local production of paf in inflamed gastric mucosa. 
1	Transrectal ultrasonography in the evaluation of the infertile man: a report of 3 cases. The traditional evaluation of the infertile man with azoospermia or low ejaculate volume includes determination of serum testosterone and follicle-stimulating hormone levels, a seminal fructose test, post-ejaculate urinalysis and, sometimes, vasography. Transrectal ultrasonography, a technique currently familiar to most urologists, recently has been added to our diagnostic armamentarium. This office-based imaging procedure provides an accurate assessment of the prostate, ejaculatory ducts and seminal vesicles, which can be helpful in the evaluation of certain infertile patients. We describe 3 patients who presented with either azoospermia or decreased ejaculate volume in whom transrectal ultrasonography had a critical role in the fertility evaluation. The clinical indications for and interpretation of transrectal ultrasonography in the infertile population are described. Transrectal ultrasonography currently is the most accurate, inexpensive and readily available noninvasive imaging technique used to diagnose obstruction of the ejaculatory ducts in the infertile patient with either azoospermia or low ejaculate volume. 
5	Radiotherapy for palliation of locally advanced prostatic carcinoma. Some patients present with distressing symptoms due to locally advanced prostatic carcinoma which may be refractory to hormonal manipulation and/or surgical treatment. Over an 8-year period 26 patients received local palliative radiotherapy for recurrent bleeding and lower urinary outflow tract obstruction. All were treated with conventional external beam radiotherapy and all but 2 obtained useful palliation of symptoms, especially those with recurrent bleeding. We also found that radiotherapy could be given to the majority of patients on an out-patient basis in 2 or 3 fractions. This was well tolerated and there were few side effects. 
5	The Marinesco-Sjogren syndrome examined by computed tomography, magnetic resonance, and 18F-2-fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose and positron emission tomography. The Marinesco-Sjogren syndrome is an autosomal recessive degenerative disorder characterized by congenital cataracts, cerebellar ataxia, spasticity, mental deficiency, and skeletal abnormalities. We studied two adult siblings with Marinesco-Sjogren syndrome using anatomic and metabolic brain imaging techniques to characterize the pattern and nature of abnormalities in the brain. Computed tomographic and magnetic resonance imaging showed diffuse brain atrophy of mild to moderate degree, involving primarily the white matter of the cerebrum, cerebellum, brain stem, and cervical spinal cord. The pattern of atrophy resembled that seen in diffuse leukoencephalopathies. Measurements of local cerebral glucose metabolic rates with positron emission tomography revealed no statistically significant differences from normal control subjects in most regions, but metabolic rate was decreased in the thalamus in one patient. The findings support a diffuse white matter disorder in Marinesco-Sjogren syndrome. 
5	Celiac disease, brain atrophy, and dementia. We report 5 patients who developed dementia before age 60 and were subsequently found to have celiac disease (CD). Intellectual deterioration ranged from moderate to severe, and diffuse cerebral or cerebellar atrophy was found on brain CT. Diagnosis of CD was confirmed by findings of subtotal villous atrophy in jejunal biopsy specimens and positive serum reticulin and gliadin antibodies. Conspicuously, gastrointestinal symptoms were mild. The gluten-free diet failed to improve the neurologic disability except in 1 patient. CD is a multisystem disorder and may play a role in some cases of presenile dementia. Although the pathogenetic mechanisms are obscure, immunologic mechanisms are implicated. 
3	Salmeterol in nocturnal asthma: a double blind, placebo controlled trial of a long acting inhaled beta 2 agonist OBJECTIVE--To determine whether inhaled salmeterol, a new long acting inhaled beta adrenergic agonist, reduces nocturnal bronchoconstriction and improves sleep quality in patients with nocturnal asthma. DESIGN--Randomised, double blind, placebo controlled crossover study. SETTING--Hospital outpatient clinics in Edinburgh. SUBJECTS--Twenty clinically stable patients (13 women, seven men) with nocturnal asthma, median age 39 (range 18-60) years. INTERVENTIONS--Salmeterol 50 micrograms and 100 micrograms and placebo taken each morning and evening by metered dose inhaler. Rescue salbutamol inhalers were provided throughout the run in and study periods. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES--Improvement in nocturnal asthma as measured by peak expiratory flow rates and change in sleep quality as measured by electroencephalography. RESULTS--Salmeterol improved the lowest overnight peak flow rate at both 50 micrograms (difference in median values (95% confidence interval for difference in medians) 69 (18 to 88) l/min) and 100 micrograms (72 (23 to 61) l/min) doses twice daily. While taking salmeterol 50 micrograms twice daily patients had an objective improvement in sleep quality, spending less time awake or in light sleep (-9 (-4 to -44) min) and more time in stage 4 sleep (26 (6-34) min). CONCLUSIONS--Salmeterol is an effective long acting inhaled bronchodilator for patients with nocturnal asthma and at a dose of 50 micrograms twice daily improves objective sleep quality. 
4	Vascular complications after orthotopic liver transplantation. Over a 57-month period, we performed 430 orthotopic liver transplants in 372 patients. A total of 38 vascular complications were identified including hepatic artery thrombosis (n = 24), portal vein thrombosis (n = 6), combined hepatic artery thrombosis/portal vein thrombosis (n = 3), and hepatic artery rupture (n = 5). A number of potential risk factors for the development of vascular thrombosis were evaluated with only children, weight less than 10 kg, and cold ischemia time found to be significant. The clinical presentation included fulminant hepatic failure, allograft dysfunction, biliary sepsis, and screening ultrasound. Duplex ultrasonography was diagnostic in nearly all cases. Therapeutic modalities included revascularization, revascularization followed by retransplantation, retransplantation alone, and observation. Five cases of hepatic artery rupture occurred in four patients. Infectious arteritis was present in four patients. The 6-month actuarial survival in patients with vascular complications was 70%. Early diagnosis is critical for graft salvage, with surgical intervention the mainstay of therapy. 
5	Usefulness of antithrombotic therapy in resting angina pectoris or non-Q-wave myocardial infarction in preventing death and myocardial infarction (a pilot study from the Antithrombotic Therapy in Acute Coronary Syndromes Study Group). In a prospective pilot trial of antithrombotic therapy in the acute coronary syndromes (ATACS) of resting and unstable angina pectoris or non-Q-wave myocardial infarction, 3 different antithrombotic regimens in the prevention of recurrent ischemic events were compared for efficacy. Ninety-three patients were randomized to receive aspirin (325 mg/day), or full-dose heparin followed by warfarin, or the combination of aspirin (80 mg/day) plus heparin and then warfarin. Trial antithrombotic therapy was added to standardized antianginal medication and continued for 3 months or until an end point was reached. Analysis, by intention-to-treat, of the 3-month end points, revealed the following: recurrent ischemia occurred in 7 patients (22%) after aspirin, in 6 patients (25%) after heparin and warfarin, and in 16 patients (43%) after aspirin combined with heparin and then warfarin; coronary revascularization occurred in 12 patients (38%) after aspirin, in 12 patients (50%) after heparin and warfarin, and in 22 patients (60%) after aspirin combined with heparin and then warfarin; myocardial infarction occurred in 1 patient (3%) after aspirin, in 3 patients (13%) after heparin and warfarin, and in no patient after aspirin combined with heparin and then warfarin; no deaths occurred after aspirin or after aspirin combined with heparin and then warfarin, but 1 patient (4%) died after warfarin alone; major bleeding occurred in 3 patients (9%) after aspirin, in 2 patients (8%) after heparin and warfarin, and in 3 patients (8%) after aspirin combined with heparin and then warfarin. Recurrent myocardial ischemia occurred at 3 +/- 3 days after randomization. 
1	Modified Van Nes rotationplasty in the treatment of malignant neoplasms in the lower extremities of children. A technique of modified Van Nes rotationplasty has been used since 1981 for limb salvage surgery in children and adolescents with malignant sarcoma of the lower extremity. The original procedure for lesions of the distal femur was further modified and adopted for selected lesions of the proximal femur and tibia. Sixteen skeletally immature children form the base of this report. The tumors were located in the distal femur in ten children, the proximal tibia in five and the proximal femur in one. There were no intraoperative complications and postoperative complications included one infection requiring debridement and three minor healing delays. There were no local recurrences, neurovascular compromises, late derotations, or psychologic decompensations. One patient died of metastatic disease and another died of a second malignancy (leukemia). The remaining patients are good, functional, below-knee prosthesis users who participate in a number of sporting and athletic activities. The procedure is safe, has a relatively low complication rate, allows for the functional demands of an active, growing child, and accommodates for the future growth of extremities. 
1	Diagnosis of metastatic lesions to the stomach by salvage cytology. A report of three cases. Secondary neoplasms of the stomach are rare and are often clinical and diagnostic problems. Three patients with bleeding "volcano-like" ulcers were diagnosed by combined endoscopic "salvage" cytology and surgical biopsy as having metastatic submucosal lesions from hematologic spread. The combination of endoscopic appearance, clinical findings, and tissue and cytologic examination can lead to the correct diagnosis. The results from these cases support the utility of this cytologic technique in combination with biopsy in this clinical setting. 
5	Polymorphisms of GLUT2 and GLUT4 genes. Use in evaluation of genetic susceptibility to NIDDM in blacks. The liver/islet (GLUT2) and muscle/adipose tissue (GLUT4) glucose-transporter gene products, membrane proteins that facilitate glucose uptake into cells, are important molecules for normal carbohydrate metabolism. Recent isolation of the genes encoding these proteins provides a means to assess the role of possible defects that might contribute to impaired glucose-stimulated insulin secretion or impaired insulin-mediated glucose uptake, both prominent phenotypic features of non-insulin-dependent diabetes (NIDDM). A GLUT2 cDNA clone was isolated from a human liver cDNA library to search for polymorphisms at this locus in American Blacks. Three highly polymorphic sites were identified, one of which (EcoRI-Hae III) appears to be due to an insertion and/or deletion of 200 base pairs of DNA. Significant linkage disequilibrium between these sites over approximately 30 kilobases of genomic DNA suggested that these polymorphisms could be in linkage disequilibrium with mutations at this locus if they exist. A GLUT4 cDNA clone was also utilized to search for polymorphisms at this locus, but only one previously described polymorphism was observed. GLUT2 and GLUT4 cDNA probes were used to evaluate DNA polymorphisms in genomic DNA from American Blacks with NIDDM. The allelic, genotypic, and haplotypic frequencies of the DNA polymorphisms at these loci did not differ from the frequencies in nondiabetic subjects. Because no associations with NIDDM were found, it appears unlikely that mutations at these loci contribute in a major way to the genetic susceptibility to NIDDM observed in American Blacks. 
5	Urinary tract dilatation in constipated children. Abnormalities of the upper urinary tract were sought retrospectively in 180 children with constipation who had been investigated surgically over a 5-year period. Of those in whom an intravenous urogram had been performed, the incidence of dilatation of the upper renal tract was high, but only 12% of the patients with non-organic constipation had been so investigated. 
1	Practical aspects of pulsatile gonadotropin-releasing hormone administration. Pulsatile administration of gonadotropin-releasing hormone represents a major advance in the treatment of anovulation in women who fail to ovulate with clomiphene citrate and is an alternative for many women who currently receive human menopausal gonadotropin. Four issues must be addressed before administering pulsatile gonadotropin-releasing hormone: (1) safety, (2) efficacy, (3) convenience, and (4) cost. Each of these issues will be affected by the three major decisions a physician makes with gonadotropin-releasing hormone therapy: (1) patient selection, (2) route of administration, and (3) dose of gonadotropin-releasing hormone. The ideal candidate for gonadotropin-releasing hormone therapy is a patient with an absence of endogenous pulsatile gonadotropin-releasing hormone, as seen in hypothalamic amenorrhea. Although women with polycystic ovarian disease can be treated with pulsatile gonadotropin-releasing hormone, a decreased ovulation rate should be expected. The route of administration, intravenous or subcutaneous, and the degree of monitoring can be tailored by the physician to fit each patient's needs. Pulsatile gonadotropin-releasing hormone therapy is a safe, effective, convenient, and economical alternative to human menopausal gonadotropin for ovulation induction in women resistant to clomiphene. 
1	Selective uptake of toxic nucleoside (125IUdR) by resistant cancer. We report uptake of a thymidine analogue 125-Iodine-5-iodo-2'-deoxyuridine (125IUdR) by nude mice bearing human xenografts of choriocarcinoma or colonic cancer. When 125IUdR was given alone, uptake by intestinal tissues was 5-10 times greater than by the tumours as measured by tissue gamma counting. This ratio was reversed when hydroxyurea or cytosine arabinoside were used as inhibitors of ribonucleotide reductase and were given in combination with 5-fluorouracil or methotrexate to inhibit thymidine synthesis shortly before injecting 125IUdR. Counting the radioactivity in tissues removed 24 hours after 125IUdR gave tumour to highest normal tissue ratios of up to 15:1, but the corresponding nuclear grain counts, which is probably a more reliable indicator of selective uptake into DNA, were in excess of 100:1. The addition of unlabelled IUdR to the regimen only reduced the uptake of 125IUdR when given in relatively large amounts. For this approach to be exploited it is concluded that the tumour must be resistant at the cell level to the inhibitor of DNA synthesis either de novo or as a result of prior exposure to it. This inhibitor can then be used to block uptake of the potentially toxic nucleoside analogue by normal renewal tissues while it is taken up by the resistant cancer cells. By inhibiting synthesis of the corresponding normal nucleosides with inhibitors to which the cancer cells are not resistant, incorporation of the toxic analogues into tumour DNA was enhanced. Although 125IUdR is a convenient agent for exploring this approach and is highly cytotoxic when incorporated in DNA, the clinical potential of reverse role chemotherapy probably lies with the development of toxic non-radioactive nucleoside analogues. 
5	Management of low-risk metastatic gestational trophoblastic tumors. The clinical course of 48 patients with low-risk metastatic gestational trophoblastic tumors (GTTs) treated with primary single-agent chemotherapy was reviewed. All patients achieved sustained remission, although 25 (51%) required a second single-agent regimen, and 7 (14%) needed combination chemotherapy to achieve it. An average of 3.4 courses of chemotherapy were necessary to achieve remission, and 6 patients (12%) underwent resection of resistant tumor foci. Primary single-agent chemotherapy is a reasonable treatment option in patients with low-risk metastatic GTT. 
1	Malignant melanoma of the oral cavity. A case report. The oral cavity is a rare location for the development of primary malignant melanoma. Less than 2% of all malignant melanomas develop in the region. A case report is presented, illustrating the management in the site of the palate, together with a review of the relevant literature. 
4	Carotid artery disease in patients with head and neck carcinoma. Irradiation has been shown experimentally to cause accelerated development of atherosclerosis in exposed large arteries. However, occurrence of such an entity in carotid arteries of patients after treatment for head and neck carcinoma is unknown. Therefore, we reviewed 179 patient charts who had undergone head and neck operations with or without irradiation between 1979-1987. Of these 179 patients, 107 (59.8%) were dead at time of follow-up. Cause of death was unknown in 42 (40%) patients; in the remainder included: respiratory arrest--33; carcinoma-related--18; cardiac--6;pneumonia--7; and trauma--1. Average interval from treatment to death was 23.5 months. Of the 72 patients known to be alive, follow-up was obtained in 52 patients. Their average age was 64.9 years. Risk factors for atherosclerosis included: male gender--43; smoking--50; hypertension--9; diabetes--4; coronary artery disease--12; and peripheral vascular disease--4. Seventy-five per cent of these patients received postoperative irradiation. Average follow-up was 64.5 months. Duplex scans were performed on 34 patients. Three patients had common or internal carotid stenoses greater than 75 per cent. All of these patients had received irradiation and none of them were symptomatic. Seven patients had carotid stenoses between 50 to 75 per cent; five of these had received irradiation. Of these five patients, one had a stroke 60 months postoperatively, and one had a TIA 36 months postoperatively. The remaining 58 patients (of which 48 had irradiation) had carotid stenoses less than 50 per cent and none were symptomatic. 
1	Immunocytochemical estrogen and progestin receptor assays in breast cancer with monoclonal antibodies. Histopathologic, demographic, and biochemical correlations and relationship to endocrine response and survival. Breast cancer specimens from 600 women were assayed for estrogen receptors (ER) using an immunocytochemical assay (ICA) employing the monoclonal antiestrophilin antibody H222 Sp gamma. Results showed significant correlation with biochemical ER determinations as well as with tumor grade and menopausal status. In 449 cases, results of progesterone receptor assay by ICA using the monoclonal anti-PgR antibody KD 68, also correlated significantly with biochemical PgR measurements. The ERICA/PgRICA positivity was significantly more frequent in postmenopausal white women. Colloid carcinomas were most likely to be ERICA positive and PgRICA positive whereas medullary carcinomas were most often negative. In 47 patients with advanced mammary carcinoma, results of ERICA and PgRICA were more closely related to endocrine response than those of ER and PgR by dextran-coated charcoal assay (DCC). In 339 women with Stage I or Stage II breast cancer, ERICA was significantly associated with disease-free survival. Analysis by Cox's proportional hazard model, however, showed PgRICA to be the best predictor of survival and disease-free survival in 197 women at the same stages of disease. These data indicate that ICA is more predictive of prognosis than biochemical ER and PgR. The ease of ICA performance coupled with these results indicate that the method is an acceptable substitute for DCC in analyzing breast cancers for ER/PgR. 
5	The case for porous-coated hip implants. The femoral side. A series of 1163 total hip arthroplasties (THAs) using porous-coated femoral components were roentgenographically assessed for implant fixation. For 959 primary THAs followed from two to 12 years, the femoral revision rate was 1% and the ten-year survivorship rate was 96.4%; 150 young patients had a fixation failure incidence of only 1.3% at a mean follow-up period of 6.4 years; in 204 revision THAs, the femoral re-revision rate was 4% at a mean follow-up period of 53.4 months. Failures were largely related to inadequate femoral canal filling. Because of refinements in implant design and surgical techniques, a press fit of the implant is currently achieved in 94% of cases compared to 36% during the first five years. Porous-coated femoral components have yielded results equivalent to those with cement in primary THAs. Excellent results were observed in relatively young patients and patients with revisions. 
4	Pancreatic transplantation: radiologic evaluation of vascular complications. Transplantation of the pancreas is an increasingly common therapeutic option for preventing or delaying complications of type I diabetes mellitus. The authors studied the relative roles of various radiologic examinations in diagnosing vascular complications in these grafts including arterial and venous thrombosis, stenosis, and anastomotic leak (the most common vascular factors that necessitate pancreatectomy of the transplant), as defined with pathologic or arteriographic data. The results of 78 scintigraphic flow studies, 40 abdominal and pelvic computed tomographic (CT) scans, 27 sonograms, and eight color Doppler studies were evaluated in 52 patients who received a total of 27 cadaveric and 26 living-donor grafts over a 12-year period. These results were correlated with the data from 45 gross and microscopic pathologic studies and 37 arteriograms to determine their relative value in enabling detection of graft thrombosis and other vascular complications. Scintigraphy, CT, sonography, and color Doppler were all sensitive in detection of generalized graft abnormalities but lacked specificity in defining the underlying etiologic factors. 
3	Symptoms and disease associations in idiopathic intracranial hypertension (pseudotumor cerebri): a case-control study. To identify the symptoms and coexisting medical conditions associated with idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH), we administered an 83-item questionnaire at the time of diagnosis to 50 IIH patients and 100 aged-matched controls. Ninety percent of the IIH patients were women; the mean age was 33. Obesity and recent weight gain were much more common among patients than controls. Symptoms most commonly reported by IIH patients were headache (94%), transient visual obscurations (TVO) (68%), and intracranial noises (ICN) (58%). Daily occurrence of these symptoms was much more common among patients than controls. Controls also reported these and other IIH symptoms, but at lower frequencies. Several conditions previously associated with IIH were no more common in patients than controls including iron deficiency anemia, thyroid disease, pregnancy, antibiotic intake, and use of oral contraceptives. We conclude that previous studies of IIH, mostly uncontrolled and retrospective, have underestimated the frequency of symptoms in IIH patients and reported chance and spurious associations with common medical conditions and medications. The profile of a young obese woman with headaches and either TVO or ICN should alert the clinician to the diagnosis of IIH, especially when the symptoms occur daily. 
1	Testicular sex cord stromal tumour with granulosa cell differentiation: detection of steroid hormone receptors as a possible basis for tumour development and therapeutic management. A testicular sex cord stromal tumour with granulosa cell differentiation, typical of granulosa cell tumours of the adult type, was investigated immunohistologically on snap frozen and paraffin wax embedded material. The predominance of vimentin and the additional expression of cytokeratin subtypes 8 and 18, as well as the negative staining for epithelial membrane antigen, accorded with results previously reported, for ovarian granulosa cell tumours; the lack of expression of desmoplakin, however, was a distinctive feature. Together with negative staining for leucocyte common antigen, the antigen pattern facilitates the differential diagnosis between granulosa cell tumour and undifferentiated carcinoma or gonadal lymphoma, although its suitability for differentiating within the group of gonadal stromal tumours seems to be limited. The small growth fraction, shown by the monoclonal antibody Ki-67, is typical of the clinical behaviour of granulosa cell tumours. The expression of oestrogen and progesterone receptors, also recently found in testicular Leydig cell tumours, may provoke new approaches to the management of testicular granulosa cell tumours, as well as a new hypothesis on the development of these tumours. 
1	Abnormal vitamin B6 status in childhood leukemia. Vitamin B6 is involved in many biological processes of potential relevance to carcinogenesis and tumor growth, including DNA synthesis and maintenance of immunocompetence, yet very little information exists on B6 nutritional status in childhood leukemia. Using a radioenzymatic assay, the authors measured plasma pyridoxal 5'-phosphate (PLP), the biologically active form of B6, in 11 newly diagnosed untreated children with leukemia and 11 age-matched controls. The children with leukemia had significantly lower PLP levels than the controls. In 26 additional leukemia patients and 26 additional controls, a high-performance liquid chromatography assay also demonstrated lower plasma PLP levels in childhood leukemia compared with controls. These differences were significant for both acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) and for acute nonlymphoblastic leukemia (ANLL). The PLP values did not correlate with indices of leukemia cell burden, but did correlate with reported B6 intake, suggesting that illness-related diet changes are at least partially responsible for the low PLP levels. Before any chemotherapy, overall nutritional status was suboptimal in 53% of ALL cases and 57% of ANLL cases. Newly diagnosed children with leukemia have suboptimal overall nutrition as well as suboptimal vitamin B6 status. 
5	Superficial esophageal carcinoma. Surgical treatment and the results. We report 92 patients treated with esophagectomy for superficial esophageal carcinoma (SEC; 9.1% of all resected esophageal cancers at our institution). The operative mortality rate was 5.4%. In 24 cases, cancer invasion was limited to the mucosa, and in 68 to the submucosa. Twenty-three patients in the former group had no lymph node involvement, whereas 24 patients (35.3%) of the latter group had lymph node metastases. The 5-year survival rate after surgery for patients with SEC limited to the mucosa was 83.5%, which was significantly better than that for carcinoma invading the submucosa (54.9%). No recurrent disease occurred in patients with lesions limited to the mucosa. In conclusion, an esophagectomy with wide lymphadenectomy is necessary to provide a better prognosis for SEC invading the submucosa, whereas a less extensive treatment may be considered for SEC limited to the mucosa. 
5	Long-term echocardiographic follow-up of patients with a tricuspid bioprosthesis. To clarify the long-term results of bioprosthetic valve function in the tricuspid position, 29 consecutive patients who underwent tricuspid valve replacement (TVR) were evaluated. There were 20 girls/women and 9 boys/men, with ages ranging from 6 to 61 years (mean 41.4 years). The bioprosthetic valves included Hancock in 2, and Carpentier-Edwards in 27. The follow-up period ranged from 32 to 145 months (mean 89 months). Regurgitant flow of the tricuspid bioprosthesis was studied by color Doppler echocardiography. Peak velocity (Vp) and pressure half time (PHT) were measured by continuous wave Doppler echocardiography. Operative mortality was 13.7% (4/29), with the actuarial survival rate, including operative deaths, 75% at 10 years. Valve thrombosis developed in one patient 4 years after TVR. Color Doppler showed regurgitation in 7 of the 20 patients who were completely followed up, but they were all asymptomatic and required no special intervention. Cusp tear or calcification requiring reoperation was not observed in this study, including 8 patients younger than 35 years of age. The Vp was significantly slower, and PHT was significantly prolonged, in the tricuspid rather than the mitral position. These data demonstrate that bioprosthetic valves in the tricuspid position can be used safely. Doppler examination should be performed taking these different flow dynamics into account. 
5	Human ehrlichiosis: a rickettsial disease associated with severe cholestasis and multisystemic disease. We report an unusual case of a typically canine rickettsial disease, ehrlichiosis, in a 56-year-old man. Although only occasionally affecting humans with a mild illness, exposure to a tick bite in our patient led to severe multisystemic disease with intense cholestasis. Coma, acute renal failure and respiratory failure requiring mechanical ventilation ensued. Imaging procedures showed no biliary obstruction. A liver biopsy demonstrated bile stasis and sinusoidal lymphoid infiltrates. The diagnosis was confirmed serologically. Only partial improvement occurred with tetracycline therapy, but total resolution of all abnormalities eventually followed therapy with chloramphenicol. 
4	Circus movement atrial flutter in the canine sterile pericarditis model. Differential effects of procainamide on the components of the reentrant pathway. To evaluate the mechanisms of action of procainamide on the components of the reentrant pathway, drug-induced changes in activation patterns, effective refractory periods (ERPs), and stimulation thresholds were analyzed in nine dogs with sterile pericarditis and sustained atrial flutter. Activation maps were based on 127 close bipolar recordings from a special "jacket" electrode. From the control map, 22 +/- 2 sites covering the slow zone and the normal zone of the reentrant circuit were selected to measure ERPs and thresholds. The excitable gap was estimated from the longest ERP during pacing at the tachycardia cycle length. During atrial flutter, epicardial activation proceeded as a single wave around an arc of functional conduction block in the proximity of the atrioventricular (AV) ring or around a combined functional/anatomic obstacle, with the arc being contiguous with one of the venae cavae. An area of slow conduction, which accounted for 53 +/- 15% of the revolution time within 35 +/- 15% of the total length of the reentrant pathway, was bordered by the arc of block and the AV ring or a caval vein and the AV ring, respectively. Procainamide (5-10 mg/kg i.v.) prolonged the cycle length of atrial flutter from 144 +/- 17 to 190 +/- 24 msec (p less than 0.05) and then terminated the arrhythmia in all studies. The increase in cycle length was due to an increase in conduction time in the slow zone by 37 +/- 11 msec (86 +/- 17% of the total cycle length increase). During the last reentrant beat, conduction failed in the slow zone, with the arc of block joining the AV ring. At termination, procainamide had prolonged conduction time, stimulation threshold, and ERP in the normal zone by 11 +/- 18%, 40 +/- 80%, and 5 +/- 15%, respectively, compared with 51 +/- 16%, 86 +/- 93%, and 14 +/- 21%, respectively, in the slow zone (p less than 0.05 for all three parameters). The duration of the excitable gap did not change significantly. We conclude that procainamide preferentially affected the slow zone of single loop reentrant circuits. The drug terminated circus movement atrial flutter without abolishing the excitable gap, and its effect on conduction seemed the major determinant of the antiarrhythmic action. 
4	Alcohol consumption and blood pressure: a comparison of native Japanese to American men. We compared the cross-sectional association of alcohol consumption with blood pressure in 810 Japanese men (JM) living in Tokyo and 946 white men (WM) living in New York. Mean systolic (JM and WM, p less than 0.001) and diastolic blood pressure (JM, p less than 0.002; WM, p less than 0.001) were associated with alcohol consumption in both groups. Compared to abstainers, the heaviest drinkers had the highest systolic (JM, p = 0.001; WM, p less than 0.01) and diastolic (JM, p less than 0.002; WM, p less than 0.05) blood pressures. The relation of blood pressure to alcohol intake was J-shaped in the Americans, but linear in the Japanese. Exploratory analyses revealed that the J-shape may have been due to under-reporting of heavy alcohol ingestion by American abstainers. When abstainers were excluded, the relationships were similar in both the American and Japanese. The positive association between blood pressure and alcohol consumption persisted after adjustment for age, cigarette smoking, use of antihypertensive medications, body mass index, heart rate, abdominal skinfold thickness, hematocrit, fasting blood glucose, serum uric acid levels and urinary sodium/potassium ratio. Alcohol use was also related to prevalence of hypertension. These findings confirm the presence of an independent association between alcohol intake and blood pressure in both JM and WM and suggest that, despite differences in the metabolism of alcohol, the relation of alcohol consumption to blood pressure is similar in both nationalities. 
2	Plasma thrombin-antithrombin III complexes in the diagnosis of primary hepatocellular carcinoma complicating liver cirrhosis. Detection of hypercoagulable state might be helpful in the diagnosis of primary hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) complicating liver cirrhosis (LC). Plasma levels of thrombin-antithrombin III complex (TAT) were determined in 50 patients of LC with or without HCC. The levels were above 2 ng/ml in 80% of 25 HCC patients, but only in 12% of 25 non-HCC patients (P less than 0.01). The levels over 2 ng/ml occurred even in five of six HCC patients whose serum alpha-fetoprotein levels were below 20 ng/ml as well as in two of three patients with HCC less than 2 cm in diameter. Those levels in HCC patients were significantly decreased within 8 days after treatment with transcatheter arterial embolization or infusion of antitumor agents, without affecting plasma antithrombin III levels. These results suggest that plasma TAT levels may be useful in the diagnosis of HCC complicating LC. 
1	Effective destruction of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) 3 at 100 degrees C using the Semm cold coagulator: 14 years experience A total of 1628 women with CIN 3 treated with the Semm cold coagulator between 1975 and 1989 was followed primarily by cytology. The standard suitability criteria for ablation were adhered to except that patients were treated at their first visit when the colposcopist expected that the diagnosis would be no worse than CIN 3. Overall 97% of the women were treated at their first visit. In 30 women (2%) the histology was glandular or worse than expected, but 22 of these showed no persistent cervical disease subsequently. Follow-up was achieved for 87% at 10 years. In actuarial terms the primary success rate was 95% at 1 year and 92% at 5 years, it was similar for all age groups. Repeat cold-coagulation for persistent/recurrent CIN 3 was less successful and is not advised. The outcome for 226 pregnancies established after treatment is known. The rates for miscarriage, preterm or operative delivery were not increased. Cold-coagulation of CIN 3 at 100 degrees C as performed by us is as effective as any other treatment and calls into question the need for more expensive practices. 
3	Common headaches: type, duration, frequency and implications. Questionnaires completed by 327 preclinical medical and dental students showed that 97.9% had experienced headaches, most frequently attributed to insufficient sleep (38.8%), mental stress (38.8%), alcohol (38.5%), excess heat (36.7%), reading (31.5%), excess noise (29.9%) or light (27.7%), and sleeping too long (23.5%). The frequency and duration of these and other headaches are listed. 8% of the headache group had consulted a doctor. Only 2.1% of all students had never experienced a headache. Two hypotheses are examined: (1) can headaches be normal?--delineated by their disappearing soon after the noxious stimulus has ceased; (2) can pain in the head, as elsewhere in the body, act as a warning and therefore have protective, even survival value?. 
1	Correlation between hyperthermoradiosensitivity and clinical effect in carcinoma of the esophagus. The correlation between hyperthermoradiosensitivity evaluated by an in vitro succinate dehydrogenase inhibition (SDI) test and the histopathologic effects of hyperthermochemoradiotherapy (HCR therapy) were investigated in 43 patients with carcinoma of the esophagus. The succinate dehydrogenase (SD) activity of tissue fragments taken at biopsy was assayed after exposure to heat (43 degrees C.) and radiation (6 grays) was done. The sensitivity to radiation plus heat treatment was estimated by the percentage of SD activity of the treated cells, compared with that of the control cells. The 43 patients were divided into three groups according to the degree of SD activity after exposure to radiation plus heat treatment. The SD activity was less than 50 per cent in group 1 (highly sensitive), between 50 and 70 per cent in group 2 (moderately sensitive), more than 70 per cent in group 3 (less sensitive). Eighteen of 20 in group 1, 11 of 17 in group 2 and two of six in group 3 were classified as being histopathologically "effective" for HCR therapy. The two year survival rate for groups 1, 2 and 3 were 55.5, 34.9 and zero per cent, respectively, while there were no statistical differences with regard to prognostic factors. These data suggest that in vitro activities of SD correlate well with the clinical effectiveness of HCR therapy. Therefore, it is recommended that a SD inhibition test be included among the guidelines for clinical management.
