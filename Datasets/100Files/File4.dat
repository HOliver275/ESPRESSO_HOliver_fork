5	Gaucher's disease complicated by bleeding esophageal varices and colonic infiltration by Gaucher cells. We report a 10-yr-old child with Gaucher's disease who developed upper gastrointestinal bleeding from esophageal varices, as well as hemorrhage from a colonic polyp infiltrated with Gaucher cells. Both the varices and polyp were treated endoscopically, and the outcome was successful. Although gastrointestinal hemorrhage due to portal hypertension is considered a rare complication of Gaucher's disease, colonic infiltration with Gaucher cells has not been recognized previously. 
5	Quality of life in elderly, chronically ill outpatients. Quality of life (QL) in elderly outpatients is poorly characterized. We interviewed 258 elderly outpatients from three health care settings to identify the attributes and events that affect self-assessment of QL. These outpatients rated their QL as acceptable, citing medical care, health, interpersonal relationships, financial status, and functional status as affecting their QL. Overall QL ratings were not strongly associated with objective indicators such as demographic characteristics and use of health care services. Subjective indicators, including patient perceptions of health, memory, and financial concerns, were correlated independently with global QL (sigma R2 = .35). We conclude that older, chronically ill patients generally consider their QL to be acceptable and affected by a variety of factors, including their perceptions of their emotional, socioeconomic, intellectual, and physical functioning. Furthermore, QL is poorly associated with objective indicators. Thus, in assessing the QL of elderly, chronically ill outpatients, physicians should elicit information regarding these perceptions. 
4	Stunned myocardium and myocardial collagen damage: differential effects of single and repeated occlusions. It has been suggested that collagen loss and damage is responsible for the dysfunction seen in stunned myocardium. To test this hypothesis we compared collagen in canine hearts stunned by repeated occlusion with collagen in hearts stunned by a single occlusion. Regional contractile function was equally depressed in both groups: segment shortening at 1 hour after reperfusion averaged 37% +/- 9% versus 32% +/- 9% of preocclusion values in repeated and single occlusion models, respectively. Midmyocardial collagen content was not different in either single occlusion (10.5% +/- 0.4%) or repeated occlusion models (9.5% +/- 0.7%) when compared with nonischemic hearts (8.5 +/- 0.8%). Collagen damage, which was revealed with polarized light microscopy, was seen in 5 of 6 dogs after repeated occlusion but was not apparent after a single occlusion. Thus although both models of stunned myocardium produce similar dysfunction, there was no apparent collagen loss. Furthermore, collagen damage was only seen after repeated occlusion. Therefore it appears unlikely that collagen damage is a primary mechanism of stunned myocardium. 
1	Is urethral sparing at cystectomy a safe procedure? Urethrectomy is performed with cystectomy when the neoplasm is multifocal, at the bladder neck, or associated with carcinoma in situ (CIS). The records of the most recent 20 patients treated by radical cystectomy at our institution were reviewed. In 50 percent of the cases, the extent of disease within the bladder was found to have been underestimated to the point that a urethral sparing operation (i.e., to maintain urinary continence with an intestinal segment and an intact urethra) might have been dangerous. 
3	Strategies underlying the control of disordered movement. The purpose of this article is fourfold. First, a theory of motor control--the dual-strategy hypothesis--is outlined. Second, the methodologies and theoretical framework that are used to develop this theory are examined. Third, motor dysfunction is discussed in the context of this theory. In particular, Down syndrome, Parkinson's disease, cardiovascular accidents, and spasticity are discussed. Finally, potential applications of the theory to physical therapy are considered. 
5	The electrocardiogram in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. The electrocardiogram is often abnormal in patients who have chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. The most frequent abnormalities are a rightward P-wave axis (greater than or equal to 70 degrees) and a rightward QRS axis (greater than or equal to 90 degrees). In addition, low voltage in the limb leads, an S1S2S3 pattern, poor R-wave progression, a posterior-superior terminal QRS vector or other changes may be present. Transient atrial and ventricular dysrhythmias are common. Knowledge of the usual electrocardiographic manifestations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease enables the clinician to recognize uncharacteristic abnormalities, which often represent the effects of superimposed illnesses or drug toxicity. 
2	Granulomatous vasculitis in Crohn's disease [published erratum appears in Gastroenterology 1991 Aug;101(2):595] This study investigated a possible vascular origin for granulomas in Crohn's disease. Twenty-four consecutive resected specimens of small and large intestinal Crohn's disease were preserved by arterial perfusion-fixation with 10% formol saline, at mean arterial pressure (100 mm Hg). Fifteen specimens contained granulomas on routine examination of H&E-stained sections. These 15 specimens were examined in detail using a range of immunohistochemical staining techniques to identify vascular structures and granulomas. A total of 485 granulomas were found, 85% of which were identified as being directly involved in vascular injury. The majority (77%) of granulomas were deep to the mucosa; they were found most frequently in the submucosa (42%). The techniques used in this study enhanced the recognition of granulomatous vasculitis. The results suggest that the majority of granulomas in Crohn's disease form within walls of blood vessels. Vascular localization of granulomatous inflammation suggests that the intestinal microvasculature contains an early element in the pathogenesis of Crohn's disease. 
3	The contribution of median nerve SEPs in the functional assessment of the cervical spinal cord in syringomyelia. A study of 24 patients. Since the early study of Halliday and Wakefield (1963) it has generally been agreed that scalp somatosensory evoked potentials (SEPs) are normal in patients with dissociated loss of pain and temperature sensation. Up to now a few patients with abnormal spinal N13 and preserved scalp P14 and N20 have been reported in the literature, but there is no firm evidence, based on group data, that this dissociation can be related to any form of dissociated sensory loss. We studied median nerve SEPs in 24 patients with syringomyelia documented by CT scan or MRI. For the recording of the cervical N13 we used a Cv6 anterior cervical montage, which cancels the potentials generated above the foramen magnum and enhances the amplitude of N13. Scalp far-field and early cortical SEPs were recorded using a noncephalic reference electrode. Since N13 pathological changes are mainly changes in amplitude we measured the N13/P9 amplitude ratio in normal subjects and patients and found that it was a reliable index to quantify the amplitude decrease of N13. Absent or reduced N13 was observed in 40 median nerve SEPs (83%) in conjunction with normal P14 and N20 in 30 SEPs. Thus the dissociated loss of the cervical N13 was identified as the most conspicuous SEP feature in syringomyelia. A significant correlation was found between abnormal N13 and loss of pain and temperature sensations, whereas P14 abnormalities correlated well only with loss of joint and touch sensations. In the median nerve territory, sensation was either normal (6 cases) or lost only for pain and temperature (24 cases) when SEPs showed abnormal N13 and normal P14. Although it does not directly reflect the postsynaptic activity of spinal cells receiving their inputs from A delta and C fibres the N13 potential proved to be a reliable index of spinal cord grey matter dysfunction in syringomyelia. 
2	Persistent mullerian duct syndrome. Persistent mullerian syndrome is rare. A case of phenotypically normal male with persistent mullerian structures that consisted of a bicornuate uterus, fallopian tubes, and upper third of the vagina is reported. These unusual structures were found in association with bilateral cryptorchidism and a right inguinal hernia, and were diagnosed while repairing the hernia in the neonatal period. The uterus and fallopian tubes were removed via laparotomy when the child was eighteen months old; at the same time a bilateral orchiopexy was performed. To avoid damage to the vas deferens, which lay in closely to the mullerian structures and could not be separated from the vaginal wall, a small segment of the upper third of the vagina was retained. The testicles, although normal on pathologic examination, have shown poor response to hormonal stimulation with human chorionic gonadotropin. Long-term follow-up for these patients is necessary because they have an increased risk of testicular tumors developing. 
3	Myasthenia gravis. Myasthenia Gravis is a disorder of neuromuscular function resulting from an immunologically based premature destruction of acetylcholine receptors. The disease is characterized clinically by variable weakness accentuated by repetitive muscular activity and usually responding to the administration of acetylcholinesterase inhibitors. Myasthenia Gravis is a complex disease and requires understanding of the many facets of its natural history and immunological basis to ensure optimal individual patient management. The long-term goal is control of the immunological imbalance; treatment regimens include thymectomy, corticosteroids, azathioprine, and plasmapheresis. The common use of acetylcholinesterase inhibitors provides symptomatic relief during variable daily muscular activity. Disability due to myasthenia gravis is to a large extent reversible and death is preventable. Early recognition of myasthenia gravis and appropriate treatment are often rewarded by remission that may be permanent. 
1	Muscle fibre type and habitual snoring. Although anatomical abnormalities of the upper airway have been recorded in some patients with obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA), a muscle tone dysregulation also seems to have an important role in this disorder. Since habitual snoring is the initial stage of OSA, the structural characteristics of upper airway muscles (medium pharyngeal constrictor muscle [MPCM]) from 13 men (9 non-snorers and 4 habitual snorers) were studied. MPCM fibre structure in non-snorers was broadly similar to that in normal limb muscles, with the exception that fibre diameters were smaller for all fibre types. Compared with limb muscles, MPCM had a smaller proportion of type IIb fibres and a higher proportion of types I and IIa fibres. MPCM in habitual snorers had an abnormal distribution of fibre types (low percentage of type I and type IIb fibres and high percentage of type IIa fibres) compared with non-snorers (p less than 0.001) and the type IIa fibres were hypertrophic. No myopathic or neurogenic changes were seen. Two possible hypotheses explain the abnormal distribution of fibre types in snorers. First, a constitutionally determined reduction of slow alpha-motor neurons induces an adaptive transformation of type IIb to type IIa fibres and a hypertrophy of type IIa fibres; or, second, motor neurons change their patterns of discharge and, hence, of activation, and modify fibre-type distribution of MPCM as an adaptation to the anatomical characteristic of upper airway and habitual snoring. 
1	Improved scintigraphic assessment of severe cholestasis with the hepatic extraction fraction. In previous studies, we found that biliary scintigraphy with technetium-99m-labeled iminodiacetic acid ([99mTc]IDA) provided excellent discrimination between intrahepatic and extrahepatic cholestasis, except in patients with profound cholestasis who had poor visualization of the biliary tree. In this study, we have used deconvolution analysis to determine the hepatic extraction fraction (HEF) of a hypothetical single circulatory pass of [99mTc]IDA. Our hypothesis was that extraction of radionuclide from the blood would be normal in patients with extrahepatic obstruction alone, but would be impaired in patients with intrahepatic disease (IHD). The purpose of this study was to compare the HEF in patients with profound cholestasis (bilirubin greater than or equal to 3.0 mg/dl) due to either IHD or common bile duct obstruction (CBDO). Normal subjects (N = 13) had an HEF of 100%. Patients with CBDO (N = 13) had slightly reduced HEF values (92.8 +/- 3.2%) despite profound hyperbilirubinemia (6.1 +/- 1.0 mg/dl). Patients with IHD (N = 23) had a markedly reduced HEF (43.1 +/- 4.1%) which was significantly lower than patients with CBDO and normal subjects (P less than 0.001). We conclude that the determination of the HEF during biliary scintigraphy is helpful in distinguishing between intrahepatic and extrahepatic disease in patients with hyperbilirubinemia (bilirubin greater than or equal to 3.0 mg/dl). 
5	1990 Volvo Award in clinical sciences. Lumbar spinal pathology in cadaveric material in relation to history of back pain, occupation, and physical loading. The occurrence of symmetric disc degeneration, anular ruptures, end-plate defects, vertebral body osteophytosis, and facet joint osteoarthrosis was examined radiographically and osteologically in 86 male cadavers for whom occupational, physical loading, and back pain histories were obtained from the men's families. History of back pain and the parameters of spinal pathology were related to the highest and lowest degrees of physical loading. In multivariate analyses, history of back injury was related to the occurrence of symmetric disc degeneration, anular ruptures, and vertebral osteophytosis. Symmetric disc degeneration was associated with sedentary work, and vertebral osteophytosis was related to heavy work. History of back pain was related to occupational physical loading after control for the effects of the other covariates. The results indicate that the least pathology stemmed from moderate or mixed physical loading, but the least back pain was associated with sedentary work. 
4	A forme fruste of Marfan's syndrome: case history. A thirty nine year old woman presented with multiple aneurysms and dissections of the arterial system secondary to cystic medial necrosis is presented. After assessment of the family history a diagnosis of a forme fruste of Marfan's syndrome was made. Preoperative consideration of this rare diagnosis is important for treatment and surgical management. 
4	Comparison of intravenous amrinone and dobutamine in congestive heart failure due to idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy. A prospective randomized study was performed in 46 consecutive patients with refractory congestive heart failure (CHF) due to idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy to compare the hemodynamic responses to 48-hour infusions of amrinone and dobutamine. Both drugs substantially reduced pulmonary arterial wedge pressure, right atrial pressure and systemic vascular resistance and increased cardiac index. Amrinone caused a greater decrease in right atrial pressure than dobutamine (p less than 0.02) and had a positive chronotropic effect not observed with dobutamine (p less than 0.01). The increase in heart rate produced by amrinone correlated inversely with the changes in right atrial and pulmonary arterial wedge pressures, suggesting a baroreceptor response to reduced preload. Dobutamine produced a larger increase in stroke volume index than amrinone (p less than 0.01). Ninety-one percent of patients receiving amrinone and only 65% receiving dobutamine had reduction of greater than or equal to 30% in pulmonary arterial wedge pressure (p less than 0.05). Cardiac index increased greater than or equal to 30% in similar numbers of patients given amrinone (74%) and dobutamine (65%). Negative fluid balance was recorded in all patients receiving amrinone and in 78% of patients receiving dobutamine (p less than 0.05). Target hemodynamic criteria were achieved in 83% of patients receiving 10 micrograms/kg/min of amrinone. The effective maintenance dose of dobutamine was extremely variable. No clinically important adverse effects were observed with either drug regimen. Both amrinone and dobutamine are effective and safe agents for short-term parenteral therapy of patients with dilated cardiomyopathy in severe CHF that is unresponsive to oral medication. 
4	Protecting the vasculature: an eye toward the future. Although calcium antagonists were originally developed for use in the management of patients with angina pectoris, they are now used in the management of other cardiovascular disorders, including hypertension. More recently, the calcium antagonists have been under investigation for their potential protective role in atherosclerosis. Coupled with these new possibilities for therapeutic use are the development of new, long-acting, tissue-specific calcium antagonists. Amlodipine belongs to this group, and although it is a dihydropyridine-based calcium antagonist, its pharmacologic profile differs from that of other dihydropyridine-based calcium antagonists. Differences include: different pH optimum for receptor binding, different rates of association and dissociation, and differences in allosteric interaction with the diltiazem and verapamil binding sites. Amlodipine, when given orally to rabbits receiving a high-cholesterol diet, reduces atheroma formation. Evidence of its ability to protect the vasculature is provided by its ability to significantly increase (p less than 0.001) survival in stroke-prone hypertensive rats. 
4	Hypertension and acculturation in elderly Mexican Americans: results from 1982-84 Hispanic HANES. The purpose of our study was to describe the relationship between acculturation and hypertension in elderly Mexican Americans. Two age groups, 55-64 and 65-74, were examined from data provided in the Hispanic Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (HHANES). The prevalence of hypertension among subgroups of different acculturation was ascertained based on the modified Cuellar Acculturation Scale. Each age group was also stratified using the HHANES poverty index, with those above the index compared to those below. A stepwise logistic regression was performed among the variables of poverty, gender, age, and acculturation in relation to hypertension. The results indicate that acculturation and age are stronger predictors of hypertension than poverty in elderly Mexican Americans, with acculturation being a stronger predictor among those age 55-64. Factors related to acculturation may have a stronger influence on the prevalence of hypertension in older Mexican Americans than differences related to socioeconomic status. 
1	Endoscopic palliative intubation of the esophagus invaded by lung cancer. Thirty-two patients with esophageal involvement by lung cancer were managed by endoscopic intubation. In 22 patients with extrinsic esophageal strictures, the success rate of intubation was 91%, and 82% were discharged with their dysphagia relieved and esophageal patency restored. The mean survival rate was 4.4 months. In 10 patients with esophago-bronchial fistulas, 3 had the fistulous tract obliterated and lived a mean of 5 months. This low success rate of closing fistulas is due to failure to seal off the space between the stent and the fistula because of absence of tumor-associated stenosis. The overall morbidity rate was 28.1% (18.8% perforation, 6.3% hemorrhage, and 3.1% tracheal obstruction). The overall mortality rate was 18.8%. Although complications were more frequent than in primary esophageal tumors, endoscopic intubation was the only way to palliate this desperate condition and provided 66.6% of patients with relief of symptoms, nutritional improvement, and a mean survival time of 4.5 months. 
4	Reactivity of eccentric and concentric coronary stenoses in patients with chronic stable angina. Dynamic coronary stenoses may be the cause of a variable angina threshold and rest angina in patients with chronic stable angina. It has been suggested that eccentric but not concentric coronary artery stenoses have the potential for dynamic changes of caliber in response to vasoactive stimuli. The vasomotor response of eccentric (asymmetric narrowing) and concentric (symmetric narrowing) coronary stenoses to ergonovine (20 micrograms intracoronary or 300 micrograms intravenous) and isosorbide dinitrate (1 mg intracoronary) was studied in 51 patients with chronic stable angina. Diameter of reference segments (angiographically normal segments proximal to the stenoses) and that of eccentric (n = 30) and concentric (n = 35) coronary stenoses that ranged from 50% to 90% luminal diameter reduction were measured by computerized quantitative angiography before and after ergonovine and isosorbide dinitrate. Ergonovine reduced stenosis diameter (by greater than or equal to 10%) in 80% of eccentric stenoses and 42% of concentric stenoses (p less than 0.05). Mean (+/- SEM) diameter reduction with ergonovine was 19 +/- 3% and 9.5 +/- 2% for eccentric and concentric stenoses, respectively (p less than 0.05). Isosorbide dinitrate increased coronary diameter (by greater than or equal to 10%) in 70% of eccentric and 43% of concentric stenoses (p less than 0.05). Mean diameter of eccentric stenoses increased from 1.15 +/- 0.05 to 1.35 +/- 0.06 mm after nitrate (18.6 +/- 2.5%), whereas diameter of concentric stenoses increased from 1.05 +/- 0.05 to 1.14 +/- 0.05 mm (10 +/- 2.5%) (p less than 0.05). Average dilation of reference segments with administration of isosorbide dinitrate and constriction with ergonovine were not significantly different in patients with concentric and eccentric stenoses. 
1	Tissue distribution of 2-3 and 2-6 sialyl Lewis A antigens and significance of the ratio of two antigens for the differential diagnosis of malignant and benign disorders of the digestive tract. The authors investigated the tissue distribution of two kinds of sialylated derivatives of Lewis A (Le(a)) antigen in patients with cancers of the digestive system using specific monoclonal antibodies, and evaluated the significance of determining the 2-3 and 2-6 sialylated Le(a) antigen levels for the diagnosis of cancer. In most specimens from patients with cancers of the pancreas, biliary tract, stomach, and colon, the 2-3 sialylated Le(a) antigen was strongly expressed in cancer cells. However, 2-6 sialylated Le(a) antigen was less frequently expressed in cancer cells. The former is therefore more specific to cancer than the latter. Also, the serum level of the 2-3 sialylated Le(a) antigen was significantly higher than that of the 2-6 counterpart in patients with cancers of pancreas, biliary tract, stomach, and colon. The resulting ratio of serum 2-3/2-6 sialylated Le(a) antigens was frequently high in patients with malignancy and was low in patients with benign disorders of these digestive organs. Therefore, the 2-3/2-6 sialylated Le(a) antigen ratio is a useful for the differential diagnosis of malignant disorders in these organs. However, liver disorders were found to be exceptional in that both antigens were mostly absent in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cells in immunohistologic examination, as well as in nonmalignant parenchymal liver cells. Only the epithelial cells of the intrahepatic bile ducts expressed the 2-6 sialylated Le(a) antigen strongly, and expressed the 2-3 sialylated Le(a) antigen moderately. The levels of both antigens were sometimes high in patients with liver disorders, but the ratio always remained low in patients with HCC as well as benign liver disorders such as cirrhosis or chronic hepatitis. The sialylated Le(a) antigens, which sometimes accumulate in the sera of patients with HCC, were concluded to originate from the epithelial cells of the proliferating small bile ducts, and those serum antigens cannot be considered as evidence for the presence of liver cancer cells. 
4	Electrocardiographic signs of atrial overload in hypertensive patients: indexes of abnormality of atrial morphology or function? Left atrial electrocardiographic (ECG) abnormalities have been reported as common findings in hypertension; however, their relationships with atrial anatomy are still uncertain. In addition, in arterial hypertension several studies demonstrated an abnormal left ventricular filling. The aim of this study was to investigate the relationships of the ECG signs of left atrial abnormality to atrial anatomy and left ventricular filling as evaluated by pulsed-wave (PW) Doppler in a group of patients with uncomplicated essential hypertension. To this end, 53 untreated essential hypertensive patients (age 44 +/- 8 years; blood pressure 160.5 +/- 21.5/104.7 +/- 13.5 mm Hg) underwent a complete 12-lead ECG and a PW Doppler study of the transmitral flow velocities. The ECG criteria of left atrial abnormality were: P wave wider than 0.12 (or 0.10) second or higher than 0.25 mV in lead II; P wave/PR segment ratio (Macruz index) greater than 1.6 in lead II; and P wave terminal forces in lead V1 equal to or more negative than 0.04. Echocardiographic measurements were made according to American Society of Echocardiography (ASE) convention. Doppler parameters of left ventricular filling were measured as E and A peak velocity, A/E ratio, and the ratio between the velocity-time integral under the E peak and that of the whole diastolic flow, which represents the rapid filling fraction (RFF). At least one ECG sign of atrial abnormality was present in 34 patients (64%); the Macruz index gave the most common ECG index of atrial abnormality (31 patients). 
1	Rhinosporidiosis associated with squamous cell carcinoma in the tongue. The peritumoural region of a squamous cell carcinoma of the tongue when examined with light and electron microscope showed nodular bodies in the submucosa with all the distinctive features of 'sporangium and 'spores' of rhinosporidiosis. The occurrence of rhinosporidiosis in the tongue along with malignancy has not been reported hitherto. Some interesting observations and causal relationships are discussed. 
3	Effect of age on the efficacy of blood pressure treatment strategies. To study whether the proportion of excess cardiovascular events attributable to various levels of systolic blood pressure varies with age, we calculated the population-attributable risk of all-cause mortality, fatal and nonfatal cardiovascular events (stroke, coronary heart disease, angina, congestive heart failure, and peripheral vascular disease), and stroke incidence due to systolic blood pressure in men and women 45 years of age or older in the United States during 1980. Our estimates are based on US census counts, blood pressure prevalence distributions from the second National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, and the annual risk of cardiovascular complications during 18 years of follow-up in the Framingham cohort. We then determined the impact of age on the relative efficacy of mass treatment and case-finding strategies in preventing systolic blood pressure-related events. At 45-54 years of age, only 30-40% of systolic blood pressure-related excess events occur in hypertensive individuals (systolic blood pressure greater than or equal to 160 mm Hg). With increasing age, however, the percentage of systolic blood pressure-related events that occur in hypertensive individuals rose substantially; in the older age group (greater than or equal to 75 years), 65-70% of fatal and nonfatal cardiovascular disease events occur in hypertensive persons. The pattern is similar for men and women. The potential impact of a mass treatment strategy designed to shift the distribution of blood pressure downward by a small amount is greater in younger than in older groups, whereas an opposite trend is seen for a high-risk, hypertensive case-finding and treatment approach. 
1	Lip paresthesia associated with a jaw mass. A case is reported in which mandibular swelling and lower lip numbness were the first signs of a metastatic adenocarcinoma of the lung. The development of paresthesia, with or without other oral symptoms, requires that a diagnosis of malignancy be considered until confirmed or ruled out by tissue biopsy. A thorough head and neck examination in all patients, especially in those whose history or habits may indicate increased risk of malignancy is necessary. 
5	Diagnosis and treatment of pneumonia in the surgical intensive care unit [published erratum appears in Surg Gynecol Obstet 1991 Apr;172(4):324] It is often difficult to detect the onset of parenchymal pulmonary infection (pneumonia) in a surgical intensive care unit (SICU) setting. Clinical and laboratory parameters that usually indicate the presence of pneumonia, such as fever, elevated white blood cell count and abnormal sputum culture, may also be present in patients with nonpneumonic infection. Prompt diagnosis is particularly important for patients in SICU because the mortality rate associated with pneumonia in these patients may be as high as 50 per cent. In the SICU setting, pneumonia is best diagnosed using well-defined roentgenologic criteria. Treatment should consist of a broad-spectrum antibiotic regimen to which all sputum pathogens are sensitive. Such a regimen significantly reduces the mortality rate for patients with pneumonia in an SICU setting. Aztreonam has been found to be as effective against susceptible gram-negative bacilli as traditional agents, such as the aminoglycosides, and to have a significantly milder side effect profile. 
2	Management of childhood diarrhoea by pharmacists and parents: is Britain lagging behind the Third World? OBJECTIVE--To investigate the role of community pharmacists in providing advice and treatment for children with diarrhoea; to investigate mothers' responses to diarrhoea in their children. DESIGN--Cross sectional questionnaire study of a random selection of community pharmacists and of mothers attending child health clinics. Pharmacists were interviewed and given a questionnaire and a separate group was visited by a researcher posing as a parent; mothers were interviewed at the clinic. SETTING--Newcastle upon Tyne. SUBJECTS--20 pharmacists were interviewed and visits by a researcher posing as a parent were carried out to 10 different pharmacists; 58 mothers were interviewed. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES--Advice given by pharmacists was contrasted with standard advice on management of diarrhoea in children. RESULTS--Half of the pharmacists interviewed and 70% of pharmacists visited by a researcher posing as a parent recommended inappropriate treatment of childhood diarrhoea (such as antidiarrhoeal drugs and withholding breast milk), and only 30% at interview stated that they would ask for the age of the child. Mothers' knowledge of home treatment was inadequate. All pharmacists in the posed visits recommended a purchased treatment. CONCLUSION--Pharmacists are widely used by parents for consultation for children's ailments but their advice is not always appropriate; hence they should be given more consistent training in recognising and managing clinical problems. Medical advice on management of diarrhoea is also inconsistent and should be modified to conform to the guidelines of the World Health Organisation. 
1	Continuous muscle fiber activity, peripheral neuropathy, and thymoma. Two patients, one of them with myasthenia gravis, presented symptoms of continuous muscle fiber activity syndrome before discovery of a thymoma. Peripheral neuropathy was present in both patients, with axonal and demyelinating lesions in sural nerve biopsy. The syndrome remained unchanged or worse after thymectomy. Both patients died of associated complications. 
5	Exacerbation of bacterial toxicity to infant ferrets by influenza virus: possible role in sudden infant death syndrome [published erratum appears in J Infect Dis 1991 Jul;164(1):232] Of several toxins examined, only staphylococcal alpha and gamma toxin, endotoxin, and diphtheria toxins were lethal for 5-day-old ferrets. Their toxicities were enhanced in animals infected at 1 day old with influenza virus, from 3-fold with staphylococcal gamma toxin through 14-fold for staphylococcal alpha toxin, 84-fold for endotoxin, and 219-fold for diphtheria toxin. No increased viral replication occurred in any tissue; thus the effects of the toxins were exacerbated by the infection, not vice versa. Neonates died suddenly without clinical symptoms as in human babies dying from the sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS). Pathologic examination showed inflammation in the upper respiratory tract, lung edema and collapse, and early bronchopneumonia in the toxin- and influenza virus-treated animals but not in those treated with toxin or virus alone. Thus, bacterial toxins could play a role in SIDS, this being more likely with a concomitant influenza virus infection. 
1	Lymphocyte subset distribution after radiation therapy for cancer of the uterine cervix. Possible prognostic implications and correlation with disease course. An analysis of lymphocyte subpopulations was done in patients with cancer of the uterine cervix before and at different intervals after the commencement of radiation therapy. A common feature was a duration of T-cell and B-cell lymphopenia after therapy. The findings relating to the T-cell subsets were interesting. Although the CD4/CD8 ratio remained unchanged in Stages I/IIA for 24 months after treatment, patients with Stages IIB and III showed a lowering of the ratio immediately after treatment. Distinctive patterns of lymphocyte subset distribution were seen in a comparison between patients who were disease-free and those with recurrent disease. The CD4+ cell counts and CD4/CD8 ratio differed between the two groups, with consistent lowered values during the follow-up associated with recurrent disease. This study demonstrates the effects of radiation therapy in altering lymphocyte subset distribution, resulting in characteristic patterns which could be used as clinical and prognostic indicators. 
1	Structural and ultrastructural study of the ovary in childhood leukemia after successful treatment. Ovarian biopsy specimens from ten girls (three postmenarcheal) who had undergone antiblastic treatment for acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) and were in complete remission were examined by light microscope. The biopsy specimens from four of these patients (three postmenarcheal) were also observed by electron microscope. The structural and ultrastructural analysis showed a reduction in the number of follicles which were otherwise normal. No follicles were found in the thin sections from two of the three postmenarcheal girls, whereas normal follicles were observed in the third. The cortical stroma showed moderate to severe signs of fibrosis and changes of capillaries. All of these alterations were more evident in patients where ALL was diagnosed at an older age and this finding suggests that they are at a higher risk for low fertility or early menopause. 
4	Beta-lactam resistance mechanisms of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus. In vitro and in vivo activity of amoxicillin and penicillin G alone or combined with a penicillinase inhibitor (clavulanate) were tested against five isogenic pairs of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) producing or not producing penicillinase. Loss of the penicillinase plasmid caused an eight times or greater reduction in the MICs of amoxicillin and penicillin G (from greater than or equal to 64 to 8 micrograms/ml), but not of the penicillinase-resistant drugs methicillin and cloxacillin (greater than or equal to 64 micrograms/ml). This difference in antibacterial effectiveness correlated with a more than 10 times greater penicillin-binding protein 2a affinity of amoxicillin and penicillin G than of methicillin and a greater than or equal to 90% successful amoxicillin treatment of experimental endocarditis due to penicillinase-negative MRSA compared with cloxacillin, which was totally ineffective (P less than .001). Amoxicillin was also effective against penicillinase-producing parent MRSA, provided it was combined with clavulanate. Penicillinase-sensitive beta-lactam antibiotics plus penicillinase inhibitors might offer a rational alternative treatment for MRSA infections. 
2	Incidence of large oesophageal varices in patients with cirrhosis: application to prophylaxis of first bleeding. Because several studies have suggested that beta blockers are effective in the prophylaxis of first variceal bleeding in cirrhosis, screening for oesophageal varices might be appropriate. We prospectively studied 84 cirrhotic patients without obvious evidence of large oesophageal varices and previous bleeding during a mean follow up of 16 months. At entry to the study 41 patients had no oesophageal varices and in 43 these were grade 1. The subsequent percentages of patients without large oesophageal varices were 74% at one year and 52% at two years. Univariate analysis showed that a longer duration of cirrhosis (p less than 0.05) and grade 1 oesophageal varices at entry (p less than 0.001) were predictive factors for the occurrence of large oesophageal varices, whereas, multivariate analysis showed that the initial size of the oesophageal varices (p less than 0.001), a high initial Child-Pugh score, and a smaller improvement in Child-Pugh score during the study were independent risk factors. Among patients with grades 0 and 1 oesophageal varices at the start of the study the proportions with large oesophageal varices at two years were 31% and 70% respectively. We have calculated that, accepting a maximum risk of first bleeding of 10% without prophylactic treatment, a patient without oesophageal varices should be screened endoscopically every other year, while a patient with grade 1 disease should benefit from one annual upper gastrointestinal endoscopy. 
5	Nicardipine reduces the cardio-respiratory toxicity of intravenously administered bupivacaine in rats. The purpose of our study was to examine the effect of intravenous (IV) nicardipine pretreatment (30 micrograms.kg-1), given three minutes before an IV bolus of bupivacaine to determine its effect on the incidence of fatal bupivacaine cardio-respiratory toxicity in adult male Sprague Dawley rats anaesthetized with intraperitoneal pentobarbital. Fifty rats were divided into four groups. Groups I and II (n = 10 each) received 3.5 mg.kg-1 0.5 per cent bupivacaine and Groups III and IV (n = 15 each) received 5.0 mg.kg-1, 0.5 per cent bupivacaine. Groups I and III received pretreatment with normal saline before bupivacaine, whereas Groups II and IV were given pretreatment with nicardipine, 30 mg.kg-1. There was no difference in the incidence of survival between the nicardipine pretreatment group and the saline placebo pretreatment group given 3.5 mg.kg-1, 0.5 per cent bupivacaine (no fatalities in either group). However, there was significant protection by nicardipine pretreatment in the group given 5 mg.kg-1, 0.5 per cent bupivacaine (13 of 15 survived, compared with only 4 of 15 in the saline pretreatment group, P less than 0.001). In conclusion, our data demonstrate that in rats given 0.5 per cent bupivacaine, 5 mg.kg-1, nicardipine pretreatment protected against fatal cardio-respiratory toxicity. 
4	Impairment of cerebral autoregulation during the development of chronic cerebral vasospasm after subarachnoid hemorrhage in primates. We studied the impairment of autoregulation of cerebral blood flow (CBF) and its effect on the electrical activity of the brain during the development of chronic cerebral vasospasm after subarachnoid hemorrhage, using a vasospasm model in primates. Fourteen animals were divided into two groups: a clot group (8) and a sham-operated group (6). To induce subarachnoid hemorrhage, all the animals underwent craniectomy, and in the clot group, the autologous blood clot was located around the arteries dissected free from the arachnoid membrane. Cerebral angiography was performed before subarachnoid hemorrhage and 7 days after (Day 7). On Day 7, regional CBF in the parietal lobe--measured by the hydrogen clearance method--and central conduction time were studied during either graded hypertension or hypotension. In the clot group, the mean vessel caliber of the cerebral arteries on the right side (clot side) of the circle of Willis showed significant (P less than 0.01) reduction (more than 40%) as compared with the values on the contralateral, non-clot side. The values for the bilateral parietal CBF in the sham-operated group and the left parietal CBF in the clot group were fairly constant when the mean arterial blood pressure (MABP) was in the range of 60 to 160 mm Hg. In the clot group, right parietal CBF was significantly (P less than 0.05) smaller than that on the left side at an MABP level of 40 to 100 mm Hg, and increased at an MABP level of 180 mm Hg. The right parietal CBF increased as the arterial blood pressure increased, showing impairment of autoregulation. 
1	Pancreatic carcinoma in an elderly woman with an organic affective disorder and AIDS delusion. An elderly woman with symptoms of depression and an AIDS delusion was found also to have pancreatic carcinoma. I have discussed her case in conjunction with organic affective disorder, the evaluation of depression in the elderly, and suicide in the elderly. 
5	Fistulas between the aorta and tracheobronchial tree. Aortobronchial fistula is a rare condition that is invariably fatal if not diagnosed and surgically treated. With appropriate surgical intervention, survival rates greater than 70% can be achieved. A review of the literature and an illustrative case report are presented. A total of 63 fistulas in 62 patients have been described. The case we present is unusual in the use of serratus anterior muscle for repair of the fistula. Eighty-seven percent of the cases documented in the literature were associated with an aneurysm of the thoracic aorta. Eighty-six percent of the fistulas were between the descending aorta and left bronchopulmonary tree. More than 95% of patients experienced at least a single episode of hemoptysis, and massive hemoptysis occurred in more than half of the reported cases. A correct preoperative diagnosis was made in only 54% of cases. Plain chest radiographs definitively demonstrated an aneurysm in only 16%. The computed tomographic scan was the most rewarding test, identifying an aneurysm in 11 of 12 patients and the fistula in 50% of them. Surgical repair resulted in a 76% survival rate. 
5	Control of immediate postoperative pain with topical bupivacaine hydrochloride for laparoscopic Falope ring tubal ligation. Conflicting reports exist in the literature on the effectiveness of topical local anesthetic applied to the serosal surface of the fallopian tubes for the control of immediate postoperative pain after mechanical (band or clip) tubal ligation. Sixty-four patients were studied prospectively during outpatient laparoscopic Falope ring tubal ligation using the modified McGill Present Pain Intensity Scale. Patients randomly assigned to four groups received topical bupivacaine hydrochloride on both fallopian tubes, the right tube only, or the left tube only, or received none (controls). A unique study design was incorporated which allowed the untreated fallopian tube to serve as a within-subject control for each patient receiving unilateral treatment. Statistical analysis confirmed significant benefit when both fallopian tubes were treated as compared with no treatment (P less than .05). There was also consistent evidence of decreased immediate postoperative pain perception on the treated side for patients receiving unilateral treatment. The value of topical bupivacaine was demonstrated by both subjective patient response (McGill Pain Scale) and reduced need for pain medication before outpatient discharge. Our data support the value of topical bupivacaine applied to the serosal surface of the fallopian tubes for the reduction of postoperative pain after outpatient laparoscopic mechanical (band or clip) tubal ligation. 
1	Positive results of combined therapy of surgery and intraperitoneal hyperthermic perfusion for far-advanced gastric cancer. To evaluate the clinical efficacy of intraperitoneal hyperthermic perfusion (IPHP) for far-advanced gastric cancer, particularly with peritoneal seeding, we investigated the survival times of 59 patients who underwent distal subtotal gastrectomy, total gastrectomy, or total gastrectomy combined with concomitant resection of some of the remaining intra-abdominal organs. In all the 30 patients given IPHP, no cancer cells were present posthyperthermically in the lavage from the Douglas pouch. The 30 patients given IPHP lived longer than the 29 patients not given IPHP (p = 0.001), with a 1-year survival rate of 80.4% in the former group compared to 34.2% in the latter. With respect to a comparison of survival time of patients with peritoneal seeding, 7 patients not given IPHP had a 6-month survival rate of 57.1% and did not survive more than 9 months, whereas 20 patients given IPHP had 1- and 2-year survival rates of 78.7% and 45.0%, respectively; here the difference was significant (p = 0.001). The IPHP and control groups without peritoneal metastasis included 10 and 22 patients, respectively, and the 1-year survival rates are 85.4% and 45.3%, respectively. The survival rates of the former exceeded those of the latter, with p = 0.015 by the generalized Wilcoxon test. Thus this combined therapy offers the promise of extended survival for patients with far-advanced gastric cancer. 
5	Ileal pouch-anal anastomosis. Reoperation for pouch-related complications. The aim was to assess the value of reoperative surgery for pouch-related complications after ileal pouch-anal anastomosis (IPAA) for chronic ulcerative colitis and familial adenomatous polyposis. Between January 1981 and August 1989, 114 of 982 IPAA patients (12%) seen at the Mayo Clinic had complications directly related to IPAA that required reoperation. Among the 114 patients, the complications prevented initial ileostomy closure in 33 patients (25%), occurred after ileostomy closure in 68 patients (60%), and delayed ileostomy closure in the remaining patients. The salvage procedures performed included anal dilatation under anesthesia for anastomotic strictures, placement of setons and/or fistulotomy for perianal fistulae, unroofing of anastomotic sinuses, simple drainage and antibiotics for perianal abscesses, abdominal exploration with drainage of intra-abdominal abscesses with or without establishment of ileostomy, and complete or partial reconstruction of the reservoir for patients with inadequate emptying. None of the reoperated patients died. Reoperation led to restoration of pouch function in two thirds of patients and, of these, 70% had an excellent clinical outcome. However approximately 20% of the 114 pouches required excision. Excision was common, especially among patients who had pelvic sepsis. Salvage procedures for pouch-specific complications can be done safely and will restore pouch function in two thirds of patients. Complications after reoperation, however, may ultimately lead to loss of the reservoir in one in five patients. 
1	Evaluation of a simple line width test involving magnetic resonance spectroscopy of plasma in carcinoma of the ovary. Magnetic resonance spectroscopic (MRS) measurement of human plasma has been reported as a generally applicable marker for malignancy: patients with malignancy had a MRS line width significantly different from patients with benign diseases or healthy controls. The authors investigated the value of this test in 213 women with ovarian carcinoma, benign pelvic masses, benign nongynecologic diseases, and healthy controls. The MRS measurements were performed on plasma samples at 21 degrees C or 27 degrees C. The line width parameters were obtained by averaging the width at half the height of the methyl and methylene peaks on the resonance spectra. At 27 degrees C using 33 Hz as the threshold for an abnormal result, there was a significant correlation between the result of the test and the presence or absence of malignancy. However, the study demonstrates that the specificity (0.44) and positive predictive value (0.42) are too low for the test to be useful in the management of patients with carcinoma of the ovary. At 21 degrees C no correlation between the results of the test and the clinical status of women with carcinoma of the ovary were observed. In 47 patients the test did not predict preoperatively the benign or malignant nature of a pelvic mass. 
5	Long-term course of patients with persistent hypercalcitoninemia after apparent curative primary surgery for medullary thyroid carcinoma. Thirty-one patients with persistent hypercalcitoninemia after seemingly adequate primary operation for medullary thyroid carcinoma (MTC) were followed for a mean period of 11.9 years after operation. Ten patients had sporadic MTC and the remaining patients were members of families with multiple endocrine neoplasia (MEN)--either MEN 2A (15 patients) or MEN 2B (six patients). Overall 5- and 10-year survival rates were 90% and 86%, respectively. Only four patients died at the completion of the study: two of MTC and two of unrelated causes. Eleven patients (35.5%) underwent surgical re-exploration after demonstration of recurrent disease clinically or radiologically. In no patient did the calcitonin level return to normal after re-exploration. The presence of more than three metastatic nodes at the time of initial operation was a statistically significant (p = 0.003) predictor for disease recurrence. Factors approaching statistical significance were patients younger than age 35 (p = 0.06) and the percentage of cells in the S phase of cell division (0.07). This data supports a conservative surgical philosophy in the management of the patient with persistent hypercalcitoninemia after resection of MTC. 
5	Anti-Kveim monoclonal antibody. New monoclonal antibody reacting to epithelioid cells in sarcoid granulomas. A monoclonal antibody to the sarcoid granulomagenic agent contained in Kveim suspension was prepared by immunizing mice with Kveim suspension. One monoclonal antibody (IHY-1) that reacted with the epithelioid cells in sarcoid granulomas on immunoperoxidase technique was selected. The immunoperoxidase technique was used to compare this monoclonal antibody's binding to sarcoidosis- or tuberculosis-affected lymph nodes. IHY-1 is a monoclonal antibody of IgM class. This antibody did not react to erythrocytes, lymphocytes, monocytes, alveolar macrophages, or the macrophage-derived cell lines such as U-973 and KG-1. It reacted to granuloma epithelioid cells of sarcoidosis-affected lymph nodes. The monoclonal antibody also reacted positively to epithelioid cells in tuberculous granulomas although the reaction was not as strong. Since IHY-1 was found to bind to both types of granulomas, this suggests that the epithelioid cells in sarcoidosis have antigenicity common to the epithelioid cells in tuberculosis. 
4	Endocardial resection in the treatment of ventricular tachycardia secondary to cardiac trauma. Sustained ventricular tachycardia with left ventricular aneurysm formation is a rare complication following penetrating cardiac trauma. We present an unusual case of serious ventricular tachycardia which developed 35 years after a World War II injury and was successfully treated with aneurysmectomy, map-guided subendocardial resection, and cryoablation. 
1	Extradural implantation of sacral anterior root stimulators. A technique for extradural deafferentation of the S2 to S5 segments and extradural implantation of stimulating electrodes is described, and its application to twelve patients with spinal cord lesions is reported. Nine patients use their implants for micturition, and seven are fully continent. The advantages and disadvantages of this technique compared with the more usual intrathecal procedure are discussed. 
4	Regression of atherosclerosis: what does it mean? Angiographic evidence of coronary artery atherosclerosis regression has been demonstrated in controlled clinical trials. The significance of this regression appears to depend in a complex way on the degree of atherosclerosis present when a regression regimen is initiated. Angiographic trials indicate that lesion change is a continuum, with a gradual transition from progression to stability and regression. Divergent lesion change can be seen in the same patient with a progression of some lesions and a regression of others. This makes it necessary to perform a comprehensive survey of all visible coronary segments when evaluating angiograms to determine the outcome of a clinical trial. An important finding in clinical trials is that new lesion formation can be reduced. This indicates that effective control of atherosclerosis may be possible with procedures now available, but noninvasive coronary artery imaging methods need to be refined. 
1	A predominantly adrenaline-secreting phaeochromocytoma. A 61-year-old woman who presented with diabetes, nausea, weight loss and sweating was found to have a phaeochromocytoma secreting adrenaline, with a small amount of N-methyladrenaline. There was no significant increase in noradrenaline secretion. She was normotensive, and developed profound hypotension in response to the alpha-adrenergic antagonist phenoxybenzamine. These features are unusual in phaeochromocytoma, but similar features occurred in the very few previous reported cases of pure adrenaline-secreting phaeochromocytoma. We conclude that it is important to identify such patients, so that they should not be given alpha-adrenergic antagonist drugs. 
5	Atherosclerotic carotid disease and the eye. The evaluation and management of retinal ischemia from atherosclerotic carotid disease is in a state of flux reflected by the change from emphasizing surgical management in the '70s toward skepticism about the benefit of surgery in the '80s. In addition, reliable noninvasive diagnostic testing of the carotid artery has reduced the risk. The decision to consider surgical versus medical management must be made on an individual basis based on the patient's health, age, and the risk of angiography and surgery at each institution. In children and young adults, amaurosis fugax is a benign condition. In the older population amaurosis fugax is often the sentinel event of diffuse atherosclerotic disease and possible early death from myocardial infarction. A team including the neurologist, internist, ophthalmologist, and surgeon optimizes care of the whole disease and not just the symptom. It is hoped that information in the next decade will supply additional guidance in the care of this multifaceted malady. 
1	A,B blood group antigens in tissues of AB heterozygotes. Emphasis on normal and neoplastic urothelium. The tissue distribution of the A and B blood group antigens was studied in 41 individuals with the heterozygous AB red blood cell (RBC) phenotype. A total of 134 biopsies from a variety of normal tissues (94 from urothelium and 40 from other tissues) were examined. In addition, changes in the expression of these antigens associated with neoplastic transformation were evaluated in 70 biopsies from transitional cell carcinomas of 19 AB heterozygous patients. There was heterogeneity in the distribution of tissue A and B antigens, depending on the cell type, as well as among cells of the same type. Ninety-one percent of AB heterozygotes expressed both A and B antigens in normal epithelial cells, with a mosaic distribution clearly apparent in 50% of these individuals. In 21% of these subjects, the A antigen was undetectable in the vascular endothelial cells in all biopsies from several organs. In most (79%) transitional cell neoplasms, only one of the two antigens was consistently expressed. The results of this study may have implications for the clonal or specific gene deletion theories of neoplasia. They also demonstrate the existence of a subgroup of AB individuals in whom the A antigen is absent specifically from the vascular endothelium. 
5	Morbidity associated with childhood systemic lupus erythematosus. A complete analysis of the outcome of childhood onset systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) requires determination of survival statistics and consideration of disease and treatment morbidity. The course of 32 patients with SLE diagnosed at or prior to age 16 and followed from 1979-1988 was analyzed with emphasis on the morbidity of pediatric SLE. Clinical characteristics were similar to those in previous studies. Five year survival, calculated by life-table analysis, was 85.3%, comparable to recent studies. Treatment consisted of corticosteroids (32 patients), antimalarials (14), cyclophosphamide (9) or azathioprine (2). Eighty-four percent of patients experienced a noninfectious drug related complication. A major infection contributed in all 5 patients who died. Higher total corticosteroid dose was associated with more severe infections. Eighty-eight percent of patients were left with chronic organ dysfunction. Survival in childhood onset SLE has improved, but morbidity remains a significant problem from organ dysfunction and complications of therapy. Our study is the first to address the issue of morbidity in childhood SLE. 
5	Filler DNA is associated with spontaneous deletions in maize. We have determined the structure of five spontaneous deletions within the maize waxy (Wx) gene. Of these, four were found in spontaneous wx mutants (wx-B, wx-B1, wx-B6, wx-C4) and include exon sequences; the fifth is restricted to an intron and represents a restriction fragment length polymorphism of a nonmutant allele (Wx-W23). The deletions, which range in size from 60 to 980 base pairs (bp), cluster in a G+C-rich region of approximately 1000 bp that is capable of forming stable secondary structures. Most striking is our finding that all of the alleles have DNA insertions (filler DNA) of 1-131 bp between the deletion endpoints. For three of the five deletions, the filler DNA and sequences at the deletion termini appear to be derived from sequences near one deletion endpoint. A previously reported spontaneous deletion of the maize bronze gene (bz-R) also contains filler DNA. The association of filler DNA with maize deletion endpoints contrasts dramatically with the rarity of similar events in animal germ-line and bacterial mutations. 
5	Renal function in obstructive jaundice in man: cholangiocarcinoma model. Renal function with respect to water clearance and renal hemodynamics was studied in 15 patients with obstructive jaundice due to cholangiocarcinoma. The results were compared with those of the control normal subjects. There was no change in renal function in the patients with mild to moderate jaundice, with total serum bilirubin from 8.0 to 15.1 mg/dl. Increased urinary sodium excretion and decreased free water and negative water clearances were observed in the patients with severe jaundice with total serum bilirubin from 27.0 to 40.4 mg/dl and normal serum albumin. Renal blood flow was normal, but creatinine clearance was decreased. In severely jaundiced patients with serum bilirubin from 30.5 to 40.1 mg/dl and hypoalbuminemia urinary sodium excretion, free water clearance, negative water clearance, renal blood flow and creatinine clearance were decreased. There was salt and water retention in this group. The findings suggest that in severe jaundice there is inhibition of sodium chloride reabsorption in the thick ascending limb of Henle's loop. ADH and increased hydraulic conductivity of the collecting tubules possibly contribute to decreased free water clearance. In severely jaundiced patients with hypoalbuminemia this salt losing effect is converted to salt retention by increased proximal tubular reabsorption of sodium. 
2	Antagonism of serotonin S3 receptors with ondansetron prevents nausea and emesis induced by cyclophosphamide-containing chemotherapy regimens The control of nausea and emesis in cancer patients receiving chemotherapy poses a significant management problem. In this randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study, we evaluated the effect of serotonin S3 receptor blockade with ondansetron (GR 38032F) on the prevention of nausea and vomiting induced by cyclophosphamide-containing chemotherapy. Cyclophosphamide was given in doses of 500 to 600 mg/m2 and ondansetron as three intravenous (IV) doses of 0.15 mg/kg. Most patients had breast cancer. Cyclophosphamide was given in combination with doxorubicin (65% of patients) or with fluorouracil (85% of patients: 50% with Adriamycin [doxorubicin; Adria Laboratories, Columbus, OH] and 35% with methotrexate). All placebo-treated patients experienced vomiting, whereas 70% of patients treated with ondansetron did not vomit (P = .008). Median nausea scores were 8 mm on ondansetron and 65 mm on placebo (P less than .001). Seventy percent of patients treated with ondansetron retained their normal appetite, compared with 10% of placebo patients. Adverse events occurred in six placebo patients and one ondansetron patient. Diarrhea and headache were the most common events, both occurring more frequently in the placebo group. There were no extrapyramidal reactions, and the only significant biochemical change occurred in a placebo-treated patient. These results suggest that serotonin S3 receptor antagonists represent a novel, effective, and safe mode of therapy for nausea and emesis induced by cyclophosphamide-containing chemotherapies. In addition, our observations are compatible with the view that serotonin, acting on S3 receptors, mediates the nausea and emesis occurring after cyclophosphamide chemotherapy. 
2	Antiemetic prophylaxis with promethazine or droperidol in paediatric outpatient strabismus surgery. This randomized, double-blind study evaluated the antiemetic efficacy and the side-effects of promethazine pretreatment (0.5 mg.kg-1 IV + 0.5 mg.kg-1 IM) versus droperidol + placebo pretreatment (droperidol, 0.075 mg.kg-1 IV + physiological saline, 0.02 ml.kg-1 IM). One hundred unpremedicated ASA physical status I children ranging from two to ten years, and undergoing outpatient strabismus surgery were studied. All children received inhalational anaesthesia with halothane, nitrous oxide and oxygen. Neither opioids nor muscle relaxants were used. The incidence of vomiting and/or retching and the incidence of side-effects were determined in the post-anaesthesia recovery room (PARR), in the short-stay surgical unit (SSSU), and after discharge from the hospital (including the journey and the stay at home during the first postoperative day). Promethazine and droperidol were equally effective in reducing the incidence of vomiting before discharge to two and eight per cent respectively. On the contrary, the incidence of vomiting after discharge and overall were significantly less with promethazine (ten and ten per cent) than with droperidol pretreatment (54 and 56 per cent) (P less than 0.0001). Promethazine permitted the time to discharge from the hospital to be reduced to an average of three hours, without increasing the incidence of vomiting postdischarge. Promethazine pretreatment is much less expensive than droperidol pretreatment. The incidence of restlessness was significantly less with droperidol (eight per cent) than with promethazine (36 per cent) (P less than 0.001). Promethazine pretreatment demands the use of an analgesic like acetaminophen in order to reduce the incidence of postoperative pain and restlessness. 
3	Assessing clinical significance of apnea exceeding fifteen seconds with event recording. Using event recording, we determined how often apnea exceeding 15 seconds in duration was associated with bradycardia and how often patients with apnea resumed breathing spontaneously. Of 1306 documented apnea events exceeding 15 seconds (54 patients), 926 lasted 16 to 20 seconds, 262 lasted 21 to 25 seconds, and 118 exceeded 25 seconds. Of these episodes, 75.3% were isolated and 14.9% were associated with pulse deceleration, 4.4% with irregular transthoracic impedance, and 5.4% with bradycardia. Event recording provided data supporting discontinuation of monitoring in 50 of 54 patients: 36 spontaneously resumed breathing before the auditory alarm and 14 had a decreased incidence of apnea with maturation. Follow-up of 51 patients (three not located) showed that none had subsequent apparent life-threatening events or sudden infant death syndrome. Our results in these older infants and children (median age 6.7 months) provide substantiation that such patients with apnea of less than 20 seconds without bradycardia do not require continued monitoring. Further, these data suggest that in selected older infants, longer isolated apnea may be well tolerated; however, hemoglobin saturation during sleep and the ability to resume breathing after the apnea alarm delay is prolonged should be verified. Our patient population had a wide age range and heterogeneity of diagnoses, and was typically free of symptoms, so these results should not be extrapolated uncritically to premature infants, infants with chronic lung disease, and patients with symptomatic apnea. 
4	Influence of desflurane on regional distribution of coronary blood flow in a chronically instrumented canine model of multivessel coronary artery obstruction. The influence of desflurane on myocardial perfusion measured by a microsphere technique during a total occlusion of the left anterior descending coronary artery and concomitant moderate or severe stenosis of the left circumflex coronary artery was evaluated in chronically instrumented dogs. Hemodynamics, regional contractile function, and myocardial blood flow were measured during the conscious state and after anesthesia with desflurane (8.2%-9.2% and 12.5%-12.7%) with and without control of arterial pressure. Total left anterior descending occlusion produced in combination with a left circumflex coronary artery stenosis significantly (P less than 0.05) increased heart rate and left ventricular end diastolic pressure in the absence of desflurane anesthesia. Desflurane, administered only in the presence of left anterior descending occlusion and left circumflex stenosis, significantly (P less than 0.05) decreased mean arterial pressure, left ventricular systolic pressure, and left ventricular positive dP/dt50 without change in heart rate. Blood flow to the subendocardium of normal myocardium was reduced during the high concentration of desflurane (P less than 0.05), but perfusion of the subepicardium and midmyocardium was maintained at conscious levels. When the left circumflex stenosis was of moderate severity, only blood flow to the subendocardium distal to the stenosis was reduced by desflurane (P less than 0.05). In the presence of a severe stenosis, perfusion was decreased in the subepicardium, midmyocardium, and subendocardium of the stenotic zone (P less than 0.05). During the reduction in arterial pressure produced by desflurane, collateral blood flow in the left anterior descending region was reduced in dogs with either a moderate or severe left circumflex stenosis (P less than 0.05). When arterial pressure and heart rate conditions observed in the postocclusion conscious state were restored during the high concentration of desflurane, myocardial blood flow in all regions returned to those levels present in the conscious state (P less than 0.05). Ratios of flow between occluded and normal zones were decreased when hypotension produced by desflurane was uncontrolled, but when arterial pressure and heart rate were adjusted to conscious postocclusion levels using partial thoracic aorta occlusion and atrial pacing, the ratio remained at conscious control levels regardless of the degree of left circumflex stenosis severity (P less than 0.05). Results of this investigation indicate that desflurane does not redistribute blood flow away from collateral-dependent myocardium to other regions via a "coronary steal" mechanism in a chronically instrumented canine model of multivessel coronary artery disease. 
4	Clinicopathologic studies of children who die of acute lower respiratory tract infections: mechanisms of death. Clinicopathologic correlations for 71 cases of fatal pneumonia in children were determined. The mechanism of death for these patients was multifactorial. Severe pneumonia alone accounted for 11 deaths (15.5%). Pneumonia associated with sepsis occurred in 42 children (59.2%). Heart failure (8.5%), hypovolemia (4.2%), and nosocomial infection (12.6%) were also seen in children with fatal acute lower respiratory tract infection. Extensive consolidation, squamous metaplasia, and hyaline membranes were present in the lungs of these children. Patients with severe disease must receive, in addition to antibiotics for acute episodes, individualized intensive respiratory and supportive care. Since these types of care are not available in poor communities, vaccination against measles and vitamin A supplementation for malnourished children may ameliorate the conditions that appear to predispose these children to severe or fatal disease. 
2	The isolation and characterization of a Norwalk virus-specific cDNA. Norwalk virus, an important cause of epidemic, acute, nonbacterial gastroenteritis in adults and children, has eluded adaptation to tissue culture, the development of an animal model, and molecular cloning. In this study, a portion of the Norwalk viral genome encoding an immunoreactive region was cloned from very small quantities of infected stool using sequence-independent single primer amplification. Six overlapping complementary DNA (cDNA) clones were isolated by immunologic screening. The expressed recombinant protein from a representative clone reacted with six of seven high titer. Norwalk-specific, postinfection sera but not with corresponding preinfection sera. Nucleic acid sequence for all clones defined a single open reading frame contiguous with the lambda gt11-expressed beta-galactosidase protein. Only oligonucleotide probes specific for the positive strand (defined by the open reading frame) hybridized to an RNaseA-sensitive, DNaseI-resistant nucleic acid sequence extracted from Norwalk-infected stool. Furthermore, RNA extracted from serial postinfection, but not preinfection, stools from three of five volunteers hybridized to a Norwalk virus cDNA probe. Clone-specific oligonucleotide probes hybridized with cesium chloride gradient fractions containing purified Norwalk virion. In conclusion, an antigenic, protein-coding region of the Norwalk virus genome has been identified. This epitope has potential utility in future sero- and molecular epidemiologic studies of Norwalk viral gastroenteritis. 
2	Omeprazole. Overview and opinion. Omeprazole, a substituted benzimidazole, is a specific inhibitor of the enzyme H+/K(+)-ATPase, which is found on the secretory surface of the parietal cell. This enzyme, the "proton pump," catalyzes the final step in acid secretion. Omeprazole is a powerful inhibitor of gastric acid secretion. At the time of writing, omeprazole has been licensed in the United States for the treatment of severe grades of gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) as well as GERD unresponsive to treatment with currently available agents, and for the treatment of Zollinger-Ellison syndrome and other gastric hypersecretory states. Most recently, it has been recommended by the FDA advisory committee for approval as first-line therapy in duodenal ulcer disease. 
5	Cause of thrombosis in human atherosclerotic arteries. Although it has been known for a long time that thrombosis nearly always develops in atherosclerotic arteries--and almost never in normal vessels--the mechanism through which atherosclerosis promotes thrombosis was unknown until this problem was explored through histologic examination of complete serial section sets of thrombosed atherosclerotic arteries. These studies, repeatedly confirmed, revealed that the thrombi are triggered by microscopic cracks in the collagen cap of advanced plaques. Blood most often seeps from the arterial lumen through the cracks into the underlying lipid gruel before the breaks or cracks are plugged by the thrombi (which function as hemostatic seals of the breaks). These results are parallel to results of experimental studies in which the synergism of endotheliotoxic and pressor agents produced thrombi over cap breaks and sub-break hemorrhages only in arteries with advanced collagen-rich plaques, not in arteries with early atherosclerosis or in normal vessels. This finding indicates that advanced atherosclerosis makes the arterial wall much more fragile and that, once broken, this wall exposes the blood to powerful thrombogenic materials that do not exist in normal arterial tissue. At present, human and experimental evidence suggest that the thrombogenic fissures of advanced plaque caps can be promoted by several factors, such as a surge in intraarterial pressure or insults that damage the caps structurally and increase their vulnerability to any type of stress such as certain metabolic, exogenous chemical and immune insults, spontaneous molecular changes of collagen with time and hemorrhages of capillaries that invade advanced plaques from the adventitia or the arterial lumen. 
5	Endourological treatment of ureteroenteric anastomotic strictures: long-term followup. In 1987 we reported our initial experience with an endosurgical incisional approach to ureteroenteric anastomotic strictures (that is endoureterotomy). We have extended that initial report to encompass 15 patients with 19 ureteroenteric strictures followed for an average of 2.5 years. In all cases an endosurgical approach was well tolerated, blood loss was less than 50 cc and hospital stay averaged 3.5 days. A 16 to 22F external stent was left in place for 4 to 6 weeks postoperatively in 14 strictures. A permanent external 12F catheter was left in 5 strictures due to the presence of metastatic disease (4) and a complete dense stricture (1). The only major complication was a ureteroenteric fistula that healed over a ureteral stent without any open surgical intervention. Among 14 ureteroenteric strictures in which the stent was removed, the ureteroenteric area has remained patent in 8 (57%) with an average followup of 28.6 months (range 9 to 57 months). Failures were associated with metastatic disease in 2 cases, generalized debility in 2 and unexplained in 2. In this series an endosurgical approach to ureteroenteric strictures provided long-term satisfactory management of the problem in the majority of patients with benign and malignant disease. By current standards, only 1 patient (7%) would have been considered a candidate for open surgical repair. 
5	Pulmonary vascular steal in chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension. After pulmonary thromboendarterectomy, performed for relief of chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension, perfusion lung scans have frequently disclosed new perfusion defects in segments served by undissected pulmonary arteries. Our hypotheses were that these new postoperative defects occurred with great frequency and did not represent postoperative vessel occlusion. We retrospectively reviewed the preoperative and postoperative perfusion scans of 33 consecutive patients undergoing pulmonary thromboendarterectomy. New postoperative perfusion defects were noted in 23 of 33 patients. The incidence of new defects was increased tenfold in segments that had (1) normal preoperative angiographic findings, (2) normal preoperative radionuclide perfusion, and (3) not been entered at the time of surgery. Postoperative angiograms, available in 15 of 33 patients, documented the nonembolic, nonocclusive nature of the new perfusion scan defects. The most plausible alternate explanation for this previously undescribed finding is a redistribution of pulmonary arterial resistance induced by the thromboendarterectomy, namely, a pulmonary vascular "steal.". 
3	An eosinophilia-myalgia syndrome associated with an L-tryptophan containing product. A syndrome of eosinophilia and myalgias associated with the usage of L-tryptophan containing products has been recently described by the Centers for Disease Control. We report a case of this new clinical entity, highlighted by severe myositis, and compare this illness with similar reported syndromes. 
1	Molteno implants and operating microscope-induced retinal phototoxicity. A clinicopathologic report. The right eye of a 75-year-old man with a history of cataract extraction, three penetrating keratoplasties, laser trabeculoplasty, two Molteno implants, and an operating microscope-induced retinal phototoxic lesion was studied post mortem. Histopathologic examination of the anterior segment showed evidence of penetrating keratoplasty, cataract surgery, and two Molteno implants with minimal associated tissue response. Ultrastructural examination showed a loose collagenous matrix surrounding the Molteno reservoirs, suggesting aqueous percolation from the reservoirs into the conjunctiva. Posteriorly, in the area of the phototoxic operating microscope-induced lesion, a nodule of retinal pigment epithelial hyperplasia with overlying atrophy of the photoreceptor cell layer of the neurosensory retina was noted. The retina also contained cystoid macular edema and an extensive preretinal membrane that was clinically unexpected. 
1	SPECT quantitation of iodine-131 concentration in phantoms and human tumors. The validity of SPECT measurement of iodine-131 (131I) concentration was tested in vitro in phantoms and in vivo by measuring bladder urine concentrations. Phantom studies comparing known and SPECT measured concentrations showed a good correlation for 131I (r = 0.98, s.e.e. = 20.94 counts/voxel) for phantoms of 25 to 127 cc and concentrations of 0.13 to 9.5 microCi/cc. The in vivo, in vitro correlation of 131I concentrations in the urine was also good (r = 0.98, s.e.e. = 0.677 microCi/cc). Quantitative SPECT was used to calculate the effective half-life and dosimetry of radioiodine in 12 sites of thyroid carcinoma in seven patients. SPECT was also used to determine the dosimetry of [131I]MIBG (metaiodobenzylguanidine) in two patients with carcinoid, two with neuroblastoma, and one with pheochromocytoma. The radiation dose for thyroid carcinoma metastases varied between 6.3 and 276.9 rad/mCi. The dose from MIBG varied between 13.4 and 57.8 rad/mCi. These results indicate the validity of quantitative SPECT for in vivo measurement of 131I and the need to measure the concentration of 131I in individual human tumor sites. 
5	Color Doppler imaging. A new noninvasive technique to diagnose and monitor carotid cavernous sinus fistulas. Color Doppler imaging is a recent development in ultrasonography that allows for simultaneous two-dimensional structural imaging and Doppler evaluation of blood flow. With this technique, one patient with a traumatic carotid cavernous sinus fistula and two patients with spontaneous dural cavernous arteriovenous malformations were evaluated. Color Doppler imaging demonstrated a dilated superior ophthalmic vein with arterialized blood flow in all three patients. In two cases the diagnosis was confirmed by angiography, and in one of these cases the fistula was occluded with a detachable balloon catheter. Postembolization color Doppler imaging revealed return of normal venous flow in the superior ophthalmic vein. This technique offers a noninvasive means to confirm the clinical diagnosis and to track the hemodynamics of these arteriovenous fistulas. In certain cases, color Doppler imaging may eliminate the need for computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging in the evaluation of suspected arteriovenous malformations of the orbit. 
1	Bladder perforation resulting from the use of the neodymium:YAG laser. Complications resulting from the use of the neodymium:YAG (Nd:YAG) laser to treat superficial bladder cancer are uncommon and are usually associated with abnormally high laser power outputs. We report a case of bladder perforation in a human attributed to the Nd:YAG laser used at a low power setting and comment on those factors that contributed to this complication. 
3	Screening for biotinidase deficiency in children with unexplained neurologic or developmental abnormalities. To test the hypothesis that the frequency of biotinidase deficiency is greater in children with unexplained developmental delay or neurologic abnormalities than in the general population, we studied children seen at a large outpatient clinic over a four-year period who had one or more of these neurologic abnormalities and for whom no specific cause for their abnormalities could be found. The group totaled 274 children (163 boys; 111 girls) whose ages ranged from 2 weeks to 17 years. Characteristics were IQ/DQ, 30 to 70 in the 115 for whom scores were available; 41% had seizures; 15% had sensorineural hearing loss; 54% showed gross motor delay or ataxia; and 27% had decreased muscle tone. One patient with a classical clinical picture of biotinidase deficiency was diagnosed during the study period and was not included in the study. None of the patients with nonclassic findings had a deficiency of biotinidase activity. Our results suggest that biotinidase deficiency does not account for a large proportion of children with unexplained neurologic abnormalities or developmental delay. This does not negate the importance of biotinidase testing in children with clinical patterns specifically suggestive of the deficiency. 
1	Visual disturbance in patients with melanocytoma of the optic disk. Visual disturbance in 11 patients with melanocytoma of the optic disk was analyzed. Goldmann visual field examination showed enlargement of Mariotte's blind spot in 7 of 10 patients (70%) and visual field defect or depression in 7 patients (70%). In 6 of the 7 patients with visual field defect of depression (86%), the portion of visual field damage corresponded with the location of the tumor and retinal nerve fiber bundle defect. In 1 patient, sudden loss of visual acuity occurred, presumably due to anterior ischemic optic neuropathy induced by melanocytoma. 
1	Prevalence of carcinoma in situ and other histopathological abnormalities in testes from 399 men who died suddenly and unexpectedly. To determine the prevalence of carcinoma in situ of the testis and other testicular histopathological abnormalities in the general male population, we examined gonads from 399 men 18 to 50 years old who died suddenly and unexpectedly. No sign of malignancy was found in any of these gonads. However, 3 of the 399 men had been previously treated for testicular tumor or carcinoma in situ. Thus, the over-all prevalence of testicular neoplasia in the population studied was 0.8% (95% confidence limits 0.2 to 2.2%). This frequency is of the same magnitude as the lifetime risk of testicular cancer in the Danish male population. The median weights of the left and right testes were 19.3 and 19.7 gm., respectively. This difference was statistically significant (p = 0.00003). Thus, our study confirmed that on average the left testis is smaller than the right testis. The median weight of the gonads collected in our study was 0.9 gm. lower than the weight of testes examined 40 years earlier at the same department of forensic medicine. However, this difference was not statistically significant (p = 0.17). Microscopic examination of the gonadal specimens revealed that 83% of the men exhibited complete spermatogenesis, including late spermatids in all tubules. In the age group studied we found no age-related changes in testicular weight or in the proportion of tubules with degenerative changes, such as spermatogenic arrest, the Sertoli-cell-only syndrome or hyalinization. 
5	Clinical choices for circulatory assist devices. Approximately 1.0% of open heart surgery patients become unweanable from cardiac bypass during the surgical procedure. In addition, nearly 20% of patients accepted for cardiac transplantation die while waiting for a donor heart. Pulsatile pneumatic ventricular assist devices (VADs) provide a realistic solution to these dilemmas. Currently, there are five manufacturers who are competing for the major market share in the clinical use of these devices. Novacor, Thermetics, Thoratec, Symbion, and Abiomed all have competitive VAD systems. Because no one system is optimal for all patients, the limitations, similarities, and strengths of each system should be known to enhance the patient's outcome when using these devices. Successful use of VAD systems, either as a bridge to transplantation or to ventricular recovery, is best approached by adherence to strict patient selection. Once instituted, VAD management centers on detailed attention to anticoagulation and prompt diagnosis and treatment of various complications. 
2	Effect of motilin on gastric emptying in patients with diabetic gastroparesis. OBJECTIVES: Because disturbances of gastric emptying are a serious complication in insulin-dependent diabetic subjects with regard to the maintenance of good metabolic control, we wanted to assess the effectiveness of motilin as a potential treatment for gastric emptying disturbances. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: The intestinal hormone motilin has been shown to accelerate gastric emptying in healthy subjects. Therefore, we examined the effect of intravenous motilin on gastric emptying of a 99mTc colloid-labeled semisolid test meal in 9 insulin-dependent diabetic patients with diabetic gastroparesis. All patients had a significantly delayed gastric emptying rate compared with a group of 11 healthy control subjects. RESULTS: During the infusion of motilin, gastric emptying was accelerated, and it was no longer significantly different from control values. CONCLUSIONS: These data demonstrate that motilin and related compounds such as erythromycin derivatives could be useful for the treatment of disturbed gastric emptying in diabetic subjects. 
4	Doppler assessment of pulmonary hypertension induced by hypoxic breathing in subjects susceptible to high altitude pulmonary edema. To verify the abnormal pulmonary vascular response implicated in the pathogenesis of high altitude pulmonary edema (HAPE), we examined the hemodynamic responses to hypoxia in HAPE-susceptible subjects (HAPE-S) by means of both right heart catheterization and pulsed Doppler echocardiography. The HAPE-S were seven men and one woman with a history of HAPE. Six healthy volunteers who had repeated experiences of mountain climbing without any history of altitude-related problems served as control subjects. The HAPE-S showed much greater increase in pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR) than did the control subjects, resulting in a much higher level of pulmonary arterial pressure (Ppa) under acute hypoxia both of 15% O2 and 10% O2. We then evaluated the usefulness of pulsed Doppler echocardiography in the prediction of pulmonary hypertension. Acceleration time (AcT) and right ventricular ejection time (RVET) were measured from the flow velocity pattern in the right ventricular outflow tract. The ratio of AcT to RVET was correlated to invasively determined mean Ppa (Ppa) and PVR. The results were as follows: (1) AcT/RVET = 0.52 to 0.0047 (Ppa), r = -0.93, SEE = 0.017, p less than 0.001 (HAPE-S); (2) AcT/RVET = 0.55 to 0.0055 (Ppa), r = -0.70, SEE = 0.030, p less than 0.001 (HAPE-S); (4) AcT/RVET = 0.52 to 0.00077 (PVR), r = -0.91, SEE = 0.016, p less than 0.001 (control subjects). We conclude that HAPE-S have a constitutional abnormality in the pulmonary vascular response to hypoxia, which is a possible causative factor of HAPE, and that pulsed Doppler echocardiography may be supportive to assess the pulmonary vascular pressor response in the HAPE-S. 
4	Paradoxical embolism: an underestimated entity. A plea for comprehensive work-up. Forty-one cases of arterial embolism were reviewed. The work-up included M + 2D echocardiography in 29 patients (71%), arteriography in 22 (54%), both echocardiography and arteriography in 19 (46%), and abdominal aortic ultrasound in 18 (43%). The sources of emboli were probable cardiac (8 = 20%)--mural cardiac thrombus detected by echocardiogram; possible cardiac (12 = 29%)--arrhythmias or other cardiac pathology detected without mural thrombus; probable arterio-arterial (7 = 17%)--proximal arterial thrombus detected; probable paradoxical embolism (2 = 5%)--fulfills the Johnson criteria with cardiac defect and right-to-left shunt detected by contrast echo in one patient and cardiac catheterization in the other; possible paradoxical embolism (3 = 7%)--meets two of three Johnson criteria without evidence of other source; and unknown source (9 = 22%)--conventional work-up negative or incomplete. Five of nine patients (56%) less than 50 years old had probable or possible paradoxical embolism, while in two patients (22%), the origin was unknown. Conclusion: (1) A significant proportion of patients with an arterial embolus are discharged with the source of emboli unknown, (2) paradoxical embolism must be considered and contrast saline or transesophageal echocardiogram should be done in patients under 50 years old. 
4	Dynamic changes in left ventricular outflow tract flow velocities after amyl nitrite inhalation in hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. Doppler echocardiography was performed in 21 patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HC), in nine patients with no evidence of left ventricular (LV) hypertrophy by two-dimensional echocardiography, and in five patients with systemic hypertension and concentric LV hypertrophy. The LV outflow tract (LVOT) peak velocity was recorded by continuous wave Doppler technique at rest and after amyl nitrite inhalation. The LVOT pressure gradient was calculated by the modified Bernoulli equation. A significant increase in heart rate and a drop in systolic blood pressure were observed in all patients after amyl nitrite inhalation; no adverse effects were encountered. The peak LVOT velocity and pressure gradient increased significantly after provocation in all patients, but the increase was much more pronounced in patients with HC (peak LVOT velocity increased from 2.2 +/- 0.8 to 4.3 +/- 1.0 m/sec and peak gradient increased from 22 +/- 17 to 78 +/- 36 mm Hg). The Doppler spectral signal in patients with HC demonstrated a characteristic contour, with peak velocity occurring in late systole. However, the observed increase in LVOT peak velocity was not statistically different between treated (with beta-blockers and calcium blockers) and untreated patients with HC. We conclude that LVOT peak velocity and pressure gradients in patients with HC can be readily assessed by Doppler echocardiography both at rest and after amyl nitrite inhalation. The dynamic changes in LVOT velocity induced by this provocation have certain characteristic features in obstructive HC but appear to be independent of the medical regimen used, at least in the dosages tested in our study. 
4	Development of antibodies to thrombin and factor V with recurrent bleeding in a patient exposed to topical bovine thrombin. A 65 year old patient who was exposed to topical bovine thrombin during cardiac surgery developed markedly prolonged clotting times and a severe bleeding diathesis. Mixing studies with normal plasma failed to correct the clotting times. Platelet transfusions, immunosuppressive and immunomodulatory therapies were ineffective, but plasmapheresis was effective in decreasing clotting times and in the resolution of clinical bleeding events. The patient's purified IgG reacted with bovine thrombin by immunoblotting and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). However, the IgG reacted minimally with human thrombin. In view of the severe bleeding, a coexisting inhibitor was sought. The patient's factor V activity was 1% of normal and was not corrected by mixing with normal plasma, demonstrating the presence of an inhibitor against factor V. The patient's IgG reacted with both bovine and human factor V. Immunoblotting localized the site of antibody binding to the light chain of activated bovine factor V. Detectable amounts of bovine factor V were found in commercial bovine thrombin preparations by ELISA. The data suggest that patients exposed to topical bovine thrombin may develop antibodies to thrombin and factor V. Anti-thrombin antibodies may mask coexisting factor V inhibitors responsible for clinical bleeding. 
5	The sulphated glycosaminoglycan levels in synovial fluid aspirates in patients with acute and chronic joint disease. Proteoglycan levels were measured in a series of synovial fluid samples from patients with acute and chronic joint diseases using a modified chemical dye binding method. Levels found in 50 miscellaneous inflammatory arthritis fluids (mean = 173.2 +/- 90.9 micrograms/ml) were higher than found in either 50 with rheumatoid arthritis (96.3 +/- 31.3 micrograms/ml) or 50 with osteoarthritis (83.8 +/- 27.3 micrograms/ml). For comparison, proteoglycan levels were measured in 15 cadaver synovial fluids (98.9 +/- 44.2 micrograms/ml) and 12 synovial fluids from patients with sports injury (163.7 +/- 79.4 micrograms/ml). Patients were recruited into a trial where synovial fluid was aspirated as often as possible over a 6-month period during which the patients were followed using a number of well proven clinical parameters. No correlation was found between the degree of joint destruction as measured by X-ray damage and the concentration or total amount of proteoglycan in the synovial fluid. In addition, there was no correlation between the level or total amount of proteoglycan and any clinical parameter of disease activity. 
4	Treatment with deferoxamine during ischemia improves functional and metabolic recovery and reduces reperfusion-induced oxygen radical generation in rabbit hearts BACKGROUND. Iron may play a central role in oxygen radical generation during myocardial ischemia and after reperfusion. Because conditions during ischemia may also liberate iron, we hypothesized that administration of the iron chelator deferoxamine during ischemia would result in improved functional and metabolic recovery after postischemic reperfusion. METHODS AND RESULTS. Isolated, perfused rabbit hearts were studied by phosphorus-31 nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. The hearts received one of three treatments: deferoxamine at the onset of 30 minutes of global ischemia (n = 9), deferoxamine as a bolus followed by a continuous 15-minute infusion begun at reflow (n = 9), or standard perfusate (n = 7). Hearts treated with deferoxamine during ischemia showed better recovery of developed pressure than did control hearts (63.2 +/- 7.5% versus 41.2 +/- 2.9% of baseline) (p = 0.02) and better recovery of myocardial phosphocreatine content (92.4 +/- 10.3% versus 68.2 +/- 4.5% of baseline, p less than 0.05). These functional and metabolic benefits were comparable to those obtained with deferoxamine treatment during early reperfusion. In 15 additional hearts, intraischemic treatment with deferoxamine resulted in no reduction in oxygen radical concentrations as measured on frozen tissue by electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy at end ischemia, but the treatment eliminated the reperfusion-induced increase of free radical generation observed in control hearts (2.9 +/- 0.01 versus 7.0 +/- 0.07 microM, p less than 0.001). The magnitude of reduction was similar to that when deferoxamine was given at the onset of reflow (2.4 +/- 0.02 microM, p less than 0.001 versus control). CONCLUSIONS. These results demonstrate improved functional and metabolic recovery of myocardium treated with deferoxamine during ischemia, accompanied by a reduction in reperfusion-induced oxygen free-radical generation to the same degree as reflow treatment, confirming the importance of iron in the pathogenesis of myocardial reperfusion injury. 
5	Persistent carcinoma in situ of the testis after chemotherapy for advanced testicular germ cell tumours. The chemosensitivity of testicular carcinoma in situ (CIS) was analysed in 25 testes excised 10 weeks to 4.5 years following platinum-based chemotherapy. CIS was present in 8 of the 23 evaluable cases (35%), in 5 of which the lesion coexisted with invasive germ cell tumour. It is concluded that CIS may persist or recur after chemotherapy. This has implications for occult presentation of metastatic germ cell tumours and also for the management of the contralateral testis in patients with testicular germ cell tumours. 
1	Nerve growth factor stimulates protein tyrosine phosphorylation in PC-12 pheochromocytoma cells. The cellular actions of nerve growth factor (NGF) and epidermal growth factor (EGF) may be mediated by changes in protein phosphorylation. The tyrosine phosphorylation of two predominant proteins of molecular mass 40 and 42 kDa is seen in PC-12 cells treated with NGF or EGF, correlating with activation of a previously identified serine/threonine protein kinase that phosphorylates microtubule-associated protein (MAP). Stimulation of phosphoprotein (pp) 40 and 42 phosphorylation and MAP kinase activity by NGF but not EGF is selectively attenuated by staurosporine and K-252A. Moreover, the time courses of pp40/42 phosphorylation and MAP kinase activation produced by NGF or EGF are identical. Chromatography of lysates from growth factor-treated cells on ion-exchange or hydrophobic-interaction HPLC resolves MAP kinase into two peaks, neither of which precisely coelutes with pp40 or pp42. One of these peaks (II) exhibits no detectable phosphotyrosine. The other peak (I) has some overlap with pp40. However, the activity residing in both peaks is almost completely inhibited after treatment with alkaline phosphatase, suggesting that, at least, serine/threonine phosphorylation is required for the activity of these enzymes. These data indicate that while tyrosine phosphorylation appears to be a critical early event in NGF action, the role of this modification in activation of MAP kinases remains unclear. 
1	Multiple intracranial mucoceles associated with phaeohyphomycosis of the paranasal sinuses. The purpose of this article is to alert clinicians to a new pathogenic fungus of the paranasal sinuses called Exserohilum rostratum. Exserohilum species are one of the etiologic agents of phaeohyphomycosis, a constellation of entities caused by dematiaceous fungi. This class of fungal sinus infection has emerged only in the past decade; it occurs primarily in immunocompetent individuals and produces a tenacious, progressive pansinusitis. To our knowledge, this study describes the first case of multiple intracranial mucoceles secondary to E rostratum. The diagnostic workup includes computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging followed by direct microscopic examination of tissue biopsy specimens. A craniotomy followed by a bilateral external ethmoidectomy was necessary for complete extirpation of the infected mucoceles. Aggressive surgical management of this mycotic infection is described. 
5	A cost-minimization study of cancer patients requiring a narcotic infusion in hospital and at home. We conducted a retrospective, non-randomized, cost-minimization study, from the perspective of the Ministry of Health, to compare the cost of managing cancer patients who required narcotic infusions, in hospital and at home. Our medical costs averaged $369.72 per inpatient day and $150.24 per outpatient day (saving $219.48 per diem, 1988 Canadian dollars), while narcotic costs were the same for any given patient in both settings. Sensitivity analysis showed that no reasonable changes in the quantity and cost of services reduced our savings by more than 50%. During incremental analysis, savings increased as more outpatient days were managed by our centre, from $0.00 for 318 days, to more than $500,000 for over 2000 days per annum. As this program has been extremely cost effective and preferred by our patients, other hospitals and central funding agencies might consider establishing a regional outpatient narcotic infusion program to reduce their costs. 
2	Treatment of hepatitis B virus-associated membranous nephropathy with adenine arabinoside and thymic extract. Previously we found that corticosteroid treatment in the hepatitis B virus (HBV)-associated membranous nephropathy (HBVMN) was not associated with a favorable outcome. To distinguish the differences of the HBV DNA in macrophage, T and B cells among HBVMN patients with or without corticosteroid treatment, serial studies at different time points were investigated. HBV DNA appeared as an "episomal" molecule as with 3.2 kb in macrophage, T and B cells. This molecule disappeared after 12 months among HBVMN patients without corticosteroid treatment. HBV DNA, by contrast, appeared as episomal form even three years later in T cells, with frequent proteinuria among HBVMN patients with corticosteroid treatment. This finding indicates that the use of corticosteroids leads to a potential risk of enhancing HBV viral replication in T cells. We studied 24 HBVMN patients who had previously received corticosteroid treatment and had persistent proteinuria, who were administered combination therapy with adenine arabinoside for two weeks and thymic extract (Thymostimulin) for six months to decrease urine protein loss and obtain seroconversion. These 24 patients had heavy (22 of 24, 91.6%) or mild (2 of 24, 8.4%) proteinuria prior to adenine arabinoside and thymostimulin treatment. All 24 patients demonstrated HBV DNA in mononuclear cells and simultaneously exhibited sera positive with HBsAg and HBeAg. In contrast, after treatment only one case (4.2%) had heavy and two cases (8.4%) mild proteinuria; HBV DNA was demonstrated in macrophage (4 of 24, 16.7%), T cells (9 of 24, 37.5%), and B cells (6 of 24, 25%) as well as serum (24 of 24, 100%) prior to treatment. 
5	The effect of spine fusion on respiratory function in Duchenne muscular dystrophy. Serial measures of respiratory function were made in 17 patients with Duchenne muscular dystrophy who underwent segmental spine fusion and in 22 patients who did not. No significant differences were observed between the 2 groups (operated vs. nonoperated) in terms of declining respiratory function. Nonetheless, all operated patients reported either improved sitting comfort, appearance, or both. Thus, our results suggest that there are distinct benefits from segmental spine fusion; however, there was no salutary effect upon respiratory function either in the short term or after up to 5 years follow-up. 
4	Prospective randomized multicenter comparison of in situ and reversed vein infrapopliteal bypasses. We have performed a prospective, randomized, multicenter study to compare in situ and reversed vein grafts for long limb salvage bypasses from the proximal thigh to an infrapopliteal artery. Three hundred eighty-four patients required an infrapopliteal bypass for critical lower extremity ischemia. Of these, 259 were excluded because a short vein bypass was performed or because the vein was considered inadequate. The remaining 125 patients had a randomized vein bypass, 63 reversed, 62 in situ. The two groups were similar with regard to risk factors, indications, graft dimensions, and outflow. Secondary patency at 30 months was similar for both techniques: reversed 67% +/- 9% (+/- SE); in situ 69% +/- 8%. For veins less than or equal to 3.0 mm in minimum distended diameter 24-month patency rates were 61% +/- 22% for 12 in situ veins and 37% +/- 29% for 10 reversed veins (p greater than 0.05). Angiographic evaluation of failing grafts revealed lesions similar in type and frequency in both types of grafts. These included focal (in situ, n = 4; reversed, n = 7) and diffuse vein hyperplasia (in situ, n = 2; reversed, n = 1), and inflow and outflow stenoses (in situ, n = 4; reversed, n = 3). The incidence of wound complications and the mortality rate were similar for the two groups. These data show no significant difference in overall patency rates for the two types of vein grafts at 2 1/2 years. 
3	Genetic flanking markers refine diagnostic criteria and provide insights into the genetics of Von Hippel Lindau disease. Von Hippel Lindau disease (VHL) is a hereditary syndrome, associated with tumors and cysts in multiple organ systems, whose expression and age of onset are highly variable. The availability of a genetic test for the early and reliable detection of individuals carrying the defective gene would be beneficial for VHL patients and their relatives, since many of the manifestations of VHL can be successfully treated if detected in their early stages, while the complications of undetected disease can be devastating. We have previously shown that the VHL gene maps to chromosome 3p. To provide genetic markers for the development of a reliable diagnostic test, and to further narrow and eventually clone the VHL defect, we have generated DNA markers for chromosome 3p. With these markers, we have performed a multipoint genetic linkage analysis in 28 VHL pedigrees, comprising 470 individuals, 164 of whom were affected with VHL. Here we report the identification of tightly linked markers, including flanking markers that bracket the VHL gene to a small region on chromosome 3p25-p26. This finding has several major implications. While visceral cysts of the kidney, pancreas, and epididymis are commonly found in VHL and are considered diagnostic criteria for this disorder, they also occur in the general population. The presence of cysts, unaccompanied by other more typical lesions such as retinal and cerebellar hemangioblastoma, may therefore represent a major diagnostic problem, leading to errors in the assessment of disease status. The application of flanking markers for the VHL gene for presymptomatic diagnostic testing confirms that epididymal cysts are indeed not suitable as a diagnostic criterion in this disorder. Pheochromocytomas occur nonuniformly in VHL families and may also be associated with other hereditary tumor syndromes; our genetic studies imply that the phenotype in VHL families with and without pheochromocytomas is caused by defects within the same gene. The absence or presence of this tumor type is therefore due to the pleiotropic expression of a single gene rather than to the existence of several different genes for VHL. The region on chromosome 3p13-p14 known to contain several chromosomal translocation breakpoints in families with "pure familial renal cell carcinoma" is quite proximal to the VHL locus in 3p25-p26 we have identified. Chromosome 3p may therefore contain two loci for renal cell carcinoma: one gene (or genes) in 3p13-p14 and the VHL gene in 3p25-p26, whose aberration is also associated with other typical manifestations of VHL.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS). 
2	Cholangiocarcinoma complicating primary sclerosing cholangitis. Cholangiocarcinoma is more likely to develop in patients with primary sclerosing cholangitis. Our aims were to describe the clinical presentation, course, and management of patients afflicted with both cholangiocarcinoma and primary sclerosing cholangitis and to estimate the prevalence of cholangiocarcinoma in patients with primary sclerosing cholangitis. A retrospective analysis was conducted of 30 patients with both primary sclerosing cholangitis and cholangiocarcinoma managed at our institution during an 8-year period. Development of cholangiocarcinoma was heralded by rapid clinical deterioration with jaundice, weight loss, and abdominal discomfort. Cholangiocarcinoma complicating primary sclerosing cholangitis often was detected at an advanced tumor stage, which precluded effective therapy, and overall median survival was 5 months. Earlier recognition and treatment of cholangiocarcinoma in such patients will be necessary to increase survival rates. Seventy patients with primary sclerosing cholangitis were followed prospectively in a clinical trial of medical therapy for an average of 30 months. Twelve patients died and five were found at autopsy to have cholangiocarcinoma. The potential for cholangiocarcinoma to develop in patients with primary sclerosing cholangitis may indicate that liver transplantation should be considered earlier in the course of the disease. 
4	Fatal pulmonary venoocclusive disease secondary to a generalized venulopathy: a new syndrome presenting with facial swelling and pericardial tamponade. We describe a patient who developed fatal pulmonary artery hypertension secondary to diffuse venulitis. This otherwise healthy young woman first presented with generalized venulopathy, with chemosis, facial swelling, pleural effusions, and pericardial tamponade. The symptoms partially responded to steroid therapy, but over a 2-year course, a rapidly progressive and fatal venoocclusive disease developed. No other primary condition was diagnosed, and at autopsy, the patient had striking venulitis throughout, including the pulmonary bed. We believe that this is a unique case of pulmonary hypertension resulting from a generalized venulopathy. 
3	The effect of epilepsy or diabetes mellitus on the risk of automobile accidents BACKGROUND. Previous studies of possible associations between chronic medical conditions and traffic safety have been inconsistent and subject to bias because of the incomplete identification of affected persons. Recent advances in the diagnosis and management of epilepsy and diabetes mellitus have improved the control of these disorders and suggest a need to reexamine the risk of traffic mishaps among patients with these conditions. METHODS. We conducted a population-based retrospective cohort study of 30,420 subjects 16 to 90 years of age, with and without epilepsy or diabetes mellitus. Subjects included all the licensed drivers in seven contiguous ZIP Code areas in which the Marshfield Clinic and St. Joseph's Hospital, Marshfield, Wisconsin, are the primary sources of medical care. Standardized rates of moving violations and accidents over a four-year period (1985 through 1988) were compared in affected and unaffected cohorts. RESULTS. Standardized mishap ratios for subjects with diabetes were 1.14 for all moving violations (P = 0.23) and 1.32 for accidents (P = 0.01); for subjects with epilepsy the ratios were 1.13 for moving violations (P = 0.26) and 1.33 for accidents (P = 0.04). CONCLUSIONS. We conclude that drivers with epilepsy or diabetes mellitus have slightly increased risks of traffic accidents as compared with unaffected persons. The increases in risk observed in our study were generally smaller than those in previous studies, and we believe they are not great enough to warrant further restrictions on driving privileges. 
1	Prospective study of alcohol intake and large bowel cancer. The alcohol intake of a cohort of Japanese men in Hawaii is directly and significantly related to the risk of developing rectal cancer, whether assessed on the basis of amount consumed or as a percent of total calories. Wine and whiskey are directly related to rectal cancer, but beer is the only alcoholic beverage that displays a statistically significant dose-response (P = 0.008). Colon cancer risk also is related directly to alcohol intake, but the association is statistically significant only when measured as a percent of energy intake. This suggests that alcohol might displace cancer inhibitors from the diet. Calcium, vitamin C, and dietary fiber are inversely related to colon cancer risk in this cohort, and each of these micronutrients displays statistically significant negative correlation with alcohol intake. A possible positive association between alcohol and lung cancer was ruled out after adjusting for cigarette smoking. Cancers of the prostate and stomach were unrelated to alcohol intake, but the risk of acquiring cancer at all other sites combined was strongly related to alcohol intake. 
5	Methodology of head-up tilt testing in patients with unexplained syncope Prolonged 60 degree head-up tilt has been shown to be valuable in the investigation of unexplained syncope, diagnosing neurally mediated bradycardia/hypotension or malignant vasovagal syndrome. To evaluate the methodology of tilt testing, the following were examined: reproducibility of results, tilt duration, angle of tilt, method of tilt support and effect of age in patients and control subjects. Seventy-one patients with recurrent unexplained syncope underwent 60 min of 60 degree tilt; 53 (75%) had an abnormal test with vasovagal syncope at 24 +/- 10 min (mean +/- SD). Tilting to 60 degrees resulted in an abnormal test in only 2 (7%) of 27 control subjects without cardiovascular symptoms (p less than 0.001); and 5 (15%) of 34 patients with syncope and documented conduction tissue disease (p less than 0.001). Of 15 youthful fainters, 3 (20%) had vasovagal reactions as did 1 (8%) of 12 asymptomatic youthful control subjects. These 12 control subjects also underwent tilting with a saddle support and 7 (67%) had vasovagal reactions. It is concluded that the duration of tilting at 60 degrees should be 45 min (mean time to syncope +2 x SD in the 53 patients with abnormal results). Twenty percent of patients with an abnormal tilt test may not demonstrate syncope with repeat tilting. Saddle tilt testing in unexplained syncope may result in a loss of specificity. Tilting at less than 60 degrees results in a loss of sensitivity. Head-up tilt may be less useful in youthful subjects with vasovagal syncope than in other subjects. 
1	Shear stress induces not only platelet aggregation but also platelet-tumor cell interaction. To investigate the interaction between platelets and tumor cells under well-defined flow conditions, the effect of tumor cells on platelet aggregation induced by shear stress was studied using a cone and plate viscometer adapted for measuring transmitted light intensity. Aggregation was markedly enhanced by HMV-1 cells in a cell number-dependent fashion under shear stress of 12 dyne/cm2. Enhancement was not observed at a high shear stress of 108 dyne/cm2. A monoclonal antibody against GPIIb/IIIa, 7E3 completely abolished enhancement of aggregation by HMV-1. Apyrase had similar inhibitory effects. Scanning electronmicroscopy showed that direct contacts of platelets with HMV-1 cells could be demonstrated when platelet-platelet interaction was inhibited by 7E3 or apyrase. These results may indicate that, at a shear stress of 12 dyne/cm2, direct contacts of platelets and HMV-1 cells may trigger enhancement of platelet aggregation. 
3	Sensitivity for detecting fibrillation potentials: a comparison between concentric and monopolar needle electrodes. The sensitivity of monopolar and concentric electrodes for detecting fibrillation potentials (FP) has never been formally compared. We studied 35 muscles with FP, sampling 20 sites each with concentric and monopolar needles. The concentric needle identified 0.88 +/- 3.44 (mean +/- standard deviation) more sites with spontaneous activity. Although statistically significant (Wilcoxon signed rank test P less than .03), this difference in sensitivity did not appreciably affect diagnostic interpretation. Subjects described the concentric needles as more painful. Needle insertions in 25 other muscles demonstrated that needle movement generated the majority of FP. We suggest that the increased tissue injury caused by concentric needles may account for both their increased sensitivity and discomfort. 
1	Ampullary carcinoma in patients under 50 years of age with a poor prognosis. Clinicopathologic features of 145 Japanese patients with ampullary carcinoma were compared among three age groups. The 145 patients were divided into three groups by the patient's age at the time of operation; there were 24 patients in group I (younger) aged less than or equal to 50 years, 99 in group II (ordinary) aged 51-69, and 22 in group III (elderly) aged greater than or equal to 70. The three groups showed no significant difference in sex, icterus, duration of icterus, size of the tumor, year of operation, macroscopic type, histopathologic type, tumor margin, lymphatic permeation, venous invasion, or pancreatic invasion. The survival curve of group I was worse than those of groups II and III. Multivariate regression analysis using 11 prognostic variables failed to reveal that the age of the patient at the time of operation was an independent factor. The younger patients aged less than or equal to 50 fared worse than the elderly patients aged greater than or equal to 70, because the group I tumors included a significantly greater number of advanced ampullary carcinoma with more frequent perineural invasion than did the group III tumors. 
2	Diltiazem therapy for symptoms associated with nutcracker esophagus. A randomized double-blind, cross-over prospective trial in 22 patients was designed to evaluate possible effect of an oral calcium channel blocker, diltiazem, on symptoms of chest pain and/or dysphagia in patients with nutcracker esophagus. We studied 22 consecutive patients referred to an esophageal diagnostic center for evaluation of noncardiac chest pain or dysphagia having high amplitude esophageal contractions, 14 of whom completed the study. Diltiazem (60-90 mg qid) was compared with placebo, each being administered for 8 wk. Patients were evaluated with esophageal motility pre- and posttreatment periods and with regular symptom assessment throughout each 8-wk treatment. Active diltiazem therapy resulted in significantly lower (p less than 0.05) mean distal esophageal peristaltic pressure (128 +/- 20 mm Hg; +/- SE) than placebo (158 +/- 16 mm Hg). Mean chest pains scores were significantly (p less than 0.05) lower with diltiazem therapy than with placebo. Only nine of the 14 patients fulfilled presently acceptable criteria for diagnosing nutcracker esophagus, and the diltiazem effect was similar, although not significant, because of the smaller sample. Conclusions: In this preliminary study involving 14 patients, the oral calcium channel blocker, diltiazem, appeared to improve noncardiac chest pain associated with strong esophageal contraction, the nutcracker esophagus. These improved symptoms were associated with significant decreases in contraction pressure. 
4	Quantitative assessment of cerebral blood volume by single-photon emission computed tomography. We implemented a technique for measuring regional cerebral blood volume using single-photon emission computed tomography and in vivo technetium-99m-labeled red blood cells and then evaluated it in nine normal human volunteers (controls) and seven patients with bilateral occlusion or severe stenosis of the internal carotid artery. We also measured regional cerebral blood flow using single-photon emission computed tomography and intravenous xenon-133 in the same subjects. We studied regional cerebral blood flow, regional cerebral blood volume, and their ratio before and after the intravenous injection of 1 g acetazolamide. Mean +/- SD baseline regional cerebral blood volume was higher in the patients than in the controls (4.1 +/- 0.6 versus 3.2 +/- 0.3 ml/100 g, p less than 0.01), and mean +/- SD baseline regional cerebral blood flow was lower in the patients than in the controls (40.5 +/- 11 versus 55.6 +/- 11 ml/100 g/min, p less than 0.05). Acetazolamide induced similar mean +/- SD increases in regional cerebral blood volume in both the controls and the patients (0.3 +/- 0.1 and 0.3 +/- 0.2 ml/100 g), while the mean +/- SD regional cerebral blood flow reactivity was significantly less in the patients than in the controls (12.6 +/- 7.6 versus 24.5 +/- 9.6 ml/100 g/min, p less than 0.05). Our study shows that single-photon emission computed tomography can provide quantitative estimates of both regional cerebral blood volume and regional cerebral blood flow in humans. 
5	Comparison of postmortem magnetic resonance imaging and neuropathologic findings in the cerebral white matter. Two types of high-signal intensity abnormalities are frequently found bilaterally in the cerebral white matter of brains of elderly patients on T2-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans. One is located in the immediate periventricular region; the other, in the deep subcortical white matter (centrum semiovale). The diagnostic implications of this second type continue to be uncertain. To determine the neuropathologic correlates of these lesions, the brains from seven elderly patients were fixed in buffered formaldehyde solution, subjected to MRI scanning, and examined neuropathologically. Variable degrees of bilateral periventricular (subependymal) sharply defined areas of high-signal intensity were found in all the brains, and the larger of these showed corresponding areas of myelin pallor with gliosis and dilated perivascular spaces. Discrete bilateral patches of high-signal intensity were found in the centrum semiovale in five patients. Myelin and axon stains showed varying degrees of diffuse white matter pallor in many areas examined, both with and without these areas of high-signal intensity on MRI scans. Neither the myelin nor the axon stains showed discrete white matter abnormalities that corresponded to the MRI findings. We believe that these changes, so commonly found on MRI scans in the elderly, reflect actual changes in the white matter but that their nature and clinical significance need to be elucidated. 
3	Orthostatic hypotension after spinal cord injury: treatment with fludrocortisone and ergotamine. We report a case of a 28-year-old woman with C5 quadriplegia, unresponsive to conservative treatment for orthostatic hypotension. Ergotamine, daily combined with fludrocortisone, successfully prevented symptomatic hypotension. In this report, neural, renal, and hormonal blood pressure regulatory mechanisms are described. Experiences obtained from this case and the existing literature suggest that (1) in persons with quadriplegia, plasma catecholamine levels show little increase with sitting, indicating an inability to activate baroreceptor and chemoreceptor reflexes, (2) elevated plasma aldosterone and renin levels indicate a renal compensatory response to decreased renal perfusion secondary to low plasma volume and/or chronic hypotension, and (3) the net effect of ergotamine and fludrocortisone is probably a combination of plasma volume expansion and direct peripheral vasoconstriction. 
5	Nosocomial infections due to Xanthomonas maltophilia (Pseudomonas maltophilia) in patients with cancer. From December 1985 to May 1986, Xanthomonas maltophilia (formerly known as Pseudomonas maltophilia) was isolated at an increased rate at our institution; 52 isolates of X. maltophilia were obtained in cultures of clinical specimens from 38 patients during that time. The records of 35 of these patients form the basis of this study. Twelve (71%) of the 17 infected and nine (50%) of the 18 colonized patients had received or were receiving antimicrobial therapy. Eleven of 17 patients (three of seven with septicemia, three of five with pneumonia, three with urinary tract infection, and two with wound infection) responded to antimicrobial therapy. Microbiologic studies of the potential environmental sources revealed growth of X. maltophilia in two water faucets and in one water sample from the medical intensive care unit. X. maltophilia is emerging as an important nosocomial pathogen in immunocompromised patients, especially those receiving broad-spectrum antimicrobial therapy. 
5	Vascular hypertrophy, renin and blood pressure in the young spontaneously hypertensive rat. 1. Cardiovascular reactivity, blood vessel morphology, blood pressure and the activity of the renin-angiotensin system were determined in the 3-week-old spontaneously hypertensive (SHR), Wistar-Kyoto (WKY) and outbred Wistar (WIS) rat. 2. In an isolated perfused mesenteric artery preparation the SHR had a significantly increased maximum response to KCl and noradrenaline (P less than 0.02) compared with the WKY. Using a myograph, vascular structure was measured over a range of resistance arteries and showed a significant correlation between lumen diameter and both media cross-sectional area and thickness, with the regression line for the SHR shifted upwards indicating both increased media area and thickness. This was associated with a slight, but significant, narrowing of the lumen (P less than 0.01) and an increased media/lumen ratio (0.049 +/- 0.01, 0.034 +/- 0.007, 0.036 +/- 0.008 for SHR, WKY and WIS, respectively, means +/- SD P less than 0.001). The SHR had a greater heart/body weight ratio than either the WKY or the WIS (P less than 0.001). 3. Both mesenteric artery and membrane protein content were higher in the SHR, indicating an increase in cell size or number. 4. Plasma renin activity (means +/- SD) was lower in the SHR (1.0 +/- 0.7 pmol of angiotensin I h-1 ml-1) than in the WKY (2.2 +/- 1.2 pmol of angiotensin I h-1 ml-1, P less than 0.001) but not different from that in the WIS (1.2 +/- 0.8 pmol of angiotensin I h-1 ml-1). Mesenteric artery vascular renin concentration was also lower in the SHR (P = 0.06). 
5	The mechanism of spastic muscle hypertonus. Variation in reflex gain over the time course of spasticity. The electromyographic (EMG) response of the initially passive biceps brachii muscle to imposed extension applied at the elbow was studied in 19 hemiparetic and 12 normal subjects. In relaxed normal subjects, the biceps muscle was found to respond only at displacement velocities above 175 deg/s, with a single early burst of activity in the biceps EMG. In contrast, the hemiparetic subjects, in addition to the early EMG activity, also showed considerable late activity, which persisted even with stretch velocities as low as 35 deg/s. This late activity is a stretch reflex, present in fully plegic arms. It was seen in all spastic subjects in whom the tone of the biceps had been clinically assessed to be raised, but was never observed in subjects with normal muscle tone. The mean level of this EMG response was highly correlated with displacement velocity and its duration to the duration of the applied displacement. It is suggested that this reflex EMG activity is the major factor in the genesis of spastic hypertonus in the arm and that it arises not from a reduction in the threshold of the stretch reflexes of the muscle, but from a pathological increase in stretch reflex gain. It is further shown that this activity is at a high level between the first and third months after the onset of spasticity and that the reflex gain is significantly reduced when spasticity is established for a year or more. It is concluded that, while changes in passive mechanical properties may play a role when spasticity has been established for more than a year, the major cause of spastic muscle hypertonus is a pathological increase in stretch reflex activity. 
4	The cardiovascular effects of cocaine. Cocaine use and abuse continue to overwhelm urban economic, social, and health care systems. Patients frequently present to the emergency department with life-threatening manifestations of cocaine use, including trauma, acquired immune deficiency syndrome, psychomotor agitation, and cardiovascular collapse. Adequate treatment of the cocaine-intoxicated patient requires a critical understanding of the risk-to-benefit ratios for pharmacologic, toxicologic, and surgical or obstetric interventions. The pharmacologic and physiologic bases for the vascular manifestations of cocaine toxicity and experimental evidence for treatment strategies are reviewed. 
2	Breakdown of gastric mucus in presence of Helicobacter pylori. The potential of Helicobacter pylori to degrade gastric mucus was examined. Colonies of H pylori cultured from antral mucosal biopsy specimens of patients with non-autoimmune gastritis were washed with sterile saline, passed through a sterilisation filter, and the filtrate examined for urease, protease, and mucolytic activity. The filtrate failed to hydrolyse bovine serum albumin, or to degrade stable mucus glycoprotein structures of high particle weight that had been separated from human gastric mucus on Sepharose 2B. The high particle weight mucus glycoprotein was, however, extensively degraded when incubated with H pylori filtrate (which possessed urease activity) in the presence of 2 M urea, to release fragments of Mr approximately 2 X 10(6). The high particle weight mucus glycoprotein was also broken down to a comparable extent when incubated with Jack bean urease in the presence of 2 M urea, or 1 M ammonium carbonate, or 40 mM carbonate-bicarbonate buffer (pH 8.7), but not when treated with 4 M urea alone, or Jack bean urease alone. These results indicate that the loss of high particle weight mucus glycoprotein in gastric mucus from patients with gastritis and gastric ulcers is unlikely to be due to the mucolytic action of an extra-cellular protease produced by H pylori, but it may result from the destabilising effects of a carbonate-bicarbonate buffer, generated at the mucosal surface when H pylori urease hydrolyses transuded plasma urea. 
4	Factors related to treatment resistance in hypertension. Hypertension which is resistant to treatment carries a relatively bad prognosis. Factors associated with treatment resistance were examined in a case-control study in a hospital hypertension clinic. Patients with resistant hypertension had more severe hypertension and more frequently had evidence of end-organ damage on presentation to the clinic. The prevalence of accelerated phase hypertension, renovascular disease and impaired renal function was also higher in these patients. Cigarette smoking, and the combination of cigarette smoking and heavy caffeine use, were greater in patients with resistant hypertension. Resistant hypertension did not appear to be associated with older age, obesity, regular alcohol use, various psychological factors or non-compliance. These findings support an aggressive investigation policy in resistant hypertension, and underline the harmful effects of cigarette smoking to hypertensive subjects. 
4	Hemodynamic effects of lobar pulmonary artery occlusion in a porcine sepsis model. We induced severe pulmonary hypertension and acute lung injury in 6 pigs by Pseudomonas aeruginosa infusion. We studied the effect of pulmonary artery catheter inflation of a pulmonary artery catheter balloon in the left lower lobar pulmonary artery was accompanied by a significant (p less than 0.05, paired t test) increase in pulmonary artery pressure, a decrease in left atrial pressure, a decrease in cardiac output, and a decrease in mean arterial pressure. No significant changes occurred when the catheter was advanced into the wedged position without balloon inflation. Balloon inflation had no significant effect on these variables before bacterial infusion. We conclude that with sufficiently severe pulmonary hypertension in association with diffuse lung injury, lobar pulmonary artery occlusion may cause alterations in cardiac output and left atrial pressure. This may confuse interpretation of pulmonary artery catheter measurements. 
2	Acute abdominal pain in the elderly. STUDY OBJECTIVES: To determine the incidences of both specific diagnosis and surgical diseases in patients more than 65 years old who present to the emergency department with nontraumatic abdominal pain of less than one week's duration, and to determine the ED staff's ability to diagnose and triage elderly patients with acute abdominal pain. DESIGN: A 12-month retrospective review of all elderly patients who presented to the ED with acute, nontraumatic abdominal pain. SETTING: A regional trauma center serving a predominately rural population in the Midwest. The ED has 55,000 patient visits yearly. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Of the 127 patients enrolled, 30 (24%) had no specific diagnosis made in the ED. Biliary tract disease (12%) and small bowel obstruction (12%) were the two most common specific diagnoses. Overall, 53 patients (42%) required surgery, usually during the initial hospitalization. In four cases, the postoperative diagnosis differed significantly from the ED diagnosis. Of the 74 patients (58%) who did not undergo surgery, 51 had follow-up information available. In 14 patients, the follow-up diagnosis differed from the original diagnosis, but most of these changes did not appreciably alter the treatment and outcome. CONCLUSIONS: The incidence of surgical disease is high in elderly patients with acute abdominal pain, and ED staff are able to diagnose and triage these patients accurately. 
1	Renal carcinoma in a solitary kidney. We studied the clinical and pathological features of 26 patients with renal carcinoma of a solitary kidney, including 6 treated at this hospital. Four patients had a contracted kidney and 22 had previously undergone nephrectomy. Partial nephrectomy was performed in 16 patients, enucleation of the tumour in 5 and radical nephrectomy in 5 because of the size of the tumour. Ex vivo surgery was carried out in 4 patients. The duration of ischaemia ranged from 15 to 365 min but was longer in those who underwent ex vivo surgery (149 to 365 min). Of the 21 patients who underwent partial nephrectomy or enucleation, the serum creatinine level increased (greater than or equal to 2.0 mg/dl) post-operatively in 16 patients, of whom 9 required temporary haemodialysis. No recurrence has been noted in those who underwent partial nephrectomy, but 1 patient who underwent enucleation of the tumour developed a solitary pancreatic metastasis 2 years 6 months after surgery and was treated by a partial pancreatectomy. Kidney-preserving surgical procedures are considered to improve the quality of life, but careful follow-up is necessary. 
5	Pancreaticobiliary ductal union. The main pancreatic duct and the common bile duct open into the second part of the duodenum alone or after joining as a common channel. A common channel of greater than 15 mm (an anomalous pancreaticobiliary duct) is associated with congenital cystic dilatation of the common bile duct and carcinoma of the gall bladder. Even a long common channel (greater than or equal to 8 mm) is associated with a higher frequency of carcinoma of the gall bladder. Gall stones smaller than the common channel and a long common channel predispose to gall stone induced acute pancreatitis. Separate openings for the two ductal systems predisposes to development of gall stones and alcohol induced chronic pancreatitis. The role of ductal union has also been investigated in primary sclerosing cholangitis and biliary atresia. 
4	Clinical efficacy of PTCA and identification of restenosis: evaluation by serial body surface potential mapping. We used serial body surface potential mapping (BSPM) with the departure map technique to evaluate the clinical efficacy of percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA) in various pathophysiologic stages of coronary artery disease, and to detect restenosis. The BSPM was performed prior to, 1 week after, and 1 month after PTCA. A follow-up coronary angiography was performed 3 to 6 months after PTCA, and BSPM was also performed at the same time. The results of BSPM were compared with those of thallium-201 single-photon emission computed tomography (Tl-201 SPECT) and radionuclide ventriculography. After PTCA, BSPM showed a significant reduction in the departure area, the Tl-201 SPECT also showed a significant reduction in the extent and severity scores, and the left ventricular ejection fraction improved significantly. In the cases with restenosis, the departure area, which had decreased in size after PTCA, showed an increase in size. After successful re-PTCA, the size of the departure area again became smaller. We concluded that BSPM, which is a simple, noninvasive, and inexpensive method, is useful in the evaluation of the clinical efficacy of PTCA and in the detection of restenosis after successful PTCA. 
5	Flow-volume characteristics in the pulmonary circulation. Isolated ferret and canine lungs were used to validate a method for assessing determinants of vascular volume in the pulmonary circulation. With left atrial pressure (Pla) constant at 5 mmHg, flow (Q) was raised in steps over a physiological range. Changes in vascular volume (delta V) with each increment in Q were determined as the opposite of changes in perfusion system reservoir weight or from the increase in lung weight. At each level of Q, the pulmonary arterial and left atrial cannulas were simultaneously occluded, allowing all vascular pressures to equilibrate at the same static pressure (Ps), which was equal to the compliance-weighted average pressure in the circulation before occlusion. Hypoxia (inspired PO2 25 Torr) in ferret lungs, which causes intense constriction in arterial extra-alveolar vessels, had no effect on the slope of the Ps-Q relationship, interpreted to represent the resistance downstream from compliance (control 0.025 +/- 0.006 mmHg.ml-1.min, hypoxia 0.030 +/- 0.013). The Ps-axis intercept increased from 8.94 +/- 0.50 to 13.43 +/- 1.52 mmHg, indicating a modest increase in the effective back-pressure to flow downstream from compliant regions. The compliance of the circulation, obtained from the slope of the relationship between delta V and Ps, was unaffected by hypoxia (control 0.52 +/- 0.08 ml/mmHg, hypoxia 0.56 +/- 0.08). In contrast, histamine in canine lungs, which causes constriction in veins, caused the slope of the Ps-Q relationship to increase from 0.013 +/- 0.007 to 0.032 +/- 0.006 mmHg.ml-1.min (P less than 0.05) and the compliance to decrease from 3.51 +/- 0.56 to 1.68 +/- 0.37 ml/mmHg (P less than 0.05). 
1	Adjuvant cyclophosphamide, methotrexate, and fluorouracil in patients with axillary node-positive breast cancer: an update of the Guy's/Manchester trial. Between 1976 and 1985, 391 patients (202 premenopausal, 189 postmenopausal) with operable breast cancer and positive axillary lymph nodes were randomized after total mastectomy and axillary clearance to receive cyclophosphamide, methotrexate, and fluorouracil (CMF) (n = 193) or no adjuvant therapy (n = 198). After a median follow-up of 8 years, both relapse-free survival (RFS) and survival (S) were significantly prolonged in premenopausal patients receiving CMF (RFS, P less than .001; S, P = .003). Treatment with CMF resulted in a significant improvement in RFS in premenopausal patients both with steroid receptor-positive and steroid receptor-negative tumors and also in subgroups of premenopausal patients defined by the number of axillary nodes involved. Premenopausal patients who developed permanent amenorrhea following CMF had a significantly better RFS than those who continued to menstruate. Induction of amenorrhea following CMF was related to age, with almost all patients over 40 years becoming amenorrheic. For patients less than or equal to 40 years, development of amenorrhea following CMF did not influence outcome. No difference was detected between control and CMF groups (RFS, P = .9; S, P = .9) in postmenopausal patients nor in any subgroup of these patients. The results of this trial of the efficacy of CMF for improving RFS and S have strengthened with longer follow-up. 
4	Pericardial effusion in primary hypothyroidism. Pericardial effusion is reported to occur in 30% to 80% of subjects with hypothyroidism. However, these earlier studies were conducted when the diagnosis of hypothyroidism was only suspected and was confirmed only in the presence of classic clinical features. In contrast, the diagnosis has recently been established in the early mild stage or more often in an asymptomatic stage because of more frequent or routine determinations of thyroid function tests, especially in the elderly. Thus the subjects in the older studies were severely hypothyroid at the time of diagnosis and may not be representative of the present hypothyroid population. For this reason, 30 subjects with hypothyroidism were evaluated with echocardiography to reassess the evidence of pericardial effusion in this disorder. Only two subjects demonstrated pericardial effusion, and in only one of them with severe disease could the pericardial effusion be attributed to hypothyroidism, since it resolved on the patient's attaining the euthyroid state. Thus the incidence of pericardial effusion was only 3% to 6%, depending on the inclusion of one or both subjects, an extremely infrequent occurrence when compared with that of previous studies. Moreover, the occurrence of pericardial effusion in hypothyroidism appears to be dependent on the severity of the disease. Thus pericardial effusion may be a frequent manifestation in myxedema, an advanced severe stage, as previously found, but a rare association of hypothyroidism, an early mild stage, because of the timeliness with which the latter condition is nowadays detected. 
1	Toxicity of high-dose cytosine arabinoside in the treatment of advanced childhood tumors resistant to conventional therapy. A Pediatric Oncology Group study. Experience with high-dose cytosine arabinoside (HDAC) in pediatric solid tumors is limited. Sixteen children with solid tumors resistant to conventional therapies were registered in a pilot Pediatric Oncology Group (POG) study that required the administration of HDAC at 3 g/m2 every 12 hours for four doses. There were four cases of rhabdomyosarcoma, two cases of fibrosarcoma, four cases of neuroblastoma, and one case each of germ cell tumor, Wilm's tumor, retinoblastoma, hepatocellular carcinoma, Ewing's sarcoma, and Burkitt's lymphoma. All eligible patients had advanced diseases and had previously received extensive chemotherapy. Thirteen patients received one course of HDAC and three patients received two courses of HDAC. Due to prior treatments, patients had less than normal marrow reserves. Short-term toxicity included nausea, vomiting, suppression of hemopoiesis, drug fever, and increased blood urea nitrogen (BUN), creatinine, and liver enzymes. All evaluable patients recovered from their toxicities. There were no drug-related deaths. None of the patients had neurologic problems, including the only patient with prior irradiation to the skull. With the above schedule, HDAC appears to have manageable toxicity. 
1	Hemiparesis and ischemic changes of the white matter after intrathecal therapy for children with acute lymphocytic leukemia. Three children with acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL) developed delayed-onset transient hemiparesis and facial palsy after intrathecal (IT) administration of methotrexate (MTX) alone or as part of triple intrathecal chemotherapy for central nervous system (CNS) prophylaxis. The hemiparesis developed 10 to 14 days after IT therapy. Two of three children also experienced transient, profound expressive dysarthria. These episodes occurred during maintenance treatment after multiple IT administrations and without previous CNS toxicity. Two of three children received intermediate-dose MTX, 1 g/m2, not less than 5 weeks before events. These patients had not received cranial irradiation and had no evidence of CNS leukemia before or after these episodes. Ischemic changes on computerized tomographic scan or magnetic resonance imaging studies were documented in all three cases. Such changes are unusual manifestations of neurotoxicity in children after intrathecal therapy. 
5	Coronary pathology predicts conduction disturbances after coronary artery bypass grafting. Conduction disturbances after coronary artery bypass grafting may result from compromised septal blood flow. To examine this hypothesis we reviewed the preoperative coronary angiography of 55 consecutive patients undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting. Thirty-five patients had either no lesion or a discrete lesion in the left anterior descending coronary artery that did not include the septal perforator (type I anatomy). Twenty patients had a lesion of the left anterior descending coronary artery at the origin of the first septal branch, a lesion of the first septal artery, or a pair of lesions in the left anterior descending coronary artery that straddled the origin of the first septal artery; all lesions were proximal to the graft site (type II anatomy). None of the patients with type I anatomy had a major conduction disturbance after coronary artery bypass grafting. Eleven of the patients with type II anatomy had major conduction disturbances after coronary artery bypass grafting; right bundle-branch block in 1, right bundle-branch block and left anterior hemiblock in 2, left bundle-branch block in 5, and complete atrioventricular block that required pacemaker implantation in 3 (p less than 0.001). In the 20 patients with type II anatomy, the appearance of conduction disturbances correlated well with the absence of retrograde flow to the septal branches from the right coronary artery (p less than 0.01). Pathological lesions in the left anterior descending coronary artery that compromise flow in the first perforator and that do not provide an adequate circulation produce localized damage and conduction disturbances after coronary artery bypass grafting. This can be predicted from the preoperative angiographic anatomy. 
1	The effect of age on treatment choice and survival in elderly breast cancer patients. To investigate the effect of age on treatment choice and survival in patients with breast cancer, data from the cancer registry of the Netherlands Cancer Institute (NKI, Amsterdam, The Netherlands) on 611 women have been analyzed. All patients 55 years and older admitted to the NKI for primary treatment of breast cancer between 1981 and 1986 were selected. For women 75 years and older, physicians were less likely to use treatment of adjuvant radiation therapy after a mastectomy and more often employed primary hormonal therapy only for local stage disease than for younger patients. Life-table analysis showed that disease-specific survival at 7 years for patients 65 through 74 years of age was significantly better (65%) than that of the youngest (55%) and the oldest age group (50%). In multivariate regression analysis (Cox), age older than 74 years was significantly and independently associated with a shorter disease-specific survival as compared with patients younger than 75 years. This difference in survival, however, does not seem to be the result of the difference in treatment between the age groups, but suggests an influence of age-related factors such as comorbid diseases and weak physical condition, which manifest themselves most strongly in the oldest age category and make the older woman more vulnerable to the course of malignant disease. 
4	Detection of myocardial infarction in the presence of Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome by QRST isoarea map in dogs. The possibility of detecting myocardial infarction (MI) in the presence of Wolff-Parkinson-White (WPW) syndrome by means of body surface QRST isoarea maps was studied in eight dogs. Eighty-seven body surface ECGs were recorded simultaneously. Recordings were taken during right atrial (RA) and right atrial and right ventricular (RA + RV) sequential pacing, which simulated WPW syndrome, during control periods and at 1-hour intervals for up to 5 hours after occlusion of the left anterior descending coronary artery. In ECGs during the RA drive, diagnostic findings of MI such as abnormal Q waves were observed but became obscure during the RA + RV drive. On the contrary, the QRST values over the anterior chest during both drives were positive soon after coronary occlusion, decreased gradually as time passed, and became abnormally negative after 5 hours. The QRST isoarea maps during RA and RA + RV pacing showed quite similar patterns and were highly correlated with each other throughout this study (r greater than 0.95). These findings demonstrate that localized abnormalities resulting from MI are evident in QRST isoarea maps even in the presence of preexcitation and fusion. 
1	Extramedullary plasmacytoma of the urethra: a case report. Extramedullary plasmacytomas are uncommon manifestations of plasma cell neoplasms, which occur rarely in the urinary tract. We report to our knowledge the third case of primary IgA plasmacytoma of the urethra. Diagnosis, therapy and followup with magnetic resonance imaging are presented. 
1	Primary lymphoma of the central nervous system in two children with acquired immune deficiency syndrome. Postmortem examination disclosed central nervous system non-Hodgkin's lymphoma in two children who died of acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) at 6 and 14 months of age, respectively. Systemic signs of lymphoma were not present. The B-cell origin and clonality of the neoplastic cells were established by immunohistochemistry in one case and by molecular analysis of immunoglobulin gene rearrangement in the other. Moreover, in the latter case the neoplastic cells were characterized by the presence of a single episomal EBV genome. According to these data, the monoclonal B-cell proliferation occurred after EBV infection, thus suggesting a possible pathogenetic role of EBV in the early stages of lymphomagenesis. 
5	Abnormal differentiation of human papillomavirus-induced laryngeal papillomas. We studied the proliferation and differentiation of human laryngeal papillomas, which are benign tumors induced by human papillomaviruses. Immunofluorescent stains of tissues for a number of differentiation-specific proteins showed abnormal differentiation. Papilloma tissue fragments in vitro showed a slightly decreased fraction of proliferating cells that incorporated tritiated thymidine and a markedly reduced incorporation of tritiated uridine when compared with normal tissue. We propose that papillomavirus infection results in normal basal cell proliferation but abnormal terminal differentiation and that this abnormality significantly contributes to the hyperplasia of the papillomas. 
1	Aneuploidy in pancreatic insulinomas does not predict malignancy. Nuclear deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) ploidy studies with paraffin embedded archival material from 14 pancreatic insulinomas were performed by flow cytometry. Clinical follow-up (2 to 17 years; mean, 8 years) was obtained for all patients. Half of the tumors had a normal DNA histogram and half exhibited an abnormal DNA profile consistent with DNA aneuploidy. Six of the seven patients with aneuploid tumors are alive and disease free (2 to 5 years postresection), and one is alive with metastatic disease. Of the seven patients with tumors showing normal DNA profiles, five are alive and disease free, one is dead of disease, and one is alive with metastatic disease. These data suggest that DNA ploidy analysis is unlikely to provide useful prognostic information for patients with insulinomas. 
1	Marker profile of different phases in the transition of normal human ovarian epithelium to ovarian carcinomas. To investigate whether early changes in the transformation of normal ovarian epithelial cells into tumor cells can be detected with monoclonal antibodies, a comparative immunohistochemical study was performed on normal human ovarian mesothelial cells, cystomas, cystadenomas, ovarian carcinomas, as well as granulosa cell tumor. Using monoclonal antibodies against different keratin subtypes, it was shown that mesothelial cells, ovarian cysts, cystadenomas, and carcinomas all reacted positively with broad-spectrum anti-keratin monoclonal antibodies (MAbs), as well as with MAbs to keratins 7, 8, 18, and 19. Keratins 4 and 13 were not found in mesothelial cells, but positive groups of cells were identified in several cystomas, adenomas, and carcinomas. While mesothelial cells did not react with the pan-epithelial marker BW495/36, invaginating metaplastic mesothelial cells, inclusion cysts, cystomas, adenomas, and carcinomas showed an increasing reactivity with BW495/36, with an increasing degree of malignancy. The reactivity of MAbs against ovarian carcinoma-associated antigens (OV-TL 3, OC 125, MOv 18, and OV-TL 10) was limited to weak staining reaction in some mesothelial cells but were found to be positive on more than 50% of the ovarian cystadenomas and more than 90% of the ovarian carcinomas. Thecal and granulosa cells of primordial, primary, and secondary follicles all reacted positively with antibodies to the broad-spectrum keratins OV-TL 12/5 and RCK 102, and to keratins 8 and 18, but not with keratins 4, 7, 13, and 19. These keratins decreased or disappeared in granulosa cells of mature follicles (Graafian follicles), whereas granulosa cell tumors did not react with anti-keratin antibodies. The reactivity of BW 495/36 was negative or limited to traces in some granulosa cells. Ovarian carcinoma-associated antigens were not expressed in granulosa cells or granulosa cell tumors. The data indicate that mesothelial cells undergoing metaplastic changes finally resulting in ovarian cystadenomas (and carcinomas) initiate the synthesis of a 200-kd glycoprotein recognized by MAb (BW 495/36), the production of ovarian carcinoma associated antigens, in addition to focal production of keratin 4 and/or 13, as seen in several samples. The granulosa cell tumors decrease or switch off their keratin production and remain negative for the 200-kd glycoprotein and the ovarian carcinoma-associated antigens. 
5	Nontuberculous mycobacterial infections of the skin. Report of fourteen cases and review of the literature. This study comprised 14 patients from whose skin nontuberculous mycobacteria were recovered. Most clinical manifestations were relatively nonspecific. Various histopathologic patterns were observed in 22 biopsy specimens. Recurrences were common and prolonged treatment was often necessary. Culture of tissue remains the definitive diagnostic procedure. Cutaneous lesions can be the first or only site of nontuberculous mycobacteriosis. 
5	Influence of the menstrual cycle on systemic diseases. Physiological changes associated with the menstrual cycle influence the clinical course of some diseases such as bronchial asthma, allergies, anaphylaxis, epilepsy, migraine, dermatoses, and porphyria. Hormonal manipulation can be beneficial in some patients. 
3	The timed "Up & Go": a test of basic functional mobility for frail elderly persons. This study evaluated a modified, timed version of the "Get-Up and Go" Test (Mathias et al, 1986) in 60 patients referred to a Geriatric Day Hospital (mean age 79.5 years). The patient is observed and timed while he rises from an arm chair, walks 3 meters, turns, walks back, and sits down again. The results indicate that the time score is (1) reliable (inter-rater and intra-rater); (2) correlates well with log-transformed scores on the Berg Balance Scale (r = -0.81), gait speed (r = -0.61) and Barthel Index of ADL (r = -0.78); and (3) appears to predict the patient's ability to go outside alone safely. These data suggest that the timed "Up & Go" test is a reliable and valid test for quantifying functional mobility that may also be useful in following clinical change over time. The test is quick, requires no special equipment or training, and is easily included as part of the routine medical examination. 
1	Ganglioglioma: a clinical study with long-term follow-up. Gangliogliomas are uncommon tumors of mixed neoplastic glial and neuronal elements. Because of their low incidence, few large series exist that fully describe the clinical characteristics of patients afflicted with this tumor. We have reviewed the medical records of 20 patients at Duke University Medical Center with histologically proven gangliogliomas. These patients typically presented within the first three decades of life and their most common presenting symptom was seizures. Therapies included surgical resection, either partial or total, radiation therapy, and/or chemotherapy. Long-term follow-up was achieved by chart review and by telephone interview. Patients who underwent gross total resection alone seemed to fare the best when comparing all treatment groups, and we therefore recommend this as the main form of treatment. 
4	Beta-blocker duration of action and implications for therapy. Two studies were conducted to measure the effect of serum half-life on beta-blocker-related heart rate reduction throughout the 24-hour period. In the first study, nadolol, atenolol and pindolol were associated with significant (p less than 0.01) heart rate reduction even at 24 hours after dose. Nadolol, with a plasma half-life of 15.5 hours, had the most pronounced heart rate-lowering effect 24 hours after the daily dose compared to pindolol, which had a half-life of 5.5 hours. In a randomized, double-blind, crossover study, nadolol and atenolol had similar effects 3 to 4 hours after the daily dose. Nadolol, however, produced greater suppression of heart rate and double product (blood pressure x heart rate) than atenolol (compared to placebo) 24 hours after ingestion of the daily dose. On ambulatory electrocardiography 24 hours after medication administration, 80 to 100% of the heart rate-attenuating effect of nadolol was maintained versus only 20 to 45% of atenolol's effect. Statistically significant (p less than 0.05) reductions in heart rate were produced by nadolol, but not by atenolol, between 4 and 5 A.M., 6 and 7 A.M., 8 and 9 A.M. and 9 and 10 A.M. Furthermore, nadolol remained at 52% of peak blood level at 24 hours, whereas atenolol was at 20%. The data from these 2 studies indicate that significant differences in duration of action exist between beta blockers. 
4	Prostaglandin modulation of early afterdepolarizations and ventricular tachyarrhythmias induced by cesium chloride combined with efferent cardiac sympathetic stimulation in dogs. Prostaglandins inhibit efferent cardiac sympathetic nerve effects by acting at presynaptic sites and may act to suppress some arrhythmias. In the present study, the effects of intravenous administration of prostacyclin (PGI2) and prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) on early afterdepolarizations and ventricular tachycardia induced by cesium chloride (0.5 mmol/liter per kg body weight intravenously) combined with stimulation of bilateral ansae subclaviae in anesthetized dogs were examined. The right atrium was paced at a constant cycle length of 600 ms. A left ventricular endocardial monophasic action potential catheter was used to detect early afterdepolarizations. Prostacyclin (0.2 microgram/kg per min) reduced the amplitude of the early afterdepolarizations (39.2 +/- 8.4% of the monophasic action potential amplitude during control study to 28.7 +/- 5.5%, n = 10; p less than 0.001) as well as the prevalence of ventricular tachycardia (11 of 14 dogs during control study to 5 of 14 dogs; p = 0.031). Prostaglandin E2 (0.2 to 0.6 microgram/kg per min) did not significantly reduce the early afterdepolarization amplitude (34.7 +/- 8.9% to 25.1 +/- 10.7%, n = 8; p = 0.085) or the prevalence of ventricular tachycardia (8 of 10 versus 6 of 10 dogs; p = 0.50). Alpha- and beta-adrenoceptor blockade with combined intravenous administration of propranolol (0.5 mg/kg) and phentolamine (0.3 mg/kg) decreased the amplitude of the early afterdepolarizations induced by cesium chloride and bilateral ansae subclaviae stimulation from 38.6 +/- 11.2% to 18.8 +/- 3.3% (n = 6; p = 0.005). Additional administration of PGI2 further reduced the early afterdepolarization amplitude from 18.8 +/- 3.3% to 9.8 +/- 4.8% (n = 6; p = 0.001). 
5	Intraocular lens complications. The authors implanted intraocular lenses (IOL) in 780 eyes and considered complications of this surgery, dividing the complications into intraoperative and postoperative, the latter early and late. The most frequent intraoperative complications were: hyphema, vitreous injury, pupil deformation with an IOL in the anterior chamber (AC), and hyphema and corneal lesions with an IOL in the posterior chamber (PC). Among the early postoperative complications of an IOL in the AC the authors noticed striate keratopathy and uveal flare and postoperative transitory ocular hypertension and striate keratitis with an IOL in the PC. Moreover, in late postoperative complications in AC implantation they observed: cystoid macular edema, bullous keratitis, retinal detachment, late uveitis, opacification of posterior capsule, eccentric displacement of the IOL, and less frequently, cystoid macular edema in PC implantations. The authors prefer IOL implantation in the PC after extracapsular cataract extraction, since this surgery causes less problems in the cornea, vitreous, and retina. 
2	Traumatic diaphragmatic hernia and intestinal obstruction due to penetrating trunk wounds. We have reported two cases of intestinal obstruction due to traumatic diaphragmatic hernia, both resulting from apparently trivial knife wounds. When TDH is due to a penetrating injury, it tends to produce symptoms of intestinal obstruction. A high index of suspicion, a chest x-ray film, and barium studies of the gastrointestinal tract are usually needed to make the diagnosis, though CT scans, ultrasonography, laparoscopy, and radionuclide scanning may also be useful. Surgeons and emergency physicians should be aware of the potential for TDH when there is a history of a penetrating wound of the chest or abdomen. 
3	Large cystic optic glioma. A 5 1/2-year-old boy developed a huge cyst in his chiasmal glioma 4 years after radiation therapy. The cyst produced obtundation but was successfully treated. 
4	Emergent aneurysm surgery without cerebral angiography for the comatose patient Neurologically based clinical grading scales offer excellent prognostic information for the patient suffering diffuse subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH). These grading scales are less applicable to patients with life-threatening intraparenchymal hematomas after aneurysmal rupture. During the last 3 years, four patients in a comatose state with brain stem compression syndromes documented by computed tomographic scans have undergone emergent operation in our neurosurgical service. Each patient was so critically ill that we believed it unwise to delay craniotomy for diagnostic angiography. The average delay from the onset of coma to skin incision was 3.02 hours (range, 1.67-6.5 hours), and the average delay from arrival in our unit until skin incision was 1.8 hours (range, 0.75-2.5 hours). The condition of two arousable patients deteriorated while they were in the emergency room, presumably from new bleeding. Each patient underwent craniotomy for hematoma evacuation, definitive aneurysm clipping, and lobectomy for decompression. Temporary clipping was employed in one patient, and intraoperative rupture occurred in two others. Three patients survived but retain significant disability. Emergent craniotomy with empiric exploration of appropriate subarachnoid cisterns after hematoma decompression may be life-saving in some cases. The delay imposed for diagnostic angiography may be avoided in attempts to save vital minutes of severe brain stem compression. 
1	Dexamethasone-nonsuppressible cortisol in two cases with aldosterone-producing adenoma. Forty-one patients with aldosterone-producing adenoma (APA) were subjected to a dexamethasone suppression test (DST) before surgery. Serum cortisol and urinary excretion of 17-hydroxycorticosteroids were suppressed by dexamethasone in 39 patients [DST(+)]. In two patients (cases A and B), they were not suppressed [DST(-)]. Clinical manifestations of the two DST(-) patients were similar to those of DST(+) patients. Hypertension, hypokalemia, high serum aldosterone levels, and suppressed PRA were found in all of the patients. The cut surfaces of the adenomas from all of the patients, including cases A and B, were golden yellow, which is typical of APA. However, atrophies of the adjacent normal tissues were evident exclusively in the two DST(-) patients. After removal of the affected adrenals, the serum cortisol level was suppressed by dexamethasone in one of the DST(-) patients (case B). These findings suggested autonomous cortisol production by APA. To evaluate whether cortisol could be produced from the adenoma tissue, the presence of several steroidogenic enzymes was studied by immunohistochemistry and mRNA analysis in the adenomas and the adjacent nonneoplastic adrenals from the 2 DST(-) and 5 DST(+) patients. Immunohistochemical analysis demonstrated that steroidogenic enzymes were expressed in APA tumor tissues from both DST(-) and DST(+) patients. In both groups, mRNAs coding steroidogenic enzymes were present not only in the nonneoplastic but also in the tumor tissues. Quantitative analysis of the mRNA levels revealed that in the adrenals from DST(+) patients, the mRNAs were more abundant in nonneoplastic tissue than in tumor tissue. However, in those from DST(-) cases, the mRNAs were much more abundant in the tumor tissues than in the nonneoplastic tissues. These results indicate that tumor cells of the two DST(-) patients autonomously synthesized not only aldosterone but also cortisol. The diameters of the tumors from the two DST(-) patients exceeded 3 cm, while those from other DST(+) patients were smaller. In patients with large APA, adrenal insufficiency should be anticipated upon removal of the tumor. 
5	Intradural chordoma of the tentorium cerebelli. Case report. A rare case of intradural chordoma is described. The literature contains seven examples of intradural extraosseous chordoma, all reported in a ventral location. This is the first reported case of a primary intradural chordoma distant from the clivus and involving both the supra- and infratentorial compartments. 
4	The effect of alcohol in isolated blunt splenic trauma. The effect of alcohol on trauma patients is controversial, with numerous authors citing no difference in mortality in acutely intoxicated patients. The purpose of our study was to retrospectively investigate the effect of alcohol in adult patients with isolated blunt splenic injury. From 1980 through 1989, 47 adult patients with splenic trauma as the only major injury were admitted to the Trauma Service. There were 37 males and ten females with a mean age of 29 years (range, 15 to 61). Motor vehicle accidents were responsible for 44 (94%) of the injuries. Group 1 consisted of 24 patients with a mean blood alcohol level of 185 mg/dl (range, 15 to 380). In Group 2 there were 23 patients without detectable blood alcohol. There were no statistically significant differences between the two groups in age, Abbreviated Injury Severity Score, initial hematocrit, and grade of splenic injury. Hypotension was present in 13 patients (55%) in Group 1 versus six patients (26%) in Group 2 (p less than 0.05). Significant abnormalities in clotting studies were present on admission in six patients (25%) in the alcohol-detected group versus one in the other group (p less than 0.05). Blood transfusion requirements in the first 24 hours were significantly greater in Group 1 (mean, 3.9 units) versus Group 2 (mean, 0.5 units) (p less than 0.001). If alcohol was present, there was much less chance for splenic conservation, as 18 patients (75%) underwent splenectomy versus seven patients (30%) in the nonalcohol group (p less than 0.05). There was one death and this occurred in a patient acutely intoxicated who suffered a cerebral infarct. 
1	Histopathologic study of otitis media in individuals with head and neck tumors. Five temporal bones, each including the eustachian tube, were obtained from five adults with advanced malignant tumors of the head and neck. The specimens were from the side on which the tumor had occurred. Otitis media had been detected clinically in two cases, and was detected histopathologically in the other three. We discuss the possibility that otitis media might have been caused by tumor invasion of the paratubal area, by postoperative inflammation in the nasopharynx, or by an inflammatory reaction of tubal structures to radiotherapy, or that these conditions may have coexisted. 
5	Hypodense eosinophils and interleukin 5 activity in the blood of patients with the eosinophilia-myalgia syndrome. The recent recognition of the eosinophilia-myalgia syndrome (EMS) associated with the ingestion of L-tryptophan prompted an analysis of the peripheral blood eosinophil phenotypes and of the serum eosinophil hematopoietins in this disorder. Five patients with an illness characterized by the abrupt onset of aching skeletal muscles, edema, thickening and induration of the skin, and marked blood eosinophilia associated with L-tryptophan ingestion provided eosinophils, serum, or both, for evaluation. Gradient sedimentation density analysis of the peripheral blood eosinophils from four of these patients revealed that 43 +/- 13% (mean +/- SEM) of the cells had converted to the abnormal (hypodense) sedimenting phenotype. When normodense eosinophils from the reference donors were cultured for 3 days in medium supplemented with increasing concentrations of serum from the patients with EMS, their viability increased in a dose-dependent manner to 45%, which was significantly augmented over the effect of normal serum. This eosinophil viability-sustaining activity was inhibited by 76 +/- 7% (mean +/- SEM; n = 3) by the addition of anti-interleukin 5 (IL-5) but not by neutralizing antibodies monospecific for either granulocyte/macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) or IL-3. IL-5, an eosinophilopoietic factor, converts normodense peripheral blood eosinophils in vitro to a hypodense sedimenting form with extended viability and augmented biologic responses to activating stimuli. Thus, the presence of IL-5 in the sera of patients with EMS may contribute to the development and maintenance of the eosinophilia and may regulate the conversion of the peripheral blood eosinophils to the hypodense phenotype with augmented pathobiologic potential. 
4	Histologic abnormalities of large and small coronary arteries, neural structures, and the conduction system of the heart found in postmortem studies of individuals dying from the toxic oil syndrome. Hundreds died and thousands were poisoned by rapeseed oil adulterated with aniline and sold illegally in Spain in 1981. The clinical manifestations, now known as the toxic oil syndrome, include pulmonary hypertension and right ventricular hypertrophy plus widespread vascular and neural lesions in other organs. Many of the late deaths ended with a scleroderma-like illness. Because scleroderma involves the heart, in this study we examined the small and large coronary arteries, neural structures, and conduction system from eight victims dying with the toxic oil syndrome. Dense fibrosis of the sinus node in two hearts resembled changes found in scleroderma. Atrionodal junctional hemorrhages and cystic degeneration of the sinus node present in the other six hearts resembled changes found in lupus erythematosus. Small and large coronary arteries exhibited focal fibromuscular dysplasia and a proliferative cystic myointimal degeneration. This latter abnormality was associated with sloughing of the inner wall and embolization of the detached fragment downstream in the same coronary artery. Every heart had many degenerative lesions within nerves, ganglia, and the coronary chemoreceptor. Both the arterial and neural abnormalities prominently involved the conduction system. Based upon observations by others with experimental feeding of rapeseed oil containing either high or low erucic acid, we suggest that this oil must remain a major suspected cause of the toxic oil syndrome, particularly in conjunction with some as yet unexplained facilitative influence by oleoanilids. If this is so, it is important to reconsider the widely recommended use of any rapeseed oil product as a suitable food for man or other animals. 
5	External ear resonance in children with otitis media with effusion. A middle ear effusion has been shown, in KEMAR, to increase the height of the resonant peak of the external auditory canal by 6 dB SPL. It has also been shown that the hearing impairment due to otitis media with effusion is related to the volume of middle ear fluid. Therefore, it was hypothesized that measurement of the height of the resonant peak of the external auditory canal could be used as a method of assessing the magnitude of any hearing impairment due to otitis media with effusion. 182 ears from 182 children aged 3-12 (mean 6.3) years were studied. Pure-tone audiometry and impedance tympanometry were performed, and the acoustics of the external auditory canal were measured using the Rastronics CC1-10 frequency response analyser. The mean height of the resonant peak (17.9 dB SPL) of children with a type A tympanogram was significantly different from the mean value (23.6 dB SPL) of those with a type B tympanogram. There was a significant correlation between the height of the resonant peak and the speech frequency average of the pure-tone thresholds. The sensitivity and specificity of using the height of the resonant peak to detect hearing impairments in different age groups were calculated and compared with the sensitivity and specificity of tympanometry. The test did not provide the same degree of sensitivity as tympanometry but was more specific. The additional advantages of the test are that it is quick, taking less than 1 min per ear, and is well tolerated by children in whom there was a 99% compliance. 
1	Doxorubicin for unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma. A prospective study on the addition of verapamil. A prospective study was conducted to assess the safety and efficacy of the addition of oral verapamil to intravenous Adriamycin (doxorubicin) for the management of patients with unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). All 28 patients studied had histologically verified disease, and cirrhosis was present in 20 of the 21 patients with adequate tissue sampling. The overall median survival was 57 days. Chemotherapy was terminated in seven patients after one course of treatment. Partial response and complete response were noted in four patients (19%) and one patient (4.8%), respectively, among the 21 patients evaluated. Side effects related to the chemotherapy were present in all patients studied. Death from fulminating sepsis occurred in three of the 13 patients with leukopenia. Symptomatic myocardial dysfunction developed in one patient. The addition of verapamil apparently did not potentiate the tumoricidal effect of systemic Adriamycin on HCC but probably did increase its complications. 
5	In vivo nonthrombogenicity of heparin immobilized polymer surfaces. The authors developed two different methods to immobilize heparin on polymer surfaces. One method involves in situ heparin immobilization on a segmented polyurethane urea (Biomer) surface via hydrophilic poly(ethylene oxide) (PEO, Mn = 4,000) spacers. The other method uses PEO/poly(dimethylsiloxane) (PDMS) block co-polymer and heparin covalently linked in a block co-polymer system (PEO-PDMS-Hep). These surfaces have demonstrated high heparin bioactivity in vitro and excellent blood compatibility in in vitro-ex vivo experiments. This report evaluates the long-term in vivo blood compatibility of these heparin immobilized surfaces. Vascular grafts (6 mm ID, 7 cm in length) were fabricated with Biomer, and heparin was immobilized in situ with PEO spacers (B-PEO4K) and coated on their luminal surfaces with PEO-PDMS-Hep. Biomer and PEO (Mn = 4,000) grafted Biomer (B-PEO4K) were used as controls. The grafts were implanted in the abdominal aorta of dogs and retrieved at 3 months or when graft occlusion was suspected. Retrieved grafts were evaluated with scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). TEM measured the thickness of the adsorbed protein layer on the surface and the protein distribution (albumin, fibrinogen, and IgG) visualized by an immunogold method. All heparin immobilized grafts were patent at 3 months, whereas Biomer and B-PEO4K grafts occluded within 1 month. SEM pictures of heparin immobilized surfaces after 3 months demonstrated minimal platelet adhesion and activation without detectable fibrin formation. Heparin immobilized surfaces showed a thin protein layer (300-600 A) even after 3 months, with high concentrations of albumin and IgG and less fibrinogen. 
1	Overexpression of normal and mutated forms of HRAS induces orthotopic bladder invasion in a human transitional cell carcinoma. Recent studies have shown that orthotopic (transurethral) transplantation of human bladder cancer cell lines into nude mice permits tumor growth that accurately reflects their clinical malignant status in the original host. Thus, such a system allows a unique opportunity to analyze the genetic events involved in the conversion of low-grade bladder cancer, the vast majority of which are curable, to the high-grade life-threatening form of the disease. Since 5-10% of transitional cell carcinomas (TCCs) have been shown to contain a mutated HRAS gene, and protein expression levels of all forms of HRAS have been correlated with TCC progression, we chose to study the contribution of the HRAS oncogene in bladder tumor progression. We evaluated the effects of transfection of normal or mutated HRAS genes into a human TCC, called RT-4, that behaves as a superficial noninvasive papillary tumor after transurethral orthotopic inoculation into athymic nude mice. We found that overexpression of either transfected normal or mutated HRAS genes converted RT-4 cells to express an invasive phenotype remarkably similar in nature to the clinical behavior of high-grade bladder carcinomas. These results suggest a role for overexpressed normal or mutated RAS genes in human bladder carcinoma progression, and highlight the importance of using orthotopic inoculation systems for evaluation of the contribution of oncogenes to malignant tumor progression. 
4	Calcium, parathyroid hormone, and vitamin D in the "prehypertensive" Dahl salt-sensitive rat. The purpose of this study was to determine if alterations of calcium and calcium regulating hormones precede the onset of NaCl-induced hypertension in the Dahl salt-sensitive (S) rat. After a 5-day balance study, serum ionized calcium, parathyroid hormone (PTH), and 1,25-dihydroxy vitamin D concentrations were measured in Dahl-S and salt-resistant (R) rats that had been maintained on a "normal" (1%) or high (7%) NaCl intake. Blood pressure was higher in Dahl-S than Dahl-R (P less than .01), but was not affected by 5 days of high NaCl. On both NaCl intakes, urine calcium excretion was increased, serum calcium was decreased, and serum PTH and 1,25 dihydroxy vitamin D were increased in Dahl-S compared to Dahl-R (P less than .01). On the high NaCl intake, fecal calcium was greater in Dahl-S than in Dahl-R, and net 5-day calcium balance was less positive in Dahl-S (P less than .05). Thus, alterations of calcium, PTH, and vitamin D precede NaCl-induced hypertension in Dahl-S. These alterations may contribute to the development of hypertension in this animal model. 
5	Strategy for breakpoint cluster region analysis in chronic myelocytic leukemia in a routine clinical laboratory. Despite the increasing reliance on breakpoint cluster region (bcr) determinations in diagnosis of chronic myelocytic leukemia (CML), few reports have dealt with the practical aspects of specimen analysis. In the setting of a routine molecular diagnostics laboratory, samples from 68 patients with active CML were evaluated for bcr rearrangements, with the use of a variety of enzymes and two probes. The data have been used to develop an efficient strategy for bcr screening and breakpoint determination. Screening with the universal bcr (UBCR) probe on Xba I and BgI II digests yielded bcr rearrangements in 100% of the Ph1-positive patients and three of the seven Ph1-negative patients, giving bcr analysis a sensitivity of 100%. A single-enzyme screen using the UBCR probe would have resulted in a false negative rate of 10%. The false negative rate was determined during the breakpoint site analysis from additional digests hybridized to both the 3' and UBCR probes. The false negative rate for the 3' probe was 26.5%, because of deletions or 5' rearrangements. The method of breakpoint site determination was dependent on screening results. In 78% of cases, one additional hybridization with two enzyme digests was required. During breakpoint site analysis, a rare false negative result was also demonstrated with Bam HI and Eco RI. This screening strategy has made bcr analysis competitive with cytogenetic analysis at the authors' institution; although turnaround time may be slightly longer, bcr analysis can yield information (such as detecting bcr-positive/Ph1-negative patients and determining breakpoint site) that cannot be obtained by cytogenetics. 
4	ST segment alternans during percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty--a case report. The occurrence of electrical alternans of the ST segment has been reported in patients with variant angina. The authors encountered a patient with typical electrical alternans of the ST segment in leads V4 through V6, which developed during percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA) of the proximal left anterior descending artery. Hemodynamic pulsus alternans of the aortic pressure tracing was not observed during electrical alternans, and a Ca2+ blocker could not prevent this phenomenon during PTCA. 
4	Transplant coronary artery disease: histopathologic correlations with angiographic morphology. Accelerated coronary artery disease is a major cause of morbidity and mortality among cardiac transplant recipients. Ten patients who died or underwent retransplantation within 2 months of coronary angiography had direct correlation of angiographic (normal discrete lesions, diffuse concentric narrowing) with histologic appearance of coronary arteries. Of the 26 angiographically normal segments, 73% showed mild to moderate fibrous intimal thickening by light microscopy. The remainder had intermediate lesions or atheromatous plaques. Discrete stenoses usually corresponded to lipid-rich intermediate or atheromatous disease. In contrast, angiographically diffuse, concentrically narrowed lesions usually were areas of severe fibrous intimal thickening. Fresh or organizing thrombus was most often associated with discrete lesions and accounted for all complete occlusions. Histologic and angiographic comparisons of the degree of luminal narrowing showed generally good correlation for high grade stenoses. Lesions graded as having less than 25% diameter narrowing were often underestimated angiographically as compared with histologic determinations. Transplant coronary artery disease has a heterogeneous histologic and angiographic appearance, with angiographic underestimation of disease in some patients. 
2	Risk factors for gallstones among Chinese in Taiwan. A community sonographic survey. A health survey of adults aged 30 years or more was carried out in southwest Taiwan to determine the prevalence of gallstones and to study risk factors associated with gallstones. Blood samples were collected and abdominal sonographic examination and anthropometric measurements were performed on a total of 923 people. The 40 gallstone cases detected resulted in a prevalence of 4.3%. The risk factors explored included age, sex, hepatitis, obesity, hyperlipidemia, and diabetes mellitus (DM). Age and DM were the only significant factors associated with gallstones in our study. With a reference group of 30-39-year-olds as a comparison, multiple logistic regression analysis showed a trend effect with odds ratios of 1.73, 3.74, and 6.32 for age groups of 40-49, 50-59, and 60 or above, respectively. The odds ratio for DM was as high as 2.59. However, sex, body weight index, chronic hepatitis B, and hyperlipidemia were not significantly associated with gallstones. 
1	Lung cancer in patients younger than 40 years of age. The records of 52 patients younger than 40 years of age who had bronchogenic carcinoma diagnosed between 1965 and 1985 were reviewed. The preponderance of adenocarcinoma (54%), the lower male-female ratio in this age group compared with patients age 40 or older (2:1), the importance of cigarette smoking as a causative factor (80% of patients), the long mean duration of symptoms (5 months), and the high incidence of advanced stage at diagnosis (77% Stages III and IV) in these patients are findings similar to those reported in other published series. There was no significant difference in resectability (23% versus 19%), median survival length (5.3 months versus 6.9 months), median survival length of patients who had surgical resection (10.5 months versus 10.8 months), and 5-year survival rate (11.5% versus 6.3%) in these patients compared with a randomly selected group of 260 patients with lung cancer who were age 40 or older. 
3	Protective and curative effects of rifampicin in Acanthamoeba meningitis of the mouse. BALB/c mice inoculated nasally with Acanthamoeba culbertsoni, resulting in amebic encephalitis and death 3-7 days, were treated with rifampicin prophylactically (daily for 2 days with 75 and 100 mg/kg) and after infection (daily for 5 days with doses of 10-100 mg/kg). Prophylactic treatment resulted in full protection against infection, as assessed by absence of symptoms of central nervous system malfunction and negative brain culture 10 days after inoculation. Curative treatment was effective at the same doses; however, at doses of 10, 25, and 50 mg/kg, only two of six animals were free of symptoms and infection. 
5	Changes in cardiovascular homeostasis after injury are mediated by tissue damage and not haemorrhage. During treatment of the injured patient it is assumed that the cardiovascular responses follow recognized physiological principles. Studies in humans have shown that injury causes a profound suppression of arterial baroreflex function which alters the normal relationship between heart rate and blood pressure and casts doubt on this assumption. To investigate the mechanism of baroreflex suppression, we have studied the effects of the two major components of injury, blood loss and tissue damage, on baroreflex function in healthy volunteers. Baroreflex function was assessed using suction stimulation of the carotid sinus. The loss of 500 ml blood had no effect on baroreflex sensitivity. A human laboratory model of tissue injury reduced the ability of the baroreflex to compensate for a rise in blood pressure (P less than 0.05, Wilcoxon signed rank test). We conclude that tissue damage, rather than hypovolaemia, appears to mediate the effect of injury on baroreflex function in the injured. Blockade of neural signals from damaged tissue may have a role in the treatment of injury. 
4	Venous and arterial thrombosis in patients who received adjuvant therapy for breast cancer. The records of 2,673 patients randomized according to seven consecutive Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) studies of adjuvant therapy for breast cancer were reviewed for the occurrence of vascular complications. All protocols opened and closed between June 1977 and July 1987. The objectives of the present study were (1) to compare the frequency of vascular complications among patients who received adjuvant therapy for breast cancer with patients on observation, and (2) to estimate the contribution of chemotherapy and hormonal therapy to the occurrence of venous and arterial thrombi. The frequency of thrombosis, both venous and arterial combined, was 5.4% among patients who received adjuvant therapy and was 1.6% among patients on observation (P = .0002). Premenopausal patients who received chemotherapy and tamoxifen had significantly more venous complications than those who received chemotherapy without tamoxifen (2.8% v 0.8%, P = .03). Postmenopausal patients who received tamoxifen and chemotherapy had significantly more venous thrombi than those who received tamoxifen alone (8.0% v 2.3%, P = .03) or those who were observed (8.0% v 0.4%, P less than .0001). Premenopausal patients who received tamoxifen and chemotherapy had a 1.6% frequency of arterial thrombosis, significantly more than patients who received chemotherapy alone (1.6% v 0.0%, P = .004). The frequency of arterial thrombosis among postmenopausal patients was not significantly correlated with adjuvant therapy. In conclusion, patients who received adjuvant therapy for breast cancer had a 5.4% frequency of thromboembolic complications, significantly more than those who were observed. The combination of chemotherapy and tamoxifen was associated with more venous and arterial thromboembolic complications than chemotherapy alone in premenopausal patients and with more venous thrombi than tamoxifen alone among postmenopausal patients. 
2	Diagnosis and treatment of cytomegalovirus disease in transplant patients based on gastrointestinal tract manifestations. Infection due to cytomegalovirus is a substantial cause of morbidity and mortality in immunocompromised patients. In particular, cytomegalovirus infection has been associated with a significant detrimental effect on patient and allograft survival after solid-organ transplantation. We are evaluating a new antiviral agent, ganciclovir 9-[1,3-dihydroxy-2-2 propoxymethyl] guanine (DHPG), used in solid-organ transplant recipients who developed life-threatening cytomegalovirus infections. Between March 1, 1987, and June 30, 1989, we treated 93 solid-organ transplant patients who developed tissue-invasive cytomegalovirus disease. From this group of patients we have identified 14 patients with primary gastrointestinal cytomegalovirus disease who received treatment with DHPG. Tissue diagnosis was made by endoscopy of the upper gastrointestinal tract (11 patients) or colonoscopy (three patients). Invasive cytomegalovirus disease was identified prior to severe complications of the gastrointestinal tract in all but one patient, who suffered colonic perforation prior to treatment with DHPG and subsequently died of bacterial sepsis. While 13 of the 14 patients improved after treatment with DHPG, four patients required additional treatments for recurrent cytomegalovirus disease and recovered. No DHPG toxicity was observed. We believe treatment with DHPG is indicated in this patient population, but that further studies are indicated to fully define the impact of this recommendation on both patient and allograft survival after solid-organ transplantation. 
5	Loop ileostomy after ileal pouch-anal anastomosis--is it necessary? Construction of a loop ileostomy is usually advised in patients having an ileal pouch-anal anastomosis to minimize the complication of chronic pelvic sepsis. Formation and closure of a loop ileostomy was associated with a 41 percent and 30 percent complication rate, respectively, in a prospective series of 34 patients. This morbidity must now be assessed in relation to the benefits of avoiding temporary fecal diversion in restorative proctocolectomy. 
5	Interaction of the v-rel protein with an NF-kappa B DNA binding site. The avian reticuloendotheliosis virus T contains within its genome the oncogene rel. The expression of this gene is responsible for the induction of lymphoid tumors in birds. Recently, the rel gene was shown to be related to the p50 DNA binding subunit of the transcription factor complex NF-kappa B. Binding sites for the NF-kappa B complex are found in the enhancer regions of a number of genes, including the immunoglobulin kappa gene and the human immunodeficiency virus long terminal repeat. In this communication we identify an activity from avian reticuloendotheliosis virus T-transformed avian lymphoid cells that binds in an electrophoretic-mobility-shift assay to an NF-kappa B binding site from the kappa enhancer. This activity contains proteins immunologically related to rel, as detected by polyclonal and monoclonal antibodies directed against v-rel. In a DNA affinity precipitation assay using the NF-kappa B site from the human immunodeficiency virus long terminal repeat, v-rel and several other proteins were identified. These data suggest that oncogenic transformation by v-rel is the result of an altered pattern of gene expression. 
1	Endoprosthetic reconstruction after bone tumor resections of the proximal tibia. The advent of successful adjuvant chemotherapy and radiation therapy protocols for primary malignant tumors and the development of custom-designed metallic endoprostheses has now made possible a successful limb salvage procedure for malignancies of the proximal tibia. Use of the transposed medial gastrocnemius flap, as proposed by Dr. Jean Duboussett of Paris, has been critical to the soft-tissue reconstruction that routinely permits an excellent active and passive range of motion for these patients. This article describes the operative techniques and technical considerations necessary for a successful proximal tibial endoprosthesis reconstruction. 
4	A possible role for antiphospholipid antibodies in acquired cardiac valve deformity. We studied the frequency of antiphospholipid antibodies (aPL) in patients undergoing cardiac valve replacement, and present the results in the context of the pathology of the valve lesions. Forty-eight consecutive patients undergoing valve replacement were studied. Of the whole group, 15 (31%) had antibody levels greater than 2 SD above the mean for a control group of healthy persons and 11 (23%) had a level of greater than 3 SD. There was an increased frequency of elevated antibody levels in patients with valves showing fibrocalcific change and a significant association between aPL and valve thrombus. The possible role of these antibodies in the pathogenesis of the valve lesions is discussed. 
5	The distribution of enkephalins in human carotid bodies showing cellular proliferation and chronic glomitis. Human carotid bodies obtained at necropsy that showed prominence of either the sustentacular cell or the dark variant of chief cell or chronic carotid glomitis were studied by an immunogold labeling technique. The peptides methionine and leucine enkephalin had a similar distribution to that found in the normal human carotid body. They were localized prominently and predominantly in the dark and progenitor variants of chief (type I) cells. The sustentacular (type II) cells showed no immunoreactivity for the enkephalins. Cell counts on immunolabeled chief cells in cases of sustentacular cell hyperplasia and chronic carotid glomitis were found to be at the lower end of the normal range, whereas those in dark cell prominence occurred nearer the upper limit. 
4	Heart transplantation in patients with severe pulmonary hypertension and increased pulmonary vascular resistance. Irreversibly increased pulmonary vascular resistance is a contraindication for cardiac transplantation. At our hospital patients referred for recipient evaluation with systolic pulmonary artery pressure greater than 50 mmHg and pulmonary vascular resistance greater than 2 Wood units (Wu) are tested with intravenous sodium nitroprusside for reversibility. In 23 patients whose increased systolic pulmonary artery pressure (67.4 +/- 10.4 mmHg) and resistance (4.8 +/- 2.4 Wu) were reduced by nitroprusside, orthotopic heart transplantation was performed without early mortality. Right heart catheterization after transplantation revealed a significant and persistent fall of the elevated pulmonary artery pressure and pulmonary vascular resistance. We conclude that if severe pulmonary hypertension and elevated pulmonary vascular resistance are reversible with nitroprusside, the patient can safely undergo heart transplantation. 
4	Risks factors for cerebral infarction in good-grade patients after aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage and surgery: a prospective study. A prospective series of 265 patients with aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) of Grades I to III (Hunt and Hess classification) upon admission were evaluated as to neurological outcome and computerized tomography (CT) findings 1 to 3 years (mean 1.4 years) after the SAH and surgery. A total of 73 patients underwent acute surgery (within 72 hours after the bleed: Days 0 to 3), 86 were operated on subacutely (between Days 4 and 7), and 91 had late surgery (on Day 8 or later). Fifteen patients died before surgery was undertaken and another 20 patients died during the follow-up period. A total of 104 patients received nimodipine and the rest of the patients received either placebo (109 patients) or no medication (52 patients). A logistical regression analysis revealed the following prognostic factors for cerebral infarction, in order of importance: the amount of blood on the primary CT scan; postoperative angiographic vasospasm; the timing of the operation; and a history of hypertension. The use of nimodipine was associated with a significant reduction of cerebral infarcts visualized by CT scanning in patients who received intermediate or late surgery. In patients who underwent acute surgery no significant difference between the incidence of cerebral infarcts was observed. 
5	Metaplastic change in mesenchymal stem cells induced by activated ras oncogene. 3T3 T murine mesenchymal stem cells have the potential to differentiate into a variety of different cell types even though they show a predilection to undergo adipocyte differentiation in vitro. The possibility that the activated c-Ha-ras (EJras) oncogene might influence the pathway of differentiation of these stem cells is investigated in the current study. Activated ras oncogene was transfected and stably expressed in 3T3 T cells; assays then were performed to determine its effect on differentiation. The results show that all EJras-transfected cell lines lose their ability to differentiate to adipocytes and instead differentiate into cells that express many characteristics of macrophages. Such cells contain numerous cytoplasmic granules, extensive nonspecific esterase activity, and anchorage-independent growth. The modulation of differentiation pathway from an adipocyte lineage to a macrophagelike cell lineage does not result from the transforming effect of EJras, because a nontransformed cell clone that expresses p21EJras protein also exhibits this modified differentiation pathway. These data suggest that the EJras oncogene specifically modulates the differentiation pathway of 3T3 T mesenchymal stem cells. This experimental system should therefore provide an excellent model to evaluate the mechanistic role of EJras in the process of metaplasia. 
4	Femoral noninfected anastomotic aneurysms. A report of 56 cases. Fifty-six femoral non infected anastomotic false aneurysms (FAAs) were observed in 49 patients admitted to the Institute of Vascular Surgery, University of Milan, from 1975 to 1988; in 6 patients they were bilateral. These aneurysms developed after primary revascularization procedures at a mean interval of 66 months (range 12 to 156 months); one recurred after reparative surgery. Forty-four FAAs (78.6%) were asymptomatic, whereas 3 (5.3%) were complicated by acute expansion and 9 (16.1%) by thrombosis. Host vessel degeneration was the cause of aneurysm formation in most cases. A history of hypertension was present in 30% of the patients. All anastomotic aneurysms were operated upon except for one small aneurysm that was asymptomatic. In 5 patients aneurysm resection was carried out on both sides. The surgical technique was endoaneurysmectomy in all the cases with insertion of an interposition graft in 48 cases, a fabric patch in 2 cases and prosthesis re-anastomosis in 5 cases. One case of peripheral embolization occurring in the early postoperative period was successfully treated and there was no operative mortality. In our opinion elective repair of these aneurysms should be recommended whenever possible because of their propensity to develop serious complications and the operative morbidity is low. 
1	Participation of serotonergic mechanisms in the pathophysiology of experimental neoplastic spinal cord compression. We evaluated the role of serotonin (5-HT) in neoplastic cord compression in paraplegic rats harboring a thoracolumbar epidural tumor. We measured serotonin and its major metabolite, 5-hydroxyindole-3-acetic acid (5-HIAA), in the C-1 to C-7, T-1 to T-6, T-7 to T-12, and T-13 to L-3 spinal segments of tumor-free and tumor-bearing rats. In normal controls, a consistent rostral-to-caudal gradient for 5-HT and 5-HIAA was evident, but the 5-HIAA/5-HT ratio remained constant. In paralyzed rats, 5-HT levels were unchanged, but the 5-HIAA/5-HT ratio was elevated, especially in the compressed segments. Treatment with either dexamethasone or indomethacin delayed onset of paraplegia but had no effect on 5-HT metabolism. Blocking 5-HT receptors by cyproheptadine, evaluated 30 hours after onset of paralysis and treatment, resulted in a reduction in the high water content, vascular permeability, and prostaglandin E2 synthesis in the compressed cord. Early administration of cyproheptadine effectively delayed the onset of paraplegia. These data indicate that receptor-activated serotonergic mechanisms participate in the disruption of the blood-spinal cord barrier and that these effects can be manipulated pharmacologically. 
4	Propranolol and the morning increase in sudden cardiac death: (the beta-blocker heart attack trial experience). To provide insight into the protective effect of propranolol on mortality after myocardial infarction observed in the beta-Blocker Heart Attack Trial, the time of occurrence of sudden cardiac death was examined in this population. Between 5 A.M. and 11 A.M., 25 of the 56 total deaths (38%) occurred in the placebo patients compared with 11 of 45 (24%) in the propranolol patients. Excluding this period, there were nearly equal numbers of sudden cardiac deaths in the propranolol and placebo groups. This retrospective analysis suggests that beta blockade is protective during the morning hours when a surge of sympathetic activity may increase the risk of sudden cardiac death. 
3	Feasibility of reversing benzodiazepine tolerance with flumazenil To examine whether the benzodiazepine antagonist flumazenil can reverse tolerance to benzodiazepines but without precipitating withdrawal seizures, the antiepileptic effect of flumazenil itself and its ability to reverse tolerance at a dose that would leave sufficient receptors free for the binding of benzodiazepines were investigated. Electroencephalographic studies in 6 patients with partial and 6 with generalised seizures showed that flumazenil had a short (20 min) non-dose-dependent suppressant effect on epileptic discharges in those with partial seizures. Receptor occupancy studies in 12 patients showed that 1.5 mg flumazenil given intravenously occupied 55% receptors, whereas 15 mg occupied nearly all receptors. When 3 patients with partial seizures who had become tolerant to clonazepam were given 1.5 mg flumazenil, they were seizure-free for 6-21 days after the injection. The value of intermittent therapy with a benzodiazepine antagonist for preventing or reversing tolerance to benzodiazepine agonists ought to be investigated further. 
5	The hazards of surgical glove dusting powders. Surgical contaminants of many kinds, including glove powder, constitute a source of formation of granulomas. This is particularly well-documented in the peritoneal cavity ("starch peritonitis"), but has been documented in most anatomic sites. The production of starch-free gloves should remove this hazard, but the surgeon should remain aware that most particulate substances introduced into the body inevitably set up an inflammatory response. 
4	Severity of coronary atherosclerosis correlates with the respiratory component of heart rate variability. Decreased vagal activity is frequently observed in coronary artery disease, but the mechanism of this association is unknown. We investigated cardiac autonomic function by relating heart rate spectral components to clinical and angiographic findings in 80 patients who were undergoing coronary angiography. The age- and sex-adjusted magnitude of the respiratory spectral component, which is an index of cardiac vagal tone, showed a significant negative correlation with the extent of coronary atheromatosis (r = -0.43, p less than 0.0001) and a less significant negative correlation with the severity of coronary stenosis (r = -0.30, p = 0.0070). These relationships were independent of previous myocardial infarction and of left ventricular function. Stepwise regression analysis showed that the respiratory spectral component contributed to atheromatosis independently of established coronary risk factors (partial R2 = 9.4%, p = 0.002), but not to stenosis. Our results support the hypothesis that decreased cardiac vagal activity is associated with an increased risk of coronary atherosclerosis. 
4	Rib compression of the coronary arteries. This report describes the finding of coronary artery narrowing caused by compression by an overlying rib in two patients with cardiomegaly. There is probably no clinical significance to this finding. The primary differential diagnostic entity is myocardial bridging. 
5	Facial muscle reanimation using the trigeminal motor nerve: an experimental study in the rabbit. Surgical repair of facial nerve deficits may be marred by lack of muscle control and donor region paresis. Using New Zealand white rabbits, a study was undertaken to evaluate facial muscle reanimation with a donor source not previously used: the motor division of the trigeminal nerve. The results were compared with the severed facial nerve and hypoglossal-facial coaptation. An atrophy scale was calibrated for facial muscles of the rabbit. Clinical, electromyographic, and histomorphometric findings confirmed that the trigeminal nerve was a suitable donor source. The neurorrhaphy produced an exponential rate of repair. 
1	The World Health Organization's histologic classification of gastrointestinal tumors. A commentary on the second edition. The World Health Organization's (WHO) histologic classification of gastrointestinal tumors has been revised. Although the general basis of classification and the overall outline remain similar to the first edition, advances in the last decade justified changes in classifying certain entities; among them were malignant lymphomas, endocrine tumors, and dysplasias. Several newly recognized entities have also been added. 
5	Conduction system injury after aortic valve dilation in the dog single- versus double-balloon catheters. The range of morbidity induced by valvuloplasty is not fully known, but transient conduction disturbances are common. The authors performed aortic valve balloon dilatation on 10 closed-chest dogs with normal aortic valves, using a femoral cutdown approach and fluoroscopic guidance. Four were done with a single 15 mm balloon catheter, and in the other 6 two 12 mm balloon catheters were used. Balloons were inflated to 5 to 12 atms pressure with contrast solution. After several inflations the dogs were sacrificed, the hearts removed and examined. Gross examinations revealed subendocardial hemorrhage in the outflow tract in 5 of the 6 in which double balloons had been used. Microscopically, all aortic valve areas showed hemorrhage, mostly in loose connective tissues of the valve leaflets. The severity of injury appeared greater when two balloons had been used. Histologic examination showed definite injury to the myocytes of the left bundle branch in all 6 of the double-ballooned dogs, but in none of those subjected to the single-balloon procedure. During aortic valve dilation the only manifestation of conduction system injury was prolongation of the QRS complex in 3 of the 6 dogs in which a double-balloon catheter had been used. The results suggest that electrocardiographic conduction disturbances observed in patients undergoing aortic valvuloplasty may be the result of direct injury of conduction tissue and may be more likely to occur when larger balloons are used. 
5	Sudden death behind the wheel from natural disease in drivers of four-wheeled motorized vehicles. The heart was studied in 30 persons who died suddenly from natural causes in the driver's seat of an automobile, truck or bus. Twenty had cardiac arrest while driving and the other 10 while sitting in the driver's seat of a parked vehicle. Of the 20 drivers, 16 died from atherosclerotic coronary artery disease (CAD): 12 (75%) had minor collisions and 4 did not. Of the 16 with fatal CAD, an average of 2.3 +/- 0.8 of the 4 major coronary arteries were narrowed greater than 75% in cross-sectional area (CSA) by plaque; of 668 five-mm segments of the 4 major (right, left main, left anterior descending, left circumflex) coronary arteries in 13 of these 16 cases, 27 (4%) were narrowed 96 to 100% and 127 (19%) were narrowed 76 to 95% in CSA by plaque. The remaining 4 drivers died from noncoronary conditions: aortic rupture associated with the Marfan syndrome in 1; cardiac sarcoidosis in 1; thoracic aortic dissection in 1; and severe mitral regurgitation from infective endocarditis, which had healed in 1. The other 10 persons were found dead in the driver's seat of a parked vehicle and 8 of them had fatal CAD. Of the 8 CAD victims, an average of 2.5 +/- 1.2 of the 4 major coronary arteries was narrowed greater than 75% by plaque; of the 283 five-mm segments of coronary arteries in 7 of the 8 cases, 44 (16%) were narrowed 96 to 100% and 69 (24%) were narrowed 76 to 95% in CSA by plaque. 
2	Comparison of anterior sphincteroplasty and postanal repair in the treatment of idiopathic fecal incontinence. Both postanal repair and anterior sphincteroplasty with levatorplasty have been advocated in the treatment of idiopathic fecal incontinence. To assess the functional results of these procedures, physiologic and radiologic measurements were carried out prospectively in 33 patients with idiopathic incontinence undergoing operative treatment, and 12 age- and sex-matched controls. Sixteen patients had anterior sphincteroplasty and levatorplasty and 17 had postanal repair. A satisfactory postoperative outcome was defined as perfect continence or incontinence of flatus only. Ten patients in the anterior sphincteroplasty group had satisfactory results (64 percent) and 10 in the postanal repair group (59 percent). Preoperatively, both groups had decreased resting and squeeze pressures, impaired and mucosal electrosensitivity, and marked pelvic descent vs. controls. Postoperatively, significant improvement in sphincter pressures and mucosal electrosensitivity was seen in both groups. No significant change in anorectal angle was demonstrated in the postanal repair group, whereas it was made significantly more obtuse in the anterior sphincteroplasty group. It is likely that the improved continence resulting from either of these two procedures is secondary to better anal sphincter muscle function and improved and sensation. It would appear that the anorectal angle is not crucial in maintaining continence. 
5	Intraoperative air testing of colorectal anastomoses: a prospective, randomized trial. A total of 145 consecutive patients receiving a colorectal anastomosis were randomized to 'test' or 'no test' once the anastomosis had been completed. Anastomotic testing was performed with the pelvis filled with saline and the rectum distended by sigmoidoscopic insufflation of air. Any leaks demonstrated were oversewn. A water-soluble contrast enema was performed on the tenth postoperative day. Seventy-four patients were randomized to 'test' and 71 to 'no test' but one patient was withdrawn from each group leaving a total of 143 for analysis. The two groups were well matched for age, sex, diagnosis and operative details. Eighteen (25 per cent) air leaks were detected and repaired in the 'test' group. After operation there were three (4 per cent) clinical leaks in the 'test' group and ten (14 per cent) in the 'no test' group (Fisher's exact test, P = 0.043). There were eight (11 per cent) radiological leaks in the 'test' group and 20 (29 per cent) in the 'no test' group (P = 0.006). Intraoperative air testing and repair of colorectal anastomoses significantly reduces the risk of postoperative clinical and radiological leaks. 
1	Chondrosarcoma of bone in children. Chondrosarcoma of bone rarely occurs in children. This report analyzes the clinicopathologic features in a series of 47 patients with conventional chondrosarcoma who were less than 17 years of age. Of the 47 cases, 14 were from the Mayo Clinic files, and 33 were from our consultation files. Most of the lesions occurred in the trunk and upper ends of the long bones, with the humerus being the most frequent skeletal site. Twelve of the 47 tumors were secondary. The radiographic findings were the same as those seen in adult chondrosarcoma. Pathologically, the tumors were low grade. En bloc resection is the treatment of choice because of the high incidence of local recurrence with lesser surgical margins. Prognosis in childhood chondrosarcoma is no different from that in adult chondrosarcoma. None of the patients with follow-up data had metastasis. 
1	Magnetic resonance imaging of radiation optic neuropathy. Three patients with delayed radiation optic neuropathy after radiation therapy for parasellar neoplasms underwent magnetic resonance imaging. The affected optic nerves and chiasms showed enlargement and focal gadopentetate dimeglumine enhancement. The magnetic resonance imaging technique effectively detected and defined anterior visual pathway changes of radionecrosis and excluded the clinical possibility of visual loss because of tumor recurrence. 
5	Mechanical cardiopulmonary support for refractory cardiogenic shock. From February 1982 to February 1990, 38 patients (30 male patients and 8 female patients) ranging in age from 10 to 78 years (mean 49.4 years) have been supported with arteriovenous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) at St. Louis University Medical Center as a resuscitative system for cardiac arrest or cardiogenic shock. All patients were unresponsive to conventional resuscitative measures including an intraaortic balloon pump in 25 patients. Patients were resuscitated in the intensive care unit, cardiac catheterization laboratory, or the emergency department. Diagnosis varied from acute myocardial infarctions (12 patients), ischemic disease (15 patients), end-stage cardiomyopathy (7 patients), congenital heart disease (3 patients), or postoperative cardiac transplant graft rejection (1 patient). Three patients could not be resuscitated with ECMO because of low flow, but the remaining 35 (92%) achieved hemodynamic stability with ECMO flows greater than 2 L/min/m2. Duration of support ranged from 0.5 to 130 hours (mean 28 hours). Twenty-four patients were successfully weaned from ECMO support after coronary artery bypass (five patients), cardiac transplantation (two patients), or ventricular assist device insertion (eight patients), or with inotropic support (nine patients). Of the 14 patients not weaned, three were inadequately resuscitated, two had percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty while receiving ECMO, and nine were not candidates for further intervention. Nine (24%) patients were discharged and are long-term survivors. Our results indicate that resuscitative ECMO is useful for intervals of 12 to 24 hours and can best be applied with (1) patients younger than 60 years of age; (2) patients having acute events (failed percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty) amenable to surgical intervention; and (3) candidates for cardiac transplantation who could be switched to more sophisticated devices within 12 to 24 hours of ECMO insertion. With these criteria, ECMO, when used as a resuscitative system, can result in increased survival in selected patients with refractory cardiogenic shock or cardiac arrest. 
1	Glucocorticoids locally disrupt an array of positioned nucleosomes on the rat tyrosine aminotransferase promoter in hepatoma cells. Transcriptional activation by steroid hormones is often associated with the appearance of a DNase I hypersensitive site resulting from a local alteration of the nucleoprotein structure of the promoter. For the mouse mammary tumor virus long terminal repeat, a viral promoter under glucocorticoid control, a model has been proposed: the appearance of the hormonodependent DNase I hypersensitive site reflects the displacement of a single precisely positioned nucleosome associated with the glucocorticoid responsive elements. To determine if such a mechanism is of general relevance in transcriptional activation by steroid hormones, we have investigated the nucleosomal organization of the rat tyrosine aminotransferase promoter over a 1-kilobase region that contains the glucocorticoid regulatory target. This region displays a hormonodependent DNase I hypersensitive site. In the absence of hormone, micrococcal nuclease digestion of nuclei demonstrates the presence of positioned nucleosomes, with cutting sites centered around positions -3080, -2900, -2700, -2800, -2255, and -2040. Treatment of the cells with dexamethasone induces a disruption of the chromatin structure over a relatively short stretch of DNA (approximately positions -2400 to -2650) that overlaps two nucleosomes. These observations suggest a strong similarity in the role of chromatin structure in glucocorticoid-dependent transcriptional activation of mouse mammary tumor virus and tyrosine aminotransferase promoters. 
3	A study of immunoglobulin G in the cerebrospinal fluid of 1007 patients with suspected neurological disease using isoelectric focusing and the Log IgG-Index. A comparison and diagnostic applications. Cerebrospinal fluid and serum immunoglobulin G from 1007 patients with suspected neurological disease were analysed by 2 methods: isoelectric focusing for the detection of oligoclonal banding, and quantitative measurement of IgG and albumin for the formulation of a Log IgG-Index. A comparison of the 2 methods in the detection of local synthesis of IgG showed that isoelectric focusing not only gave a much higher yield overall, with 282 patients showing local synthesis versus 225 for the Log IgG-Index, but also a higher specificity, with a false positive rate of 0% versus 3.5%. In addition, of the 282 patients positive by isoelectric focusing only 163 (58%) were positive by the Log IgG-Index. Of the 1007 patients studied, 206 had multiple sclerosis (MS), and isoelectric focusing showed local synthesis in 95% of clinically definite cases, with a 90% detection rate overall. The Log IgG-Index was positive in only 67% of clinically definite cases, with an overall 59% detection rate. Thus with the exceptions noted above, local synthesis of IgG as defined by isoelectric focusing is confined to demyelinating, inflammatory, infectious and postinfectious disorders. Our results compare very favourably with the published sensitivities of magnetic resonance imaging in the detection of abnormalities in multiple sclerosis, and better than those for evoked potentials. Where both these investigations are readily available isoelectric focusing provides a useful adjunct. For the majority of physicians and neurologists who do not have ready access to magnetic resonance imaging, isoelectric focusing is an excellent alternative. We would also recommend that it become the standard for the measurement of IgG abnormalities in the cerebrospinal fluid and that the use of quantitative data be abandoned for routine purposes. 
4	The incidence of myocarditis in endomyocardial biopsy samples from patients with congestive heart failure. We present the combined experience of three Yugoslavian cardiovascular centers in the application of endomyocardial biopsy for the diagnosis of myocarditis in patients who present clinically with congestive heart failure. The study group comprised 107 patients (mean age, 40.8 years; range, 19 to 61 years). On the basis of patient history and diagnostic tests, the following clinical diagnoses were established: dilated cardiomyopathy (85), myocarditis (16), and alcohol-induced heart disease (6). EMB samples were taken from the left ventricle (95) or both ventricles (12) by use of a King's College bioptome, with a mean of 3.2 samples per patient. Histologic evidence of myocarditis was noted in 10 of 85 patients (12%) with a clinical diagnosis of dilated cardiomyopathy, in 2 of 6 patients (33%) with alcohol-induced heart disease, and in 12 of 16 patients (75%) with a clinical diagnosis of myocarditis. There was confirmation of the clinically suspected diagnosis in 63% of cases, a change of diagnosis based on histology in 15% of cases, and nonspecific findings in 22%. However, useful information was obtained in 78% of the cases, and there was a 22% incidence of histologically proven myocarditis for the entire group. Our results indicate that endomyocardial biopsy is beneficial in determining the true incidence of myocarditis in patients with a clinical presentation of dilated cardiomyopathy. 
1	Peritumoral blood flow in intracranial meningiomas. Blood flow was measured in intratumoral tissue, the cerebral hemispheres and particularly in the peritumoral area of 12 patients with intracranial meningiomas using the stable xenon-enhanced computed tomographic scan. Tumor blood flow frequently showed a heterogeneous pattern of enhancement with high flow at the tumor periphery and a central area of hypoperfusion. Blood flow values were on average 28% lower in the peritumoral area than in the ipsilateral cerebral hemisphere. In individual cases, blood flow values in the peritumoral edematous area were very low. These findings suggest that the hypodense area surrounding meningiomas does not solely represent vasogenic edema, but may actually represent tumor pressure ischemia. 
4	The legal implications of dietary fats: risks of cardiovascular disease and the duty of food manufacturers. The arguments for a warning on foodstuffs open new ground in product liability. Some of the dangers of fat-laden foods have been apparent for many years and are widely known to the public. Other aspects of fat consumption, specifically hidden fats, such as saturated fats, have only recently been explored, and are known to a limited segment of the population at risk. Negligence and warranty theories are too narrow to encompass this situation, wherein the benefits and risks of a product are not well defined and not easily separable. Some warning about the dangers resulting from fat ingestion is necessary, but may be adequately dispensed by ingredient labeling. If consumers are aware of the potential for harm, then they are assuming a substantial portion of the risk. How risk-free can we, or should we, make our society? The marketplace is the appropriate venue for determining the acceptance of saturated-fat-containing products by our society. Clear and open labeling policies will allow consumers to weigh the relative advantages and disadvantages of lower fat intake. Warnings of fat content need not be extreme, but should disclose the possible physiological outcome of the heavy ingestion of saturated fat. 
5	Might free arterial grafts fail due to spasm? The rat femoral artery was used as a free graft and was studied after 2, 7, 14, 30, and 60 days. The patency of the grafts was 100% (2 days, n = 6), 78% (7 days, n = 9), 63% (14 days, n = 8), 33% (30 days, n = 12), and 18% (60 days, n = 11). Histology showed an intimal thickening after 14 days and the media, which in the controls consisted of eight to ten layers of myocytes, was reduced to six to eight cell layers. During the first 2 weeks the graft segments had an impaired contraction when exposed to Krebs solution with 124 mmol/L K+, whereas after 1 month and later the graft segments approached the controls or had even higher contractile force. The thromboxane mimic U-46619 elicited full contractile force at all times whereas the potency was significantly lower during the first 14 days. Noradrenaline was unable to induce contraction in the graft segments during the first 14 days, but at 30 and 60 days it had regained full contractile force and was significantly more potent (approximately 60 times) in the graft segments compared with the controls. This study suggests that intimal thickening and hypercontractility might be a problem in free muscular arterial grafts. 
1	Anti-tumor X anti-lymphocyte heteroconjugates augment colon tumor cell lysis in vitro and prevent tumor growth in vivo. Cross-linking an anti-tumor antibody, specific for tumor cell surface antigens, and an anti-lymphocyte antibody, specific for the T lymphocyte receptor complex (TCR/CD3), produces a heteroconjugate that can direct T cells to lyse tumor cells. We tested the ability of anti-tumor X anti-lymphocyte (CD3) heteroconjugates to redirect human peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBLs) to lyse human colon cancer cells in cytotoxicity assays and in a murine colon tumor model. We demonstrated in vitro, that cultured human PBLs alone produced low levels of tumor lysis, but PBLs treated with anti-tumor X anti-CD3 heteroconjugates produced significantly greater tumor cell lysis (P less than 0.0025). Similarly, nude mice injected with LS174T human colon cancer cells and treated with cultured human PBLs and anti-tumor X anti-CD3 heteroconjugates survived significantly longer than saline control mice (P less than 0.01), or mice treated with PBLs alone (P less than 0.01), or heteroconjugates alone (P less than 0.05). F(ab')2 heteroconjugates were equally as effective in prolonging animal survival, but irrelevant heteroconjugates and monoclonal anti-tumor antibodies showed no therapeutic benefit. Anti-tumor X anti-CD3 heteroconjugates may represent an effective approach to tumor-specific cellular immunotherapy. 
4	The syndrome of bilateral hemispheric border zone ischemia. Symptoms compatible with vertebrobasilar ischemia have been reported in patients with unilateral or bilateral carotid occlusive disease. Intracranial steal phenomena have been proposed to explain the symptoms. In a review of 54 patients with angiographically documented severe bilateral carotid stenosis (less than or equal to 2 mm residual lumen) or occlusion, eight had symptoms suggesting vertebrobasilar insufficiency. Five patients were identified retrospectively, and the other three were evaluated prospectively. Symptoms included various combinations of hemodynamically mediated, transient bilateral motor, sensory, or visual impairment. Dysarthria, dysphagia, and diplopia were generally absent. Each patient also described additional symptoms compatible with transient hemispheric or retinal ischemia. The anatomic regions subserving the bilateral vertebrobasilar-like symptoms could be correlated with angiographically estimated arterial border zones in both hemispheres and may thus represent bilateral hemispheric border zone ischemia rather than brain stem ischemia. An intracranial steal need not be invoked. 
5	Traumatic asphyxia. Traumatic asphyxia is a distinctive clinical syndrome characterized by cervicofacial cyanosis and edema, multiple petechiae, and subconjunctival hemorrhage after a severe crush injury of the thorax or of the upper part of the abdomen. A case of traumatic asphyxia is reported, and its clinical and pathophysiologic features are discussed. 
1	Combined tensor fasciae latae musculocutaneous flap and sartorius musculocutaneous flap for the repair of wide defects of the lower leg. The tensor fasciae latae musculocutaneous flap has great advantages for reconstruction of the abdominal wall, but the medial border of its territory is limited to the thigh. In order to expand the territory, a combined tensor fasciae latae musculocutaneous flap and sartorius musculocutaneous flap was devised. This flap was successfully used to resurface a large defect in the lower leg as a distally based musculocutaneous flap. The advantages of this flap are its extremely large territory, the fact that total necrosis of the flap cannot occur, and that as a proximally or distally pedicled flap it is suitable for large defects in the abdominal wall, lower leg, and gluteal region. 
5	Pelvic resections: the Rizzoli Institute experience. Materials, methods, and techniques of pelvic resections are discussed. Results, including the complications of nerve damage, infection, and vascular, visceral, and reconstructive complications are tabulated. 
5	The use of internalised ureteric stents in renal transplant recipients. Since 1982, we have used internal indwelling ureteric stents for the management and prevention of ureteric reconstruction complications in 28 renal allograft recipients. A total of 30 stents were placed in 18 patients either diagnostically or therapeutically in the management of allograft ureteric obstruction. In 16 patients internal stents were placed at the time of reconstruction for primary ureteropyelostomy (3), secondary ureteropyelostomy (8), repeat reimplant (3) and repair of ureteric or pelviureteric junction injury (2). Complications included 3 episodes of transplant pyelonephritis, proximal stent migration (1), persistent bacteriuria (1) and prolonged healing of a ureteropyelostomy (1). Internalised ureteric stenting is a safe and effective means of managing or preventing ureteric reconstruction complications in renal transplant recipients. 
4	Usefulness of the automatic implantable cardioverter defibrillator in improving survival of patients with severely depressed left ventricular function associated with coronary artery disease. Clinical outcome was analyzed among a group of 39 consecutive patients with coronary artery disease, left ventricular (LV) ejection fractions less than 30% and arrhythmias that required an automatic implantable cardioverter defibrillator (AICD) in an attempt to better define the role of the device in patients with severely depressed LV function. Twenty-nine (74%) were survivors of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest and 10 (26%) had ventricular tachycardia that was refractory to electrophysiologically guided antiarrhythmic therapy. The study group had the following demographic characteristics: 90% were men, mean age was 64 years (range 41 to 79) and mean LV ejection fraction was 21 +/- 4%. Concomitant pharmacotherapy included antiarrhythmic drugs 31 (79%), vasodilators in 22 (56%) and digoxin in 20 (51%). There was no statistical difference in baseline characteristics between survivors and nonsurvivors. Patients were followed for a mean of 24 months (range 2 to 72) from implantation. The difference between actuarial survival--77% at 1 year and 72% at 2 years--and projected survival without the AICD (patients who survive without appropriate device discharge)--30% at 1 year and 21% at 2 years--was significant (p less than 0.01 and less than 0.05 at 1 and 2 years, respectively). This study suggests that the AICD improves survival in patients with coronary artery disease despite severely depressed LV function. 
3	Bacterial meningitis in adults. Bacterial meningitis continues to be an important cause of morbidity and mortality despite the availability of effective bactericidal antibiotics. Penicillin or ampicillin remains the drug of choice for meningitis caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae and Neisseria meningitidis. The third generation cephalosporins have revolutionized the treatment of gram-negative meningitis. Future therapy for bacterial meningitis will use recent developments in the understanding of pathogenic and pathophysiologic mechanisms underlying this disease. 
1	Presence of identical mitochondrial proteins in unstimulated constitutive steroid-producing R2C rat Leydig tumor and stimulated nonconstitutive steroid-producing MA-10 mouse Leydig tumor cells. The acute regulation of steroidogenesis in steroidogenic tissues requires de novo protein synthesis. It is believed that these newly synthesized proteins are instrumental in the delivery of the substrate, cholesterol, to the inner mitochondrial membrane where the cholesterol side-chain cleavage complex converts cholesterol to pregnenolone. A number of studies have attempted to characterize the protein(s) synthesized in response to hormone stimulation and, hence, function in the delivery of cholesterol to the cholesterol side-chain cleavage complex. While a number of potential protein candidates have been described, there is at present no unequivocal evidence which indicates that they are involved in steroidogenic regulation. We and others have described proteins that are induced in a variety of steroidogenic tissues in response to hormone stimulation and are localized in the mitochondria of these tissues. In an attempt to determine whether these induced proteins may be involved in steroidogenesis, we compared mitochondrial protein profiles in two separate Leydig tumor cell line. One cell line, the MA-10 mouse Leydig tumor cell line, has a very low basal steroid production, but synthesizes large amounts of progesterone in response to both tropic hormone and cAMP analog. The other cell line, the R2C rat Leydig tumor cell line, produces constitutively large amounts of progesterone, which cannot be increased further with hormone stimulation. Two-dimensional polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis profiles of newly synthesized mitochondrial proteins demonstrated that four 30-kDa proteins are induced in response to hormonal stimulation in MA-10 cells. Further, it was shown that proteins identical to these induced proteins are present constitutively in the mitochondria of R2C cells and cannot be further increased with hormone stimulation. These results strongly suggest that the 30-kDa mitochondrial proteins shown to be induced in several steroidogenic tissues are involved in the acute regulation of steroid production. 
3	Randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of nimodipine in acute stroke. Trust Study Group. The value of oral nimodipine 120 mg per day for acute stroke was assessed in a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled multicentre study of 1215 patients. The primary end-point was independence after 6 months, defined as a score of 60 or more on an activities of daily living (ADL) scale, the Barthel index. Patients were entered into the trial if they were aged over 40, became hemiparetic in the previous 48 h, were conscious, were able to swallow, and had been living independently before the stroke. At 6 months, 55% of the nimodipine group and 58% of the placebo group were independent, the odds ratio for independence on nimodipine being 0.88 (95% confidence limits 0.70-1.10). For mortality the odds ratio with nimodipine was 1.22 (95% confidence limits 0.95-1.57). ADL and neurological scores also suggested delayed recovery in the nimodipine group at 3 weeks. The results do not support the case for oral nimodipine therapy 120 mg per day starting within 48 h of the stroke, for patients with acute stroke. 
5	U1 small nuclear RNA plays a direct role in the formation of a rev-regulated human immunodeficiency virus env mRNA that remains unspliced. rev-regulated expression of HIV-1 envelope proteins from a simian virus 40 late replacement vector was found to be dependent on the presence of a 5' splice site in the env mRNA in spite of the fact that this mRNA remains unspliced. When the 5' splice site upstream of the env open reading frame was deleted or mutated, expression of envelope protein was lost. RNA analysis of cells transfected with 5' splice-site mutants showed a dramatic reduction in the steady-state levels of env mRNA whether or not rev was present. Envelope expression could be restored in one of the 5' splice-site mutants by cotransfection with a plasmid expressing a suppressor U1 small nuclear RNA containing a compensatory mutation. These experiments show that U1 small nuclear RNA plays a direct and essential role in the formation of an unspliced RNA that is subject to regulation by rev. 
1	Renal cell carcinoma vs. renal oncocytoma. Report of a case with overlap features and review of the literature Although the salient features of renal oncocytomas and renal cell carcinomas have been discussed in the recent literature, renal masses with features of both entities will present diagnostic difficulty, especially when the cells are diffusely eosinophilic on microscopic examination. A case of a firm, tan, rounded mass replacing the lower pole of the kidney is discussed. The final diagnosis of renal cell carcinoma, granular cell type, was made after multiple sections of the tumor were examined, and after electron microscopy was performed. A thorough search by light microscopy should be made for clear cell foci, necrosis, mitotic activity, and vascular or capsular invasion, features generally accepted as pathognomonic for renal cell carcinoma. Cellular and especially nuclear pleomorphism is typically focal or mild in renal oncocytomas. True oncocytic tumors will be packed with mitochondria on electron microscopy; however, granular renal cell carcinomas will contain mitochondria as well as other cellular organelles, lipid, and glycogen. Electron microscopy should be performed on tumors suspected of being oncocytomas because eosinophilia on hematoxylin and eosin stain, as demonstrated by this case, is not a predictable measure of mitochondria content. Immunoperoxidase staining for vimentin in oncocytomas has recently been shown to be negative, and may offer a method of ruling out oncocytoma in vimentin-positive tumors, pending further studies. 
4	Delayed rupture of a pseudoaneurysm of the costocervical trunk: treatment with therapeutic embolization. Fourteen days after removal of an internal jugular catheter inserted prior to renal transplantation, a patient presented with brisk arterial hemorrhage from the insertion site. The hemorrhage, caused by a ruptured pseudoaneurysm of the costocervical trunk, was controlled by transcatheter embolization with gelatin particles. One year later the patient reported no problems related to the pseudoaneurysm or its management. 
1	Simple technique for long term central venous access in the patient with thrombocytopenic carcinoma. A technique for the insertion of a central venous access device in the patient with thrombocytopenia is described. Using the Seldinger technique, a wire is placed into the internal jugular vein. A catheter tunneled from the anterior part of the chest is inserted through a peel-away sheath into the central venous system. The incision is then closed. 
4	Hypertensive heart disease in African-Americans. Hypertensive heart disease is a frequent complication in hypertensive African-Americans because of inadequate high blood pressure control. Moreover, African-Americans may be predisposed to develop LVH earlier in life and more readily than Caucasians, and it may be more malignant. The appearance of both LVH and congestive heart failure are ominous developments in individual patients, and early detection of LVH is mandatory for adequate management and reversal of this complication, if possible. Additional research is needed, and new, sensitive tools for detecting LVH will accelerate such studies. Further investigations are also needed on the reversibility of LVH, preferred antihypertensive agents for accomplishing reversal, and whether expected benefits result. 
3	Neurobehavioral outcome 1 year after severe head injury. Experience of the Traumatic Coma Data Bank. The outcome 1 year after they had sustained a severe head injury was investigated in patients who were admitted to the neurosurgery service at one of four centers participating in the Traumatic Coma Data Bank (TCDB). Of 300 eligible survivors, the quality of recovery 1 year after injury was assessed by at least the Glasgow Outcome Scale (GOS) in 263 patients (87%), whereas complete neuropsychological assessment was performed in 127 (42%) of the eligible survivors. The capacity of the patients to undergo neuropsychological testing 1 year after injury was a criterion of recovery as reflected by a significant relationship to neurological indices of acute injury and the GOS score at the time of hospital discharge. The neurobehavioral data at 1 year after injury were generally comparable across the four samples of patients and characterized by impairment of memory and slowed information processing. In contrast, language and visuospatial ability recovered to within the normal range. The lowest postresuscitation Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score and pupillary reactivity were predictive of the 1-year GOS score and neuropsychological performance. The lowest GCS score was especially predictive of neuropsychological performance 1 year postinjury in patients who had at least one nonreactive pupil following resuscitation. Notwithstanding limitations related to the scope of the TCDB and attrition in follow-up material, the results indicate a characteristic pattern of neurobehavioral recovery from severe head injury and encourage the use of neurobehavioral outcome measurements in clinical trials to evaluate interventions for head-injured patients. 
2	Ichthyosis, exocrine pancreatic insufficiency, impaired neutrophil chemotaxis, growth retardation, and metaphyseal dysplasia (Shwachman syndrome). Report of a case with extensive skin lesions (clinical, histological, and ultrastructural findings). The Shwachman syndrome comprises exocrine pancreatic insufficiency, growth retardation, and bone marrow hypoplasia resulting in neutropenia. Clinical, morphological, and ultrastructural studies, as well as hair analysis, were performed in a patient with Shwachman's syndrome and severe ichthyosis. Clinical findings were lamellar ichthyosiform desquamation on the extremities. The hair was scanty and short on the scalp, in the eyelashes, and in the eyebrows. The nails were hyperkeratotic. Morphologic findings were slight, regular acanthosis and severe diffuse hyperkeratosis with variable parakeratosis. The granular layer was thickened. The papillary dermis showed very slight perivascular lymphocyte infiltration. The most prominent ultrastructural finding was the presence of solitary or multiple droplets of varying size in the cytoplasm of the keratinocytes. Hair analysis revealed no abnormalities; the cystine concentration in hair specimens was normal. 
5	Partial cytochrome b deficiency and generalized dystonia. An 18-year-old female had clinical features of idiopathic torsion dystonia with bilateral hypodense putaminal lesions on computed tomography. Mitochondrial encephalomyopathy was suspected because of persistent lactic acidemia and myopathy. Studies of oxidative metabolism on isolated skeletal muscle mitochondria revealed partial cytochrome b deficiency indicating a defect in the cytochrome b- c1 complex. This finding represents a unique, multisystem syndrome of progressive dystonia, putaminal degeneration, myopathy, and mitochondrial cytochrome b deficiency. Mitochondrial metabolic disorders may be a cause of torsion dystonia when other known associated factors are absent. 
1	Mortality among workers at Oak Ridge National Laboratory. Evidence of radiation effects in follow-up through 1984 [published erratum appears in JAMA 1991 Aug 7;266(5):657] White men hired at the Oak Ridge (Tenn) National Laboratory between 1943 and 1972 were followed up for vital status through 1984 (N = 8318, 1524 deaths). Relatively low mortality compared with that in US white men was observed for most causes of death, but leukemia mortality was elevated in the total cohort (63% higher, 28 deaths) and in workers who had at some time been monitored for internal radionuclide contamination (123% higher, 16 deaths). Median cumulative dose of external penetrating radiation was 1.4 mSv; 638 workers had cumulative doses above 50 mSv (5 rem). After accounting for age, birth cohort, a measure of socioeconomic status, and active worker status, external radiation with a 20-year exposure lag was related to all causes of death (2.68% increase per 10 mSv) primarily due to an association with cancer mortality (4.94% per 10 mSv). Studies of this population through 1977 did not find radiation-cancer mortality associations, and identical analyses using the shorter follow-up showed that associations with radiation did not appear until after 1977. The radiation-cancer dose response is 10 times higher than estimates from the follow-up of survivors of the bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, Japan, but similar to one previous occupational study. Dose-response estimates are subject to uncertainties due to potential problems, including measurement of radiation doses and cancer outcomes. Longer-term follow-up of this and other populations with good measurement of protracted low-level exposures will be critical to evaluating the generalizability of the results reported herein. 
2	Blunt trauma of the abdomen in children. Abdominal trauma in children is usually due to motor vehicle accidents or falls, but child abuse is also a common cause. Injuries to the small intestine are particularly worrisome because symptoms may not appear for hours, days, or even weeks. This can cause significant difficulty for the investigator trying to determine when an injury occurred, or who may have caused it. 
4	Advantages of beta blockers versus antiarrhythmic agents and calcium antagonists in secondary prevention after myocardial infarction. Patients who have sustained greater than or equal to 1 myocardial infarcts are at high risk for sudden death or reinfarction; the risk is highest for those with lowest ventricular ejection fraction, continuing myocardial ischemia and asymptomatic high-density and complex premature ventricular contractions. At present, beta blockers when given prophylactically are the only agents that reduce the incidence of sudden death and reinfarction in survivors of myocardial infarction (MI) in the first 2 years. The beneficial effect was shown to correlate with a reduction in heart rate, the effect being absent or deleterious with beta blockers with marked sympathomimetic activity. The effects of beta blockers on ventricular fibrillation appeared to be dissociated from those on premature ventricular contractions. Trials with calcium antagonists indicate that these drugs had no effect or increased the mortality rate. The divergent effect of beta blockers and calcium antagonists is unexplained but may be due in part to a lack of bradycardiac effect of calcium antagonists; there were no differences in effect among different calcium antagonists. Data from trials involving class I antiarrhythmic agents indicate that agents acting by depression of cardiac conduction are either devoid of effect or produce a modest increase in mortality. Results of the Cardiac Arrhythmia Suppression Trial, employing the newer class I agents flecainide and encainide, were used to determine whether the suppression of premature ventricular contractions in the survivors of acute MI reduces mortality. Flecainide and encainide suppressed premature ventricular contractions greater than 80%, but resulted in an increased mortality rate undoubtedly due to a marked proarrhythmic effect. Whether these data can be extrapolated to all class I agents is uncertain. Preliminary data with class III antiarrhythmic agents suggest that these agents, especially amiodarone, similarly to beta blockers, have the potential to reduce mortality in survivors of MI. Evolving data suggest that in the secondary prevention of morbid events in the survivors of acute MI, the focus must shift away from antiarrhythmic agents that delay conduction and toward beta blockers and antifibrillatory actions resulting from a prolongation of refractoriness. 
1	Management of perineal wounds following abdominoperineal resection with inferior gluteal flaps. Our experience treating perineal wounds secondary to abdominoperineal resection, either for inflammatory bowel disease or cancer, is presented. A total of 16 patients were treated either on a delayed basis or at the same time as the abdominoperineal resection. All wounds were closed using the inferior gluteal myocutaneous flap. Fifteen of 16 patients have achieved healing, eight of whom had no complications. Only minor revisions or local wound care were required in the remaining patients, with only one patient failing to heal. Our results compare favorably with previous reports of treatment of this difficult problem. 
3	Assessment of Proplast-Teflon disc replacements [published erratum appears in J Oral Maxillofac Surg 1991 Feb;49(2):220] This retrospective study reports the findings in the follow-up of 31 temporomandibular joints in which Proplast-Teflon (Vitek Inc, Houston, TX) replacements were used. Among the problems noted were pain, malocclusion, restricted opening, and degenerative changes in the condyle and fossa. 
5	Adult hepatic fibropolycystic disease presenting as obstructive jaundice. Obstructive jaundice caused by compression of the common hepatic duct by a simple hepatic cyst in a 31 year old Europid man is reported. The jaundice and duct compression resolved after percutaneous aspiration of the cyst under ultrasound direction and the patient has been well for 12 months. 
3	Meningeal involvement in Bence Jones multiple myeloma. A case of Bence Jones kappa multiple myeloma with meningeal involvement in a 64-year-old woman is presented. Three years after the diagnosis of multiple myeloma, gait disturbances developed followed by visual disorders and impaired consciousness. A lumbar puncture revealed numerous atypical plasma cells in the cerebrospinal fluid. Craniospinal irradiation and intrathecal injections of methotrexate, cytarabine, and prednisolone were effective for a short period. At autopsy, the leptomeninges were infiltrated diffusely with atypical plasma cells. A review of the literature showed that multiple myeloma with meningeal involvement is accompanied frequently by circulating atypical plasma cells or plasma cell leukemia. Meningeal involvement is a rare complication and shows poor prognosis in cases of multiple myeloma. 
5	Reliability of six pulse oximeters in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Six pulse oximeters with finger probes were studied in three groups of 17 hypoxemic patients with COPD aged 50 to 75 years. Transcutaneous arterial oxygen saturation (SpO2) was measured with the Nellcor N101 (oximeter 1a), the Ohmeda Biox III (oximeter lb), the Nellcor N200 (oximeter 2a), the Critikon Oxyshuttle (oximeter 2b), the Radiometer Oxi100 (oximeter 3a), and the Ohmeda Biox 3700 (oximeter 3b). The SpO2 was compared with SaO2 measured in simultaneously withdrawn samples of arterial blood (Radiometer OSM2) at three 20-minute steady-state levels of FIO2 ranging from 0.21 to 0.40 (SaO2, 62 to 100 percent). The bias (mean SpO2-SaO2 difference) and the error in precision (SD of the differences) were both below 4 percent for instruments 1a and 1b and remained below 1.2 and 3 percent, respectively, for the others. A good agreement between SpO2 and SaO2, as reflected by the Bartko intraclass correlation coefficient, was observed in instruments 2a, 3a, and 3b. The individual relationships between SpO2-SaO2 differences and SaO2 appeared to be linear and parallel. With four instruments (1a, 1b, 2a, and 2b), the mean slope of this relationship was negative, showing a systematic instrumental error: the lower the SaO2, the larger the overestimation of SaO2. The scattering of the data (precision) principally reflects a subject source of error. In most instruments a technical adjustment could greatly improve instrumental errors and accuracy. The correction of the errors due to between-subject variation would require a system of calibration adjustable by the users to each individual. 
5	Nipple discharge in women. Is it cause for concern? Nipple discharge is one of the most common breast complaints in women. Galactorrhea (milky discharge) may occur during pregnancy or breast-feeding or as a result of drug therapy, hypothyroidism, or hyperthyroidism. Nonbloody discharge is most common and is usually benign. Bloody discharge should be considered a sign of cancer until proved otherwise. Persistent galactorrhea and nonbloody discharge can be treated by transecting the mammary ducts. Simple mastectomy may be appropriate in patients with persistent bloody discharge who have a strong family history of breast cancer. 
5	Flexion-extension views in the evaluation of cervical-spine injuries. STUDY OBJECTIVE: To determine the efficacy of flexion-extension (F/E) cervical-spine radiographs in detecting acute cervical-spine instability in emergency patients. DESIGN: We retrospectively reviewed the charts of 141 consecutive trauma patients who had F/E views performed after a routine cervical-spine series (three views) was obtained in the emergency department. Interpretations of the routine series were compared with those of the F/E views to determine if additional useful information was provided by the latter. The charts also were reviewed to determine if any variables were associated with an increased use of F/E views, an increased likelihood of these views demonstrating instability, or any neurologic sequelae resulted from these studies. SETTING: An urban Level I adult trauma center. MEASUREMENTS: The interpretations of the routine series were noted to be either normal, abnormal but without demonstrable fracture/dislocation, or demonstrating a fracture/dislocation. The F/E views were categorized as stable, unstable, or uninterpretable. RESULTS: Cervical-spine instability was demonstrated by F/E views in 11 of the 141 patients (8%), four of whom had normal routine cervical-spine films. Three of these four patients required surgical stabilization. Prolonged neck pain (more than 24 hours), an initially abnormal spine series, and a neurosurgical consult were all associated with an increased use of F/E views. Ten of 11 patients with radiographic instability had significant neck pain by history; the remaining patient was intoxicated. No neurologic sequelae resulted from performing F/E studies. There was one false-negative F/E study, which raises concern about the reliability of this procedure in the ED. CONCLUSION: We believe that a large prospective study is required to determine which patients warrant F/E views. 
1	Acinic cell carcinoma. Clinicopathologic review. The authors reviewed 90 cases of acinic cell carcinoma treated at the Mayo Clinic to assess long-term follow-up and to study features predictive of disease progression. Sixty-three patients (55 females and 35 males) were seen for primary treatment; 27 had recurrent disease when first evaluated. Histologically, these tumors were composed of serous acinar cells and intercalated duct-type cells. Morphologic patterns included solid, microcystic, follicular, and papillary-cystic. All patients were followed for at least 10 years or until death. Of the primary treatment group, 44% had local recurrence, 19% had metastasis, and 25% died of disease. Disease first recurred locally up to 30 years after presentation and resulted in death after as many as 38 years. Poor prognostic features include pain or fixation; gross invasion; microscopic features of desmoplasia, atypia, or increased mitotic activity; and excision as initial treatment. Neither morphologic pattern nor cell composition was a predictive feature. 
1	Fibrosarcoma of the head and neck. The UCLA experience. Between 1955 and 1987, twenty-nine patients with the diagnosis of fibrosarcoma of the head and neck were seen at the UCLA Medical Center. Follow-up ranged from 15 to 192 months, with a median of 66 months. Absolute 5-year survival was 62% (13/21). Five of 17 patients treated initially with surgery alone achieved local control and long-term survival. All five had low-grade lesions. Five patients received postoperative radiation therapy because of positive surgical margins. Three were rendered disease free, and all had low-grade lesions. Radiation therapy was used as primary treatment in six patients, four of whom received additional chemotherapy. Of these six, two are disease free with longer than 5-year follow-up. Surgery with and without adjuvant therapy successfully salvaged 42% (5/12) of the patients with local recurrence. Eighty percent (12/15) of the patients with low-grade lesions were ultimately rendered disease free vs only 8% (1/12) of the patients with high-grade histologic features. Seventy-two percent (13/18) of the patients with local recurrence were known to have positive surgical margins. Sixty-eight percent (13/19) of the patients with recurrent disease had high-grade lesions and/or tumor size larger than 5 cm. Tumor grade is the most important prognostic factor followed by tumor size and surgical margin status. Patients with low-grade lesions and adequate surgical margins are treated well with surgery alone. Patients with high-grade lesions or positive surgical margins should receive adjuvant treatment. 
1	Dexamethasone inhibits the induction of monocyte chemotactic-activating factor production by IL-1 or tumor necrosis factor. Recently purified and molecularly cloned monocyte chemotactic and activating factor (MCAF) may play a major role in recruiting and activating monocytes in the inflammatory process. We examined the effects of a potent anti-inflammatory agent, dexamethasone (DXS), on the production of this factor. Over a wide range of concentrations (10(-5) to 10(-8) M), DXS inhibited the production of MCAF at the mRNA and protein level in a human fibrosarcoma cell line, which was stimulated with either IL-1 or TNF-alpha. We examined the turn-over of synthesized MCAF mRNA that showed DXS decreased the stability of MCAF mRNA. Furthermore, the addition of actinomycin D and cycloheximide abolished this effect of DXS, indicating that de novo mRNA and protein synthesis were required for this process. In addition, a nuclear run-off analysis revealed that DXS also inhibited the transcription of IL-1- or TNF-activated MCAF genes. Therefore, both the destabilization of MCAF mRNA and the inhibition of transcription of the gene contribute to the decrease in the MCAF mRNA steady state level by DXS. 
3	Approach to diagnosis of meningitis. Cerebrospinal fluid evaluation. CSF evaluation is the single most important aspect of the laboratory diagnosis of meningitis. Analysis of the CSF abnormalities produced by bacterial, mycobacterial, and fungal infections may greatly facilitate diagnosis and direct initial therapy. Basic studies of CSF that should be performed in all patients with meningitis include measurement of pressure, cell count and white cell differential; determination of glucose and protein levels; Gram's stain; and culture. In bacterial meningitis, Limulus lysate assay and tests to identify bacterial antigens may allow rapid diagnosis. Where there is strong suspicion of tuberculous or fungal meningitis, CSF should also be submitted for acid-fast stain, India ink preparation, and cryptococcal antigen; unless contraindicated by increased intracranial pressure, large volumes (up to 40-50 mL) should be obtained for culture. If a history of residence in the Southwest is elicited, complement-fixing antibodies to Coccidioides immitis should also be ordered. Newer tests based on immunologic methods or gene amplification techniques hold great promise for diagnosis of infections caused by organisms that are difficult to culture or present in small numbers. Despite the great value of lumbar puncture in the diagnosis of meningitis, injudicious use of the procedure may result in death from brain herniation. Lumbar puncture should be avoided if focal neurologic findings suggest concomitant mass lesion, as in brain abscess, and lumbar puncture should be approached with great caution if meningitis is accompanied by evidence of significant intracranial hypertension. Institution of antibiotic therapy for suspected meningitis should not be delayed while neuroradiologic studies are obtained to exclude abscess or while measures are instituted to reduce intracranial pressure. 
1	E1a-dependent expression of adenovirus genes in OTF963 embryonal carcinoma cells: role of E1a-induced differentiation. Some undifferentiated F9 embryonal carcinoma cells allow adenovirus genes to be expressed independently of the E1a oncogene normally required for their activation; this has been attributed to a cellular equivalent of E1a in F9 cells. However, transcription of all early genes was low in undifferentiated OTF963 embryonic carcinoma cells during the first 48 hr after infection with adenovirus type 5 (Ad5). Transcription then increased to about the level seen 16 hr after infection of cells induced to differentiate by retinoic acid (RA) (referred to as RA-dF9 cells), but this increase did not occur in cells infected by the E1a deletion mutant dl312. Addition of E1a in trans, or of RA, had no immediate effect on viral transcription in OTF963 cells, but viral transcription increased about 48 hr after these additions. Ad5 induced transcription of several differentiation-specific genes in OTF963 cells with about the same kinetics as their induction by RA. These genes were superinduced in RA-dF9 cells by cAMP or infection by adenovirus. We suggest the small amount of E1a produced early in infection of OTF963 cells activates cellular genes, some of which are differentiation specific and required for efficient transcription of viral genes, so that E1a both induces and is induced by differentiation. The simple hypothesis of a cellular equivalent to E1a does not adequately explain the complex interactions between viral and cellular genes in OTF963 embryonic carcinoma cells. 
2	Multifocal colitis associated with an epidemic of chronic diarrhea. An outbreak of a chronic diarrheal syndrome was detected between May and August 1987 in rural Henderson County, Illinois. Seventy-two individuals were affected. Epidemiological studies performed by the Center for Disease Control implicated the water of a local restaurant as the source of the outbreak. Five patients underwent a comprehensive evaluation. Their mean age was 51 years, and they had a mean of 12 watery stools daily (range, 6-40). Detailed microbiological evaluations failed to identify a pathological organism. Stool studies showed a mean stool weight of 392 g/24 h with a normal fat content. Results of all biochemical studies of serum were normal. Chemical analysis of stool water suggested a secretory diarrhea. Colonoscopy revealed patchy erythema, and light microscopic examination of colonic biopsy specimens revealed multifocal areas of acute inflammation in the superficial mucosa in 4 of 5 patients. Electron microscopy of the affected areas revealed no viral particles. After 2 years, all of our patients continued to experience chronic diarrhea. One patient agreed to a follow-up colonoscopy; histological abnormalities of the colonic mucosa persisted after 2 years. We speculate that an infectious process arising from a contaminated water system induced a chronic, secretory diarrhea characterized by multifocal colitis. This histological abnormality may serve as a marker of an infectious, chronic diarrhea. 
4	The role of lasers in hemorrhoidectomy. Eighty-eight patients who received treatment for hemorrhoids were randomized into two groups. Group A received the Nd-YAG laser phototherapy for internal hemorrhoid combined with the CO2 laser for external hemorrhoid. Group B was treated with closed Ferguson hemorrhoidectomy. The need of narcotic injections for pain relief was 11 percent in group A vs. 56 percent in group B (P less than 0.001). The incidence of postoperative urinary retention was 7 percent in group A, vs. 39 percent in group B (P less than 0.05). No enema was required postoperatively in group A, vs. 9 percent in group B; 84 percent of the patients in group A were discharged on the second postoperative day, vs. 83 percent of the patients in group B discharged on the fifth postoperative day. The cost was 20 percent less in the former group. The overall complications in both groups were insignificant in difference, except prolonged wound healing in group A was noted. One year follow-up showed satisfactory results. Laser treatment is considered one of the alternatives to conventional treatment, but the surgeon needs to be aware of laser hazards. 
4	Dietary calcium, vascular reactivity, and genetic hypertension in the Lyon rat strain. In order to examine the relationship existing between dietary calcium and the development of hypertension, we developed a long-term study in the Lyon hypertensive rat strain (LH) and two control strains, the Lyon normotensive (LN) and low blood pressure rats (LL) given enriched (HCa, 2.5%), deprived (LCa, 0.03%) and normal (NCa, 0.6%) calcium diets. Evolution of body weight, systolic blood pressure (BP), plasma calcium and magnesium was monitored from 4 to 23 weeks of age. Total cardiovascular reactivity and contractile response of isolated aorta to norepinephrine were measured at 23 weeks of age. LH rats on HCa diet failed to develop hypertension (BP less than 150 mm Hg) whereas LH rats on LCa diet exhibited higher blood pressure levels than their controls fed the NCa diet. Moreover, in LN rats HCa diet slightly decreased BP whereas LCa had no effect. In the LL rats, on the contrary, only LCa diet slightly increased BP. In vivo responsiveness to NE was significantly higher in LH compared to LL and LN rats fed a NCa diet. HCa and LCa diets both induced a significant decrease in this response in LH rats. HCa diet increased the response in LN rats but decreased it in LL. In contrast, at the same age, the in vitro contractile response of isolated aorta to NE was significantly decreased in LH compared to LN and LL rats receiving NCa diet. Moreover in LH and LN rats on HCa diet the contractile response was markedly increased but no significant difference was observed with LCa diet. 
2	Adenovirus colitis in the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome. Adenovirus was identified in colonic tissue by transmission electron microscopy or culture in 5 of 67 (7.4%) homosexual men seropositive for human immunodeficiency virus (51 with the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome) with diarrhea. Colonoscopy showed the mucosa to be normal in 3 cases and mildly inflamed in 2. Light microscopy showed foci of mucosal necrosis that contained chronic inflammatory cells and degenerating and necrotic epithelial cells with amphophilic nuclear inclusions. By transmission electron microscopy, hexagonal viral particles characteristic of adenovirus were identified within the inclusions. Only 1 patient was concomitantly infected by a second potential enteric pathogen. It was concluded that adenovirus, an uncommon enteric pathogen in immunocompetent adults, causes intestinal pathology and may be associated with diarrheal illness in persons with the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome. 
1	Prognosticators of second-look laparotomy findings in patients with epithelial ovarian cancer. Prognosticators of outcome at second-look laparotomy (SLL) were evaluated in 49 patients with epithelial ovarian carcinoma undergoing SLL. Residual tumor volume was found to be the most significant prognosticator of outcome, with initial tumor stage being of secondary importance. Grade of tumor played no role in outcome at SLL. The results of the study led us to the conclusion that the second-look procedure may be safely omitted in stage I patients. The importance of optimal cytoreduction during primary surgery was stressed. 
1	Renal cell metastases versus liver hemangioma. We present the case of a man with presumed metastatic renal cell carcinoma based on radiologic examination and weight loss, who refused treatment of any kind for one year. A surgical exploration to control hematuria revealed a Stage I tumor. 
1	Localization and peptide content of endocrine pancreatic tumors. Endocrine pancreatic tumors contain and frequently secret neurohormonal peptides. This phenomenon can be used as a diagnostic and classifying tool. This study analyzes 31 patients operated on because of an endocrine pancreatic tumor, including the diagnostic procedures and the localization methods. In 15 insulinoma cases only 6 patients had a positive arteriography, while all 11 selective pancreatic vein samplings were positive. The immunoreactivity showed that, besides insulin, most tumors also contained other peptides. Of four gastrinoma cases the arteriography was positive in three, but the selective vein sampling localized the tumor in all. The tumor's content of peptides showed mixed patterns. In the four glucagonomas, the arteriography was positive in all and the venous sampling performed in three of the cases also was positive. In five pancreatic polypeptide-containing tumors (PP-omas) the arteriography was positive in four and sampling performed in two was positive in both. In the PP-omas the peptide pattern showed that these tumors frequently contain several peptides. We used selective pancreatic vein sampling in 21 cases with positive result in all. In the cases in which arteriography was negative, the sampling results helped the surgeon to find the tumor. The peptide pattern in the tumors varied greatly and most tumors were multihormonal. 
5	Rectovulvar fistula in a child secondary to an unusual foreign body. Foreign bodies in the female genital tract are well recognized as a cause of pain, discharge, secretions, and infection. In the small child, the presence of a vaginal discharge is usually associated with either a common object which has been inserted or sexual abuse complicated by a sexually transmitted disease. A 3-year-old child presented with a recurrent labial secretion and drainage due to an unusual foreign body. It was only during a second operation that the possibility of a foreign body was entertained, and diagnostic testing was begun. A third operation permitted removal of the foreign body, a large bone probably of animal origin. The fistula tract was closed after a colostomy was performed. This represents the first reported case of a rectovulvar fistula not of a congenital nature. 
4	Accelerated arteriosclerosis in heart transplant recipients is associated with a T-lymphocyte-mediated endothelialitis. Accelerated arteriosclerosis has emerged as a major life-threatening complication in long-term survivors of heart transplantation. It has been proposed that accelerated arteriosclerosis is an immune-mediated complication of rejection. We observed a striking endothelialitis in the coronary arteries of two explanted hearts obtained from patients with severe transplant-related accelerated arteriosclerosis. This finding prompted us to review the pathologic changes in the coronary arteries of 23 autopsied patients who had received heart transplants. The infiltrate in these vessels was characterized using immunohistochemical stains for lymphocytes (CD45), macrophages (MAC-387), T lymphocytes (CD45RO), B lymphocytes (L-26), and smooth muscle cells (actin). In addition, a full panel of monoclonal antibodies was used on the fresh-frozen tissue available from one of the two explanted hearts. Ten of the eleven recipients with accelerated arteriosclerosis had a moderate to marked lymphocytic endothelialitis compared to 3 of 14 without transplant-related arteriosclerosis (P less than 0.005). Immunohistochemical staining of the paraffin-embedded material demonstrated that most of the lymphocytes in the subendothelial space of these vessels were T lymphocytes and that this infiltrate was associated with an accumulation of macrophages and a proliferation of smooth muscle cells in the intima. In the explanted heart from which fresh-frozen tissue was available for more detailed cell typing, the T cells marked predominantly as cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CD8+, CD2+). These results suggest that accelerated arteriosclerosis may be mediated, in part, by a cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-directed endothelialitis. 
1	A three-dimensional system for long-term culture of human colorectal adenomas. Studies of the adenoma-carcinoma sequence in the colon and rectum have been limited by the paucity of experimental models of adenoma growth and progression. Progress recently was reported in the development of monolayer culture systems. The principal objective of this study was to develop a primary culture system for colorectal adenomas that would simulate three-dimensional in vivo growth. We used a calcium alginate encapsulation technique that was previously described for established tumor cell lines. Briefly, fresh resected specimens were washed, minced into small multicellular particles called microadenomas, and encapsulated in 1% calcium alginate pellets. The pellets were maintained in minimum essential medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum at 37 degrees C in humidified atmosphere of 95% air, 5% CO2. Ten of eleven adenomas, including six tubular, three tubulovillous, and one villous have been successfully cultured for 34 to 162 days. Cell viability was confirmed histologically by light and electron microscopy. The cells were characterized as epithelial by morphologic features and ultrastructural studies, which showed a high degree of cellular differentiation, including villous brush borders and many desmosomes. Both tubular and villuslike structures have been observed in vitro, correlating in some cases with the histology of the parent adenoma. Measurements of proliferative activity by [3H]thymidine autoradiography or immunohistochemical staining with the monoclonal antibody Ki-67 demonstrated growth fractions of 9% to 25%. A simple, highly efficient primary culture system was developed for the long-term maintenance of adenomas that promotes three-dimensional growth patterns and growth rates analogous to those seen in vivo. This model provides an opportunity to develop an experimental system for longitudinal studies of pathologic and molecular parameters in adenoma progression to carcinoma. 
5	Patients at risk for cardiac death late after aortic valve replacement. A total of 100 patients aged 24 to 78 years were screened prospectively a mean of 71 months after aortic valve replacement for the presence of left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) on the ECG (Estes scores greater than or equal to 5.0) and for repetitive ventricular premature beats VPBs greater than or equal to 2 couplets/24 hr) during 24-hour Holter monitoring. During the subsequent 41-month follow-up (range 10 to 50 months), the yearly cardiac mortality rate was 1.3% in patients with LVH, 2.9% in patients with VPBs, and 8.0% in patients with LVH plus VPBs but only 0.6% when none of these factors was present (p less than 0.05 chi 2 test). The patient groups did not differ with regard to age, time elapsed since operation, underlying valve lesion, and coronary artery disease. Both LVH and VPBs occurred more frequently in patients with left ventricular dysfunction. We conclude that after aortic valve replacement cardiac mortality is markedly increased in patients with LVH and repetitive VPBs, since they are noninvasive markers of left ventricular dysfunction. 
5	Extrageniculate vision in hemianopic humans: saccade inhibition by signals in the blind field. The functional competence of extrageniculate visual pathways in hemianopic humans was demonstrated by showing that distractor signals in the blind half of the visual field could inhibit saccades toward targets in the intact visual field. This inhibitory effect of unseen distractors in patients occurred only when distractors were presented in the temporal half of the visual field, was specific to oculomotor responses, and did not occur in normal subjects. These results show that a peripheral visual signal activates retinotectal pathways to prime the oculomotor system and that these pathways can mediate orienting behavior in hemianopic humans. 
5	Disseminated Pneumocystis carinii infection with hepatic involvement in a patient with the acquired immune deficiency syndrome. Extrapulmonary infection with Pneumocystis carinii (P. carinii) in AIDS patients is uncommon, and is often described only at postmortem examination. Although most antemortem cases involve spread to the bone marrow or spleen, P. carinii involvement of other organs has only recently been described. Despite the frequency of liver enzyme abnormalities in AIDS patients with a history of P. carinii pneumonia, P. carinii has been observed only rarely in the liver. We present a well-documented case of P. carinii involving the liver in an AIDS patient with P. carinii pneumonia and progressive liver enzyme abnormalities. We suggest that P. carinii infection should be considered in the differential diagnosis of AIDS-related liver disease. 
5	Comparison of i.m. ketorolac trometamol and morphine sulphate for pain relief after cholecystectomy. I.m. ketorolac trometamol 30 mg was compared with morphine sulphate 10 mg after cholecystectomy in a double-blind, multiple dose, randomized study of 100 patients. Assessments of pain were made immediately after operation (day 1), and the next morning (day 2). Pain intensity (verbal response score and visual analogue scale) was recorded before injection and then over a 6-h period. Pain relief was assessed also. The effect of ketorolac on operative blood loss and platelet function was examined. Time to commencing oral intake and the duration of administration of i.v. fluids were recorded. Adverse events were noted. Ketorolac produced significantly less analgesia than morphine on day 1, but on day 2 the two drugs produced a similar effect. Blood loss was not increased by ketorolac, although platelet function was impaired. Repeated i.m. administration of ketorolac did not produce any serious adverse effects. 
1	Clinicopathologic and flow cytometric DNA study of medullary thyroid carcinoma. Sixty-one patients with medullary thyroid carcinoma were investigated to establish relationships between the neoplasm's DNA content, other clinicopathologic factors, and patient survival (at least 5 years' follow-up). There were 26 (42.6%) familial and 35 (57.4%) sporadic carcinomas. Forty-two neoplasms (68.8%) were diploid and 19 (31.2%) were aneuploid by flow cytometric assessment. In univariate analysis, age, hereditary background, DNA content, calcitonin immunoreactivity, and type of surgery were strong predictors of clinical outcomes. In multivariate regression analysis, none of these factors was an independent prognosticator. Patients' gender, clinical stage, histologic subtype, and amyloid content of the tumor did not influence survival. 
5	Severe hemorrhagic radiation proctitis advancing to gradual cessation with hyperbaric oxygen. We report a case of a male patient suffering from a severe hemorrhagic radiation proctitis which gradually ceased with hyperbaric oxygen. We discuss the mechanisms of chronic radiation injury and the effect of the hyperbaric oxygen. This therapy is proposed as an alternative to surgical intervention for this abnormality. 
4	Recognition and embolic potential of intraaortic atherosclerotic debris. Atherosclerotic disease of the thoracic aorta is common in the elderly and patients with clinical coronary artery disease. Although embolization can occur from atherosclerotic debris within the thoracic aorta, it is not commonly considered in the differential diagnosis of the source of a systemic embolism. In the current study, the prevalence, clinical significance and embolic potential of intraaortic atherosclerotic debris as detected by transesophageal echocardiography was determined. Intraaortic atherosclerotic debris was identified in 38 (7%) of 556 patients undergoing transesophageal echocardiography. An embolic event occurred among 11 (31%) of the 36 study patients with intraaortic atherosclerotic debris. The incidence of an embolic event was higher when the debris was pedunculated and highly mobile (8 [73%] of 11 patients) than when it was layered and immobile (3 [12%] of 25 patients) (p less than 0.002). Among 15 patients undergoing an invasive procedure of the aorta, the incidence of embolism was 27%. In conclusion, in a patient with an embolic event, the thoracic aorta should be considered as a potential source. Transesophageal echocardiography can reliably detect intraaortic atherosclerotic debris, and when it is identified, an invasive aortic procedure should be avoided if possible. 
1	Mixed glioblastoma multiforme and sarcoma. A clinicopathologic study of 26 radiation therapy oncology group cases. Twenty-six cases are reported of gliosarcoma (GS) retrieved from a series of 1479 glioblastomas (GBM) that were part of five consecutive, randomized Phase II or III malignant glioma protocols initiated by the Radiation Therapy Oncology Group between 1974 and 1983. The clinicopathologic features of these 26 cases, including actuarial survival times, were compared with the remaining 1453 GBM. The minimal qualitative and quantitative histologic criteria required to diagnose GS are presented. In most cases the sarcomatous component was a malignant fibrous histiocytoma; a minority were fibrosarcoma. No significant differences between GS and GBM were found with regard to age, sex, pretreatment Karnofsky performance status, tumor location, size, median survival (8.3 and 9.6 months, respectively), and actuarial survival. None of the treatment regimens, which included various combinations of radiation therapy and chemotherapy, improved the survival of GS over GBM. Selective involvement of the temporal lobe by GS was not found, and the frequency of GS was determined to be only 1.8% of all GBM. 
5	Major histocompatibility complex genes and susceptibility to systemic lupus erythematosus. Susceptibility to systemic lupus erythematosus is associated with major histocompatibility complex (MHC)--encoded genes. We have used nucleotide sequence analysis to better define the disease-associated MHC alleles. HLA-DR2, DQw1, and especially the rare allele DQ beta 1. AZH confer high relative risk (RR = 14) for lupus nephritis in a Caucasian population of patients. Pilot studies using historical controls suggest that these genes also confer a high risk in non-Caucasian ethnic groups (RR = 24-78). We have found that DR4 is significantly decreased in patients with lupus nephritis. Fifty percent of the patients with lupus nephritis had either the DQ beta 1.1, the DQ beta 1.AZH, or the DQ beta 1.9 alleles. These alleles share amino acid residues that have been predicted to be the contact points for antigen and the T cell receptor. These HLA alleles appear to have a direct role in the predisposition to lupus nephritis, whereas DR4 may have a "protective" effect. 
5	Helium-oxygen mixture in the treatment of postextubation stridor in pediatric trauma patients. OBJECTIVE: To assess the effectiveness of a helium-oxygen mixture in reducing post-extubation stridor in children hospitalized for burns or trauma. DESIGN: Randomized, controlled crossover trial. SETTING: Harborview Medical Center's Burn and Trauma ICUs from March to September 1989. PATIENTS: Children less than 15 yr old who were electively extubated and had symptoms of postextubation stridor, but required less than or equal to 35% oxygen. INTERVENTION: Each treatment (helium-oxygen and oxygen-supplemented room air) was given in random order for 15 min after extubation. MEASUREMENTS: Respiratory distress was assessed by a physician blinded to treatment order using a standard stridor score and clinical judgment. RESULTS: There were 13 children with 15 extubations; seven (47%) of 15 patients required subsequent treatment with racemic epinephrine or reintubation. Stridor scores were lower with helium-oxygen than with oxygen-supplemented room air (2.8 vs. 3.7, p less than .005), and helium-oxygen was preferred in eight of nine trials in which one treatment was clearly favored by the physician. CONCLUSION: Because helium-oxygen therapy can reduce stridor scores and is clinically preferred by physicians caring for stridorous children, it may be a useful adjunctive therapy in pediatric trauma patients with postextubation stridor. 
5	Seizure outcome from anterior and complete corpus callosotomy. Eighty patients underwent anterior corpus callosotomy for treatment of generalized seizures. The patients' mean age was 18.3 years (range 4 to 53 years); the mean age at seizure onset was 5.27 years (range 0.1 to 27 years). The mean intelligence quotient (IQ) of 41 testable patients was 71.12 (range less than 30 to 114). The seizure outcome was as follows: 13% were seizure-free, 65% were significantly improved, and 22% were unchanged. Ten patients subsequently underwent a second operation to complete the callosal sectioning which resulted in additional seizure improvement in only five of them. Five complications resulted from 90 operations: two epidural hematomas, one delayed subdural hematoma, one bone-flap infection, and one postcallosotomy disconnection syndrome; two patients died. A younger age at onset of seizures, a higher IQ, and generalized tonic-clonic, atonic, complex-partial, and mixed seizure types were associated with improved seizure outcome. 
3	Long-term follow-up of cemented total hip arthroplasty in rheumatoid arthritis. Seventy-five primary cemented total hip arthroplasties (THAs) were performed in 53 patients with rheumatoid arthritis and juvenile rheumatoid arthritis. All patients were followed for an average of 7.4 years, unless their prosthetic hips failed before that time. Clinical evaluation was based on a 10-point maximum rating scale, and ratings for pain, walking, function, and activity improved from preoperative values to the most recent follow-up examination. Revision THA was performed for aseptic acetabular loosening in four hips, and femoral loosening in one hip. Sepsis occurred in another four hips. Complications of wound healing occurred in 14 hips. Roentgenographic evidence of loosening was seen in six acetabular components, in three femoral components, and in the femoral and acetabular component of one hip; none of these hips have as yet required revision THA. The Kaplan-Meier survivorship analysis revealed a 93% survival probability at seven years, which fell to 77% at 12 years in these patients. A trend was that younger, larger patients had increased failure and component loosening rates. Cemented primary THA has been a satisfactory operation in the rheumatoid patient. The relatively high rate of wound healing problems and sepsis may be due to the systemic immune nature of rheumatoid arthritis; however, 25% of these prosthetic hips either failed or are at risk for future failure. Thus, improved techniques are still necessary to increase the long-term success of THA in the rheumatoid patient. 
3	Pain in children. The assessment and management of children's pain is a topic that has received a great deal of attention since the late 1970s. Nurse researchers have played a dominant role in all areas of pediatric pain relief and likely will continue to do so. There are currently a number of pediatric pain assessment instruments developed that are used in selected practice settings, but their use should be extended to document the existence of pediatric pain and its relief. Pharmacologic interventions for pediatric pain relief have been hampered by incorrect beliefs about analgesic risks, prescribing and administrating habits, and a virtual explosion of information in the area of analgesics. Although nurses have traditionally used nonpharmacologic interventions for pain relief, these methods have not been well researched. Continued research efforts in this important area will result in improved diagnosis and management of pediatric pain. 
5	Tamm-Horsfall autoantibodies in interstitial cystitis. Interstitial cystitis presents a diagnostic and therapeutic challenge. Although many etiologies, including autoimmunity, have been proposed its pathogenesis remains obscure. Tamm-Horsfall protein has been identified in the superficial urothelium of patients with interstitial cystitis demonstrating abnormal urothelial permeability. Eight patients with a clinical diagnosis of interstitial cystitis underwent cystoscopy and bladder biopsy. Characteristic cystoscopic findings were present, and each patient had chronic inflammation and mast cells by histopathological analysis. Preoperative anti-Tamm-Horsfall protein serum antibody (IgG) titers were determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (range 500 to 8,000, mean 2,750). A control group of 8 patients with a negative urological history also had titers of 0 to 500 (p = 0.02). The humoral response to Tamm-Horsfall protein in these patients suggests a role for Tamm-Horsfall protein in interstitial cystitis. Measurement of serum Tamm-Horsfall protein antibody may prove to be useful as a noninvasive diagnostic test in patients with this disease. 
5	Unusual haemostasis for an unusual tumour. Catastrophic bleeding from a tactile neurofibroma affecting the thoracic vertebrae. Case report. The symptomatology of a typical acute descending thoracic aorta dissection was imitated by profuse haemorrhage caused by a benign tumour composed almost exclusively of Wagner-Meissner like tactile corpuscles and fatty tissue. The tumour caused extensive destruction of the bodies of the fifth and sixth thoracic vertebrae at the level of the vertebro-costal articulation. Emergency cross clamping of the descending aorta and haemostasis of the bleeding from osteal defects by tamponade with bone polymethyl methacrylate appeared the only way to control the life threatening haemorrhage. It seems that an intrathoracic tactile neurofibroma with a similar case history has not been reported till now. 
5	Use of magnetic resonance imaging in the diagnosis of cortical blindness in pregnancy. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) may be helpful in the assessment of eclampsia and preeclampsia with central nervous system symptomatology such as cortical blindness. We describe a rare case of complete binocular blindness postpartum with no other neurologic deficits, in which MRI abnormalities were undetected on computed tomography. The better soft-tissue discrimination of MRI may visualize important but subtle lesions which ultimately may help to explain the underlying pathophysiologic mechanism in such cases. 
5	Plasma tumour necrosis factor alpha in cystic fibrosis. Plasma tumour necrosis factor alpha (alpha) concentration is increased in acute Gram negative sepsis, but the effect of chronic infection on plasma concentrations is unknown. A study was carried out in patients with cystic fibrosis to determine the effect of chronic lung infection with Pseudomonas aeruginosa on the plasma concentration of tumour necrosis factor and two other indicators of the inflammatory response, circulating C reactive protein and neutrophil elastase-alpha 1 antiproteinase complex (elastase complex). The concentration of immunoreactive tumour necrosis factor in plasma was greater than the upper 95% confidence interval for healthy subjects (2.6 U/ml) on 129 out of 189 occasions in 14 patients observed for about a year. The increase in tumour necrosis factor was associated with increased circulating C reactive protein and elastase complex. Twelve patients with an exacerbation of respiratory symptoms were studied before and after two weeks' treatment with anti-pseudomonal antibiotics. All three indicators of the inflammatory response fell after treatment, though median tumour necrosis factor (4.8 U/ml) and elastase complex (0.41 microgram/ml) concentrations remained above the upper limits for healthy subjects. During a period of clinical stability plasma tumour necrosis factor was increased in 10 of the 12 patients, elastase complex was increased in 10 of the 12, and C reactive protein was increased in seven. Increased plasma immunoreactive tumour necrosis factor was a feature of the near continuous inflammatory response to chronic P aeruginosa infection in cystic fibrosis and may be a factor contributing to the progressive lung destruction seen in this disease. 
3	Heritability of symptoms in an experimental model of neuropathic pain. Male and female rats underwent transection and ligation of the sciatic and saphenous nerves, and the development of autonomy was monitored. The deafferented animals were then interbred, always selecting males and females that expressed relatively high and, alternatively, relatively low levels of autotomy. Offspring were similarly operated and interbred. By the sixth generation of selective breeding, lines were achieved in which autotomy was consistently high (HA) or consistently low (LA). There was no indication of sex linkage. Thermal and mechanical nocifensive responsiveness co-selected with propensity to express autotomy following nerve injury: response thresholds were lower in HA than in LA rats. F1 hybrids formed by crossing homozygous HA and LA animals showed low levels of autotomy, similar to LA stock. This indicates recessive inheritance of the autotomy trait. Backcrossing F1 hybrids onto the LA line yielded a low autotomy phenotype in almost all cases; backcrossing F1 hybrids onto HA stock yielded about 50% high autotomy and 50% low autotomy. These ratios are consistent with simple mendelian inheritance of a single gene. Taken together, the data suggest that autotomy is inherited as a single-gene autosomal recessive trait. 
5	The validity of canine platelet aggregometry in predicting vascular graft patency. Several laboratories have found canine platelet aggregometry predictive of thrombotic potential in vascular grafts. Adenosine diphosphate (ADP) is a frequently used agonist, often at unspecified or differing concentrations. This study was designed to evaluate the predictive value of ADP-induced platelet aggregometry and the validity of the methodology. Platelet aggregometry in response to 2 x 10(-5) M ADP was assayed in 70 dogs. Twenty-six percent were aggregators, 51% were non-aggregators, and 20% were indeterminant. All dogs were then treated with aspirin and dipyridamole. Vascular prostheses were implanted bilaterally (aorto-iliac) and anti-platelet therapy continued for two weeks. Dose-response to ADP was studied at three concentrations in 20 dogs. At 2 x 10(-5) 1/20 aggregated, at 4 x 10(-5) 3/19 aggregated and at 2 x 10(-4) 15/20 aggregated. Time between samples and study was evaluated in 11 dogs, with 2/11 changing from non-aggregator to aggregator at two or three hours. Daily reproducibility was studied in 70 dogs, 14 of which changed aggregation status between days. Patency was 58/68 (85%) for non-aggregators, 23/34 (68%) for aggregators (p = 0.038). Platelet aggregometry has significant predictive value for graft patency but methodology must be specified and standardized. 
1	Clinical characteristics and treatment outcome of childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia with the t(4;11)(q21;q23): a collaborative study of 40 cases. The t(4;11)(q21;q23) chromosomal abnormality was identified in 40 (2%) of 1,986 children with newly diagnosed acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). This translocation was associated with female sex (63%), age less than 1 year (60%), hyperleukocytosis (median leukocyte count, 156.5 x 10(9)/L), CD10-/CD19+ B-precursor cell immunophenotype, and myeloid-associated antigen (CD15) expression (63%). Nearly all cases had at least some CD24- blast cells. The CD10-/CD15%/CD19+/CD24/+ phenotype was found in 20 of the 32 t(4;11) cases tested. None of the 40 cases had the cytogenetic finding of hyperdiploidy greater than 50, which is a favorable prognostic feature. For clinical comparison, the t(4;11) cases were divided into three groups according to age at diagnosis: less than 1 year (n = 24), 1 to 9 years (n = 8), and greater than or equal to 10 years (n = 8). Compared with older patients, infants were more likely to have initial central nervous system leukemia (P = .05) and less likely to have pre-B-cell ALL (P = .05). Complete continuous remission has been maintained in only 7 of 24 infants and 2 of 8 patients aged greater than or equal to 10 years, in contrast to 7 of 8 children in the intermediate age group (P = .048). These findings suggest that the t(4;11) is an adverse prognostic feature in these two age groups. 
1	Effects of radiation therapy on skeletal growth in childhood. Ionizing radiation was used to treat childhood cancer long before the advent of chemotherapy, and it took little time for physicians to appreciate the deleterious effects it had on skeletal growth. The cause of this complication results predominantly from alteration of chondroblastic activity. This may stem directly from irradiation at the epiphyseal plate or indirectly from irradiation of glands that secrete growth-mediating hormones. The complication can go far beyond the obvious physical afflictions and extend into the psychologic domain, rendering deeper, more permanent scars. Presently, many of these effects are predictable, reducible, and treatable without compromising the cure that so often depends on the use of irradiation. Because of the complexities of childhood cancer therapy, strategies aimed at diminishing these effects are challenging. It is imperative that these effects be understood so that they can be reduced in current patients and prevented in future patients. 
5	Paralysis of saccades and pursuit: clinicopathologic study. We report a 73-year-old patient with an eye movement disorder characterized by paralysis of saccades and pursuit. At autopsy, there were small cortical lesions in the middle frontal gyrus immediately anterior to the precentral gyrus and in the inferior parietal lobule on both sides. 
2	Loss of duodenal folds allows diagnosis of unsuspected coeliac disease. We report three patients with coeliac disease who presented without the classic features of malabsorption and who underwent biopsy and were diagnosed only because of the endoscopic finding of the disappearance of Kerckring's folds in the descending duodenum. This sign constitutes a new and valid aid for the identification of patients with otherwise unsuspected coeliac disease. 
5	Outcome of renal transplantation after urinary diversion and enterocystoplasty: a retrospective, controlled study. A total of 17 patients with intestinal urinary diversion of enterocystoplasty underwent renal transplantation between 1970 and 1988. Patient age ranged from 4 to 35 years (mean age 20 years). The patients were divided into 2 groups. In group 1 (10 patients, 2 of whom required retransplantation) the ureter of the transplanted kidney was implanted into an ileal (7) or colonic (1) conduit or enterocystoplasty (2). In group 2 (7 patients, 1 of whom required a second transplant) the diversion was taken down and the transplanted ureter was implanted into the defunctionalized bladder. There were 14 living related and 6 cadaveric kidneys transplanted. Graft survival rates were 58 and 87% in groups 1 and 2, respectively, with an over-all rate of 70% (14 of 20 kidneys). There was no statistical difference in the graft survival rate between the 2 groups. The complications in group 1 included ureteroileal anastomotic leak (3 patients), ureteroileal stenosis (1), calculus formation (1), urosepsis (1), hyperchloremic metabolic acidosis (1), and wound infection and dehiscence (1). There were no complications in group 2. Renal transplantation into a pre-existing urinary intestinal conduit or augmented bladder does not statistically adversely affect patient or graft survival. However, the complication rate is much higher when the ureter is implanted into an intestinal segment. Therefore, it is preferable whenever possible to implant the ureter into the native bladder. 
5	Pearson syndrome and mitochondrial encephalomyopathy in a patient with a deletion of mtDNA. A patient is described who has features of Pearson syndrome and who presented in the neonatal period with a hypoplastic anemia. He later developed hepatic, renal, and exocrine pancreatic dysfunction. At the age of 5 years he developed visual impairment, tremor, ataxia, proximal muscle weakness, external ophthalmoplegia, and a pigmentary retinopathy (Kearns-Sayre syndrome). Muscle biopsy confirmed the diagnosis of mitochondrial myopathy. Analysis of mtDNA from leukocytes and muscle showed mtDNA heteroplasmy in both tissues, with one population of mtDNA deleted by 4.9 kb. The deleted region was bridged by a 13-nucleotide sequence occurring as a direct repeat in normal mtDNA. Both Pearson syndrome and Kearns-Sayre syndrome have been noted to be associated with deletions of mtDNA; they have not previously been described in the same patient. These observations indicate that the two disorders have the same molecular basis; the different phenotypes are probably determined by the initial proportion of deleted mtDNAs and modified by selection against them in different tissues. 
1	Continent ileocolonic urinary reservoirs for filling and lining the post-exenteration pelvis. Pelvic exenteration has a high complication rate due, in large part, to the extensive raw surfaces and dead space it creates. Numerous techniques have been used to control this space and line these surfaces, but none, to date, has proven to be a reliable solution. We investigated the use of continent ileocolonic urinary reservoirs as a new "flap" to fill and line the pelvis in 17 patients, and found that our historical complication rate of 44% for pelvic exenteration was reduced to 18%. These reservoirs appear to be an improved method of managing the post-exenteration pelvis. 
5	Emergency intraosseous infusion in severely burned children. Severely burned patients require rapid administration of large volumes of isotonic fluids. Obtaining adequate intravenous (IV) access in children with greater than 70% total body surface area burns may be difficult, time-consuming, and sometimes impossible. This report describes the use of intraosseous infusion technique as a life-saving means of establishing IV access in two severely burned children. 
2	Evaluation of women with possible appendicitis using technetium-99m leukocyte scan. The authors evaluated the use of technetium-99m albumin colloid white blood cell (TAC-WBC) scan in women with possible appendicitis. One hundred and nine women underwent 110 TAC-WBC scans. One woman had a second scan on a separate admission and was considered two individual patients in the analysis. Twenty-six women had appendicitis, 10 of whom had a perforated appendix at surgery. The TAC-WBC scan was indeterminate (abnormal but nondiagnostic for appendicitis) in 52 women (47%), nine of whom had appendicitis. Fifty-eight scans were read as positive or negative for appendiceal pathology. There were 16 true positives, 5 false positives, 36 true negatives, and 1 false negative. The predictive value of a positive scan was 76%, and the predictive value of a negative scan was 97%. The TAC-WBC scan was positive in 62% of patients with appendicitis and negative in 43% of the patients without appendicitis resulting in an overall accuracy of 47% in the 109 women. The main value of TAC-WBC scan in women with possible appendicitis is its high negative predictive value and the main problem with the TAC-WBC scan is its high indeterminate rate. 
1	Small cell lung cancer: staging with MR imaging. Small cell lung cancer is an aggressive neoplasm; metastases are detected in two-thirds of patients at diagnosis with use of conventional staging, which includes bilateral bone marrow biopsy, bone scintigraphy, and computed tomography (CT) of the head and abdomen. In 25 patients, small cell lung cancer was staged prospectively with both conventional staging and a magnetic resonance (MR) imaging protocol that included 1.5-T MR imaging of the pelvis, abdomen, spine, and brain. According to conventional staging, 14 patients had extensive disease and 11 patients had limited disease; according to staging with MR, 19 patients had extensive disease and six had limited disease. All metastatic disease sites seen with conventional staging were identified on MR images. MR images showed additional metastatic involvement in bone (four patients) and liver (three patients) not detected at conventional staging. A low-attenuation hepatic lesion on a CT scan was identified as a hemangioma on MR images. These preliminary data suggest that small cell lung cancer may be accurately staged with use of a single MR imaging study. 
1	The use of cytochemical procedures in the diagnosis and management of acute and chronic myeloid leukemia. The use of Wright-Giemsa-stained smears alone for the classification of acute leukemias often proves unsatisfactory. Some cases of M1, M5a, M7, and L2 are morphologically similar. In such cases, cytochemical stains can provide an inexpensive and available diagnostic tool. M1 is positive for SBB and MPO. M5a is usually NSE positive, whereas SBB and MPO are negative. M7 usually is ANA esterase, PAS, and AP reactive, and do not stain with SBB, MPO, and ANB esterases. The megakaryocytic lineage usually is confirmed by ultrastructural cytochemistry for PPO or immunocytochemistry for platelet glycoproteins and von Willebrand factor. PAS block positivity and AP dotlike reactivity are suggestive of lymphoid lineage. NSE stains are useful in differentiating M2 from M4. Morphologic and cytochemical techniques also can suggest the presence of certain chromosomal abnormalities such as t(8;21) and inv(16), which may have an influence on prognosis. Because not all cases of acute leukemia are easily subtyped by morphology and cytochemistry, immunophenotyping, karyotyping, and molecular analysis of DNA and RNA of leukemia cells also may be required to define cell lineage. 
5	The Caspar microsurgical discectomy and comparison with a conventional standard lumbar disc procedure. The outcome in 119 patients who were operated on with a conventional standard lumbar discectomy procedure was retrospectively compared with that in 299 patients who were operated on with a microsurgical discectomy technique developed in Homburg/Saar, Federal Republic of Germany by the senior author (W.C.). All patients in this consecutive series had "virgin" lumbar radiculopathy evaluated and operated upon by two experienced surgeons at one institution. Determination of the final outcome was made objectively by an impartial third party using identical criteria for both groups, and with a patient self-evaluation form. The study looked at various pertinent aspects of the treatment course and at final outcome. The results in the microsurgical group were significantly favorable: fewer levels were explored: there was less operative blood loss and a decreased incidence of deep venous thrombosis, urinary tract infections, pulmonary emboli, and bladder catheterization; the time to full ambulation, discharge, and return to work was faster: and there was a decrease in change of occupation and a greater percentage of satisfactory final outcomes, as measured both objectively and subjectively. A description of the microsurgical technique used in this study, which differs significantly from existing microdisectomy techniques, is presented. The authors conclude that the microsurgical disectomy technique presented in this study is a safe and effective approach to the treatment of lumbar radiculopathy. 
4	Fibrosing mediastinitis with coronary artery involvement. This case report describes a patient with chronic fibrosing mediastinitis involving the entire intrapericardial aorta, innominate artery, and the base of the heart with involvement of the proximal segments of the coronary arteries. This finding was unsuspected before emergency coronary artery bypass grafting. Coronary stenosis due to fibrosing mediastinitis is a rare complication of fibrosing mediastinitis. Owing to the extensive fibrosis, the normal bypass, cardiac preservation, and revascularization techniques required alteration and are discussed. 
5	Managing geriatric arrhythmias, II: Drug selection and use [published erratum appears in Geriatrics 1991 Jun;46(6):100] Age-related impairments in antiarrhythmic drug distribution, metabolism, and excretion may result in accumulation of these potent drugs, increasing the risk of adverse drug reactions and drug interactions in the elderly. These risks are minimized by using modest initial dosage with slow dosage titration. Therapeutic drug monitoring is a method which employs antiarrhythmic concentration data and a determination of drug clearance in order to develop an optimal dosing regimen. The pharmacology, indications for use, and adverse effects of currently available antiarrhythmics are reviewed. Dosing guidelines for the geriatric population are provided. 
4	(A)typical symptoms during single needle dialysis. In 5 elderly patients, an abnormally high occurrence of some symptoms was noted during dialysis. All patients were dialyzed with biocompatible membranes, bicarbonate dialysate, and a blood flow of 250 to 300 ml/min by a single needle system, on a fistula 14 Gauge catheter-needle. These symptoms were: 1) "angina," resistant to O2 and nitrates, with biochemical stigmata of infarction, but without electrocardiogram (ECG) localization; 2) intractable persistent hypotension, not hypovolemic, lasting 1 or 2 days; 3) esophagal spasms, with inability to swallow solid food. Because we knew that these symptoms were compatible with hemolysis (biochemically proven by the increase in serum LDH during dialysis and by a fall in haptoglobin) due to red cell fragmentation (RCF), we switched these patients from fistula dialysis (A) to central catheter dialysis (B), with the same apperture, blood flow, etc. The total number of sessions of A versus B were 512 and 891; the mean LDH ratios (serum LDH postdialysis divided by predialysis) were 1.8 and 1.0 (= no RCF); angina events were 132 (26%) for A, and 25 (3%) for B; persistent hypotension was seen 37 (7%) times in A and 5 (0.6%) times in B; esophagal spasms were noted 65 (13%) times for A, and 0 times for B. This clinical improvement was so overwhelming that 3 patients refused to be dialyzed again using their well functioning fistulae. This study also proved the need for a better designed and manufactured peripheral dialysis catheter-needle. 
4	Correlation of isomeric fatty acids in human adipose tissue with clinical risk factors for cardiovascular disease. The relationships between the adipose tissue concentrations of 19 geometric and positional fatty acid isomers and 10 cardiovascular disease risk factors were determined in 76 free-living adult males. The percentages for trans isomers (total mean +/- SD 4.14 +/- 0.97%) and cis isomers (total mean +/- SD 2.91 +/- 0.34%) in adipose tissue generally agreed with dietary estimates based on the consumption of hydrogenated oils. A major exception was the percentage of 11c-18:1, which was twofold higher in adipose tissue. The total level of fatty acid isomers in adipose tissue or a factor (derived by factor analysis) that was representative of isomers of dietary origin was not significantly correlated with the cardiovascular risk factors. Only three trans isomers (11t-18:1, 12t-18:1, and 5t-14:1) and three cis isomers (11c-18:1, 13c-18:1, and 7c-16:1) were weakly correlated either positively or negatively with age, body mass index, plasma and lipoprotein cholesterol, and/or blood pressure (P less than 0.05, r greater than 0.231). 
5	Recurrent herpetic keratitis: failure to detect herpes simplex virus infection using the Syva MicroTrak HSV1/HSV2 direct specimen identification/typing test. A 35-year-old man had developed recurrent herpetic keratitis characterized by dendritic keratitis at intervals of a year. We were able to culture cytopathic agents repeatedly from his lesions by inoculating Vero cells. The cultures yielded definitive evidence of a virus that caused a cytopathic effect within 3 days. However, these virus strains could not be identified as herpes simplex virus (HSV) in immunofluorescence assays using the Syva MicroTrak HSV1/HSV2 direct specimen identification/typing test. Rather they were identified as strains of HSV type 1 (HSV-1) on the basis of plaque morphology, neutralization tests, electron-microscopic examination and DNA restriction endonuclease analysis. Our results allow us to assume the existence of HSV-1 strains isolated clinically that are negative to analysis using the Syva Micro-Trak HSV1/HSV2 direct specimen identification/typing test. 
3	Buffered versus plain lidocaine as a local anesthetic for simple laceration repair. STUDY OBJECTIVE: Buffered lidocaine was compared with plain lidocaine as a local anesthetic for simple lacerations. DESIGN: Randomized, double-blind, prospective clinical trial. SETTING: Urban emergency department. TYPE OF PARTICIPANTS: Ninety-one adult patients with simple linear lacerations were enrolled. Patients with allergy to lidocaine and patients with an abnormal mental status were excluded. INTERVENTIONS: Each wound edge was anesthetized with either plain or buffered lidocaine using a randomized, double-blind protocol. The pain of infiltration was measured with a previously validated visual analog pain scale. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Analysis of pooled data and paired data (using patients as their own controls) revealed that infiltrating buffered lidocaine was significantly less painful than plain lidocaine (P = .03 and P = .02, respectively). There was no significant difference in the anesthetic effectiveness of the two agents during suturing. CONCLUSION: Buffered lidocaine is preferable to plain lidocaine as a local anesthetic agent for the repair of simple lacerations. 
1	Familial occurrence of gastric cancer in the 2-year experience of a population-based registry. The authors studied the familial occurrence of tumors in 154 individuals with gastric cancer by reviewing the clinical data and the genealogical tree of all patients registered in 1986 through 1987 in the Local Health Care District of Modena, Italy, for cancer of the stomach. Crude and age-adjusted (world population) incidence rates of gastric cancer were 34.0 and 21.4 new cases/100,000/year, respectively, in men, and 24.5 and 10.9 in women, respectively. Among first-degree relatives of the registered patients there were 30 cases of gastric carcinoma versus 15 cases in a control group matched for age and sex (Mantel-Haenszel odds ratio [M-H OR] 3.14, P less than 0.01). This excess of gastric neoplasms was observed in siblings (17 versus 7, M-H OR 4.33, P less than 0.02) but not in parents (13 versus 8, not significant). Besides gastric cancer, there was no significant excess of other type of tumors in case families. The familial occurrence of gastric cancer tended to be more frequent in patients with "diffuse" carcinoma (52%) than in subjects with "intestinal" cancer (33%), although the difference was not statistically significant. In conclusion, the current investigation suggests that a "family history" for gastric neoplasms is usually observed in approximately 10% to 15% of the registered cases. As already described for other common malignancies, therefore, the familial occurrence of gastric carcinoma suggests the existence of a genetic susceptibility to cancer of the stomach, at least in a fraction of these patients. 
3	Internuclear ophthalmoplegia in the Chiari type II malformation. We describe 3 cases of Chiari type II malformation presenting with bilateral internuclear ophthalmoplegia (INO). Although prominent, the INO was not an isolated sign in any of the patients; superimposed abduction paresis was present in 2, and deficits in smooth pursuit, optokinetic nystagmus, and vestibulo-ocular responses were present in 3. Two had hydrocephalus: 1 was clinically unchanged without therapy after 5 years; the other did not improve with shunting. Findings in our 3 patients, along with the 4 previously reported, confirm that INO is 1 manifestation of widespread brainstem or cerebellar dysfunction. Its origin is probably multifactorial, related to hydrocephalus, vascular compromise, direct neuronal distortion, or congenital neural malformation. 
5	Topical silicone gel for the prevention and treatment of hypertrophic scar. We studied the effects of a silicone gel bandage that was worn for at least 12 hours daily on the resolution of hypertrophic burn scar. In a second cohort, the prevention of hypertrophic scar formation in fresh surgical incisions by this bandage was also evaluated. In 19 patients with hypertrophic burn scars, elasticity of the scars was quantitated serially with the use of an elastometer. An adjacent or mirror-image hypertrophic burn scar served as a control. Scar elasticity was increased after both 1 and 2 months compared with that in controls. There was corresponding improvement clinically that persisted for at least 6 months. In the other cohort, scar volume changes in 21 surgical incisions were measured before and after 1 and 2 months. Gel-treated incisions gained less volume than control incisions after both intervals. Clinical assessment corroborated this quantitative demonstration of a decrement in scar volume. We concluded that topical silicone gel is efficacious, both in the prevention and in the treatment of hypertrophic scar. 
4	Circulating plasma platelet activating factor in persistent pulmonary hypertension of the newborn. Platelet activating factor (PAF) is an endogenous phospholipid mediator that causes pulmonary hypertension and thrombocytopenia in experimental animal models. To investigate circulating PAF in persistent pulmonary hypertension of the newborn (PPHN), we studied PAF and its degradative enzyme, acetylhydrolase. Thirteen neonates with PPHN, diagnosed by routine clinical methods including echocardiography, were compared to six age-matched control patients with respiratory distress. Overall, plasma PAF levels were elevated in patients with PPHN compared to control patients (20.1 +/- 3.9 versus 1.6 +/- 0.7 ng/ml, p less than 0.01). In addition, plasma PAF concentrations in patients with PPHN correlated with the severity of disease as defined by the delta AaPO2 (r = 0.65, p = 0.015). In three patients with elevated PAF levels, as the clinical status improved, the plasma PAF values decreased. Acetylhydrolase activity was similar in both groups (3.96 +/- 0.90 versus 3.78 +/- 1.44 nmol/ml/min, p = NS). We conclude that PAF production is increased in PPHN and that abnormal production of PAF may be associated with pulmonary hypertension. 
1	Extrathoracic metastatic malignant thymoma. Diagnosis by aspiration cytology. A fine-needle aspirate from a hepatic mass in a 65-year-old white man was examined. The patient had a history of histologically confirmed thymoma with metastases in multiple thoracic sites. The smears showed a dimorphic population of epithelial cells and lymphocytes, characteristic of thymoma. The resemblance of the cytologic pattern to the primary neoplasm and positive reactivity with various immunohistochemical agents peculiar to thymomas confirmed the diagnosis. Aspiration cytology has been described in the diagnosis of primary thymoma. To our knowledge, this is the second reported case of a cytologic diagnosis of metastatic thymoma and the first one with immunohistochemical studies. 
5	MyoD induces growth arrest independent of differentiation in normal and transformed cells. MyoD is a gene involved in the control of muscle differentiation. We show that MyoD causes growth arrest when expressed in cell lines derived from tumors or transformed by different oncogenes. MyoD-induced growth inhibition was demonstrated by reduction in the efficiency of colony formation and at the single-cell level. We further show that MyoD growth inhibition can occur in cells that are not induced to activate muscle differentiation markers. The inhibitory activity of MyoD was mapped to the same 68-amino acid segment necessary and sufficient for induction of muscle differentiation, the basic-helix-loop-helix motif. Mutants with alterations in the basic region of MyoD that fail to bind or do not activate a muscle-specific enhancer inhibited growth; mutants with deletions in the helix-loop-helix region failed to inhibit growth. Thus, inhibition of cell growth by MyoD seems to occur by means of a parallel pathway to the one that leads to myogenesis. We conclude that MyoD is a prototypic gene capable of functionally activating intracellular growth inhibitory pathways. 
2	Achieving pH control in the critically ill patient: the role of continuous infusion of H2-receptor antagonists. Stress-related gastric mucosal damage is a common occurrence in intensive care unit (ICU) patients. Because of the significant morbidity and mortality associated with this mucosal damage, many ICU patients routinely receive prophylactic therapy, usually with histamine H2-receptor antagonists (H2RAs). Gastric acid secretion occurs in a circadian pattern, with late afternoon and evening surges. H2RAs by continuous infusion may control this uneven pattern of secretion more effectively than H2RAs given by bolus injection. More studies are needed to identify the target ICU population for prophylactic treatment. 
3	Familial hypobetalipoproteinaemia complicated by cerebellar ataxia and steatocystoma multiplex. A 55-year-old man with cerebellar ataxia and steatocystoma multiplex was found to have reduced serum concentrations of total cholesterol, betalipoprotein and apolipoprotein B. Computed tomography revealed atrophy of the cerebellum and brain stem. Of the six family members examined, four had hypobetalipoproteinaemia, and one had mild ataxia. Similar skin lesions were noted in five male relatives. This case represents a rare combination of familial hypobetalipoproteinaemia, cerebellar ataxia and steatocystoma multiplex. 
1	Invasive lobular carcinoma: mammographic findings in a 10-year experience From January 1, 1976 to December 30, 1985, 1,966 cases of breast carcinoma were diagnosed and treated at Malmo General Hospital, Malmo, Sweden. Of these cases, 185 (9.4%) involved invasive lobular carcinoma (ILC). Mammography in 137 cases demonstrated the following findings: spiculated opacity (53%), architectural distortion (16%), poorly defined opacity (7%), normal or benign findings (16%), and parenchymal asymmetry (4%). Radiographic definition of the ILC lesion varied greatly with projection: The craniocaudal view demonstrated significant findings more frequently than either the oblique or lateral views. Secondary radiographic findings were present in 31%, microcalcifications were rare, and physical findings were present in 89%. Because of its diffuse growth pattern and tendency to form lesions with opacity equal to or less than that of the parenchyma, ILC can be extremely difficult to detect mammographically. Therefore, the radiologist must be alert for subtle mammographic signs of malignancy and highly suspicious of any abnormal physical findings regardless of the mammographic appearance. 
3	An unusual complication of silastic dural substitute: case report. A case is presented in which a patient developed an unusual complication after the use of Silastic dural substitute. In 1983, the patient underwent removal of a meningioma with the involved dura. Five years later, he developed around the graft material a very thick connective tissue capsule, which simulated a recurrent meningioma clinically and radiologically. 
1	Bactericidal effect of doxycycline associated with lysosomotropic agents on Coxiella burnetii in P388D1 cells. There is no consistently reliable treatment for endocarditis resulting from chronic Coxiella burnetii infection, the causative agent of Q fever. Although certain antibiotics are recommended on the basis of their in vitro bactericidal activities, results of therapy with these antibiotics are often disappointing. To evaluate whether the currently recommended antibiotic susceptibility tests for C. burnetii give misleading results because of continued division of uninfected cells, thereby resulting in the dilution of infected cells and, hence, a false picture of antibiotic efficacy, we blocked cell division during antibiotic susceptibility testing with cycloheximide. Using this new method, we found that the currently recommended antibiotics for the treatment of Q fever, doxycycline, pefloxacin, and rifampin, did not reduce the ratio of infected to noninfected cells (either L929 or P388D1) by 9 days postinfection. To test the hypothesis that this lack of antibacterial activity is due to antibiotic inactivation by the low pH of the phagolysosomes in which C. burnetii is found, we used alkalinizing lysosomotropic agents (chloroquine or amantadine) concurrently with doxycycline. This resulted in the sterilization of C. burnetii infection in P388D1 cells. This finding seems to confirm our suspicion that the acidic conditions of the phagolysosomes in which C. burnetii is located inhibit antibiotic activity. This inhibition can be reversed in vitro when lysosomotropic alkalinizing agents are used. 
4	Bacterial endocarditis presenting as acute myocardial infarction: a cautionary note for the era of reperfusion. Coronary embolism is a known complication of bacterial endocarditis that sometimes causes acute myocardial infarction. The necessity for rapidly restoring coronary artery perfusion and the time constraints governing clinical decisions may prevent endocarditis from being diagnosed before pharmacologic or mechanical thrombolysis. This report describes the first documented cases of coronary angioplasty in two patients with acute myocardial infarction caused by bacterial endocarditis, and reviews the literature on coronary artery complications of bacterial endocarditis. The first patient developed a coronary artery mycotic aneurysm at the dilatation site; the second experienced a small intracerebral hemorrhage following reperfusion. It is, of course, unwise to generalize from two cases, but we believe that in patients who are most likely to have endocarditis as the cause of acute myocardial infarction, the impulse to follow conventional strategies for coronary reperfusion should be tempered by thoughts of possible consequences. 
5	Idiopathic intracranial hypertension. Although the cause of IIH remains obscure, loss of visual function is common, and patients may progress to blindness. Diagnosis should adhere to the modified Dandy criteria. Recent case-control studies cast doubt on the validity of many frequently cited conditions associated with IIH. Valid associations include obesity, recent weight gain, female sex, vitamin A intoxication, and steroid withdrawal. Management should include serial perimetry using a sensitive disease-specific strategy so the proper therapy can be selected and visual loss prevented or reversed. 
4	Alcohol consumption--a risk factor for hemorrhagic and non-hemorrhagic stroke. PURPOSE: The risks of alcohol consumption and its association with stroke were studied in 621 patients with stroke and 573 control subjects using case-control methods. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients with stroke were subdivided into 193 with subarachnoid hemorrhage, 91 with intracerebral hemorrhage, and 337 with cerebral infarction. Data on recent alcohol consumption were obtained by questionnaire in patients with stroke and compared with data from an occupational screening survey in control subjects. RESULTS: Relative risks, adjusted for confounding variables, exhibited J-shaped associations with increasing levels of alcohol consumption classified into four categories--abstainer, 1 to 90 g, 100 to 390 g, and greater than or equal to 400 g weekly). The individual risks were 1, 0.7, 0.5, and 1.3 for subarachnoid hemorrhage; 1.0, 0.6, 0.5., and 2.5 for intracerebral hemorrhage, and 1.0, 0.6, 0.7, and 2.4 for cerebral infarction for men and women combined. CONCLUSIONS: The results suggest that low levels of alcohol consumption may have some protective effect upon the cerebral vasculature, whereas heavy consumption predisposes to both hemorrhagic and non-hemorrhagic stroke. 
4	Depression after acute myocardial infarction. The role of primary care physicians in rehabilitation. Depression is a common problem after myocardial infarction. Diagnosis is facilitated by use of the criteria for depression in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders and self-rating questionnaires. Treatment may involve both psychological and pharmacologic interventions. The patient's medical status must be carefully assessed before administration of antidepressant medication. All antidepressants are contraindicated immediately after myocardial infarction. When signs and symptoms of depression are exhibited early in the recovery phase, alprazolam (Xanax) may offer advantages over more traditional antidepressants. Further research is necessary to determine the safety of newer antidepressants. 
5	Dysplasia and DNA aneuploidy in a pelvic pouch. Report of a case. A patient with an 18-year history of ulcerative colitis was operated on with colectomy, mucosal proctectomy, ileoanal anastomosis, and an S-type pelvic pouch due to intractable chronic continuous disease. The patient was followed by endoscopic controls and biopsy sampling from the pouch at regular intervals. A gradual development of severe atrophy in the ileal mucosa was followed by the development of low grade dysplasia. At the most recent endoscopic control, 4 years after the construction of the pouch, biopsies were sampled also for flow cytometric DNA analyses. DNA aneuploidy was detected in a biopsy from the center of the pouch, and a biopsy taken immediately adjacent showed low grade dysplasia. These findings underline the importance of endoscopic follow-up after construction of a pelvic pouch and focus attention to the potential of malignant transformation of the mucosa. 
5	Perirenal candidial abscess. Perirenal candidial abscesses are rare, with few well-documented cases in the literature. We describe a case of a perinephric abscess treated with amphotericin B and nephrectomy. 
5	Novel primitive lymphoid tumours induced in transgenic mice by cooperation between myc and bcl-2. The putative oncogene bcl-2 is juxtaposed to the immunoglobulin heavy chain (Igh) locus by the t(14;18) chromosomal translocation typical of human follicular B-cell lymphomas. The bcl-2 gene product is not altered by the translocation, but its expression is deregulated, presumably by the Igh enhancer E mu. Constitutive bcl-2 expression seems to augment cell survival, as infection with a bcl-2 retrovirus enables certain growth factor-dependent mouse cell lines to maintain viability when deprived of factor. Furthermore, high levels of the bcl-2 product can protect human B and T lymphoblasts under stress and thereby confer a growth advantage. Mice expressing a bcl-2 transgene controlled by the Igh enhancer accumulate small non-cycling B cells which survive unusually well in vitro but do not show a propensity for spontaneous tumorigenesis. In contrast, an analogous myc transgene, designed to mimic the myc-Igh translocation product typical of Burkitt's lymphoma and rodent plasmacytoma, promotes B lymphoid cell proliferation and predisposes mice to malignancy in pre-B and B lymphoid cells. Previous experiments have suggested that bcl-2 can cooperate with deregulated myc to improve in vitro growth of pre-B and B cells. Here we describe a marked synergy between bcl-2 and myc in doubly transgenic mice. E mu-bcl-2/myc mice show hyperproliferation of pre-B and B cells and develop tumours much faster than E mu-myc mice. Suprisingly, the tumours derive from a cell with the hallmarks of a primitive haemopoietic cell, perhaps a lymphoid-committed stem cell. 
4	Time delays in the diagnosis and treatment of acute myocardial infarction: a tale of eight cities. Report from the Pre-hospital Study Group and the Cincinnati Heart Project. To establish the magnitude of prehospital and hospital delays in initiating thrombolytic therapy for acute myocardial infarction, the time from telephone 911 emergency medical system (EMS) activation to treatment and its components were analyzed from eight separate ongoing trials. This included estimates of ambulance response time, prehospital evaluation and treatment time, and time from admission to the hospital to initiation of thrombolytic therapy. The average time from EMS activation to patient arrival at the hospital was prospectively determined to be 46.1 +/- 8.2 minutes in 3715 patients from eight centers. The time from admission to the hospital to initiation of thrombolytic therapy was retrospectively determined to be 83.8 +/- 55.0 minutes in a separate group of 730 patients from six centers. Both the prehospital and hospital time delays were much longer than those perceived by paramedics and emergency department directors. Shorter hospital time delays were observed in patients in whom a prehospital ECG was obtained as part of a protocol-driven prehospital diagnostic strategy and a diagnosis of acute infarction made before arrival at the hospital (36.3 +/- 11.3 minutes in 13 patients). These results show that the magnitude of time required to evaluate, transport, and initiate thrombolytic therapy will preclude initiation of treatment to most patients within the first hour of symptoms. Implementation of a protocol-driven prehospital diagnostic strategy may be associated with a reduction in time to thrombolytic therapy. 
4	Deferoxamine fails to improve postischemic cardiac function in hypertrophied hearts. Myocardial hypertrophy is a well-recognized risk factor in congenital cardiac surgery. Hypertrophied hearts have been demonstrated to have an increased vulnerability to ischemia/reperfusion injury. We studied the effects of the iron chelator and hydroxyl radical scavenger deferoxamine given during early reperfusion in a model of isolated retroperfused rabbit hearts made hypertrophic by aortic banding early in life (1 week of age). The rabbits were studied at 6-8 weeks of age, and the hearts were subjected to 30 minutes of 37 degrees C ischemia followed by 30 minutes of reperfusion. Postischemic recovery of isovolumic developed pressure was measured by using an intracavitary balloon in both the untreated (n = 6) and the deferoxamine-treated (n = 6) groups and compared with normal age-matched controls. Deferoxamine (50 mumol/kg) was given to one group with the hypertrophied hearts during the first 10 minutes of reperfusion. The left ventricular weight/body weight ratio in the hypertrophied hearts was 2.9 +/- 0.4 x 10(-3) (n = 14) versus 2.0 +/- 0.1 x 10(-3) in the age-matched controls (p less than 0.05). Postischemic peak developed pressure recovered to 102 +/- 6% of the preischemic value in the normal hearts after 30 minutes of reperfusion compared with 75 +/- 5% for the untreated and 71 +/- 4% for the deferoxamine-treated hearts (p less than 0.05 vs. control). We conclude that chronic hypertrophy from early in life leads to increased susceptibility to ischemia and that the iron chelator deferoxamine is not effective in preventing the injury of reperfusion in hypertrophied hearts. 
2	The recalcitrant perineal wound after rectal extirpation. Applications of muscle flap closure. Perineal wounds developing after abdominoperineal resection result in chronic purulent drainage and intermittent episodes of sepsis and are generally unresponsive to conservative medical and surgical treatment. Thirteen consecutive patients (aged 27 to 74 years; mean, 48 years) who underwent debridement and immediate muscle flap closure of these wounds were analyzed to identify risk factors for delayed healing and to evaluate the effectiveness of muscle flap coverage. Three risk factors were identified: preoperative or postoperative radiation therapy, resection for recurrent carcinoma, and inflammatory bowel disease. A total of 19 muscle flaps (11 gracilis, five gluteal thigh, two gluteus maximus, and one rectus abdominis) were used to close these wounds. During an average 3.5-year follow-up, four (31%) minor complications and one (8%) recurrence were noted to occur. Muscle flaps provide safe, effective, single-stage procedures for the closure of chronic perineal wounds. 
5	Multi-Hospital Eastern Atlantic Restenosis Trial: design, recruitment, and feasibility. M-HEART Investigators. A randomized control trial was set up to examine factors that influence restenosis and determine the effects of corticosteroids on restenosis following successful PTCA. The rationale for the study agent chosen, design, recruitment, and feasibility, as well as initial patient demographic data and initial results are presented. 
3	Seizure-associated speech arrest in elderly patients Recurrent, brief episodes of speech arrest associated with bifrontal electroencephalographic seizure activity developed in three ill elderly patients. The seizures ceased after the initiation of antiepileptic drug therapy and the correction of metabolic abnormalities. The cause of the seizure activity remains unknown, but a possible mechanism may be a transient epileptogenic cortical dysfunction that predominantly affects the frontal lobes as a result of concomitant metabolic alterations. 
4	Protective effect of a novel calcium blocker, S-312-d, on ischemic acute renal failure in rat. The effect of the calcium blocker S-(+)-methyl 4,7-dihydro-3-isobutyl-6-methyl-4-(3-nitro-phenyl)thieno[2,3-b]pyridine- 5-carboxylate (S-312-d) on ischemic acute renal failure (ARF) was studied in rats. Ischemic ARF was induced by temporary (30-60 min) clamping of the left kidney 2 weeks after contralateral right nephrectomy. Plasma creatinine, creatinine clearance, urinary osmolality and fractional excretion of sodium were used to test the effectiveness of the drug. S-312-d (0.01-0.1 mg/kg b.wt. i.v.) administration before ischemia offered dose-dependent protection against the functional impairment induced by ischemia. This effect was accompanied by an increase in the survival rate of ischemic rats. S-312-d given after ischemia was not effective. The renal cortical edema induced by ischemia was significantly reduced by pretreatment with S-312-d. The increase in renal tissue calcium content observed after ischemia was also suppressed by S-312-d. Comparison with other established calcium blockers indicated S-312-d to be a good candidate for protection against ischemic ARF. These findings indicate that S-312-d may be clinically useful against renal ischemia. 
2	Anomalies of intestinal rotation in childhood: analysis of 447 cases. This report concerns 447 infants and children with anomalies of rotation and fixation. Patients were placed in four groups based on initial symptoms. Group A involved 18 patients with acute midgut volvulus. At laparotomy, midgut volvulus was noted and reduction of midgut volvulus and a Ladd procedure were performed in 10 cases and resection was required in 8. There were five deaths (28%). Group B included 54 children with chronic symptoms of intermittent volvulus or duodenal obstruction. Group C involved 44 cases of malrotation observed during exploration for other disorders. Patients in groups B and C underwent a Ladd procedure and appendectomy. There were five unrelated deaths. Group D included 331 neonates with malrotation caused by either diaphragmatic hernia (n = 111) or abdominal wall defects (n = 220). A Ladd procedure was performed on 48 patients with abdominal wall defects and 29 surviving children with diaphragmatic hernia. Only 2 of 172 (1.2%) patients with abdominal wall defects and 1 of 34 (2.9%) patients with diaphragmatic hernia not treated for malrotation had midgut volvulus. Midgut volvulus is more common in infants and is associated with a high mortality rate (28%). Patients with malrotation and chronic obstructive symptoms or those observed during other elective procedures should undergo a Ladd procedure because of the risk of midgut volvulus. The risk of midgut volvulus is low in patients with abdominal wall defects and, probably as a result of adhesions from previous neonatal operations. 
5	Benign biliary strictures: treatment with percutaneous cholangioplasty. Results of percutaneous balloon cholangioplasty of 17 patients with 28 benign biliary strictures were compared with those of published radiologic and surgical series to determine whether stricture location was related to therapeutic success and whether a patient should undergo percutaneous or surgical therapy. Treatment was considered successful if there was no anatomic evidence of recurrent stricture or need for surgery (mean follow-up, 32 months). Treatment was successful in all nine (100%) intrahepatic (zone 1) strictures, 11 of 12 (92%) extrahepatic-extrapancreatic (zone 2) strictures, one of three (33%) intrapancreatic (zone 3) strictures, and three of four (75%) bilienteric anastomotic (zone 4) strictures. Restenosis occurred in five patients; cholangioplasty was ultimately successful in two of those patients after redilation and stent placement. On the basis of these results and those of published radiologic and surgical series, the authors believe that cholangioplasty is the treatment of choice for zone 1 strictures and is as effective as surgery for zone 2 and 4 strictures. Patients with zone 2 and 4 strictures with concomitant portal hypertension or a history of multiple previous biliary surgical procedures should be considered good candidates for cholangioplasty. Zone 3 strictures may be better treated surgically than percutaneously. 
3	Is caffeine withdrawal the mechanism of postoperative headache? This study examined the hypothesis that headache after general anesthesia is related to a caffeine withdrawal state. Two hundred eighty-seven patients undergoing minor elective procedures under general anesthesia were studied. Four to six hours after anesthesia each patient completed a questionnaire assessing his or her own alcohol, tobacco, and caffeine consumption, and the occurrence of postoperative side effects. A highly significant difference was found between the caffeine consumption of patients with and without preoperative (P = 0.0035) and postoperative (P less than 0.0001) headache. Logistic regression analysis of trend between headache and caffeine consumption suggested that with each 100-mg increase in caffeine consumption, there was a 12% increase in the odds of headache developing in the immediate preoperative period (P less than 0.0066) and a 16% increase in the odds of postoperative headache developing (P less than 0.0001). No relationship was found between headache and the patients' age, sex, usual frequency of headache, consumption of alcohol or nicotine, or the anesthetic agents or adjuvants used. It is concluded that postoperative headache is related to caffeine intake and that this relationship is explained, at least in part, by a perioperative caffeine withdrawal syndrome.
