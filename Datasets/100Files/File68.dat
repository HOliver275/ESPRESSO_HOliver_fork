Comparison of the metabolic effects of continuous postoperative enteral feeding and feeding at night only. The effects of two different feeding patterns on oxygen consumption, nitrogen balance, blood biochemistry, and urinary catecholamine excretion were investigated over 5 d in patients after major head and neck surgery. Both groups of nine patients each were fed a regimen that provided 4.7 MJ on day 1 and 10 MJ on days 2-5 via a nasogastric tube by continuous infusion with an enteral feeding pump. One group was fed continuously for 24 h, the other was fed only at night, ie, from 1700 to 0900 the next morning. Oxygen consumption was significantly higher (P less than 0.01), nitrogen balance better (P less than 0.05), and urinary catecholamine excretion higher (P less than 0.05) in the 24-h-fed patients than in the night-fed patients. Postoperatively, feeding at night only is more energy efficient than is feeding continuously for 24 h, but is associated with poorer nitrogen balance. These differences may be mediated by sympathoadrenal mechanisms. 
Nonhealing leg ulcers: a manifestation of basal cell carcinoma. Seven patients with basal cell carcinomas presenting as nonhealing ulcers are reported. The importance of considering malignancy and taking biopsy specimens of leg ulcers that fail to respond to treatment is emphasized. 
Diagnostic value of transesophageal compared with transthoracic echocardiography in infective endocarditis. To compare the diagnostic value of transesophageal and transthoracic echocardiography in infective endocarditis, paired transesophageal and transthoracic echocardiograms were obtained prospectively for 66 episodes of suspected endocarditis in 62 patients. Echocardiographic results were compared with the presence or absence of endocarditis determined by pathologic or nonechocardiographic data from the subsequent clinical course. All echocardiograms were interpreted by an observer told only that the studies were from patients in whom the diagnosis of endocarditis was suspected. The diagnosis of endocarditis was eventually made in 16 of the 66 episodes of suspected endocarditis (14 by pathologic and 2 by clinical criteria). In 7 of 16 transthoracic and 15 of 16 transesophageal echocardiograms, endocarditis was diagnosed at a probability level of "almost certain," giving a sensitivity of 44% and 94%, respectively (p less than 0.01). For the remaining episodes, 49 of 50 transthoracic and all transesophageal studies yielded normal results, giving a specificity of 98% and 100%, respectively. This study suggests that transesophageal echocardiography is highly sensitive and specific for the diagnosis of infective endocarditis and significantly more sensitive than transthoracic echocardiography. Although echocardiography cannot rule out endocarditis, the high diagnostic sensitivity of transesophageal echocardiography results in a low probability of the disease when the study yields negative results in a patient with an intermediate likelihood of the disease. 
Uhthoff's symptom in optic neuritis: relationship to magnetic resonance imaging and development of multiple sclerosis. Eighty-one patients with a first attack of isolated optic neuritis, 40 with Uhthoff's symptom (Group 1) and 41 without (Group 2), were studied. All had a neurovisual examination, 74 of 81 patients had the pattern visual evoked potential recorded at rest, and 43 had magnetic resonance imaging brain scans. The pattern visual evoked potential P100 latency was prolonged, Group 1 with a mean of 136 +/- 19 msec. Group 2 with a mean of 131 +/- 19 msec (control subjects, 102 +/- 5 msec; n = 84), and the P100 amplitude was reduced, without significant difference between the groups. Abnormal magnetic resonance imaging scans were present in significantly more patients in Group 1 (p less than 0.025). Treatment of optic neuritis with corticosteroids had no effect on the evolution or duration of Uhthoff's symptom. Overall, 35 of 81 (43%) patients, followed for a mean of 3.5 years, developed multiple sclerosis. The incidence was significantly greater in Group 1 (p less than 0.01). Uhthoff's symptom also correlated with a higher incidence of recurrent optic neuritis. We conclude that Uhthoff's symptom is a prognostic indicator for the early development of multiple sclerosis. 
Prostatic abscess due to histoplasma capsulatum in the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome. We report a case of prostate abscess due to Histoplasma capsulatum in a patient with the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome. The diagnosis and management are discussed, and the literature is reviewed. 
Malignancy and chronic wounds: Marjolin's ulcer. Malignancy in chronic wounds is not uncommon and has been reported as occurring in chronic scars of diverse causes. We report an unusual case of bilateral thermal injuries of the lower extremities that 40 years later presented as very large, painful, fungating wounds of both lower legs. After histologic confirmation of squamous cell carcinoma, eradication of the disease required amputations of both the lower extremities and reconstructive procedures. In addition, we discuss current theories regarding the mechanism of malignant degeneration in chronic wounds and evaluate treatment on the basis of information currently available in the literature. 
Isolated atrial infarction in a patients with single vessel disease of the sinus node artery. Atrial infarction is found in approximately 17 percent of autopsy-proven cases of myocardial infarction, but is a frequently missed clinical diagnosis. The antemortem diagnosis of atrial infarction occurring in the absence of ventricular infarction has not been previously reported. We present a patient with ischemic chest discomfort associated with paroxysmal atrial fibrillation. Electrocardiographic and enzymatic changes were consistent with atrial infarction. Cardiac catheterization demonstrated single vessel critical stenosis at the origin of the sinus node artery. Combined atrial and ventricular infarction occurs frequently and should be considered in the setting of paroxysmal supraventricular arrhythmias occurring early in the course of ventricular myocardial infarction. Lone atrial infarction is a rare but distinct clinical entity. The tetrad of typical ischemic chest discomfort, paroxysmal supraventricular arrhythmia, P-Ta segment shifts, and elevated cardiac enzyme levels without evidence for ventricular infarction strongly suggests isolated atrial infarction. 
Dietary adjustments and nutritional therapy during treatment for oral-pharyngeal dysphagia. Dietary adjustments are an important part of the therapy for dysphagia. Once dysphagia is diagnosed, the patient must be nourished safely while being taught therapeutic and compensatory strategies for dealing with the swallowing disorder. The patient's nutritional status must be maintained despite any limitations on oral intake. Liquids may be thickened and the consistency of solid foods may be adjusted to ensure an adequate diet that is safe for the patient. When the patient cannot eat safely or take adequate amounts of food orally, an alternative feeding method should be instituted. 
Reproductive and menstrual factors and risk of peritoneal and ovarian endometriosis. OBJECTIVE: Between 1987 and 1989 data were collected to evaluate risk factors for pelvic endometriosis. DESIGN: A case-control study was conducted on 241 cases with laparoscopically or laparotomically confirmed peritoneal or ovarian endometriosis consecutively admitted to three teaching hospitals in Northern Italy. The control group consisted of 437 women admitted to hospitals for acute conditions covering similar catchment areas. RESULTS: Compared with nulliparous women, the risk of endometriosis decreased with increasing number of births: the point estimates were 0.4 and 0.3, respectively, for those with one and two or more births (X2(1) trend = 50.3, P less than 0.001). No relation emerged with age at first birth and spontaneous miscarriages. Relative to women whose menarche occurred at age 11 or younger, the risk of endometriosis was slightly lower in those who experienced later menarche, but the trend in risk was not significant. Women with irregular menstrual cycles showed a lower frequency of the disease (relative risk, 0.3; 95% confidence interval, 0.2 to 0.5). The role of various factors was largely similar for different disease locations (ovary, peritoneum, and both) and indication for diagnostic surgery (sterility, pelvic pain, and other reasons). CONCLUSIONS: This study found that parity and irregular/long menses lower the risk of endometriosis. These findings were similar in different subgroups of disease location and indication for surgery, giving strong evidence of the consistency of the general results. 
Benign arterial dissections of the posterior circulation. Four young adults with spontaneous dissection of the vertebrobasilar system are reported. Clinically, two patients presented with subarachnoid hemorrhage and two with brain-stem ischemia. In two cases of ruptured arterial dissection of the posterior cerebral artery, angiography demonstrated fusiform and "sausage-like" dilatation of the involved vessel. In two cases of occlusive dissection of the basilar artery, angiography revealed the typical "string sign." All four patients were treated conservatively: three survive in good clinical condition and one remains disabled. Follow-up angiograms showed spontaneous healing of the lesion with return to an almost normal arterial configuration in two cases; residual narrowing corresponding to the dissection was the most notable finding in the other two. It is recommended that, in a subset of neurologically stable patients, angiographic monitoring is undertaken to assess the tendency for spontaneous repair before surgical intervention is planned. 
Cystoscopic suction diathermy for the treatment of superficial bladder tumours. The treatment of superficial bladder tumours (Ta, T1) is a time-consuming exercise for urological surgeons and patients. A method of treating the tumours, whether primary or recurrent, by endoscopic suction diathermy has been developed. The technique significantly reduces the amount of tumour debris within the bladder during treatment as well as the amount of diathermy employed. By removing the free tumour cells in the irrigation fluid the risk of tumour cell implantation may be kept to a minimum. 
Right ventricular pacing and left ventricular filling pattern. An echo-Doppler study. The influence of right ventricular pacing on left ventricular filling has not been completely clarified. The aim of the study was to analyze the possible alteration in and effects on left ventricular filling resulting from right ventricular pacing. The study population consisted of two groups; group A was comprised of 12 patients with a spontaneous left bundle branch block, and group B had 12 patients without left bundle branch block. All the patients underwent an interrogation of the mitral valve inflow by Doppler echocardiography, in order to measure isovolumic relaxation time, early and late peak velocity (E and A wave), E/A ratio and deceleration time. The study was performed at spontaneous rhythm and after, inhibition of the pacemaker. In group A, there were no changes in the Doppler parameters when passing from a spontaneous to an 80/min electrically induced rhythm. Analysis of group B revealed a statistically significant lengthening of IVR and Dec t with electrical stimulation. No statistically significant differences were found when we compared the Doppler parameters of the two populations at the same pacing frequency. Right ventricular pacing causes interventricular asynchrony and abnormalities in diastolic filling times, which resulted in a lengthening of either IVR and Dec t, simulating a pattern of abnormal relaxation. 
Preoperative segmental localization of hepatic metastases: utility of three-dimensional CT during arterial portography. To evaluate the accuracy of a fast three-dimensional (3D) reconstruction technique in determining the segmental location of hepatic metastases, 14 patients (40 metastases) were prospectively investigated before surgery with dynamic two-dimensional (2D) computed tomography during sequential arterial portography (CTAP). All patients underwent subsequent hepatic tumor resection within 4 days. After computer-generated mapping of hepatic venous structures with high attenuation and metastases with low attenuation, 3D reconstruction was performed. Thirty-six of the 40 lesions (90%) were detected with 2D and 3D CTAP. The accuracy in determining the segmental location of hepatic metastases was 78% (28 of the 36 metastases) for 2D CTAP and 94% (34 of the 36 metastases) for 3D CTAP. The difference in localization rates between 2D CTAP and 3D CTAP was statistically significant. The 3D CTAP technique provides vital data unattainable with other imaging modalities that improve the preoperative assessment of the resectability of hepatic metastases and allows planning a safer surgical approach. 
Chorea-acanthocytosis: abnormal composition of covalently bound fatty acids of erythrocyte membrane proteins. Phospholipid class, peak profile of each phospholipid class, loosely bound fatty acids, covalently (tightly) bound fatty acids of the erythrocyte membranes, and plasma fatty acids were investigated using high-performance liquid chromatography in six patients with chorea-acanthocytosis and 14 age- and sex-matched normal control subjects. Additionally, six patients with Huntington's disease were included as disease control subjects in the study of covalently bound fatty acids. Study of covalently (tightly) bound fatty acids in erythrocyte membrane proteins after alkaline hydrolysis, hitherto undescribed in chorea-acanthocytosis, revealed that palmitic acid (C16:0) was significantly increased and stearic acid (C18:0) was decreased in the patients with chorea-acanthocytosis. Analyses for total covalently bound fatty acids disclosed that palmitic and docosahexaenoic (C22:6) acids were increased and stearic acid was decreased in chorea-acanthocytosis. Phospholipid class (phosphatidylcholine, phosphatidylethanolamine, sphingomyelin, and phosphatidylserine) and peak profile of each phospholipid class from the erythrocyte membranes did not differ between the patients with chorea-acanthocytosis and the control subjects. Of the loosely bound fatty acids, linoleic acid (C18:2) was significantly decreased in those with chorea-acanthocytosis, which seemed to be nonspecific. 
The anterior inferior cerebellar artery in the internal auditory canal. It has been proposed that compression of the auditory and vestibular nerve trunks by vascular loops might be the cause of otherwise unexplained hearing loss, tinnitus, and vertigo, as well as Meniere's disease. We studied the human temporal bone histological collection at the Massachusetts Eye and Ear Infirmary to determine whether audiovestibular symptoms could be correlated with the presence of the anterior inferior cerebellar artery within the internal auditory canal. Anterior inferior cerebellar artery loops were found within the internal auditory canals of 12.3% of 1327 temporal bones, about half the number found when preparations with intact brains are studied. This difference can be attributed to avulsion of the anterior inferior cerebellar artery during removal of the brain at autopsy. There were 5 cases of unexplained unilateral hearing loss with anterior inferior cerebellar artery loops: 3 in the opposite ear and 2 in both ears. There were 2 cases with unilateral unexplained tinnitus with anterior inferior cerebellar artery loops: 1 in the involved ear and 1 in the opposite ear. A case with bilateral tinnitus had an anterior inferior cerebellar artery loop in 1 ear. There were 29 cases of vertigo with no peripheral histopathological correlate or central nervous system disorder; anterior inferior cerebellar artery loops were found in the internal auditory canals of 7 (12.5%) of the 56 ears in this group, which is not significantly different from the 12.3% incidence recorded for the entire collection. In 23 cases of unilateral Meniere's disease, there were anterior inferior cerebellar artery loops in the hydropic ears in 3, the opposite ear in 1, and both ears in 1. We can find no correlation between unexplained hearing loss, tinnitus, vertigo, or Meniere's disease and the presence of the anterior inferior cerebellar artery in the internal auditory canal. 
The I-Abm12 mutation, which confers resistance to experimental myasthenia gravis, drastically affects the epitope repertoire of murine CD4+ cells sensitized to nicotinic acetylcholine receptor. Susceptibility to experimental autoimmune myasthenia gravis (EAMG), which is induced in mice by injection of purified Torpedo nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (TAChR), is influenced by the I-A locus products, which restrict presentation of AChR Th epitopes. The bm12 mutation of the I-Ab molecule in the C57BL/6 strain, which is highly susceptible to EAMG, yields the EAMG resistant mutant B6.C-H-2bm12 (bm12). We investigated here the consequences of the bm 12 mutation on the CD4+ response to the TAChR alpha subunit. Upon immunization with TAChR, CD4+ cells became sensitized to TAChR and anti-AChR antibodies were produced in both bm12 and C57BL/6 strains. Overlapping synthetic peptides, corresponding to the complete sequence of TAChR alpha subunit, were used to identify Th epitopes. CD4+ cells from C57BL/6 mice recognized peptides T alpha 150-169, T alpha 181-200, and T alpha 360-378. CD4+ cells from bm12 mice did not respond to any synthetic sequence. Upon injection of the three C57BL/6 Th epitope peptides, either individually or as a pool, CD4+ cells from C57BL/6 mice recognized each peptide and TAChR. Therefore they recognized epitopes similar or identical to those originated from TAChR processing. CD4+ cells from bm12 mice injected with the same peptides responded to T alpha 360-378 strongly, to a lesser extent to T alpha 181-200, never to peptide T alpha 150-169. Only CD4+ cells sensitized against the T epitope peptide T alpha 181-200 responded to TAChR. We tested if lack of response to T alpha 150-169, and the low response to T alpha 181-200, was due to inability of the I-Abm12 molecule to present the T epitope peptides. bm12 and C57BL/6 APC were used to present the T epitope peptides to specifically sensitized CD4+ cells from C57BL/6 mice. All T epitope peptides were presented by bm12 APC, although T alpha 150-169 was presented less efficiently than by C57BL/6 APC. Resistance to EAMG induced by the bm12 mutation may be due to the change in the epitope repertoire of AChR-specific Th cells, and lack of recognition of otherwise immunodominant Th epitopes. For at least one epitope this might be due to absence of potentially reactive, specific CD4+ clones. 
In vivo T-cell activation by staphylococcal enterotoxin B prevents outgrowth of a malignant tumor. Treatment of T cells with staphylococcal enterotoxins in vitro is known to activate T cells in a subset restricted manner based on beta-chain variable region (V beta) gene expression. In particular, staphylococcal enterotoxin B (SEB) activates T cells bearing V beta 7 or V beta 8. We examined the ability of SEB to activate T cells in vivo. Treatment of C3H mice with doses of SEB ranging from 5 to 250 micrograms resulted in a dose-dependent activation of V beta 8+ T cells as reflected by increased interleukin 2 receptor (IL-2R) expression, proliferation to exogenous IL-2 and allogeneic cells, and production of gamma interferon. SEB also caused proliferation of the CD8+ subset of V beta 8+ cells in vivo. Thus, T-cell activation by SEB in vivo appears to be specific since V beta 2+ cells (non-SEB reactive) did not show increases in IL-2R expression similar to those seen with V beta 8+ cells nor did they proliferate. We then studied the ability of these activated cells to potentiate the immune response to a malignant progressor tumor. Treatment of C3H mice with 50 micrograms of SEB at the time of inoculation with tumor fragments resulted in a statistically significant decrease in the frequency of tumor outgrowth. These data demonstrate that treatment of C3H mice with SEB results in specific activation of V beta 8+ cells in vivo and that these activated cells are capable of preventing the outgrowth of a malignant tumor. 
Value of follow-up procedures in patients with large-cell lymphoma who achieve a complete remission. Salvage therapy for relapsed large-cell lymphoma (LCL) is more effective in patients with minimal disease, suggesting that early detection of relapse might increase the chance of long-term survival. To determine whether current follow-up procedures are effective in identifying preclinical disease, we analyzed patterns of relapse in 139 LCL patients who achieved a complete remission (CR) with high/moderate-dose methotrexate with leucovorin, bleomycin, doxorubicin, cyclophosphamide, vincristine, and dexamethasone (M/m-BACOD). The timing and results of all posttreatment follow-up tests were examined in the 36 patients who relapsed from complete remission (CR) and 46 controls who remain in CR. Despite conscientious posttreatment follow-up, only two of the 36 relapses (6%) were detected before the development of symptoms. Sixty-seven percent of patients relapsed in new disease sites (42% in new and old sites, and 25% in new sites only). Consistent with this observation, the tests most sensitive to clinical relapse were those not targeted to specific sites of disease: gallium scan (sensitivity, 90%), physical examination (80%), and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) (65%). Of screening tests performed, only LDH was successful in detecting preclinical relapse, with a sensitivity of 42% and specificity of 85% for impending symptomatic relapse. These results indicate that conventional screening was ineffective in detecting preclinical relapse in LCL patients. We recommend prospective evaluation of a strategy that (1) screens with a frequency appropriate to a patient's risk of relapse, (2) uses sensitive test(s) not targeted to specific sites, and (3) limits aggressive screening to those high-risk patients eligible for potentially curative salvage therapy. 
Acute monarticular arthritis. Sleuthing out the cause. The diagnosis of acute monarthritis depends heavily on a thorough history and physical examination. When these are combined with a few diagnostic tests, such as synovial fluid analysis, x-ray studies, complete blood cell count, and common blood chemical analyses, the majority of cases can be correctly diagnosed and properly treated. 
Occult breast masses: use of a mammographic localizing grid for US evaluation. To determine if there was a problem of misidentification of mammographically detected masses with freehand ultrasound (US), the authors examined 50 mammographically distinct masses in 47 patients who were scheduled to undergo needle localization. In only six cases were the masses to be localized in an area of the breast that contained other mammographic opacities that could have led to problems of identification. The patients were first studied with freehand US. Results were then compared with those subsequently obtained with a fenestrated mammographic compression grid to guide the US evaluation. Needle localization was then performed. In five of 50 cases, masses detected with freehand US and initially believed to correspond to the mammographically detected mass were subsequently found to represent different areas of the breast when US was used with the compression grid. These results suggest that the potential for misidentification of masses with freehand US is real and that a mammographic grid localization device can be used to overcome this problem. 
New trends in gallstone management. Many new therapies for the management of gallstone disease have been pioneered in the past decade. The object of this review is to equip the surgeon with the answers to all of the questions a patient will ask about gallstone therapy; the review is therefore didactic as well as comprehensive. 
Acute asthma. Admission chest radiography in hospitalized adult patients. The utility of admission chest radiography has been controversial in the management of adult patients admitted to the hospital with acute asthma. We reviewed the impact of admission chest radiography on in-hospital management of 54 adult patients with acute asthma. Each patient was admitted after a failed 12-h course of bronchodilator therapy in the emergency ward. Major radiographic abnormalities were found in 20 (34 percent) of 58 occasions. These abnormalities included focal parenchymal opacities, IIM, enlarged cardiac silhouette, pulmonary vascular congestion, new solitary pulmonary nodule and pneumothorax. Subsequent antibiotic use correlated with radiographic focal opacities or IIM, even in afebrile patients, but did not correlate with elevated blood leukocyte count. Based on the evidence of in-hospital alteration of management independent of elevated blood leukocyte count and body temperature, we recommend that chest radiographs be obtained for all adult patients admitted because of acute asthma. 
Identification of different laminin binding proteins in basolateral cell membranes of human colorectal carcinomas and normal colonic mucosa. The adhesive properties of tumour cells to laminin, the major glycoprotein of basement membranes, play a crucial part in the complex process of tumour invasion and metastasis. We therefore investigated the expression of laminin binding proteins in isolated basolateral cell membranes of human colorectal carcinomas and the adjacent normal colonic mucosa. Cell membrane binding assays and immunoblotting experiments showed appreciable quantitative and qualitative differences in the expression of these proteins in neoplastic and normal tissue. Epithelial basolateral cell membranes of colorectal carcinomas bound five to eight times more radioactive labelled laminin than basolateral cell membranes of the adjacent normal colonic epithelium. The expression of laminin binding proteins with Mr 66,000-69,000 daltons corresponding to the so called 'Mr 67,000 dalton laminin receptor' was three to four times higher in colorectal carcinomas than in normal colonic epithelium. In addition, laminin binding proteins with higher molecular weights, which may be related to the family of integrins, were also increased in colorectal carcinomas. In particular, laminin binding proteins with Mr 180,000 daltons were exclusively expressed on neoplastic epithelial cells of human colorectal carcinomas. Our data suggest that certain classes of laminin binding proteins may be selectively expressed on colonic tumour cells, leading to an increased capacity for migration, invasion, and metastasis. 
Hyperthermia deaths in Finland in 1970-86. All cases in which hyperthermia had been determined as the basic cause of death during the period 1970-86 were collected from the records of the Central Statistical Office of Finland. Of the total of 230 cases, 228 were included in the present study; the two remaining victims died abroad, and no autopsy was performed in Finland. Most of the hyperthermia deaths occurred while the decedent was taking a sauna bath; most decedents were men aged 42-62 years. An increase in the total number of hyperthermia deaths, and of male victims, was noted from the beginning of the 1970s onward; the number of female victims remained at a relatively steady level throughout, with the exception of a slight rise in 1986. Acute alcohol consumption was detected in most of the victims; in some cases there was also a reference to chronic alcoholism or recent long-term heavy drinking. The findings suggest that in addition to the acute hazardous effect of ethanol on thermoregulatory mechanisms, the long-term consumption of alcohol may have promoted fatal hyperthermia in these subjects. 
Socioeconomic status and morbidity and mortality in hypertensive blacks. Despite an overall limited range of social and economic opportunities in the recent past, blacks of lower socioeconomic status have experienced marked excesses in hypertension-related burdens compared with their more advantaged peers: the incidence, prevalence, and severity of hypertension and its end-organ sequelae increased with decreasing educational achievement and the 5-year mortality was two times higher for black hypertensives of lower than higher educational achievement under conditions of usual care in U.S. communities in the 1970s. The Stepped Care program of antihypertensive pharmacologic therapy of the HDFP reduced all-cause mortality by 19% for black hypertensive men and 28% for black women. The HDFP also eliminated the association of mortality with educational achievement; the favorable impact of the program was greatest in the group at highest risk, blacks of lowest socioeconomic status. 
Diagnostic usefulness of renal scanning after angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors [editorial] Radioisotopic renal scanning after angiotensin converting enzyme inhibition (ACEI) has proven to be an exciting area for research. The biologic activity of markers such as DTPA and hippuran, when combined with the physiological effects of ACEI, may provide noninvasive methods of diagnosing both renal artery stenosis and renovascular hypertension. Recent investigators have demonstrated that the sensitivities and specificities of these tests may vary widely; these differences are probably due to variations in study design, patient population, diagnostic criteria, and outcome measurements. We have reviewed these studies and discuss these possible sources of variation and their impact on the clinical usefulness of these diagnostic tests, especially in relation to the prevalence of disease in the population. Current results suggest that the post-ACEI DTPA scan is relatively accurate in the diagnosis of renal artery stenosis, with sensitivity generally greater than 90% and specificity around 95%. However, the best results in predicting the response to angioplasty or surgery in patients with renal artery stenosis have been with the use of post-ACEI hippuran in combination with furosemide (sensitivity, 96%; specificity, 95%). With confirmation of these findings and continued investigation, it is expected that accurate noninvasive tests will be available for widespread clinical use in the near future. 
Prevention of cisplatin-induced emesis: a double-blind multicenter randomized crossover study comparing ondansetron and ondansetron plus dexamethasone. Ondansetron (OND) is a new 5-HT3 receptor antagonist that give complete protection from emesis/nausea in approximately 50% of cisplatin (CDDP)-treated patients. To evaluate if dexamethasone (DEX) added to OND increases antiemetic efficacy, we carried out a double-blind randomized crossover study to compare the antiemetic activity of OND with OND plus DEX. One hundred two chemotherapy-naive patients (44 women and 58 men) scheduled to receive CDDP chemotherapy at doses greater than or equal to 50 mg/m2 entered the study. Eighty-nine patients completed both cycles with the following results: complete protection from emesis/nausea was obtained in 57/59 patients (64.0%/66.3%) with OND and in 81/79 (91.0%/88.8%) with OND plus DEX (P = .0005/P = .0021). At the end of the study, 53% of the patients expressed a treatment preference, and of these, 74% chose OND plus DEX compared with 26% who preferred OND alone, a statistically significant difference (P less than .003). Side effects were very mild and not significantly different between the two treatments. We conclude that OND plus DEX is more efficacious than OND in protecting patients from CDDP-induced emesis and nausea. 
Autoimmune MRL-1 pr/1pr mice are an animal model for the secondary antiphospholipid syndrome. Patients with systemic lupus erythematosus often develop thrombosis, recurrent abortion, thrombocytopenia and neurological disease, in association with serum antibodies against phospholipids, termed the secondary antiphospholipid syndrome. In our search for an animal model for the human antiphospholipid syndrome, we examined the MRL-1pr/pr mouse, which develops a lupus-like illness. These mice were found to have significantly elevated levels of serum antiphospholipid antibodies (aPL) and thrombocytopenia compared to normal mice. By immunodiffusion, these antibodies are similar to human aPL. We observed histologic evidence of central nervous system thromboses as well as perivascular infiltrates of the choroid plexus. The high titers of serum aPL, thrombocytopenia, and thrombosis establish this strain as an animal model for the secondary antiphospholipid syndrome. 
Effects of splenectomy on pulmonary metastasis and growth of SC42 carcinoma transplanted into mouse liver. The carcinoma SC42 was transplanted into the liver of its syngeneic mice DS, and the immunological integrity of the spleen and the effects of splenectomy on the growth and pulmonary metastasis of the liver tumor were assessed. On day 7 after liver tumor transplantation, the natural killer (NK) activity of the splenocytes was significantly elevated; it subsequently decreased at a later stage of the tumor. The response of the splenocytes to PHA and Con-A decreased significantly from the early stage of the tumor. However, the mixed lymphocyte-tumor cell reaction increased significantly from day 14 to day 28. The survival rate of the mice, which had undergone simultaneous splenectomy and liver tumor transplantation, was significantly lower than that of sham-operated control mice. The number of pulmonary metastases in splenectomized mice was significantly greater than in the control mice. There was, however, no difference between the two groups in the weight of the liver tumor. By contrast, splenectomies performed 14 days before or 14 days after tumor transplantation had no significant influence on the survival of the mice. Splenectomies performed on day 0 and on day 3 after tumor transplantation significantly increased the number of pulmonary metastases. Furthermore, the intravenous injection of anti-asialo GM1 antisera on day 0 and day 3 significantly increased the number of pulmonary metastases, but injection of anti-Thy 1.2 antisera had no effect. These results suggest that splenic NK cells may play an important role in the suppression of pulmonary metastasis at early stages of the liver tumor. 
Serum endorphin levels in injured children. Plasma beta-endorphin levels (PBEL) are known to be elevated in acutely injured adults, but this has not been studied in pediatric patients with trauma. We measured PBEL in 46 children who sustained blunt injury. The mean acute PBEL was significantly elevated compared with the mean convalescent PBEL (40.5 +/- 29.0 versus 5.4 +/- 2.1 picomoles per liter, p less than 0.05). PBEL were highest in patients with multiple injuries (60.5 +/- 33.2 picomoles per liter, n = 16). PBEL were also elevated with isolated injuries of the head, face or limbs, and even with less severe injuries, namely multiple abrasions. PBEL were low in patients with abdominal (two patients) or spinal (two patients) injuries. Convalescent PBEL were consistently low. Severely injured patients (Injury Severity Score [ISS] of more than ten) had significantly elevated PBEL compared with patients with minor injuries (ISS less than 10), but some children with low ISS had elevated PBEL. The presence of head injury did not influence PBEL and there was no correlation between PBEL and systolic blood pressure. We have demonstrated that the PBEL is elevated in pediatric patients with trauma. 
Behavioral complications of drug treatment of Parkinson's disease. A variety of neuropharmacologic agents, including anticholinergic drugs, amantadine hydrochloride, levodopa, selegiline, bromocriptine, and pergolide, are now available for the treatment of Parkinson's disease. Of patients treated with dopaminergic agents, 30% develop visual hallucinations, 10% exhibit delusions, 10% have euphoria, 1% have mania, 10% to 15% experience increased anxiety, 15% have confusional periods, and a few exhibit altered sexual behavior. Anticholinergic drugs have a greater tendency to produce confusional states than dopaminergic compounds. Elderly patients and those with underlying dementia are most likely to have untoward side effects with anti-parkinsonism treatment. Dosage reduction is the optimum management strategy, although anti-psychotic agents may be necessary in patients with delusions, and lithium may help control drug-induced mania. Dopaminergic agents share the property of stimulation of D2 dopamine receptors, and this action may play an essential role in mediating their neuropsychiatric effects. 
Predicting radioresistance in early glottic squamous cell carcinoma by DNA content. Nuclear DNA content has been implicated as a prognostic factor in an increasing number of tumor types. Current data on the role of DNA content in head and neck carcinoma are conflicting and incomplete. To evaluate the role of DNA content in predicting radioresistance, 29 patients with T1N0M0 squamous cell carcinoma of the glottic larynx who had undergone uniform curative radiotherapy and whose clinical outcome was known had flow cytometric analysis for DNA content performed on their tumors with paraffin-embedded archival tissues. Five aneuploid lesions and 24 diploid lesions were identified. All aneuploid lesions occurred in radioresistant tumors. The probability of an aneuploid tumor failing radiotherapy was highly significant at p = .016. No DNA discordance was found in a sampling of half of the radioresistant lesions' pretreatment and recurrent specimens, for a 100% predictive value of moderate statistical power. On the basis of these findings, patients with aneuploid T1 glottic lesions should be referred for primary surgical therapy. 
Evaluation and management of patients with both peripheral vascular and coronary artery disease. The prevalence of serious angiographic coronary artery disease ranges from 37% to 78% in patients undergoing operation for peripheral vascular disease. Clinical studies have demonstrated that cardiac outcome after peripheral vascular surgery is not adequately predicted by the standard criteria of history, physical findings and rest electrocardiogram. An adequate exercise work load, left ventricular function and thallium redistribution have proved important in perioperative risk stratification. The choice of a perioperative functional cardiac test depends on patient-related factors and the nature of the peripheral vascular operation. Although procedures involving aortic cross-clamping exert a greater hemodynamic stress than do carotid endarterectomy and femoral popliteal surgery, late cardiac morbidity and mortality are significant in all patients with atherosclerotic disease. The decision to proceed with preoperative coronary angiography and myocardial revascularization should be based primarily on indications independent of the peripheral vascular procedure. However, peripheral vascular surgery may influence the timing of myocardial revascularization. Patients with high risk or unstable coronary artery disease may benefit from preoperative coronary revascularization, although this hypothesis remains unproved. In all patients, careful monitoring during and after operation is essential. All patients with peripheral vascular disease should be considered to be at lifelong risk for fatal and nonfatal cardiac events and should undergo appropriate clinical and laboratory evaluation and be treated accordingly. 
Vulvar squamous cell carcinoma and papillomaviruses: two separate entities? Vulvar squamous precancers (vulvar intraepithelial neoplasia) are associated with sexual factors, cigarette smoking, and human papillomaviruses. However, epidemiologic studies of invasive carcinoma of the vulva have produced conflicting evidence for these associations, in part because of a strong association with vulvar inflammatory disease (dystrophies) in older women. We analyzed a series of 42 vulvar invasive carcinomas for papillomavirus nucleic acids by deoxyribonucleic acid-deoxyribonucleic acid in situ hybridization and correlated their presence with age, smoking history, and morphologic type. The carcinomas were divided into well-differentiated, moderately and poorly differentiated, and intraepithelial-like growth patterns, the latter composed of nests of invasive neoplastic epithelium with preserved cell polarity, similar to intraepithelial disease. Of the lesions studied, 28% were human papillomavirus deoxyribonucleic acid-positive. Intraepithelial-like neoplasms segregated in women with a younger mean age (64 versus 73 years) than that of women with conventional squamous cell carcinoma and they more frequently had a history of cigarette smoking (88% versus 28%). Moreover, intraepithelial-like lesions contained human papillomavirus nucleic acids more frequently (67% versus 13%) when analyzed by in situ hybridization. These observations confirm the diverse nature of vulvar squamous cell carcinoma and may explain in part why conflicting results are obtained from studies investigating the role of sexual and viral factors in the genesis of vulvar cancer. They suggest that many invasive vulvar cancers may not be linked to papillomaviruses. 
Is there a premorbid personality typical for Parkinson's disease? For decades clinicians have postulated a characteristic preexisting personality in patients who develop Parkinson's disease (PD). They are described as moralistic, law-abiding, conscientious, and averse to risk-taking. The limited personality surveys tend to be confirmatory, but most of the literature is anecdotal or replete with unprovable psychodynamic postulates. In addition to an apparent stability of marriages and lack of alcoholism, patients with PD are less likely than controls to be smokers. It has been suggested that nicotine and its byproducts are not actually protective against PD, and it could be postulated that higher-than-average intrinsic dopamine may facilitate addiction. Smoking for the patient who is later to develop PD may be particularly unrewarding. In addition, the postulated personality for PD may predispose to hard work, perspiration, and increased exposure to putative trace elements in the water supply. 
Paralysis of the trapezius: a case report. A patient was referred to physical therapy for exercises to the right shoulder secondary to a peripheral nerve injury involving the spinal accessory nerve. A treatment program was designed to accommodate for lack of upward scapula rotation, which is necessary for elevation of the upper extremity above shoulder level. During the course of two and a half years of care, a variety of associated problems were encountered. There was no apparent nerve regeneration, and the patient was left with limited mobility of the affected upper extremity. 
Randomised, controlled trial of effectiveness of ampicillin in mild acute respiratory infections in Indonesian children. The recommended treatment for mild acute respiratory infections (ARI) in children is supportive care only, but many physicians, especially in developing countries, continue to prescribe antibiotic treatment because they believe it prevents progression to more severe ARI. To find out whether ampicillin treatment conferred any benefit over supportive care alone, a randomised, controlled trial was carried out among 889 children (under 5 years) with mild ARI in Indonesia. 447 were randomly allocated ampicillin (25-30 mg/kg body weight three times daily for 5 days) plus supportive care (continued breastfeeding, clearing of the nose, and paracetamol to control fever); 442 were allocated supportive care only. The treatment groups were almost identical after randomisation in terms of age, sex, level of parental education, history of measles immunisation, and fever. After 1 week the percentages cured were nearly identical (204 [46%] ampicillin; 209 [47%] control), as were the percentages of cases progressing to moderate ARI (56 [13%] vs 53 [12%]). The effect of treatment was not modified by age, sex, measles immunisation status, or the educational level of the parents. At the 2-week follow-up, the percentages cured were 62% (277) in the ampicillin group and 58% (256) in the control group; 14% of both groups had progressed to moderate ARI; and 24% (107) and 28% (123), respectively, still had mild ARI. None of the differences in outcome between the ampicillin and control groups was statistically significant. Thus, ampicillin plus supportive care offers no benefit over supportive care alone for treatment of mild ARI in young Indonesian children. 
Prevention of gram-positive infections after bone marrow transplantation by systemic vancomycin: a prospective, randomized trial. Gram-positive bacteria are the most commonly isolated organisms after bone marrow transplantation (BMT) and severe streptococcus septicemia has been reported. In order to evaluate the benefit of a gram-positive prophylaxis after BMT, we conducted a prospective, randomized trial of systemic vancomycin among 60 patients undergoing BMT for hematologic malignancies. Patients were randomized to receive (n = 30) or not receive (n = 30) prophylactic vancomycin 15 mg/kg every 12 hours from day -2 until resolution of neutropenia or until the first episode of fever. All patients were treated in laminar air-flow rooms, received sterile diet, total gut decontamination, and had central venous catheters placed surgically. Vancomycin was found to be highly effective in preventing gram-positive infections that occurred in 11 of 30 patients in the control group versus zero of 30 in the vancomycin group (P less than .002). All gram-positive infections occurring in the control group were symptomatic (nine septicemia and two local infections), and one patient with Streptococcus septicemia died with pneumonia. Thus, gram-positive prophylaxis was found to decrease infection morbidity after BMT. Moreover, the number of days with fever (P less than .001), and empiric antibiotic therapy (P less than .01) was reduced without added toxicity or cost. This study confirmed the high prevalence of gram-positive infections after BMT and emphasized the clinical benefits of an adapted prophylaxis. 
Aphthoid ulceration of the colon in strongyloidiasis. In humans, infestation with Strongyloides stercoralis most commonly involves the upper small intestine. We describe a 65-yr-old woman who presented with abdominal pain, weight loss, and hypoalbuminemia, and was found at colonoscopy to have patchy erythema with aphthoid ulcers scattered throughout the large intestine proximal to the splenic flexure. Biopsy of involved areas and examination of the colonic effluent revealed S. stercoralis larvae. Previous reports of colonic involvement with this nematode, and the differential diagnosis of aphthoid ulcers, a newly described lesion associated with S. stercoralis infestation, are discussed. 
Metastatic carcinoma in the neck: a clinical, radiological, scintigraphic and pathological study. This study was undertaken to compare clinical evaluation of the neck with 99mTc(v) DMSA planar scintigraphy and computerized tomography (CT) in patients with head and neck carcinoma. Twenty-six patients were studied and in all but one the neck was previously untreated. A total of 31 neck dissections were performed and the specimens examined histopathologically. CT was approximately as accurate (71%) as clinical examination (68%) and more accurate than 99mTc(v) DMSA planar scintigraphy (48%) in predicting which necks contained metastatic carcinoma. Overall, 13% of necks had their staging correctly changed by 99mTc(v) DMSA scintigraphy compared with 10% for CT. Although scintigraphy upstaged 13% of clinically N0 necks compared to 6% for CT, it was less sensitive and specific than either clinical examination or CT. 99mTc(v) DMSA planar scintigraphy has no role to play in the investigation of patients with metastatic carcinoma to include the clinically N0 neck. 
Coronary-subclavian steal corrected with percutaneous transluminal angioplasty. We describe a case of coronary-subclavian steal syndrome treated with percutaneous transluminal angioplasty. A 58-year-old female who had her first coronary bypass operation 6 years previously and a second operation 3 years previously involving the left internal mammary artery and right gastroepiploic artery, developed unusual angina on effort characterized by left precordial pain, pain in the left shoulder and arm, tinnitus and dizziness. Angiography revealed retrograde flow to the left subclavian artery via the left vertebral artery and left internal mammary artery. Severe stenosis of the left subclavian artery was demonstrated at its ostium. Restoration of antegrade flow to the vertebral artery and left internal mammary artery by transluminal angioplasty resulted in complete resolution of these symptoms. 
Effects of lower limb unloading on skeletal muscle mass and function in humans. A model to simulate effects of microgravity on skeletal muscle mass and function in humans has been developed. Unilateral lower limb unloading that allowed ankle, knee, and hip joint mobility was conducted in six healthy men by suspending one lower limb and having the subjects walk on crutches. They performed maximal unilateral concentric or eccentric quadriceps actions at different angular velocities before and after 4 wk of suspension and after 4 days and after 7 wk of uncontrolled recovery. Peak torque (PT) and angle-specific torque (AST) were measured. Muscle cross-sectional area (CSA) and radiological density (RD) of the thigh were assessed by means of computerized tomography. Concentric and eccentric PT and AST across speeds decreased (P less than 0.05) by 22 and 16%, respectively, in response to unloading. At 4 days of recovery PT (-11%) and AST (-7%) were still lower (P less than 0.05) than before. Muscle CSA and RD decreased (P less than 0.05) by 7 and 6%, respectively. After 7 wk of recovery PT, AST, CSA, and RD had returned to normal. The control limb showed no changes over the experimental period except for a 6% decrease (P less than 0.05) in RD. It is suggested that this human model of unloading could serve to simulate effects of microgravity on skeletal muscle mass and function because reductions in muscle mass and strength were of similar magnitude to those produced by bed rest. 
Serum antibodies against respiratory tract viruses in episodes of acute otitis media. Although the findings of epidemiological studies have suggested viral respiratory tract infection (RTI) to be crucially involved in the development of acute otitis media (AOM), the relationship between AOM and viral RTI remains unclear. Serum samples, obtained in the acute and convalescent phases of 57 AOM episodes (in 35 children during the first three years of life) were analysed for IgG antibodies against influenza A viruses, influenza B viruses, parainfluenza virus type 1, respiratory syncytial virus and adenoviruses. One third of the AOM episodes (18/57) could be related to viral RTI, as evidenced by significant increases in viral serum antibody activity. Treatment failure occurred in four AOM episodes where increases in serum viral antibody activity were noted. In three of these failures, antibiotic treatment was unsuccessful despite the bacterial strains not being resistant to the drug used. This suggests that concomitant viral infection may be a determinant of treatment outcome in some AOM episodes. 
Pelvic abscesses: CT-guided transrectal drainage. Percutaneous drainage of pelvic abscesses has been performed by using a number of approaches, including transabdominal, transgluteal, and transrectal. The authors present a technique for the drainage of pelvic abscesses by a transrectal route with use of computed tomographic (CT) guidance. Equipment for the technique included a plastic introducer tube, standard needle, angiographic guide wire, and pigtail catheters. The pelvic abscesses of 10 patients (six after appendectomy, three after colon resection, one secondary to diverticulitis) were successfully drained by using the new technique. No complications or recurrences were experienced. After initial catheter placement, patients were treated with use of gravity drainage and appropriate antibiotics. Success of drainage was determined with sequential CT scans. Compared with the transgluteal approach, the transrectal approach offered increased patient comfort and minimal risk of potential complications such as injury to the sciatic nerve or tracking of the abscess. Use of the plastic introducer tube promoted operator safety by protecting the guiding finger. On the basis of this initial series, CT-guided transrectal drainage appears to be an effective and well-tolerated method for the drainage of pelvic abscesses. 
Frequent hypoxemia and apnea after sedation with midazolam and fentanyl. More than 80 deaths have occurred after the use of midazolam (Versed), often in combination with opioids, to sedate patients undergoing various medical and surgical procedures. We investigated the respiratory effects of midazolam (0.05 mg.kg-1) and fentanyl (2.0 micrograms.kg-1) in volunteers. The incidence of hypoxemia (oxyhemoglobin saturation less than 90%) and apnea (no spontaneous respiratory effort for 15 s) and the ventilatory response to carbon dioxide were evaluated. Midazolam alone produced no significant respiratory effects. Fentanyl alone produced hypoxemia in half of the subjects and significant depression of the ventilatory response to CO2, but did not produce apnea. Midazolam and fentanyl in combination significantly increased the incidence of hypoxemia (11 of 12 subjects) and apnea (6 of 12 subjects), but did not depress the ventilatory response to CO2 more than did fentanyl alone. Adverse reactions linked to midazolam and reported to the Department of Health and Human Services highlight apnea- and hypoxia-related problems as among the most frequent adverse reactions. Seventy-eight per cent of the deaths associated with midazolam were respiratory in nature, and in 57% an opioid had also been administered. All but three of the deaths associated with the use of midazolam occurred in patients unattended by anesthesia personnel. We conclude that combining midazolam with fentanyl or other opioids produces a potent drug interaction that places patients at a high risk for hypoxemia and apnea. Adequate precautions, including monitoring of patient oxygenation with pulse oximetry, the administration of supplemental oxygen, and the availability of persons skilled in airway management are recommended when benzodiazepines are administered in combination with opioids. 
Induction of sustained patency after clot-selective coronary thrombolysis with Hybrid-B, a genetically engineered plasminogen activator with a prolonged biological half-life. BACKGROUND. Despite the utility of tissue-type plasminogen activator (t-PA) in eliciting coronary thrombolysis clinically, early reocclusion remains a problem, occurring despite anticoagulation in 5-30% of patients with initially successful recanalization. This study evaluated the utility of Hybrid-B, a molecular variant of t-PA with a prolonged half-life in the circulation, in eliciting coronary thrombolysis and maintaining patency in the presence of a continuing thrombogenic stimulus. METHODS AND RESULTS. In intact, anesthetized dogs, either 18 mg Hybrid-B over 30 minutes (n = 15) or 50 mg t-PA (Activase) over 60 minutes (n = 8) was administered starting 60 minutes after left anterior descending coronary artery occlusion was induced with a thrombogenic copper coil. Time to lysis averaged 54 +/- 26 (means +/- SD) minutes and 64 +/- 34 minutes with Hybrid-B and t-PA, respectively (p = NS). When Hybrid-B was administered as a bolus (20 mg over 1 minute) to induce a high initial concentration in blood, time to lysis was shortened markedly and averaged 15 +/- 5 minutes. Dogs given Hybrid-B by either infusion or bolus exhibited prolonged time to reocclusion (337 +/- 192 minutes compared with 192 +/- 125 minutes in dogs given t-PA, p less than 0.03), reflecting maintenance of a subthrombolytic but persistently active concentration of activator in blood. Despite the persistence of Hybrid-B in blood, concentrations of fibrinogen and alpha 2-antiplasmin were not depleted markedly and remained at 77 +/- 25 and 56 +/- 24%, respectively, of control values. CONCLUSIONS. Thus, Hybrid-B, a novel variant of t-PA with unique pharmacokinetic properties, elicits prompt, sustained, and clot-selective coronary thrombolysis. 
Recommendations for collection of laboratory specimens associated with outbreaks of gastroenteritis. Recent discoveries have implicated a number of "new" (i.e., previously unrecognized) infectious agents as important causes of outbreaks of gastroenteritis. Unfortunately, the ability to detect these agents in an outbreak can be limited by two factors: 1) the lack of appropriate assays-many of which are still in developmental stages and are not readily available to clinical laboratories, and 2) inadequately or improperly collected specimens. At CDC, many newly developed assays are being used for research and for outbreak investigations. The information in this report is especially intended for public health agencies that collaborate with CDC in investigating outbreaks of gastroenteritis. The report provides an update on guidelines and recommendations for the proper collection of specimens to be sent to CDC, gives general background information concerning some recently discovered pathogens, lists some of the tests available at CDC, and provides a list of CDC contacts. The guidelines and the general information provided on causes of outbreaks of gastroenteritis can be also used by public health workers for investigations when specific testing is available and appropriate. 
Root of the superior mesenteric artery in pancreatitis and pancreatic carcinoma: evaluation with CT To determine if changes involving the root of the superior mesenteric artery are specific for neoplasm, the authors retrospectively reviewed 173 computed tomographic (CT) examinations of patients with proved pancreatitis (103 examinations) and pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (70 examinations). Streaky infiltration of the fat surrounding the root was seen in 27 of 56 examinations of acute pancreatitis, in four of 24 examinations of chronic pancreatitis, in 12 of 23 examinations of pancreatitis complicated by abscess, and in 25 of 70 examinations of pancreatic carcinoma. Periarterial lymph nodes were visible in 14 with acute pancreatitis, in three with chronic pancreatitis, in six with pancreatic abscess, and in 11 with pancreatic carcinoma. A focal mass extended to within 1 cm of the root in 10 with acute pancreatitis, in two with chronic pancreatitis, in four with pancreatic abscess, and in 24 with pancreatic carcinoma; the mass obliterated the periarterial fat in seven with acute pancreatitis, in one with pancreatic abscess, and in 18 with pancreatic carcinoma. Circumferential encasement occurred in one with chronic pancreatitis, in four with pancreatic abscess, in 14 with pancreatic carcinoma, and in none with acute pancreatitis; nearly all cases of encasement revealed loss of periarterial fat. Thus, these indicators are not specific for neoplasm. 
The IgE and IgG subclass antibody response to foods in babies during the first year of life and their relationship to feeding regimen and the development of food allergy. This follow-up study of 191 babies investigated the development of food allergy in an unselected population and its relationship to total and antigen-specific IgE and IgG subclass levels. Sensitization to egg, as indicated by a positive skin test or RAST, was found in 5% of 1-year-old babies, but none of the babies in this series fulfilled the clinical criteria for immediate-type milk allergy. For both bovine casein (CAS) and egg albumin, the IgG response was largely restricted to IgG1 in contrast to the predominant IgG4 response to these antigens that is found in adults. The level of IgG4, but not IgG1, antibody to CAS and ovalbumin (OV) was lower in some of the babies compared with that of their mothers (N = 166; p less than 0.05, Student's paired t test). However, there was no difference in the total serum IgG subclass levels between mothers and babies. These results demonstrate that, in the population of babies studied, (1) type I hypersensitivity to egg occurred in 5% of 1-year-old babies, (2) the predominant IgG subclass of antibodies to CAS and OV in babies is IgG1, and (3) in the 22% of babies, there was substantially (greater than 1000-fold) less IgG4 antibody to CAS and OV than in their mothers, suggesting specific exclusion of some IgG4 antibodies. 
Comparison of coronary and myocardial morphologic findings in patients with and without thrombolytic therapy during fatal first acute myocardial infarction. The TIMI Investigators. The hearts of 61 patients (39 men aged 64 +/- 11 years) who died from 5 hours to 42 days (median 3 days) after a fatal first acute myocardial infarction without having undergone percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty or coronary bypass surgery were studied to compare clinical and cardiac morphologic features of patients receiving thrombolytic therapy with tissue-plasminogen activator (t-PA) to those not receiving thrombolytic therapy. Comparison of findings in the 23 patients who received t-PA intravenously 3 +/- 1 hours after onset of symptoms, with the 38 patients who did not, showed similar baseline characteristics with respect to: age, gender, history of hypertension; location of the infarct; heart weight; severity and numbers of coronary arteries narrowed; and frequencies of plaque rupture, plaque hemorrhage and coronary thrombi. Among the patients receiving t-PA, however, there was a greater frequency of platelet-rich (fibrin-poor) thrombi in the infarct-related coronary arteries (6 of 11 vs 4 of 25 thrombi; p = 0.02), more nonocclusive than occlusive thrombi (6 of 11 vs 4 of 25 thrombi; p = 0.02), and a lower frequency of myocardial rupture (left ventricular free wall or ventricular septum) (5 of 23 [22%] vs 18 of 38 [46%]; p = 0.045). 
Successful management of CMV pneumonia in a mechanically ventilated patient. We report a case of severe respiratory failure due to cytomegalovirus pneumonitis in a patient who underwent an allogeneic bone marrow transplant, who was successfully treated with the combination of ganciclovir and high-dose intravenous immune globulin. We also reviewed the rationale for the use of combination therapy with an antiviral agent and immunotherapy. Because of the bone marrow toxicity of ganciclovir, an aggressive diagnostic approach, including bronchoalveolar lavage and open lung biopsy, may be necessary to establish a definitive diagnosis prior to institution of therapy. 
Are concomitant surgical procedures acceptable in patients undergoing cervical exploration for primary hyperparathyroidism? Cervical exploration for primary hyperparathyroidism is an extremely safe procedure with essentially no operative mortality or morbidity and with success rates approaching 98%. These results have encouraged experienced surgeons to perform other surgical procedures concomitantly with cervical exploration with use of the same general anesthetic agent. This retrospective study was performed to assess the safety and efficacy of this practice. At our institution, 117 patients underwent cervical exploration for primary hyperparathyroidism in combination with an additional surgical procedure, including breast (25), biliary (21), gynecologic (19), intra-abdominal (18), and cardiothoracic (6) operations. The mean operative time was 155 minutes, and the mean duration of hospitalization was 7.6 days. Postoperatively, 115 patients (98%) were normocalcemic. Nine complications (mostly minor), which occurred in eight patients, related primarily to the concomitant surgical procedure. No operative mortality occurred. If performed by experienced surgeons in carefully selected patients, cervical exploration for primary hyperparathyroidism in combination with another elective operation is safe and cost-effective. 
Needle aspiration of extrathoracic metastases from bronchogenic carcinoma. Five patients with suspected metastatic bronchogenic carcinoma underwent needle aspiration of peripheral metastatic lesions instead of a diagnostic bronchoscopy. Aspirates were from the soft tissue of the proximal arm (three patients), an axillary mass (one patient), and a skin nodule (one patient). Two patients had non-small cell carcinoma, two had small cell carcinoma, and one patient had a nondiagnostic aspirate. The procedure had insignificant morbidity, was easy to perform, quickly established a diagnosis of metastatic disease, and obviated the need for a more invasive diagnostic procedure in four of the five patients. 
Reflex sympathetic dystrophy syndrome secondary to L5 radiculopathy. A 47-year-old woman developed radiating right lower extremity pain with weakness in the L5 myotomes. A CT scan, subsequent myelogram, and postmyelogram CT scan were reported as negative. Two months of bed rest diminished the radiating symptoms, but the weakness persisted. Three months post onset a severe burning dysesthesia developed in the right foot, and the patient became unable to bear weight on that extremity. Physical examination revealed 4-/5 weakness of the ankle dorsiflexors, foot evertors, toe extensors, and hip abductors. The entire right foot was swollen and had a red, mottled discoloration. An EMG was equivocal, and a three-phase bone scan was positive in the right foot in all three phases, which is characteristic of reflex sympathetic dystrophy. A repeat CT scan and review of the earlier scans revealed a high lateral disc fragment at the exit foramina of the L5 nerve root. Upon laminectomy, a free disc fragment at the exit foramina was removed, and the patient's symptoms resolved completely. Reflex sympathetic dystrophy syndrome is very rarely reported in association with lumbar radiculopathy. This case emphasizes the need to carefully evaluate the far lateral exit foramina on CT scan in patients with symptoms of radiculopathy. Myelogram is characteristically normal in these cases. 
Safety and efficacy of percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty in patients with left ventricular dysfunction. The risks and long-term outcome after 845 elective percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasties (PTCA) in patients with left ventricular (LV) dysfunction (ejection fraction less than or equal to 40%) were examined. Procedural results were compared with 8,117 consecutive procedures in patients with ejection fractions greater than 40%. The patients with LV dysfunction were older (63 vs 60 years, p less than 0.01), had a greater incidence of prior myocardial infarction (84 vs 45%, p less than 0.001), prior bypass surgery (39 vs 21%, p less than 0.001), 3-vessel disease (62 vs 33%, p less than 0.001), and class IV angina (48 vs 41%, p less than 0.01) than the control group. Angiographic success was lower (93 vs 95%, p less than 0.01), and overall procedural mortality was increased ( 4 vs 1%, p less than 0.001) in the study group. Emergency surgery rates were identical (2%). No significant difference was found in rates of nonfatal Q-wave myocardial infarction (2 vs 1%). At mean follow-up of 33.5 months, 15% of the patients with LV dysfunction required late bypass surgery, 27% underwent repeat PTCA, and 59% were angina free. Actuarial survival at 1 and 4 years was 87 and 69%, respectively. Cox regression analysis identified 3-vessel disease, age greater than or equal to 70 years, class IV angina and incomplete revascularization as correlates of long-term mortality. These data suggest that PTCA may be an effective treatment for coronary artery disease in patients with LV dysfunction. 
Immunocytochemical localization of phospholipase C-gamma in rat embryo fibroblasts. Rat embryo fibroblasts (REF52) exhibit a distinctive, transformation-sensitive distribution of alpha-protein kinase C (alpha-PKC). Receptor-mediated activation of phospholipase C (PLC)-gamma generates diacylglycerol, the major cellular activator of PKC. Immunofluorescence techniques were used to investigate the subcellular localization of two PLC isozymes (PLC-gamma and PLC-delta) in normal and simian virus 40-transformed REF52 cells to determine (i) if PLC colocalizes with alpha-PKC and (ii) if PLC isozyme distribution is sensitive to transformation. PLC-delta was not detected in either cell type. In REF52 cells, PLC-gamma was associated with the actin cytoskeleton and was evenly distributed along the length of the actin microfilaments. PLC-gamma was coincident with alpha-PKC at the points where the filaments are anchored to the membrane (i.e., the focal contacts). Cytoskeletal association of PLC-gamma was not transformation sensitive, although the actin cytoskeleton was more disordered in simian virus 40-transformed cells. In REF52 cells, platelet-derived growth factor induced tyrosine phosphorylation of both soluble and cytoskeletal PLC-gamma. Tyrosine phosphorylation of PLC-gamma did not seem to be a determinant of its subcellular localization, but there was a detectable increase in cytoskeleton-associated PLC-gamma in response to platelet-derived growth factor treatment. 
Massive ossifying fibroma of the temporal bone. Ossifying fibromata are rare lesions of the temporal bone. Because the tumors tend to progress and can become clinically massive, early complete resection is advised whenever feasible to prevent clinically evident recurrences and potentially life-threatening complications. 
A simple technique for closure of a palatal fistula using a conchal cartilage graft. A simple technique for closure of a palatal fistula using a conchal cartilage graft as a substitute for nasal lining flaps is reported. This graft simplifies the repair of the palatal fistula and protects the suture line of the oral covering flaps from recurrence. 
Prospective evaluation of maternal serum human chorionic gonadotropin levels in 3428 pregnancies. As part of a multicenter prospective study, second-trimester human chorionic gonadotropin and alpha-fetoprotein concentrations were evaluated. Data included maternal age, human chorionic gonadotropin level, alpha-fetoprotein level, weight, race, and pregnancy outcome of 3428 pregnancies at between 15 and 20 weeks' gestation. The results of the study indicate that human chorionic gonadotropin levels decrease as maternal weight increases, that weight-adjusted human chorionic gonadotropin levels for Oriental and black women are higher than for white or Hispanic women, and that twin pregnancies have higher human chorionic gonadotropin levels than singleton pregnancies. Of 255 pregnancies that did not have normal outcomes, 54 (21.2%) had human chorionic gonadotropin levels greater than 2.0 multiples of the median and 26 (10.2%) had alpha-fetoprotein levels greater than 2.5 multiples of the median. Of 11 pregnancies with fetal aneuploidy, 6 (54.5%) had human chorionic gonadotropin levels greater than 2.0 multiples of the median. It is concluded that in human chorionic gonadotropin screening programs for fetal Down syndrome, weight and race adjustments are necessary for accurate risk assessment. 
Single motor end-plates in myasthenia gravis and LEMS at different firing rates. The jitter and frequency of blocking was studied at single motor end-plates in 10 patients with myasthenia gravis (MG) and in a patient with Lambert-Eaton myasthenic syndrome (LEMS), using single fiber EMG (SFEMG) with axonal microstimulation at rates varying from 0.5 Hz to 20 Hz. While some myasthenic motor end-plates showed lowest degrees of transmission disturbance at the lowest rates and most pronounced abnormality at the highest rates of stimulation, over one-half were most abnormal at intermediate rates and improved at higher rates. In 1 patient, all end-plates behaved in this way. On the other hand, all end-plates in the LEMS patient showed the expected improvement of the abnormal jitter and blocking on increasing the stimulation rate. It is argued that improvement of jitter and blocking at higher rates, unless dramatic, does not necessarily suggest a presynaptic abnormality. 
Fever: management and self-medication. Results from a Norwegian population study. A representative sample of the Norwegian population was interviewed in 1988 as part of a monthly national opinion poll to investigate lay management and self-medication of fever. Six hundred and nineteen women and 592 men over the age of 15 were interviewed in their homes. Approximately one-fifth reported inappropriate measuring of body temperature. A variety of management and self-medication was found. In cases of common cold or influenza with fever, 35% would use antipyretics. Forty per cent would start to use antipyretics at a temperature below 39.0 degrees C. Forty-four per cent did not know any antipyretic brand names at all. The results indicate a need for more definite and consistent information to make fever management and self-medication more rational. Such information should be discussed and given by general practitioners, nurses at child welfare centers and pharmacists. 
Microscopic hematuria and calculus-related ureteral obstruction. The evaluation of patients with ureteral calculi in the emergency department has historically included urinalysis (UA) and intravenous pyelograms (IVP). This retrospective study was done to determine if a statistically significant relationship existed between the degree of calculus-related ureteral obstruction, proven by IVP, and the presence or absence of microscopic hematuria. Urine red blood cells were recorded as less than 3 rbc/hpf (negative) or greater than or equal to 3 rbc/hpf (positive). IVPs were recorded as nonsevere or severe. IVP criteria were based on the presence or absence of extravasation, greater than 2-hour ureteral filling times, and a numerical scoring system of 1 to 4 for ureteral or calyceal dilatation and nephrogenic effect. Eighty-nine men (72%) had non-severe obstructions and 34 (28%) had severe obstructions. Twenty-five women (68%) had nonsevere obstructions and 12 (32%) had severe obstructions. Of the 28 patients with normal UAs, 11 had severe ureteral obstructions and 17 had nonsevere ureteral obstructions. There were no statistically significant differences between the presence or absence of significant microscopic hematuria and the presence or absence of severe ureteral obstruction. Microscopic hematuria is neither sensitive nor specific in determining the degree of calculus-related ureteral obstruction. 
Prolonged QT interval and risk of sudden death in South-East Asian men. Sudden death in sleep occurs in substantial numbers among young men in South-East Asia. The frequencies of electrocardiographic abnormalities were measured in groups with varying risks of such sudden death. The mean heart-rate-corrected QT interval (QTc) was significantly (p less than 0.05) greater among 123 Laotian refugees in Thailand at high risk (405 [95% confidence interval 397-413] ms) than in 77 Laotian refugees in the United States at lower risk (364 [359-369] ms) and 199 non-Asian US residents at negligible risk (358 [354-362] ms). Among refugees in Thailand, prolonged QTc interval was associated with poor thiamine status and a history of seizure-like episodes in sleep. Thiamine deficiency may be a cause of prolonged QT interval and sudden death in this region. 
Antepartum testing in the hypertensive patient: when to begin. Antepartum testing has been recommended for patients whose pregnancies are complicated by hypertension. Although this is considered accepted practice, there are little data available to help the clinician know when to start testing. To help answer this question in patients with chronic hypertension and nonproteinuric pregnancy-induced hypertension, we reviewed the results of all antepartum tests between 1976 and 1987 in patients with these diagnoses. The primary mode of surveillance in the majority of our patients was the contraction stress test. We determined when patients first had positive contraction stress test results and when intervention occurred because of an abnormal antepartum test result. There were a total of 917 patients tested with these diagnoses. Fifty-three (5.8%) of these patients had at least one positive contraction stress test result. Twenty-two patients were delivered of infants before 35 weeks' gestation because of abnormal antepartum test results. Those with early intervention (less than 35 weeks' gestation) could not be differentiated from those with later intervention (greater than or equal to 35 weeks' gestation) by maternal age, diastolic blood pressure, or systolic blood pressure at the time of testing. The majority of patients who were delivered of infants before 35 weeks' gestation had a concomitant diagnosis of systemic lupus erythematosus, intrauterine growth retardation, diabetes mellitus, or superimposed preeclampsia. On the basis of when compromise was evident, patients with these diagnoses may require testing to be started as early as the fetus is considered viable. However, in those without these diagnoses, the clinician may delay the beginning of testing until 33 weeks' gestation without significant risk of pregnancy loss before testing. 
Epithelial downgrowth following the removal of iris inclusion cysts. We present three patients in whom epithelial downgrowth occurred following the excision of iris inclusion cysts. The sheet-like downgrowth was aggressively treated and successfully eradicated in two of the three patients. Early identification and prompt therapy are essential. 
Clinical syndromes and differential diagnosis of spinal disorders. In this article an overview of the different clinical aspects of spinal syndromes is presented. The common disorders involving the spinal cord, the spine, and the intervertebral disc are emphasized. 
Rectosigmoid varices and other mucosal changes in patients with portal hypertension. A prospective study was performed to evaluate the prevalence of anorectal varices and their clinical significance as well as to study other proctosigmoidoscopic changes in 75 patients with portal hypertension of diverse etiology. Sixty-seven patients (89.3%) had lower gastrointestinal varices with no significant difference (p greater than 0.05) in prevalence between cirrhosis (92.1%), noncirrhotic portal fibrosis (87%), and extrahepatic portal venous obstruction (85.7%). The rectum was the most common site of lower gastrointestinal varices. External anal and sigmoid colonic varices almost always occurred in the presence of rectal and/or internal anal varices. There was no correlation between the presence of rectosigmoid varices and the severity of esophagogastric mucosal changes or portal hypertension. There was no suggestion that esophageal variceal sclerotherapy influenced the presence of anorectal varices. Seven patients (9.3%) had recent hematochezia, including three patients in whom it occurred in the absence of any upper gastrointestinal hemorrhage. Varices were the cause of bleeding in at least five patients. An abnormal mucosal vascular pattern in the form of telangiectasias or spiders was seen, irrespective of etiology of portal hypertension, in nine patients (12%). Hemorrhoids were present in 31 patients (41.3%) with an age-related difference (p less than 0.05) between patients with cirrhosis (55.3%) and extrahepatic portal venous obstruction (21.4%). 
Gonadal vein thrombosis in patients with acute gastrointestinal inflammation: diagnosis with CT. During a 31-month period, evidence of gonadal vein thrombosis (GVT) was demonstrated by computed tomography (CT) in seven patients who had a broad spectrum of acute gastrointestinal inflammatory lesions, including diverticulitis, ulcerative colitis, Crohn disease, appendicitis with abscess, and perforated appendix with pseudomembranous colitis. All patients had lower abdominal pain, tenderness, fever, and leukocytosis. CT demonstrated thrombus through the length of the gonadal vein in each patient; the entire lumen of the vein was filled. No symptoms relating to GVT were present. GVT may resolve with treatment of the underlying enteric disease alone, and anticoagulant therapy may not be necessary. 
Diagnosis and management of retroperitoneal soft-tissue sarcoma. Retroperitoneal soft-tissue sarcomas are locally invasive tumors that remain occult for long periods and grow quite large due to the abdominal cavity's remarkable ability to accommodate these slowly expanding masses with a paucity of attendant symptoms. An open biopsy is required to establish diagnosis definitively. Despite improved imaging techniques and preoperative and intraoperative patient management, resectability has not changed significantly in the past 20 years. Even with an aggressive operative approach, only one half the tumors can be resected completely, and of those, more than 90% recur locally and result in the death of the patient. The addition of adjuvant radiotherapy or chemotherapy has not altered this pattern of local failure, in contrast to promising results with extremity soft-tissue sarcoma. Because of the rarity of these tumors, there is an urgent need to establish a national retroperitoneal sarcoma registry and to form cooperative intergroup studies to evaluate, treat, and apply innovative multimodality combination therapies to these otherwise lethal tumors. 
Absence of autoantibodies in primary fibromyalgia. Sera from patients with primary fibromyalgia (223 sera, 210 women; 13 men) were analyzed, by immunofluorescence microscopy, for the presence of antibodies directed against cell nuclei (ANA), smooth muscle, mitochondria and other tissue antigens present in cryostat sections of rat organs (liver, kidney and stomach). Sera from blood donors (255 sera, 75 women; 180 men) served as a comparative group. The occurrence of serum autoantibodies in patients with fibromyalgia did not differ significantly from the reference group. Our results differ from those of others, who have suggested a relation between fibromyalgia and inflammatory rheumatic diseases. 
Can decision analysis help in the management of giant hemangioma of the liver? [editorial] We explore the trade-off between the risk and expected benefits from resection of giant liver hemangioma (GLH), one larger than 4 cm in diameter. We searched the English-language literature for studies of the postoperative mortality after resection of GLH and of the outcome of expectantly treated patients. The results of the data synthesis showed an operative mortality of 1.5% (90% confidence intervals, 0.1-3.0%) and an early surgical morbidity of up to 13%. Mortality among the 37 reported cases with ruptured GLH was 78%. There were no cases of spontaneous or traumatic rupture of unresected GLH during a follow-up of a total of 282 patient years. The main source of ambiguity regarding the management of GLH is the uncertain risk of its rupture. Rough estimates of this risk based on published data suggest that surgical resection is not justified in asymptomatic GLH. Yet, although rare, rupture of GLH does occur with disastrous consequences. Future research may attempt to define patient subsets whose GLHs are at higher risk of rupture, and in whom preventive resection may improve survival. 
Isolation of a yeast artificial chromosome spanning the 8;21 translocation breakpoint t(8;21)(q22;q22.3) in acute myelogenous leukemia. The 8;21 translocation is one of the most common specific rearrangements in acute myelogenous leukemia. We have identified markers (D21S65 and a Not I boundary clone, Not-42, referred to as probe B) flanking the chromosome 21 translocation breakpoint (21q22.3) that demonstrate physical linkage in normal genomic DNA, by using at least three restriction endonucleases (Not I, Sac II, and BssHII), and that are located not more than 250-280 kilobases apart. Pulsed-field gel analysis of DNA from somatic cell hybrids containing the 8;21 translocation chromosomes demonstrates rearrangement of these markers. A 470-kilobase yeast artificial chromosome, YAC-Not-42, has been isolated that contains both probes. Mapping of lambda subclones constructed from YAC-Not-42 suggests that greater than 95% (25/26 probes tested) of the yeast artificial chromosome DNA is located on the proximal (D21S65) side of the breakpoint. In situ hybridization studies using metaphase chromosomes from five acute myelogenous leukemia patients with the 8;21 translocation confirmed these results and demonstrated the translocation of probe B to the derivative chromosome 8. A chromosome walk of approximately 39 kilobases from probe B has allowed identification of the breakpoint in DNA from a somatic cell hybrid containing the derivative chromosome 8. Since probe B contains conserved DNA sequences and is in close proximity to the translocation breakpoint, it may represent a portion of the involved gene on chromosome 21. 
Poliomyelitis-like paralysis during recovery from acute bronchial asthma: possible etiology and risk factors. A poliomyelitis-like paralytic disease during recovery from an attack of bronchial asthma is described in two young children. They presented at the age of 13 and 22 months, respectively, with acute flaccid paralysis of one or both lower limbs and preserved sensation. Cerebrospinal fluid examinations revealed mild protein elevation in both and pleocytosis in the second infant. Enteroviruses were isolated in a nasal swab and stools of the second patient. Acute onset of flaccid paralysis with absent motor action potential and normal sensory responses, detected by electrophysiologic studies, are highly suggestive of motor anterior horn cell disease in these infants. A multifactorial setup of immune suppression, stress, and neurotoxic drugs during an acute bronchial asthma attack triggered by a viral disease may render the patient vulnerable to viral invasion of the anterior horn cell with enteroviruses other than poliovirus. The overall experience of 22 patients with this serious complication is reviewed. 
Pericardio-peritoneal window for malignant pericardial effusion. Pericardio-peritoneostomy for malignant and non-hemorrhagic pericardial effusion is effective. This method relieves the patients of their symptoms and enables them to be discharged within 24 hours. 
Healing assessment of osseous defects of periapical lesions associated with failed endodontically treated teeth with use of freeze-dried bone allograft. Freeze-dried bone allograft (FDBA) has been used extensively in periodontal surgery and in the treatment of pocket osseous defects resulting from inflammatory periodontal disease. No other endodontic investigation has used this type of graft material in the treatment of bony resorptive defects of the periapical lesions associated with failed endodontic therapy. Therefore this study was conducted with the use of FDBA, to assess healing ability of osseous defects after removal of periapical lesions associated with failed endodontically treated teeth. In all patients periapical lesions were surgically removed with retrograde amalgam seal and the graft material was then carefully packed without pressure into the bony defect. The lesions were fixed in 10% neutral buffered formalin and prepared for histologic examination. Long-term recall demonstrated bone regeneration and good tolerance of allograft material by the periapical tissues. The periapical lesions were either periapical granulomas or apical periodontal cysts. We conclude that FDBA is a biocompatible material of osteogenic potential and can be used effectively in treating osseous defects of periapical lesions associated with failed endodontically treated teeth. 
A selective loss of somatostatin in the hippocampus of patients with temporal lobe epilepsy. Although neuropeptides have been demonstrated to be hippocampal neuromodulators in laboratory animals, their role in human hippocampal physiology or pathophysiology remains to be defined. The concentrations of somatostatin, cholecystokinin octapeptide, vasoactive intestinal polypeptide, and dynorphin A 1-17 were determined in hippocampal tissue resected from patients with cryptogenic temporal lobe epilepsy, a common seizure disorder originating in or near the hippocampus. Control tissue was obtained from cadavera or epilepsy patients in whom the hippocampus was removed during the resection of temporal lobe tumors. Peptide determinations were performed on extracts of punch biopsy specimens taken from six different hippocampal regions. A significant decrease in immunoreactive somatostatin concentration was identified in the dentate gyrus and in region cornu ammonis 4 of cryptogenic temporal lobe epilepsy specimens. No significant changes were present in any other hippocampal region or in the levels of other peptides. In situ hybridization studies performed on cryostat sections from similar patients confirmed a marked loss of neurons expressing the somatostatin gene, which was restricted to the dentate hilus. The density of specific 125I-somatostatin binding to cryostat sections, as determined by semiquantitative in vitro autoradiography, was significantly increased in the dentate gyrus of the cryptogenic epilepsy patients, compared with tumor control specimens. We conclude that a loss of somatostatin-producing interneurons with an upregulation of dentate somatostatin receptors is a specific and characteristic element in the pathophysiology of human cryptogenic temporal lobe epilepsy. 
Altered load dependence of postischemic myocardium Intermittent myocardial ischemia can produce areas of postischemic ("stunned") myocardium in the heart of the human with coronary artery disease. These areas are no longer ischemic, but have diminished contractile performance. Although the effects of loading conditions on systolic contraction of normal, ischemic, and failing myocardium have been investigated in great detail, the way in which load affects contraction of postischemic myocardium is not known. The aim of this study was to determine in anesthetized dogs how loading conditions affect the systolic function of a region of myocardium after 10 min of ischemia and 1 h of reperfusion. Sets of piezoelectric crystals were implanted in a test zone and in a remote zone of myocardium. Measurements of systolic wall thickening were made during nine combinations of left atrial pressure (3, 6, and 9 cmH2O) and mean arterial pressure (70, 90, and 110 mmHg). One set of measurements was made under baseline conditions, and a second set was made after 10 min of coronary occlusion and 1 h of reperfusion. Ischemia and reperfusion reduced wall thickening in the test zone 36 +/- 3% and diminished the response to increases in preload. In contrast, the response of the test zone to changes in afterload was unchanged. An interaction between the test zone (in which depressed contraction was observed) and the surrounding myocardium (in which enhanced function was observed) produced the appearance of a regional wall motion abnormality as afterload increased. These results emphasize that the load dependence of postischemic myocardium differs from that of normal myocardium and must be taken into account in clinical studies in which regional contraction is used to monitor the heart for ischemia. 
Transesophageal electrocardiography using a temporary pacing balloon-tipped electrode in acute cardiac care. STUDY OBJECTIVE: The study was undertaken to determine the feasibility of obtaining esophageal ECGs using resterilized 3F temporary pacing balloon-inflated electrodes in place of the more expensive pill-electrode and its associated expensive preamplifier. SETTING: Tests were conducted in the emergency department and ICU. TYPE OF PARTICIPANTS: Subjects were 12 acutely ill patients for whom standard 12-lead surface ECGs were insufficient to afford accurate, immediate arrhythmia diagnosis. INTERVENTIONS: Reasonable quality esophageal ECGs were obtained by use of the electrodes, generally with minimal patient discomfort. The test never required more than ten minutes. Of the 12 patients who participated in this preliminary study, esophageal ECGs enabled definitive diagnoses to be made in ten cases. CONCLUSION: The use of resterilized temporary pacing balloon-inflated electrodes enables esophageal ECGs to be obtained in an acute care setting. 
Embolization with steel coils using a saline flush technique. A method using saline flush to push Gianturco steel coils through catheters is described, and has been successfully used in 45 patients. The saline flush technique requires no precise matching of coils and catheters, solves problems associated with the conventional method and simplifies the coil embolization procedure. 
Ascites and pleural effusions associated with endometriosis. We report a case of ascites and bilateral pleural effusions associated with an endometrioma in a 26-year-old woman of Chinese descent. She had a right salpingo-oophorectomy and partial omentectomy performed, and she received leuprolide acetate depot injections after the operation. We believe this is the first description of use of a GnRH agonist to treat this rare condition. 
Sodium-lithium countertransport and hypertension in Rochester, Minnesota. The objectives of the present study were to determine whether increased sodium-lithium countertransport is associated with essential hypertension in the general Caucasian population and to determine whether this association is independent of the effects of gender, age, body size, and plasma lipids. We studied 543 men and 589 women from the population of Rochester, Minnesota. Mean sodium-lithium countertransport was higher in hypertensive than in normotensive subjects in men (370 +/- 147 [mean +/- SD] versus 315 +/- 110 mumol/l red blood cells [RBC]/hr, p less than 0.001) and in women (339 +/- 114 versus 269 +/- 92 mumol/l RBC/hr, p less than 0.001). Interindividual differences in plasma triglycerides, body mass index (wt/[ht]2), and plasma total cholesterol explained 13.0% of sodium-lithium countertransport variation in men (p less than 0.001) and 20.2% in women (p less than 0.001). Age did not predict additional sodium-lithium countertransport variation in either gender. Slopes of the regressions of sodium-lithium countertransport on plasma triglycerides, body mass index, and plasma total cholesterol did not differ between diagnostic groups in men (p = 0.31) or in women (p = 0.29). After adjustment to remove sodium-lithium countertransport variation attributable to these covariates, mean sodium-lithium countertransport remained significantly higher in hypertensive than in normotensive subjects in men (354 +/- 139 versus 319 +/- 104 mumol/l RBC/hr, p less than 0.01) and in women (311 +/- 103 versus 278 +/- 83 mumol/l RBC/hr, p less than 0.01). 
Effects of enteral fat emulsion on fat absorption in obstructive jaundiced rats. The effects of fat emulsion given enterally on fat absorption were studied with obstructive jaundiced rats (J group) as compared with jaundice-free rats (C group). The J and C groups were subdivided into JE and CE groups using emulsified fat for the fat absorption test, and JU and CU groups using unemulsified fat. Rats in all groups were fed for 7 days with regular rat chow. After fasting for 12 hours, 14C-labeled fat emulsion was infused to the JE and CE, and 14C-labeled unemulsified fat to the JU and CU groups through a gastrostomy for the absorption test. The hourly and cumulative output of 14CO2 by respiration, absorption rate of 14C-labeled fat in the intestine, and metabolic oxidation rate of the absorbed fat were determined during an 8-hour period after the gastroenteral administration of emulsified or unemulsified fat. The peak of hourly output was seen after the first 2 hours in the CE, JE, and CU groups, following which a remarkable decline was seen in the CE and CU groups. However, a more gentle descent in the JE, and fluctuation at a low level in the JU group were observed. The cumulative output in the JE was 61% of that in the CE, while the output in the JU was 16% of that in the CU group. The absorption rate in the JE was 81% of that in the CE group, while the rate in the JU was 22% of that in the Cu group. 
Congenital cystic eye with multiple ocular and intracranial anomalies. We describe a newborn with congenital cystic eye, contralateral persistent hyperplastic primary vitreous, and cerebrocutaneous abnormalities. The cerebrocutaneous abnormalities consisted of agenesis of the corpus callosum, midbrain deformity, malformed sphenoid bone, right upper eyelid coloboma, and a left periocular hamartoma. The results of karyotype analysis of the patient and his parents were normal. The association of congenital cystic eye with contralateral persistent hyperplastic primary vitreous has not been previously reported, to our knowledge. Although no unifying diagnosis exists for the collection of anomalies demonstrated in this patient, the term cranial ectodermopathy broadly classifies most of the defects. 
Detection of talocalcaneal coalitions by magnification bone scintigraphy. Fibrocartilaginous talocalcaneal coalitions are very difficult to identify on plain radiography in symptomatic children and adolescents before gross ossification occurs. Computed tomography (CT) has been successful in identifying osseous and some fibro-osseous coalitions. In this series, magnification imaging of the tarsus on bone scintigraphy in the medial-lateral projection correctly identified talocalcaneal coalitions, seven of the nine bars were fibrous or fibro-osseous. Three of the fibrous lesions were equivocal or normal on conventional radiography and CT. Physiologic accumulations of activity in the growing hind foot are also presented from a control pediatric population. Magnification scintigraphy of the hind foot is offered as an adjunct to plain radiography and CT in the diagnosis of elusive nonosseous subtalar bars. 
Prognostic significance of basement membrane deposition in operable squamous cell carcinomas of the lung. Tumor histology, stage of disease, and performance status are the most important prognostic factors in squamous cell lung cancer (SqCLC). A potentially important descriptor is the pattern of tumor growth as reflected in the dissolution of preexisting or deposition of newly formed basement membrane (BM) around tumor cell nests. The possible correlation between the pattern of BM deposition and patient survival was investigated. Immunohistochemistry testing, using polyclonal antibodies to human type IV collagen, was done on tumor samples of 68 patients with operable Stages I or II SqCLC, and BM staining was scored semiquantitatively. More than 75% immunoreactivity was scored as extensive BM and less than 75% as moderate or limited BM. In six patients, no immunoreactivity could be detected. In 27 of 62 patients, extensive and, in 35 of 62 patients, moderate-limited BM deposition was found. This deposition had a significant effect on survival (P = 0.02). Cox regression analysis, including BM deposition and tumor stage, indicated that BM deposition might also have value as an additional independent prognostic indicator for survival (P = 0.02). Deposition of an appreciable amount of BM in the center of the SqCLC was a prognostically favorable sign, independent of tumor stage. 
Genes for epilepsy mapped in the mouse. The neurological mutant mouse strain E1 is a model for complex partial seizures in humans. The inheritance of epileptic seizures with seven conventional chromosomal markers and over 60 endogenous proviral markers was studied by means of back-crosses of E1 with two seizure-resistant strains, DBA/2J and ABP/LeJ. The major gene responsible for this epileptic phenotype (El-1) was localized to a region distal with respect to the centromere on chromosome 9. At least one other gene, El-2, linked to proviral markers on chromosome 2, also influences the seizure phenotype. In addition, a potential modifier of seizures was detected in the DBA/2J background. The location of El-1 on distal chromosome 9 may allow identification of an epilepsy candidate gene in humans on the basis of conserved synteny with human chromosome 3. 
Thymic carcinoid. Carcinoid of the thymus is a rare neoplasm. Differentiation from thymoma is important because they have entirely different prognosis. A patient in whom a 19 x 18 x 12 cm carcinoid tumor of the thymus was surgically removed is presented. The tumor metastasized to peritracheal and internal mammary nodes, and invaded the SVC, pleura, lung, and pericardium. This is apparently the largest reported tumor of its kind. Prior to induction of anesthesia cardiopulmonary bypass and rigid bronchoscopy were readily available. Awake intubation was utilized. Even though long-term prognosis is poor, an aggressive surgical approach and adjuvant radiotherapy may achieve extended survival with excellent quality of life. Central aspects of the disease as well as pivotal therapeutic points are discussed. 
Bacterial invasion of the biliary system by way of the portal-venous system. It has been suggested that bacteria in the intestine gain access into the biliary tract by entering the portal-venous blood. We have tested the hypothesis of hematogenous infection of the biliary system in cats. The animals were treated in three different groups: group A (no biliary obstruction), group B (acute biliary obstruction) and group C (chronic biliary obstruction). A mutant strain of Escherichia coli was infused into the splenic vein of cats at three different dosages (10(7), 10(5) and 10(3) with sham controls. In the unobstructed biliary system, the mutant E. coli was isolated from the bile 30 min and 90 min after the infusion of 10(7) and 10(5) E. coli, respectively. No bacteria were found in the bile with the infusion of 10(3) E. coli and in the control animals. Bile flow was significantly reduced with the infusion of bacteria. The biliary excretion of E. coli in group B was similar to that in group A. In group C, the bile output in the first hour was very high but declined rapidly. E. coli was excreted into the bile at all three dosages of infusion after 30 min. Histological sections of the liver showed that the infused bacteria entered the sinusoidal blood and that some were phagocytosed by Kupffer cells. The portal-venous blood was considered an important route of bacterial invasion into the biliary system, and the penetration of bacteria was facilitated in biliary obstruction. 
Medical treatment of peptic ulcer disease. Our understanding of PUD and its treatment has improved dramatically during the past 15 years. During this time, many new effective drugs have been approved by the FDA, and possibly even more potent and effective therapies are now being evaluated. The H2-blockers, sucralfate, and antacids heal over 90% of duodenal ulcers in 6 to 8 weeks, and H2-blockers heal about 80% of gastric ulcers by 8 weeks and over 90% by 12 weeks. The new, more potent pump blockers (omeprazole) promise to be even more effective drugs, even for the healing of patients who are taking NSAIDS. However, the potential hazards of marked, long-term acid suppression must still be evaluated. Maintenance therapy with H2-blockers or sucralfate, ideally used for patients who would otherwise have frequent symptomatic recurrences of duodenal ulcer disease or who have had complications, reduces the relapses, especially symptomatic relapses. Maintenance therapy with H2-blockers also seems to reduce the recurrences of GUD, but this use has not yet received FDA approval. Elimination of H. pylori infection with antibiotics may prove to reduce recurrent ulcer disease and negate the need for maintenance therapy. Colloidal bismuth subcitrate alone, which suppresses but does not eradicate H. pylori infection, seems to be an effective ulcer drug and may even reduce the rate of early recurrences. Effective ulcer therapy, especially if it prevents recurrent disease, may reduce the complications of PUD, but this expectation has yet to be established. The use of prophylactic cytoprotective prostaglandins (misoprostol) reduces the incidence of NSAID-induced GUD. 
Sinusoidal portal hypertension in hepatic amyloidosis. Hepatic venous catheterisation and transvenous liver biopsy were performed in five patients with hepatic amyloidosis. In three patients, hepatic venous pressures were normal and histological examination of the liver biopsy specimen showed discrete and sparse perisinusoidal amyloid deposits. In the other two, however, the gradient between wedged and free hepatic venous pressures was increased (12 and 16 mmHg; normal 1-4 mmHg) and amyloid deposits were abundant and diffuse in the Disse's space. This study shows that portal hypertension in patients with hepatic amyloidosis is of the sinusoidal type and is related to the reduction of vascular space of hepatic sinusoids by massive perisinusoidal amyloid deposits. Furthermore, portal hypertension is associated with a poor prognosis in patients with hepatic amyloidosis. 
Helicobacter pylori infection and the risk of gastric carcinoma BACKGROUND. Infection with Helicobacter pylori has been linked with chronic atrophic gastritis, an inflammatory precursor of gastric adenocarcinoma. In a nested case-control study, we explored whether H. pylori infection increases the risk of gastric carcinoma. METHODS. From a cohort of 128,992 persons followed since the mid-1960s at a health maintenance organization, 186 patients with gastric carcinoma were selected as case patients and were matched according to age, sex, and race with 186 control subjects without gastric carcinoma. Stored serum samples collected during the 1960s were tested for IgG antibodies to H. pylori by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Data on cigarette use, blood group, ulcer disease, and gastric surgery were obtained from questionnaires administered at enrollment. Tissue sections and pathology reports were reviewed to confirm the histologic results. RESULTS. The mean time between serum collection and the diagnosis of gastric carcinoma was 14.2 years. Of the 109 patients with confirmed gastric adenocarcinoma (excluding tumors of the gastroesophageal junction), 84 percent had been infected previously with H. pylori, as compared with 61 percent of the matched control subjects (odds ratio, 3.6; 95 percent confidence interval, 1.8 to 7.3). Tumors of the gastroesophageal junction were not linked to H. pylori infection, nor were tumors in the gastric cardia. H. pylori was a particularly strong risk factor for stomach cancer in women (odds ratio, 18) and blacks (odds ratio, 9). A history of gastric surgery was independently associated with the development of cancer (odds ratio, 17; P = 0.03), but a history of peptic ulcer disease was negatively associated with subsequent gastric carcinoma (odds ratio, 0.2; P = 0.02). Neither blood group nor smoking history affected risk. CONCLUSIONS. Infection with H. pylori is associated with an increased risk of gastric adenocarcinoma and may be a cofactor in the pathogenesis of this malignant condition. 
Ischemic complications of abdominal aortic surgery. From 1982 through 1988, 634 consecutive patients underwent abdominal aortic reconstruction for occlusive (37%) or aneurysmal (63%) disease. We studied the ischemic problems affecting the branches of the aorta, excluding the coeliac and superior mesenteric arteries. Ischemic colitis (0.6%), spinal cord ischemia (0.16%), renal insufficiency (17%), and lower limbs ischemia (6.5%) were the major problems encountered. We identified the most significant factors associated with these complications such as hypotension, emergency, hypovolemia, preoperative renal function, suprarenal clamping, the quality of the preoperative investigation, and have suggested some specific preventive measures. 
The role of bupivacaine in post-tonsillectomy pain. The peritonsillar tissues on one side of 45 consecutive patients undergoing tonsillectomy were infiltrated with bupivacaine and adrenaline, the opposite side serving as a control. Although a significant difference was noted between the two sides this was not a substantial difference in terms of pain relief. 
Sonography of abnormal lymph nodes in vitro: correlation of sonographic and histologic findings. The sonographic evaluation of lymph nodes is based primarily on evaluation of their shape and size. Recently, however, the availability of high-frequency transducers has made consideration of internal structure possible. An important objective is to determine whether node enlargement is due to inflammatory or neoplastic processes. To determine the accuracy of sonography for this purpose, we obtained in vitro sonograms of 53 enlarged lymph nodes excised from 41 patients during surgery for neoplastic or nonneoplastic disease. The sonograms were obtained with 7.5- and 10-MHz transducers. They were interpreted by a radiologist who was unaware of the clinical diagnosis. The nodes were subsequently processed for anatomohistologic study; findings were compared side by side. In 26 of the 53 nodes, sonograms showed an identifiable central echogenic line, which on histologic specimen corresponded to the internal part of the medulla where the lymphatic sinuses converge. All these nodes were benign. Two other nodes had an echogenic internal structure not resembling the normal hilum; in one case this was caused by metastatic disease and in the other by fibrosis. Sonograms of the remaining 25 nodes showed no detectable hilar structure; 21 were involved by a tumor and four had diffuse fatty replacement. Our results suggest that the sonographic finding of a central echogenic line is a valid criterion of benignity. Absence of this finding may be due to factors other than neoplastic disease, such as fatty replacement. 
A generalized description of Wenckebach behavior with analysis of determinants of ventricular cycle-length variation during ambulatory electrocardiography. Although variation in ventricular cycle length during Wenckebach-type second-degree atrioventricular block traditionally has been explained by the direction of incremental change in PR lengthening preceding the blocked complex, changing PP intervals can also affect Wenckebach periodicity. A generalized algebraic solution was derived to define changing ventricular cycle length as a function of both changing PP and changing incremental PR interval behavior in Wenckebach block. Based on this solution, the determinants of cycle-length variation were examined for 65 episodes of Wenckebach block detected by ambulatory electrocardiography in 51 patients. As previously demonstrated, only 20% (13 of 65) of Wenckebach episodes were characterized by the "classic" shortening of RR intervals; in contrast, ventricular cycle length increased in 57% (37 of 65) and remained constant in 23% (15 of 65) of cases. Algebraic analysis of these episodes revealed that the direction of ventricular cycle-length change preceding the blocked complex was primarily determined by the direction of change of incremental PR intervals in only 35% (23 of 65) of Wenckebach episodes; RR change was governed by the direction of change of preceding PP intervals in 34% (22 of 65) and by equal change of PP and incremental PR intervals in 31% (20 of 65) of these episodes. Both inverse and concordant relationships between changing RP and PR intervals were primarily determined by the direction of PP variation during in vivo Wenckebach block. These data confirm that classic Wenckebach block is less common than "atypical" Wenckebach periodicity and demonstrate that RR variation in Wenckebach block is governed by the changing PP interval as often as by the changing incremental PR interval. 
Ventilatory responses to chemoreceptor stimulation after hypoxic acclimatization in awake goats. Our objective was to test the hypothesis that exposure to prolonged hypoxia results in altered responsiveness to chemoreceptor stimulation. Acclimatization to hypoxia occurs rapidly in the awake goat relative to other species. We tested the sensitivity of the central and peripheral chemoreceptors to chemical stimuli before and after 4 h of either isocapnic or poikilocapnic hypoxia (arterial PO2 40 Torr). We confirmed that arterial PCO2 decreased progressively, reaching a stable value after 4 h of hypoxic exposure (poikilocapnic group). In the isocapnic group, inspired minute ventilation increased over the same time course. Thus, acclimatization occurred in both groups. In goats, isocapnic hypoxia did not result in hyperventilation on return to normoxia, whereas poikilocapnic hypoxia did cause hyperventilation, indicating a different mechanism for acclimatization and the persistent hyperventilation on return to normoxia. Goats exposed to isocapnic hypoxia exhibited an increased slope of the CO2 response curve. Goats exposed to poikilocapnic hypoxia had no increase in slope but did exhibit a parallel leftward shift of the CO2 response curve. Neither group exhibited a significant change in response to bolus NaCN injections or dopamine infusions after prolonged hypoxia. However, both groups demonstrated a similar significant increase in the ventilatory response to subsequent acute exposure to isocapnic hypoxia. The increase in hypoxic ventilatory sensitivity, which was not dependent on the modality of hypoxic exposure (isocapnic vs. poikilocapnic), reinforces the key role of the carotid chemoreceptors in ventilatory acclimatization to hypoxia. 
Shower versus sink bath: evaluation of heart rate, blood pressure, and subjective response of the patient with myocardial infarction. The purpose of this study was to compare the effects of a sitting shower versus a sitting sink bath in low-risk patients with myocardial infarction (MI). Heart rate, blood pressure (mean blood pressure and rate-pressure-product), ratings of perceived exertion, and occurrence of symptoms during the baths and between resting, bathing, and recovery periods were evaluated. Thirty patients with MI were tested during their first and second self-bath on 2 consecutive days between 2 and 9 days after MI. The bathing methods produced significant increases from the resting values in all the variables (p less than or equal to 0.05). No significant differences between the resting and recovery values existed (p greater than 0.05). Ten subjects experienced atypical responses to bathing as indicated by heart rate and blood pressures. Fatigue was the most frequently encountered symptom at rest and during the bathing activities. The findings suggest that low-risk patients with MI can choose between a sitting sink bath or a sitting shower as their first self-bath after MI, based on preferences. However, because the bathing activity (and not the bathing method) did produce some atypical responses in one third of the subjects, readiness to engage in bathing activities should be individually assessed by objective and subjective criteria. 
Acute leukemia after a primary myelodysplastic syndrome: immunophenotypic, genotypic, and clinical characteristics. We studied the nature of blast cells in 41 patients with acute leukemia following a previous primary myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) by a combined multiparameter analysis including morphologic, immunophenotypic, and molecular genetic (Igs, T-cell receptor (TCR)-beta, -gamma, and -delta and the major breakpoint cluster region [M-bcr]) investigations. In addition, the clinical and hematologic characteristics according to the immunophenotype of blast cells were analyzed. Our results show that, although the granulocytic and/or monocytic lineages are those most commonly involved in these acute leukemias, other cell components, including the megakaryocytic and lymphoid, may be present (12% and 15% of the cases, respectively). Moreover, both morphologic and phenotypic studies show the frequent coexistence of two or three cell populations. Interestingly, in all cases the lymphoblastic component constantly displayed an early B phenotype (CD19+, CD10-, TdT+). Upon analyzing whether the type of MDS conditioned any differences in the immunophenotype of blast cells, we observed that, although the lymphoid lineage may be involved in all MDS subgroups, some differences emerge within the myeloid leukemic transformations. Thus, the refractory anemias with excess of blasts (RAEB) and RAEB in transformation displayed a significantly higher incidence of myeloblastic and megakaryoblastic transformations, while in the RA, RA with ring sideroblasts and chronic myelomonocytic leukemia, the granulo-monocytic phenotype predominated. In addition, our results show that the clinical and hematologic characteristics of these patients may be partially related to the immunophenotype of the blast cells. Ig heavy chain gene rearrangements were found in two of 19 patients analyzed (11%), one with a hybrid leukemia (lymphoid-myeloid) and the other with a granulo-monocytic phenotype. Two other hybrid transformations analyzed were in germline configuration. Gamma and delta gene rearrangements were found in 21% and 37% of these acute transformation, respectively. The TCR-beta and M-bcr were in germline configuration in all 19 cases studied. In summary, immunophenotype and molecular studies point to a pluripotent stem cell with preferential myeloid commitment as the target cell of leukemias following a primary MDS. 
Low power laser biostimulation of chronic oro-facial pain. A double-blind placebo controlled cross-over study in 40 patients. The efficacy of low power laser stimulation in the treatment of chronic oro-facial pain conditions was investigated in a double-blind placebo controlled modified cross-over study in 40 patients. The laser was an invisible infrared (IR) diode laser with an emission at 904 nanometer (nm). Treatment effect was evaluated by means of VAS-scales and global assessment of pain. Outcome of treatment was correlated to changes in urinary excretion of 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid (5-HIAA). The clinical impression was that placebo was superior to laser stimulation. No statistically significant difference between the analgesic effect of the laser and placebo irradiation was found on VAS-scales. A significant (P = 0.05) increase in 5-HIAA excretion was found in the placebo group. It is concluded that the possibility of a substantial placebo response should be taken into consideration using 904 nm (IR) lasers for pain treatment in patients with this type of chronic oro-facial pain. 
A randomized trial of carboplatin versus iproplatin in untreated advanced ovarian cancer. Between August 1984 and October 1987, 120 patients with stage IC to IV epithelial ovarian cancer were randomly assigned to receive carboplatin (400 mg/m2) or iproplatin (300 mg/m2) every 4 weeks as initial treatment. Stratification was made according to International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics (FIGO) stage and according to size of residual disease after surgery. Response was evaluated after six courses when patients were restaged, with laparoscopy or laparotomy in clinical complete responders or those with no assessable disease. Treatment was then stopped in surgically proven complete responders. Patients with partial (PR) or minor response (MR) received a further six courses of their original drug at a reduced dose (carboplatin 300 mg/m2, iproplatin 225 mg/m2). Patients with stable (SD), progressive (PD), or recurrent disease were treated with cyclophosphamide (1 g/m2). The response rates were 63% (95% confidence interval [CI], 50% to 74%) for carboplatin and 38% (95% CI, 26% to 51%) for iproplatin. Fifteen patients were not assessable for response. The median survival was 114 weeks (95% CI, 82 to 233 weeks) for carboplatin patients and 68 weeks (95% CI, 48 to 82 weeks) for iproplatin patients (P = .008). The amount of residual disease after initial laparotomy was a prognostic factor for survival. Myelosuppression was the main toxicity and was greater with iproplatin. This study shows carboplatin to be more active than iproplatin in the treatment of ovarian cancer and less toxic. Few responses to cyclophosphamide occurred following either drug, implying resistance to the alkylating agent. 
Determinants of late stage diagnosis of breast and cervical cancer: the impact of age, race, social class, and hospital type [published erratum appears in Am J Public Health 1991 Aug;81(8):980] Previous studies of the relationship between cancer stage, age, and race have not controlled for social class and health care setting. Logistic regression analyses, using information from the New York State Tumor Registry and area-level social class indicators, demonstrated that, in New York City, older Black, lower class women in public hospitals were 3.75 and 2.54 times more likely to have late stage breast or cervical cancer, respectively, than were younger White, high social class women in non-public hospitals. 
Breast conservation therapy. Severe breast fibrosis after radiation therapy in patients with collagen vascular disease. Two patients with collagen vascular disease (rheumatoid arthritis and scleroderma) had extremely poor cosmetic results after breast radiation therapy (RT). The patient with rheumatoid arthritis received 5251 cGy at 210 cGy per day, followed by a 1600 cGy iridium-192 implant boost. Between 8 and 11 months post-RT she had severe breast fibrosis, retraction, and pain that required a mastectomy for relief. The patient with scleroderma received 5040 cGy at 180 cGy per day without a boost. Between 1 and 4 months post-RT the systemic symptoms of scleroderma progressed and the breast became hard and retracted. Both rheumatoid arthritis and scleroderma are chronic systemic diseases characterized by severe inflammation and an autoimmune component. The presence of scleroderma at or before treatment should be considered a contraindication to breast RT, whereas the presence of active rheumatoid arthritis should be considered a relative contraindication. An autoimmune mechanism will be presented to explain both the fibrosis and the systemic progression of collagen vascular disease that was observed. 
Antiinflammatory and antiarthritic properties of a substituted quinoline carboxylic acid: CL 306,293. CL 306,293, a substituted quinoline carboxylic acid at a daily oral dose between 1.5 and 3.0 mg/kg suppressed the inflammation and joint destruction (radiological criteria) associated with both developing and established adjuvant arthritis. When a weekly oral dosing regimen was used, joint destruction was attenuated when this agent was administered at a dose of 50 to 200 mg/kg. Inflammation associated with a delayed type hypersensitivity reaction in dogs was suppressed at a daily dose of 0.25 mg/kg or a weekly dose of 1 mg/kg. At efficacious doses, CL 306,293 had no effects on cyclooxygenase or lipoxygenase activities nor did it have an effect on carrageenin induced paw edema. In acute tests, the compound was not ulcerogenic. The above observations indicate that the antiinflammatory effects of CL 306,293 are distinct from those observed with nonsteroidal antiinflammatory agents. Mechanistic studies conducted and to be published indicate that CL 306,293 down regulates T cell function and this mechanism may account, at least in part, for the antiinflammatory and antiarthritic properties observed in animal models of inflammation and joint destruction. 
Vascular complications of lumbar decompression laminectomy and foraminotomy. A unique case and review of the literature. The possibility of vascular injury should always be kept in mind during lumbar laminectomy. Patients with pre-existing vascular disease are predisposed to injury. Unexplained hypotension is highly suggestive of a vascular catastrophe and is an indication for more detailed examination, sometimes laparotomy. If the patient's clinical condition is stable, consider arteriography. The development of high-output cardiac failure in a patient who has recently undergone lumbar laminectomy is almost diagnostic of traumatic arteriovenous fistula. The best prognosis for recovery of acute vascular interruption occurs with immediate treatment within 24-48 hours. Continued awareness of the possible occurrence of these injuries and familiarity with their various manifestations will facilitate early diagnosis, prompt operative repair, and improved mortality. 
Fulminant hepatic failure after repeated exposure to isoflurane anesthesia: a case report. A previously healthy but obese 26-yr-old woman was diagnosed as having hepatic dysfunction 17 days after the third of three consecutive exposures to isoflurane anesthesia for paranasal sinus surgery. Serum laboratory findings included elevated aminotransferases and bilirubin. Radiographical evaluations showed no evidence of extrahepatic disease. Serological studies were negative for acute viral infections, and serum copper was normal. The patient's condition deteriorated over the ensuing 17 days, with hyperreflexia, hypoglycemia and a rapid fall in serum aminotransferases with a concomitant rise in bilirubin level and prothrombin time despite maximal medical support. The liver volume as shown by computed tomography fell from 1,290 cm3 to 680 cm3 over 6 days. The patient underwent successful orthotopic liver transplantation 25 days after onset of symptoms. Histopathological examination of the resected liver showed submassive and massive necrosis, with a few foci of microvesicular steatosis and ultrastructural evidence of mitochondrial abnormalities. Although we found insufficient evidence to prove that this case was caused by isoflurane anesthesia, the clinical course and histopathological findings are similar to those in hepatic injury caused by halothane anesthesia. Therefore we report this as a possible case of fulminant hepatic failure resulting from isoflurane anesthesia. 
Endoscopy as an adjuvant to biliary radiologic intervention. Twenty-two patients underwent 24 percutaneous biliary procedures guided with choledochoscopy, an adjunctive percutaneous biliary technique. All but four procedures were performed through established percutaneous tracts; the others, through tracts less than 4 weeks old. The procedures were done for the following reasons: removal of calculi (n = 15), electrohydraulic lithotripsy (n = 1), biliary duct biopsies (n = 8), cauterization of a bleeding tract (n = 1), and evaluation of biliary-enteric anastomoses (n = 11). The only complication was one case of severe nausea after choledochoscopy. This patient required overnight hospitalization and medical treatment. All procedures were technically successful, except one case in which the tract was undersized. All patients received intravenously administered antibiotics before and after the procedure. It is concluded that choledochoscopy is a safe, atraumatic, and well-tolerated method of evaluating and treating biliary disease and that it markedly reduces radiation exposure. It can be performed rapidly with minimal sedation on an in- or outpatient basis. 
Implantation of human fetal ventral mesencephalon to the right caudate nucleus in advanced Parkinson's disease. Disaggregated ventral mesencephalic tissue from single aborted human fetuses of 11 to 18 weeks' gestation was implanted stereotaxically into a consistent striatal site in 12 patients with advanced Parkinson's disease. All were receiving optimum levodopa therapy and were examined preoperatively and at 3,6,9, and 12 months postoperatively. Immunosuppression was not used. There were significant sustained improvements at 12 months in three patients; motor fluctuations were absent in two. There were modest group improvements up to 6 months, with increased quality of "on" and "off" phases, quantity of on times, and specific improvements in contralateral upper limb bradykinesia. Preoperative levodopa requirements were reduced to a mean of 64% at 6 months and 61% at 12 months. Deterioration below baseline ratings occurred in three of nine patients who had consistent follow-up to 12 months. Grafting of midgestational human fetal tissue can lead to improvement in Parkinson's disease. Individual disease severity may be critical, and further trials are needed to identify host factors influencing outcome. 
Laparoscopic nephrectomy: initial case report. A tumor-bearing right kidney was completely excised from an 85-year-old woman using a laparoscopic approach. A newly devised method for intra-abdominal organ entrapment and a recently developed laparoscopic tissue morcellator made it possible to deliver the 190 gm. kidney through an 11 mm. incision. 
The assessment of visuo-spatial neglect after acute stroke. Forty four consecutive patients with acute hemispheric stroke and forty seven elderly controls with no neurological disease were assessed for visuo-spatial neglect, using a modified neglect test battery. Neglect was found to be equally common in patients with right hemisphere and left hemisphere stroke three days after stroke (72% versus 62%). It was more severe in those with a right hemisphere stroke and resolved more frequently in those with a left hemisphere stroke. The battery was validated against an occupational therapist's assessment of neglect on self-care tasks. The inter-observer reliability was good and it was possible to monitor changes over time with the battery. 
Second-trimester maternal serum alpha-fetoprotein levels and the risk of subsequent fetal death BACKGROUND. The finding of an elevated level of maternal serum alpha-fetoprotein during the second trimester of pregnancy may indicate that the fetus has died or is about to die. It is uncertain, however, whether the finding is associated with an increased risk of fetal death later in gestation independent of known causes of elevation, such as the presence of neural-tube defects or multiple gestation. METHODS. To address this question, we performed a case-control study of 612 women whose pregnancies ended in fetal death and 2501 women who gave birth to live infants, using reports from California vital statistics for 1987. All the women had signleton pregnancies and alpha-fetoprotein screening in the second trimester. RESULTS. Women with elevated levels of serum alpha-fetoprotein in the second trimester of pregnancy had an increased risk of fetal death, and the risk was increased until term. Women with the highest levels of serum alpha-fetoprotein--greater than or equal to 3.0 times the median value--had a very high risk of fetal death (odds ratio, 10.4; 95 percent confidence interval, 4.9 to 22.0) as compared with women who had normal levels of alpha-fetoprotein. Maternal serum alpha-fetoprotein levels that were 2.0 to 2.9 times the median were also associated with an elevated risk of fetal death (odds ratio, 2.4; 95 percent confidence interval, 1.7 to 3.4). Elevated levels of alpha-fetoprotein were especially likely to be associated with fetal death in cases in which maternal hypertension or placental infarction was also present. CONCLUSIONs. An unexplained elevated level of maternal serum alpha-fetoprotein in the second trimester of pregnancy is associated with an increased risk of subsequent fetal death, up to four to five months after alpha-fetoprotein screening. 
Identification and characterization of a cis-acting element that interferes with glucocorticoid-inducible activation of the mouse mammary tumor virus promoter. The rat hepatoma cell line M1.19 is stably infected by the mouse mammary tumor virus (MMTV), and the expression of the virus is induced by glucocorticoid treatment. However, in the 6.10.2 variant of M1.19, an increase in MMTV transcription is hardly detectable upon exposure to hormone. The mechanism of hormone-unresponsiveness in these cells has been unclear. In this study, we show that nuclear extract from 6.10.2 cells contains a specific DNA-binding activity that recognizes a sequence motif extending from positions -163 to -147 on the MMTV promoter. An oligonucleotide probe spanning this region binds a nuclear factor distinct from the glucocorticoid receptor. In vivo competition experiments, where increased amounts of a plasmid containing this element were transfected into 6.10.2 cells, showed a dose-dependent increase in hormonal inducibility of MMTV expression. Together, these results indicate that this sequence motif negatively modulates glucocorticoid-inducible activation of the MMTV promoter. Moreover, we have characterized a nuclear factor that preferentially binds to the coding strand of this element. 
An alternative for nasal tip reconstruction: the bilateral rotation flap. A large percentage of the skin tumors that dermatologic surgeons treat are located on the nose. Of these, a significant percentage are located on the nasal tip. The nasal tip is notoriously difficult to reconstruct and we present a bilateral rotation flap that may be useful in some instances for reconstruction of this area. 
Simultaneous potentiation and fatigue in quadriceps after a 60-second maximal voluntary isometric contraction. Potential mechanisms of fatigue (metabolic factors) and potentiation (phosphate incorporation by myosin phosphorylatable light chains) were investigated during recovery from a 60-s maximal voluntary isometric contraction (MVC) in the quadriceps muscle of 12 subjects. On separate days before and for 2 h after the 60-s MVC, either a 1-s MVC or electrically stimulated contractions were used as indexes to test muscle performance. Torque at the end of the 60-s MVC was 57% of the initial level, whereas torques from a 1-s MVC and 50-Hz stimulation were most depressed in the immediate recovery period. At this time, muscle biopsy analyses revealed significant decreases in ATP and phosphocreatine and a 19-fold increase in muscle lactate. Conversely, isometric twitch torque and torque from a 10-Hz stimulus were the least depressed of six contractile indexes and demonstrated potentiation of 25 and 34%, respectively, by 4 min of recovery (P less than 0.05). At this time, muscle lactate concentration was still 16 times greater than at rest. An increased phosphate content of the myosin phosphorylatable light chains (P less than 0.05) was also evident both immediately and 4 min after the 60-s MVC. We conclude that the 60-s MVC produced marked force decreases likely due to metabolic displacement, while the limited decline in the twitch and 10-Hz torques and their significant potentiation suggested that myosin phosphorylation may provide a mechanism to enhance contractile force under conditions of submaximal activation during fatigue. 
Blunt cervical spine Brown-Sequard injury. A report of three cases. Cervical spinal cord Brown-Sequard syndrome was diagnosed in three recent victims of blunt injury at the authors' Level II Trauma Center. While anatomic hemisection of the cord, resulting in ipsilateral motor and proprioception loss and contralateral pain and temperature deficit, is a fully understandable concept, in the context of the acute trauma evaluation, these findings may be confusing because they are unexpected. Penetrating trauma is far more likely to cause this uncommon syndrome than vehicular crash, fall, or crushing injury. Pediatric victims frequently have no fracture. Early neurosurgical consultation, computed tomography (CT), and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) if plain film radiography is uninformative, and consideration for rapid decompression if the deficit and pathologic anatomy warrant, are the recommended approaches. Motor function recovery from blunt injury may be expected within six months, a better prognosis than for penetrating injury causing the syndrome. 
Serum iron and transferrin in acute neuroleptic induced akathisia. Thirty acute psychiatric patients were examined prospectively at the beginning of neuroleptic treatment for acute psychotic symptoms and on average 16 days later. Two alternative hypotheses were examined: 1) neuroleptic treatment affects the levels of serum iron and transferrin; 2) acute akathisia developing during the initial few weeks of treatment is associated with low levels of serum iron and transferrin, either initially or at follow up or both. Serum iron levels did not change on repeat measurement, while there was a small, but significant decrease of serum transferrin. There was a significantly greater decrease in iron and transferrin levels in patients with akathisia on follow up compared with non-akathisics. In addition, akathisia ratings were highly correlated with serum transferrin levels on follow up. 
Perineal excision of the rectum for prolapse in the elderly. A perineal operation is described for the treatment of rectal prolapse. The surgery improves functional outcome by correcting the anatomical anomalies associated with the condition. In 17 elderly women, there was one perioperative death and one recurrence. At a median follow-up of 24 months, 13 patients were able to control solid stool and three were profoundly incontinent. The operation may be an alternative to the more invasive abdominal procedures for the treatment of the majority of patients with prolapse. 
Reactive occipital epileptiform activity: is it benign? Occipital epileptiform activity that is almost continuous and reactive to eye opening has been associated with a childhood epilepsy syndrome and basilar migraine with seizures. An association of these syndromes with a benign course had been disputed. In this study, a retrospective investigation of reactive occipital epileptiform activity (ROEA) was performed to determine the prognostic value of this distinctive EGG pattern. The EEG and hospital record of patients with ROEA were reviewed with an observation period of 6 months to 8 years. The patients were divided into good and poor outcome groups based on response to treatment. Of 33 patients, 12 (36.4%) had complete seizure control; 21 (63.6%) continued to have poorly controlled seizures. Only 3 (9.1%) patients were able to discontinue antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) without seizure recurrence. Analysis of clinical and EEG variables showed that a history of perinatal difficulties, abnormal neurologic findings, and abnormal EEG background activities occur significantly more frequently in the poor outcome group. This study suggests that ROEA is not uniformly associated with a benign course and that other factors are involved in determining prognosis of the epilepsy. 
Stroke following oral trauma in children. Stroke after oral trauma in children is a rare but catastrophic event. We describe two cases of stroke in children after each child fell with a writing instrument in the mouth. Both children had a latent period prior to the onset of neurologic symptoms. Ischemic infarction in the distribution of the middle cerebral artery was present in both cases. Both children were left with permanent hemiparesis. The case reports are reviewed and diagnosis and therapy are discussed. Emergency physicians should be aware of the risk of neurologic complications following apparently asymptomatic oral trauma. 
The effect of ERCP on circulating pancreatic enzymes and pancreatic protease inhibitors. The pathogenesis of endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP)-induced pancreatitis is poorly understood. To elucidate a role for pancreatic enzymes in ERCP-induced pancreatitis, we measured serum amylase, lipase, trypsin, and elastase in 25 patients undergoing ERCP. Serum alpha 1-antitrypsin and alpha 2-macroglobulin, two major pancreatic protease inhibitors, also were measured. All pancreatic enzymes measured rose significantly after ERCP. Pancreatic duct cannulation was associated with a greater elevation in serum amylase and lipase. Circulating alpha 2-macroglobulin was reduced by 7% (p = 0.04) 6 h after ERCP, whereas circulating alpha 1-antitrypsin increased over the same time period. Papillotomy, stent placement, or underlying disease did not influence changes any further. Three patients developed ERCP-induced pancreatitis. All three patients had circulating alpha 2-macroglobulin levels below 243 mg/dl (p = 0.03). The ERCP-induced alterations in circulating pancreatic enzymes and their inhibitors are similar to changes seen in clinical pancreatitis. Low circulating alpha 2-macroglobulin levels may predispose to ERCP-induced pancreatitis. 
Is routine CT scanning necessary in the preoperative evaluation of patients undergoing carotid endarterectomy? To evaluate the usefulness of CT scanning before carotid endarterectomy, a prospective study was performed on 469 consecutive patients considered for carotid endarterectomy during a 5-year period. All patients underwent carotid duplex scanning and CT scanning before carotid arteriography. Two hundred thirty-seven patients (51%) had transient ischemic attacks, 109 (23%) had a prior stroke, and 122 (26%) were asymptomatic. Results of the CT scan were abnormal in 68 (62%) of the 109 patients with stroke. Fifty-one of the 360 patients (14%) without a clinical history of stroke had an abnormal CT scan outcome. Of patients with a stroke documented by CT scanning, 27 had lacunar infarcts, and 92 had cortical infarcts; these findings did not change surgical management in any patient. CT scanning did not reveal any unsuspected infarcts or tumors. Two hundred thirty carotid endarterectomies were performed on 206 patients. Forty-seven patients (23%) in the operative group had abnormal CT scan findings, but the scan did not influence operative decisions or timing in any case. Seventy-two patients (27%) in the nonoperative group had abnormal CT scan results, but CT scan findings did not exclude any patient from arteriography or surgery. Three perioperative strokes (1.3%) occurred. CT scan findings did not correlate with postoperative neurologic complications. Cost of CT scanning was one-half million dollars in our study alone. Routine CT scanning is unnecessary before carotid endarterectomy and is not cost-effective. 
Peptide selection by MHC class I molecules. Synthetic peptides have been used to sensitize target cells and thereby screen for epitopes recognized by T cells. Most epitopes of cytotoxic T lymphocytes can be mimicked by synthetic peptides of 12-15 amino acids. Although in specific cases, truncations of peptides improves sensitization of target cells, no optimum length for binding to major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I molecules has been defined. We have now analysed synthetic peptide captured by empty MHC class I molecules of the mutant cell line RMA-S. We found that class I molecules preferentially bound short peptides (nine amino acids) and selectively bound these peptides even when they were a minor component in a mixture of longer peptides. These results may help to explain the difference in size restriction of T-cell epitopes between experiments with synthetic peptides and those with naturally processed peptides. 
No causal relationship between transdermal scopolamine and seizures: methodologic lessons for pharmacoepidemiology. Because of case reports suggesting that use of transdermal scopolamine might be associated with the subsequent development of seizures, a retrospective cohort study was performed with computerized Medicaid claims data. Patients receiving transdermal scopolamine were compared with patients receiving diphenhydramine, meclizine, prochlorperazine, and promethazine. A four-fold increased risk of seizures after transdermal scopolamine use was observed in the claims data. However, this was not supported by the primary medical records. All patients who had seizures after using transdermal scopolamine either had seizures before receiving the drug as well or did not really suffer from seizures. The original finding appeared to be the result of the use of transdermal scopolamine for "dizziness, rule out seizures"; the ICD-9-CM coding system does not include "rule out" diagnoses. Thus these data do not confirm the existence of an association between seizures and the use of transdermal scopolamine. In addition, this study demonstrates the usefulness of pharmacoepidemiology studies in documenting drug safety and the importance of obtaining primary medical records when performing pharmacoepidemiologic studies with claims data. 
A longitudinal study of respiratory symptoms in aluminum potroom workers. The influence of occupational work exposure and host factors on the incidence of dyspnea and wheezing as reported in questionnaires was examined in 1,301 new employees in aluminum electrolytic potrooms. The incidence appeared to decrease after 2 yr of exposure, and the estimated probability of development of symptoms was nearly 20% after 4 yr. A total of 105 subjects developed dyspnea and wheezing. Of 78 symptomatic subjects who were interviewed, 76% experienced improvement or absence of symptoms when off work. In 523 subjects who were assigned to specific levels of exposure at the end of follow-up, a dose-response gradient was found between the development of symptoms and fluoride exposure. Increased risk with increasing amounts of tobacco was also observed, but childhood allergy and a family history of asthma were not significantly related to the outcome variable. We conclude that both total fluoride exposure and smoking are related to asthmatic symptoms in potroom workers, and the suggestion of a dose-response gradient was found for both variables. However, a causal relationship between fluorides and symptoms should be investigated further by specific bronchial provocation testing and by research for specific antibodies and other immunologic markers. 
Preclinical detection in studies of the etiology, natural history, and treatment of Parkinson's disease. The development of reliable preclinical detection procedures for idiopathic Parkinson's disease may be the fundamental advance required for the establishment of the cause, the natural history, and ultimately, the prevention of this neurodegenerative disorder. The usefulness of these preclinical markers in efforts to better understand the etiology and development of this disorder will relate to whether they are direct measures of dopamine production or indirect measures such as metabolic changes or comorbidity, whether they can be used in the first or later decades of life, whether they are invasive, and whether they are expensive and sophisticated or simple and cheap. An overview of the criteria for evaluation of the utility of specific markers, as well as an assessment of the importance of early markers in future research, is presented. 
Opportunities to improve the cost-effectiveness of treatment for hypertension. The cost-effectiveness of treatment for hypertension depends on the pretreatment level of blood pressure, age and sex of the patient, presence of other cardiovascular risk factors, long-term control of blood pressure, and the annual costs of treatment. Treatment of very mild hypertension (diastolic blood pressure, 90-94 mm Hg), even if the benefits do exceed the risks, does not appear to be particularly cost-effective. Opportunities to improve the cost-effectiveness of hypertension management lie in 1) avoidance of patient mislabeling by careful documentation of blood pressures on multiple occasions in the office and during usual activities outside the office before the diagnosis is made and treatment is begun; 2) efforts to increase adherence to scheduled visits and medication regimens; 3) attempts to step-down dosages or discontinue medications after periods of good blood pressure control; 4) explicit consideration of costs, as well as benefits, in decisions on the needed frequency of office visits, choice of medications, and use of laboratory tests; and 5) efforts to improve practice efficiency. Future practice guidelines for hypertension management should take these factors into account and should make trade-offs between benefits, risks, and costs explicit for specific types of patients. 
Prevalence and clinical spectrum of skin diseases in kidney transplant recipients. Cutaneous lesions can be a significant problem in kidney transplant recipients. Factors such as climate and skin types have been implicated as modifiers of these clinical manifestations. With the purpose of determining the prevalence and clinical spectrum of skin diseases in a group of Hispanic kidney transplant recipients in a tropical climate, 82 serial unselected patients were examined. Seventy-eight were found to have some type of skin disease. Infections of the skin were the most common, followed by drug-induced changes and malignant or premalignant cutaneous tumors. Except for the preponderance of superficial mycotic infections, the overall results in our population are in agreement with other series. 
Helicobacter pylori infection induces antibodies cross-reacting with human gastric mucosa. The authors' previous observation that many of the monoclonal antibodies against Helicobacter pylori cross-react with the cells of the human gastric mucosa prompted them to investigate the possibility that gastric self-antigens cross-reacting with H. pylori could be involved in the immune response against this organism. It was found that three antibodies against H. pylori, CB-4, CB-10, and CB-14, that cross-react with the human gastric mucosa also intensely cross-reacted with murine gastric epithelial cells. A strong reaction against autologous mucosa was also evident in the sera of mice immunized with H. pylori but not with other bacteria. A serological study performed in a group of 82 patients undergoing gastroscopy showed that the presence of seropositivity against H. pylori was strongly correlated with the presence of autoantibodies against human antral gastric mucosa. This activity was neutralized after absorption of the sera with H. pylori but not with other gram-negative bacteria. The antibodies in the mouse and in the human did not react with other segments of the gastrointestinal tract or with most of the other organs. Mice bearing hybridomas secreting a cross-reacting antibody (CB-4) had histopathologic abnormalities in their stomachs. These lesions were absent in the stomachs of mice bearing hybridomas secreting a non-cross-reacting antibody (CB-26). It was concluded that H. pylori infection can stimulate antibodies cross-reacting with gastric autoantigens and that this immunologic mechanism may represent a pathogenic link between H. pylori and gastritis. 
Intraoperative identification of cardiac patients at risk to develop postoperative atrial fibrillation. Postoperative atrial fibrillation (AF) is a complication occurring in 11% to 36% of patients after cardiac operations, which results in increased morbidity and hospital costs. A new electrophysiologic screening test was developed to identify those patients at risk for development of postoperative AF. The test was validated in 50 patients (43 men and 7 women) with a mean age of 59.6 +/- 1.3 years who underwent coronary artery bypass grafting with or without other cardiac surgical procedures. After aortic and venous cannulation, but before initiation of bypass, the mid-right atrium was stimulated with a bipolar probe at 25 microA for 3 seconds. Alternating current was increased by 25 microA until AF was induced or up to a maximum of 200 microA. Postoperative AF occurred in 18 patients (36%), 17 of whom had inducible AF (sensitivity = 0.94). Of the remaining 32 AF-free patients, 13 had negative tests (specificity = 0.41). Age and sex were not factors affecting inducibility, although patients who developed AF were older than those who were AF free (63.6 versus 57.3 years, p = 0.02). Length of stay in the intensive care unit was longer for those with postoperative AF than for AF-free patients (3.6 versus 1.9 days, p = 0.02). The negative predictive value of the test was 0.93, and the positive value was 0.47. These data show that this new intraoperative technique may be used to identify patients at risk for postoperative AF. Prophylactic therapy can therefore be directed to only those patients at risk for postoperative AF. 
Comparison of morbidity and function after colectomy with ileorectal anastomosis or restorative proctocolectomy for familial adenomatous polyposis. Restorative proctocolectomy with an ileal reservoir (RPC) should prevent colorectal cancer in patients with familial adenomatous polyposis. Until this is confirmed its role compared with total colectomy and ileorectal anastomosis (IRA) will depend on the relative morbidity and postoperative bowel function after the two procedures. This was analysed in 99 patients (37 RPC, 62 IRA) operated on between 1977 and 1989. Morbidity was greater after RPC with subsequent ileostomy closure (median hospital stay, 24 versus 11 days; complications, 60 versus 21 per cent; reoperation, 29 versus 3 per cent; return to normal activity; 31 versus 14 weeks). There was little difference in bowel function; after IRA median frequency was 3/24 h and urgency (unable to wait 15 min) occurred in 50 per cent, compared with 4.5/24h and 17 per cent after RPC. Night evacuation occurred in 10 and 43 per cent respectively. IRA was performed in younger patients (median 19 versus 31 years) who had fewer bowel motions before operation (2 versus 5/24 h). The greater morbidity of RPC suggests that it should be restricted to patients at higher risk of developing later rectal cancer, including those unavailable for follow-up and those with large or confluent rectal polyps or with curable colon cancer at the initial colectomy. 
Anaphylactic reactions during general anesthesia among pediatric patients--United States, January 1990-January 1991. From March 1990 through January 1991, nine patients at one children's hospital in Wisconsin (hospital A) had onset of anaphylactic reactions (ARs) within 30 minutes following the start of general anesthesia; no patient had had a surgical incision at the time of their reaction. Eight of these patients required admission to the intensive care unit for supportive care. To determine the extent and potential source of the problem, an epidemiologic investigation was conducted at hospital A. 
Identification of a missense mutation in one allele of a patient with Pompe disease, and use of endonuclease digestion of PCR-amplified RNA to demonstrate lack of mRNA expression from the second allele. Infantile-onset glycogen storage disease type II, or Pompe disease, results from a genetic deficiency of the lysosomal enzyme acid alpha glucosidase (GAA). Sequencing of the cDNA from a cell line (GM 244) derived from a patient with Pompe disease demonstrated a T953-to-C transition that predicted a methionine-to-threonine substitution at codon 318. The basepair substitution resulted in loss of restriction-endonuclease sites for NcoI and StyI. Analysis of genomic DNA revealed both a normal and an abnormal NcoI fragment, indicating that the patient was a genetic compound. NcoI and StyI digestion of cDNA, amplified by PCR from reverse-transcribed RNA, demonstrated that greater than 95% of the GAA mRNA in GM 244 was derived from the allele carrying the missense mutation. The missense mutation was uncommon, since it was not detected in 37 additional GAA-deficient chromosomes, as determined by digestion of genomic DNA with NcoI and hybridization. The amino acid substitution predicts a new potential site for N-linked glycosylation, as well as major changes in secondary structure of the protein. We could confirm that the mutation was responsible for the enzyme deficiency by demonstrating that a hybrid minigene containing the mutation did not express GAA enzyme activity after transient gene expression. We have therefore now provided the first identification of a single-basepair missense mutation in a patient with Pompe disease and furthermore have demonstrated that the patient is a genetic compound with the second allele barely expressing mRNA. 
Inflammatory bowel disease. Part I: Nature and pathogenesis. Once regarded as medical curiosities, ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease have achieved a remarkable change in status recently and today are among the more compelling of all human illnesses. The cause(s) of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) are not known. Genetic, environmental, microbial, and immunologic factors are involved, but the precise mechanisms are obscure. The incidence of ulcerative colitis is relatively stable, while Crohn's disease continues to increase in frequency. In 10% to 15% of patients, it is hard to differentiate between ulcerative colitis and Crohn's colitis; however, problems with diagnosis usually resolve with time and repeated examinations. In part I of his two-part monograph on IBD, Dr. Kirsner addresses the nature and pathogenesis of the disease. Increased study of ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease in recent years has generated new knowledge regarding their etiology. Part I focuses on microbial, immunologic, and genetic mechanisms and the inflammatory processes involved in the disease. In part II, which will be presented in next month's issue of Disease-a-Month, Dr. Kirsner deals with the clinical features, course, and management of IBD, based on the author's 55 years of experience with these problems and supplemented by critical examination of the recent (1988-1990) literature. Particular attention is directed to the symptoms and physical findings of ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease, the laboratory, radiologic, endoscopic, and pathologic features, and the many systemic complications. The IBDs are mimicked by several enterocolonic infections and other conditions, making differential diagnosis necessary. Inflammatory bowel disease in children and the elderly conforms to conventional clinical patterns modified by the health circumstances of the respective age groups. Because the cause of IBD has not been established, current medical therapy is facilitative and supportive rather than curative. The principles of medical treatment are approximately the same for ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease. Treatment emphasizes a program rather than a drug and also considers the individuality of the therapeutic response. A clearer understanding of dietary and nutritional needs, including hyperalimentation and electrolyte and fluid balance, aids treatment. Antidiarrheal and antispasmodic preparations and sedatives are prescribed for symptom relief. The bowel inflammation is controlled with sulfasalazine or the newer 5-amino salicylic acid (5-ASA) compounds, antibacterial drugs for complications of Crohn's disease and IBD, adrenocortical steroids, and the immunosuppressive compounds 6-mercaptopurine (6-MP), azathioprine, and cyclosporine, as determined in each patient. The surgical procedures available for treatment of ulcerative colitis include total proctocolectomy and ileostomy or ileoanal anastomosis.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS). 
Cerebrovascular CO2 reactivity in migraine: assessment by transcranial Doppler ultrasound. Cerebrovascular reactivity to CO2 inhalation was studied by transcranial Doppler sonography in 30 patients with classic or common migraine and 39 healthy controls without clinical or ultrasonic signs of arteriosclerosis. Systolic and diastolic Doppler frequencies of the middle cerebral artery were plotted against end-tidal CO2 partial pressure; the reactivity index (I x R) was defined as relative frequency change during a PCO2 increase of 5 mmHg. In the normal subjects, I x R was 20.0 +/- 6.3 for systolic velocities, and 26.0 +/- 8.2 for diastolic values. Migraineurs during their headache-free interval had significantly higher I x R values on the affected side (mean: 41.6 systolic, 61.2 diastolic), compared with either controls (P less than 0.01) or the contralateral side (mean: 28.3 systolic, 30.8 diastolic; P less than 0.01). During the headache attack, CO2 reactivity was significantly lower than normal only for systolic velocities (mean: 8.3; P less than 0.05). Increased CO2 reactivity is thought to be one phenomenon of migraine. Transcranial Doppler CO2 testing of cerebrovascular reactivity is a reliable method that may be of interest for the diagnostic evaluation and management of migraine patients. 
Methotrexate, vinblastine, doxorubicin, and cisplatin in metastatic breast cancer. A phase II trial of the Hoosier Oncology Group. Forty-six eligible patients with metastatic breast cancer (MBC) were treated with a combination of methotrexate, vinblastine, doxorubicin, and cisplatin (M-VAC) as first-line chemotherapy. Of 44 patients evaluable for response, 28 (64%) had an objective response, including seven (16%) who had a complete response. The median duration of response was 4 months (range, 0 to 38 months), and the median survival from the time of entry was 14 months (range, less than 1 to greater than 45 months). Myelosuppression was the most common dose-limiting toxicity, with 54% of patients experiencing Grade 3 or 4 leukopenia (including 28% with granulocytopenic fever and one septic death), and cumulative Grade 3 anemia occurred in 28% of patients. Grades 3 to 4 stomatitis was observed in 18% of patients. An active, although highly toxic regimen when used as first-line therapy in MBC, M-VAC has a response rate and survival duration similar to existing, less toxic combination regimens. As such, M-VAC cannot be recommended in preference to other combination chemotherapy regimens in this clinical setting. 
Urodynamic evaluation of the patient with an imperforate anus: a prospective study. Prospective urodynamic evaluation of 14 patients with an imperforate anus revealed detrusor-sphincter dyssynergia in 4. Subsequent contrast voiding cystourethrograms demonstrated radiographic changes in all 4 cases, consisting of bladder trabeculation, new onset of vesicoureteral reflux or hydroureteronephrosis. Of the 4 patients 3 had a high (supralevator) imperforate anus, while 1 had a low (infralevator) lesion. Two patients had bony vertebral abnormalities and 2 had normal plain radiographs and magnetic resonance imaging of the spine. Therefore, early urodynamic study is recommended for all patients with an imperforate anus and it should complement neonatal uroradiographic evaluation. The finding of detrusor-sphincter dyssynergia should alert the urologist to the need for adjunctive management. 
Central arteriovenous malformations of the maxillofacial skeleton: case report. Central arteriovenous malformation of the maxillofacial skeleton, though rare, is a well-documented entity. Past treatments have usually included some form of surgical intervention. Surgical resection as an attempt to cure has been effective but costly, ie, in relationship to patient morbidity and hospital expenditures. A case of vascular malformation is presented in which selective angiography and embolization as a primary treatment were used rather than ablative surgery. The patient tolerated the procedures well, with complete resolution of bleeding. 
Comparison of the results of electrophysiologic testing after short-term and long-term treatment with amiodarone in patients with ventricular tachycardia. The results of electrophysiologic testing after short-term and long-term treatment with amiodarone were compared in 71 patients with ventricular tachycardia. Electrophysiologic testing was performed in the baseline state after 11 +/- 3 days of treatment with 1.2 to 2.4 gm/day of amiodarone, and after 13 +/- 4 weeks of therapy with a daily amiodarone dose of 400 mg. After short-term therapy, 62% of the patients had an adequate response to amiodarone. In 27 patients who were hemodynamically unstable, ventricular tachycardia was induced and became noninducible or hemodynamically stable after combination therapy with a class I agent. Among 18 patients who did not have inducible ventricular tachycardia after short-term therapy, eight (44%) had inducible, hemodynamically unstable ventricular tachycardia after long-term treatment with amiodarone. On the other hand, six of the 27 patients who had hemodynamically unstable ventricular tachycardia after short-term therapy had an adequate response after long-term treatment with amiodarone. Therefore an adequate electrophysiologic response after short-term therapy does not guarantee a similar response after long-term treatment, and an inadequate response after short-term therapy does not always predict a similar response after long-term therapy. 
Stress analgesia: the opioid analgesia of long swims suppresses the non-opioid analgesia induced by short swims in mice. In mice, room temperature swimming for as short a period as 15 sec has been found to induce a non-opioid analgesia with a time course of 10-12 min. As the duration of the swim is increased, an opioid analgesia develops with a longer persistence (25-30 min); the development of the opioid analgesia appears to suppress the expression of the non-opioid analgesia so that none of the latter is evident after 3 min swims. The characteristics of the tail-flick nociceptive test are also described. 
Health inequalities among British civil servants: the Whitehall II study The Whitehall study of British civil servants begun in 1967, showed a steep inverse association between social class, as assessed by grade of employment, and mortality from a wide range of diseases. Between 1985 and 1988 we investigated the degree and causes of the social gradient in morbidity in a new cohort of 10,314 civil servants (6900 men, 3414 women) aged 35-55 (the Whitehall II study). Participants were asked to answer a self-administered questionnaire and attend a screening examination. In the 20 years separating the two studies there has been no diminution in social class difference in morbidity: we found an inverse association between employment grade and prevalence of angina, electrocardiogram evidence of ischaemia, and symptoms of chronic bronchitis. Self-perceived health status and symptoms were worse in subjects in lower status jobs. There were clear employment-grade differences in health-risk behaviours including smoking, diet, and exercise, in economic circumstances, in possible effects of early-life environment as reflected by height, in social circumstances at work (eg, monotonous work characterised by low control and low satisfaction), and in social supports. Healthy behaviours should be encouraged across the whole of society; more attention should be paid to the social environments, job design, and the consequences of income inequality. 
Magnesium sulfate reverses experimental delayed cerebral vasospasm after subarachnoid hemorrhage in rats. We induced experimental delayed cerebral vasospasm by the intracisternal injection of greater than 0.5 ml blood in 30 rats. Seventy-two hours later the basilar artery was exposed via the transclival approach and photographed at high-power magnification through an operating microscope. We then evaluated the effect of topical (n = 30) and intravenous (n = 20) magnesium sulfate on the spastic artery by computerized image analysis. A greater than 50% reduction in baseline diameter of the basilar artery was observed in the rats subjected to subarachnoid hemorrhage compared with the 10 controls (p less than 0.0001). Intravenous magnesium sulfate dilated the spastic artery to approximately 75% of the baseline diameter in control rats (p less than 0.0001). Topical magnesium sulfate caused dramatic dilation of the basilar artery in both the control and the subarachnoid hemorrhage groups to near 150% of the baseline diameter in the controls (p less than 0.001). All rats receiving intravenous magnesium sulfate reached therapeutic plasma levels of the ion. Hemodynamic effects were mild and immediately reversible upon cessation of magnesium sulfate administration. We suggest that magnesium has a role in the treatment of subarachnoid hemorrhage-induced vasospasm in humans. 
Comparison of the predictive characteristics of heart rate variability index and left ventricular ejection fraction for all-cause mortality, arrhythmic events and sudden death after acute myocardial infarction. Heart rate (HR) variability index and left ventricular ejection fraction (EF) were compared for the prediction of all-cause mortality, arrhythmic events and sudden death in 385 survivors of acute myocardial infarction. For arrhythmic events, where, for a sensitivity of 75%, HR variability index had a specificity of 76%, EF had a specificity of only 45%. An EF of less than or equal to 40% had a sensitivity of 42% and a specificity of 75% for arrhythmic events; for the same sensitivity an HR variability index of 20 U had a specificity of 92%. An EF less than or equal to 40% had a sensitivity of 40% and a specificity of 73% for sudden death; HR variability index had a specificity of 83% for the same sensitivity. For all cause mortality, where, for a sensitivity of 75%, HR variability index had a specificity of 52%, EF had a specificity of 40%. It is concluded that HR variability index appears a better predictor of important postinfarction arrhythmic complications than left ventricular EF, but both indexes perform equally well in predicting all-cause mortality. 
Iodine-125 seed implantation as an adjunct to surgery in advanced recurrent squamous cell cancer of the head and neck. Survival for extensive recurrent squamous cell carcinomas of the head and neck remains poor, with the major cause of death being local recurrence. Surgical implantation of iodine-125 interstitial seeds allows tumoricidal doses of radiation to be delivered to residual tumor while minimizing radiation doses to the surrounding tissues. From 1978 to 1988, 39 implantations were performed on 35 patients for extensive recurrent squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck. The decision for implantation was based on positive margins or close to resection margins from frozen sections after salvage resection. The determinate 5-year disease-free survival was 41%, with both the overall and no evidence of disease 5-year survivals being 29%. Significant complications occurred in 36% of all cases. This figure increased to 56% when flap reconstruction was required. Possible reasons for this seemingly high complication rate are discussed. Considering the advanced nature of these recurrent carcinomas, surgical resection with iodine-125 seed implantation appears to be an effective method of managing disease that might otherwise be judged unresectable and treated for palliation only. 
Cycling and the older athlete. Cycling provides a dynamic form of aerobic and anaerobic fitness to more than 86 million Americans. It provides a freedom that is attractive to individuals of any age, either sex, and any body type. It does not require specialized experience or coordination. In the older athlete, injuries result primarily from overuse or abuse, and are most common in the upper extremity. Such injuries are most often compressive and inflammatory syndromes. These injuries are in marked contrast to those seen in the younger cyclist. Both groups have a low and similar incidence of accident. Overuse injuries can be treated effectively by altering training technique, correcting rider malposition, and decreasing excessive stress, in conjunction with appropriate medical management. Prevention of injury (particularly overuse) is the key to avoiding recurrence. Appropriate frame size, rider position, personalized training techniques, and clothing are essential in the older athlete in whom change is poorly tolerated. Fitness is preserved by regular cycling, possibly by the slowing of the degenerative process, while relieving mental stress and providing "fun sport.". 
The first epidemic of dengue hemorrhagic fever in the People's Republic of China. The first epidemic of dengue in China associated with significant severe and fatal hemorrhagic disease which met the World Health Organization case definition occurred on Hainan Island in 1985-1986. The epidemic began in Zhan County in September 1985, spread throughout the coastal areas, and ultimately involved 13 counties and cities of the island in 1986. The mosquito vector was Aedes aegypti. The morbidity associated with dengue infection on Hainan Island was 1,913 per 100,000 residents, with a case fatality rate of 0.25%. Severe disease was more prevalent in the 10-29-year-old age group. Principal clinical features in laboratory-confirmed cases were fever, osteoarthralgia, hemorrhage and/or shock, and thrombocytopenia. Complications such as acute intravascular hemolysis, diffuse intravascular coagulation, hemoconcentration, pleural effusion, altered mentality, and pneumonia were also observed. One hundred twenty-five isolates of dengue 2 virus were recovered from acute-phase serum samples from 278 patients, and 5 strains of this same virus serotype were isolated from 5 pools of adult Ae. aegypti. 
Neglected topics in the treatment of chronic pain patients--relapse, noncompliance, and adherence enhancement. Although published treatment outcome studies for chronic pain have provided favorable support for the efficacy of many pain clinics and the use of specific modalities such as biofeedback and relaxation, there are several factors that mitigate against euphoria. Two related factors that influence interpretation of these reported outcomes are discussed, namely, noncompliance with therapeutic recommendations during treatment and subsequent to treatment termination, and relapse. Conceptual and methodological problems for establishing the prevalence of noncompliance and relapse are reviewed. Several factors that contribute to noncompliance (individual differences, nature of disease or injury, characteristics of the prescribed treatment regimen, health-care provider-patient relationship, and contextual) are discussed. The literature reveals that noncompliance with treatment regimens is quite prevalent across diverse treatment modalities and pain syndromes. The incidence of relapse following initially successful treatment of persistent pain also appears to be high, ranging from 30% to 60%. Studies on arthritis and heterogeneous pain clinic populations suggest that noncompliance and relapse are related; however, this association is less well established for headache patients. Strategies for assessing compliance (i.e., self-report, behavioral, biochemical, and clinical outcome) and the perspectives' of patients and health-care providers on the application of self-care recommendations are discussed. Strategic planning and adherence enhancement tactics to facilitate maintenance of post-treatment gains are described. 
Ocular findings in Turcot syndrome (glioma-polyposis). Turcot syndrome is a hereditary condition characterized by multiple, adenomatous gastrointestinal polyps associated with neuroepithelial tumors of the central nervous system. The authors examined a patient with Turcot syndrome who had multiple regions of congenital hypertrophy of the retinal pigment epithelium (CHRPE) with areas of surrounding hypopigmentation in the fundi of both eyes. Multiple, bilateral patches of CHRPE have been reported in patients with familial adenomatous polyposis and Gardner syndrome. This finding is thought to be a sensitive and specific clinical marker for these conditions and useful for predicting the presence and development of colorectal polyposis. Our findings provide further evidence that familial adenomatous polyposis, Gardner syndrome, and Turcot syndrome may be related conditions representing the variable phenotypic expression of a single, autosomal dominant genetic disorder. Children and young adults with multiple patches of CHRPE and a family history of adenomatous polyposis may be at increased risk for the development of central nervous system tumors as well as gastrointestinal polyps. 
High risk of squamous cell carcinoma of the cervix for women with HLA-DQw3. Many immune responses are controlled by genes of the major histocompatibility complex (MHC). In man these include the loci encoding the HLA-A, -B, -C, -DR, -DQ and -DP antigens, and many diseases have been linked with these. But attempts to identify HLA genes in man that might explain why an immune response against malignant tumours should be ineffective have so far been disappointing, apart from the association reported between the HLA-DR1 antigen and a susceptibility to a rare carcinoma of the thyroid gland. Here we describe another strong connection between a common malignant tumour and an HLA antigen, namely between HLA-DQw3 and squamous cell carcinoma of the cervix: from the 1988 United States tumour registry, 1 in every 63 newborn girls will develop this invasive cancer. We found that 88% of 66 patients had the leukocyte antigen HLA-DQw3 when it would normally be expected in only 50% of individuals. In animals the immune system and the MHC act in defence against virally induced tumours, but until now there has been no evidence that they do so in humans: as squamous cell carcinoma is probably virally induced, our discovery of its association with an HLA antigen will be important to the understanding of the immunogenetic basis of a susceptibility to this tumour. 
Aerosol pentamidine for secondary prophylaxis of AIDS-related Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia. A randomized, placebo-controlled study. OBJECTIVE: To assess the safety and efficacy of aerosol pentamidine for secondary prophylaxis of Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia in patients with the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS). PARTICIPANTS: Patients recovering from a first confirmed episode of AIDS-related P. carinii pneumonia who had no evidence of either another active AIDS-defining opportunistic infection or another pulmonary abnormality were considered eligible for the study but were included only if they had received no immunomodulators or antiretroviral agents other than zidovudine within 30 days of entry. One hundred sixty-two patients were randomized and started on the study drug. INTERVENTION: Patients were randomly assigned to receive aerosol pentamidine, 60 mg per dose, or placebo, delivered using a hand-held, patient-triggered, ultrasonic nebulizer. The induction phase of treatment consisted of 5 doses over 14 days, followed by a maintenance phase beginning on day 21 and consisting of one dose every 2 weeks. RESULTS: Thirty-two cases of P. carinii pneumonia were diagnosed before the termination of the trial; 27 cases occurred among 78 patients receiving placebo and 5 occurred among 84 patients receiving aerosol pentamidine. Estimates of the cumulative relapse rate of P. carinii pneumonia by 24 weeks were 50% and 9% for the placebo and pentamidine groups, respectively (P less than 0.001). Adverse reactions attributed to the study drug occurred in 15 of 78 patients receiving placebo and in 28 of 84 patients receiving pentamidine (P = 0.04). These were all mild or moderate in severity and did not preclude continued administration of the study drug. CONCLUSION: Intermittent therapy with aerosol pentamidine is highly effective and well tolerated as secondary prophylaxis for AIDS-related P. carinii pneumonia. 
CT of the gastrointestinal tract: principles and interpretation. The experience accumulated in daily abdominal CT scanning and CT evaluation of gastrointestinal lesions has generated helpful technical guidelines and some reliable principles of interpretation. These general principles are briefly discussed in this review, and the importance of performing a CT examination that is adequate for the detection and evaluation of gastrointestinal lesions is stressed. CT features useful in differentiating benign from malignant lesions, limitations and pitfalls in CT interpretation, overlap in the CT appearance, and classical CT features leading to specific diagnoses are described and illustrated. Although CT is established as one of the most important techniques for imaging the gastrointestinal tract, it should be used selectively and only in the context of appropriate clinical and conventional radiologic examination. CT should not be regarded as competing with, but as complementing, barium examination of the gastrointestinal tract. 
Impairment of left ventricular function during coronary angioplastic occlusion evaluated with a nonimaging scintillation probe. Impairment of left ventricular function during controlled myocardial ischemia induced by coronary angioplasty has been reported from angiographic and echocardiographic studies. Ejection fraction, peak ejection, peak filling rates, and end-systolic and end-diastolic volumes were investigated before, during and after coronary occlusion on-line with a nonimaging scintillation probe. The study consisted of 18 patients (mean age 59 +/- 10 years) with coronary artery stenosis of greater than 70%. During balloon inflation of 60 seconds' duration, coronary occlusion pressure was 31.6 +/- 12 mm Hg. There was no significant change in heart rate. Delay between first and second dilatation was 109 +/- 63 seconds. Ejection fraction decreased from 53 +/- 16 to 40 +/- 12% (first dilatation, p less than 0.01) and to 39 +/- 14% (second dilatation, p less than 0.01) and recovered to 51 +/- 16% 5 minutes after the second dilatation. Peak ejection rate was significantly reduced during the first and second balloon inflations. Peak filling rate decreased from 2.5 +/- 0.8 to 2.0 +/- 0.7 end-diastolic volume.s-1 (first dilatation, p less than 0.01) and to 1.8 +/- 0.7 end-diastolic volume.s-1 (second dilatation, p less than 0.01) and remained reduced at 2.2 +/- 0.7 end-diastolic volume.s-1 (p = not significant) at 5 minutes after the second dilatation. End-systolic and end-diastolic volumes increased significantly during the first and second dilatations and returned to normal after dilatation. It is concluded that short, controlled myocardial ischemia during coronary angioplasty leads to a decrease in systolic and diastolic left ventricular function. Sequential dilatations do not further decrease function if a sufficient interval is kept. 
Severe hypertension with segmental renal infarction following surgical removal of a retroperitoneal malignant hemangiopericytoma: a case report. Severe hypertension developed in a fifty-five year-old woman after surgical removal of a retroperitoneal tumor, when the renal artery was injured. Renal arteriography after the surgery demonstrated a segmental infarction of the right kidney. A close relationship between activation of the renin-angiotensin system and the development of severe hypertension was observed. Satisfactory control of blood pressure concomitant with reduction of plasma renin activity was achieved by a combination of an angiotensin-converting anzyme inhibitor, beta-blocking agent, and calcium-entry blocker. The mechanism of activation of the renin-angiotensin system in renal infarction is discussed. 
Delayed time to peak serum myoglobin level as an indicator of cardiac dysfunction following open heart surgery. Postoperative changes in serum myoglobin levels have been studied in 47 patients undergoing open heart surgery. The patients were retrospectively divided into two groups according to the time to peak myoglobin level during reperfusion. In 38 patients, myoglobin levels increased rapidly to a peak within 3 hours after reperfusion, after which it was cleared from the blood (group 1). Contrarily, a rise in myoglobin levels was persistent for 24 hours and its time to peak was greater than 3 hours after reperfusion in nine patients (group 2). There were no differences in preoperative and early reperfusion (within 1 hour of reperfusion) values of myoglobin between the two groups. At 3, 6, and 12 hours of reperfusion, myoglobin levels were significantly greater in group 2: 448 +/- 196 vs 1,149 +/- 900 ng/ml, 359 +/- 172 vs 2,653 +/- 3,179 ng/ml, 184 +/- 95 vs 1,896 +/- 1,387 ng/ml, respectively, p less than 0.0001 in each. The maximum activities of both myoglobin and CK-MB were significantly higher in group 2 (myoglobin-max: 771 +/- 257 vs 3,221 +/- 3,024 ng/ml, p less than 0.0001; CK-MBmax: 107 +/- 60 vs 227 +/- 219 IU/L, p less than 0.005). Five of nine patients in group 2 required post-operative assistance with intra-aortic balloon pumping (p less than 0.0005 compared with one of 38 in group 1) and perioperative myocardial infarction developed in three patients (33.3 percent) in this group (p less than 0.005 compared with 0 percent in group 1). Thus, patients with a delayed peak of serum myoglobin level exhibited detrimental cardiac failure postoperatively. These findings suggest that myocardial injury accelerated by reperfusion following ischemia might progress in these patients. 
Prior poliomyelitis-reduced capillary supply and metabolic enzyme content in hypertrophic slow-twitch (type I) muscle fibres. Capillary supply and oxidative and glycolytic enzyme activities were determined in muscle biopsies from the tibialis anterior muscle in six prior polio patients and a control group. The polio patients, who had paresis and atrophy, but were able to walk normally by making maximal use of all remaining anterior tibial motor units, showed type I (slow-twitch) muscle fibre predominance with a mean (SD) of 98 (2%) type I fibres versus 81 (8)% in the controls (p less than 0.01) and muscle fibre hypertrophy, the average type I fibre cross-sectional area being 108% (p less than 0.005) larger than in the controls. The number of capillaries per muscle fibre was not significantly different from that in the control group, but with the increased muscle fibre area in the polio patients, the capillary density was significantly lower. The number of capillaries in contact with type I fibres relative to fibre area was 40% lower in the patients than in the controls (p less than 0.005). The levels of citrate synthase and phosphofructokinase were significantly lower (38% and 33%, respectively, p less than 0.05) in the patients than in the controls, indicating decreased oxidative and glycolytic potentials in the muscle fibres of the polio patients. It is proposed that the abnormal high-frequency activation of all remaining motor units during each step cycle recorded in these patients constitutes a stimulus for type I muscle fibre predominance and hypertrophy but that the overall low muscle usage results in a decreased stimulation of capillary proliferation and mitochondrial enzyme synthesis. 
Increased circulating levels of bromocriptine after vaginal compared with oral administration. OBJECTIVE: To compare the circulating levels of bromocriptine after oral and vaginal administration of the drug. DESIGN: Experimental PARTICIPANTS: Seven ovulatory female volunteers and one hyperprolactinemic patient. INTERVENTIONS: Ovulatory volunteers were randomized to receive either oral or vaginal bromocriptine (2.5 mg). In a second session, the subjects were crossed-over to bromocriptine by the alternate route. An additional hyperprolactinemic patient received vaginal bromocriptine only. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Serum bromocriptine and prolactin (PRL) levels were measured hourly for 12 hours in the normal volunteers and for 10 hours in the hyperprolactinemic patient. RESULTS: Circulating bromocriptine levels were significantly higher after vaginal bromocriptine after the 7th hour (P less than 0.05). The reduction in serum PRL was significantly greater after oral administration between 2 and 6 hours. CONCLUSIONS: Vaginally administered bromocriptine may result in a reduction in the overall dose required, thereby improving compliance without compromising therapeutic efficacy. 
Left neglect for near but not far space in man. It has been suggested that, among the many visual areas of the human brain, there might be one set of spatial maps specialized for 'near' (peripersonal) and another for 'far' (extrapersonal) space. A distinction between 'grasping distance' and 'walking distance', or between a 'reaching field' and a pointing or throwing field has commonly been made. Evidence for such a division has been found in monkeys. Unilateral ablation of the frontal eye field (area 8) produces a more prominent inattention (or 'neglect') for objects in contralesional far space than in near space; by contrast, unilateral ablation of frontal area 6, which receives direct projections from area 7b (the rostral part of the inferior parietal lobules) results in inattention to visual stimuli limited to contralesional near space. Despite predictions that comparable dissociations should be found in man, there has been no convincing evidence. We report here such evidence in a patient with a unilateral right hemisphere stroke. Within peripersonal space, he showed severe left visuo-spatial neglect on conventional tests, including the highly sensitive task of line bisection. When line bisection was performed in extrapersonal space, neglect was abolished or attenuated. 
Perinatal outcome of fetal complete atrioventricular block: a multicenter experience. The clinical course and outcome of 55 fetuses with complete atrioventricular (AV) block detected prenatally were studied to identify factors that affect the natural history of this lesion. In 29 fetuses (53%) complete AV block was associated with complex structural heart defects, usually left atrial isomerism (n = 17) or discordant AV connection (n = 7). The other 26 fetuses had normal cardiac anatomy; in 19 cases the mother had connective tissue disease or tested positive for antinuclear antibodies. Six fetuses showed progression from sinus rhythm or second degree block to complete AV block. Of the 55 pregnancies, 5 were terminated and 24 fetuses or neonates died; at the end of the neonatal period 26 fetuses were still alive. Fetal or neonatal death correlated significantly with the presence of structural heart defects (4 of 29 surviving, p less than 0.001), hydrops (0 of 22 surviving, p less than 0.001), an atrial rate less than or equal to 120 beats/min (1 of 12 surviving, p less than 0.005) or a ventricular rate less than or equal to 55 beats/min (3 of 21 surviving, p less than 0.001). Mean atrial and ventricular rates were higher in surviving than in nonsurviving fetuses (142 +/- 8 vs. 127 +/- 21 beats/min, p less than 0.002; 64 +/- 8 vs. 52 +/- 8 beats/min, p less than 0.001, respectively). A slow atrial rate, however, was frequently associated with left atrial isomerism. 
Intrapericardial OK-432 instillation for the management of malignant pericardial effusion. Ten patients with malignant pericardial effusion were treated with intrapericardial injection of OK-432 (penicillin-treated and heat-treated lyophilized powder of the substrain of Streptococcus pyogenes A3). After intrapericardial insertion of a catheter, a maximal volume of pericardial fluid was withdrawn with cytologic confirmation of malignancy. Five or 10 Klinische Einheit (KE) (KE is a unit used to express the strength of a preparation) of OK-432 diluted in 20 ml of saline was injected into the pericardial space in seven and three patients, respectively. It was repeated in case of reaccumulation. Seven patients were treated only once and the remaining three required a second treatment. Complete control of pericardial effusion was achieved in all patients for an average of 329 days (range, 54 to 790 days). Fever and chest pain were experienced in six and five patients, respectively, but were controlled with antipyretics. Two of three patients who received 10 KE of OK-432 experienced hypotension that was successfully controlled with vasopressor drugs with or without reaspiration of pericardial fluid. Rapid reactive reaccumulation of the pericardial fluid was thought to be a cause of hypotension. A follow-up computed tomography (CT) scan was performed in seven patients and a thickened pericardium was noticed in five; no patients had constrictive pericarditis. These results suggest that intrapericardial administration of 5 KE of OK-432 is an effective and safe treatment for malignant pericardial effusion. 
Digitally-directed transrectal biopsy using Biopty gun versus transrectal needle aspiration: comparison of diagnostic yield and comfort. A technique for digitally-directed core biopsy using the Biopty device and prospective comparison of accuracy and comfort, using this technique simultaneously with transrectal needle aspiration, are presented. To better estimate the true prevalence of carcinoma in the study population, a repeat combined procedure was performed on all subjects who did not have carcinoma confirmed on the initial core biopsies. All procedures were done by one investigator and all pathology reviewed by one senior pathologist. A total of 180 combined procedures were performed on 100 consecutive patients with palpably abnormal prostates; 30 carcinomas were detected. Digitally-directed Biopty biopsy yielded a sensitivity rate of 87 percent compared with 57 percent for needle aspiration (p less than 0.05). Using a numerical comfort scale, the Biopty device was also rated less painful than needle aspiration (p = 0.0001). The morbidity of the combined procedure was minimal, with a minor complication rate of 2.2 percent. No infections occurred. 
Epidemiologic correlates of sporadic amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. We evaluated 74 selected patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and 201 matched controls for risk factors for ALS by a case-control design and a sequential questionnaire/interview technique to quantitate biographic data. We analyzed occupational and recreational data only for 47 male patients and 47 corresponding patient controls; data for women were insufficient. We used nonparametric analyses to evaluate five primary comparisons of ALS patients with controls: (1) more hard physical labor, p not significant (NS); (2) greater frequency of neurodegenerative disease in family members, p NS; (3) greater exposure to lead, p less than 0.05; (4) more years lived in a rural community, p NS; and (5) more trauma or major surgery, p NS. Men with ALS had worked more frequently at blue-collar jobs (although not a statistically significant difference, p = 0.10) and at welding or soldering (p less than 0.01). These results suggest that there may be an association between ALS in men and exposure to lead vapor. The limited nature of the association favors a multifactorial etiologic mechanism of ALS. 
Proportionate mortality trends: 1950 through 1986 Mortality trends in the United States from 1950 through 1986 were analyzed for the conditions that are or have recently been among the six leading causes of death. The age-adjusted mortality rate for all causes has decreased from 841.5 to 541.7 per 100,000 population. Cause-specific, age-adjusted mortality rates have declined from 1950 through 1986 for cerebrovascular disease, injuries, perinatal conditions, heart disease, and influenza and pneumonia. Time trends in the proportion of persons dying of each of these diseases, however, have varied; the proportion dying of cerebrovascular disease, injuries, and perinatal conditions has decreased, and the proportion of persons dying of heart disease and influenza and pneumonia has remained fairly stable from 1950 through 1986. During this same time, age-adjusted death rates have increased for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and have remained fairly stable for malignant neoplasms, while the proportions of persons dying of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and malignant neoplasms have increased dramatically. For people aged 35 to 64 years, malignant neoplasms have now overtaken heart disease as the leading cause of death. For those aged 65 years and older, heart disease remains the leading cause of death, accounting for almost 50% of all deaths in persons 85 years and older. 
Delayed time to peak serum myoglobin level as an indicator of cardiac dysfunction following open heart surgery. Postoperative changes in serum myoglobin levels have been studied in 47 patients undergoing open heart surgery. The patients were retrospectively divided into two groups according to the time to peak myoglobin level during reperfusion. In 38 patients, myoglobin levels increased rapidly to a peak within 3 hours after reperfusion, after which it was cleared from the blood (group 1). Contrarily, a rise in myoglobin levels was persistent for 24 hours and its time to peak was greater than 3 hours after reperfusion in nine patients (group 2). There were no differences in preoperative and early reperfusion (within 1 hour of reperfusion) values of myoglobin between the two groups. At 3, 6, and 12 hours of reperfusion, myoglobin levels were significantly greater in group 2: 448 +/- 196 vs 1,149 +/- 900 ng/ml, 359 +/- 172 vs 2,653 +/- 3,179 ng/ml, 184 +/- 95 vs 1,896 +/- 1,387 ng/ml, respectively, p less than 0.0001 in each. The maximum activities of both myoglobin and CK-MB were significantly higher in group 2 (myoglobin-max: 771 +/- 257 vs 3,221 +/- 3,024 ng/ml, p less than 0.0001; CK-MBmax: 107 +/- 60 vs 227 +/- 219 IU/L, p less than 0.005). Five of nine patients in group 2 required post-operative assistance with intra-aortic balloon pumping (p less than 0.0005 compared with one of 38 in group 1) and perioperative myocardial infarction developed in three patients (33.3 percent) in this group (p less than 0.005 compared with 0 percent in group 1). Thus, patients with a delayed peak of serum myoglobin level exhibited detrimental cardiac failure postoperatively. These findings suggest that myocardial injury accelerated by reperfusion following ischemia might progress in these patients. 
Altered corticospinal projections to lower limb motoneurons in subjects with cerebral palsy. The projections of cortical neurons activated by transcranial magnetic stimulation to the motoneurons of lower limb muscles were examined in 22 normal subjects and 14 subjects with cerebral palsy (CP). In normal subjects, magnetic stimulation produced strong facilitation of tibialis anterior (TA) motoneurons, but little or no facilitation of soleus (SOL) motoneurons. This differential facilitation of TA and SOL motoneurons was observed at all stimulus sites on the scalp and all stimulus intensities at which responses could be elicited. In subjects with CP, magnetic stimulation produced almost equal facilitation of TA and SOL motoneurons. This could not be explained by differences in the excitability of the respective motoneuron pools. It is postulated that the projections from the motor cortex to spinal motoneurons are altered in CP. These abnormal projections may contribute to the impairment of voluntary movements experienced by these subjects. 
HLA-DR antigen expression on peripheral blood monocytes correlates with surgical infection. Monocyte human leukocyte antigen-DR (HLA-DR) expression has correlated closely with clinical outcome in severely injured patients at high risk for infection. Monocytes from 77 asymptomatic volunteers expressed HLA-DR antigen with minimal variability in respect to age, gender, race, time of day or year, or serum alcohol level. Patients who developed infection after elective laparotomy had a significantly lower mean percentage of monocytes expressing HLA-DR antigen and a lower mean fluorescent intensity than uninfected patients (p less than 0.05). Severely infected nonsurgical patients had significantly lower values than normal volunteers (p less than 0.01), and the mean fluorescent intensity of those who died from infection was significantly lower than that of those who survived (p less than 0.05). Patients on immunosuppressive regimens after renal transplantation had levels of HLA-DR expression similar to those of the volunteers. Monocyte HLA-DR expression was found to be a reliable marker of clinical infection and showed remarkable reproducibility within the normal uninfected study population. 
The natural history of multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1. Highly uncommon or highly unrecognized? Among 2000 descendants of an English immigrant to Tasmania, Australia, the diagnosis of multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1 was found to be very highly probable or highly probable in 130 and moderately probable in 22. Another 242 children and siblings were 50% likely to have inherited this dominant gene. In all age groups, especially the elderly, the majority of affected members had symptoms of only one endocrine disorder or were asymptomatic. In teenagers, the most common presentation was pituitary lesions and the second most common presentation was insulinomas. Frequently, pituitary lesions or insulinomas developed before any parathyroid lesions could be detected. Elevation of gastrin levels, usually associated with hypercalcemia, was rarely seen in patients younger than 25 years. The classic presentation with symptoms of multiple endocrinopathy may represent only a small fraction of these patients in the community. 
Identification of perilymph proteins by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis. Perilymph has a total protein component that is quantitatively distinct from serum and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). The goal of this research was to determine if perilymph contains any qualitatively unique protein constituents that will distinguish it from serum or CSF. To test this hypothesis, matched sets of perilymph, serum, and CSF were obtained from 18 guinea pigs and seven human subjects. The purity of each sample was assured by measurement of the protein concentration of each sample and comparison of this parameter to known normal values for perilymph, serum, and CSF. Each sample was then subjected to two-dimensional gel electrophoresis, separating proteins by isoelectric point in the horizontal dimension and by relative molecular weight in the vertical dimension. All gels were processed under precisely identical physical conditions by use of a diamine silver stain. A small number of perilymph proteins not found in plasma were identified in both the guinea pig and the human specimens. The finding of unique perilymph proteins may permit the development of a sensitive marker that will aid in the diagnosis of perilymph fistula. 
Association of supraglottic and gingival idiopathic plasmacytosis. Three cases of gingival plasmacytosis in which laryngeal symptoms eventually developed are reported. Two of the three patients underwent endoscopic biopsy of supraglottic lesions, which proved to be similar to those in the oral cavity. The third patient had supraglottic erythema only and was not subjected to biopsy. Known etiologic factors associated with plasma cell gingivitis were excluded. Treatment with oral and topical steroids resulted in good control of the lesions. 
Prognostic significance of acute epilepsia partialis continua. We present 3 patients in whom epilepsia partialis continua was the presenting sign of an acute, rapidly evolving and catastrophic neurologic illness. Initial seizures were partial simple (i.e., eye deviation in one, finger twitching in one) which progressed to multifocal partial seizures. The course of the epilepsia partialis continua was 36-41 days. Prognosis was uniformly poor (i.e., death in 2, vegetative state in 1); therefore, epilepsia partialis continua in the context of an acute neurologic illness may herald a grim outcome. 
Effects of electrophysiologic testing of the automatic implantable cardioverter-defibrillator on left ventricular systolic function and diastolic filling. We investigated the effects of electrophysiologic testing of the automatic implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (AICD) on left ventricular systolic function and diastolic filling in 12 patients. Ventricular tachycardia or ventricular fibrillation was induced by programmed electrical stimulation and alternating-current, respectively. Patients were studied before and immediately after, 10 minutes after, and 1 hour after defibrillation by the AICD using M-mode, two-dimensional, and pulsed Doppler echocardiography. Immediately after defibrillation, increases were found in the peak early filling velocity (70 +/- 10 cm/sec to 84 +/- 24 cm/sec, p less than 0.01), peak early-to-atrial filling velocity ratio (1.05 +/- 0.21 to 1.29 +/- 0.26, p less than 0.005), and maximum rate of diastolic chamber enlargement (82 +/- 26 mm/sec to 102 +/- 44 mm/sec, p less than 0.05). These changes were not evident at 10 minutes and 1 hour. Cardiac output and ejection fraction were unchanged after defibrillation. Heart rate and diastolic filling time were unchanged. We conclude that electrophysiologic testing of the AICD does not impair left ventricular function in the immediate to 1-hour period after defibrillation. Left ventricular systolic function is unchanged and diastolic filling is enhanced. 
Association between plasma viscosity and blood pressure. Results from the MONICA-project Augsburg. The relationship between determinants of blood viscosity and blood pressure (BP) variables was studied in a large sample of a population aged 25 to 64 years. Plasma viscosity, hemoglobin, and total serum protein were examined. Systolic and diastolic BP and the prevalence of hypertension showed a crude positive association with plasma viscosity levels in both sexes. Age, body mass index, and total serum protein appeared to have a confounding effect on this relationship, whereas hemoglobin, smoking behavior, and alcohol consumption did not. A crude positive association was also found between total serum protein levels and the prevalence of hypertension in men and women; however, since total serum protein was treated as a covariable, no further analyses were carried out. In contrast to findings reported in the literature, hemoglobin levels were not correlated with BP variables in either sex. After adjusting for all confounders, a significant main effect of plasma viscosity still was found. However, the magnitude of the effect was not as large as for body mass index, a well-established risk variable for hypertension. These results indicate that BP is positively associated with plasma viscosity. Whether increased plasma viscosity in hypertension constitutes a primary or a secondary phenomenon remains to be answered. Since plasma viscosity is significantly associated with hypertension but any BP variable, increased levels of plasma proteins (particularly fibrinogen as the main determinant of plasma viscosity) may represent the cause for elevated plasma viscosity. This might contribute to persistently increased resistance to blood flow on the microcirculatory level in arterial hypertension. 
Fibroblast stimulation in schistosomiasis. XI. Purification to apparent homogeneity of fibroblast-stimulating factor-1, an acidic heparin-binding growth factor produced by schistosomal egg granulomas. Liver fibrosis is the most serious complication of infection with Schistosoma mansoni and Schistosoma japonicum and is responsible for severe morbidity and mortality in hundreds of thousands of patients in many Third World nations. The pathogenesis of this condition remains to be elucidated. We proposed that certain cytokines produced by cells that comprise the chronic granulomas that surround the helminth eggs within the liver initiate hepatic fibrogenesis. We now report our successful purification to apparent homogeneity of the egg granuloma-derived fibroblast mitogen. The high affinity of this factor for heparin (elutes from heparin-Sepharose with 1.5 M NaCl) facilitates its purification by a two-step procedure, and identifies the cytokine as a heparin-binding growth factor (HBGF). Furthermore, because it has an isoelectric point approximately equal to 6.2, it has one of the characteristics of a class 1 (acidic) HBGF. We immunized rabbits with the purified factor and observed that the resulting antibodies (IgG) detected the factor but not acidic fibroblast growth factor (the prototypic class 1 HBGF) either by dot-blot ELISA or neutralization of biologic activity. The granuloma product and fibroblast growth factor also differ in target-cell specificity and amino acid composition. On the basis of these distinctions, we have designated the granuloma-derived mitogen fibroblast-stimulating factor-1. With the availability of purified fibroblast-stimulating factor-1 and the future analysis of its amino acid sequence, its structural relationship to other mesenchymal growth factors can be determined. 
Mixed venous oxygen saturation as a guide to tissue oxygenation and prognosis in patients with acute myocardial infarction. The relation of mixed venous oxygen saturation and the cardiac index to tissue oxygenation and prognosis was investigated in 119 patients with acute myocardial infarction. There was a positive correlation between mixed venous oxygen saturation and the cardiac index in 97 survivors and 22 nonsurvivors, but a significantly lower mixed venous oxygen saturation level at the same level of cardiac index was observed in nonsurvivors compared with survivors. Results of multivariate analysis with mixed venous oxygen saturation and the cardiac index indicated that only mixed venous oxygen saturation was significantly related to survival and to hyperlactacidemia. Oxygen delivery to tissues declined significantly in nonsurvivors because of a lower cardiac index and a lower hemoglobin concentration in these patients than in survivors. However, at the same level of oxygen delivery to tissues, nonsurvivors had a significantly higher rate of oxygen consumption leading to a correspondingly greater decrease in mixed venous oxygen saturation, suggesting that a greater increase in oxygen demand was also observed in nonsurvivors than in survivors. Thus mixed venous oxygen saturation after acute myocardial infarction is a better predictor of hyperlactacidemia and survival than the cardiac index, and this may be associated with an increased oxygen demand and an impaired oxygen transport system in seriously ill patients. 
Isolated muscle hypertrophy as a sign of radicular or peripheral nerve injury. Two patients with isolated neurogenic hypertrophy of the trapezius muscle due to accessory nerve injury and a patient with neurogenic hypertrophy of the anterior tibial muscle due to chronic radicular lesion L4 are described. Electromyography of the affected muscles showed dense continuing spontaneous discharges of complex potentials. Muscle biopsy performed in two patients showed abundant hypertrophic muscle fibres, identified in one case by ATP-ase reaction as being of predominantly type I. In the majority of previously reported patients with neurogenic muscle hypertrophy confined to the calf muscle, a passive stretch mechanism was suggested as a cause of the hypertrophy. It is assumed that the excessive spontaneous muscle activity gave rise to the hypertrophy in these patients. This may also be true in previously reported patients with neurogenic hypertrophy and similar spontaneous activity in electromyography. 
Heterotopic ossification and peripheral nerve entrapment: early diagnosis and excision. Heterotopic ossification can occur in neurologic disorders, burns, musculoskeletal trauma, and metabolic disorders. In addition to producing the complications of contracture, skin breakdown, and pain, it can cause peripheral nerve entrapment. Nerve entrapment due to heterotopic ossification may be misdiagnosed, and it is difficult to evaluate and treat without recurrence. Computed tomography is especially useful in localization before surgical release of the entrapped nerve. Resection of heterotopic ossification can be successful using disodium etidronate to decrease the risk of recurrence, and resection can improve range of motion and nerve function. Two case studies of nerve entrapment due to heterotopic ossification are presented with the results of computed tomography localization, successful resection, and long-term follow-up. Clinicians should be aware of this complication and the potential for rapid nerve injury. If heterotopic ossification is causing clinically significant peripheral nerve entrapment, early surgical treatment may be indicated, and may be successful. 
Primary fibromyalgia and the irritable bowel syndrome: different expressions of a common pathogenetic process. Primary fibromyalgia (PFM) and the irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) are both common conditions which account for 30% or more of referrals to rheumatology and gastroenterology clinics. An association between symptoms in PFM and IBS has been suggested but the frequency with which they coexist has not been assessed. The aim of this study was to examine the prevalence of each condition in groups of patients with PFM and IBS compared to normal and disease control populations. We studied four patient groups, 20 patients in each group, with PFM, IBS, inflammatory arthritis, inflammatory bowel disease and also 20 normal controls. Using strict diagnostic criteria, each group was assessed by two investigators for symptoms and signs of PFM and IBS. Sigmoidoscopy was performed when indicated. Results indicate that 70% (14/20) of the PFM patients had IBS and 65% (13/20) of the IBS patients had PFM. This compared with the control groups where 12% (7/60) and 10% (6/60) had PFM and IBS respectively. In conclusion, these results indicate that PFM and IBS frequently coexist. A common pathogenetic mechanism for both conditions is therefore suggested. 
Effects of sympathectomy in a model of causalgiform pain produced by partial sciatic nerve injury in rats. In a previous report we presented a novel behavioral model of neuropathic pain disorders, produced in rat by a unilateral ligation of about half of the sciatic nerve. The model is characterized by rapid onset of behaviors suggesting spontaneous pain and disordered responses to non-noxious and noxious stimuli. These include reduced withdrawal thresholds to repetitive touch in the partially deafferented skin ('touched-evoked hyperesthesia'), touch-evoked allodynia, reduced withdrawal thresholds to noxious thermal stimuli and exaggerated responses to noxious heat and mechanical stimuli ('thermal hyperalgesia'). Some of these disorders are seen at mirror image sites on the hind limb opposite the lesion. These disorder start within hours after partial nerve injury, last many months and are very similar to causalgia in humans following partial nerve injury. Since sympathetic efferent activity is known to aggravate causalgia in humans and sympathectomy is known to relieve it, we studied the effect of changing sympathetic outflow in the rat model. Reversible sympathectomy was carried out using guanethidine injected intraperitoneally in 3 experiments, each at a different time in relation to the partial nerve injury. We found that: (1) sympathectomy performed several months postoperatively alleviated the sensory disorders bilaterally; (2) sympathectomy prior to nerve injury partially prevented the appearance of thermal hyperalgesia but did not affect hyperesthesia to repetitive touch; and (3) sympathectomy at the time of nerve injury aggravated the sensory disorders during the first few days. As maintenance and production of the sensory disorders in this animal model depended on sympathetic nervous outflow, we conclude that the rats were suffering from a syndrome analogous to sympathetically maintained causalgia in man. 
Gastric antral vascular ectasia associated with gastric carcinoma. Gastric antral vascular ectasia (GAVE), or watermelon stomach, is an uncommon cause of chronic gastrointestinal blood loss and iron deficiency anemia. Although GAVE has not previously been reported in association with gastric cancer, it is often associated with atrophic gastritis and pernicious anemia, which are known risk factors for gastric malignancy. We report a 72-yr-old woman with pernicious anemia who was found to have GAVE associated with adenosquamous carcinoma of the gastric cardia and adenocarcinoma in situ of the pylorus. In view of recent reports of the use of endoscopic modalities rather than surgical resection to treat GAVE, our case alerts endoscopists to the possibility of coexisting carcinoma. 
Life-threatening cervico-mediastinal haematoma after carotid sinus massage. Retropharyngeal and cervico-mediastinal haematomas are rare but potentially fatal entities. The potential for airway compression necessitates rapid assessment and treatment. A cervico-mediastinal haematoma following carotid sinus massage which required cervical drainage is presented. This is a life-threatening event demanding a high index of suspicion. A review of the literature and indications for treatment are discussed. 
Ultrasound diagnosis of an obstructive cardiac rhabdomyoma with severe hydrops and hypoplastic lungs. A case report. Cardiac rhabdomyomas of the fetus and neonate are benign cardiac muscle hamartomas with an incidence of 0.027% in pediatric autopsies. This is the third reported case of prenatally diagnosed cardiac rhabdomyoma, the second with severe hydrops and the only one associated with aortic valve hypoplasia and hypoplastic lungs. 
Nausea and vomiting with use of a patient-controlled analgesia system. The incidence of nausea and vomiting following patient controlled analgesia and intramuscular morphine injections on demand was compared in a double-blind randomised study of 32 healthy patients undergoing elective cholecystectomy. There were no significant differences between the two groups in mean 24 hour postoperative morphine consumption, subjective experience of pain, nausea and sedation assessed by visual linear analogue scoring, and the postoperative requirements for antiemetic therapy. 
Potential availability of cadaver organs for transplantation OBJECTIVE--To determine the potential number of cadaver kidney donors by applying defined donor criteria to people dying in hospital. DESIGN--Prospective study of all deaths occurring in 21 hospitals from 1 September 1988 to 31 August 1989. Questionnaires were administered to medical and nursing staff and families of potential donors aged 1-69. SETTING--Acute care hospitals in Gwent, South Glamorgan, Mid Glamorgan, West Glamorgan, Pembrokeshire, and East Dyfed health authorities, serving a population of 2.2 million. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES--Cause of death, age, ventilation at time of death, diagnosis of brain death, and consideration of consent. RESULTS--Adequate data were available for 9840 of 10,095 hospital deaths (97.5% coverage). 188 patients aged 0-69 were identified as potential organ donors (widest definition), and of these 108 died without being ventilated at the time of death. Tests of brain stem death were formally completed in 57 cases, and organ donation was considered by the families of 47 of these potential donors. 26 patients became organ donors. Patients aged 50-69 with stroke were less likely to be ventilated than those aged less than or equal to 49 (21/96 v 24/34). Families of potential donors aged 20-39 were least likely to give permission. CONCLUSIONS--The supply of donor organs (specifically kidneys) could be increased by altering the management of patients aged 50-69 dying of severe cerebrovascular disease in general medical wards, in particular by increasing the proportion ventilated. The ethics of elective ventilation for the purposes of organ donation require discussion. 
Recurrent condylomata acuminata treated with recombinant interferon alfa-2a. A multicenter double-blind placebo-controlled clinical trial. Condylomata International Collaborative Study Group. Systemic interferon has been advocated as an effective therapy for recurrent genital warts. A double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter international trial involving 172 patients with recurrent condylomata was conducted using systemic interferon alfa-2a in doses of 3 or 9 MIU three times per week for 4 weeks. The treatment period was followed by a treatment-free follow-up period of 2 months. Complete responders at month 3 were followed up to 9 months or until they had a recurrence, whichever occurred first. The combined rates of complete response (total disappearance of all lesions without appearance of new ones) and major incomplete response (at least a 75% reduction in total lesion area) at 3 months after the commencement of therapy were 34%, 25%, and 30%, respectively, in 166 patients receiving 3 and 9 MIU of interferon alfa-2a and placebo. The recurrence rates at the end of 9 months were 9% in the placebo and 3-MIU groups and 36% in the 9-MIU group. We conclude that systemic interferon alfa-2a administered three times weekly for 4 weeks at doses of 3 and 9 MIU is not effective as monotherapy for genital warts that have recurred after standard ablative therapy. 
An evaluation of pulse oximetry in prehospital care. STUDY OBJECTIVES: We performed this study to evaluate the accuracy of pulse oximetry oxygen saturation (SpO2) against direct measurements of arterial oxygen saturation (SaO2) in the field. DESIGN: Prospective, cross-sectional, paired measurements of SpO2 against SaO2. SETTING: This evaluation was done in the prehospital setting. INTERVENTIONS: A pulse oximeter with digital probe was used to measure SpO2 in 30 patients. Arterial blood gases were drawn in the field while the pulse oximeter was in use, and oxygen saturation (HbO2) was measured by CO-oximetry. MAIN RESULTS: There was no significant difference between SpO2 (94.6 +/- 5.4%) and HbO2 (94.9 +/- 5.1%) (P = .495, beta less than .2). There was a strong correlation between SpO2 and HbO2 (r = .898). The bias between SpO2 and HbO2 was -0.3, with a precision of 2.4. When SpO2 was 88% or more, HbO2 was 90% or more in every case. Mean carboxyhemoglobin was 1.3 +/- 0.9%, and mean methemoglobin was 0.9 +/- 0.3%. There was no significant difference between the pulse oximeter heart rate and the ECG heart rate (P = .223, beta less than .2). CONCLUSION: We conclude that pulse oximetry is sufficiently accurate to be useful in the field when SpO2 is more than 88%. It is potentially useful in patients with clinical signs of acute hypoxemia and in patients receiving interventions that may produce acute hypoxemia. Further work is needed to evaluate the accuracy of pulse oximetry in the settings of elevated carboxyhemoglobin, methemoglobin, and very low saturations. 
Magnetic resonance imaging of spinal trauma. A retrospective series of 118 magnetic resonance examinations of 110 patients who had sustained previous spinal trauma is reported. Examinations performed within 3 weeks of trauma showed extraspinal soft tissue (including ligamentous) injury in 48% and intraspinal lesions in 61% (mostly consisting of extradural haematoma and spinal cord contusion). In examinations performed more than 3 weeks after injury intraspinal abnormalities were shown in 51% and these represented spinal cord compression, atrophy, myelomalacia and syringohydromyelia. Magnetic resonance imaging has the unique capability of displaying non-invasively the late sequelae of spinal trauma permitting simultaneous evaluation of the extra-spinal soft tissues, vertebral column and spinal cord. It is therefore recommended as the technique of choice in the investigation of patients who have sustained previous spinal injury, particularly those with neurological deficit. In the acute phase potentially remediable causes of neurological impairment such as disc herniation or extradural haematoma can be identified. Signal changes in the cord may allow the prognosis for neurological recovery to be established. In the later stages sequelae such as cord atrophy, myelomalacia and syringohydromyelia are accurately identified and surgical therapy may be guided, where appropriate. 
Effect of surgery on the systemic inflammatory response to intermittent claudication The hypothesis that intermittent claudication initiates a systemic inflammatory response was investigated by studying the effect of exercise on markers of neutrophil activation and vascular permeability in 25 claudicants and 10 controls. Urinary albumin excretion, previously demonstrated to reflect vascular permeability, increased significantly after exercise in claudicants and was associated with decreased neutrophil filterability and increased serum lysozyme activity. No similar exercise-induced changes were seen in controls or in claudicants after successful arterial bypass surgery. These results suggest that intermittent claudication is associated with potentially deleterious systemic manifestations that are surgically reversible. 
Treatment of chronic mastoiditis by grafting of mastoid cavities with autologous epithelial layers generated by in vitro culture of buccal epithelium. Autologous cultured epithelial layers were established from biopsies from the mucosa of the cheek, a non-keratinizing region of the oral cavity. These were grafted to the unepithelialized mastoid cavities of nine patients with chronic mastoiditis and severe otorrhoea varying from two to 30 years' duration. All procedures were performed on an out-patient basis, with no anaesthesia except for topical anaesthesia for the mucosal biopsy. In seven of the patients the grafts took well, with complete resolution of the otorrhoea for a minimum follow-up period of eight months. In one patient there was a partial take of the graft with substantial improvement in the rate of discharge. The mastoid cavities of two patients were biopsied five months after grafting, and demonstrated a stratified squamous epithelium, with keratinization of the epithelium clearly evident. 
Mortality and morbidity in patients receiving encainide, flecainide, or placebo. The Cardiac Arrhythmia Suppression Trial. BACKGROUND AND METHODS. In the Cardiac Arrhythmia Suppression Trial, designed to test the hypothesis that suppression of ventricular ectopy after a myocardial infarction reduces the incidence of sudden death, patients in whom ventricular ectopy could be suppressed with encainide, flecainide, or moricizine were randomly assigned to receive either active drug or placebo. The use of encainide and flecainide was discontinued because of excess mortality. We examined the mortality and morbidity after randomization to encainide or flecainide or their respective placebo. RESULTS. Of 1498 patients, 857 were assigned to receive encainide or its placebo (432 to active drug and 425 to placebo) and 641 were assigned to receive flecainide or its placebo (323 to active drug and 318 to placebo). After a mean follow-up of 10 months, 89 patients had died: 59 of arrhythmia (43 receiving drug vs. 16 receiving placebo; P = 0.0004), 22 of nonarrhythmic cardiac causes (17 receiving drug vs. 5 receiving placebo; P = 0.01), and 8 of noncardiac causes (3 receiving drug vs. 5 receiving placebo). Almost all cardiac deaths not due to arrhythmia were attributed to acute myocardial infarction with shock (11 patients receiving drug and 3 receiving placebo) or to chronic congestive heart failure (4 receiving drug and 2 receiving placebo). There were no differences between the patients receiving active drug and those receiving placebo in the incidence of nonlethal disqualifying ventricular tachycardia, proarrhythmia, syncope, need for a permanent pacemaker, congestive heart failure, recurrent myocardial infarction, angina, or need for coronary-artery bypass grafting or angioplasty. CONCLUSIONS. There was an excess of deaths due to arrhythmia and deaths due to shock after acute recurrent myocardial infarction in patients treated with encainide or flecainide. Nonlethal events, however, were equally distributed between the active-drug and placebo groups. The mechanisms underlying the excess mortality during treatment with encainide or flecainide remain unknown. 
Reflex bradycardia during TMJ arthroscopy: case report. A case of bradycardia occurring during TMJ arthroscopy is presented. A similar case of the TVR has not previously been reported. This reflex must be recognized by oral and maxillofacial surgeons who perform arthroscopy. 
Progression and survival studies in early chronic lymphocytic leukemia. To investigate the natural history of stage A chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) we reviewed 84 such patients. Among 74 cases evaluable for disease progression, 22 (29.6%) progressed to more advanced clinical stages (9 to stage B, 13 to stage C); the actuarial estimation of such an event at 4 years was 30% (95% CI: 26.3% to 33.6%). Despite a linear trend toward an increasing risk (r = .92), the hazard function analysis showed a constant pattern of progression, suggesting a lack of correlation of such an event with time (r = .04). Furthermore, disease progression when analyzed as a time-dependent variable had a clear-cut impact on survival (P less than .001). With the aim of identifying a subgroup of patients with low probability of disease progression and death, we applied to our set of patients four different proposals for subclassifying stage A. All methods were similar in terms of sample size, 5-year survival rate, and disease progression risk, suggesting that the choice between different proposals is somewhat arbitrary. Whatever the criteria are for defining "smoldering" CLL, such patients (accounting in the present study for 20.5% of overall series and 46.7% of stage A patients) should not be treated until progression occurs. 
Spinal mediation of thermally induced sweating. The sweat responses of nine patients with physiologically complete lesions of the spinal cord (six cervical and three thoracic) were recorded by two different techniques while the patients were exposed to elevated environmental temperatures. Oral temperatures, heart rate and respiration were monitored throughout the observational periods. Oral temperature invariably rose during exposure to heat and both heart rate and respiration tended to increase. Sweating was detected on all of the test areas by both the iodine-starch-paper technique and the quinizarin technique, but it was of widely varying intensity in different portions of the body. In the patients with cervical lesions sweating was generally profuse on the head and neck and occurred in progressively decreasing intensity down to the level of the umbilicus. It was invariably present, but only in very low intensity, on the lower extremity. Sweating was frequently present as a result of manipulation of the patient during the initial preparations, but this generally declined or stopped before the heat was turned on. With application of heat, sweating was recruited on previously dry areas or increased in intensity on those areas in which it was previously present. After oral temperature had increased moderately, the heat was turned off and the doors of the chamber opened widely so that the heat stimulus was suddenly removed. Despite a continued rise in oral temperature, sweating stopped or decreased dramatically. These results are interpreted to indicate the direct mediation by the isolated spinal cord of reflex sweating responses to a heat stimulus applied to the skin. 
The motor response to sequential apomorphine in parkinsonian fluctuations. Fifteen patients with Parkinson's disease and levodopa-induced motor fluctuations, were studied with repeated injections of apomorphine using two protocols to explore possible changes in the duration of motor response. One involved different interdose intervals; in the other, doses were given when the motor effects induced by the previous dose had just worn off. No significant change in the duration of motor response to sequential subcutaneous apomorphine with either protocol was found. The results suggest that rapid changes in receptor sensitivity during repeated intermittent dopaminergic stimulation do not contribute to the pathogenesis of Parkinsonian motor fluctuations. 
Afferent loop syndrome: sonographic findings in seven cases. We studied the sonographic findings in seven patients in whom afferent loop obstruction was first detected by sonography. All seven subsequently were proved at surgery to have afferent loop syndrome. The causes of the obstruction included internal hernia (n = 3), cancer recurrence (n = 2), marginal ulcer (n = 1), and development of cancer at the anastomosis site (n = 1). In all cases, the dilated afferent loop was seen on sonography as a tubular structure in the upper abdomen crossing transversely over the midline. The distal end of the afferent loop could be traced toward the anastomosis. The probable cause of the syndrome was predicted on the basis of sonography in two of three patients with cancer at the anastomosis. Our experience suggests that afferent loop syndrome can be diagnosed sonographically on the basis of the detection, location, and shape of the dilated afferent loop. 
Intraoral salivary gland neoplasms: a retrospective study of seventy cases in an African population. Intraoral salivary gland neoplasms diagnosed in the Department of Oral Pathology, Medical University of Southern Africa, Medunsa, were reassessed and revised with regard to histologic diagnosis. New entities and subclassifications that have been described in recent years were taken into account. Seventy cases were diagnosed during an 8-year period, and the sample consisted of black patients only. Benign mixed tumor was the most common entity and accounted for 48% of all tumors. Polymorphous low-grade adenocarcinoma comprised 15.7% of the sample and was the most frequent malignant tumor. The mean age of patients with benign and malignant tumors were 36.5 and 49.8 years, respectively (p less than 0.05), and the palate was the most common site involved. Geographic differences do exist in the pattern and pathology of intraoral salivary gland neoplasms when compared with findings in other studies. 
Detection of ACTH-producing bronchial carcinoid tumors: MR imaging vs CT. Adrenocorticotrophic hormone (ACTH)-producing bronchial carcinoid tumors tend to occur in the middle third of the lung adjacent to pulmonary vessels. Because they cause signs and symptoms when quite small (by virtue of their ACTH production), they may not be detected by CT. MR imaging was performed in 10 consecutive patients with surgically proved ACTH-producing bronchial carcinoid tumors in order to test the ability of MR to clarify equivocal or indeterminate findings on CT examinations. All bronchial carcinoid tumors had high signal intensity on T2-weighted and short-inversion-time inversion-recovery images, facilitating their distinction from pulmonary vasculature. In eight patients, the CT and MR images were equivalent in the detection of bronchial carcinoid tumors. In two patients, MR showed tumors in the middle third of the lung that were equivocal on CT. MR imaging may distinguish small bronchial carcinoid tumors from adjacent pulmonary vessels in the central third of the lung at a time when the CT study is nondiagnostic or equivocal. 
Prediction of outcome after mitral valve replacement in patients with symptomatic chronic mitral regurgitation. The importance of left atrial size. BACKGROUND. The ability to predict outcome after mitral valve replacement remains limited in patients with symptomatic chronic mitral regurgitation. The aims of this study were to determine the preoperative predictors of postoperative cardiac-related mortality and to assess the additive prognostic value of tests performed in such patients. METHODS AND RESULTS. Accordingly, 176 patients (mean age, 57 +/- 14 years) who underwent mitral valve replacement were followed up for 3.8 +/- 0.5 years. Four categories of variables were analyzed to predict postoperative cardiac-related mortality: clinical, laboratory, two-dimensional echocardiographic (2DE), and cardiac catheterization. There were 39 cardiac-related deaths (29 due to congestive heart failure and 10 sudden). When the four categories were analyzed separately, two clinical, one laboratory, two 2DE, and one catheterization variable best predicted postoperative death. When these six variables were examined simultaneously, only three (one clinical and two 2DE) remained significant predictors of cardiac-related mortality: presence of pulmonary rales, left atrial size, and the ratio of left ventricular wall thickness to left ventricular cavity dimension in end systole. A model based on these three variables may predict cardiac-related death with considerable accuracy. Laboratory data did not add to clinical information for predicting death. 2DE variables provided significant additional information in this regard (p less than 0.001). Further addition of catheterization variables was not useful. Prognostic value did not change significantly when 50 patients with prior mitral valve surgery or 49 patients undergoing concomitant aortic valve replacement or coronary artery bypass surgery were excluded from analysis. CONCLUSIONS. We conclude that 1) measures of both left ventricular systolic function and left atrial size are equally important in predicting postoperative cardiac-related mortality in patients with symptomatic chronic mitral regurgitation undergoing mitral valve replacement; 2) left atrial size may be important because it reflects the "history" (severity and duration) of mitral regurgitation; 3) 2DE assessment of left atrial size and left ventricular function provides prognostic information that is significantly greater than that obtained from clinical and laboratory parameters alone; the addition of catheterization variables does not increase the prognostic value of the clinical and 2DE data. 
Clobazam in treatment of refractory epilepsy: the Canadian experience. A retrospective study. Canadian Clobazam Cooperative Group. During the past 7 years in Canada, more than 1,300 refractory epileptic patients have been treated with clobazam (CLB) by 104 adult and pediatric neurologists. Using a standard case report, 32 neurologists, who had each treated greater than or equal to 10 patients, provided retrospective data for 877 patients. The population had the following characteristics; the percentages of children and adults were 51 and 49%, respectively; 38% of the patients were mentally retarded; the percentages for single and multiple seizure type diseases were 46 and 54%, respectively; and adults had more complex partial seizures, whereas children had more atypical absence and myoclonic types. Before clobazam, patients received an average of 2 other antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) (range 0-5 AEDs). Average dose of CLB in children was 0.87 mg/kg per day (range 0.05-3.8 mg/kg per day) and in adults 30 mg/day (range 2.5-150 mg/day). Duration of CLB therapy ranged from a few days to greater than 4 years, with 40% being treated greater than 1 year. Using Kaplan-Meier curves, we found that 4 years after starting, 40-50% of patients continued CLB. More than 40% of patients with single seizure type had at least a 50% reduction in seizure frequency (improved). At least 60% of patients with multiple seizure type had improvement in one or more seizure types, and nearly 40% of the patients had all their seizure types improved. The seizure frequency for each seizure type, except tonic, was reduced greater than 50% in 40-50% of patients and by 100% in 10-30% of patients. Twenty percent stopped CLB for poor efficacy, 4% stopped for safety-related reasons including drug interactions, and 8% stopped for both reasons. Possible side effects (predominantly somnolence) were reported by 32%; however, in only 11% were the side effects sufficiently severe to cause discontinuation of medication. "Tolerance," leading to discontinuation of CLB, was reported for 9%. Patients treated with CLB for at least 1 year were generally maintained with CLB greater than 1 year. Thus, CLB is useful in refractory epilepsy of all types, suggesting that a monotherapy trial in less severe epilepsy is now desirable. 
Correlation of quantitative angiographic parameters with changes in left ventricular diastolic function after angioplasty of the left anterior descending coronary artery. This study evaluates the changes in left ventricular (LV) diastolic filling after percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty and the relation of such changes to quantitative angiographic measurements of the severity of coronary narrowings. Pulsed Doppler echocardiographic measurements were performed in 40 patients with single left anterior descending artery narrowing before, and 10 and 30 days after angioplasty. Minimal luminal diameter and percent diameter stenosis of coronary lesions were measured by computer-assisted quantitation. The ratio of early to late diastolic flow velocities (E/A ratio), time velocity integral of early diastolic filling period (Ei) and the ratio of early and late diastolic filling periods (Ei/Ai ratio) increased gradually after angioplasty. Minimal luminal diameter correlated significantly with the percent changes in E/A ratio (r = 0.59 at 10 days, r = 0.57 at 30 days), Ei (r = 0.53 at 10 days, r = 0.55 at 30 days) and Ei/Ai ratio (r = 0.41 at 10 days, r = 0.49 at 30 days). Percent diameter stenosis showed overall weaker correlations than minimal diameter with the percent changes in E/A ratio (r = 0.39 at 10 days, r = 0.32 at 30 days) and Ei (r = 0.38 at 10 days, r = 0.31 at 30 days). Thus, LV diastolic filling improves serially after coronary angioplasty in patients with 1-vessel disease. The magnitude of improvement in diastolic filling correlates better with minimal luminal diameter than percent diameter stenosis. Therefore, minimal luminal diameter is a better predictor of changes in Doppler transmitral flow parameters after angioplasty than percent diameter stenosis. 
Survival after resection of carcinoma of the splenic flexure. Nine hundred ten patients undergoing colectomy for colon cancer were studied retrospectively. Seventy-four cancers (8 percent) were located at the splenic flexure. The stage at presentation was no different between splenic flexure cancers and colon carcinomas at other sites. Although splenic flexure cancers had twice the incidence of obstruction as did other colon cancers and obstruction in the overall series adversely affected survival, there was no difference in survival between splenic flexure cancer patients and patients with other colon cancers. 
Reduction in injection pain using buffered lidocaine as a local anesthetic before cardiac catheterization. Previous reports have suggested that pain associated with the injection of lidocaine is related to the acidic pH of the solution. To determine if the addition of a buffering solution to adjust the pH of lidocaine into the physiologic range would reduce pain during injection, we performed a blinded randomized study in patients undergoing cardiac catheterization. Twenty patients were asked to quantify the severity of pain after receiving standard lidocaine in one femoral area and buffered lidocaine in the opposite femoral area. The mean pain score for buffered lidocaine was significantly lower than the mean score for standard lidocaine (2.7 +/- 1.9 vs. 3.8 +/- 2.2, P = 0.03). The pH adjustment of standard lidocaine can be accomplished easily in the catheterization laboratory before injection and results in a reduction of the pain occurring during the infiltration of tissues. 
Electrophysiologic analysis of early Parkinson's disease. We have been interested in the application of quantitative measures of motor performance as a possible means of early detection of Parkinson's disease. To assess motor function, we have measured movement time (the physiologic correlate of bradykinesia) and reaction time (simple and directional choice) with an upper limb motor task, and tremor with accelerometry and electromyographic recordings. In this report we describe preliminary data from a Parkinson's disease patient group with symptoms of fewer than 2 years' average duration (compared with an age- and gender-matched normal control group) which indicate that precise, quantitative tests of motor function can detect the slight deviations from normal that are present in early Parkinson's disease. It appears that tests of bradykinesia are most sensitive, and detection of rest tremor is most specific. These tests may be applicable in screening individuals who are suspected of having or are "at risk for" Parkinson's disease and other related disorders. 
Malignancy supervening on an intramedullary nail. A primary, malignant, fibrous histiocytoma of bone occurring in association with a Hansen Street intramedullary nail occurred in a 39-year-old man. The physical and chemical characteristics of materials, in relation to the generation of secondary neoplasia are reviewed, but the problem of coincidence is difficult to exclude. 
Prolongation of repolarization time by electric field stimulation with monophasic and biphasic shocks in open-chest dogs. Recent studies suggest that 1) electrically induced fibrillation and defibrillation involve prolongation of refractoriness by the shock in addition to stimulation and 2) biphasic waveforms are more efficient for defibrillation than are comparable monophasic waveforms. The purpose of this study was to compare prolongation of action potential duration at 50% repolarization by monophasic and biphasic shocks during paced rhythm. A floating glass microelectrode was used to record intracellularly from the anterior right ventricular epicardium in seven open-chest dogs. After 10 S1 beats paced at an interval of 350 msec, 5-msec and 2.5-msec monophasic shocks and biphasic shocks, with each phase of 2.5 msec, were given via mesh electrodes on either side of the microelectrode. The shock strength was adjusted so that the shock field, measured from eight extracellular electrodes encircling the microelectrode, was about 5 V/cm. Monophasic and biphasic S2 shocks were given starting with an S1-S2 interval of 120 msec, which was increased in 5-msec steps until an action potential was produced by the S2 shock. Both monophasic and biphasic 5 V/cm shock fields caused significant prolongation of action potential duration. The prolongation of action potential duration increased as the S1-S2 interval increased. This prolongation occurred at shorter S1-S2 intervals for 5-msec monophasic shocks than for biphasic shocks. 
Emergency department treatment of alcohol withdrawal seizures with phenytoin. STUDY OBJECTIVE: Prevention of recurrent alcohol withdrawal seizures is a common emergency department problem. A prospective, randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind study of adequate size was designed to assess the efficacy of phenytoin in preventing recurrence of alcohol withdrawal seizures. METHODS: Fifty-five patients who had seized from alcohol withdrawal were randomly assigned to treatment with IV phenytoin or placebo. Patients with known seizure disorders and those receiving any anticonvulsant were excluded. The study was terminated after seizure recurrence or passage of a six-hour, high-risk seizure interval. RESULTS: Six of 28 phenytoin-treated patients (21%) had recurrent seizures compared with five of 27 placebo-treated patients (19%). The 95% confidence interval for the difference in response probabilities was +16% to -20%. There was no statistically significant difference between the response rates for the two treatments (P greater than .05). CONCLUSION: Phenytoin does not show significant benefit over placebo in preventing recurrence of alcohol withdrawal seizures. 
Psychological distress and diagnostic subgroups of temporomandibular disorder patients. This study examined the nature and extent of psychological differences among diagnostic subgroups of temporomandibular disorder (TMD) patients. Three subgroups were identified and labeled as: (1) primary myalgia, (2) primary temporomandibular joint (TMJ) problems, or (3) combination myalgia and TMJ problems. Patients' (n = 112) levels of pain and distress were measured using a VAS pain scale, the McGill Pain Questionnaire, the Beck Depression Inventory, the State-Trait Anxiety Scale and the MMPI. Patients with primary myalgia had the highest scores on the pain and distress measures while patients in the combination group scored between the myalgia and TMJ problem subgroups. When differences in pain levels were controlled, the differences among groups on measures of anxiety and depression were attenuated while the differences on measures of somatic overconcern remained significant. Discriminant function analysis using psychological variables to predict diagnostic grouping produced correct identification of 74% of the structural patients and 46% of the myalgia patients. Implications for different etiological factors among the 3 groups are discussed. 
Effects of drive train stimulus intensity on ventricular refractoriness in humans. BACKGROUND. The strength-interval relation between the intensity of premature stimulus and the ventricular effective refractory period (VERP) has been well characterized. The effects of variation in the intensity of the basic drive train stimuli (S1) on VERP are not as well defined. This relation was studied in 44 patients undergoing clinically indicated electrophysiological study. METHODS AND RESULTS. The outputs of two stimulus isolation units were connected in parallel, allowing the intensity of S1 to be varied independently of intensity of the extrastimulus (S2). To prevent confounding effects from cycle length change, continuous overdrive pacing was performed for 3 minutes before each measurement of VERP. The effect of S1 intensity on VERP was assessed in 24 patients with S2 intensity kept constant at twice threshold. VERP shortened from 232 +/- 19 msec at an S1 intensity of 1.5 times threshold to 219 +/- 20 msec at 5 mA and 211 +/- 19 msec at 10 mA (p less than 0.0001 for baseline versus 5 mA and for 5 mA versus 10 mA). Autonomic blockade with atropine and propranolol blunted but did not completely eliminate this effect. To assess whether the effect of S1 intensity on VERP was independent of S2 intensity, S2 strength-interval curves were generated in 10 patients at low (1.5 times threshold) and high (10 mA) S1 intensities. All portions of the strength-interval curve were shifted to the left by an increase in S1 intensity. The time course of change in VERP after an abrupt increase in S1 intensity was assessed in an additional 10 patients. VERP changed slowly, requiring 18 +/- 28 seconds to shorten by 2 msec and 64 +/- 46 seconds to decrease by 10 msec after a change in S1 intensity from 1.5 times threshold to 10 mA. In a final group of 10 patients, VERP was measured using an eight-beat drive train and a 4-second intertrain interval. With this more conventional protocol, VERP shortened by 14 +/- 8 msec with an increase in S1 intensity from 1.5 times threshold to 10 mA. CONCLUSIONS. Increasing S1 intensity results in clinically significant, progressive shortening of VERP in man. This effect is independent of S2 intensity. The prolonged time course of the change in VERP after an increase in S1 intensity and the attenuation of this effect by autonomic blockade are consistent with stimulation of sympathetic nerve terminals and catecholamine release as a result of intense stimulation. 
Detection of human papillomavirus DNA by in situ DNA hybridization and polymerase chain reaction in premalignant and malignant oral lesions. The sensitivity of detection of human papillomavirus (HPV) DNA in premalignant and malignant oral lesions by in situ hybridization (ISH) and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) were compared. With both methods HPV DNA was found in 4 of 24 cases of epithelial dysplasia, 4 of 14 cases of verrucous hyperplasia, and 1 of 10 cases of squamous cell carcinoma. The 10 cases of smokeless tobacco keratoses and 3 cases of verrucous carcinoma that we examined were all negative for HPV DNA. The PCR for the E6 open reading frame of HPV-16 correctly identified all cases that were positive by ISH. Only a single case that was positive by PCR was negative by ISH for HPV DNA. However, the PCR demonstrated the presence of HPV-16 infection in one case, which had hybridized most intensely with the probe for types 31/33/35 in the ISH. This discrepancy probably is due to the high degree of cross-hybridization in the ISH assay. PCR appears to be an effective technique for identifying HPV-16 DNA sequences in biopsy material from premalignant and malignant oral lesions. 
Predictive testing for Wilson's disease using tightly linked and flanking DNA markers. We studied DNA polymorphisms for five new chromosome 13 markers in 52 Wilson's disease (WD) families from Europe, North America, and the Middle East. There was significant evidence for linkage between the Wilson's disease locus (WND) and all the marker loci. Multilocus linkage analysis, using a genetic linkage map established from reference pedigrees, suggested that WND is most likely between D13S31 and D13S59, at distances of 0.4 and 1.2 centimorgans, respectively. Our results suggest that the chromosomal location of the Wilson's disease gene is the same in all families from the populations studied. This evidence and the availability of many close, flanking, and polymorphic DNA markers make possible accurate and informative testing of potential carriers and WD homozygotes in families with at least one previously affected child. An advantage of a genetic linkage test over other laboratory methods for prediction of genotype in WD is that a reliable diagnosis can be made at a much earlier stage in life, including prenatally. In addition, DNA testing can be used in place of an invasive liver biopsy procedure to confirm a diagnosis in patients with borderline serum ceruloplasmin levels. Presymptomatic identification will also allow therapeutic intervention to prevent symptoms before irreparable liver or neurologic damage occurs. We describe the implementation of prenatal and preclinical diagnosis for two families with WD. 
Endocrine manifestations of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. Endocrine manifestations of HIV infection include both pathological changes and disturbances in function. Mechanisms include direct infection of glands by HIV or opportunistic organisms, infiltration by neoplasms, side effects of drugs, and production of humoral factors that may alter metabolism. The adrenal gland is most often affected, but virtually every endocrine system may be involved. Dysfunction is often subtle, with symptoms overlapping those of the HIV infection itself. Endocrine manifestations may be found at any time in the course of the disease, from the asymptomatic HIV-positive stage through full-blown AIDS. Optimal management of these patients may include a careful search for, and appropriate treatment of, associated endocrine abnormalities. 
Disease progression and viral genome variants in experimental feline leukemia virus-induced immunodeficiency syndrome [published erratum appears in J Acquir Immune Defic Syndr 1991;4(9):925] A fatal immunodeficiency syndrome with clinical and pathologic features similar to human AIDS is inducible in cats by experimental inoculation with a specific strain of feline leukemia virus (FeLV) called FeLV-FAIDS. The course of the feline disease is characterized by an age-dependent prodromal period during which a non-disease-specific, common form of proviral DNA is detected in bone marrow. Preceding clinical onset of immunodeficiency is production of high levels of specific, pathogenic variant genomes, primarily as unintegrated viral DNA, in bone marrow. Acute immunodeficiency syndrome (survival period approximately 3 months) is associated with a short prodromal period and appearance of a characteristic variant genome (variant A) that persists at high copy number as integrated and full-length unintegrated viral DNA in bone marrow. Chronic immunodeficiency syndrome (survival greater than 1 year) is marked by a longer prodromal period, a more gradual onset of severe clinical immunosuppression, and a predominance of other variant genomes that often contain substantial internal deletions. In both forms of the disease, tissue-specific replication of certain variant viruses is noted in the bone marrow, intestine, and lymph nodes. Evidence from in vitro and in vivo virus transmission studies indicates that the appearance of FeLV-FAIDS variant viruses reflects differential replication of viral genomes pre-existing in the inoculum rather than rapid de novo evolution of new variants within each animal. These results demonstrate that retrovirus-induced immunodeficiency disease in cats can be associated with and prefigured by the amplified replication of specific viral variants in target tissues. 
Treatment of gram-negative peritonitis with aztreonam in patients undergoing continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis. In a multicenter open study, intraperitoneal aztreonam was used together with vancomycin, cloxacillin, or flucloxacillin for initial empiric treatment of peritonitis associated with continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD). Monotherapy with aztreonam was continued in 34 episodes of gram-negative peritonitis in 28 patients. The microorganisms isolated included Escherichia coli, Acinetobacter species, Pseudomonas species, and Klebsiella species. In three episodes, two organisms were cultured. Microbiologic assessment revealed cure in 27 episodes, cure with relapse in two, cure with superinfection in one, and treatment failure in four (with resistance to aztreonam in three). As assessed by clinical criteria, 27 episodes were cured, five failed to respond, and two responded partially. No adverse reactions to aztreonam were observed. Comparison of these 34 episodes with 35 episodes in historical controls (treated mainly with aminoglycosides and/or trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole) showed significantly higher rates of cure (84% vs. 51%) and of survival (97% vs. 86%) as well as lower rates of catheter removal (65% vs. 87%) with aztreonam. Thus aztreonam is a safe and efficient agent for the treatment of peritonitis caused by gram-negative organisms in patients undergoing CAPD. 
Quantitative magnetic resonance imaging in cervical carcinoma: a report on 30 cases. T1 and T2 relaxation times were calculated, before radiation therapy, in 30 patients with cervical carcinoma. Eight healthy young women were submitted to magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to determine T1 and T2 times of the normal cervix. Magnetic resonance imaging was repeated, in 22 patients, during radiation therapy and at follow-up. During treatment and follow-up, patients with complete tumour response showed a significant T1 reduction compared with the pre-treatment values. With persistence of palpable or visible tumour, T1 times showed a small decrease during therapy, and a marked increase at subsequent examinations. The results suggest that the modifications of T1 times, during radiation therapy and follow-up, could be considered as a useful discriminant between patients with differing tumour response. 
Prostaglandin F2 alpha and indomethacin in hepatogenic pulmonary angiodysplasia. Effects on pulmonary hemodynamics and gas exchange. We treated a 68-year-old man with cirrhosis of the liver associated with moderate hypoxemia. Contrast-enhanced echocardiography revealed late opacification of the left ventricle, and pulmonary perfusion imaging with 99mTc macroaggregated albumin showed evidence of a significant uptake in both lungs and in the liver, spleen, and kidneys. Right cardiac catheterization revealed pulmonary hypotension, low pulmonary vascular resistance, and high cardiac output. We administered prostaglandin F2 alpha intravenously (0.2 microgram/kg/min for 30 minutes) and indomethacin orally (75 mg/day for three days). There was some degree of resolution of the hypoxemia and increases in both pulmonary arterial pressure and pulmonary vascular resistance. These findings suggest that the pathophysiology of hepatogenic pulmonary angiodysplasia is a reversible intrapulmonary vascular dilatation. These conditions can to some extent be modulated by vasoactive substances such as prostaglandins or other eicosanoids. 
Effect of dietary nucleotides on intestinal repair in rats with experimental chronic diarrhea. Nucleic acid synthesis in tissues of rapid growth is preferentially done using dietary purines and pyrimidines via the salvage pathway. In the case of a low protein intake, dietary nucleotides may be semiessential for cell replication of gut, lymphocytes, and bone marrow, and especially in those intestinal diseases in which the mucosa is altered, dietary nucleotides may have a role in intestinal development. The effect of dietary nucleotides on intestinal weight and length, gut mucosal weight, intestinal protein and DNA contents, and lactase, maltase, and intestinal mucosal activities was assessed in a controlled way. Weanling (21-day-old) rats were separated into two groups of 36, each receiving blindly a basal diet containing glucose polymers (C) or a basal diet with lactose as the main carbohydrate (L) for 15 days. Those fed with L developed a syndrome of chronic diarrhea and malnutrition. Ten rats of each group were sacrificed at that time. The rest of the animals of each group were separated into two subgroups. The first was fed with the C diet and the second with the C diet supplemented with 50 mg/100 g of each of the following nucleotides: AMP, GMP, CMP, UMP, and IMP (CN). Thus the subgroups CC, CN, LC, and LN were formed. Rats were sacrificed after 4 weeks and gut separated into three segments corresponding to duodenum, jejunum, and ileum. Analysis of variance was used to compare the effect of diet or segments. DNA and lactase, maltase, and sucrase activities increased in the LN group with respect to LC especially in jejunum and ileum but there were not any differences between CC and CN. 
Hereditary coproporphyria: an imitator of multiple sclerosis. Hereditary coproporphyria can cause both peripheral neuropathy and central nervous system abnormalities. There are several similarities between multiple sclerosis and hereditary coproporphyria that are probably due to the central nervous system dysfunction present in both. This report describes a 62-year-old man with a five-year history of progressive paraparesis initially diagnosed as multiple sclerosis. Supporting evidence for the diagnosis of a demyelinating disease included three oligoclonal bands in the patient's cerebral spinal fluid, a prolonged visual evoked response bilaterally, abnormal sensory evoked potentials, and an area of increased signal in the posterior cervical cord suggestive of demyelination that was demonstrated on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Features atypical for multiple sclerosis were hypoactive deep-tendon reflexes, electromyographic evidence of peripheral neuropathy, and severe constipation. Elevated urine porphyrins and decreased levels of coproporphyrinogen oxidase confirmed the correct diagnosis of hereditary coproporphyria. The patient improved after being placed on a high-carbohydrate diet. Although central demyelination is known to occur in patients with porphyria, delayed evoked potentials and MRI abnormalities have not been previously reported. 
Early postoperative basal serum GH level and the GH response to TRH in relation to the long-term outcome of surgical treatment for acromegaly: a report on 39 patients. During a 10-year period 39 patients with acromegaly, aged 23-73 years, underwent selective adenomectomy via a trans-sphenoidal or transfrontal (one case) approach. Six to 12 months after the operation, the serum level of growth hormone (GH) was reduced to less than 5 micrograms l-1 in 28 patients (74%) in at least two of three random samples and/or suppressed to less than 3 micrograms l-1 during an oral glucose load, thus fulfilling the commonly used criteria for a successful operation. In 10 patients these criteria for adequate GH reduction were not fulfilled, but their median S-GH level was reduced from 38 to 11 micrograms l-1 (P less than 0.01) after the operation. Surgery was successful in 11 of 13 (85%) patients with a microadenoma (less than 10 mm in diameter), in 10 of 14 (71%) patients with an adenoma of diameter greater than 10 mm but still enclosed in the sella, and in seven of 11 (64%) patients with locally invasive tumours. Impaired pituitary function was observed in 23% of the patients after surgery, independent of tumour size. In one patient the postoperative period was complicated by a lethal intracranial infection. During follow-up for 1-10 years, four patients relapsed, after 1, 1.5, 6 and 9 years, respectively. Patients for whom surgery appeared to have been ineffective at the evaluation 6-12 months postoperatively, or who later relapsed were identified by early (within 7 d) postoperative serum GH with a sensitivity of 90%. The accuracy for identification of a satisfactory outcome of surgery was 85%, and the predictive value was 90%. The corresponding values for the GH response to TRH measured 6-12 months postoperatively were 47, 40 and 54%, respectively. It is concluded that the basal level of serum GH measured 1-7 d postoperatively has higher sensitivity and specificity than the GH response to TRH 6-12 months postoperatively for evaluation of the effect of surgery on GH overproduction, and that it has a higher predictive power with regard to the long-term outcome of surgery for acromegaly. 
Psychiatric aspects of chest pain in the emergency department. We estimate that a third of the patients who present to the ED with chest pain have a current psychiatric disorder and that psychiatric disorders among chest pain patients are associated with a high rate of ED utilization for chest pain evaluations. Physicians in the ED recognize only a small fraction of the psychiatric disorders, so appropriate treatment or referral may be infrequent. The proportion of chest pain patients with CAD who also have a psychiatric disorder may be in the range of 20% to 30%, justifying careful assessment of psychiatric disorders in CAD patients. We conclude that the psychiatric aspects of chest pain are sufficiently prevalent, clinically significant, and a contributor to unnecessarily high utilization of medical services. We call for clinical research to address these questions by outlining three areas of study that will advance our knowledge and care of the patient with chest pain. 
Alpha 2 macroglobulin state in acute pancreatitis. Raised values of alpha 2 macroglobulin-protease complexes in severe and mild attacks. Plasma values of C reactive protein, alpha 1 proteinase inhibitor, alpha 2 macroglobulin, and complexed alpha 2 macroglobulin have been determined in serial samples from 27 patients with acute pancreatitis. Complexed alpha 2 macroglobulin was measured by a novel enzyme linked immunosorbent assay with a monoclonal antibody specific for the complexed form. Patients with severe illness had lower concentrations of total alpha 2 macroglobulin and higher concentrations of complexed alpha 2 macroglobulin than those with mild illness, and in the majority of severe attacks the abnormal amounts of complexed alpha 2 macroglobulin were present throughout the eight days of the study. The proportion of total alpha 2 macroglobulin in the uncomplexed form, however, was generally greater than 90%, and in 26% of the mild cases completely normal concentrations of uncomplexed alpha 2 macroglobulin (greater than 99% of total) were found throughout the eight days of the study. This suggests that exhaustion of alpha 2 macroglobulin in plasma is unlikely to be a major factor in the pathogenesis of acute pancreatitis. 
Right ventricular hypertrophy detected by echocardiography in patients with newly diagnosed obstructive sleep apnea. We used polysomnography, echocardiography and ventilatory measurements to study 50 patients suspected of having OSA to determine a link to RVH. Twenty-eight patients (56 percent) had OSA and 20 (71 percent) of those had isolated RVH. We evaluated patients with RVH and divided them into two groups, those with apnea and those without apnea. The patients with sleep apnea were younger, weighed more, had greater BSA and had lower average oxygen saturations during the sleep study period. We divided the group with apnea into those with RVH and those without it. Those patients with RVH had a higher AI, longer average apnea time, a greater duration of longest apnea and a lower average oxygen saturation for the period of the sleep study. In addition, those with RVH had a lower average oxygen saturation during each apneic episode with a p value equaling 0.09. 
Carcinoid tumor of the common bile duct: evidence for its origin in metaplastic endocrine cells. Carcinoid tumors of the extrahepatic bile ducts are extremely rare neoplasms. The authors report the case of a 36-yr-old male patient with a carcinoid tumor that arose in the common hepatic bile duct. The non-neoplastic mucosa showed areas of gastric and intestinal metaplasia that included scattered argyrophil endocrine cells. Since the normal mucosa of the bile ducts lacks the latter type of cells, this case provides evidence for the first time that carcinoid tumors of this anatomic site probably originate from metaplastic endocrine cells. 
Emergency laryngectomy. From 1974 to 1990, 31 patients underwent emergency laryngectomy for airway obstruction due to laryngeal carcinoma, in an effort to avoid the complication of stomal recurrence. This group of patients had a greater proportion of multiregional tumours (35 per cent vs 13 per cent) than a comparison group of elective laryngectomies. In other respects the two groups were similar. Early post-operative mortality (6.5 per cent vs 3 per cent), stomal recurrence rates (4.2 per cent vs 4.8 per cent) and survival (53 per cent vs 55 per cent) were not significantly different between the emergency laryngectomy group and the comparison group undergoing elective laryngectomy. 
An autopsy case of I-cell disease. Ultrastructural and biochemical analyses. An autopsy case of I-cell disease in a 4-year-old Japanese girl is presented. In this report, the authors analyze the relationship between morphologic (including electron microscopic) and biochemical findings. Lymph node, spleen, and kidney, which were stained with Hale's colloidal iron method, contained large amounts of hexosamine. These substances had accumulated in lymphocytes of B-cell lineage. 
Late potentials are unaltered by ventricular filling pressure reduction in heart failure. Exacerbation of heart failure may increase susceptibility to arrhythmias. Therefore tests to assess the risk of arrhythmia, performed after hemodynamic improvement, may be of limited value. To determine whether hemodynamic improvement alters ventricular late potentials detected by signal-averaged ECG, we studied 27 consecutive patients with dilated heart failure (left ventricular ejection fraction 0.20 +/- 0.06, 15 with coronary artery disease) before and 3 +/- 2 days after tailored vasodilator and diuretic therapy reduced ventricular filling pressures. QRS duration, terminal QRS amplitude (root mean square [RMS]), and low-amplitude (less than 40 microV) signal (LAS) duration were determined by an automated algorithm from the vector magnitude of the QRS high-pass filtered at 25 Hz and at 40 Hz. Despite marked decreases in pulmonary capillary wedge (27 +/- 7 to 16 +/- 5 mm Hg, p less than 0.001) and right atrial (13 +/- 7 to 7 +/- 4 mm Hg, p less than 0.001) pressures and a 20% increase in cardiac output, there was not a significant change in QRS duration, RMS, or LAS. Before and after therapy late potentials, defined as abnormal QRS duration RMS, or LAS, were present in 14 (52%) patients with filtering at 25 Hz and in 22 (81%) patients with filtering at 40 Hz. The signal-averaged ECG after hemodynamic improvement predicted the results during exacerbation of heart failure in all patients. Thus in patients with advanced heart failure the signal-averaged ECG obtained after hemodynamic improvement reflects the findings during exacerbation of heart failure. 
The pediatrician's involvement in prevention and treatment of oral disease in medically compromised children. Significant oral health problems are associated with medical, physical, or mental disorders that occur in children. The pediatrician has the opportunity through early intervention to set the tone for a health care practice that will improve the quality of life for many disadvantaged children. When the pediatrician and pediatric dentist work hand in hand, the children can often expect a happy, healthy future. 
The physiologic basis of diuretic synergism: its role in treating diuretic resistance. Diuretic drugs usually improve edema when used judiciously. Some patients, however, become resistant to their effects. Diuretic resistance may result from dietary indiscretion, poor compliance, impaired bioavailability, imparied diuretic secretion into the lumen of the renal tubule, or because other drugs interfere with diuretic activity. When easily treatable causes of diuretic resistance have been excluded, resistance often reflects the intensity of the stimuli to sodium retention. Recent experimental work has indicated ways in which the kidney adapts to chronic diuretic treatment and has indicated how these adaptations may limit diuretic effectiveness. First, nephron segments downstream from the site of diuretic action increase sodium-chloride (NaCl) reabsorption because the delivered NaCl load increases. Second, diuretic-induced contraction of the extracellular fluid volume stimulates kidney tubules to retain NaCl until the next dose of diuretic is administered. Third, kidney tubules themselves may become hypertrophic because they are chronically stimulated by diuretic-induced increases in NaCl delivery. These adaptations all increase the rate of NaCl reabsorption and blunt the effectiveness of diuretic therapy. When diuretic resistance is present, using a second diuretic drug that acts in a different nephron segment is often effective. Recent experimental results suggest that a second class of drug may act synergistically with the first by blocking the adaptive processes that limit diuretic effectiveness. On the basis of an understanding of the mechanisms of diuretic adaptation and resistance, treatment regimens can be designed to block specific adaptive mechanisms and to improve diuretic therapy. 
Substance abuse: the designer drugs. Designer drugs, chemically altered compounds derived from federally controlled substances, have become a major cause of addiction and overdose deaths. These drugs include mescaline analogs, synthetic opioids, arylhexylamines, methaqualone derivatives and crack, a new form of cocaine. Sudden changes in mood, weight loss, depression, disturbed sleep patterns, deteriorating school or work performance, marital problems, and loss of interest in friends and social activities may be signs of drug addiction. Life-threatening complications of acute intoxication, such as hyperthermia, seizures, combative and psychotic behavior, and cardiorespiratory collapse, require prompt diagnosis and supportive intervention. 
Differential expression of CD25 (interleukin-2 receptor) on lamina propria T cells and macrophages in the intestinal lesions in Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis Many interleukin-2 receptor (CD25) bearing cells can be identified by alkaline phosphatase immunohistochemistry in the diseased intestinal lamina propria of children with Crohn's disease or ulcerative colitis, but rarely in normal intestine. In both diseases, the CD25+ cells are present as aggregates in the lamina propria below the epithelium, and constitute a large proportion of the lamina propria mononuclear cells. In Crohn's disease, but not ulcerative colitis, CD25+ cells are abundant in the submucosa. The CD25+ cells in Crohn's disease are 58-88% CD3+, CD4+, CD8-, indicating that they are T cells, whereas in ulcerative colitis the CD25+ cells are greater than 80% CD3-, CD4+, HLA-DR+, indicating that they are macrophages. Thus, differential expression of CD25 on T cells and macrophages serves to distinguish the immunologic lesions in ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease. 
Myonecrosis and myofibrosis as complications of sickle cell anemia. Painful crises in sickle cell anemia are associated with infarction and subsequent fibrosis of many different organs. Myonecrosis secondary to muscle infarction during a crisis and subsequent fibrosis are often not recognized as complications of sickle cell anemia. We describe four patients, all of whom had recurrent episodes of symmetric proximal muscle pain and swelling as prominent features of their crises. Muscle biopsies showed acute myonecrosis with a minimal inflammatory reaction as well as myofibrosis with abundant collagen deposition. Chronic sequelae consisted of muscle induration, atrophy, and contractures. 
Suppression of eicosanoid biosynthesis during coronary angioplasty by fish oil and aspirin. BACKGROUND. Percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA) is an acute, localized stimulus to platelet and vascular function. Periprocedural cardiovascular complications are reduced by moderate-dose aspirin (ASA), presumably due to inhibition of thromboxane (TX) A2. METHODS AND RESULTS. Excretion of TXA2 and prostacyclin (PGI2) metabolites in urine increased during PTCA. Pretreatment for 3 days with either moderate- (325 mg/day) or low-dose (80 mg/day) ASA inhibited the increase in both eicosanoids. Pretreatment for 3 weeks with fish oil (10 g/day) only partially suppressed TXA2. Formation of trienoic eicosanoids and accumulation of omega-3 fatty acids in platelet membranes confirmed fish oil ingestion. Although basal PGI2 was not inhibited, the PTCA-related increment was suppressed. CONCLUSIONS. PTCA results in an acute, transient alteration of eicosanoid biosynthesis consistent with accelerated platelet-vascular interactions. Pretreatment for 3 days with moderate or low doses of ASA suppresses TXA to a similar extent during PTCA, and their effects on acute cardiovascular complications of this procedure are likely to be comparable. It is unlikely that even prolonged pretreatment with fish oil can substitute for the platelet inhibitory action of ASA during PTCA. Suppression of PGI2 may contribute to the residual acute periprocedural complication rate in patients taking ASA. 
Etidronate for hypercalcemia of malignancy and osteoporosis. The biphosphonates are becoming well established as effective agents for the treatment of metabolic bone diseases. Etidronate disodium is the only biphosphonate approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. Accepted indications for etidronate therapy are symptomatic Paget's disease, heterotopic ossification and hypercalcemia of malignancy. An unapproved, but apparently successful use is treatment of postmenopausal osteoporosis. Both oral and intravenous preparations are available. Newer biphosphonates, which may be more efficacious and less toxic than etidronate, are being studied. 
Comparative angiographic quantitative analysis of the immediate efficacy of coronary atherectomy with balloon angioplasty, stenting, and rotational ablation. Interventional cardiology has branched in two directions: devices that primarily dilate coronary stenoses and those that debulk coronary tissue. Presently the optimum coronary intervention has not been found. While patients are awaiting randomized trials, a comparison based on matched quantitative coronary analysis may be useful to evaluate results of new interventional techniques. Therefore we compared 51 patients undergoing atherectomy with individually matched patients who were undergoing balloon angioplasty and stenting. The lesions were matched according to location of stenosis and reference diameter. Atherectomy and stenting resulted in larger gains in minimal luminal diameter compared with conventional balloon angioplasty. The minimal luminal diameter was increased from 1.2 +/- 0.4 mm to 2.6 +/- 0.4 mm in the atherectomy group and from 1.2 +/- 0.3 mm to 1.9 +/- 0.4 mm in the angioplasty group (p less than 0.00001). Atherectomy and stenting resulted in similar gains in minimum luminal diameter (1.4 mm vs 1.3 mm, p = NS). In addition, atherectomy and stenting appear to be more effective in resisting elastic recoil because of tissue removal and an intrinsic dilating effect, respectively. In matched populations directional atherectomy and stenting appear to be more effective intracoronary interventional devices than balloon angioplasty based on the immediate results. However, atherectomy is limited in smaller coronary vessels because of its larger size. 
Adaptive changes in the periphery and their therapeutic consequences. Systemic vasoconstriction in chronic heart failure is due to several compensatory mechanisms with different time courses. Peripheral vasoconstriction mediated by increased sympathetic tone and activation of the plasma renin-angiotensin system may act primarily for short-term control. The effects of the vascular renin-angiotensin system, impaired flow-dependent, endothelium-mediated dilation (resulting from chronically reduced flow) and structural alterations of the vessel wall slowly emerge with time. In addition, fluid retention may contribute to increased vascular stiffness in chronic heart failure. Improved cardiac output with acute administration of vasodilators and inotropes is not immediately translated into increased blood flow to skeletal muscle, because (1) the reversal of the peripheral alterations described develops slowly over time (in fact, vasodilators and inotropes given acutely may cause redistribution of blood flow in skeletal muscle without improving oxygen availability); and (2) intrinsic abnormalities of skeletal muscle exist in chronic heart failure (e.g., due to chronic deconditioning, resulting in reduced oxidative capacity of skeletal muscle, as suggested by ultrastructural analysis and nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy). Drugs that interfere with the underlying compensatory mechanisms (e.g., renin-angiotensin system) without development of tolerance during long-term therapy exert beneficial effects after long-term treatment (e.g., the beneficial effects of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors are, in part, due to peripheral mechanisms--the inability of the peripheral vessels to dilate--and to improvement of peripheral oxygen extraction). 
Extracorporeal lithotripsy. An important adjunct in the nonoperative management of retained or recurrent bile duct stones. Retained or recurrent bile duct stones can be successfully removed in up to 80% to 85% of patients with the use of percutaneous or endoscopic techniques. However, problems related to difficult biliary access, large stones, and biliary strictures may decrease the success rate of this approach. We evaluated the safety and efficacy of extracorporeal shock-wave lithotripsy (ESWL) in 16 patients with complicated biliary stones treated prospectively over a 24-month period. Successful stone fragmentation was achieved in 15 patients (94%) using a Dornier HM3 lithotripter (average of 2290 shocks at 22 kV). Three patients (19%) required a second ESWL treatment. Biliary clearance of stone fragments was spontaneous in seven (43%) of the patients and required additional treatment in eight (57%) of the patients. Complications from ESWL were minor and included transient hematuria and ecchymoses at the skin entry site. Extracorporeal shock-wave lithotripsy failed in one patient (6%) with a biliary stricture and surgery was required. At hospital discharge, all patients were asymptomatic and stone free. Treatment with ESWL appears to be a safe and effective adjunct for selected patients with complex biliary stone disease. 
The orthostatic tachycardia syndrome: evaluation of autonomic function and treatment with octreotide and ergot alkaloids. Orthostatic tachycardia is a poorly understood syndrome in which patients develop dizziness, diaphoresis, or palpitations upon shifting from the supine to the upright posture. The present study was performed to determine whether autonomic neuropathy might be present in these patients, and whether the abnormal hemodynamic response to standing might be the result of failure of reflex vasoconstriction. We measured autonomic function in 9 patients with idiopathic orthostatic tachycardia and 2 patients with orthostatic tachycardia and insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus and compared them to 33 age-matched controls. Although most patients with orthostatic tachycardia had normal vasomotor reflexes and normal surface potential amplitudes, the latency of the autonomic response, a measure of sympathetic nerve conduction velocity, was prolonged in the soles (2.44 +/- 0.08 s in patients with idiopathic orthostatic tachycardia vs. 2.12 +/- 0.04 s in controls; P less than 0.005). In 6 of 9 patients, however, the latencies were within the normal range. Autonomic surface potentials were absent in 1 diabetic patient with orthostatic tachycardia; the latency of the response in the feet was greatly prolonged (2.95 s) in the second patient. We also assessed the response of orthostatic tachycardia patients to octreotide and dihydroergotamine, which are known to have a pressor effect in patients with recognized forms of autonomic neuropathy. These agents, in combination, suppressed orthostatic tachycardia (from 116 +/- 7 to 89 +/- 6 beats/min; P less than 0.001) in patients with this syndrome. In summary, our data indicate that evidence of autonomic dysfunction is present in only a minority of patients with orthostatic tachycardia. Nevertheless, administration of the vasoconstrictor drugs dihydroergotamine and octreotide can prevent the abnormal hemodynamic response to the upright posture shown by patients with this syndrome. 
Crohn disease in the pediatric patient: CT evaluation. Computed tomographic (CT) scans and medical records of 25 children (age range, 10-18 years) with pathologically proved Crohn disease were reviewed to better define the role of CT in the management of pediatric patients with Crohn disease. CT findings included small bowel thickening (range, 5-10 mm) (n = 20), colonic wall thickening (range, 6-15 mm) (n = 15), and small bowel dilation (n = 5). Mesenteric abnormalities such as adenopathy and focal fatty proliferation were seen in 11 to 18 patients, respectively. Extraluminal complications were easily identified with CT. Abscesses were noted in seven patients, inflammatory masses in four, and perirectal or perineal inflammation in 10. Fistulas were detected in four patients. The authors conclude that CT should be the initial imaging study performed in children with known Crohn disease and a changing pattern of clinical symptoms. 
Effect of bisoprolol on blood pressure and arterial hemodynamics in systemic hypertension. Blood pressure, heart rate, common carotid and brachial arterial hemodynamics using pulsed Doppler flowmetry and pulse wave velocity determinations were evaluated using a double-blind crossover design versus placebo in 14 patients with sustained essential hypertension treated by the selective beta 1 blocking agent bisoprolol. Blood pressure and heart rate significantly decreased after bisoprolol, whereas no significant change occurred in the diameter, the blood flow and in the vascular resistance of the carotid and brachial circulations. Pulse wave velocity significantly decreased in the brachioradial and the carotid femoral areas. The decrease in the latter was -1.6 +/- 0.8 m/s with bisoprolol and -0.06 +/- 0.80 m/s with placebo (p = 0.001). Brachial artery compliance significantly increased from 117 +/- 49 to 205 +/- 84 cm4 x dynes-1 x 10(9) (p = 0.001), indicating that the antihypertensive effect of beta 1 blockade is associated with an improvement in the viscoelastic properties of the brachial artery wall. 
J. Maxwell Chamberlain Memorial Paper. Role of staging in prognosis and management of thymoma. Eighty-five patients operated on for thymoma from 1972 to 1989 were evaluated, 32 with myasthenia gravis and 53 without. Masaoka staging revealed stage I disease in 45 (53%), stage II in 23 (27%), stage III in 14 (16%), and stage IVa in 3 (4%). There was no operative mortality. Actuarial survival at 10 years was 63.7% for all patients: 78.3% for those in stage I, 74.7% for those in stage II, and 20.8% for those in stage III. There was no recurrence in patients in stage I. Mediastinal recurrence developed in 4 patients in stage II considered to have noninvasive disease by the surgeon. It is recommended that all patients be followed up for a minimum of 10 years and that all patients in stages II and III receive postoperative radiotherapy. The presence of myasthenia gravis is no longer considered as an adverse factor in survival. 
Rhabdomyolysis following total hip arthroplasty. We report six cases of contralateral limb involvement during total hip arthroplasty including swelling of the gluteal muscle compartments, rhabdomyolysis, myoglobinuria, and sciatic nerve palsy. The risk factors for such complications include obesity, prolonged operative time, and positioning in the lateral decubitus position. The laboratory and clinical findings are consistent with a gluteal muscle crush-injury with consequent compartment syndrome. The patients should be treated conservatively as symptoms can be expected to resolve. 
Usefulness of the corticotropin-releasing hormone test during bilateral inferior petrosal sinus sampling for the diagnosis of Cushing's disease. Inferior petrosal sinus blood sampling for ACTH measurement (IPSS) is used for the differential diagnosis of ACTH-dependent Cushing's syndrome and for the preoperative location of pituitary microadenomas. Intermittent ACTH secretion from pituitary adenomas may result in insignificant differences between petrosal and peripheral ACTH levels at the time of sampling. Thus, pituitary stimulation during IPSS may improve the procedure. The aim of the study was to evaluate the usefulness of CRH injection in combination with IPSS. Twenty-two patients with Cushing's disease (CD; 5 macroadenomas, 16 microadenomas, and 1 corticotroph hyperplasia) and 5 patients with ectopic ACTH syndrome were studied. Bilateral IPSS was successfully carried out on 25 patients. Patients with ectopic ACTH syndrome had, before and after CRH injection, central to peripheral ACTH gradients below 1.7. Four patients with CD had basal gradients below 1.4. After CRH administration all patients with CD had gradients above 3.2. Despite correct location of central catheters, the predicted location of pituitary microadenomas was erroneous in 41% of the cases. It was not improved after CRH injection. In conclusion, the combination of CRH injection with IPSS was useful for the differential diagnosis of ACTH-dependent Cushing's syndrome, as it increased the discrimination of the procedure. On the contrary, it was useless for the preoperative location of pituitary microadenomas, which was poorly predicted by IPSS. 
Enhancement of ischaemic rabbit skin flap survival with the antioxidant and free-radical scavenger N-acetylcysteine. 1. The burst of damaging oxygen free-radicals at the time of reperfusion is one of the crucial factors affecting skin flap survival after an ischaemic interval. In these experiments the efficacy of the antioxidant and free-radical scavenger N-acetylcysteine in improving the survival of ischaemic rabbit epigastric skin flaps was tested. 2. At the time of reperfusion flaps were given: (1) balanced salt solution by intravenous whole-body administration, (2) N-acetylcysteine (200 mg/kg) by intravenous whole-body administration, (3) balanced salt solution by intra-arterial infusion into the flap, (4) N-acetylcysteine (20 mg/kg) by intra-arterial infusion into the flap, or (5) N-acetylcysteine (200 mg/kg) by intra-arterial infusion into the flap. Flap survival at 1 week, and tissue levels of parameters related to free-radical production, blood levels of thromboxane B2 and peripheral resistance during reperfusion were determined. 3. Compared with controls (groups 1 and 3) which had flap survival rates (expressed as percentage surface area surviving) of 27.1% and 31.6%, respectively. N-acetylcysteine treatment in group 2 (55.2%) and group 4 (51.9%) resulted in significant (P less than 0.05) improvements in flap survival. The survival rate in group 5 (37.7%) was not significantly better than that of the controls. 4. N-Acetylcysteine significantly reduced parameters related to free-radical production in the skin flap after 30 min of reperfusion, determined as tissue levels of malonyldialdehyde and protein oxidation products. There was also a significant decrease in peripheral resistance when low-dose N-acetylcysteine (group 4) was infused intra-arterially into the flap. 
Comparison of neuroendocrine activation in patients with left ventricular dysfunction with and without congestive heart failure. A substudy of the Studies of Left Ventricular Dysfunction (SOLVD). Neuroendocrine activation is known to occur in patients with congestive heart failure, but there is uncertainty as to whether this occurs before or after the presence of overt symptoms. In the Studies of Left Ventricular Dysfunction (SOLVD), a multicenter study of patients with ejection fractions of 35% or less, we compared baseline plasma norepinephrine, plasma renin activity, plasma atrial natriuretic factor, and plasma arginine vasopressin in 56 control subjects, 151 patients with left ventricular dysfunction (no overt heart failure), and 81 patients with overt heart failure before randomization. Median values for plasma norepinephrine (p = 0.0001), plasma atrial natriuretic factor (p less than 0.0001), plasma arginine vasopressin (p = 0.006), and plasma renin activity (p = 0.03) were significantly higher in patients with left ventricular dysfunction than in normal control subjects. Neuroendocrine values were highest in patients with overt heart failure. Plasma renin activity was normal in patients with left ventricular dysfunction without heart failure who were not receiving diuretics and was significantly increased (p less than 0.05) in patients on diuretic therapy. We conclude that neuroendocrine activation occurs in patients with left ventricular dysfunction and no heart failure. Neuroendocrine activation is further increased as overt heart failure ensues and diuretics are added to therapy. 
Use of azathioprine or 6-mercaptopurine in the treatment of Crohn's disease. The efficacy and safety of therapy with azathioprine/6-mercaptopurine was studied in 78 patients with Crohn's disease. Mean duration of therapy was 1.6 years; 52 patients were treated greater than or equal to 6 months. All patients were also on other antiinflammatory medications. Evaluations included self-assessment and physician's assessment of well-being, functional capacity, general clinical response, clinical activities indices (National Foundation for Ileitis and Colitis/International Organization for the Study of Inflammatory Bowel Disease and Harvey-Bradshaw), and achievement of specific therapeutic goals. General clinical condition improved in 70% of the patients. Median response time was 3 months. The average Harvey-Bradshaw score decreased 37% with therapy, and a decrease of greater than or equal to 30% occurred in 66% of the subjects. An overall 72% achievement rate for specified therapeutic goals included controlling refractory disease, 73%; corticosteroid "sparing," 76%; and lessening fistulization, 63%. Nine patients got worse despite therapy. Adverse effects requiring discontinuation of therapy occurred in 10%, whereas dosages were briefly lowered for mild side effects in another 10%. This study demonstrates the effectiveness and safety of azathioprine/6-mercaptopurine in the majority of selected patients with chronic, unremitting, or steroid-requiring Crohn's disease. 
Clinical, biochemical, and morphological correlates in patients bearing growth hormone-secreting pituitary tumors with or without constitutively active adenylyl cyclase. Somatic mutations in the alpha-chain (alpha s) of the stimulatory regulatory protein of adenylyl cyclase (Gs) causing constitutive activation of the enzyme have been identified in a subset of human GH-secreting pituitary adenomas. This study reports on the differences between acromegalic patients bearing tumors without (group 1; n = 51) or with (group 2; n = 29) this alteration. No difference in age, sex, clinical features, duration of the disease, or cure rate was observed between the two groups. By contrast, group 2 patients had higher basal GH levels than group 1. Moreover, a significant difference in sellar morphology was found; group 2 patients more frequently showed sellas of normal size (grade I) than group 1. Hypersecretory activity of group 2 tumors was also apparent at electron microscopy; contrary to those of group 1, cells of group 2 tumors were densely granulated and showed prominent rough endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi complex. With respect to group 1, group 2 patients were less responsive to GH-releasing hormone, while they were more sensitive to somatostatin- and dopamine-induced GH inhibition. These results suggest that patients with constitutively active adenylyl cyclase have hyperactive tumors; the sensitivity of these tumors to inhibitory agents (somatostatin and dopamine), possibly counteracting the expression of activating mutations, might explain the low rate of tumor growth. 
Hearing improvement after acoustic tumor removal. Hearing improvement after removal of an acoustic tumor is an uncommon occurrence. Hearing improvement was observed in 8.5% of acoustic tumor removals performed using the middle fossa approach in an attempt to preserve hearing. Improvement in speech discrimination occurred most frequently and was of greatest magnitude compared with changes in the speech reception threshold or pure-tone average. No preoperative factors were predictive of postoperative hearing improvement. Findings support the conclusion that candidates for hearing preservation surgery should be chosen on the merits of their existing preoperative hearing and not on the basis of anticipated improvement. 
Diabetes Intervention Study. Multi-intervention trial in newly diagnosed NIDDM. OBJECTIVE: In a randomized 5-yr multi-intervention trial, we tested the efficacy of intensified health education (IHE) in improving metabolic control and reducing the level of coronary risk factors and incidence of ischemic heart disease (IHD). RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Within the intervention group, the benefit of clofibric acid was evaluated in a double-blind study. One thousand one hundred thirty-nine newly diagnosed middle-aged (30- to 55-yr-old) patients with non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM) entered the study. They were classified as diet controlled after a 6-wk screening phase with conventional dietary treatment. During the follow-up, the control group (n = 378) was cared for at different diabetes outpatient clinics with a standardized surveillance. The intervention group (n = 761) had a structured IHE that included dietary advice, antismoking and antialcohol education, and ways to enhance physical activity. RESULTS: Randomly, 379 of the IHE patients received 1.6 g clofibric acid/day, and the others received placebo. IHE resulted in improved glucose control (adjusted fasting blood glucose) levels after 5 yr (control subjects 9.27 mM, IHE group 8.71 mM, and IHE plus clofibric acid group 8.60 mM, P less than 0.01). The better glycemic control was achieved with fewer antidiabetic drugs. After 5 yr, antidiabetic drugs were prescribed to 47% of the control subjects, 28% of the IHE group, and 34% of the IHE plus clofibric acid group (cutoff limit for drug application was postprandial blood glucose of greater than or equal to 13.87 mM). The ratio of polyunsaturated to saturated fatty acids (0.26 vs. 0.40, P less than 0.01) and physical activity (174 vs. 327 scores, P less than 0.01) were increased, and blood pressure, tobacco, and alcohol consumption were significantly reduced by IHE. However, IHE had no effect on calorie intake, percentage of fat in the diet (45%), and body weight. The most important finding was the significant increase of blood cholesterol in all three groups (+0.47, +0.36, and +0.34 mM, respectively). Clofibric acid only prevented the increase of triglyceride levels (+0.56, +0.24, and +0.05 mM, respectively). The incidence rate per 1000 for myocardial infarction was 30.3 for control subjects, 53.6 for the IHE group, and 55.6 for the IHE plus clofibric acid group. The corresponding rates for IHD incidence were 90.9, 97.8, and 98.8, respectively. Men suffered more frequently from myocardial infarction, whereas women developed ECG criteria for IHD more frequently. Among the 35 cases of death, besides cardiovascular diseases, liver cirrhosis and neoplasia were the predominant causes. The death rate per 1000 in control subjects was 46.2, 30.6 in the IHE group, and 27 among patients with IHE plus clofibric acid. CONCLUSIONS: IHE was of substantial benefit for the control of glycemia, significantly diminished the need for antidiabetic drugs, and reduced a cluster of risk factors but had no effect on the control of blood lipids. This could be one major reason for the failure of IHE, effective lowering of blood pressure, and clofibric acid to prevent cardiovascular complications. Clofibric acid was only effective in reducing triglycerides. 
Epidemiology of colonic symptoms and the irritable bowel syndrome. Functional gastrointestinal disease is believed to be very common, but reports of its prevalence have not usually evaluated random community samples, and validated questionnaires have not been used to elicit symptoms. The prevalence of specific colonic symptoms and the irritable bowel syndrome among representative middle-aged whites was determined from a defined population, and the impact of these symptoms on presentation for medical care was measured. An age- and sex-stratified random sample of 1021 residents of Olmsted County, Minnesota, aged 30-64 years, was obtained. All subjects were mailed a valid self-report questionnaire that identified gastrointestinal symptoms and functional gastrointestinal disorders. The response rate was 82% (n = 835). The age- and sex-adjusted prevalence of abdominal pain (more than six times in the prior year) was 26.2 per 100 (95% confidence interval, 23.1-29.2). The prevalence of chronic constipation (hard stools and straining and/or less than 3 stools per week greater than 25% of the time) was 17.4 (95% confidence interval, 14.8-20.0), whereas the prevalence of chronic diarrhea (loose watery stools, and/or greater than 3 stools per day greater than 25% of the time) was 17.9 (95% confidence interval, 15.3-20.5). The prevalence of abdominal pain and disturbed defecation was similar in women and men, except that infrequent defecation and straining at stool were more common in women. Using the Manning symptom criteria to identify irritable bowel syndrome (greater than or equal to 2 of 6 symptoms in those with abdominal pain more than six times in the prior year), the prevalence of irritable bowel syndrome was 17.0 per 100 (95% confidence interval, 14.4-19.6). Overall, 71 persons (9%) reported visiting a physician for abdominal pain or disturbed defecation in the prior year; a subset of variables related to pain severity were the best predictors of health care seeking after adjustment for age and gender. However, these accounted for only 22% of the log likelihood. In conclusion, more than one third of an unselected middle-aged population reported chronic abdominal pain or disturbed defecation, and more than one in six had symptoms compatible with the irritable bowel syndrome. Only a minority had presented for medical evaluation; moreover, the characteristics of the abdominal complaints did not explain the seeking of health care in most cases. 
The development of penicillin-resistant oral streptococci after repeated penicillin prophylaxis. Oral streptococci may cause infective endocarditis in patients with susceptible cardiac disease after dental treatment. Multiple dental visits, each preceded by penicillin prophylaxis, may result in the unwanted development of resistant oral streptococci. This study was undertaken to determine whether resistant oral streptococci would develop after the repeated use of penicillin prophylaxis in healthy adults. Plaque samples were collected from 20 subjects on each Monday for 5 successive weeks. Each subject was administered 2 gm penicillin V followed by 1 gm 6 hours later (standard prophylaxis regimen of the American Heart Association), on three successive Mondays (weeks 2, 3, and 4). The total cultivable oral streptococci and penicillin-resistant oral streptococci were determined for each plaque sample, and representative colonies of resistant streptococci were speciated. During the study, there was a significant increase in the number of subjects who harbored penicillin-resistant oral streptococci. However, with the exception of one subject who had resistant streptococci throughout the study, the number of resistant strains represented only 0.0003% to 0.41% of the total cultivable oral streptococci. 
Snoring and the risk of ischemic brain infarction. To determine if a history of snoring is a risk factor for brain infarction, I conducted a case-control study of risk factors for ischemic stroke using 177 consecutive male patients aged 16-60 (mean 49) years with acute brain infarction. For each patient I chose an age-matched (+/- 6 years) male control. Arterial hypertension, coronary heart disease, snoring (habitually or often), and heavy drinking (greater than 300 g/wk) were risk factors in the stepwise multiple logistic regression analysis. The odds ratio of snoring for brain infarction was 2.13. By McNemar's test this association increased strongly if a history of sleep apnea, excessive daytime sleepiness, and obesity were all present with snoring (odds ratio 8.00). My study indicates that snoring may be a risk factor for ischemic stroke, possibly because of the higher prevalence of an obstructive sleep apnea syndrome among snorers than nonsnorers. 
Kinetic modeling of in vivo--nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy data: 5-fluorouracil in liver and liver tumors. Kinetic modeling has been applied to the time course of the nuclear magnetic resonance signal intensities of 5-fluorouracil and the sum of its catabolites, alpha-fluoro-beta-ureido propanoic acid and alpha-fluoro-beta-alanine, as monitored in liver tumors of seven patients with cancer after brief intraarterial infusion of 5-fluorouracil. Because these data represent only relative tissue concentrations, only ratios of clearance and volume parameters can be estimated (e.g., clearance/central volume of distribution or central volume of distribution/steady-state volume of distribution). On the other hand, parameters that do not refer to volumes, such as half-lives or maximal velocity of metabolic conversion of a nonlinear model, can be estimated in absolute terms. A nonlinear three-compartment model gave satisfactory fits with all of the individual data sets. Kinetics of 5-fluorouracil and catabolites were similar in five patients with metastases of colorectal adenocarcinomas but differed from those of two patients with cholangiocarcinoma and metastases of an anaplastic carcinoma of unknown origin, respectively. 
Percutaneous cooling of ischemic myocardium by hypothermic retroperfusion of autologous arterial blood: effects on regional myocardial temperature distribution and infarct size. The effects of synchronized coronary venous retroperfusion of cooled autologous arterial blood on regional myocardial temperature distribution and infarct size were studied in open chest dogs with 3.5 h of left anterior descending coronary artery occlusion. After 30 min of occlusion, the dogs were randomly assigned to one of three groups: 1) untreated control group (n = 5), 2) normothermic retroperfusion group (infusion temperature 32 degrees C) (n = 7), and 3) hypothermic retroperfusion group (infusion temperature 15 degrees C) (n = 7). Regional myocardial temperatures were measured by using needle-tipped thermistors stabbed in the 1) anterior wall distal to the occlusion site, 2) anterior wall proximal to the occlusion site, 3) left lateral wall, 4) posterior wall, and 5) right ventricular free wall. Rectal and pulmonary artery temperatures were also measured. In the hypothermic retroperfusion group, the anterior wall temperature decreased rapidly by 5 degrees C at 15 min of retroperfusion (p less than 0.05 vs. normothermic retroperfusion or untreated control groups), whereas the temperature at other sites decreased with a linear trend over time. Myocardial temperatures in the ischemic area (distal anterior wall) were generally lower than those in the other sites during the first 60 min of hypothermic retroperfusion and the largest intramyocardial temperature difference (3.6 degrees C) was found at 15 min after retroperfusion. Infarct size expressed as a percent of the risk area was significantly smaller in the hypothermic retroperfusion group (6.2 +/- 3.3%) than in the control (64.9 +/- 14%) or normothermic retroperfusion groups (24.1 +/- 6.7%). 
Comprehensive evaluation and treatment of 75 men referred to chronic prostatitis clinic. We investigated the role of genitourinary tract infections, structural and psychologic abnormalities in 75 men referred to a "chronic prostatitis" clinic. Patients had had symptoms for an average of eighty-three months and had received an average of ten weeks of antimicrobial treatment during the three months prior to evaluation. Specific infectious diseases, structural or functional causes were identified in 34 (45%) of the 75 patients. Genitourinary tract pathogens were isolated from 26 patients and inflammation was documented in urethral or prostatic secretions of 24 patients. Structural or functional abnormalities that merited treatment were identified in 8 cases. In addition, major criteria for depression were documented in 9 of 17 patients who agreed to this evaluation. Overall, a comprehensive approach to diagnosis led to specific treatment for 37 (49%) of the 75 men with chronic prostatitis, despite longstanding symptoms and failure of multiple prior courses of therapy. 
A new anticancer drug delivery system for the management of carcinomatous peritonitis. To develop a new drug delivery system for the treatment of carcinomatous peritonitis, we constructed 5-fluorouracil poly L-microcapsules (5Fu-mc) by the organic phase separation technique and examined their drug-releasing capacities and anticancer effects. The microcapsules consisted of in vitro dissolvable polymolecular poly L-lactic acid and 5-fluorouracil (5Fu). The 5Fu-mc was about 200 microns in diameter and had a 5Fu content of about 40% (weight/weight). 5Fu-release time from the microcapsules was about 50 hours in vitro and about 48 hours in vivo. After the release of the 5Fu, the poly L-lactic acid was metabolized very slowly in the peritoneal cavity. The 5Fu-mc caused fewer side effects than the equivalent dose of a 5Fu solution. In addition, macroscopic and microscopic examinations of various abdominal organs revealed no toxic effects from the microcapsules. After administration of 5Fu-mc into the abdominal cavity of rats with AH-130 carcinomatous peritonitis, the 5Fu concentration remained at a high level for an extended period in the ascites but fell rapidly to low levels in the plasma. In conclusion, the present studies indicated that the 5Fu-mc were much more effective in prolonging the life of tumor-bearing hosts while producing less systemic side effects than a 5Fu solution. 
Acyclovir therapy in neonates. STUDY OBJECTIVE: To determine the pharmacokinetic parameters of acyclovir disposition in neonates with renal dysfunction. DESIGN: Prospective sequential open enrollment of neonates with presumed herpes group virus infections. SETTING: Neonatal intensive care units in the greater Minneapolis-St. Paul metropolitan area. PATIENTS: Sixteen neonates with gestational ages between 27 and 40 weeks (median 38 weeks) were given acyclovir between days 1 and 56 of life to treat presumed herpes virus infections. Six infants were critically ill with multisystem disease, five infants had hepatic failure and underwent blood exchange transfusion, and five infants had renal failure. A mean of four (range 1 to 19) serum acyclovir concentrations per patient were measured by radioimmunoassay. Pharmacokinetic parameters were calculated from acyclovir concentrations in 46 samples from 16 patients. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: The pharmacokinetic disposition of acyclovir was described as a two-compartment model. Although the ranges for acyclovir clearance and terminal elimination (t 1/2 beta) were wide, a statistically significant relationship was demonstrated between clearance and beta versus serum creatinine concentration. The average t 1/2 beta for infants with serum creatinine level less than 1 mg/dl (88 mumol/L) was 5.0 hours, and 15.6 hours for those with serum creatinine level greater than 1 mg/dl. CONCLUSIONS: Neonates with hepatic or renal dysfunction or young premature infants accumulate acyclovir when dosed without adjustment for organ dysfunction. Measurement of serum creatinine or creatinine clearance can be useful in the dosing of acyclovir in neonates. 
Blood loss after total knee replacement. Effects of tourniquet release and continuous passive motion. We prospectively studied the cases of 121 patients who were being operated on for insertion of a unilateral total knee prosthesis with cement, and we placed them randomly in four groups. In Group I, the tourniquet was inflated throughout the operative procedure, and we released it postoperatively after a compressive dressing had been applied; a splint was used postoperatively for three days. In Group II, the tourniquet remained inflated throughout the operation, but no splint was applied postoperatively, and continuous passive motion was started immediately in the recovery room. In Group III, the tourniquet was released intraoperatively, and hemostasis was achieved by cauterization; postoperatively, a compressive dressing was applied, and a splint was used for three days. In Group IV, the tourniquet was released intraoperatively, hemostasis was established, and then the tourniquet was reinflated; a compressive dressing was applied, and continuous passive motion was started immediately in the recovery room. Hemoglobin and hematocrit values were monitored in all patients. Blood loss in suction drainage was recorded, and the total blood loss was calculated. The results show that total knee arthroplasty is associated with major loss of blood (mean, 1518 milliliters). The calculated blood loss for Groups I, II, and III averaged 1443 milliliters, while that for Group IV averaged 1793 milliliters. Loss in suction drainage correlated with total estimated blood loss and averaged 511 milliliters. The magnitude of blood loss after total knee arthroplasty should be appreciated, and special attention should be paid to the availability of adequate fluid and blood products, preferably blood donated by the patient preoperatively. 
Pregnancy outcome in patients with high titer anti-RNP antibodies. A retrospective study of 40 pregnancies. In a retrospective study the outcome of 40 pregnancies in 20 women with a high titer of anti-RNP antibodies was evaluated. In the 18 pregnancies that occurred after disease onset, transient proteinuria was noted in 3 and transient thrombocytopenia in 2. Deep venous thrombosis was observed in one patient. Preeclampsia in another woman necessitated cesarean sections in 2 pregnancies with successful outcome. The observed complications may all be seen in normal pregnancies. There was no evidence of exacerbation of maternal disease during pregnancy or in the postpartum period. Our study indicates that in women with high anti-RNP titer the risk of fetal loss or maternal worsening of disease seems slight. 
Effusion cytology. Cytologic evaluation is the best way to detect the presence of malignancy in body cavity fluids. Although a positive diagnosis is highly reliable, a negative result does not rule out a malignant cause. Adenocarcinomas, well-differentiated squamous carcinomas, small-cell carcinomas, malignant melanomas, large-cell lymphomas, and acute leukemias are accurately classified when present in effusions. The definitive diagnosis of malignant mesothelioma, small-cell lymphomas, and chronic leukemias, and subclassification of sarcomas and poorly differentiated neoplasms are difficult and may require additional diagnostic techniques. With a few exceptions, the exact causes of benign effusions cannot be determined by cytologic methods. 
Safety of simultaneous aortic reconstruction and renal transplantation. Patients with aortic disease and end-stage renal failure who require both aortic reconstruction and renal transplantation (simultaneously or staged) pose a formidable clinical challenge. Traditionally, the performance of either one of these procedures has been viewed as a relative contraindication to the performance of the other. From 1978 to 1989, eight patients were referred to us with the combination of aortic disease and end-stage renal failure. Seven had aneurysmal disease and one had aorto-iliac occlusive disease. Five patients presented with their diseases sequentially and had two sequential operations, with a mean interval of 4 years between procedures. Three patients presented with their diseases simultaneously and underwent simultaneous aortic reconstruction and living related renal transplantation. All patients were followed up for a mean interval of 4.5 years. By life-table analysis, the 5-year renal graft survival was 100%, the primary aortic graft patency was 82%, and the secondary aortic graft patency was 100%. The only death in this series occurred 11 years after aortic reconstruction and 4 months after a renal transplantation and was due to overwhelming cytomegalovirus sepsis. There were no significant differences between the simultaneous and staged groups in terms of operative mortality, postoperative complications, transplant function, or aortic graft patency. From this experience, we conclude that: (1) patients who present simultaneously with aortic disease and end-stage renal failure can safely undergo simultaneous aortic reconstruction and renal transplantation; (2) patients who present with these two diseases sequentially can undergo a second reconstructive procedure with very low operative morbidity and mortality rates; (3) when these two procedures have been performed sequentially, the second procedure has not significantly altered the 30-day or 5-year results of the first procedure; and (4) the 30-day and 5-year results of each procedure have been excellent regardless of the temporal sequence in which they were performed. 
Biomagnetic localization of ventricular arrhythmias. The magnetic fields caused by electrical activity of the human heart can be coherently measured with a highly sensitive, multichannel, superconducting quantum interference-device system and can enable noninvasive localization of the underlying electrical activity. The magnetocardiograms (MCGs) of 10 patients with spontaneous premature ventricular complexes (PVCs), three patients with ventricular tachycardia (VT), and four healthy subjects with induced paced beats were recorded for 2-15 minutes. After correction for superimposed repolarization activity, the site of origin of the arrhythmias was localized from the magnetic field distribution at the onset of the ectopic beats. The localization results of paced beats showed an error of a few millimeters in relation to the position of the catheter tip. The results of spontaneous PVC and VT were confirmed with endocardial mapping or associated with ischemic lesions. The authors conclude that multichannel magnetocardiographic studies enable the completely noninvasive localization of ventricular arrhythmias. 
Primary tumors of the facial (extracranial) nerve. Nearly 25% of all primary neurogenous tumors arise from peripheral nerves in the head and neck. The extracranial parts of the facial nerve, however, rank low as potential sites. Their tumors nonetheless pose diagnostic and management problems. In the intraparotid location the neurogenous tumors most often present as mass lesions, accompanied, in one third of patients, by various degrees of facial weakness. With the exception of a peculiar predilection of childhood plexiform neurofibromas to afflict the facial nerve, the majority of the tumors are neurilemomas. Recurrences are unusual after surgical removal of either neurilemomas or neurofibromas. The rare facial nerve sarcoma is a high-grade malignancy. 
Giant axonal neuropathy and leukodystrophy. An 11-year-old Persian boy, born to consanguineous parents, manifested a progressive gait abnormality beginning at 5 years of age. A severe cerebellar disorder developed with associated dysfunction of the peripheral nervous system, but no sign of mental impairment. The sensory and motor nerve conduction velocities were greatly reduced, especially in the lower extremities. Cerebrospinal fluid protein was normal. Computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging revealed leukoencephalopathy, especially in the cerebellum, but also in periventricular areas. The diagnosis of giant axonal neuropathy was established by biopsy of the sural nerve. The few previous histologic examinations have documented hyperplasia of the microfibrils which accumulate in the axons as well as in neurilemma, endothelial, and perineural cells. This is the first report of involvement of supraspinal portions of the central nervous system documented by postmortem examination after in vivo imaging methods corroborated the morphologic concomitants of the clinical symptoms. 
Efficacy of intraarterial heparin in maintaining microvascular patency: an experimental model. Human-grade sodium heparin was studied to determine thrombosis model patency rates between an intraarterial infusion versus an intravenous method of delivery in a rabbit model. Specific differences in patency and partial thromboplastin times were studied in each group and compared with a saline-perfused group. Three animal groups (New Zealand white rabbits) were established (total = 35 animals). Standardized femoral arterial 5-mm inversion grafts (AIG) were done in each animal in each group. The animals in the control group received intravenous saline infusion, while the two treatment groups received intravenous heparin (12 animals) or intraarterial heparin (12 animals minus 1 anesthesia death). The route of instillation of the infusate was selected at random after completing the inversion grafts. A proximal epigastric branch was utilized for access in those animals randomized to the intraarterial group. Intravenous delivery was accomplished by means of a femoral venous catheter in the vena cava. A 72-hour period of infusion was used in all animals. A dose of 45 units per hour of heparin following a 500-unit bolus was used in the intravenous group. After an identical bolus dose, 25 units per hour of heparin was administered in the intraarterial group. The control (saline group) was given 1 cc saline (in a volume equal to the heparin-dosed groups) daily for 3 days. Arterial inversion graft patency rates were assessed by direct inspection at day 5. Systemic and regional (i.e., distal to the inversion graft) partial thromboplastin times (PTT) were measured in representative control, IV, and intraarterial heparin-treated groups. Complications were recorded. 
Attaching and effacing enteropathogenic Escherichia coli as a cause of infantile diarrhea in Bangkok. To identify Escherichia coli that cause infantile diarrhea in Bangkok, Thailand, E. coli isolated in a year-long study of infantile diarrhea were examined for O and H serotypes and virulence determinants. Classic enteropathogenic E. coli (EPEC) were isolated from 28 of 509 infants with diarrhea (cases) and 11 of 509 age-matched controls (P = .009; odds ratio [OR], 2.64). Most of this difference was attributable to EPEC adherence factor (EAF)-positive EPEC that produced an attachment and effacement lesion, as identified in the fluorescence actin staining assay, isolated from 13 cases and 1 control (P = .003; OR, 13.3). EAF-EPEC was isolated from 15 cases and 10 controls (P = .418; OR, 1.52) and EAF+ non-EPEC from 17 cases and 10 controls (P = .242; OR, 1.72). EAF+EPEC that caused an attachment and effacement lesion was found in 3% of children less than 6 months old with diarrhea who were studied in an outpatient clinic in Bangkok in 1988. 
Inflammatory pseudotumor of the spleen. Report of two cases with a review of the literature. This study reports two cases of inflammatory pseudotumor of the spleen. The first case was a 57-year-old woman in whom the splenic mass was an incidental finding during evaluation for an acute abdomen due to a perforated, lithiasic gallbladder. The mass in the spleen measured 12.7 cm in greatest dimension. The second case was of a 46-year-old woman with a palpable, left upper quadrant mass. A computed tomography scan revealed a splenic mass and the spleen was removed. The mass measured 12 cm in greatest dimension. In a review of the literature, 13 examples of splenic inflammatory pseudotumor were reported. The age range was 19 to 75 years, with a median age of 50 years. The splenic lesions were either discovered incidentally or manifested by left upper quadrant discomfort and/or mass. Inflammatory pseudotumor of the spleen, although rare, is being increasingly recognized and should be considered in the differential diagnosis of mass lesions of the spleen. 
Sixteenth Daniel C. Baker, Jr, memorial lecture. Surgical management of supraglottic cancer and its lymph node metastases in a conservative perspective. Supraglottic laryngectomy combined with functional elective or curative neck dissection is a priceless contribution toward treatment of supraglottic cancer and its lymph node metastases. The history and background of this conservative approach is reviewed. Results related to staging are presented. Irradiation as a combined or alternative therapy is considered. 
Role of hepatitis delta virus infection in hepatocellular carcinoma. Hepatitis B virus (HBV) DNA integrates into the host DNA and shows a series of potentially oncogenetic properties, but HBV is not an acutely transforming virus, because HCC develops decades after infection. Other factors, namely cirrhosis, inflammation, alcohol intake, and viral superinfections, could promote the oncogenetic process induced by HBV-DNA integration. We studied the impact of HDV infection in the pathogenesis of HCC in 62 consecutive patients. Their mean age was 59 years (range 25-75 years), 54 were male and eight female; 58 had cirrhosis. The findings suggest that HBsAg-positive patients with HDV superinfection developed cirrhosis and HCC at an earlier age than HBsAg carriers without HDV infection. HDV appears to represent a "promotion" factor for HCC in subjects with an oncogenic risk induced by HBV. A long-lasting necroinflammatory lesion of the liver substained by productive HBV and HDV infections may be a major pathogenetic mechanism. 
Chronic dermal ulcer healing enhanced with monophasic pulsed electrical stimulation. The purposes of this randomized, double-blind, multicenter study were to compare healing of chronic dermal ulcers treated with pulsed electrical stimulation with healing of similar wounds treated with sham electrical stimulation and to evaluate patient tolerance to the therapeutic protocol. Forty-seven patients, aged 29 to 91 years, with 50 stage II, III, and IV ulcers were randomly assigned to either a treatment group (n = 26) or a control (sham treatment) group (n = 24). Treated wounds received 30 minutes of pulsed cathodal electrical stimulation twice daily at a pulse frequency of 128 pulses per second (pps) and a peak amplitude of 29.2 mA if the wound contained necrotic tissue or any drainage that was not serosanguinous. A saline-moistened nontreatment electrode was applied 30.5 cm (12 in) cephalad from the wound. This protocol was continued for 3 days after the wound was debrided or exhibited serosanguinous drainage. Thereafter, the polarity of the treatment electrode on the wound was changed every 3 days until the wound progressed to a stage II classification. The pulse frequency was then reduced to 64 pps, and the treatment electrode polarity was changed daily until the wound was healed. Patients in the control group were treated with the same protocol, except they received sham electrical stimulation. After 4 weeks, wounds in the treatment and control groups were 44% and 67% of their initial size, respectively. The healing rates per week for the treatment and control groups were 14% and 8.25%, respectively. The results of this study indicate that pulsed electrical stimulation has a beneficial effect on healing stage II, III, and IV chronic dermal ulcers. 
Levamisole for corticosteroid-dependent nephrotic syndrome in childhood. British Association for Paediatric Nephrology. In children with corticosteroid-responsive nephrotic syndrome who are dependent on high-dose prednisolone, alkylating therapy often fails to maintain a remission, and long-term immunosuppression may be hazardous. An alternative approach to treatment is to use an immunostimulant such as levamisole. 61 children with frequently relapsing corticosteroid sensitive and dependent nephrotic syndrome were randomly allocated to receive levamisole, 2.5 mg/kg on alternate days (31 patients) or placebo (30 patients) for a maximum of 112 days. After entry to the trial, prednisolone was progressively reduced and was stopped by 56 days. The two groups were well matched for age and sex distribution, indices of corticosteroid toxicity, and previous alkylating therapy. 14 patients in the levamisole group and 4 in the placebo group remained in remission at 112 days (log rank analysis p less than 0.01). No significant adverse events were recorded. Levamisole is effective in maintaining a steroid-free remission in this condition and has few side-effects. 
Lack of efficacy of high-dose leucovorin and fluorouracil in patients with advanced pancreatic adenocarcinoma. Leucovorin potentiates the cytotoxicity of fluorouracil (5-FU) in experimental tumor systems and appears to enhance the effectiveness of 5-FU in patients with colon cancer. Twenty-two eligible patients (18 previously untreated) with advanced pancreatic adenocarcinoma were treated in a phase II trial of leucovorin 500 mg/m2/d for 6 days by continuous intravenous infusion with 5-FU 370 mg/m2/d by rapid intravenous injection on 5 consecutive days, beginning 24 hours after initiation of leucovorin infusion. Among the 20 assessable patients, there were no complete or partial regressions, although there was one minor response lasting 4 months. Three patients had stable disease for 5, 20, and 21 months, respectively. Median survival was 10 weeks. Toxicity was predominantly mucosal; stomatitis grade 2 or worse was seen in five patients, and diarrhea grade 2 or worse was seen in four. Hospitalization for toxicity was necessary in four previously untreated patients and three previously treated patients. The median WBC nadir was 4.6 (range, 1.4 to 9.6) x 10(3)/microL, and the median platelet nadir was 147.0 (range, 69.0 to 240.0) x 10(3)/microL. This combination of leucovorin and 5-FU did not demonstrate meaningful therapeutic activity in patients with adenocarcinoma of the pancreas and was associated with moderate to severe toxicity. It should not be considered a standard treatment for patients with this disease. 
Percutaneous placement of Hickman catheters: comparison of sonographically guided and blind techniques. We studied the value of sonographically guided puncture of the subclavian vein for placement of indwelling right atrial and permanent subcutaneously tunneled catheters (Hickman) for long-term venous access. The commonly used blind puncture is associated with complications such as pneumothorax, arterial puncture, and hemothorax. The results and complications of 40 sonographically guided punctures and fluoroscopically controlled catheterizations of the subclavian vein (group 1, 31 patients) performed in the radiology department were compared with those of 40 blind percutaneous punctures and fluoroscopically controlled catheterizations (group 2, 29 patients) performed in the operating room. The patients were selected consecutively. The groups were comparable in age, sex, and indication for catheter placement; administration of chemotherapy for hematologic malignancies was the major indication (group 1, 84%; group 2, 83%). All punctures in group 1 were successful; group 2 had two failures (5%). Puncture-related complications occurred significantly more in group 2 (10%) than in group 1 (0%) (p less than .05). These complications were pneumothorax in three cases and hemothorax in one. Complications not related to the puncture technique were prolonged bleeding at the entrance site (groups 1 and 2, two cases each), local infection (group 1, one case), thrombosis (group 1, three cases; group 2, two), catheter sepsis (group 1, 10 cases; group 2, 14), catheter occlusion (group 2, three cases), and catheter migration (groups 1 and 2, two cases each). We conclude that sonographically guided puncture increases the success rate and significantly decreases the puncture-related complications of percutaneous placement of Hickman catheters. 
Operative laparoscopy with the Nd:YAG laser in the treatment of endometriosis and pelvic adhesions. A multicenter, prospective trial was initiated to test the effectiveness and safety of the Nd:YAG laser equipped with artificial sapphire contact tips for the laparoscopic treatment of pelvic pain. Ninety-three women were enrolled in the study, 37 with endometriosis alone, 47 with endometriosis complicated by pelvic adhesions, and 9 women with adhesions alone. In over 90% of adhesions and 96% of endometriotic implants the Nd:YAG laser could be delivered to the site and be used to restore normal anatomy. The exception was deep bowel involvement with endometriosis, which was not treated. The majority of women had marked reduction or resolution of their symptoms for up to 12 months postoperatively. We conclude that the use of the Nd:YAG laser is an appropriate method to laparoscopically treat pelvic pain resulting from endometriosis or pelvic adhesions. 
Adult lipophagic atrophic panniculitis. We report two patients with chronic, recurrent, nodular panniculitis lesions that later developed areas of lipoatrophy. Histologically, there was a consistent lobular lipophagic replacement of fat cells with lipophagic giant cells. The clinical appearance was that of tender, erythematous, superficial or subcutaneous, symmetrical nodules and plaques of 1-2 weeks' duration. The lesions could occur with episodes of fever. One patient had hepatomegaly and the other had an increased sedimentation rate and leucocytosis. The histology and the clinical pattern of the panniculitus syndrome resembled those of lipophagic lipoatrophy of childhood. This is a panniculitis of unknown cause in which the principal inflammatory cell response in the subcutaneous tissue is the macrophage. 
Flow cytometric analysis of peripheral blood lymphocytes in ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease. Using two colour immunofluorescence with fluorescein isothiocyanate and phycoerythrin labelled monoclonal antibodies, multi-parameter flow cytometry was used to examine the antigenic characteristics of peripheral blood lymphocytes in whole blood of patients with ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease who were not taking immunosuppressive drugs. The numbers of CD4+ and CD8+ lymphocytes in patients with ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease remained unchanged so that the CD4/CD8 ratio was the same as that of normal control subjects. In Crohn's disease there were many activated T cells (CD3+, CD25+). Although natural killer cells in active Crohn's disease were lower than in normal control subjects, cytotoxic T lymphocytes, as defined by CD3+, CD16+, did not differ in patients with inflammatory bowel disease compared with normal control subjects. For B cell subsets, there were differences in Leu-1+ B cells, Leu-8+ B cells, Fc epsilon R+B cells (Leu-16+, Leu-20+), and activated B cells (Leu-12+, Leu-21+) between patients with inflammatory bowel disease and normal control subjects. These differences are compatible with local activation of B cells in the inflamed colon. 
Carcinoma of the rectum: a 10-year experience. A consecutive series of 303 patients with carcinoma of the rectum and distal sigmoid colon treated by a single surgeon over a 10-year period are reported. Of these, 202 underwent an anterior resection, 85 an abdominoperineal excision of the rectum and 16 a coloanal anastomosis. Surgery was considered palliative in 52 patients undergoing anterior resection and 24 undergoing abdominoperineal resection. The 30-day hospital mortality rate was six patients (3 per cent) for anterior resection and two patients (2 per cent) for abdominoperineal resection. Peroperative anastomotic testing demonstrated leakage in five stapled anastomoses; these were rectified and no clinical sequelae occurred. Two patients (1 per cent) developed a clinical anastomotic leak, one of which proved fatal; in each case the intraoperative test was negative. The overall 5-year survival rate was 64 per cent after anterior resection and 52 per cent after abdominoperineal resection; the median follow-up was 64 months. The incidence of local pelvic recurrence was 6.4 per cent after anterior resection and 14 per cent after abdominoperineal (not significant). These results confirm the success of sphincter-saving anterior resection combined with total mesorectal excision, routine full mobilization of the splenic flexure and cancercidal lavage of the distal rectum in the treatment of low rectal carcinomas; morbidity, local recurrence and survival are not compromised. 
Internal mammary artery to lung parenchyma fistula after aortocoronary bypass grafting. Two unusual cases of internal mammary artery fistulization to lung parenchyma after coronary revascularization are reported. They were incidentally discovered during coronary angiography, and one of them was successfully closed with a percutaneous transvenous coil-spring occluder. The cause is thought to be the direct contact between the dissected mammary artery pedicle and the lung parenchyma. 
Diffuse neonatal hemangiomatosis: a new constellation of findings. Diffuse neonatal hemangiomatosis is a rare, frequently fatal disease characterized by multiple cutaneous and visceral hemangiomas. The skin, liver, lungs, intestines, and central nervous system are the most commonly affected organs. Death can result from high-output cardiac failure as a result of arteriovenous shunting. In this report we present a new constellation of findings in a patient with diffuse neonatal hemangiomatosis, namely, an absent corpus callosum, ectopia cordis (sternal agenesis) with median abdominal raphe, and tricuspid atresia. 
Laparotomy closure reinforced with buried polyglyconate retention sutures. A method of laparotomy closure using continuous no. 0 polyglycolic acid suture for accurate fascial approximation and buried retention sutures of no. 1 polyglyconate for prolonged wound strength is described. Both security and anatomical precision in fascial closure are achieved without the use of nonabsorbable suture material. This method of laparotomy closure is suitable for patients at high risk for fascial dehiscence. 
Adjuvant radiation therapy in patients with detectable prostate specific antigen following radical prostatectomy. Adjuvant radiation therapy following radical prostatectomy for adenocarcinoma of the prostate was given to 25 patients. Of these patients 8 had microscopic lymph node metastasis, 8 had seminal vesicle invasion without positive lymph nodes, 6 had positive surgical margins and 3 had only capsule penetration. Their only evidence of residual disease was detectable serum prostate specific antigen (PSA) by the Yang assay. A total of 15 patients (60%) had a subsequent decrease in PSA to less than 0.3 ng./ml. and an additional 5 (20%) had a decrease in PSA by more than 50%. Currently 8 patients have no detectable PSA after a median followup of 18 months (17 to 38 months) since initiating radiation therapy. Only 1 of 12 patients with detectable PSA immediately after radical prostatectomy has had a durable response to adjuvant radiation therapy. In contrast 7 of 13 patients with a delayed increase in PSA had a durable response. The ability of adjuvant radiation therapy to eliminate serum PSA in patients with a delayed increase in PSA after radical prostatectomy is encouraging. However, longer followup, including the use of nonradiated control subjects, is needed to assess the ability of adjuvant radiation therapy to control local disease and prolong patient survival. 
Combined portal vein and liver resection for carcinoma of the biliary tract. Twenty-nine patients with advanced carcinoma of the bile duct or gallbladder underwent combined portal vein and liver resection. Segmental excision of the portal vein was performed in 16 cases and wedge resection of the vessel wall in 13. The operative mortality rate was 17 per cent. The median survival for the 24 patients who left hospital was 19.8 months. Actuarial survival rates at 1, 3 and 5 years for all 29 patients were 48 per cent, 29 per cent, and 6 per cent respectively, whereas the median survival for 46 patients with unresectable carcinoma was 3 months and the 1 and 3-year actuarial survival rates were 13 per cent and zero respectively. This difference in survival times between patients undergoing hepatectomy with portal vein resection and those with unresectable carcinoma were statistically significant (P less than 0.01). Combined portal vein and liver resection is recommended as a reasonable surgical approach in selected patients with advanced carcinoma of the biliary tract. 
Soluble interleukin 2 receptor levels in serum and its relationship to T cell abnormality and clinical manifestations of the disease in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus. Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is associated with alterations in immune regulation that results in T cell activation and release of the soluble interleukin 2 receptors (sIL-2R) in serum. SLE, a disease with varied clinical manifestations also has regulatory T cell subset abnormalities in blood. Levels of sIL-2R in serum of patients with active SLE were higher than in those with other common rheumatic diseases. Patients with active SLE and an increased percentage of CD4+ CDw29+ helper inducer (memory) and decreased percentage of CD4+ CD45R+ suppressor inducer (virgin) T cell subsets in blood demonstrated elevated levels of sIL-2R in serum. When compared with clinical manifestations of the disease, the sIL-2R levels in the sera of the patients with active SLE and thrombocytopenia were higher (mean 1710 units/ml) than those in active SLE with nephrotic syndrome (mean 1230 units/ml) or in active SLE with central nervous system disease (mean 1157 units/ml). However, patients with active SLE with humoral immunodeficiency (hypogammaglobulinemia) had highly elevated levels of sIL-2R in serum as compared to other patients with active SLE. The highly elevated levels of sIL-2R in serum may indicate that in vivo T cell activation plays an important role in this disease. 
Predictive value of ventricular arrhythmias for patency of the infarct-related coronary artery after thrombolytic therapy. In animal studies reperfusion of coronary arteries is commonly accompanied by ventricular arrhythmias. It is not certain, however, whether ventricular arrhythmias can be used as a reliable non-invasive marker of reperfusion in humans. Two-channel Holter recordings were obtained from the start of an intravenous infusion of streptokinase until coronary angiography (2.8 (2.7) hours (mean SD)) afterwards) in 57 patients with acute myocardial infarction of less than four hours who were generally not treated with antiarrhythmic drugs. Ventricular arrhythmias occurred in 21 (37%) of the 57 patients: accelerated idioventricular rhythm in 13 patients and non-sustained ventricular tachycardia in 15 patients. Seven patients had both accelerated idioventricular rhythm and non-sustained ventricular tachycardia. Coronary angiography showed a patent infarct-related vessel in 12 (92%) of the 13 patients with accelerated idioventricular rhythm (95% confidence interval 66 to 99%), in 22 (50%) of the 44 patients without accelerated idioventricular rhythm (95% CI 34 to 66%), in 11 (73%) of the 15 patients with non-sustained ventricular tachycardia (95% CI 45 to 92%), and in 23 (55%) (95% CI 39 to 71%) of the 42 patients who did not have non-sustained ventricular tachycardia. Seventeen (81%) of the 21 patients with accelerated idioventricular rhythm, or non-sustained ventricular tachycardia, or both, had a patent infarct-related vessel (95% CI 58 to 94%) as did 17 (47%) of the 36 patients with no ventricular arrhythmia (95% CI 29 to 65%). In patients with accelerated idioventricular rhythm after thrombolysis the infarct-related vessel is almost certain to be patent; but the infarct-related coronary artery can still be patent when no arrhythmia is seen. 
Clinical usefulness of amitriptyline in fibromyalgia: the results of 23 N-of-1 randomized controlled trials. Twenty-three double blind, randomized, multiple crossover trials (N-of-1 RCT) of amitriptyline were conducted in patients with fibromyalgia. The benefit of amitriptyline was assessed using a symptom questionnaire and count of tender points. To assess the usefulness of the method, the proportion of trials that provided a definite answer was examined. Completing the trial resulted in reaching a high degree of confidence in the final management decision in 74% of trials. In 35% of trials, results led to discontinuation of the drug which otherwise would have been continued indefinitely. The drug benefit, if present, was evident within first 2 weeks of therapy. We concluded that these results support the feasibility and usefulness of N-of-1 RCT in rheumatology practice. 
Fatal varicella-zoster virus meningoradiculitis without skin involvement. A 77-year-old man with T-cell lymphoma developed an acute fatal meningoradiculitis of cranial nerve roots and cauda equina, pathologically and virologically confirmed to be caused by varicella-zoster virus. This is the first report of fatal varicella-zoster virus-induced neurological disease in the absence of skin lesions. Varicella-zoster virus should be included in the differential diagnosis of acute radiculoneuropathy in the immunocompromised patient, particularly because antiviral treatment for varicella-zoster virus exists. 
Situational and psychophysiological factors in psychologically induced pain. To investigate pain that occurs in the absence of painful stimulation, normal subjects were connected to a sham stimulator and were told that a headache could occur as a result of the electrical current they would receive. Half of the subjects who received this suggestion reported pain. The frequency and intensity of pain reports in a group which was given prior pain experience as a reference point in reporting pain and in a group which was exposed to a manipulation designed to reduce intentional deception were not significantly different from the pain reports of a group not exposed to these manipulations. The frequency of pain reports in subjects not connected to the sham stimulator but still asked to report pain was 25% which was significantly less than the frequency for subjects who were told there would be stimulation to the head. Pain ratings increased as the settings of the sham stimulator were increased. Subjects who reported pain had significantly fewer electrodermal responses to tones signaling them to prepare for a reaction time task. The results suggest that pain can be produced in the absence of peripheral stimulation. The pain does not appear to be due to intentional deception or the lack of a standard for comparison, but is strongly influenced by environmental cues. Psychophysiologically, pain responders were less attentive to signal stimuli. 
Relationship of HBsAg subtypes with HBeAg/anti-HBe status and chronic liver disease. Part I: Analysis of 1744 HBsAg carriers. A total of 1744 HBsAg carriers were investigated to determine whether there are clinical differences among HBsAg subtypes or not. Although adr was more predominant than adw in 1078 asymptomatic carriers as well as in 666 carriers with liver dysfunction, the adr carriers had liver dysfunction more frequently than the adw carriers (p = 0.005). In addition, the adr carriers were more often positive for HBeAg and less often positive for anti-HBe than the adw carriers (p less than 0.001). Multivariate analyses indicated that the HBsAg subtypes were associated with liver dysfunction not directly but through the relationship between the HBsAg subtypes and HBeAg/anti-HBe status. HBeAg/anti-HBe status of each age bracket in the adr carriers and in the adw carriers suggested that adr carriers are seroconverted later than adw carriers. In conclusion, HBsAg subtypes may affect the development of chronic liver disease, through their association with HBeAg/anti-HBe status. 
Recurrent hepatocellular carcinoma after partial hepatectomy: value of treatment with transcatheter arterial chemoembolization. The usefulness of transcatheter arterial chemoembolization (TACE) of the hepatic artery was retrospectively evaluated in 66 patients who underwent the procedure for treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma that recurred after partial hepatectomy. The materials infused were Gelfoam sponge or Gelfoam sponge plus Lipiodol and an anticancer agent. A control group of 15 patients with recurrent tumor received oral anticancer agents alone. The cumulative survival rate for the TACE group was 88% for the first year, 57% for 2 years, 42% for 3 years, and 27% for 5 years, whereas that of the control group was 80% for the first year, 27% for 2 years, and 18% for 3 years. Thus, the prognosis of the TACE group was significantly better (p less than or equal to .01, log-rank test) than that of the control group. The survival rate was inversely correlated with the ratio of the volume of the recurrent tumor to the volume of the whole residual liver. These results suggest that TACE is more effective than oral chemotherapy for treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma that recurs after partial hepatectomy. 
Suppression of chronic myelogenous leukemia colony growth by interleukin-1 (IL-1) receptor antagonist and soluble IL-1 receptors: a novel application for inhibitors of IL-1 activity. In this study, we investigated the role of interleukin-1 beta (IL-1 beta) in the malignant evolution of chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) and the functional activity of IL-1 inhibitors. Bone marrow (BM) and peripheral blood (PB) low-density cells from 38 CML patients were studied in the colony-forming unit-granulocyte, erythrocyte, monocyte, megakaryocyte colony culture assay. Samples from patients with early stage, interferon-alpha (IFN)-sensitive disease formed hematopoietic colonies in the presence of fetal calf serum (FCS), erythropoietin (Epo), and one of the following: granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (10 ng/mL), IL-3 (15 ng/mL), both, or phytohemagglutinin-conditioned medium. The addition of IL-1 beta augmented IFN-sensitive CML colony growth in a dose-dependent manner at concentrations of 10 to 100 U/mL. In sharp contrast, addition of the above growth factors did not augment the colony growth-promoting effect of FCS and Epo in samples from IFN-resistant patients; further, adherent cell fractionation or T-lymphocyte depletion attenuated the "autonomous" colony growth. Lysates of 2.5 x 10(7) low-density cells from each of six IFN-resistant and six IFN-sensitive CML patients and three normal volunteers were tested for intrinsic IL-1 beta content in an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and yielded a mean of 610 pg, 54.6 pg, and 49.4 pg of IL-1 beta, respectively (P less than .045). Interestingly, both soluble IL-1 receptors (sIL-1R) and IL-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1RA) at concentrations of 5 to 100 ng/mL (sIL-1R) and 10 to 500 ng/mL (IL-1RA) inhibited CML colony growth in a dose-dependent fashion, with maximal inhibition of 64% and 65%, respectively. A similar effect was noted with the use of anti-IL-1 beta neutralizing antibodies. These data implicate IL-1 beta in CML disease progression and suggest that the inhibitory effects of molecules such as sIL-1R and IL-1RA could conceivably be the basis of a novel therapeutic strategy against this disorder. 
The incontinent myelodysplastic patient. Urinary incontinence is a socially devastating aspect of the lives of many myelodysplastic children. Incontinence results from abnormal bladder storage function, urethral sphincteric incompetence, or both. Unfortunately, the vesicourethral dysfunction in an individual patient cannot be discerned from the level of the vertebral defect or the coexisting neurologic deficits. Therefore, thorough urodynamic assessment is required to identify altered physiology precisely and to guide rational treatment. Our therapeutic armamentarium includes external devices, intermittent self-catheterization, pharmacologic therapy, prosthetics, electrical stimulation, biofeedback, and innovative surgical procedures. Comprehensive evaluation, thoughtful tailoring of therapy to the individual patient, and a commitment by the urologist to indefinite follow-up will enable most patients to attain social continence while preserving renal function. 
Effect of plasma from patients with essential hypertension on vascular resistance in the isolated perfused rat kidney. 1. Isolated perfused rat kidneys were used to study the effects of plasma fractions obtained by gel filtration from essential hypertensive patients (n = 40) and from normotensive subjects (n = 36) on resistance vessels. Perfusion pressure was recorded at a constant flow. 2. Plasma fractions were obtained by gel filtration and contained substances with a molecular mass in the range 1000-1500 Da. The plasma fractions from hypertensive patients used in this study had been shown to increase blood pressure after intravenous injection in rats. 3. In the isolated rat kidneys, the hypertensive fractions increased perfusion pressure by 20 +/- 17 mmHg (mean +/- SD, range 5-58 mmHg, n = 40). The analogous fractions from normotensive subjects did not change perfusion pressure significantly. 4. In Ca2(+)-free medium containing 2 mmol/l ethyleneglycol bis-(aminoethyl ether)tetra-acetate, the change in perfusion pressure induced by active plasma fractions was reduced by 95.2 +/- 6.3%. Addition of nifedipine to the perfusion medium reduced, but did not abolish, the pressure response of the kidneys. 5. In solutions containing phentolamine or saralasin, vasoconstriction was not reduced. 6. Thus in the active fractions from hypertensive plasma, a vasopressor agent with direct action on resistance vessels can be demonstrated. This substance probably acts by increasing Ca2+ influx in vascular smooth muscle cells. 
DNA diagnosis for hereditary cerebral hemorrhage with amyloidosis (Dutch type) Hereditary cerebral hemorrhage with amyloidosis of the Dutch type (HCHWA-D) is tightly linked to the Alzheimer amyloid precursor protein gene on chromosome 21, which codes for the amyloid beta-protein. A point mutation detected at position 1852 of the amyloid precursor protein gene in four HCHWA-D patients was hypothesized to be the basic defect. This study proves that 22 HCHWA-D patients from three pedigrees all carry this point mutation, whereas the mutation is absent in escapees from the HCHWA-D families as well as in randomly selected Dutch individuals. A mutation-specific oligonucleotide is now available for the confirmation of the HCHWA-D diagnosis. Therefore, presymptomatic testing and prenatal evaluation of individuals at risk in the HCHWA-D families is now feasible. 
Abdominal distension in female patients with irritable bowel syndrome: exploration of possible mechanisms. Abdominal distension is a common but little understood symptom of the irritable bowel syndrome. The authenticity of the symptom was confirmed by appreciable increases in girth measurement during the day in 20 patients with the irritable bowel syndrome compared with 20 control subjects. Objective corroboration of this finding was shown in the group with the irritable bowel syndrome by a highly significant increase in lateral abdominal 'profile' on computed tomography. Previously postulated mechanisms for distension--namely, retention of gas, depression of the diaphragm, and excess lumbar lordosis--were excluded by the radiological findings. Voluntary protrusion of the abdomen produced a completely different pattern on computed tomography to that observed in the irritable bowel syndrome. These observations suggest that abdominal distension may be related to changes in motility or tone of gastrointestinal smooth muscle.
