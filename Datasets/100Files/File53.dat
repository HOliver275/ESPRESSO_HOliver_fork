Compartment syndrome of the thigh with osteogenesis imperfecta. A case report. Compartment syndrome of the thigh has been sporadically reported in the orthopedic literature. A 27-year-old man with osteogenesis imperfecta sustained a femoral fracture with relatively minor trauma and subsequently developed compartment syndrome of the thigh. Fat embolism syndrome and hyperplastic callus developed postoperatively. 
Regression of hepatic metastases from gastrointestinal leiomyosarcoma after hepatic arterial chemoembolization. Two patients with gastrointestinal leiomyosarcoma metastatic to the liver were treated by hepatic chemoembolization with cisplatin and polyvinyl sponge followed by hepatic arterial infusion of vinblastine. Effective palliation in terms of durable tumor regression was achieved in both patients after two chemoembolization-infusion procedures. These results suggest that regional therapy may offer new hope for the subset of sarcoma patients who have liver metastases resistant to combination systemic chemotherapy. 
The Damus-Fontan procedure. The Damus-Kaye-Stansel operation is a useful technique for the treatment of complex cyanotic congenital heart disease when there is obstruction between the systemic ventricle and the aorta. Modifications of the technique include transection of the aorta and the pulmonary artery, anastomosis of the contiguous aortic and pulmonary walls, and connection of the distal aorta to the perimeter of the new bivalved proximal great artery. In addition, the bidirectional cavopulmonary shunt technique can be used with or without the Fontan procedure. Six patients underwent a Damus-Fontan operation, and all survived. Two patients underwent the Damus-cavopulmonary shunt (hemi-Fontan) procedure, and 1 survived. The postoperative status of the 7 survivors is good to excellent. Follow-up ranges from 2 months to 7 1/2 years. 
Anastomotic obstruction after stapled enteroanastomosis. We have recently treated two cases of anastomotic obstruction after side-to-side stapled enteroanastomosis. Complete obstruction of a stapled small-bowel anastomosis has not been reported to our knowledge. The mechanism of the obstruction appears to be the healing together of the cut edges of viable bowel beyond the inverted stapled lines. An alternative method of constructing the functional end-to-end enteroanastomosis that is offered is intended to prevent the occurrence of postoperative anastomotic obstruction. 
Epidemiologic aspects of shigellosis and other causes of dysentery in Thailand. Nearly 20% of children seen in the outpatient department of Children's Hospital in Bangkok, Thailand, for diarrheal disease had bloody diarrhea. Shigella species and enteroinvasive Escherichia coli--isolated from 13% and 2% of children with diarrhea, respectively--were the most frequent causes of bloody diarrhea. Campylobacter species and nontyphoidal Salmonella species were also isolated frequently but were much less often associated with bloody diarrhea. Shigella species were rarely isolated from patients who did not have diarrhea, while Campylobacter and Salmonella species were isolated frequently from well children. None of the species isolated always caused bloody diarrhea. Studies on infection with Campylobacter suggest that natural immunity may prevent bloody diarrhea and in fact may eventually prevent all disease due to this organism. Studies of endemic Shigella flexneri and epidemic Shigella dysenteriae 1 in Thailand have shown that immunity may also explain an age-related decrease in rates of S. flexneri infection but not in rates of S. dysenteriae 1 isolation. 
Cerebrovascular disease in hypertensive blacks. There is convincing evidence that all grades of persistent diastolic hypertension, especially in blacks, should be treated in order to prevent stroke and other cardiovascular complications. Studies are now in progress to gather additional information concerning isolated systolic hypertension, especially in the aged. Inasmuch as at least one half or more of stroke deaths in blacks develop as the result of hypertension, lowering blood pressure offers the perfect opportunity to reduce considerably the frequency of this devastating illness. The recent dramatic fall in U.S. stroke mortality, greatest in the black female, is a commendable achievement, but the flattening of the declining mortality curve over the past several years should be a cause for alarm and intensive investigation. 
Gastrointestinal lipomas: a radiologic and pathologic review. Lipomas of the gastrointestinal tract are an infrequent finding on radiologic examination; however, they occur often enough to warrant consideration in the differential diagnosis of mass lesions of the gut. In many instances, their morphologic characteristics allow the specific diagnosis of a lipoma. In this report, we review gastrointestinal lipomas with an emphasis on their radiologic and pathologic correlation. 
Spectrum of orthostatic disorders: classification based on an analysis of the short-term circulatory response upon standing. 1. In 31 consecutively referred patients (20 females, 11 males) with overt or suspected orthostatic disorders, the changes in blood pressure and heart rate that occur in the first 2 min of standing were analysed. 2. Blood pressure was measured continuously by Finapres. The blood pressure and heart rate responses after 1-2 min of standing (early steady-state response) were used to classify the patients as follows: group I (n = 17, age 42 +/- 17 years), normal early steady-state blood pressure and heart rate responses; group II (n = 5, age 40 +/- 14 years), combination of normal early steady-state blood pressure and postural tachycardia; group III (n = 9, age 51 +/- 14 years), hypotensive orthostatic response with (4/9) or without (5/9) postural tachycardia. We examined whether additional information could be obtained by beat-to-beat analysis of the initial circulatory response (first 30 s). It was quantified by identifying the blood pressure trough and overshoot and the maximum heart rate and relative bradycardia. 3. The initial drop in systolic and diastolic blood pressures did not differ between the three groups. A recovery of blood pressure with a systolic and/or diastolic blood pressure overshoot was present in all group I and II patients, but was absent in all except two patients in group III. The initial maximum heart rate increase did not differ between the three groups. The relative bradycardia was less in groups II and III than in group I. 4. We conclude that analysis of the beat-to-beat blood pressure changes in the first 30 s after the onset of standing provides almost all the information that is necessary to determine abnormalities in orthostatic circulatory control. 
Does atrial appendectomy aggravate secretory function of atrial natriuretic polypeptide? The present study was designed to clarify how atrial appendectomy affects hemodynamics and secretory function of atrial natriuretic polypeptide in the failing heart. Eleven mongrel dogs were prepared for the experimental model of high-output heart failure by creation of arteriovenous fistulas between femoral arteries and veins. Two months after the first operation, effects of bilateral atrial appendectomies on basal and pacing-induced secretions of atrial natriuretic polypeptide were investigated in five dogs with simultaneous measurement of various hemodynamic indices. In the remaining six dogs, used as a control group, pacing-induced secretion of atrial natriuretic polypeptide was examined in the same way as in the appendectomy group. After excision of the atrial appendages, neither systolic blood pressure nor either atrial pressure changed, but plasma atrial natriuretic polypeptide level was decreased (292 +/- 54 to 188 +/- 47 pg/ml, p less than 0.01) and cardiac output fell (3.7 +/- 0.9 to 3.0 +/- 0.8 L/min, p less than 0.01). During pacing-induced tachycardia, the peak level of plasma atrial natriuretic polypeptide was lower in the appendectomy group than in the control groups (593 +/- 213 versus 1170 +/- 324 pg/ml, p less than 0.05), despite similar left atrial pressures in the two groups. The excised appendages contained approximately 30% of the total amount of atrial natriuretic polypeptide. These results demonstrate that atrial appendectomy decreases secretory function of atrial natriuretic polypeptide and reduces cardiac output in dogs with experimental high-output heart failure. 
Systemic contact dermatitis from pseudoephedrine. A patient with rhinitis developed systemic contact dermatitis when starting oral treatment with Rhinalair, containing pseudoephedrine hydrochloride. A few months later, another oral treatment Rinutan, containing norephedrine hydrochloride, provoked a more severe generalized eczema. Patch test reactions were strongly positive to ephedrine and pseudoephedrine, slightly positive to phenylephrine and negative to epinephrine. Norephedrine was not tested. 
Colorectal surgery: short-term prophylaxis with clindamycin plus aztreonam or gentamicin. A randomized study was conducted to compare the effectiveness of aztreonam plus clindamycin with that of gentamicin plus clindamycin for prophylaxis of infection following colorectal surgery. A total of 138 patients undergoing elective colorectal surgery were randomized to treatment with clindamycin (600 mg) plus either aztreonam (1 g) or gentamicin (80 mg) 30 minutes before and 8 and 16 hours after surgery. The study included 122 patients (88.4%) with colorectal carcinoma. Samples from the abdominal cavity and from the subcutaneous tissues were taken for bacteriologic study. All samples from the abdominal cavity yielded microorganisms; both aerobic and anaerobic bacteria were isolated. Wound infections occurred in eight patients (12.1%) in the aztreonam group and in 12 patients (16.7%) in the gentamicin group. Escherichia coli, Bacteroides species, enterococci, and staphylococci were isolated most frequently from wounds and were often isolated from bacteriologic samples from the abdominal cavity of the same patients. The incidence of septic complications reflected the extent of nutritional and immunologic impairment. No significant differences were found between groups in the rate of urinary tract or lower respiratory tract infections. Aztreonam/clindamycin appears to be a valid alternative to gentamicin/clindamycin for the prophylaxis of infections following colorectal surgery. 
Incidence and management of airway problems in the CHARGE Association. The airway problems associated with anaesthesia in patients with the CHARGE Association have been underreported. We undertook a retrospective review of 50 cases, of which anaesthetic records were available for 37 patients. Apart from choanal atresia and cleft lip and palate, 56% of patients has some other upper airway abnormality. There appeared to be greater difficulty in tracheal intubation with increase in age in four patients. The incidence and management of airway abnormalities are discussed. 
Report of a hidden case of overfeeding. Nutritional support is essential to the care of the critically ill patient, but complications of overfeeding can occur. Precise metabolic measurement by indirect calorimetry can detect problems of nutrition and allow adjustment in caloric intake. This case study illustrates the complications of carbon dioxide retention and inability to wean from mechanical ventilation with subsequent prevention of further complications. 
Failure of trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole therapy in experimental enterococcal endocarditis. To assess the potential efficacy of trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX) against serious enterococcal infections, we used a rat enterococcal endocarditis model comparing TMP-SMX therapy (500 mg of TMP plus 2,500 mg of SMX per kg of body weight per day given every 8 h by intragastric gavage) with intravenous ampicillin therapy (1,000 mg/kg per day). Despite concentrations of active drug in serum well in excess of the MIC and MBC, the mean residual vegetation bacterial titer in TMP-SMX-treated rats was similar to that in untreated controls (8.4 +/- 1.1 versus 8.6 +/- 1.3 log10 CFU/g) and significantly higher than that in the ampicillin-treated group (3.6 +/- 1.5 log10 CFU/g; P less than or equal to 0.001). This demonstrates discordance between in vitro activity and in vivo efficacy of TMP-SMX in serious enterococcal infection. 
Identification of a germ-line mutation in the p53 gene in a patient with an intracranial ependymoma. We detected a germ-line mutation of the p53 gene in a patient with a malignant ependymoma of the posterior fossa. This mutation, which was found at codon 242, resulted in an amino acid substitution in a highly conserved site of exon 7 of the p53 gene; the same mutation was found in both the germ-line and the tumor tissue. This is the most common region of previously described somatic p53 mutations in tumor specimens and of the germ-line p53 mutations in patients with the Li-Fraumeni cancer syndrome. Evaluation of the patient's family revealed several direct maternal and paternal relatives who had died at a young age from different types of cancer. The association of a germ-line p53 mutation with an intracranial malignancy and a strong family history of cancer suggests that p53 gene mutations predispose a person to malignancy and, like retinoblastoma mutations, may be inherited. 
Late potentials on signal-averaged electrocardiograms and patency of the infarct-related artery in survivors of acute myocardial infarction. This study evaluated the relation between patency of the infarct-related artery and the presence of late potentials on the signal-averaged electrocardiogram (ECG) in 124 consecutive patients (98 men, 26 women; mean age 59 years) with acute myocardial infarction receiving thrombolytic therapy, acute percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty or standard care. All patients were studied by coronary angiography, measurement of ejection fraction and signal-averaged ECG. The infarct-related artery was closed in 51 patients and open in 73. Among patients with no prior myocardial infarction undergoing early attempted reperfusion therapy, a patent artery was associated with a decreased incidence of late potentials (20% versus 71%; no significant difference in ejection fraction). In the 48 patients receiving thrombolytic agents within 4 h of symptom onset, the incidence of late potentials was 24% and 83% among patients with an open or closed artery, respectively (p less than 0.04). The most powerful predictors of late potentials were the presence of a closed infarct-related artery, followed by prior infarction and patient age. Among patients receiving thrombolytic agents within 4 h of symptom onset, the only variable that was predictive of the presence of late potentials was a closed infarct-related artery. These data imply that reperfusion of an infarct-related artery has a beneficial effect on the electrophysiologic substrate for serious ventricular arrhythmias that is independent of change in left ventricular ejection fraction as an index of infarct size. These findings might explain, in part, the low late mortality rate in survivors of myocardial infarction with documented reperfusion of the infarct-related artery. 
Serum inhibin levels in polycystic ovary syndrome: effect of insulin resistance and insulin secretion. Insulin resistance is common in women with the polycystic ovary syndrome. We investigated the relationship between insulin resistance and the serum inhibin concentration in a group of 19 women with polycystic ovary syndrome and eight control subjects at different phases of the menstrual cycle. Insulin resistance was measured by the frequently sampled intravenous glucose tolerance test, and inhibin was measured by a specific radioimmunoassay. Insulin sensitivity (mean +/- SE) was significantly reduced in the polycystic ovary syndrome group compared with controls: reduced insulin sensitivity 46.7 +/- 5.0 min-1/(nmol/mL), normally insulin-sensitive 106.6 +/- 11.7 min-1/(nmol/mL) (P less than .01). The women with polycystic ovary syndrome had inhibin levels (126 +/- 15.2 microLEq/mL) comparable to those found during the early follicular phase of the control group (117 +/- 22.1 microLEq/mL), but significantly lower than late follicular phase (259 +/- 25.6 microLEq/mL) or luteal phase (448 +/- 91.8 microLEq/mL) levels in the control group. No association was found between the degree of insulin resistance and the inhibin concentration, which remained unaltered over a 3-hour period despite maximal stimulation of endogenous insulin secretion. The inhibin concentrations in polycystic ovary syndrome may reflect impaired follicular maturation. Inhibin secretion is not acutely affected by insulin secretion in normal or in hyperandrogenic women. 
Absence of human papilloma virus in cervical adenocarcinoma determined by in situ hybridisation. A few studies using DNA technology have suggested that human papillomavirus (HPV) may be an aetiological factor for adenocarcinoma of the uterine cervix. Twenty one cases of cervical adenocarcinoma were studied by in situ hybridisation using biotinylated DNA probes for HPV types 6, 11, 16 and 18 and a streptavidin, biotinylated alkaline phosphatase detection system. Intranuclear HPV DNA was detected in none of the adenocarcinomas, while positive controls gave a clear intranuclear signal. Adjacent areas of normal, koilocytic, and dysplastic squamous epithelium also gave positive results. It may be that squamous epithelium contaminates adenocarcinomas reported as positive by Southern blotting. Our results showing absence of detectable HPV DNA within adenocarcinomas suggest that HPV infection may not have a major role in the aetiology of adenocarcinoma of the uterine cervix. 
Treatment with pulsatile luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone modulates folliculogenesis in response to ovarian stimulation with exogenous gonadotropins in patients with polycystic ovaries. Combined treatment with pulsatile LH-RH and hMG, given to eight patients who had anovulation associated with PCO and resistant to CC, significantly reduced the number of large follicles induced by hMG alone. A direct effect of pulsatile LH-RH on the ovary is postulated. This combined treatment eased the problems of multifollicular development, thereby increasing efficiency and reducing complications in patients with PCO stimulated by gonadotropins. 
First clinical study of the selective 5-HT3 antagonist, granisetron (BRL 43694), in the acute treatment of migraine headache. Granisetron (BRL 43694), a selective 5-HT3 receptor antagonist, was assessed as acute therapy for the first time in migraine patients. In an open pilot study 7 migraine attacks were treated in 6 patients. All but 1 patient experienced marked and rapid relief from the headache, and nausea and vomiting were rapidly resolved in the 6 cases where these symptoms accompanied the attack. No side effects were recorded. Development of granisetron for migraine was suspended during the study for extraneous reasons. 
Expression of Tn, sialosyl Tn, and T antigens in human pancreas. Carbohydrate antigens representing some of the initial steps in mucin O-linked glycosylation were examined in specimens of normal pancreas, chronic pancreatitis, and pancreatic adenocarcinoma. Tn antigen, recognized by Vicia villosa lectin, was expressed by all specimens of normal pancreas (acinar cells) and pancreatic cancers and all but one case of chronic pancreatitis. Sialosyl Tn antigen, recognized by monoclonal antibody TKH2, was expressed in a cancer-associated fashion, being completely absent in normal pancreas but expressed by 56% of chronic pancreatitis and 97% of pancreatic cancers. T antigen, recognized by monoclonal antibody AH9-16, was expressed in 68% of normal pancreas (acinar cells), 67% of chronic pancreatitis, and 48% of pancreatic cancer tissues. These results indicate that normal acinar cells of the pancreas are capable of expressing selected carbohydrate structures associated with the initial steps of mucin glycosylation. The marked expression of sialosyl Tn compared with T antigen in pancreatic cancers suggests that with malignant transformation there is selective usage of glycosyltransferase enzymes involved in mucin oligosaccharide synthesis. 
QTc prolongation measured by standard 12-lead electrocardiography is an independent risk factor for sudden death due to cardiac arrest. BACKGROUND. QTc prolongation has been implicated as a risk factor for sudden death; however, a controversy exists over its significance. METHODS AND RESULTS. In the Rotterdam QT Project, 6,693 consecutive patients who underwent 24-hour ambulatory electrocardiography were followed up for 2 years; of these, 245 patients died suddenly. A standard 12-lead electrocardiogram and clinical data at the time of 24-hour ambulatory electrocardiography were collected for all patients who died suddenly and for a random sample of 467 patients from the study cohort. In all patients without an intraventricular conduction defect (176 patients who died suddenly and 390 patients from the sample), QT interval duration was measured in leads I, II, and III and corrected for heart rate with Bazett's formula (QTc). In patients without evidence of cardiac dysfunction (history of symptoms of pump failure or an ejection fraction less than 40%), QTc of more than 440 msec was associated with a 2.3 times higher risk for sudden death compared with a QTc of 440 msec or less (95% confidence interval: 1.4, 3.9). In contrast, in patients with evidence of cardiac dysfunction, the relative risk of QTc prolongation was 1.0 (0.5, 1.9). Adjustment for age, gender, history of myocardial infarction, heart rate, and the use of drugs did not alter these relative risks. CONCLUSIONS. These data indicate that in patients without intraventricular conduction defects and cardiac dysfunction, QTc prolongation measured from the standard electrocardiogram is a risk factor for sudden death independent of age, history of myocardial infarction, heart rate, and drug use. In patients with cardiac dysfunction, QTc duration is not related to the risk for sudden death. 
Risk of adverse events in children completing treatment for acute lymphoblastic leukemia: St. Jude Total Therapy studies VIII, IX, and X. We studied the frequency, causes, and predictors of adverse events in 624 patients who had completed treatment for acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) in three consecutive total therapy studies (VII, IX, and X, 1972 to 1983). Event-free survival in study X was significantly better overall than that in studies VIII and IX (P less than .0001 by the log-rank test). In study X, 75% of the patients were electively taken off therapy, compared with 54% in studies VIII and IX. However, the risks of having an adverse event during the first 5 years after completion of therapy were remarkably similar: 22% (95% confidence interval, 17% to 29%) in study X versus 24% (20% to 29%) in studies VIII and IX. Bone marrow, testicular, and CNS relapses accounted for the majority of failures in both groups (85% in study X and 92% in studies VIII and IX). Late adverse events consisted largely of hematologic relapses and the development of solid tumors. Black race (P = .001) and leukemia without an anterior mediastinal mass (P = .05) were associated with an increased risk of failure after completion of treatment in the two earlier clinical trials, whereas a lower leukemic cell DNA content (DNA index less than 1.16) was the only predictor of late treatment failure in the more recent trial (P = .019). None of the other presenting features that were examined (eg, age, leukocyte count, and sex) had value as predictors of late failure. Thus, improved treatment altered the impact of specific prognostic factors and the distribution of sites of relapse, but it did not significantly affect the risk of delayed failure. 
An educational device for Mohs micrographic surgery. A three-dimensional model of basal cell carcinoma. Mohs micrographic surgery for skin cancer (fresh-tissue technique) involves the processing of tissue in a complex fashion. The advantages of this method relate to the asymmetric three-dimensional growth of basal cell carcinoma (BCC). A device is described here based on published knowledge about the growth of BCC. The model demonstrates the precise way in which Mohs surgery varies from other surgical approaches to yield higher cure rates in specific circumstances. This device may be helpful in educating residents and medical students about Mohs surgery and in preparing patients for this procedure. 
Ischemic injury to the spinal cord or lumbosacral plexus after aorto-iliac reconstruction. Between January 1, 1980, and June 30, 1989, 9 patients (6 males and 3 females) developed ischemic injury to the spinal cord or lumbosacral plexus following 3,320 operations on the abdominal aorta (0.3%). The incidence of this complication was 0.1% (2 of 1,901) after elective and 1.4% (3 of 210) after emergency abdominal aortic aneurysm repair, and 0.3% (4 of 1,209) after repair for occlusive disease. Three of the latter had prior clinical evidence of distal embolization. Eight grafts were bifurcated (aorto-iliac:four, aorto-femoral: three, aorto-ilio-femoral:one). One patient underwent extra-anatomic revascularization. Only two patients had supraceliac aortic cross-clamping and one patient underwent exclusion of both internal iliac arteries. Four patients had hypotension. Early mortality was 22% (two of nine). Severe perioperative complications, mostly due to associated visceral and somatic ischemia and sepsis, were present in seven of the nine patients. The extent and type of the neurologic injury correlated with long-term outcome. Patients with ischemic injury of the lumbosacral roots or plexus had better recovery. Attention to the pelvic circulation and the collateral blood supply is important. Use of gentle technique to prevent embolization, avoidance of hypotension and prolonged supraceliac cross-clamping, revascularization of at least one internal iliac artery, and the use of heparin may decrease but not eliminate paraplegia. Once this unexpected complication occurs, careful neurologic evaluation should be done to localize the lesion and aid prognosis. 
Agrobacterium radiobacter peritonitis in two patients maintained on chronic peritoneal dialysis. We report two patients with end-stage renal disease maintained on chronic peritoneal dialysis who developed peritonitis in which the infecting organism was Agrobacterium radiobacter, normally a rare pathogen in humans. Both patients initially responded to antibiotics, but later relapsed and required catheter removal. Neither had been exposed to soil or plant material. A radiobacter is yet another of a growing list of unusual organisms that infect the peritoneal cavity of peritoneal dialysis patients. 
Modulating effects of calcium in animal models of colon carcinogenesis and short-term studies in subjects at increased risk for colon cancer. A substantive amount of evidence from animal models supports the hypothesis that dietary fat is an etiological factor in colon cancer. Although various theories account for possible mechanisms, it is clear that under the influence of a basic colonic pH, fatty acids and bile acids may become highly surfactant in the colon, causing cell loss and compensatory hyperproliferation. Calcium likely reduces lipid damage in the colon by complexing with fat to form mineral-fat complexes or soaps. It has been shown in an increasing number of animal experiments that calcium has the ability to inhibit colon cancer. In limited studies in man, the colonic hyperproliferation associated with increased risk for colon cancer has been reversed for short periods by administration of supplemental dietary calcium. Taken together the available evidence suggests that increases in the daily intake of calcium in the diet may provide a means of colorectal-cancer control. 
Cavernous malformations of the brain stem. Once they become symptomatic, cavernous malformations of the brain stem appear to cause progressive morbidity from repetitive hemorrhage, and can even be fatal. Twenty-four patients with long-tract and/or cranial nerve findings from their cavernous malformations of the brain stem were seen for initial evaluation or surgical consultation and thereafter received either surgical or continued conservative treatment. The decision to operate was based on the proximity of the cavernous malformation to the pial surface of the brain stem, the patient's neurological status, and the number of symptomatic episodes. Sixteen patients were treated by definitive surgery directed at excision of their malformation. In four patients, associated venous malformations influenced the surgical approach and their recognition avoided the risk of inappropriate excision of the venous malformation. Although some of the 16 patients had transient, immediate, postoperative worsening of their neurological deficits, the outcome of all except one was the same or improved. Only one patient developed recurrent symptoms: a new deficit 2 1/2 years after surgery required reoperation after regrowth of the cavernous malformation. She has been neurologically stable since the second surgery. One patient died 6 months postoperatively from a shunt infection and sepsis. The eight conservatively treated patients are followed with annual magnetic resonance imaging studies. One has a dramatic associated venous malformation. Seven patients have either minor intermittent or no symptoms, and the eighth died from a hemorrhage 1 year after his initial presentation. Based on these results, surgical extirpation of symptomatic cavernous malformations of the brain stem appears to be the treatment of choice when a patient is symptomatic, the lesion is located superficially, and an operative approach can spare eloquent tissue. When cavernous malformations of the brain stem are completely excised, cure appears permanent. 
A t(4;22) in a meningioma points to the localization of a putative tumor-suppressor gene. Cytogenetic analysis of meningioma cells from one particular patient (MN32) displayed the stem-line karyo-type 45, XY, -1, 4p+, 22q-, 22q+, which thus had rearrangements of both chromosomes 22. The 22q+ marker appeared as a dicentric: 22 pter----q11::1p11----qter. The reciprocal product of this translocation has presumably been lost because it lacked a centromere. The 22q- chromosome also appeared to have lost sequences distal to band q11. We assumed that this marker could have been the result of a reciprocal translocation between chromosomes 4 and 22. To investigate the 4p+ and 22q- chromosomes in more detail, human-hamster somatic cell hybrids were constructed that segregated the 22q- and 4p+ chromosomes. Southern blot analysis with DNA from these hybrids showed that sequences from 22q were indeed translocated to 4p+ and that reciprocally sequences from 4p were translocated to 22q-, demonstrating a balanced t(4;22)(p16;q11). On the basis of these results we presume that in this tumor a tumor-suppressor gene is deleted in the case of the 22q+ marker and that the t(4;22) disrupts the second allele of this gene. The latter translocation was mapped between D22S1 and D22S15, a distance of 1 cM on the linkage map of this chromosome. The area in which we have located the translocation is within the region where the gene predisposing to neurofibromatosis 2 has been mapped. 
The rapid and reversible activation of a calcium-independent plasmalogen-selective phospholipase A2 during myocardial ischemia. Recent studies have demonstrated the existence of two members of a novel family of calcium-independent plasmalogen-selective phospholipases A2 in mammalian myocardium (Wolf, R. A., and R. W. Gross. 1985. J. Biol. Chem. 260:7295-7303; and Hazen, S. L., D. A. Ford, and R. W. Gross. 1991. J. Biol. Chem. 266:5629-5633). To examine the potential role of these calcium-independent phospholipases A2 in mediating membrane dysfunction during early myocardial ischemia, the temporal course of alterations in phospholipase A2 activity during global ischemia in Langendorf perfused rabbit hearts was quantified and compared with traditionally accepted markers of myocytic ischemic injury and anaerobic metabolism. We now report that membrane-associated calcium-independent plasmalogen-selective phospholipase A2 activity increased over 400% during 2 min of global ischemia (P less than 0.01), was near maximally activated (greater than 10-fold) after only 5 min of ischemia, and remained activated throughout the entire ischemic interval examined (2-60 min). Activation of membrane-associated plasmalogen-selective phospholipase A2 after 5 min of myocardial ischemia was rapidly reversible during reperfusion of ischemic tissue. Both the activation of phospholipase A2 and its reversibility during reperfusion were temporally correlated to alterations in myocytic anaerobic metabolism. Furthermore, activation of membrane-associated phospholipase A2 was essentially complete before electron microscopic evidence of cellular damage. Collectively, these results identify dynamic alterations in calcium-independent plasmalogen-selective phospholipase A2 activity during myocardial ischemia which precede irreversible cellular injury and demonstrate that activation of plasmalogen-selective phospholipase A2 is amongst the earliest biochemical alterations in ischemic myocardium. 
Reproducibility of quantitative planar thallium-201 scintigraphy: quantitative criteria for reversibility of myocardial perfusion defects. Fifty-two paired stress/delayed planar 201TI studies (27 exercise studies, 25 dipyridamole studies) were processed twice by seven technologists to assess inter- and intraobserver variability. The reproducibility was inversely related to the size of 201TI perfusion abnormalities. Intraobserver variability was not different between exercise and dipyridamole studies for lesions of similar size. Based upon intraobserver variability, objective quantitative criteria for reversibility of perfusion abnormalities were defined. These objective criteria were tested prospectively in a separate group of 35 201TI studies and compared with the subjective interpretation of quantitative circumferential profiles. Overall, exact agreement existed in 78% of images (kappa statistic k = 0.66). We conclude that quantification of planar 201TI scans is highly reproducible, with acceptable inter- and intraobserver variability. Objective criteria for lesion reversibility correlated well with analysis by experienced observers. 
Delays in the treatment of acute myocardial infarction: an overview. Delays in treatment of acute myocardial infarction prevent a substantial portion of patients from receiving maximal benefit from reperfusion therapy. Median delay between onset of symptoms and arrival at the hospital is 2 to 4 hours. Average time between arrival at the hospital and initiation of thrombolytic therapy is 84 minutes. Approximately 50% of patients hospitalized for suspected acute myocardial infarction do not use the emergency medical service system. Delay before treatment can be divided into several components: patient delay, emergency medical service delay, and hospital delay. Factors contributing to delay in each component and possible approaches to decreasing these delays are discussed. The effects of treatment delay on prognosis and future care-seeking behavior of patients hospitalized with suspected acute myocardial infarction are also discussed. 
Na,K-ATPase in isolated nephron segments in rats with experimental heart failure. To characterize renal transport of Na+ in heart failure, urinary Na+ excretion (UNaV), aldosterone levels, and Na,K-ATPase activity in isolated nephron segments were determined in three groups: control rats, rats with heart failure and moderate sodium retention, and rats with heart failure and severe sodium retention. Heart failure was induced by a fistula between the aorta and vena cava. For the control group, UNaV was 0.66 +/- 0.04 (mean +/- SEM) mueq/min, and aldosterone was 18.4 +/- 3.5 ng%. Na,K-ATPase activity (in 10(-11) mol/mm/min) was 28.4 +/- 1.1 in the proximal convoluted tubule, 23.3 +/- 1.0 in the proximal straight tubule, 37.4 +/- 1.9 in the medullary thick ascending limb, 40.2 +/- 1.9 in the cortical thick ascending limb, 43.2 +/- 2.2 in the distal convoluted tubule, and 20.5 +/- 0.9 in the cortical collecting duct. For the group with moderate heart failure, UNaV was 0.35 +/- 0.02 (p less than 0.001 versus control), and aldosterone was 15.9 +/- 4.4 (p = NS versus control). Na,K-ATPase activity was unchanged in the proximal convoluted tubule, proximal straight tubule, medullary thick ascending limb, and cortical collecting duct, but it increased in the cortical thick ascending limb to 57.7 +/- 3.1 (p less than 0.001 versus control) and decreased in the distal convoluted tubule to 35.3 +/- 1.2 (p less than 0.005 versus control). For the group with severe heart failure, UNaV was 0.029 +/- 0.016 (p less than 0.001 versus control), and aldosterone was 186.0 +/- 14.8 (p less than 0.001 versus control). 
The prognosis of Hodgkin's disease in older adults. This investigation was undertaken to assess the apparent poor survival of older patients with Hodgkin's disease. The clinical course of Hodgkin's disease in 136 patients, 60 to 79 years of age, was compared with that of 223 patients, 40 to 59 years of age. The patients registered from November 1977 through December 1983 had not been previously treated, and were treated at eight cancer centers. When the prognosis of all patients was examined by age, a definite change in the pattern of survival first appeared in the 60- to 69-year-old cohort. The entire older group (60 to 79 years) experienced twice the risk of dying from Hodgkin's disease and four times the risk of dying from other causes than did the younger group. In both groups, stage of disease was the strongest factor in predicting adjusted survival. Delay in treatment and advanced stage at presentation were not characteristic of Hodgkin's disease in older patients as has been postulated. Older patients responded to therapy with a similar complete remission rate (84% v 88% in the younger group, P = .24). From this study, we conclude that (1) Hodgkin's disease in the older adult does not have a different natural history, its major risk factors are similar to those known in other age groups, and thus should be amenable to existing therapeutic approaches; and (2) the prognosis of older patients with Hodgkin's disease has been obscured in previous studies by the inclusion of deaths due to other causes in survival estimates. 
Somatostatin, gastrin-releasing peptide and gastrin in the stomach of rats with streptozotocin-induced diabetes and insulinoma. Somatostatin, gastrin-releasing peptide (GRP) and gastrin were measured in the stomach of rats with streptozotocin-induced diabetes, insulinoma-bearing rats and their respective controls. Rats injected with streptozotocin exhibited hyperphagia, insulinopenia and severe hyperglycemia. Stomach weights, and the concentrations and total amounts of GRP and gastrin in the stomach, were similar to nondiabetic control rats. The concentration of somatostatin in the stomach of diabetic rats was 25% greater, but the total stomach content of somatostatin was similar to that of control rats. Insulinoma-bearing rats exhibited hyperphagia, hyperinsulinemia and hypoglycemia. Concentrations of GRP and gastrin in the stomach were 72% and 19% lower, respectively, than in control rats. Despite 45% greater stomach weight, the total stomach content of GRP was 61% lower. Stomach concentrations of somatostatin, and total stomach contents of somatostatin and gastrin, were similar in insulinoma-bearing and control rats. The results demonstrate abnormalities in the stomach concentrations of regulatory peptides in rats with diabetes and insulinoma. These abnormalities are not attributable to changes in food intake alone, suggesting specific effects of these metabolic diseases on gastric regulatory peptides and gastric function. 
Periorbital hematoma secondary to sinusitis in a child. Periorbital abscess secondary to sinusitis is a well-recognized entity in children. However, subperiosteal hematoma is extremely rare and has been reported in only four adult patients. This article presents the case of a 4-year-old girl with sinusitis, proptosis, and decreased visual acuity. Surgical exploration of the orbit revealed the presence of a large organizing subperiosteal hematoma that was drained. The presence of a periorbital hematoma should be suspected in patients with acute onset of proptosis and findings of a periorbital mass and sinusitis on computed tomographic scan. 
Hypoxia-mediated in vivo release of dopamine in nucleus tractus solitarii of rabbits. A wide variety of neuroactive substances have been suggested to be involved in the respiratory depression observed in response to severe hypoxia. By use of the technique of microdialysis, the release of dopamine (DA) was measured in the nucleus tractus solitarii during severe hypoxic provocations (6% O2 in N2) in the adult pentobarbital-anesthetized rabbit. DA release was analyzed by high-performance liquid chromatography with electrochemical detection. Such hypoxic provocations caused pronounced phase of depression in the phrenic nerve activity and enhanced release of DA. After bilateral carotid sinus nerve denervation, acute severe hypoxia did not give rise to enhanced release of DA or to phrenic nerve depression. Mild hypoxic (9% or 12% O2 in N2) or hypercapnic (6% CO2) stimuli resulted in an increased phrenic nerve activity without any concomitant changes in DA release. Decerebration at the midcollicular level in rabbits prevented an enhanced release of DA in the nucleus tractus solitarii during severe hypoxia. The results suggest that 1) DA is involved in the central ventilatory response to severe hypoxia, 2) not only the initial excitatory but also the second depressive phase in response to severe hypoxia is mediated partially by the peripheral chemoreceptors, and 3) the depressive phase is dependent on intact connections from suprapontine structures. 
Gliomatosis peritonei with malignant transformation: a case report and review of the literature. Gliomatosis peritonei is the implantation of glial tissue within the peritoneal cavity associated with ovarian teratomas. Previous reports have emphasized improved outcomes when these implants are found to be mature, even if the ovarian component is immature. A 16-year-old female with grade 3 immature teratoma was found on two subsequent laparotomies to have extensive peritoneal implantation of mature glial tissue. More than 5 years after the original surgery she was found to have a malignant abdominal glial neoplasm. This case illustrates a rare finding of malignant transformation of previously mature gliomatosis peritonei. 
Glucagon-induced alteration of serum bile acid level in patients with liver cirrhosis. Percent changes in serum total bile acid level after IV administration of 1 mg glucagon were measured in 61 cirrhotics. Thirty-three of 38 cases with Child's grade A disease showed a reduction of total bile acid level at 15 minutes; this level was maintained in the majority of them until 120 minutes. A similar mode of serial changes in total bile acid level was also shown in the cases with Child's grade B disease. On the other hand, only 2 of 10 cases with Child's grade C showed a reduction of total bile acid level at 15 minutes. Reduction of total bile acid level at 15 minutes after glucagon administration was mimicked by infusion of dibutyryl cyclic adenosine monophosphate. However, in 3 of 6 cases with elevated total bile acid level at 15 minutes after glucagon administration, dibutyryl cyclic adenosine monophosphate induced a reduction of total bile acid level. Also, it was confirmed that glucagon enhances the uptake of taurocholate into freshly isolated rat hepatocytes by activating Na(+)-dependent, carrier-mediated membrane transport system and observed that its effect is associated with elevation of Vmax (0.6114 nmol.min-1 x 10(6) cells-1 without glucagon; 0.975 nmol.min-1 x 10(6) cells-1 in glucagon added) but not with affecting Km (13.58 mumol/L without glucagon; 13.71 mumol/L with glucagon) or protein synthesis which is inhibited by cycloheximide. These observations suggest that glucagon enhances Na(+)-coupled membrane transport of bile acids in the liver and causes the reduction of serum total bile acid level and that a lack of this response may be indicative of membrane dysfunction in the liver. 
Chimeric BCR-abl messenger RNA as a marker for minimal residual disease in patients transplanted for Philadelphia chromosome-positive acute lymphoblastic leukemia. We correlated polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-detectable BCR-abl fusion transcripts with cytogenetic status in 24 patients with acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL). Of 10 Philadelphia chromosome negative (Ph-) patients, only one was found to exhibit a BCR-abl fusion transcript. Fourteen patients with Ph+ ALL, including eight in clinical remission, exhibited PCR-detectable BCR-abl rearrangements. A detectable Ph chromosome was present in only five of the eight patients in clinical remission. Of the three cytogenetically negative, BCR-abl-positive patients, two eventually succumbed to post-bone marrow transplantation (BMT) relapse. The third died of early transplant complications. Serial PCR analyses were performed on four Ph+ ALL patients in clinical remission who underwent allogeneic BMT. One patient who was PCR negative on post-BMT days 21 and 75 became PCR-positive on day 116 and died in relapse on day 154. One patient was weakly positive for BCR-abl on day 23, negative on day 56, but died of transplant complications on day 124. Two patients exhibited no post-BMT BCR-abl rearrangements and remain well on days 279 and 371. Our findings suggest that PCR analysis may be useful in the early identification of relapse in patients transplanted for Ph+ ALL. 
Bilateral internal mammary artery grafts in reoperative and primary coronary bypass surgery Bilateral internal mammary artery grafting is recognized as a preferred method of myocardial revascularization. However, its efficacy in coronary bypass reoperation has not been clearly established. From January 1982 through June 1989, 88 patients underwent coronary bypass reoperation with bilateral internal mammary artery grafts. Results were compared with those for a subset of 88 patients receiving primary revascularization with bilateral internal mammary artery grafts who were computer matched for sex, age, left ventricular function, anginal classification, and left main coronary artery disease. In each group, 62.5% (55 patients) had unstable angina, 43.2% (38 patients) had reduced ejection fraction, and 21.6% (19 patients) in the reoperation group and 20.5% (18 patients) in the reference group had left main coronary artery disease. Hospital mortality for the reoperation group was 6.8% (6 patients) and for the reference group, 3.4% (3 patients). No significant difference was found in the incidence of reoperation for bleeding, sternal infection, or stroke in the two groups. The incidence of respiratory insufficiency in the reoperation group was 13.6% (12 patients) and in the reference group, 3.4% (3 patients) (p less than 0.015). Recurrent angina occurred in 13.7% (10 patients) of patients in the reoperation group and 13.3% (10 patients) in the reference group. The long-term survival at 5 years for the reoperation group was 85.3% +/- 5.6% (+/- standard error of the mean) and for the reference group, 91.6% +/- 3.1%. No significant difference was found in the equality of survival distribution for the two groups. 
Occurrence of neoplasia in patients with rheumatoid arthritis enrolled in a DMARD Registry. Rheumatoid Arthritis Azathioprine Registry Steering Committee. The Rheumatoid Arthritis Azathioprine Registry (RAAR) was established in 1982 to examine the safety of azathioprine (AZA) and other disease modifying agents (DMARD) in the treatment of RA. In yearly followup over the past 7 years, 20 malignant conditions have been reported in 530 DMARD treated adult patients with RA. Incidence density ratios (IDR) and standardized morbidity ratios (SMR) were calculated to assess cancer risk. For all cancers the SMR was 1.52 (95% CI 0.90-2.60). For men the SMR was 1.71 (95% CI 0.84-3.52); for women the SMR was 1.52 (95% CI 0.89-2.60). Adjusted for age, the IDR was highest in the 70-79-year-old study population (3.41). The age and sex adjusted SMR for lymphoproliferative disorders and myeloma was 8.05 (95% CI 3.30-20.81). The SMR for lung cancer (n = 6) was also increased (3.37; 95% CI 1.58-7.34). Compared with the general population, patients with RA requiring DMARD therapy may be at increased risk of malignancy, particularly lymphoproliferative disorders. The RAAR is an important prospective technique which will ultimately permit assessment of neoplasia risk by type and duration of DMARD therapy. 
Adenosine in myocardial perfusion imaging using positron emission tomography. Because of its unique ability to demonstrate the metabolic consequences of myocardial ischemia, positron emission tomography (PET) is extremely valuable in assessing myocardial viability. PET imaging can identify the myocardial segments that are likely to improve after revascularization and may be more sensitive and specific for the detection of coronary artery disease compared with thallium perfusion imaging. Adenosine has several advantages over dipyridamole as a pharmacologic stress agent for use with PET. It produces maximal vasodilation in a significantly greater percentage of patients, is a more potent coronary vasodilator, and its very short half-life may be ideal for use with the very short half-life radioactive tracers used in PET. When combined with metabolic studies, adenosine may be useful for the assessment of patients who received thrombolytic therapy for an acute myocardial infarction. 
Colovesical fistula secondary to vesical gangrene in a diabetic patient. We present a case of colovesical fistula secondary to vesical gangrene. Precipitating factors were diabetes and vesical distension caused by the obstruction of an indwelling catheter. This complication is an exceptional outcome in gangrenous cystitis and it requires emergency surgical treatment. 
Beneficial effect of the atrial natriuretic factor analog A68828 in postischemic acute renal failure. Short-term administration of atrial peptides has been reported to improve renal function in several animal models of acute renal failure. We designed experiments that determined the effect of a 13-amino acid analog of atrial natriuretic factor (ANF), A68828, on renal function in the postischemic model of acute renal failure. Experiments were conducted using euvolemic, male Sprague-Dawley rats (200-250 g) under Inactin anesthesia. Acute renal failure was induced by complete occlusion of both renal arteries for 30 min. After release of the clamp, vehicle (0.1% bovine serum albumin in saline), A68828 (3, 10 or 30 micrograms/kg/min), dopamine (10 micrograms/kg/min), A68828 (10 micrograms/kg/min) plus dopamine (10 micrograms/kg/min) or ANF (1-28) (0.5 micrograms/kg/min) were infused i.v. for a 2-h period. A68828 at 10 micrograms/kg/min produced a significant increase in glomerular filtration rate (GFR) compared with vehicle controls (0.39 +/- 0.08 vs. 0.19 +/- 0.04 ml/min/100 g; P less than .05) despite a lower arterial pressure (87 +/- 5 vs. 101 +/- 5 mm Hg; P less than .05). A subpressor dose of dopamine had no effect on GFR during the postischemic period (0.25 +/- 0.11 ml/min/100 g). Dopamine in combination with A68828 prevented the decrease in arterial pressure seen with A68828 alone but did not potentiate the beneficial effects on GFR (0.28 +/- 0.05 ml/min/100 g). ANF (1-28) at 0.5 micrograms/kg/min increased GFR to levels nearly identical to those induced by A68828 (0.40 +/- 0.04 ml/min/100 g). These results indicate that infusion of a reduced-size analog of ANF improves renal function in the immediate postischemic period. Furthermore, prevention of the hypotensive effects of the analog with dopamine provides no additional beneficial effect. 
Clear cell cribriform hyperplasia of the prostate. Immunohistochemical and DNA flow cytometric study. Clear cell cribriform hyperplasia (CCCH) of the prostate is an unusual form of benign prostatic hyperplasia characterized by a nodular proliferation of clear cells with small, uniform nuclei. The authors studied 15 cases of CCCH by immunohistochemistry and 13 of them by DNA flow cytometry to establish the immunohistochemical and DNA profile of this lesion. Patients ranged in age from 58 to 88 years (mean, 68 years). Follow-up of a mean of 22 months showed all patients alive with no evidence of malignant prostatic disease. All 13 CCCHs showed diploid DNA content; in contrast, among 4 papillary/cribriform carcinomas of the prostate used for comparison, 3 were aneuploid and 1 was diploid. A basal cell layer was demonstrated in all 15 CCCHs by the use of the 34 beta E12 anti-high-molecular-weight keratin antibody (EAB-903) that reacts with the basal cells but not with the acinar cells of the prostate. A continuous basal cell layer was not evident in the carcinomas. The blandness of the epithelium, the well-defined nodular configuration, the presence of a basal cell layer demonstrable by immunocytochemistry, and the lack of aneuploidy as determined by DNA flow cytometry together lend support to the concept that CCCH is a benign lesion. 
Cramp-fasciculation syndrome: a treatable hyperexcitable peripheral nerve disorder. We report nine patients with muscle aching, cramps, stiffness, exercise intolerance, and peripheral nerve hyperexcitability. Neurologic examination showed calf fasciculations in seven, quadriceps myokymia in two, and deltoid myokymia in one patient. Two patients had mild increase in serum creatine kinase. Muscle biopsy showed either no abnormality (three patients) or mild neurogenic changes (four patients). Fasciculations were the only abnormality on routine electrodiagnostic studies. Supramaximal stimulation of the median, ulnar, peroneal, and posterior tibial nerves at frequencies of 0.5, 1, 2, and 5 Hz produced showers of electrical potentials following the M response in at least one nerve. In three patients, the fasciculations and evoked electrical potentials were abolished by regional application of curare but not nerve block. Carbamazepine therapy caused moderate-to-marked reduction of symptoms and nerve hyperexcitability. We designate this hyperexcitable peripheral nerve disorder as the "cramp-fasciculation syndrome.". 
Acid peptic disease in adolescents. How to avoid misdiagnosis and undertreatment. Acid peptic disease in adolescents may be more common than previously recognized. However, appropriate medical attention is often delayed because of misdiagnosis and undertreatment. Thorough questioning of adolescent patients is important to elicit a complete description of symptoms. Endoscopy or intraluminal pH monitoring may be necessary to establish a diagnosis of gastroesophageal reflux disease or peptic ulcer. Therapy with histamine receptor antagonists, especially ranitidine (Zantac), is recommended. Antireflux surgery may be needed to prevent potential long-term gastrointestinal damage. Patients with duodenal ulcer should also be advised to make life-style changes to avoid recurrence of disease later in life. 
Regimen compliance two years after myocardial infarction. Two-years postinfarction, the effect of a nursing intervention at 30 days postinfarction, and intentions, attitudes, and perceived beliefs of others on regimen compliance of myocardial infarction patients was investigated. The sample was comprised of 51 patients (E = 29, C = 22) who participated in a five-phase study over 2 years. No differences were found between experimental and control groups for regimen compliance to activity, stress, and medication prescriptions. The experimental group was significantly more compliant to the diet prescription than the control group. The control group was significantly more compliant than the experimental group with cessation from smoking. Perceived beliefs of others were predictive of compliance for all regimen prescriptions at 2 years. Attitude was also predictive of compliance with the diet, smoking, and stress regimens. 
Allergic reactions to long-term benzathine penicillin prophylaxis for rheumatic fever. International Rheumatic Fever Study Group. 1790 patients from 11 countries were enrolled in a prospective international study to determine the incidence of allergic reactions to monthly intramuscular benzathine penicillin (penicillin G benzathine) injections to prevent recurrences of rheumatic fever. After 32,430 injections during 2736 patient years of observation, 57 of the 1790 patients (3.2%) had an allergic reaction. 4 had anaphylaxis, an incidence of 0.2% (1.2/10,000 injections), all in patients over 12 years of age, and 1 patient died, a fatality incidence of 0.05% (0.31/10,000 injections). These rates are similar to those described for patients without rheumatic fever who receive short-term treatment with parenteral penicillin. Rheumatic fever recurred in 8 of 1790 patients (0.45%) who received benzathine penicillin prophylaxis compared with 11 of 96 (11.5%) who did not comply with treatment. Life-threatening allergic reactions are rare in patients on long-term parenteral benzathine penicillin to prevent recurrences of rheumatic fever; the long-term benefits of such prophylaxis by far outweigh the risk of a serious allergic reaction. 
Blood flow reactivity to hypercapnia in strictly unilateral carotid disease: preliminary results. To show relationship between degree of carotid arterial stenosis and cerebral blood flow reactivity (RES%) to induced hypercapnia, fluorine-18-fluoromethane and positron emission tomography (PET) was used to study 18 patients with carotid distribution transient ischaemic attacks (TIA), all free of stroke, who had angiographic-proven unilateral arterial disease. Non-involved carotid arteries were either normal or had non-stenotic plaque. Either normal arteries or nonstenotic ulcerations in the symptomatic carotid arteries were present in five of 18 (28%), ipsilateral carotid stenosis from 50-99% was present in eight of 18 (44%), and ipsilateral internal carotid occlusion was present in five of 18 (28%) patients. In comparison with 14 normal controls, all patients with symptomatic middle cerebral artery (MCA) flow territories had significantly lower mean (SEM) RES% [5.0' (0.2) vs 4.0 (0.9), p less than 0.04]. Symptomatic anterior borderzone (ABZ) RES% was also significantly lower [4.6 (0.4) vs 3.3 (0.9), p less than 0.04], than controls. In patient subgroup comparisons, the 50-99% stenosis subgroup clearly had the lowest MCA RES% [3.4 (0.2)] as well as the lowest ABZ RES% [2.8 (0.4)] on their symptomatic sides. Age, expired pCO2, mean arterial blood pressure, serum glucose, serum haematocrit and number, type and estimated duration of TIAs were not significantly different between subgroups. Linear regression showed a significant relationship between RES% and both measured percentage-stenosis (p = 0.04) and residual luminal diameter (p = 0.05) in symptomatic MCA territories. This approached significance in symptomatic ABZ regions. This preliminary data set suggests that unilateral carotid stenosis can and does result in impaired CO2 reactivity following hypercapnia. 
Protein kinase C is involved in PTH-induced homologous desensitization by directly affecting PTH receptor in the osteoblastic osteosarcoma cells. We have investigated mechanisms of PTH-induced homologous desensitization reflected in the refractoriness of cAMP response to the second exposure to PTH in the clonal rat osteosarcoma cell line, UMR-106. Preincubation with 10(-7) M rat (r) PTH-(1-34) for 6 h caused the desensitization, resulting in a 65% decrease in cAMP accumulation in response to further exposure to rPTH. This desensitization was apparent at 10(-10) M rPTH and maximal at 10(-7) M rPTH. UMR-106 cells treated with protein kinase C (PK-C) activating phorbol ester, phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA, 10(-6) M) for 6 h also induced desensitization manifested by a loss of rPTH-stimulated cAMP accumulation to 50% of that in the control cells. On the other hand, 4 alpha-phorbol 12,13-didecanoate, incapable of activating PK-C, failed to induce desensitization. Fifty micromolar H-7 (PK-C inhibitor) significantly blocked both rPTH- and PMA-induced desensitization. Thus, PK-C seemed to play a major role in rPTH-induced desensitization. Pretreatment with neither rPTH nor PMA changed the cAMP responsiveness to 10 micrograms/ml cholera toxin or 100 microM forskolin. Islet activating protein failed to influence the desensitization in this cell line. PTH receptor binding, assessed by using 125I-labeled [Nle8,Nle18,Tyr34]PTH-(1-34) as a radioligand, was decreased along with PTH receptor numbers by pretreatment with rPTH or PMA. These data indicate that rPTH-induced homologous desensitization occurs at least in part through the activation of PK-C and that PK-C directly affects PTH receptor in UMR-106 cells. 
The benefit of the Hemonetics cell saver apparatus during cardiac surgery. This retrospective chart review of 155 patients having coronary artery bypass graft surgery (CABG) over a two-month period determined whether the use of a cell saver apparatus (CSA) (1) reduced or increased the requirements for homologous blood; (2) increased the incidence of post-surgical bleeding; (3) was cost-effective. Two groups of patients were identified. Group 1 (n = 99) received both CSA processed red blood cells and homologous blood components. Requirement for homologous blood products was reduced in the first 24 hr after surgery (0.5 +/- 1.0 vs 1.3 +/- 1.8 units; P less than 0.05) when compared with Group 2 (n = 56) in whom only homologous blood products were utilized. More patients in Group 1 had no transfusion requirements (45 vs 8; P less than 0.05) and there was no increased risk of major haemorrhage. When the capital costs are included, utilization of the CSA was not cost-effective. We conclude that utilisation of a CSA was safe, with no increased risk of bleeding, reduced requirements for homologous blood transfusions, but added to the cost of the procedure. 
Abnormal responses to orthostatic testing in children and adolescents with recurrent unexplained syncope. Syncope in the pediatric age group is a frequent event. Most often the cause is readily apparent--i.e., orthostatic hypotension or a vasovagal event. However, there are a large number of children with frequent recurrent unexplained syncope. Neither history, physical examination, nor standard testing reveals a cause. One hundred four consecutive patients were evaluated by orthostatic testing after standard methods found no cause for the recurrent syncope. Forty-seven (44%) of these 104 patients had syncope produced by orthostatic testing. Twenty-six of the 47 (55%) became syncopal within 5 minutes of testing initiation and 21 of the 47 (45%) after 5 to 11 minutes of testing. These patients had an average decrease of 81.5 mm Hg in blood pressure and a 25 beat/min decrease in heart rate. Of 12 control subjects, none lost consciousness with standing times as long as 14 minutes. Pacing was ineffective in preventing syncope, as two patients with a previously implanted normally functioning pacemaker had recurrent syncope clinically. Syncope was also induced by orthostatic testing, with the pacemaker showing a normal response with pacing as the patient became bradycardic. The syncopal event produced by orthostatic testing occurred with a downward blood pressure trend and a narrowing of the pulse pressure without a significant increase in heart rate. This was followed by a sudden drop in blood pressure and then by bradycardia. There is a group of children and adolescents with recurrent unexplained syncope due to abnormal orthostatic control mechanisms. Orthostatic testing appears helpful in identifying these patients. 
Lumbar epidural diamorphine following thoracic surgery. A comparison of infusion and bolus administration. Twenty-two patients received a single dose of diamorphine 5 mg through a lumbar epidural catheter before thoracic surgery. The patients were transferred after surgery to a high dependency unit where they were allocated randomly to receive either an infusion of epidural diamorphine at a rate of 1 mg/hour (group 1) or bolus doses of epidural diamorphine 5 mg on demand (group 2). There was no statistically significant difference between the groups in visual analogue pain scores in the first 18 postoperative hours. Arterial carbon dioxide tension was elevated in both groups and was consistently higher in group 1 than in group 2, with a statistically significant intergroup difference 12 hours after operation. Respiratory rate was not a useful index of respiratory depression. The commonest nonrespiratory side effect was urinary retention, but the incidences of this and other minor side effects were similar in the two groups. 
Carcinoma of the prostate: MR images obtained with body coils do not accurately reflect tumor volume. MR imaging with a body coil is unreliable in directly demonstrating tumor spread through the prostatic capsule. However, the likelihood of extracapsular spread of prostatic cancer rises with increasing tumor volume. The aim of our study was to assess the accuracy of MR with a body coil in diagnosing capsular penetration indirectly via an estimation of prostatic tumor volumes. Twenty-six patients with proved prostatic cancer that was clinically confined to the gland underwent MR imaging before radical prostatectomy and whole-mount pathologic sectioning of the specimen. Twenty of 31 lesions prospectively outlined on the MR images corresponded to cancers outlined on the pathology slides, and tumor volumes were calculated by using a voxel summation technique. On MR, tumor volume was underestimated in 11 of 20 cases and overestimated in nine of 20 cases. Only two of 20 size estimates based on MR findings were within 10% of actual tumor volume. Overlap in MR tumor volumes was significant between lesions with and without capsular penetration at microscopy. Factors contributing to inaccuracies in measurements of tumor volume on MR images included the variable histologic make-up of the tumors. Our results show that, although knowledge of the size of a prostatic lesion is important in predicting the behavior of the tumor, MR imaging with a body coil is not reliable for accurate estimation of tumor volume. 
Purification of parathyroid hypertensive factor from plasma of spontaneously hypertensive rats. Parathyroid hypertensive factor (PHF) is a newly described hypertensive factor that may be related to elevation of blood pressure in 30-40% of North American essential hypertensive patients. PHF is also found in several animal models of hypertension, including spontaneously hypertensive rats, and deoxycorticosterone acetate salt hypertensive rats. Plasma collected from spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) was used in the present study for purification of PHF. Plasma was dialyzed at a molecular mass cutoff of 1 kDa, and then ultrafiltered at a molecular mass cutoff of 5 kDa. PHF activity, as determined by bioassay (characteristic delayed hypertensive response in normotensive rat) was retained in the fraction that was greater than 1 kDa and less than 5 kDa. Dialyzed and ultrafiltered SHR plasma was fractionated by molecular-exclusion chromatography, either with Bio-Gel P-6 liquid chromatography, or TSK 2000 SW HPLC. The biological activity was detected in a discrete region corresponding to a molecular mass of 2.5-3 kDa. When the molecular-exclusion fraction was subsequently fractionated by reverse-phase HPLC, biological activity was located in a single discrete peak, which did not occur in plasma from normotensive rats prepared in a similar manner. The biologically active fraction of PHF was inactivated by trypsin; this and its UV spectrum indicate the presence of a peptide structure. 
Nasal schwannoma. A 36-year-old man with a nasal septal mass is presented. The diagnosis of a benign neoplasm arising from peripheral nerve Schwann cells was made by excisional biopsy. A benign nerve sheath tumor may be either a schwannoma or neurofibroma. Schwannomas may be distinguished from neurofibroma by clinical and histologic criteria. Malignant degeneration and intracranial extension may complicate the course of a nasal schwannoma. Complete excision is the preferred therapy. 
Essential fatty acid deficiency associated with the use of a medium-chain-triglyceride infant formula in pediatric hepatobiliary disease. Serum phospholipid fatty acid patterns were determined by gas chromatography in four infants with hepatobiliary disease receiving a formula with a high content of medium-chain-triglyceride (MCT) oil. All four infants demonstrated signs of essential fatty acid deficiency, characterized by decreased arachidonic acid and increased palmitoleic and oleic acids. All had substantial concentrations of the pathologic triene 5,8,11-eicosatrienoic acid. Three of four had decreased linoleic acid concentrations and abnormal ratios of triene to tetraene (5,8,11-eicosatrienoic acid: arachidonic acid), greater than 0.38. One patient may have experienced growth failure due to abnormal essential fatty acid status. Infants with the potential for fat malabsorption should only receive MCT-oil feedings with well above the generally recommended requirements for linoleic acid (3% of total caloric intake). 
Postoperative infusional continuous regional analgesia. A technique for relief of postoperative pain following major extremity surgery. A new technique using postoperative infusional continuous regional analgesia (PICRA) for postoperative pain relief was investigated in 23 surgical patients treated by amputation (12 patients) or by limb-salvage resection operations (11 patients). Bupivacaine was delivered into peripheral nerve sheaths via catheters placed therein at the time of surgery. Only patients in whom the nerves were easily accessible were treated. Catheters were placed in the axillary sheath, the lumbosacral trunk, and the femoral nerve sheaths of patients treated with shoulder girdle and pelvic procedures (resections and amputations), and within the sciatic nerve sheath of those treated with lower extremity procedures. The anesthetic agent was delivered at controllable rates. Regional analgesia was obtained in the operative site with minimal motor or sensory decrease. To assess the efficacy of this technique, the results of this study group were compared with those of a matched group of 11 patients treated with similar surgical procedures but who received epidural morphine. Eleven of the 23 patients on PICRA required no supplemental narcotic agents. The mean level of the narcotic agents required by the remaining 13 PICRA patients was approximately one third of that required by the matched group of 11 patients receiving epidural morphine. Overall, the patients on PICRA had an 80% reduction of narcotic requirements when compared to the historical controls. The technique is reliable and can be performed by the surgeon, requiring about a ten-minute increase in operating time. It has potentially wide application in orthopedics in procedures in which the major nerves are easily accessible (e.g., pelvic fractures and revision hip surgery) and for patients with intractable pain of the extremities. 
Extracellular binding sites of IgA anti-jejunal antibodies on normal small bowel detected by indirect immunoelectronmicroscopy. Patients with dermatitis herpetiformis (DH) have IgA deposition in the papillary dermis and in the lamina propria of the small bowel. In addition, most of DH patients' sera contain IgA class anti-reticulin antibodies, anti-endomysium antibodies (EMA), and anti-jejunal antibodies (JAB) during times of gluten intake. In previous studies, JAB and EMA seemed to be identical and related to the group of anti-reticulin antibodies. In the present study, pre-embedding en bloc immunoelectronmicroscopic methods were applied for analysis of the ultrastructural binding sites of JAB on monkey and rabbit small bowels. These substrates were incubated with sera from DH patients strongly positive for JAB. Simultaneous investigations with the PAP technique and with 5 nm gold-labeled protein A or second antibodies visualized the bound IgA identically: it was associated with collagen fibrils underlying the epithelial and cryptal basement membranes and with collagen fibrils around capillaries. Staining was also detected along the endomysial collagen fibrils of smooth muscle layers, around elastica and smooth muscle cells of blood vessel walls, and along collagen fibrils near smooth muscle cells in the lamina propria. Neither the peroxidase product nor gold deposition was detected directly on the fibers, but was associated with amorphous material surrounding collagen fibers of different diameters. The distribution of JAB-stained structures corresponded to the localization of reticulin network of the small bowel. Our data indicate that JAB recognize an antigen or antigens associated with an amorphous component of the reticulin-collagen structure of jejunum and may have identical binding sites, as anti-reticulin antibodies and EMA. 
Amenorrhoea in women with non-alcoholic chronic liver disease. Amenorrhoea is common in women with non-alcoholic chronic liver disease, but little is known about its causes or consequences. We investigated 12 young women with non-alcoholic chronic liver disease and amenorrhoea and compared them with 11 healthy age matched controls studied in the follicular phase of the menstrual cycle. None of the patients had raised serum concentrations of follicle stimulating hormone suggesting primary gonadal failure, but the variance in serum concentrations of testosterone, oestradiol, prolactin, and luteinising hormone were significantly greater in chronic liver disease patients than control subjects (p less than 0.01). Seven of the 12 chronic liver disease patients had low serum luteinising hormone concentrations, and compared with controls these patients also had significantly reduced median values of oestradiol (64 pmol/l), testosterone (1.1 nmol/l), and follicle stimulating hormone, and were significantly underweight as assessed by skinfold thickness measurements (all comparisons p less than 0.025). In the group with chronic liver disease skinfold thickness was significantly correlated with serum luteinising hormone (p less than 0.02). The five patients with normal serum luteinising hormone had higher median values of both oestradiol (237 pmol/l) and testosterone (3.0 nmol/l) than the control subjects (oestradiol: 113 pmol/l, testosterone: 1.9 nmol/l) but were not more obese or hirsute. Amenorrhoea was unrelated to the duration or severity of liver disease. The metacarpal cortical bone area (an index of bone density) was inversely related to the duration of amenorrhoea (p less than 0.02). We conclude that amenorrhoea in women with non-alcoholic chronic liver disease arises from hypothalamic-pituitary dysfunction and can occur at any stage. 
Computer-assisted superimposition of magnetic resonance and high-resolution technetium-99m-HMPAO and thallium-201 SPECT images of the brain. A method for registering three-dimensional CT, MR, and PET data sets that require no special patient immobilization or other precise positioning measures was adapted to high-resolution SPECT and MRI and was applied in 14 subjects (five normal volunteers, four patients with dementia (Alzheimer's disease), two patients with recurrent glioblastoma, and three patients with focal lesions (stroke, arachnoid cyst and head trauma]. T2-weighted axial magnetic resonance images and transaxial 99mTc-HMPAO and 201Tl images acquired with an annular gamma camera were merged using an objective registration (translation, rotation and rescaling) program. In the normal subjects and patients with dementia and focal lesions, focal areas of high uptake corresponded to gray matter structures. Focal lesions observed on MRI corresponded to perfusion defects on SPECT. In the patients who had undergone surgical resection of glioblastoma followed by interstitial brachytherapy, increased 201Tl corresponding to recurrent tumor could be localized from the superimposed images. The method was evaluated by measuring the residuals in all subjects and translational errors due to superimposition of deep structures in the 12 subjects with normal thalamic anatomy and 99mTc-HMPAO uptake. This method for superimposing magnetic resonance and high-resolution SPECT images of the brain is a useful technique for correlating regional function with brain anatomy. 
Survival of patients with dementia. The evidence on survival in dementia is summarized. There are no reliable data on survival after onset of dementia or after first contact with medical services. People with dementia in outpatient clinics and nursing homes have 2-year survival rates of 75% (range 60%-95%) and 50% (range 30%-65%), respectively. Differences in survival between patients with senile dementia of the Alzheimer's type (SDAT) and multi infarct dementia (MID) are small. Women in nursing homes have a better prognosis than men (2-year survival rates, 60% vs 40%). Dementia patients have a considerable excess mortality when compared to the vital statistics. There is no evidence for improvement of survival rates during recent decades. Recommendations for future studies are made. 
Percutaneous excimer laser coronary angioplasty of lesions not ideal for balloon angioplasty BACKGROUND. Excimer laser coronary angioplasty is a new, investigational technique for treating coronary artery stenoses. Initial reports have demonstrated acute efficacy and relative safety of this procedure, but have not addressed the effect of lesion type on acute success and complication rates. METHODS AND RESULTS. In the first 100 patients undergoing percutaneous excimer laser coronary angioplasty at our institution, acute laser success was obtained in 84% and procedural success was obtained in 94%. There were six acute closures during laser angioplasty and one myocardial infarction. Two patients required emergency coronary bypass surgery. Sixty-five percent of patients had lesions not ideal for balloon angioplasty because of lesion morphology (tubular, diffuse, or chronic total occlusion) or ostial location. There were 10 tubular stenoses, 29 diffuse lesions, 18 chronic total occlusions, and eight ostial lesions, including five aorto-ostial lesions. In this nonideal subgroup, the acute success rate with laser was 86% (72% of chronic total occlusions and 91% of non-totally occluded lesions), and the procedural success rate was 94%. There were three acute occlusions during laser angioplasty but no myocardial infarctions, emergency bypass surgeries, or deaths. One coronary artery perforation occurred without clinical sequelae. Laser angioplasty was successful in four of six lesions (67%) in which balloon angioplasty had failed. Laser success was obtained in 10 of 11 (91%) moderately or heavily calcified stenoses. Eight eccentric lesions and two lesions on bends were successfully treated without dissection or perforation. No side branch occlusions occurred in the 15 patients in whom one or more major branches originated within the lesion treated. Adjunctive balloon angioplasty was performed in 47% of cases, usually to obtain a larger final luminal diameter. Need for adjunctive balloon angioplasty decreased to 36% after a larger (2.0 mm) laser catheter became available. Twenty-eight percent of the 105 lesions treated were American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association classification type A, 47% were type B, and 25% were type C. Laser and procedural successes were obtained in 83% and 97% of type A, 88% and 96% of type B, and 85% and 88% of type C lesions, respectively. CONCLUSIONS. In our initial experience, excimer laser angioplasty was found to be acutely effective and safe therapy for lesions identified as not ideal for balloon angioplasty. This technique may provide a useful adjunct or alternative to balloon angioplasty in selected patients. 
The postmenopausal adnexal mass: correlation between ultrasonic and pathologic findings. One hundred two postmenopausal women underwent ultrasonographic evaluation of adnexal masses before surgery. Twenty-nine (28%) had malignant tumors and 73 (72%) had benign tumors. Two of 33 patients with a "simple cyst" smaller than 5 cm in diameter by ultrasound had malignant ovarian tumors. Twenty-two of the 52 women (42%) with "complex masses" by ultrasound and five of the 17 (29%) with solid tumors had ovarian cancer. For predicting malignancy in ovarian tumors, abdominal ultrasonography had a positive predictive value of 39% and a negative predictive value of 94%. If a negative sonogram had been relied upon, 6% of malignant ovarian tumors in postmenopausal women might have been missed. 
A comparison of enalapril with hydralazine-isosorbide dinitrate in the treatment of chronic congestive heart failure BACKGROUND. To define better the efficacy of vasodilator therapy in the treatment of chronic congestive heart failure, we compared the effects of hydralazine and isosorbide dinitrate with those of enalapril in 804 men receiving digoxin and diuretic therapy for heart failure. The patients were randomly assigned in a double-blind manner to receive 20 mg of enalapril daily or 300 mg of hydralazine plus 160 mg of isosorbide dinitrate daily. The latter regimen was identical to that used with a similar patient population in the effective-treatment arm of our previous Vasodilator-Heart Failure Trial. RESULTS. Mortality after two years was significantly lower in the enalapril arm (18 percent) than in the hydralazine-isosorbide dinitrate arm (25 percent) (P = 0.016; reduction in mortality, 28.0 percent), and overall mortality tended to be lower (P = 0.08). The lower mortality in the enalapril arm was attributable to a reduction in the incidence of sudden death, and this beneficial effect was more prominent in patients with less severe symptoms (New York Heart Association class I or II). In contrast, body oxygen consumption at peak exercise was increased only by hydralazine-isosorbide dinitrate treatment (P less than 0.05), and left ventricular ejection fraction, which increased with both regimens during the 2 years after randomization, increased more (P less than 0.05) during the first 13 weeks in the hydralazine-isosorbide dinitrate group. CONCLUSIONS. The similar two-year mortality in the hydralazine-isosorbide dinitrate arms in our previous Vasodilator-Heart Failure Trial (26 percent) and in the present trial (25 percent), as compared with that in the placebo arm in the previous trial, (34 percent) and the further survival benefit with enalapril in the present trial (18 percent) strengthen the conclusion that vasodilator therapy should be included in the standard treatment for heart failure. The different effects of the two regimens (enalapril and hydralazine-isosorbide dinitrate) on mortality and physiologic end points suggest that the profile of effects might be enhanced if the regimens were used in combination. 
Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia after heart transplantation. Five patients with Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia after heart transplantation are reported. Four had severe clinical symptoms, whereas 1 was asymptomatic. Mechanical ventilatory support was necessary in 1 because of respiratory distress. Pneumocystis carinii infection developed in 4 patients within the first 4 postoperative months, and 1 patient had clinical disease 1 year after transplantation with a recurrence 9 months later. All were treated with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole either orally or intravenously (10 to 20 mg.kg-1.day-1 of trimethoprim). All patients recovered from infection and received the same drug prophylactically for 2 to 20 months after the infection. All patients are doing well after Pneumocystis carinii infection except 1 who died after an acute myocardial infarction 4 years after infection. We conclude that trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole is an effective agent for the treatment of Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia after heart transplantation. 
Detection of single copies of Epstein-Barr virus in paraffin wax sections by non-radioactive in situ hybridisation. A highly sensitive non-isotopic in situ hybridisation technique was developed for the localisation of Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) in paraffin wax embedded tissue sections. The method uses a repeated sequence of the EBV genome as a probe, labelled with the novel reporter molecule, digoxigenin. The method can identify individual copies of EBV by detection of both EBV DNA and highly localised RNA transcripts. A combination of careful proteolytic digestion of tissue sections, high temperature denaturation of probe and target DNA, and sensitive immunocytochemical detection are used to attain single copy sensitivity. The technique is quicker and simpler to perform than some other methods used for the identification of EBV, and provides simultaneous morphological information which cannot be obtained by methods using tissue extracts. This method permits the investigation of the role of EBV in neoplastic conditions of lymphoid and epithelial cells, and may prove valuable in determining the sites of latent virus in healthy subjects. 
Intrathoracic meningocele associated with neurofibromatosis: case report. The authors present a case of intrathoracic meningocele associated with neurofibromatosis. Computed tomography with metrizamide myelography proved valuable in locating the lesion, thus facilitating surgical intervention. With the preoperative diagnosis established and the severity of the meningocele known, the surgeons safely employed a subpleural approach at thoracotomy. 
Mechanism of cyclosporine-induced hypertension. Cyclosporine is a common immunosuppressive agent used in solid organ and bone marrow transplants and the treatment of some immunological diseases. It has been established that treatment with cyclosporine can cause a patient to develop hypertension within a few weeks of treatment. This review will examine this effect and effective ways to treat it. 
Mucosal and systemic IgA anti-gliadin antibody in celiac disease. Contrasting patterns of response in serum, saliva, and intestinal secretions. Serum IgA anti-gliadin antibody estimation is a recognized screening method for celiac disease. However, celiac disease is primarily a small intestinal mucosal disorder, and so we have examined the possibility that secreted, mucosal IgA anti-gliadin antibody might provide a more relevant measure of gluten sensitivity than that obtained from serum tests. Serum IgA anti-gliadin antibody and serum, salivary, and small intestinal aspirate IgA anti-gliadin antibody were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Serum IgA and IgG anti-gliadin antibody were markedly increased in untreated celiacs (N = 31) as compared to normals (N = 20) or disease controls (N = 39) (P less than 0.0001). Levels were lower in treated (N = 30) than untreated celiacs (P less than 0.001). In intestinal aspirates both untreated and treated patients had similar levels of IgA anti-gliadin antibody (P = 0.48), but both were significantly higher than in controls (P less than 0.01). Salivary IgA anti-gliadin antibody, by contrast, was not increased in celiac patients as compared to controls. Serum IgA anti-gliadin antibody was the most sensitive (84%) and specific (95%) test for detecting untreated celiac disease. It was also the most useful in patient follow-up where it provides an early objective indicator of adherence to a gluten-free diet. Mucosal IgA responses to gliadin in celiac disease appear to be compartmentalized, with different portions of the gastrointestinal tract functioning as separate immunological organs. Our results also demonstrate that serum and secretory IgA production are under independent control. 
Intraaortic balloon pumping as the postangioplasty strategy in acute myocardial infarction. To assess the usefulness of intraaortic balloon pumping (IABP) in acute myocardial infarction (AMI), 114 patients with anterior AMI undergoing emergency percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA) for total occlusion of the left anterior descending artery were studied. After successful PTCA 66 patients were treated with conventional therapy (group I), and 48 patients were treated with IABP for 25 +/- 8 hours (group II). The reocclusion rate was significantly lower in group II (2.4% vs 17.7% p less than 0.05). An increase in ejection fraction in group II compared with group I was marginally significant (4.5 +/- 12.2% vs 9.2 +/- 13.0%, p = 0.08). Vascular complications occurred in two patients, but there were no deaths from IABP. These results suggest that after successful PTCA for acute myocardial infarction, IABP prevents reocclusion and may add strength to reperfusion in the improvement of left ventricular function. 
IIB osteosarcoma. Current management and survival statistics in the USSR. Three hundred and ninety-three patients with IIB osteosarcoma were treated at the author's institution between 1955 and 1986. In the first stage of the study, 88 patients were treated with surgery only. The five-year disease-free survival rate was 7%. In the second stage of the study, the efficacy of preventive chemotherapy after radical surgery was studied in 55 patients. The five-year disease-free survival rate was 34.4%. In the third stage of the study, the efficacy of combination therapy consisting of preoperative treatment, limb-saving surgery, and preventive chemotherapy was studied in 66 patients. The five-year disease-free survival rate was 35.5%. The authors examined results in 21 patients with Grade IV responses to evaluate the relationship between prognosis and morphogenic changes after preoperative radiotherapy and chemotherapy. The five-year disease-free survival rate was 57.9%. In the fourth stage of the study (conducted in 1986), two regimens of preoperative chemotherapy were initiated. The first regimen consists of intraarterial platinum infusions to patients with lower extremity bone damage. The second regimen consists of high-dose methotrexate infusions. The preliminary conclusion is that primary tumor damage is significantly more marked after intraarterial cisplatin infusion. 
Single motor end-plates in myasthenia gravis and LEMS at different firing rates. The jitter and frequency of blocking was studied at single motor end-plates in 10 patients with myasthenia gravis (MG) and in a patient with Lambert-Eaton myasthenic syndrome (LEMS), using single fiber EMG (SFEMG) with axonal microstimulation at rates varying from 0.5 Hz to 20 Hz. While some myasthenic motor end-plates showed lowest degrees of transmission disturbance at the lowest rates and most pronounced abnormality at the highest rates of stimulation, over one-half were most abnormal at intermediate rates and improved at higher rates. In 1 patient, all end-plates behaved in this way. On the other hand, all end-plates in the LEMS patient showed the expected improvement of the abnormal jitter and blocking on increasing the stimulation rate. It is argued that improvement of jitter and blocking at higher rates, unless dramatic, does not necessarily suggest a presynaptic abnormality. 
Treatment of esophageal varices: low versus high dose of 5% ethanolamine oleate. Twenty-four patients, undergoing sclerotherapy for esophageal varices, were injected with 10-20 ml of ethanolamine oleate 5% in the first treatment session (group A). Fourteen patients were injected with 40 ml of the same sclerosant in the first session (group B). Retrospective analysis was carried out to evaluate the efficacy and safety of the two doses. Variceal eradication was achieved in group B in significantly fewer sclerotherapy sessions. Rebleeding occurred in 16% of patients in group A, compared with no rebleeding in group B. There was no significant difference in the incidence of various complications. We conclude that the use of 40 ml of 5% ethanolamine oleate in the first session is more effective and as safe as the use of 20 ml of the same sclerosant. 
Proarrhythmia, cardiac arrest and death in young patients receiving encainide and flecainide. The Pediatric Electrophysiology Group The potential for proarrhythmic responses to the class IC sodium channel-blocking drugs encainide and flecainide has not been well described in young patients. Therefore, data were retrospectively collected from 36 institutions regarding 579 young patients who were administered encainide or flecainide for treatment of supraventricular tachycardias (encainide 86 patients, flecainide 369 patients) or ventricular arrhythmias (encainide 21 patients, flecainide 103 patients) to assess the frequency of proarrhythmia, cardiac arrest and death during therapy (adverse events). The two drugs were similar in regard to efficacy (flecainide 71.4%, encainide 59.8%) and rate of proarrhythmic responses (flecainide 7.4%; encainide 7.5%). However, patients receiving encainide more frequently experienced cardiac arrest (encainide 7.5% vs. flecainide 2.3%, p less than 0.05) or died during treatment (encainide 7.5% vs. flecainide 2.1%, p less than 0.05). Detailed data were provided for 44 patients experiencing one or more adverse events. Patient age, previous drug trials, concomitant therapy and days of inpatient monitoring were similar for patients receiving encainide or flecainide. However, echocardiographic left ventricular shortening before treatment was lower among patients receiving encainide (0.23 +/- 0.09) than among those receiving flecainide (0.34 +/- 0.06, p less than 0.05). Plasma drug concentrations were rarely elevated. Cardiac arrest (12 patients) and deaths (13 patients) occurred predominantly among patients with underlying heart disease, particularly among patients receiving flecainide for supraventricular tachycardia (8.3% vs. 0.3%, p less than 0.001). Fifteen patients with an ostensibly normal heart and normal ventricular function experienced proarrhythmia during treatment for supraventricular tachycardia, but only 3 of the 15 had a cardiac arrest or died. The relatively high incidence of adverse events should be considered when contemplating treatment with encainide or flecainide, particularly among patients with underlying heart disease. 
Effect of plasma glucose on infarct size in focal cerebral ischemia-reperfusion. Although hyperglycemia has been shown to consistently exacerbate ischemia brain injury following global or diffuse cerebral ischemia, the effect of hyperglycemia in unilateral focal cerebral ischemia remains controversial. Recent advances in thrombolytic therapy have enhanced the clinical significance of postischemic reperfusion. We studied the effect of plasma glucose on ischemic brain injury in a newly developed focal cerebral ischemia-reperfusion model. Rats allowed free access to food until ischemic insult developed intra- and postischemic hyperglycemia and cortical infarction. Rats fasted for 24 hours had blunted hyperglycemic responses. Infarct volumes were correspondingly smaller. The protective effect of fasting was partially abolished by glucose loading during ischemia to induce intra-ischemic hyperglycemia. Glucose loading immediately or 3 hours after focal cerebral ischemia did not significantly alter the protective effect of fasting. Insulin treatment in fed rats before ischemia also reduced hyperglycemic responses and infarct volume. Timing of insulin treatment was also critical in the reduction of ischemic injury. These findings indicate that plasma glucose during the period of ischemia is an important determinant of brain injury in focal cerebral ischemia-reperfusion and there is a therapeutic window for normalization of plasma glucose to be efficacious. 
The role of albumin in human physiology and pathophysiology, Part III: Albumin and disease states. The serum albumin level is one of several clinical parameters of the status of general health. There is a marked correlation between low albumin levels and the incidence of morbidity and mortality in hospitalized patients. Therefore, it is not surprising to find that hypoalbuminemia is a common finding among hospitalized patients. This results from alterations in the catabolic or anabolic rates, losses of albumin, or redistribution between the various fluid compartments of the body. Somewhat less well defined than the role of albumin as a prognostic indicator is its role in compounding pathophysiology. Hypoalbuminemia is known to be associated with delayed wound healing. The hypoalbuminemic state interferes with the normal functioning of the gastrointestinal tract. Qualitative changes in the albumin molecule which occur in renal disease may damage the nephron. Low serum albumin levels may adversely affect the coagulation system. Further investigation into the role of albumin in pathophysiology is warranted. 
Blood pressure as a risk factor for cardiovascular disease. The Framingham Study--30 years of follow-up Data from 30 years of follow-up of the original Framingham Study cohort of 5,070 men and women aged 30-62 years who were first examined during the period 1948-1952 and who were free of cardiovascular disease reveal that blood pressure is a strong and consistent predictor of the development of coronary heart disease, stroke, transient ischemic attack, and congestive heart failure. Other factors related to blood pressure like obesity, left ventricular hypertrophy as demonstrated on electrocardiograms, and heart enlargement as shown by x-ray radiography made several selective additional independent contributions to risk; heart enlargement by x-ray radiography was the best predictor of congestive heart failure. 
Crohn's colitis complicated by superimposed invasive amebic colitis. The clinical characteristics and endoscopic appearance of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) may be very similar to those of amebic colitis. Physicians, especially in areas in which amebiasis is endemic, are familiar with this difficulty. Moreover, in individual cases, it may even be impossible to distinguish between the two conditions, since stool specimens, bowel biopsies, and serological studies may be negative for Entamoeba histolytica, even in the presence of invasive amebic colitis. Invasive amebiasis may rarely be superimposed on IBD, which further complicates the issue. We report here a young patient with a 7-yr history of Crohn's colitis proven histologically who developed invasive amebic colitis during steroid and 6-mercaptopurine treatment for active disease. Stool specimens, mucosal biopsies, and serological studies were negative for E. histolytica, and the diagnosis was established on pathological examination of a surgically resected bowel. Anti-amebic therapy should be considered in endemic areas in cases of persistent IBD. 
Malignant melanoma occurring in those aged under 30 in the west of Scotland 1979-1986: a study of incidence, clinical features, pathological features and survival. The study population consisted of the 95 patients who presented with cutaneous malignant melanoma in the west of Scotland between 1979 and 1986 and who were aged under 30 at the time of diagnosis. Over this 7-year period, 1299 melanomas were diagnosed in all age groups in this geographical area, increasing in incidence by 82% from 135 in 1979 to 246 in 1986. The proportion of melanomas diagnosed before the patients' thirtieth birthday remained constant at 6%. None were diagnosed in the under-15 age-group, and none developed on giant congenital naevi. Forty-two of the 95 melanomas (44%) in the under-30 group developed on a small naevus present either from birth or early childhood. These melanomas were thicker than those apparently developing on normal skin, but once controlled for tumour thickness and sex the presence of a pre-existing naevus did not affect 5-year survival. The overall 5-year survival was 76% with poorer survival associated with thicker tumours and male sex. This study suggests that small early onset naevi may have a higher potential for post-pubertal malignant change than has been previously recognized. 
Haemodynamic changes during the apnoea test for diagnosis of brain death. Haemodynamic responses to the apnoea test for the diagnosis of brain death were investigated in nine patients with severe head injury or cerebrovascular disease. To prove apnoea, the ventilator was disconnected for ten minutes and oxygen was insufflated to avoid hypoxaemia. No respiratory movement was seen in any patient. Ten minutes after disconnecting the ventilator, PaCO2 was increased to 78 +/- 3 mmHg and pH was reduced to 7.17 +/- 0.02. Adequate oxygenation was maintained in all patients. Cardiac output increased from 4.8 +/- 0.7 to 5.7 +/- 0.8 L.min-1 (P less than 0.05), and mean pulmonary artery pressure increased from 11 +/- 1 to 17 +/- 2 mmHg (P less than 0.01). However, mean arterial pressure, heart rate, pulmonary artery wedge pressure and right atrial pressure did not change. Plasma catecholamines were measured in three patients. Plasma norepinephrine concentrations increased in all three patients but the changes in plasma epinephrine were minimal. These circulatory responses to acute hypercapnia were less than those reported in awake volunteers and in patients during general anaesthesia. However, since plasma norepinephrine concentration increased during the test, some sympathoadrenal response, probably of spinal origin, was present, and may have prevented the direct depressant circulatory effects of acute hypercapnia. In conclusion, the apnoea test did not produce haemodynamic disturbances when respiratory acidosis was limited to a pH 7.17 +/- 0.02 and PaCO2 60-80 mmHg. 
Traumatic facial injuries with steering wheel loading. This study was conducted to evaluate the biomechanics of facial fractures caused by steering wheel loading. Twelve intact fresh human cadaver heads were impacted onto standard or energy-absorbing steering wheels with a custom-designed and validated vertical-drop apparatus. Either zygoma was impacted once at a velocity of 2.0-6.9 m/s. The specimens were oriented to permit a direct comparison between pretest and posttest radiography, and two-dimensional and three-dimensional CT images. Bone mineral content was determined, and biomechanical forces, accelerations, and deformations were recorded. More severe fractures were associated with higher forces on the zygoma. With increasing velocities, fractures initiated at the zygomatic region propagated to other unilateral regions such as the mandible and orbit or to the contralateral side. Less facial trauma was observed with energy-absorbing steering wheels compared with standard wheels at similar impact velocities. Bone mineral content did not correlate well with specimen age or with fracture severity. Clinically significant fractures were identifiable on 3-D CT images. The flexibility of 3-D CT in evaluating the spatial extent of facial abnormalities in different orientations may have significant impact in planning surgical procedures. 
Erythropoietin concentrations in obstructive sleep apnoea. Eight patients with obstructive sleep apnoea and a normal haemoglobin concentration underwent nocturnal studies during which oxyhaemoglobin saturation was recorded continuously with an ear oximeter and serum erythropoietin concentration was measured hourly by means of a radioimmunoassay. Serum erythropoietin concentrations remained within the normal range throughout the study despite falls in oxyhaemaglobin saturation in individuals to 33-78%. There was no relation between the degree of nocturnal hypoxaemia and serum erythropoietin concentrations. The brief cyclical episodes of hypoxaemia typical of obstructive sleep apnoea may not be a sufficient stimulus for erythropoietin secretion. 
A frameless, armless navigational system for computer-assisted neurosurgery. Technical note. A computer-assisted neurosurgical navigational system has been developed which displays intraoperative manipulation on the preoperative computerized tomography (CT) scans or magnetic resonance (MR) images. The system consists of a three-dimensional digitizer, a personal computer, and an image-processing unit. Utilizing recently developed magnetic field modulation technology, the three-dimensional digitizer determines the spatial position and orientation angles of the resin probe, triangle-shaped pointer, or suction tube with a small attached magnetic field sensor. Four fiducial markers on the scalp were used to translate the spatial data of the probe onto the preoperative CT scans or MR images of the patient. With this frameless, armless navigational system, CT or MR-imaging stereotaxy can be applied to conventional open neurosurgery without limiting the operative field or interfering with the surgical procedures. 
Diclofenac delays healing of gastroduodenal mucosal lesions. Double-blind, placebo-controlled endoscopic study in healthy volunteers. The effects of the water-soluble and delayed-release formulations of a nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drug, diclofenac, on the healing of gastroduodenal mucosal lesions were compared in a double-blind, double cross-over, placebo-controlled endoscopic study conducted in 14 healthy volunteers. Severe endoscopic lesions (petechiae, erosions, ulcers, and esophageal candidiasis) were found only in the group taking the soluble formulation of diclofenac (P less than 0.05 vs placebo). The endoscopic healing of biopsies at one week was delayed by both preparations in comparison to placebo (P less than 0.05 vs placebo). Neither formulation produced significantly more histological inflammation or minor endoscopic lesions (erythema, red striae) than placebo. Both formulations were equally well tolerated and produced no more symptoms than placebo. This study suggests that soluble diclofenac acts topically to delay gastroduodenal healing and produce gastroduodenal injury; it thus provides a model for future studies of the production, perpetuation, and healing of peptic lesions. 
Progressive congestive heart failure. Ways to approach office management. Treatment of congestive heart failure depends on the cause, precipitating factors, and symptoms of the disease in each patient. Dr Kahn outlines the use of the three main types of pharmacologic agents given for heart failure--diuretics, vasodilators, and digoxin. He describes a stepwise regimen, whereby agents are added as needed to improve symptoms and prolong life. 
Combined evaluation of total and functional liver plasma flows and intrahepatic shunting A diagnostic protocol was studied, designed to evaluate the main parameters of liver circulation in man. A water solution of D-sorbitol (S) and indocyanine green (ICG) was infused intravenously in six controls and nine cirrhotics. Steady-state renal and hepatic S clearances as well as hepatic ICG clearance were calculated. In controls the values (mean +/- SD) of the independent measurements of S and ICG hepatic clearance were 978 +/- 107 and 519 +/- 142 ml/min, respectively, while in cirrhotic patients they were 554 +/- 238 and 231 +/- 90 ml/min. Owing to the kinetic properties of S, its hepatic clearance may be regarded as a measure of functional liver plasma flow (FLPF). The total liver plasma flow (TLPF) values (mean +/- SD), calculated according to Fick's principle, were 1091 +/- 157 ml/min (S method) and 1033 +/- 153 ml/min (ICG method) in controls, and 1251 +/- 554 and 1284 +/- 677 ml/min in cirrhotics. In controls, FLPF was found to be very close to TLPF. In cirrhotic patients the difference between TLPF and FLPF (ranging from 169 to 2093 ml/min when measured by S method) was considered as an approximate estimate of intrahepatic shunting. The procedure is safe and simple and may add a new dimension to the investigation of hepatic circulation. 
Treatment of superior vena cava thrombosis with recombinant tissue type plasminogen activator. Thrombotic occlusion of the superior vena cava is an uncommon but serious complication of chronic indwelling venous catheters. Several reports have shown thrombolytic therapy with intravenous streptokinase or urokinase to be effective in the treatment of this condition. We report a case of superior vena cava thrombosis in a 53-year-old woman receiving chemotherapy for breast carcinoma through a subcutaneously implanted venous access catheter who was successfully treated with peripheral infusion of recombinant tissue type plasminogen activator (rtPA). 
The aphasic isolate. A clinical-CT scan study of a particularly severe subgroup of global aphasics. This paper outlines the clinical and CT scan features of a subtype of global aphasia, characterized by an extreme loss of communicative abilities, verbal as well as nonverbal. Three to four weeks after a left hemisphere stroke, 17 patients were completely unable to communicate with people addressing them. Though there were differences in their willingness to interact with the environment, they were characterized by complete loss of speech output and by inaccessibility to any kind of message, whether given verbally or through gestures. Patients who survived were reassessed 6 and 12 mos later and half of them were still found in a state of complete communicative isolation. The remainder had somewhat improved, but remained globally aphasic. The attempt to find a CT scan basis for this picture was disappointing. Only 35% of patients had a lesional pattern in agreement with the traditional view that ascribes global aphasia to the involvement of Broca's and Wernicke's areas. The location of lesion in the other cases spanned from anterior cortical damage, to posterior cortical damage, to deep nuclei damage and none of the lesions that have been proposed to account for subcortical global aphasia was consistently observed. 
Clinical factors affecting the immediate outcome of PTCA in patients with unstable angina and poor candidates for surgery. Percutaneous Transluminal Coronary Angioplasty (PTCA) has been successfully applied in unstable angina to carefully selected patients. In this study, PTCA was performed in 277 consecutive patients suffering from unstable angina and for whom bypass surgery was not a valid alternative because either of inoperable conditions or of emergency, or because surgery was not the best option. All patients were admitted first to the intensive care unit where an attempt was made to control unstable angina under conventional medical therapy using at least iv nitroderivative, heparin, and calcium blockers. After a standardized preparation PTCA was performed either as an emergency procedure in medically refractory unstable angina (107 cases) or as an elective procedure in controlled situations after a 7 to 10 days symptom-free period. Three hundred fifty-three coronary vessels were attempted. Results of this group are compared with those of a control group made of 670 consecutive stable patients recruited during the same period, and clinical characteristics are envisaged as potential predictive factors. Unstable angina is undoubtedly associated with a higher overall complication rate, but the immediate outcome is strongly affected by the clinical context. As an example, respective success and mortality rates are: 93% and 0% when a full revascularization is attempted; 91% and 0% in elective procedures in patients under 60; 87% and 1.2% in elective PTCA for multiple vessel disease; 80% and 6.5% in emergency PTCA; 80% and 11% in the overall triple vessel disease; 84% and 16% in patients with deeply altered ejection fraction; and 58% and 26% in triple vessel disease with 2 previously occluded coronary arteries. 
Hemodynamic effects of octreotide in patients with autonomic neuropathy. BACKGROUND. The somatostatin analogue, ectrootide, is being used to treat postprandial hypotension in patients with autonomic neuropathy. Although the therapeutic effect of the drug is presumably secondary to a splanchnic vasoconstrictor action, its effect on splanchnic hemodynamics has never been characterized in patients with autonomic neuropathy. Moreover, it is unknown whether octreotide acts on other vascular beds in this group of patients or whether it affects cardiac output. We, therefore, measured splanchnic, forearm, and systemic vascular resistance and cardiac output before and after administering octreotide (0.4 microgram/kg s.c.) to patients with idiopathic autonomic neuropathy and diabetic autonomic neuropathy. METHODS AND RESULTS. Splanchnic blood flow was determined from the clearance of indocyanine green in seven patients. We observed that octreotide decreased splanchnic blood flow (from 850 +/- 77 to 664 +/- 48 ml/min, p less than 0.005), increased mean blood pressure (from 97 +/- 6 to 115 +/- 3 mm Hg, p less than 0.005), and increased splanchnic vascular resistance (from 0.118 +/- 0.012 to 0.18 +/- 0.018 mm Hg/ml/min, p less than 0.005). Forearm blood flow was measured by plethysmography in 13 patients. Octreotide increased forearm vascular resistance in patients with idiopathic autonomic neuropathy (n = 8) from 19.1 +/- 1.0 to 27.2 +/- 3.8 mm Hg/ml/min/100 ml forearm volume (p less than 0.01) and from 25.2 +/- 3.9 to 41.0 +/- 6.8 mm Hg/ml/min/100 ml (p less than 0.01) in patients with diabetic autonomic neuropathy (n = 5). Cardiac output was measured by two-dimensional echocardiography. Octreotide administration increased cardiac output in five of six patients with idiopathic autonomic neuropathy (from 4.4 +/- 0.4 to 5.0 +/- 0.5 l/min, p less than 0.02) and five of five patients with diabetic autonomic neuropathy (from 3.8 +/- 0.4 to 5.1 +/- 0.4 l/min, p less than 0.02). Systemic vascular resistance increased in patients with idiopathic autonomic neuropathy from 21.2 +/- 2 to 24.9 +/- 2.6 (p less than 0.05) but did not change in patients with diabetic autonomic neuropathy. CONCLUSION. The pressor effect of octreotide in patients with autonomic neuropathy is associated with increased splanchnic and forearm vascular resistance and with increased cardiac output. 
Medical aspects of delayed convalescence. Disease and illness are not synonymous. In most instances, disease is demonstrable by anatomic, physiologic, biochemical, microbiologic, or immunologic abnormalities. Disease is a pathologic process. Not all persons with a disease are sick or ill. Symptoms of illness associated with a disease may be manifest or persist after the disease has disappeared. The absence of demonstrable disease, however, does not necessarily mean that symptoms of illness are unreal. Recovery from disease and recovery from illness are not always equated. Many factors, including personal characteristics and social circumstances, can be responsible for recovery from disease and illness. Chronic fatigue syndrome or symptoms of illness can persist in some patients but not in others after many different diseases. 
How to identify psychogenic disorders of stance and gait. A video study in 37 patients. Thirty-seven patients with psychogenic disorders of stance and gait were clinically evaluated, recorded on video, and analysed with regard to clinical phenomenology. Characteristic, suggestive and unspecific features were identified. Six characteristic features proved most valuable for diagnosis of psychogenesis, as they occurred alone or in combination in 97% of patients: (1) momentary fluctuations of stance and gait, often in response to suggestion; (2) excessive slowness or hesitation of locomotion incompatible with neurological disease; (3) "psychogenic" Romberg test with a build-up of sway amplitudes after a silent latency or with improvement by distraction; (4) uneconomic postures with wastage of muscular energy; (5) the "walking on ice" gait pattern, which is characterized by small cautious steps with fixed ankle joints; (6) sudden buckling of the knees, usually without falls. Seventy-three percent of patients had additional suggestive features. Classification into characteristic subtypes was not found useful because predominant features varied from patient to patient and occurred in various combinations. Factitious impairment of stance and gait was studied in 13 healthy drama students. Simulated gait dysfunction appeared less conspicuous and more difficult to diagnose than the clinical psychogenic disorders. 
An analysis of thirty cases of orbital lymphangioma. Pathophysiologic considerations and management recommendations. Thirty cases of orbital lymphangioma were reviewed. Clinical, imaging, and microscopic findings were integrated to develop a pathophysiologic construct and management guidelines. The basic lesion might be considered an abortive vascular system which arborizes among normal structures. Intrinsic hemorrhage expands portions of the small-caliber network into large blood cysts, prompting clinical recognition. While major hemorrhage led to early surgery in 12 cases, long pretreatment intervals could be analyzed in 17 others. Twelve patients had second hemorrhages of varied magnitude, from 2 weeks to 15 years after initial recognition; five patients did not in an average of 6.8 years. Some blood cysts contracted spontaneously. Among 23 operated cases, 12 patients had major new bleeds from 4 days to 12 years after initial surgery; 11 patients did not in an average of 4.2 years. Poor final visual acuity was associated with multiple surgeries. The authors advocate conservatism in surgical case selection and in operative dissection. 
Percutaneous coronary excimer laser-assisted angioplasty: initial multicenter experience in 141 patients. Initial multicenter clinical experience with percutaneous coronary excimer laser-assisted angioplasty is described for 158 lesions in 141 patients. Using a xenon chloride (308 nm) excimer laser generator and 1.5 to 1.75 mm catheters, excimer laser angioplasty was attempted at 135 ns pulse width, 25 to 40 Hz repetition rate, 2 to 5 s laser delivery time and 30 to 60 mJ/mm2 energy fluence. Laser success (greater than 20% improvement in luminal diameter) was achieved in 138 (87%) of 158 lesions, with a reduction to less than 50% stenosis noted in 77 lesions (49%). Overall, laser-assisted balloon angioplasty success (less than 50% residual stenosis without major complication) was observed in 129 (91%) of 141 patients. Procedural complications (abrupt closure 1.3%, side branch occlusion 1.9%, intimal dissection 6.3%, embolization 1.3%, filling defect 1.3%, perforation 1.9% and spasm 1.3% and major complications (non-Q wave myocardial infarction 4.8%, emergency coronary bypass surgery 3.5% and death 0%) were infrequent and predominantly related to subsequent balloon angioplasty. In the early follow-up period (range 1 to 10 months, mean 7), 111 (79%) of the 141 patients remain asymptomatic, whereas symptoms have recurred in 27 (19%) and 3 patients (2.1%) have died. Thus, percutaneous coronary excimer laser angioplasty appears to be a feasible and safe procedure. Assessment of the impact of this technology on the acute complications of and restenosis rates after angioplasty awaits further follow-up analysis. 
Long-term nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drug use and Helicobacter pylori infection. This study investigates whether patients who take nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs are more likely to have Helicobacter pylori gastritis than age-matched individuals who do not take nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs, and whether patients who take nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs who are also infected with H. pylori are more likely to have dyspepsia, mucosal damage, or ulcers than those who are not infected. Two studies were performed, one serological and the other endoscopic, both in arthritis patients receiving nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs chronically. The presence of H. pylori was identified with a sensitive enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay test. One hundred eighty-three patients participated in the serological study and 75 patients in the endoscopic study. The frequency of H. pylori infection increased with age, independent of nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drug use; the age-adjusted frequency of H. pylori infection in arthritis patients paralleled that of 351 asymptomatic individuals without arthritis. The frequency of H. pylori infection increased from 30.7% in age group 21-30 years to 73.4% in age group 61-75 years. Nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drug-induced mucosal injury, either hemorrhages or erosions, was more frequent in those without H. pylori infection than with infection (61% vs. 32% for hemorrhages and 57% vs. 34% for erosions for those without and with H. pylori infection; only the difference in the frequency of hemorrhages was significant, P less than 0.05). No difference was observed in the presence of dyspeptic symptoms between those with and without H. pylori infection. These data suggest that nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drug-induced damage to the gastroduodenal mucosa does not increase the susceptibility to H. pylori infection. 
Effects of hypercapnia and hypocapnia on respiratory resistance in normal and asthmatic subjects. The effects of hypercapnia and hypocapnia on respiratory resistance were studied in 15 healthy subjects and 30 asthmatic subjects. Respiratory resistance (impedance) was measured with the pseudo-random noise forced oscillation technique while the subjects rebreathed from a wet spirometer in a closed respiratory circuit in which end tidal carbon dioxide tension (PCO2) could be controlled. Hypercapnia was induced by partially short circuiting the carbon dioxide absorber, and hypocapnia by voluntary hyperventilation. The circulating air was saturated with water vapour and kept at body temperature and ambient pressure. A rise of end tidal PCO2 of 1 kPa caused a significant fall in respiratory resistance in both normal and asthmatic subjects (15% and 9% respectively). A fall of PCO2 of 1 kPa did not cause any significant change in impedance in the control group. In the asthmatic patients resistance increased by 13%, reactance fell by 45%, and the frequency dependence of resistance rose 240%. These findings confirm that hypocapnia may contribute to airway obstruction in asthmatic patients, even when water and heat loss are prevented. 
Gliofibroma. Case report. The case history of an infant with a large gliofibroma is presented. Gliofibromas are rare mixed glialmesenchymal tumors that have been poorly characterized. The computerized tomography appearance and a detailed light and electron microscopic description are presented, along with immunoperoxidase studies of this tumor. This case is compared with gliofibromas described elsewhere in the literature. 
Midgut volvulus in infants: diagnosis with US. Work in progress. The authors present findings from ultrasound (US) studies that can alert sonologists to the possibility of midgut malrotation complicated by volvulus in neonates and infants. A fluid-filled, distended duodenum seen at US examination in infants is a nonspecific sign of duodenal obstruction, as well as one of the signs of midgut malrotation. In addition, dilated, thick-walled bowel loops, mainly to the right of the spine, and peritoneal fluid were found at abdominal US examinations of three infants with midgut malrotation complicated by volvulus. In one infant with uncomplicated midgut malrotation, only signs of duodenal obstruction were present. The findings at US of duodenal obstruction associated with thickened bowel loops to the right of the spine and peritoneal fluid should lead the sonologist to suspect midgut malrotation complicated by volvulus, a potentially fatal condition, and an upper gastrointestinal series should then be performed to confirm the diagnosis. 
Optimal dose of neuroleptic in acute schizophrenia. A controlled study of the neuroleptic threshold and higher haloperidol dose. After individual determination of neuroleptic threshold (NT) doses of haloperidol, 106 patients with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder (Research Diagnostic Criteria) were treated openly at such doses (mean, 3.7 +/- 2.3 mg/d) for 2 weeks. Ten responding patients were discharged and unavailable for follow-up or refused subsequent randomization, and one non-responding patient refused randomization. The remaining 95 responding or nonresponding patients were then randomly assigned, double-blind, to a dosage of haloperidol two to 10 times higher (mean, 11.6 +/- 4.7 mg/d) or to a continuing NT dosage (mean, 3.4 +/- 2.3 mg/d) for another 2 weeks. Of the 58 patients exposed only to NT dosages of haloperidol, 72% clinically recovered within the 5-week trial. Higher dosages given to 47 patients did not lead to greater improvement in measures of psychosis, but did produce slightly greater declines in measures of hostility. Higher dosages did regularly lead to significant increases in distressing extrapyramidal side effects. 
Physiology and pathophysiology of colonic motor activity (2). The basic motor function of the colon is to mix and knead its contents, propel them slowly in the caudad direction, hold them in the distal colon until defecation, and provide a strong propulsive force during defecation. Infrequently, it also produces mass movements in the proximal colon. These motor functions are achieved in most species by three different types of contractions: the individual phasic contractions that include the short- and long-duration contractions, organized groups of contractions that include the migrating and nonmigrating motor complexes, and special propulsive contractions (giant migrating contractions). The spatial and temporal patterns of all of these contractions are controlled by myogenic, neural, and chemical control mechanisms. The individual phasic contractions are highly disorganized in time and space in the colon. For this reason, they are effective in mixing and kneading and slow distal propulsion. The underlying cause of the disorganization of short duration contractions is the irregularity in the frequency and waveshape of colonic electrical control activity and its phase unlocking throughout the colon. The individual contractions in many species occur in cyclic bursts called contractile states. At least in some species, these contractile states exhibit mostly caudad and sometimes orad migration. However, there are also nonmigrating or randomly migrating contractile states in the colon. These two patterns of contractile states are called colonic migrating motor complexes and colonic nonmigrating motor complexes, respectively. The giant migrating contractions provide the strong propulsive force for defecation and mass movements. The neural control of colonic contractions is organized at three levels--enteric, autonomic, and central. The enteric nervous system contains cholinergic and peptidergic neurons and plays a major role in the control of colonic contractions. The autonomic nerves, the vagi, pelvic, lumbar colonic, hypogastric, and splanchnic nerves, seem to continuously monitor the state of the colon and provide a modulatory input when necessary. These nerves play a major role in the reflexive control of colonic motor function. The voluntary input from the central nervous system coordinates the motor activity of the colon, rectum, anal canal and sphincters for orderly evacuation of feces during defecation. The role of acetylcholine, nonadrenaline, and the yet to be completely identified nonadrenergic, noncholinergic neurotransmitter, possibly VIP, in the control of contractions is fairly well established. Besides these, there are several other peptides and chemicals that are localized in the colonic wall; their physiological roles remain unknown. Colonic motor activity has been studied in several disease states. The findings have not always been consistent.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS). 
Assessment of the role of the glucocorticoid system in aging processes and in the action of food restriction. The Glucocorticoid Cascade Hypothesis of Aging and the hypothesis that food restriction retards the aging processes by preventing the development with age of hyperadrenocorticism were investigated. A longitudinal life span study of the daily concentration pattern of plasma corticosterone was conducted in male Fischer 344 rats fed ad libitum or restricted to 60% of the mean food intake of ad libitum fed rats. In another group of ad libitum fed and food-restricted rats, the influence of age on the response of plasma corticosterone levels to restraint stress was measured as was the time course of the return of plasma corticosterone to basal levels following the stress. The findings do not support the hypothesis that food restriction retards the aging processes by preventing the development of hyperadrenocorticism with advancing age. They also indicate that the Glucocorticoid Cascade Hypothesis does not describe a major aspect of the aging processes. Rather, the results suggest the possibility that a lifetime of daily periods of mild hyperadrenocorticism may, if anything, retard the aging processes. 
Effects of calcium-free solution, calcium antagonists, and the calcium agonist BAY K 8644 on mechanical responses of skeletal muscle from patients susceptible to malignant hyperthermia. The purpose of this investigation was to determine if alteration in the function of the dihydropyridine receptor may in turn modify halothane-induced contractures in muscle bundles from patients susceptible to malignant hyperthermia (MH). The effects of Ca(2+)-free Krebs Ringer (KR) solution, 5 microM verapamil, 5 microM nifedipine, and 10 microM of the Ca2+ agonist BAY K 8644 on halothane-induced contracture were therefore investigated. The halothane-induced contracture was prevented in the absence of extracellular Ca2+ and significantly reduced in the presence of verapamil or nifedipine. BAY K 8644 significantly enhanced the 0.5-, 1.0-, and 1.5-vol % halothane-induced contracture in MH-susceptible muscle bundles. When BAY K 8644 was dissolved in Ca(2+)-free KR solution, no contracture was observed in MH-susceptible muscle bundles. These results on cut MH-susceptible human muscle bundles support the hypothesis that halothane-induced contracture in MH can be modified by the binding of Ca2+ agonists or antagonists to the dihydropyridine receptor. The role of Ca2+ entry phenomena remains unclear, but the results suggest that extracellular Ca2+ is required to reprime or to bind to some sites of the dihydropyridine receptors. 
Regulation of MHC class II antigen expression. Opposing effects of tumor necrosis factor-alpha on IFN-gamma-induced HLA-DR and Ia expression depends on the maturation and differentiation stage of the cell. MHC class II induction by cytokines has been suggested to play a major role in the initiation and propagation of immune and autoimmune processes. TNF-alpha has been found both to enhance and also to inhibit IFN-gamma-induced MHC class II expression. In the present studies, the effect of TNF-alpha on IFN-gamma induced MHC class II expression was tested in various cell lines. On the basis of the data, we propose that, depending on the stage of differentiation and maturation of the cells, TNF-alpha might synergize or antagonize the affects of IFN-gamma on the regulation of MHC class II expression. Thus, in immature cells such as HL-60 or THP-1, TNF-alpha enhances IFN-gamma-induced class II expression. However, when differentiation was induced in these cells by TPA or IFN-gamma, the additive effect of TNF-alpha on the IFN-gamma induced DR expression was eliminated. Furthermore, TNF-alpha down-regulates the IFN-gamma-induced class II expression in differentiated cells such as human skin fibroblasts or activated macrophages. In bone marrow cells induced to differentiate in vitro, TNF-alpha decreased the IFN-gamma-induced MHC class II expression in a maturation-dependent fashion. These results provide a rational explanation for the conflicting reports regarding the effect of TNF-alpha on IFN-gamma-induced class II expression. But more importantly they may be relevant to the biologic function of TNF-alpha. Thus, we show that TNF-alpha-treated mice have reduced level of Ia expression on peritoneal macrophages and in vivo treatment with TNF-alpha antagonizes the ability of IFN-gamma to induce class II expression on these macrophages. 
A comparison of enalapril with hydralazine-isosorbide dinitrate in the treatment of chronic congestive heart failure BACKGROUND. To define better the efficacy of vasodilator therapy in the treatment of chronic congestive heart failure, we compared the effects of hydralazine and isosorbide dinitrate with those of enalapril in 804 men receiving digoxin and diuretic therapy for heart failure. The patients were randomly assigned in a double-blind manner to receive 20 mg of enalapril daily or 300 mg of hydralazine plus 160 mg of isosorbide dinitrate daily. The latter regimen was identical to that used with a similar patient population in the effective-treatment arm of our previous Vasodilator-Heart Failure Trial. RESULTS. Mortality after two years was significantly lower in the enalapril arm (18 percent) than in the hydralazine-isosorbide dinitrate arm (25 percent) (P = 0.016; reduction in mortality, 28.0 percent), and overall mortality tended to be lower (P = 0.08). The lower mortality in the enalapril arm was attributable to a reduction in the incidence of sudden death, and this beneficial effect was more prominent in patients with less severe symptoms (New York Heart Association class I or II). In contrast, body oxygen consumption at peak exercise was increased only by hydralazine-isosorbide dinitrate treatment (P less than 0.05), and left ventricular ejection fraction, which increased with both regimens during the 2 years after randomization, increased more (P less than 0.05) during the first 13 weeks in the hydralazine-isosorbide dinitrate group. CONCLUSIONS. The similar two-year mortality in the hydralazine-isosorbide dinitrate arms in our previous Vasodilator-Heart Failure Trial (26 percent) and in the present trial (25 percent), as compared with that in the placebo arm in the previous trial, (34 percent) and the further survival benefit with enalapril in the present trial (18 percent) strengthen the conclusion that vasodilator therapy should be included in the standard treatment for heart failure. The different effects of the two regimens (enalapril and hydralazine-isosorbide dinitrate) on mortality and physiologic end points suggest that the profile of effects might be enhanced if the regimens were used in combination. 
Endoscopic injection sclerotherapy versus conservative treatment for patients with unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma and bleeding esophageal varices. We performed endoscopic injection sclerotherapy (EIS) in the treatment of 37 patients with bleeding esophageal varices due to unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). The results were compared with those in another 33 HCC patients treated only conservatively, without EIS, during the same period. A majority of both groups died within 3 weeks after treatment. Comparing the two groups, there was no significant difference in fatal bleeding (66% vs 75%), but significantly fewer of the EIS patients died of the index hemorrhage (43% vs. 83%; p less than 0.01). Also, in the absence of portal vein thrombosis, EIS significantly reduced the risk of fatal bleeding (31% vs. 73%; p less than 0.25). The mean days of survival were 32 +/- 15 (range, 2 to 320) in the EIS group and 10 +/- 14 (range, 2 to 270) in the compared group (p less than 0.001). We conclude that EIS provides temporary control of acute esophageal variceal bleeding in patients with unresectable HCC. The major factors contributing to EIS failure are the lethal propensity of the underlying disease and portal vein thrombosis. 
A relationship between proteinuria and acute tubulointerstitial disease in rats with experimental nephrotic syndrome. The relationship between tubulointerstitial nephritis and proteinuria was characterized in experimental nephrosis in rats. In one group, proteinuria induced by aminonucleoside of puromycin (PAN) was reduced by using an 8% protein diet and adding the angiotensin I-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor enalapril to the drinking water. Two control groups were injected with saline and PAN, respectively, and fed a 27% protein diet. The first group had significantly reduced albuminuria and a definite attenuation of tubular cell injury. There was a strong positive correlation between the number of interstitial macrophages and albuminuria. The beneficial effect was reproduced by dietary-protein restriction alone, whereas ACE inhibition alone had an insignificant effect on the degree of proteinuria. Depletion of circulating T lymphocytes in one group of nephrotic rats eliminated interstitial lymphocytes but did not affect interstitial macrophage influx. Inhibition of the in situ proliferation of resident interstitial macrophages by unilateral kidney irradiation failed to change the intensity of the macrophage infiltration. Treatment of rats with sodium maleate produced proximal tubular cell toxicity but interstitial inflammation did not develop, suggesting that the latter is not a nonspecific response to tubular injury. These studies demonstrate a strong relationship between tubulointerstitial nephritis and the severity of proteinuria in experimental nephrosis. 
The dizzy patient: etiologic treatment. The basis for the vestibular complaint in dizzy patients should be viewed as having an etiology rather than a description of its clinical presentation. Effective treatment of vestibular disorders is based on the stabilization of the vestibular abnormality, to allow for central vestibular compensation. While not all of the etiologies for dizziness have been described, there are effective etiologic treatments available. These fit into categories of neurotransmitters, blood sugar and blood fat control, hormones, minerals, and treatments for autoimmune dizziness. 
Contractile response of aorta to alpha 1-adrenergic stimulation in Ca(2+)-free medium is reduced in spontaneous hypertension. Vascular responses of aortic rings to alpha 1-adrenergic stimulation by phenylephrine (Phe) from spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) and normotensive Wistar-Kyoto rats (WKY) were studied in Ca(2+)-containing medium and Ca(2+)-free medium plus 50 mumol/L EGTA. Although there was no difference in the sustained force development between SHR and WKY vessels in response to 100 mmol/L KCl or 10 mumol/L Phe in Ca(2+)-containing medium, the transient contractile response to 10 mumol/L Phe in Ca(2+)-free medium was substantially smaller in SHR compared to that in WKY. Subsequent addition of 2.5 mmol/L Ca2+ restored the sustained contractile response to a similar level in both SHR and WKY vessels. The transient contractile response to Phe in Ca(2+)-free medium containing EGTA, presumably due to the release of intracellular Ca2+, decreased progressively with preincubation time in Ca(2+)-free medium, indicating intracellular Ca2+ depletion. Such a temporal change of aortic response was more pronounced in SHR than in WKY. The subsequent response to Ca2+ repletion in the presence of Phe, on the other hand, increased progressively with Ca(2+)-depletion period and was higher in SHR than in WKY. The rate of relaxation after washout of Phe was slower in SHR aorta compared to WKY aorta. These results, together with our earlier findings, collectively suggest that the previous known deficiency in Ca2+ pumping mechanisms of vascular muscle microsomes leading to a reduced functional size of intracellular Ca2+ pool may account for the smaller contractile response of SHR aorta to alpha 1-adrenergic stimulation in Ca(2+)-free medium and the slower rate of relaxation. 
The occurrence of epilepsy and febrile seizures in Virginian and Norwegian twins. Twin studies provide an efficient method for examining the importance of genetic and environmental factors in the etiology of disorders such as epilepsy. Population-based twin registries are especially valuable for studies of this type since effects of reporting and self-selection biases on the resulting data are minimized. Among 14,352 twin pairs contained in the Virginia and Norwegian twin panels for whom questionnaire information was available, there was a history of epilepsy in one or both members of 286 pairs; febrile seizures were reported in 257 pairs. Analyses of questionnaire data revealed no significant differences in concordance rates between Virginian and Norwegian twins for either epilepsy or febrile seizures. Probandwise concordance rates for epilepsy were 0.19 in monozygotic twins and 0.07 in dizygotic twins. Analogous rates for febrile seizures were 0.33 (monozygotic) and 0.11 (dizygotic). These results provide further evidence that genetic factors do have a role in the expression of epilepsy and febrile seizures. 
Retinal migraine, chorea, and retinal artery thrombosis in a patient with primary antiphospholipid antibody syndrome. We report the case of a patient with the unusual combination of migraine, chorea, and retinal arterial thrombosis along with laboratory evidence of autoimmunity. In the absence of systemic lupus erythematosus, the clinical manifestations suggest the presence of the primary antiphospholipid antibody syndrome. 
Inability of coronary blood flow reserve measurements to assess the efficacy of coronary angioplasty in the first 24 hours in unselected patients. To determine functional and anatomic changes in the first 24 hours after coronary angioplasty, we studied at random 15 patients (9 men, mean age 60 years) who underwent coronary angioplasty of 16 coronary arteries. Quantitative coronary angiography and coronary flow reserve measurements from digitized coronary angiograms were performed before, immediately after, and 24 hours after coronary angioplasty. Calculated were the minimal luminal diameter, obstruction area, and percentage diameter stenosis from two preferably orthogonal projections. Prior myocardial infarction in the myocardial region of interest was present in four patients. Seven patients had multivessel disease. Collateral vessels supplying the compromised flow region were observed in three patients. Six patients had refractory unstable angina pectoris. After coronary angioplasty, angiographically visible dissection was noted in six patients, whereas side branch occlusion was observed in one. Minimal luminal diameter before, immediately after, and 24 hours after was 0.93 +/- 0.18 mm, 1.53 +/- 28 mm, and 1.53 +/- 0.21 mm, respectively; obstruction area was 0.70 +/- 0.26 mm2, 1.92 +/- 0.69 mm2, and 1.87 +/- 0.51 mm2, respectively; diameter stenosis was 60.4 +/- 8.0%, 36.8 +/- 11.4%, and 37.6 +/- 5.3%, respectively. The coronary flow reserve (lower limit of normal with this technique 3.4) was essentially the same before and immediately after coronary angioplasty (1.26 +/- 0.59 vs 1.30 +/- 0.42, p = NS) with a slight improvement to 1.78 +/- 0.90 (p less than 0.05) 1 day later. Coronary artery dimensions correlated poorly with coronary blood flow reserve before and after angioplasty. 
Posterior cortical dementia with alexia: neurobehavioural, MRI, and PET findings. A progressive disorder of relatively focal but asymmetric biposterior dysfunction is described in a 54 year old right handed male. Initial clinical features included letter-by-letter alexia, visual anomia, acalculia, mild agraphia, constructional apraxia, and visuospatial compromise. Serial testing demonstrated relentless deterioration with additional development of transcortical sensory aphasia, Gerstmann's tetrad, and severe visuoperceptual impairment. Amnesia was not an early clinical feature. Judgment, personality, insight, and awareness remained preserved throughout most of the clinical course. Extinction in the right visual field to bilateral stimulation was the sole neurological abnormality. Early CT was normal and late MRI showed asymmetrical bioccipitoparietal atrophy with greater involvement of the left hemisphere. Results from positron emission tomography (PET) showed bilaterally asymmetric (left greater than right) occipitotemporoparietal hypometabolism. The metabolic decrement was strikingly asymmetric with a 50% reduction in glucose consumption confined to the left occipital cortex. The picture of occipitotemporoparietal compromise verified by MRI, PET, and neurobehavioural testing would be unusual for such degenerative dementias as Alzheimer's (AD) and Pick's disease, although atypical AD with predominant occipital lobe involvement cannot be excluded. This case supports the concepts of posterior cortical dementia (PCD) as a clinically distinct entity and for the first time documents its corresponding metabolic deficit using PET. 
Evaluation of salvage surgery in heavily irradiated cancer of the buccal mucosa. This report describes the authors' experience with salvage surgery in 78 patients with carcinoma of the buccal mucosa who failed after high-dose radical radiation therapy at Regional Cancer Centre, Trivandrum, India. Forty-four patients (56%) required a hemimandibulectomy for adequate tumor clearance. Fifty-four patients (69%) required a primary reconstructive procedure for wound closure. Follow-up periods ranged from 28 months to 63 months (median follow-up, 41 months). Thirteen patients (17%) developed nonfatal postoperative complications. Thirty-one patients recurred after surgery, five of whom were again salvaged by further surgery. Overall, the recurrence rate was 36%. Most of the recurrences (26/31) were at the primary site. The overall 5-year actuarial disease-free survival after salvage surgery was 59.7%. T stage of the recurrent tumor and its skin infiltration emerged as factors which significantly influenced disease-free survival (P less than 0.05). 
Reactive astrogliosis is widespread in the subcortical white matter of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis brain. Widespread astrogliosis exists in the subcortical white matter in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). As revealed by glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) immunostaining, the gliosis has the morphological properties of an active process. It is present in the midfrontal, inferior parietal, temporal, cingulate, and occipital cortices, as well as in the motor cortex. Compared to matched regions from other neurological diseases, the gliosis in ALS does not appear to be the nonspecific result of a progressive, degenerative disease. In cell number and apparent cell size, the gliosis is comparable to that present in neurological diseases known to have white matter gliosis. Cytologically, the gliosis most closely resembles that present in cases of cerebral infarction. The basis for this similarity is unknown. 
Reversibility of cardiac abnormalities in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected individuals: a serial echocardiographic study. Seventy adults who tested positive for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) were prospectively studied with serial echocardiography to better define the prevalence and progression of cardiac disease in such patients. Fifty outpatients (Group A), including 44 with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) and 6 with AIDS-related complex, and 20 additional patients (Group B) with asymptomatic HIV infection had baseline echocardiographic studies at a time when no patient had symptomatic heart disease. Follow-up studies were performed at 9 +/- 3 months in 52 patients (74%) and again at 15 +/- 3 months after baseline studies in 29 patients (41%). During the study, 22 patients (44%) in Group A and 1 patient (5%) in Group B died. Cardiac abnormalities were noted in 26 patients (52%) in Group A and 8 patients (40%) in Group B (p = NS) on initial or follow-up study. An abnormal left ventricular ejection fraction (less than 45%) or fractional shortening (less than 28%) was seen in seven patients in Group A; of these, three had normal left ventricular function on a later echocardiogram. One patient in Group B had persistent left ventricular dysfunction. All patients in Group A with left ventricular dysfunction on two serial studies died within 1 year after the initial echocardiogram. Ejection fraction did not change between baseline and two follow-up studies in either group (A: 52 +/- 9 vs. 56 +/- 9 vs. 55 +/- 5%, p = NS; B: 58 +/- 6 vs. 58 +/- 5 vs. 59 +/- 6%, p = NS). Right-sided cardiac enlargement resolved in 18 patients (44%), including 5 of 10 in Group A and 3 of 8 in Group B. 
Intestinal permeability after single dose gluten challenge in coeliac disease. The changes of intestinal permeability before and after a gluten load were studied. The study group comprised 27 patients with coeliac disease (mean age 12.3 years) and 19 healthy controls matched by sex and age. Intestinal permeability was studied by measuring the urinary excretion of two sugars, lactulose and L-rhamnose, before and six hours after the ingestion of five palatable biscuits made with 50 g of gluten powder. The patients with coeliac disease had been on a gluten free diet during the previous two years. After the gluten load lactulose and L-rhamnose urinary excretion changed significantly in patients, and a significant increase in the lactulose: L-rhamnose ratio was also observed. No significant changes were observed in the controls. In view of the modification of the three biopsies diagnostic protocol made by the European Society for Paediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition, permeability tests associated with single gluten challenges may be an added contribution to the accuracy of the diagnosis in childhood. 
Clinical course and outcome in class IC antiarrhythmic overdose. 120 cases of class IC antiarrhythmic overdose, including propafenone, flecainide, ajmaline and prajmaline overdose, were evaluated with respect to clinical course, therapy and outcome. Whereas drug overdose in general has an overall mortality of less than 1%, intoxication with antiarrhythmic drugs of class IC was associated with a mean mortality of 22.5%. Nausea, which occurred within the first 30 minutes after ingestion, was the earliest symptom. Spontaneous vomiting probably led to self-detoxication in about half the patients. Cardiac symptoms including bradycardia and, less frequently, tachyrhythmia occurred after about 30 minutes to 2 hours. Therapeutic measures included administration of activated charcoal, gastric lavage and a saline laxative, catecholamines, and in some patients, hypertonic sodium bicarbonate, insertion of a transvenous pacemaker and hemoperfusion. Fatal outcome was mainly due to cardiac conduction disturbances progressing to electromechanical dissociation or asystolia. Resuscitation, which had to be performed in 29 patients, was successful in only two of them. No correlation was found between fatal outcome, the type of antiarrhythmic, and ingested dose. Since a specific treatment is not available and resuscitive procedures including sodium bicarbonate and insertion of a pacemaker are of limited therapeutic value, early diagnosis and primary detoxification are most important for prevention of fatal outcome. 
A pilot study of sphincter-sparing management of adenocarcinoma of the rectum. After analysis of 26 prospectively accrued patients with distal rectal adenocarcinomas who underwent sphincter preservation treatment, we have concluded that tumors that invade only the submucosa can safely be treated with surgery alone and that tumors that invade the muscularis or further can be safely treated with surgery combined with chemoradiotherapy. None of the patients had either local or distant recurrence, with a median follow-up of 21 months. All patients have been fully continent. The results, although preliminary, imply that resection of distal rectal adenocarcinoma with sphincter preservation, and adjuvant therapy when appropriate, have achieved local and distant control equal to the conventional Miles' abdominoperineal resection, but without the need for a permanent colostomy. 
Value of transesophageal echocardiography as an adjunct to transthoracic echocardiography in evaluation of native and prosthetic valve endocarditis. To determine if transesophageal echocardiography provides better visualization of valvular vegetations than transthoracic echocardiography, we used both methods to evaluate 24 consecutive patients (mean age, 54 years; 15 female patients and nine male patients) referred for symptoms suggestive of infectious endocarditis. Ten of the 24 patients had one or more valvular prostheses. Echocardiograms were classified as positive or negative based on visualization of valvular vegetations or abscesses. Of ten patients with a final diagnosis of infectious endocarditis on extended follow-up, transthoracic echocardiography was positive in five patients. Transesophageal echocardiography not only yielded abnormal findings in all ten of these patients, but also revealed additional information in four of the five patients with abnormal transthoracic echocardiographic examinations. Among the 14 patients who, on subsequent follow-up, were found not to have infectious endocarditis, transthoracic echocardiography was normal in 13 and falsely abnormal in one. Transesophageal echocardiography revealed no evidence of infectious endocarditis in any of these patients. The ten patients who were determined to have infectious endocarditis all had positive blood cultures and no alternative cause for their clinical presentation; in seven patients in this group who underwent operative or postmortem evaluation, infectious endocarditis was confirmed. All patients without infectious endocarditis were demonstrated to have other causes for their clinical presentation. We conclude that transesophageal echocardiography is a highly valuable test in the work-up of patients with suspected infectious endocarditis, especially those patients with inconclusive or normal transthoracic echocardiograms. In addition, transesophageal echocardiography may be of benefit to patients with previously documented infectious endocarditis and a complicated clinical course in whom additional cardiac lesions are suspected but not demonstrated by transthoracic echocardiography. 
C5a, cutaneous mast cells, and inflammation: in vitro and in vivo studies in a murine model. To evaluate further the interactions of C5a and mast cells in cutaneous inflammation, the ability of human native C5a (nC5a) (10 to 500 ng/ml) and human recombinant C5a (rC5a) (10 ng/ml to 100 ng/ml) to induce histamine release from purified BALB/c cutaneous mast cells (CMC) and peritoneal mast cells (PMC) was analyzed. It was found that nC5a induced histamine release from CMC but not from PMC, with a maximal net release at 250 ng/ml nC5a (22.8 +/- 2.6%). Kinetic experiments demonstrated that nC5a-induced maximal net histamine release occurred 5 min after the presentation of this stimulus (25.8 +/- 6.0%). Using rC5a and CMC, dose-response studies indicated a maximal net release of 7.0 +/- 1.7% at rC5a of 10 ng/ml, and kinetic studies showed a maximal net release at 5 min of incubation (12.9 +/- 1.6%). Release induced by rC5a was calcium-dependent, and peaked at 30 degrees C. These results indicate that functional heterogeneity exists between the CMC and the PMC of BALB/c mice, that C5a is a relevant stimulus for characterization of this heterogeneity, and that CMC from these animals can serve as a convenient in vitro model for the study of human C5a-mast cell interactions. In vivo, injections of nC5a (25-100 ng) and rC5a (25-100 ng) into the skin of BALB/c mice induced an increase in cutaneous vasopermeability, as assessed by the extravasation of intravenously injected 125I-bovine serum albumin. nC5a induced a dose-dependent increase in vasopermeability, whereas alterations induced by rC5a plateaued at 50 ng. The C5a-induced vasopermeability was markedly enhanced in animals that had been previously treated with an inhibitor of serum carboxypeptidase, which converts C5a to the less potent derivative, C5a des Arg. These findings suggest that carboxypeptidase plays an important role in vivo in the modulation of C5a-induced cutaneous inflammation in murine skin. 
Elevated intravesical pressure causes arterial hypoperfusion in canine colocystoplasty: a fluorometric assessment. Since 1988 there have been 15 reported cases of late, spontaneously ruptured intestinal cystoplasties at bowel sites remote from the anastomosis. Ischemic necrosis has been suggested as a possible etiology. We examined this hypothesis by quantifying the uptake of intravascular fluorescein in the augmented bowel of adult mongrel canines. There was a statistically significant decrease in fluorescein uptake at high intravesical pressures, which appeared to be most pronounced at the antimesenteric border. This laboratory study supports a recent clinical report of histological changes pathognomonic for chronic ischemia in the augmented bowel of patients with spontaneous rupture. 
Predictive value of ventricular arrhythmias for patency of the infarct-related coronary artery after thrombolytic therapy. In animal studies reperfusion of coronary arteries is commonly accompanied by ventricular arrhythmias. It is not certain, however, whether ventricular arrhythmias can be used as a reliable non-invasive marker of reperfusion in humans. Two-channel Holter recordings were obtained from the start of an intravenous infusion of streptokinase until coronary angiography (2.8 (2.7) hours (mean SD)) afterwards) in 57 patients with acute myocardial infarction of less than four hours who were generally not treated with antiarrhythmic drugs. Ventricular arrhythmias occurred in 21 (37%) of the 57 patients: accelerated idioventricular rhythm in 13 patients and non-sustained ventricular tachycardia in 15 patients. Seven patients had both accelerated idioventricular rhythm and non-sustained ventricular tachycardia. Coronary angiography showed a patent infarct-related vessel in 12 (92%) of the 13 patients with accelerated idioventricular rhythm (95% confidence interval 66 to 99%), in 22 (50%) of the 44 patients without accelerated idioventricular rhythm (95% CI 34 to 66%), in 11 (73%) of the 15 patients with non-sustained ventricular tachycardia (95% CI 45 to 92%), and in 23 (55%) (95% CI 39 to 71%) of the 42 patients who did not have non-sustained ventricular tachycardia. Seventeen (81%) of the 21 patients with accelerated idioventricular rhythm, or non-sustained ventricular tachycardia, or both, had a patent infarct-related vessel (95% CI 58 to 94%) as did 17 (47%) of the 36 patients with no ventricular arrhythmia (95% CI 29 to 65%). In patients with accelerated idioventricular rhythm after thrombolysis the infarct-related vessel is almost certain to be patent; but the infarct-related coronary artery can still be patent when no arrhythmia is seen. 
Atypical hyperplasia of the breast: mammographic appearance and histologic correlation. The mammograms and histologic slides of 58 cases of atypical hyperplasia (AH) of the breast were retrospectively reviewed to determine the geographic correlation (direct, near, or remote) between mammographic abnormalities (if present) and the histologic findings. A direct mammographic-histologic correlation was found in 24 of the 58 cases (41%), near correlation in 15 (26%), and remote correlation in 19 (33%). Clustered microcalcifications were the most common mammographic abnormality that was directly correlated with AH at histologic examination. Atypical ductal hyperplasia was much more frequently associated with a direct mammographic-histologic correlation than was atypical lobular hyperplasia (48% vs 9%). The authors conclude that, although no pathognomonic appearance of AH was discovered, mammographic abnormalities similar to those of small cancers could be directly correlated with histologic findings in 41% of cases. Since AH has been shown to be associated with a five- to tenfold increased risk of subsequent invasive carcinoma, frequent clinical and at least yearly mammographic follow-up is suggested once AH is discovered. 
A randomized study of closure of the peritoneum at cesarean delivery. This study was conducted to test the hypothesis that nonclosure of the visceral and parietal peritoneum during low transverse cervical cesarean delivery is not associated with increased intraoperative or immediate postoperative complications. One hundred thirteen patients scheduled for low transverse cervical cesarean were randomized to either closure of both the visceral and parietal peritoneum with absorbable suture (N = 59) or no peritoneal closure (N = 54). Patients were cared for in the usual postoperative manner without reference to treatment group. There were no demographic differences between the groups and no differences in method(s) of anesthesia, operative indication(s), or use of peripartum epidural narcotics. The incidence of fever, endometritis, or wound infection was similar between groups. There were no differences in the number of patients requiring parenteral narcotic analgesia or in the number of doses per patient. The number of oral analgesic doses was significantly greater with closure than without (P = .014). The frequency with which postoperative ileus was diagnosed in each group was similar, and there was no difference regarding the day on which patients were advanced to liquid or select diets. Bowel stimulants were administered more frequently to the closure than to non-closure patients (P = .03). The average operating time was shorter for the open group than for the closure group (P less than .005). We conclude that non-closure of the visceral and parietal peritoneum at low transverse cervical cesarean delivery appears to have no adverse effect on immediate postoperative recovery, may decrease postoperative narcotic requirements, allows less complicated return of bowel function, and provides a simplified and shorter surgical procedure. 
Experience with the first 250 endometrial resections for menorrhagia [published erratum appears in Lancet 1991 Jan 1;337(8753):1362] 234 patients with menorrhagia were treated hysteroscopically by transcervical resection of the endometrium (TCRE) instead of hysterectomy. 250 procedures were performed under general anaesthesia (63%) or under sedation plus local anaesthesia (38%). The endometrium was excised either totally (91%) or partially (9%) in all but one case, and 56 (22%) of the patients underwent simultaneous resection of submucous fibroids. Surgical time (range 10-100 min) varied with the gynaecologist's experience. 479 ml was the average volume of uterine irrigant absorbed by the patient. Blood loss was usually slight. Operative complications were uncommon, but 4 (2%) women sustained a uterine perforation (without serious sequelae), 7 (3%) absorbed more than 2 litres of fluid, and 1 required tamponade to control postoperative bleeding. Hospital stay was short and full recovery usual by 1-2 weeks. Menstrual symptoms improved in over 90% of the patients throughout the follow-up of up to 2 1/2 years; 27-42% of the women became amenorrhoeic at some time after total TCRE. Results were best in women greater than 35 years of age, but was not influenced by the presence of fibroids or pretreatment dysmenorrhoea. 10 (4%) women later underwent hysterectomy. Hysteroscopy 3 and 12 months after surgery revealed a small, fibrotic uterine cavity in the majority. 
Pathologic fibrosis and matrix connective tissue in the subaortic myocardium of patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. To evaluate scar-type and matrix connective tissue and to assess their role in the diastolic dysfunction of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, surgically resected subaortic myectomy specimens and several autopsy hearts from patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy were studied. Eighteen specimens were differentially stained by a newly developed method that precisely determines relative collagen content; these tissues were compared with postmortem hypertrophied and normal control subaortic specimens. Quantitation revealed a 72% higher level (36.5 vs. 22.1 micrograms collagen/mg protein) of stainable collagen in the hearts with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy than in hypertrophied control hearts. The endocardial plaque was quantitated morphometrically, and it constituted only 4.6 +/- 1.7% of the total increased collagen content in the cardiomyopathy specimens. For the matrix studies, the cardiomyopathy specimens were stained by a silver impregnation technique that identifies connective tissue elements not normally visible with routine histologic methods. There was a marked increase in content of all matrix components, both in areas of pathologic scarring and in "normal" zones. Whorls of matrix connective tissue were noted in regions of myocyte whorls, as well as independent of them. Thus, these studies revealed a striking increase of both scar-type and matrix connective tissue in hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. The extensive scarring and the pronounced interstitial and intercellular matrix connective tissue may contribute to the increased ventricular chamber stiffness and impaired relaxation in this disease. 
Erythropoietin concentrations in obstructive sleep apnoea. Eight patients with obstructive sleep apnoea and a normal haemoglobin concentration underwent nocturnal studies during which oxyhaemoglobin saturation was recorded continuously with an ear oximeter and serum erythropoietin concentration was measured hourly by means of a radioimmunoassay. Serum erythropoietin concentrations remained within the normal range throughout the study despite falls in oxyhaemaglobin saturation in individuals to 33-78%. There was no relation between the degree of nocturnal hypoxaemia and serum erythropoietin concentrations. The brief cyclical episodes of hypoxaemia typical of obstructive sleep apnoea may not be a sufficient stimulus for erythropoietin secretion. 
Growth of tracheal anastomoses: advantage of absorbable interrupted sutures [published erratum appears in Ann Thorac Surg 1991 Jul;52(1):176] Growth of the trachea after complete transection and anastomosis was studied in four groups of 1-month-old New Zealand white rabbits. The trachea was transected at the fifth cartilaginous ring and then anastomosed with continuous 6-0 polypropylene (Prolene) (group 1), interrupted 6-0 polypropylene (group 2), continuous 6-0 polydioxanone (PDS) (group 3), or interrupted 6-0 PDS (group 4). The animals were followed up for 90 to 103 days (mean follow-up, 95 days). At the time the animals were killed, body weight had increased 125% (1.2 to 2.7 +/- 0.18 kg). Growth of the trachea was assessed at the time of death. Results from this study suggest that growth of a tracheal anastomosis is retarded in a growing animal model. The degree of resultant stenosis was significantly less when an absorbable suture material (PDS) and an interrupted suturing technique were used. 
Impedance plethysmography: a new method for continuous muscle perfusion monitoring. Vigilant postoperative monitoring of the buried muscle flap is critical after free transfer because early diagnosis of vascular insufficiency is essential to allow prompt correction. We have identified a monitoring method utilizing needle electrodes and impedance plethysmography that gives a beat-to-beat representation of muscular perfusion. In 25 New Zealand White rabbits the gastrocnemius muscle was isolated on its vascular pedicle, and two intramuscular needle electrodes were placed. The instantaneous impedance changes of the muscle (corresponding to the pulsatile volume changes of perfusion) were measured and recorded. Using this representation of perfusion, an independent judge was able to correctly diagnose muscular ischemia 100 percent of the time (n = 25). Further, the judge was able to correctly distinguish the ischemia as arterial (n = 10) or venous (n = 10) in origin 100 percent of the time. Additionally, we monitored muscle perfusion transcutaneously in five free muscle flaps and demonstrated a reliable impedance signal that correlated with perfusion. 
Sclerosing vasculopathy of the central nervous system in nonelderly demented patients. Three nonelderly patients without hypertension whose clinical and radiologic features otherwise resembled Binswanger's subcortical arteriosclerotic encephalopathy underwent biopsy of the hyperintense periventricular lesions seen on magnetic resonance imaging. The pathologic findings of the periventricular lesions consisted of gliosis with mild rarefaction and edema of the white matter. All patients had a sclerosing vasculopathy of unknown cause, which involved numerous small vessels within the periventricular lesions. The vessels stained negatively for amyloid, amyloid precursors, desmin, vimentin, keratin, immunoglobulin, and complement. On electron microscopy, small arteries, arterioles, venules, and capillaries were characterized by swollen astrocytic foot processes surrounding the vessels; dense, perivascular collagen packing; crystalline arrays of filaments within basement membrane; giant lipid-laden lysosomes within perivascular cells; and narrowing of the vascular lumina. Similar changes were not seen in a control group of 19 patients. The pathologic features of the vessels in these cases are distinct from the vasculopathy associated with Binswanger's subcortical arteriosclerotic encephalopathy. We suggest that a spectrum of vasculopathies may be associated with dementia and periventricular hyperintense lesions on magnetic resonance imaging. 
Invasive treatment of pancreatic fluid collections with surgical and nonsurgical methods. Pancreatic fluid collections (PFC) can be drained surgically or nonsurgically with endoscopic or radiologic techniques. To define subgroups of patients with PFC who would benefit from the new modalities, we reviewed a period (1977 to 1990) during which both surgical and nonsurgical invasive techniques were available. Patients with phlegmon or necrosis at initial diagnosis were excluded. Sixty-five patients (35 male, 30 female) underwent 1 or more drainage procedures. A mean postprocedure follow-up of 10.2 months was available for 59 patients. Initial management was nonsurgical in 80% of patients. Procedures in patients with follow-up comprised invasive nonsurgical drainage (n = 25), invasive nonsurgical drainage plus surgery (n = 22), and surgery only (n = 12). Results for each group, respectively, were: morbidity, 20%, 20%, and 24%; mortality, 8%, 5%, and 0%; and successful drainage, 92%, 82%, and 83%. The choice of management appeared to be based on etiology and radiologic characteristics. Patients with nonalcohol- and nonbiliary-associated pancreatitis without a radiographically defined wall were more common in the invasive nonsurgical group and were successfully treated without surgery. Nonsurgical invasive techniques are efficacious in the treatment of PFC in this subgroup of patients. 
Seromuscular enterocystoplasty in rats. Enterocystoplasty is commonly used in clinical practice. Many of its undesirable effects, that is infections, stones, mucus production, absorption of urinary components into the blood stream and risk of cancer, result from the intestinal mucosa lining the urinary tract. We report on the feasibility of creating an enterocytoplasty with a seromuscular colonic segment that acquires a transitional epithelial lining. Augmentation enterocystoplasty was performed in 51 male, 500 gm., Sprague-Dawley rats with a 1.82 cm.2 patch of left colon from which the mucosa had been stripped. The serosal surface was used as lining for the enterocystoplasty. The intestinal patch and the bladder capacity at known pressure were measured at operation and at sacrifice. The histology of the enterocystoplasty was studied in detail following sacrifice. Of the animals 40 survived without significant complications and were sacrificed at a mean postoperative time of 30 days (range 5 to 80 days). In the remaining 11 rats a bladder stone developed but it did not seem to affect the outcome of the experiment. The size of the patch could be measured in 22 rats: it was 1.82 cm.2 (standard deviation +/- 0.86) at operation and 2.30 cm.2 (standard deviation +/- 1.1) at sacrifice. In none of the rats did the patch decrease in size. The bladder capacity at a known pressure (mean 17 cm. water) could be measured in 26 animals: it was 2.35 ml. (standard deviation +/- 0.65) at operation and 5.18 ml. (standard deviation +/- 1.19) at sacrifice. Histological analysis was done in 40 rats. In all cases the serosal surface was lined with transitional epithelium, there was no fibrosis or inflammation and the structure of the muscular layer of the bowel remained intact. The earliest growth of uroepithelium in the serosal surface of the bowel was noted at 5 days. This model suggests that the seromuscular enterocystoplasty can be constructed successfully in the rat model. The seromuscular intestinal patch does not shrink. The bladder capacity increases and histology shows a uroepithelial lining of the augmentation. 
Obesity: types and treatments. Causes of obesity include a low resting metabolic rate, environmental factors, family behavior patterns, a poorly developed satiety response and reactive eating due to stress or anxiety. Morbid obesity is characterized by an increased number of adipocytes and a degree of irreversibility. Overeating increases the size of adipocytes; however, once adipocytes achieve their maximal size, proliferation is induced and massive, irreversible obesity may result. A syndrome of restrained eating produced by chronic dieting leads to hunger, frustration and rebound overeating. Treatment may be unsuccessful because of the failure to address specific causes of obesity in individual patients and the use of reducing regimens that are not designed to maintain weight loss. Recognition of the diverse clinical forms of obesity and their different etiologies permits treatment regimens to be more specific, increasing the likelihood of success. Even with this approach, treatment failure is common. 
Transmembrane domain length variation in the evolution of major histocompatibility complex class I genes. The fifth exons of major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I genes encode a transmembrane domain (TM) that is largely responsible for class I antigen cell-surface expression usually through conventional hydrophobic amino acid-membrane interactions or, less often, through phosphatidylinositol linkage. In this report we show that Peromyscus leucopus, a Cricetidae rodent, has MHC class I genes (Pele-A genes) encoding three distinct sizes of TMs. Increases in TM lengths were due to tandem duplications of sequences similar to human hypervariable minisatellite repeats and the lambda chi site. We discerned remnants of a similar duplication event in comparable rodent and primate MHC class I genes. Furthermore, several duplications and deletions appear to have occurred independently in H-2, RT1, Pele-A, and ChLA genes in near-identical positions. Accumulated data suggests that sequences in the fifth exon of MHC class I genes may, therefore, constitute a mutational or recombinational hot spot that is mediated by minisatellite- and chi-like sequences imbedded within the coding region. The MHC class I genes may thus have recruited "selfish" DNA in their evolution to encode cell surface proteins. Expression of Pele-A genes was examined by the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using oligonucleotide primers specific for exon 4 and 5 sequences. The PCR product sizes indicated that genes encoding each TM domain length are ubiquitously transcribed. 
The use of FDG-PET in the detection and management of malignant lymphoma: correlation of uptake with prognosis. Twenty-one patients with untreated malignant lymphoma in the head and neck region were evaluated with positron emission tomography (PET) using fluorine-18-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) and gallium-67 SPECT imaging. Tumor-to-normal soft-tissue contrast ratios (TCRs) obtained 60 min after injection of FDG were higher than 2.6, and all malignant lymphomas were clearly visualized. In patients with poor prognosis, higher TCRs and glucose utilization rates (GURs) were observed, whereas low TCR and GUR were shown in a patient with low-grade malignancy. In comparison with 67Ga scintigraphy, patients with high TCRs and GURs were likely to show increased accumulation of gallium-67, but accumulation of gallium-67 was not increased as much as FDG in poor prognostic patients. FDG-PET may be useful in the detection and management of malignant lymphoma. 
Campylobacter enteritis--New Zealand, 1990. In August-September 1990, an outbreak of Campylobacter enteritis occurred at a camp near Christchurch, New Zealand. This report provides a preliminary summary of the investigation of this outbreak by the New Zealand Communicable Disease Centre and the Canterbury Area Health Board. 
Usefulness of transesophageal echocardiography in the diagnosis of conditions mimicking aortic dissection. Between September 1987 and April 1989, forty patients suspected to have aortic dissection were evaluated by transesophageal echocardiography. Aortic dissection was identified in 18 patients. This study evaluated the ability of transesophageal echocardiography in the assessment of the 22 patients in whom aortic dissection was not found. A range of pathologic conditions was diagnosed in these patients. Five patients had ischemic heart disease when they were initially seen. Among the remaining 17 only one patient had a normal aorta. Aortic disease was present in the other 16 patients with aortic dilatation in 10. Atheromas were detected in seven patients with concomitant aortic dilatation in five of them. An extrinsic aortic mass was present in two patients. Transesophageal echocardiography correctly identified an anastomotic leak at the site of left coronary artery implantation in a patient with a recent Bentall procedure, and a large mobile clot within the proximal descending aorta in a patient with blunt chest trauma. These findings obviated the need for other tests in 15 patients and led to surgery in four with no ancillary tests performed in three of them. Thus transesophageal echocardiography has an important role in assessing patients with suspected dissection. Aortic disease is common even in patients in whom aortic dissection is excluded, and some of the conditions can be just as life-threatening as dissection. Transesophageal echocardiography not only reliably identifies dissection but can also detect luminal and extraluminal diseases not adequately visualized by other modalities. 
Dispersion of refractoriness in canine ventricular myocardium. Effects of sympathetic stimulation. In 18 dogs on total cardiopulmonary bypass, the average interval between local activations during artificially induced ventricular fibrillation (VF interval) was measured from extracellular electrograms, simultaneously recorded from up to 32 ventricular sites. VF intervals were used as an index of local refractoriness, based on the assumption that during ventricular fibrillation, cells are reexcited as soon as they have recovered their excitability. In support of this, microelectrode recordings in two hearts during ventricular fibrillation did not show a diastolic interval between successive action potentials. Refractory periods determined at a basic cycle length of 300 msec with the extrastimulus method correlated well with VF intervals measured at the same sites. Thus, this technique allows assessment of spatial dispersion of refractoriness during brief interventions such as sympathetic stimulation. The responses to left, right, and combined stellate ganglion stimulation varied substantially among individual hearts. This was observed both in dogs with an intact (n = 12) and decentralized (n = 6) autonomic nervous system. Individual ventricular sites could show effects of both left and right stellate ganglion stimulation (42% of tested sites) or show effects of left-sided stimulation only (31%) or right-sided stimulation only (14%). In 13% of sites, no effects of stellate stimulation were observed. Apart from these regional effects, the responses could be qualitatively different; that is, within the same heart, the VF interval prolonged at one site but shortened at another in response to the same intervention, although shortening was the general effect and prolongation the exception. Whenever sites responded to stellate ganglion stimulation with a shortening of VF interval, this shortening was approximately 10% for left, right, or combined stimulation, whether the autonomic nervous system was intact or decentralized. In six of 12 hearts in the intact group, there was a distinct regional effect of left stellate ganglion stimulation; in the other six hearts, the effects were distributed homogeneously over the ventricles. In three hearts, the effect of left stellate ganglion stimulation was strongest in the posterior wall, and in the other three hearts, in the anterior wall. The effects of right stellate ganglion stimulation were restricted to the anterior or lateral part of the left ventricle. Dispersion of VF intervals increased after left and combined stellate ganglion stimulation in the intact group and after right stellate ganglion stimulation in the decentralized group, but not significantly in every heart. This points to a marked individual variation with regard to the effects of sympathetic stimulation on electrophysiological properties of the heart. 
Depressed contractile function due to canine mitral regurgitation improves after correction of the volume overload [published erratum appears in J Clin Invest 1991 Aug;88(2):723] It is known that long-standing volume overload on the left ventricle due to mitral regurgitation eventually leads to contractile dysfunction. However, it is unknown whether or not correction of the volume overload can lead to recovery of contractility. In this study we tested the hypothesis that depressed contractile function due to volume overload in mitral regurgitation could return toward normal after mitral valve replacement. Using a canine model of mitral regurgitation which is known to produce contractile dysfunction, we examined contractile function longitudinally in seven dogs at baseline, after 3 mo of mitral regurgitation, 1 mo after mitral valve replacement, and 3 mo after mitral valve replacement. After 3 mo of mitral regurgitation (regurgitant fraction 0.62 +/- 0.04), end-diastolic volume had nearly doubled from 68 +/- 6.8 to 123 +/- 12.1 ml (P less than 0.05). All five indices of contractile function which we examined were depressed. For instance, maximum fiber elastance (EmaxF) obtained by assessment of time-varying elastance decreased from 5.95 +/- 0.71 to 2.25 +/- 0.18 (P less than 0.05). The end-systolic stiffness constant (k) was also depressed from 4.2 +/- 0.4 to 2.1 +/- 0.3. 3 mo after mitral valve replacement all indexes of contractile function had returned to or toward normal (e.g., EmaxF 3.65 +/- 0.21 and k 4.2 +/- 0.3). We conclude that previously depressed contractile function due to volume overload can improve after correction of the overload. 
Septic shock. Septic shock (SS) is the most common type of shock encountered by internists, and its prevalence appears to be increasing. SS complicates all types of infections. The hemodynamic characteristics of SS include a low systemic vascular resistance and an elevated, but relatively inadequate, cardiac output. A cardiomyopathy frequently occurs. The major endogenous mediator of SS is tumor necrosis factor, and interleukins-1 and -2 may also contribute. Important secondary phenomena include release of platelet activating factor, vasodilator prostaglandins, and upregulation of adhesion molecules on polymorphonuclear leukocytes and endothelial cells. Current therapy is often ineffectual, and potentially promising new therapeutic approaches are reviewed. 
Clinical indications for cervical spine radiographs in alert trauma patients. Cervical spine fracture/dislocation is a potentially devastating injury that may be clinically difficult to diagnose. Therefore, a vast majority of trauma patients undergo cervical spine X rays when only a relatively small number of them will actually have a cervical spine injury. Because of the costly overuse of radiography, studies have been undertaken to define high yield criteria for evaluation of patients. This study examined the characteristics of acute cervical spine fracture/dislocation in alert trauma patients. Of 79 patients with this discharge diagnosis at St. Elizabeth Hospital Medical Center between 1982 and 1987, 47 met the criteria of Class I level of consciousness. All 47 patients complained of neck pain or demonstrated cervical tenderness to palpation. Other parameters (such as loss of consciousness, paresthesias, decreased sensation, weakness, cervical muscle spasm, decreased anal tone, and associated injuries) did not, individually or in combination with each other, consistently predict cervical spine injury. Although occult or painless cervical spine injuries have been reported in the literature, a careful review of these cases revealed that these injuries were not truly asymptomatic. Our study suggests that selected patients can be excluded from radiologic evaluation of the cervical spine. However, large prospective studies are needed to validate this finding. 
Pacemaker failure on induction of anaesthesia. A patient with a permanent pacemaker presented for repair of a strangulated hernia. During induction of anaesthesia, the pacemaker generator stopped discharging, thus causing cardiac arrest. The likely cause of the generator failure was inhibition by suxamethonium-induced muscle fasciculations. Following defibrillation, and increase in stimulation threshold necessitated urgent insertion of a transvenous pacing system. It is suggested that, when suxamethonium is to be used in a patient with a permanent pacemaker, consideration should be given to reprogramming the pacemaker to asynchronous mode before induction of anaesthesia. If a patient with a pacemaker requires defibrillation, an acute increase in stimulation threshold may result and cause loss of capture. Rapid insertion of a transvenous pacing system may be necessary. 
Shock wave-induced pancreatic trauma. A case is described of the appearance of a pancreatic or peripancreatic lesion after left renal calculus fragmentation by extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy (ESWL). Its anatomical location and subsequent disappearance suggest it was related to trauma caused by the shock waves. The brief literature on pancreatic injury after ESWL is reviewed, and the role of the patient's underlying liver disease in the genesis of this complication is discussed. 
Different types of skew deviation. Although all manifest skew deviations appear the same for the clinician, skew deviation can result from different combinations of dysconjugate vertical ocular deviations. Evidence is presented for three different types of skew deviation when it occurs as a feature of an ocular tilt reaction. In type 1 (utricle) there is upward deviation of both eyes with different amplitudes, as described for otolith Tullio phenomenon in humans. In Type 2 (dorsolateral medulla oblongata) hypertropia of one eye occurs while the other eye remains in the primary position, the hypothetical mechanism of skew deviation in Wallenberg's syndrome. In Type 3 (midbrain tegmentum) there is simultaneous hypertropia of one eye and hypotropia of the other eye, as described for electrical stimulation of midbrain tegmentum in monkeys and observed in clinical cases with a paroxysmal ocular tilt reaction. 
Effect of P6 acupressure on postoperative vomiting in children undergoing outpatient strabismus correction. A prospective, double-blind study was conducted to compare the effect of pressure at the P6 (Neikuan) point with placebo as an antiemetic in children. Sixty-six patients, ages 3-12 yr, undergoing outpatient surgery for correction of strabismus, were allocated randomly to receive either bilateral P6 acupressure or placebo during the perioperative period. The study was designed to detect a 50% difference in the incidence of postoperative vomiting between the two groups, with a 90% power of achieving a statistically significant result at the 5% level (two-tailed). The incidence of postoperative vomiting for the placebo group was 58% before discharge from hospital, 73% at home and 82% in the first 24 h after surgery. The corresponding results for the acupressure group were 58% before discharge, 71% at home and 94% in the first 24 h. These differences were not significant; P6 acupressure did not reduce the incidence of postoperative vomiting in children undergoing strabismus surgery. 
Prognosis for recovery from prolonged posttraumatic unawareness: logistic analysis. This study reviews the course and outcome of 130 patients who remained in a state of prolonged unawareness 30 days after severe cranio-cerebral trauma. Prognostic indicators and outcome were fitted by a logistic model. The significant prognostic factors observable in the first week after trauma were found to be ventilatory status, motor reactivity and significant extraneural trauma. The significant prognostic factors after the first month of unawareness were early ventilatory status, early motor reactivity, late epilepsy and hydrocephalus. The estimated probability of recovery of awareness (that is, consciousness) ranged from 0.94 in patients with early decorticate posturing in the absence of both extraneural trauma and ventilatory disturbance to 0.06 in patients with flaccidity, extraneural trauma and ventilatory disturbance in the first week after injury. 
Coronary artery thrombolysis: comparison of approved agents. Three agents approved for the lysis of thrombi in coronary arteries--alteplase, anistreplase and streptokinase--have undergone critical clinical experimental trials in Europe and the United States. Global comparison of their efficacy shows that alteplase is slightly more effective (71 percent) in restoring patency than anistreplase (60 percent) and streptokinase (58 percent). Streptokinase and anistreplase are allergenic, and repeat administration is not feasible in the short-term, a distinct advantage for alteplase. More accurate dosing of thrombolytic agents and skillful use of aspirin and heparin improve the efficacy of thrombolytic therapy but can also increase the risk of bleeding. A recanalization rate of 90 percent or more could be achieved if the thrombolytic agent is administered within the first hour after thrombosis. Administration this soon after the development of thrombosis may be possible if the agent is given outside the hospital by practicing physicians or, perhaps, paramedics. 
Preoperative prediction of pathological tumor volume and stage in clinically localized prostate cancer: comparison of digital rectal examination, transrectal ultrasonography and magnetic resonance imaging. Accurate preoperative staging is important for proper selection of patients for radical retropubic prostatectomy. Preoperative staging by digital rectal examination, transrectal ultrasound, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), Gleason grade and prostate specific antigen was compared to pathological stage for 25 patients who underwent radical retropubic prostatectomy. The predictive value for tumor confinement was 36% by rectal examination, 37% by ultrasound and 30% by MRI. The predictive value for extracapsular disease was 100% by rectal examination, 83% by ultrasound and 66% by MRI. Preoperative determinations of tumor volume by any modality did not correlate with pathological tumor volume. Digital rectal examination, ultrasound and MRI clinically understage the disease in most patients but they may be reliable to predict extracapsular disease. 
Sublaminar fixation in lumbosacral fusions. Sublaminar fixation to stainless steel rectangles was employed in an effort to improve the fusion rate in lumbar and lumbosacral arthrodesis. Thirty-seven patients had spondylolisthesis, and 26 had other causes of pain secondary to lumbar mechanical instability. Of the 63 patients, 53 achieved fusion and 52 had relief of pain. No infections or neurologic complications were encountered. This fusion rate of 84% does not significantly differ from rates obtained with noninstrumented methods, and this construct is no longer used for lumbar fusions. 
Leber's hereditary optic neuropathy and Kearns-Sayre syndrome: mitochondrial DNA mutations. Mitochondrial DNA (mt DNA) supplies extranuclear (cytoplasmic) genes which program the manufacture of 13 of the 67 peptides of the mitochondrial respiratory enzymes. The remaining 54 are coded by nuclear DNA. All human children and adults, male and female, are entirely dependent on the cytoplasm of the ovum for their complement of mt DNA; the sperm contributes none. Accordingly, mutations in the mt DNA in a mother's ova will be passed on to all her children, although not all are clinically affected. Leber's hereditary optic neuropathy is in most cases due to a mutation that leads to the replacement of guanine by adenine at position 11778 in mt DNA. This causes histidine to be inserted instead of the normal arginine at the site of the 340th amino acid in the respiratory enzyme NADH subunit 4, hence its defective function. Other point mutations in the mt DNA coding for polypeptides of the respiratory chain complex or controlling sequences coded by mt DNA have been found in other families with Leber's hereditary optic neuropathy. Mitochondrial DNA is the site of other mutations as well. For ophthalmologists, the most important of these is the rare Kearns-Sayre syndrome (pigmentary retinopathy plus muscular dystrophies, especially of the extraocular muscles). Kearns-Sayre syndrome is due to deletions in the mt DNA, which vary in size and so affect a number of different respiratory enzymes, hence the variable manifestations. Cases are usually sporadic because the disease is often so severe that affected individuals do not reproduce if they survive, but in some cases inheritance from the mother has been reported. 
Treatment of uterine leiomyomata with a luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone agonist: the possibility of nonsurgical management in selected perimenopausal women. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the efficacy of luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone agonist (LH-RH-a) in the treatment of leiomyomata. DESIGN: A retrospective randomized trial. SETTING: Hospital department of obstetrics and gynecology. PATIENTS: Twenty-five women, ages 36 to 54 years with symptomatic uterine leiomyomata, were divided into two groups according to the responsiveness to LH-RH-a: group A patients reached menopause after LH-RH-a, whereas resumption of menstruation occurred within 12 weeks after cessation of therapy in group B. INTERVENTIONS: Luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone agonist was administered intranasally three times a day with 150 micrograms insufflation of one spray in each nostril (total dose: 900 micrograms/d). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Efficacies of treatment were assessed in terms of uterine volume, hemoglobin concentrations, serum levels of luteinizing hormone (LH), follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), estradiol (E2), and bone density during and after treatment. RESULTS: In both groups, hemoglobin concentrations increased significantly after 16 weeks of treatment. A significant reduction in uterine volume was observed in both groups. After completing therapy, there was no further significant change in uterine volume in group A, whereas uterine volume in group B returned to pretreatment values. Serum LH and FSH concentrations were suppressed during treatment, but those gonadotropins in group A increased significantly up to the menopausal levels after treatment. Serum E2 concentrations in both groups showed consistent suppression by the end of the first treatment cycle. After cessation of therapy, serum E2 levels on group A remained in the castrate range, whereas E2 in group B returned to pretreatment levels, concomitant with the return of normal ovulation. CONCLUSIONS: Intranasal administration of LH-RH-a was successful in significantly decreasing uterine volume and increasing hemoglobin concentration in premenopausal women with leiomyomata. 
Expression of Tn, sialosyl Tn, and T antigens in human pancreas. Carbohydrate antigens representing some of the initial steps in mucin O-linked glycosylation were examined in specimens of normal pancreas, chronic pancreatitis, and pancreatic adenocarcinoma. Tn antigen, recognized by Vicia villosa lectin, was expressed by all specimens of normal pancreas (acinar cells) and pancreatic cancers and all but one case of chronic pancreatitis. Sialosyl Tn antigen, recognized by monoclonal antibody TKH2, was expressed in a cancer-associated fashion, being completely absent in normal pancreas but expressed by 56% of chronic pancreatitis and 97% of pancreatic cancers. T antigen, recognized by monoclonal antibody AH9-16, was expressed in 68% of normal pancreas (acinar cells), 67% of chronic pancreatitis, and 48% of pancreatic cancer tissues. These results indicate that normal acinar cells of the pancreas are capable of expressing selected carbohydrate structures associated with the initial steps of mucin glycosylation. The marked expression of sialosyl Tn compared with T antigen in pancreatic cancers suggests that with malignant transformation there is selective usage of glycosyltransferase enzymes involved in mucin oligosaccharide synthesis. 
Patterns of epithelial migration in the unaffected ear in patients with a history of unilateral cholesteatoma. Epithelial migration in a centrifugal manner is an established phenomenon in the normal human tympanic membrane. This pattern of migration is symmetrical in both ears of any one individual. We present a prospective study on the pattern of tympanic ink dot migration on the normal drum, in patients with a history of cholesteatoma in one ear. It was demonstrated that patients who develop cholesteatoma have a normal migratory pattern and rate in the unaffected ear. The conclusion from this study is that defective migration is not the initiating factor in the development of acquired cholesteatoma. 
The use of CT scanning to triage patients requiring admission following minimal head injury. Recent data have suggested that patients with both a normal cranial CT scan and normal neurologic examination following minimal head injury (MHI) have no risk of neurologic deterioration. This study prospectively examined the safety of discharging patients from the emergency department (ED) after MHI whether or not there was a responsible observer at home. MHI was defined as a history of loss of consciousness (LOC), a Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score of 14 or 15, and no focal neurologic findings. In a 4-month period 111 patients with MHI were evaluated. Fifteen (14%) patients had a CT scan which revealed an intracerebral injury; 96 patients had a normal CT scan; five patients with normal CT scans were admitted because of persistent lethargy; and one patient was admitted after his CT that demonstrated an old infarct; the remaining 90 patients were discharged. There were 71 men and 19 women with a mean age of 29 years. The mechanism of injury was assault in 55, MVA in 30, and falls in five. The initial GCS in was 15 in 79 and 14 in 11. Fifty-eight per cent of patients were intoxicated. Fifty-seven (63%) patients were successfully contacted by telephone; none had developed any neurologic symptoms. Thirty-one patients who could not be followed up gave fictitious phone numbers. These data suggest that CT can reliably triage patients who can be discharged from the ED following MHI, even in the absence of a responsible observer. Hospital admission can be avoided in more than 80% of patients sustaining MHI, better utilizing scarce hospital resources. 
Collateral circulation as a marker of the presence of viable myocardium in patients with recent myocardial infarction. The relationship between the presence of viable myocardium and the extent of coronary collateral circulation to the infarct area was evaluated in 20 patients with a recent anterior myocardial infarction who had complete obstruction of the left anterior descending coronary artery. The viability of myocardial tissue was assessed by exercise thallium-201 myocardial scintigraphy, and the collateral circulation was angiographically evaluated by means of a collateral index ranging from 0 to 3. Patients were divided into two groups according to the presence (group 1, n = 10) or absence (group 2, n = 10) of viable myocardium in the perfusion territory of the infarct-related artery. The collateral index in group 1 was 2.5 +/- 0.5 (SD), which was significantly higher than the 0.7 +/- 0.8 in group 2. These findings indicate that the presence of ischemic but viable myocardium is intimately related to the development of collateral circulation in patients with myocardial infarction, and the existence of well-developed collateral channels predicts the presence of viable myocardium in the infarct area. 
Patient dose and associated risk due to radiological investigation of the internal auditory meatus. The radiation doses and associated somatic risks due to four radiological examinations for acoustic neuromata (AN) have been investigated. These examinations were (1) plain film radiography of the internal auditory meatus (IAM), (2) computed tomography (CT) of the IAM, (3) CT of the posterior fossa and (4) CT of the IAM with air contrast. Organ dose measurements were performed using lithium fluoride thermoluminescent dosemeters loaded in a patient equivalent phantom. Dose equivalents to various organs are presented, together with the effective dose equivalent and collective effective dose equivalent for each examination. Hypothetical fatal somatic risks for each examination studied here have been estimated from the effective dose equivalents. The estimated number of hypothetical fatal cancers induced by radiological examinations for AN is between approximately 110 and 820 times lower than the number of detected AN, depending on the method of assessing the radiation dose to the remainder organs. It is concluded that in this particular study the radiological examinations are of net benefit to this group of patients. 
Hydatidiform mole and fetus with normal karyotype: support of a separate entity. Repetitive hydatidiform mole was observed in four pregnancies. The pregnancies presented with heavy bleeding and vomiting, but the post-evacuation courses were uncomplicated, with rapid regression of serum hCG levels. Cytogenetic investigations, analyses of restriction fragment length polymorphisms, and flow cytometry in three pregnancies were consistent with diploid, biparental conception as the origin of fetal tissue and molar and nonmolar villi. In one pregnancy, the analyses of cytogenetic markers suggested the coexistence of two different cell lines of dizygotic, biparental origin, whereas DNA analysis was consistent with a single conception. With incomplete genetic information, a hydatidiform mole with coexistent normal fetus is generally considered to result from dizygous twinning comprising an androgenetic complete mole and a normal conception. In the present gestations, the results based on several techniques applied on numerous samples from different tissues render this possibility unlikely. Some of the contradictions between histologic and cytogenetic classifications of hydatidiform mole may be explained by diploid, biparental partial mole, which seems to constitute a separate subgroup within hydatidiform mole. Following chorionic villus sampling or amniocentesis, continued pregnancy may be considered, depending on prenatal diagnosis including genetic marker analysis. 
Phenothiazine-associated apnea in two siblings. A two-month-old white girl presented to our facility with increasing lethargy and new onset apnea and bradycardia following a week of upper respiratory tract infection symptoms. The patient had been receiving a cough syrup containing promethazine hydrochloride during the previous five days, which was temporally correlated with the onset of lethargy and apneic episodes. Upon further investigation, it was discovered that the patient's older sibling also may have experienced phenothiazine-associated apnea after receiving a combination of meperidine hydrochloride, promethazine hydrochloride, and chlorpromazine as a premedication prior to an endoscopic examination. In addition to the presentation of these cases, the literature pertaining to phenothiazine-associated apnea is reviewed. 
Confirmation of endotracheal tube placement: a miniaturized infrared qualitative CO2 detector. STUDY OBJECTIVES: A miniaturized, infrared, solid-state, end-tidal CO2 detector was used to confirm emergency endotracheal tube (ETT) placement. DESIGN: This prospective, clinical study used a miniature, infrared, solid-state end-tidal CO2 detector to confirm ETT placement in an acute setting. SETTING: The ICU, emergency department, and hospital floor. TYPE OF PARTICIPANTS: There were 88 consecutive adult patients requiring 100 emergency intubations. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: The indication for airway intervention was considered urgent in 79% and under arrest conditions in 21%. The mean number of intubation attempts was 1.83 (range, one to five) with difficulty of intubation of 6.48 and confirmation of 7.75, on a linear scale from 0 (lowest) to 10 (highest). Determination of ETT position revealed intratracheal intubation in 96% and esophageal intubation in 4%. Placement was confirmed by direct visualization or radiography in all cases. Sensitivity and specificity for ETT localization was 100% (P less than .0001). CONCLUSION: This hand-held infrared capnometer reliably confirms ETT placement under emergency conditions. 
Lateral rhachotomy for thoracic spinal lesions. Capener's "Lateral Rhachotomy" was modified by additional excision of the pedicle, articular facets, part of the lamina, and a posterior half of the vertebral bodies on one side through a transpleural approach to the thoracic spine, and a retroperitoneal approach to the lumbar spine. The aim was to excise a space-occupying lesion, which exists in front of the thoracic or lumbar spinal cord, safely. This modification enable the authors to expose more than 50% of the spinal canal, and decompress it from its anterior, lateral, and posterior compressing mass. The utmost important point of this procedure is the excision of the lesion under the direct visualization of the dura. In ossification of the posterior longitudinal ligament (OPLL), the dura is usually indented by the thick bony mass, and the lesion extends over a few segment with adhesion. Using "Modified Lateral Rhachotomy," it was possible to explore three or four vertebral levels in continuity through the same skin incision. In the present report, the authors described their "Modified Lateral Rhachotomy" procedure, and reviewed the case material. 
Factor XIII subunits in relation to some other hemostatic parameters in ulcerative colitis. The hemostatic parameters, particularly with respect to F.XIII subunits, were examined in 48 untreated UC patients (22 at active and 26 at quiescent stage). UC active patients showed a significant decrease of F.XIII subunit "a," compared with healthy subjects, as well as in UC patients in remission. In contrast, the level of F.XIII subunit "b" in each group was similar. Compared with normal subjects, UC active patients revealed a significant decrease in AT III concentration, prolonged ELT, and elevated fibrinogen level. In addition, the elevated titer of SDPS test for SFMC appeared in approximately 40% of those patients. However, no strict relationship was found between the presence of positive SDPS and diminution of AT III, as well as of F.XIIII subunit "a" in active UC state. In patients in remission, AT III level and ELT were similar to those as in the control group, but fibrinogen concentration was elevated. Such constellation of hemostatic parameters may indicate a tendency to blood hypercoagulability in UC active patients, whereas, in general, these changes are not associated with the stage of remission. The present data may also suggest that F.XIII behavior pattern should be taken into account in the clinical management of UC. 
The prevalence of carcinoma in palpable vs impalpable, mammographically detected lesions. Concern over excessive numbers of false-positive mammograms, leading to unnecessary investigations and surgical interventions, has been cited as a barrier to mammographic screening for breast cancer. We compared the biopsy results from palpable vs impalpable, mammographically detected lesions from one experienced breast surgeon's practice from July 1980 through July 1989. Overall, there were 372 biopsies in 346 women. Of 143 biopsies for palpable abnormalities, 48 (34%) yielded a primary malignant lesion. The length of the palpable cancers averaged 3.7 cm (median, 2.8 cm). Sixteen (33%) of the 48 biopsies were in patients who had positive axillary lymph nodes, and five (10%) were in patients who had distant metastases at the time of biopsy. Of 229 biopsies for impalpable, mammographically detected lesions, 72 (31%) yielded a primary breast carcinoma. Excluding 34 carcinomas that had only calcifications, the length of the mammographically detected tumors averaged 2.0 cm (median, 1.5 cm). Eleven (15%) of the 72 biopsies were in patients who had positive axillary nodes, and none were in patients who had distant metastases at the time of biopsy. The positive predictive values (number of cancers detected divided by the number of biopsies recommended) were not significantly different when comparing biopsies indicated for palpable, clinically detected (34%) vs impalpable, mammographically detected (31%) abnormalities (p = .669). However, the mammographically detected cancers were smaller, more often noninvasive (32% vs 4%), less often associated with axillary metastases (15% vs 33%), and without distant metastases (0% vs 10%). 
The role of fiberoptic endoscopy in the management of corrosive ingestion and modified endoscopic classification of burns. We prospectively evaluated the role of fiberoptic esophagogastroduodenoscopy in the management of 81 patients with corrosive ingestion. A total of 381 endoscopic examinations were performed: 88 within 96 hours following corrosive ingestion, 108 between the third and ninth week, and 185 during the period of follow-up after bougie dilation of esophageal strictures. The customary endoscopic classification of burns (grades 0 to 3) was modified by subdividing grade 2 burns into 2a and 2b, and grade 3 burns into 3a and 3b for prognostic and therapeutic implications. There was no significant correlation between oropharyngeal and upper gastrointestinal tract injury. Early major complications and deaths were confined to patients with grade 3 burns. All patients with grade 0, 1, and 2a burns recovered without sequelae. The majority of patients (71.4%) with grade 2b injury and all survivors with grade 3 injury developed esophageal or gastric cicatrization, or both, which needed endoscopic or surgical treatment. There were no complications related to endoscopy. We conclude that early endoscopy is not only a safe, reliable, and accurate diagnostic tool in such patients, but also is of crucial importance in management and prognosis. 
The effect of corneal hypesthesia on the duration of proparacaine anesthetic eyedrops. The duration of action of proparacaine is known in the normal cornea but not in the hypesthetic cornea. To determine this, we examined both eyes in seven patients with documented unilateral corneal hypesthesia associated with inactive herpetic disease. Cochet-Bonnet measurements were made in both eyes before and at two- to five-minute intervals after the instillation of one drop of 0.5% proparacaine until baseline corneal sensitivity levels were again achieved. Mean recovery time was 34.86 minutes in eyes with normal corneal sensitivity, compared to 45.43 minutes in hypesthetic corneas. In all patients, the recovery time was remarkably longer in the hypesthetic eye than it was in the normal fellow eye. These data demonstrate the need to wait up to one hour after the instillation of proparacaine in eyes suspected of having corneal hypesthesia if corneal sensitivity is to be determined accurately. Additionally, the duration of action of topically instilled anesthetic may be a useful method of discovering subtle differences in corneal sensitivity. 
Absence of synergistic effects of CNS treatments on neuropsychologic test performance among children. Three hypotheses are proposed to account for neurobehavioral impairments following treatment with cranial radiation therapy (CRT) and intrathecal (IT) chemotherapy: CNS treatments exert a synergistic effect (A x B), an additive effect (A + B), or a single-agent effect (A or B). Eighty-five long-term survivors of non-CNS cancers aged 6 to 16 years were classified into groups on the basis of CNS treatments: CRT-IT (n = 25), CRT-No IT (n = 11), No CRT-IT (n = 24), and No CRT-No IT (n = 25). Study I findings did not provide support for synergistic mechanisms; nonorthogonal analysis of variance showed interaction effects (CRT x IT) restricted to tactile-perceptual speed. However, main effects were significant for a single agent (CRT) across a wide range of measures. General intelligence, academic achievement, verbal knowledge and reasoning, and perceptual-motor abilities were found to be significantly lower among CRT-treated groups. Study II findings provided additional support for the role of CRT; Pearson correlations within the CRT-No IT group indicated significant negative associations between CRT dose estimates for cortical regions and perceptual-motor abilities. 
Renal vascular lesions as a marker of poor prognosis in patients with lupus nephritis. Gruppo Italiano per lo Studio della Nefrite Lupica (GISNEL). The frequency of renal vascular lesions (RVL) and their relevance in the progression of renal damage were evaluated by the Pathology Group of the "Gruppo Italiano per lo Studio della Nefrite Lupica" (GISNEL). Of 285 patients with lupus nephritis collected from 20 nephrology centers in Italy and classified according to World Health Organization (WHO) criteria, 79 cases (27.7%) with RVL were identified and classified as follows: (1) lupus vasculopathy (n = 27); (2) hemolytic-uremic syndrome/thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (HUS/TTP) malignant hypertension-like lesions (n = 24); (3) vasculitis (n = 8); (4) arterio-arteriosclerosis (n = 20). At the time of renal biopsy, patients with RVL had mean serum creatinine levels significantly higher than patients without RVL (201.8 +/- 195.9 mumol/L [2.2 +/- 2.2 mg/dL] v 108.1 +/- 108.0 mumol/L [1.2 +/- 1.2 mg/dL]; P less than 0.01). Hypertension was more frequent in patients with RVL than in those without (68.4% v 30.5%; P less than 0.01). The probability of kidney survival assessed according to the Kaplan-Meier method at 5 and 10 years was, respectively, 74.3% +/- 5.9% and 58.0% +/- 8.9% in patients with RVL, compared with 89.6% +/- 2.7% and 85.9% +/- 3.7% in patients without RVL. However, the two groups did not differ significantly as regards overall survival, the probability of survival at 5 and 10 years being 86.5% +/- 4.5% and 78.8% +/- 6.6% in patients with RVL and 92.2% +/- 2.2% and 83.3% +/- 4.4% in patients without RVL. 
Perfusion imaging with 99mTc-sestamibi for the assessment of myocardial area at risk and the efficacy of acute treatment in myocardial infarction. There is a clear need to develop better measurement tools for assessment of the effect of acute therapy in myocardial infarction. Such tools must permit accurate measurement of the amount of myocardium that is initially at risk. 99mTc-sestamibi is a new radiopharmaceutical with unique properties that are well suited to the measurement of myocardium at risk without any delay in acute therapy. Tomographic imaging with this agent has been shown to provide accurate quantitative estimates of the myocardium at risk, which varies widely, even for patients with a similar coronary occlusion. For example, there is more than a threefold range in myocardium at risk for patients with a nonproximal occlusion of the left anterior descending coronary artery. The determination of the myocardium at risk before intervention and the change in this region after intervention constitute a promising measurement tool for the assessment of the effect of acute therapy. Initial studies with tomographic imaging have shown a significant improvement in a group of patients treated with thrombolysis, although the magnitude of improvement is highly variable in individual patients. Qualitatively similar results have been reported with planar imaging. Although it has a number of technical limitations, sequential imaging with 99mTc-sestamibi seems to have a clear advantage over those end points that have previously been used to assess acute therapy. This new measurement tool should facilitate future clinical trials of different treatments in acute myocardial infarction. 
Soft tissue sarcoma of the pleural cavity. Seventeen cases of soft tissue sarcoma (STS) developing in the pleural cavity were collected from Japanese hospitals, and their clinical and pathologic findings summarized. Eight of the 17 patients had a 15-year to 50-year (mean, 28.8) history of chronic pleural inflammatory disease (pleuritis, pyothorax, and pulmonary tuberculosis) before the onset of the pleural sarcoma. Histologically, malignant fibrous histiocytoma was the most common tumor type (11 cases), followed by angiosarcoma (four). The age at diagnosis of the sarcoma ranged from 15 to 74 years (mean, 58); the male-to-female ratio was 3.3:1. In the eight cases of sarcoma associated with chronic pleural inflammatory disease, male preponderance was more marked (7:1). The commonest presenting symptom was chest pain. A mass could be detected by chest roentgenograms in 13 patients and computed tomographic scans in 15 patients. No patient had distant metastases at first admission. Thirteen patients were treated by surgery, chemotherapy, and/or radiation therapy. Thirteen of the 17 patients died 1 to 87 months (mean, 14.2) after therapy for STS. The actuarial 1-year survival rate was 38.5%. These findings suggest that long-standing pleural inflammation might be an etiologic factor for development of pleural STS. 
Endoscopic assessment of mucosal hemodynamic changes in a canine model of gastric ulcer. In studying the side effects of sclerosants injected into the gastric submucosa in dogs (N = 7), we noted that 3 ml of absolute ethanol induced a large gastric ulceration. We describe the time course of change in the ulcer size, and suggest that such ulceration can be used for the endoscopic assessment of factors important in ulcer genesis and healing. Endoscopic reflectance spectrophotometric measurement of indices of mucosal hemoglobin concentration (IHB) and oxygen saturation (ISO2) were performed in a separate group of dogs (N = 4) with ethanol-induced gastric ulceration. We found a significant difference (p less than 0.05) in IHB and ISO2 immediately before (97 +/- 8 and 37 +/- 3, respectively) and after (138 +/- 7 and 21 +/- 5, respectively) the ethanol injection. At 24 hours after the ethanol injection, the IHB at the lesion margin (141 +/- 14) was significantly higher (p less than 0.05) than that at the adjacent mucosa (101 +/- 4), whereas the ISO2 measurements were not significantly different in these two locations, 34 +/- 2 and 31 +/- 2, respectively. We conclude that (1) injection of 3 mol of absolute ethanol into the submucosa of the canine stomach provides an animal model of gastric ulceration in which the ulcer can be examined repeatedly with the aid of the endoscope; (2) in this ulcer model, ischemia with congestion (increases IHB, decreases ISO2) precedes the development of gross mucosal ulcerations; and (3) the margin of the established ulceration in this model exhibits hyperemia (increases IHB, normal ISO2) which mimics that of a healing gastric ulcer. 
Orbital lesions with granulomatous inflammation. Orbital lesions characterized by granulomatous inflammation are a heterogeneous group of diseases of various causes with a common histopathological substrate involving aggregates of epithelioid cells. Forty-one patients (27 females and 14 males) with biopsy-proven granulomatous inflammation were seen at an orbital clinic between 1978 and 1989. The mean age at presentation was 40.2 (extremes 6 and 77) years. Two main clinical presentations were noted: painless, subacute or chronic mass effect, and tender, subacute inflammatory process. Six patients had secondary features that were infiltrative in character. The lesions were primarily located in the anterior superior orbit. In nearly half the patients the granulomatous reaction was confined to the orbit (predominantly ruptured dermoid and localized orbital sarcoid), and the remainder had either regional involvement (Wegener's granulomatosis or fibro-osseous process) or systemic involvement (sarcoidosis). 
Felbamate: a clinical trial for complex partial seizures. We performed a randomized, double-blind, three-period cross-over study of felbamate (FBM, 2-phenyl-1,3-propanediol dicarbamate: Carter-Wallace 554) in patients with complex partial seizures. Patients continued carbamazepine (CBZ) throughout the study and were observed in the hospital for the entire trial period. The entry criteria required at least six seizures in a 3-week baseline period (and no more than 1 week with a single seizure) with CBZ alone. Thirty subjects were randomized. Two left the study after randomization, 1 owing to seizure exacerbation, and 1 owing to hyponatremia, which may have been related to CBZ therapy. The daily dosage of 50 mg/kg (maximum 3,000 mg) FBM per day was well tolerated by all 28 patients who completed the study. Only mild adverse experience were observed during the trial. FBM reduced CBZ level (p less than 0.0001; 95% confidence interval -28%, -20%). There was no significant difference in seizure frequency between placebo and FBM periods (one-sided p = 0.172), but when a correction was made for the lower CBZ level noted during FBM periods, the data suggested a strong antiseizure effect of FBM. 
Cytokine-endothelial interactions in inflammation, immunity, and vascular injury. This paper reviews the evidence that cytokines induce a variety of functional and structural alterations in endothelium and that cytokine-endothelial interactions play important roles in the evolution of inflammatory and immune responses. The effect of cytokines, particularly interleukin-1 and tumor necrosis factor, on leukocyte-endothelial adhesion has led to the discovery of several endothelial adhesion molecules, and the molecular and biological characteristics of these are described. Finally, the review discusses the possible contribution of cytokine-induced activation to vascular injury in such pathological processes as septic shock, the Shwartzman reaction, delayed hypersensitivity, and immune-mediated vasculitis. 
Pontine myelinolysis after correction of hyponatremia during burn resuscitation. Central pontine myelinolysis is a neurologic disease produced by the rapid correction of hyponatremia. This report describes the occurrence of central pontine myelinolysis in a patient with burns. The natural history of this paralyzing condition and suggestions for its prevention are discussed. Severely burned and hyponatremic patients are at risk for this disorder because a large amount of sodium ion is typically required for the treatment of burn shock. Awareness of this phenomenon and avoidance of rapid correction of hyponatremia are essential to its prevention. 
Endoscopic palliation of tracheobronchial malignancies. The prognosis for tracheobronchial tumours remains poor. Most patients can be offered only palliation. When the main symptom is breathlessness or refractory haemoptysis from a large airway tumour endoscopic treatment may be very effective. Over the last decade most attention has focused on the neodymium YAG laser. This often produces dramatic effects but has some important limitations. In the last few years better techniques for stenting and intrabronchial radiotherapy (brachytherapy) have also been developed. This article discusses the range of techniques now available and aims to help clinicians decide which patients may benefit from referral to centres providing these techniques. 
Detection of Epstein-Barr virus sequences in primary brain lymphoma without immunodeficiency. We searched for Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) sequences by enzymatic DNA amplification in nine primary brain lymphomas from patients without immunodeficiency. We used seven nonlymphoma brain tumors as negative controls, and the Raji cell line as a positive control. We detected EBV DNA, using ethidium bromide-stained-agarose minigel electrophoresis and dot blot hybridization, in the positive control and in only one brain lymphoma tumor; we did not detect EBV DNA in the other tumors. The EBV-positive patient had a second B-cell monoclonal population in the peripheral blood without detectable EBV DNA, suggesting a direct role for EBV in the development of the brain lymphoma. 
Treatment-seeking behavior among those with signs and symptoms of acute myocardial infarction. Significant delays in seeking definitive treatment for the signs and symptoms of acute myocardial infarction increase morbidity and mortality. In most studies, delay times average more than 4 hours. The following variables are associated with increased delay: a medical history of angina, diabetes mellitus, or hypertension; older age; black race; seeking advice from a family member or a physician; symptom onset on a weekday; and attempts at self-treatment. Variables associated with reduced delay times are the following: pain recognized as cardiac in origin, hemodynamic instability, severe chest pain, younger age, and consultation with a coworker. Surprisingly, patients who have already experienced a myocardial infarction are just as likely to delay as patients who have not had this experience. These findings provide direction for developing and testing patient and family interventions, establishing community education programs, and reducing patient delay in response to the signs and symptoms of acute myocardial infarction. 
Cardiac tumors and the nevoid basal cell carcinoma syndrome. Nevoid basal cell carcinoma syndrome is a multisystem disease with a wide range of initial symptoms that can be seen at any age. The most characteristic features are vertebral or rib anomalies, intracranial falx calcification, multiple basal cell carcinomas, odontogenic keratocysts of the jaw, and palmar and/or plantar pits. Pediatricians need to be aware that if any one of these major anomalies is seen, this diagnosis should be considered. There now appears to be an established association between cardiac tumors and nevoid basal cell carcinoma syndrome. Primary cardiac tumors have been associated with cerebral tuberous sclerosis and neurofibromatosis, and evaluation of cardiac status is recommended when these genetically determined syndromes are diagnosed. This communication should serve to alert pediatricians to the need for complete cardiac evaluation and genetic counseling when a diagnosis of nevoid basal cell carcinoma is made. 
The surgical pathology of gastrointestinal Hodgkin's disease. The files of the National Cancer Institute were searched for all surgical specimens from the gastrointestinal (GI) tract with the diagnosis of Hodgkin's disease (HD) that were accessioned during the years 1953-1990; six patients with a histologically reconfirmed diagnosis were identified. Of these patients, four presented with GI HD and two had recurrent HD. Primary HD appeared in the stomach (three patients) and the duodenum (one patient); recurrent HD after diagnosis in a conventional nodal site appeared in the stomach (one patient) and the colon (one patient). One of the cases of primary gastric disease was a composite lymphoma consisting of HD and diffuse large cell lymphoma. In view of the rarity of GI tract involvement by HD, a diagnosis of primary GI HD should be viewed with skepticism; support for such a diagnosis may be provided by both classic histopathologic features of HD and immunostaining, but no single feature can be regarded as pathognomonic. 
Dislodgement of a vein graft thrombus by angiographic injection of native coronary artery. A case of retrograde dislodgement of thrombus in a saphenous vein graft during injection of the native right coronary artery is presented. Attention to this previously undescribed complication may allow for timely treatment with emergency surgery or thrombolysis. 
Compartment syndrome of the foot after intraarticular calcaneal fracture. Seventeen patients with a total of 21 intraarticular calcaneal fractures were examined at up to 30 days after trauma for the development of tissue pressure in the central plantar muscle compartment. Twelve patients had a significant increase in tissue pressure with values greater than 30 mmHg because of primary fracture hematoma or interstitial fluid accumulation. This increase in pressure persisted for three to five days after trauma, so that ischemic damage to the short plantar foot muscles had to be suspected. Plantar muscle scarring and claw-toe formation were observed in seven patients with a total of 11 fractures during a mean observation period of 18 months. The plantar aponeurosis, which forms the constricting fascial envelope of the plantar muscles, is the anatomic structure responsible for the compartment syndrome that may develop after calcaneal fracture. Therefore, to avoid functional deficit, plantar compartmental pressures should be regularly measured after calcaneal fracture. Significantly increased plantar tissue pressure greater than 30 mmHg should be relieved by longitudinal incision of the plantar aponeurosis, preferably by a plantar incision as soon as the diagnosis is made. 
IgM antibody to hepatitis C virus in acute and chronic hepatitis C. To assess possible role of testing for IgM-specific antibody in the diagnosis and monitoring of patients with hepatitis C, we tested sera from 14 patients with acute and 97 patients with chronic non-A, non-B hepatitis for IgG and IgM antibody to hepatitis C virus. IgG antibody to hepatitis C virus was detected in 93% of acute cases and 91% of chronic cases. Of the 101 patients with IgG antibody to hepatitis C virus, 57% had IgM antibody to hepatitis C virus. None of the 20 healthy subjects or 40 patients with acute or chronic hepatitis A or hepatitis B had IgM antibody to hepatitis C virus. At the onset of clinical symptoms in acute hepatitis C, IgG antibody to hepatitis C virus was detected in 8 (57%) and IgM antibody to hepatitis C virus in 9 of 14 patients (64%). Eventually, both IgG and IgM antibody to hepatitis C virus became detectable in 13 of 14 patients with acute hepatitis C. Seven patients with antibody to hepatitis C virus resolved the acute infection within 6 mo and all seven cleared IgM antibody to hepatitis C virus, whereas two cleared IgG antibody to hepatitis C virus. Six patients had a chronic outcome of the acute infection and IgM antibody to hepatitis C virus persisted in detectable amounts for more than 6 mo in all (mean = 15.5 mo). Among 88 patients with chronic non-A, non-B hepatitis with IgG antibody to hepatitis C virus, IgM antibody to hepatitis C virus was detected in 45 (51%). 
Emergency treatment of headache. Headache is a frequent presenting complaint in the emergency department. Once a diagnosis is established, and significant organic disease can be ruled out, relief of pain must be addressed. Referral for follow-up care and narcotic habituation is a recurrent problem for the emergency physician. This article discusses the differential diagnosis of headache, evaluation of the emergency room patient, and treatment of the patient with headache. 
Efficacy of desipramine in painful diabetic neuropathy: a placebo-controlled trial. Although amitriptyline relieves pain in many patients with painful diabetic neuropathy, side effects often preclude effective treatment. Desipramine has the least anticholinergic and sedative effects of the first generation tricyclic antidepressants. We compared a 6 week course of desipramine (mean dose, 201 mg/day) to active placebo in 20 patients with painful diabetic neuropathy in a double-blind crossover trial. Pain relief with desipramine was statistically significant in weeks 5 and 6. Eleven patients reported at least moderate relief with desipramine, compared to 2 with placebo. Pain relief tended to be greater in depressed patients, but relief was also observed in patients who did not show an antidepressant effect. We conclude that desipramine relieves pain in many patients with painful diabetic neuropathy, offering an alternative for patients unable to tolerate amitriptyline. Blockade of norepinephrine reuptake, an action shared by desipramine, amitriptyline, and other antidepressants proven effective in neuropathic pain, may mediate this analgesic effect. 
Cystoid macular edema secondary to juxtafoveolar telangiectasis in Coats' disease. A 28-year-old man with unilateral Coats' disease and cystoid macular edema secondary to juxtafoveolar telangiectasis underwent successful juxtafoveolar argon green laser photocoagulation therapy with resolution of the edema and improvement in metamorphopsia and visual acuity. Despite this success, the effect of laser therapy in these patients remains uncertain. It should be considered only after detailed discussion with the patient about the possibility of posttreatment paracentral scotomata and the alternative of a reasonable period of observation for possible spontaneous resolution of the edema. 
Hypertonic saline resuscitation: efficacy in a community-based burn unit. Many have discussed hypertonic saline for resuscitation in burned patients only to discourage its use or to emphasize it only as a research tool and not as standard resuscitation. We reviewed the records of 47 adults with burns over 20% or more of the total body surface area (TBSA) in whom hypertonic saline was used as standard resuscitation fluid in a large community burn unit. The solution consisted of sodium, 300 mEq/L, acetate, 200 mEq/L, and chloride, 100 mEq/L, with an osmolality of 600 mOsm/L. The mean TBSA burned was 37% and the mean patient age was 44.8 years. Eighteen patients (mean age 39.7 years, mean TBSA burned 27%) received hypertonic saline alone. They required an average of 75% of the Parkland calculated volume to achieve a urinary output of 1 mL/kg/hr. The mean hematocrit value over the first 48 hours was 44.2% and the mean serum sodium level was 141.6 mEq/L. Twenty-nine patients (mean age 51.8 years, mean TBSA burned 47.8%) received hypertonic saline plus colloid (albumin or fresh frozen plasma). Colloid was used in older patients with more serious burns. This group required 57% of the Parkland calculated volume to achieve a urinary output of 1 mL/kg/hr. The mean hematocrit value was 45.1% and mean sodium level was 143.8 mEq/L. The mean weight gain for both groups was 7.3% of the admission weight. None of the patients had changes in pH or renal function. All patients survived the resuscitation phase of their injury; the overall death rate was 49%. We conclude that hypertonic saline is a safe, effective means of resuscitation even in a community-based unit. It allows less fluid to be delivered for adequate resuscitation. The usual hyponatremia, hemoconcentration, and significant weight gain associated with administration of isotonic solutions was avoided. Colloid may further improve the resuscitation capabilities of hypertonic saline. 
Immediate versus deferred beta-blockade following thrombolytic therapy in patients with acute myocardial infarction. Results of the Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction (TIMI) II-B Study In the Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction (TIMI) Phase II trial, patients received intravenous recombinant tissue-type plasminogen activator (rt-PA) and were randomized to either a conservative or an invasive strategy. Within this study, the effects of immediate versus deferred beta-blocker therapy were also assessed in patients eligible for beta-blocker therapy, a group of 1,434 patients of which 720 were randomized to the immediate intravenous group and 714 to the deferred group. In the immediate intravenous group, within 2 hours of initiating rt-PA metoprolol was given (5 mg intravenously at 2-minute intervals over 6 minutes, for a total intravenous dose of 15 mg, followed by 50 mg orally every 12 hours in the first 24 hours and 100 mg orally every 12 hours thereafter). The patients assigned to the deferred group received metoprolol, 50 mg orally twice on day 6, followed by 100 mg orally twice a day thereafter. The therapy was tolerated well in both groups and the primary end point, resting global ejection fraction at hospital discharge, averaged 50.5% and was virtually identical in the two groups. The regional ventricular function was also similar in the two groups. Overall, there was no difference in mortality between the immediate intravenous and deferred groups, but in the subgroup defined as low risk there were no deaths at 6 weeks among those receiving immediate beta-blocker therapy in contrast to seven deaths among those in whom beta-blocker therapy was deferred. These findings for a secondary end point in a subgroup were not considered sufficient to warrant a recommendation regarding clinical use. There was a lower incidence of reinfarction (2.7% versus 5.1%, p = 0.02) and recurrent chest pain (18.8% versus 24.1%, p less than 0.02) at 6 days in the immediate intravenous group. Thus, in appropriate postinfarction patients, beta-blockers are safe when given early after thrombolytic therapy and are associated with decreased myocardial ischemia and reinfarction in the first week but offer no benefit over late administration in improving ventricular function or reducing mortality. 
Thoracic epidural analgesia in a patient with bilateral phaeochromocytoma undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting. A patient suffering from phaeochromocytoma and coronary artery stenoses needed coronary artery bypass grafting before adrenalectomy. High thoracic epidural analgesia (T1-T2) with bupivacaine and sufentanil in combination with general anaesthesia was used. Plasma adrenaline and noradrenaline concentrations decreased during the period before bypass grafting compared to the baseline value and no important haemodynamic changes were seen during this period. Thoracic epidural analgesia failed to suppress the release of catecholamine during the bypass period. After the operation, the plasma catecholamine concentrations returned to the baseline value. Excellent analgesia (visual analogue scale = 1-2) was achieved with a postoperative epidural, but the plasma catecholamine concentration increased considerably. 
The significance of antibody to hepatitis C virus in patients with chronic hepatitis B. We assessed the prevalence and clinical significance of antibodies to hepatitis C virus among a cohort of 148 patients with chronic hepatitis B virus infection. Sixteen patients (11%) had anti-hepatitis C virus detectable by enzyme-linked immunoassay. The results from eight of these patients were positive by recombinant immunoblot assay. The results of recombinant immunoblot assay testing were not consistent; therefore the analysis of the patients' data was based on anti-hepatitis C virus enzyme-linked immunoassay results. Patients with chronic hepatitis B with anti-hepatitis C virus were more likely to be cirrhotic (44% vs. 21%) and to have decompensated liver disease (24% vs. 6%). Hepatitis B virus replication appeared to be suppressed in patients with both infections as measured by hepatitis B virus-associated DNA polymerase activity (mean = 2,055 vs. 2,555 cpm). Human immunodeficiency virus infection was more common in the anti-hepatitis C virus positive group (36% vs. 11%). Thus hepatitis C virus appears to suppress hepatitis B virus replication and to cause more severe liver disease in patients with chronic hepatitis B infection. 
Amiodarone inhibits the mitochondrial beta-oxidation of fatty acids and produces microvesicular steatosis of the liver in mice. Amiodarone has been shown to produce microvesicular steatosis of the liver in some recipients. We have determined the effects of amiodarone on the mitochondrial oxidation of fatty acids in mice. In vitro, the formation of 14C-acid-soluble beta-oxidation products from [U-14C]palmitic acid by mouse liver mitochondria was decreased by 92% in the presence of 125 microM amiodarone and by 94% in the presence of 125 microM N-desethylamiodarone. Inhibition due to 100 or 150 microM amiodarone persisted in the presence of 5 mM acetoacetate, whereas acetoacetate totally relieved inhibition due to 15 microM rotenone. In vivo, exhalation of [14C]CO2 from [U-14C]palmitic acid was decreased by 31, 40, 58 and 78%, respectively, in mice receiving 19, 25, 50 and 100 mg.kg-1 of amiodarone hydrochloride 1 hr before the administration of [U-14C]palmitic acid. One hour after 100 mg.kg-1, the exhalation of [14C]CO2 from [1-14C]palmitic acid, [1-14C]octanoic acid or [1-14C]butyric acid was decreased by 78, 72 and 53%, respectively. Exhalation of [14C]CO2 from [1-14C]palmitic acid was normal between 6 and 9 hr after administration of 100 mg.kg-1 of amiodarone hydrochloride, but was still inhibited by 71 and 37%, 24 and 48 hr after 600 mg.kg-1. Twenty four hours after the latter dose of amiodarone, hepatic triglycerides were increased by 150%, and there was microvesicular steatosis of the liver. We conclude that amiodarone inhibits the mitochondrial beta-oxidation of fatty acids and produces microvesicular steatosis of the liver in mice. 
DNA analysis of atrial myxomas. The atrial myxoma is a primary tumor of the heart which may have an uncertain clinical course. In this study, we performed flow cytometric DNA analysis of 15 paraffin-embedded atrial myxomas and correlated DNA ploidy status and proliferative fraction with clinical findings. Twelve of 15 cases (80 percent) were diploid and the remaining three cases (20 percent) were aneuploid. Two patients with aneuploid histograms were free of tumor at the time follow-up; the third patient experienced local tumor recurrence and metastases. Five patients with diploid myxomas demonstrated an elevated (greater than or equal to 17 percent) proliferative cell cycle fraction; four of these patients experienced embolic phenomenon or tumor recurrence. This pilot study suggests that an atrial myxoma with either aneuploid DNA content or elevated proliferative fraction may be associated with aggressive biologic behavior. 
Assessment of the psychological impact of a breast screening programme. In order to assess the psychological effect of mammographic screening, questionnaires (which included psychometric tests) were sent to 750 women at invitation and, 6 weeks after screening, to 420 women normal after the first mammograph, to 240 women normal after special assessment, and to 68 women normal after open biopsy. Increasing degree of the investigation was associated both with increasing frequency of breast self examination (10% were practising breast self-examination at least once a week before screening compared with 24% for women after special assessment and 35% of women who had had an open biopsy (p less than 0.001)), and with greater confidence that any malignancy in the breast would have been found. Psychometric scores showed no increase of general levels of anxiety or depression in the screened groups. For anxiety, percentages abnormal were 5, 4, 2 and 6 for the four groups, respectively, and for depression the percentages abnormal were 5, 4, 4 and 6, respectively; 10% of screened women were more anxious about having breast cancer as a result of the screening. At least 10% of women proceeding to open biopsy of benign lesions require professional counselling and support. Psychological ill effects were not detected by the psychometric test among women who did not proceed to this final investigation. Behavioural changes did suggest a raised awareness or fear of potential cancer among the screened population. 
Neurologic outcome after electroencephalographically proven neonatal seizures. Infants in whom neonatal seizures were confirmed by randomly recorded ictal electroencephalographic (EEG) tracings were retrospectively examined to determine their global neurologic outcome and the specific frequency of epilepsy, development delay, and cerebral palsy. Perinatal and postnatal clinical and EEG variables were also examined for their relevance to the neurologic outcome. Forty infants with EEG documented seizures of diverse etiologies were studied. The 27 survivors were followed up at a mean of 31 months. The outcome was unfavorable in 70%. The rate of epilepsy was 56%, of developmental delay 67%, and of cerebral palsy 63%. The etiology of seizures was an important factor influencing the outcome. Other clinical factors that showed a significant relationship with global or specific aspects of the neurologic outcome included the age at the onset of seizures, birth weight, and neurologic examination results. The EEG parameters that significantly predicted the neurologic outcome were interictal EEG background, increased seizure frequency, and decreased seizure duration. 
Sudden cardiac death: management of high-risk patients Sudden cardiac death remains a leading cause of death in the United States, accounting for more than 350,000 deaths each year, and the survival rate of victims remains low. Most survivors face a significant risk for recurrence. The typical substrate is chronic--abnormal myocardium with fibrosis (often from previous myocardial infarction) and left ventricular dysfunction. Acute triggers for sudden cardiac death are primarily electrical, ischemic, metabolic, neurohormonal, and pharmacologic. In most electrocardiographically documented cases of sudden cardiac death, the trigger-substrate interaction appears to result in ventricular tachycardia and fibrillation. After initial resuscitation, survivors need a thorough cardiovascular evaluation, including definition of coronary anatomy, left ventricular function, and wall-motion abnormalities, as well as an electrophysiologic evaluation. An attempt must be made to determine what each survivor's correctable triggers are. Management should address all reversible triggers, such as acute ischemia and electrolyte abnormalities, and should include modifying or correcting the arrhythmogenic substrate. Empiric antiarrhythmic therapy offers no advantage in such modification. Pharmacologic therapy with antiarrhythmic drugs should be guided by an objective therapeutic endpoint, which is best accomplished through the use of programmed ventricular stimulation and serial electrophysiologic studies. Other therapeutic options include surgical suppression of ventricular tachycardia and implantation of a cardioverter defibrillator. 
Serum aminoterminal propeptide of type III procollagen in psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis: relation to liver fibrosis and arthritis. Levels of serum aminoterminal propeptide of type III procollagen were measured in 170 patients with psoriasis (49% with coexistent psoriatic arthritis) who had liver biopsies performed during or before treatment with methotrexate or, in some cases, with retinoids. Psoriasis patients with fibrosis or cirrhosis in their liver biopsy specimens had a significantly higher mean serum aminoterminal propeptide of type III procollagen than did patients without fibrosis and without arthritis. Only 4% of patients without cirrhosis or fibrosis and no arthritis had an elevated serum aminoterminal propeptide of type III procollagen. In contrast, 38% of patients with psoriatic arthritis had an increased aminoterminal propeptide of type III procollagen in the absence of detectable liver fibrosis. It is concluded that the number of liver biopsies performed on methotrexate-treated psoriasis patients with or without arthritis may be reduced to a minimum as long as serum aminoterminal propeptide of type III procollagen is normal. Increased serum aminoterminal propeptide of type III procollagen in the absence of arthritis is a strong indicator of liver fibrogenesis and suggests the need for liver biopsy to monitor possible methotrexate-induced toxicity. In patients with psoriatic arthritis an increased aminoterminal propeptide of type III procollagen may be related to the joint disease. Patients with psoriatic arthritis and increased levels of aminoterminal propeptide of type III procollagen should therefore follow the established guidelines for the use of methotrexate in psoriasis. 
Delayed sleep phase syndrome response to melatonin. The actions of melatonin on the sleep-wake cycle were investigated by means of a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial in 8 subjects with a delayed sleep phase syndrome attending a sleep disorders clinic. In randomised order the subjects received placebo or melatonin 5 mg daily for 4 weeks with a 1 week washout period between the treatments. Drug or placebo was given at 2200 h, 5 h before the mean time of sleep onset determined by pretrial sleep logs. In all 8 subjects sleep onset time (mean advance 82 [range 19-124] min; p less than 0.01) and wake time (117 [10-187] min; p less than 0.01) were significantly earlier during melatonin treatment than during placebo. Mean total sleep time was slightly less on melatonin (8 h 12 min) than on placebo (8 h 46 min). Alertness acrophase calculated from the subjects' ratings of alertness made every 2 h while awake was unaltered. Melatonin may act as a phase-setter for sleep-wake cycles in subjects with a delayed sleep phase syndrome. 
Overseas fatalities of United States citizen travelers: an analysis of deaths related to international travel. STUDY OBJECTIVE: Studies of travel-related mortality and morbidity have been limited to nonfatal events. Causes of travel-related mortality may differ significantly from morbidity and thus have different prevention strategies. DESIGN: We examined the overseas fatalities of US citizen travelers for the years 1975 and 1984. The death certificates were abstracted; all deaths under age 60 and a 20% sample of deaths 60 and older were examined. SETTING AND TYPE OF PARTICIPANTS: All overseas travel fatalities of US citizens were examined excluding those occurring in Canada. INTERVENTIONS: None. RESULTS: Cardiovascular events (including myocardial infarctions and cerebrovascular accidents) and injuries accounted for 49% and 25% of the overseas deaths of US citizen travelers, respectively. Infectious diseases other than pneumonia accounted for only 1% of the deaths. Eighty percent of injury deaths occurred outside of hospitals. Injury death rates for male travelers were greater than US age-specific death rates. CONCLUSIONS: Greater emphasis on the prevention of fatal events, especially those resulting from injury, must be given by physicians and other individuals and organizations who advise travelers. Further studies are needed to explore the issues of preventable injury deaths, emergency medical services, and overseas travel. 
Twenty-four-hour blood pressure control with isradipine in mild essential hypertension. The hypotensive effect of isradipine was assessed in 26 male patients, aged 40 to 64 years, with hypertension. After withdrawal of previous antihypertensive treatment and a four-week placebo period, patients were randomized into a double-blind active-treatment period of eight weeks to receive either placebo or 1.25 to 2.5 mg isradipine twice daily. Twenty-four-hour ambulatory blood pressure was measured by Accutracker (Suntech, Oxford, England) after the placebo period and at the end of the active-treatment period. In the isradipine group n = 13), both systolic and diastolic blood pressure and number of blood pressure spikes decreased significantly (P less than .0001), whereas there was a significant increase of these variables in the placebo control group (n = 13). The results of this study indicate that, in these subjects, blood pressure control was achieved throughout the 24-h period by monotherapy with isradipine. 
Damage to tissue defenses by EMLA cream. EMLA is a new topical agent that safely anesthetizes intact skin. The purpose of this study was to determine if this cream could be safely used for anesthetizing wounds. This investigation evaluated the potential toxicity of EMLA cream in wounds by measuring its effect on host defenses and on the biology of wound repair. In contaminated wounds, EMLA cream elicited an exaggerated inflammatory response that damaged host defenses, inviting the development of infection. As a result of these investigations, we do not recommend the use of EMLA cream in wounds. 
Carotid cavernous fistula after minimal facial trauma. Report of a case. The carotid cavernous fistula has historically been associated with extensive facial trauma as a result of direct or indirect forces. Most fistulas of traumatic origin develop as a result of a fracture through the base of the skull, which produces a force causing laceration of the internal carotid artery in the region where it approximates the cavernous sinus. We report a case in which apparently minimal head trauma resulted in the development of a carotid cavernous fistula. The rather innocuous presentation of this complication requires particular attention by the caregiver in assessing the patient sustaining maxillofacial trauma. 
Ethnic differences in mortality from ischaemic heart disease and cerebrovascular disease in England and Wales. OBJECTIVE--To examine mortality from ischaemic heart disease and cerebrovascular disease in England and Wales by country of birth of the deceased. DESIGN--Standardised mortality ratios were computed by country of birth groups for ischaemic heart disease and cerebrovascular disease for 1979-83 and 1970-2 by using the five year age-sex specific rates for England and Wales for 1979-83 as standard. SETTING--England and Wales 1970-2 and 1979-83. RESULTS--In 1979-83 mortality from ischaemic heart disease was highest in men and women born in the Indian subcontinent (standardised mortality ratio 136 and 146 respectively). Young Indian men suffered the greatest excess (313 at ages 20-29). Other groups with raised mortality included Irish, Scottish, and Polish born immigrants. Those born in the Caribbean, the old Commonwealth, west Europe, and the United States had low death rates. In England and Wales mortality from ischaemic heart disease declined by 5% in men and 1% in women between 1970-2 and 1979-83, with greatest percentage declines in immigrants born in the United States, South Africa, the old Commonwealth, the Caribbean, and France. immigrant groups with raised mortality in the earlier period showed little improvement, and mortality from ischaemic heart disease increased among Indians (6% in men and 13% in women). In 1979-83 mortality from cerebrovascular disease was highest in Caribbeans (standardised mortality ratios 176 in men and 210 in women), followed by Africans, Indians, and Irish. Rates were low in west Europeans. Mortality from stroke declined by 28% overall in this period, a rate of decline shared by most groups. Men from the Indian subcontinent showed a decline of only 3%. CONCLUSION--In the 1980s mortality from ischaemic heart disease and cerebrovascular disease differed significantly between ethnic groups in England and Wales. In general, ethnic groups that experienced lower mortality from ischaemic heart disease in the 1970s showed the greatest improvement over the following decade. 
Effect of exercise supplementation on dipyridamole thallium-201 image quality To determine the effect of different types of exercise supplementation on dipyridamole thallium image quality, 78 patients were prospectively randomized to one of three protocols: dipyridamole infusion alone, dipyridamole supplemented with isometric handgrip, and dipyridamole with low-level treadmill exercise. Heart-to-lung, heart-to-liver, and heart-to-adjacent infradiaphragmatic activity ratios were generated from anterior images acquired immediately following the test. Additionally, heart-to-total infradiaphragmatic activity was graded semiquantitatively. Results showed a significantly higher ratio of heart to subdiaphragmatic activity in the treadmill group as compared with dipyridamole alone (p less than 0.001) and dipyridamole supplemented with isometric handgrip exercise (p less than 0.001). No significant difference was observed between patients receiving the dipyridamole infusion, and dipyridamole supplemented with isometric handgrip exercise. We conclude that low-level treadmill exercise supplementation of dipyridamole infusion is an effective means of improving image quality. Supplementation with isometric handgrip does not improve image quality over dipyridamole alone. 
Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease in a patient with a cadaveric dural graft. We report a 26-year-old woman with Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD) who had received cadaveric dural material 33 months before the onset of neurologic symptoms. This is the fourth case in which a dural graft was the putative source of the CJD agent. All four cases had the grafting before changes in the sterilization procedure adopted in 1987 to inactivate the CJD agent. 
Mammographic follow-up of nonpalpable low-suspicion breast abnormalities: one versus two views. A retrospective study involving 498 women with a total of 666 breast lesions was undertaken to determine the relative efficacy of one- and two-view mammography in the follow-up evaluation of "low-suspicion" abnormal mammographic findings. These abnormalities consisted of well-defined masses (47.1%), well-defined punctate microcalcifications (20.9%), and parenchymal asymmetry (32.0%). Confidence in the adequacy of the single-view follow-up was high in 91% of cases. The addition of the second mammographic view changed the one-view interpretation in approximately 1% of all cases. Two cancers were detected during the initial follow-up period. Both cancers were detected with single-view and standard two-view follow-up examinations, with high confidence. In this controlled retrospective study, the single-view follow-up examination was adequate for follow-up of most low-suspicion mammographic abnormalities. Monitoring by physicians, however, would be necessary to prevent an unacceptable number of patient recalls, which could make the one-view follow-up study impractical to use in some practices. 
The "two week syndrome" associated with injection treatment for chronic pain--fact or fiction? Many patients attending the pain clinic for regular injections of local anaesthetic state that the pain returned "two weeks" ago. This study demonstrates that 85% of these patients have a "return of pain" interval which coincides with the proximity of their next clinic appointment. 
Choledochal cyst and biliary atresia in the neonate: imaging findings in five cases. The radiologic findings in five neonates with choledochal cyst associated with extra-hepatic biliary atresia are described. All five patients (age range, 13-72 days) presented with jaundice and acholic stools. In all four patients who underwent sonographic examination, a cystic structure separate from the gallbladder representing the choledochal cyst was shown. The diagnosis of atresia of the distal common bile duct was made preoperatively in all cases by hepatobiliary scintigraphy. Diagnosis was confirmed by surgical findings and was demonstrated by intraoperative cholangiography in four cases. All patients were successfully treated with surgical intervention within 1 month from the time of diagnosis. Early detection of this rare disorder, which may be distinct from choledochal cyst found in children and adults, is important to prevent fatal complications of biliary obstruction. The combined use of sonography and hepatobiliary scintigraphy can correctly identify this subset of patients with persistent neonatal jaundice and provide valuable information for prompt surgical management. 
Regional changes in hemodynamics and cardiac myocyte size in rats with aortocaval fistulas. 1. Developing and established hypertrophy. The effects of a large arteriovenous fistula on left and right ventricular hemodynamics and cardiac myocyte size were examined in adult rats at 1 week and 1 month after surgery. Cardiac output, left ventricular function, and right ventricular function were evaluated before obtaining isolated myocytes for cell size measurements. Average heart weight increased 35% at 1 week and 86% at 1 month in rats with fistulas. In general, myocyte hypertrophy was due to a proportional increase in length and width (length/width ratio remained constant). This change was more evident in the large hearts from rats with 1-month fistulas. At both the 1-week and 1-month intervals, the hypertrophic response of right ventricular myocytes was slightly greater than that observed in the left ventricle or interventricular septum. Left ventricular systolic pressure and dP/dtmax were significantly reduced at 1 week but returned to normal after 1 month of overloading. Left ventricular end-diastolic pressure was increased approximately fivefold and twofold at 1 week and 1 month, respectively. Right ventricular systolic pressure and dP/dtmax were increased at both intervals examined. We conclude that severe volume overloading from a large aortocaval fistula in the rat is characterized by 1) depressed left ventricular function at 1 week followed by a large compensatory hypertrophy and near normal function at 1 month, 2) right ventricular pressure overload, and 3) changes in myocyte shape that resemble normal physiological growth. 
Initial clinical trial of EXOSURF, a protein-free synthetic surfactant, for the prophylaxis and early treatment of hyaline membrane disease. EXOSURF is a protein-free surfactant composed of 85% dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine, 9% hexadecanol, and 6% tyloxapol by weight. A single dose of 5 mL of EXOSURF per kilogram body weight, which gave 67 mg of dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine per kilogram body weight, or 5 mL/kg air was given intratracheally in each of two controlled trials: at birth to neonates 700 through 1350 g (the prophylactic trial, n = 74) or at 4 to 24 hours after birth to neonates greater than 650 g who had hyaline membrane disease severe enough to require mechanical ventilation (the rescue trial, n = 104). In both studies, time-averaged inspired oxygen concentrations and mean airway pressures during the 72 hours after entry decreased significantly (P less than .05) in the treated neonates when compared with control neonates. Thirty-six percent of the treated neonates in the rescue study had an incomplete response to treatment or relapsed within 24 hours, suggesting the need for retreatment in some neonates. In the rescue trial, risk-adjusted survival increased significantly in the treated group. There were no significant differences in intracranial hemorrhages, chronic lung disease, or symptomatic patent ductus arteriosus between control and treated infants in either trial. 
"Heartstart Scotland"--initial experience of a national scheme for out of hospital defibrillation. OBJECTIVE--To determine the outcome of out of hospital defibrillation in Scotland during the year after the introduction of automated external defibrillators in October 1988. DESIGN--Retrospective analysis of ambulance service reports and hospital records. SETTING--Scottish Ambulance Service and acute receiving hospitals throughout Scotland. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES--Delay from cardiac arrest to first defibrillator shock; vital state on arrival at hospital accident and emergency department; survival to hospital discharge. RESULTS--During the study period 268 defibrillators were purchased by public subscription and 96% of the 2000 ambulance crew underwent an eight hour training programme in cardiopulmonary resuscitation and defibrillation. A total of 1111 cardiac arrests were recorded, and defibrillation was indicated and undertaken in 602 (54%) patients, mean age 63 (range 14-92) years. A spontaneous pulse was present on arrival at hospital in 180 (30%) of the defibrillated patients, and 75 (12.5%) were subsequently discharged alive. As expected, the likelihood of survival was inversely related to the delay from the onset of cardiac arrest to the time of the first shock and was greater in the case of witnessed arrest. If ventricular fibrillation occurred after the arrival of the ambulance, survival to discharge was 33%. CONCLUSIONS--An effective scheme for out of hospital defibrillation can be introduced rapidly, and with limited training implications and costs, by the use of automated external defibrillators in ambulances. 
Colonic ischemia complicating immunotherapy with interleukin-2 and interferon-alpha. Colonic ischemia (CI) is a rare complication of high-dose interleukin-2 (IL-2) immunotherapy. This complication occurred in three of 141 patients (2.1%) with metastatic cancer treated with high-dose IL-2 therapy; CI only developed in patients receiving interferon-alpha (IFN) with IL-2 (three of 21, 14%) compared with none of 120 in those patients receiving IL-2 alone (P equals 0.0009). Severe diarrhea (greater than or equal to 7 bowel movements/day) also was significantly more common in patients receiving IFN with IL-2 (six of 21, 29%) than in those receiving IL-2 alone (three of 120, 2.5%, P equals 0.001) and preceded the clinical diagnosis of CI in all three patients. Three of nine patients with severe diarrhea had CI. Hematochezia occurred in four patients, all of whom received IFN with IL-2; three had CI, and the other patient had nonspecific colitis. Differences in vasopressor use did not explain the increased risk of CI in patients receiving IFN; those receiving IFN with IL-2 required phenylephrine less often than patients receiving IL-2 alone (P equals 0.01). The administration of lymphokine-activated killer (LAK) cells had no significant effect on the incidence of CI, severe diarrhea, peritonitis, or vasopressor use; two of three patients with CI, however, had their ischemic episode within 24 hours after the last of three LAK cell infusions. In conclusion, CI is an unusual complication of high-dose IL-2 and IFN immunotherapy. In patients receiving such combination therapy, severe diarrhea is a risk factor for the subsequent occurrence of CI. 
Carcinoma of the pancreas: a personal experience with 100 cases. One hundred patients with pancreatic cancer were evaluated between March 1981 and December 1989. This study showed that 61 were not candidates for definitive surgery because of nonoperability (28 patients) or nonresectability (33 patients). An additional 25 patients had cancers that were unresectable because of metastases (13 patients) or local spread of disease (12 patients) discovered at laparotomy. Fourteen patients had resectable cancers. Ten were treated by total pancreatectomy, three by distal pancreatectomy and one by pancreatoduodenectomy (Whipple). There were two operative mortalities. The median patient survival time was 20.5 months. Two patients survived 5 years. Five patients are alive at 3, 14, 18, and 47 months. Palliative surgical procedures performed in 18 patients included 10 biliary bypasses, 9 gastrojejunostomies, and 6 T-tube placements. This was associated with an operative mortality rate of 11%. The median survival time was 5 months. Other palliative measures included endoscopic placement of biliary and pancreatic stents (47 patients, 2.7% mortality rate), endoluminal radiation therapy, interstitial radiation therapy and external beam radiation therapy. The median survival time of patients so treated was 4.5 months. 
Successful medical treatment of presumed Candida endocarditis in critically ill infants. Few infants have been reported who survived fungal endocarditis; all have required both surgical and intensive antifungal therapy. We describe three infants, two weighing less than 1000 gm, who survived Candida endocarditis without surgery. Two had Candida parapsilosis, an agent not previously reported as a cause of neonatal endocarditis. All three infants were treated with amphotericin B and 5-flucytosine. Despite administration of 44, 38, and 48 mg/kg amphotericin B, respectively, no nephrotoxicity was noted; 5-flucytosine therapy was stopped in one infant because of thrombocytopenia. One infant died of an unrelated cause 6 months later; there was no evidence of Candida or endocarditis at autopsy. The other two infants are thriving 2 and 3 years after the completion of antifungal therapy; no remaining evidence of endocarditis is present on echocardiography. We conclude that antifungal therapy without surgery is an option for Candida endocarditis in critically ill infants. 
Clinical correlates of abnormal sensitivity to intraesophageal balloon distension. Sixty-five patients with esophageal complaints were studied to determine clinical associations with abnormal sensitivity to intraesophageal balloon distension (esophageal sensory dysfunction). Associations were examined in four categories: motility, esophageal symptoms, recent psychological symptoms, and general clinical features. A positive response to balloon distension (pain with less than or equal to 8 ml volume) was found in 29 (45%) of the subjects. This response was associated with specific findings in each category except recent psychological symptoms. A multiple logistic regression analysis indicated that an increased frequency of multipeaked waves on motility testing, presence of dysphagia, and shorter height of the subject each had an independent association with positive response to balloon distension (P less than or equal to 0.05 for each). Further comparison of subjects with sensory dysfunction, motor dysfunction, or both (sensorimotor dysfunction) indicated that subjects with the combined disorder appeared more symptomatic than those with either finding alone. These observations indicate that: (1) esophageal motor and sensory dysfunction are partially associated, but both contribute to the symptomatic state; (2) dysphagia may be representative of sensory dysfunction in some cases; and (3) subject height should be taken into consideration when interpreting balloon distension results. 
Smoking, the oral contraceptive pill, and Crohn's disease. Both cigarette smoking and the oral contraceptive pill have been implicated as aggravating factors in Crohn's disease. Based upon the recent demonstration of multifocal gastrointestinal infarction in Crohn's disease, a possible pathogenic mechanism for this condition, we propose how smoking and the oral contraceptive pill may potentiate a tendency for focal thrombosis and hence exacerbate the activity of Crohn's disease. 
Long-term therapy of HIV-associated Kaposi's sarcoma with recombinant interferon alpha-2a. Five young male patients with HIV-associated Kaposi's sarcoma (KS) were treated with recombinant interferon alpha 2a (rIFN-alpha-2a) over a period of 2-2.5 years. An IFN dose of 18 x 10(6) IU was given subcutaneously every day during the first 3 months of treatment and then on alternate days. Additional treatment with radiotherapy and laser therapy was given and, in some cases, isolated skin nodules were excised. Within 7 months of initiation of therapy one patient had a complete remission of his tumours, however, tumour progression recurred after the patient discontinued treatment. In another patient the tumour cleared within 9 months of rIFN therapy, and after 52 months he is still free of KS. The condition of a third patient tended to become stabilized during the first 6 months of therapy, but after 60 months there has been a slow progression. The fourth and fifth patients died 25 and 28 months, respectively, after the histological diagnosis of KS and the initiation of treatment. While on therapy with rIFN-alpha-2a, no life-threatening opportunistic infections occurred. The side-effects were mostly well tolerated, and no severe changes in haematological parameters were caused by the therapy. 
Value of dual-energy CT in differentiating focal fatty infiltration of the liver from low-density masses. Focal (irregular, partial) fatty infiltration of the liver may simulate neoplastic or other hypodense masses on CT. On the basis of previous observations of the phenomenon that differences in X-ray attenuation diminish with increasing energy of X-rays used, we performed a preliminary study to determine if dual-energy CT could be used to discriminate between fatty infiltration and hypodense liver masses. Dual-energy CT at 140 and 80 kVp was performed in 14 patients undergoing liver biopsy and in seven control subjects with presumedly normal liver. Attenuation measurements were taken, and the changes in attenuation between 140 and 80 kVp were calculated. The mean changes in attenuation were 3.5 H for normal liver (n = 7), 2.5 H for hypodense liver masses (n = 6), 13 H for fatty liver (n = 5), 0.3 H for fatty liver combined with hemochromatosis or hemosiderosis (n = 3), and 2 H for the spleen (n = 18). The change in attenuation increased as the fat content in the liver increased. Analysis of variance showed a statistically significant difference (p less than .001) between fatty liver and the other groups. A difference greater than 10 H was unique to fatty infiltration. These results suggest that dual-energy CT may help to differentiate focal fatty infiltration of the liver from low-density neoplastic or other lesions, but only if the iron content of the liver is not increased. 
Abnormal expression of histocompatibility and mitochondrial antigens by cardiac tissue from patients with myocarditis and dilated cardiomyopathy. Autoantibodies against the adenine nucleotide translocator (ANT), the branched chain alpha-ketoacid dehydrogenase (BCKD) complex proteins, and myosin have been implicated in the pathogenesis of human dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM). Cardiac tissue from patients with DCM and, for control purposes, cardiac tissue from patients with other forms of cardiomyopathy and from patients with no history of cardiac disease were stained with heterologous and ANT-, BCKD-, and myosin-specific affinity-purified sera from DCM patients. Data demonstrate that although anti-myosin stains tissues from both patients and normal controls, the ANT- and BCKD-specific heterologous and affinity-purified sera from DCM patients stain only cardiac tissues from DCM patients. Intense staining in patchy areas of cardiac tissue suggests that abnormal increased expression of these putative autoantigens occurs in discrete areas of cardiac myocytes. The reactivity of the antisera was organ specific and only seen in tissues from DCM patients. The organ and disease specificity of these findings suggests that such expression may play an important role in the pathogenesis of human DCM. 
Nifedipine reduces the incidence of myocardial infarction and transient ischemia in patients undergoing coronary bypass grafting. A randomized study was performed on 104 patients undergoing elective coronary artery bypass grafting to examine whether the infusion of nifedipine (n = 53) reduces the incidence of perioperative myocardial ischemia and necrosis in the early postoperative period. Continuous hemodynamic and three-channel Holter monitoring was performed for 24 hours and serial assessment of serum enzymes and 12-lead electrocardiography were performed for 36 hours postoperatively. Nifedipine (minimum dose, 10 micrograms/kg/hr for 24 hours) was applied from the onset of extracorporal circulation. The control group (n = 51) received nitroglycerin (minimum dose, 1 micrograms/kg/min for 24 hours). Using the combined analyses of electrocardiography and Holter recordings, myocardial ischemia was defined as being either a transient ischemic event (TIE), transient coronary spasm (TCS), or myocardial infarction (MI). The two groups did not differ with respect to preoperative New York Heart Association classification, age, history of myocardial infarction, extracorporal circulation and aortic cross-clamp time, number of distal anastomoses, or systemic and pulmonary hemodynamics. The incidence of perioperative myocardial ischemia was substantially lower in the nifedipine than in the nitroglycerin group [TIE: three of 53 patients (6%) versus nine of 50 patients (18%), p less than 0.001; MI: two of 53 patients (4%) versus six of 50 patients (12%), p less than 0.001; and TCS: none of 53 patients (0%) versus two of 50 patients (4%), p = NS]. 
Prevention of stroke and brain damage with calcium antagonists in animals. In a rat model of embolic stroke (permanent occlusion of the left middle cerebral artery [MCAO]), various 1,4-dihydropyridine calcium antagonists have been shown to attenuate brain damage and the resultant functional impairment when administered after MCAO. Dose-response curves reveal that isradipine is one of the most potent and efficacious representatives of this class of compounds, reducing the infarct size by more than 60%. These results suggest that isradipine, when administered shortly after stroke onset, may have beneficial effects in patients suffering from brain ischemia. When isradipine is used to normalize the high blood pressure in spontaneously hypertensive rats, it will, in addition, also protect the brain from damage engendered by a subsequent stroke. This is not the case if blood pressure is controlled with a calcium antagonist which does not cross the blood-brain barrier, suggesting that the brain protection seen with isradipine is not due to blood pressure normalization. Isradipine, when used as an antihypertensive, appears to have an additional beneficial effect within the brain itself. As high blood pressure is a major risk factor for stroke, such an additional benefit with isradipine would be particularly valuable in antihypertensive therapy. 
The relationship between large airway inflammation and airway metaplasia. To assess the role of acute inflammatory cells in large airways in the pathogenesis of metaplasia, we performed BAL (divided into aliquots) and mucosal biopsies on asbestos workers. They had evidence of asbestos-related lung injury. We found that acute inflammatory cells were significantly increased in the first aliquot. Ex-smokers had a greater percentage of PMN compared with nonsmokers and current smokers. The subjects were subgrouped with respect to biopsy-detected metaplasia. There was no difference between these groups for percentage or total number of PMN in the first aliquot. However, subjects with metaplasia had significant reduction in FEV1/FVC compared with those without. We conclude that there are significant differences in cells between the first and subsequent aliquots. Although inflammatory stimuli may be important in the pathogenesis of metaplasia, PMN present in the first aliquot could not be related to the severity of the metaplastic changes in these workers. 
Risks of leaving the gallbladder in situ after endoscopic sphincterotomy for bile duct stones. There is controversy concerning the subsequent clinical course of patients whose gallbladder is left in situ following successful endoscopic removal of stones from their common bile ducts. A total of 191 patients (median age 76 years) were reviewed between 12 and 100 months (mean 38 months) after endoscopic sphincterotomy. Ten patients (5.2 per cent) had symptoms requiring cholecystectomy which was uneventful, nine in the first year. Cholangitis at presentation or failure to fill the gallbladder by endoscopic retrograde cholangiography were not helpful in identifying these patients. Forty-nine (25.6 per cent) patients died during the review period from non-biliary pathology (usually cardiovascular). Elective cholecystectomy is not required in elderly patients with symptomatic bile duct stones if the common bile duct can be cleared of stones after endoscopic sphincterotomy. 
Carcinoma of the cervix treated with radiation therapy. I. A multi-variate analysis of prognostic variables in the Gynecologic Oncology Group. Between 1977 and 1985, the Gynecologic Oncology Group (GOG) conducted three clinical trials in locally advanced carcinoma of the cervix, clinical Stages I to IVA as classified by the International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics (FIGO). All 626 patients had primary carcinoma of the cervix and underwent operative assessment of the para-aortic (PA) lymph nodes. Patients received standardized external radiation therapy to the pelvis or to the pelvis and PA lymph nodes followed by one or two brachytherapy applications. To date, no statistically significant differences in progression-free interval (PFI) or survival time have been identified between the randomization treatment arms on any of these studies. Basic similarities among these studies led us to pool these data to identify patient characteristics and tumor characteristics associated with an increased risk of treatment failure. Multi-variate analysis showed patient age, performance status (PS), PA lymph node status, tumor size, and pelvic node status to be significantly associated with PFI. When modeling for survival, all these factors and clinical stage and bilateral extension were significant. 
Intrahepatic spontaneous arterioportal fistula: duplex ultrasound diagnosis and angiographic treatment. A 54-yr-old male with portal hypertension received ineffective medical therapy for the diagnosis of portal hepatic cirrhosis. Duplex ultrasound (US) revealed pulsatile arterial flow in the right main portal vein. The correct diagnosis of intrahepatic arterioportal fistula was established and confirmed by angiography. Right hepatic artery embolization with three coils was performed. The patient is alive for 16 months after the embolization, and his complaints have disappeared. There has been full resorption of ascites and absence of varices. Nine previously reported similar cases are reviewed. 
Transvaginal sonographic follow-up on the formation of fetal cephalocele at 13-19 weeks' gestation. An occipital meningocele was detected by transvaginal sonography in a fetus of 13 weeks' gestation. This changed at 14 weeks to a cephalocele, which disappeared at 15-16 weeks and was detected again at 19 weeks. It is possible that sliding backward and forward of the herniated brain tissue caused this sequence of events. 
Respiratory problems in emergence from anesthesia. In conclusion, anesthesia and mechanical ventilation have major effects on respiratory function, both intraoperatively and postoperatively. Recognition that mechanical ventilation represents a major departure from spontaneous ventilation should enable anesthesiologists to compensate for the increases in dead space ventilation and the propensity for alveolar collapse that accompany low volume mechanical ventilation. The use of postoperative regional analgesic techniques to alleviate respiratory compromise constitutes both current clinical practice and an area of active, ongoing investigation. Gone are the days when the anesthesiologist's responsibility stopped at the recovery room door. Today, anesthesiologists with expertise in postoperative pain management, cardiovascular physiology, and intensive ventilatory care are able to provide patients an improved likelihood of avoiding postoperative respiratory complications. 
Red cell deformability is an early indicator of infection. Red blood cells (RBC) have been shown to become less deformable during infection. The RBC deformability index (DI) was measured within 24 hours of admission in 37 patients who had suffered trauma and every 48 to 72 hours thereafter while they were in the surgical intensive care unit to assess whether DI could be used as an early indicator of infection after injury. Infection was defined as a temperature of 101 degrees F or more and a white blood cell count of more than 12,000/cm3 associated with a positive culture. Eighteen patients developed an infection, and 19 patients did not. On day 1, both groups showed a significant decrease in DI, compared to controls (0.33 +/- 0.18 and 0.34 +/- 0.25 for patients with infection and patients with no infection vs 1.52 +/- 0.12 for control volunteers; p less than 0.05). In the group with no infection, the DI improved in 16 of 19 patients after injury; the DI in patients with infection continued to decrease in 17 of 18 patients. The decrease in DI occurred 4 +/- 2 days (range, 2 to 8 days) before the diagnosis of infection. No significant differences were apparent in the absolute white blood cell count between the group with infection and the group with no infection at any time after injury. Differences in maximal temperature were noted on day 3 and beyond; however, 30% of patients with no infection had a temperature of more than 101 degrees F for 7 days. These data show that trauma results in a significant decrease in RBC deformability and that serial changes in DI appeared to predict which patients would develop an infection and which patients would recover uneventfully. RBC deformability may be helpful in early detection of infection in patients who have suffered trauma. 
Sensitivity of the gastric mucosa to acid and duodenal contents in patients with nonulcer dyspepsia. Nonulcer dyspepsia is a common clinical syndrome whose etiology is unknown. The sensitivity of the gastric mucosa to acid and duodenal contents in 18 patients with nonulcer dyspepsia was studied. The patients had a normal upper gastrointestinal endoscopy and biopsy specimens were obtained for determination of Helicobacter pylori status. Fifteen of the 18 patients were infected with H. pylori. All patients underwent intubation with double-lumen tube and collection of cholecystokinin-stimulated pancretico-biliary secretions. Subsequently, normal saline, 0.1N hydrochloric acid, and autologous duodenal secretions were infused into the stomach in a randomized blinded fashion. A positive response was defined as the production of epigastric pain by acid and/or bile but not by saline. By this definition, only 6 patients (33%) had a positive response and none had reproduction of their usual symptoms. In patients with a negative response, only 4 remained asymptomatic during all infusions. The remaining 8 had symptoms during infusion of saline, 7 of whom also had symptoms during infusion of acid and/or duodenal secretions. Two of these patients had reproduction of their usual symptoms. In conclusion, the gastric mucosa in patients with nonulcer dyspepsia is not abnormally sensitive to acid or duodenal contents. 
Fever response in elderly nursing home residents: are the older truly colder? OBJECTIVE: To test the hypothesis that many nursing home residents with an apparently blunted fever response (maximum temperature less than 101 degrees F) may actually have a significant change in temperature (delta T greater than or equal to 2.4 degrees F) which is not recognized because of a low baseline temperature. DESIGN: Retrospective chart review for cases of infection that met specific criteria and for chart-recorded baseline and infection temperatures. Chart-recorded baseline temperatures were prospectively compared with re-measurement of morning temperatures. SETTING: Nursing Home Care Unit of the VAMC West Los Angeles. PATIENTS: Random review of 40 residents' charts resulted in the detection of 69 infections among 26 residents over a 20-month period. Fifty randomly selected residents prospectively underwent comparison of chart-determined and actual re-measurement of baseline temperatures. RESULTS: In 50 randomly selected residents, the mean oral baseline temperature of 97.4 +/- 0.2 (degrees F +/- SEM) closely approximated the mean nurse-recorded measures in the charts (97.6 +/- 0.1). Chart review detected 69 infections among 26 residents, with 53 episodes having a temperature recorded during the infection. The mean maximum temperature (Tmax) during an infection was 101.3 +/- 0.3 (degrees F +/- SEM) but 47% (25/53) of the episodes had a "blunted" fever response (Tmax less than 101 degrees F). Of the 25 "blunted" fevers (Tmax less than 101 degrees F), about one-fourth demonstrated an adequate change in temperature from baseline (delta T greater than or equal to 2.4 degrees F) but failed to reach 101 degrees F because of a low baseline. Most infections (89%) had a Tmax greater than 99 degrees F. CONCLUSION: Establishing a nursing home patient's basal temperature and monitoring for changes in temperature (delta T greater than 2.4 degrees F) and/or lowering the threshold for recognition of fevers (to 99 degrees or 100 degrees F) in nursing home residents with a change in function should assist in early recognition of infections. 
Primary tumors of the facial (extracranial) nerve. Nearly 25% of all primary neurogenous tumors arise from peripheral nerves in the head and neck. The extracranial parts of the facial nerve, however, rank low as potential sites. Their tumors nonetheless pose diagnostic and management problems. In the intraparotid location the neurogenous tumors most often present as mass lesions, accompanied, in one third of patients, by various degrees of facial weakness. With the exception of a peculiar predilection of childhood plexiform neurofibromas to afflict the facial nerve, the majority of the tumors are neurilemomas. Recurrences are unusual after surgical removal of either neurilemomas or neurofibromas. The rare facial nerve sarcoma is a high-grade malignancy. 
Mucinous pancreatic tumors: ERCP findings Mucin-producing tumors of the pancreas are rare and difficult to diagnose neoplasms. To further characterize the nature of these lesions, four such cases are described here in which the diagnosis was suspected at endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography by the presence of ampullary or intraductal mucus. In one patient, pancreatoscopy directly visualized the tumor. Ultrasound and computed tomography failed to suggest the presence of a neoplasm in the majority of these cases, but endoscopic ultrasound was performed in one and correctly identified the multi-cystic tumor. A high incidence of acute pancreatitis was seen in these cases and was felt to be secondary to intermittent ductal obstruction by mucus. The characteristic appearance of intra-ductal mucus provides an important clue to the presence of this type of pancreatic neoplasia. 
Antibody to hepatitis C virus and liver disease in volunteer blood donors. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the specificity of antibodies to hepatitis C virus (anti-HCV) and their relation to liver disease in blood donors. DESIGN: Case series of consecutive blood donors found positive for anti-HCV by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Patients were evaluated for antibody specificity using a recombinant immunoblotting assay (RIBA) and were evaluated for biochemical evidence of liver disease. Patients showing increased alanine aminotransferase (ALT) levels had a liver biopsy. SETTING: University hospital. PARTICIPANTS: Fifty consecutive blood donors found to be anti-HCV positive on both an initial and repeat ELISA. Inclusion criteria were as follows: an absence of hepatitis B surface antigens and non-organ-specific autoantibodies; a daily alcohol intake of less than 50 g; no history of recent hepatotoxic drug use; and normal serum levels of alpha 1 antitrypsin, ceruloplasmin, and copper. MAIN RESULTS: Anti-HCV positivity was confirmed by RIBA in only 13 of 50 donors (26%) who had positive ELISA results. These 13 donors had an elevated ALT level and histologic evidence of chronic hepatitis, which was active in 8 patients (62%) and had already produced cirrhosis in 2 patients (15%). In contrast, the 17 donors with an intermediate RIBA pattern had only mild and often nonspecific histologic liver abnormalities. The 20 patients with a negative RIBA result had normal ALT levels. CONCLUSION: In blood donors, the anti-HCV RIBA is not only more specific than the anti-HCV ELISA, but is also useful in identifying patients who have an underlying chronic liver disease. 
Carcinoma of the uterus: use of gadopentetate dimeglumine in MR imaging. This prospective study assessed the role of gadopentetate dimeglumine-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging in the detection and staging of carcinomas of the endometrium and cervix. Surgical-pathologic findings were used as the standard of reference. In the evaluation of endometrial carcinoma, contrast-enhanced imaging improved tumor detection and differentiation between viable tumor and retained debris. Use of contrast material significantly improved the staging accuracy. The ability to assess the depth of myometrial invasion was also improved. In the evaluation of cervical carcinoma, assessment of tumor location and size did not improve following contrast enhancement. Use of gadopentetate dimeglumine resulted in overestimation of stromal, parametrial, vaginal, and/or bladder wall invasion in eight patients. However, evaluation of intratumoral architecture and large lesions was easier with contrast-enhanced imaging. When only stage II and higher disease was analyzed, use of contrast material improved the evaluation of disease extent. The authors conclude that gadolinium enhancement adds to the accuracy of evaluation of endometrial carcinoma but is useful in only advanced cases of cervical carcinoma. 
Osteogenic sarcoma arising adjacent to a long-standing ameloblastoma. A case report. Ameloblastoma is an uncommon odontogenic tumor usually occurring in the mandible. Rarely do other primary tumors occur with or arise from ameloblastoma. We describe a patient with simultaneous osteogenic sarcoma of the maxilla and recurrent ameloblastoma. 
Postradiation lower motor neuron syndrome presenting as monomelic amyotrophy. Monomelic amyotrophy developed 16 months, nine and 12 years after irradiation of the lumbosacral spinal cord for seminoma in one patient and for Hodgkin's disease in two others. In two patients, involvement was clinically limited to one leg, with a subacute course followed by plateau in the first case and with progressive worsening in the second one. In the third patient, the course was progressive with involvement of the other lower limb occurring five years later. From clinical and electrophysiological data, it seems probable that the disease process was a result of a selective injury to the lower motor neuron in the lower spinal cord. 
Right-to-left shunt across a patent foramen ovale caused by cardiac tamponade: diagnosis by transesophageal echocardiography. Cardiac tamponade can manifest as profound hypoxemia from intracardiac shunting across a patent foramen ovale. As a consequence, pulmonary embolus can be erroneously diagnosed. As demonstrated in the case described herein, transesophageal echocardiography can be useful in determining the correct diagnosis, especially if transthoracic echocardiography is technically limited. In our patient, the findings on transesophageal echocardiography also helped determine the appropriate treatment. The relative inaccessibility of the pericardial effusion to needle drainage prompted open surgical drainage. 
EMG activity in pericranial muscles during postural variation and mental activity in healthy volunteers and patients with chronic tension type headache. EMG activity was recorded over frontalis, temporalis and trapezius muscles in a supine position, a standing position and during a mental task in 32 female patients suffering from chronic tension-type headache and in 20 healthy volunteers. Measurements in patients were made before and after biofeedback therapy. All EMG levels were on average significantly higher in patients than in controls. 62.5% of patients had at least one abnormal EMG level, but only 34% were beyond the normal range, if 1 muscle and 1 recording condition was considered. EMG levels were not correlated with headache severity, anxiety or response to biofeedback treatment. It is therefore suggested that pericranial EMG activity is not pathogenetic in chronic tension type headache, but merely one of several pathophysiologic changes, that are produced by a central dysfunction. 
Anterior uveitis and hypopyon. We undertook a study to determine the incidence of hypopyon, as well as the most common anterior uveitis entities with which hypopyon is associated. A total of 216 patients with anterior uveitis were studied. The uveitis was acute in 155. Of the 155 patients, 11 (7.1%) had hypopyon. Nine of the 11 patients with hypopyon were positive for HLA B27. Of these nine, two had Reiter's syndrome and one had ankylosing spondylitis; the other six had no confirmed systemic disease. Of the two patients with hypopyon who were HLA B27-negative, one had mixed connective-tissue vascular disease, and one had idiopathic anterior uveitis. Of the 155 patients with acute anterior uveitis, 62 were HLA B27-positive. Thus, the incidence of hypopyon uveitis among HLA B27-positive patients was 14.5% (nine of 62 patients), whereas the incidence among HLA B27-negative patients was only 2.2% (two of 93 patients). These results suggest that HLA B27-related anterior uveitis is the most common cause of hypopyon uveitis, and that most patients with anterior uveitis associated with hypopyon will test positive for HLA B27. Although these results reflect a referral population, they should be of benefit in the treatment of patients with anterior uveitis. 
Concurrent eosinophilic fasciitis and cutaneous T-cell lymphoma. Eosinophilic fasciitis as a paraneoplastic syndrome of T-cell malignant neoplasms? Eosinophilic fasciitis has been reported to precede hematologic malignant neoplasms such as myelomonocytic leukemia, lymphocytic leukemia, and Hodgkin's lymphoma. In this case study, eosinophilic fasciitis occurred concurrently with cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (mycosis fungoides). The clinical diagnosis of eosinophilic fasciitis was based on painful sclerodermatous lesions on the extremities and trunk without acrosclerosis. There was histologic confirmation with edema and lymphocytic inflammation in the superficial muscular fascia and dermis. Deposition of immune reactants was found in the fascia and dermis. In addition, peripheral eosinophilia and circulating immune complexes were detected. The diagnosis of cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (mycosis fungoides) was based on extensive erythematous cutaneous plaques, dermal and epidermal lymphocytic atypia, loss of pan-T-cell immunologic markers, and a cutaneous lesional T-cell receptor beta-chain rearrangement by Southern blot analysis. Eosinophilic fasciitis may occur as a paraneoplastic syndrome associated with hematologic malignant neoplasms, including mycosis fungoides. Cytokines or lymphokines released by activated immunocytes, either malignant leukocytes or normal leukocytes reacting to malignant cells, may be responsible for the eosinophilia and sclerosis seen in these associated hematologic malignant neoplasms. 
Adhesion formation after ovarian electrocauterization on patients with polycystic ovarian syndrome. The rate of adhesion formation after ovarian electrocauterization has been described in two selective and unselective groups of patients with PCOS. The rate of this complication in the selective group was 0 from 16 ovaries and in the unselective group (5/25). However, the rate of major adnexal adhesion in the unselective group was 1 from 25 ovaries. 
Asperger's syndrome: who is being abused? Six case histories of children referred and admitted to a psychiatric inpatient unit at a tertiary referral centre because of concerns about poor functioning and possible emotional abuse are presented. On initial assessment the children appeared to be well functioning and the impression was confirmed that their emotional needs were not being met by their parents. After detailed inpatient appraisal the diagnosis of Asperger's syndrome was made in all six cases, exemplified mainly by a formal concrete way of thinking and an inability to identify and understand human emotions and relationships. The impact of the diagnosis on the parents and their consequent relationships with their child and their willingness to work with professionals is discussed. 
Large molecular form of serum HBeAg in chronic hepatitis B virus infection: relation to liver cell damage. We have separated circulating HBeAg into small and large molecular forms by agarose gel electrophoresis and analyzed the relationship between the two forms and other clinical features of chronic hepatitis B, especially in regard to liver cell damage. The large HBeAg accounted for 7.3% +/- 3.4% of serum HBeAg in 9 subjects with normal liver histological findings or nonspecific reactive hepatitis, 38.0% +/- 27.8% in 32 patients with chronic persistent hepatitis and 65.6% +/- 23.3% in 21 patients with chronic active hepatitis (p less than 0.01). A positive correlation was seen between the height of aminotransferase elevations and the percentage of large HBeAg. Three patients who progressed from histologically normal liver or nonspecific reactive hepatitis to chronic active hepatitis had dramatic increases in the percentage of large HBeAg. The finding that the presence of large HBeAg in serum correlated with the severity of hepatitis suggests that HBeAg may play an important role in determining the degree of liver injury in chronic hepatitis B. 
Ischaemic myelopathy secondary to disseminated intravascular coagulation in AIDS. A 39-year-old patient with AIDS presented with a rapidly progressive myelopathy with a partial Brown-Sequard syndrome. He died, 9 weeks after onset of the first neurological signs, from diffuse encephalopathy. Neuropathological examination revealed multiple, usually small, frequently haemorrhagic, infarcts or various ages and numerous fibrin thrombi in medium and small penetrating vessels and capillaries of the brain and spinal cord, characteristic of disseminated intravascular coagulation. There were no inflammatory changes. Immunohistochemical studies for human immunodeficiency virus, cytomegalovirus, varicella zoster virus, herpes simplex virus type 1 and type 2 were negative. Ischaemic spinal cord lesions due to disseminated intravascular coagulation may represent an unusual cause of focal, non-inflammatory, non-tumoral, myelopathic syndrome in AIDS. 
Infection by mink cell focus-forming viruses confers interleukin 2 (IL-2) independence to an IL-2-dependent rat T-cell lymphoma line. The development of T-cell lymphomas in rodents infected with type C retroviruses has been linked to the generation of a class of envelope (env) recombinant viruses called mink cell focus-forming viruses (MCF viruses) in the preleukemic thymus. To determine whether infection by MCF viruses altered the growth phenotype of retrovirus-induced T-cell lymphomas, a Moloney murine leukemia virus-induced interleukin-2 (IL-2)-dependent rat T-cell lymphoma line (4437A) was infected with MCF-247, modified MCF-V33 (mMCF-V33), or NZB-xenotropic (NZB-X) virus. The effects of virus infection on the IL-2 dependence of these cells was examined by cultivating them in the absence of IL-2. After IL-2 withdrawal, the uninfected and NZB-X-infected cells went through a crisis period characterized by massive death. All the independently maintained cultures of MCF- and mMCF-V33-infected cells, on the other hand, became IL-2 independent without a crisis. All the polytropic virus-infected IL-2-independent cultures contained a population of cells that was polyclonal with regard to polytropic provirus integration. Over this polyclonal background each culture produced multiple clones of cells that were selected rapidly after IL-2 withdrawal. Furthermore, the resulting MCF- or mMCF-V33-infected IL-2-independent cells retained the expression of IL-2 receptor. These data show that MCF and mMCF-V33 viruses may alter the growth phenotype of a T-cell lymphoma line and suggest that their effect on cell growth may be due to the direct interaction of the MCF envelope glycoprotein with cellular components, perhaps the IL-2 receptor. 
Pulmonary angiitis and granulomatosis. The presentation of a patient with multiple pulmonary nodules with or without cavitation and often with signs of a multisystemic vasculitis should suggest one of the pulmonary angiitis and granulomatosis syndromes. The five conditions traditionally considered together in the category of pulmonary angiitis and granulomatosis differ widely in their cause and pathogenesis and are more appropriately considered as variants or relatives of other processes. The radiologic features of this group of diseases, however, are similar, and it is useful to still consider them together. Table 1 summarizes the radiologic features of these conditions. 
Acanthoma fissuratum. Acanthoma fissuratum secondary to the use of spectacles is a rare clinical finding associated with an ill-fitting frame. An interesting case is presented to highlight such a problem. Surgical excision of such lesions is recommended with advice to the patient regarding the suitable fitting of spectacles. 
Electrophysiologic and anatomic characteristics of ventricular tachycardia induced at the right ventricular outflow tract but not at the apex. The site of ventricular stimulation is an important variable in the initiation of ventricular tachycardia (VT) by programmed ventricular stimulation. Among 169 patients studied consecutively, 17 (10%) had ventricular tachycardia induced by programmed electrical stimulation from the right ventricular outflow tract but not from the apex. Fourteen of these 17 patients had had prior myocardial infarction (12 had inferior, and two had both inferior and anterior myocardial infarction), two had a dilated cardiomyopathy, and one had a localized cardiomyopathy. Fourteen patients had echocardiograms suitable for analysis. Of these, 12 had posterior/inferior ventricular wall motion abnormalities located at the base of the heart. The ventricular effective refractory periods from the right ventricular outflow tract and right ventricular apex were 237 +/- 4 and 244 +/- 5 msec, respectively (p less than 0.05, mean +/- SEM). Induced VT had a cycle length of 229 +/- 4 msec and had the morphology of right bundle branch block in 12 patients, of left bundle branch block in three patients, and had both morphologies in two patients. In 14 patients the axis was superior. VT was initiated with two extrastimuli in 15 patients and with burst right ventricular pacing in two patients. Similar pacing techniques with identical pacing intervals did not induce VT at the right ventricular apex in 14 of these 17 patients. Further, among the 15 patients whose VT was induced at the right ventricular outflow tract with two extrastimuli, neither burst pacing (n = 13) nor two extrastimuli introduced at faster paced rates (n = 12) induced VT at the right ventricular apex. 
Effect of bile diversion and sphincterotomy on gallbladder muscle contractility and gallstone formation. Feeding prairie dogs a diet rich in cholesterol induces gallstone formation that is preceded by a sustained decrease in gallbladder smooth muscle contractility. Sphincterotomy is known to prevent gallstone formation in cholesterol-fed prairie dogs. Experiments were designed to determine whether the effect of sphincterotomy is a consequence of hepatic bile diversion, and whether bile diversion prevents the altered contractility. Following sham operation, surgical biliary enteric bypass, or sphincterotomy, prairie dogs were fed a high-cholesterol or a regular diet. Gallbladder muscle contractility and the presence of crystals and stones were determined. In sham-operated animals, the cholesterol diet induced a decrease in gallbladder muscle contractility and caused the formation of cholesterol gallstones. In animals with bile diversion and sphincterotomy, the effects of cholesterol feeding were reduced or prevented. Thus, these procedures may prevent stone formation by preventing a reduction in gallbladder contractility. Contractility was depressed in animals with bile diversion fed a regular diet, compared with animals with a sham operation fed a regular diet. The mechanism for this depression may differ from that induced by the cholesterol diet. Diversion, and perhaps sphincterotomy, impairs gallbladder filling. Thus, gallbladder muscle is not stretched and does not contract against a load. This could result in a "disuse atrophy." If the results from our study apply to humans, sphincterotomy may reduce stone formation by preventing the effects of lithogenic bile on gallbladder muscle contractility and by enhancing the ability of the muscle to empty the lithogenic bile. 
Antibody to hepatitis C is common among patients with alcoholic liver disease with and without risk factors. Thirty-seven patients with clinically suspected alcoholic liver disease were retrospectively studied for the prevalence of antibody to hepatitis C virus (HCV) by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and immunoblot assay. Twenty-four had biopsy-proven cirrhosis. Nineteen had identifiable risk factors for non-A, non-B viral hepatitis, and 18 did not. Five of 19 high-risk (26%) and 6 of 18 low-risk (33%) patients had positive antibody, compared with two of 179 healthy blood donors (p less than 0.01 for either group of alcoholics compared with blood donors). Nine of 11 ELISA-positive patients were also either positive or indeterminable by immunoblot testing. Histologic scores for parameters commonly associated with chronic viral hepatitis were numerically worse among anti-HCV-positive patients, but none reached statistical significance. Clinically, seven of 11 (64%) of anti-HCV-positive patients versus 14 of 26 (54%) anti-HCV-negative patients were Child's class C. Among the 21 Child's class C patients, seven (33%) were anti-HCV-positive versus four of 16 (25%) of Child's class A/B patients. A weak correlation between IgG and ELISA optical density was observed (r = 0.52). We conclude that antibody to hepatitis C by ELISA and immunoblot is common among alcoholics with liver disease even in the absence of known or suspected risk factors for viral hepatitis. Although hepatitis C-positive patients tended to have more severe histologic disease, neither histologic parameters nor clinical findings were adequate to predict antibody seropositivity. 
Site-directed mutagenesis of the region around Cys-241 of complement component C2. Evidence for a C4b binding site. We probed the functional significance of the region around Cys-241 in human C2 by testing the hemolytic activity of a series of mutant rC2. Mutant C2 cDNA were constructed by oligonucleotide-directed site-specific mutagenesis and expressed transiently in COS cells. Wild-type rC2 had threefold higher specific hemolytic activity than native serum C2. Substitution of Gly, Ala, or Ser for Cys-241 resulted in a slightly, but significantly, increased activity. In addition, I2 had no effect on the activity of these mutant C2. Substitution of Lys for Gln-243 increased the hemolytic activity by more than two-fold. Increased activity in all cases was due to slower decay rates of the C3 convertase. Finally, substitution of Leu or Ala for Asp-240 or Ser-244, respectively, resulted in more than 100-fold decrease of hemolytic activity. The results suggest that residues 240 to 244 of human C2 represent an important structural determinant of the C4b binding site of C2a. They also confirm that Cys-241 is the residue responsible for the increased activity of C2 reacted with I2. 
Psychiatric disorders in 36 families with Wolfram syndrome. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to test the hypothesis that heterozygous carriers of the gene for the Wolfram syndrome, who constitute about 1% of the population, are predisposed to significant psychiatric illness. The Wolfram syndrome is an autosomal recessive neurodegenerative syndrome in which 25% of the individuals who are homozygous for the condition have severe psychiatric symptoms that lead to suicide attempts or psychiatric hospitalizations. METHOD: The authors collected questionnaires, death certificates, and hospital records for blood relatives and their spouses in 36 families of individuals with the Wolfram syndrome and compared the proportion of blood relatives who had had psychiatric hospitalizations, had committed suicide, or had self-reported mental illness to the proportion of spouses with the same manifestations. RESULTS: The proportion of blood relatives who had had psychiatric hospitalizations, had committed suicide, or had self-reported mental illness significantly exceeded the proportion of spouses with the same manifestations. CONCLUSIONS: Since heterozygous carriers of the gene for the Wolfram syndrome are 50-fold more common among the blood relatives than among the spouses, the larger proportion among blood relatives is evidence that heterozygous carriers of the gene for the Wolfram syndrome are predisposed to significant psychiatric illness. 
Value of sonography in monitoring the therapeutic response of mediastinal lymphoma: comparison with chest radiography and CT. The aim of this retrospective study was to assess the diagnostic value of mediastinal sonography, compared with that of chest radiographs and CT, in the follow-up of patients with mediastinal lymphomas and in the prediction of clinical outcome. The sonograms, chest radiographs, and CT scans of 40 consecutive patients with Hodgkin (n = 29) and non-Hodgkin (n = 11) lymphoma obtained before and after completion of therapy were analyzed blindly and independently by three radiologists and compared with clinical outcome. Nine patients were treated with radiotherapy, 12 with chemotherapy, and 19 with combined therapy. Therapeutic response was assessed from all available clinical and biochemical findings as well as from the combined results of all imaging studies performed on further follow-up. The sonograms showed obvious changes in the size and echogenicity of the mediastinal lymphomas that corresponded closely with the response to therapy. Sonography showed complete regression of the lymphomas in 30 patients who had complete remission. In five patients with incomplete remission, sonographic diagnoses were correct. All lymph nodes, irrespective of size, detected with sonography after a phase of complete remission indicated recurrence (five patients). Sonographic findings corresponded with those of CT in 25 (81%) of 31 cases. Clinical outcome suggested that the sonographic findings were more reliable in the five cases in which CT and sonographic findings conflicted. Chest radiographs were inadequate for monitoring the response of mediastinal lymphomas to therapy; in 17 (43%) of 40 cases, a false impression was obtained of the extent and therapeutic response of mediastinal lymphomas. The results of this study indicate that sonography is clearly superior to chest radiographs and comparable to CT for monitoring patients with mediastinal lymphomas. 
Pyruvate kinase activity and isozyme composition in normal fibrous tissue and fibroblastic proliferations. Pyruvate kinase (PK) was studied in 57 fibroblastic and fibrohistiocytic proliferations and normal fibrous tissue (n = 10). The specific activity was significantly increased in malignant tumors (1.67 +/- 0.25) compared with normal tissue (0.26 +/- 0.04; P less than 0.001) and benign proliferations (0.52 +/- 0.05; P less than 0.005). Although an overlap exists between aggressive fibromatosis and the benign group, high values of PK activity are indicative of Grade 2 and 3 malignancy. Significant shifts in isozyme pattern, favoring the expression of K-type subunits were found in tumors with a metastasizing potential and aggressive fibromatosis. These changes in the isozyme pattern of PK in aggressive fibromatosis may act as another argument to place them in the category of malignant fibroblastic tumors. 
Evaluation of mixed chimerism by in vitro amplification of dinucleotide repeat sequences using the polymerase chain reaction. The influence of mixed hematopoietic chimerism (MC) after allogeneic bone marrow transplantation remains unknown. Increasingly sensitive detection methods have shown that MC occurs frequently. We report a highly sensitive novel method to assess MC based on the polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Simple dinucleotide repeat sequences called microsatellites have been found to vary in their repeat number between individuals. We use this variation to type donor-recipient pairs following allogeneic BMT. A panel of seven microsatellites was used to distinguish between donor and recipient cells of 32 transplants. Informative microsatellites were subsequently used to assess MC after BMT in this group of patients. Seventeen of the 32 transplants involved a donor of opposite sex; hence, cytogenetics and Y chromosome-specific PCR were also used as an index of chimerism in these patients. MC was detected in bone marrow aspirates and peripheral blood in 18 of 32 patients (56%) by PCR. In several cases, only stored slide material was available for analysis but PCR of microsatellites or Y chromosomal material could be used successfully to assess the origin of cells in this archival material. Cytogenetic analysis was possible in 17 patients and MC was detected in three patients. Twelve patients received T-cell-depleted marrow and showed a high incidence of MC as revealed by PCR (greater than 80%). Twenty patients received unmanipulated marrow, and while the incidence of MC was lower (44%), this was a high percentage when compared with other studies. Once MC was detected, the percentages of recipient cells tended to increase. However, in patients exhibiting MC who subsequently relapsed, this increase was relatively sudden. The overall level of recipient cells in the group of MC patients who subsequently relapsed was higher than in those who exhibited stable MC. Thus, while the occurrence of MC was not indicative of a poor prognosis per se, sudden increases in the proportions of recipient cells may be a prelude to graft rejection or relapse. 
Let sleeping dogs lie: role of the omentum in the ileal pouch-anal anastomosis procedure. A surgical aphorism has long held that the omentum is the "watchdog of the abdomen." However, detractors believe that leaving the omentum behind after colectomy precipitates later small bowel obstruction. A retrospective comparison was made between a group of 406 patients (Group I) having omentectomy with proctocolectomy and ileoanal anastomosis and a group of 239 patients (Group II) having a similar procedure without omentectomy. Follow-up in this series of 645 patients was 4.3 +/- 2.1 years (mean +/- SEM). No difference was present in the rate of partial small bowel obstruction or complete small bowel obstruction between Group I patients (32 percent partial, 12 percent complete) and Group II patients (29 percent partial, 12 percent complete; P greater than 0.1). However, a better outcome with regard to postoperative sepsis and sepsis requiring operation was apparent in Group II patients retaining the omentum (4 percent and 3 percent, respectively) than in Group I patients (10 percent and 8 percent, respectively), in whom the omentum was removed (P less than 0.01). As this experience would support, we urge surgeons to "let sleeping dogs lie" and, when possible, retain the omentum when performing colectomy or proctocolectomy. 
Hepatosplenic candidiasis: successful treatment with fluconazole. PURPOSE: To determine if fluconazole is effective treatment for hepatosplenic candidiasis that has not resolved with amphotericin B and flucytosine treatment. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Six patients (ages 3 to 44) with acute leukemia and hepatosplenic candidiasis who did not respond to prior antifungal therapy were treated with fluconazole. RESULTS: All six patients had fever and three had nausea and vomiting; computed tomographic (CT) scan showed lucencies in the liver in six, lucencies in the spleen in five, and lucencies in the kidneys in three. Prior therapy with 1.6 to 4 g of amphotericin B in the five adults and 526 mg of amphotericin B in the child (with the addition of flucytosine in four) failed to improve clinical symptoms or lucencies in the liver, spleen, and kidneys seen on CT scan. Fluconazole was given at a dose of 200 to 400 mg daily (70 to 100 mg in the child) for 2 to 14 months. All patients had resolution of fever and other symptoms in 2 to 8 weeks. Improvement of the lesions noted on CT scan was seen in 4 to 8 weeks in all patients. Total resolution of lesions noted on CT scan occurred by 4 weeks in two patients, but took 4 to 5 months for three patients and 13 months for one patient. Three patients had relapse of their acute leukemia and two died, presumably cured of their candidiasis. Two patients underwent successful bone marrow transplantation without relapse of their candidiasis. CONCLUSION: Fluconazole appears to be useful in the treatment of hepatosplenic candidiasis that has not resolved with amphotericin B and flucytosine therapy. 
Moderate protection of renal function and reduction of fibrosis by colchicine in a model of anti-GBM disease in the rabbit. A rabbit model of renal glomerulosclerosis induced by anti-glomerular basement membrane antibody was used to determine whether colchicine would protect renal function and reduce fibrosis. Initial studies established the time course of renal function changes and fibrosis. Colchicine at a dose of 0.02 to 0.04 mg/kg per day injected ip was begun at day 4 when injury had been initiated, and the experiment was ended at day 21 when fibrotic changes were established. Colchicine significantly reduced the rise in serum creatinine (serum creatinine = 2.7 +/- 0.3 mg% in vehicle-treated animals versus 1.8 +/- 0.1 mg% in colchicine-treated animals) and interstitial fibrosis (fibrosis score = 2.6 +/- 0.2 in vehicle-treated versus 1.5 +/- 0.2 in colchicine-treated animals). Colchicine treatment did not significantly affect weight, anti-guinea pig immunoglobulin level, % fibrocellular crescents formed, hydroxyproline per gram (dry weight) in tissue, or urine protein: creatine ratio. Regression analysis was performed to examine the interrelationships between variables for all animals and the effect of colchicine on pairs of variables. No clear-cut site of colchicine action could be identified. These data show that colchicine, in doses that could be used in humans, protected renal function by about 25% and reduced interstitial fibrosis in a model of severe crescentic nephritis. 
Diarrheal deaths in the United States, 1979 through 1987. A special problem for the elderly. OBJECTIVE.--Diarrhea is an important cause of death among young children in both developing and developed countries, but little is known about diarrheal death among adults. In this study, we examined trends in diarrheal deaths among all age groups in the United States. DESIGN/SETTING/PARTICIPANTS.--We reviewed national mortality data complied by the National Center for Health Statistics, Hyattsville, Md, which consists of information from all death certificates filed in the United States for the period 1979 through 1987. A death for which diarrhea was listed as an immediate or underlying cause was considered a "diarrheal death" and included in the analysis. RESULTS.--We found that 28,538 persons died of diarrhea cited as either an immediate or the underlying cause of death during the 9-year period. A majority of diarrheal deaths occurred among the elderly (older than 74 years of age, 51%), followed by adults 55 to 74 years of age (27%), and young children (younger than 5 years of age, 11%). For the elderly, adjusted risk factors for dying of diarrhea included being white, female, and residing in a long-term care facility. Only the elderly and young children had clear, distinct winter peaks of diarrheal deaths, suggesting that the diarrhea may, in part, be infectious in origin. CONCLUSION.--For the elderly, more directed studies of those at risk, such as nursing home residents, are needed to determine if oral rehydration therapy, vaccines, or other preventive measures might benefit this population. 
Acute and chronic hemodynamic effects of xamoterol in mild to moderate congestive heart failure. Xamoterol, a new beta 1 partial agonist, has the potential to modulate cardiac response to variations in sympathetic tone in patients with heart failure. Its properties should result in beta-receptor stimulatory effects at low levels of sympathetic tone and beta-receptor protective effects at higher levels of sympathetic tone. The acute effects of intravenous (i.v.) xamoterol on hemodynamics at rest and during exercise were studied in 30 patients with mild to moderate heart failure (13 patients in New York Heart Association class II; 17 in class III) due to ischemic (n = 24) or cardiomyopathic (n = 6) heart disease. Cardiac index, stroke volume and stroke work index at rest were significantly improved after i.v. administration of xamoterol and consistent with net agonist effects. During exercise, heart rate and double product were significantly reduced (net antagonist effects), but with preservation of the expected increases in cardiac index and systolic blood pressure. These hemodynamic findings confirm the ability of xamoterol to modulate cardiac response to variations in sympathetic tone. Tachyphylaxis and arrhythmogenicity limit the chronic use of drugs with full beta-agonist properties as positive inotropes in heart failure. The patients were therefore entered into a 6-month double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover study of chronic oral xamoterol therapy, 200 mg twice daily, and the hemodynamic responses to i.v. xamoterol were repeated at the end of the trial. No impairment in either resting or exercise effects was observed, indicative of a maintained response and absence of tachyphylaxis after chronic therapy. Furthermore, 24-hour ambulatory electrocardiographic monitoring showed no change in ventricular arrhythmias during oral treatment. 
Trisomy 12 in chronic lymphocytic leukemia: an interphase cytogenetic study. Interphase cytogenetics by means of in situ hybridization with the chromosome 12-specific biotinylated alpha satellite DNA probe pSP 12-1 was used for the study of trisomy 12, the most common chromosomal abnormality in chronic lymphocytic leukemia. In situ hybridization was performed on methanol/acetic acid fixed cells of conventional cytogenetic preparations from eight patients and on morphologically and immunologically classified cells of cytospin preparations from seven patients. The results show that trisomy 12 is more common than assumed on the basis of karyotype analysis of metaphase chromosomes: 2 of 13 patients with a normal karyotype in G-banding analysis were shown to have trisomy 12 by interphase cytogenetics. Immunophenotyping of the cells of one patient showed that the trisomy was restricted to cells with Ig light chain clonality. For the evaluation of the prognostic, therapeutic, and biologic significance of trisomy 12, in situ hybridization should be used in parallel with karyotype analysis because it allows the study of all cell populations of both interphase and mitotic cells, whether neoplastic or normal. 
Multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1: a 10-year prospective screening study in four kindreds. A total of 80 individuals in 4 kindreds with multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1 (MEN 1) have been subjected to repeated biochemical screening during a 10-yr period with the principal aim being to analyze characteristics of the developing pancreatic lesion. Age at presentation of the MEN 1 trait averaged 18 yr in 7 previously unaffected individuals, and this effect of the screening procedure represented a lowering by almost 2 decades. Pancreatic endocrine involvement was recognized at a mean age of 25 yr and constituted the presenting lesion in a majority of the patients. A standardized meal test and basal values of serum pancreatic polypeptide, insulin, proinsulin, and gastrin were the most efficient markers for the pancreatic lesion and preceded signs of pancreatic tumors upon radiological examinations by a mean of 3.5 yr. A 75% penetrance of the islet cell disease and 90% for primary hyperparathyroidism within the affected individuals equalled the prevalences reported in autopsy studies. Two of the kindreds showed signs of intrafamilial homogeneity with respect to the profile of peptide excess (P less than 0.05) and considerable discrepancy in the malignant potential of the pancreatic lesions. The results of early detection and surgical intervention of the pancreatic tumors in MEN 1 suggested an impact on morbidity, while any effect on the mortality of these individuals remains to be clarified. 
Surgical risk of hemorrhage in cerebral amyloid angiopathy. Cerebral amyloid angiopathy is increasingly recognized as a cause of lobar cerebral hemorrhage in normotensive elderly individuals. Isolated reports have suggested that neurosurgical intervention entails a high risk of precipitated hemorrhage. We identified 16 pathologically confirmed cases of cerebral amyloid angiopathy. Fourteen of these patients presented with lobar cerebral hemorrhage. Fifteen neurosurgical procedures in eight patients included eight clot evacuations, three abscess drainage procedures, two ventriculoperitoneal shunts, one biopsy, and one lobectomy. Recurrent postoperative cerebral hemorrhage was seen in four patients at 2 days, 9 days, 6 weeks, and 10 months, but surgery was thought to have precipitated the cerebral hemorrhage in only one patient. Recurrent cerebral hemorrhage also was seen in two of the eight nonoperated cases. Recurrent cerebral hemorrhage is characteristic of cerebral amyloid angiopathy, but we conclude that neurosurgical intervention, particularly evacuation of hematomas, is not associated with major risk of precipitated hemorrhage. 
Ventricular fibrillation complicating endomyocardial biopsy of a cardiac allograft. Transvenous endomyocardial biopsy remains the most useful diagnostic aid in assessing rejection in the transplanted heart. Although invasive, the complications associated with endomyocardial biopsy are few, and the procedure is generally regarded as safe. We report a case of apparent ventricular fibrillation complicating transvenous endomyocardial biopsy. Histologic section revealed evidence of moderate acute rejection. This case represents the first report of a life threatening ventricular dysrhythmia following routine endomyocardial biopsy in a cardiac transplant recipient. 
Catheter-less suprapubic cystolithotomy in children. Bladder stones in children are common in developing countries and the procedure of choice for their removal is suprapubic cystolithotomy. It is standard practice to drain the bladder for a few days post-operatively to prevent urinary leakage. We have observed that, if the bladder is closed meticulously in 2 layers, bladder drainage by means of a catheter is not required. We have analysed 86 children treated by suprapubic cystolithotomy without a catheter. Size of the stones and intra-operative findings were noted and it was found that 85% of the patients had an excellent result; 10% had a satisfactory result and 4.7% were unsatisfactory. The advantages of the procedure and selection of the patients are discussed. 
Deleted HTLV-I provirus in blood and cutaneous lesions of patients with mycosis fungoides. Mycosis fungoides, a rare form of cutaneous T cell leukemia/lymphoma, is suspected of having a viral etiology on the basis of certain similarities to adult T cell leukemia, which is associated with human T cell leukemia/lymphoma virus type I (HTLV-I) infection. Cell lines were established from peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) of an HTLV-I-seronegative patient with mycosis fungoides. DNA hybridization analysis revealed the presence of HTLV-I-related sequences with unusual restriction endonuclease sites. Sequence analysis of subcloned fragments demonstrated the presence of a monoclonally integrated provirus with a 5.5-kilobase deletion involving large regions of gag and env and all of pol. Additional evidence for the presence of deleted proviruses was found by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification of DNA from cutaneous lesions of five other HTLV-I-seronegative patients. The findings suggest that HTLV-I infection may be involved in the etiology of at least certain cases of mycosis fungoides. 
Prostate specific antigen in the management of patients with localized adenocarcinoma of the prostate treated with primary radiation therapy. The records of 143 patients treated at 5 institutions with external beam megavoltage irradiation for localized prostatic cancer were reviewed to evaluate post-treatment changes in prostate specific antigen (PSA) in the context of subsequent events. Complete responders were defined as patients clinically well with normal PSA, clinical failures were patients with documented local tumor recurrence or distant metastases and chemical failures were patients clinically well but with a PSA level above the upper limits of normal. Correlations with pre-treatment PSA values were also made for the 50 of 143 patients for whom pre-treatment PSA data were available. Median patient followup was 27 months (range 18 to 91 months). The data were analyzed with parametric and nonparametric univariate and multivariate statistical procedures. Pre-treatment PSA levels increased with increasing tumor stage (p = 0.004) but not with increasing summed Gleason pattern scores (p = 0.15). The probability of remaining a complete responder decreased with increasing stage (p = 0.008) but not with increasing Gleason score (p = 0.14). Increasing pre-treatment PSA correlated with clinical failure (p = 0.01) and chemical failure (p = 0.006). Of the patients with a pre-treatment PSA level of less than 4 times the upper limits of normal 83% remained as complete responders compared to 30% of those with a higher pre-treatment PSA (p = 0.0002). The return of PSA levels to the normal range within 6 months after treatment was strongly correlated with a favorable outcome when analyzed by multivariate logistic regression. The status at last followup of patients who had a normal PSA level at 6 months versus those with an elevated PSA level 6 months after treatment is 94% versus 8% for complete responders (p = 0.0001), 0% versus 60% for clinical failures (p = 0.002) and 6% versus 32% for chemical failures (p = 0.14). Similar results occurred when analyzing outcomes in relationship to PSA normalization within 12 months after treatment (p = 0.001 for clinical failures, p = 0.02 for chemical failures and p = 0.001 for complete responders). We conclude that the pre-treatment level of PSA is an independent prognostic factor for prostate cancer patients treated with primary radiation therapy, and that the failure of PSA to return to the normal range within 1 year after completion of treatment identifies a group of patients at high risk for tumor recurrence. 
Hemodynamic effects of direct angiotensin II blockade compared to converting enzyme inhibition in rat model of heart failure. The purpose of this investigation was to compare the chronic effects of converting enzyme inhibition with captopril to direct blockade of angiotensin II (AII) with DuP 753 in the rat model of heart failure. Rats with chronic heart failure postinfarction were treated for 2 weeks with either captopril (2 g/L, N = 9) in their drinking water or with DuP 753 (40 mg/kg/day for two weeks by gastric gavage, N = 10), or placebo (N = 9). At this dose, DuP 753 shifted the log dose-pressor response curve to AII parallel to the right by two orders of magnitude in both chronically treated normal and heart failure rats. In rats with heart failure, DuP 753 and captopril reduced left ventricular end-diastolic pressure from 26.7 +/- 1.5 to 14.2 +/- 3.0 (P less than .01) and 15.8 +/- 2.2 mm Hg (P less than .05), respectively, left ventricular end-diastolic volume index from 2.71 +/- 0.10 to 2.03 +/- 0.17 (P less than .05) and 2.18 +/- 0.15 (P less than .05), respectively; venous compliance increased from 2.27 +/- 0.06 to 2.80 +/- 0.18 (P less than .05) and 3.02 +/- 0.21 mL/mm Hg/kg (P less than .01), respectively. There were no significant changes in left ventricular weight/body weight ratio, mean aortic pressure, heart rate, or right atrial pressure. There was a trend, but not significant, for a reduction in total blood volume from 65.8 +/- 1.1 to 59.4 +/- 3.0 and 64.9 +/- 3.9 mL/kg, respectively. Thus, direct blockade of AII with DuP 753 or with converting enzyme inhibition with captopril produces similar hemodynamic changes in rats with heart failure after myocardial infarction. 
Preventive maintenance of the aging heart. Coronary heart disease (CHD) is the major cause of mortality in the elderly. Important risk factors include hypercholesterolemia, systolic and diastolic hypertension, cigarette smoking, hyperglycemia, and obesity. Elderly patients with existing CHD should be treated aggressively to control these risk factors, along with other medical therapies to treat myocardial ischemia. For elderly patients without recognized CHD, however, a more conservative approach is recommended and includes behavioral interventions when appropriate and pharmacologic therapy for higher risk patients with persistent, uncontrolled risk factors. 
Screening in ovarian cancer. Ovarian cancer will affect 20,000 American women this year and some 13,500 will die of the disease. Most patients will have stage III or IV disease at the time of diagnosis. Because ovarian cancer may be initially without symptoms, attempts have been made to develop screening tests that would lead to an early diagnosis. Two tests, serum CA 125 and pelvic ultrasonography, have been suggested by some to be accurate enough to be included in yearly screening for ovarian cancer. Although further testing of these techniques is encouraged, data to date do not justify yearly screening with CA 125 or pelvic ultrasonography in all women. 
Indicators of prognosis after hepatic resection for colorectal secondaries. From 1960 to 1988, 266 patients underwent resection of colorectal secondaries to the liver with curative intent. All patients were followed until April 1, 1990, or death, with a median follow-up time of 52 months. Nine patients with minimal macroscopic residual disease and 38 patients with all gross tumor removed but positive margins showed a poor prognosis with a median survival time of 13.3 months, the longest being 42 months. Of the 219 patients having potentially curative resection, 12 patients died postoperatively (5.5%). Actuarial 5, 10 and 20-year survival for the remaining 207 patients was 39%, 28%, and 18%, respectively. At April 1, 1990, 77 patients were alive with no evidence of disease for up to 24 years, and 12 patients had died without recurrence. The following factors were associated with less favorable crude survival: presence and extent of mesenteric lymph node involvement (p = 0.0003), grade III/IV primary tumor (p = 0.035), synchronous diagnosis of metastases (p = 0.017), satellite metastases (p = 0.0003), limited resection margins (p = 0.019), and nonanatomic procedures (p = 0.013). With respect to disease-free survival, grading of the primary (p = 0.055) and the extent of clear margins (p = 0.019) failed to achieve statistical significance. Two other criteria are commonly recommended as absolute contraindications to hepatic resection: extrahepatic disease and the presence of four or more independent metastases. A radical excision of all detectable disease may rarely be possible in these circumstances. Nevertheless, within the curative settings, no significant predictive value regarding either overall or disease-free survival was found in this series. Three corresponding "high risk" patients are alive without disease at 5 to 11 years from hepatic resection. These patients with more advanced intrahepatic or concomitant limited extrahepatic disease require a particularly thorough diagnostic work up. As no superior therapeutic alternative is currently available, an aggressive surgical approach may occasionally be justified, and may, in a small portion, result in definite tumor control. 
The effect of palliative radiation therapy on epidural compression due to metastatic malignant melanoma. The efficacy of palliative radiation therapy in the treatment of spinal cord and cauda equina compression due to metastatic malignant melanoma was evaluated in 38 sites in 35 patients treated between 1970 and 1990. All patients had radiographic documentation of epidural compression. The median dose of radiation therapy was 2850 cGy (range, 500 to 4000 cGy), with daily fractions ranging from 200 to 800 cGy. Twenty-eight sites in 26 patients were evaluable 1 month after completion of radiation therapy, and symptoms responded completely in 11 of 28 (39%) sites. Fourteen sites (46%) showed a partial response of symptoms. Response lasting until death was documented in 21 of 26 patients (81%). Patients receiving a total dose of 3000 cGy or greater were more likely to achieve a complete response than those receiving less than 3000 cGy (62% versus 20%) by univariate (P = 0.025) and multivariate (P = 0.048) analyses. A treatment program of radiation therapy and corticosteroids is effective in palliating the symptoms of epidural compression due to metastatic malignant melanoma. It is recommended to deliver an accelerated course of radiation therapy to a dose of 3000 cGy or greater without exceeding spinal cord tolerance (e.g., 3000 cGy in ten fractions at 300 cGy per fraction). 
Management of adipsia by a behavioural modification technique. Adipsia combined with diabetes insipidus after hypothalamic damage may produce major difficulties in clinical management. If there is an associated memory impairment it may be impossible to teach self-regulation of fluid balance, necessitating long-term hospital supervision. The successful use of a behaviour modification technique to achieve independent drinking and allow discharge from hospital into the community is described in a patient with adipsia, diabetes insipidus and memory impairment resulting from the removal of a craniopharyngioma. 
Thermal ablation of the gallbladder. Gallbladder ablation by means of injection of hot contrast medium was attempted in 13 dogs. Room temperature contrast medium was injected into the gallbladders of two additional dogs (controls). After midline laparotomy was performed to expose the gallbladder, temperature probes were placed in the liver adjacent to the gallbladder, and on the surface and in the lumen of the gallbladder. A 7-F catheter with multiple side holes was placed into the gallbladder. The cystic duct was clamped during the procedure. After injection of boiling contrast medium, the mean temperature in the gallbladder lumen was 80 degrees C; in the adjacent liver, 43.5 degrees C; and on the gallbladder surface, 45.8 degrees C. After the procedure, the cystic duct was unclamped, temperature probes and catheter were removed, and the laparotomy was closed in standard fashion. In the hot contrast medium group, one dog each was sacrificed at 2, 4, 8, and 12 weeks, and at 6 months. Six animals were sacrificed at 1 year. The gallbladder was completely ablated in 11 of 13 animals in the hot contrast medium group. One dog was sacrificed at 8 days because of bile leakage, and another was sacrificed at 17 days because of gallbladder rupture. The two control animals were sacrificed at 12 and 13 weeks, and their gallbladders were normal at that time. 
A study guided by the Health Belief Model of the predictors of breast cancer screening of women ages 40 and older. In late 1987, a total of 852 Rhode Island women ages 40 and older were interviewed by telephone (78 percent response rate) to measure their use of breast cancer screening and to investigate potential predictors of use. Predictors included the women's socioeconomic status, use of medical care, a provider's reported recommendations for screening, and the women's health beliefs about breast cancer and mammography. The Health Belief Model guided the construction of the interview questions and data analysis. Logistic regression was used to identify leading independent predictors of breast cancer screening according to contemporary recommendations: reporting that a medical provider had ever recommended a screening mammogram (odds ratio [OR] = 18.77), having received gynecological care in the previous year (OR = 4.92), having a regular source of gynecological care (OR = 2.63), having ever had a diagnostic mammogram (OR = 2.32), and perceiving mammography as safe enough to have annually (OR = 1.93). The findings suggest that programs intended to increase the use of breast cancer screening should include "inreach" and "outreach" elements; inreach to patients with established patient-provider relationships, by assuring that physicians recommend screening to all eligible patients, and outreach to all eligible women, by helping them overcome barriers to effective primary care, and by promoting mammography, emphasizing its effectiveness and safety. The findings also suggest that socioeconomically disadvantaged women, who are less likely to be screened than other women, should become special targets of inreach and outreach interventions. 
Percutaneous drainage of traumatic pancreatic pseudocysts in children. To determine the effectiveness of percutaneous drainage of traumatic pancreatic pseudocysts, we reviewed the courses of 13 children. Six pseudocysts resolved on complete bowel rest and total parenteral nutrition. Seven required further therapy. Two pseudocysts were treated operatively; five were drained percutaneously with fluoroscopic guidance. These five ranged from 5 to 15 cm in diameter and were present for 10 to 42 days (mean, 26 days). In all cases, the cyst fluid was clear, had an amylase level of greater than 40,000 IU/L, and grew no organisms. The pigtail catheters left in place in four of the five children were removed when drainage stopped. Patients were followed by ultrasound while still in the hospital and 1 month after discharge. There were no complications nor any pseudocyst recurrence. Percutaneous drainage of traumatic pancreatic pseudocysts in children is an effective alternative to the standard operative therapy of pseudocystenteric anastomosis. 
A placebo-controlled trial of continuous intravenous diltiazem infusion for 24-hour heart rate control during atrial fibrillation and atrial flutter: a multicenter study. The safety and efficacy of a 10- to 15-mg/h continuous infusion of intravenous diltiazem were evaluated in 47 patients with atrial fibrillation or flutter who first responded to 20 mg or 20 mg followed by one or more 25-mg bolus doses of open label intravenous diltiazem. Of the 47 patients, 44 responded to the bolus injection and were randomized under double-blind conditions to receive either a continuous infusion of intravenous diltiazem (10 to 15 mg/h) (23 patients) or placebo (21 patients) for up to 24 h. Seventeen (74%) of the 23 patients receiving diltiazem infusion and none of the 21 with placebo infusion maintained a therapeutic response for 24 h (p less than 0.001). Over 24 h, patients receiving diltiazem infusion lost response significantly more slowly than did those receiving placebo infusion (p less than 0.001). Nonresponders to the double-blind infusion were given an additional bolus injection of open label intravenous diltiazem and administered an open label 24-h intravenous diltiazem infusion. The overall proportion of patients maintaining a response to a 24-h infusion of intravenous diltiazem under double-blind or open label conditions combined was 83% (34 of 41). Efficacy of the 24-h infusion of intravenous diltiazem was similar in elderly versus young patients, those who did versus those who did not receive digoxin and those weighing less than 84 versus greater than or equal to 84 kg. However, intravenous diltiazem appeared to be more effective in atrial fibrillation than in atrial flutter. No significant untoward effects were noted. 
Histamine H2-receptor antagonists. In summary, histamine initiates acid secretion by stimulating the H2 subtype histamine receptor on parietal cells. Cimetidine, rantidine, famotidine, and nizantidine are histamine H2-receptor antagonists that block this action of histamine, reducing gastric acid output and concentration under both basal and stimulated conditions. These agents are used for treatment and prevention of peptic and stress ulcers as well as for hypersecretory states. Because of their effectiveness and low incidence of side effects, H2-antagonists have largely replaced more traditional antiulcer regimens. 
Seizures caused by nontraumatic parenchymal brain hemorrhages. Seizures occurred in 15% of patients with parenchymal brain hemorrhage (early in 12% and delayed in 3%). Seizures were most frequent with lobar hemorrhages and uncommon with deep subcortical hemorrhages. Lobar hemorrhages in the frontal, parietal, or temporal region were more commonly associated with seizures, whereas occipital hemorrhages were not. Seizures were most common if the hemorrhage was due to an aneurysm, angioma, or neoplasm and less common if hypertensive or spontaneous. If the patient had recurrent seizures or developed delayed seizures, CT showed that the hemorrhage evolved to a hypodense appearance; if the seizure did not recur, CT showed that the hemorrhage evolved to an isodense appearance. 
Patent ductus arteriosus in an infant with atrioventricular septal defect and pulmonary hypertension: diagnosis by transesophageal color flow echocardiography. An infant with complete atrioventricular septal defect (atrioventricular canal) was examined by standard transthoracic two-dimensional pulsed Doppler and color Doppler echocardiography. No evidence of ductus arteriosus was present. Preoperative transesophageal echocardiography identified a patent ductus: the left-to-right shunt seen by color Doppler echocardiography was enhanced by pharmacologic maneuvers aimed at decreasing pulmonary vascular resistance and increasing systemic vascular resistance. Transesophageal echocardiography was found to be more sensitive than transthoracic echocardiography even in a small infant. 
Using ADLs to establish eligibility for long-term care among the cognitively impaired. Using a database from the Oregon Medicaid program, we examined the differences in the potential insurance coverage of demented persons by using different formulations of ADL (activities of daily living) dependencies in which the definition of dependency did or did not include the need for supervision. For those with clear dementia, 81-88% of the persons with significant behavioral problems were correctly identified when a cut score of three or more ADLs was used; this percentage was even higher for two or more ADLs. This approach was not as effective in correctly discriminating those who had no behavioral problems. 
Neuropathy, myopathy and destructive arthropathy in primary hypothyroidism. A 75-year-old woman with untreated primary hypothyroidism was found with peripheral neuropathy (including carpal tunnel syndrome), severe myopathy (high levels of creatine phosphokinase) and destructive arthropathy, affecting fingers, toes and the left knee. Radiographs of her knee showed destructive lesions of the tibial plateau similar to a pathologic compression fracture, while the joints of the fingers and toes showed all signs of severe erosive osteoarthritis (OA), radiographically documented over a period of 7 years. It is suggested that hypothyroidism is causally related to the development of erosive OA. 
Autoimmune aetiology for acquired neuromyotonia (Isaacs' syndrome). Neuromyotonia is a rare disorder of unknown cause in which hyperexcitability of peripheral motor nerves leads to incapacitating muscle twitching, cramps, and weakness. We investigated an antibody-mediated mechanism for neuromyotonia in a 24-year-old man with a 7-year history of severe disease unresponsive to pharmacological treatment. Two periods of plasma exchange each produced almost complete disappearance of symptoms for 2-3 weeks, and a highly significant decrease in recorded neuromyotonic discharges. Injection of the patient's plasma or purified IgG into mice significantly enhanced in-vitro resistance to d-tubocurarine at the neuromuscular junction of phrenic nerve-diaphragm preparations. This finding suggests that an increase in neurotransmitter release might result from an antibody-mediated reduction in the number of functional potassium channels that normally regulate nerve excitability. The demonstration of pathogenic IgG autoantibodies in acquired neuromyotonia suggests that immunosuppressive treatment may be helpful in severe cases. 
Use of a marshmallow bolus for evaluating lower esophageal mucosal rings. Sixty-three patients (35 women, 28 men; mean age 55 yr) with lower esophageal mucosal ring shown radiographically were examined with a semi-solid bolus consisting of a portion of a standard marshmallow. The most common symptom was dysphagia, present in 46 (73%) patients. Impaction of the marshmallow bolus by the ring occurred in 40 (63%) of the 63 patients, and produced symptoms in 27 (68%) of these 40 patients. Nine (14%) rings were detected radiographically only with a solid bolus; eight of these patients had dysphagia and seven rings were 20 mm or less in caliber. Impaction related to ring caliber, and was found in all 17 (100%) rings that were 13 mm or less in diameter, in 17/24 (71%) 14- to 19-mm rings, and in 6/22 (27%) rings 20 mm or more in caliber. Endoscopy in 23 patients detected 16 (70%) rings, and also depended on ring caliber: less than or equal to 13 mm, 6/6 (100%); 14-19 mm, 5/9 (56%); greater than or equal to 20 mm, 5/8 (63%). Marshmallow impaction occurred in 17 (74%) of 23 patients who had endoscopy; three of the 23 patients had normal endoscopy. In conclusion, radiographic examination supplemented by the use of a marshmallow bolus best detects lower esophageal mucosal ring. 
Blindness as an ictal phenomenon: investigations with EEG and SPECT in two patients suffering from epilepsy. Blindness is a rare ictal phenomenon in epileptic seizures. It can occur as an aura, as the seizure itself, or postictally. We investigated two such patients, in one of whom blindness manifested as an aura prior to tonic clonic seizures; the interictal EEG exhibited a spike-wave focus bioccipitally. In the second patient blindness occurred postictally. An ictal SPECT, carried out at the onset of the seizure demonstrated marked hyperperfusion in both occipital regions. 
Malignant pleural mesothelioma: CT manifestations in 50 cases. Malignant pleural mesothelioma, a rare and usually fatal neoplasm that is associated with asbestos exposure, is being encountered with increasing frequency. Pretreatment CT findings from 50 patients with malignant pleural mesothelioma are illustrated. Pleural thickening was found in 46 (92%) of the 50 patients, thickening of the pleural surfaces of the interlobar fissures in 43 (86%), pleural calcifications in 10 (20%), and pleural effusions in 37 (74%). The volume of the involved hemithorax varied appreciably. Contractions of the involved hemithorax was noted in 21 (42%) of 50 patients and contralateral mediastinal shift in seven (14%). Disease beyond the parietal pleura was found in the chest wall (nine patients), mediastinum, lymph nodes, and diaphragm. 
Pseudosarcomatous fibromyxoid tumor of the prostate. A case report with immunohistochemical, electron microscopic, and DNA flow cytometric analysis. A 22-year-old man presented with symptoms of urinary obstruction and was found to have a 5-cm mass protruding from the left side of the prostate into the prostatic urethra. The lesion was partially removed by transurethral resection (TURP). The patient's symptoms recurred, so he required another TURP four months later; at latest follow-up (four years later), there waas no evidence of disease. Light microscopy revealed a myxoid lesion characterized by an atypical fibroblastic proliferation associated with a prominent inflammatory component and granulation tissue-type vasculature. The lesion nearly replaced the prostatic parenchyma and invaded the bladder wall. Immunohistochemistry and electron microscopy showed a predominance of fibroblasts with occasional myofibroblasts. DNA flow cytometric analysis showed that the tumor cells had a diploid DNA content. Given these findings and the indolent clinical course, the authors think that this lesion represents a benign, reactive process consistent with a pseudosarcomatous fibromyxoid tumor, a recently described rare lesion of the genitourinary tract. 
Characterization of macrophage colony-stimulating factor in body fluids by immunoblot analysis. We characterized the molecular species of human macrophage colony-stimulating factor (hM-CSF) found in serum and urine, using immunoblot analysis after partial purification on an antibody-bound affinity column. Although antibodies were prepared using the recombinant product of the large form of hM-CSF with a molecular weight (MW) of 85 Kd as the antigen, this immunoblot system was also capable of detecting the small form of hM-CSF with a MW of 40 to 60 Kd. A single band with a MW of 43 Kd, which reacted with anti-recombinant hM-CSF IgG but not with control IgG, was found when serum and urine from normal adults underwent electrophoresis on reduced sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel and subsequent immunoblotting. This band represented a subunit of the large form of hM-CSF, because the large form of hM-CSF is a homodimer of a subunit with a MW of 43 Kd and the small form of hM-CSF is a homodimer of a subunit with a MW of 20 to 30 Kd. Analysis of serum and urine from leukemic patients and pregnant women, who had higher serum levels of hM-CSF than normal adults, showed only a single band with a MW of 43 Kd as a hM-CSF-specific molecule. These results suggest that the large form of hM-CSF is the major species in human body fluids.
