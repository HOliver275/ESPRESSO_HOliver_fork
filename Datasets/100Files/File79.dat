Immunoglobulin response to intravenous streptokinase in acute myocardial infarction. OBJECTIVE--To devise assays to assess and follow the specific antibody response in patients treated with streptokinase for acute myocardial infarction. DESIGN--Venous blood samples were collected before treatment with streptokinase started and subsequently at regular intervals over one year. Specific IgG and subclass IgG1 were assessed by an enzyme linked immunosorbent assay. SETTING--Coronary care unit in a general hospital. PATIENTS--48 patients with acute myocardial infarction: 22 patients had venous blood samples taken at presentation only; serial blood samples were taken from 20 patients who then received thrombolytic therapy with streptokinase and six patients who were unsuitable for thrombolytic therapy. RESULTS--Titres of antibodies to streptokinase were low at presentation in 36 (75%) of the 48 patients. Serial measurements made in 20 patients showed the virtual disappearance of antibody within the first 24 hours. This was followed by a steady increase in the specific IgG1 titre, which peaked at day 14 before gradually declining. Values at one year remained significantly higher than baseline values. There was no evidence of an IgM response in the patients studied. CONCLUSION--Low titres of antibodies to streptokinase were widespread in the population. Antibody was consumed after treatment and the subsequent immunoglobulin rise suggested a secondary immune responses; the recently described neutralising capacity to streptokinase is probably related to this antibody. 
Genetic predisposition to iatrogenic Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease. The spongiform encephalopathy Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD) has been transmitted to man via administration of growth hormone and gonadotropin extracted from large pooled batches of human cadaveric pituitary glands. In the UK, 1908 individuals were exposed to potentially contaminated growth hormone, of whom 6 have so far manifested CJD. Examination of the prion protein genes of all these cases and of a single case of gonadotropin-related CJD showed that 4 had the uncommon valine 129 homozygous genotype indicating genetic susceptibility to prion infection. Such genetic susceptibility may be important in the aetiology of sporadic CJD disease. 
Infrared, thermistor, and glass-mercury thermometry for measurement of body temperature in children with cancer. Body temperature is often the sole determinant of whether or not the neutropenic cancer patient is admitted to the hospital for empiric antibiotic therapy. Recently developed infrared tympanic thermometers offer rapid readings, but their accuracy has not been established. We studied two infrared thermometers (FirstTemp and Thermoscan) and a thermistor (IVAC) in children with cancer. Mean infrared measurements did not differ significantly between right and left ear canals, and the mean IVAC temperature did not differ significantly from the left to the right axilla (P greater than 0.05, paired t test). IVAC predictive mode mean temperature was 0.2 degrees C lower than monitor mode mean temperature in the axilla (P less than 0.0001), but 0.1 degree C higher than monitor mode orally (P less than 0.0001). Aiming the infrared instrument at the tympanic membrane using an ear tug resulted in a 0.2 degree C higher mean temperature than casual placement in the ear canal (P less than 0.0001). After compensation for the mean difference in reference oral glass-mercury versus test instrument temperatures, the FirstTemp, Thermoscan, and oral and axillary predictive mode IVAC measurements yielded sensitivities for the detection of fever of 84%, 84%, 82%, and 86%; specificities of 100%, 99%, 100%, and 100%; positive predictive values of 100%, 93%, 100%, and 100%; and negative predictive values of 95%, 98%, 98%, and 98%, respectively. We conclude that each of these instruments detects fever with comparable reliability. Infrared instruments are especially attractive alternatives due to their time efficiency. 
Optimal technique for detection of gallstones at injection cholecystography: in vitro analysis. Injection cholecystography is often employed during invasive gallbladder procedures to determine the number of gallstones that are present. The authors undertook this study to define the optimal radiographic technique for performance of injection cholecystography. Condoms filled with 100 mL of contrast medium at four different iodine concentrations (30%, 15%, 7.5%, and 3.8% [wt/vol]) and containing up to five 4-mm-thick gallstones or a single 10-mm-thick gallstone were radiographed in a 20-cm-deep water bath by using four kilovolt peak settings (70, 80, 90, and 100 kVp). Images were read by three radiologists who were blinded to the radiographic technique. significantly (P less than .05) improved Decreasing iodine concentration significantly (P less than .05) improved detection of 4-mm-thick gallstones at a constant kilovolt peak setting. However, increasing the kilovolt peak setting while using the same concentration of contrast medium had no statistically significant influence on gallstone detectability, although radiologists did indicate a preference for the high-kilovolt peak technique. Results of the authors' experiments showed that for detection of small gallstones at injection cholecystography, use of a low-concentration contrast medium and a high kilovolt peak setting is the recommended radiographic technique. 
Acute colorectal ischaemia after anaphylactoid shock. A 29 year old woman is reported with bloody diarrhoea three hours after developing anaphylactoid shock. Sigmoidoscopy, barium enema, and histology showed rectal and colonic ischaemia to the splenic flexure. Recovery was complete. There was no history of vascular disease but the patient was taking an oral contraceptive. Thirty one other cases of spontaneous ischaemic proctitis are reviewed. 
Expression of c-erbB-2 oncoprotein in mammary and extramammary Paget's disease. Formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue sections from 45 patients with mammary and extramammary Paget's disease were stained immunohistochemically with the use of a polyclonal antiserum directed against a 14-amino acid segment of the c-erbB-2 oncoprotein. Positive membrane staining, which correlates with gene amplification, was found in 15 of 19 cases (79%) of mammary Paget's disease, 4 of 13 cases (31%) of vulvar Paget's disease, none of 8 cases of scrotal Paget's disease, and none of 5 cases of perianal Paget's disease. Of the 19 patients with mammary Paget's disease, specimens of underlying breast tissue were available from 14; all contained a concurrent ductal adenocarcinoma. Concordance of c-erbB-2 antigen staining between the underlying breast carcinoma and the pagetoid component was observed in 12 cases. Of the 13 patients with vulvar Paget's disease, 2 had superficial stromal invasion, and 3 had underlying, deeply invasive adenocarcinomas. One superficially invasive case was positive for c-erbB-2 expression. One additional case of vulvar Paget's disease had an associated primary pagetoid endocervical adenocarcinoma that spread into the endometrium; both the endocervical and vulvar components stained positively for the c-erbB-2 antigen. The results of this study indicate that the c-erbB-2 oncoprotein may play a role in the pathogenesis of extramammary Paget's disease. These results also suggest that the c-erbB-2 oncoprotein may function in vivo to promote intraepithelial spread of adenocarcinoma cells. 
Clinical pathology of endocrine tumors of the pancreas. Analysis of autopsy cases. A clinicopathological analysis of endocrine tumors of the pancreas, using 800 autopsy cases (422 men, 378 women, mean age 78.7) was accomplished. The results were: (1) Endocrine tumors and similar lesions were found in 3% or 24 cases (25 lesions). Twenty lesions (20 cases) were found to be tumors and five lesions (five cases) were determined to be hyperplasia of Langerhans islets. (2) Incidence of tumor was 10% (6/60) in individuals having histological studies of all sections of the pancreas, and 1.6% (12/738) in individuals having histological studies of three random sections of the pancreas. (3) None of the cases with tumors and hyperplastic lesions showed symptoms of hormone production. (4) Immunohistochemical analysis revealed hormone production in all 20 tumor cases and multiple hormone production was found in 14 of these (70%). (5) Ductular or tubular structures were found in or adjacent to the tumors in 12 cases (60%) and hyperplasia in one case (20%). Langerhans islets, 500 microns or larger in size, were found in three lesions of the tumor (15%). Langerhans islets with the mean diameter of normal islets + 2 SD or larger also were found around five tumors (25%) and three hyperplasias (60%). The above findings suggest that endocrine tumors of the pancreas are prevalent and that they do not produce symptoms of excessive hormone production even though they do continue to produce hormones. Some of the endocrine tumors or hyperplasias develop from totipotent stem cells of the duct epithelia, and factors promoting the growth of Langerhans islets might exist. 
Mechanisms of plasma membrane protein degradation: recycling proteins are degraded more rapidly than those confined to the cell surface. Plasma membrane proteins of intact mouse 3T3 fibroblasts and H4-II-E-C3 hepatoma cells were separated into two groups based on their compartmentation between the cell surface and an intracellular compartment accessible at 20 degrees C but not at 0 degrees C. One group was derivatized at 0 degrees C with sulfosuccinimidyl 2-(biotinamido)ethyl-1,3-dithiopropionate but not at 20 degrees C. The second group was derivatized at 20 degrees C as well as at 0 degrees C. Derivatized proteins were isolated from 35S-labeled cells on streptavidin/agarose and resolved by two-dimensional PAGE. With few exceptions, pulse-chase experiments revealed that those proteins confined exclusively to the cell surface turned over slowly (t1/2, greater than 75 h), while those bimodally compartmentalized between the cell surface and the 20 degrees C accessible compartment were degraded more rapidly (t1/2, less than 31 h). These observations suggest a mechanism to explain the varied metabolic stability of plasma membrane proteins in which the half-life of each protein is determined by the proportion of time spent in the endocytic compartment. 
Long-term postoperative dysphagia in oral/pharyngeal surgery patients: subjects' perceptions vs. videofluoroscopic observations. Dysphagia commonly results from surgical resection of various structures within the oral, pharyngeal, and esophageal areas. The type and severity of swallowing dysfunction are based largely on the number and quantity of structures removed as well as the reconstructive procedure. Short term-recovery has been addressed in many studies. However, follow-up studies of long-term functional results and continuing swallowing problems following oral/pharyngeal surgery are unavailable. In this study, perception of swallowing dysfunction was compared with actual videofluoroscopic findings in subjects at least 1 year after oral/pharyngeal surgery. The comparative results of a questionnaire developed to evaluate patients' perception of continuing swallowing difficulty and an analysis of actual videofluoroscopic tapes indicated that the degree or type of dysphagia could not be determined from patients' subjective descriptions of the swallowing problem. 
Role of candida in pathogenesis of antibiotic-associated diarrhoea in elderly inpatients The part that candida plays in antibiotic-associated diarrhoea was investigated in 24 elderly inpatients (mean age 74 years) who tested negative for Clostridium difficile toxin and other intestinal pathogens. 7 had intestinal overgrowth of Candida species (greater than or equal to 10(5) cfu/ml). None of the 24 matched, antibiotic-treated controls without diarrhoea had candida overgrowth. All 5 patients with diarrhoea and candida overgrowth treated with oral nystatin responded with resolution of diarrhoea and lowering of faecal counts to less than 10(4) cfu/ml within 7 days of start of antifungal therapy despite continuation of antibacterial therapy. In the other 2 patients with candida overgrowth, the diarrhoea subsided spontaneously and faecal candida counts returned to normal (less than 10(4) cfu/ml) after antibacterial agents were withdrawn. In patients without candida overgrowth, diarrhoea persisted until antibiotics were withdrawn, at a mean of 16 days after study entry. 
Differential expression of markers for endothelial cells, pericytes, and basal lamina in the microvasculature of tumors and granulation tissue. The structure and function of the tumor microvasculature is of great interest for cancer biology, diagnosis, and therapy. The distribution of endothelial cells, pericytes, and basal lamina in tumors is not well documented. In this study, the authors investigated the distribution of markers for these different components in a series of malignant human tumors and in human granulation tissue, both situations with extensive angiogenesis. Their results show a striking heterogeneity in the expression of markers for pericytes and endothelial cells between different tumors, but also within a single tumor lesion. To be able to distinguish between these two adjacent cell types decisively, all marker studies were carried out both on the light and the electron microscopical level and compared with staining results in granulation tissue of cutaneous wounds in healthy volunteers and of decubitus lesions. In granulation tissue of decubitus lesions, well-defined zones with increasing levels of maturation can be delineated. It was found that antibodies recognizing von Willebrand factor often failed to stain the tumor capillaries. Of the pericyte markers, alpha-smooth muscle actin was only locally expressed by pericytes in the tumor vasculature, whereas the high-molecular-weight melanoma-associated antigen, a chondroitin sulfate proteoglycan, stained the microvasculature broadly. Staining of the basal lamina components collagen type IV and laminin was, within the tumor, not restricted to the microvasculature. From their findings the authors conclude that 1) for the visualization of the tumor vasculature, antibodies recognizing endothelial markers, especially monoclonal antibodies PAL-E and BMA 120, are preferable to those recognizing pericytes or basal lamina; 2) within the microvasculature of tumors and granulation tissue, a heterogeneity of expression of endothelial and pericyte markers is observed; 3) during the formation of granulation tissue, all three microvascular components can be demonstrated already in the histologically earliest stage, suggesting not only an involvement of endothelial cells but also of pericytes and basal lamina in the initial steps of angiogenesis in wound healing. 
Adult tonsillectomy. One hundred consecutive adult patients having tonsillectomy were carefully analysed with regard to preoperative history, operative findings and pathology. Follow-up was made at 1 and 3-year intervals, with particular reference to the patient's view of the outcome. Results of operation were compared with the clinical course of 100 age and sex-matched controls who had been on the waiting list for tonsillectomy for 2 or more years. These results are presented and a case is made for tonsillectomy in young adults as a valid and cost-effective procedure. 
Positron emission tomography in progressive supranuclear palsy. Positron emission tomography with 6-[18F]fluoro-L-dopa (6-FD) provides in vivo information on the function of nigrostriatal dopaminergic neurons. We used 6-FD and positron emission tomography to investigate the integrity of the nigrostriatal system in seven patients with progressive supranuclear palsy. All patients had axial hypertonia, vertical gaze palsy, and parkinsonian features. Dementia, pyramidal signs, and ataxia were seen in varying proportions. We analyzed the scans with a graphic method to calculate a steady-state 6-FD uptake rate constant for the whole striatum. Results were compared with those obtained in seven age-matched controls. As a group, the patients with progressive supranuclear palsy had reduced 6-FD uptake constants. The 6-FD uptake constant correlated inversely with the duration of the disease. Normal positron emission tographic findings in one patient with the shortest duration of symptoms suggests that in early progressive supranuclear palsy, parkinsonism may relate to dysfunction distal to the dopaminergic neurons. 
Cloning of a cellular factor, interleukin binding factor, that binds to NFAT-like motifs in the human immunodeficiency virus long terminal repeat. Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) gene expression is regulated by both general transcription factors and factors induced by activation of T lymphocytes such as NF-kappa B and the nuclear factor of activated T cells (NFAT). Within the HIV long terminal repeat (LTR), two purine-rich domains between nucleotides -283 and -195 have homology to a regulatory region found in the interleukin 2 promoter, which binds NFAT and other cellular factors. In the HIV LTR, this region has been demonstrated to have both positive and negative regulatory effects on HIV gene expression. In an attempt to clone genes encoding cellular factors that bind to these NFAT-like elements in the HIV LTR, we used lambda gt11 expression cloning with oligonucleotides corresponding to these binding motifs. A ubiquitously expressed cDNA encoding a 60-kDa protein, which we termed interleukin binding factor (ILF), binds specifically to these purine-rich motifs in the HIV LTR. This factor also binds to similar purine-rich motifs in the interleukin 2 promoter, through with lower affinity than to HIV LTR sequences. Sequence analysis reveals that the DNA binding domain of ILF has strong homology to the recently described fork head DNA binding domain found in the Drosophila homeotic protein fork head and a family of hepatocyte nuclear factors, HNF-3. Other domains found in ILF include a nucleotide binding site, an N-glycosylation motif, a signal for ubiquitin-mediated degradation, and a potential nuclear localization signal. These results describe a DNA binding protein that may be involved in both positive and negative regulation of important viral and cellular promoter elements. 
A comparison of multilesion percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty in elderly patients (greater than 70 years) and younger subjects. Results of multilesion percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA) were compared in 210 elderly patients (70 to 92 years, [group I] and 210 younger patients (40 to 69 years, [group II]. The elderly patients included more women (43% versus 24%) and patients with unstable angina (73% versus 55%). PTCA was successful in 87% of lesions in group I and in 94% in group II (p less than 0.001). Only circumflex artery dilatation was less successful in group I (78% versus 91%, p less than 0.002). PTCA was successful in all lesions of at least one vessel in 89% of group I patients and in 94% of group II patients (p less than 0.06). Successful dilatation of all lesions was achieved in 77% of group I and in 85% of group II patients (p less than 0.05). Complication rates were similar for both groups. These data demonstrate a high rate of success and safety in elderly patients undergoing multilesion PTCA despite the presence of several risk factors (advanced age, female sex, unstable angina). The lower PTCA success rate in these patients compared with younger subjects is almost entirely attributable to reduced success for circumflex artery lesions. 
Multilocular cystic renal cell carcinoma. Multilocular cystic renal cell carcinoma (MCRCC) appears to be a distinct subtype of renal cell carcinoma with characteristic gross and microscopic features. The authors' ten-year experience (1977-1987) included six cases of MCRCC that were followed for a minimum of two years, with neither recurrence nor metastasis observed in any of the cases. During this period, there were 855 urologic procedures for the upper urinary tract, with 256 neoplasms or cysts identified. These included 32 simple cysts, 41 transitional cell carcinomas, 133 renal cell carcinomas, 17 papillary renal cell carcinomas, and 33 miscellaneous tumors. Histologically, the MCRCCs were well-demarcated multicystic lesions containing variably sized aggregates of neoplastic clear cells showing grade 1 nuclear features and little or no mitotic activity. The cyst walls were densely fibrotic, and the lining was often devoid of epithelium. Flow-cytometric analysis performed in five of the six cases with the use of paraffin-embedded tissue showed the tumors to be diploid in all instances, with low proliferative activity. The authors believe that this tumor is a low-grade variant of renal cell carcinoma and should be studied further to determine appropriate therapy. 
Home parenteral nutrition for patients with inoperable malignant bowel obstruction. The use of home parenteral nutrition (HPN) in patients with inoperable malignant bowel obstruction (IMBO) is controversial. The efficacy, safety, and indications for HPN in these patients is uncertain, and its benefit is difficult to demonstrate. The records of 17 patients (9, ovarian cancer; 4, colon cancer; 4, other) with IMBO receiving HPN managed by the Nutrition Support Team (NST) at Yale-New Haven Hospital from 1980 to 1989 were reviewed. Median survival was 53 days and was longest in the two patients with appendiceal carcinomatosis (208 and 159 days), intermediate in patients with colon cancer (median 90 days), and shortest in patients with ovarian cancer (median 39 days). Survival was unrelated to age or sex. All patients died of their underlying disease; 82% of deaths occurred at home. Only one treatment-related complication requiring readmission occurred. Fourteen patients and their families (82%) perceived their therapy as highly beneficial or beneficial. The NST agreed with this assessment in 11 patients but did not share this perception in three patients. These three patients had a short duration of HPN (less than 25 days) or minimal rehabilitation. It is concluded that HPN for patients with IMBO is associated with a low complication rate, may be most beneficial for those patients with gastrointestinal tract primary tumors, and is usually perceived by patients and care providers as beneficial. HPN has palliative benefit and facilitates compassionate home care for carefully selected patients with IMBO. 
Successful treatment of a persistent cyst, developing after ovarian transposition, with leuprolide acetate. Persistent ovarian cysts are considered to be the most troublesome complication of ovarian transposition. Transabdominal drainage or surgical removal is often required. This paper reports the successful use of leuprolide acetate, a GnRH agonist, in the treatment of a symptomatic and persistent ovarian cyst which developed after ovarian transposition. The benefits of this therapy over others are discussed. 
Extracardiac vascular and neural lesions in the toxic oil syndrome. The toxic oil syndrome is a multisystemic disease caused by the ingestion of adulterated rapeseed oil. The basic lesion is a peculiar vasculitis that affects mainly the intima, showing the features of an endovasculitis. Vessels of every type and size are involved, affecting practically every organ. The vascular lesions begins with endothelial damage that varies from cellular swelling to cellular necrosis. It then progresses by mixed cellular inflammatory infiltration of the intima and, in some cases, of the media and adventitia. In some cases the infiltrate is rich in eosinophils and a few show foamy histiocytes. Proliferation of myointimal cells and in advanced stages fibroblastic proliferation causes narrowing or obliteration of the vascular lumen. Thromboembolic complications perpetuate the vascular lesion and compound the ischemia and parenchymal atrophy of several organs. The peripheral nerve lesions begin with an inflammatory neuropathy with lymphocytic perineuritis and progress to perineural fibrosis with secondary axonal degeneration. Skeletal muscle lesions exhibit an interstitial inflammatory myopathy at first, followed by a neurogenic muscular atrophy. A direct effect of unidentified toxic substances, possibly free radicals, may cause the endothelial lesion. Other factors, such as immunopathologic mechanisms of delayed hypersensitivity, may contribute to the progression of the vascular lesions. 
Free amino acid analysis of guinea pig perilymph: a possible clinical assay for the PLF enigma? Controversy prevails regarding the accuracy of the clinical diagnosis of perilymphatic fistula (PLF). The diagnosis of PLF has been based on the subjective evaluation of vestibular function tests and the intraoperative macroscopic visualization of "clear fluid" from the oval/round windows at the time of exploratory tympanotomy. However, the subjective visual characterization of PLF varies among observing surgeons. Furthermore, perilymph can be "contaminated" with serum, blood, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), and local anesthesia. This article presents a scientific biochemical microassay for the free amino acid profile of perilymph. Microaliquots of uncontaminated perilymph were sampled from the bilateral round windows (scala tympani) of 20 guinea pigs and analyzed for 19 free amino acid concentrations (FAAC) by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). These samples were compared with the FAAC of guinea pig serum samples. Perfect predictor value ranges were nonoverlapping for 12 of 19 free amino acids in perilymph vs. plasma. Amino acid microassay of middle ear fluid for verification of "true" perilymph vs. nonperilymph fluids by the identification of nonoverlapping FAA markers may allow scientific verification of the existence of PLF in "suspected" patients. 
Ornipressin in the treatment of functional renal failure in decompensated liver cirrhosis. Effects on renal hemodynamics and atrial natriuretic factor. In 11 patients with decompensated cirrhosis and deteriorating renal function, the effect of the vasoconstrictor substance 8-ornithin vasopressin (ornipressin; POR 8; Sandoz, Basel, Switzerland) on renal function, hemodynamic parameters, and humoral mediators was studied. Ornipressin was infused at a dose of 6 IU/h over a period of 4 hours. During ornipressin infusion an improvement of renal function was achieved as indicated by significant increases in inulin clearance (+65%), paraaminohippuric acid clearance (+49%), urine volume (+45%), sodium excretion (+259%), and fractional elimination of sodium (+130%). The hyperdynamic circulation was reversed to a nearly normal circulatory state. The increase in systemic vascular resistance (+60%) coincided with a decrease of a previously elevated renal vascular resistance (-27%) and increase in renal blood flow (+44%). The renal fraction of the cardiac output increased from 2.3% to 4.7% (P less than 0.05). A decline of the elevated plasma levels of noradrenaline (2.08-1.13 ng/mL; P less than 0.01) and renin activity (27.6-14.2 ng.mL-1.h-1; P less than 0.01) was achieved. The plasma concentration of the atrial natriuretic factor increased in most of the patients, but slightly decreased in 3 patients. The decrease of renal vascular resistance and the increase of renal blood flow and of the renal fraction of cardiac output play a key role in the beneficial effect of ornipressin on renal failure. These changes develop by an increase in mean arterial pressure, the reduction of the sympathetic activity, and probably of an extenuation of the splanchnic vasodilation. A significant contribution of atrial natriuretic factor is less likely. The present findings implicate that treatment with ornipressin represents an alternative approach to the management of functional renal failure in advanced liver cirrhosis. 
A t(4;22) in a meningioma points to the localization of a putative tumor-suppressor gene. Cytogenetic analysis of meningioma cells from one particular patient (MN32) displayed the stem-line karyo-type 45, XY, -1, 4p+, 22q-, 22q+, which thus had rearrangements of both chromosomes 22. The 22q+ marker appeared as a dicentric: 22 pter----q11::1p11----qter. The reciprocal product of this translocation has presumably been lost because it lacked a centromere. The 22q- chromosome also appeared to have lost sequences distal to band q11. We assumed that this marker could have been the result of a reciprocal translocation between chromosomes 4 and 22. To investigate the 4p+ and 22q- chromosomes in more detail, human-hamster somatic cell hybrids were constructed that segregated the 22q- and 4p+ chromosomes. Southern blot analysis with DNA from these hybrids showed that sequences from 22q were indeed translocated to 4p+ and that reciprocally sequences from 4p were translocated to 22q-, demonstrating a balanced t(4;22)(p16;q11). On the basis of these results we presume that in this tumor a tumor-suppressor gene is deleted in the case of the 22q+ marker and that the t(4;22) disrupts the second allele of this gene. The latter translocation was mapped between D22S1 and D22S15, a distance of 1 cM on the linkage map of this chromosome. The area in which we have located the translocation is within the region where the gene predisposing to neurofibromatosis 2 has been mapped. 
Allodynia-like effects in rat after ischaemic spinal cord injury photochemically induced by laser irradiation. We report behaviours suggesting the presence of allodynia elicited by non-noxious brushing and mechanical pressure following photochemically induced ischaemic spinal cord injury in the rat. Female rats were intravenously injected with Erythrosin B and the T10 vertebra was irradiated with a laser beam for 1, 5 or 10 min. These procedures initiated an intravascular photochemical reaction, resulting in ischaemic spinal cord injury. After irradiation a clear allodynia was observed in most rats. The animals vocalized intensely to light touch during gentle handling and were clearly agitated to light brushing of the flanks. The vocalization threshold in response to the mechanical pressure measured with von Frey hairs was markedly decreased during this period. In some animals the existence of spontaneous pain was suggested by spontaneous vocalization. The duration of the allodynia varied among animals from several hours to several days. The severity and duration of allodynia seemed not to be related to the duration of irradiation. In sham-operated rats a slight, transient allodynia was also noted around the wound within a few hours after surgery, which was effectively relieved by systemic morphine (2 mg/kg, i.p.). Morphine (2 mg/kg, i.p.) also partially relieved the allodynia in spinally injured rats 4 h after irradiation. However, morphine, even at a higher dose (5 mg/kg, i.p.), failed to alleviate the allodynia in spinally injured rats 24-48 h after the injury. Systemic injection of the GABAB agonist baclofen (0.01-0.1 mg/kg, i.p.), but not the GABAA agonist muscimol (1 mg/kg, i.p.), effectively relieved allodynia during this period. Pretreatment with guanethidine 24 h and just prior to the irradiation (20 mg/kg, s.c.) did not prevent the occurrence of allodynia in spinal cord injured rats. The present observation is the first to show that ischaemic spinal cord injury could result in cutaneous mechanical allodynia. This phenomenon is resistant to morphine and may not involve the sympathetic system. Histological examination of allodynic animals 3 days after spinal cord injury revealed considerable morphological damage in the dorsal spinal cord of a rat irradiated for 5 min. The related dorsal roots were also slightly affected in this animal, while the dorsal root ganglia were normal. However, in rats irradiated for 1 min, despite the existence of strong allodynia, no damage could be found at this time in the spinal cord, dorsal roots or dorsal root ganglia. It is suggested that functional deficits in the GABAB system in the spinal cord may be related to this allodynia-like phenomenon.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS). 
Early surgical management of extensive gynecologic ureteral injuries. Early ureteral reconstruction was performed during the immediate postoperative period upon 12 patients who sustained ureteral injuries secondary to gynecologic surgical procedures. The injuries occurred postoperatively for benign disease: endometriosis in one patient, fibrosis in eight patients and tubo-ovarian abscess in one patient. In three instances, portions of the ureter were noted in the pathologic specimen. After unsuccessful attempts at retrograde catheterization or stenting, all ureteral injuries were explored within three weeks of the primary gynecologic operation. Ureteral reconstruction was successful in all. The advantages of early operative intervention versus endoscopic or delayed operative intervention, or both, are discussed. 
Migraine equivalents and complicated migraine. Migraine equivalents and complicated migraine are entities in which definition is difficult, presentations are pleomorphic, diagnosis is treacherous, pathophysiology is obscure, and treatment is uncertain. A useful principle is to regard them as diagnoses of exclusion that require aggressive and comprehensive investigation. Rational treatment consists of migraine prophylaxis using agents with minimal vasospastic potential and, in some cases, acetylsalicylic acid for platelet disaggregation. The prognosis for both complicated migraine and migraine equivalents is good; when patients with these diagnoses come to harm, it is often because the diagnosis is incorrect. 
Acanthosis nigricans and a rectal carcinoid. Malignant acanthosis nigricans is often related to adenocarcinomas of the gastrointestinal tract, but it has also been found to coexist with tumors of the amine precursor uptake and decarboxylation system. It can precede, accompany, or follow the appearance of the underlying tumor. Evaluation of our patient's new-onset acanthosis nigricans led to the discovery of an asymptomatic rectal carcinoid tumor. To our knowledge, this is the first report of acanthosis nigricans associated with a carcinoid tumor of the rectum. It emphasizes the importance of considering underlying malignancy in the evaluation of patients with acanthosis nigricans. 
Positron tomographic assessment of 16 alpha-[18F] fluoro-17 beta-estradiol uptake in metastatic breast carcinoma. The positron-emitting estrogenic steroid 16 alpha-[18F]fluoro-17 beta-estradiol (FES) has been shown to exhibit selective uptake in primary breast carcinomas; the uptake of tracer by positron emission tomography (PET) is strongly correlated with the tumor estrogen-receptor concentration. We have now extended the use of this radiopharmaceutical for imaging of metastases of breast carcinoma by PET in 16 patients with clinical or radiographic evidence of metastatic disease. Increased uptake of FES was identified on PET images in 53 of 57 metastatic lesions (93%); only two apparent false-positive foci of FES uptake were seen. In seven of the patients, evaluable PET studies were obtained both before and after initiation of antiestrogen therapy. In all cases, there was a decrease in FES uptake in the tumor deposits after initiation of antiestrogen therapy, and the mean (+/- standard deviation) uptake decreased from 2.22 (+/- 1.23) to 0.80 (+/- 0.42) x 10(3)+ dose/ml. These results indicate that PET with FES has high sensitivity and specificity for detecting metastatic breast carcinoma and provide additional confirmatory evidence that the tumor uptake of this ligand is a receptor-mediated process. 
Catheter ablation of accessory atrioventricular pathways (Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome) by radiofrequency current BACKGROUND. Surgical or catheter ablation of accessory pathways by means of high-energy shocks serves as definitive therapy for patients with Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome but has substantial associated morbidity and mortality. Radiofrequency current, an alternative energy source for ablation, produces smaller lesions without adverse effects remote from the site where current is delivered. We conducted this study to develop catheter techniques for delivering radiofrequency current to reduce morbidity and mortality associated with accessory-pathway ablation. METHODS. Radiofrequency current (mean power, 30.9 +/- 5.3 W) was applied through a catheter electrode positioned against the mitral or tricuspid annulus or a branch of the coronary sinus; when possible, delivery was guided by catheter recordings of accessory-pathway activation. Ablation was attempted in 166 patients with 177 accessory pathways (106 pathways in the left free wall, 13 in the anteroseptal region, 43 in the posteroseptal region, and 15 in the right free wall). RESULTS. Accessory-pathway conduction was eliminated in 164 of 166 patients (99 percent) by a median of three applications of radiofrequency current. During a mean follow-up (+/- SD) of 8.0 +/- 5.4 months, preexcitation or atrioventricular reentrant tachycardia returned in 15 patients (9 percent). All underwent a second, successful ablation. Electrophysiologic study 3.1 +/- 1.9 months after ablation in 75 patients verified the absence of accessory-pathway conduction in all. Complications of radiofrequency-current application occurred in three patients (1.8 percent): atrioventricular block (one patient), pericarditis (one), and cardiac tamponade (one) after radiofrequency current was applied in a small branch of the coronary sinus. CONCLUSIONS. Radiofrequency current is highly effective in ablating accessory pathways, with low morbidity and no mortality. 
Beneficial effects of yohimbine on posthypoxic recovery of cardiac function and myocardial metabolism in isolated perfused rabbit hearts. The present study was undertaken to elucidate the possible actions of yohimbine on cardiac function and metabolism in the hypoxic and subsequently reoxygenated myocardium. For this purpose, rabbit hearts were perfused for 20 min under hypoxic conditions, followed by 45 min reoxygenated perfusion, and their functional and metabolic alterations with and without yohimbine treatment were examined. Hypoxia induced cessation of cardiac contractile force, rise in resting tension and depletion of tissue high-energy phosphates, which were poorly recovered by subsequent reoxygenation. Hypoxia also induced release of creatine kinase and ATP metabolites from perfused hearts and increases in tissue calcium and sodium contents, which were further enhanced upon subsequent reoxygenation. When hypoxic hearts were treated with 3 to 30 microM yohimbine, several beneficial effects were observed in a concentration-dependent manner. This included enhancement of posthypoxic recovery of contractile function and suppression of the hypoxia- and reoxygenation-induced rise in resting tension. Hypoxia/reoxygenation-induced release of ATP metabolites was inhibited and restoration of myocardial high-energy phosphates enhanced. Inhibition of reoxygenation-induced rise in tissue calcium and sodium and creatine kinase release were also noted. The findings suggest that suppression of transmembrane flux of ions, substrates and enzymes during hypoxia/reoxygenation plays a role in the posthypoxic functional and metabolic recovery. Yohimbine (3-30 microM) significantly depressed the maximal stimulus frequency the left atria could follow. These results suggest a close relationship between depression in the maximal driving frequency of atria and enhancement of the posthypoxic contractile and metabolic recovery of perfused hearts. 
Determinants of successful transthoracic defibrillation and outcome in ventricular fibrillation. OBJECTIVE--To examine factors determining defibrillation success and outcome in patients with ventricular fibrillation. DESIGN--Observational prospective study of age, sex, transthoracic impedance, site of cardiac arrest, ventricular fibrillation duration and amplitude, primary or secondary ventricular fibrillation, aetiology, number of shocks to correct ventricular fibrillation, and drug treatment. SETTING--A teaching hospital and a mobile coronary care unit with a physician. PATIENTS--70 consecutive patients (50 male, 20 female) mean age 66.5 years. INTERVENTIONS--Before the first countershock was administered transthoracic impedance using a 30 kHz low amplitude AC current passed through 8 cm/12 cm self-adhesive defibrillator electrode pads applied in the anteroapical position was measured. The first two shocks were 200 J delivered energy (low energy) and further shocks of 360 J (high energy) were given if required. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES--Countershock success and outcome from ventricular fibrillation. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS--First shock success was significantly greater in inhospital arrests (37/53) than in out-of-hospital arrests (5/17) and in those receiving antiarrhythmic treatment (13/15, 86.7%) v (27/51, 52.9%). Transthoracic impedance was similar in those who were successfully defibrillated with one or two 200 J shocks (98.7 (26) omega) and those who required one or more 360 J shocks (91.4 (23) omega). Success rates with two 200 J shocks were similar in those patients with "high" transthoracic impedance (that is, greater than 115 omega) and those with transthoracic impedance (less than or equal to 115 omega) (8/12 (67%) v 44/58 (76%]. Fine ventricular fibrillation was significantly more common in the patients with a transthoracic impedance of greater than 95 omega (41% (13/32] than in those with a transthoracic impedance less than or equal to 95 omega (13% (5/38]. Death during arrest was significantly more common in patients who needed high energy shocks (14/18 (78%] than in those who needed low energy shocks (16/52 (31%]. Multiple regression analysis identified ventricular fibrillation with an amplitude of greater than or equal to 0.5 mV, age less than or equal to 70 years, and arrests that needed less than or equal to two shocks for defibrillation, in rank order as independent predictors of survival to discharge. 
Spontaneous thrombosis of iatrogenic femoral artery pseudoaneurysms: documentation with color Doppler and two-dimensional ultrasonography. Two-dimensional ultrasonography and color Doppler were used over an 18-month period for the diagnosis and management of femoral artery pseudoaneurysms in six patients with pulsatile groin masses found after catheterization. A diagnosis of pseudoaneurysm was made when color Doppler demonstrated pulsatile systolic flow into echolucent masses. One patient underwent surgical repair of a symptomatic pseudoaneurysm after the initial Doppler study. Serial color Doppler studies were performed in five subjects, all of whom showed resolution of flow after a mean of 18 days (range 7 to 42). Despite an absence of flow, one patient underwent surgical drainage of persistent hematoma. After a mean interval of 233 days (range 84 to 552) all patients have remained free of other complications or symptoms related to the pseudoaneurysm. This experience suggests that urgent surgical repair is not required in all cases of small iatrogenic pseudoaneurysms, and that asymptomatic patients can be safely followed with serial color Doppler examinations. 
Combined pterional-anterolateral approaches to cranial base tumors. Advanced tumors of the paranasal sinuses, parotid gland, orbit, parapharynx, and cranial cavity may invade the infratemporal fossa by direct extension or through natural anatomic pathways. The inability to control disease involving this region is reflected by the unacceptably high recurrence rates for both intracranial and extracranial neoplasms. Between 1983 and 1986, a pterional (or subtemporal) approach was combined with such conventional anterolateral procedures as a mandibulopharyngectomy, maxillectomy, orbitectomy, and parotidectomy in 13 patients with advanced skull base lesions. The tumor origin was extracranial in ten cases and intracranial in three patients. Seven of the neoplasms were malignant and six were histologically benign. Complete tumor removal was achieved in all patients. Repair of the ablative defect was achieved with a temporalis myogenous flap in ten patients, and primary closure or distant myocutaneous flaps in the remaining three patients. Postoperative complications included three lateral nasocutaneous fistulae secondary to temporalis myogenous flap necrosis and isolated cases of stroke, cerebral edema, pneumocephalus, and cerebrospinal fluid rhinorrhea. Twelve patients are alive without evidence of disease at a mean interval of 25 months. The remaining patient died from lung metastases 11 months after surgery. 
Mucocele-like tumors of the breast. Cytologic findings in two cases. Mucocele-like tumors of the breast originally were reported by Rosen in 1986 as benign lesions that histologically resembled colloid carcinoma of the breast. The authors document two cases of mucocele-like tumors to illustrate the difficulty in separating these lesions from colloid carcinoma on the basis of fine-needle aspiration biopsy. Cytologically, mucocele-like tumors contained abundant mucin, few clusters, and sheets of regular epithelium that lacked nuclear atypia, and they contained no intact single cells. The authors recommend open surgical biopsy when fine-needle aspiration biopsy findings in such cases are equivocal. 
Limitations of thrombolytic therapy for acute myocardial infarction complicated by congestive heart failure and cardiogenic shock. As many as one quarter of patients treated with thrombolytic therapy present with congestive heart failure or cardiogenic shock. Although thrombolytic therapy has been shown to limit infarct size, preserve left ventricular ejection fraction and decrease mortality in most subgroups of patients, no apparent benefit has been demonstrated in patients with clinical left ventricular dysfunction. The lack of correlation between ejection fraction and other measurements of left ventricular dysfunction such as exercise time, cardiac output, filling pressures, activation of the neurohumoral system and regional perfusion bed abnormalities may partly explain this paradox. Alternatively, lower perfusion rates, higher reocclusion rates, associated mechanical complications or completed infarction may explain these findings. Preliminary data indicate that emergency coronary angioplasty or bypass graft surgery improves survival in selected patients with cardiogenic shock. Because these findings suggest that restoration of infarct artery patency is especially important in patients with clinical left ventricular dysfunction, additional studies are needed in these patients to investigate the potential benefit that new thrombolytic strategies, inotropic or vasodilator agents or intraaortic balloon counterpulsation might offer by augmenting coronary blood flow and improving reperfusion rates. Currently, acute mechanical revascularization should be considered for patients who present with congestive heart failure associated with hypotension or tachycardia and for patients with cardiogenic shock. 
IIB osteosarcoma. Current management, local control, and survival statistics--the Australian experience. Current management of osteosarcoma at the authors' institution involves intraarterial induction chemotherapy using intermittent cycles of cisplatin and doxorubicin (Adriamycin), surgical resection with limb-sparing wherever possible, and adjuvant systemic chemotherapy (high-dose methotrexate with retrieval and doxorubicin). Twenty cases treated in this way between May 1983 and May 1989 are reviewed. There were 18 Stage IIB osteosarcomas and two Stage IIB malignant fibrous histiocytomas. Chemotherapeutic effect was evaluated in the resected tumors. There was little correlation between the clinical response to the induction chemotherapy and cell necrosis present in the resected tumor mass. Wide resection margins were achieved in 17 cases, a minimal margin in two, and a contaminated margin in one. Radiotherapy was used in these three cases where resection margin was in doubt. There were two local recurrences in these three cases. Four patients have died of their disease, and there was one treatment-related death. Overall probability of survival in this group of 20 patients has been expressed by the Kaplan-Meier method as 58%. 
Germ cell tumors masquerading as central nervous system sarcoidosis. The diagnosis of central nervous system sarcoidosis is uncertain without typical multisystem involvement. We describe two patients with isolated central nervous system mass lesions whose biopsy results were consistent with sarcoidosis. After a progressive clinical course, they were found to have diencephalic germinomas. Germ cell tumors, in particular, should be considered in the differential diagnosis of central nervous system sarcoidosis as they are potentially treatable, occur in intracranial locations favored by sarcoidosis mass lesions, and may be surrounded by granulomatous inflammation that can be mistaken for the noncaseating granulomas of sarcoidosis. 
Glucose tolerance and insulin action in rats with renovascular hypertension. To test whether hypertension can cause hyperinsulinemia or insulin resistance, we performed intravenous glucose tolerance tests at 1 month and euglycemic clamps at 3 months after induction of two-kidney, one clip renovascular hypertension in rats. At 1 month, systolic pressure was higher in 21 clipped than in 12 control animals (161 +/- 5 mm Hg, range 134-187 mm Hg versus 119 +/- 3 mm Hg, range 108-146 mm Hg; p less than 0.001). Glucose tolerance, assessed as the glucose fractional disappearance rate between 3 and 11 minutes after the glucose injection, was similar in the clipped and sham groups (0.059 +/- 0.002 versus 0.056 +/- 0.002 min-1, respectively; p greater than 0.4). The total area under the insulin curve during glucose tolerance tests was also similar in the clipped and sham groups (926 +/- 95 versus 869 +/- 126 microunits/ml x min; p greater than 0.4). There was no significant relation between systolic blood pressure and insulin area during glucose tolerance tests in the clipped group, but there was a positive rectilinear relation in the control group (r = 0.66; p = 0.01). Fourteen animals had euglycemic clamps 2 months after glucose tolerance tests. At that time, systolic pressure (direct femoral measurement) was higher in the seven clipped animals (189 +/- 13 mm Hg versus 122 +/- 5 mm Hg in controls; p less than 0.001). Insulin infusions of 1 and 4 milliunits/min/kg body wt effected similar plasma insulin levels in the two groups. 
Osteogenic sarcoma: MR signal abnormalities of the brain in asymptomatic patients treated with high-dose methotrexate. The advent of lesions with high signal intensity in periventricular white matter was incidentally observed on T2-weighted images in one patient who underwent magnetic resonance (MR) imaging of the brain after administration of high-dose methotrexate (HDMTX) for osteogenic sarcoma. Twenty-one additional symptom-free patients who had been treated with the same regimen and 10 patients who had undergone cisplatin-based chemotherapy for testicular cancer also underwent examination. Fourteen of the patients with osteosarcoma showed high-signal-intensity lesions in white matter on T2-weighted images. The interval between the last course of chemotherapy and MR imaging was a factor in this finding, as 12 of 14 patients who underwent examination within 2 years after chemotherapy had a positive finding, as opposed to two of eight patients who underwent examination later. The patients with testicular cancer had normal MR images. The occurrence of MR imaging abnormalities in asymptomatic patients treated with HDMTX for osteogenic sarcoma may be subclinical evidence of treatment-related central nervous system toxicity. 
Beta-galactosidase tablets in the treatment of lactose intolerance in pediatrics. Lactose-intolerant children manifest diminished or nonexistent intestinal lactase activity, resulting in flatulence, abdominal pain, and diarrhea. To assess the hydrolytic capability of lactase-containing tablets taken immediately before oral lactose challenge, we studied 18 children previously identified as being lactose intolerant and having no underlying organic gastrointestinal disease. Subjects had a mean (+/- SEM) age of 11.4 +/- 3.4 years; 72% were male. At time of the study, lactase-containing tablets or placebo tablets were ingested (double-blind) immediately before drinking a solution of lactose. Breath samples were obtained for hydrogen analysis at 30-minute intervals during a 2-hour period, and clinical symptoms were monitored. In lactose-intolerant patients, hydrogen production was significantly greater following placebo (maximum hydrogen excretion, approximately 60 ppm) compared with lactase-containing tablets (maximum hydrogen excretion, 7 ppm). Increased hydrogen production was associated with clinical symptoms including abdominal pain (89% of subjects following placebo ingestion), bloating (83%), diarrhea (61%), and flatulence (44%). These results indicate, therefore, that coingestion of lactose and lactase-containing tablets significantly reduces both breath hydrogen excretion and clinical symptoms associated with lactose intolerance. 
Ovarian carcinoma metastatic to the breast and axillary node. Breast cancer is a common primary malignancy in women. On rare occasion the breast is also the site of metastatic disease. This report describes the evaluation of breast and axillary masses in a patient with known ovarian cancer, including the radiographic evaluation and special immunohistochemical stains with CA-125. Flow cytometric determinations and hormonal receptor analysis on both the primary and metastatic tumors demonstrate similar biologic characteristics. Both tumor sites demonstrated positive CA-125 staining, aneuploid DNA populations, moderately positive estrogen receptor content, and negative progesterone receptors. The mammogram demonstrated a well-circumscribed lesion with several areas of microcalcifications. Blood-borne metastasis from the ovary to the breast can show a varied clinical picture that can be differentiated from that of a primary breast carcinoma. 
Review of the secondary injury theory of acute spinal cord trauma with emphasis on vascular mechanisms. In patients with spinal cord injury, the primary or mechanical trauma seldom causes total transection, even though the functional loss may be complete. In addition, biochemical and pathological changes in the cord may worsen after injury. To explain these phenomena, the concept of the secondary injury has evolved for which numerous pathophysiological mechanisms have been postulated. This paper reviews the concept of secondary injury with special emphasis on vascular mechanisms. Evidence is presented to support the theory of secondary injury and the hypothesis that a key mechanism is posttraumatic ischemia with resultant infarction of the spinal cord. Evidence for the role of vascular mechanisms has been obtained from a variety of models of acute spinal cord injury in several species. Many different angiographic methods have been used for assessing microcirculation of the cord and for measuring spinal cord blood flow after trauma. With these techniques, the major systemic and local vascular effects of acute spinal cord injury have been identified and implicated in the etiology of secondary injury. The systemic effects of acute spinal cord injury include hypotension and reduced cardiac output. The local effects include loss of autoregulation in the injured segment of the spinal cord and a marked reduction of the microcirculation in both gray and white matter, especially in hemorrhagic regions and in adjacent zones. The microcirculatory loss extends for a considerable distance proximal and distal to the site of injury. Many studies have shown a dose-dependent reduction of spinal cord blood flow varying with the severity of injury, and a reduction of spinal cord blood flow which worsens with time after injury. The functional deficits due to acute spinal cord injury have been measured electrophysiologically with techniques such as motor and somatosensory evoked potentials and have been found proportional to the degree of posttraumatic ischemia. The histological effects include early hemorrhagic necrosis leading to major infarction at the injury site. These posttraumatic vascular effects can be treated. Systemic normotension can be restored with volume expansion or vasopressors, and spinal cord blood flow can be improved with dopamine, steroids, nimodipine, or volume expansion. The combination of nimodipine and volume expansion improves posttraumatic spinal cord blood flow and spinal cord function measured by evoked potentials. These results provide strong evidence that posttraumatic ischemia is an important secondary mechanism of injury, and that it can be counteracted. 
Treatable blindness in temporal arteritis. Temporal arteritis is a common cause of blindness. Prompt steroid treatment limits unilateral visual loss while protecting the contralateral eye. Established blindness is irreversible. We report a case of temporal arteritis in which an eye with no light perception secondary to an arteritic anterior ischaemic optic neuropathy regained 6/6 vision. 
Endoscopic diverticulotomy for the treatment of Zenker's diverticulum. First described by Mosher in 1916, endoscopic treatment of Zenker's diverticulum has since been reported infrequently in the surgical literature and continues to engender controversy. Between 1978 and 1989, we treated 11 unselected patients surgically for pharyngoesophageal diverticula. Endoscopic diverticulotomy was used in 11 patients and an external approach was used in the others. The endoscopically treated patients had no serious complications, resumed oral intake early, and were discharged from the hospital earlier. Our review of the surgical literature confirmed our experience with the efficacy and safety of the procedure. We therefore recommend endoscopic diverticulotomy as being equal to external approaches with regard to effectiveness; and it affords the patient a shortened hospital stay and more rapid return to to the premorbid state. 
Results of treatment with high intensity, brief duration chemotherapy in poor prognosis non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. A novel chemotherapeutic approach was designed for the treatment of intermediate and high-grade histology non-Hodgkin's lymphoma using augmented (but subtransplantation) doses of chemotherapy administered at frequent intervals in the inpatient setting. For the initial evaluation of this regimen, poor prognosis patients were treated with a projected long-term survival rate of less than 25% in response to standard therapy. Between March 1982 and May 1988, 56 previously untreated patients were entered into this study; all patients had either high-grade histology (20 patients) or predominantly large cell lymphoma (36 patients). Median age was 41.5 years (range, 18 to 69 years). Poor prognosis features included: Stage IV, 71%; poor performance status (Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group scale, 2 to 4), 55%; multiple extranodal sites of disease, 52%; elevated lactic dehydrogenase (greater than 300 IU/l), 43%; and bulky (greater than 10 cm) tumor masses, 30%. Thirty-three of 56 patients (59%) were in Shipp's Category 3. During the 6-year study, the chemotherapy regimen was modified in an attempt to improve efficacy and reduce toxicity. However, most patients received a 2-month course of therapy as follows: cyclophosphamide 1500 mg/m2 intravenously (IV) on days 1, 2, and 29; etoposide 400 mg/m2 IV on days 1, 2, and 3 and 100 mg/m2 on days 29, 30, 31; doxorubicin 45 mg/m2 IV on days 29, 30; vincristine 1.4 mg/m2 IV on days 8, 22, 36, and 50; bleomycin 10 units/m2 IV on days 8, 22, 36, and 50; methotrexate 200 mg/m2 IV on days 15 and 43 followed 24 hours later by leucovorin 15 mg/m2 IV every 6 hours for six doses; and prednisone 60 mg/m2 orally on days 1 to 7 and 29 to 35. The complete response (CR) rate was 77% (95% confidence interval, 64% to 86%). There were ten relapses, only one of which occurred after 18 months of follow-up. Overall event-free survival (EFS) was 52% (95% confidence interval, 36% to 68%), with a median follow-up of 36 months. Eleven of 13 patients with small noncleaved lymphoma had CR; actuarial EFS in this subgroup was 61%. Myelosuppression occurred in all patients, with severe leukopenia (less than 1000/microliters) lasting a median of 12 days (range, 3 to 29 days); toxic deaths occurred in five patients (9%; 95% confidence interval, 4% to 19%). This intensive approach improved the response and survival of very poor risk non-Hodgkin's lymphoma patients. 
Management options in fulminant hepatic failure. The diagnosis of FHF carries with it a high mortality rate. Though the early results of OLT for FHF are encouraging, some have called for caution as these results are in a select population and may be similar to the optimistic early reports of now-discredited therapies. However, OLT differs fundamentally from all other interventions and, as such, it is ethically unjustified to withhold potentially life-saving therapy from patients with a predicted mortality in excess of 60%. Therefore, patients with FHF should be transferred at an early stage to an experienced liver unit where the option of liver transplantation can be considered. 
Total acromionectomy. A twenty-year review. Thirty-five patients (thirty-eight shoulders) were treated consecutively with a total acromionectomy between 1969 and 1989. At a minimum of two years (average, five years and eight months) after the operation, thirty-one patients (thirty-four shoulders) were available for review. The results, which were rated on the basis of pain, function, range of motion, strength, and the satisfaction of the patient, were excellent for twenty-five shoulders, good for four, fair for three, and poor for one. Four of the five least satisfactory results were in patients who had had a long-standing massive tear of the rotator cuff. This study was done to separate the criticism of the operative procedure of total acromionectomy from an avoidable complication of that procedure, retraction of the deltoid, and to describe the specific advantages and satisfactory results that occur when that complication is avoided. It is my opinion that failure to repair the deltoid adequately results in retraction of that muscle, and that this avoidable complication is responsible for the unfavorable reputation of total acromionectomy. 
Ovarian cancer screening in asymptomatic postmenopausal women by transvaginal sonography. From November 1987 to January 1991, 1300 postmenopausal women underwent screening with transvaginal sonography (TVS). Women eligible for screening were all asymptomatic with no known ovarian tumors. Ovarian volume was calculated using the prolate ellipsoid formula, and a value in excess of 8.0 cm3 was considered abnormal. Ovarian abnormalities were detected in 33 women (2.5%), and 27 underwent exploratory laparotomy. Ovarian tumors were noted in all 27 patients, including 2 primary carcinomas and 14 serous cystadenomas. The two women with ovarian carcinomas had normal results of pelvic examinations and normal serum CA-125 levels. Both women had Stage I disease, and are alive and well after conventional therapy. TVS was time efficient, easy to perform, and well-accepted by patients. Currently, there are more than 3000 patient years of follow-up in the screened population, and there have been no deaths due to ovarian cancer. A multi-institutional trial to determine the efficacy of TVS as a screening method for ovarian cancer is indicated. 
Recent advances in MR imaging/spectroscopy of cerebral ischemia. Recent advances in high-resolution MR imaging and multinuclear spectroscopy have stimulated studies of the functional relationships between tissue hypoperfusion, cellular energy depletion, and brain edema associated with cerebral ischemia. The very slow (microns/sec) random translational motion of water protons in various brain tissues and intracranial fluid compartments can now be assessed with MR diffusion imaging. More slowly diffusing protons in ischemic tissues can be differentiated from normal parenchyma, CSF, and flowing blood, enabling the detection and localization of ischemic regions within minutes of the onset of stroke. Perfusion imaging "snapshots," obtained in as little as 25 msec with echoplanar MR methods, permit the evaluation of tissue washin/washout kinetics of contrast agents in the microvasculature, and thus the quantification of brain perfusion on a regional basis. Also, delineation of major intra- and extracranial arterial and venous structures with MR angiography, acquired with two- or three-dimensional Fourier transformation techniques, has enabled accurate noninvasive assessments of vascular occlusive disease. Finally, improvements in MR spectroscopic techniques have facilitated investigations of metabolic regulation and bioenergetics in experimental animal models of cerebral ischemia, as well as in stroke patients. Combined MR imaging and spectroscopy will likely play an important role in differentiating reversibly from irreversibly ischemic brain tissues and in the investigation of various neuroprotective pharmaceuticals. 
The mermaid malformation: cloacal exstrophy and occult spinal dysraphism. Five infants with cloacal exstrophy underwent neurological evaluation and radiographic examination of the caudal spine shortly after birth. Each was found to have occult spinal dysraphism. Four had terminal myelocystoceles, and one had a lipomyelomeningocele. Pathological anatomy was confirmed during surgery for the release of the tethered spinal cords. The striking association between cloacal exstrophy and occult spinal dysraphism suggests a common developmental defect in the caudal pole of the embryo. A hypothesis is offered to explain this association. Terminal myelocystocele and lipomyelomeningocele appear to be part of a continuum of lesions associated with skin-covered spina bifida. 
Enhancement of the protective qualities of gastric mucus by sucralfate: role of phosphoinositides. The effects of intragastric administration of sucralfate on the physicochemical properties of gastric mucus, and the mechanism of its protective action against alcohol-induced mucosal injury were investigated using in vivo and in vitro models. The experiments in vivo were conducted with groups of rats receiving a dose of 100 mg sucralfate twice daily for 5 consecutive days. The animals were sacrificed 16 hours after the last dose, their stomachs dissected, and the mucosa subjected to physicochemical measurements. In the in vitro studies, gastric mucosa was cultured in the presence of sucralfate, ethanol, or both. The in vivo results revealed that sucralfate elicited an 8% increase in mucus gel dimension, while its sulfo- and sialomucin content increased by 63% and 81%, respectively. The changes in mucus gel mucin content with sucralfate were accompanied by a 9.5% increase in mucus hydrogen ion (H+) retardation capacity, 1.9-fold increase in viscosity, and a 60% increase in the gel hydrophobicity. The mucus elaborated in the presence of sucralfate exhibited 14% lower protein content and 62% higher content of carbohydrate than that of control, and contained more neutral lipids. Furthermore, the gastric mucus of the sucralfate group showed a marked increase in mucus glycoprotein polymeric form. The data obtained with gastric mucosal culture demonstrated that sucralfate elicited a significant increase in mucin synthesis, which was reflected in the enhanced metabolism of mucosal phosphoinositides. In contrast, ethanol, which exhibited detrimental effects on mucin synthesis, also caused alterations in the phosphoinositide signal pathway. The changes in mucin and phosphoinositide distribution patterns evoked by ethanol were prevented by sucralfate. Our results suggest that the mucosal strengthening action of sucralfate occurs through the stimulation of the metabolism of phosphoinositide-derived messenger molecules. 
The treatment of multiple intracranial tuberculous abscesses: a case report. A Chinese female aged 2 years 8 months with tuberculous meningitis developed hydrocephalus requiring insertion of a ventriculoperitoneal shunt. After adequate anti-tuberculosis chemotherapy for 14 weeks, multiple intracranial tuberculous abscesses developed. The lesions increased in size and number accompanied by clinical deterioration. Repeated drainage operations were performed in view of the increased intracranial pressure. The child made a remarkable recovery after an initial stormy course. 
An analysis of thirty cases of orbital lymphangioma. Pathophysiologic considerations and management recommendations. Thirty cases of orbital lymphangioma were reviewed. Clinical, imaging, and microscopic findings were integrated to develop a pathophysiologic construct and management guidelines. The basic lesion might be considered an abortive vascular system which arborizes among normal structures. Intrinsic hemorrhage expands portions of the small-caliber network into large blood cysts, prompting clinical recognition. While major hemorrhage led to early surgery in 12 cases, long pretreatment intervals could be analyzed in 17 others. Twelve patients had second hemorrhages of varied magnitude, from 2 weeks to 15 years after initial recognition; five patients did not in an average of 6.8 years. Some blood cysts contracted spontaneously. Among 23 operated cases, 12 patients had major new bleeds from 4 days to 12 years after initial surgery; 11 patients did not in an average of 4.2 years. Poor final visual acuity was associated with multiple surgeries. The authors advocate conservatism in surgical case selection and in operative dissection. 
Clinical and pharmacokinetic basis for the antimicrobial treatment of acute otitis media. Given the astonishing frequency in childhood of acute otitis media and its significant morbidity, such as hearing loss and possibly speech delay, improving treatment of response is essential. Since bacteria are an important cause of otitis media, antimicrobial treatment remains the cornerstone of such treatment. Over the last four decades, many clinical studies have shown that antibiotics can relieve symptoms and prevalent complications, although a universal cure is still elusive. This article summarizes the most pertinent clinical and experimental research on treating and preventing acute otitis media, with a focus on intervention trials and the pharmacokinetic behavior of antimicrobial drugs. 
Calcium-regulating hormones in hypertension: vascular actions. The vascular and potentially hypertensive actions of the calcium-regulating hormones 1,25-dihydroxychole-calciferol [1,25(OH)2D3], parathyroid hormone (PTH), and calcitonin and related factors such as parathyroid hypertensive factor (PHF) and calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) are discussed. 1,25(OH)2D3 has inotropic and calciotropic actions on isolated vascular tissue whereas PTH is a vasodilator. PHF, which has been reported in plasma of humans with essential hypertension and spontaneously hypertensive rats, has both pressor and calciotropic actions. Calcitonin is without vascular effects and CGRP is a potent vasodilator. It is concluded that several of the hormones responsible for maintaining Ca2+ homeostasis modulate vascular Ca2+ metabolism and force generating capacity. These substances may be long-term modulators of vascular function and play a role in the determination of peripheral vascular resistance. 
Are vascular abnormalities a primary cause or secondary consequence of hypertension? This paper reviews the evidence that the resistance vasculature is altered in hypertension and the role that the vasculature may play in the pathogenesis of the disease. Although functional changes (i.e., increased vascular smooth muscle sensitivity) have been found to be associated with some models of hypertension (e.g., spontaneously hypertensive rat), in human essential hypertension it appears that the abnormalities that predominate in the resistance vasculature are structural in nature. These changes result in an increased media/lumen ratio of the more proximal resistance vessels (i.d. 100-300 microns), and the changes are such that they could account for many of the altered hemodynamic characteristics seen in patients with essential hypertension (e.g., increased minimum vascular resistance, increased pressor response). However, evidence that the abnormal structure of the peripheral vasculature is a prime determinant of blood pressure is still lacking, and much of the available evidence suggests that the altered structure is a secondary adaptation. Nevertheless, the abnormal vascular structure may play an important pathological role concerning the morbid consequences of the hypertensive disease, suggesting that normalization of vascular structure is a desirable aim for antihypertensive treatment. At present it seems that treatment must be continued for long periods, maybe many years, before vascular structure is normalized. 
The role of radiosurgery in the management of chordoma and chondrosarcoma of the cranial base. Despite conventional multimodality treatment (surgery and fractionated radiation therapy), recurrence and clinical progression of cranial base chordomas and chondrosarcomas are common. The malignant behavior of these tumors is a result of their critical location, locally aggressive nature, and high recurrence rate. To explore the role of radiosurgery in the treatment of these skull base neoplasms, we assessed its use in four patients with chordoma and two with chondrosarcoma. In five of the patients, radiosurgery was used as adjuvant therapy for residual or recurrent tumors after surgical debulking, and in one patient with a chordoma, it was the primary treatment. No patient received fractionated external beam radiotherapy. All tumors were less than 30 mm in diameter and were treated with 20 Gy to the tumor margin. Skull base computed tomography and magnetic resonance images were essential to define the anatomic relationships between tumor and adjacent basal structures. During follow-up (mean, 22 mo; range, 8-36 mo), we found no progression of the treated tumor volume in any patient. Neurological deficits before treatment improved in three patients; the other three patients remained in stable neurological condition. Serial follow-up imaging studies demonstrated that two patients showed reduction in tumor size and four patients had no tumor growth. In one patient, a metastatic parietal lobe chondrosarcoma developed and was treated by microsurgery. Another patient showed tumor progression outside of the radiosurgical treatment volume. Our results attest to the value of stereotactic radiosurgery as an adjuvant or primary treatment for selected patients with chordoma or chondrosarcoma and demonstrate its potential advantages over standard fractionated irradiation. Analysis of the long-term clinical and imaging effects after radiosurgery is warranted. 
Mesenteric vascular anatomy at CT: normal and abnormal appearances. The appearance of the mesenteric vessels on computed tomographic scans was evaluated in 187 patients to determine the variations in the anatomic relationships between the mesenteric vessels in normal patients, in patients with malrotation, and in patients with abdominal masses. In 166 patients (88.8%), a portion of the cranial segment of the superior mesenteric vein (SMV) was anterior and to the right of the superior mesenteric artery (SMA), although other normal configurations also occurred. A portion of the cranial segment of the SMV was directly anterior to the SMA in 15 patients (8.0%) and directly to the right of the SMA in 16 patients (8.6%). Of eight patients with complete inversion of the SMA and SMV, one had normal midgut rotation, two had malrotation, and six had neoplasms that displaced the vessels (one of these six also had malrotation). Of eight patients with inversion of only a part of the mesenteric vessels, none had malrotation. Although mesenteric inversion should stimulate a careful evaluation for malrotation, it is not pathognomonic of this condition. 
Suppression of gastric acid secretion by intravenous administration of famotidine in children. This study was designed to establish appropriate dosing requirements for intravenous use of famotidine, a new H2-receptor antagonist, in pediatric patients. Eighteen children, 2 to 69 months of age (mean +/- SD: 31 +/- 23 months), were treated with intravenously administered famotidine to prevent bleeding of the upper gastrointestinal tract. Continuous intragastric pH monitoring was carried out to ascertain the effectiveness of various intravenous doses. An initial dose of 0.4 mg/kg was given and repeated only after the intragastric pH had dropped to less than 4.0 for 2 hours. Increased doses were given (0.8, 1.2, and 1.6 mg/kg) if the previous dose did not raise the intragastric pH to greater than 4.0 for greater than or equal to 6 hours. Sixteen patients achieved an intragastric pH greater than or equal to 4.0 for greater than or equal to 6 hours, 13 with a dose of 0.4 mg/kg, and three with a dose of 0.8 mg/kg. The mean duration of continuous pH greater than 4.0 per dose was 9.0 +/- 7.5 hours. Ten patients received two or more intravenous doses of famotidine; the mean duration of pH greater than 4.0 after the second dose was less than that after the first (14.9 +/- 8.0 hours vs 6.9 +/- 3.2 hours, p less than 0.01). We conclude that intravenous famotidine therapy raises gastric pH to greater than 4.0 for approximately 9 hours in most children. Prolonged intravenous use of famotidine rapidly leads to a decreased duration of efficacy, necessitating intragastric pH monitoring to assess the effectiveness of treatment. 
Regional cerebral blood flow imaging: a quantitative comparison of technetium-99m-HMPAO SPECT with C15O2 PET. The aim of this study was to compare technetium-99m-hexamethylpropyleneamineoxime (99mTc-HMPAO) single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) with regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) imaging using positron emission tomography (PET). As investigation of dementia is likely to be one of the main uses of routine rCBF imaging, 18 demented patients were imaged with both techniques. The PET data were compared quantitatively with three versions of the SPECT data. These were, first, data normalized to the SPECT cerebellar uptake, second, data linearly corrected using the PET cerebellar value and, finally, data Lassen corrected for washout from the high flow areas. Both the linearly-corrected (r = 0.81) and the Lassen-corrected (r = 0.79) HMPAO SPECT data showed good correlation with the PET rCBF data. The relationship between the normalized HMPAO SPECT data and the PET data was nonlinear. It is not yet possible to obtain rCBF values in absolute units from HMPAO SPECT without knowledge of the true rCBF in one reference region for each patient. 
Seasonality in sudden infant death syndrome--United States, 1980-1987. Sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) is the sudden death of an infant less than 1 year of age that remains unexplained after a complete postmortem investigation, including autopsy, examination of the death scene, and review of the case history. SIDS, which usually occurs during sleep, is the leading cause of death in the postneonatal period (i.e., from 28 days through 364 days) and the eighth leading cause of years of potential life lost in the United States (1). The risk for SIDS is greatest for infants aged 1-4 months and during the cold season of the year (2); however, an independent contribution of the season of birth to the etiology of SIDS has not been consistently demonstrated (3). This report summarizes an assessment of the association between the risk for SIDS and an infant's month of birth, month of death, and age at death. 
Endocardial fibroelastosis in infants with hydrops fetalis. Endocardial fibroelastosis, defined as an endocardium in excess of 30 microns thick, was found in 10 out of 34 cases of hydrops fetalis in a review of 1589 perinatal necropsies carried out between 1976 and 1989. The infants comprised 16 cases of rhesus haemolytic disease, of whom three had endocardial fibroelastosis, and 18 cases of non-rhesus hydrops, of whom seven had endocardial fibroelastosis. Intrauterine congestive heart failure was thought to have been the probable cause of hydrops in eight of the 10 infants with endocardial fibroelastosis. None of an age matched control group without endocardial fibroelastosis had evidence of congestive cardiac failure. These observations support the hypothesis that endocardial fibroelastosis is an endocardial response to chronic prenatal myocardial stress. 
Colon perforation during colonoscopy: surgical versus conservative management. A survey of endoscopy units in the West Midlands, UK, was undertaken to ascertain the management of colonic perforation during colonoscopy. Fifteen perforations were reported from a total of 17,500 colonoscopies performed in 14 units (a rate of 0.09 per cent). In seven patients the diagnosis was suspected or diagnosed immediately and in the remaining eight 2-72 h later. Four patients with associated pathology (carcinoma, Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis and a polyp) had resection and primary anastomosis. Seven patients had a simple oversew, four of these having had a delayed diagnosis. In four cases the site of perforation was not identified, but only one patient had conservative treatment. Three patients had drainage and a defunctioning colostomy. There was no significant morbidity following treatment. It is recommended that patients who have had a good bowel preparation should be treated conservatively unless there is a large perforation or an underlying carcinoma. 
Health maintenance strategies for women of different ages. An overview. Preventive health strategies for screening for specific illnesses, counseling, and immunization are discussed. Emphasis is given to cardiovascular screening and risk reduction, screening for malignancies, and immunization practices. A framework for designing periodic health examinations for patients is detailed. 
Tumor antigen presentation by murine epidermal cells. The ability of epidermal Langerhans cells to present Ag for CD4-dependent immunity is well documented, and it has been hypothesized that Langerhans cells participate in the generation of immunity against incipient epidermal neoplasms by presentation of tumor-associated Ag in situ. This study examined the ability of murine epidermal cells (EC) to present tumor-associated Ag for the induction of in vivo antitumor immunity. Murine epidermal cells were deleted of Thy-1-bearing cells, cultured in 50 U/ml granulocyte-macrophage-CSF for 14 to 18 h, and pulsed with tumor fragments (TF) derived from S1509a-fibrosarcoma cells. These TF-pulsed EC were injected s.c. into syngeneic recipients at weekly intervals for a total of three immunizations and challenged with viable S1509a tumor cells 1 wk after the last immunization. Control animals received TF-pulsed allogeneic EC or EC treated identically but not pulsed with TF. EC that were pulsed with tumor cell fragments were able to induce protective immunity to tumor growth in vivo and to immunize for a significant delayed-type hypersensitivity response to injected tumor cells. The induction of antitumor immunity with TF-pulsed EC was genetically restricted, and culture of EC in granulocyte-macrophage-CSF was required for development of significant immunity. Furthermore, deletion of I-A+ cells by antibody and complement-mediated lysis eliminated the generation of immunity. Thus, I-A+ epidermal cells are capable of presenting S1509a tumor Ag for the generation of protective antitumor immunity in vivo. 
Evaluation of antiarrhythmic drug effects with simultaneous analysis of single ventricular premature contractions, couplets and salvos. To improve the clinical value of ambulatory Holter electrocardiographic (ECG) monitoring as a tool of antiarrhythmic therapy control, a new statistical model was developed. In a patient group at increased risk of sudden cardiac death, the spontaneous variability of ventricular arrhythmias was assessed, with simultaneous consideration of single ventricular premature complexes, couplets and salvos. The study included 100 patients who suffered from coronary heart disease or idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy and for whom greater than 30 ventricular premature complexes/h and couplets had been demonstrated on the last Holter ECG before the study. Between 3 and 12 Holter recordings were made for each patient in a drug-free state; the mean follow-up period was 260 days (maximum 1,403). The mean hourly values of the ectopic events (EE) were assessed separately for ventricular premature complexes, couplets and salvos. The spontaneous variability (SV) was calculated for single ventricular premature complexes, couplets and salvos as SV = log (EEday 2 + 0.01/EEday 1 + 0.01) and linked in one, two and three dimensions. Compared with the consideration of only one type of arrhythmia (one-dimensional model), the simultaneous use of two or three types of arrhythmia (two- or three-dimensional model) resulted in considerably lower reduction and aggravation rates as sufficient proof of drug effects. With control intervals up to 1 week, the one-dimensional model yielded reduction rates for ventricular premature complexes, couplets and salvos of -63%, -90% and -95%, respectively. In contrast, with the three-dimensional model, the rates were -28%, -72% and -88%. The corresponding aggravation values were +370, +1,114% and +2,189% versus +38%, +256% and +747%. 
Impact of pretransplant conditioning and donor T cells on chimerism, graft-versus-host disease, graft-versus-leukemia reactivity, and tolerance after bone marrow transplantation. Graft rejection, mixed chimerism, graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), leukemia relapse, and tolerance are interrelated manifestations of immunologic reactivity between donor and host cells that significantly affect survival after allogeneic bone marrow transplantation (BMT). In this report, a mouse model of BMT, in which the donor and host were compatible at the major histocompatibility complex (MHC), was used (1) to examine the interrelationship of pretransplant conditioning and T-cell content of donor BM with regard to lymphoid chimerism and GVHD and (2) to determine how these factors affected graft-versus-leukemia (GVL) reactivity and donor-host-tolerance. AKR (H-2k) host mice were administered optimal or suboptimal total body irradiation (TBI) as pretransplant conditioning followed by administration of BM cells from B10.BR (H-2k) donor mice with or without added spleen cells as a source of T lymphocytes. Transplanted mice were injected with a supralethal dose of AKR leukemia cells 20 and 45 days post-BMT to assess GVL reactivity in vivo. The pretransplant conditioning of the host and T-cell content of the donor marrow affected the extent of donor T-cell chimerism and the severity of GVH disease. GVL reactivity was dependent on transplantation of mature donor T cells and occurred only in complete chimeras. Transplantation of T-cell-deficient BM resulted in the persistence of host T cells, ie, incomplete donor T-cell chimerism, even when lethal TBI was used. Mixed chimerism was associated with a lack of GVL reactivity, despite the fact that similar numbers of donor T cells were present in the spleens of mixed and complete chimeras. In this model, moderate numbers of donor T cells facilitated complete donor T-cell engraftment, caused only mild GVHD, and provided a significant GVL effect without preventing the subsequent development of tolerance after conditioning with suboptimal TBI. In contrast, severe, often lethal, GVHD developed when the dose of TBI was increased, whereas tolerance and no GVH/GVL reactivity developed when the T-cell content of the marrow was decreased. 
Endocarditis prophylaxis in a primary care clinic. BACKGROUND. Primary care physicians often make decisions about the use of endocarditis prophylaxis (EP). Compliance with American Heart Association (AHA) recommendations has been found to be poor in hospitalized patients and in a dental school clinic. The purpose of this study was to examine the use of endocarditis prophylaxis in a primary care clinic. METHODS. The problem list of all adult patients seen in a primary care clinic in 1989 was reviewed for diagnoses that might require EP. Eighty-four charts were identified and reviewed. RESULTS. Sixty-five percent of the study patients had documentation in their charts about the need for EP. Mitral valve prolapse was the most frequent diagnosis. The physicians recommended EP for most patients with mitral valve prolapse regardless of whether there was documented mitral insufficiency. Endocarditis prophylaxis was most commonly prescribed for dental procedures. Six patients received prophylaxis for procedures for which the AHA does not recommend prophylaxis. Only 19% of the antibiotic regimens prescribed were entirely consistent with the AHA 1984 guidelines. The most common deviation from the AHA guidelines was continuing oral antibiotics too long. CONCLUSIONS. Compliance with the AHA 1984 recommendations, although better than reported in other settings, was less than optimal in this primary care clinic. Family physicians should consider whether EP is indicated in any patient with cardiac disease. If prophylaxis is indicated, then such a recommendation should be clearly documented in the chart. Family physicians need to be familiar with the 1990 AHA recommendations. 
Lightning and its effects on the auditory system. Patients struck by lightning can present with a wide variety of unusual otologic problems including burns to the external auditory canal, tympanic membrane rupture, middle ear injury, and sensorineural hearing loss. Four patients who incurred various otologic problems, including one patient with previously unreported bilateral oval window fistulas following lightning injury, are presented. Audiologic, otologic, and surgical findings are reviewed as well as patient follow-up and outcome. 
High levels of p19/nm23 protein in neuroblastoma are associated with advanced stage disease and with N-myc gene amplification. The gene encoding a novel protein designated nm23-H1, which was recently identified as identical to the A subunit of nucleotide diphosphate kinase from human erythrocytes, has been proposed to play a role in tumor metastasis suppression. We report that untreated neuroblastoma tumors contain a cellular polypeptide (Mr = 19,000) designated p19, identified in two-dimensional electrophoretic gels, which occurs at significantly higher levels (P = 0.0001) in primary tumors containing amplified N-myc gene. The partial amino acid sequence obtained for p19 is identical to the sequence of the human nm23-H1 protein. An antibody to the A subunit of erythrocyte nucleotide diphosphate kinase reacted exclusively with p19. In this study, significantly higher levels of p19/nm23 occurred in primary neuroblastoma tumors from patients with advanced stages (III and IV) relative to tumors from patients with limited stages (I and II) of the disease. Even among patients with a single copy of the N-myc gene, tumors from patients with stages III and IV had statistically significantly higher levels of p19/nm23 than tumors from patients with stages I and II. Our findings indicate that, in contrast to a proposed role for nm23-H1 as a tumor metastasis suppressor, increased p19/nm23 protein in neuroblastoma is correlated with features of the disease that are associated with aggressive tumors. Therefore, nm23-H1 may have distinct if not opposite roles in different tumors. 
Atrial natriuretic factor modulates the plasma levels of a Na+/K+ATPase inhibitor in volume expanded borderline hypertensives. To evaluate the existence of a relationship between atrial natriuretic factor (ANF) and plasma Na+/K+ATPase inhibitory activity in humans, we examined the hemodynamic and humoral response to volume expansion in 41 borderline hypertensive patients (BHT) with either normal (n = 33) or low plasma renin activity (n = 8). The study was carried out by measuring blood pressure, forearm circulation, plasma renin activity (PRA), ANF, and plasma levels of an endogenous Na+/K+ATPase inhibitor before and after 2 h of acute intravenous NaCl infusion (0.22 mL/min/kg bodyweight). The early (45 min) changes of ANF and those of Na+/K+ATPase inhibitory activity attained at the end of saline infusion were inversely related in BHT with normal PRA and directly related in the low-PRA population (r = 0.64). The time-course of ANF response to sodium loading was significantly delayed in BHT characterized by normal venous distensibility. They also showed a greater increase in plasma Na+/K+ATPase inhibitory activity occurring with an hypertensive, vasoconstrictive, and sodium retaining response as well. We conclude that in normal PRA borderline hypertensives, ANF may modulate the release of a plasma Na+/K+ATPase inhibitor in a setting where extracellular volume is acutely expanded. Our findings also suggest that dissimilarities in peripheral venous distensibility are able to influence the time-course of ANF response. The blunted ANF increase observed in response to NaCl loading in a subset of BHT could represent an early marker of the attitude of such patients to develop high blood pressure leading to the release of a Na(+)-pump inhibitor and influencing individual salt-sensitivity. 
Cecal rupture after continent ileocecal urinary diversion during total pelvic exenteration. Continent ureteral diversion at the time of pelvic exenteration avoids an external appliance and allows patients to retain "bladder" reservoir function. The technical difficulty of this procedure requires meticulous attention to operative and perioperative care, particularly after pelvic irradiation. A patient with recurrent stage IIIB carcinoma of the cervix underwent total pelvic exenteration with reconstructive procedures including low rectal anastomosis, neovagina formation, and ileocecal (Indiana) continent diversion. Early catheterization of the reservoir began 2 weeks postoperatively. One week later cecal rupture occurred, not related to suture line (technical) failure. Because of the high wall tension and reduced compliance in the irradiated cecum, we do not recommend catheterization of the urinary reservoir before 4-6 weeks. In order for continent diversion to become the standard diversion in exenteration patients, the major complication rate must remain comparable to that of noncontinent diversion. 
The effect of chronic orthopedic infection on quality of life. The patient with chronic orthopedic infection presents a unique challenge to the orthopedic surgeon. The orthopedic surgeon must not only possess an expertise in constantly evolving diagnostic and treatment techniques but also be able to identify numerous related problems and direct the patient in receiving the most appropriate treatment. This demands a commitment of time by the treating surgeon to the individual patient to properly assess the need for support, the extent of psychologic distress, the intensity of pain, and the requirement for medication management. The effective utilization of a multidisciplinary team of health care providers (e.g., specialists in infectious disease, physical medicine and rehabilitation, psychiatry, nursing, pharmacology) can provide an optimal treatment program for this multifaceted problem and maximize the potential for a favorable outcome. 
Probability of appendicitis before and after observation. STUDY OBJECTIVE: To examine patients with abdominal pain for changes in probability of appendicitis during observation. STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study. SETTING: University-affiliated community hospital. METHODS: 252 patients with abdominal pain who were examined underwent short-term (10.4 hours) observation (95% confidence interval [CI], 8.7, 12.1) before the decision to operate during a one-year period. Alvarado's scoring system and a probability-of-diagnosis nomogram were used to assign scores and estimate probability of appendicitis. MEASUREMENTS AND RESULTS: In the study group, mean score of patients with appendicitis increased after observation from 6.8 (95% CI, 6.2, 7.4) to 7.8 (95% CI, 7.3, 8.3), corresponding to a change in probability of appendicitis from 50% to 65%. Mean score of patients without appendicitis decreased from 3.8 (95% CI, 3.5, 4.1) to 1.6 (95% CI, 1.58, 1.62), corresponding to a change in probability from 35% to 22%. The difference between mean scores for patients with and without appendicitis increased from 2.6 (95% CI, 2.0, 3.2) to 6.2 (95% CI, 6.15, 6.25) during observation. The study group initially had intermediate probability of appendicitis (score, 4.35; 95% CI, 4.04, 4.66) compared with high probability for patients who went directly to surgery after their initial evaluation (63 patients; score, 7.59; 95% CI, 7.05, 8.73) and low probability for patients with abdominal pain who were sent home after their initial evaluation without observation or surgery (2,097 patients; score, 1.87; 95% CI, 1.48, 2.26). CONCLUSION: In this group of patients with intermediate initial probability of appendicitis, observation improved the ability to distinguish patients with from those without appendicitis. 
Cardiac epinephrine synthesis. Regulation by a glucocorticoid. BACKGROUND. The heart can synthesize epinephrine. Homogenates of rat heart, which contain the enzymes phenylethanolamine N-methyltransferase (PNMT) and nonspecific N-methyltransferase (NMT), methylate norepinephrine to form epinephrine. The cardiac atrium contains primarily PNMT and the cardiac ventricle contains both PNMT and NMT. METHODS AND RESULTS. Rats were given the glucocorticoid dexamethasone at doses ranging from 0.2 to 20 mg/kg. Twenty-four hours later, cardiac atria, ventricle, skeletal muscle, and adrenal had increases in PNMT activity to as much as 230% of baseline. NMT activity was unchanged. Longer-term treatment with 1 mg/kg dexamethasone daily for 12 days increased cardiac PNMT activity about fivefold and also increased atrial epinephrine levels. Dexamethasone did not alter ventricular epinephrine levels but increased levels of both PNMT and catechol-O-methyltransferase, the major catabolic enzyme for epinephrine. After dexamethasone treatment, greater volumes of anti-PNMT antiserum were needed to decrease PNMT enzymatic activity, indicating that dexamethasone treatment resulted in greater amounts of PNMT and did not just activate existing PNMT molecules. Denervation of the masseter muscle of rats by unilateral superior cervical ganglionectomy markedly diminished tissue norepinephrine and epinephrine levels but had no effect on masseter PNMT or NMT levels. We have previously shown that chemical sympathectomy with 6-hydroxydopamine increases cardiac PNMT levels. These findings suggest that PNMT is an extraneuronal enzyme in both cardiac and skeletal muscle. CONCLUSIONS. Glucocorticoids have several cardiovascular effects, including increased cardiac output and blood pressure. Enhanced cardiac epinephrine synthesis may mediate some of these glucocorticoid effects. 
Experimental hypertension. Several interventions are used to induce hypertension in the experimental animal. The three most used interventions are renal ischemia, mineralocorticoid excess, and genetic manipulation. The sequence of events leading from these initiating manipulations to the elevated arterial pressure is being explored to define the mechanism responsible for hypertension. The following mechanisms are currently extensively evaluated: Pressor and depressor factors of renal origin, neurogenic regulation, circulating humoral factors, vessel wall hypertrophy, and membrane transport abnormality. The experimental models of hypertension hold great promise in providing an understanding of the mechanisms and developing effective treatment in clinical hypertension. 
Group C streptococcal bacteremia: analysis of 88 cases. Eighty-eight cases of group C streptococcal bacteremia were reviewed retrospectively. Most patients had underlying diseases (72.7%), predominantly cardiovascular disease (20.5%) or malignancy (20.5%). The infection originated most often from the upper respiratory tract (20.5%), the gastrointestinal tract (18.2%), or the skin (17.1%). Prior exposure to animals or animal products was reported in 23.9% of cases. The most common clinical manifestations of group C streptococcal bacteremia were endocarditis (27.3%), primary bacteremia (22.7%), and meningitis (10.2%). Of streptococcal isolates, 61.4% were not speciated, 19.3% were Streptococcus equisimilis, 17.1% were Streptococcus zooepidemicus, and two (2.3%) were Streptococcus equi. The isolates were sensitive to most antibiotics, and most patients were treated with beta-lactam agents. Mortality was high (25.0%), especially among older patients and patients with endocarditis, meningitis, and disseminated infection. Group C streptococcal bacteremia does not differ from bloodstream infection caused by other beta-hemolytic streptococci with regard to clinical presentation, treatment, or outcome. 
Chordoma of the petrous bone. We have presented two cases of chordoma arising from an unusual location within the skull. Chordomas in the skull usually arise from within the body of the clivus, reputedly from notochordal remnants. The first case, which was diagnosed both with CT and MRI, had its origin from the petrous bone, with extension into the left cerebellopontine angle. Chordoma was not considered high on the list of differential diagnoses. A right pontine hemorrhage, which was evacuated surgically, was diagnosed in the second case both from its clinical appearance and from that on CT scan. Only when bone windowing technique was used with CT was a lytic lesion of the right petrous bone evident. Chordoma was only diagnosed on autopsy. In reviewing these two cases and the literature, it is evident that chordoma must be considered in the differential diagnosis of erosive lesions of the petrous bone. 
Anaesthesia for Proteus syndrome. A 14-year-old boy with Proteus syndrome presented for orthopaedic surgery to his legs. No report in the literature exists on anaesthesia for this condition. Our patients posed airway problems that were managed by tracheal intubation under sedation using a fibreoptic bronchoscope. Anaesthesia was induced with thiopentone and maintained with nitrous oxide and isoflurane in oxygen. His lungs were ventilated mechanically throughout surgery, which was uneventful. 
Sudden death and paroxysmal autonomic dysfunction in stiff-man syndrome. Two women with typical stiff-man syndrome (SMS) developed increasingly frequent attacks of muscle spasms with severe paroxysmal autonomic dysfunctions such as transient hyperpyrexia, diaphoresis, tachypnea, tachycardia, pupillary dilation, and arterial hypertension. Autoantibodies to GABA-ergic neurons were identified in the serum of both patients and in the cerebrospinal fluid of one. Both died suddenly and unexpectedly. General autopsy did not reveal the cause of death. Neuropathological studies revealed perivascular gliosis in the spinal cord and brain stem of one patient and lymphocytic perivascular infiltration in the spinal cord, brain stem, and basal ganglia of the other. The occurrence of a chronic inflammatory reaction in one of the two patients supports the idea that an autoimmune disease against GABA-ergic neurons may be involved in SMS. A review of the literature indicates that functional impairment in SMS is severe and prognosis is unpredictable because of the potential for sudden and unexpected death. Both muscular abnormalities and autonomic dysfunctions may result from autoimmunity directed against GABA-ergic neurons. 
Arrhythmias in heart failure--therapeutic challenges. Electrophysiologic disorders are common at all stages of heart failure due to myocardial mechanical factors, neuroendocrine disturbances, electrolyte abnormalities, or ischemia, and also because of cardiovascular drugs. The prevalence of various forms of heart block, bradycardias, and arrhythmias in heart failure is largely unknown, as is their relationship to the etiology of the syndrome. Complex and multiform ventricular premature beats and nonsustained ventricular tachycardia are common, and their frequency is broadly related to the severity of heart failure. Supraventricular arrhythmias are also common features of the syndrome. The heart failure syndrome has an ominous prognosis. Approximately half the patients die suddenly, but the causal relationship between preexisting arrhythmias and sudden death is not known. Equally vital is knowledge of the influence of drug therapy on the arrhythmias of heart failure, but at present this is scarce and needs further study. 
Mastoid obliteration with the temporoparietal fascia flap. Obliteration of persistently discharging open mastoid cavities is one surgical option to achieve a dry ear. All the currently described techniques involve the use of random pattern local tissue flaps or free grafts. Ten patients have undergone obliteration procedures using the vascularized temporoparietal fascia flap. This resulted in rapid epithelialization by six weeks in seven out of 10 cases. The remaining three patients have persistent non healed areas over the medial attic wall, but are not troubled by otorrhoea. The indications, technique and complications of mastoid obliteration by this axial pattern flap are described. 
Quantitative comparison of aromatase induction by dexamethasone in fibroblasts from a patient with familial cortisol resistance and a patient with cortisol hyperreactive syndrome. The ability of dexamethasone to induce aromatase activity was tested in fibroblasts from a patient with familial cortisol resistance, a patient with cortisol hyperreactive syndrome, and five normal subjects. Dexamethasone increased enzyme activity in all cases in a concentration-dependent manner (over a range of 1-1000 nmol/L). In fibroblasts from a patient with familial cortisol resistance, the response curve of dexamethasone-induced aromatase activity was shifted to the right compared to that of normal cells. However, the maximal induction of the enzyme at 1 mumol/L dexamethasone was unchanged in cortisol-resistant fibroblasts. On the other hand, in fibroblasts from the patient with the cortisol hyperreactive syndrome, the half-maximal effect of dexamethasone was similar to that in normal cells, but maximum induction of aromatase activity was 2 times greater than that in normal cells. The glucocorticoid antagonist RU 486 inhibited dexamethasone-induced aromatase activity in these patients' cells and in normal cells in a concentration-dependent manner, indicating that the altered effects of dexamethasone on aromatase induction observed in each cell type were mediated through glucocorticoid receptors. 
Prevention of stress-induced erosive gastritis by parenteral administration of arachidonic acid. Stress-induced mucosal ulcerations are associated with a decreased synthesis of mucosal prostaglandin (PG) E2. This phenomenon is poorly understood. To investigate whether it is due to a decreased availability of the necessary substrates to the mucosa, four groups of 10 Holtzman rats were studied: group 1 received normal saline by intraperitoneal (ip) injection; group 2 also received ip normal saline, then were submitted to stress, by the cold restraint method; group 3 received a solution of arachidonic acid (AA) ip; and group 4 also received ip AA, then were submitted to stress. After sacrifice, the number of gastric ulcerations were counted and specimens of nonulcerated mucosa were assayed for PGE2 by high-performance liquid chromatography; the mean numbers of ulcers were 0, 5.8, 0.8, and 3 and the mean levels of PGE2 were 55, 41, 125, and 62 pg/mg of wet tissue for groups 1, 2, 3, and 4, respectively. It is concluded that parenteral administration of AA reduces but does not completely eliminate stress-induced gastric ulcerations and that the stressed animals synthesized half as much PGE2 as the nonstressed ones after ip administration of equal amounts of AA, suggesting that stress reduces the availability of AA to the gastric mucosa, possibly by vascular spasm. 
Mitral valve replacement combined with coronary artery operation: determinants of early and late results. Mitral valve replacement combined with coronary artery bypass grafting has been reported as being associated with a higher mortality than either mitral valve replacement or coronary artery bypass grafting alone. Cause of mitral valve disease and severity of mitral regurgitation have been reported as related to mortality. To study the correlation of the cause of mitral valve disease and severity of mitral regurgitation to hospital mortality and long-term survival, we analyzed the results of 135 patients undergoing mitral valve replacement and coronary artery bypass grafting between June 1974 and August 1989. The hospital mortality was 11.8% (16/135). Fifteen preoperative and operative variables were tested for correlation with hospital or late mortality using univariate tests and multivariate regression. Advanced age (greater than 60 years), New York Heart Association functional class, and wall motion score were independently associated with hospital mortality (p less than 0.05). The cause of mitral valve disease and severity of mitral regurgitation were not related to hospital mortality or long-term survival (p greater than 0.05). The follow-up rate was 96.6% for the hospital survivors (115/119). Mean follow-up was 52.6 +/- 4.1 months. There were 35 late deaths. Survival was 91.9%, 89.9%, 78%, and 49.9% at 1, 2, 5, and 10 postoperative years, respectively. Preoperative New York Heart Association functional class and use of catecholamines during the postoperative intensive care period were independently related to late survival (p less than 0.05). 
Temporary external DDD pacing after cardiac operations. Temporary atrial and ventricular pacing in the DVI, VVI, and AOO modes using atrioventricular sequential DVI devices is routinely used in cardiac operations. This study evaluated a new temporary external DDD pacemaker (Medtronic 5345 External Pulse Generator) capable of ten pacing modes. Thirty-nine devices have been applied to 38 adult patients (27 male, 11 female) after a variety of open heart procedures. Group 1 had atrial pacing wires placed 1.5 to 2.0 cm apart superiorly on the right atrium, group 2 had atrial wires placed 1.0 to 1.5 cm apart on the right atrial free wall, and group 3 had atrial wires placed on the right atrial free wall 0.8 cm apart, using a Silastic ring for fixation. Ventricular wires were placed on the free wall (group 1) or the diaphragmatic surface (groups 2 and 3) of the right ventricle. Postoperative atrial and ventricular sensing and pacing thresholds were obtained on return to the intensive care unit; analysis of variance demonstrated a significantly greater atrial sensing threshold in group 3. Four patients in group 1 permanently lost atrial sensing, 1 patient in group 2 intermittently lost atrial sensing at 24 hours with return at 36 hours postoperatively, and 1 patient in group 1 lost ventricular sensing capability. All other patients had adequate atrial and ventricular sensing capability documented until elective pacemaker removal (mean, 166 hours; range, 17 to 667.5 hours). Nineteen patients required some form of temporary pacing postoperatively; 11 patients demonstrated hemodynamic benefit from a pacing mode that is not available on the currently used DVI devices, and 7 of these required true DDD pacing capability. Six patients benefited from atrial pacing with adequate atrial sensing and simultaneous ventricular backup. Burst pacing with the device was used successfully to treat postoperative atrial flutter in 2 patients. We conclude that temporary external DDD pacing is feasible and effective in postoperative cardiac surgical patients. Atrial sensing is possible in most patients but electrode positioning is important for adequate thresholds. In some patients, hemodynamic as well as electrophysiologic improvement can be demonstrated with universal DDD pacing capability as compared with standard DVI pacing. 
Perilymph fistulas: the House Ear Clinic experience. The diagnosis, evaluation, and surgical treatment of perilymph fistulas has recently been the focus of a great deal of attention in otology. Authors have focused on perilymph fistulas as the cause of hearing loss and vertigo in many diverse situations. Additionally, surgical repair has been suggested when there is little objective support for intervention. To address some of the problems inherent in the diagnosis and treatment of perilymph fistulas, records of patients operated on at the House Ear Clinic during the past 12 years were reviewed retrospectively. Eighty-six patients were surgically explored for fistulas during this period. Thirty-five (40.7%) fistulas were found, and 51 ears were patched whether fistulas were found or not. Of the 80 patients who were seen for follow-up, 35 (43.8%) were subjectively better, and 45 (56.2%) were the same. Although the number of fistulas found and the number of patients improved were similar, the composition of the two groups was different. On the basis of audiometric results, improvement in hearing occurred in only 18.7% of the patients. None of the demographic factors or diagnostic tests were predictive of either the presence of a fistula or the therapeutic outcome. Further work is required to facilitate the preoperative diagnosis of fistulas and to design appropriate surgical intervention. 
Intractable epilepsy and structural lesions of the brain: mapping, resection strategies, and seizure outcome. Forty-seven patients with structural brain lesions on neuroimaging studies and partial epilepsy intractable to medical therapy were studied. Prolonged noninvasive interictal and ictal EEG recording was performed, followed by more focused mapping using chronically implanted subdural electrode plates. Surgical procedures included lesion biopsy, maximal lesion excision, and/or resection of zones of epileptogenesis depending on accessibility and involvement of speech or other functional areas. The epileptogenic zone involved exclusively the region adjacent to the structural lesion in 11 patients. It extended beyond the lesion in 18 patients. Eighteen other patients had remote noncontiguous zones of epileptogenesis. Postoperative control of epilepsy was accomplished in 17 of 18 patients (94%) with complete lesion excision regardless of extent of seizure focus excision. Postoperative control of epilepsy was accomplished in 5 of 6 patients (83%) with incomplete lesion excision but complete seizure focus excision and in 12 of 23 patients (52%) with incomplete lesion excision and incomplete focus excision. The extent of lesion resection was strongly associated with surgical outcome either in itself (p less than 0.003), or in combination with focus excision. Focus resection was marginally associated with surgical outcome as a dichotomous variable (p = 0.048) and showed a trend toward significance (p = 0.07) only as a three-level outcome variable. We conclude that structural lesions are associated with zones of epileptogenesis in neighboring and remote areas of the brain. Maximum resection of the lesion offers the best chance at controlling intractable epilepsy; however, seizure control is achieved in many patients by carefully planned subtotal resection of lesions or foci. 
Etidronate for hypercalcemia of malignancy and osteoporosis. The biphosphonates are becoming well established as effective agents for the treatment of metabolic bone diseases. Etidronate disodium is the only biphosphonate approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. Accepted indications for etidronate therapy are symptomatic Paget's disease, heterotopic ossification and hypercalcemia of malignancy. An unapproved, but apparently successful use is treatment of postmenopausal osteoporosis. Both oral and intravenous preparations are available. Newer biphosphonates, which may be more efficacious and less toxic than etidronate, are being studied. 
Chronic urticaria and cancer: an epidemiological study of 1155 patients. To evaluate the possible association of malignant disease with chronic urticaria 1155 consecutive cases with chronic urticaria were reviewed. The Swedish Cancer Registry, Stockholm, was searched for records reporting malignancies in the study population (1958-84), and the expected number of malignancies was calculated on the basis of age- and sex-standardized incidence data. A malignancy was diagnosed in 36 patients with urticaria and the expected number of malignancies was 41. In 23 patients the malignancy appeared during the same year as the onset of urticaria or later. The expected number was 25.6. We conclude that chronic urticaria is not statistically associated with malignancy in general. 
Lupus anticoagulants, anticardiolipin antibodies, and fetal loss. A case-control study. BACKGROUND. Lupus anticoagulants and anticardiolipin antibodies are antiphospholipid antibodies that have been associated with fetal loss, but they have not been shown unequivocally to be a risk factor for this event. METHODS. To estimate the risk of fetal loss in association with these antibodies, we conducted a hospital-based case-control study of 331 women with spontaneous abortion or fetal death (case patients) and 993 controls. The subjects were included in the study only if they reported that they had had no previous spontaneous fetal loss. Each control was a pregnant woman who, in the same period of pregnancy as a case patient, had not had a fetal loss. Lupus anticoagulants were identified in blood samples through a series of coagulation tests, and IgG anticardiolipins by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Each subject was interviewed in person to obtain information on potential confounding variables, such as sociodemographic characteristics and medical conditions. RESULTS. Lupus anticoagulants were found in blood from 17 case patients (5.1 percent) and 38 controls (3.8 percent). The crude odds ratio for the association between lupus anticoagulants and fetal loss was 1.36 (95 percent confidence interval, 0.75 to 2.43); the odds ratio adjusted for confounders was 1.42 (95 percent confidence interval, 0.72 to 2.80). An IgG anticardiolipin level of 5 units or more was found in 4 case patients (1.2 percent) and 15 controls (1.5 percent). The crude and adjusted odds ratios for fetal loss were 0.80 (95 percent confidence interval, 0.26 to 2.41) and 1.28 (95 percent confidence interval, 0.38 to 4.21), respectively. CONCLUSIONS. There is not apparent justification for considering lupus anticoagulants or IgG anticardiolipins to be risk factors for fetal loss among women who present with spontaneous abortion or fetal death and have had no previous spontaneous fetal loss. 
Central nervous system germinomas. A review. The germinoma represents a less malignant form of germ cell tumor. Depending on the individual's age, this neoplasm constitutes approximately 0.1% to 3.4% of all intracranial tumors. The embryologic origin remains a mystery; however, current theories implicate an aberration in primordial germ cell migration. Clinical presentation depends on tumor location and may involve endocrine, hypothalamic, visual, and cognitive dysfunction. In evaluating midline intracerebral masses, it is imperative that one be aware of the various radiologic appearances, endocrinologic changes, and chemical markers that help to distinguish germinomas from other neoplasms that appear in the pineal, suprasellar, and periventricular regions. Only through the careful evaluation of all available studies can the physician institute appropriate therapies such as biopsy, radiation, and chemotherapy. This article focuses on the epidemiology, embryology, clinical presentation, means of diagnosis, treatment, and outcome of this rare neoplasm. 
Wide vertical hemipharyngolaryngectomy with immediate glottic and pharyngeal reconstruction using a radial forearm free flap: preliminary results. We propose a new technique of wide vertical hemipharyngolaryngectomy which combines resection of laterally localized extended pharyngolaryngeal tumors with immediate microsurgical reconstruction using a radial forearm free flap, including the tendon of the palmaris longus. It eliminates the limitations of resections, which are usually performed to avoid closure difficulties of the resulting defect. In addition, the new technique avoids the use of tumor-neighboring structures for closure, fulfilling the oncological principles of surgery performed in this region. Our preliminary results show good restored deglutition and phonation. Postoperative irradiation does not seem to affect these results. 
Insulin regulation of the glucagon gene is mediated by an insulin-responsive DNA element. Diabetes mellitus is characterized by insulin deficiency and high plasma glucagon levels, which can be normalized by insulin replacement. It has previously been reported that glucagon gene expression is negatively regulated by insulin at the transcriptional level. By transfection studies, I have now localized a DNA control element that mediates insulin effects on glucagon gene transcription. This element also confers insulin responsiveness to a heterologous promoter. DNA-binding proteins that specifically interact with this insulin-responsive element are found in both glucagon- and non-glucagon-producing cells; and the pattern of binding, as assessed by the gel retardation assay, is not modified by prior insulin treatment. 
Pain reduction interventions during neonatal circumcision. The purpose of this study was to determine the effect of some noninvasive pain reduction interventions on pain in 121 neonates undergoing unanesthetized circumcision. Subjects were randomly assigned to one of six groups: classical music, intrauterine sounds, pacifier, music and pacifier, intrauterine sounds and pacifier, or control (no nurses present and no pain reduction interventions used). Physiological variables that were monitored were heart rate, rhythm, dysrhythmias, blood pressure, transcutaneous oxygen (tcpO2), rate pressure product, and behavioral state, measured during 14 circumcision steps. Over the 14 steps, 42% of the heart rates, 78% of the systolic blood pressures (SBP), 30% of the diastolic blood pressures (DBP), and 81% of the tcpO2 pressures were abnormal. Few significant differences were found among any of the steps. SBP and DBP differed significantly between groups during two of the noninvasive steps; and tcpO2 differed significantly during six steps. 
Selective depletion of macrophages prevents pituitary-adrenal activation in response to subpyrogenic, but not to pyrogenic, doses of bacterial endotoxin in rats. The mechanisms by which bacterial endotoxin [lipopolysaccharide (LPS)] stimulates the hypothalamo-pituitary-adrenal axis (HPAA) have not been elucidated. The present study was designed to investigate the involvement of macrophages in plasma ACTH and corticosterone responses to LPS administration in rats using selective in vivo macrophage depletion. Intraperitoneal administration of subpyrogenic doses of LPS to normal rats resulted in elevated plasma ACTH and corticosterone concentrations, measured 2 h later. The response showed a remarkable steep dose relationship, with minimal effective doses between 0.5-1.5 micrograms (ACTH) and 0.5 micrograms or less (corticosterone)/kg BW. Plasma PRL, LH, and catecholamine (norepinephrine, epinephrine) levels were not significantly changed under the conditions used. Only at 6 h after LPS administration was a small elevation of norepinephrine noted. To deplete macrophages, rats were injected with liposomes encapsulated with dichloromethylene diphosphonate (Cl2MDP). Histochemical (acid phosphatase) and immunocytochemical techniques (monoclonal antibodies to rat macrophages coded ED1 and ED3) were applied to examine the efficiency of macrophage elimination by the Cl2MDP liposomes in cytospins of peritoneal exudates and in sections of the liver and spleen. Since cells of the macrophage lineage are considered to be the main source of IL-1 in the circulation, we also measured circulating levels of immunoreactive interleukin-1 beta (IL-1) concentrations in control and Cl2MDP liposome-treated rats by the use of a newly developed RIA. Reduced numbers of macrophages were seen in peritoneal lavages of Cl2MDP liposome-treated animals, whereas the morphological appearance and numbers of mast cells, granulocytes, and T-cells were unaffected. Similarly, macrophages were effectively eliminated in the spleen, mesenteric lymph nodes, and liver, as inferred from the reduction of macrophage staining in these organs. Plasma IL-1 concentrations could only be detected in response to a pyrogenic (2.5 mg/kg, iv) and not to a subpyrogenic (0.025 mg/kg, ip) dose of LPS. The increase in plasma IL-1 concentrations in response to the pyrogenic dose of LPS, reaching levels of 20-40 ng/ml in control rats, was blunted in animals treated with the Cl2MDP liposomes. Macrophage depletion by Cl2MDP liposomes did not affect either resting plasma corticosterone levels or the corticosterone response to ether exposure. At subpyrogenic doses of LPS, plasma ACTH and corticosterone responses were completely prevented by macrophage depletion. In contrast, at pyrogenic doses of LPS, plasma ACTH and corticosterone responses were not significantly affected by depleting macrophages. These data demonstrate that activation of the HPAA by a subpyrogenic dose of LPS is macrophage dependent. However, macrophage-independent mechanisms mediate activation of the HPAA in response to a pyrogenic dose of LPS. 
Hypercholesterolemia in adolescents: effectiveness of screening strategies based on selected risk factors. This study evaluates the efficacy of the American Academy of Pediatrics' current recommendations for identifying hypercholesterolemia in teenagers. These guidelines advocate a screening strategy that is targeted only at high-risk individuals. Detailed information regarding risk factors for hypercholesterolemia was obtained from 1001 adolescents or their parents at three urban teen clinics during routine health assessments. In addition, serum cholesterol was measured in all adolescents. The population under study was 38.2% Hispanic, 33.5% white, 15.4% black, and 11.3% Asian, with a mean age of 15.6 years (range: 12 through 21 years); 52% were female. Based on the cholesterol values, the study population was divided into two groups: (1) normal cholesterol level, less than 200 mg/dL (n = 937, mean cholesterol value = 157 mg/dL) and (2) elevated cholesterol level, greater than or equal to 200 mg/dL (n = 64, mean cholesterol value = 228 mg/dL, range = 200 through 366 mg/dL). Application of the 1985 American Academy of Pediatrics criteria for selected screening identified 30 of 64 individuals with hypercholesterolemia (sensitivity = 47%). Criteria similar to 1988 recommendations identified 40 of 64 teenagers (sensitivity = 62%). A combination of 1985 and 1988 criteria yielded a sensitivity of 44 of 64, or 69%. The specificity of these criteria was 74%, 60%, and 53%, respectively. Despite the utilization of the 1985, 1988, or a combination of both American Academy of Pediatrics criteria for hypercholesterolemia screening, this study demonstrates that many adolescents with abnormal cholesterol levels would not be identified. 
Colonic-type adenocarcinoma of male urethra. A case of a rare primary urethral carcinoma is presented. The histochemical characteristics of this tumor are identical to those of colon tumors. The patient was treated with segmental urethrectomy. 
U.S. experience with omeprazole in duodenal ulcer. Multicenter double-blind comparative study with ranitidine. The Omeprazole DU Comparative Study Group. To assess the comparative efficacy of omeprazole 20 mg, a proton pump inhibitor, versus ranitidine 150 mg twice a day, an H2-receptor antagonist, in healing duodenal ulcers we performed a randomized, double-blind, multicenter trial in 309 patients with endoscopically diagnosed ulcers. Patients were treated for up to four weeks and were seen at week 2 and at week 4, if unhealed at week 2, for determination of ulcer status by endoscopy, review of daily self-assessment symptom diaries, and clinical laboratory including fasting serum gastrin. Gastrin levels were repeated two weeks after cessation of study medication. Evaluation of baseline demographic and laboratory parameters demonstrated no significant differences between the two groups at entry. At week 2, 42% of the omeprazole and 34% of the ranitidine-treated patients were healed (P = NS). At week 4, there was a 19% advantage in ulcer healing for the omeprazole-treated patients in comparison to those treated with ranitidine (82% vs 63%, respectively, P less than 0.05). Healing of ulcers greater than or equal to 1.0 cm occurred in 83% of those treated with omeprazole versus 37% treated with ranitidine (P less than 0.01). There were no significant differences in rate of pain relief or incidence of clinical laboratory abnormalities. Mean fasting serum gastrin value during treatment increased over the baseline in both groups, (P less than 0.05). The percent change was significantly greater with omeprazole but few patients had elevations above the upper limit of normal for the assay. Both drugs were well tolerated. Omeprazole 20 mg demonstrated superiority in healing duodenal ulcers at four weeks in comparison to ranitidine 150 mg twice daily and was more effective in healing ulcers greater than or equal to 1.0 cm. 
Colloid oncotic pressure and body water dynamics in septic and injured patients. Colloid oncotic pressure (COP) and fluid shifts were studied in 43 septic (SS) patients and 33 injured (HS) patients (ISS = 48.2). During maximal postresuscitation fluid retention, plasma volume (PV/RISA), red cell volume (RBC/51Cr), inulin space (ECF), and COP were measured. Interstitial space (IFS), PV/IFS ratio, and correlation coefficients (r) were calculated. A subgroup of 22 SS patients and 22 HS patients of equal study weight were also compared. Septic patients had greater IFS expansion (17.6 L vs. 11.5 L) than HS patients who, by inference, had more intracellular expansion. Expansion of IFS in SS patients correlated (r = -0.76, p less than 0.02) with reduced plasma COP; this was not seen in HS patients (r = -0.09, p less than 0.35). In contrast, plasma COP correlated (r = 0.72, p less than 0.001) with PV/RISA in HS patients but not in SS patients (r = 0.09, p greater than 0.35). We conclude: (1) SS patients with greater IFS expansion that correlates with reduced plasma COP likely have increased capillary permeability; and (2) HS patients with less IFS expansion that does not correlate with reduced plasma COP likely have maintained capillary permeability with altered IFS matrix configuration causing reduced protein exclusion. 
A randomized double-blind study of gallium nitrate compared with etidronate for acute control of cancer-related hypercalcemia. Hypercalcemia is a major source of morbidity and mortality in patients with cancer. Gallium nitrate and the bisphosphonate, etidronate, are new agents that have recently become available for treatment of this disorder. To directly compare therapeutic effectiveness, we conducted a randomized, double-blind, multicenter study of gallium nitrate compared with etidronate for acute control of cancer-related hypercalcemia. Gallium nitrate was administered by continuous intravenous (IV) infusion at a dose of 200 mg/m2/d. Etidronate was administered as a 4-hour IV infusion at a dose of 7.5 mg/kg. Both drugs were given daily for 5 consecutive days. Eligible patients had persistent moderate-to-severe hypercalcemia (total serum calcium [corrected for serum albumin] greater than or equal to 12.0 mg/dL) after 2 days of hospitalization and IV hydration. Seventy-one patients were randomized and treated. Twenty-eight of 34 patients (82%) who received gallium nitrate achieved normocalcemia compared with 16 of 37 patients (43%) who received etidronate (P less than .001). Patients who received etidronate required significantly greater amounts of IV fluids (P = .04) and more hypocalcemic drug treatment (P less than .05) during the poststudy period than patients who received gallium nitrate. Kaplan-Meier analysis showed a significantly longer median duration of normocalcemia for patients treated with gallium nitrate (8 days v 0 days, P = .0005). A significantly higher proportion of patients treated with gallium nitrate developed asymptomatic hypophosphatemia compared with patients treated with etidronate (97% v 43%, P less than .001). We conclude that gallium nitrate is highly effective and superior to etidronate for acute control of moderate-to-severe cancer-related hypercalcemia. 
Postural differences between asymptomatic men and women and craniofacial pain patients. A forward head position and rounded shoulders have been implicated in the development or perpetuation of craniomandibular disorders. Since women seek treatment for these problems more frequently than men, postural differences may account for the increased incidence of symptoms in women. The purposes of this study were (1) to compare the sagittal head and shoulder posture of asymptomatic men and women and (2) to compare the posture of asymptomatic and symptomatic women to determine differences in sagittal plane posture. Subjects were 20 asymptomatic men and women volunteers and nine consecutive women patients presenting for evaluation and treatment of craniomandibular pain. The subjects were compared using a valid, reliable, computer-assisted slide digitizing system called the Postural Analysis Digitizing System (PADS). Asymptomatic men and women did not differ in the postural characteristics associated with craniomandibular disorders. Sagittal posture does not appear to be a gender-related factor in these disorders. Symptomatic women, however, do display these postural characteristics to a greater extent than asymptomatic women. Evaluation and treatment of postural dysfunction should be included in the management of these patients. 
Placental bed spiral arteries in the hypertensive disorders of pregnancy. OBJECTIVE--The investigation of the histology of the placental bed spiral arteries in normal pregnancy and in pregnancies complicated by hypertension, with or without proteinura. DESIGN--An observational study, based on women having caesarean sections for clinical reasons. SUBJECTS--17 normal pregnant women, 43 with gestational hypertension, of whom 39 had proteinuria, 17 with chronic hypertension, of whom 6 had proteinuria, and 5 with unclassified hypertension. INTERVENTIONS--Placental bed biopsies obtained during caesarean section. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES--Histological appearance of sections stained with haematoxylin and eosin PAS and Lendrum's MSB. RESULTS--Biopsies containing spiral arteries were obtained from 6 normotensive and 44 hypertensive women. Trophoblastic invasion was present in 5 of the 6 normotensive biopsies but absent in the majority of those with hypertension. Subintimal proliferation was seen in all the normotensive biopsies but in only 8 of 28 from those with gestational hypertension and proteinuria. Other features seen predominantly or only in the hypertensive biopsies, in order of frequency, were medial hyperplasia, fibrin deposits, acute atherosis, endothelial vacuolation and thrombosis. CONCLUSION--Absence of physiological changes may not be peculiar to preeclampsia but may be associated or even a result of various forms of hypertension in pregnancy. Spiral arteries show a spectrum of changes in hypertensive pregnancies that do not appear to bear a clear-cut relation to the clinical signs. 
Capillary refill--is it a useful predictor of hypovolemic states? STUDY OBJECTIVES: To evaluate whether the capillary refill test can correctly differentiate between hypovolemic and euvolemic emergency department patients. DESIGN: A prospective, nonrandomized, nonblinded time series. SETTING: The orthostatic and hypotensive patients were seen in a university hospital ED with 44,000 visits per year. Blood donors were studied in the hospital's blood donor center. TYPE OF PARTICIPANTS: Thirty-two adult ED patients who presented with a history suggestive of hypovolemia and either abnormal orthostatic vital signs (19) or frank hypotension (13), and 47 volunteer blood donors who ranged in age from 19 to 83 participated. INTERVENTIONS: Capillary refill was measured before rehydration in the ED subjects and, in the donor group, before and after a 450-mL blood donation. MEASUREMENTS: Sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, and positive and negative predictive values were calculated. Analyses were stratified by age, sex, and study group. MAIN RESULTS: For the blood donor group, mean capillary refill time before donation was 1.4 seconds and after donation was 1.1 seconds. Mean capillary refill time for the orthostatic group was 1.9 seconds and for the hypotensive group was 2.8 seconds. When scored with age-sex specific upper limits of normal, the sensitivity of capillary refill in identifying hypovolemic patients was 6% for the 450-mL blood loss group, 26% for the orthostatic group, and 46% for the hypotensive group. The accuracy of capillary refill in a patient with a 50% prior probability of hypovolemia is 64%. Orthostatic vital signs were found to be more sensitive and specific than capillary refill in detecting the 450-mL blood loss. CONCLUSION: Capillary refill does not appear to be a useful test for detecting mild-to-moderate hypovolemia in adults. 
Restricted T cell expression of IL-2/IFN-gamma mRNA in human inflammatory disease. It has been difficult to demonstrate functionally distinct T cell populations in humans on the basis of cytokine secretion. As previous investigators have examined the T cell cytokine profile from immunized animals, we examined whether Th1 or Th2 type T cells could be identified in the peripheral blood or cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) immune compartments from subjects with or without inflammatory diseases. Using limiting dilution analysis and growth with PHA and IL-2/IL-4, we directly cloned a total of 177 T cells from the peripheral blood and CSF of seven subjects, four with inflammatory disease and three control subjects, and examined the cytokine message profile after stimulation with ionomycin and PMA. We found that most clones from both the peripheral blood and CSF express IL-1, IL-2, IL-4, IFN-gamma, or TNF-alpha cytokine mRNA after activation with ionomycin and PMA. All T cell clones tested produced TNF-alpha mRNA, and all but 14 produced IFN-gamma mRNA. As reported previously, Th0 cells, which produced IFN-gamma, IL-2, IL-4, and IL-5 mRNA, were found in most subjects. In striking contrast, Th1 cells, which expressed IL-2 and IFN-gamma but not IL-4 or IL-5 mRNA, were present in both peripheral blood and CSF of subjects with inflammatory disease but not found in peripheral blood or CSF of subjects without systemic inflammation. Th2 cells, expressing IL-4 and IL-5 but not IFN-gamma or IL-2 mRNA, were not found in any subject. These data present the first evidence for Th1 T cell clones in humans that may be associated with systemic inflammation. 
A critical threshold of exercise capacity in the ventilatory response to exercise in heart failure. During exercise patients with chronic left heart failure ventilate more than normal individuals at the same workload; the ratio of minute ventilation to minute production of carbon dioxide (VE/VCO2) is increased. The relation between increased VE/VCO2, severity of heart failure, and exercise capacity has not been defined. VE/VCO2 was measured in 47 patients with chronic left heart failure (New York Heart Association grades II and III) and in 1009 healthy controls. Exercise capacity was assessed by peak oxygen consumption (VO2max) during progressive exercise. In the controls VO2max ranged from 25 to 93 ml/kg/min; VE/VCO2 was 17-36 and did not correlate with VO2max. In chronic left heart failure the VO2max ranged from 9 to 29 ml/kg/min; VE/VCO2 was 22-42 and correlated strongly with VO2max. End tidal carbon dioxide and respiratory rate at peak exercise were similar in the controls and patients with chronic left heart failure. The increase in VE/VCO2 on exercise in chronic left heart failure indicates increased physiological dead space, presumably caused by a ventilation-perfusion mismatch. In the controls and patients with chronic left heart failure the relation of VE/VCO2 to VO2max was curvilinear with a threshold of VO2max below which VE/VCO2 started to rise above the normal range. This point of inflection may be explained by the existence of a critical level of cardiac function necessary to perfuse adequately all lung zones on exercise. 
Loss of both CSF1R (FMS) alleles in patients with myelodysplasia and a chromosome 5 deletion. A high proportion of patients with myelodysplasia show characteristic karyotypic abnormalities in bone marrow cells. The most distinctive of the myelodysplastic syndromes is the 5q- syndrome characterized by refractory anemia, poorly lobulated megakaryocytes, and an interstitial deletion of the long arm of chromosome 5 (5q deletion) as the sole karyotypic abnormality. Recently, several genes encoding hemopoietic growth factors and receptors, comprising the interleukins 3, 4, and 5, macrophage colony-stimulating factor, granulocyte/macrophage-colony-stimulating factor, and the receptor for macrophage-colony-stimulating factor [the CSF1R (formerly FMS) gene product], have been localized to the long arm of chromosome 5, and there has been much speculation that deletion of one or more of these genes may be critical to the pathogenesis of the associated myeloid disorders. One candidate gene is CSF1R, which is required for normal proliferation and differentiation of hemopoietic cells of the myeloid lineage. We have carried out a molecular examination of the CSF1R, both on the 5q- chromosome and on the apparently normal homologous chromosome 5, in 10 patients with myelodysplasia and a 5q deletion. We have found, using restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis and gene dosage experiments, that all 10 patients showed deletion of CSF1R; 6 of 10 were hemizygous and 4 of 10 homozygous for CSF1R loss. The homozygous CSF1R loss has been confirmed in 2 patients by an in situ hybridization technique comparing the signal in affected cells to that in control sex-mismatched cells on the same slides. In those patients considered to have homozygous CSF1R loss by DNA experiments the gene was deleted from the 5q chromosome in all cells and from the apparently normal chromosome 5 in a subset of cells. This loss of one CSF1R allele, together with loss in some cells of the remaining allele on the homologous chromosome 5, in patients with myelodysplasia indicates that this is a region of critical gene loss on 5q. The loss of the hemopoietic growth factor receptor gene CSF1R may be important in the pathogenesis of human myeloid leukemia. 
Life-threatening angioedema. Angioedema is a well-recognized edema involving the deeper layers of the skin, subcutaneous tissue, and mucosa. From July 1986 to July 1989 the authors have observed and treated 10 patients admitted to the Medical College of Virginia (MCV) Hospitals in Richmond, Virginia, with life-threatening angioedema as a complication of enalapril or captopril ingestion. Both drugs are angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors prescribed for antihypertensive activity and the ability to improve symptoms in patients with congestive heart failure. We describe the clinical symptoms, diagnosis, and management of these patients, as well as reasons for each occurrence. Sporadic reports of angioedema secondary to ACE inhibitor therapy have appeared in the literature. This represents the first time a significant series of patients from the same institution have encountered this complication over a short period of time, suggesting that the complication may be much more common than has been thought. 
Brucellosis as a cause of severe colitis. A 16-yr-old girl presented with osteomyelitis and massive rectal bleeding. Colonoscopy revealed severe nonspecific colitis. Multiple laboratory investigations failed to disclose the etiology of either the bone or colon infections. Empiric treatment with corticosteroids and sulfasalazine resulted in only transient improvement. One month after discharge, her original symptoms recurred. Blood and pus cultures at this time yielded Brucella melitensis. After tetracycline treatment, the patient recovered. At 1-yr follow-up, she was found completely asymptomatic. Although osteomyelitis is a well-known manifestation of brucellosis, colitis related to this agent has so far not been described. 
Atrial fibrillation as a risk factor for deep venous thrombosis and pulmonary emboli in stroke patients. In 539 consecutive stroke patients admitted to a rehabilitation department, we studied the possible role of atrial fibrillation as a risk factor for deep venous thrombosis and pulmonary embolism by analyzing a series of relevant clinical data in patients with and without atrial fibrillation and in patients with and without venous thromboembolic complications. Deep venous thrombosis as well as advanced age and cardiac disease were significantly (p less than 0.001) more frequent in patients with atrial fibrillation. However, in a model of simultaneous logistic regression carried out on the presence of absence of venous thromboembolic complications, atrial fibrillation was the only significant risk factor. In view of the morbidity and mortality linked to deep venous thrombosis, our findings argue for preventive anticoagulation therapy in stroke patients suffering from atrial fibrillation and merit further study. 
Zoladex versus orchiectomy in treatment of advanced prostate cancer: a randomized trial. Zoladex Prostate Study Group. We report preliminary results for the first 164 patients enrolled in a multicenter study comparing the endocrine effects, efficacy, and safety of 3.6 mg of goserelin acetate (Zoladex) and orchiectomy in patients with Stage D2 prostate cancer. Eighty-one patients were randomly allocated to receive Zoladex and 83 to orchiectomy. The median follow-up time for all patients was two hundred ten days. Median serum levels of testosterone were reduced to castrate levels (less than 50 ng/dL) within four weeks in both groups and remained suppressed for up to sixty weeks. An objective response according to modified criteria of the National Prostatic Cancer Project was observed in 81 percent and 78 percent of patients in the Zoladex and orchiectomy groups, respectively. There were no statistically significant differences between treatment groups in the distributions of time to treatment failure or time to disease progression. The most commonly reported adverse events in both treatment groups were hot flashes, cancer-related pain, unspecified pain, and urinary symptoms. These results suggest that Zoladex may offer an alternative to orchiectomy in the treatment of advanced prostate cancer. 
Lateral pharyngeal space abscess as a consequence of regional anesthesia. Trismus may be a complication from local anesthesia. Patients with trismus of unknown cause after dental treatment should be evaluated thoroughly. The dentist should perform a complete examination and establish a differential diagnosis to avoid missing a serious or life-threatening infection. A right lateral pharyngeal space infection developed after a general restorative procedure that involved an inferior alveolar nerve injection on the same side. The patient's severe trismus required awake intubation, incision and drainage while the patient was under general anesthesia, treatment with antibiotics and ten days of hospitalization. 
Occupational contact dermatitis due to acrylonitrile. Within DSM Chemicals BV, a producer of acrylonitrile, skin complaints are frequent. The majority of these are of an irritant nature, while a smaller portion is based on acquired allergies. Allergological examination revealed 5 employees with an allergy to acrylonitrile. 1 of these subjects also developed paraesthesiae in the skin sites affected, a finding not previously described for acrylonitrile. In the guinea pig maximization test (GPMT), acrylonitrile showed strong allergenic potential. For prevention and treatment of contact allergologic disorders, close cooperation between occupational health officer, dermatologist and toxicologist in chemical companies is recommended. 
The causes of hospital-treated acute lower respiratory tract infection in children. OBJECTIVE: To determine the etiologic agents in children with acute lower respiratory infection. DESIGN: A survey of a series of patients. SETTING: General pediatric hospital serving an urban population with and without referrals in Helsinki, Finland. PARTICIPANTS: 135 Finnish children aged 2 months to 15 years (mean, 1.75 years), with clinically defined acute lower respiratory infection (with difficulty of breathing), or found to have fever and a pneumonic infiltrate on chest roentgenogram. SELECTION PROCEDURES: Consecutive sample on voluntary basis. INTERVENTIONS: None. MAIN RESULTS: Of 121 children with adequate samples, an etiologic diagnosis could be established in 84 (70%): 30 (25%) had bacterial, 30 (25%) viral, and 24 (20%) mixed infections. Antibody assays alone identified the agent in 91% of positive cases. CONCLUSIONS: Bacterial infections are common but generally underestimated in acute lower respiratory infection; serologic methods add significantly to their detection. 
Unusual clinical presentation of malignant histiocytosis in a 70-year-old woman. A 70-year-old woman was admitted for evaluation of hepatosplenomegaly, fever and elevated serum LDH levels. A biopsy specimen of the liver revealed histiocytic proliferation at the portal triad, and a mild degree of hepatitis. A bone marrow biopsy specimen showed proliferation of histiocytes with minimal immaturity and atypism, and haemophagocytosis by the proliferated histiocytes. Fever, hepatosplenomegaly and elevation of LDH levels all disappeared spontaneously, and presumptive diagnosis of benign reticulosis with haemophagocytosis was made. One year later, fever, hepatosplenomegaly and elevation of LDH levels redeveloped, and the liver and bone marrow biopsy specimen showed proliferation of unequivocally malignant histiocytes. The patient died as a result of disseminated intravascular coagulation with shock 20 d later. We concluded that, in this case, malignant histiocytosis first presented as benign haemophagocytic reticulosis and, 1 year later, there was a typical malignant presentation. 
Avoidance of tolerance and lack of rebound with intermittent dose titrated transdermal glyceryl trinitrate. The Transdermal Nitrate Investigators. OBJECTIVES--To investigate the efficacy of transdermal glyceryl trinitrate given continuously and with a nocturnal nitrate free period. DESIGN--Double blind placebo controlled study with two parallel limbs. SETTING--Multicentre trial. PATIENTS--52 patients randomised to receive either continuous treatment (23 patients) or intermittent treatment with an individually titrated dose (29 patients) for 14 days: both treatments were compared with placebo in a cross-over fashion. INTERVENTION--Continuous treatment with 10 mg per 24 hours of transdermal glyceryl trinitrate or intermittent transdermal glyceryl trinitrate titrated to give an arbitrary 10 mm Hg drop in systolic blood pressure (mean dose 18.2 mg) given over approximately 16 hours. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE--Treadmill exercise stress testing and ambulatory monitoring of the ST segment after 14 days' treatment. RESULTS--After 14 days' intermittent treatment resting supine and standing systolic blood pressure fell by 7.5 mm Hg (95% confidence interval 2.7 to 12.2) and 9.0 mm Hg (95% CI 3.4 to 14.5) respectively (p less than 0.01); resting heart rate was unchanged. Mean heart rate at 1 mm ST segment depression rose by 11.9 beats/min (CI 1.1 to 23.7) (p less than 0.05), mean time to onset of angina increased by 59 seconds (CI 10.8 to 108) (p less than 0.05), and total exercise duration increased by 40 seconds (p less than 0.05). These changes were not seen after continuous treatment. The frequency of ischaemic episodes was not reduced with either regimen nor was the circadian distribution of these episodes altered, in particular nocturnal episodes did not increase during intermittent treatment. CONCLUSION--Tolerance to glyceryl trinitrate was avoided by the use of individually titrated doses administered with a nocturnal nitrate free period. There was no evidence of "rebound" on ambulatory monitoring during this treatment. 
Management of severe frontobasilar skull fractures. Immediate reconstruction of severely comminuted frontobasilar skull fractures involving the frontal sinus can be accomplished safely if the sinus is cranialized and the floor of the anterior cranial fossa is totally reconstructed. Operative time can be reduced if the pieces of the frontal bone are reassembled and stabilized with rigid fixation devices out of the surgical field and thus made ready for reinsertion as a single unit after any necessary neurosurgical procedures are completed. Immediate reconstruction provides postoperative protection for the brain and eliminates the need to return the patient to the operating room for cranioplasty at a later date. 
Nomenclature of vasculitic syndromes: a historical perspective. Since the original description of periarteritis nodosa (PAN) in 1866, the number of recognized forms of so-called idiopathic vasculitis has risen to about a dozen. Their relation to each other and their nature remain unclear, although the recent discovery of antineutrophil cytoplasmic autoantibodies (ANCA) promises a clue to the origin of at least some of them, particularly Wegener's granulomatosis (WG) and perhaps also Churg-Strauss syndrome (CSS). On the other hand, PAN appears to be a nonspecific syndrome of various etiologies. 
Comparative efficacy and safety of bepridil and diltiazem in chronic stable angina pectoris refractory to diltiazem. The Bepridil Collaborative Study Group. The efficacy and safety of bepridil hydrochloride (200 to 400 mg/day) were evaluated in patients with chronic stable angina refractory to maximal tolerated doses of diltiazem (median 360 mg/day) in a randomized, multicenter, double-blind, parallel study. Baseline diltiazem data were obtained during a 2-week period, after which 86 patients were randomized to bepridil (n = 46) or diltiazem (n = 40). Angina frequency, nitroglycerin consumption and ischemic manifestations induced by exercise treadmill testing were evaluated over 8 weeks. Bepridil significantly (p less than 0.05) increased time to angina onset, time to 1 and 2 mm of ST-segment depression, total exercise time and total work over baseline values. Changes in time to angina onset and time to 1 mm of ST-segment depression were significantly (p less than 0.05) greater for bepridil than for diltiazem. Angina frequency and nitroglycerin consumption did not differ significantly between groups. Compared with baseline, bepridil significantly (p less than 0.001) decreased heart rate (mean 4 beats/min) and prolonged QTc (mean 35 ms). The most frequent adverse effects in both groups were nausea, asthenia, dizziness, headache and diarrhea. Four patients taking bepridil and 1 taking diltiazem withdrew from the study because of adverse reactions. No sudden deaths, myocardial infarctions or instances of sustained ventricular tachycardia or torsades de pointes occurred in either group. The data indicate that bepridil provided safe and effective antianginal and antiischemic therapy in patients with chronic stable angina who exhibited less than optimal response to maximal tolerated doses of diltiazem. 
Chemical meningism after lumbar facet joint block with local anaesthetic and steroids. A case is reported in which chemical meningism occurred after lumbar facet joint block with methylprednisolone acetate and bupivacaine. This complication was probably due to inadvertent dural puncture. The use of steroids in facet joint injections is questioned. 
Sural nerve morphometry in diabetic autonomic and painful sensory neuropathy. A clinicopathological study. Observations have been made on a selected series of insulin-dependent patients with neuropathy, subdivided into three groups: (1) severe autonomic neuropathy with an accompanying painless sensory neuropathy; (2) severe autonomic neuropathy with a chronic painful sensory neuropathy; and (3) chronic or acute painful sensory neuropathy with no autonomic neuropathy. All three groups showed a loss of large and small myelinated nerve fibres in sural nerve biopsy specimens which was greater in Groups 1 and 2. Regenerative activity was prominent in all three groups, but least in Group 3. Teased fibre studies showed evidence both of axonal regeneration and remyelination. Active fibre degeneration was rare. Measurements of g ratio (axon diameter:total fibre diameter) gave no indication of axonal atrophy. The density of unmyelinated axons was reduced in all three groups, as was their median diameter. Vibration sense threshold was positively correlated with the total number of myelinated fibres and thermal sensory threshold with median unmyelinated axon diameter but not with total unmyelinated axon numbers. No correlation between the occurrence of pain and active degeneration of myelinated fibres or with regenerative activity either in myelinated or unmyelinated axons was detectable. Assessment of differential loss of large or small myelinated nerve fibres was difficult because of the presence of large numbers of small regenerating myelinated axons. The results are discussed in relation to the concept of 'diabetic small fibre neuropathy' and the causation of pain in diabetic neuropathy. 
Four years of North American registry home parenteral nutrition outcome data and their implications for patient management. The OASIS Registry started annual collection of longitudinal data on patients on home parenteral nutrition (HPN) in 1984. This report describes outcome profiles on 1594 HPN patients in seven disease categories. Analysis showed clinical outcome was principally a reflection of the underlying diagnosis. Patients with Crohn's disease, ischemic bowel disease, motility disorders, radiation enteritis, and congenital bowel dysfunction all had a fairly long-term clinical outcome, whereas those with active cancer and acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) had a short-term outcome. The long-term group had a 3-year survival rate of 65 to 80%, they averaged 2.6 complications requiring hospitalization per year, and 49% experienced complete rehabilitation. The short-term group had a mean survival of 6 months; they averaged 4.6 complications per year and about 15% experienced complete rehabilitation. The registry data also indicated HPN was used for 19,700 patients in 1987 with therapy growth averaging about 8% per year. This growth was chiefly from new cancer patients. The number of new patients with long-term disorders in whom HPN was initiated appeared rather constant. We conclude that these clinical outcome assessments justify HPN for long-term patients, but the utility and appropriateness of HPN for the cancer and AIDS patients remains uncertain and requires further study. Medical, social, and fiscal aspects of HPN management in long-term and short-term patients appear to involve quite separate considerations. 
Fluid collections developing after pancreatic transplantation: radiologic evaluation and intervention. The usefulness of real-time sonography, duplex sonography, computed tomography (CT), cystography, diagnostic aspiration, and percutaneous drainage in the diagnosis and treatment of peri-pancreatic-transplant fluid collections was retrospectively assessed in 46 recipients of extraperitoneal pancreatic transplants. Forty-four abnormalities were identified in the extraperitoneal space at sonography, including four pancreatic pseudocysts associated with malfunction of the pancreatic duct, seven abscesses, six hematomas, nine urinomas, six early postoperative fluid collections that spontaneously resolved, six cases of pancreatitis, and six cases of vascular occlusion. Sonography (including pulsed Doppler sonography) was the procedure of choice in detecting fluid collections and diagnosing pancreatitis, rejection, vascular thrombosis, and pancreatic duct malfunction. CT was diagnostic in four of six hematomas; cystography was diagnostic in seven of nine urinomas. Sonographically guided percutaneous intervention enabled three patients to avoid surgery and allowed optimal surgical planning for six patients. 
Brachial approach to emergency cardiac catheterization during thrombolytic therapy for acute myocardial infarction. TAMI Study Group. The use of the brachial approach to acute coronary intervention has not been previously studied. In the course of the Thrombolysis and Angioplasty in Myocardial Infarction (TAMI) trials, we used the transbrachial approach to cardiac catheterization with or without angioplasty in 202 of 704 (28.6%) patients. The baseline characteristics of age, sex, risk factors, medical history, time from symptom onset to therapy, and left ventricular function were similar for the 2 different approaches. Time from therapy to coronary angiography was not delayed by the brachial approach compared with the femoral approach: 97.1 +/- 26 min vs. 99.9 +/- 133.8 min, respectively. Chemical patency was established in 78 vs. 73% of patients and technical success with acute PTCA with the brachial approach was 89% vs. 78% with the femoral approach. Clinical outcomes were quite similar with respect to death (6 vs. 6%), reocclusion (10 vs. 14%), and emergency coronary bypass surgery (5 vs. 6%). Baseline hematocrit was 43.9 +/- 4.4 and 43.5 +/- 4.8, respectively with a nadir of 32.9 +/- 5.6 vs. 33.0 +/- 5.4. The need for vascular repair occurred in 1% vs. 3% of patients and retroperitoneal hemorrhage was documented in 1% vs. 1% of patients. This study indicates that in the hands of experienced operators the transbrachial approach to acute coronary intervention in the acute phase of treatment with thrombolytic therapy can be used with equal risks and efficacy as the femoral approach. 
Human orthotopic small intestine transplantation: radiologic assessment. The authors describe the postoperative anatomy and review the radiologic examinations of five patients who underwent orthotopic small intestine or combined orthotopic liver and small intestine transplantation. Mucosal thickening of the transplanted intestine was demonstrated on the first postoperative contrast material-enhanced images and was due to submucosal edema. This resolved within 2 weeks in the long-term survivors. Bowel peristalsis appeared normal as early as 31 days after transplantation. Contrast-enhanced examinations of the intestine were useful to exclude surgical complications such as anastomotic leaks or strictures, but were insensitive for biopsy-proved cytomegalovirus enteritis or rejection. 
Renal and extra-renal levels of renin mRNA in experimental hypertension. 1. Using a ribonuclease-protection assay, renin mRNA levels were compared in the kidneys, livers, brains, hearts and adrenal glands of two-kidney, one-clip Goldblatt hypertensive rats with those of age-matched control rats at 4 weeks ('early') and 20 weeks ('chronic') after clipping, and in the kidneys and adrenal glands of rats treated for 3 weeks with deoxycorticosterone and salt (deoxycorticosterone-salt hypertension) with those of control rats. 2. While marked changes were observed in kidney renin mRNA levels in all three experimental groups compared with their respective controls, in most of the extra-renal tissue studied minimal, if any, difference was seen in renin mRNA levels between the hypertensive and control rats. 3. The findings suggest that in these extra-renal tissues renin gene expression is differently regulated from that in the kidney, and particularly that it is not profoundly affected by changes in the level of circulating angiotensin II. 4. An increase in renin mRNA was observed in the adrenal glands of the 'chronic' Goldblatt rats, which may be of relevance to the maintenance of hypertension in this model. 
Solitary colonic metastasis from renal-cell carcinoma 17 years after nephrectomy. Report of a case. Late recurrence of renal-cell carcinoma can present many years after nephrectomy. To the best of our knowledge, we are reporting the first known case of solitary metastatic renal-cell carcinoma to the colon occurring 17 years after nephrectomy. 
Pedicle patch urethroplasty. The pedicle patch urethroplasty provides an alternative single-stage vascularised graft procedure for the repair of moderately severe hypospadias. Over a 7-year period, 38 primary hypospadias repairs were performed employing this technique. The fistula rate was 18% in the 34 patients reviewed, but there were few other significant complications. The operation is recommended when the urethral plate can be preserved and the penis straightened in boys who are unsuitable for a meatal-based flap. 
Brachial approach to management of an abdominal aortic occlusion with prolonged lysis and subsequent angioplasty. The brachial approach for recanalizing an abdominal aortic occlusion utilizing a combination of thrombolysis and balloon angioplasty is described. The patient was deemed too ill to permit any surgical intervention. The unique aspects of the procedure are described including angioplasty of the unmasked (by lytic therapy) aortoiliac bifurcation stenoses utilizing double wires and double balloons through a single arteriotomy site. The advantages of the brachial approach in managing this unusual entity are outlined. 
Regression of left ventricular hypertrophy in the short-term treatment of hypertension with isradipine. This was a study of the effectiveness of isradipine, a calcium antagonist of the dihydropyridine group, in reversing left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) in patients with mild-to-moderate hypertension. Mean arterial pressure was effectively reduced at 90 days of treatment (from 129.5 +/- 2.0 to 111.5 +/- 2.8 mm Hg; P less than .001). The electrocardiographic Romhilt-Estes score for LVH showed early reduction at 45 days of treatment (from 7.1 +/- 0.6 to 5.1 +/- 0.4 points; P less than .001), and further diminutions were observed at 90 days of treatment (3.8 +/- 0.4 points; P less than .01). The echocardiographically determined left ventricular mass indices confirmed these findings (from 175.0 +/- 8.9 to 141.7 +/- 5.5 and to 124.8 +/- 4.2 g/m2; P less than .001) for 45 and 90 days, respectively. The results indicate that isradipine is effective in reducing left ventricular mass and that these reductions are observed early in the course of treatment. 
Neutralization of low molecular weight heparin by polybrene prevents thromboxane release and severe pulmonary hypertension in awake sheep Protamine reversal of heparin anticoagulation in patients is occasionally associated with life-threatening acute pulmonary hypertension. In a sheep model, we evaluated the effect on this adverse cardiopulmonary reaction of modifying the type of heparin (low molecular weight heparin compared with unfractionated heparin) and the type of heparin antagonist (polybrene compared with protamine). Protamine reversal of low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) and polybrene reversal of unfractionated heparin induced more than a 10-fold increase of plasma thromboxane B2 levels, a threefold increase of pulmonary vascular resistance and pulmonary artery pressure, and a 25% decrease of PaO2. A similar adverse reaction followed protamine reversal of conventional unfractionated heparin. However, with polybrene (1 mg/kg) reversal of LMWH (1 mg/kg), we measured neither pulmonary hypertension (pulmonary artery pressure was 22.6 +/- 3.6 mm Hg at 1 minute after polybrene reversal of LMWH compared with 47.9 +/- 4.2 mm Hg after protamine reversal of unfractionated heparin, p less than 0.005 groups differ), hypoxemia (PaO2 was unchanged 2 minutes after polybrene compared with a decrease of 26 mm Hg 2 minutes after protamine, p less than 0.05), nor acute release of thromboxane into arterial plasma (thromboxane B2 was 0.2 +/- 0.1 at 1 minute after polybrene compared with 3.7 +/- 1.7 ng/ml at 1 minute after protamine, p less than 0.005). The hemodynamic effects and mediator release were also benign after neutralization of larger doses of LMWH (3 mg/kg) by polybrene (3 mg/kg). The increases of activated clotting time and activated partial thromboplastin time due to both types of heparin were completely reversed with polybrene. Anti-Xa activity increased to more than 3 IU/ml 4 minutes after LMWH anticoagulation (p less than 0.01) but was only partially neutralized by polybrene. Various polyanion-polycation complexes that are formed when heparin anticoagulation is reversed induce thromboxane release and acute pulmonary vasoconstriction in awake sheep. Reversal of LMWH anticoagulation with polybrene does not elicit this adverse reaction. 
Antibody to hepatitis C virus and liver disease in volunteer blood donors. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the specificity of antibodies to hepatitis C virus (anti-HCV) and their relation to liver disease in blood donors. DESIGN: Case series of consecutive blood donors found positive for anti-HCV by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Patients were evaluated for antibody specificity using a recombinant immunoblotting assay (RIBA) and were evaluated for biochemical evidence of liver disease. Patients showing increased alanine aminotransferase (ALT) levels had a liver biopsy. SETTING: University hospital. PARTICIPANTS: Fifty consecutive blood donors found to be anti-HCV positive on both an initial and repeat ELISA. Inclusion criteria were as follows: an absence of hepatitis B surface antigens and non-organ-specific autoantibodies; a daily alcohol intake of less than 50 g; no history of recent hepatotoxic drug use; and normal serum levels of alpha 1 antitrypsin, ceruloplasmin, and copper. MAIN RESULTS: Anti-HCV positivity was confirmed by RIBA in only 13 of 50 donors (26%) who had positive ELISA results. These 13 donors had an elevated ALT level and histologic evidence of chronic hepatitis, which was active in 8 patients (62%) and had already produced cirrhosis in 2 patients (15%). In contrast, the 17 donors with an intermediate RIBA pattern had only mild and often nonspecific histologic liver abnormalities. The 20 patients with a negative RIBA result had normal ALT levels. CONCLUSION: In blood donors, the anti-HCV RIBA is not only more specific than the anti-HCV ELISA, but is also useful in identifying patients who have an underlying chronic liver disease. 
Late renal dysfunction in adult survivors of bone marrow transplantation. Until recently long-term renal toxicity has not been considered a major late complication of bone marrow transplantation (BMT). Late renal dysfunction has been described in a pediatric population status post-BMT which was attributable to the radiation in the preparatory regimen. A thorough review of adults with this type of late renal dysfunction has not previously been described. Fourteen of 103 evaluable adult patients undergoing allogeneic (96) or autologous (7) bone marrow transplantation, predominantly for leukemia and lymphomas, at the Medical College of Wisconsin (Milwaukee, WI) have had a syndrome of renal insufficiency characterized by increased serum creatinine, decreased glomerular filtration rate, anemia, and hypertension. This syndrome developed at a median of 9 months (range, 4.5 to 26 months) posttransplantation in the absence of specific identifiable causes. The cumulative probability of having this renal dysfunction is 20% at 1 year. Renal biopsies performed on seven of these cases showed the endothelium widely separated from the basement membrane, extreme thickening of the glomerular basement membrane, and microthrombi. Previous chemotherapy, antibiotics, and antifungals as well as cyclosporin may add to and possibly potentiate a primary chemoradiation marrow transplant renal injury, but this clinical syndrome is most analogous to clinical and experimental models of radiation nephritis. This late marrow transplant-associated nephritis should be recognized as a potentially limiting factor in the use of some intensive chemoradiation conditioning regimens used for BMT. Some selective attenuation of the radiation to the kidneys may decrease the incidence of this renal dysfunction. 
Pulmonary sequelae of prolonged total venoarterial bypass: evaluation with a new experimental model. Total normothermic venoarterial bypass was established in 6 healthy pigs over a period of 18 hours. A heparin-coated closed extracorporeal system was used and no heparin was administered systemically. During the bypass period the main pulmonary artery was occluded and the heart was maintained in a beating state. All the animals maintained stable hemodynamics and normal blood gases during the entire period of bypass. In the postbypass period, the central hemodynamics continued to be stable while the arterial oxygen tension (inspired oxygen fraction = 0.21) decreased significantly (p less than or equal to 0.05). The total body oxygen uptake, on the other hand, remained unaltered. All the animals died within 4 hours after weaning off the venoarterial bypass circuit on account of pulmonary edema in 2 and cardiac arrest in 4. Death was preceded by progressive pulmonary hypertension and lactacidosis in all the animals. Histological examination of the lungs showed pulmonary parenchymal damage ranging from interstitial edema to intraalveolar hemorrhage and parenchymal necrosis involving more than 80% of the pulmonary parenchyma. A normothermic total venoarterial bypass of 18 hours duration or more produces pulmonary edema of varying severity, pulmonary hypertension, pulmonary parenchymal necrosis, and lactacidosis in healthy juvenile pigs, resulting uniformly in their death. Despite these sequelae the systemic arterial hypoxemia may only be mild to moderate. 
Evaluation and management of patients with both peripheral vascular and coronary artery disease. The prevalence of serious angiographic coronary artery disease ranges from 37% to 78% in patients undergoing operation for peripheral vascular disease. Clinical studies have demonstrated that cardiac outcome after peripheral vascular surgery is not adequately predicted by the standard criteria of history, physical findings and rest electrocardiogram. An adequate exercise work load, left ventricular function and thallium redistribution have proved important in perioperative risk stratification. The choice of a perioperative functional cardiac test depends on patient-related factors and the nature of the peripheral vascular operation. Although procedures involving aortic cross-clamping exert a greater hemodynamic stress than do carotid endarterectomy and femoral popliteal surgery, late cardiac morbidity and mortality are significant in all patients with atherosclerotic disease. The decision to proceed with preoperative coronary angiography and myocardial revascularization should be based primarily on indications independent of the peripheral vascular procedure. However, peripheral vascular surgery may influence the timing of myocardial revascularization. Patients with high risk or unstable coronary artery disease may benefit from preoperative coronary revascularization, although this hypothesis remains unproved. In all patients, careful monitoring during and after operation is essential. All patients with peripheral vascular disease should be considered to be at lifelong risk for fatal and nonfatal cardiac events and should undergo appropriate clinical and laboratory evaluation and be treated accordingly. 
Perforation of the globe--a complication of peribulbar anaesthesia. Peribulbar anaesthesia has been recommended as a safer alternative to retrobulbar anaesthesia. We report a case of perforation of the globe sustained during peribulbar anaesthesia which resulted in blindness. Orbital injections are potentially dangerous, be they peribulbar or retrobulbar. To minimise the risk, short, blunt needles are advocated for the peribulbar route. 
Comparative study of sucralfate 2 grams twice daily versus sucralfate 1 gram four times daily in the treatment of benign gastric ulcers in outpatients. In a double-blind, randomized study, we compared the healing of gastric ulcer during a twice-daily regimen of 2 g sucralfate or sucralfate 1 g q.i.d. Patients receiving the former therapy received the tablets one-half hour before breakfast and at bedtime. Patients receiving sucralfate 1 g q.i.d. received their therapy 30 minutes before breakfast, lunch, and supper, and at bedtime. The study included 52 patients with endoscopically proven gastric ulcer; 41 patients completed the study. Healing was endoscopically assessed at 8 weeks and 12 weeks. After 8 and 12 weeks the healing rate for sucralfate 2 g b.i.d. was 67% and 92%, respectively; the healing rate of sucralfate 1 g q.i.d. was 59% and 71%, respectively. No statistically significant difference was found between the two regimens. The results suggest that 2 g sucralfate twice daily is as effective in the healing of gastric ulcer as 1 g sucralfate q.i.d. 
Cisplatin combination chemotherapy for elderly patients with urothelial tumours. The proportion of cancer patients who receive potentially curative therapy declines with increasing chronological age. Between January 1979 and January 1988, 36 patients aged from 76 to 84 years (median 78) consented to cisplatin combination chemotherapy. Eighteen patients received 1 to 7 cycles of adjuvant chemotherapy (median 5). This resulted in a drop in creatinine clearance rate from 70 +/- 28.5 ml/min to 49 +/- 20 ml/min. Eight patients (44%) are alive without evidence of disease, with a whole group median survival of 23 months. The dose intensity of cisplatin was found to predict recurrence. Eighteen other patients were treated for metastatic disease; 39% had an objective response after receiving 2 to 9 cycles (median 7). Only 2 patients (11%) are alive and free of disease. In this group no significant kidney damage occurred and the dose intensity of cisplatin did not predict response. Treatment resulted in a significant sepsis rate (39%) and 6 patients (17%) withdrew from treatment because of toxicity. It was concluded that cisplatin combination chemotherapy can be administered without treatment-related death and its efficacy is similar to that in younger patients. Age should not exclude patients from the potential benefit of such therapy. An important cause of reduced benefit from chemotherapy among elderly patients may be the reduced dosage of cisplatin. 
Haem arginate in acute hereditary coproporphyria. An 11 year old boy presented with severe acute hereditary coproporphyria. Despite supportive measures his condition deteriorated after admission. Haem arginate, started two days after presentation, produced appreciable inhibition of porphyrin precursor overproduction and clinical improvement. 
The depth of thermal necrosis using the CO2 laser: a comparison of the superpulsed mode and conventional mode. In order to compare the depth of thermal necrosis on human skin using the superpulse CO2 laser to the conventional CO2 laser, single impacts of various laser settings were fired at both ends of fusiform excisions done for other clinical purposes. These laser impacts were then examined histologically and the superpulse mode was found to limit the depth of thermal necrosis by approximately a factor of two. 
Altered beta adrenergic receptor function in subjects with symptomatic mitral valve prolapse. Individuals with mitral valve prolapse (MVP) frequently show symptoms of a hyperadrenergic state. beta adrenergic receptor characteristics were compared in the lymphocytes of subjects with symptomatic MVP and control subjects during rest and exercise. At rest, the proportion of receptors binding agonist with high affinity, as determined from isoproterenol competition for (-)[125I]-iodopindolol binding sites, was greater in MVP subjects than in controls. With exercise, the proportion of high-affinity receptors in MVP subjects decreased to control levels. Isoproterenol stimulation of lymphocyte 3',5'-cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cyclic AMP) also was greater in MVP subjects than in controls at rest, but not during exercise. Plasma catecholamine concentrations in MVP subjects were normal during both rest and exercise. Unlike exercise, isoproterenol infusion elicited clinical manifestations of increased adrenergic responsiveness in MVP subjects. The beta receptor in exercised MVP subjects exhibited unusually high affinity agonist binding (i.e. a lower dissociation constant KH than in either the same subjects at rest or exercised controls) and also abnormal coupling to the stimulatory guanine nucleotide-binding regulatory protein (GS) of adenylate cyclase, as reflected by the inability of guanine nucleotide to convert the receptor to a low-affinity state. These findings suggest that functional alteration of the beta adrenergic receptor, in the absence of abnormal plasma catecholamine levels, might contribute to the hyperadrenergic state of MVP subjects at rest. However, desensitization of high affinity beta receptors or altered receptor-GS coupling might preserve normal adrenergic responsiveness during exercise. 
Radiofrequency catheter ablation of the atrioventricular junction from the left ventricle. BACKGROUND. The purpose of this study was to describe a new technique for catheter ablation of the atrioventricular junction using radiofrequency energy delivered in the left ventricle. METHODS AND RESULTS. Catheter ablation of the atrioventricular (AV) junction using a catheter positioned across the tricuspid annulus was unsuccessful in eight patients with a mean +/- SD age of 51 +/- 19 years who had AV nodal reentry tachycardia (three patients), orthodromic tachycardia using a concealed midseptal accessory pathway, atrial tachycardia, atrial flutter (two patients), or atrial fibrillation. Before attempts at catheter ablation of the AV junction, each patient had been refractory to pharmacological therapy, and four had failed attempts at either catheter modification of the AV node using radiofrequency energy or surgical and catheter ablation of the accessory pathway. Conventional right-sided catheter ablation of the AV junction using radiofrequency energy in six patients and both radiofrequency energy and direct current shocks in two patients was ineffective. The mean amplitude of the His bundle potential recorded at the tricuspid annulus at the sites of unsuccessful AV junction ablation was 0.1 +/- 0.08 mV, with a maximum His amplitude of 0.03-0.28 mV. A 7F deflectable-tip quadripolar electrode catheter with a 4-mm distal electrode was positioned against the upper left ventricular septum using a retrograde aortic approach from the femoral artery. Third-degree AV block was induced in each of the eight patients with 20-36 W applied for 15-30 seconds. The His bundle potential at the sites of successful AV junction ablation ranged from 0.06 to 0.99 mV, with a mean of 0.27 +/- 0.32 mV. There was no rise in the creatine kinase-MB fraction and no complications occurred. An intrinsic escape rhythm of 30-60 beats/min was present in seven of the eight patients. Each patient received a permanent pacemaker and has been asymptomatic during 3-13 months of follow-up. CONCLUSIONS. Catheter ablation of the AV junction can be achieved effectively and safely using radiofrequency energy delivered in the left ventricle when the conventional right-sided approach is unsuccessful. 
Toward an integrated understanding of fibromyalgia syndrome. II. Psychological and phenomenological aspects. The present paper is the second of a 2-part series in which extant empirical literature concerning fibromyalgia syndrome (FS) is reviewed in order to provide a preliminary approach to forming an integrated understanding of the syndrome. Research on psychological disturbance in FS is reviewed with particular emphasis on affective dysfunction among FS patients. The phenomenology of FS is then described. We attempt to suggest that FS represents a quantitatively and qualitatively experience distinct from similar chronic pain syndromes. Substantive findings in FS research are summarized in the final section and potential ways in which these findings might be integrated to provide a more cohesive model for future research are suggested. 
Phonolexical agraphia. Superimposition of acquired lexical agraphia on developmental phonological dysgraphia. Study of neuropsychological sequelae of a focal acquired brain lesion may bring out and help delineate the features of a compensated developmental language disorder and its anatomical substrate. A left-handed man with a history of phonological developmental dyslexia and dysgraphia learned in early adulthood to read and write using a lexical system. Following a small posterior right parietal infarct when aged 56 yrs he developed a severe agraphia displaying features of phonological dysgraphia with impaired segmentation and features of lexical agraphia. Writing was severely impaired for all classes of word and nonword stimuli but his errors did not resemble those attributable to a deficit in the system responsible for the short-term storage of the graphemic representation of a word (graphemic output buffer). These observations imply that an acquired lexical agraphia has been superimposed on his developmental phonological dysgraphia, resulting in a combined or 'phonolexical' agraphia. 
Siriraj stroke score and validation study to distinguish supratentorial intracerebral haemorrhage from infarction. OBJECTIVES--To develop a simple, reliable, and safe diagnostic tool for acute stroke syndromes in a setting where computerised brain scanning was not readily available and to validate its accuracy with regard to pathological types of stroke. DESIGN--13 clinical variables that potentially might differentiate supratentorial cerebral haemorrhage from infarction were recorded and tested by multivariate analysis in a prospective study of 174 patients with acute stroke. In developing the Siriraj stroke score stepwise discriminant analysis of the variables was followed by a linear discriminant equation to differentiate between supratentorial haemorrhage and infarction. The score obtained was validated against scores in 206 other patients with stroke, computerised brain scans being used for definitive diagnosis. SETTING--Siriraj Hospital Medical School, Mahidol University, Bangkok. SUBJECTS--Prospective study: 174 consecutive patients with acute supratentorial stroke syndrome (not subarachnoid haemorrhage) admitted to Siriraj Hospital during 1984-5; validation study: 206 patients admitted to Siriraj Hospital or another hospital for supratentorial intracerebral haemorrhage or infarction. RESULTS--The Siriraj stroke score was developed and calculated as (2.5 x level of consciousness) + (2 x vomiting) + (2 x headache) + (0.1 x diastolic blood pressure) - (3 x atheroma markers) - 12. A score above 1 indicates supratentorial intracerebral haemorrhage, while a score below -1 indicates infarction. The score between 1 and -1 represents an equivocal result needing a computerised brain scan or probability curve to verify the diagnosis. In the validation study of the Siriraj stroke score the diagnostic sensitivities of the score for cerebral haemorrhage and cerebral infarction were 89.3% and 93.2% respectively, with an overall predictive accuracy of 90.3%. CONCLUSION--The Siriraj stroke score is widely accepted and applied in hospitals throughout Thailand as a simple and reliable bedside method for diagnosing acute stroke. 
Vagal body tumors. Six cases of vagal body tumor are reviewed. All first presented as painless neck masses with normal cranial nerve function. Otologic symptoms were infrequent, occurring only with temporal bone involvement. In true vagal paragangliomas, cranial nerve and auditory function is usually preserved until there is extensive disease of the skull base. Tumor progression after radiotherapy was documented in four patients, three of whom were treated with 4500 cGy or more. One patient was found to have regional lymph node metastases. The six patients had a total of 10 head and neck paragangliomas, illustrating the high incidence of synchronous and metachronous lesions. Because of the high incidence of multiple lesions, these tumors threaten lower cranial nerves bilaterally in many instances. Because cranial nerve function is preserved until late, and because vagal and accessory nerve paralysis is usually unavoidable with resection, we advocate conservative treatment in selected cases. It may be reasonable to postpone surgery until cranial nerve impairment becomes evident or other vital structures are threatened. 
Changing pattern of pulmonary metastases with adjuvant chemotherapy in patients with osteosarcoma: results from the multiinstitutional osteosarcoma study. The multiinstitutional osteosarcoma study (MIOS), a randomized trial of adjuvant therapy for osteosarcoma with a concurrent control group, registered 113 patients from June 1982 to August 1984. Preliminary analysis of the study indicated a significant event-free survival advantage favoring immediate adjuvant chemotherapy, (P less than .001). For patients treated with surgery alone or with surgery and adjuvant chemotherapy, the lungs were involved in more than 80% of the relapses. Patients relapsing after surgery alone tended to relapse earlier (P less than .01), had more pulmonary nodules (P less than .01), and had more frequent bilateral pulmonary involvement (P less than .01) than those treated with immediate postsurgical adjuvant chemotherapy. However, patients relapsing after treatment with surgery alone experienced a significantly longer interval to further disease progression (P less than .01) and improved survival after relapse (P = .01) when compared with patients who relapsed after treatment with immediate adjuvant chemotherapy. The only factor predictive of survival after relapse was if the patient could be made surgically disease-free after initial relapse (P = .03). 
Surgical treatment of limbic epilepsy associated with extrahippocampal lesions: the problem of dual pathology. The authors present their review of 178 patients who underwent en bloc temporal lobectomies as surgical treatment for intractable epilepsy. Hippocampal cell density was quantitatively analyzed and the histology of the anterior temporal lobe was reviewed. Fifty-four patients (30.3%) had evidence of extrahippocampal lesions in addition to neuronal cell loss within the hippocampus (the dual pathology group). The pattern of cell loss was analyzed in the remaining 124 cases (69.7%) with no extrahippocampal pathology, and compared with that of the dual pathology group and a control group of four nonepileptic patients. Hippocampal cell loss was found in almost all epileptic patients compared to the control group. Severe cell loss greater than 30% of control values was found in 88.7% of patients without extrahippocampal lesions, but in only 51.8% of patients with dual pathology. The difference between these two groups was statistically significant (p less than 0.001). In the dual pathology group, lesions of different pathology had a significant relationship with the degree of hippocampal cell loss: all 12 patients with glioma had mild cell loss, whereas all 13 patients with heterotopia were associated with severe cell loss. Severity of hippocampal cell loss was also analyzed in relation to seizure history: a prior severe head injury was associated with severe cell loss. Other factors such as seizure duration, secondary generalization, or family history of seizures were not associated with hippocampal damage. Dual pathology may produce a combination of neocortical and temporolimbic epilepsies that warrants a precise definition of the true epileptogenic area prior to surgical treatment. 
Reduction of central nervous system ischemic injury in rabbits using leukocyte adhesion antibody treatment. Activated leukocytes appear to be directly involved in ischemic central nervous system injury. A surface glycoprotein (CD18) on the leukocyte is required for endothelial adherence and subsequent function and can be blocked with leukocyte adhesion antibody treatment. We used two animal models to determine the efficacy of anti-CD18 antibody treatment in preserving neurologic function after central nervous system ischemia. We gave a dose of 1 mg/kg anti-CD18 to treatment rabbits 30 minutes before inducing irreversible ischemia in the brain with intraarterial microspheres or in the spinal cord using reversible aortic occlusion. Treatment with anti-CD18 produced a significant reduction in neurologic deficits in the reversible spinal cord model, but not in the irreversible microsphere model. This protective effect supports the active role of leukocytes in central nervous system reperfusion ischemic injury and offers potential for future therapy. 
Radical hysterectomy morbidity in relation to age. The complications of radical hysterectomy in patients 65 years and older were compared with those in women younger than 65. There was no statistical difference in complication rates between the two groups, although the older women had a significantly higher incidence of preoperative medical problems. No surgical deaths occurred in either group. Our data indicate that selected older women can tolerate radical hysterectomy as well as younger ones. 
Impact of the Children's Epilepsy Program on parents. A randomized controlled trial was conducted in Santiago, Chile to test the efficacy of the Children's Epilepsy Program, a child-centered, family-focused intervention developed and pilot tested in Los Angeles, CA, U.S.A., using a counseling model for parents of children with seizure disorders to help them (a) deal with their anger, resentment, and grief related to the loss of a normal child; (b) increase their knowledge about caring for their child; (c) reduce anxieties related to having a child with a seizure disorder; and (d) improve their decision-making skills. All parents were pretested and then retested 5 months after the educational interventions. Parents in the experimental group (n = 185) and their children separately attended four 1 1/2-h sessions and then met together at the end of each session to share learning experiences. Comparison group parents (n = 180) and their children jointly attended three 2-h lecture sessions followed by question-and-answer periods. Although parents' overall knowledge of epilepsy was relatively high initially, it improved considerably in both comparison and experimental groups. With regard to anxiety, at the 5-month evaluation, experimental group parents and mothers in particular were more likely than control parents to state that they were less anxious (p less than 0.001), and their anxiety, as measured by the Taylor Manifest Anxiety scale, was significantly reduced (p less than 0.01). 
Cancer risk notification: psychosocial and ethical implications. Basic and medical science investigations have identified a growing number of risk factors important in carcinogenesis. By communicating cancer risk information in medical practice, we have the potential to motivate high-risk individuals to adhere to cancer prevention and surveillance protocols. However, cancer screening and risk notification might have adverse psychologic and social consequences as well. In this review, we address the psychosocial and ethical implications of cancer risk notification. The literature on the psychosocial impact of cancer screening programs and programs for notifying workers exposed to occupational carcinogens is reviewed critically. In addition, we examine new concerns and responsibilities raised by the emerging field of cancer genetics. Suggestions for future research and for patient education are addressed. 
Long-term results after lateral cranial base surgery. The surgical management of patients with slow-growing benign temporal bone neoplasms has been criticized because of its significant morbidity and mortality compared with results after radiation therapy, but long-term control by irradiation remains unproved. Long-term surgical results have not been studied previously. One hundred twenty-nine skull base operations were performed in 126 patients at the Otology Group, Nashville, Tenn., from January 1970 through May 1987. Fifty-eight patients responded to questionnaires focusing on recovery from loss of cranial nerves. All patients regained some degree of facial function (class V or better), no alimentary tubes or tracheotomies were in use, and no patients had debilitating aspiration. Long-term compensation from the cranial nerve deficits of lateral skull base surgery can be expected in most patients and should not be used as an argument for irradiation in patients with a long life expectancy at time of diagnosis. 
Are depressive symptoms nonspecific in patients with acute stroke? OBJECTIVE: Some investigators have suggested that major depression might be overdiagnosed in stroke patients because of changes in appetite, sleep, or sexual interest caused by their medical illness; others have suggested that depression may be underdiagnosed in stroke patients who deny symptoms of depression because of anosognosia, neglect, or aprosody. The authors' goal was to determine how frequently depressive symptoms occur in acute stroke patients with and without depressed mood to estimate how often diagnostic errors of inclusion or exclusion may be made. METHOD: They examined the rate of autonomic and psychological symptoms of depression in 205 patients who were consecutively hospitalized for acute stroke. Eighty-five (41%) of these patients had depressed mood, and 120 (59%) had no mood disturbance. Forty-six (54%) of the 85 patients with depressed mood (22% of all patients) were assigned the DSM-III diagnosis of major depression. RESULTS: The 120 patients without mood disturbance had a mean of one autonomic symptom, but the 85 patients with depressed mood had a mean of almost four. Tightening the diagnostic criteria to account for one more nonspecific autonomic symptom decreased the number of patients with major depression by only three; adding two more criteria decreased the number by only five. Thus, the rate of DSM-III major depression was 1% higher than the rate with one extra nonspecific autonomic symptom and 2% higher than the rate with two extra criteria. Conversely, loosening diagnostic criteria to account for denial of depressive illness increased the rate of major depression by only 5%. CONCLUSIONS: Both autonomic and psychological depressive symptoms are strongly associated with depressed mood in acute stroke patients. 
Randomized comparative study of hemaccel vs. albumin infusion after total paracentesis in cirrhotic patients with refractory ascites. Fifty-four cirrhotic patients with refractory ascites were treated with one-session large-volume paracentesis and randomly assigned to two groups. The first group was infused with human albumin, and the second group was infused with hemaccel at doses with comparable oncotic power. The two groups were compared for incidence of complications, recurrence of massive ascites after hospital dismissal and survival rate. The incidence of complications traditionally related to paracentesis, the probability of requiring readmission to the hospital for ascites (p = 0.48) and the probability of survival after entry into the study (p = 0.85) were the same for the two groups. A multivariate analysis of 16 parameters, including treatment modality, identified absolute unresponsiveness to diuretics as the only independent predictor of mortality. These results indicate that hemaccel infusion may safely replace albumin infusion after total paracentesis for cirrhotic patients with refractory ascites. 
A retrospective analysis of therapy for acute graft-versus-host disease: secondary treatment. We have reviewed results of secondary therapy in 427 patients with acute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) who did not have a durable satisfactory response after primary treatment. At the beginning of secondary treatment, 320 patients (75%) had rash, 252 (59%) had liver dysfunction, and 228 (53%) had gut dysfunction. Secondary treatment was with glucocorticoids (n = 249), cyclosporine (n = 80), antithymocyte globulin (n = 114), or monoclonal antibody (n = 19) either singly (n = 390) or in combination (n = 37). Parameters of GVHD severity were recorded weekly, and responses were determined according to values at the initiation of tertiary treatment or, for patients without such treatment, using values on day 29 of secondary treatment or the last recorded values before death, whichever occurred first. Minimal criteria for improvement or deterioration were defined for each organ, but no attempt was made to define liver or gut outcome if another complication such as venocclusive disease or infectious enteritis was present. Improvement or resolution of GVHD in the respective organ was seen in 45% of patients with skin disease, 25% of patients with evaluable liver disease, and in 35% of patients with evaluable gut disease. Overall complete or partial responses were seen in 40% of patients. The highest complete response rate with secondary therapy (23%) was seen when GVHD recurred during the taper phase of primary glucocorticoid treatment and was managed by increasing the dose of glucocorticoids. Multivariate analyses were performed to identify patient, disease, or treatment factors associated with likelihood of complete response or overall improvement. A similar analysis was performed to identify covariates associated with time to treatment failure (defined as initiation of tertiary therapy or death not due to relapse of malignancy). Severe dysfunction in the skin, liver, and gut at the beginning of treatment was associated both with a decreased likelihood of complete response and an increased treatment failure rate. The times to treatment failure and the proportions of patients in various response categories were similar for primary and secondary treatment, suggesting that the potential efficacy of new immunosuppressive agents for treatment of acute GVHD can be assessed meaningfully in patients who have not responded adequately to initial therapy. 
Gallbladder and pancreatic metastases from bilateral renal carcinoma presenting with hematobilia and anemia. A case of bilateral metachronous renal cell carcinoma with gallbladder and pancreatic metastases, presenting with hematobilia and anemia is presented. The presentation of metastatic renal cell carcinoma with hematobilia and anemia is previously unreported. This case illustrates (1) the occasionally very long interval between metachronous renal carcinoma; (2) this tumor's propensity to unusual metastases and unpredictable presentation; and (3) the significant palliation which may be achieved by appropriate surgical resection of these metastases. 
Prognostic factors in esophageal squamous carcinoma. A study of histologic features, blood group expression, and DNA ploidy. The authors studied 69 squamous carcinomas of the middle or lower esophagus to evaluate prognostic factors. Clinical and histologic parameters that were evaluated included weight loss, esophageal obstruction at presentation, site, gross configuration, degree of tumor differentiation, vascular invasion, the status of resection margins, and stage. Blood group antigen (BGA) expression in the tumors was determined immunohistochemically and compared with blood type and antigen reactivity in adjacent normal mucosa. A loss of BGA expression was seen in 27 tumors. This finding was correlated with high stage but was not significantly linked to survival. DNA ploidy was determined by flow cytometry of paraffin-embedded tissues. Forty-one of 52 tumors were aneuploid, and 14 had two or more separate aneuploid populations. However, survival was not correlated with ploidy status. The degree of differentiation and stage of the tumors were the only two independently significant prognostic indicators in this study. 
Coronary thrombosis in a patient with May-Hegglin anomaly. May-Hegglin anomaly (MHA) is a rare hereditary condition that is characterized by cytoplasmic inclusions in leukocytes and giant platelets. Many patients have some degree of thrombocytopenia. Most individuals with MHA are asymptomatic, but 25-43% of patients previously reported have had a hemorrhagic tendency. The authors describe a patient with MHA who had no history of hemorrhage but who developed complete coronary thrombosis after attempted angioplasty despite an apparent platelet count of 24,000 per mm3. Laboratory investigations revealed a normal bleeding time, normal platelet aggregation, and an increase in the size of approximately two-thirds of the platelets. The calculated platelet mass was near normal, which probably explains the thrombosis despite a decrease in platelet numbers. The authors conclude that in some patients with MHA platelets are functionally active both in vivo and in vitro. 
Negative regulation of the major histocompatibility complex class I promoter in embryonal carcinoma cells. Transcription of major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I genes is negatively regulated in undifferentiated F9 mouse embryonal carcinoma cells via the conserved upstream regulatory region. This region contains constitutive enhancers and an inducible enhancer, the interferon consensus sequence (ICS), that is responsible for interferon-induced transcription. A series of mutations in the ICS, but not in the enhancer elements, resulted in an increase in expression of the MHC class I promoter in F9 cells. However, these ICS mutants did not increase promoter activity in F9 cells differentiated after retinoic acid treatment. Results of mobility-shift DNA-binding assays and methylation interference experiments showed that undifferentiated F9 cells contained a factor(s) that bound to a sequence within the 5' and central part of the ICS. This binding site, termed the MHC negative regulatory element (NRE), coincided with the site of mutations that increased promoter activity in F9 cells and was distinct from the element to which interferon-response factors bind. The factor(s) that binds to the MHC NRE was not detected in differentiated F9 cells treated with retinoic acid or in other cells expressing MHC class I genes. Finally, introduction of concatenated, double-stranded NRE oligomers, but not oligomers of unrelated sequences, into F9 cells abolished negative regulation of the MHC class I promoter activity, providing evidence that the NRE binding factor is responsible for repression of the MHC class I genes in F9 cells. 
Treatment with quinidine gluconate of persons with severe Plasmodium falciparum infection: discontinuation of parenteral quinine from CDC Drug Service. CDC has recently reviewed data on the reported incidence in the United States of Plasmodium falciparum malaria and has evaluated available information on the effective management of severe life-threatening infections. As a result of this review, CDC has concluded that the therapeutic drug of choice in the United States for persons with complicated P. falciparum infection is parenteral quinidine gluconate, and that stocking of parenteral quinine dihydrochloride for emergency distribution is no longer required to provide optimal management of P. falciparum infections. 
Digital artery embolization as a result of fibromuscular dysplasia of the brachial artery. A 74-year-old woman was admitted to the hospital with sudden onset of a blue, painful right index finger, and the condition progressed to digital ulceration. The ulcer gradually healed over a period of 2 months. Peripheral pulses, Doppler-derived brachial and radial systolic pressures, and results of an echocardiogram were normal. Digital pulse volume recordings showed obstructive waveforms in all digits of the right hand. Arteriography showed a normal arch and normal innominate, subclavian, and axillary arteries. The midbrachial artery was markedly abnormal and had alternating areas of stenosis and aneurysm formation. Multiple occlusions involved the palmar arch and proper digital arteries. The abnormal brachial artery segment was excised and replaced with an autogenous reversed saphenous-vein conduit. Histologic examination confirmed the lesion to be medial fibromuscular dysplasia. Fibromuscular dysplasia that involves upper extremity arteries is extremely uncommon and rarely presents with digital artery embolization. This case emphasizes the importance of exclusion of proximal reconstructible arterial occlusive disease by means of complete arteriographic examination of patients who were admitted with unilateral finger or hand ischemia. 
A study of the status of clinical cancer research in the United States (1990). This study has confirmed a continuing decrease in the quality and quantity of young physicians entering academic careers in clinical oncology research, defined as cancer research requiring a clinician-patient interaction. Two major contributing factors were identified: the training programs and the research environment. The primary problems for the trainees were the financial insecurity of embarking on an academic career and the poor academic status of their role models in clinical cancer research. The problems regarding the environment of academic oncology and oncology research relate primarily to the strong and widespread perception that grant proposals for clinical oncology research are at a competitive disadvantage with proposals for cancer research in the laboratory. The study results yielded two basic recommendations. The first recommendation is to improve training for clinical cancer research and to implement unique funding mechanisms for trainees. Because physicians devote 3-10 years to clinical training, a minimum of 10 years of clinical research is needed for a clinician to compete effectively as a principal investigator in the R01 and P01 grant areas. The second recommendation is to develop peer review mechanisms that allow clinical research proposals to compete within a pool restricted to proposals in this category. The consensus in the study was that when programs in clinical research and laboratory research are in competition, the clinical proposals have a lower success rate. The problem appears to rest with the fact that the reviewers are frequently from disciplines other than clinical research and, more importantly, that clinical research proposals fare badly in competition against laboratory research proposals even when they are reviewed by appropriate peers. Implementation of this recommendation will require development of a clinical oncology research study section in the Division of Research Grants at the National Institutes of Health to review R01 grant proposals for innovative clinical cancer research, providing an academic environment that would enable the clinical investigator, through increased success in obtaining grants, to be a positive role model for the young physician/scientist. 
Incidental microvesicular steatosis due to valproic acid anticonvulsant therapy. Valproic acid has been implicated in at least 100 cases of fatal acute liver failure. Most cases have occurred in patients less than 10 yr old; however, at least seven have involved adults. Microvesicular steatosis has been uniformly observed, but its incidence in less severe liver disease and in asymptomatic patients receiving valproate is unknown. We report two patients receiving maintenance valproate, one with resolving acute hepatitis C and the other with chronic persistent hepatitis C, with incidental microvesicular steatosis demonstrated on oil-red O stains. We conclude that microvesicular steatosis does not necessarily signify hepatotoxicity in patients on chronic valproic acid, and should not lead to discontinuation of the drug until other causes of acute or chronic liver disease have been excluded. 
Autoimmune chronic active hepatitis in a family. A positive family history of autoimmune disease is common among patients with autoimmune chronic active hepatitis, but usually autoimmunity is directed at organs other than the liver. We document for the first time the multiple occurrence of autoimmune chronic active hepatitis in a family. Out of a sibship of seven, three sisters developed this, one sister developed coeliac and autoimmune thyroid disease, one sister showed serological signs of autoimmunity, while the two brothers were well with no signs of autoimmunity. HLA typing showed that in association with the female sex DR3 seems to be more important than B8 in conferring susceptibility to autoimmune chronic active hepatitis, at least in this family. 
Immunocytochemical evidence of lymphocytic derivation of neoplastic cells in malignant angioendotheliomatosis. Neoplastic angioendotheliomatosis is a rare disorder usually characterized by primarily cutaneous or neurological symptoms. Approximately 40 cases of malignant angioendotheliomatosis with primary central nervous system (CNS) symptoms have been reported. Some investigators have postulated a hematopoietic origin for this neoplasm. Most of the literature, however, has perpetuated the idea that the often bizarre symptoms seen with this entity result from neoplastic endothelial cell proliferation within the small vessels of affected organs, including the brain and spinal cord. This report describes the immunohistochemical examination and confirmation of the cell of origin of this neoplasm based on five previously unpublished cases of malignant angioendotheliomatosis with primarily CNS symptoms. It includes the first documentation of a T-cell lymphoma presenting as malignant angioendotheliomatosis. All cases include autopsy findings, and in four cases the diagnosis was made postmortem. One case was proven by stereotactic biopsy, but the patient succumbed as a result of severe intracranial bleeding that occurred at the time of biopsy. Tissues were studied with avidin-biotin peroxidase immunohistochemical techniques using a panel of monoclonal antibodies directed against the leukocyte common antigen, LN-1, LN-2, and anti-Factor VIII, and also using Ulex europaeus agglutinin 1. Based on the results obtained, the authors conclude that the proliferative cells seen within the vessel lumina are of lymphocytic origin and agree that the condition should more properly be designated intravascular lymphomatosis. The therapeutic implications of this conclusion point to the possible administration of chemotherapy and radiotherapy in an effort to achieve remissions in an otherwise relentlessly progressive neurological disorder. 
Reduction of high-grade slips (grades III-V) with VSP instrumentation. Report of a series of 41 cases. Records of 41 patients were reviewed for early complications resulting from reduction of high-grade spondylolisthesis. Blood loss averaged 1,427 ml. There were no cases of infection, dural tears, or bladder or bowel dysfunction. Two cases of transient foot drop and one case of permanent foot drop developed. A lumbar plexus stretch palsy occurred in one patient. Long-term results were evaluated in 20 patients followed up 2 or more years after surgery. Three of the 20 did not have interbody fusions and lost their reductions. All 20 patients went on to fuse with no pseudoarthrosis. One case of broken plate and two cases of broken screws occurred. Patient satisfaction ranged from good to excellent. Results suggest that reduction of high-grade slips with interbody fusion is a safe and effective procedure. 
Rabbit ear model of injury-induced arterial smooth muscle cell proliferation. Kinetics, reproducibility, and implications. Recently, considerable interest has focused on the vascular smooth muscle cell (SMC) response to injury, particularly as it relates to restenosis after angioplasty. In an effort to find an optimal experimental model of arterial SMC proliferation after injury, we examined the effects of external injury to the central artery of the rabbit ear and assessed the reproducibility, morphological changes, and time course of cellular proliferation after such an injury. With rabbits under general anesthesia, direct pressure was applied at two sites along the central artery of the ears of 19 New Zealand White rabbits. Rabbits were maintained on a diet of 2.4% fat and 0.001% cholesterol throughout the experiment. In seven rabbits examined after 21 days, marked SMC proliferation with neointimal formation was observed at all 28 sites (100%). Mean neointimal area, expressed as a percentage of the area of the tunica media, was 82 +/- 40% (range, 21-203%). Compared with the uninvolved artery displaced 2 mm from the injury site, mechanical crush caused a 38% increase in total vessel area (p less than 0.001), a 40% decrease in luminal area (p less than 0.002), and no change in the area of the media. Serial histological studies were performed 1-42 days after injury, using light and electron microscopy and bromodeoxyuridine immunohistochemistry. Beginning at day 3, activated medial SMCs were noted to migrate through defects in the internal elastic membrane, with a gradual increase in neointimal area between days 5 and 12. Peak DNA synthesis was identified in the media 5 days after injury, with proliferative activity shifting almost exclusively to the neointima thereafter. 
Effect of Iraqi missile war on incidence of acute myocardial infarction and sudden death in Israeli civilians. The Iraqi missile attack on Israel provided a unique opportunity to study the effects of fright due to a perceived threat of annihilation on the incidence of acute myocardial infarction (MI) and sudden death among the civilian population. During the first days of the Gulf war we noted a sharp rise in the incidence of acute MI and sudden death in our area compared with five control periods. Patient population in the various study periods did not differ significantly in age, sex ratio, hospital mortality, or proportion of patients in whom the acute event was the first presentation of coronary disease. However, during the first period of the war there were more cases of anterior wall MI and more patients received thrombolytic therapy than during control periods. Despite the continuing missile threat, the incidence of acute MI reverted to normal after the initial phase of the Gulf war. 
Glucagon and clonidine testing in the diagnosis of pheochromocytoma. We assessed the sensitivity and specificity of glucagon stimulation and clonidine suppression tests in the diagnosis of pheochromocytoma in 113 hypertensive patients, 39 with and 74 without the tumor. In the glucagon stimulation test, blood was sampled 2 minutes after intravenous injection of 0.28 mumol (1 mg) glucagon, and in the clonidine suppression test, blood was sampled 3 hours after administration of oral clonidine, 1.30 mumol (0.3 mg)/70 kg body wt. Baseline levels of catechols in antecubital venous blood were abnormal, with norepinephrine greater than 7.10 nmol/l (1,200 pg/m), epinephrine greater than 1.51 nmol/l (276 pg/ml), norepinephrine/dihydroxyphenylglycol (DHPG) ratio greater than 1.09, or dopa greater than 35.53 nmol/l (7,000 pg/ml), in 30 of 39 patients with pheochromocytoma (sensitivity 77%) and 1 of 74 patients without pheochromocytoma (specificity 99%). Results of the glucagon test were abnormal (norepinephrine greater than 11.83 nmol/l [2,000 pg/ml] or more than threefold increase from baseline) in 25 of 31 patients with pheochromocytoma (sensitivity 81%) and 0 of 72 patients without pheochromocytoma (specificity 100%). Results of the clonidine test were abnormal (after clonidine norepinephrine greater than 2.96 nmol/l [500 pg/ml] or less than 50% decrease from baseline) in 29 of 30 patients with pheochromocytoma (sensitivity 97%) and in 7 of 30 patients without pheochromocytoma (specificity 67%). Very high baseline levels of catechols therefore indicated the presence of pheochromocytoma, but there were several false-negative results when normal levels were obtained. The glucagon test alone was highly specific but not sensitive, and the clonidine test was highly sensitive but less specific. 
Modified skin incisions for mastectomy: the need for plastic surgical input in preoperative planning. Skin-sparing mastectomy by definition describes the procedure of mastectomy, either simple or modified radical, with a minimum amount of skin excision. The surgical skin excision must: (1) include the nipple-areola complex, (2) include the biopsy site, and (3) allow for access to the axilla for possible dissection. In 27 mastectomies, the senior author has had direct input in the preoperative skin planning. All patients underwent immediate breast reconstruction. In large-breasted women, the mastectomy was performed to a Wise-type pattern. In small-breasted women, the mastectomy involved minimal skin excision followed by reconstruction. Non-continuous incisions were frequently used in small-breasted women, thereby minimizing breast scarring. When appropriately applied, skin-sparing mastectomy can greatly improve the final aesthetic result of the breast. 
Renal, hormonal, and hemodynamic effects of low-dose infusion of atrial natriuretic factor in acute myocardial infarction. The effects of low-dose infusion of atrial natriuretic factor (ANF; 3 pmol/kg/min; i.e., 10 ng/kg/min) were investigated in a single-blind, random-order, placebo-controlled study of 12 patients with uncomplicated acute myocardial infarction (MI). Compared with the placebo, ANF induced an increase in urine volume (p less than 0.05), sodium excretion (p less than 0.05), and chloride excretion (p less than 0.05). Urinary potassium and creatinine clearance were unchanged. The maximal response of urinary sodium excretion rate after ANF infusion was positively correlated with the basal sodium excretion rate (r = 0.579; p less than 0.05) and inversely correlated with basal plasma renin activity (r = -0.623; p less than 0.05). Furthermore, the plasma aldosterone concentration (PAC) after infusion of ANF was significantly decreased compared with the basal level. The maximal change in PAC was closely correlated with the basal PAC (r = -0.857; p less than 0.01). However, no significant effect on hemodynamic variables was detected with infusion of ANF. Although additional studies are needed to assess the clinical efficacy of ANF infusion in acute MI, our observations suggest that low-dose infusion of the peptide is potentially valuable, as either sole or adjunctive therapy, for the management of water-sodium retention in acute MI. 
Controlled trial of Giardia lamblia: control strategies in day care centers. BACKGROUND: Strategies for control of Giardia lamblia in day care differ in numbers of children treated and in costs to parents and day care operators. The effectiveness of these strategies has not been systematically evaluated. METHODS: We conducted a prospective randomized controlled trial comparing three strategies for control of Giardia in infant-toddler day care centers: Group 1, exclusion and treatment of symptomatic and asymptomatic infected children; Group 2, exclusion and treatment of symptomatic infection only; Group 3, exclusion and treatment of symptomatic infection, treatment of asymptomatic infection in the center. The study included 31 day care centers with 4180 child-months of observation. Giardia prevalence was determined before intervention and 1, 2, 4, and 6 months later; new infants and toddlers were tested on admission. RESULTS: Initial Giardia prevalences were 18% to 22% in the three groups. Giardia was identified in 10.5% of 676 new infants and toddlers entering study day care centers during the 6-month follow-up. Giardia prevalences by intervention group were 8%, 12%, and 7% at 1 month, and 7%, 8%, and 8% at 6 months. CONCLUSIONS: The stricter intervention resulted in greater cost in terms of child day care and parents' work days lost, but did not result in significantly better control of Giardia infections in this day care environment. 
Clinical evaluation of stenosis of the carotid bifurcation with magnetic resonance angiographic techniques. We evaluated the images of 60 carotid artery bifurcations in 31 patients suspected to have carotid artery disease who underwent invasive carotid angiography and combined two-dimensional, phase-sensitive and a gradient-echo magnetic resonance angiography. The phase scans consisted of seven serial projections that were obtained at 20 degrees intervals (11.0 minutes) around the carotid bifurcation; the gradient-echo (GRASS) scans were composed of 11 axial images (2.4 minutes) acquired through the bifurcation. The two magnetic resonance angiographic techniques yielded complementary pieces of information and were used together to compare magnetic resonance angiography with invasive angiography. Comparison of magnetic resonance and invasive angiograms of the 60 carotid arteries shows that the sensitivity (86%) and specificity (92%) of the magnetic resonance angiographic techniques we used to diagnose clinically significant carotid stenosis approach but do not reach those of invasive angiography. 
Fine-needle aspiration in the diagnosis of head and neck growths: is it necessary? The results of fine-needle aspiration cytology performed on 150 patients at the Geneva Clinic of Otolaryngology were analyzed. The accuracy rate was 80%. The study was nondiagnostic in 10% of the cases and falsely negative in another 10%. These results are similar to those in other centers. Nevertheless, several recent reports attest to the accuracy of fine-needle aspirations cytology, and in some clinics it is now part of the initial workup of every patient with a growth in the head and neck. On the basis of our own retrospective analysis, we believe fine-needle aspiration is a useful study only in patients with a previously treated malignancy and who have a new lump in the neck suspected to be a recurrence. 
Ossifying fibroma of the mid-face and paranasal sinuses: diagnostic and therapeutic considerations. Ossifying fibroma is benign, usually slow-growing tumor that may behave in an unpredictably aggressive fashion. Most of these unusual tumors affect the mandible. Their behavior in the mid-face and paranasal sinuses is not well documented. In our review of the subject, and of the cases presented, it appears that these lesions behave more aggressively than their mandibular counterparts. A more aggressive approach may be more beneficial than expectant observation or curettage in the initial management of this neoplasm. 
Nonfunctional mutants of the retinoblastoma protein are characterized by defects in phosphorylation, viral oncoprotein association, and nuclear tethering. We have examined the functional consequences of mutations present in defective alleles of the retinoblastoma susceptibility gene (RB1) isolated from two spontaneously arising tumors. Unlike cDNA clones expressing the wild-type protein p110Rb, those encoding the two mutant proteins failed to induce the appearance of senescent cells in transfected Saos-2 human osteosarcoma cells. The mutant proteins were also defective in binding to the E1A oncoprotein, were unable to become hyperphosphorylated, and failed to become tightly associated with nuclear structures. We conclude that mutations in two distinct regions of the protein concomitantly affect these four aspects of p110Rb function. 
Effects of handrail support on claudication and hemodynamic responses to single-stage and progressive treadmill protocols in peripheral vascular occlusive disease. Because handrail support reduces the energy cost of treadmill walking, claudication and hemodynamic responses of patients with peripheral vascular occlusive disease should also be affected. Furthermore, the reliability of the test results may be reduced unless the same pressure is applied to the handrails over repeated tests. The effect of handrail support on claudication and hemodynamic responses, and on their reliability, were examined during single-stage (2 mph, 12% grade) and progressive (2 mph, 0% grade with 2% increase every 2 minutes) treadmill protocols. Ten patients with stable disease performed both protocols 3 times, separated by 1 week, with and without handrail support. Claudication pain distance and maximal walking distance were greater (p less than 0.05) when handrail support was permitted, and they increased (p less than 0.05) over repeated tests of each protocol. No increase was noted over the tests without support. The responses and reliability of foot transcutaneous oxygen tension, ankle systolic pressure and ankle/brachial systolic pressure index after exercise to maximal tolerable pain were not affected by handrail support. Because claudication distances were altered, it is concluded that handrail support should not be allowed when assessing claudicants, unless balance cannot otherwise be maintained. 
Hepatitis C virus antibodies in acute icteric and chronic non-A, non-B hepatitis. Hepatitis C virus antibodies were measured in 213 patients who had acute (n = 122) and chronic (n = 91) non-A, non-B hepatitis. In acute infection, anti-hepatitis C virus was detected in 61% of IV drug abusers, in 33% of patients with transfusion-associated hepatitis, and in 22% of patients with sporadic infections (P less than 0.0005, drug abusers vs. sporadic). Mean time to seroconversion was 11.6 weeks (range, 1-80 weeks). Anti-hepatitis C virus was more common in chronic infection (P less than 0.001) and was more often detected in IV drug users (89%; P less than 0.0001) and after transfusion (71%; P less than 0.005) compared with chronic sporadic infection (27%). Antibody persisted for up to 8 years. Six chronic case patients (8.3%) later lost antibody (mean, 24 months; range, 12-48 months). 
Obstructive sleep apnoea syndrome in morbidly obese patients. Twenty-seven morbidly obese patients (13 men and 14 women) with body mass index greater than or equal to 40 kg m-2 were examined. The mean age of the subjects was 36.9 +/- 8.2 years (range 23-51 years), and the mean BMI was 50.2 +/- 6.2 kg m-2 (range 40.0-62.9 kg m-2). A whole-night sleep recording was made for all patients with signs or symptoms indicative of possible obstructive sleep apnoea syndrome (OSAS). If the first nocturnal sleep recording was abnormal, it was controlled after 1 year. Eleven (10 men and one woman) of the 27 patients had an oxygen desaturation index (ODI) of 10 h-1. They were symptomatic with excessive daytime sleepiness or other daytime symptoms of OSAS. The occurrence of OSAS in men and women was 76.9 and 7.1%, respectively. Arterial hypertension was associated with OSAS, but not with smoking or the degree of obesity. Antihypertensive treatment was received by nine of the 27 patients; six of them had OSAS. Thus six of the 11 (54.5%) patients with OSAS and three of the 16 (18.8%) nonapnoeic patients were treated for arterial hypertension (Fisher exact test, P = 0.042). The odds ratio of OSAS for arterial hypertension is 5.2 (95% CI, 0.71-43.6). Vertical-banded gastroplasty was performed in 14 patients, three of whom had OSAS. The selection of patients for gastroplasty was made without taking into account the results of sleep recordings. In the three OSAS patients, a 30-38% reduction in BMI was achieved by surgery. Eight patients with OSAS were treated with an intensified dietary regimen, and the reduction in BMI ranged from -2.6 to 33%. OSAS was either cured or significantly improved in six (55%) patients, with a mean reduction in BMI of 27%, while in patients with persistent OSAS the mean reduction in BMI was only 7%. 
Nasopharyngeal carcinoma: modes of presentation. Nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) is a common malignancy among the southern Chinese people and has a poor prognosis. The aim of this study was to describe in detail the presentation of NPC as found between 1984 and 1988 at Prince of Wales Hospital, Hong Kong. Our study confirmed that patients present with an advanced stage of malignancy; 70% were stage III to V. Eighty-two percent of patients were between 21 and 60 years of age. The symptoms often suggested benign disease and most patients would delay seeking treatment for at least 5 months. We recommend inspection of the nasopharynx with flexible nasoendoscopy for all persons in high-risk areas on a regular basis and advise a policy of active health education for both physicians and the general population to reduce the stage of NPC at first presentation. 
Intraarterial cisplatin in the management of stage IIB osteosarcoma in the pediatric and adolescent age group. Sixty patients with extremity osteosarcoma were treated with intraarterial cisplatin. This was followed by surgical resection (amputation or limb salvage) and postoperative adjuvant chemotherapy utilizing two different protocols. Seventy-five percent of patients achieved an initial response. Overall disease-free survival was 58%. The number of patients treated with limb-salvage surgery gradually increased to the extent that 80% of newly-registered patients achieved a response and were subjected to limb salvage. Disease-free survival was 48% in amputation and 68% in limb salvage. The only factors found to have prognostic significance in determining disease-free survival were extent of tumor destruction induced by preoperative chemotherapy and tumor size. 
Incidence of ovarian cyst formation in women taking ethynodiol diacetate, 1 mg, with ethinyl estradiol, 35 micrograms. A total of 7,759 women were treated with ethynodiol diacetate, 1 mg, with ethinyl estradiol, 35 micrograms (EDA 1 mg with EE 35 micrograms) in a field study involving 983 obstetrician-gynecologists evaluating the incidence of ovarian cyst formation. Six thousand three hundred eighty-two patients were evaluable; 1,377 could not be evaluated because of failure to meet inclusion criteria or inconsistent or incomplete data collection. Cysts were detected in 80 patients at the time of the final visit. Follow-up questionnaires were received on 61% of patients and confirmed the presence of 12 newly formed ovarian cysts in patients taking EDA 1 mg with EE 35 micrograms. Only three women required an operation for ovarian cysts; two women had functional ovarian cysts (one follicular and one luteal), and one had a neoplastic cyst (cystadenoma). Thus, the incidence of ovarian cyst formation requiring surgical intervention was 0.05% in women taking EDA 1 mg with EE 35 micrograms. 
Early experience with mitral valve reconstruction for mitral insufficiency. Mitral valve repair for mitral regurgitation has been reported to have more favorable early and late results than mitral valve replacement. From July 1985 through July 1990, 63 patients have undergone valve repair at Good Samaritan Hospital. Twenty-two men and 41 women whose ages ranged from 34 to 81 years (mean 67.9 years) were treated. Twenty-eight patients were in New York Heart Association functional class III or IV. Twelve (19%) had undergone prior cardiac surgery. Isolated valve repair was performed in 18 patients. Valve repair was combined with coronary artery bypass grafting, other valve procedures, or aneurysm resection in the remainder (71%). Two patients (3%) died while in the hospital, and four deaths (one valve-related) occurred after discharge. Leaflet resection for ruptured chordae was done in 24 patients (38%), chordal shortening in 5 patients (8%), and leaflet transposition in 2 patients. Rigid ring annuloplasty (Carpentier) was performed in 62 patients. Eight patients required mitral valve replacement at the same operation because of unsatisfactory valve repair. Results of valve repair evaluated by echocardiography at discharge show that 48 patients (88%) are free of significant regurgitation. Follow-up to date reveals that all surviving patients who underwent valve repair have clinically improved and are stable. Four of five patients with moderate mitral regurgitation are currently asymptomatic. There have been two valve-related late failures requiring reoperation. Based on this early experience, we conclude that valve repair compared with mitral valve replacement has a low operative mortality with good early results. Continued efforts to preserve native mitral valve function in the presence of mitral regurgitation appear justified. 
CO2 laser-induced pain-related somatosensory evoked potentials in peripheral neuropathies: correlation between electrophysiological and histopathological findings. Pain-related somatosensory evoked potentials (pain SEPs) following CO2 laser stimulation as well as conventional electrically stimulated SEPs (electric SEPs) were examined in 10 patients with peripheral neuropathies in whom the histopathological examination of the sural nerve was done. Results of pain SEPs showed a positive relationship with clinical impairment of pain sensation and densities of small myelinated fibers of the sural nerve. In contrast, results of electric SEPs showed a positive relationship with clinical impairment of deep and tactile sensations and with densities of large myelinated fibers of the sural nerve. Therefore, pain SEPs are considered to be generated by ascending signals mediated through nociceptive receptors and A delta fibers. The pain SEP is only one noninvasive and objective method currently available to investigate a physiological condition of the sensory pathway responsible for pain sense, and is especially useful when combined with the conventional electric SEPs. 
Secretagogue response of azaserine-induced rat pancreatic acinar tumors in vivo. This study investigates digestive and lysosomal enzyme secretion of azaserine-induced pancreatic acinar carcinomas in response to cholecystokinin in rats. After 15-20 months of treatment, 95% of the animals developed pancreatic acinar carcinomas encompassing more than 90% of the tissue. In anesthetized rats basal trypsin output was significantly elevated in the tumor group despite diminished fluid secretion. There was a linear correlation between tumor size and basal amylase and trypsin secretion. Intravenous infusion of cholecystokinin (25 IDU.kg-1.h-1) induced a significantly lower secretion of fluid per gram pancreas, as well as decreased amylase and trypsin output, in the tumor group compared with the control group. Plasma amylase and lipase levels were significantly elevated in the tumor group under both basal and stimulated conditions. The output of the lysosomal enzymes beta-D-glucuronidase and alpha-D-glucosidase was significantly increased in the tumor group under background secretin infusion. Additional cholecystokinin infusion caused a sharp increase in glucuronidase output in this group with only minimal increase in controls. Glucosidase output increased similarly in both groups. Amylase, lipase, and trypsin tumor tissue concentrations were markedly reduced by 85%, 90%, and 87%, respectively. It was concluded that the decreased secretory response of digestive enzymes may result from decreased synthesis, lowered storage capabilities, and/or a decreased/increased responsiveness to cholecystokinin. Increased glucuronidase secretion may reflect an augmented cell turnover of malignant tissue. 
Pattern of simulated snoring is different through mouth and nose. Cineradiography of the pharynx during simulated snoring was done in 6 healthy volunteers, and supraglottic pressure and flow rate were recorded in 12 others. We observed, immediately before snoring, a decrease in the sagittal diameter of the oropharynx followed, during snoring, by high-frequency oscillations of soft palate and pharyngeal walls. The pattern of soft palate oscillations was different while snoring through the nose or mouth. During inspiratory snoring through the nose, the soft palate remained in close contact with the back of the tongue and only the uvula presented high-frequency oscillations. Snoring through the mouth resulted in ample high-frequency oscillations of the whole soft palate. Frequency of airflow and supraglottic pressure oscillations was less (P less than 0.05) during mouth (28.2 +/- 7.5 Hz) than during nasal snoring (77.8 +/- 36.7 Hz). This difference may be related to the smaller oscillating mass (i.e., uvula) during nasal snoring. At variance with our previous data, which showed that snoring during sleep, in both heavy (nonapneic) snorers and obstructive sleep apnea patients, was systematically preceded by flow limitation, this was not true during simulated snoring. 
Pharmacodynamic parameters and toxicity of netilmicin (6 milligrams/kilogram/day) given once daily or in three divided doses to cancer patients with urinary tract infection. The pharmacologic parameters and toxicity of netilmicin (6 mg/kg/day) given once daily (qd) or thrice daily (tid) for the treatment of urinary tract infections were studied in a randomized prospective study of 60 cancer patients. The overall efficacy was 96%. Nephrotoxicity, assessed by the measure of urinary excretion of phospholipids, was lower for the patients receiving the qd regimen than for those receiving the tid regimen. Elevation of serum creatinine (20% over baseline) occurred in one patient receiving the qd regimen and in three receiving the tid regimen. Cochleotoxicity, assessed by pure-tone audiometry (250 to 18,000 Hz) occurred in one patient receiving the qd regimen and none receiving the tid regimen. Concentrations in sera were measured on days 1 and 5. No significant accumulation was observed in either group. Median serum bactericidal titers, expressed as reciprocal values (percentage of the sera with a titer greater than or equal to 8), were measured against 25 test organisms in samples collected 6 h after the administration of netilmicin and were, for the qd group, 16 (82%) against members of the family Enterobacteriaceae and less than 2 (8%) against Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and for the tid group, 4 (57%) against members of the Enterobacteriaceae and less than 2 (0%) against P. aeruginosa. The rate of killing in serum was rapid (2 to 3 log in 2 h against P. aeruginosa; 3 to 5 log in 2 h against members of the Enterobacteriaceae) and correlated with the sampling time and hence the concentration in serum of netilmicin. The duration of the postantibiotic effect in serum depended also on the strain and the sampling time of the serum. 
Cu,Zn superoxide dismutase is a peroxisomal enzyme in human fibroblasts and hepatoma cells. The intracellular localization of Cu,Zn superoxide dismutase (superoxide:superoxide oxidoreductase, EC 1.15.1.1) has been examined by immunofluorescence using four monoclonal anti-Cu,Zn superoxide dismutase antibodies raised against a recombinant human Cu,Zn superoxide dismutase derivative produced and purified from Escherichia coli. Colocalization with catalase, a peroxisomal matrix enzyme, was used to demonstrate the peroxisomal localization of Cu,Zn superoxide dismutase in human fibroblasts and hepatoma cells. In the fibroblasts of Zellweger syndrome patients, the enzyme is not transported to the peroxisomal ghosts but, like catalase, remains in the cytoplasm. In addition, immunocryoelectron microscopy of yeast cells expressing human Cu,Zn superoxide dismutase showed that the enzyme is translocated to the peroxisomes. 
Factors affecting the measurement of cholesterol nucleation in human gallbladder and duodenal bile. The study of cholesterol gallstone disease would be facilitated if the nucleation time of cholesterol crystals could be measured in duodenal bile and was correlated with nucleation occurring in vivo. Therefore, our aims were to determine (a) if nucleation time could be measured in duodenal bile, (b) the effect of bacteria, phospholipase, protease, and dilution on the measurement of nucleation time, and (c) the ability of nucleation time of duodenal bile to reflect changes occurring in vivo that promote the formation of gallstones and, therefore, the potential usefulness of nucleation time in predicting and studying the formation of gallstones. Gallbladder bile was obtained from 27 patients undergoing elective cholecystectomy and 19 patients undergoing diagnostic duodenal biliary drainage. Among the 14 bile samples collected by drainage that nucleated within 21 days, mean nucleation time was 6.3 +/- 2.8 days. The addition of inhibitors of phospholipase or protease prolonged nucleation time slightly. Bacteria were cultured from one bile sample at the time of collection and five samples at the time of nucleation. The addition of antibiotics had no effect on nucleation time. Dilution of bile collected at cholecystectomy to the concentration of duodenal bile prolonged nucleation time. In 4 of 5 obese patients receiving a very low calorie diet and predisposed to gallstones, the nucleation time in duodenal bile shortened, and the shortest nucleation times were associated with the formation of cholesterol crystals in vivo. Thus, measurement of nucleation time in duodenal bile may be useful in predicting and studying the formation of cholesterol gallstones. 
Buschke-Ollendorff syndrome of the scalp: histologic and ultrastructural findings. Buschke-Ollendorff syndrome is an association of connective tissue nevi and osteopoikilosis that usually appears in the first decades of life. The nevi occur on the trunk and extremities. In a 48-year-old man with this rare syndrome the connective tissue nevus was located on the scalp and was pruritic. Histologically, involvement of the epidermis with cystic dilatation of the hair follicles and an abnormality of mucopolysaccharides were present. The nevi in this syndrome may involve an alteration in the three components of connective tissue to a variable degree. 
Vascular reactivity after balloon angioplasty in an atherosclerotic rabbit. Alterations in vessel wall reactivity (VR) at or adjacent to the dilation site after balloon angioplasty (BA) may vary according to the inflation protocol and the time after angioplasty and may influence outcome. In 64 atherosclerotic rabbit femoral arteries, we evaluated VR after BA with intravenous ergonovine (ERGO) (40 micrograms/min for 5 minutes) and intra-arterial nitroglycerin (NTG) (2,500 micrograms single bolus) 24-72 hours and 28 days after BA. Comparisons were made with atherosclerotic, nonangioplastied, age-matched controls. BA was standardized to three 1-minute inflations, each 1 minute apart. For each balloon size, 2.5- (appropriate size) or 3.0-mm (oversized) vessels were allocated to either 5 or 10 atm inflation pressure. For the analysis, four groups were compared: Group 1, 3.0/5; group 2, 3.0/10; group 3, 2.5/5, and group 4, 2.5 mm/10 atm. Angiographic diameters were measured at, proximal, and distal to the lesion at baseline, 10 minutes after ERGO, and 5 minutes after NTG. Angiograms were measured with electronic calipers by two blinded observers. All segments of control vessels vasoconstricted to ERGO and vasodilated to NTG (p less than 0.05 versus baseline), indicating a normal response. At 24-72 hours after dilatation, the angioplasty sites for all inflation pressure/balloon size combinations were not responsive to either ERGO or NTG. All segments distal to the dilatation sites vasoconstricted to ERGO and dilated to NTG (p less than 0.05 versus baseline), indicating a normal response. Proximal segments of vessels dilated with a 2.5-mm balloon (appropriate size) responded positively to both stimuli (p less than 0.05). Those vessels dilated with a large balloon (3.0 mm) were nonreactive in the segment proximal to the angioplasty site. Twenty-eight days later angioplasty sites dilated with a 2.5-mm balloon (appropriately sized) regained reactivity; however, segments dilated with a large balloon (3.0 mm) remained unresponsive. All proximal segments, including those from vessels dilated with a large balloon, reacted positively. All distal segments reacted appropriately. Restenosis rates were not different between the over- and appropriately sized balloon groups. These data demonstrate that immediately after angioplasty, vessels lose reactivity at the dilatation site. Those vessels dilated with the smaller-size balloon (2.5 mm) regained reactivity. For large balloons, reactivity is not regained at 28 days. For segments proximal to the site of dilatation, transient loss of reactivity is seen only when a large balloon is used. Thus, acute closure originating at the site of dilatation is not a result of spasm.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS). 
Flecainide acetate treatment of paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia and paroxysmal atrial fibrillation: dose-response studies. The Flecainide Supraventricular Tachycardia Study Group. The dose-response relations for efficacy and tolerance of the antiarrhythmic drug flecainide acetate were studied in 28 patients with paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia (Group 1) and 45 patients with paroxysmal atrial fibrillation or flutter (Group 2). Recurrent symptomatic tachycardia was documented with use of transtelephonic electrocardiographic recording. Patients received flecainide in doses of 25, 50, 100 and 150 mg twice daily and placebo for 1 month treatment periods. Among 14 patients in Group 1 who qualified for efficacy analysis, 4 (29%) had no tachycardia while taking placebo. The number with no tachycardia increased with progressively larger flecainide doses; with the 150 mg twice daily dose, 12 (86%) of 14 patients had no tachycardia (p less than 0.01 for overall differences among all treatments). Among 28 patients in Group 2, 2 (7%) had no tachycardia while taking placebo. The number with no tachycardia also increased with progressively larger flecainide doses; with the 150 mg twice daily dose, 17 (61%) of 28 patients had no tachycardia (p less than 0.01 for overall differences among all treatments). Noncardiac adverse experiences were the leading cause of premature study discontinuation during flecainide treatment periods (five patients in Group 1 and six patients in Group 2). 
Cell type-dependent effect of phospholipid and cholesterol on bile salt cytotoxicity. The effect of phosphatidylcholine and cholesterol on bile salt-induced cytotoxicity was investigated. Experiments were performed in both human erythrocytes and cultured CaCo-2 cells, a model system for gastrointestinal epithelium. Hemolysis induced by 50 mmol/L sodium-taurocholate was reduced by both lecithin and cholesterol in a concentration-dependent manner. Cholesterol was 10 times more effective than phosphatidylcholine. Addition of only small amounts of the sterol to phosphatidylcholine/taurocholate solutions eliminated all cytotoxicity. The protective influence of cholesterol is probably mediated through a direct effect on the membrane. Incubation of erythrocytes with a cholesterol/taurocholate mixture greatly increased the cholesterol content of the membrane. With respect to sensitivity to bile salts and the protective effect of lecithin, CaCo-2 cells behaved very similar to erythrocytes. However, cholesterol failed to have any cytoprotective effect when used in combination with taurocholate or phosphatidylcholine/taurocholate solutions. Interestingly, at relatively high concentrations of cholesterol (cholesterol saturation index greater than 1.0), the sterol even increased cytotoxicity. This correlated with a cholesterol-induced shift of phosphatidylcholine from micelles to vesicles, which normally occurs in supersaturated model and human bile. The different sensitivity of the two cell types to the effect of cholesterol on bile salt damage might be caused by the difference in lipid membrane composition. In conclusion, CaCo-2 cells represent a physiologically more relevant model system to study bile cytotoxicity than erythrocytes. When extrapolated to gallbladder epithelial cells, these results could be relevant for the pathogenesis of gallstone disease. The increased cytotoxicity might be the signal by means of which supersaturated bile induces mucin hypersecretion by gallbladder epithelial cells. 
Role of the sarcolemma in triggered propagated contractions in rat cardiac trabeculae. We have recently described that after contractions propagate through multicellular cardiac muscle preparations. These propagating contractions are triggered in damaged regions of rat right ventricular trabeculae during relaxation of electrically stimulated twitches. Propagation of triggered contractions has been attributed to calcium ions that diffuse along the preparation, causing calcium-induced calcium release from the sarcoplasmic reticulum in adjacent cells. In the present study we have investigated a possible role of the sarcolemma and delayed afterdepolarizations (DADs) in the initiation and propagation of triggered propagated contractions (TPCs) in multicellular preparations. We studied whether 1) TPCs are accompanied by delayed sarcolemmal depolarizations, 2) such depolarizations mediate local contraction, and 3) an intact sarcolemma is required for propagation of contractions. TPCs that remained stable for prolonged periods of time could be induced by trains of 15 stimuli (2 Hz, 15-second intervals) at lowered temperature (19-21 degrees C) of the superfusing Krebs-Henseleit medium and a [Ca(2+)]o of 1.0-1.5 mM. Although TPCs could be induced at 38 degrees C and a [Ca2+]o of 3.0-4.0 mM, they disappeared within 10 minutes. Force was measured with a silicon strain gauge; length and shortening of sarcomeres were measured at two sites of the muscle using laser diffraction techniques. Membrane potential was measured with flexible microelectrodes. Saponin was used to selectively render the sarcolemma permeable to small ions and molecules. Propagation velocity of TPCs in intact trabeculae varied from 1.7 to 13.4 mm/sec at 19-21 degrees C. TPCs were accompanied by DADs that could reach threshold and induce triggered arrhythmias. Changes in latency, duration, and force of TPCs, induced by changing [Ca(2+)]o or the number of conditioning stimuli, were closely matched by changes in latency, duration, and amplitude of DADs; DADs consistently preceded TPCs, on average by 60 msec. Local heating of the muscle, by applying a current through an insulated platinum wire (diameter 100 microns) that touched the muscle, interrupted propagation of TPCs reversibly. DADs were, in the absence of a local contraction, still recorded distal to the heated site. In muscles that were treated with saponin and exposed to solutions approximating the intracellular milieu, spontaneously occurring local contractions that propagated in both directions (at velocities of 70-200 microns/sec) were elicited at a bathing calcium concentration of approximately 0.6 microM. Below this threshold, propagated contractions could be triggered by pressure ejection of a calcium-containing solution from a microelectrode positioned close to the trabecula.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS). 
Scheduling of revaccination against hepatitis B virus Studies have shown that to maintain protection against infection after a primary course of hepatitis B immunisation, revaccination can be scheduled on the basis of an anti-hepatitis B virus surface antigen (anti-HBs) titre obtained 1 month after the booster dose. However, schemes which require post-booster testing may present practical difficulties. We applied a random-effects regression model to data from 118 Senegalese infants given three injections of hepatitis B vaccine about 6 weeks apart and a booster injection at 13 months, and show that revaccination can be scheduled on the basis of an anti-HBs titre recorded at the time of the booster dose. We also show that titre-at-booster is no less accurate in predicting future titre than 1-month post-booster titre. In several other studies the post-booster decline in anti-HBs conforms to the same mathematical description, indicating the generality of our findings. 
Effect of antireceptor antibodies in dilated cardiomyopathy on the cycling of cardiac beta receptors. A substantial proportion of patients with dilated cardiomyopathy have circulating autoantibodies directed against the cardiac beta-adrenoceptor. These antireceptor antibodies inhibit both ligand binding to membrane beta-receptors and isoproterenol-sensitive adenylate cyclase. The functional consequences of antibody-receptor interactions were further studied by examining their influence on beta-adrenoceptor cycling. Sera from eight patients with cardiomyopathy induced a loss of beta-receptors from the surface of cardiac myocytes consistent with internalization. This loss was inhibited by concanavalin A, suggesting that receptor sequestration preceded internalization but was unaffected by the cytoskeleton inhibitors colchicine and cytochalasin. In cell-free preparations, serum-induced desensitization of beta-receptors was prevented by heparin but not the inhibitor of protein kinase A; this is consistent with a requirement for receptor phosphorylation by the beta-receptor kinase. In contrast to isoproterenol-mediated endocytosis, beta-receptors internalized under the influence of cardiomyopathic sera do not recycle to the plasma membrane. These results indicate that antireceptor antibodies in human dilated cardiomyopathy induced downregulation by interfering at several steps in the cycling of beta-receptors. These effects would contribute to the reported decline in beta-receptor responsiveness in cardiomyopathic myocardium. 
Preliminary results in invasive bladder cancer with transurethral resection, neoadjuvant chemotherapy and combined pelvic irradiation plus cisplatin chemotherapy. Preliminary data are presented of a clinically feasible pilot study to select a significant subgroup of patients among those with muscle-invading bladder tumors for local cure and bladder preservation, while also to offer all patients the possibility of preventing the development of distant metastases. Transurethral debulking surgical resection was combined with neoadjuvant methotrexate, cisplatin and vinblastine chemotherapy plus 2 additional courses of cisplatin and 4,000 cGy. If tumor was found on cystoscopic re-evaluation by biopsy and for cytology after cisplatin and partial irradiation (4,000 cGy.) immediate cystectomy was advised. If tumor was not found consolidation by a radiotherapy boost to a total of 6,480 cGy. plus 1 additional course of cisplatin was given. Of 53 consecutive patients the planned treatment was completed in 42 (79%). With a median followup of 26 months (range 15 to 42 months), 72% of all entered patients were alive, 70% have not required cystectomy and 74% have not had distant metastases. Among the 42 patients who completed the planned protocol chemotherapy dose reductions were required in 39% for stomatitis, bone marrow depression and/or renal dysfunction. There were 2 serious complications but no treatment-related sepsis, deaths or significant renal dysfunction. Eight patients underwent immediate radical cystectomy because of positive biopsy and/or cytology results after 4,000 cGy., while 34 completed full chemotherapy and radiotherapy without any significant bladder or bowel injury. Of 42 patients 22 (52%) have maintained the bladder without any recurrence, and of those selected for full chemotherapy and radiotherapy this number increased to 65%. To date 12 patients have persistent or recurrent bladder tumors: 5 (15%) had invasive tumors treated by cystectomy and 7 (21%) had carcinoma in situ treated by intravesical therapy. The true success of this or other selective bladder-preserving treatments will require 3 to 5 years of followup to be confident that such treatment has sterilized the bladder of cancer. This feasibility study has been clinically practical, modestly well tolerated and encouraging for the significant proportion of patients with a sustained complete response and for the 70% over-all survival rate at 2 years. To evaluate critically the efficacy of methotrexate, cisplatin and vinblastine chemotherapy in the prevention of occult distant micrometastases and in increasing the rate of successful bladder preservation, in May 1988 we began a randomized phase 3 trial with and without neoadjuvant methotrexate, cisplatin and vinblastine chemotherapy. 
The effect of steroid therapy on recovery from tonsillectomy in children. A prospective, randomized, double-blind study to determine the postoperative effects of steroids in tonsillectomy was performed on 25 children from 4 to 12 years of age. A single intravenous dose of dexamethasone or a placebo was administered at onset of surgery. Other preoperative and postoperative medications, including antibiotics, anesthesia, and surgical techniques were standardized as noted in this article. The ability to return to a full or semifull diet occurred on the third and fourth postoperative days, significantly sooner in the steroid-treated patients than in the control patients. By the fifth and sixth days, the control group were eating as well as those children who received steroids. No significant differences were observed in postoperative pain, nausea, emesis, fever, or in the need for postoperative pain medications. This preliminary article concludes that a single preoperative dose of steroid results in an earlier return to a normal (full) diet in children who had undergone tonsillectomy. 
Radical prostatectomy for localized prostatic carcinoma in the renal transplant patient. Three renal transplant patients had prostatic carcinoma after transurethral prostatectomy at 2 weeks, 2 months and 12 years following transplantation. One patient had stage A1 disease, while 2 had stage A2 prostatic carcinoma. All patients underwent radical retropubic prostatectomy and pelvic lymph node dissection. All patients had residual cancer in the radical prostatectomy specimen but none had nodal or capsular involvement. The surgical technique and rationale for management are discussed. 
Angioedema: manifestations and management. Angioedema is characterized by localized swelling of sudden onset affecting the skin and/or mucous membranes. It can be classified into hereditary and acquired forms. Hereditary angioedema is a rare disease inherited as an autosomal dominant trait and caused by a deficiency of C1-esterase inhibitor. Acute attacks are life threatening and cannot be managed by antihistamines, corticosteroids, or adrenergic drugs. Prophylactic therapy is possible with danazol or stanozolol. Acquired angioedema includes nonhereditary C1-esterase inhibitor deficiency; idiopathic, allergic, and drug-induced forms; angioedema associated with lupus erythematosus and hypereosinophilia; and angioedema caused by physical stimuli. Treatment of these forms of angioedema depends on identifying and avoiding the cause, induction of tolerance, or symptomatic treatment with systemic antihistamines. 
Altered inotropic responses in diabetic cardiomyopathy and hypertensive-diabetic cardiomyopathy. To understand the mechanisms of diabetic cardiomyopathy and the consequences of combined hypertension and diabetes, cardiac tissue responses to various inotropic agents were measured in experimental diabetes. Streptozotocin was injected into Wistar rats, spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHRs) and Wistar-Kyoto rats (WKYs). Six weeks after the injection diabetic rats showed a subsensitivity to beta adrenergic stimulation in ventricular tissue and a supersensitivity and hyper-responsiveness to Ca++ and alpha adrenergic stimulation (except in WKYs) in ventricular tissues and left atria. A supersensitivity to BAY K 8644 in SHR left atria and a hyper-responsiveness to verapamil in ventricular strips were also noted. These alterations may be due to a change in receptor number or to postreceptor alterations. Diabetic SHRs exhibited greater changes in several of the drug responses (responses to isoproterenol, phenylephrine and BAK 8644) were more hyperlipidemic and had a high mortality as compared with Wistar rats and WKY diabetics. These findings confirm that the combination of hypertension and diabetes results in greater cardiac pathology than is seen with either disease alone. 
Isotopic study of the effects of platelets on development of intimal thickening in autologous vein grafts in dogs. The effects of platelets on the development of intimal thickening of arterially transplanted autologous vein grafts was investigated using canine poor run-off models. A new apparatus consisting of a shielding lead block to measure in vivo platelet adherence only on the intima of the vein graft was developed. In 23 dogs, 51Cr-labelled platelets (20 microCi/kg) were injected and isotope emission over the grafts was counted. Platelet adherence was expressed as the thrombocyte accumulation index (TAI), i.e. the ratio of counts over the graft under an abnormal flow condition in the poor run-off model to those over the graft under normal flow conditions of the contralateral leg. The TAI of the total graft (TTAI) was significantly high immediately and on the first and third days after implantation. The TAIs of the proximal (PTAI) and distal (DTAI) portions of the vein graft were also high at these same times. At 7, 10, 14 and 21 days, the TAI was almost equal to 1.0, a time at which endothelial regeneration was complete as confirmed by scanning electron microscopy. Thus, the prominent intimal thickening of arterially transplanted autologous vein grafts in dogs, induced under an abnormal flow condition, correlates well with the enhanced platelet adherence on the intima of the vein grafts in an early period after implantation. 
Intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma with sarcomatous transformation: an autopsy case. We report an adult case of intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma with remarkable sarcomatous changes. At autopsy a yellowish-white tumor (8 x 6 cm) was found in the left hepatic lobe, and there were several daughter nodules in both hepatic lobes. Histologically, most of the main tumor, and all of the daughter nodules examined, showed sarcomatous changes (spindle- or fusiform-shaped and pleomorphic cells). Histologic examination of a whole slice of the main tumor disclosed a focus of adenosquamous carcinoma (cholangiocarcinoma) within the tumor. Frequent transitions between adenosquamous carcinoma areas and sarcomatous areas suggested that sarcomatous transformation occurred in cholangiocarcinoma and then grew to spread rapidly. Immunohistochemically, squamous carcinoma and, to a lesser degree, adenocarcinoma elements were strongly positive for keratin and epithelial membrane antigen, both being also weakly positive in sarcomatous cells, supporting that possibility. Vimentin was positive only in sarcomatous elements. Cholangiocarcinoma should be included in the list of hepatic tumors showing sarcomatous change. 
Extracolonic manifestations of the familial adenomatous polyposis syndromes. The classic prototypes of the gastrointestinal polyposis syndromes are familial polyposis coli and Gardner syndrome. Extracolonic manifestations have been described in both diseases, and the distinction between them has become less clear. In fact, some authorities have suggested that familial polyposis coli and Gardner syndrome may represent a spectrum of the same disease. In both conditions, extracolonic expressions are the rule rather than the exception, and familiarity with them is essential for accurate diagnosis and correct patient management. In this pictorial essay, we discuss familial polyposis coli and Gardner syndrome together under the heading familial adenomatous polyposis syndromes. The colonic characteristics of these syndromes will be reviewed briefly, followed by examples of the most common extracolonic manifestations. 
Interleukin-2 toxicity. Because of the ability of interleukin-2 (IL-2) to support the proliferation and activation of numerous types of immunocompetent cells and to support the survival of adoptively transferred lymphocytes, there has been considerable interest in its use in the immunotherapy of malignancies. While studies to date have indicated that IL-2 has activity against some malignancies, considerable toxicity has also been observed. Careful prescreening and selection of patients and appropriate management of toxicity can minimize adverse outcomes. Studies of IL-2 effects have provided intriguing evidence of interactions of the immune/cytokine system with the neuroendocrine, cardiovascular, and other systems. Studies in animal models have demonstrated the central role of an intact immune system in mediating many toxicities of IL-2. Several adverse effects of IL-2 appear to be mediated by other cytokines whose production is induced by IL-2. Studies into the pathogenesis and manifestations of IL-2 toxicity have offered the hope of developing less toxic approaches to IL-2 therapy. Several lessons from the IL-2 experience are likely to be applicable in the clinical development of other cytokines. 
Cognitive neuropsychology. Resolving enigmas about Wernicke's aphasia and other higher cortical disorders. Cognitive neuropsychology is a young branch of neuroscience whose ancestral influences include a rich pool of experimental (eg, cognitive, psychology), theoretical (eg, epistemology), and clinical (eg, neurology, neuropsychology) disciplines. An essential principle of cognitive neuropsychology is that disorders of higher cortical functions can be understood in terms of breakdowns of one or more information-processing modules. Each module is the most basic element of intelligence that can be defined based on current knowledge. This approach is a refinement of-not a fundamental departure from-the 19th-century "localizationist" view of language disorders. Wernicke's aphasia, for example, classical attributed to a single cognitive deficit (loss of word sounds), is shown in this review to require damage to multiple distinct information-processing modules. Cognitive neuropsychology provides the tools for the type of fine-grained analyses of behavior that are needed to capitalize on recent advances in neuroimaging techniques, including the development of more sophisticated models of brain-behavior relationships. 
Reconstruction of the lower lip and chin with the composite radial forearm-palmaris longus free flap. Four cases of total lip and chin reconstruction are presented. In three, the composite radial forearm-palmaris longus free flap was used for reconstruction. In the fourth case, the palmaris longus was separated from the flap but still used as a lower lip sling. In all cases, the entire lower lip and the soft tissue of the chin were reconstructed in one stage. All patients healed primarily, and the three who underwent radiotherapy tolerated it without complications. Lip seal and speech were good, and there was no problem with drooling. Postoperative results emphasize the importance of respecting the aesthetic unit of the lower lip and chin. 
Comparison of an antiinflammatory dose of ibuprofen, an analgesic dose of ibuprofen, and acetaminophen in the treatment of patients with osteoarthritis of the knee BACKGROUND. The optimal short-term, symptomatic therapy for osteoarthritis of the knee has not been fully determined. Accordingly, we compared the efficacy of a nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drug, ibuprofen, given in either an antiinflammatory dose (high dose) or an analgesic dose (low dose), with that of acetaminophen, a pure analgesic. METHODS. In a randomized, double-blind trial, 184 patients with chronic knee pain due to osteoarthritis were given either 2400 or 1200 mg of ibuprofen per day or 4000 mg of acetaminophen per day. They were evaluated after a washout period of three to seven days before the beginning of the study, and again after four weeks of treatment. The major measures of outcome included scores on the pain and disability scales of the Stanford Health Assessment Questionnaire (range of possible scores, 0 to 3), scores on the visual-analogue scales for pain at rest and pain while walking, the time needed to walk 50 ft (15 m), and the physician's global assessment of the patient's arthritis. RESULTS. Seventy-eight percent of the patients completed four weeks of therapy. No significant differences were noted among the three treatment groups with respect to failure to complete the trial because of noncompliance or adverse events. All three groups had improvement in all major outcome variables, and the groups did not differ significantly in the magnitude of improvement in most variables. The mean improvement (change) in the scores on the pain scale of the Health Assessment Questionnaire was 0.33 with acetaminophen (95 percent confidence interval, 0.14 to 0.52), 0.30 with the low dose of ibuprofen (95 percent confidence interval, 0.09 to 0.51), and 0.35 with the high dose of ibuprofen (95 percent confidence interval, 0.13 to 0.57). Side effects were minor and similar in all three groups. CONCLUSIONS. In short-term, symptomatic treatment of osteoarthritis of the knee, the efficacy of acetaminophen was similar to that of ibuprofen, whether the latter was administered in an analgesic or an antiinflammatory dose. 
Lectin staining of neoplastic and normal background colorectal mucosa in nonpolyposis and polyposis patients. A lectin histochemistry approach was adopted for comparative assessment of a colon cancer risk. Binding of Ulex europaeus agglutinin-I (UEA-I), peanut agglutinin (PNA), Griffonia simplicifolia agglutinin-II (GSA-II), and Dolichos biflorus agglutinin (DBA) was investigated in tumor and background tissue from a total of 34 adenoma and 44 cancer patients and compared with reaction patterns in control and familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP) patients. Adenoma patients with UEA-I positive rectal mucosa were found to have a 33.3 percent familial history of large bowel cancer, which was significantly higher (P less than 0.05) than the respective 4.0 percent figure for patients with negative rectal mucosa. In the cancer patients, an even stronger correlation was noted, with a 63.2 percent UEA-I positive family history association being recorded, as opposed to 4.0 percent in the negative rectal mucosa patients (P less than 0.01). Thus, the results suggest that, apparently, normal rectal background mucosa of individuals genetically at high risk for colon and rectal cancer demonstrates a specific lectin binding ability similar to that of FAP patients and that the simple method using UEA-I staining of rectal biopsy specimens can be of practical use in identification of high-risk colorectal cancer. 
Osmotic diarrhea induced by sugar-free theophylline solution in critically ill patients. It is widely accepted that early enteral nutrition is beneficial to critically ill patients. Diarrhea is a common problem in this setting and is often erroneously ascribed to enteral feedings. More often medications cause the diarrhea. Multiple cases of severe diarrhea associated with the use of a sugar-free theophylline solution (SFTS) were discovered by a nutrition support team. SFTS may induce an osmotic diarrhea because it contains sorbitol. A 55-year-old man admitted for a dissecting aneurysm was started on isotonic formula enteral feedings and within a day of starting SFTS developed severe diarrhea. The sorbitol-induced osmotic diarrhea persisted for 36 of his 83 days of hospitalization with direct cost for the evaluation of this diarrhea being $4,250. His prolonged hospitalization cost $166,200. A retrospective review of 20 consecutive patients receiving SFTS revealed that 15 patients had diarrhea for 2 or more consecutive days compared with 20 patients receiving iv aminophylline, of whom only two patients had diarrhea. Furthermore, SFTS was administered to healthy volunteers and a prominent breath hydrogen response was noted. The polyalcohol sorbitol is used as a sweetner in "sugar-free" products and not quantified on labeling because it is considered an inactive ingredient. Nutritionists should be aware that medicinal solutions can contain enough sorbitol to create a laxative effect which is an easily reversible cause of diarrhea in enterally fed patients. 
Treating the progressive stages of Parkinson's disease. Parkinson's disease affects thousands of Americans, men and women equally and apparently with little regard to race. Its diagnosis depends largely on repeated clinical observations of representative signs, such as resting tremor, rigidity, bradykinesia, and gait disturbances. Patients progress through stages: Early disease involves only one limb or side and confers minimal disability, but advanced disease restricts patients to full care. Treatment is chosen on the basis of disease stage and patient response. Combination carbidopa-levodopa (Sinemet) is appropriate for any significant degree of disability, and other antiparkinsonian drugs and anticholinergic agents may be used as adjuncts. Electroconvulsive therapy, use of selegiline hydrochloride (Eldepryl), and surgery are still undergoing investigation but may hold promise. 
Travel medicine and travel clinics. In response to the vast number of American travelers to the developing world, the discipline of Travel Medicine has become an emerging specialty. There are presently no formal Board or other requirements to practice Travel Medicine, but bona fide practitioners of this field, who also usually direct travel clinics, should at the least be well-trained and experienced in tropical medicine and medical aspects of travel, and have had considerable overseas work experience. The concept of travel medicine and the need for travel clinics operated by well-qualified physicians are discussed. The areas of involvement of travel clinics in protecting the health of the traveler are described. 
Quantification of cell kinetic characteristics using flow cytometric measurements of deoxyribonucleic acid and bromodeoxyuridine for bladder cancer. A total of 56 human bladder tumors that were histologically proved to be transitional cell carcinoma was analyzed by simultaneous flow cytometric 2-color measurements of deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) and bromodeoxyuridine. Bromodeoxyuridine in vitro labeling was performed by sample incubation with bromodeoxyuridine under high atmospheric pressure oxygen. Grade 1 tumors showed 33.3% aneuploidy with a mean bromodeoxyuridine positive stained ratio (labeling index) of 5.1 +/- 3.4%. Grade 2 tumors featured 51.7% aneuploidy with a mean labeling index of 8.9 +/- 7.7%. On the other hand, a markedly increased labeling index of 15.2 +/- 8.2% with aneuploidy was observed in all but 1 grade 3 tumors. When DNA ploidy and labeling indexes were compared according to the presence or absence of muscular invasion of tumors, all 16 muscle invasive tumors showed aneuploidy (mean labeling index 18.7 +/- 8.0%), while 17 of 40 nonmuscle invasive tumors showed aneuploidy (mean labeling index 8.6 +/- 5.4%). This labeling index difference was statistically significant (p less than 0.01). These results indicate that bromodeoxyuridine/DNA 2-color flow cytometry may provide an objective parameter for quantification of the malignant potential of bladder cancers. 
Body surface isopotential mapping of the entire QRST complex in the Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome. Correlation with the location of the accessory pathway. Body surface potential maps were recorded during sinus rhythm and during atrial pacing at the time of electrophysiologic studies in 42 patients with Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome. The locations of the accessory pathways were determined by epicardial mapping during surgery in 34 patients and by multicatheter endocavitary electrophysiologic studies in eight additional patients. During delta wave inscription, the shape and extension of areas of the negative and positive potentials on the thorax correlated better with the preexcitation site (69% of patients) than with the localization of the minimum potential alone (45.2% of patients). Typical potential distributions were present from the beginning of the delta wave and remained stationary during the first half of the QRS complex. During marked preexcitation, the superposition of atrial activity on the delta wave produced a mixed pattern in the earliest maps. However, these alterations of early delta thoracic potential distribution did not persist longer than 30 msec. The spread of the negative potentials during the last half of the QRS complex also characterized each localization: right-sided preexcitation reproduced the depolarization sequence of left bundle branch block, left-sided preexcitation reproduced that of right bundle branch block, and posterior pathways resembled left anterior fascicular block. Anterior left ventricular and more anterior left lateral ventricular preexcitations mimicked a right bundle branch block-left posterior fascicular block pattern. There was good correlation between the body surface potential map obtained during the ST segment and the site of the right-sided preexcitation. However, in left-sided preexcitations, ST patterns concordant with delta wave patterns were found less frequently than in right-sided preexcitations. 
Subcapsular hepatic necrosis in liver transplantation: CT appearance. Eleven cases of subcapsular hepatic necrosis were found in 47 hepatic transplantation patients who underwent CT examination between the second and 14th postoperative day. CT examinations of all 11 cases showed nonenhancing hypodense subcapsular areas with irregular contours in the liver. Major vessels were free of obstruction. Anatomic correlation, possible in one case, confirmed the diagnosis. Size disproportion between the graft and the recipient abdominal cavity reduced hepatic blood flow and caused abnormal pressure points. One or both of these factors could result in ischemia in subcapsular areas and explain the subcapsular necrosis. Although it has good prognosis without treatment, subcapsular hepatic necrosis is important to recognize to avoid confusion with liver necrosis after vascular thrombosis. 
Ultrasonography in the diagnosis of gynecologic disorders. Ultrasonographic examination is being used with progressively greater frequency as an aid in diagnosis of gynecologic disorders but too often without consideration of whether information other than that obtained from clinical examination is needed and whether ultrasonography can supply it. The size, number, and position of pelvic masses and, in some instances, the type of tumor can be identified, but it is not often necessary when operation is clearly indicated. Ultrasonographic screening for diseases of the reproductive organs has been proposed, but its use for this purpose is limited and it is not cost-effective. It should be used as an adjunct to clinical diagnosis, not as a primary diagnostic procedure. 
Use of hearing aids by patients with closed mastoid cavity. Twenty-five patients who had undergone a closed-cavity tympanomastoidectomy in our Unit and wore a hearing aid in the operated ear were reviewed, and information was recorded on the use of the aid, and the patients' impression about it. The information obtained was analysed and compared with similar data from 39 hearing aid users of similar age with no history of ear surgery. Eighty per cent of the patients with a closed mastoid cavity were satisfied with the aid, and no significant difference was found between the two groups regarding the impression about the aid (chi square 3.06, p = 0.08), or the problems with it, which, in most of the cases, were related to several changes of mould (chi square 2.19, p = 0.13). The various recorded parameters are discussed, and it is concluded that the patients with a closed mastoid cavity can tolerate a hearing aid in the operated ear at least as well as the control subjects with no ear surgery. 
Physician recommendations for screening mammography: results of a survey using clinical vignettes BACKGROUND. Although experts estimate that 30% of breast cancer deaths could be prevented if women were screened according to published guidelines, fewer than 50% of physicians follow screening mammography guidelines, and fewer than 30% of women are screened with mammography. METHODS. Physician recommendations for screening mammography were examined in a questionnaire mailed to 300 randomly selected physicians of the Ohio Academy of Family Physicians. Physicians responded with their likelihood of recommending screening mammography to 24 clinical vignettes that high-lighted patient, mammographic, and encounter characteristics. RESULTS. Seventy-one percent responded. Ninety-one percent reported almost always recommending screening mammography to a 55-year-old woman at her yearly examination. They were significantly less likely to recommend mammography to women who were young (40 years old), were old (70 years old), were poor, had small breasts, had painful mammograms, did not want the doctor to look for cancer, lived in a nursing home, or were retarded. Physicians recommended mammography less often when the mammography unit was far away or produced poor quality films or ambiguous interpretations. When physicians ran behind schedule, perceived a more urgent medical problem during the encounter, or saw a woman for an acute visit, they recommended mammography significantly less often. CONCLUSIONS. Patient, mammographic, and encounter characteristics significantly limit physician recommendations for screening mammography as assessed by clinical vignettes. These characteristics must be addressed if breast cancer mortality is to be reduced with early screening. 
Regulation of human fetal and adult globin genes in mouse erythroleukemia cells. We have examined whether transfected mouse erythroleukaemia (MEL) cells can be used to examine differential expression of human gamma- and beta-globin genes. These cells, which express only their adult globin genes, will transcribe the human adult beta gene but not the fetal gamma genes when they are introduced on an intact human chromosome 11 by cell fusion. However, MEL cells stably transfected with the human A gamma gene attached to one of the active elements (HS2) of the beta-globin locus control region (LCR) readily produce gamma-globin mRNA in amounts equivalent to those seen with a comparable beta gene insert. When both beta and gamma genes are attached to HS2, equal amounts of beta A gamma mRNAs are produced, irrespective of the gene order. Furthermore, when HS2 is inserted into the 5' end of a 40-kb cosmid containing the G gamma A gamma-117 delta beta genes in their normal chromosomal organization (but with the Greek HPFH -117 A gamma gene mutation), it directs expression of readily detectable amounts of G gamma A gamma and beta-globin mRNAs in MEL cells. Therefore, under these circumstances we have observed no competition between beta and gamma genes for expression in MEL cells. These findings suggest that MEL cells are capable of perpetuating regulatory information involved in developmental control when it is provided by an intact chromosome, but are incapable of reconstructing such information on transfected DNA. 
The biomechanical effects of deep tissue support as related to brow and facelift procedures. The adverse effects of increased tension across a healing wound are well known. However, the effect of closing a wound in layers in order to decrease tension on the epidermis has been a source of controversy. It is hypothesized that deep tissue support decreases skin tension upon wound closure. In order to clarify this issue, a two-part study was designed to address the immediate effects of deep tissue support in vitro using fresh-frozen cadavers and in vivo on patients undergoing scheduled surgery. Closing skin tension was measured at standard reference points in coronal brow lift and rhytidectomy procedures performed with and without galeal closure and superficial musculoaponeurotic system (SMAS) procedures, respectively. Deep tissue support was found to significantly (p less than 0.05) decrease skin tension at the time of skin closure at standard reference points in coronal brow lift and rhytidectomy procedures performed on fresh-frozen cadavers. Similar significant (p less than 0.05) decreases in closing skin tension also were found in vivo in patients undergoing similar surgical procedures. Stress relaxation was not found to play a significant role in contributing to this immediate decrease in closing skin tension. It would appear, therefore, that deep tissue support, in the form of galeal closure and an SMAS procedure in coronal brow lift and rhytidectomy procedures, respectively, provides increased viscoelastic support, producing immediate significant decreases in closing skin tension in these procedures. The beneficial effects on wound healing, scar formation, tension-related trophic skin changes, and possible improved long-term results are discussed. 
Treatment of neuroendocrine carcinomas with combined etoposide and cisplatin. Evidence of major therapeutic activity in the anaplastic variants of these neoplasms. Forty-five patients with metastatic neuroendocrine tumors were treated with a regimen of etoposide 130 mg/m2/d for 3 days plus cisplatin 45 mg/m2/d on days 2 and 3. Both drugs were given by continuous intravenous infusion. Among 27 patients with well-differentiated carcinoid tumors or islet cell carcinomas, only two partial objective tumor regressions were observed (7%). Among 18 patients prospectively classified as having anaplastic neuroendocrine carcinomas, however, there were nine partial regressions and three complete regressions, an overall regression rate of 67%. For anaplastic disease, the median duration of regression was 8 months (range to 21 months). Tumor response was unrelated to primary site, endocrine hyperfunction, or prior therapy experience. The median survival of all patients with anaplastic tumors was 19 months; this seemed favorable when considering the small experiences with these rare tumors reported in the literature. Toxicity, which was severe for most patients, consisted primarily of vomiting, leukopenia, thrombocytopenia, anemia, alopecia, and neuropathy. The anaplastic neuroendocrine tumor is strongly responsive to therapy with combined etoposide and cisplatin. Patients with undifferentiated carcinomas, originating in typical neuroendocrine tumor sites (small and large bowel, pancreas, and stomach) or of unknown origin, who have consistent histologic findings by light microscopy should be evaluated for this possibility with appropriate immune staining or electron microscopy. 
MR anatomy and pathology of the hypothalamus. The hypothalamus, the ventral-most portion of the diencephalon, surrounds the anterior inferior portion of the third ventricle (Fig. 1). It functions primarily as an integrative mechanism for various autonomic and neuroendocrine activities including temperature regulation, water balance, behavior, and appetite. This pictorial essay illustrates the value of MR in depicting the normal anatomy and abnormalities of the hypothalamic region. 
Effect of isradipine on 24-h blood pressure profile demonstrated by repeated monitoring. The antihypertensive effect of isradipine was assessed by repeated 24-h ambulatory blood pressure monitoring. Using an SPS device (Sandoz Pharma, Basel, Switzerland), monitoring was carried out in 10 male patients with mild essential hypertension (1) after a placebo period, (2) after six months, and (3) after 12 to 13 months of treatment with isradipine (average dose 2.5 mg twice daily). Mean 24-h blood pressure decreased significantly after both periods 2 and 3 (from 148/93 mm Hg to 137/87 and 130/85 mm Hg, respectively). The total number of hypertensive systolic and diastolic blood pressure values also decreased. The normal circadian blood pressure curve was preserved, showing the reduction throughout the 24-h period, and the early morning rise in blood pressure was markedly blunted. These results indicate that isradipine has a favorable effect on the 24-h blood pressure profile that persisted throughout six and 12 months of antihypertensive therapy. 
Cause of death in patients attending multiple sclerosis clinics. Between 1972 and 1988, 145 deaths occurred among 3,126 patients attending the Multiple Sclerosis (MS) Clinics in Vancouver, British Columbia (N = 1,583), and London, Ontario (N = 1,543). We could determine the exact cause of death in 82.1% of cases (119 of 145). Of the 119 patients for whom the cause of death was known, 56 deaths (47.1%) were directly attributed to complications of MS. Of the remaining 63 deaths, 18 (28.6%) were suicides, 19 (30.2%) were due to malignancy, 13 (20.6%) to an acute myocardial infarction, seven (11.1%) to stroke, and the remainder (9.5%) to miscellaneous causes, of which two may have been suicides. The proportion of suicides among MS deaths was 7.5 times that for the age-matched general population, and the proportion of MS deaths from malignancy was 0.67 times that for the age-matched general population. The proportion of deaths due to malignancy and stroke was the same for the MS patients and the age-matched general population. 
Extubation after transsternal thymectomy for myasthenia gravis: a prospective analysis. Recommendations concerning postoperative extubation after thymectomy for myasthenia gravis are presently based upon retrospective chart reviews. We present the results of a prospective investigation of time to extubation after thymectomy for 14 patients over a 12-month period based upon a protocol that included preoperative immunologic therapy, combined epidural and general anesthesia, postoperative epidural narcotic analgesia, and a standardized approach to discontinuation of ventilatory support. After a neurologist took measures to optimize preoperative neuromuscular function, all 14 patients received agents to produce lumbar epidural anesthesia and light general anesthesia. Muscle relaxants were avoided in all but one patient. Postoperative analgesia was initially maintained with epidural hydromorphone, then therapy was switched to patient-controlled intravenous morphine sulfate. Criteria for weaning from mechanical ventilation, first measured at the end of anesthesia, were partial pressure of oxygen (arterial) greater than or equal to 90 mm Hg (fraction of inspired oxygen = 0.40), partial pressure of carbon dioxide (arterial) less than or equal to 50 mm Hg, pH greater than or equal to 7.30, and respiratory rate less than or equal to 30 breaths/min. If these criteria were not met, ventilatory support was continued postoperatively with intermittent mandatory ventilation, and the patient was weaned gradually from this support. Criteria for extubation included meeting the criteria for weaning, vital capacity greater than or equal to 10 mL/kg, and inspiratory pressure better than -30 cm H2O. Criteria for reintubation included tachypnea (respiratory rate greater than 40 breaths/min), respiratory acidosis not due to narcotics, or vital capacity less than or equal to 8 mL/kg. The mean time to extubation was 9 hours (range, 0.75 to 25 hours). Mean preoperative vital capacity was 2.59 +/- 0.64 L (range, 1.90 to 4.20), which decreased approximately 50% to 1.19 +/- 0.39 L (range, 0.70 to 2.0) at the time of extubation. No patient required reintubation. Half of the patients required postoperative anticholinesterase therapy based upon serial neurologic examinations; there were no instances of cholinergic crisis. Thirteen patients returned to the ward on the first postoperative day, and one on the second day. Thirteen patients preferred epidural analgesia to patient-controlled analgesia. The time to extubation and average length of stay in an intensive care setting were markedly reduced compared to those reported in previous retrospective studies. We conclude that a multidisciplinary approach that optimizes neuromuscular function and decreases poststernotomy pulmonary insult will shorten the time to extubation and decrease the length of stay in the intensive care or recovery room after thymectomy. 
Massive hepatic enlargement with fatty change associated with ketoconazole Several forms of hepatic toxicity have been described with the antifungal agent ketoconazole. We report a case of massive liver enlargement with fatty infiltration presenting as gastric compression. This occurred in a young woman with AIDS taking ketoconazole as maintenance therapy for cryptococcal meningitis. This is the first reported case of ketoconazole causing fatty change in the liver. 
Thalamic atrophy following cerebral infarction in the territory of the middle cerebral artery. We investigated shrinkage of the ipsilateral thalamus following infarction in the territory of the middle cerebral artery in 33 patients who were admitted less than or equal to 2 days after the stroke and who were followed by computed tomography for greater than 1 year with no recurrences. The thalamic area was measured on the computed tomograms, and the ratio of the ipsilateral area to the contralateral area was calculated. All values were compared with values from the initial computed tomogram taken less than or equal to 2 days after the stroke. The values of the ratio on follow-up computed tomograms decreased gradually in 15 patients. In these cases, the area of the ipsilateral thalamus was significantly reduced after 1 year (p less than 0.01) and marked atrophy was observed. These results demonstrate the significance of remote changes over a long period of time after focal cerebral infarction. 
Chronic persistent cough and gastro-oesophageal reflux. Chronic cough persisting for two months or more that remains unexplained after extensive investigations is a common clinical problem. The purpose of this study was to determine whether such cough is associated with otherwise asymptomatic gastro-oesophageal reflux. Thirteen patients with chronic persistent cough that was unexplained after a standard diagnostic assessment were identified. All were non-smokers. The mean (SE) duration of cough was 17.8 (8.0) months. Ten had never had reflux symptoms and three had had mild symptoms only after the onset of the cough. All the patients completed standardised cough diary cards for eight weeks and underwent 24 hour ambulatory oesophageal pH monitoring. A reflux episode was defined as a fall in oesophageal pH to below 4.0. Nine control subjects were matched for age, lung function, and body mass index. The patients experienced significantly more episodes of reflux per 24 hours than the controls (115.8 (SE 31.7) versus 4.7 (1.4) and longer reflux episodes (15.5 (5.8) versus 1.7 (0.5) minutes), and the oesophageal pH was below 4.0 considerably longer (84.5 (20.2) versus 3.8 (1.3) minutes). Cough occurred simultaneously with 13% (2.2%) of reflux episodes and within five minutes in another 35% (5.8%) of episodes, whereas gastro-oesophageal reflux occurred simultaneously with 78% (5.5%) of cough episodes and within five minutes in another 12% (2.3%) of episodes. It is concluded that chronic persistent cough that remains unexplained after a standard diagnostic assessment is associated with otherwise asymptomatic gastro-oesophageal reflux. It is suggested that a self perpetuating mechanism may exist whereby acid reflux causes cough via a local neuronal oesophageal-tracheo-bronchial reflex, and the cough in turn amplifies reflux via increased transdiaphragmatic pressure or by inducing transient lower oesophageal sphincter relaxation. Further study of this mechanism and the role of specific antireflux treatment in chronic persistent cough is warranted. 
Extradural haematoma after continuous extradural anaesthesia. We report a case of extradural haematoma occurring after extradural anaesthesia in an anticoagulated patient. The diagnosis was confirmed by magnetic resonance imaging and the haematoma was evacuated surgically. A search of the literature revealed only five previous reports of extradural haematoma in association with extradural anaesthesia. 
Aseptic meningitis following cardiac transplantation: clinical characteristics and relationship to immunosuppressive regimen. Neurologic disorders are uncommon but alarming complications of cardiac transplantation. Of 29 patients from the Utah Cardiac Transplant Program (UCTP) who had lumbar puncture because of change in neurologic function, or to assess fever of uncertain etiology, CSF pleocytosis was present in 14 patients, 4 of whom had an active infectious process involving the nervous system. In 10 other patients, CSF pleocytosis with negative cultures appeared following treatment with OKT3 monoclonal antibody. The most prominent clinical signs of this aseptic meningitis syndrome are fever and transient cognitive dysfunction. 
GnRH analogue-induced uterine shrinkage enabling a vaginal hysterectomy and repair in large leiomyomatous uteri. Gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) analogue was used to reduce large leiomyomas in three young women who were scheduled to have an abdominal hysterectomy and vaginal plastic repair. Significant size decrease due to the hormonal treatment enabled safe vaginal hysterectomy and repair. 
Clinical study of infertile males with varicocele showing no typical radionuclide blood pooling on dynamic image of scrotal scintigraphy. A clinical study was done of 19 patients in our male infertility clinic, who were diagnosed as having a varicocele and showed atypical radionuclide accumulation in the dynamic image of scrotal scintigraphy. The semen quality was good in 26 percent and poor in 42 percent. Patients with severe congestion in the varicocele tended to be small in number. The dynamic images of the varicoceles were classified into two groups: one group with no radionuclide accumulation, and one group with patchy radionuclide accumulations. Surgical treatment was performed in patients with poor semen quality or with a long infertility period. Neither improvement in the semen quality nor impregnation was achieved postoperatively in patients who had shown no accumulation of the radionuclide in the dynamic imaging. In patients who had shown patchy radionuclide accumulations, the postoperative results were good. We concluded that preoperative dynamic imaging of scrotal scintigraphy is a good means of estimating the postoperative prognosis of fertility. 
Central venous air embolism without a catheter. Venous air embolism is a well-recognized complication of central venous catheterization. Although previous reports have documented venous air embolism occurring in a number of ways, including during initial catheterization, when catheters crack or are disconnected, and after catheter removal, no reports mention the possibility of air embolism occurring when a guide wire without a catheter was in place. A patient is presented who displayed signs and symptoms of venous air embolism (tachypnoea, chest pain, and arterial hypoxaemia) during central venous catheter manipulation while a guide wire alone was in place. Pulse oximetry was used to detect hypoxaemia and suggest an aetiology for the patient's clinical symptoms. It is postulated that a previously described gasp reflex or some sort of sustained negative pressure manoeuvre caused venous air embolism around the guide wire and accounted for the patient's signs and symptoms. During central venous catheter placement, a high index of suspicion for venous air embolism should be maintained, pulse oximetry should be used, the skin entrance site should be kept covered by an occlusive dressing, and the patient should be positioned head-down. 
Arm edema in conservatively managed breast cancer: obesity is a major predictive factor To identify risk factors in the development of arm edema (AE) after conservative management of breast cancer, the authors prospectively measured differences in upper and lower arm circumference in 282 patients with stage I or II breast cancer who received radiation. AE was defined as a difference of 2.5 cm or more in either measurement between treated and untreated arms. Median follow-up was 37 months (range, 7-109 months). The crude frequency of AE overall was 19.5% (55 patients). In 21 patients (7.4%) AE was transient; 34 patients (12.1%) had persistent AE, which is the focus of this article. The 5-year actuarial incidence of persistent AE was 16%. The crude risk of persistent severe AE was 3.9%. Various factors were examined for their ability to enable prediction of AE. Treatment-related factors did not significantly enable prediction of AE, whereas factors related to patient size, such as body mass index, were strongly associated with both the frequency and severity of AE. 
Natural killer activity of human liver-derived lymphocytes in various liver diseases. Liver-derived lymphocytes were isolated from 40 human livers with end-stage liver disease that were removed at the time of orthotopic liver transplantation. In addition, 10 resection specimens or whole livers removed from patients with liver cancer and seven normal livers (unused donor organs) were studied as controls. Liver-derived lymphocytes were isolated from enzymatically digested tissue by gradient centrifugation and adherence to plastic. Their phenotypical characteristics were studied by two-color flow cytometry, and effector cell function was determined in 4-hr 51Cr-release assays against a natural killer-sensitive target, K562 (natural killer activity), natural killer-resistant Daudi line (lymphokine-activated killer activity) and by P815 line with or without phytohemagglutinin to assess lectin-dependent cellular cytotoxicity. Liver-derived lymphocytes isolated from normal liver contained equal proportions of T and natural killer lymphocytes (mean natural killer/T ratio = 0.7). CD3-CD56+CD16- natural killer cells were the main natural killer subset present in liver-derived lymphocytes, in contrast to the predominant natural killer phenotype in the circulation (CD56+CD16+). Control liver-derived lymphocytes had levels of cytotoxicity significantly greater than those of the normal peripheral-blood lymphocytes against all three targets. In contrast, liver-derived lymphocytes isolated from organs with advanced liver disease differed markedly in the natural killer/T cell ratio and levels of liver-derived lymphocyte cytotoxicity. Liver-derived lymphocytes obtained from hepatocellular carcinoma or rejecting allografts treated by immunosuppressive therapy had virtually no cytotoxicity. 
Serum alpha-L-fucosidase. A more sensitive marker for hepatocellular carcinoma? Forty-nine liver disease patients (7 chronic persistent hepatitis, CPH; 10 chronic active hepatitis, CAH; 13 liver cirrhosis, LC; 9 primary hepatocellular carcinoma, PHC, without LC; and 10 PHC with associated LC) and 20 controls were assessed for their serum alpha-L-fucosidase (ALF) and alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) levels and several routine liver injury parameters. Tumor diameter in those with hepatic cancer was assessed by angio-CT. Only ALF and AFP were significantly greater in patients with PHC and PHC + LC patients as compared to patients with LC alone. At an accepted cutoff level of 500 ng/ml, the AFP level provided 43% false negative tests. On the other hand, an ALF level exceeding 740 mumol/hr/ml provided a sensitivity of 84% with a specificity of 94%. No relationship between the ALF level and Child's criteria or with any liver injury parameter was evident. Considering all individual values, the ALF, rather than the AFP, correlated with tumor size. This finding suggests the ALF level may be of value in the early detection of PHC as well as in the follow-up of patients treated for PHC. 
Divided nevus of the eyelid. The two-stage surgical treatment of an adult female patient who presented with a congenital divided nevus of the left upper and lower lid is described. 
A single intravenous infusion of gamma globulin as compared with four infusions in the treatment of acute Kawasaki syndrome BACKGROUND. Treatment of acute Kawasaki syndrome with a four-day course of intravenous gamma globulin, together with aspirin, has been demonstrated to be safe and effective in preventing coronary-artery lesions and reducing systemic inflammation. We hypothesized that therapy with a single, very high dose of gamma globulin would be at least as effective as the standard regimen. METHODS. We conducted a multicenter, randomized, controlled trial involving 549 children with acute Kawasaki syndrome. The children were assigned to receive gamma globulin either as a single infusion of 2 g per kilogram of body weight over 10 hours or as daily infusions of 400 mg per kilogram for four consecutive days. Both treatment groups received aspirin (100 mg per kilogram per day through the 14th day of illness, then 3 to 5 mg per kilogram per day). RESULTS. The relative prevalence of coronary abnormalities, adjusted for age and sex, among patients treated with the four-day regimen, as compared with those treated with the single-infusion regimen, was 1.94 (95 percent confidence limits, 1.01 and 3.71) two weeks after enrollment and 1.84 (95 percent confidence limits, 0.89 and 3.82) seven weeks after enrollment. Children treated with the single-infusion regimen had lower mean temperatures while hospitalized (day 2, P less than 0.001; day 3, P = 0.004), as well as a shorter mean duration of fever (P = 0.028). Furthermore, in the single-infusion group the laboratory indexes of acute inflammation moved more rapidly toward normal, including the adjusted serum albumin level (P = 0.004), alpha 1-antitrypsin level (P = 0.007), and C-reactive protein level (P = 0.017). Lower IgG levels on day 4 were associated with a higher prevalence of coronary lesions (P = 0.005) and with a greater degree of systemic inflammation. The two groups had a similar incidence of adverse effects (including new or worsening congestive heart failure in nine children), which occurred in 2.7 percent of the children overall. All the adverse effects were transient. CONCLUSIONS. In children with acute Kawasaki disease, a single large dose of intravenous gamma globulin is more effective than the conventional regimen of four smaller daily doses and is equally safe. 
Use of botulinum toxin in strabismus after retinal detachment surgery. Botulinum toxin was used to treat 20 patients with strabismus after retinal detachment surgery. Preinjection motility deviations ranged from 10 to 60 prism diopters (D). Postinjection deviations ranged from 0 to 20 prism D, with 75% being 10 D or less. Eighty-five percent achieved fusion that persisted, with 73% requiring only one or two injections. Only muscles in the eye that had undergone retinal reattachment surgery were injected. The average period of follow-up was 12 months. Complications were rare and all resolved spontaneously. Botulinum toxin appears to be useful as a primary treatment modality for persistent strabismus following retinal detachment surgery, possibly obviating the need for complicated strabismus surgery. 
Gastric ulcer healing: a comparison of enprostil versus ranitidine. Enprostil is a synthetic prostaglandin E2 analogue with gastric antisecretory and mucosal protective properties. We compared the effects of enprostil and ranitidine on the healing of gastric ulcers and the subsequent relapse rates over 6 months. Patients (N = 156) were recruited for a double-blind study from 12 centers in Europe; 71 were randomly assigned to oral treatment with 35 micrograms enprostil twice daily and 85 to 150 mg ranitidine twice daily for up to 8 weeks. Both groups were of similar demography; their healing rates were also similar. Cumulative intent-to-treat healing rates were at 4 weeks enprostil 48%, ranitidine 41%: at 6 weeks enprostil 65%, ranitidine 68%; and at 8 weeks enprostil 72%, ranitidine 80%. Of those patients who met all protocol criteria and completed treatment, and were endoscoped at the prescribed times, healing rates were at 4 weeks enprostil 55%, ranitidine 54%, at 6 weeks enprostil 75%, ranitidine 84%; and at 8 weeks enprostil 80%, ranitidine 90%. Relief of pain was rapid and similar in both groups. The incidence of adverse events was low and similar in the two groups. The treatment-free relapse rate at 6 months was enprostil 64%, ranitidine 49%; the median times to relapse were 169 and 203 days, respectively. Enprostil and ranitidine appear to be equally effective in healing gastric ulcers. 
Limitations of open-chest cardiac massage after prolonged, untreated cardiac arrest in dogs. STUDY OBJECTIVES: Open-chest cardiac massage is an effective method of resuscitation if instituted within 15 minutes of normothermic cardiac arrest that has failed to respond to ongoing closed-chest CPR efforts. The usefulness of invasive forms of CPR after various periods of untreated cardiac arrest is less certain. This study was performed to determine the effectiveness of open-chest resuscitation after prolonged periods of untreated cardiac arrest. SETTING AND DESIGN: Prospective, controlled laboratory investigation using an animal model of cardiac arrest. Open-chest cardiac massage initially was compared to standard closed-chest compression CPR. The efficacy of open-chest CPR then was evaluated after ten and 40 minutes of untreated ventricular fibrillation. TYPE OF PARTICIPANTS: Twenty mongrel dogs (24 +/- 1 kg). MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: After 20 minutes of untreated ventricular fibrillation, open-chest resuscitation was significantly better than closed-chest efforts for the production of coronary perfusion pressure (58 +/- 14 vs 2 +/- 1 mm Hg; P less than .05) and initial resuscitation success (five of five vs one of five; P less than .03). Open-chest cardiac massage was equally effective for initial resuscitation if begun after ten or 20 minutes of untreated ventricular fibrillation (five of five vs five of five), but if untreated ventricular fibrillation continued for 40 minutes prior to instituting open-chest massage, no resuscitation benefit was found (none of five; P less than .005). There were marked differences in 24-hour survival depending on the length of time untreated cardiac arrest continued prior to instituting open-chest resuscitation efforts. After 20 minutes of ventricular fibrillation, initial resuscitation was successful with open-chest massage, but long-term survival was poor. CONCLUSION: Open-chest cardiac massage did not produce long-term survival if untreated cardiac arrest persisted for 20 or more minutes prior to invasive resuscitation efforts. 
The impact of colonoscopy on colorectal carcinoma. In an eight-year, ongoing study of 120 patients, 39 with carcinomas and 81 with adenomas, no patient has produced a new carcinoma despite a high incidence of metachronous adenomas. Colonoscopy can identify early carcinomas that can be resected for cure. In addition, colonoscopy can identify the adenomatous polyps and with polypectectomy prevent the progression to carcinoma. Colonoscopy is more accurate than air contrast barium enema, provides a tissue diagnosis, and allows polypectomy. When applied according to risk factors known to be cost effective, colonoscopy leads to earlier diagnosis and thus improved long-term survival. 
The influence of exercise-induced temperature elevations on the auditory brain-stem response (ABR). The influence of exercise on the auditory brain-stem response (ABR) was examined in 16 healthy volunteers (8 female and 8 male). Ipsilateral ABR recordings were obtained before and after exercise on a bicycle ergonometer. The rise of body temperature so generated was 0.5-2.1 degrees C (mean, 1.3 degrees C) as measured in the contralateral external auditory meatus. Latencies of waves III and V (but not wave I) were found to be significantly lower immediately post-exercise (P less than 0.01). The temperature relations of the latency of wave V are described by the regression equation: Latency (ms) = 11.06-0.146 x temp. (degrees C). (The effects on amplitude were not significant, nor were male/female differences.) It is suggested that exercise hyperthermia could be an appropriate model for the evaluation of the ABR in fever. 
Vagal stimulation and prevention of sudden death in conscious dogs with a healed myocardial infarction. The interest for the antifibrillatory effect of vagal stimulation has been largely limited by the fact that this concept seemed restricted to acute experiments in anesthetized animals. To explore the potentially protective role of vagal stimulation in conscious animals we developed a chronically implantable device to be placed around the cervical right vagus. An anterior myocardial infarction was produced in 161 dogs; 1 month later an exercise stress test was performed on the 105 survivors. Toward the end of the test the circumflex coronary artery was occluded for 2 minutes. Fifty-nine (56%) dogs developed ventricular fibrillation and, before this test was repeated, were assigned either to a control group (n = 24) or to be instrumented with the vagal device (n = 35). Five dogs were excluded because of electrode malfunction. Compared with the heart rate level attained after 30 seconds of occlusion during exercise in the control test, vagal stimulation led to a decrease of approximately 75 beats/min (from 255 +/- 33 to 170 +/- 36 beats/min, p less than 0.001). In the control group 22 (92%) of 24 dogs developed ventricular fibrillation during the second exercise and ischemia test. By contrast, during vagal stimulation ventricular fibrillation occurred in only 3 (10%) of the 30 dogs tested and recurred in 26 (87%) during an additional exercise and ischemia test in the control condition (p less than 0.001 versus the vagal stimulation test; internal control analysis). Combined analysis of the tests performed in the control condition showed that ventricular fibrillation was reproducible in 48 (89%) of the 54 dogs tested. The protective effect of vagal stimulation was also significant in the group comparison analysis and even after exclusion of those four dogs in which ventricular fibrillation was not reproducible (92% versus 11.5%, control versus vagal stimulation, p less than 0.001). When heart rate was kept constant by atrial pacing, the vagally mediated protection was still significant (p = 0.015) as five (55%) of nine dogs survived the test. This study shows that vagal stimulation, performed shortly after the onset of an acute ischemic episode in conscious animals with a healed myocardial infarction, can effectively prevent ventricular fibrillation. This striking result seems to depend on multiple mechanisms having a synergistic action. The decrease in heart rate is an important but not always essential protective mechanism. The electrophysiological effects secondary to the vagally mediated antagonism of the sympathetic activity on the heart are likely to play a major role. 
Analysis of beta, gamma, and delta T-cell receptor genes in mycosis fungoides and Sezary syndrome. The authors have analyzed the configuration of immunoglobulin (Ig) and beta, gamma and delta T-cell receptor (TCR) genes in DNA extracted from skin, lymph nodes, and peripheral blood mononuclear cells obtained from 41 patients with mycosis fungoides (MF), 14 patients with Sezary syndrome, and 13 patients with benign inflammatory dermatoses. No discrete rearranged bands (DRB) were detected in patients with inflammatory dermatoses. In tissue DNA from 19 patients with MF DRB were detected with beta and gamma, but not delta TCR probes. Only one patient with MF had a rearrangement of gamma and delta with germ line beta TCR genes. In 13 patients multiple biopsies were analyzed and DRB, when present, were identical in different lesions from individual patients. In three patients analysis of DNA from dermatopathic lymph nodes did not reveal DRB. Analysis of peripheral blood DNA from 24 patients revealed a discrete rearrangement of the gamma TCR gene in four patients and both beta and gamma genes in four additional patients. In MF DRB were detected more frequently with advancing stage of disease in tissues (P less than 0.01) but not in peripheral blood (P equals 0.36). Of 14 patients with Sezary syndrome, eight had DRB in peripheral blood DNA with both beta and gamma probes and in three of these patients identical DRB were also detected in DNA from skin biopsy samples. In contrast, DRB were not detected in the peripheral blood of the other six patients. In both MF and Sezary syndrome there was no restricted usage of particular V gamma genes. These results indicate that in MF (1) T-cell clones can be detected in skin biopsy specimens from the majority of patients with early stage disease, (2) gamma delta T-cell clones are only rarely found, and (3) TCR gene analysis can detect T-cell clones in the peripheral blood with a greater degree of specificity than conventional light microscopic study. In Sezary syndrome these studies also suggest that a subset of patients have a polyclonal population of circulating atypical lymphoid cells. In addition these patients appear to have a better prognosis than those with monoclonal disease. 
Soft tissue Ewing's sarcoma. Characterization in established cultures and xenografts with evidence of a neuroectodermic phenotype. This study characterizes the histogenesis of soft tissue Ewing's sarcoma (StEs) based upon an analysis of three tumors. Long-term cultured cell lines and nude mice xenografts were established from original neoplasms or from their metastases. Histologically they revealed a small round cell pattern without signs of differentiation. Several ultrastructural features of neural type were found; the same were also seen on culture cell lines. Moreover, immunohistochemical study for neural markers revealed the presence of HNK-1, NSE, LIRC-LON 36, S-100 protein, glial fibrillary acidic protein, neurofilaments (70 kilodaltons), and chromogranin; some of these markers were present only in the transplants. Cytokeratin was also seen. The translocation t(11;22)(q24;q12) was found in all three neoplasms together with other chromosomal abnormalities. N-myc RNA gave negative results whereas c-myc RNA was expressed. Therefore it may be postulated that StEs displays neuroectodermal features somewhat similar to those seen in peripheral neuroepithelioma as well as in atypical Ewing's sarcoma of bone. 
Concurrent nitroglycerin administration decreases thrombolytic potential of tissue-type plasminogen activator. Dynamic coronary vasoconstriction may play a role in coronary artery reocclusion after successful thrombolysis. The effect of nitroglycerin on the thrombolytic effects of recombinant tissue-type plasminogen activator (rt-PA) was examined in dogs with an electrically induced occlusive coronary artery thrombus. Eleven dogs were randomly given rt-PA alone and seven rt-PA with nitroglycerin. The dose of rt-PA was 0.75 mg/kg body weight given over 20 min and the dose of nitroglycerin was 125 micrograms/min for 40 min. The reperfusion rate in the dogs given rt-PA alone was 73% (8 of 11 dogs) and that in the rt-PA plus nitroglycerin group was 57% (four of seven dogs) (p = NS). The time to thrombolysis (or reperfusion) in dogs receiving rt-PA plus nitroglycerin was 70% greater than in those receiving rt-PA alone (means +/- SD/29.8 +/- 9.9 versus 17.6 +/- 5.9 min, p less than 0.02), and the duration of reperfusion much shorter (11 +/- 17 versus 42 +/- 16 min, p less than 0.02). Peak coronary blood flow after reperfusion in dogs receiving rt-PA plus nitroglycerin was also less than in those receiving rt-PA alone (36 +/- 52 versus 63 +/- 20 ml/min, p less than 0.02). Reocclusion occurred in all dogs given rt-PA with nitroglycerin and in six of eight given rt-PA alone (p = NS). Plasma concentrations of rt-PA were lower when nitroglycerin was given with rt-PA alone (427 +/- 279 versus 1,471 +/- 600 ng/ml, p less than 0.01). 
Helicobacter pylori-negative duodenal ulcer. PURPOSE PATIENTS AND METHODS: Helicobacter pylori (HP) is present in more than 90% of duodenal ulcers (DUs). To investigate the pathophysiology in those patients with DU who are HP-negative compared with those who are HP-positive, we interviewed consecutive patients prior to endoscopy regarding factors often associated with ulcer disease. At esophagogastroduodenoscopy, antral biopsy specimens were obtained for urease test, culture, and Warthin Starry staining for HP in all patients with DU who did not have active bleeding. RESULTS: Compared with HP-positive patients who had DU, HP-negative patients with DU were more likely to be aspirin users and less likely to have had prior ulcers. HP-positive patients with DU had more severe antral inflammation than HP-negative patients. Whites were more likely to be HP-negative than blacks. HP-negative patients with DU most commonly presented with bleeding, whereas HP-positive patients with DU presented with pain. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest a different mechanism for DUs in patients who are HP-positive versus those who are HP-negative, and this difference might have a bearing on treatment. The absence of HP should lead to a more thorough search for nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug/aspirin use, Zollinger-Ellison syndrome, and other potential causes of DUs. 
Prevention of restenosis by lovastatin after successful coronary angioplasty. Prevention of restenosis after successful percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA) remains a major challenge. To determine whether lovastatin could prevent restenosis, between December 1987 and July 1988, a total of 157 patients undergoing successful PTCA were randomly and prospectively assigned to the lovastatin group or a control group. Seventy-nine patients received lovastatin (20 mg daily if the serum cholesterol level was less than 300 mg/dl and 40 mg daily if the serum cholesterol level was greater than or equal to 300 mg/dl) in addition to conventional therapy (lovastatin group). Seventy-eight patients received conventional therapy alone (control group). Fifty patients in the lovastatin group and 29 in the control group were evaluated with coronary angiography at an interval of 2 to 10 months (mean 4 months). The restenosis rate was evaluated according to the number of patients showing restenosis, the number of vessels restenosed, and the number of PTCA sites restenosed. Restenosis was defined as the presence of greater than 50% stenosis of the PTCA site. In the lovastatin group 6 of 50 patients (12%) had restenosis compared with 13 of 29 patients (44.4%) in the control group (p less than 0.001). When the number of vessels restenosed was considered, only 9 of 72 vessels (12.5%) restenosed in the lovastatin group compared with 13 of 34 vessels (38.2%) in the control group (p less than 0.002). Similarly, 10 of 80 (12.5%) PTCA sites restenosed in the lovastatin group compared with 15 of 36 (41.7%) in the control group (p less than 0.001). 
Hemorrhagic events during therapy with recombinant tissue-type plasminogen activator, heparin, and aspirin for acute myocardial infarction. Results of the Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction (TIMI), Phase II Trial. OBJECTIVES: To assess the effects of invasive procedures, hemostatic and clinical variables, the timing of beta-blocker therapy, and the doses of recombinant plasminogen activator (rt-PA) on hemorrhagic events. DESIGN: A multicenter, randomized, controlled trial. SETTING: Hospitals participating in the Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction, Phase II trial (TIMI II). INTERVENTIONS: Patients received rt-PA, heparin, and aspirin. The total dose of rt-PA was 150 mg for the first 520 patients and 100 mg for the remaining 2819 patients. Patients were randomly assigned to an invasive strategy (coronary arteriography with percutaneous angioplasty [if feasible] done routinely 18 to 48 hours after the start of thrombolytic therapy) or to a conservative strategy (coronary arteriography done for recurrent spontaneous or exercise-induced ischemia). Eligible patients were also randomly assigned to either immediate intravenous or deferred beta-blocker therapy. MEASUREMENTS: Patients were monitored for hemorrhagic events during hospitalization. MAIN RESULTS: In patients on the 100-mg rt-PA regimen, major and minor hemorrhagic events were more common among those assigned to the invasive than among those assigned to the conservative strategy (18.5% versus 12.8%, P less than 0.001). Major or minor hemorrhagic events were associated with the extent of fibrinogen breakdown, peak rt-PA levels, thrombocytopenia, prolongation of the activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT) to more than 90 seconds, weight of 70 kg or less, female gender, and physical signs of cardiac decompensation. Immediate intravenous beta-blocker therapy had no important effect on hemorrhagic events when compared with delayed beta-blocker therapy. Intracranial hemorrhages were more frequent among patients treated with the 150-mg rt-PA dose than with the 100-mg rt-PA dose (2.1% versus 0.5%, P less than 0.001). The extent of the plasmin-mediated hemostatic defect was also greater in patients receiving the 150-mg dose. CONCLUSIONS: Increased morbidity due to hemorrhagic complications is associated with an invasive management strategy in patients with acute myocardial infarction. Our findings show the complex interaction of several factors in the occurrence of hemorrhagic events during thrombolytic therapy. 
Morphine pharmacokinetics and pain assessment after intracerebroventricular administration in patients with terminal cancer. Morphine pharmacokinetics and pain relief were evaluated after intracerebroventricular administration of morphine (0.4 +/- 0.11 mg) in seven patients with cancer suffering from intractable pain. Ventricular cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), lumbar CSF, and plasma morphine concentrations were analyzed by a specific morphine radioimmunoassay. A two-compartment model was sufficient to describe the kinetics of morphine in ventricular CSF. Morphine diffuses to the lumbar level, and the mean maximum concentration was 192 +/- 105 ng/ml at 4.5 +/- 1.3 hours. Ventricular and lumbar CSF morphine kinetics showed a similar decline during the elimination phase, with terminal half-lives of 3.8 +/- 0.6 hours and 4.2 +/- 1.6 hours, respectively. Pain relief was evaluated by a visual analog scale: the test showed a rapid onset of analgesia (less than 10 minutes). Analgesic effectiveness reached a maximum between 6 and 10 hours. The relationship between pharmacologic effect and morphine concentrations in ventricular CSF resulted in an anticlockwise hysteresis curve. The presence of morphine in lumbar CSF suggested an additive spinal action of morphine, which probably plays a role in the duration of analgesia. 
Intraoperative monitoring of facial nerve function in cerebellopontine angle surgery. Facial nerve paralysis associated with cerebellopontine angle surgery has been reported to range up to 26% in a recent series. Various methods of intraoperatively monitoring the facial nerve have been developed to reduce the incidence of facial paralysis. We report our experience with an intraoperative monitoring technique using intramuscular EMG electrodes to detect subclinical electrical responses that were amplified and made audible to the operating surgeon after gating stimulus artifacts. A 3.6% incidence of facial paralysis in 111 consecutive cases with this intraoperative monitoring method compared with 14.5% in 207 previously unmonitored cases indicates significant reduction of this complication in cerebellopontine angle surgery (p less than 0.001). Along with this reduction in facial paralysis, an increase in the percentage of partial facial paresis was observed in the monitored group (p less than 0.05). The percentage of those with intact facial function was similar in the monitored (82.0%) and unmonitored groups (78.3%). 
Transient pulsus alternans induced by isosorbide dinitrate: echocardiographic and hemodynamic evidence of reduced venous return--a case report. Transient pulsus alternans was induced by isosorbide dinitrate (ISDN) in a patient with postmyocarditis congestive heart failure under diuretic therapy. The severity and duration of pulsus alternans depended on the dose of ISDN. According to the echocardiographic and hemodynamic examinations, the superimposed preload reduction caused by ISDN combined with decreased blood volume owing to diuretic therapy most likely contributed to the development of pulsus alternans. 
Meningitis from canine Pasteurella multocida following mastoidectomy. A case of Pasteurella multocida meningitis, following a mastoidectomy is presented. The association of close contact with pets, many of which harbour Pasteurella multocida as part of their normal buccal flora. This case confirms the potential benefit of taking an ear swab prior to mastoid surgery and in seeking an appropriate 'pet' history. 
Common reactions to transfusions. A blood transfusion is a special kind of transplantation, with the transfer of living tissue from one person to another. Reactions can occur with as little as 10 to 15 ml of incompatible blood. The onset of a reaction may be misleading or delayed, and its detection requires astute assessment. Responsibility for recognition of a transfusion reaction lies with the transfusionist, who is often a nurse. The following types of response can occur: hemolytic reactions, transfusion-induced graft-versus-host disease, hemoglobinuria, purpura, fever, circulatory overload, thrombophlebitis, urticaria, hyperkalemia, asymptomatic hemoglobinuria, pulmonary edema, and allergic and anaphylactic reactions. Critical care nurses need to be aware of the dangers of blood and blood product transfusions and to be prepared to react quickly. 
Presentation of acute uterine inversion in the emergency department. A case of acute puerperal uterine inversion is described in a patient who presented to the emergency department after a home birth and a prolonged third stage of labor. The cardinal findings were shock and excessive blood loss. The uterus and attached placenta were protruding from the vagina and the normal cervical landmarks were absent. Emergency management consisted in vigorous fluid resuscitation prior to transfer to the operating room for definitive reversion. 
Gastric carcinoma presenting as an exacerbation of ulcers during pregnancy. A case report. Gastric cancer is unusual during pregnancy. Also, because of the physiologic changes that occur with pregnancy, it is rare to see a worsening of peptic ulcers during pregnancy. A patient with an exacerbation of peptic ulcers presented with gastric carcinoma during pregnancy. 
Obliterations of the proximal subclavian artery: to bypass or to anastomose? A clinical series has been analysed to determine which of two similar, extrathoracic "extraanatomic" methods of treating proximal blocks of the subclavian artery is the superior option. From 1975 until 1988 direct carotid-subclavian anastomosis was used in 32 patients and carotid-subclavian bypass in 19. There were no statistically significant differences for the probability of postoperative survival (p less than 0.877 Breslow; p less than 0.774 Mantel), intraoperative blood loss or the duration of anaesthesia. Those patients who had undergone subclavian artery repair had a significantly longer survival than those following carotid bifurcation endarterectomy (p less than 0.002 Breslow, p less than 0.0002 Mantel). As patients with subclavian lesions have a reasonable life-expectancy, they may possibly experience late complications of their vascular repair. Therefore it seems important to select the most durable operation, and direct carotid subclavian anastomosis has a significantly greater patency rate than bypass (p less than 0.006 Breslow, p less than 0.006 Mantel). Patients with preoperative symptoms of cerebrovascular insufficiency had a lower probability of survival than those with upper extremity claudication, although this did not reach statistical significance (p less than 0.205 Breslow; p less than 0.198 Mantel). 
Practical approach to the diagnosis of unexplained chest pain. Chest pain is a frequent medical problem causing concern for both patients and physicians. A multidisciplinary meeting recently developed algorithms for evaluating these patients in the two most common scenarios for the presentation of chest pain: (1) new onset of chest pain in the primary care setting, and (2) recurrent chest pain in the the referral setting. In both situations, the primary care physician, rather than specialists, should direct the evaluation and treatment of patients with chest pain and normal coronary angiograms. 
Differential susceptibility of activated macrophage cytotoxic effector reactions to the suppressive effects of transforming growth factor-beta 1. We examined the effects of TGF-beta 1 on induction of several activated macrophage antimicrobial activities against the protozoan parasite Leishmania, and on induction of tumoricidal activity against the fibrosarcoma tumor target 1023. TGF-beta by itself did not affect the viability of either the intracellular or extracellular target in concentrations up to 200 ng/ml. As little as 1 ng/ml TGF-beta, however, suppressed more than 70% of the intracellular killing activity of macrophages treated with lymphokines. In contrast, more than 100 ng/ml TGF-beta was required to suppress intracellular killing by cells activated with an equivalent amount of recombinant IFN-gamma. Addition of TGF-beta for up to 30 min after exposure to activation factors significantly reduced macrophage killing of intracellular parasites. Pretreatment of macrophages with TGF-beta was even more effective: treatment of cells with TGF-beta for 4 h before addition of activation factors abolished all macrophage intracellular killing activity. Regardless of treatment sequence, however, TGF-beta had absolutely no effect, at any concentration tested, on activated macrophage resistance to infection induced by lymphokines or by the cooperative interaction of IFN-gamma and IL-4. Effects of TGF-beta on tumoricidal activity of activated macrophages was intermediate to that of its effects on intracellular killing or resistance to infection. Lymphokine-induced tumor cytotoxicity was marginally (25%) affected by TGF-beta; 200 ng/ml was able to suppress IFN-gamma-induced tumoricidal activity by 40%. Thus, TGF-beta dramatically suppressed certain activated macrophage cytotoxic effector reactions, but was only partially or not at all effective against others, even when the same activation agent (IFN-gamma) was used. The biochemical target for TGF-beta suppressive activity in these reactions may be the pathway for nitric oxide production from L-arginine, because TGF-beta also inhibited the generation of nitric oxide by cytokine-activated macrophages. 
Gastrointestinal cytology. Since the development of the fiberoptic endoscope, laboratories have received cytologic specimens obtained from all segments of the gastrointestinal tract in increasing numbers to identify infectious agents and neoplasms. Adenocarcinomas generally are easily diagnosed and distinguished from reparative atypia, but their precursor lesions, dysplasia and adenomas, provide greater interpretive challenges. The same is true for such entities as malignant lymphomas. Most mesenchymal tumors remain outside the diagnostic capabilities of most cytologists. 
Central nervous system toxicity from nebulized atropine sulfate. Central anticholinergic intoxication can result from iatrogenic sources. We report the occurrence of a central anticholinergic syndrome in a patient treated with aerosolized atropine. 
Noninvasive grading of musculoskeletal tumors using PET. Twenty-five patients with mass lesions involving the musculoskeletal system were studied with positron emission tomography (PET) in order to determine if a relationship exists between histologic grade and tumor uptake of [fluorine-18]2-deoxy-2-fluoro-D-glucose (FDG). There were 6 benign lesions and 19 malignant lesions of various grades. A high correlation (Rho = 0.83) was found between the normalized uptake of tracer and the NCl grade. The high-grade malignancies had significantly greater (p = 0.0091) uptake of FDG than the combination of benign lesions and low-grade malignancies. All lesions with a normalized uptake value of 1.6 or greater were high-grade, while all lesions less than 1.6 represented either benign tumors or low grade malignancies. This strong relationship between FDG uptake and grade among neoplasms from a wide variety of cell types within a single organ system suggests that the technique may be useful in predicting grade even when the cell type is unknown. 
The association of laryngoceles with squamous cell carcinoma of the larynx. The clinical diagnosis of laryngoceles simultaneously occurring with squamous cell carcinoma of the larynx is infrequent; however, when specimens from patients with laryngeal cancer have been examined closely, the two entities have been associated in 4.9% to 28.8% of cases. Despite this apparent relationship, the literature has failed to address the potential impact of a concurrent laryngocele on surgical decision making. Also, the wide variation in the reported rates of simultaneous occurrence of these two entities is unexplained. We performed whole-organ histopathologic analysis on a laryngeal specimen with bilateral external laryngoceles associated with squamous cell carcinoma and correlated this to computed tomography findings. Based on this information and other reports concerning the pattern of spread of carcinoma within laryngoceles, it appears that supraglottic laryngectomy is oncologically sound in the presence of a laryngocele as long as the usual criteria for this procedure are met. 
Cardiovascular causes of syncope. Identifying and controlling trigger mechanisms. Syncope usually has a cardiovascular source, so neurologic evaluation has a low diagnostic yield in these patients. Cardiac arrhythmias in persons with or without structural heart disease can produce syncope. Neurocardiogenic dysfunction that results in diminished venous return and hypercontractility is another frequent cause. Postural hypotension or left ventricular outflow obstruction may also be to blame. Careful history taking and physical examination, head-up tilt testing, echocardiography or radionuclide isotope imaging, and electrophysiologic study are often diagnostic. However, syncope remains undiagnosed in some patients, and they may require periodic reassessment. Treatment options are available for most cardiovascular disorders, among them use of pharmacologic agents; catheter, surgical, or radio-frequency modification of certain tachycardias; and permanent pacing. 
Fact and fancy. What can we really tell from the placenta? Considerable interest in the clinical significance of placental abnormalities has been fueled by malpractice claims when perinatal outcome is less than optimal. The pathologist must be aware of those placental lesions that may contribute to perinatal morbidity and mortality. This article reviews the abnormalities of placentation, placental weight, maternal uteroplacental blood flow, villous histological makeup, fetoplacental blood flow, the umbilical cord, and the membranes, as well as the problems of multiple pregnancy. The important contribution of abnormal uteroplacental blood flow to adverse perinatal outcome is emphasized, as is the need to determine the extent of placental damage when evaluating the contribution thereto of particular placental abnormalities. 
Pronounced reduction of aortic flow velocity and acceleration during heavy isometric exercise in coronary artery disease. Doppler-derived parameters of aortic flow were examined during heavy isometric exercise in 48 men with coronary artery disease (CAD) and in 48 gender- and age-matched healthy controls. The aim was to determine which parameters best separated the groups and to look for a possible relation between exercise-induced Doppler patterns and the extent of CAD. Isometric exercise was performed with a 2-hand bar dynamometer, and the subjects were required to perform 50% of maximal voluntary contraction for 2 minutes. Examination was performed with a pulsed Doppler transducer positioned at the suprasternal notch. Resting peak flow velocity, acceleration time, stroke volume index and cardiac index did not show significant differences between the groups. However, mean acceleration and stroke work were significantly lower in patients with CAD. In this group, exercise peak flow velocity decreased from 98 +/- 13 to 55 +/- 12 cm/s, flow velocity integral from 14 +/- 3 to 7 +/- 3 cm, mean acceleration from 11 +/- 0.9 to 4.7 +/- 1 m/s/s, and stroke volume index from 41 +/- 6 to 23 +/- 4 ml/m2 (p less than 0.001 for all). Cardiac index decreased from 2.7 +/- 0.4 to 2 +/- 0.2 liters/min/m2 (p less than 0.05). Acceleration time increased from 82 +/- 6 to 116 +/- 7 ms. In most of the indexes, the directional changes induced by isometric exercise were similar in patients with CAD and in normal control subjects. The differences compared with the rest values were significantly greater in the CAD group, and especially in patients presenting with 3-vessel disease. 
Mayer-Rokitansky-Kuster-Hauser syndrome associated with endodermal sinus tumor of the ovary. Both EST and Mayer-Rokitansky-Kuster-Hauser syndrome are uncommon disorders. This report illustrates a case of these two rare conditions occurring in the same patient. Patients with Mayer-Rokitansky-Kuster-Hauser syndrome, although not appearing to be at increased risk for germ cell tumors, unlike testicular feminization patients, are not immune to ovarian cancer. Therefore, individuals with Mayer-Rokitansky-Kuster-Hauser syndrome should still be followed gynecologically because they are at least at the normal risk of developing ovarian as well as other gynecological neoplasms. 
Gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonist (leuprolide acetate) induced ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome in a woman undergoing intermittent hemodialysis. Moderate ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome occurred after LA was administered to control menorrhagia in an anephric woman who required hemodialysis. We postulate that women who require dialysis may be at special risk for the development of this syndrome. 
Structure-dependent dynamic mechanical behavior of fibrous caps from human atherosclerotic plaques. BACKGROUND. Although thrombosis associated with a fissured atherosclerotic plaque is believed to be the most common cause of acute coronary syndromes, the underlying factors that trigger plaque rupture are currently unknown. However, the mechanical behavior of the plaque is probably of critical importance. METHODS AND RESULTS. To test the hypothesis that the mechanical properties of a plaque are dependent on its composition and, in particular, that the stiffness of fibrous caps changes within the range of frequencies carried by a physiological pressure wave, the stress-strain relation was studied in 27 fibrous caps and related to the underlying histological structure of the fibrous cap. Fibrous caps were obtained during 14 autopsies from the abdominal aorta and were classified by histological examination as cellular (n = 7), hypocellular (n = 9), or calcified (n = 11). Hypocellular fibrous caps were 1-2 times stiffer than cellular caps (p less than 0.005), and calcified caps were 4-5 times stiffer than cellular caps (p less than 0.005). All 27 fibrous caps demonstrated an increase in stiffness with increasing frequencies of stress ranging from 0.05 to 10 Hz; the increase in stiffness was similar in all three histological classes. CONCLUSIONS. We conclude that the stiffness of fibrous caps from human atherosclerotic plaques is related to the underlying histological structure and that the stiffness increases with frequency in the range of physiological heart rates. The protective benefit of beta-adrenergic receptor blocking agents in coronary artery disease may, in part, be related to the frequency dependence of atherosclerotic plaque stiffness. 
Malignant biliary obstruction complicated by ascites: transjugular insertion of an expandable metallic endoprosthesis. Although the transjugular approach has long been used to provide safe access to the liver, it has not been used for placement of stents in biliary obstruction. The recent development of an expandable metallic endoprosthesis now makes this method more feasible. The case of a patient with malignant biliary obstruction complicated by ascites is presented herein. Palliation was achieved with an expandable biliary endoprosthesis placed by the transjugular-hepatic vein approach. 
Identical orocecal transit time and serum motilin in hyperthermia and normothermia. Fever, exercise, and exposure to a hot environment can all cause symptoms of gastrointestinal dysfunction as they elevate body temperature. Nonetheless, the link between hyperthermia per se and these symptoms is unknown. To test the functional significance of increased body temperature, we investigated the influence of substantial passive hyperthermia on orocecal transit in 12 young, healthy men. Transit time was determined by a consistent rise in H2 concentration in a rebreathing apparatus after oral ingestion of 0.7 g lactulose/kg body weight. Lactulose was given in combination with a 350-ml liquid meal (360 kcal). After raising core temperature in warm water to 38.3 degrees C, orocecal transit time was identical to control (90 +/- 13 min at 38.3 degrees C, 92 +/- 13 min at 37.1 degrees C). While hyperthermia did elevate heart rate and minute ventilation, serum motilin, gastrin, and cortisol were similar in the two conditions. The failure of a passive core temperature rise to alter mouth-to-cecum transit suggests that this aspect of alimentary function is independent of body temperature. 
Breslow thickness of cutaneous malignant melanoma in paraffin wax and frozen sections. Breslow tumour thickness was measured in frozen and paraffin wax sections from 21 excision biopsies of cutaneous malignant melanomas by two observers. There was no consistent variation between frozen and paraffin wax sections, with recorded differences ranging from +0.3 mm to -0.2 mm. Interobserver differences ranged from +0.4 mm to -0.2 mm. The interobserver variations exceeded the intraobserver variations, but neither were significant. These findings show conclusively that, when using high quality frozen sections, there is no significant difference between Breslow thickness measured in frozen or paraffin wax sections and therefore that frozen sections can be used to microstage melanoma. Interobserver variations seem to be a more likely source of erroneous measurements of tumour thickness. 
Association of hypovolemia after subarachnoid hemorrhage with computed tomographic scan evidence of raised intracranial pressure. Hypovolemic patients are more likely to suffer delayed cerebral ischemia and infarction after a subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH). Prompt recognition and correction of hypovolemia may improve the outcome. We have identified computed tomographic (CT) scan findings that increase the probability of a patient presenting with hypovolemia soon after an SAH. The plasma volume (PV) of 25 patients admitted within 96 hours of an SAH was measured using radioiodinated serum albumin. The normal PVs were measured in an outpatient setting 6 months later or predicted from their total body water. Nine patients (36%) were found to be hypovolemic, defined as a fall in PV exceeding 10% of the normal PV (mean fall, 18 +/- 2%). Sixteen patients were normovolemic or hypervolemic (mean PV, +9 +/- 2%). The basal cisterns were compressed or obliterated on the CT scans of all hypovolemic patients compared with 12.5% of normovolemic patients (chi-square, 14.52; P less than 0.01). The probabilities of a patient being hypovolemic if the CT scan indicated raised intracranial pressure were high: hydrocephalus, P = 0.80; compression of the basal cisterns, P = 0.82; and compression of the basal cisterns associated with intracerebral hematoma or midline shift, P = 1.00. Patients with an SAH and radiological evidence of raised intracranial pressure should be considered at particular risk for systemic hypovolemia. 
Invasive aspergillus rhinosinusitis in patients with acute leukemia. Invasive aspergillus rhinosinusitis is a potentially lethal complication of chemotherapy-induced neutropenia in patients with acute leukemia. The majority of cases are caused by Aspergillus flavus. The infection is difficult to diagnose early but should be suspected when a neutropenic patient develops persistent fever without a known source, symptoms of rhinitis or sinusitis, cutaneous findings over the nose or sinuses, symptoms and signs of orbital or cavernous sinus disease, or an ulcerating lesion of the hard palate or gingiva. Careful anterior rhinoscopy followed by computed tomography of the sinus helps establish the diagnosis, which should be confirmed by histologic study and culture of biopsied material. Early treatment with aggressive surgery, high-dose amphotericin B and 5-fluorocytosine, and possibly white blood cell transfusions may produce a cure if the patient's bone marrow recovers. Newer antifungal agents offer promise for prophylaxis and treatment of this infection. 
A randomized trial evaluating leuprolide acetate before hysterectomy as treatment for leiomyomas. Fifty premenopausal patients requiring hysterectomy as treatment for symptomatic uterine leiomyomas, which were the size of 14 to 18 weeks' gestation, were randomized into two groups to determine whether preoperative gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonist would increase the feasibility of vaginal rather than abdominal hysterectomy. The control group (group A; n = 25) did not receive preoperative gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonist, but patients in Group B (n = 25) received 2 months of gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonist before undergoing hysterectomy. Patients in the two groups were similar with respect to age, gravidity, parity, pretreatment uterine size, and hemoglobin and hematocrit levels. Patients in group B had an increase in hemoglobin levels (10.75 to 12.12 gm/dl, p less than 0.05) and a decrease in uterine volume (1086.7 to 723.4 ml, p less than 0.05) after 8 weeks of agonist therapy and were more likely to undergo vaginal hysterectomy (76.0% vs 16%). Patients in group B also had shorter hospitalizations (5.2 vs 3.8 days, p less than 0.05). We conclude that the administration of gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonist for 2 months followed by vaginal hysterectomy is preferable to abdominal hysterectomy in selected patients with uterine leiomyomas. 
Cleft palate fistulas: a multivariate statistical analysis of prevalence, etiology, and surgical management. A retrospective, multivariate statistical analysis of 129 consecutive nonsyndromic patients undergoing cleft palate repair was performed to document the incidence of postoperative fistulas, to determine their cause, and to review methods of surgical management. Nasal-alveolar fistulas and/or anterior palatal fistulas that were intentionally not repaired were excluded from study. Cleft palate fistulas (CPFs) occurred in 30 of 129 patients (23 percent), although nearly a half were 1 to 2 mm in size. Extent of clefting, as estimated by the Veau classification, was significantly more severe in those patients who developed cleft palate fistula. Type of palate closure also influenced the frequency of cleft palate fistula. Forty-three percent of patients undergoing Wardill-type closures developed cleft palate fistula versus 10, 22, and 0 percent for Furlow, von Langenbeck, and Dorrance style closures, respectively. The fistula rate was similar in patients with (30 percent) and without (25 percent) intravelar veloplasty. Age at palate closure did not significantly affect the rate of fistulization; however, the surgeon performing the initial closure did not have an effect. Thirty-seven percent of patients developed recurrent cleft palate fistulas following initial fistula repair. Recurrence of cleft palate fistulas was not influenced by severity of cleft or type of original palate repair. Following end-stage management, a second cleft palate fistula recurrence occurred in 25 percent of patients. Continued open discussion of results of cleft palate repair is recommended. 
Deafness after bilateral midbrain contusion: a correlation of magnetic resonance imaging with auditory brain stem evoked responses. A 46-year-old woman became deaf after a closed head injury. When a computed tomographic scan failed to disclose the cause, conversion disorder was suspected. Magnetic resonance imaging, however, showed bilateral contusions of the inferior colliculi, providing objective evidence for an organic cause of hearing loss. Auditory brain stem evoked responses and stapedial reflexes also provided objective evidence of brain stem injury. This case illustrates the phenomenon of dorsal midbrain injury after head trauma. It indicates the sensitivity of magnetic resonance imaging for small focal lesions after head trauma, and it demonstrates some difficulties in the diagnosis of "hysterical" deafness. 
Chronic cough in children. Chronic cough in children is a frequent complaint seen by the primary health care provider. Although many of these coughs spontaneously resolve, some are caused by a more serious process and require further attention. Selecting those patients who will benefit from a more extensive evaluation can be a difficult challenge. An overview is provided that emphasizes a systematic approach to the diagnosis and management of chronic cough. 
Acute hemorrhagic diarrhea and cardiovascular collapse in a young child owing to environmentally acquired cocaine. Acute crack cocaine intoxication has become a significant problem in both adolescent and adult patients. Recently, cases of cocaine toxicity in infants and toddlers have been described. We report a four-year-old child with acute hemorrhagic diarrhea and shock after intoxication by crack cocaine. Acute cocaine intoxication should be considered in the differential for hemorrhagic diarrhea and shock. The gastrointestinal decontamination following cocaine ingestion is discussed. 
The t(1;22) (p13;q13) is nonrandom and restricted to infants with acute megakaryoblastic leukemia: a Pediatric Oncology Group Study. We report the nonrandom occurrence and frequency of the t(1;22)(p13;q13) in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and its close association with the French-American-British M7 subtype of AML in infants (less than 1 year). This chromosomal abnormality occurred in 6 of 252 (2.4%) children and adolescents with AML (6 of 28 infants, 22%; 6 of 18 M7 AML cases overall, 33%; and 6 of 6 M7 cases in infants). Infants with AML of M7 subtype and the t(1;22) often presented with prominent abdominal masses. Two of these infants were not treated and died early. Three of four treated infants entered complete remission with therapy for AML; the remaining infant died of hemorrhage on day 8. Of the three infants who entered remission, only one remains alive and disease free at 5+ months. The other two infants relapsed in the bone marrow at 5 and 2 months from the start of therapy, respectively. We conclude that M7 AML with the t(1;22) usually presents in infants with extensive infiltration of abdominal organs by leukemic cells and may confer a poor prognosis despite intensive AML-directed treatment. Identification of this nonrandom translocation exclusively in infants with acute megakaryoblastic leukemia (AMkL) implies that it may serve as an additional diagnostic marker for this disease and links it to the pathogenesis of AMkL in infants. 
Intracellular calcium and ventricular fibrillation. Studies in the aequorin-loaded isovolumic ferret heart. To elucidate the role of changes in [Ca2+]i in the induction of ventricular fibrillation (VF), Ca2+i signals, epicardial electrical potentials, and isovolumic left ventricular pressure were simultaneously recorded in isolated intact ferret hearts loaded with aequorin, a bioluminescent protein. When the preparations were perfused with 3 microM acetylstrophanthidin and 8 mM Ca2+, or with a low Na+ solution (18 mM Na+, 100 mM Li+), spontaneous transitions to the VF state were consistently observed within a short period of time. The initiation of spontaneous VF was preceded by development of a Ca2+i overload state, coincidental with the ascending phase of diastolic Ca2+i oscillations, and was followed by further elevation in Ca2+i levels, which were associated with augmented Ca2+i oscillations of a saw-toothed pattern. Pretreatment with 10 microM ryanodine, which blocked Ca2+i oscillations in the preparation, did not eliminate inducibility of VF by means of AC electrical stimulations; however, VF no longer occurred spontaneously, and the threshold for VF induction increased markedly. In the absence of a state of Ca2+i overload, spontaneous defibrillation occurred within a minute after the initiation of VF. We conclude that 1) VF can be induced in the absence of Ca2+i oscillations; however, 2) Ca2+i oscillations play a crucial role as a trigger for VF and therefore are an important determinant of the vulnerability to VF; and 3) the augmented Ca2+i oscillations after the transition to VF state may support the maintenance of this type of arrhythmia. 
Urinary fibrinopeptide A in evaluation of patients with suspected acute pulmonary embolism. A prospective pilot study. This pilot study assessed the urinary fibrinopeptide A (uFPA) levels and the combination of uFPA test plus ventilation/perfusion (V/Q) scan in the diagnostic evaluation of acute pulmonary embolism (PE). One hundred consecutive patients were studied prospectively. Twenty-nine patients fulfilled diagnostic criteria defined in this study (seven with and 22 without PE). The uFPA concentration was significantly higher in patients with than without PE (41.1 +/- 2.6 vs 4.8 +/- 2.5 ng/mg of creatinine, p less than 0.0001). In all patients with PE, the uFPA levels were higher than threshold value derived by adding 2 standard deviations to the mean uFPA concentration of patients without PE. In patients without PE, the V/Q scan was negative in 16, the uFPA test was negative in 18, and at least one of the tests was negative in 21. These preliminary data suggest that a negative uFPA test may be helpful in excluding PE and that uFPA in combination with V/Q lung scans may correctly exclude PE in more patients than either test alone. Further studies in a large unselected population are needed to confirm these results. 
Simian immunodeficiency virus (SIVsm) isolation from blood and brain of experimentally infected macaques. The possibility of using simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV)-infected macaques to study pathogenic events linked to HIV infection of the brain prompted us to investigate some of the virological features in SIV-infected macaques. Nine cynomolgus macaques were inoculated with SIVsm and killed at different times. We successfully isolated virus from the blood of all the animals and from the brains of eight. These results point to the early and regular spread of this lentivirus to the brain. Neutralizing activity was studied in the serum and cerebrospinal fluid specimens obtained from these macaques against a selected group of isolates. Cerebrospinal fluid did not show any neutralizing activity. Our findings integrate the observations from HIV-1 infection in man and indicate that SIV infection of macaques is a useful model for studying pathogenic events of brain infection. 
Clinical relevance of tumor cell ploidy and N-myc gene amplification in childhood neuroblastoma: a Pediatric Oncology Group study. We assessed tumor cell DNA content (ploidy) and N-myc gene copy number as predictors of long-term disease-free survival in 298 children with neuroblastoma. Diploid tumor stem lines were identified in 101 patients (34%), clonal hyperdiploid abnormalities in 194 (65%), and hypodiploid stem lines in three (1%). In children with widely disseminated tumors at diagnosis (stage D), ploidy had a highly age-dependent influence on prognosis. Among infants (less than 12 months) treated with cyclophosphamide-doxorubicin, hyperdiploidy was closely associated with long-term disease-free survival (greater than 90% of cases), while diploidy invariably predicted early treatment failure (P less than .001). Similarly, in children 12 to 24 months of age who were treated with cisplatin-teniposide and cyclophosphamide-doxorubicin, diploidy uniformly predicted early failure, whereas half of the children with hyperdiploidy achieved long-term disease-free survival (P less than .001). There was no relationship between ploidy and treatment outcome in children older than 24 months with stage D tumors who had a very low probability of long-term disease-free survival (less than 10%). N-myc gene amplification was detected in 37 (25%) of the 147 tumors tested, with the remainder showing single-copy levels of the gene. N-myc gene amplification was more frequent in diploid than in hyperdiploid tumors (23 of 57 v 14 of 87, P = .001) and predicted a high likelihood of early treatment failure. In children younger than 2 years with disseminated neuroblastoma, tumor cell ploidy and N-myc gene copy number provide complementary prognostic information that will distinguish patients who can be cured on current regimens from those who require new treatment strategies. 
Bradycardic responses to vagally mediated bedside maneuvers in healthy volunteers. PURPOSE: To determine the relative potency in healthy individuals of the vagally mediated reflexes used clinically to inhibit sinoatrial and atrioventricular node function. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: Twenty healthy volunteers with no history of heart disease performed face immersion in cold water and the Valsalva maneuver twice, to maximum endurance and to the subjective point of first discomfort, and face immersion in warm water and the Muller maneuver to maximum endurance only. Right and left carotid massage and left, right, and bilateral eyeball compression were each performed for 15 seconds. Change in heart rate was taken as baseline minus the rate over the slowest three consecutive QRS cycles elicited by each maneuver. Fisher's least-significant-difference multiple comparison procedure was used to analyze heart rate responses. Significance was defined as p less than or equal to 0.05. RESULTS: Maximum pulse decrements from baseline and 95% confidence intervals in beats/minute were as follows: cold-water face immersion to maximum endurance 15.5 (12.3 to 18.5), cold-water face immersion to first discomfort 10.1 (6.7 to 13.1), Valsalva maneuver to maximum endurance 9.2 (6.3 to 12.4), Valsalva maneuver to first discomfort 8.3 (5.0 to 11.3), right carotid massage 7.3 (4.3 to 10.3), left carotid massage 5.2 (2.3 to 8.4), right eyeball compression 6.0 (3.1 to 9.2), left eyeball compression 6.6 (3.6 to 9.5), bilateral eyeball compression 6.0 (3.1 to 9.2), warm-water face immersion 7.0 (3.2 to 9.8), and Muller maneuver 1.6 (-1.3 to 4.9). Bradycardia was significantly greater for cold-water immersion of the face performed to maximum endurance than for all other maneuvers. CONCLUSION: In healthy subjects, the diving reflex is the most potent of the vagally mediated reflexes utilized in clinical practice. Immersion of the face in cold water may prove effective at the bedside when other maneuvers fail to augment vagal tone adequately. 
A human Lactobacillus strain (Lactobacillus casei sp strain GG) promotes recovery from acute diarrhea in children. To determine the effect of a human Lactobacillus strain (Lactobacillus casei sp strain GG, Gefilac) on recovery from acute diarrhea (82% rotavirus), 71 well-nourished children between 4 and 45 months of age were studied. After oral rehydration, the patients randomly received either Lactobacillus GG-fermented milk product, 125 g (10(10-11) colony-forming units) twice daily (group 1); Lactobacillus GG freeze-dried powder, one dose (10(10-11) colony-forming units) twice daily (group 2); or a placebo, a pasteurized yogurt (group 3) 125 g twice daily; each diet was given for 5 days, in addition to normal full diet otherwise free of fermented dairy products. The mean (SD) duration of diarrhea after commencing the therapy was significantly shorter in group 1 (1.4 [0.8] days) and in group 2 (1.4 [0.8] days) than in group 3 (2.4 [1.1] days); F = 8.70, P less than 0.001. After rehydration, each dietary group maintained a positive weight trend. The urinary lactulose-mannitol recovery ratios (means [95% confidence intervals]) on admission were 0.09 (0.03, 0.24) in group 1, 0.12 (0.07, 0.22) in group 2, and 0.08 (0.04, 0.18) in group 3; no significant alterations in intestinal permeability were observed at retesting after 2 days of realimentation. The result indicates that early nutritional repletion after rehydration causes no mucosal disruption and is beneficial for recovery from diarrhea. It is further suggested that Lactobacillus GG in the form of fermented milk or freeze-dried powder is effective in shortening the course of acute diarrhea. 
Comparison of different doses of epinephrine on myocardial perfusion and resuscitation success during cardiopulmonary resuscitation in a pig model. Published results of dose-response effects of adrenergic drugs (epinephrine [E]) vary so much between studies because of differences in animal models and duration of ischemia before drug administration. In this investigation the effects of different doses of E on coronary perfusion pressure (CPP), left ventricular myocardial blood flow (MBF) and resuscitation success were compared during closed-chest cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) after a 4-minute period of ventricular fibrillation in 28 pigs. MBF was measured during normal sinus rhythm using tracer microspheres. After 4 minutes of ventricular fibrillation CPR was performed with the use of a pneumatic piston compressor. After 4 minutes of mechanical measures only, the animals were randomly allocated into four groups of seven, receiving 0.015, 0.030, 0.045, and 0.090 mg/kg E intravenously respectively. MBF measurements were started 45 seconds after E administration; hemodynamic measurements after 90 seconds. Four minutes after the first administration, the same E dose was given before defibrillation. The CPP of animals given 0.015, 0.030, 0.045 and 0.090 mg/kg E were as follows: 16.3 +/- 6.1, 25.6 +/- 5.8, 33.2 +/- 8.4 and 30.4 +/- 6.3 mm Hg. The left ventricular MBF values were: 14 +/- 9, 27 +/- 11, 43 +/- 6, 46 +/- 10 mL/min/100 g. The differences between the groups receiving 0.015 and 0.045 mg/kg and between the groups receiving 0.015 mg/kg and 0.090 mg/kg were statistically significant (P less than .05). Resuscitation success was 14.3%, 42.9%, 100% and 86.7% respectively. A significant difference in resuscitation success was found only between 0.015 mg/kg and 0.045 mg/kg E.
