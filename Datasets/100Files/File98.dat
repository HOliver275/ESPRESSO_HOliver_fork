Otorhinolaryngologic causes of headache. Pain around the face and neck is common. This pain may be referred from a different area. Because patients usually present with pain and discomfort in a specific location such as the ear, nose, face, throat, or neck, this article discusses separately the innervation of each region and the most frequent causes of pain in each of these areas. 
Changes in the characteristics of myocardial infarction patients: 1980 vs 1988. This study examined myocardial infarction cases in an urban community hospital in the years 1980 and 1988. There were 56 well-documented heart attacks in 1980, and 80 in 1988. The sex ratio changed from 43/13 (male/female) in 1980 to 34/46 in 1988 (p = .0001). The percentage of diabetics increased from 27% in 1980 to 44% in 1988 (p = .044). The diabetics were older on average than the nondiabetics (69.7 years vs 65.1 years, p = .017). During the two years, 30 patients died in the hospital. Those who died were, on average, older than the survivors (71.4 years vs 65.4 years, p = .012) and were more likely to be white than black. More women than men died in 1988 (12 out of 13, p = .014), but the overall effect of sex on survival for both years was not significant. These results demonstrate a substantial change in the demographics of myocardial infarctions in the last decade. 
Prognostic significance of the proportion of Ki-67-positive cells in adult T-cell leukemia. The authors examined peripheral blood samples from patients with adult T-cell leukemia (ATL) using the monoclonal antibody Ki-67 which detects a nuclear antigen present in actively proliferating cells. In patients with chronic ATL, the percentage of Ki-67-positive cells was significantly lower than in acute ATL patients (median values, 3.3% versus 18.9%, P less than 0.001). Furthermore, there was a significant inverse correlation between the percentage of Ki-67-positive cells and the length of survival (P less than 0.001). Serum lactic dehydrogenase (LDH) levels also showed a significant inverse correlation with survival, but this was less strong than that for Ki-67 (0.01 less than P less than 0.02). Thus, Ki-67 positivity appears to indicate the aggressiveness of ATL, and can possibly be used for the clinical classification of ATL patients as well as for the prediction of prognosis. 
Serum levels of Hyskon during hysteroscopic procedures. Hyskon hysteroscopy fluid is used with the hysteroscope as an aid in distending the uterine cavity and in visualizing its surfaces. We correlated the amount of Hyskon used during hysteroscopy with both the instillation pressures generated within the uterine cavity and with serum levels of Hyskon in 11 healthy subjects. Serum levels in excess of 1000 mg% were measured at 30 min when an amount of Hyskon greater than 300 mL was used. Intrauterine Hyskon absorption and/or injection during hysteroscopy were found even after volumes of Hyskon as small as 50-100 mL were used. Serum levels were significantly higher with the larger amounts of Hyskon used in ablative procedures (P less than 0.01), as compared with serum levels seen with the smaller amounts of Hyskon used for diagnostic procedures. The injection pressures should be low to minimize the amount of intravascular injection. In cases in which extensive ablative procedures are necessary, we suggest that a two-stage procedure be considered. Because of the hypertonicity of Hyskon, intravascular volume expansion that may be larger than that seen during transurethral prostatectomy occurs. 
Sarcomas of soft tissue and bone. Sarcomas arise primarily from mesenchymal structures at any site in the body, even within visceral stroma and neurovascular bundles. Sarcomas have been associated with prior radiation therapy, toxic exposures, and genetic conditions and soft tissue sarcomas have been distinguished from bone sarcomas. For localized soft tissue sarcoma, tumor grade is the most important prognostic variable. Low-grade tumors are generally cured by wide surgical excision, but there is a significant rate of both local recurrence and development of distant metastasis in high-grade lesions. The treatment of soft tissue sarcoma histologic subtypes is generally similar grade-for-grade, with the exception of rhabomyosarcoma, Kaposi's sarcoma, and mesothelioma. Tumor location strongly influences resectability. Radiation therapy has been used successfully in conjunction with conservative surgery to improve local control rates for soft tissue sarcomas, particularly in extremity lesions. Currently, adjuvant chemotherapy remains unproven for most adult soft tissue sarcomas, but is established in the treatment of rhabdomyosarcomas, osteosarcomas, and Ewing's sarcomas. 
Objective antitumor activity of acivicin in patients with recurrent CNS malignancies: a Southwest Oncology Group trial. Acivicin (AT-125) is a glutamine antagonist with dose-limiting, schedule-dependent CNS toxicity and predictable CSF penetration after intravenous administration. Because of these properties, a trial in CNS malignancies was initiated. Thirty-two patients with recurrent or residual malignant astrocytomas were treated with AT-125. The majority of patients had glioblastoma multiforme (24) and had received prior nitrosoureas (21). The median age was 50 years, and Southwest Oncology Group (SWOG) performance status was 2. The major determinant of response was based upon radiologic criteria using computed tomographic (CT) scanning and/or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans. The tumor mass was measured in two perpendicular planes, which yielded the largest cross-sectional area. Standard solid tumor criteria for response were used. All responding patients also had a stable or tapered dose of corticosteroids with stable or improved performance status and neurologic examination. There were four objective responses (12%): one complete remission (3 1/2+ years) and three partial remissions (57, 86, and 322 days). Two patients had improvement in disease that did not meet requirements for a partial remission. Toxicity was mild and primarily consisted of nausea, vomiting, and lethargy. Two patients were removed from study due to neurotoxicity (depression and hallucinations). The strict response criteria used in this trial were not those that have been used in testing other active agents such as carmustine (BCNU). We conclude that AT-125 has objective antitumor activity in malignant astrocytomas and warrants further study. 
Irresectable hepatoma treated by intrahepatic iodized oil doxorubicin hydrochloride: initial results. In this study we describe the investigation and treatment of 14 patients with primary hepatocellular carcinoma. Patients were treated with intra-arterial infusion of iodized oil and doxorubicin hydrochloride. Five of these patients were alive after 1 year. Twelve patients showed a fall in alpha-fetoprotein, and in seven of these patients, the fall in alpha-fetoprotein was greater than 50%. 
Eye movement behaviour of patients with cerebral microangiopathy and macroangiopathy in simple visual detection tasks. Patients with cerebral microangiopathy (n = 17), acute and chronic left hemisphere (LH) stroke (n = 18, n = 21) and normal controls (n = 41) were studied in 2 simple visual detection tasks, one with predictable, the other with unpredictable targets. Eye movements were registered by means of infrared light reflections (pupil-corneal reflection method); the points of visual fixation were continuously calculated by a microprocessor system. Patients with cerebral microangiopathy showed primarily difficulties in holding attention, as reflected by pathologically short durations of gaze on target, frequent unsuccessful anticipations and a high overall number of fixations. In contrast, acute LH stroke patients were characterized by a deficit in shifting attention, as reflected by prolonged latencies and long search durations due to many intervening search fixations. By means of a nonparametric discriminant analysis procedure, about 90% of patients with microangiopathy and about 80% of acute LH stroke patients were reliably distinguished from normal controls. The differences between these two patient groups were most pronounced in the simpler task with predictable targets. Among those patients discriminated from normals, about 96% were correctly reclassified as belonging either to the microangiopathy or to the acute LH stroke group on the basis of their abnormal eye movement variables alone. 
Endogenous prostaglandin endoperoxides and prostacyclin modulate the thrombolytic activity of tissue plasminogen activator. Effects of simultaneous inhibition of thromboxane A2 synthase and blockade of thromboxane A2/prostaglandin H2 receptors in a canine model of coronary thrombosis. We tested the hypothesis that simultaneous inhibition of TxA2 synthase and blockade of TxA2/PHG2 receptors is more effective in enhancing thrombolysis and preventing reocclusion after discontinuation of tissue plasminogen activator (t-PA) than either intervention alone. Coronary thrombosis was induced in 35 dogs by placing a copper coil into the left anterior descending coronary artery. Coronary flow was measured with a Doppler flow probe. 30 min after thrombus formation, the animals received saline (controls, n = 10); SQ 29548 (0.4 mg/kg bolus + 0.4 mg/kg per h infusion), a TxA2/PGH2 receptor antagonist (n = 8); dazoxiben (5 mg/kg bolus + 5 mg/kg per h infusion), a TxA2 synthase inhibitor (n = 9); or R 68070 (5 mg/kg bolus + 5 mg/kg per h infusion), a drug that blocks TxA2/PGH2 receptors and inhibits TxA2 synthase (n = 8). Then, all dogs received heparin (200 U/kg) and a bolus of t-PA (80 micrograms/kg) followed by a continuous infusion (8 micrograms/kg per min) for up to 90 min or until reperfusion was achieved. The time to thrombolysis did not change significantly in SQ 29548-treated dogs as compared with controls (42 +/- 5 vs. 56 +/- 7 min, respectively, P = NS), but it was significantly shortened by R 68070 and dazoxiben (11 +/- 2 and 25 +/- 6 min, respectively, P less than 0.001 vs. controls and SQ 29548-treated dogs). R 68070 administration resulted in a lysis time significantly shorter than that observed in the dazoxiben-treated group (P less than 0.01). Reocclusion was observed in eight of eight control dogs, five of seven SQ 29548-treated dogs, seven of nine dazoxiben-treated dogs, and zero of eight R 68070-treated animals (P less than 0.001). TxB2 and 6-keto-PGF1 alpha, measured in blood samples obtained from the coronary artery distal to the thrombus, were significantly increased at reperfusion and at reocclusion in control animals and in dogs receiving SQ 29548. R 68070 and dazoxiben prevented the increase in plasma TxB2 levels, whereas 6-keto-PGF1 alpha levels were significantly increased with respect to control and SQ 29548-treated dogs. Thus, simultaneous inhibition of TxA2 synthase and blockade of TxA2/PGH2 receptors is more effective than either intervention alone in this experimental model in enhancing thrombolysis and preventing reocclusion after t-PA administration. 
Systemic hypertension alters vasomotor function in experimental vein grafts. Hypertension is an established risk factor for atherosclerosis, a disease that is important in the pathophysiology of vein graft failure. Hypertension can also alter arterial vasoreactivity. The vasomotor function and histologic characteristics of autogenous vein grafts in hypertensive rabbits were assessed in this study. Hypertension was induced in 13 male New Zealand white rabbits by use of the Goldblatt one clip two kidney method. The right carotid artery was divided and bypassed with the reversed right external jugular vein 7 days later in these animals and in 13 normotensive controls. Blood pressure and renal function were assessed serially, and all the grafts were harvested after 28 days. Three grafts in each group were examined by light microscopy. The responses of the remaining grafts to norepinephrine, histamine, serotonin, and angiotensin II were determined in vitro under isometric tension. Endothelium-dependent relaxation to acetylcholine and calcium ionophore (A23187) was assessed in precontracted grafts. The mean arterial pressure was significantly increased after the Goldblatt procedure was performed. Intimal hyperplasia was observed in both groups, but the grafts in the hypertensive groups showed increased adventitial and medial fibrosis and a reduced number of vasa vasora. The grafts in the hypertensive rabbits were hypersensitive to all agonists as indicated by a significant reduction in their median effective dose values, and their maximal responses to all agonists were also significantly reduced. No graft relaxed in response to acetylcholine, and whereas precontracted grafts in normotensive rabbits had a maximal relaxation of 24% +/- 6% of precontraction with A23187, this was absent in the grafts in the hypertensive rabbits. The results suggest that angiotensin-induced hypertension may adversely affect vein graft patency by inducing hypersensitivity to physiologically important agonists and reducing the effect of receptor-independent endothelium-derived relaxation on vasomotor tone. 
Early experience with low speed rotational angioplasty. OBJECTIVE--Preliminary assessment of the efficacy and safety of the low speed rotational angioplasty catheter system (ROTACS). DESIGN--Open prospective trial. SETTING--Department of cardiology in a teaching hospital. PATIENTS--Eleven patients (10 with chronic stable angina and one with acute coronary occlusion after conventional angioplasty) in whom a coronary angiogram showed occlusion or critical stenosis of the coronary artery (right in seven patients, circumflex in two, and left anterior descending in two). The nature or severity of the lesion ruled out conventional coronary angioplasty. INTERVENTIONS--An attempt was made to cross the lesion with a rotating guide wire with a blunt swelling at its tip. Where necessary progress was assessed by simultaneous injection of contrast into both main coronary arteries. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES--Progress of the ROTACS through the lesion that allowed a guide wire to pass into the distal vessel was regarded as a device specific success. When a guide wire crossed the lesion aided only by the support of the ROTACS without the use of rotation this was counted as a success that was not device specific. Failure to cross the lesion and any associated complications were noted. RESULTS--The ROTACS crossed only two of the 10 chronic lesions (20% device specific success rate); however, the support it provided enabled a guide wire to cross a further two lesions and allowed subsequent successful angioplasty in four of the 10 patients. One of these four patients presented after five months with recurrent angina requiring bypass grafting. The other three were symptom free at follow up seven months after the procedure. In the one patient with acute coronary occlusion the ROTACS was advanced over the guide wire to allow passage of an angioplasty balloon where this had previously proved impossible. An excellent final result was obtained and this patient remains symptom free. Three of the six patients in whom the ROTACS was unsuccessful had coronary artery dissection without sequelae. Three patients required subsequent elective coronary bypass grafting for control of symptoms while the other three remain well on medical treatment. CONCLUSIONS--The ROTACS may extend the range of patients with coronary artery occlusion or critical stenosis who can be treated non-surgically. The low device specific success rate (20%) achieved in this study indicates that it should be compared with other simpler mechanical devices that may be just as effective. 
Management of infected aortoiliac aneurysms. A 30-year retrospective review identified 13 patients treated for infected aneurysms of the abdominal aorta or iliac arteries, for an overall incidence of 0.65%. A constellation of clinical findings led to the correct preoperative diagnosis in 11 (85%) of 13 patients. Treatment methods included resection and in situ replacement grafting in seven patients, resection and extra-anatomic bypass in five patients, and resection-ligation in one patient. Four (31%) of 13 patients died within 30 days of operation, three of whom died of rupture. Overall, good results were achieved in five patients (38%), while poor results were noted in the remaining eight patients (62%). The determinants of outcome were aneurysm location or rupture, the presence of established infection, and the virulence of the infecting organism. In 10 (77%) of the 13 aneurysms, Salmonella species, Bacteroides fragilis, Staphylococcus aureus, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa accounted for all deaths, ruptures, and suprarenal aneurysm infections. These data suggest that patients with primary infections of the abdominal aorta or iliac arteries continue to present with advanced infections or aneurysm rupture that result in a high mortality. 
Takayasu's disease and atherosclerosis. The aortic arch syndrome characterised by diminished or absent pulses in the arteries arising from the aortic arch has many etiologies, such as syphilitic aortitis, dissection of the aorta, atherosclerosis and Takayasu's arteritis. The diagnostic criteria of Takayasu's arteritis often do not mention histological investigations. We observed a case of an aortic arch syndrome, presenting as a classical case of Takayasu's arteritis but caused by a severe form of atherosclerosis. 
Marginal ulcer following gastric bypass for morbid obesity. Four hundred twelve patients underwent gastric bypass for treatment of morbid obesity between 1981 and 1985 at the University of Florida Affiliated Hospitals. Thirty-four patients (8.2%) developed marginal ulcers, considerably higher than the 0-3 per cent ulcer occurrence commonly reported in the literature. Factors predisposing to ulcer formation include: (1) a large gastric pouch; (2) a vertically oriented pouch; and (3) staple-line dehiscence. Twenty-two of 34 patients (65%) with symptomatic marginal ulcers were noted to have staple-line disruption. Twenty-one of these patients (95%) eventually required operative therapy for their ulcers compared with four of 12 patients (33%) with an intact gastric staple line. Surgical therapy consisted of takedown of the Roux-en-Y limb with resection of the ulcer and gastrogastrostomy. Staple-line dehiscence is a significant etiologic factor in the development of marginal ulcer following gastric bypass and when present constitutes an indication for reoperation. 
Valve extension with glutaraldehyde-preserved autologous pericardium. Results in mitral valve repair. Preliminary experimental studies in our laboratory have shown that autologous pericardium treated with glutaraldehyde prevents late deterioration and calcification of the tissue. For this reason, glutaraldehyde-treated autologous pericardium has been used in a series of 64 patients who underwent operations for leaflet extension of the mitral valve between 1980 and 1989. Ages ranged from 2.5 to 60 years (mean 19 +/- 15). The causes of mitral valve insufficiency were rheumatic fever (69%), bacterial endocarditis (17%), congenital (8%), endomyocardial fibrosis (4.5%), and trauma (1.5%). The autologous tissue was fixed in a 0.62% glutaraldehyde solution for 15 minutes and rinsed in saline for an additional 15 minutes. Patching techniques varied depending on the site and the extent of the lesion. Associated mitral valve repair techniques (Carpentier's techniques) were mandatory in all patients. The period of follow-up extended from 6 months to 9 years (mean 3.1 +/- 2.5 years). There were no operative deaths in this series, and there was one late death (2%). In the six patients (12%) who underwent reoperation, there has been no case of calcification of the pericardial patch. Postoperative mitral valve function was assessed by bidimensional color Doppler echocardiographic techniques. Mitral valve insufficiency was trivial or absent in 80% of the patients. This experience permits us to conclude that leaflet extension is a simple and safe technique in valve reconstruction, allowing repair of mitral valves that otherwise would need to be replaced. It permits use of an adult-size prosthetic ring in children. Glutaraldehyde-treated autologous pericardium is the material of choice for this type of repair. 
Inhibition of prostaglandin synthesis fails to prevent gallbladder mucin hypersecretion in the cholesterol-fed prairie dog Gallstone formation in the cholesterol-fed prairie dog is preceded by an increase in mucin secretion by the gallbladder epithelium, and mucin hypersecretion is believed to promote cholesterol gallstone formation by accelerating the nucleation of cholesterol monohydrate crystals. Some studies have suggested that gallbladder mucin hypersecretion is mediated by increases in gallbladder prostaglandin synthesis, but other observations are difficult to reconcile with this view. An organ culture technique was used to measure mucin secretion in normal prairie dog gallbladder in response to exogenous prostaglandins and agents that increased or decreased endogenous prostaglandin production. Incubation with indomethacin produced a concentration-dependent inhibition of endogenous prostaglandin synthesis with virtually complete inhibition at 10(-5) mol/L indomethacin. However, indomethacin had no effect on gallbladder mucin secretion at concentrations as high as 10(-5) mol/L, and significant inhibition of mucin secretion was only found at 10(-4) mol/L indomethacin, a concentration that also produced a significant increase in lactate dehydrogenase release from cultured explants. Incubation of gallbladder explants with the calcium ionophore A23187 significantly stimulated endogenous prostaglandin synthesis in a concentration-dependent manner, increasing synthesis of prostaglandins E and F to as much as 278% +/- 20% and 335% +/- 21% of basal values, respectively; however, the same concentrations of A23187 did not stimulate mucin secretion. Incubation of gallbladder explants in the presence of exogenous prostaglandin E2 or prostaglandin F2a in concentrations as high as 10(-6) mol/L also did not stimulate mucin secretion. Prairie dogs fed a lithogenic 1.2% cholesterol diet showed a significant increase in gallbladder mucin secretion after 1 week (117.5 +/- 10.2% of control, P less than 0.05), and 4 of 5 had formed cholesterol monohydrate crystals after 3 weeks. Long-term treatment with indomethacin, 1.2 mg.kg-1.day-1, failed to inhibit gallbladder mucin hypersecretion (129.2 +/- 10.7% of control after 1 week) or cholesterol monohydrate crystal formation (3/5) in cholesterol-fed prairie dogs. Furthermore, incubation of explants with 10(-5) mol/L indomethacin failed to prevent in vitro mucin hypersecretion in cholesterol-fed animals. These findings suggest that prostaglandins do not regulate gallbladder mucin secretion in the prairie dog, and it is unlikely that increases in gallbladder prostaglandin synthesis are responsible for mediating gallbladder mucin hypersecretion during cholelithiasis in the prairie dog. 
Types of posterior capsular breaks and their surgical implications. We studied the pathogenesis, clinical features, and management of posterior capsular breaks in 28 cataract patients during planned extracapsular cataract extraction and intraocular lens implantation surgery. In the age-related cataract group (17 cases), the posterior capsular breaks were fresh, caused by the irrigation-aspiration cannula. Located in the upper part of the posterior capsule, they had thin margins and tended to enlarge with continued irrigation. Nine (52.9%) of these breaks could be plugged with viscoelastic, and after dry aspiration, a posterior chamber lens was implanted successfully. Posterior capsular breaks in traumatic cataracts (11 cases) were preexisting but were detected only during surgery. Centrally located, they had thick fibrosed margins and remained the same size during irrigation- aspiration. The minimal vitreous herniation seen in four (35.3%) of these cases was managed by automated partial anterior vitrectomy through the break. A posterior chamber intraocular lens was implanted in all these cases. 
The protective role of eicosapentaenoic acid [EPA] in the pathogenesis of nephrolithiasis. The low incidence of atherosclerosis and other degenerative diseases including stone disease in the Greenland Eskimo has been attributed to their high consumption of oily fish with its high concentration of eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA). Man cannot synthesis EPA from the precursor essential fatty acid, linolenic acid, and can only assimilate preformed EPA present in fish and fish oil, to bring about a change in the pathway of eicosanoid metabolism from the n-6 to the n-3 series. With a westernised diet the oxygenated products of renal prostaglandin synthesis are metabolites of the n-6 series and these are known to play an important role in several pathophysiological states including stone disease. Our previous studies have shown a relationship between prostaglandin activity and urinary calcium excretion and it would seem that the initiating factor/s for stone formation trigger the mechanisms for prostaglandin synthesis resulting in the biochemical abnormalities associated with stone disease. The Eskimo may be protected from these events by possession of an eicosanoid metabolism that follows an n-3 pathway. To test this hypothesis experiments were performed using an animal model of nephrocalcinosis. The animals were divided into three groups; one group was given an intra-peritoneal injection of 10% calcium gluconate daily for 10 days to induce nephrocalcinosis; a second group was fed MaxEPA fish oil before and during the calcium gluconate injections and a third group only received an intra-peritoneal injection of N saline. A group of 12 recurrent, hypercalciuric/hyperoxaluric stone-formers were treated with fish oil for eight weeks to study the effects on solute excretion. Nephrocalcinosis, which was readily produced in the control animals, was prevented in the experimental animals by pre-treatment with fish oil and urine calcium excretion was significantly reduced. The urinary calcium and oxalate excretion in the recurrent, hypercalciuric stone-formers was significantly reduced with fish oil treatment over an eight week period. There were no untoward side-effects. These studies indicate that the incorporation of EPA in the diet as a substitute metabolic pathway could be a unique way of correcting the biochemical abnormalities of idiopathic urolithiasis. 
Acute atherosis in pregnancies complicated by hypertension, small-for-gestational-age infants, and diabetes mellitus. A clinicohistologic study of acute atherosis in late complicated pregnancy was undertaken. Maternal vessels in the placental basal plate, underlying the amniochorial membranes and in placental bed biopsy specimens, were examined histologically. The earliest histologically convincing lesion acceptable as acute atherosis was fibrinoid necrosis with a perivascular mononuclear cell infiltrate, while lipophages were a late phenomenon. Any maternal uterine vessel that had not undergone physiologic vascular changes could be affected by acute atherosis. Acute atherosis was not seen in normal pregnancies or in pregnancies of diabetic women but was seen in pregnancies complicated by preeclampsia, small-for-gestational-age infants, or both. In pregnancies complicated by small-for-gestational-age infants, acute atherosis was not seen in the vessels in the decidua parietalis. 
Comparison of computerized tomography and magnetic resonance imaging for the postoperative assessment of residual acoustic tumor. Ten patients with surgically confirmed residual cerebellopontine angle neuromas, imaged by both computerized tomography (CT) with iodine contrast and magnetic resonance (MR) with and without gadolinium enhancement, are reviewed to identify the strengths and limitations of MR as compared with CT imaging. MR imaging offers superior anatomic resolution in multiple imaging planes without ionizing radiation, but it is expensive and has adverse effects on some patients. CT imaging offers good anatomic resolution, but in only one or two planes. CT is both less expensive and generally well tolerated, but allergy to the iodine contrast is not uncommon. The cases presented demonstrate the adequacy of CT imaging of residual tumor. However, in some cases MR imaging provided important additional detail. MR imaging also demonstrated postoperative changes within the brain stem and cerebellum. In our experience, CT imaging remains a satisfactory, unambiguous approach to the assessment of known postoperative residual cerebellopontine angle neuromas. MR imaging provides superior resolution, however, and should be used when better definition of tumor detail is needed for management decisions or when multiple follow-up scans are anticipated, so that the exposure to ionizing radiation is limited. MR is also useful to investigate postoperative neurologic dysfunction. Postoperative changes and residual tumors are more difficult to interpret on MR than on CT. Guidelines are proposed to help distinguish residual tumor from postoperative changes and scarring. 
Biased estimates of expected acute myocardial infarction mortality using MedisGroups admission severity groups This study examines whether the MedisGroups admission severity groups give unbiased estimates of 30-day mortality in 3037 Medicare-aged patients who were hospitalized in 1985 through 1986 with acute myocardial infarction. The average observed death rate for all acute myocardial infarction patients in the study who were in a given admission severity group was used to estimate the expected death probability for each case in a given group. (This is the same method used by the Pennsylvania Health Care Cost Containment Council for risk adjusting hospital mortality by diagnosis related groups in that state.) When compared with observed deaths, estimates of expected mortality were significantly biased for many patient attributes (eg, age, location of acute myocardial infarction, history of congestive heart failure, serum potassium level, serum urea nitrogen level, pulse rate, and blood pressure). These results are consistent with a conclusion that the MedisGroups scoring algorithm omits some important risk variables, inappropriately includes some other variables reflecting postadmission status, and gives the wrong weights to some appropriate risk variables. To the extent that these findings are also applicable to current MedisGroups scoring algorithms and to other conditions and procedures, MedisGroups admission severity groups cannot fairly adjust for interhospital case mix differences in outcome studies. 
Argyrophilic nucleolar organizer regions and alpha-fetoprotein in adenomatous hyperplasia in human cirrhotic livers. Recently, adenomatous hyperplasia (AH) of the liver has been suspected as a precancerous lesion in human hepatocarcinogenesis. The authors examined 75 cases of AH from 42 cirrhotic livers, using staining of argyrophilic nucleolar organizer regions (AgNORs). These reflect proliferative cell activity. Findings in AH were compared with those seen in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and other chronic liver diseases. Expression of alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) was also examined immunohistochemically. The authors classified AH into three types: ordinary (OAH), atypical (AAH), and AH with focal malignancy (FM). OAH implies a lack of atypia; AAH represents AH with structural and cellular atypia but without the features of overt carcinoma; and FM denotes AH with foci of overt HCC. Forty of the 75 cases of AH were categorized as OAH, 19 as AAH, and 16 as FM. The noncancerous areas of FM had features of AAH. The mean number of AgNORs in AH was intermediate between that seen in cirrhosis (2.93) and HCC (6.18) and showed a step-wise increase in the following order: OAH (2.95), AAH (3.89), noncancerous areas in FM (4.58), and malignant foci in FM (5.71). There was no significant difference in AgNOR counts between OAH and cirrhosis. AgNOR counts in AAH and FM were significantly higher than those of OAH, and lower than those of HCC. AFP was positive in 12 of 25 HCCs and in malignant foci of 3 FM lesions, but it was absent in OAH and AAH. These data suggest that OAH has a limited capacity for proliferation but that AAH and FM are much more replicative. The latter two conditions are probably preneoplastic lesions or early forms of HCC. 
Congestive heart failure secondary to an arteriovenous fistula from cardiac catheterization and angioplasty. Arteriovenous (AV) fistulae are well known to cause high output cardiac failure. AV fistulae from cardiac catheterization are as rare as 0.01% in the transfemoral approach. We describe here what we believe is the first reported case of high output cardiac failure from an AV fistula due to percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA). The patient had reversal of the congestive heart failure with surgical correction of the fistula. 
Stroke in patients treated with thrombolytic therapy for acute myocardial infarction. The thrombosis in myocardial infarction clinical trial and a review of placebo-controlled trials. The frequency of stroke among patients in six recent placebo-controlled trials of thrombolytic therapy for acute myocardial infarction is reviewed. Three trials used streptokinase and three used tissue plasminogen activator as the thrombolytic agent. While thrombolytic therapy greatly reduces the morbidity and mortality of acute myocardial infarction, it increases the rate of intracerebral hemorrhage. 
A phase IA trial of sequential administration recombinant DNA-produced interferons: combination recombinant interferon gamma and recombinant interferon alfa in patients with metastatic renal cell carcinoma. This study investigated the effects of sequentially administered recombinant interferon gamma (rIFN gamma) and recombinant interferon alfa (rIFN alpha) in 36 patients with metastatic renal cell carcinoma (RCC). rIFN alpha was subcutaneously administered daily for 70 days at dosages that varied (2.5, 5, 10, and 20 x 10(6) U/m2) across four cohorts of patients. Within each cohort of patients receiving a given dose of rIFN alpha, three subsets of patients received either 30, 300, or 1,000 micrograms/m2 rIFN gamma. rIFN gamma was administered intravenously for 5 days every third week, 6 hours prior to administration of rIFN alpha. Dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) included constitutional symptoms, leukopenia, nephrotic syndrome with acute renal failure, hypotension associated with death, and congestive heart failure. DLT was related more often to the rIFN alpha dose level than to rIFN gamma dose level. Maximum-tolerated dose (MTD) was 10 x 10(6) U/m2 rIFN alpha and 1,000 micrograms/m2 rIFN gamma. Six patients failed to complete a minimum of 21 days of therapy due to toxicity or rapid progression of disease. Clinical responses were seen in eight of 30 assessable patients. Two patients experienced complete remission and have remained in complete remission 20+ and 22+ months. An additional six patients have shown partial responses for 4 to 18+ months. One patient in partial remission continues to show slow regression of pulmonary and liver lesions off therapy with rIFNs. Clinical responses have remained durable for patients with complete remissions and patients with partial remissions. The results of this study suggest that toxicities associated with combination rIFN therapy can be reduced by administering these agents sequentially as opposed to simultaneously. 
Cytoreduction and sequential resection: a hope for unresectable primary liver cancer. For decades, unresectable primary liver cancer (PLC) determined by operation was incurable. However, a retrospective study of 24 years' materials with unresectable PLC indicated that 5-year survival of unresectable PLC has increased from 0% in 1966-1977 (n = 137) to 16.9% in 1978-1989 (n = 345). This encouraging improvement was mainly a result of cytoreduction therapy followed by sequential resection. Multimodality combination treatment with hepatic artery ligation, plus hepatic artery infusion with chemotherapy, plus radioimmunotherapy (or radiotherapy) yielded the highest sequential resection rate (30.6%) and 5-year survival (28.0%) as compared with double combination and single modality treatment. The 5-year survival of 33 patients receiving sequential resection after cytoreduction therapy was 63.2%. It is suggested that cytoreduction and sequential resection might offer a hope for surgically verified unresectable PLC. 
Intracranial aneurysms in sickle-cell anemia: clinical features and pathogenesis. Intracranial aneurysms are an unusual complication of sickle-cell anemia; only 15 patients have been described in the world literature. An additional 15 patients with sickle-cell anemia and subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) from ruptured intracranial aneurysms are presented. There was a high incidence of multiple aneurysms (60%); some of which were in unusual locations. The clinical and pathological features of this series of patients have provided a paradigm for acquired aneurysm formation that may be applicable to other intracranial aneurysms. Thirteen patients underwent craniotomy and clip ligation; the perioperative management of these patients is discussed. Of these 13, eight had a good recovery, three were left with moderate disability, one patient died of surgical complications, and one died of complications related to sickle-cell anemia. Two of the 15 patients died of SAH. The authors propose that endothelial injury from the abnormal adherence of sickle erythrocytes to the endothelium is the initiating event in arterial wall injury. Subsequently, there is fragmentation of the internal elastic lamina and degeneration of the smooth-muscle layer. Hemodynamic stress at these loci of arterial wall damage results in aneurysm formation. This hypothesis also explains other cerebrovascular manifestations of sickle-cell anemia, namely vaso-occlusive disease and hemorrhage without aneurysm formation. Pathological material from this series and data from the literature are presented to support this hypothesis. 
Vitamin B6 is effective therapy for nausea and vomiting of pregnancy: a randomized, double-blind placebo-controlled study. Fifty-nine women completed a randomized, double-blind placebo-controlled study of pyridoxine hydrochloride (vitamin B6) for the treatment of nausea and vomiting of pregnancy. Thirty-one patients received vitamin B6, 25-mg tablets orally every 8 hours for 72 hours, and 28 patients received placebo in the same regimen. Patients were categorized according to the presence of vomiting: severe nausea (score greater than 7) or mild to moderate nausea (score of 7 or less). The severity of nausea (as graded on a visual analogue scale of 1-10 cm) and the number of patients with vomiting over a 72-hour period were used to evaluate response to therapy. Twelve of 31 patients in the vitamin B6 group had a pre-treatment nausea score greater than 7 (severe) (mean 8.2 +/- 0.8), as did ten of 28 patients in the placebo group (mean 8.7 +/- 0.9) (not significant). Following therapy, there was a significant difference in the mean "difference in nausea" score (ie, baseline - post-therapy nausea) between patients with severe nausea receiving vitamin B6 (mean 4.3 +/- 2.1) and placebo (mean 1.8 +/- 2.2) (P less than .01). In patients with mild to moderate nausea and in the group as a whole, no significant difference between treatment and placebo was observed. Fifteen of 31 vitamin B6-treated patients had vomiting before therapy, compared with ten of 28 in the placebo group (not significant). At the completion of 3 days of therapy, only eight of 31 patients in the vitamin B6 group had any vomiting, compared with 15 of 28 patients in the placebo group (P less than .05). 
Results of surgery for extratemporal partial epilepsy that began in childhood. Thirty-five consecutive patients who underwent surgery for intractable extratemporal seizures originating in childhood are described. Candidates for surgery were selected on the basis of clinical criteria, neurodiagnostic imaging, and an electroencephalographic investigation that included the use of sphenoidal electrodes and long-term monitoring. Invasive preoperative monitoring was not used. Our results, with respect to the control of seizures and behavioral improvement, are comparable with series in which data from invasive recordings were used in the selection process. Sixty-three percent of the 35 patients (76.5% of those operated on after the introduction of long-term electroencephalographic monitoring) became either seizure free or experienced a reduction in their frequency of seizures by at least 75%. The favorable outcome in this group of patients strengthens the argument for early operation in children with intractable epilepsy, even when the seizure focus is outside the temporal lobe. 
Visual acuity in infants after vitrectomy for severe retinopathy of prematurity [published erratum apppears in Ophthalmology 1991 Jul;98(7):1005] During the course of the Multicenter Trial of Cryotherapy for Retinopathy of Prematurity (CRYO-ROP), 98 infants (129 eyes) from the randomized segment of the trial developed total retinal detachment from retinopathy of prematurity (ROP) before the 1-year examination. The authors report as a case series the results of acuity card assessment of monocular grating acuity at 1 year in 53 infants (71 eyes) postvitrectomy and in 45 infants (58 eyes) who had retinal detachments but who did not undergo retinal reattachment surgery. The decision to undertake and the surgical technique used for a retinal reattachment procedure was not part of the randomized CRYO-ROP trial. Two eyes of one infant had pattern vision at the lowest measurable threshold after vitrectomy. None of the remaining eyes that had undergone vitrectomy and none of the eyes that did not undergo vitrectomy showed evidence of pattern vision. The relatively poor visual outcomes in this case series suggest that efforts are well-spent in attempting to prevent retinal detachment in ROP. 
Human T-lymphotropic virus type 1-associated myelopathy and primary sclerosing cholangitis. We report the first case of human T-lymphotropic type 1-associated myelopathy (HAM) linked with primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC). The patient, a 44-year-old woman, also suffered from ulcerative colitis and polyarthritis. Two years and nine months after the clinical onset of PSC, the coexistence of HAM was shown by neurological manifestations characterized by slowly progressive symmetrical myelopathy, predominantly involving pyramidal tracts, and positive antibodies to human T-lymphotropic virus type 1 in serum as well as in cerebrospinal fluid. 
Operative management of acoustic neuromas: the priority of neurologic function over complete resection. The objective of surgical management of acoustic tumors is to remove them entirely and preserve facial nerve function and hearing when possible. A dilemma arises when it is not possible to remove the entire tumor without incurring additional neurologic deficits. Twenty patients who underwent intentional incomplete surgical removal of an acoustic neuroma to avoid further neurologic deficit were retrospectively reviewed. They were divided into a subtotal group (resection of less than 95% of tumor) and a near-total group (resection of 95% or more of tumor) and were followed yearly with either computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging. The subtotal group was planned and consisted of elderly patients (mean age, 68.5 years) with large tumors (mean, 3.1 cm). The near-total group consisted of younger patients (mean age, 45.8 years) and smaller tumors (mean, 2.3 cm). The mean length of followup for all patients was 5.0 years. Ninety percent of patients had House grade I or II facial function post-operatively. Radiologically detectable tumor regrowth occurred in only one patient, who was in the subtotal resection group. Near-total resection of acoustic tumor was not associated with radiologic evidence of regrowth of tumor for the period of observation. Within the limits of the follow-up period of this study, subtotal resection of acoustic neuroma in elderly patients was not associated with clinically significant recurrence in most patients and produced highly satisfactory rates of facial preservation with low surgical morbidity. 
Hemodynamic responses to endotracheal extubation after coronary artery bypass grafting. After coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) surgery, patients may remain at risk for myocardial ischemia and infarction and ventricular dysrhythmias. The hemodynamic responses to endotracheal extubation and the efficacy of intravenous lidocaine pretreatment were studied after CABG surgery and overnight mechanical ventilation. Twenty-five patients were divided into two groups: group 1 (n = 13) patients who had tracheal extubation after pretreatment with a placebo; group 2 patients who received lidocaine (1 mg/kg IV) before tracheal extubation. Hemodynamic data, electrocardiographic tracings, and arterial blood gases were obtained before tracheal extubation, during suctioning, and 1, 5, and 20 min after tracheal extubation. Group 1 patients displayed significant increases in heart rate, arterial blood pressure, rate-pressure product, right atrial pressure, and cardiac index during suctioning and within 1 min of tracheal extubation, returning to preextubation level by 5 min. There were no significant changes in pulmonary and systemic resistance indices. Hemodynamic changes in group 2 patients were similar to those in group 1. Both in the absence and presence of lidocaine, tracheal extubation caused hemodynamic responses that were small in magnitude and brief in duration. These responses were not associated with electrocardiographic or enzymatic evidence of myocardial ischemia or infarction, or with ventricular dysrhythmias. Compared with the well-documented hemodynamic responses to tracheal intubation, we found that extubation of the trachea after CABG surgery was associated with less pronounced responses. This may be related to avoidance of laryngoscopy and possibly accommodation to the endo-tracheal tube. These modest hemodynamic responses of extubation of the trachea after CABG surgery were not modified by intravenous lidocaine. 
The effect of positive reinforcement on hourly compliance in nasal continuous positive airway pressure users with obstructive sleep apnea. Previous reports have described compliance with nasal continuous positive airway pressure (nCPAP) for the treatment of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) only in terms of the number of patients able to use it beyond their initial trial night or those continuing after some home use. Because of a possible difference between the level of compliance (mean number of hours of use per 24 h) needed for symptomatic relief of OSA versus cardiovascular improvement, the level of hourly compliance in chronic nCPAP users may be important. The first part of this study prospectively examines compliance in a stable population of OSA patients already using nCPAP for 6 months to 2 yr. The second part is a prospective randomized, crossover study examining the effect of weekly (three times) then monthly (twice) positive reinforcement on hourly compliance of new nCPAP users for 3 months versus no reinforcement for 3 months. Positive reinforcement consisted of telephone discussions with the patients about the severity or complications of OSA, benefits of nCPAP, and suggestions about minimizing side effects. Using self-assessment scales, each patient reported the perceived level of improvement from the untreated to the treated condition and the prevalence and severity of side effects from the nCPAP therapy. The level of compliance in stable, chronic nCPAP users with OSA was 6.1 +/- 2.2 h/24 h (n = 9). For the new nCPAP users during the nonreinforced period, the mean compliance was 6.0 +/- 2.8 h/24 h; that during the reinforcement period was 6.0 +/- 2.7 h/24 h (NS). There was no significant correlation between perceived improvement in OSA symptoms or between the perceived side effects of nCPAP versus hourly compliance. 
Prostatic abscess after transrectal ultrasound guided biopsy. We report a case of a diabetic man who had bilateral prostatic abscesses after ultrasound guided biopsy of the prostate. As is typical of prostatic abscesses, the diagnosis was not evident at presentation. We discuss the morbidity of transrectal biopsy and recommend consistent antimicrobial prophylaxis. We also recommend transrectal ultrasound in the diagnosis of such abscesses, and support the standard treatment of drainage and parenteral antimicrobial therapy. We anticipate that the incidence of prostatic abscess will increase due to the increasing number of men undergoing transrectal biopsy in the current age of transrectal ultrasound guided biopsy. 
Trunk orientation as the determining factor of the 'contralateral' deficit in the neglect syndrome and as the physical anchor of the internal representation of body orientation in space. The present study examines which egocentric coordinate system determines the border between the disturbed 'contralateral' and the normal 'ipsilateral' side in patients with hemineglect. Based on the observation of significantly longer reaction times for saccades towards stimuli presented in the left visual field (LVF) in right brain-damaged patients with hemineglect, stimuli were presented randomly to the LVF or RVF and the corresponding saccadic reaction times (SRTs) were compared. Beginning with the standard body position generally used for the investigation of neglect patients, where the midlines of head, trunk and visual field are parallel and oriented straight towards the middle of the projection screen, the spatial relation between orientation of head and trunk midlines and location of the target stimuli was systematically varied while holding the retinal projection of the stimuli constant. The deficit in SRTs towards the LVF in 4 right brain-damaged patients with left-sided hemineglect could be compensated for by turning the patients' trunk to the left, such that both LVF and RVF-stimuli were projected to the right, ipsilateral side of trunk space. The results suggest that the spatial orientation of the trunk midline divides our normal perception of space into an egocentric 'left' and an egocentric 'right' sector and seems to be the decisive factor for determining the neglected 'contralateral' part of space in patients with brain-damage. They indicate that the trunk midline constitutes the physical anchor for calculation of the internal egocentric coordinate frame for representing body position with respect to external objects. The hypothesis of Ventre et al. (1984) that deficient reactions to contralaterally located stimuli in neglect patients could be the result of a displacement of these egocentric coordinates towards the non-neglected, ipsilateral side is discussed. 
Balloon dilatation of esophageal strictures in children. Traditionally, the treatment of esophageal strictures in children has been done with mercury bougies in a prograde fashion or with Tucker dilators passed along a guide wire in a retrograde manner. An alternative approach has used a balloon dilatation catheter passed over a guide wire previously placed under fluoroscopic guidance. Over the past 5 years, this technique has been used in 43 procedures for both discrete and diffuse strictures. The interventions were performed in a total of 15 patients ranging in age from 8 months to 21 years. In all cases, there was improvement of the preceding symptoms following dilatation. This report details the experience with this technique at Children's Hospital Medical Center, Cincinnati, Ohio, emphasizing the indications, contraindications, and potential complications associated with balloon dilatation of esophageal strictures in children. 
A lesson from the controversy about heart rate adjustment of ST segment depression. To summarize the literature review, the heart rate adjustment appears to be able to perfectly discriminate patients with different numbers of diseased coronary vessels in one center, to increase the diagnostic accuracy of three-vessel or left main disease in eight centers, and unable to improve accuracy in seven centers. To explain those differences, several methodological and statistical biases have been considered. However, a recent report regarding the application of the method in eight centers and a meticulous literature review could not explain the superior performance in some laboratories. 
Surgical treatment of carcinoma of the gastric stump. To evaluate retrospectively the surgical treatment of patients with gastric stump cancer following gastrectomy for benign disease, we reviewed 52 patients operated on at the National Cancer Centre, Tokyo, between 1962 and 1988. Resection was carried out in 47 patients (90 per cent) and with curative intent in 36 (69 per cent). Stage distribution was: stage 1, 15 patients; stage 2, 5; stage 3, 9; stage 4, 23. In 36 cases curatively resected, 32 had completion total gastrectomy and four had subtotal resection. An R1 resection was performed in 11 patients and an R2 in 25. We had two hospital deaths and a 5-year survival rate excluding hospital deaths of 39 per cent. The 5-year survival rates of resected cases, curative cases and those having metastatic nodes were 43 per cent, 57 per cent and 29 per cent respectively. Radical resection is a reasonable treatment for gastric stump cancer as it is for primary cancer of the stomach. 
Psychosis following temporal lobe surgery: a report of six cases. Six consecutive patients who had had temporal lobe surgery for epilepsy, and been referred for psychiatric assessment of psychotic symptoms, are reported. Their symptoms (a delusional depression, four schizophrenia-like illnesses, and a case of Capgras' syndrome) are discussed in relation to the possible role of their operations, all of which were on the right hemisphere. 
Diastolic mitral regurgitation with atrioventricular conduction abnormalities: relation of mitral flow velocity to transmitral pressure gradients in conscious dogs. Diastolic mitral regurgitation is a common finding that can be detected with use of Doppler echocardiographic techniques in patients with atrioventricular (AV) conduction abnormalities. With use of simultaneous hemodynamic and Doppler techniques, mitral flow velocity, mitral valve motion and transmitral pressure gradient were studied during 50 cardiac cycles each of spontaneous or atrial paced first- and second-degree AV block in five lightly sedated dogs. Diastolic mitral regurgitation was detected during atrial relaxation on all beats in which ventricular contraction was delayed greater than 190 ms. In all dogs the diastolic regurgitation was associated with a reverse transmitral pressure gradient (3.7 +/- 1.1 mm Hg in first-degree AV block and 3.2 +/- 1.5 mm Hg in second-degree AV block) that occurred primarily as the result of a decrease in atrial pressure with atrial relaxation. These reverse pressure gradients were as large as the maximal forward transmitral gradients in early diastole (2.9 +/- 0.9 mm Hg in first-degree AV block and 3.1 +/- 0.7 mm Hg in second-degree AV block) and larger than the maximal forward pressure gradients at atrial contraction (1.7 +/- 0.5 and 1.4 +/- 0.6 mm Hg, respectively, p less than 0.05). The maximal reverse pressure gradient during atrial relaxation was also as large as the reverse pressure gradient in mid-diastole (2.7 +/- 0.9 and 2.8 +/- 1.0 mm Hg, respectively), associated with deceleration of early diastolic mitral flow. Peak diastolic mitral regurgitation velocity coincided with the maximal reverse transmitral gradient and was usually larger than anterograde mitral flow velocity. 
A prospective comparison of class IA, B, and C antiarrhythmic agents in combination with amiodarone in patients with inducible, sustained ventricular tachycardia BACKGROUND. Clinical experience suggests that combinations of antiarrhythmic agents provide more effective control of ventricular tachyarrhythmias than does therapy with single agents. METHODS AND RESULTS. Antiarrhythmic and electrophysiological effects of three class I antiarrhythmic agents, one from each subclass A, B, and C, were assessed in single use and in combination with amiodarone in patients with inducible, sustained ventricular tachycardia that was not suppressed by monotherapy with these agents. Thirty-one patients underwent an electrophysiology test on four occasions: at baseline; after 2-4 days of treatment with quinidine, mexiletine, or encainide; after 2 weeks of treatment with 1,200 mg/day amiodarone; and last, after 2-4 days of treatment with both amiodarone and the previously tested class I agent. The combination of a class I agent and amiodarone prevented the induction of sustained ventricular tachycardia in only one of 31 (3%) patients. Ventricular tachycardia became hemodynamically stable in 11 of 31 (34%) patients because of a marked prolongation in the tachycardia cycle length. It increased from 323 +/- 39 to 423 +/- 84 msec (n = 11, p less than 0.01) by adding encainide to amiodarone therapy, and it showed a tendency to lengthen when quinidine was added to amiodarone (from 373 +/- 77 to 425 +/- 58 msec; n = 10, NS). Each class I agent increased amiodarone-induced depression in myocardial conduction, but the extent of the additional depression seemed to differ among the three subclasses. Ventricular refractoriness was increased by all class I agents when used in combination with amiodarone, although not by mexiletine or encainide when used alone. CONCLUSIONS. Class I antiarrhythmic agents slow ventricular conduction and increase ventricular refractoriness when used in combination with amiodarone. When amiodarone and class I drugs by themselves do not suppress the induction of ventricular tachycardia, the combination of amiodarone and a class I agent seldom results in noninducibility; however, it often lengthens the ventricular tachycardia cycle length and may render the ventricular tachycardia hemodynamically stable. 
Interleukin 4 is important in protective immunity to a gastrointestinal nematode infection in mice. Parasitic helminths typically induce components of immediate-type hypersensitivity, including elevated serum IgE, eosinophilia, and mucosal mast cells. These responses are T-cell-dependent and associated with rapid expulsion of parasitic worms from a sensitized host; existing experimental systems have failed to define the precise role of cytokines in these responses. We report here that anti-interleukin 4 or anti-interleukin 4 receptor antibodies block the polyclonal IgE response to a parasitic nematode, Heligmosomoides polygyrus, and abrogate protective immunity to the infection. In contrast, anti-interleukin 5 antibody prevented H. polygyrus-induced eosinophilia but did not prevent protection. These data provide evidence that a specific cytokine affects the physiology and survival of a parasitic nematode in the host. 
Hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction in systemic sclerosis and primary pulmonary hypertension. Reduction of pulmonary vascular resistance by a high inspired oxygen concentration is a common, but not universal phenomenon in patients with pulmonary vascular disease of varying etiology that may determine their response to long-term domiciliary oxygen therapy. We therefore determined changes in PVR during oxygen therapy in two patient populations not previously studied: systemic sclerosis (n = 8, mean age +/- SEM, 44.5 +/- 5.4 years) and primary pulmonary hypertension (n = 7, mean age +/- SEM 38 +/- 7.8 years). All patients were hypoxemic (arterial oxygen tension, on air 9.5 +/- 1.2 kPa for SSc and 8.3 +/- 0.6 kPa for PPH, p greater than 0.05). Right atrial pressure, pulmonary artery pressure, pulmonary artery occlusion pressure, systemic arterial pressure, PaO2 and cardiac output by thermodilution were measured at three, 20-min intervals while inspiring air and again after inspiring 60 percent oxygen for 30 min. The PVR fell significantly with oxygen in patients with SSc from 797.6 +/- 179.2 to 610 +/- 151.6 dynes/s/cm-5 (p less than 0.01), and this fall correlated with baseline PAP and PaO2 prior to oxygen therapy (r = 0.86, p less than 0.025; r = 0.77, p less than 0.05, respectively). In patients with PPH, there was no significant fall in PVR with oxygen (from 969 +/- 80.2 to 851.9 +/- 91.2 dynes/s/cm-5, p greater than 0.05) and no predictor of a vasodilator response in individual patients. In SSc, hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction contributes more consistently to elevated PVR than in patients with PPH. 
Trigeminal neuralgia secondary to tumor with normal exam, responsive to carbamazepine. Trigeminal neuralgia is most commonly idiopathic, although it can be associated with multiple sclerosis. Tumors are rare causes of trigeminal neuralgia. A case is presented of trigeminal neuralgia with normal neurological examination and responsive to carbamazepine, secondary to a cerebellopontine angle meningioma. Literature relative to neoplastic etiologies of trigeminal neuralgia is reviewed. The role of electrodiagnostic testing in the evaluation of trigeminal neuralgia is considered. A normal neurological examination and responsiveness to carbamazepine do not exclude tumor as an etiology of trigeminal neuralgia. 
Prevalence of gastroesophageal reflux in elderly patients in a primary care setting. Despite the aging of our population, there remains a paucity of information about gastroesophageal reflux (GER) in the elderly. To assess the prevalence and characteristics of GER within this patient population, questionnaires evaluating symptoms associated with GER were administered to 313 consecutive patients 62 yr old or older from a primary care setting. Fourteen percent of these patients reported having at least weekly heartburn. Ambulatory 24-h esophageal pH monitoring was accomplished in 54 of the 313 patients surveyed. Twenty percent (11/54) of this subgroup exhibited increased acid contact time (pH less than 4 for more than 6% of the monitoring period). Twenty-two percent (12/54) complained of heartburn, yet only six individuals (11%) exhibited both symptomatic and objective indications of acid reflux. Surprisingly, 31% (17/54) of the patients studied exhibited significant alkalinity within the distal esophagus (pH greater than 8 for greater than 1.5% of the monitoring period). Whereas 29% of these patients (5/17) reported heartburn, 40% of those reporting heartburn (2/5) had acid GER as well as excessive alkalinity. In contrast to patients with acid GER--none of whom reported pulmonary symptoms--24% (4/17) of these patients with esophageal alkalinity reported wheezing, nocturnal cough, or paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea. Of the four patients with significant distal esophageal exposure to both acid and alkali, two reported heartburn and a third reported dysphagia. In addition to the somewhat higher prevalence of acid reflux than anticipated, a surprisingly high prevalence of esophageal alkalinity was observed. 
Impact of intraoperative echocardiography on surgical management of congenital heart disease. Intraoperative echocardiography was performed by epicardial, 2-dimensional, low- and high-pulsed repetition frequency, continuous-wave Doppler and color flow mapping in 50 patients. Forty studies were performed before and 44 studies after cardiopulmonary bypass. Studies before cardiopulmonary bypass agreed with preoperative evaluation. After cardiopulmonary bypass, studies revealed that 11 of 25 patients who underwent repair of ventricular septal defects had residual ventricular septal defects, and 1 of 25 patients who underwent atrial septal repair had 1 residual atrial communication. One patient with a "Swiss cheese" ventricular septum underwent repeat cardiopulmonary bypass to close residual ventricular septal defects. The patient with a residual atrial communication required immediate reoperation because of a right to left shunt after a modified Fontan procedure. Eight of 10 remaining residual ventricular septal defects spontaneously closed 1 to 41 days after operation. Assessment of postcardiopulmonary bypass and postoperative valvular regurgitation in 21 valves revealed good correlation (p less than 0.01). However, 1 patient required reoperation for mitral valve replacement on the sixth postoperative day. The correlation was fair between postcardiopulmonary bypass and postoperative residual stenotic pressure gradients in 12 surgically repaired stenotic lesions. This study shows that little additional information is added to a comprehensive preoperative evaluation by precardiopulmonary bypass intraoperative echocardiography. Postcardiopulmonary bypass intraoperative echocardiography is useful in identifying residual shunts. Assessment of stenotic gradients and valvular regurgitation must be interpreted in light of a changing hemodynamic state. 
Intensive combination chemotherapy and autologous bone marrow transplantation leads to the reappearance of Philadelphia chromosome-negative cells in chronic myelogenous leukemia. Fifteen patients with Philadelphia chromosome (Ph)-positive chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) who were ineligible for allogeneic bone marrow transplantation (BMT) or alpha-interferon therapy were included in this study. Eight patients were in the first late chronic phase, five were in the second chronic phase, one was in the accelerated phase, and one was in the blastic phase. Autologous bone marrow cells (median, 2.5 x 10(8) nucleated cells/kg) were stored at a median of 30 months after diagnosis. Patients were treated with cyclophosphamide (1.5 g/m2 daily for 4 days), carmustine (BCNU) (300 mg/m2), and etoposide (VP-16) (250 mg/m2 daily for 3 days) (CBV), followed by reinfusion of autologous bone marrow. Hematopoietic recovery was rapid, and toxicity was mild to moderate in 14 patients. One patient died of cytomegalovirus pneumonitis. Eight of 15 patients showed Ph suppression to less than 90% Ph-positive metaphases after autologous BMT. Major cytogenetic responses (Ph suppression to less than 35% Ph-positive metaphases) developed in four patients. Cytogenetic responses were observed in 4 of 11 patients infused with 100% Ph-positive marrows, and in all 4 patients infused with Ph-mosaic marrows (mixture of diploid and Ph-positive cells). Better results were observed when autologous BMT was performed in the chronic phase compared with the advanced phases. The major cytogenetic responses have lasted for 3, 4, 12, and 15+ months, whereas minor cytogenetic responses lasted for only a short time (less than 2 months). Three of seven patients (43%) in the chronic phase with previous resistance to alpha-interferon therapy became sensitive to alpha-interferon therapy after autologous BMT. The authors concluded that intensive chemotherapy followed by autologous BMT produced cytogenetic remissions in patients with Ph-positive CML and reinduced disease sensitivity to alpha-interferon therapy in patients previously resistant to it. This is particularly useful when treatment is given during the chronic phase and stem cells are collected at a time of previous cytogenetic remission. 
Is combined modality therapy appropriate for apparently localized carcinoma of the prostate? In a pilot study at the authors' institution, 17 patients with stage C carcinoma of the prostate had preoperative therapy with diethylstilbestrol. After 8 to 12 weeks of DES at 3 mg per day, the surgical margins, seminal vesicles, and pelvic lymph nodes were free of tumor in seven patients. In one patient, no residual tumor could be found despite an extensive search, and in two other cases, only small foci of atypical cells could be found. The authors suggest a trial of the proper role of neoadjuvant hormonal therapy in stages B2 and C prostatic carcinoma. 
Reconstitution of an active surface CD2 by DNA transfer in CD2-CD3+ Jurkat cells facilitates CD3-T cell receptor-mediated IL-2 production. To investigate the requirements for CD2 expression in the activation of T lymphocytes via the CD3-TCR complex, we produced and characterized a series of CD2-variants of the IL-2 producing Jurkat leukemia cell line, J32 (surface phenotype, CD2+, CD3+, CD28+). These mutants were derived by radiation and immunoselection, and were cloned under limiting dilution conditions. A total of 3 out of 30 of these mutants selectively lost the expression of both CD2 surface molecules and CD2 mRNA, and retained the expression of the CD3-TCR complex and the CD28 molecule. A mitogenic combination of anti-CD2 antibodies (9.6 + 9-1) failed to stimulate activation of these variants as measured by mobilization of intracellular Ca2+ and by IL-2 production. The CD2- mutants stimulated with anti-CD3 or anti-TCR mAb revealed an 8- to 32-fold decrease in IL-2 production and IL-2 mRNA accumulation as compared with the parental cells. No alteration of CD3-TCR-induced mobilization of intracellular Ca2+ was observed in the CD2- mutants. Reconstitution of CD2 expression by gene transfer in two J32 CD2- mutants restored IL-2 production and IL-2 mRNA accumulation in responses to both anti-CD2 and anti-CD3-TCR mAb. These results are the first direct demonstration of the requirement for CD2 molecules in optimizing IL-2 response in human T cells stimulated via CD3-TCR complex. 
The pharmacokinetics and biodistribution of technetium-99m(V)dimercaptosuccinic acid in an animal tumor model. This study used an established rabbit tumor model with squamous carcinoma to evaluate the pharmacokinetics and biodistribution of technetium-99m-(V)dimercaptosuccinic acid. A total of 54 rabbits were studied (25 with no tumor; 29 with tumor). Technetium-99m(V)dimercaptosuccinic acid had a bi-exponential blood clearance in rabbits with no tumors (28 and 325 min) and in rabbits with tumors (27 and 352 min). There was no significant difference (p greater than 0.05) in mean clearance times between the two groups and clearance appeared unaffected by tumor mass. Technetium-99m(V)dimercaptosuccinic acid had a bi-exponential cumulative urine excretion with no apparent difference in half-times between non-tumor and tumor rabbit groups (200 and 240 min, respectively). Technetium-99m(V)dimercaptosuccinic acid had a major organ biodistribution in rabbits which included bone, kidneys, bladder and the blood pool. The major route of excretion was via the urine. There was no significant difference (p greater than 0.05) in organ biodistribution between rabbits with no tumors and rabbits with tumors and there was no evidence of active uptake of technetium-99m(V)dimercaptosuccinic acid by either squamous carcinoma or inflammatory tissue. 
Coordination of swallowing and respiration in unconscious subjects. We investigated the coordination of swallowing and breathing in 11 unconscious patients with an endotracheal tube in place during the recovery period from general anesthesia. Swallows occurred during both the inspiratory and expiratory phases with no preponderant occurrence during either phase. When a swallow occurred during inspiration, the inspiration was interrupted immediately and was followed by expiration, but the durations of both inspiration and expiration were progressively increased as the time from the onset of inspiration to the onset of swallowing was progressively delayed. A swallow coinciding with the expiratory phase progressively prolonged the duration of the expiration that had been interrupted as the timing of swallowing was progressively delayed. Repeated swallows invariably and in a predictable manner caused changes in the breathing pattern. Thus when the frequency of regularly repeated swallows was relatively high, the breathing pattern was characterized by regular, shallow, and rapid breaths. When the frequency of regularly repeated swallows was relatively low, the breathing pattern was characterized by regular, deep, and slow breaths. When the frequency of repeated swallows was irregular, the breathing patterns were characterized by inconsistent changes in tidal volume and respiratory frequency. Our results indicate that, in unconscious subjects, some mechanisms integrating respiration and swallowing are operative and responsible for changes in breathing patterns during swallowing. 
Antihypertensive drug therapy and survival by treatment status in a national survey. The National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES I) Epidemiologic Follow-up Study, an investigation of a cohort originally examined during the period 1971-1975, provided an opportunity to assess the frequency of antihypertensive drug therapy in the United States during the period 1982-1984. For most age-sex-race subgroups, the frequency of medication use during 1982-1984 was higher than that observed during 1976-1980 based on the NHANES II. In the interval 1982-1984, diuretic agents were the most frequent medications prescribed (47% of drugs prescribed), and beta-blockers were second (17%). At the time of the initial survey in 1971-1975, participants had their blood pressures measured and a history of diagnosis and treatment of hypertension ascertained. Follow-up for vital status was 93% complete by 1984 (average length of follow-up, 9 years). In white men and women aged 50 years and older, the relative risk of death increased steadily, from those with elevated blood pressure (systolic blood pressure greater than or equal to 160 mm Hg or diastolic blood pressure greater than or equal to 95 mm Hg) but no history of hypertension to those treated for hypertension but whose blood pressure was still elevated. Regardless of history or treatment, those with an elevated blood pressure had about a 25-30% excess risk of death. Evidence from these national studies shows a high frequency of antihypertensive drug therapy in 1982-1984 and suggests the importance of adequate blood pressure control for optimal survival. 
Thromboprophylaxis in patients with hip fractures: a prospective, randomized, comparative study between Org 10172 and dextran 70. A prospective, randomized, assessor-blind trial has been undertaken to compare the thromboprophylactic effect and safety of the heparinoid Org 10172 (a mixture of low molecular-weight sulfated glycosaminoglycuronides) and dextran 70 in patients operated on for hip fracture. Prestudy biostatistical calculations led to the need for 260 patients. Three hundred eight patients were randomized and 19 were excluded after randomization, the majority because of postponed surgery. Analyses were made on the 289 patients on an intention-to-treat basis, as well as on the 247 patients given correct prophylaxis. Diagnosis of deep vein thrombosis was based on bilateral ascending phlebography on postoperative days 10 through 12. The frequency of deep vein thrombosis on an intention-to-treat basis was 10% in the Org 10172 group and 30% in the dextran 70 group and, on the basis of correct prophylaxis, 12% and 31%, respectively, both differences being significant (p less than 0.001). Two-month mortality rates were equal in the groups. Three fatal pulmonary emboli were seen in the dextran group. Significantly more patients in the dextran group received postoperative transfusions; no other differences in various hemorrhagic parameters were seen. Thus it can be concluded that Org 10172 has a significantly better thromboprophylactic effect than does dextran in patients with hip fractures without significant side effects. 
Evaluation of the abdomen in intoxicated patients: is computed tomography scan or peritoneal lavage always indicated? STUDY OBJECTIVE: To investigate the necessity of intensive evaluation of the intoxicated patient with normal mentation for intra-abdominal injury after blunt torso trauma. DESIGN: Retrospective study; trauma registry and medical records. SETTING: Level I regional trauma center serving a population of 2.3 million. PARTICIPANTS: Adult victims of blunt trauma more than 17 years old, admitted between January 1, 1986, and December 31, 1989, with suspected blunt abdominal injury and serum ethanol of more than 100 mg/dL and Glasgow Coma Score of 15. INTERVENTION: All patients had serum ethanol levels measured in mg/dL and computed tomography (CT) scan of the abdomen and/or diagnostic peritoneal lavage (DPL). RESULTS: Criteria were met by 92 patients. Eighty-nine underwent CT scans, two had DPL, and one had both. Of 17 patients complaining of abdominal pain and/or tenderness on palpation, six (35.3%) had blood in the peritoneal cavity demonstrated by CT scan or DPL and underwent celiotomy. All 75 patients without abdominal pain or tenderness had negative CT scan or DPL, with no missed injury. CONCLUSION: In the intoxicated blunt trauma patient with normal mentation, the physical examination is a reliable indicator of abdominal injury. Elevated alcohol level, per se, should not be considered an absolute indication for DPL or abdominal CT. 
Reversibility of blue-gray cutaneous discoloration from amiodarone. A 45-year-old man had severe blue-gray cutaneous discoloration during amiodarone therapy for atrial fibrillation. Therefore, this drug regimen was discontinued, and long-term anticoagulation and digoxin therapy were used. The patient was advised to avoid exposure of his skin to sunlight, and a bleaching agent was prescribed. After 18 months of follow-up, the blue-gray hyperpigmentation had diminished. Although photosensitivity reactions from amiodarone occur in more than 50% of patients, blue-gray cutaneous discoloration occurs in less than 10% of patients on prolonged therapy with amiodarone. The presence of high concentrations of iodine, detected by electron probe analysis, suggests that the cutaneous deposits are amiodarone itself or a metabolite. The slow rate of elimination of amiodarone and a high uptake by fat-associated tissues may explain the delayed disappearance of cutaneous photosensitivity and late resolution of the blue-gray discoloration. Our current case supports the reversibility of these adverse effects on long-term follow-up. 
Duodenobronchial fistula. Duodenobronchial fistulas are an extremely rare subgroup of abdominobronchial fistulas, which include bronchobiliary, gastrobronchial, enterobronchial, colobronchial, and splenobronchial fistulas. Only one case of a duodenobronchial fistula has been previously reported. Duodenobronchial fistulas occur as a complication of a duodenal injury. The characteristic symptoms are a cough that produces copious bilious secretions, shortness of breath, and fever. The diagnosis is made by contrast gastrointestinal studies. Treatment requires an abdominal approach with interruption of the fistula at its duodenal origin and control of the inciting inflammatory process. With prompt diagnosis and treatment, thoracic drainage or pulmonary resection should not be needed. 
Valgus high tibial osteotomy. A long-term follow-up study. One hundred twenty-eight knees in 107 patients with osteoarthrosis treated by valgus high tibial osteotomy were clinically reviewed. Patients were reviewed from three to 15 years postoperatively (mean, 7.5 years). The revision rate in the osteoarthrotic population was 10.9%. Patients who were older than 60 years of age at the time of surgery had results comparable to those patients who were younger than 60 years of age at the time of surgery. Women and men appeared to have a similar prognosis; 79.6% good and excellent results up to nine years; at ten to 15 years, 70% good and excellent. 
Ischemic necrosis: a hypothesis to explain the pathogenesis of spontaneously ruptured enterocystoplasty. Spontaneous enterocystoplasty rupture represents a devastating and potentially fatal late complication. Previously proposed mechanisms of rupture include catheter trauma, chronic infection, avulsion of adhesions between the bowel patch and peritoneum, and chronic overdistension with elevated intravesical pressures. We have witnessed this complication 4 times in 3 patients 5 weeks to 46 months postoperatively. Tissue specimens from 3 episodes in 2 patients with detubularized sigmoid enterocystoplasties were available for histological examination. All patients had a neurogenic bladder from myelomeningocele, all had an AMS800 artificial urinary sphincter and all had a documented history of chronic distension from inadequate emptying of the augmented bladder. At exploration, all of the ruptures were found within the bowel segment near the bladder apex in an area remote from the anastomotic line. In each case tissue specimens from the rupture site showed marked vascular congestion, intramural hemorrhage, abundant hemosiderin laden macrophages, myofiber atrophy and intravascular thrombi. These features are interpreted to reflect the sequelae of vascular compromise and ischemia. We propose that enterocystoplasty rupture results from ischemia, possibly due to chronic overdistension and subsequent vascular compromise. This mechanism may account for many of the previously reported cases of enterocystoplasty rupture. 
Cranial vault and gigantic intracranial hydatid cyst in a young woman. The case of a young woman (20 years) with a gigantic intracranial hydatid cyst (110 x 90 x 65 mm) is presented. The first manifestation was a grand mal seizure followed by symptoms of raised intracranial pressure. The origin of the cyst was in the diploe of the right cheek, frontal, temporal, and parietal bones. An osteoplastic craniotomy was performed, and more than 100 fertile daughter cysts were removed, together with the wall of the cyst. A modification in the standard operative procedure is proposed for gigantic cysts that emerge from the diploe of the cranial vault and extend intracranially. Therapy with dexamethasone and phenobarbital was instituted preoperatively and continued postoperatively. The 3-month follow-up showed no relapse. 
Interrupted aortic arch with tetralogy of Fallot. A report of an unsuccessful surgically treated case. Interrupted aortic arch is a complete discontinuity of two segments of the aorta. Although associated with a number of conditions, it does not occur in association with pulmonary stenosis. We report a case unsuccessfully treated but from which we have learnt a lesson. 
Amiloride delays the ischemia-induced rise in cytosolic free calcium. An increase in cytosolic free calcium (Cai) has been shown to occur early during ischemia in perfused rat, ferret, and rabbit hearts. It has been proposed that this increase in Cai may occur as a result of exchange of Nai for Cao, which occurs as a result of an increase in Nai arising from exchange of Nao for H+i. The latter exchange is stimulated by the intracellular acidification that occurs during ischemia. To test this hypothesis, we examined Cai, Nai, ATP, and pHi during ischemia in rats in the presence and absence of 1 mM amiloride, a Na-H exchange inhibitor. Cai was measured using 19F nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) of 1,2-bis(2-amino-5-fluorophenoxy)ethane-N,N,N',N'-tetra-acetic acid (5F-BAPTA)-loaded rat hearts. Nai was measured using 23Na NMR, and the shift reagent 1,4,7,10-tetraazacyclododecane-N,N',N",N"'-tetramethylenephosph onate (Tm[DOTP]-5) was used to separate Nai and Nao. ATP and pH were determined from 31P NMR measurements. During 20 minutes of ischemia, amiloride did not significantly alter the ATP decline but did significantly attenuate the rise in Nai and Cai. After 20 minutes of ischemia, time-averaged Cai was 1.0 +/- 0.2 microM (mean +/- SEM) in amiloride-treated hearts compared with 2.3 +/- 0.9 microM in nontreated hearts. After 20 minutes of ischemia, Nai in the untreated heart was threefold greater than control, whereas in the amiloride-treated heart, Nai was not significantly different from control. These data are consistent with the involvement of Na-Ca exchange in the rise in Cai during ischemia. 
Management of the pregnant woman with spinal cord injuries. This paper forms part of an ongoing prospective study of pregnancy and labour in women with spinal cord injuries and combines a prospective and retrospective analysis of 17 pregnancies in 15 women with spinal injuries. The management and outcome in those 17 pregnancies is reviewed. 
Severe lactic acidosis related to acute thiamine deficiency. The authors report a case of severe lactic acidosis in a 3-year-old boy, after 20 days of total parenteral nutrition without vitamin supplementation. This child with acute lymphoblastic leukemia underwent a period of severe refractory lactic acidosis (pH between 6.81 and 7.00 and a serum lactate level up to 38 mmol/liter) leading to cardiac arrest. After the initial resuscitation and the subsequent treatment of shock and vitamin K deficiency, acute peritoneal dialysis was instituted to correct the severe lactic acidosis. Initial low plasma thiamine levels confirmed the diagnosis of thiamine deficiency. An associated transient pancreatic dysfunction was also noted. The patient's overall course with thiamine replacement therapy led to a complete recovery within 5 days and no sequelae were noted after 12 months. 
Concomitant pelvic irradiation, 5-fluorouracil and mitomycin C in the treatment of advanced cervical carcinoma. This was a Phase II study of 24 late (FIGO) Stage IIb and 39 Stage III patients. External beam radiotherapy was given daily, five days a week, using 15 x 15 cm parallel opposed pelvic fields. The first 20 patients had 45.00 Gy mid-plane dose in 20 fractions, Days 1-28, the last 43 patients had 50.40 Gy in 28 fractions, Days 1-43. This was followed by an intracavitary boost of 17.00 Gy to Point A in two fractions over seven days. The first seven patients had concomitant 5-fluorouracil (5FU) 1 g/m2/day (maximum 1.5 g/day) Days 2-5, 30-33 and 57-60, with mitomycin C 10 mg/m2 (maximum 15 mg) Days 2 and 57. Two patients had WHO Grade 4 cytopenia, and only two were able to have full dose intensity. The 5FU dose was reduced to 0.8 g/m2/day, for Days 2-5 and 30-33; mitomycin C was given on Day 2 only. Treatment morbidity with the reduced chemotherapy intensity was comparable with that of radiotherapy alone. Median follow-up was 16 months (range 6-44). Median survival was 35 months. The results were compared with historical controls treated using the same radiation method alone. Two-year survival for late Stage IIb patients was 67% with the combination and 72% with radiotherapy alone; for Stage III, 67% and 49% respectively. Two-year pelvic control for late Stage IIb was 87% (combination) and 84% (radiotherapy alone) and for Stage III, 61% and 55% respectively. In contrast to reports from other centres, these results do not show an overall significant improvement on radiotherapy alone. A Phase III study may not be practicable. 
Chest wall motion during epidural anesthesia in dogs. To determine the relative contribution of rib cage and abdominal muscles to expiratory muscle activity during quiet breathing, we used lumbar epidural anesthesia in six pentobarbital sodium-anesthetized dogs lying supine to paralyze the abdominal muscles while leaving rib cage muscle motor function substantially intact. A high-speed X-ray scanner (Dynamic Spatial Reconstructor) provided three-dimensional images of the thorax. The contribution of expiratory muscle activity to tidal breathing was assessed by a comparison of chest wall configuration during relaxed apnea with that at end expiration. We found that expiratory muscle activity was responsible for approximately half of the changes in thoracic volume during inspiration. Paralysis of the abdominal muscles had little effect on the pattern of breathing, including the contribution of expiratory muscle activity to tidal breathing, in most dogs. We conclude that, although there is consistent phasic expiratory electrical activity in both the rib cage and the abdominal muscles of pentobarbital-anesthetized dogs lying supine, the muscles of the rib cage are mechanically the most important expiratory muscles during quiet breathing. 
Usefulness of a pericardial friction rub after thrombolytic therapy during acute myocardial infarction in predicting amount of myocardial damage. The TAMI Study Group. To evaluate the clinical incidence and outcomes of patients with pericarditis after thrombolytic therapy, 810 patients were prospectively studied during acute myocardial infarction (AMI). Pericarditis was defined as the presence of a pericardial friction rub during the hospital course. Only 5% of patients developed a rub during AMI, a low percent compared with that in the prethrombolytic era. A pericardial friction rub more often occurred in the setting of an anterior wall AMI. Patients with, compared to those without, a pericardial friction rub had lower ejection fractions (45 vs 51%, p = 0.002); worse regional left ventricular function (-3.2 vs 2.7, standard deviation per chord); higher in-hospital mortality (15 vs 6%, p = 0.056); a higher frequency of power failure (83 vs 57%); a higher frequency of anterior wall location of the AMI (53% of cases, p = 0.002); and a higher frequency of 3-vessel disease. Therefore, although the frequency of a pericardial friction rub was low (5%) compared with that in the prethrombolytic era, its occurrence denotes more extensive myocardial damage with a worse clinical outcome. Perhaps with successful reperfusion of the infarct-related vessel, transmural myocardial necrosis is prevented and with it the development of pericarditis. Cardiac tamponade did not occur clinically in any patient who developed a pericardial friction rub. 
Analysis of anti-tumor antibodies in mice and rabbits induced by monoclonal anti-idiotope antibodies. Eight different mouse monoclonal anti-idiotope antibodies (mAb2) generated against a mouse monoclonal anti-human melanoma proteoglycan Ag (MPG) antibody (mAb1), MEM136, were tested for their ability to induce anti-MPG responses in mice and rabbits. All Ab2 were idiotypically cross-reactive and combining site-specific as demonstrated by competitive cross-inhibition studies and their ability to inhibit the binding of MEM136 to the melanoma cells, Colo38. However, only two Ab2, IM32 and IM06, were able to induce specific anti-TAA-specific (Ab1') responses in rabbits. When IM32 and IM06 were tested in allogeneic stains of mice for the induction of anti-MPG responses, only IM32 produced an Ab1' response. In mice, the Ab3 response induced by IM32 is idiotypically cross-reactive with its Ab1. Furthermore, the IM32-induced murine Ab3 and MEM136 recognized a similar MPG epitope on the melanoma cells because the Ab3 inhibited the binding of MEM136 to melanoma cells. The Ab3 induced by IM32 and IM06 in rabbits also recognized a similar epitope as the Ab1. In rabbits, the Ab3 response induced by IM32 and IM06 were idiotypically cross-reactive with each other. However, additional studies indicated that the majority of Ab3 induced by IM32 were IM32 Id-specific and lacked IM06 idiotopes. Further experimentation indicated that IM32-induced rabbit Ab3 were biologically active as demonstrated by the ability of the Ab3 to inhibit melanoma cell invasion in a Matrigel assay. 
Sphincter-sparing surgery. Since World War II, a variety of technical innovations have been introduced to preserve the anal sphincter in patients with chronic ulcerative colitis or tumors of the rectum. Studies of anorectal physiology have yielded guidelines for preserving continence and minimizing morbidity. For example, preservation of the anal rectal angle is essential; the rectal mucosa can be removed without impairing neural mechanisms; construction of a reservoir increases rectal compliance. Following these guidelines, surgeons have introduced new techniques and applications benefiting a larger and more varied patient population. Some technical problems remain, however, and patient selection criteria for restorative rectal surgery need to be refined. 
Stenting of coronary arteries: has a modern Pandora's box been opened? Interventional cardiology has recently witnessed the growth of several alternatives to percutaneous transluminal angioplasty, including coronary stenting. Although stenting appears to be useful in treating abrupt closure after coronary angioplasty, its effectiveness in limiting the complex processes responsible for late restenosis is much less certain. Pathologic examination of stented human saphenous bypass grafts shows extensive deposits of platelets, fibrin and leukocytes along the stent wires within the 1st week and formation of a neointima of variable thickness after 3 months without evidence of foreign body reaction. The long-term effects of continuous barotrauma induced by the expanded stent remain unknown. It is difficult to assess the relative merits of the new devices, but stenting has several theoretic advantages. It seems less disruptive to the underlying architecture of the vessel wall and enjoys favorable theoretic and effective expansion ratios. Wide-spread clinical acceptance for stenting will depend on demonstrating that its safety, efficacy and cost efficiency are superior to those of balloon angioplasty. 
Low incidence of non-A, non-B post-transfusion hepatitis in London confirmed by hepatitis C virus serology To see whether the introduction of screening tests for post-transfusion non-A, non-B hepatitis (NANBH) in the UK would be worth while, the incidence of such hepatitis was assessed among patients receiving blood during operations at five hospitals served by the North London Blood Transfusion Centre. 387 patients, who each received blood or blood components from an average of 3 donors were followed up prospectively and blood samples were taken every 2 weeks for 3 months and then each month for a further 3 months. 229 patients also provided a sample at 12 months. All available patient and donor samples were tested for alanine aminotransferase concentrations and for antibody to hepatitis C virus (anti-HCV) by ELISA. Repeatedly anti-HCV positive samples were submitted to supplementary HCV assays. 1 of the 387 patients showed biochemical evidence of acute post-transfusion NANBH after exclusion of non-viral causes. Anti-HCV developed in this patient and the seroconversion was confirmed by recombinant immunoblot assay and polymerase chain reaction. Serum from 1 of the 8 donors whose blood he received was positive for anti-HCV by all three methods. In another patient HCV seroconversion was shown by ELISA but alanine aminotransferase concentrations remained normal throughout follow-up. His samples and those of his 2 donors were negative for HCV by the polymerase chain reaction. A third patient showed rises in alanine aminotransferase compatible with post-transfusion NANBH, but serology and polymerase chain reaction assays for HCV were negative for her samples and those of her donors. Anti-HCV reactivity likely to be false positive (negative by both confirmatory tests and no adverse effects in recipients) was seen in 6 of 1283 donors. This study, despite its being carried out in the part of the UK with the highest frequency of infectious markers in blood donations, has shown a very low incidence of post-transfusion NANBH. 
Mechanisms of gastric mucosal injury and protection. This article emphasizes and reviews the premise that because the pathogenesis of acute gastric mucosal injury is multifactorial, several protective mechanisms should also be considered in analyzing gastric mucosal defense. The first part of the article reviews the pathogenesis of acute gastric mucosal injury by major etiologic factors such as hypoxia and chemical and biological agents, and emphasizes the common endogenous mediators of damage (e.g, endothelins, leukotrienes, thromboxane, platelet-activating factor, monoamines, free radicals, proteases, ammonia, hydrochloric acid, and bile acids--in decreasing potency). The second part of the review is devoted to the gastroprotective mechanisms that are analyzed by anatomical (histologic) location and biochemical processes. The endogenous mediators of acute gastroprotection include prostaglandins, sulfhydryl (SH) compounds, non-SH antioxidants, polyamines, and epidermal growth factor, whereas the protective and mediatory role of glucocorticoids, somatostatin, pentagastrin, histamine, gangliosides, and calcitonin gene-related peptide need further studies. A list of endogenous and exogenous chemicals that exert biphasic, damaging, and protective effects on the gastric mucosa in also included. The final common pathway of acute gastroprotection at the structural and functional level seems to be the preservation of subepithelial microvascular integrity leading to maintenance of mucosal blood flow that allows the energy-dependent rapid restitution (cell migration) from surviving gastric neck cells to repair the superficial epithelial defect. Very new data on the contribution of a histodilutional barrier and release of proteases to gastroprotective processes are also discussed. 
Successful transcatheter embolization of pseudoaneurysm associated with pancreatic pseudocyst. Hemorrhage into a pancreatic pseudocyst is a rare event, but is the most rapidly lethal complication of chronic pancreatitis. Visceral-vessel aneurysms are an unexpectedly common finding in arteriography of patients with chronic pancreatitis. This case report describes bleeding from an anterior superior pancreaticoduodenal artery aneurysm, caused by chronic pancreatitis. The aneurysm was successfully treated by embolization with a steel coil. 
Management of adipsia by a behavioural modification technique. Adipsia combined with diabetes insipidus after hypothalamic damage may produce major difficulties in clinical management. If there is an associated memory impairment it may be impossible to teach self-regulation of fluid balance, necessitating long-term hospital supervision. The successful use of a behaviour modification technique to achieve independent drinking and allow discharge from hospital into the community is described in a patient with adipsia, diabetes insipidus and memory impairment resulting from the removal of a craniopharyngioma. 
Radionuclide esophageal transit study in detection of esophageal motor dysfunction: comparison with motility studies (manometry) Radionuclide esophageal transit study (RETS) has been developed to assess motor function of the esophagus. The purpose of this study was to compare RETS to esophageal motility studies (EMS) in detection of motility disorders. A total of 109 consecutive patients without previous history of surgery on the esophagus underwent both RETS and EMS within one month of each other. Final diagnosis was divided into three categories: I--primary esophageal motor disorders (n = 39); II--reflux disease (n = 48); and III--non-cardiac chest pain and/or dysphagia (n = 22). Using EMS as the standard, the results of RETS were as follows: sensitivity for detection of motor dysfunction was 97%, 92%, and 77% for Groups I, II, and III, respectively, while specificity was 91% for Group II and 100% for Group III. Global sensitivity was 92% and specificity was 88%. No clinically significant motor disorders were missed by RETS. In conclusion, RETS is a useful noninvasive test for the screening of patients with symptoms thought to be of esophageal origin. 
Staging carcinoma: its value in cancer of the larynx. Three thousand four hundred and forty-five cases of cancer of the larynx were examined and 3,235 assigned to their TNM group. While good correlation with prognosis could be seen, the value of the detailed subsite (as opposed to the main laryngeal regions) was limited to defining T1a and T1b and aiding that of T2. T status gives some indication of prognosis, but the N status is of almost overriding importance. 
Bovine internal thoracic artery graft. Successful use at urgent coronary bypass surgery. Bovine internal thoracic artery grafts (Bioflow) were successfully utilized in two patients for emergency coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG). One patient was an 80-year-old man with severe varicose veins and a calcified ascending aorta. Heart failure occurred after triple CABG with bilateral internal thoracic and gastroepiploic arteries. The addition of a Bioflow graft to the circumflex artery restored good cardiac function. The second case was a 54-year-old man whose patent old saphenous vein graft was accidentally injured at reoperation. Emergency use of the Bioflow to bypass the right coronary artery in combination with the right gastroepiploic artery graft to the anterior descending artery resulted in an excellent outcome. The two Bioflow grafts were patent at the 20th and 10th postoperative days, respectively. These cases strongly suggest the efficacy of Bioflow during emergency situations in CABG. 
Hepatitis B and C viruses and their interaction in the origin of hepatocellular carcinoma. Serum taken from patients in a case-control study in Athens, Greece, was used to examine the interactive roles of hepatitis B virus (HBV) and hepatitis C virus (HCV) in the origin of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). An enzyme immunoassay for anti-HCV was used to test serum taken from 185 cases with HCC, 35 cases with metastatic liver cancer (MLC), and 432 hospital controls. Weakly positive anti-HCV results were more strongly related to MLC than to HCC, implying that these anti-HCV results are false positive. By contrast, strongly positive anti-HCV results were significantly related to HCC (relative risk [RR], 6.3), whereas no significant association was evident for MLC (RR, 0.6). The association of anti-HCV with HCC was substantially higher among subjects whose radioimmunoassay was positive for hepatitis B surface antigen (RR, 20.0) than among those whose radioimmunoassay was negative for this marker (RR, 4.8). These findings indicate that HCV infection has an interactive role in the origin of HCC. 
Angiosarcoma of the face and scalp. A case report with complete spontaneous regression. A wide, hemorrhagic lesion occurred on the face and scalp of a 75-year-old woman who had no history of previous trauma to the region. Histology showed features consistent with a diagnosis of angiosarcoma. Clinical and radiologic investigations failed to show any sign of internal involvement. The lesion completely regressed without any therapy within a few months from onset, and the patient is alive and free of disease 36 months after the first observation. Repeated clinicoradiologic investigations failed again to prove visceral diffusion of the tumor. Spontaneous regression of an angiosarcoma is an exceptional event, and only one similar case has been reported in the literature. 
Mast cells are critical for the production of leukotrienes responsible for neutrophil recruitment in immune complex-induced peritonitis in mice. Mast cells are secretory cells strategically located in the vicinity of blood vessels where they can readily initiate and modulate various inflammatory processes, including plasma exudation and leukocyte infiltration. We have previously shown that 50% of the neutrophil influx during immune complex peritonitis in mice is due to mast cells. Eicosanoids are important mediators of various inflammatory processes including neutrophil infiltration. The possibility that mast cells are essential for the production of leukotrienes (LT) involved in the elicitation of neutrophils in immune complex peritonitis was investigated in mast cell-deficient, WBB6F1-W/WV, and normal, WBB6F(1-)+/+, mice. The time course and amounts of immunoreactive PGE2, 6-keto-PGF1 alpha, and TX3B2 released into the peritoneal exudates were similar in both sets of mice. LTB4 and LTC4 levels, however, were twofold higher in +/+ than in W/WV mice 2 h after stimulation. HPLC analysis of the peritoneal exudate confirmed the presence of leukotrienes. The 5-lipoxygenase inhibitor A-63162 blocked leukotriene production in a dose-dependent manner in both sets of mice. However, this compound caused a significant reduction (60%) of neutrophil infiltration only in WBB6F(1-)+/+ but not in the mast cell-deficient mice. Mast cell reconstitution of WBB6F1-W/WV mice restored the effect of A-63162 on PMN recruitment. These data suggest that mast cells in the vicinity of blood vessels are important for the synthesis of leukotrienes responsible for PMN recruitment. 
Preliminary experience with magnetic resonance imaging in patients with third-trimester bleeding. Fifteen patients with third-trimester bleeding, in whom transabdominal ultrasound had failed to identify a definitive source of bleeding, underwent magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Magnetic resonance imaging correctly identified three cases of placenta previa. In four patients, intrauterine blood was identified in hematomas. One hematoma was associated with a previa, two progressed to acute abruptions, and one was associated with a clot at the marginal cord insertion. Blood was seen leading away from the placenta in a case that progressed to an acute abruption. It was also seen in the region of the cervix in two patients with placenta previa. One patient had a normal MRI but had a fresh clot at delivery, which presumably formed after the imaging. In the remaining seven patients, MRI scans were negative and the placentas were normal at delivery. Our preliminary results suggest that MRI is helpful in evaluating patients with unexplained third-trimester bleeding. 
Development of systemic lupus erythematosus after interferon therapy for chronic myelogenous leukemia. A 19-year-old man with Philadelphia-positive chronic myelogenous leukemia treated with interferon-alpha (IFN-alpha) therapy for 45 months had systemic lupus erythematosus disease features: malar rash, migratory arthralgias, elevated antinuclear antibodies, elevated antinative DNA, hypocomplementemia, lymphopenia, and proteinuria. After discontinuation of the IFN and initiation of corticosteroids, there was gradual recovery of symptoms, a decline in antinative DNA and antinuclear antibodies to normal levels, and a decrease in proteinuria. The potential association between IFN therapy and the development of systemic lupus erythematosus, and the role of IFN in other autoimmune diseases, is discussed. 
Cerebrovascular malformation causing sudden death. Analysis of three cases and review of the literature. Three unusual cases of sudden death resulting from cerebrovascular malformation (CVM) are presented. CVMs are highly variable in location and morphology, and may be difficult to detect. Two of the patients discussed here had CVMs that involved the circle of Willis directly, and produced rapidly fatal subarachnoid hemorrhage at the base of the brain; both of these subjects were in their late 30s. One had a history of epilepsy; the other had been completely asymptomatic prior to the catastrophic event. The third was an asymptomatic 6 year old with a cerebellar CVM, who survived long enough for inconclusive neurosurgical intervention. In all three cases, the diagnosis was not made prior to autopsy; in one case, the circumstances of death were initially misleading. The relevant literature is reviewed and discussed, with emphasis on differential diagnosis, anatomic examination, and background investigation. 
Angioplasty of an oversized venous bypass graft using two fixed wire systems. Oversized saphenous vein bypass grafts may be inadequately dilated using currently available coronary angioplasty catheters. The hugging balloon technique has been previously described for lesions in large saphenous vein grafts. We report the initial use of the hugging balloon technique using two fixed wire angioplasty catheters in an oversized saphenous vein graft. 
Pituitary gonadal functioning in male alcoholics in an Indian psychiatric hospital. Serum levels of luteinizing hormone (LH), testosterone and hepatic functions were measured in 38 male alcoholics and in 24 male control subjects. Significant elevation of serum LH and a trend of low serum testosterone were noted with scant evidence of advanced liver disease. None of the alcoholics had clinical stigmata of hypogonadism and feminization. 
Renal atrophy or infarction in children with neuroblastoma. Twelve children with adrenal or upper abdominal paraaortic neuroblastoma developed unilateral or bilateral renal atrophy or infarction. At presentation, the children ranged in age from 2 weeks to 9.7 years. Neuroblastomas were stage II (n = 1), III (n = 2), IV-S (n = 2), and IV (n = 7). Treatment varied but included surgery, chemotherapy, localized abdominal irradiation, and/or bone marrow transplantation. Six children developed ipsilateral renal atrophy, five experienced ipsilateral or bilateral acute perioperative renal infarction, and one developed contralateral renal infarction unrelated to surgery. During treatment, two patients required hemodialysis; both subsequently died. Creatinine concentrations in eight patients have been in the normal range. Two patients have had mildly but persistently elevated creatinine levels. Renal damage from primary effects of the tumor can develop in children with adrenal or upper abdominal neuroblastoma. Treatment, especially surgical resection of the primary tumor, chemotherapy, and radiation therapy, can compound such damage. 
Insular carcinoma: a distinct thyroid carcinoma with associated iodine-131 localization Insular carcinoma, once considered a poorly-differentiated thyroid cancer, has been reclassified as a distinct thyroid neoplasm. Since this neoplasm is composed of follicular epithelial cells, it may concentrate radioiodide (131I) making postoperative 131I imaging for detection of metastases and radiotherapy possible. A 20-yr review of 35 cases diagnosed as anaplastic or undifferentiated thyroid carcinoma at this medical center revealed five patients with insular carcinoma. Four patients showed postoperative 131I localization and received therapeutic doses of 131I. Three of the four showed extrathyroidal 131I localization in neoplastic lesions. In one patient, the resolution of metastatic lesions by magnetic resonance and 131I imaging suggests that 131I may have an important therapeutic role in this aggressive neoplasm. 
Transmural distribution of myocardial edema by NMR relaxometry following myocardial ischemia and reperfusion. To determine the distribution and extent of myocardial edema resulting from ischemia and reperfusion, seven open-chest dogs underwent occlusion of the left circumflex coronary artery for 2 hours (group I), and 10 underwent occlusion for 2 hours and reperfusion for 2 hours (group II). Proton nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (T1 and T2 relaxation times) and percent water content were determined to quantitate the amount of edema. There was a transmural increase of the T1 relaxation time of the central ischemic zone in groups I and II, although this increase was significantly greater in group II in both the subendocardium (group I = 707.8 +/- 12.5 msec, group II = 813.2 +/- 36.2 msec; p less than 0.01) and subepicardium (group I = 641.7 +/- 20.5 msec, group II = 760.5 +/- 34.7 msec; p less than 0.01). These increases were also observed in the T2 weighted relaxation time in the subendocardium (group I = 54.7 +/- 0.8 msec, group II = 78.7 +/- 6.3 msec; p less than 0.005) and subepicardium (group I = 54.0 +/- 1.4 msec, group II = 73.1 +/- 4.0 msec; p less than 0.001). Transmural differences were evident between the myocardial layers with increased T1 relaxation times (p less than 0.01) in the subendocardium in both groups. Similar increases were noted in the percent water content of the myocardium. Thus T1 and T2 relaxation times lengthened with an increase in myocardial water content following occlusion, and these relaxation times were augmented by reperfusion. We conclude that ischemia-induced edema occurs in a transmural distribution from subendocardium to subepicardium following occlusion, and this edema is further enhanced by reperfusion. 
Role of endothelium-derived prostanoid in angiotensin-induced vasoconstriction. To test the hypothesis that prostanoids contribute to angiotensin II-induced vascular contraction, we compared the effect of angiotensin II on isometric tension development by rings of descending thoracic aorta bathed in Krebs' bicarbonate buffer with and without indomethacin (10 microM) to inhibit cyclooxygenase, CGS13080 (10 microM) to inhibit thromboxane A2 synthesis, or SQ29548 (1 microM) to block thromboxane A2/prostaglandin endoperoxide receptors. The comparisons were made in rings of aorta taken from normotensive rats and from rats with aortic coarctation-induced hypertension at 12 days and 90-113 days after coarctation. These rings released thromboxane B2, which was found to be endothelium dependent, increased in hypertensive rats, and stimulated by angiotensin II (10(-6) M) in normotensive rats and in hypertensive rats at 12 days after coarctation. The angiotensin II (10(-6) to 10(-5)M)-induced contraction of aortic rings was increased by about 30% at 12 days after coarctation and decreased at 90-113 days after coarctation. Removal of the endothelium increased the contractile effect of angiotensin II (10(-6) M) in aortic rings of normotensive rats and hypertensive rats at 90-113 days after coarctation but decreased the effect in aortic rings of hypertensive rats at 12 days after coarctation. In rats at 12 days after coarctation, the angiotensin II (10(-6) M)-induced contraction of aortic rings with endothelium was attenuated by indomethacin and SQ29548 but not by CGS13080. These data suggest that a prostanoid-mediated and endothelium-dependent mechanism of vasoconstriction contributes to the constrictor effect of angiotensin II in aortic rings of rats in the early phase of aortic coarctation-induced hypertension. 
Temporary closure of the abdominal wall by use of silicone rubber sheets after operative repair of ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysms. Management of patients after operative repair of abdominal aortic aneurysms can be further complicated if primary closure of the abdominal wall cannot be technically accomplished or is associated with profound increases in intraabdominal and peak inspiratory pressures. We recently treated five patients with ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysms and one patient with a ruptured thoracoabdominal aneurysm whose abdominal incisions had to be closed with a Dacron reinforced, silicone sheet. All patients were hemodynamically unstable either at admission to the hospital or became so during operation. Four patients required the insertion of a silicone rubber sheet at the primary operation because of massive retroperitoneal hematoma or edema of the bowel wall or both. Incisions in two patients were closed primarily, but the patients required reexploration and secondary closure with silicone rubber sheets because of the development of marked increases in peak inspiratory pressures, intraabdominal pressures, and decreased urinary output. Four of the six patients subsequently underwent successful removal of the silicone rubber sheets with delayed primary closure of the abdominal wall, and two others died before removal. The patient with the ruptured thoracoabdominal aneurysm died on postoperative day 20 because of pulmonary sepsis but had a healed abdominal incision. The three surviving patients have been discharged. A silicone rubber sheet may be necessary for closure of the abdominal wall after repair of ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm in patients where primary abdominal wall closure is impossible or where it results in compromise in respiratory or renal function. 
Immunohistochemical study of thyroid peroxidase in normal, hyperplastic, and neoplastic human thyroid tissues. An immunohistochemical study using two monoclonal antibodies (MoAb 30 and MoAb 47) against thyroid peroxidase (TPO) was performed on surgical specimens of human thyroid carcinoma (n = 65), adenoma (n = 70) and Graves' disease (n = 10). Normal adjacent thyroid tissue was used as positive control. Monoclonal antibody 30 reacted significantly with all adenoma and most carcinoma, whereas MoAb 47 reacted with 66 adenoma but only two carcinoma. Of the four adenomas that did not react with MoAb 47, three were of the fetal type. Both carcinoma reacting with MoAb 47 were of the well-differentiated follicular type. These findings further confirm the hypothesis that thyroid carcinoma is associated with changes in the quantity and antigenic properties of TPO. Although the alterations in antigenic behavior revealed by MoAb 47 are not 100% specific, they may allow more accurate diagnosis of malignancy in thyroid tumors. 
Body surface isopotential mapping of the entire QRST complex in the Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome. Correlation with the location of the accessory pathway. Body surface potential maps were recorded during sinus rhythm and during atrial pacing at the time of electrophysiologic studies in 42 patients with Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome. The locations of the accessory pathways were determined by epicardial mapping during surgery in 34 patients and by multicatheter endocavitary electrophysiologic studies in eight additional patients. During delta wave inscription, the shape and extension of areas of the negative and positive potentials on the thorax correlated better with the preexcitation site (69% of patients) than with the localization of the minimum potential alone (45.2% of patients). Typical potential distributions were present from the beginning of the delta wave and remained stationary during the first half of the QRS complex. During marked preexcitation, the superposition of atrial activity on the delta wave produced a mixed pattern in the earliest maps. However, these alterations of early delta thoracic potential distribution did not persist longer than 30 msec. The spread of the negative potentials during the last half of the QRS complex also characterized each localization: right-sided preexcitation reproduced the depolarization sequence of left bundle branch block, left-sided preexcitation reproduced that of right bundle branch block, and posterior pathways resembled left anterior fascicular block. Anterior left ventricular and more anterior left lateral ventricular preexcitations mimicked a right bundle branch block-left posterior fascicular block pattern. There was good correlation between the body surface potential map obtained during the ST segment and the site of the right-sided preexcitation. However, in left-sided preexcitations, ST patterns concordant with delta wave patterns were found less frequently than in right-sided preexcitations. 
Amantadine toxicity presenting with complex ventricular ectopy and hallucinations. Amantadine hydrochloride is a commonly prescribed drug with a narrow therapeutic-to-toxic range. Toxicity is related to the anticholinergic properties of the drug and primarily affects the cardiovascular, central nervous, and respiratory systems. We report the case of an adolescent who ingested 1.3 grams of amantadine and developed complex ventricular arrhythmias and altered mental status. The arrhythmias were completely suppressed with intravenous lidocaine. This case supports the hypothesis that lidocaine is effective for treatment of ventricular arrhythmias secondary to amantadine toxicity. 
Upper gastrointestinal bleeding following open heart surgery. Predominant finding of aggressive duodenal ulcer disease. We reviewed our experience with endoscopically evaluated severe upper gastrointestinal hemorrhage following open heart surgery. Of 4892 patients undergoing open heart surgery, 18 (0.4%) sustained upper gastrointestinal hemorrhage requiring endoscopic evaluation. Endoscopy identified the source of bleeding in all cases. No significant complications of endoscopy were observed. Duodenal ulcers (DUs) were found in 16 (89%) of cases and were felt to be the source of bleeding in 15 (83%). Aggressive features, such as multiplicity, large size, or distal location were associated with 13 (81%) of the DU cases. Complications necessitated endoscopic or surgical therapy in eight (44%) patients with DUs. We conclude that aggressive DU disease accounts for the majority of severe upper gastrointestinal bleeding following open heart surgery. 
Nonketotic hyperglycinemia: treatment with NMDA antagonist and consideration of neuropathogenesis. Patients with neonatal-onset nonketotic hyperglycinemia have high-glycine content in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) which is believed to be a cause of intractable neurologic manifestations. The glycine receptor was believed to be inhibitory in the central nervous system; however, a newly discovered glycine receptor is of the excitatory N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor type, which cannot be antagonized by strychnine. The NMDA receptor antagonist, ketamine, was administered to a patient with nonketotic hyperglycinemia; he demonstrated some improvement in hyperirritability, voluntary movement, and electroencephalographic findings. Strychnine therapy had been administered before this trial of NMDA antagonist, but without improvement. The respiratory condition improved with the reduction of the CSF glycine level after withdrawal of sodium valproate. Our findings indicate that high-glycine content in CSF may affect the brain in different ways via NMDA and classic glycine receptors. 
Survival and valve failure after aortic valve replacement. A prospective evaluation of 412 consecutive patients undergoing isolated aortic valve replacement between January 1982 and December 1985 was performed in an attempt to identify the determinants of survival and valve failure. A variety of valves were inserted to permit a prospective evaluation of alternative valves including: Bjork-Shiley mechanical (n = 37), Ionescu-Shiley pericardial (n = 261), Hancock pericardial (n = 78), and Carpentier-Edwards porcine (n = 36). Thirteen patients died in the hospital (3.2%) and 47 patients died in the follow-up period producing an actuarial survival of 81% +/- 3% at 48 months. Survival was independently predicted by advancing age, preoperative New York Heart Association functional class, and the presence of endocarditis (p less than 0.05 by Cox regression analysis). The majority of patients were symptomatically improved (New York Heart Association class I or II: 21% preoperative, 88% postoperative). Freedom from structural valve dysfunction, prosthetic valve endocarditis, and reoperation for valve-related complications were 95% +/- 2%, 95% +/- 2%, and 92% +/- 2% at 48 months, respectively. These valve-related complications occurred more frequently in younger patients and in those with a Hancock pericardial valve (freedom from structural valve dysfunction, 89% +/- 5%; prosthetic valve endocarditis, 84% +/- 9%; reoperation, 78% +/- 10%; p less than 0.05 by Cox regression). Freedom from thromboembolism was 88% +/- 2% at 48 months; it was significantly lower in patients with a preoperative thromboembolic event and was not influenced by the type of prosthesis inserted. Freedom from anticoagulant-related hemorrhage was 85% +/- 8% at 48 months and was not influenced by any preoperative factors. 
Iliopectineal bursitis: an unusual cause of iliofemoral vein compression. The iliopectineal bursa is the largest bursa in the region of the hip joint. Enlargement of the bursa occurs in several conditions and may be manifested by groin pain, a pelvic or inguinal mass, or lower extremity edema due to compression of the external iliac or common femoral vein. A case of lower extremity edema secondary to external iliac/common femoral vein compression caused by an enlarged iliopectineal bursa is presented. The pathophysiology, methods of diagnosis, and forms of therapy are discussed. 
Efficacy of low-molecular-weight heparin in the management of intermittent claudication. Treating chronic arterial occlusive disease with heparin is controversial because of the risks associated with long-term anticoagulant therapy. Low molecular weight (LMW) heparin (mw about 5000 Dalton), which selectively inhibits the Xa factor with minimal risk of hemorrhage, seems to offer new possibilities in the prevention and treatment of both venous and acute arterial thromboembolism. Therefore, 44 patients with intermittent claudication were recruited to a randomized, double-blind, controlled study. Twenty-two were treated for six months with a single daily subcutaneous dose (15,000 UaXa) of LMW heparin and 22 with placebo administered in the same way over the same period of time. After six months, LMW heparin treatment not only improved walking capacity (by lengthening the pain-free walking time by 25%) but also significantly modified the hemorrheologic pattern (by reducing fibrinogen concentrations and whole blood viscosity at low shear rates). LMW heparin also exerted an antithrombotic and profibrinolytic effect by significantly increasing both the anti-Xa factor and plasminogen activity without markedly modifying activated partial thromboplastin time (+20%). No LMW heparin-treated patient hemorrhaged or reported other noteworthy side effects. These results suggest LMW heparin might be a useful drug in the long-term treatment of chronic arterial occlusive disease of the limbs. 
Coarctation: do we need to resect ductal tissue? A review of the literature as well as a retrospective review of 100 neonates undergoing operation for coarctation at Children's Hospital in Boston between 1972 and 1984 has not established clear superiority for either resection and end-to-end anastomosis or subclavian flap aortoplasty with respect to risk of recurrent coarctation. However, there is histological evidence that the juxtaductal coarctation shelf is composed of smooth muscle of ductal origin, which subsequently fibroses. This abnormal tissue may be at risk for late aneurysm development, particularly if balloon dilatation angioplasty is required. The fact that this abnormal tissue is not removed by the subclavian flap procedure is one of the inherent disadvantages of that procedure. Other disadvantages include the need to sacrifice the left subclavian artery and the fact that, unlike resection and end-to-end anastomosis, the subclavian flap procedure does not lend itself to augmentation of the hypoplastic distal aortic arch. Furthermore, occasionally a secondary coarctation membrane is present within the distal aortic arch, and though it is readily detected during the resection procedure, it can be missed with the subclavian flap procedure. Based on these considerations rather than on a demonstrated superiority of either procedure, my colleagues and I currently prefer resection and end-to-end anastomosis over subclavian flap aortoplasty. 
Differences of pathophysiology in experimental meningitis caused by three strains of Streptococcus pneumoniae. Differences in cytochemical and pathophysiologic abnormalities in experimental meningitis caused by pneumococcal strains A, B, and C were determined. Strain C produced the most severe abnormalities of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) concentrations of lactate (P less than .01), protein (P less than .02), and glucose (P less than .01), CSF white blood cell count (P less than .04), cerebral blood flow (P less than .02), and clinical signs (P less than .05). Brain edema occurred only with strains A anc C, with no association with disease severity; intracranial hypertension was also independent of disease severity. Strain B, not C, achieved the highest bacterial titers in the CSF (P less than .005). The widely different abilities of strains of Streptococcus pneumoniae to induce intracranial abnormalities suggest that virulence determinants affect not only evasion of defense during colonization and invasion, as shown in other models, but also determine the course of disease once infection has been established. Differences of cell-wall metabolism among pneumococcal strains may play a role in this latter phase of the development of meningitis. 
Lack of correlation between histologic findings and response to chemotherapy in metastatic breast cancer. A retrospective analysis was undertaken to assess the prognostic role of histologic findings in response to chemotherapy and survival in patients with metastatic breast cancer. Histologic material was available for 395 of 1587 patients treated for metastatic breast cancer at the M.D. Anderson Cancer Center between 1973 and 1984. Chemotherapy consisted of 5-fluorouracil, doxorubicin, and cyclophosphamide or similar drugs, with or without tamoxifen. Maintenance cyclophosphamide, methotrexate, and 5-fluorouracil was continued for 2 years after a cumulative doxorubicin dose of 450 mg/m2 was administered. The histologic distribution was as follows: infiltrating ductal carcinoma, 353; invasive lobular, 14; mixed histology, ten; mucinous, seven; signet ring, four; tubular, three; papillary, two; sarcomatoid, one; and apocrine, one. Because individual histologic types occurred infrequently, the patients were divided into infiltrating ductal and nonductal groups. Baseline patient characteristics included age, performance status, estrogen-receptor status, prior hormone response, disease extent, and levels of alkaline phosphatase, bilirubin, and lactate dehydrogenase. These were similar in the two groups. Significantly more patients with nonductal histology had greater than three metastatic sites. There were also more patients with hemoglobin less than 10 mg/dl and albumin less than 3.5 mg/dl in the nonductal group of patients. However, statistically these factors did not have an impact on the results. There was a 63% response rate (17% complete and 46% partial) for the ductal group and a 60% response rate (12% complete and 48% partial) for the nonductal group. The time from initiation of chemotherapy to disease progression was identical (12 months) for the two groups. Survival from initiation of chemotherapy was not significantly different (22 months for ductal and 27 months for nonductal). Based on this study, the authors conclude that histologic findings have no bearing on patient response to chemotherapy or survival in metastatic breast cancer. 
Thromboembolism prophylaxis. Choosing the proper method for surgical patients. The primary care physician can play a major role in preoperative consultation in terms of assisting the surgical team to reduce the risk of thromboembolism. A preoperative risk assessment takes into account the type and duration of surgery as well as the existence of risk factors such as age and underlying medical conditions. With careful communication, the consulting physician and surgical team can together select a method of preventing thromboembolism that will prove both safe and effective. 
Prenatal alcohol exposure and language development. The effects of fetal alcohol exposure on language and speech acquisition were investigated in a cohort of socioeconomically disadvantaged urban children. Language development was assessed by instruments derived from the Expressive and Receptive Scales of the Sequenced Inventory of Communication Development (SICD) at 1, 2, and 3 years, and by indices constructed from a taped speech sample at age 2 years. Three indices of maternal drinking were supplemented with birth weight and a tally of craniofacial anomalies as early indicators of fetal alcohol damage. No statistically significant relationships were found between the alcohol and language indices after statistical control for confounding variables. The anomalies tally was marginally related to reduced language scores. The statistical significance of this relationship, depended, however, on a single child with the characteristics of fetal alcohol syndrome. The pattern of results suggested that the anomalies tally, and to a lesser extent birth weight, are more sensitive indicators of fetal alcohol exposure than subsequent language development. 
Acute and chronic poisoning from residential exposures to elemental mercury--Michigan, 1989-1990. From May 1989 through November 1990, eight episodes of elemental mercury exposure in private residences or schools in the United States were reported to the Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry (ATSDR). The case studies in this report document two of these episodes (both in Michigan) of residential mercury poisoning--one involving acute mercury exposure, and the other, chronic exposure to elemental mercury. These episodes illustrate the differing clinical and toxicologic manifestations of acute and chronic mercury poisoning. 
Recognition of UGA as a selenocysteine codon in type I deiodinase requires sequences in the 3' untranslated region. Selenocysteine is incorporated cotranslationally at UGA codons, normally read as stop codons, in several bacterial proteins and in the mammalian proteins glutathione peroxidase (GPX), selenoprotein P and Type I iodothyronine 5' deiodinase (5'DI). Previous analyses in bacteria have suggested that a stem-loop structure involving the UGA codon and adjacent sequences is necessary and sufficient for selenocysteine incorporation into formate dehydrogenase and glycine reductase. We used the recently cloned 5'DI to investigate selenoprotein synthesis in eukaryotes. We show that successful incorporation of selenocysteine into this enzyme requires a specific 3' untranslated (3'ut) segment of about 200 nucleotides, which is found in both rat and human 5'DI messenger RNAs. These sequences are not required for expression of a cysteine-mutant deiodinase. Although there is little primary sequence similarity between the 3'ut regions of these mRNAs and those encoding GPX, the 3'ut sequences of rat GPX can substitute for the 5'DI sequences in directing selenocysteine insertion. Computer analyses predict similar stem-loop structures in the 3'ut regions of the 5'DI and GPX mRNAs. Limited mutations in these structures reduce or eliminate their capacity to permit 5'DI translation. These results identify a 'selenocysteine-insertion sequence' motif in the 3'ut region of these mRNAs that is essential for successful translation of 5'DI, presumably GPX, and possibly other eukaryotic selenocysteine-containing proteins. 
Epilepsy surgery in the posterior cortex. Fourteen (74%) of 19 patients obtained a significant reduction in seizures after posterior corticectomy; 6 (32%) were seizure-free over a median follow-up of 3.7 years (range, 1 to 14 years). Surgery included limited resections of the occipital lobe in 16 patients, posterior temporal region in 11, and posterior portion of parietal lobe in 7. Surgical failure related to probable multiple areas of epileptogenesis (4 patients), or limited resections (2 patients) to preserve visual fields (2 patients) and to avoid dyslexia (1 patient). Of 14 patients without a complete hemianopia preoperatively, 6 (43%) developed a new or increased visual field deficit, 2 (14%) of which were hemianopia. Four (36%) of 11 occipital lobe resections resulted in a new or increased visual field deficit: quadrantanopia in 3 and hemianopia in 1. Visual phenomena were the most common initial ictal symptoms, occurring in 13 (68%) of the 19 patients. Twelve patients had complex partial seizures: in 2, always without warning; in 7, always following an aura, usually visual; and in 3 patients, with or without warning. Scalp electroencephalography identified the origin of most recorded seizures in 12 (63%) of the 19 patients. A principal interictal spike focus appeared in 15 patients (79%), and always correlated with the epileptogenic lobe as defined by scalp and/or subdural-recorded seizures (14 patients) or by clinical analysis and computed tomography (1 patient). 
Mitochondrial DNA and Parkinson's disease. Two major lines of evidence support the hypothesis that an impairment of mitochondrial function may underlie neuronal death in Parkinson's disease. First, the neurotoxicity of the parkinsonism-inducing compound 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP) is due to the generation of its 1-methyl-4-phenylpyridinium (MPP+) metabolite in the central nervous system; the toxicity of MPP+ is likely to result from its ability to block mitochondrial electron flow at the level of complex I. Second, recent studies have revealed a deficiency of mitochondrial complex I activity in the brain as well as other tissues of parkinsonian patients. This enzyme activity reduction might be explained by a defect in one or more of the genes coding for the subunits of complex I. Since seven of these genes are localized in the mitochondrial genome, it is conceivable that abnormal mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) might play a role in the pathogenesis of Parkinson's disease. The entire sequence of the human mitochondrial genome is known, and human mtDNA can be isolated and rapidly analyzed using techniques such as the polymerase chain reaction. Therefore, identification of an easily detectable mtDNA alteration might ultimately be used as a marker for the diagnosis and screening of Parkinson's disease. 
Prevention of arterial reocclusion after thrombolysis with recombinant lipoprotein-associated coagulation inhibitor BACKGROUND. This study was designed to determine whether arterial reocclusion after thrombolysis can be prevented by lipoprotein-associated coagulation inhibitor (LACI), a physiological inhibitor of tissue factor-induced coagulation mediated by the extrinsic pathway. METHODS AND RESULTS. Thrombosis was induced in femoral arteries of anesthetized dogs with the use of anodal current to elicit extensive vascular injury and formation of platelet-rich thrombi in one artery and with thrombogenic copper wire to elicit fibrin-rich thrombi without appreciable vascular injury in the contralateral artery. Recanalization of both vessels was induced with t-PA (1.7 mg/kg i.v. over 1 hour) and verified with Doppler flow probes. Reocclusion occurred within 2 hours in seven of seven arteries with electrical injury-induced thrombosis and in four of seven arteries with copper wire-induced thrombosis in the absence of LACI. In dogs given infusions of recombinant DNA-produced LACI (225 micrograms/kg over 15 minutes, followed by 4 micrograms/kg/min i.v.) after completion of the infusion of t-PA, no reocclusion occurred during the 2-hour interval of observation in any of the five arteries subjected to electrical injury (p less than 0.001), and cyclic partial occlusions were nearly abolished (0.4 +/- 0.4/hr in LACI-treated dogs compared with 13.7 +/- 5.5/hr in saline-treated dogs, p less than 0.0001). In contrast, reocclusion occurred in two of five arteries with indwelling copper wires, and cyclic partial occlusions were unaffected despite LACI. LACI prolonged the partial thromboplastin time modestly (1.7 +/- 0.2 x baseline) but did not affect platelet counts or aggregation assessed ex vivo. CONCLUSIONS. Inhibition of the extrinsic pathway of coagulation with LACI prevents thrombotic arterial reocclusion after thrombolysis in vessels subjected to extensive vascular injury. Our results demonstrate that activation of the extrinsic pathway plays a critical role in thrombotic reocclusion and that LACI provides a highly targeted approach to facilitate sustained recanalization without directly inhibiting platelets. 
Common reactions to transfusions. A blood transfusion is a special kind of transplantation, with the transfer of living tissue from one person to another. Reactions can occur with as little as 10 to 15 ml of incompatible blood. The onset of a reaction may be misleading or delayed, and its detection requires astute assessment. Responsibility for recognition of a transfusion reaction lies with the transfusionist, who is often a nurse. The following types of response can occur: hemolytic reactions, transfusion-induced graft-versus-host disease, hemoglobinuria, purpura, fever, circulatory overload, thrombophlebitis, urticaria, hyperkalemia, asymptomatic hemoglobinuria, pulmonary edema, and allergic and anaphylactic reactions. Critical care nurses need to be aware of the dangers of blood and blood product transfusions and to be prepared to react quickly. 
Lipid cyst: classic and atypical appearances. Lipid cysts, a specific type of fat necrosis, frequently have a pathognomonic appearance on radiographs. This consists of a lucent lesion surrounded by a smooth rim that may or not be calcified. Occasionally, lipid cysts with unusual mammographic appearances are encountered. An appreciation of some of these appearances may prevent unnecessary biopsies. 
Motor neuron disease in a patient with a monoclonal IgMk directed against GM1, GD1b, and high-molecular-weight neural-specific glycoproteins. In a patient with motor neuron disease and benign IgMk monoclonal gammopathy, the M protein reacted with the glycolipids GM1, GD1b, and asialo GM1 and, by immunoblot, with some high-molecular-weight neural-specific glycoproteins. The main reactive bands had an approximate molecular weight of 250 and 400 kd, were most concentrated in the spinal cord, and were also bound by the lectin peanut agglutinin. The presence of the Ga1(beta 1-3)Ga1NAc epitope on these neural-specific glycoproteins may help to explain the selective neurological impairment of the patient. 
Symptomatic gastro-oesophageal reflux, abnormal oesophageal acid exposure, and mucosal acid sensitivity are three separate, though related, aspects of gastro-oesophageal reflux disease. The Bernstein test has been used as a test of oesophageal acid sensitivity for over 30 years but its clinical value has been challenged by the advent of ambulatory pH monitoring. Furthermore, the relation between mucosal acid sensitivity, symptomatic reflux, and abnormal oesophageal acid exposure time is unclear. This study examined the relation between these three parameters in patients referred for pH monitoring with unexplained chest pain or heartburn. Fifty consecutive patients were studied - nine with non-cardiac chest pain and 41 with a history of heartburn. Symptomatic reflux was defined as a greater than or equal to 50% temporal association between pain episodes and reflux events (pH less than 4) during pH monitoring. A positive acid perfusion test (in which the patient's usual symptoms were evoked by acid, though not saline) had a 100% sensitivity, 73% specificity, and 81% accuracy for the detection of symptomatic reflux. All 10 patients with symptomatic reflux during pH monitoring had evidence of mucosal acid sensitivity. A negative acid perfusion test made symptomatic reflux unlikely. However, symptomatic reflux or a positive acid perfusion test, or both, were found in some patients with a normal oesophageal acid exposure time during pH monitoring. Mucosal acid sensitivity, abnormal oesophageal acid exposure time, and symptomatic reflux should be regarded as separate, though related aspects of reflux disease. The Bernstein test is simple, safe, and easily performed. A positive test helps to identify an oesophageal cause of symptoms, particularly in patients in whom other aspects of 'gastro-oesophageal reflux disease' are absent, or who do not have symptoms during pH monitoring. 
Relationship between plasma atrial natriuretic factor and urinary kallikrein excretion in essential hypertensives. In order to seek possible relationships between renal kallikrein and atrial natriuretic factor (ANF), we measured urinary kallikrein (UK) and ANF in 84 normal subjects (NS) and in 104 uncomplicated essential hypertensives (HP). Atrial natriuretic factor was significantly higher in HP than in NS (38.5 +/- 1.3 vs 29.0 +/- 1.3 pg/mL, P less than .01), whereas UK was significantly lower in HP than in NS (11.1 +/- 0.9 v 15.3 +/- 0.6 nkatal/24 h, P less than .01). Calculating the 95% of the percentile distribution of the single values of UK in the group of NS we were able to show that 24 out of 104 HP had a UK which fell below the lowest limit (4.5 nkat/24 h) of the normal range. We therefore divided our HP into two subgroups: patients with normal kallikrein excretion (NK) (n = 80; mean UK 13.8 +/- 0.8 nkat/24 h) and patients with low kallikrein excretion (LK) (n = 24; mean UK 2.3 +/- 0.3 nkat/24 h). Normal kallikrein patients had a mean plasma ANF value of 31.9 +/- 1.2 pg/mL which was almost superimposable to that found in NS; on the contrary, the mean plasma level of ANF in LK patients (50.7 +/- 2.2 pg/mL) was significantly higher than that measured in NK patients and in NS (P less than .01 v NK patients and NS, respectively). Since a low urinary kallikrein excretion may represent a marker of an impaired production of renal kallikrein, the high levels of ANF found in the LK subgroup could be the result of a compensatory response of the atrium attempting to maintain sodium and volume homeostasis. 
Norepinephrine response to exercise of rats with a chronic myocardial infarction. Plasma and tissue norepinephrine (NE) concentrations were determined at rest and after 45 min of swimming in rats with a surgically induced myocardial infarction (MI) and in rats having undergone a sham operation (SHAM). The MI rats had moderate-sized infarcts and demonstrated decreases in maximal O2 uptake (VO2max) that are consistent with the contention that the animals possessed a significant amount of left ventricular (LV) dysfunction and chronic heart failure (CHF). Plasma NE concentrations measured at rest were not significantly different between the SHAM and MI groups of rats, although a strong trend was found for the plasma NE concentrations to be elevated in the MI group. The plasma NE responses to 45 min of swimming at the same absolute submaximal workload were similar in the two groups of rats in light of the fact that the MI group of rats exercised at a greater percentage of their VO2max when compared with their SHAM counterparts. Exercise produced significant reductions in the NE concentrations of the diaphragm, vastus lateralis, red portion of the gastrocnemius, plantaris, and vastus intermedius muscles for both the SHAM and MI groups of rats. In addition, the NE concentrations measured in both the soleus and red portion of the gastrocnemius muscle were significantly greater in the MI rats when compared with their SHAM counterparts for both rest and exercise conditions. The results from the present study support the hypothesis that the sympathetic response to exercise is either unchanged or attenuated in MI rats that have a significant amount of LV dysfunction and CHF. 
A phase IA trial of sequential administration recombinant DNA-produced interferons: combination recombinant interferon gamma and recombinant interferon alfa in patients with metastatic renal cell carcinoma. This study investigated the effects of sequentially administered recombinant interferon gamma (rIFN gamma) and recombinant interferon alfa (rIFN alpha) in 36 patients with metastatic renal cell carcinoma (RCC). rIFN alpha was subcutaneously administered daily for 70 days at dosages that varied (2.5, 5, 10, and 20 x 10(6) U/m2) across four cohorts of patients. Within each cohort of patients receiving a given dose of rIFN alpha, three subsets of patients received either 30, 300, or 1,000 micrograms/m2 rIFN gamma. rIFN gamma was administered intravenously for 5 days every third week, 6 hours prior to administration of rIFN alpha. Dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) included constitutional symptoms, leukopenia, nephrotic syndrome with acute renal failure, hypotension associated with death, and congestive heart failure. DLT was related more often to the rIFN alpha dose level than to rIFN gamma dose level. Maximum-tolerated dose (MTD) was 10 x 10(6) U/m2 rIFN alpha and 1,000 micrograms/m2 rIFN gamma. Six patients failed to complete a minimum of 21 days of therapy due to toxicity or rapid progression of disease. Clinical responses were seen in eight of 30 assessable patients. Two patients experienced complete remission and have remained in complete remission 20+ and 22+ months. An additional six patients have shown partial responses for 4 to 18+ months. One patient in partial remission continues to show slow regression of pulmonary and liver lesions off therapy with rIFNs. Clinical responses have remained durable for patients with complete remissions and patients with partial remissions. The results of this study suggest that toxicities associated with combination rIFN therapy can be reduced by administering these agents sequentially as opposed to simultaneously. 
Evidence that genetic emphysema in tight-skin mice is not caused by neutrophil elastase. Mutant tight-skin mice that had severe pulmonary emphysema were crossed with beige mice that contained neutrophils deficient in elastase activity. The resultant tight skin-beige cross mice were deficient in neutrophil elastase activity, yet they were still afflicted with the same degree of severe emphysema as the tight-skin mice. The results indicate that neutrophil elastase does not cause the emphysematous lesions found in tight-skin mice. 
Analysis of morbidity and mortality rates in right hepatectomy with the preoperative APACHE II score. Morbidity and mortality rates in 70 patients who underwent major liver resection for liver tumors (primary and metastatic) were determined and correlated with the preoperative APACHE II score. Patients were divided into three groups according to their preoperative APACHE II score: low (0 to 3), mid (4 to 7), and high (8 and above). A higher score was closely correlated with increased postoperative morbidity and operative mortality rates. The group with low scores had a postoperative morbidity rate of 34% and a mortality rate of 0%, the group with mid scores had a postoperative morbidity rate of 54% and a mortality rate of 3%, and the group with high scores had a postoperative morbidity rate of 80% and a mortality rate of 20%. Age did not correlate with morbidity. It was therefore postulated that morbidity and mortality rates were related to the combination of points for abnormal physiologic variables and points for chronic health, or APACHE II score minus points for age. As the combination of these points increases the postoperative morbidity and operative mortality rates increase significantly (from 24% in the 0-point group to 69% in the greater than or equal to 3-point group). Also the two deaths occurred in the group with 3 or more points. The preoperative APACHE II score may be used by clinicians to evaluate before surgery the risk of postoperative morbidity and death in elective major liver surgery. 
The feeding pharyngostomy: an alternative approach to enteral feeding. We present a six-year retrospective review of feeding pharyngostomies as performed in this department. The indications, technique and complications of this procedure are discussed. 
Randomized, controlled trial comparing long-term sulfonamide therapy to ventilation tubes for otitis media with effusion. Several studies have indicated that either the surgical insertion of ventilation tubes (VTs) or long-term treatment with sulfonamide-based antibacterials is effective in the management of otitis media with effusion (OME; otherwise known as serous otitis media, secretory otitis media, and glue ear) when compared with a no-treatment control or placebo. This controlled trial is the first to compare directly the effectiveness of these two treatments for long-standing OME. Outcome variables are treatment success rates, hearing thresholds, recurrent acute otitis media episodes, and side effects of medication or complications of VT placement. One hundred twenty-five children (aged 2.5 to 7 years) who met the usual indications for surgery (long-standing [greater than 3 months] OME and conductive hearing loss) were randomly assigned to "medical" treatment (sulfisoxazole 75 mg/kg per day for 6 months) or "surgical" treatment (bilateral insertion of VTs). Subjects underwent pure-tone audiometry (500, 1000, 2000, 4000 Hz) and otomicroscopic examination at 2, 4, 6, 12, and 18 months. A significantly greater proportion of medical subjects (67%) than surgical subjects (48%) were treatment failures at 6, 12, or 18 months (P = .0208). Surgical subjects had significantly better hearing at 2 and 4 months (P values less than .01) but not at 6, 12, and 18 months (P values greater than .2). A significantly greater proportion of surgical subjects (50%) experienced complications of treatment than did medical subjects (9%) (P less than .001). Thirty-three percent of candidates for VT placement did not require surgery when treated with a 6-month course of sulfisoxazole. 
Randomised study of antiepileptic drug withdrawal in patients in remission. Medical Research Council Antiepileptic Drug Withdrawal Study Group A prospective multicentre randomised study of continued antiepileptic treatment vs slow withdrawal was conducted in 1013 patients who had been free of seizures for at least 2 years. Comparison of randomised and eligible, but non-randomised, patients suggests the results should be applicable to a wider patient population. By 2 years after randomisation, 78% of patients in whom treatment was continued and 59% of those in whom it was withdrawn remained seizure free, but thereafter the differences between the two groups diminished. Non-compliance with continued treatment accounted for only a small proportion of the risk to the group continuing with treatment. The most important factors determining outcome were longer seizure-free periods (reducing the risk) and more than one antiepileptic drug and a history of tonic-clonic seizures (increasing the risk). Other factors (eg, history of neonatal seizures, specific electroencephalographic features) seemed to have smaller effects, but even in such a large study the confidence intervals for these observations were wide. 
Gallbladder and pancreatic metastases from bilateral renal carcinoma presenting with hematobilia and anemia. A case of bilateral metachronous renal cell carcinoma with gallbladder and pancreatic metastases, presenting with hematobilia and anemia is presented. The presentation of metastatic renal cell carcinoma with hematobilia and anemia is previously unreported. This case illustrates (1) the occasionally very long interval between metachronous renal carcinoma; (2) this tumor's propensity to unusual metastases and unpredictable presentation; and (3) the significant palliation which may be achieved by appropriate surgical resection of these metastases. 
Clinical relevance of tumor cell ploidy and N-myc gene amplification in childhood neuroblastoma: a Pediatric Oncology Group study. We assessed tumor cell DNA content (ploidy) and N-myc gene copy number as predictors of long-term disease-free survival in 298 children with neuroblastoma. Diploid tumor stem lines were identified in 101 patients (34%), clonal hyperdiploid abnormalities in 194 (65%), and hypodiploid stem lines in three (1%). In children with widely disseminated tumors at diagnosis (stage D), ploidy had a highly age-dependent influence on prognosis. Among infants (less than 12 months) treated with cyclophosphamide-doxorubicin, hyperdiploidy was closely associated with long-term disease-free survival (greater than 90% of cases), while diploidy invariably predicted early treatment failure (P less than .001). Similarly, in children 12 to 24 months of age who were treated with cisplatin-teniposide and cyclophosphamide-doxorubicin, diploidy uniformly predicted early failure, whereas half of the children with hyperdiploidy achieved long-term disease-free survival (P less than .001). There was no relationship between ploidy and treatment outcome in children older than 24 months with stage D tumors who had a very low probability of long-term disease-free survival (less than 10%). N-myc gene amplification was detected in 37 (25%) of the 147 tumors tested, with the remainder showing single-copy levels of the gene. N-myc gene amplification was more frequent in diploid than in hyperdiploid tumors (23 of 57 v 14 of 87, P = .001) and predicted a high likelihood of early treatment failure. In children younger than 2 years with disseminated neuroblastoma, tumor cell ploidy and N-myc gene copy number provide complementary prognostic information that will distinguish patients who can be cured on current regimens from those who require new treatment strategies. 
Spontaneous internal carotid artery dissection shown by magnetic resonance imaging. We have reported a case of spontaneous dissection of the internal carotid artery, with MRI and angiographic findings. We conclude that MRI is a beneficial noninvasive test for the detection and study of carotid artery dissection. 
Protein C activation following coronary artery occlusion in the in situ porcine heart BACKGROUND. Activated protein C, the body's natural anticoagulant, may play a role in protecting the heart during and following an occlusion of the left anterior descending coronary artery (LAD) in the porcine heart. METHODS AND RESULTS. Infusion of 1 unit thrombin over 30 seconds into the LAD of juvenile pigs produced a prolongation of the Xa clotting time (153 +/- 14%) in blood drawn from the anterior interventricular vein (AIV). The action of the anticoagulant was blocked by a polyclonal immunoglobulin G antibody directed against porcine activated protein C. A brief (30 seconds) occlusion of the LAD induced a similar prolongation of the Xa clotting time (138 +/- 11%), which was also blocked by the polyclonal antibody. To determine whether activated protein C helps sustain the heart during and following a 2-minute occlusion, three groups of pigs were studied: 11 controls, six receiving activated porcine protein C, and nine receiving a monoclonal antibody (HPC4) that blocks protein C activation. Relative to the controls, HPC4-treated animals recovered function, as measured by the maximum time derivative of left ventricular pressure and segmental shortening, more slowly and were not able to sustain this recovery. Animals receiving activated protein C recovered more quickly and sustained this recovery. CONCLUSIONS. These data indicate that an ischemic insult induces rapid activation of protein C in the coronary microcirulation and that blocking this activation impairs recovery. 
Irregular coronary lesion morphology after thrombolysis predicts early clinical instability After successful thrombolytic treatment for acute myocardial infarction, recurrent ischemia and infarction may occur with little warning. Coronary lesion morphology was analyzed from angiograms performed in 72 consecutive patients at 1 to 8 days after streptokinase treatment for acute myocardial infarction and the data were evaluated in relation to the subsequent clinical course. All patients were clinically stable at the time of angiography and continued to receive heparin infusion for greater than or equal to 4 days after thrombolysis. The infarct-related artery was patent in 55 patients (76%). In the 10 days after angiography, 15 patients developed prolonged episodes of angina at rest; the condition of 4 stabilized with medical treatment, but 11 required urgent medical intervention (coronary angioplasty in 8 and bypass surgery in 3). There were no differences in age, gender, left ventricular function or extent of coronary artery disease between those patients who developed unstable angina and those who had a stable in-hospital course. However, the median plaque ulceration index of the infarct-related lesion was 6.7 (95% confidence limits 6.3, 10) in the 15 patients with an unstable course versus 3.3 (2, 4.4) in those with a stable course (p less than 0.001). There were no differences between the two patient groups in the severity of stenosis, length of diseased segment, symmetry/eccentricity, presence of a shoulder, location at branch point or bend, presence of globular or linear filling defects, contrast staining or collateral supply. These data show that after thrombolysis, the degree of irregularity of the infarct-related artery is a critical determinant of early clinical instability. 
Predominant T cell receptor V gene usage in patients with abnormal clones of B cells. We have examined alpha/beta V gene segment usage of peripheral blood CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, respectively, from patients with multiple myeloma and monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance, by using T cell receptor (TCR) for antigen monoclonal antibodies (MoAbs). In 7 of 16 patients we found an increase in the usage of various TCR V gene segments. The expansion was confined to either the CD4+ or the CD8+ T-cell subset, except for one patient where an abnormal pattern was observed both within the CD4+ and CD8+ T-cell subsets. In one patient 47%, and in another patient 30% of the CD8+ lymphocytes reacted with alpha V12.1 and beta V6.7 antibodies, respectively. In two other patients 29% and 40% of the CD4+ lymphocytes reacted with beta V6.7 and beta V8.1 antibodies, respectively. We conclude that T cells with a predominant V gene usage is a frequent feature in patients with abnormal clonal B cells of malignant or benign types. T- and B-cell populations are normally clonally linked in regulatory circuits. An abnormal proliferation of B cells might therefore induce, or be regulated by, an expansion of clonal T cells, as suggested by the present results. 
The B-cell antigen receptor of the five immunoglobulin classes. Several proteins associate with surface IgM to form the antigen receptor. We show that just two, the alpha and beta associated chains, are sufficient to reconstitute an IgM surface receptor in fibroblasts. Contrary to expectation, a common alpha chain associates with all five immunoglobulin classes. We propose that B-cell antigen receptors consist of a common alpha/beta heterodimer associated with each immunoglobulin class. But the classes differ both in the glycosylation of their associated alpha chain and in their dependence on alpha/beta for surface transport. 
Case of penetrating orbitocranial injury caused by wood. A case of retained intraorbital and intracerebral wooden foreign body following an orbitocranial penetrating injury through the lower lid of an adult is described. Initial failure to recognise the true nature of the injury led to intracerebral abscess formation and monocular blindness. Diagnosis and management of such cases are discussed. 
Ibuprofen provides longer lasting analgesia than fentanyl after laparoscopic surgery. The authors compared the analgesic efficacy of one dose of oral ibuprofen with that of intravenously administered fentanyl for relief of pain after outpatient laparoscopic surgery. Thirty healthy female patients received either 800 mg of oral ibuprofen preoperatively or 75 micrograms of intravenous fentanyl intraoperatively plus respective intravenous or oral placebos in a randomized, double-blind manner. Patients recorded their degree of pain and nausea in the recovery room, in the same-day surgery stepdown unit, during the ride home, and upon arrival at home. The postanesthesia care nurse recorded the amount of fentanyl and droperidol needed to treat pain and nausea in the recovery room. Patients who received ibuprofen were more comfortable in the stepdown unit (P less than 0.05) and after arrival home (P less than 0.05) than those in the fentanyl group. Additionally, patients who received ibuprofen had lower nausea scores in the step-down unit (P less than 0.05); this may have been related to the lower total fentanyl dose in these patients. The authors conclude that ibuprofen may be a useful alternative to fentanyl for providing postoperative analgesia for outpatient surgery. 
Renal and extra-renal levels of renin mRNA in experimental hypertension. 1. Using a ribonuclease-protection assay, renin mRNA levels were compared in the kidneys, livers, brains, hearts and adrenal glands of two-kidney, one-clip Goldblatt hypertensive rats with those of age-matched control rats at 4 weeks ('early') and 20 weeks ('chronic') after clipping, and in the kidneys and adrenal glands of rats treated for 3 weeks with deoxycorticosterone and salt (deoxycorticosterone-salt hypertension) with those of control rats. 2. While marked changes were observed in kidney renin mRNA levels in all three experimental groups compared with their respective controls, in most of the extra-renal tissue studied minimal, if any, difference was seen in renin mRNA levels between the hypertensive and control rats. 3. The findings suggest that in these extra-renal tissues renin gene expression is differently regulated from that in the kidney, and particularly that it is not profoundly affected by changes in the level of circulating angiotensin II. 4. An increase in renin mRNA was observed in the adrenal glands of the 'chronic' Goldblatt rats, which may be of relevance to the maintenance of hypertension in this model. 
Rearrangements of the tal-1 locus as clonal markers for T cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia. Normal and aberrant immune receptor gene assembly each produce site-specific DNA rearrangements in leukemic lymphoblasts. In either case, these rearrangements provide useful clonal markers for the leukemias in question. In the t(1;14)(p34;q11) translocation associated with T cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL), the breakpoints on chromosome 1 interrupt the tal-1 gene. A site-specific deletion interrupts the same gene in an additional 26% of T-ALL. Thus, nearly one-third of these leukemias contain clustered rearrangements of the tal-1 locus. To test whether these rearrangements can serve as markers for residual disease, we monitored four patients with T-ALL; three of the leukemias contained a deleted (tald) and one a translocated (talt) tal-1 allele. These alleles were recognized by a sensitive amplification/hybridization assay. tald alleles were found in the blood of one patient during the 4th mo of treatment but not thereafter. Using a quantitative assay to measure the fraction of tald alleles in DNA extracts, we estimated that this month 4 sample contained 150 tald copies per 10(6) genome copies. The patient with t(1;14)(p34;q11) (talt) leukemia developed a positive assay during the 20th mo of treatment. By standard criteria, all four patients remain in complete remission 11-20 mo into treatment. We conclude that tal-1 rearrangements provide useful clonal markers for approximately 30% of T-ALLs. 
Effect of omeprazole on duodenal ulcer-associated antral gastritis and Helicobacter pylori. This study set out to investigate the effects of omeprazole or ranitidine on the progression of antral gastritis and Helicobacter pylori in patients with active duodenal ulcer. A double-blind, double-dummy trial was performed in 270 patients, 241 of whom were studied histologically for the presence of H. pylori. Patients were randomized to receive omeprazole, 10 mg every morning, omeprazole, 20 mg every morning, or ranitidine, 150 mg twice a day, for four weeks. Endoscopy was performed on entry and at weekly intervals during the study; at least two antral biopsies were taken on each occasion to assess the activity and degree of chronic inflammation, as reflected by the degree of polymorphonuclear leukocyte infiltration and mononuclear cell infiltration, respectively. Biopsy specimens also were assessed histologically for H. pylori. The sex, age and maximal acid output were comparable in the three treatment groups. The percentages of patients showing an improvement in the activity of gastritis in the four consecutive weeks of treatment were 9%, 40%, 51%, and 53% for omeprazole, 10 mg (N = 78); 14%, 42%, 49%, and 53% for omeprazole, 20 mg (N = 81); and 2%, 23%, 30%, and 33% for ranitidine, 150 mg twice a day (N = 82) (life table analysis gave P less than 0.01 for both omeprazole regimens compared with ranitidine). The degree of chronic inflammation showed similar changes. The density of H. pylori decreased significantly after treatment with omeprazole, 10 mg or 20 mg, (both, P less than 0.00001) but not with ranitidine. 
Cytoprotection and stress ulceration. The stomach possesses many mechanisms for protection against stress ulceration. The gastric microcirculation, prostaglandins, mucus secretion, epithelial cell renewal, and muscle tone are factors involved in gastric cytoprotection. Therapy is partially directed at augmenting these natural physiologic defense mechanisms to prevent and promote healing of stress ulceration. Drugs such as sucralfate, carbenoxalone, colloidal bismuth, and prostaglandins are used. Stress ulceration is an important cause of upper gastrointestinal tract hemorrhage in postoperative and critically ill patients in the intensive care unit setting. Preventive therapy includes neutralization of gastric acid by antacids, suppression of gastric acid secretion by H2-receptor blockers, administration of cytoprotective agents, and correction of the underlying stress state. Active bleeding requires accurate diagnosis by gastroscopy. Additional therapy may be necessary, including intra-arterial administration of vasopressin and occasionally surgery. Dieulafoy's lesion is an unusual stress-related cause for upper gastrointestinal bleeding. The area of mucosal injury is minute but underneath lies a large submucosal gastric artery. It can cause massive bleeding and is often missed at initial gastroscopy. The pathogenesis of Dieulafoy's lesion is complex and the mainstay of therapy has been surgical. Ligation of the vessel, wedge resection, or proximal gastric resection is performed. Therapeutic endoscopy with endoscopic cauterization or injection has changed the approach to this lesion. 
Echocardiographic prediction of left ventricular volume after myocardial infarction. Left ventricular volume is a strong determinant of survival after acute myocardial infarction. The aim of this study was to determine which clinical and echocardiographic criteria assessed early after myocardial infarction would predict later left ventricular dilation. Forty-eight patients with uncomplicated transmural myocardial infarction had echocardiography 5 to 10 days after myocardial infarction and assessment of clinical variables including peak creatine kinase and sum of electrocardiographic ST segment elevation. Left ventricular dimensions were measured from the echocardiogram in the parasternal view and also in the apical four and two chamber views at the level of the mitral leaflets, papillary muscles and apex. A cardiac wall motion score was obtained by segmental analysis of the apical views. Echocardiographic left ventricular volume was measured after 1 year from the apical views with use of a Simpson's rule method. Initial clinical and echocardiographic variables were correlated with the left ventricular volume at 1 year. There was a significant relation between the initial four and two chamber end-diastolic dimensions and the left ventricular volume at 1 year, particularly for dimensions measured at the apical level (four chamber R2 = 0.66, p = 0.0001, two chamber R2 = 0.61, p = 0.0001). Other clinical variables, parasternal left ventricular dimensions and cardiac wall motion score were not significantly related to left ventricular volume. A powerful three variable model obtained by multiple regression and including the initial two chamber apical dimension, cardiac wall motion score and body surface area accounted for 82% of the variation in left ventricular volume at 1 year. 
Upbeat and downbeat nystagmus occurring successively in a patient with posterior medullary haemorrhage. In a patient with posterior medullary haemorrhage, first upbeat and later downbeat nystagmus occurred in the primary position. The lesion was limited to the posterior and medial part of the medulla. Clinical and electro-oculographic examination first showed upbeat nystagmus in the primary position and upgaze, with downbeat nystagmus in downgaze. Two and a half months later, there was downbeat nystagmus in the primary position and downgaze and upbeat nystagmus in upgaze. 
Hyperinsulinemia or increased sympathetic drive as links for obesity and hypertension. The association of obesity with hypertension has been amply demonstrated in cross-sectional, longitudinal, and dietary-intervention studies, but the mechanisms remain enigmatic. Both conditions are independently characterized by similar metabolic alterations, i.e., glucose intolerance, dyslipoproteinemia, elevated serum uric acid, and inadequate Na+ transport. Obesity, hypertension, and these metabolic alterations are associated with hyperinsulinemia/insulin resistance. The degree of these alterations is lowest in lean hypertensives, intermediate in obese normotensives, and greatest in obese hypertensives, but mortality risk is highest in lean hypertensives. This apparent discrepancy may be related to the divergent hemodynamic characteristics, possibly indicating different etiology, of lean and obese hypertensives, i.e., contracted blood volume, increased total vascular peripheral resistance, and normal sympathetic drive in the former, expanded blood volume, normal peripheral resistance, and increased sympathetic drive in the latter. Current knowledge suggests that the interrelationships of obesity and hypertension with the metabolic alterations could be mediated by high carbohydrate and fat consumption and low physical activity, resulting in obesity and separate pathways in hyperinsulinemia and increased sympathetic drive, leading to a double vicious cycle. In one, hyperinsulinemia and the consequent insulin resistance would compound one another. In the second, the increasing hyperinsulinemia would increasingly stimulate the sympathetic nervous system. This double vicious cycle could result in increasing hemodynamic and metabolic derangements causing hypertension, diabetes, and atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD). The association of lean hypertension with ASCVD may be through other mechanisms, e.g., hemodynamic forces on the vascular endothelium. 
Can esmolol manage surgically-induced tachycardia? Bolus esmolol treatment of intra-operative tachycardia due to surgical stimulation. A double-blind, randomised study was conducted to examine the efficacy of a single bolus dose of esmolol in treating surgically-induced tachycardia. Anaesthetic technique was identical in all patients, and consisted of premedication with midazolam and glycopyrronium, induction with thiopentone followed by suxamethonium, tracheal intubation, and maintenance with isoflurane 0.6% (end-tidal) and 60% nitrous oxide in oxygen. Forty-eight patients developed a heart rate of greater than 95 beats/minute or 20% more than pre-induction values at an average time of 34 minutes after tracheal intubation and received placebo (15 patients), esmolol 50 mg (16 patients), or esmolol 100 mg (17 patients). Controlled intervention was instituted if heart rate or blood pressure was not adequate. Both 50 and 100 mg of esmolol resulted in lower heart rates compared to placebo (p less than 0.05), with no difference between the two esmolol groups (p greater than 0.05). Patients who received placebo had more episodes of medical intervention than those given esmolol (p less than 0.05). No adverse effects occurred in any patient. 
Inhibition by a new bisphosphonate (AHBuBP) of bone resorption induced by the MBT-2 tumor of mice. A new bisphosphonate, 4-amino-1-hydroxybuthylidene-1,1-bisphosphonate (AHBuBP), was compared with 3-amino-1-hydroxypropylidene-1,1-bisphosphonate (AHPrBP) and 1-hydroxyethylidene-1,1-bisphosphonate (HEBP) in terms of its effect on tumor-induced osteolysis using a bladder tumor in mice (MBT-2). Tumor cells were inoculated subcutaneously (SC) over the calvaria in mice, resulting in a local tumor causing fragmentation of the bone. The tumor-induced osteolysis associated with osteoclasts proliferation was accompanied with reactive new bone formation. This osteolysis was evaluated by measuring the increased area of bone resorption in reduced opacity to radiograph and histologic study. The results showed the following sequence of potency: AHBuBP greater than AHPrBP = HEBP. This inhibition was obtained with no apparent effect on the growth of the MBT-2 tumor. The authors conclude that AHBuBP appears to be an interesting new bisphosphonate with possible clinical application. 
Strategies for diagnosis and treatment of children at risk for occult bacteremia: clinical effectiveness and cost-effectiveness. Decision analysis was used to evaluate the probable health benefits, complications, and costs of six management strategies for febrile children at risk for occult bacteremia. The strategy that combined blood culture with empiric oral antibiotic treatment for all patients was predicted to prevent the highest number of major infections and to have the lowest cost per major infection prevented. The strategy that combined a leukocyte count and blood culture for all patients, followed by empiric antibiotic treatment for those with leukocyte count greater than or equal to 10,000/mm3, had almost equal cost and clinical effectiveness and avoided many antibiotic complications. Culture of blood specimens from all patients and no empiric treatment constituted the third most clinically effective intervention but was the least cost-effective in this model. Giving a 2-day oral course of amoxicillin without testing had the lowest average cost per febrile patient but was the least clinically effective intervention. However, the low degree of effectiveness of empiric treatment alone was based on the assumption that oral amoxicillin therapy was only 20% effective in preventing major infections after bacteremia. At higher estimates of effectiveness, treatment alone became a more viable strategy. We conclude that approaches which combine blood culture with empiric antibiotic treatment are the most clinically effective and the most cost-effective strategies for children at risk for occult bacteremia. 
The consistency of pulse frequencies and pulse patterns of transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) used by chronic pain patients. This study records the consistency of transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) pulse frequency and pulse pattern used by 13 chronic patients over a 1 year period. The results show that patients prefer specific pulse frequencies and pulse patterns unique to the individual and that they turn to such frequencies and patterns on subsequent treatment sessions. Pulse frequencies and pulse patterns were not related to the cause and site of pain, a finding consistent with previous study in this laboratory. This observation, coupled with the large variability in pulse frequencies and pulse patterns used between individuals, implies that patients prefer such frequencies and patterns for reasons of comfort which may not be related to mechanisms specific to the pain system. 
Intensive liver care and management of acute hepatic failure. In describing acute liver failure, the term fulminant hepatic failure (FHF) is used to denote patients with the most rapid progression, normally defined as the onset of encephalopathy within eight weeks of the onset of symptoms. For patients with a slower onset of encephalopathy, ranging from eight weeks to six months after the onset of symptoms, late-onset hepatic failure is the term used to reflect the overlap in clinical features with some patients with FHF. The importance of accurately determining the type of acute liver failure results from increasing evidence of an inverse relationship between the tempo of disease progression and the chances of recovery. Prognosis is also dependent on the underlying etiology. Principles of management are as follows: (1) an accurate recognition of the tempo of the hepatic failure--fulminant, late onset, acute on chronic--and the establishment of a likely etiology; (2) early detection and treatment of complications, particularly metabolic acidosis (early), renal failure, cerebral edema, and infection (late); (3) optimization of conditions for regeneration by maintenance of a near normal metabolic milieu (with removal of toxins by various methods of artificial liver support if necessary); and (4) early consideration of an orthotopic liver transplant for those patients in the poor prognosis group. Variations in the natural history and clinical features of acute liver failure (ALF) have led to a number of different classifications and subgroupings. Knowledge of these is important in relation to the assessment of prognosis and is even more important now that transplantation is a therapeutic option. 
High rate of portal thrombosis after splenectomy in patients with esophageal varices and idiopathic portal hypertension. Data on 126 consecutive patients who were admitted to our clinics from January 1979 to May 1989 were scrutinized to assess changes in portal hemodynamics following splenectomy. Two groups were classified: (1) a group of 106 patients with cirrhosis of the liver and (2) a group of 20 patients with idiopathic portal hypertension (IPH). Portal thrombosis was present in five (25.0%) of the 20 patients with IPH and in two (1.8%) of the 106 patients with cirrhosis of the liver. As seen on celiac arteriography, the mean (+/- SD) diameter of the trunk of the splenic artery and vein was 8.99 +/- 1.55 and 16.2 +/- 3.6 mm, respectively, in patients with IPH, while it was 7.94 +/- 1.28 and 14.2 +/- 3.1 mm, respectively, in patients with cirrhosis of the liver. Changes in portal venous pressure were 78.4 +/- 59.4 mm H2O in patients with IPH and 43.5 +/- 38.7 mm H2O in patients with cirrhosis of the liver. There were no significant differences in the maximum level of thrombocytes in patients with IPH or in those patients with cirrhosis of the liver. These events suggest that portal thrombosis can occur with a significantly higher incidence in patients with IPH than in those patients with cirrhosis of the liver after splenectomy, and a decrease in blood flow in the portal vein may be closely linked to the formation of portal thrombosis after splenectomy in patients with IPH. Preoperative examination of portal hemodynamics must be thorough. 
Functioning insulinoma--incidence, recurrence, and long-term survival of patients: a 60-year study. For the 60-year period from 1927 through 1986, we assessed the incidence, recurrence, and long-term survival among all Mayo Clinic patients with histologically confirmed functioning insulinoma. With use of the complete medical record system at Mayo and the comprehensive epidemiologic data base of residents of Olmsted County, Minnesota, we found 224 patients in whom an initial pancreatic exploration at Mayo had confirmed the presence of insulinoma. The median age (and range) of these patients at surgical diagnosis was 47 (8 to 82) years, and 59% were female patients. During the study period, eight cases of insulinoma occurred among residents of Olmsted County; their age and gender distributions were similar to those of the total cohort. The incidence of insulinoma among residents of Olmsted County increased during the study period to a stable level during the last 2 decades of 4 cases per 1 million person-years. For the total cohort, 7.6% had multiple endocrine neoplasia type I (MEN I), and 5.8% had malignant insulinoma. The risk of recurrence was greater among patients with MEN I (21% at 10 and 20 years) than in those without MEN I (5% at 10 years and 7% at 20 years). Although survival of the total cohort was not significantly impaired, it was significantly worse than expected for patients with malignant insulinoma (29% versus 88% expected at 10 years postoperatively). We conclude that insulinoma is less rare than previously suspected. After successful surgical removal, the long-term risk of recurrent insulinoma is relatively high in patients with MEN I; for patients with benign disease, the long-term survival is normal. 
Bowel perforation and interstitial cystitis in childhood systemic lupus erythematosus. A 13-year-old girl presented with abdominal pain, fever, dysuria, incontinence and pyuria and was subsequently diagnosed as having systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) with extensive gastrointestinal involvement and an associated interstitial cystitis. Despite aggressive therapy with high dose prednisone and cyclophosphamide she developed a small bowel perforation and subsequently died. The combination of bowel symptoms and interstitial cystitis seems unique to the population with SLE, while the separate complication of bowel perforation carries an extremely poor prognosis in this group of patients. 
A comparative analysis of mass transport models in peritoneal dialysis. To better understand the differences in published estimates of peritoneal mass transport coefficients, a comparative analysis of seven mathematical models of peritoneal transport was performed. Uniform investigation involving measurements of solute concentrations and accurate determination of peritoneal dialysate volume was undertaken in twenty-eight 6 hour dwell studies using 3.86% glucose dialysate in non-diabetic patients undergoing continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD). The investigated models were all based on the theory of transport across a homogeneous membrane. Diffusive mass transport coefficients (KBD) calculated during a period of dialysate isovolemia served as reference values in the comparative analysis. The evaluation of models involved calculations of transport coefficients and comparison of calculated dialysate-to-plasma concentration ratios (D/P) with experimental D/P. The best fit of theoretically predicted D/P to experimental D/P was obtained with Pyle-Popovich's model, which accounts for both the diffusive (KBD) and convective (sieving coefficient [S]) characteristics of the peritoneal membrane. Garred's model, assuming S = 1, yielded acceptable results for small solutes (except sodium), whereas Henderson's model, in which convective transport is neglected, proved to be surprisingly accurate for KBD for both small solutes (except sodium) and protein. S values (mean +/- SD) calculated using Pyle-Popovich's model were found to be out of the physically interpretable range for glucose (S = -0.38 +/- 0.48) and potassium (S = 1.57 +/- 0.19), and therefore these S values should be treated as phenomenologic rather than physical quantities. 
A new balanced operation for complex gastroesophageal reflux disease. Twenty-seven patients with advanced gastroesophageal reflux disease have been treated with combined transthoracic parietal cell vagotomy and Collis-Nissen fundoplication. Gastric acid analyses (n = 20) obtained preoperatively and 6 months postoperatively demonstrated a significant late reduction in gastric acid output. Twenty-six patients (96%) have experienced relief of gastroesophageal reflux disease at a mean of 13.3 months (range, 6 to 25 months) without postvagotomy symptoms. Transthoracic parietal cell vagotomy may be considered as an adjunct to mechanical surgical control of advanced gastroesophageal reflux disease. 
Loss of heterozygosity for alleles on chromosome II in cervical carcinoma. The HeLa cell (a cervical carcinoma cell line) tumor-suppressor gene has been localized to the long arm of chromosome 11 by molecular genetic studies of nontumorigenic and tumorigenic hybrids derived from normal chromosome 11 x HeLa cell fusions. In the present study, 33 primary cervical carcinoma samples were analyzed using chromosome 11-specific polymorphic DNA markers. The RFLP analysis indicated a somatic loss of chromosome 11 heterozygosity in 10 (30%) of the primary tumors. Preferential loss of the long arm of the chromosome was observed in two of the primary tumors. In addition, at least eight-fold amplification of sequences in the q13 region, including those coding for the fibroblast growth factor-related gene (int-2), was observed in one of the primary tumors. These results suggest a possible role for gene(s) localized to chromosome 11, possibly that localized to the long arm in the development and/or progression of cervical carcinomas. 
A hepatitis B virus mutant associated with an epidemic of fulminant hepatitis BACKGROUND. A nosocomial outbreak of fulminant hepatitis B occurred in five patients in Haifa, Israel. Previous investigations identified the suspected source as a carrier of hepatitis B surface antigen who was positive for antibodies to hepatitis B e antigen and had chronic liver disease. We examined the strain of hepatitis B virus (HBV) that caused this epidemic, in order to identify specific mutations in the precore or core region. METHODS. The presence of HBV was identified by polymerase-chain-reaction amplification of viral DNA in serum from the source patient, the five patients with fulminant hepatitis B, and five controls with acute, self-limited hepatitis B. The amplified viral HBV DNA samples were then cloned and sequenced. RESULTS. Sequence analysis of viral DNA established that the same HBV mutant with two mutations in the precore region was present in the source patient and the five patients with fulminant hepatic failure. This HBV mutant had significant sequence divergence from other known HBV subtypes in the X, precore, and core regions. Cloned HBV DNA derived from a hospitalized patient who had subclinical hepatitis B at the same time as the outbreak and from four other control subjects with acute, self-limited hepatitis B all contained the wild-type sequence in the precore region. CONCLUSIONS. In the outbreak we studied, a mutant hepatitis B viral strain was transmitted from a common source to five patients who subsequently died of fulminant hepatitis B infection. Naturally occurring viral mutations hepatitis B infection. Naturally occurring viral mutations in the HBV genome may predispose the infected host to more severe liver injury. 
The neurofibroma in von Recklinghausen neurofibromatosis has a unicellular origin. von Recklinghausen neurofibromatosis (NF1) is the most common hereditary syndrome predisposing to neoplasia. NF1 is an autosomal dominant disease caused by a single gene which maps to chromosome 17q11.2. The most common symptomatic manifestation of NF1 is the benign neurofibroma. Our previous studies of tumors in NF1, studies which detected a loss of heterozygosity for DNA markers from the NF1 region of chromosome 17 in malignant tumors, did not detect a loss in neurofibromas. We report here that a more extensive study, including the analysis of neurofibromas from 19 unrelated NF1 patients by using seven probes, failed to detect a single instance of loss of heterozygosity. This finding suggests that neurofibromas are either polyclonal or monoclonal in origin but arise by a mechanism different from that of NF1 malignancies. In order to investigate the first possibility, we analyzed neurofibromas from female NF1 patients by using an X chromosome-specific probe, from the phosphoglycerokinase (PGK) gene, which detects an RFLP. The detected alleles carry additional recognition sites for the methylation-sensitive enzyme HpaII, so that the allele derived from the active X chromosome is digested by HpaII while the one from the hypermethylated, inactive X chromosome is not. We analyzed neurofibromas from 30 unrelated females with NF1. Eight patients were heterozygous for the PGK RFLP. By this assay, neurofibromas from all eight appeared monoclonal in origin. These results suggest that benign neurofibromas in NF1 arise by a mechanism that is different from that of malignant tumors. 
Percutaneous endoscopic jejunostomy in a patient with previous esophagectomy. Establishment of a percutaneous endoscopic jejunostomy via direct jejunal puncture was accomplished in a 45-year-old woman five years after a partial esophagectomy with cervical esophagogastrostomy for adenocarcinoma of the esophagus. The patient had recurrence of the cancer at the anastomotic site with subsequent inability to eat, necessitating a feeding tube for prolonged enteral nutrition. Although percutaneous puncture of the jejunum has been previously described, it has been limited to patients who had undergone partial or complete gastrectomies with Bilroth II anastomoses. This case report of direct endoscopic jejunal tube placement in a patient after esophagectomy further establishes this procedure as a viable alternative to surgically placed feeding tubes in patients with altered gastric anatomy. 
Treatment of migraine attacks with sumatriptan. The Subcutaneous Sumatriptan International Study Group BACKGROUND. The headache in migraine attacks may be caused by dilatation of certain cranial arteries or arteriovenous anastomoses, by neurogenic dural plasma extravasation, or by both of these mechanisms. Sumatriptan, a novel selective agonist of 5-hydroxytryptamine-like receptors, blocks these phenomena. We investigated its efficacy in migraine. METHODS. We studied 639 patients with migraine attacks in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group clinical trial. We assessed the effect of subcutaneous injections of 6 or 8 mg of sumatriptan or placebo on the severity of headache and associated migrane symptoms 30, 60, and 120 minutes after treatment. Patients who were not free of pain after 60 minutes subsequently received placebo if they had initially received placebo or 8 mg of sumatriptan, and 6 mg of sumatriptan or placebo if they had initially received 6 mg of sumatriptan. RESULTS. After 60 minutes, the severity of headache was decreased in 72 percent (95 percent confidence interval, 68 to 76 percent) of the 422 patients given 6 mg of sumatriptan, 79 percent (95 percent confidence interval, 71 to 87 percent) of the 109 patients given 8 mg of sumatriptan, and 25 percent (95 percent confidence interval, 17 to 33 percent) of the 105 patients given placebo (data on 3 patients could not be evaluated). As compared with the placebo group, 47 percent (95 percent confidence interval, 38 to 57 percent) more patients who had received 6 mg of sumatriptan and 54 percent (95 percent confidence interval, 43 to 65 percent) more patients who had received 8 mg of sumatriptan had a decrease in the severity of headache (P less than 0.001 for both comparisons). After 120 minutes, 86 to 92 percent of the 511 patients treated with sumatriptan (202 assigned to 6 mg plus placebo, 203 to 6 mg plus 6 mg, and 106 to 8 mg plus placebo) had improvement in the severity of headache, as compared with only 37 percent of the 104 patients who received placebo once or twice (P less than 0.001 for all comparisons). Twenty-one patients were excluded from the analysis because of missing data (19) or protocol violations (2). The response rates did not differ significantly among the sumatriptan regimens. Adverse events were minor and transient in all groups. CONCLUSIONS. We conclude that a single 6-mg dose of sumatriptan given subcutaneously is a highly effective, rapid-acting, and well-tolerated treatment for migrane attacks. The administration of a second dose 60 minutes later to patients not responding well to an initial dose affords little additional benefit. 
Differential modulation by the stress axis of ethanol withdrawal seizure expression in WSP and WSR mice. Withdrawal from both acute and chronic ethanol (EtOH) exposure is associated with increased neural excitability and increased activity of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis. There is some evidence that glucocorticoids are necessary for EtOH withdrawal seizure expression. Lines of mice that were selected for severe (WSP) and minimal (WSR) EtOH withdrawal (as estimated from handling-induced convulsion scores) have been shown to differ in their stress response following an acute dose of EtOH. In this study we provide evidence that these lines of mice also differ in their sensitivity to the excitatory effects of glucocorticoids. EtOH withdrawal seizures of WSP mice were significantly increased by chronic and acute corticosterone treatment, whereas those of the WSR mice were unaffected. Neural excitability was decreased in the WSP mice when aminoglutethimide, a glucocorticoid synthesis blocker, was administered. Thus, it appears that genetic differences in EtOH withdrawal seizure severity may be due, in part, to differences in sensitivity to the excitatory effects of glucocorticoids. 
Current role of catheter ablative procedures in patients with cardiac arrhythmias. A report for health professionals from the Subcommittee on Electrocardiography and Electrophysiology, American Heart Association. Catheter ablative techniques have assumed an increasingly important role in the treatment of patients with drug-refractory cardiac arrhythmias. Catheter ablation of the AV junction is considered the procedure of choice for management of patients without bypass tracts with drug-resistant supraventricular arrhythmias. Catheter techniques have been used with increasing frequency in attempts to ablate accessory AV tracts. These techniques currently appear to be less effective than surgical techniques but involve less morbidity and expense. In some centers, accessory pathway ablation using catheter techniques is the procedure of first choice in selected patients with drug-refractory tachycardia mediated by an accessory pathway. Catheter ablation of ventricular tachycardia should be reserved for patients with mappable ventricular tachycardia who are not candidates for cardiac electrosurgery or insertion of an automatic defibrillator. The development of more flexible catheters and more manageable energy delivery systems holds promise for more effective catheter techniques. 
A phase I-II trial of induction chemotherapy with carboplatin and fluorouracil in locally advanced head and neck squamous cell carcinoma: a report from the UCL-Oncology Group, Belgium. Eighty-three patients (median age, 56 years and Karnofsky performance status greater than or equal to 70) were treated with carboplatin (Carbo) and fluorouracil (5Fu) for stage III and IV head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC). 5Fu (1 g/m2/d) was administered from day 1 to 4 by continuous infusion. Carbo was given on day 1 and, in order to evaluate its maximum-tolerated dose (MTD), the dose level was progressively increased from 250 mg/m2 to 450 mg/m2. The effectiveness of this association and its potential role in local control were also evaluated. Three patients received Carbo at a dose of 250 mg/m2, 13 received 300 mg/m2, one received 330 mg/m2, 12 received 350 mg/m2, six received 375 mg/m2, 26 received 400 mg/m2, 18 received 420 mg/m2, and four received 450 mg/m2. Two (13 of 83) or three courses (64 of 83), repeated every 4 weeks, were administered. The overall (primary tumor and node) response and complete response (CR) rates were 33% and 14%, respectively. For primary tumor, the response rate (RR) was 57% with 32% CR and 18% pathologic complete response (PCR); the RR was higher for patients with oropharyngeal tumor (76%, P = .037) and for patients treated with Carbo greater than or equal to 350 mg/m2 (65%, P = .02); the tumor size (T1 + T2 v T3 + T4) was a good prognostic factor for RR (90% v 46%, P = .001), CR (65% v 20%, P less than .001), and PCR (45% v 8%, P less than .001). For nodes, the RR was 33% with 11% CR. Grade 3-4 neutropenia and thrombocytopenia were experienced by 17% and 28% of the patients treated with 420 mg/m2 of Carbo and by 50% of the patients treated with 450 mg/m2. The MTD can be fixed at 420 mg/m2 and the proposed dose at 400 mg/m2. Thirty-eight patients were treated with surgery plus radiotherapy, 33 with radiotherapy alone, and seven with surgery alone. The median follow-up is 12 months. The 18-month disease-free survival (DFS) is 78% for overall complete responders and 39% for the others (P = .04). There is no primary tumor recurrence among the 12 patients with a primary tumor PCR treated by radiotherapy alone for tumor control (median follow-up, 17.3 months). The association of Carbo-5Fu is a safe induction chemotherapy regimen for HNSCC. The proposed dose of Carbo for future treatment is 400 mg/m2.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS). 
Induction of apoptosis during normal and neoplastic B-cell development in the bursa of Fabricius. The lymphoid cells of embryonic bursal follicles are engaged in rapid growth and preimmune diversification of immunoglobulin genes. Disruption of follicular architecture by mechanical dispersion of these cells in short-term tissue culture was accompanied by continued cell division and extensive cell death by apoptosis. Apoptosis was suppressed in parallel cultures of intact follicles. gamma Radiation also triggered extensive apoptosis in embryonic bursal follicles within a few hours. Preneoplastic bursal stem cell populations induced by a v-myc oncogene were hypersensitive to induction of apoptosis by follicular dispersion and radiation. In contrast, tumor progression in v-myc- and v-rel-initiated bursal neoplasms was accompanied by development of resistance to induction of apoptosis. A programmed cell death pathway can be activated during normal B-cell development in the bursa, and alterations in the expression of this pathway accompany neoplastic change in this system. 
Simplified formula for the calculation of mitral valve area: potential inaccuracies in patients with tachycardia. A simplified formula (cardiac output/[transvalvular pressure gradient]1/2) has been proposed as an alternative to the Gorlin equation for determining valve area in patients with mitral stenosis. This study was done (a) to assess the relationship between the results of the simplified formula and those of the Gorlin equation in patients with mitral stenosis and (b) to determine the clinical characteristics most likely to be associated with a disparity between the 2 formulae. In 96 patients with mitral stenosis, the disparity between the 2 formulae was greater than 0.2 cm2 in 43 (45%) and greater than or equal to 0.35 cm2 in 21 (22%). The results of the simplified formula were especially likely to be disparate from those of the Gorlin equation in those whose heart rates were greater than 100 beats/minute. Thus, in the patient with mitral stenosis, the simplified formula should be used with caution and cognizance of its potential inaccuracy, particularly if the patient is tachycardic. 
Automated measurement of tumour extent in patients with colorectal liver metastases from X-ray computed tomography. Tumour burden is a significant prognostic factor in patients with colorectal liver metastases, and can be staged according to percentage hepatic replacement (PHR), but accurate measurements of PHR are difficult to obtain. We have used an automated computerized technique to isolate tumour and measure PHR from computed tomography images of 22 patients. Tumour identification was achieved by establishing local histogram-based thresholds at liver-tumour boundaries displaying clear bimodal histogram distributions. There was a significant association between measured PHR and independent visual estimates of PHR stage defined in quartiles (p less than 0.001). When the measured value of PHR differed from the PHR stage, the visual estimate was always higher. The accuracy of PHR measurement was assessed on stimulated liver computed tomography images. It seems likely that visual estimates of PHR from computed tomography images tend to overestimate tumour extent. The automated technique is probably more accurate and will be useful for assessing and monitoring patients. 
Effect of diltiazem on symptomatic and asymptomatic episodes of ST segment depression occurring during daily life and during exercise. BACKGROUND. Silent myocardial ischemia is an adverse prognostic marker in patients with coronary disease; however, controlled data on the effect of treatment are sparse and contradictory, and the relations among the occurrence of ST segment depression, drug efficacy, and heart rate are unclear. METHODS AND RESULTS. Sixty patients with stable coronary artery disease, a positive treadmill exercise test and asymptomatic ST segment depression on ambulatory electrocardiographic recording were assessed in a multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled, cross-over trial. Treadmill exercise tests and 72-hour electrocardiographic recordings were obtained at the end of two 2-week treatment periods with sustained-release diltiazem 180 mg b.i.d. or equivalent placebo. Episodes of asymptomatic ST depression decreased by 50% or more in 70% of the patients from a median number of 4.5 (range, 0-19) to 1.5 (range, 0-13) (p = 0.0001); their cumulative duration also decreased from 78.5 (range, 0-60) to 24.5 (range, 0-411) minutes (p = 0.001). No circadian variation was found in the efficacy of diltiazem. The occurrence of ischemic type ST segment depression was modulated by changes in heart rate rather than by absolute heart rate. Diltiazem also improved exercise test end points but to a lesser extent. Time to ST segment depression increased to 341 +/- 148 from 296 +/- 154 seconds (p = 0.005). Although less frequent with diltiazem administration (45 versus 54 patients, p less than 0.03), exercise-induced ST depression was more often asymptomatic (98% versus 72% of patients, p less than 0.0001). CONCLUSIONS. Diltiazem reduces the frequency and severity of ischemic type ST depression in patients with stable coronary artery disease. 
Relation between nicotine intake and Alzheimer's disease. OBJECTIVE--To study the association between Alzheimer's disease and nicotine intake through smoking. DESIGN--Population based case-control study. SETTING--City of Rotterdam and four northern provinces of The Netherlands. SUBJECTS--198 patients with early onset Alzheimer's disease, 198 controls matched for age and sex, and families of 17 patients in whom Alzheimer's disease was apparently inherited as an autosomal dominant disorder. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES--Age of onset of dementia, relative risk of Alzheimer's disease. RESULTS--89 of 193 patients with Alzheimer's disease had a history of smoking compared with 102 of 195 controls. Among the patients and controls with a family history of dementia, smoking was significantly less common in those with dementia (40/95 with dementia v 55/96 controls; relative risk 0.35; 95% confidence interval 0.16 to 0.78). The risk of Alzheimer's disease decreased with increasing daily number of cigarettes smoked before onset of disease (relative risk 0.3 in those smoking greater than 21/day v 1 in non-smokers). In six families in which the disease was apparently inherited as an autosomal dominant disorder, the mean age of onset was 4.17 years later in smoking patients than in non-smoking patients from the same family (p = 0.03). CONCLUSIONS--These findings suggest an inverse association between smoking and Alzheimer's disease, although smoking cannot be advocated for other health reasons. We speculate that nicotine may have a role in the aetiology of both Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease. 
Internal jugular vein thrombosis after ovulation induction with gonadotropins. An unusual case of ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome complicated by internal jugular vein and mediastinal thrombosis is presented. Hemoconcentration and perhaps immobilization appear to be the most probable causative factors. The patient was successfully treated with heparin anticoagulation. An uneventful twin pregnancy resulted from the stimulation cycle. 
Secondary ischaemia in rabbit skin flaps: the roles played by thromboxane and free radicals. 1. Biochemical mechanisms of ischaemia were investigated in rabbit skin flaps subjected to 2 h of primary ischaemia then, 24 h later, to 4 h of secondary ischaemia. During secondary ischaemia, flaps underwent either total ischaemia (arterial and venous blood supply occluded) or partial ischaemia (vein only occluded). Some of these flaps were treated at the time of reperfusion with the free-radical scavenger superoxide dismutase (EC 1.15.1.1) and/or the thromboxane synthetase inhibitor UK-38,485. 2. After 30 min of reperfusion, superoxide dismutase treatment significantly reduced blood thromboxane levels, elevated during ischaemia. Superoxide dismutase also reduced tissue levels of malonyldialdehyde and xanthine oxidase, indicators of free-radical damage, and restored the depleted tissue levels of superoxide dismutase. 3. UK-38,485 treatment failed to significantly alter any of these tissue free-radical parameters, although this agent significantly reduced blood thromboxane levels. 4. Combined superoxide dismutase plus UK-38,485 treatment was not significantly better than either treatment alone with respect to any parameter. 5. Partial ischaemia led to consistently higher levels of tissue free radicals and blood thromboxane than did total ischaemia. Thus partial ischaemia appears to result in greater free-radical damage than total ischaemia. 6. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that thromboxane acts as a mediator for free-radical damage in the ischaemic changes within the flap. 
Smoking and the risk of first acute myocardial infarction. When analyzing risk factors for first acute myocardial infarction in the Copenhagen City Heart Study, a large prospective population study of 20,000 men and women, smoking was found to influence risk significantly in a dose-dependent manner, the risk increasing 2% to 3% for each gram of tobacco smoked daily. Risk was particularly associated with inhalation, the risk for inhalers being almost twice that of noninhalers. No difference in risk could be demonstrated between various types of tobacco (pipe, cigar/cheroots, or plain and filtered cigarettes). The risk seemed associated with current smoking only, inasmuch as the duration of the smoking habit was not important. Ex-smokers had the same risk as those who had never smoked regardless of duration of smoking and time elapsed since quitting. Relative excess risk was significantly higher in female smokers than in male smokers, and daily alcohol intake appeared to have some protective effect on the risk of first acute myocardial infarction among heavy smokers. 
Myocardial distribution of indium-111-antimyosin Fab in acute inferior and right ventricular infarction: comparison with technetium-99m-pyrophosphate imaging and histologic examination In a postmortem study of a 69-yr-old female patient who had suffered 2 yr previously a non-Q-wave anterior infarction and who had sustained just seven days earlier a left inferior and right ventricular infarction, the distribution of 111In-antimyosin Fab was compared to the results of 99mTc-pyrophosphate imaging and histologic examination. Indium-111-antimyosin Fab imaging could not be performed because of cardiogenic shock. However, postmortem gamma scintillation counting revealed increased activities of antimyosin Fab in the inferoapical and right ventricular infarcted regions in which 99mTc-pyrophosphate positive imagings were observed; in contrast, a histologically confirmed old subendocardial anterior infarction had no definite activity. Thus, the myocardial distribution of 111In-antimyosin Fab corresponded well to the results of 99mTc scintigrams and histologic examinations in a human heart, suggesting that this technique could be useful in vivo for detecting several-day-old myocardial infarction of the right ventricle as well as the left ventricle. Tissue from the 2-yr-old infarction was not identified by this technique. 
Interleukin-2 and spontaneous hypertension. There are conflicting reports with regard to the antihypertensive of interleukin-2 in the spontaneously hypertensive rat. Recently, the original claim of a normalization of arterial pressure in the spontaneously hypertensive rat after a single administration of interleukin-2 has been disputed. Therefore, the present study was performed to determine whether the administration of interleukin-2 was effective in attenuating both the development and maintenance of hypertension in the spontaneously hypertensive rat. Both young prehypertensive spontaneously hypertensive rats and adult spontaneously hypertensive rats with established hypertension received a single subcutaneous dose of 5,000 units/kg human recombinant interleukin-2. Arterial pressure was monitored at weekly intervals in both control and treated animals by the tail-cuff technique. Interleukin-2 administered as a one time single injection had no effect on the development of hypertension in the young animals or on the maintenance of hypertension in the adult animals. Interleukin-2 also was administered as a continuous infusion via osmotic minipumps at dose levels of 5,000 and 50,000 units/kg/wk to both young and adult spontaneously hypertensive rats. Continuous administration of interleukin-2 also had no effect on the development or maintenance of spontaneous hypertension. Therefore, this study firmly demonstrates that interleukin-2 has no effect on the onset or maintenance of hypertension in the spontaneously hypertensive rat. 
The buccinator myomucosal island pedicle flap: anatomic study and case report. The buccinator myomucosal island pedicle flap is a useful means of introducing relatively large amounts of vascularized mucosa into the oral cavity. Using cadaver dissections and clinical cases, the anatomy and clinical relevance of this tissue are defined. Emphasis is placed on the technical caveats and pitfalls of the procedure. 
Cell population depletion associated with fetal alcohol brain damage: mechanisms of BAC-dependent cell loss. Neuronal death is one of the most serious consequences of alcohol exposure during development. Studies described in this paper used a neonatal rat model to address factors affecting neuronal death following alcohol exposure during the period of rapid brain growth, and relate them to possible mechanisms of damage. The profile of blood alcohol concentrations (BACs) is an important variable influencing both brain growth deficits and neuronal death--a smaller daily dose of alcohol can be more damaging than a larger daily dose, if it is consumed in a binge-like pattern that produces relatively higher BACs. Alcohol exposure for a single day also can be damaging, producing both brain growth deficits and neuron loss, if high BACs are obtained. Various brain regions and different neuronal populations within a given brain area exhibit different degrees of vulnerability. Some neuronal loss clearly is a function of cell death due to direct effects of alcohol, while other deficits may be due to either primary or secondary effects of the alcohol insult. In the cerebellum, a maturational or metabolic factor also appears to be involved with alcohol-induced neuronal death. Immunocytochemical studies using a monoclonal antibody against microtubule-associated protein 2 (MAP2) indicated that cerebellar lobules containing Purkinje cells that are in the process of extending dendrites are ones that are more vulnerable to alcohol than lobules containing Purkinje cells that mature later. Alcohol exposure during brain development may be producing neuron attrition in multiple ways, including disruption of membrane integrity, inhibition of protein synthesis or other alterations such as lipid solubility, or by disruption of cytoskeletal elements. 
Kikuchi's necrotising lymphadenitis. Three cases of Kikuchi's necrotizing lymphadenitis without granulocytic infiltration presented to the ENT department as cervical lymphadenopathy with neutropaenia. Differential diagnosis from malignant lymphoma was difficult both clinically and histopathologically. Two recovered spontaneously without treatment within three months, one improved initially but was lost to follow-up after one month. 
Simultaneous assessment of inflammation and epidermal proliferation in psoriatic plaques during long-term treatment with the vitamin D3 analogue MC903: modulations and interrelations. The influence of topical application of MC903, an analogue of 1 alpha,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3, on psoriatic plaques was investigated during a long-term treatment study. The parameters for epidermal growth and for inflammation were assessed on frozen sections using immunohistochemical methods to elucidate their modulations in time and the interrelations between the different cell types involved during treatment with MC903. Biopsies were taken before and after 1, 2, 4 and 12 weeks of treatment. Monoclonal antibodies against the hyperproliferation-associated keratin 16, against cycling nuclei, and against T lymphocytes, B lymphocytes, Langerhans cells and CD14-positive cells were used in combination with a polyclonal antibody against polymorphonuclear leucocyte (PMN)-elastase. The earliest change was a statistically significant decrease in PMN after 1 week of treatment followed by a decline of cycling nuclei after 2 weeks. These changes preceded a decrease of T lymphocytes which occurred after 4 weeks. Keratin 16 content tended to diminish after 4 weeks of treatment. CD14+ cells decreased slightly during the observation period, whereas Langerhans cells tended to increase. No B lymphocytes were found. These results suggest that MC903 influences the number of PMN and epidermal growth rather than the number of T lymphocytes. 
Combination therapy of OK432 and recombinant human interferon alpha A/D on viral myocarditis in mice starting after infection. We investigated the effects of OK432, recombinant human interferon alpha A/D (rIFN alpha A/D) and a combination of these drugs on murine acute myocarditis due to encephalomyocarditis virus. Mice were administered 1 KE of OK432 and 10(4)U/g of rIFN alpha A/D starting 24 hr after viral inoculation for 14 days. The survival rate of mice having the combination therapy was significantly higher than that of untreated mice on day 21 (15 of 20 vs. 6 of 20, P less than .001), whereas the viral titer in the heart, the heart weight/body weight ratio and the scores for myocardial inflammation and necrosis were significantly lower. On the other hand, therapy with OK432 or rIFN alpha A/D individually improved neither the survival rate nor the extent of myocardial damage. The natural killer cell activity in the combination therapy mice on day 3 after infection was significantly increased in comparison with untreated mice (46.2 +/- 5.5 vs. 37.7 +/- 2.8%, P less than .01), and the cytotoxicity of peritoneal macrophages was increased (45.0 vs. 26.7%). Thus, the combination therapy of OK432 and rIFN alpha A/D was more effective than the therapy with OK432 alone or rIFN alpha A/D alone against acute viral myocarditis when the treatment was started early after infection, and the stimulation of host immunologic response by OK432 may be important for this combination therapy. 
Severity of Helicobacter-induced gastric injury correlates with gastric juice ammonia. We postulated that ammonia produced by Helicobacter pylori may contribute to gastric mucosal injury. This hypothesis was evaluated in Helicobacter-positive patients with chronic renal failure in whom a high urea concentration might amplify this phenomenon. Gastric urea and ammonia were measured, and the severity of gastritis was evaluated by counting mononuclear and polymorphonuclear cells. High gastric ammonia and low urea in Helicobacter-positive patients, and the converse in Helicobacter-negative subjects, were observed. There was a significant correlation between gastric ammonia and interstitial polymorphonuclear leukocytes infiltration (P less than 0.05), suggesting a causal link. Eradication of Helicobacter pylori was associated with a decrease of ammonia and an increase of urea (P less than 0.01). The significant correlation between the severity of gastric inflammation and the gastric juice ammonia concentration suggests that ammonia may play a pathogenic role in Helicobacter-associated gastric injury. 
Surgical treatment of carcinoma of the gastric stump. To evaluate retrospectively the surgical treatment of patients with gastric stump cancer following gastrectomy for benign disease, we reviewed 52 patients operated on at the National Cancer Centre, Tokyo, between 1962 and 1988. Resection was carried out in 47 patients (90 per cent) and with curative intent in 36 (69 per cent). Stage distribution was: stage 1, 15 patients; stage 2, 5; stage 3, 9; stage 4, 23. In 36 cases curatively resected, 32 had completion total gastrectomy and four had subtotal resection. An R1 resection was performed in 11 patients and an R2 in 25. We had two hospital deaths and a 5-year survival rate excluding hospital deaths of 39 per cent. The 5-year survival rates of resected cases, curative cases and those having metastatic nodes were 43 per cent, 57 per cent and 29 per cent respectively. Radical resection is a reasonable treatment for gastric stump cancer as it is for primary cancer of the stomach. 
Death by embolization of prosthetic aortic valve. This report describes a case in which a young woman died from embolization of her prosthetic aortic valve. The discussion includes the embolization's association with chronic intravenous narcotism, recurrent bacterial endocarditis, and acute cocaine toxicity. 
Plasma antigen levels of the lipoprotein-associated coagulation inhibitor in patient samples. Human plasma contains an inhibitor of tissue factor-initiated coagulation known as the lipoprotein-associated coagulation inhibitor (LACI) or also known as the extrinsic pathway inhibitor (EPI). A competitive fluorescent immunoassay was developed to measure the plasma concentration of LACI in samples from normal individuals and patients with a variety of diseases. The LACI concentration in an adult control population varied from 60% to 160% of the mean with a mean value corresponding to 89 ng/mL or 2.25 nmol/L. Plasma LACI levels were not decreased in patients with severe chronic hepatic failure, warfarin therapy, primary pulmonary hypertension, thrombosis, or the lupus anticoagulant. Plasma LACI antigen was decreased in some, but not all patients with gram-negative bacteremia and evidence for disseminated intravascular coagulation. Plasma LACI levels were elevated in women undergoing the early stages of labor (29%), in patients receiving intravenous tissue-type plasminogen activator (45%), and in patients receiving intravenous heparin (375%). A radioligand blot of the pre- and post-heparin plasma samples shows the increase to be in a 40-Kd form of LACI. Very low levels of plasma LACI antigen were found in patients with homozygous abetalipoproteinemia and hypobetalipoproteinemia, diseases associated with low plasma levels of apolipoprotein B containing lipoproteins. Following the injection of heparin into one patient with homozygous abetalipoproteinemia, the plasma LACI antigen level increased to a level comparable with that in normal individuals after heparin treatment. 
Altered lipid profile after Kawasaki syndrome. BACKGROUND. Delineation of lipid values in children after Kawasaki syndrome is important because of the predilection of this disease for the coronary arteries. METHODS AND RESULTS. We measured plasma concentrations of total cholesterol, high density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol, and triglycerides using enzymatic methods in 105 patients with a history of Kawasaki syndrome. Measurements were obtained during six time periods: 10 days or less, 11-31 days, 1-3 months, 3-12 months, 1-3 years, and more than 3 years. Total cholesterol was depressed in the first interval (122.0 +/- 19.8 mg/dl, mean +/- SD), but the mean values were normal in all periods after clinical recovery (overall mean, 149.0 +/- 24.0 mg/dl). High density lipoprotein cholesterol was also depressed in the first interval (15.2 +/- 9.9 mg/dl); although high density lipoprotein cholesterol increased significantly with duration since disease onset (p less than 0.001), it remained significantly lower than expected (p less than 0.001), even in the latest interval (47.2 +/- 10.9 mg/dl). Nonfasting triglyceride levels were high (162.5 +/- 63.4 mg/dl) in the first interval and then diminished steadily with time, but this relation did not achieve statistical significance. We compared adjusted lipid levels (z scores) of 46 Kawasaki patients after clinical recovery with those of their parents; patients had similar total cholesterol levels but significantly lower high density lipoprotein cholesterol levels (p = 0.021 for mothers, p = 0.001 for fathers). Mean high density lipoprotein cholesterol after clinical recovery tended to be lower in patients with persistent coronary abnormalities than in those without such lesions (p = 0.085). CONCLUSIONS. Kawasaki syndrome is associated with important abnormalities in lipid metabolism. Continued long-term surveillance of this population is necessary to monitor lipid levels and their relation to future development of coronary atherosclerosis. 
Rheumatoid arthritis in Israeli Jews: shared sequences in the third hypervariable region of DRB1 alleles are associated with susceptibility. Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is known to be associated with class II HLA antigens in most populations, but recent studies in Israeli Jewish patients showed no significant differences in either DR4 or DR1 between patients and controls. In a previous DR4 subset study we found DR4-Dw15 to be associated with susceptibility (RR = 9.2) but this allele occurred in only 12% of the patients. We analyzed all DRB1 genes, using the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and hybridization with allele specific oligonucleotides, in 49 Jewish patients with RA and 40 normal Jewish controls. Six DRB1 alleles that are similar to the prototype DR4-Dw4 (DRB1*0401) appeared to contribute to the risk for developing RA. In addition to DR4-Dw15 (DRB1*0405) 2 other alleles having substitutions in codons 71 only (DR1-Dw1/DRB1*0101, DR4-Dw14.2/DRB1*0408) or in codons 70 and 71 (DRw10/DRB1*1001) gave highly significant relative risks. Together, this group, with valine in position 85, and glycine in codon 86, gave a relative risk of 11.0 (p = 0.0002). Two other alleles with the same sequence in the third hypervariable region (amino acids 67-74) but with valine in codon 86 (DR4-Dw14.1/DRB1*0404) or alanine in 85 and valine in 86 (DR1-Dw20, DRB1*0102) gave a combined risk of 3.6 (p = 0.049). Altogether these 7 alleles with similar sequences in the third hypervariable region accounted for 55.6% of the patients, with an overall relative risk of 8.6 (p = 0.00002). Our results in this population indicate that shared epitopes in the third hypervariable region of DRB1 alleles also play a role in susceptibility to RA. 
Transesophageal echocardiography in the detection of potential cardiac source of embolism in stroke patients. To compare the diagnostic yields of transesophageal and transthoracic echocardiography in the detection of potential cardiac sources of embolism, 63 patients (mean +/- SD age 63 +/- 15 [range 18-87] years) with transient ischemic attacks or stroke underwent both procedures. Transthoracic echocardiography revealed a potential cardiac source of embolism in 14% (nine) of the patients, all of whom had clinical evidence of heart disease. Transesophageal echocardiography revealed a potential cardiac source of embolism in 41% (26) of the patients; 27% (seven) of these patients had no clinical cardiovascular abnormalities. Abnormalities detected only by transesophageal echocardiography in the patients with unsuspected cardiac disease included atrial septal aneurysm in two, patent foramen ovale in two, left atrial appendage thrombus in one, and myxomatous mitral valve in two. The 26 patients with an identified cardiac source of embolism were older (67.5 versus 59.4 years, p = 0.04), more frequently in atrial fibrillation (62% [16] versus 8% [3], p less than 0.0001), had a larger left atrium (43 versus 37 mm, p = 0.01) and more commonly had left ventricular hypertrophy (62% [16] versus 32% [12], p less than 0.02) than the 37 patients in whom no cardiac source of embolism was identified. Thus, transesophageal echocardiography is more sensitive than transthoracic echocardiography in the detection of potential cardiac sources of embolism in patients with cerebral ischemic events. 
Paediatric blood pressure and anaesthesia. One percent of children have appreciably and consistently raised arterial blood pressure. A 7-year-old girl admitted for routine tonsillectomy, had unrecognised hypertension which put her at increased risk. Should anaesthetic practice take more note of paediatric blood pressures?. 
The quantitative study of lumbar vertebral bone marrow using T1 mapping and image analysis techniques: methodology and preliminary results. A method of quantifying lumbar vertebral bone marrow using pixel by pixel T1 mapping of spin echo magnetic resonance images is described. The accuracy and precision of the relaxation time measurements is confirmed by studies with the EEC Concerted Research Project, test object no. 5. The T1 data from all the pixels sampled from lumbar vertebral marrow are displayed as a histogram. By "thresholding" relative to normal control data the spatial distribution of high or low T1 pixels can be demonstrated. The approach is superior to that of the conventional region of interest method for quantifying and analysing relaxation time data, and allows tissue heterogeneity to be studied. Studies in patients with aplastic anaemia and acute leukaemia have been performed. 
Effect of enteric pacing on intestinal motility and hormone secretion in dogs with short bowel. The present study was designed to examine the role of electrode position during retrograde pacing in dogs with short bowel syndrome and unsevered intact duodenum. In nine beagle dogs a subtotal resection of the small bowel and jejunoileostomy was performed. In five of these dogs, an isolated blind loop (jejunum) with preserved mesenteric connections was left in situ as an additional place for a stimulation electrode. Small intestinal motility and plasma levels of insulin, glucagon, gastrin, somatostatin, and glucose were examined during pacing of the residual jejunum or the isolated loop, respectively, compared with control experiments in the same dogs without pacing. During pacing of the loop a significant (P less than 0.05-0.01) decrease in the postprandial small intestinal motility index was observed combined with a significant (P less than 0.05) increase in plasma insulin levels, whereas the postprandial increase in glucagon, somatostatin, gastrin, and glucose levels was not different from that in controls. In contrast, pacing of the jejunum increased postprandial small intestinal motility index (less than or equal to 68%), whereas the levels of the four hormones and plasma glucose were not different from those in controls. The data suggest that in dogs with intact duodenum, pacing on an excluded loop is required to obtain the desired effect of reduced intestinal motility and improved anabolic pancreatic hormone secretion. 
Non-typhoid Salmonella in renal transplant recipients: a report of twenty cases and review of the literature. We report 20 cases of non-typhoid Salmonella infection that occurred over a period of 10 years in 592 renal transplant recipients followed by our unit, and present a review of 58 previously reported cases. Analysis of these data suggests that infection occurs when immunosuppression is high (early in the post-transplant period, or after anti-rejection therapy). A significant number of patients have bacteraemia and widespread focal manifestations are common. Despite prolonged antibiotic therapy, relapses occur commonly causing significant morbidity, occasional graft loss and even death. 
Systemic, splanchnic and renal hemodynamic effects of a dopaminergic dose of dopamine in patients with cirrhosis. The effects of dopamine on kidney function have not been elucidated in patients with cirrhosis. Moreover, although increased portal pressure has been observed with supradopaminergic doses of dopamine in these patients, the splanchnic hemodynamic effects of low doses of dopamine have not been previously studied. Thus we studied the acute systemic, splanchnic and renal hemodynamic effects of a dopaminergic dose of dopamine (1.5 micrograms/kg body wt min) in nine cirrhotic patients. Plasma dopamine levels increased markedly from 35 +/- 20 pg/ml to 31,400 +/- 4,900 pg/ml during dopamine administration. A significant diastolic pressure decrease of 10% was associated with a 15% increase in heart rate. Cardiac output was not altered. Although dopamine significantly increased azygos blood flow by 16%, wedged and free hepatic venous pressures were not altered. Dopamine significantly increased renal blood flow by 31%, but did not change the glomerular filtration rate. We conclude that a dopaminergic dose of dopamine increases azygos blood flow but not the hepatic venous pressure gradient. Finally, although it increases renal blood flow, dopamine does not seem to have any beneficial effects on glomerular filtration rate in cirrhotic patients. 
Effects of the angiotensin I converting enzyme inhibitor perindopril on cerebral blood flow in awake hypertensive rats. As chronic hypertension shifts the lower limit of cerebral blood flow (CBF) autoregulation to higher pressure levels, we studied the effects of the angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor, perindopril on mean arterial pressure (mean BP), basal CBF, and CBF autoregulation in awake renovascular hypertensive (2 kidneys, 1 clip model) and spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR). Blood pressure was measured via a chronically implanted arterial cannula and CBF by hydrogen clearance. Chronic renovascular hypertension, like spontaneous hypertension, caused a marked shift in the lower limit of CBF autoregulation but did not alter basal CBF. In SHR, acute administration of perindopril did not diminish CBF in spite of the fact that BP fell to a level below the lower limit of CBF autoregulation (determined by hypotensive hemorrhage). Chronic treatment of renovascular hypertensive rats with perindopril normalized BP and restored CBF autoregulation. 
Ischemic injury to the spinal cord or lumbosacral plexus after aorto-iliac reconstruction. Between January 1, 1980, and June 30, 1989, 9 patients (6 males and 3 females) developed ischemic injury to the spinal cord or lumbosacral plexus following 3,320 operations on the abdominal aorta (0.3%). The incidence of this complication was 0.1% (2 of 1,901) after elective and 1.4% (3 of 210) after emergency abdominal aortic aneurysm repair, and 0.3% (4 of 1,209) after repair for occlusive disease. Three of the latter had prior clinical evidence of distal embolization. Eight grafts were bifurcated (aorto-iliac:four, aorto-femoral: three, aorto-ilio-femoral:one). One patient underwent extra-anatomic revascularization. Only two patients had supraceliac aortic cross-clamping and one patient underwent exclusion of both internal iliac arteries. Four patients had hypotension. Early mortality was 22% (two of nine). Severe perioperative complications, mostly due to associated visceral and somatic ischemia and sepsis, were present in seven of the nine patients. The extent and type of the neurologic injury correlated with long-term outcome. Patients with ischemic injury of the lumbosacral roots or plexus had better recovery. Attention to the pelvic circulation and the collateral blood supply is important. Use of gentle technique to prevent embolization, avoidance of hypotension and prolonged supraceliac cross-clamping, revascularization of at least one internal iliac artery, and the use of heparin may decrease but not eliminate paraplegia. Once this unexpected complication occurs, careful neurologic evaluation should be done to localize the lesion and aid prognosis. 
Validation of in vivo receptor measurements via in vitro radioassay: technetium-99m-galactosyl-neoglycoalbumin as prototype model Hepatic binding protein (HBP) is a hepatocyte-specific receptor for serum asialoglycoproteins. The receptor also recognizes a synthetic glycoprotein that has been developed as a radiopharmaceutical, technetium-99m-galactosyl-neoglycoalbumin (99mTc-NGA). This report describes the correlation between receptor parameters measured in vivo via kinetic modeling of 99mTc-NGA and those measured by in vitro radioassay of biopsied liver tissue. Eleven patients with diffuse hepatic disease underwent percutaneous liver biopsy followed by a 99mTc-NGA functional imaging study. In vivo measurements of HBP quantity Ro and forward binding rate constant kb obtained from the kinetic analysis of 99mTc-NGA liver and blood time-activity data were compared to total receptor quantity and the HBP-99mTc-NGA association constant KA as measured by Scatchard binding assay of the biopsied tissue. The correlation coefficients between in vivo and in vitro measurements were 0.73 (df = 8, p = 0.015) and 0.98 (df = 8, p less than 0.01) for Ro and kb, respectively. The in vivo measurements of HBP biochemistry via kinetic analysis of the radiopharmaceutical time-activity data reflect the average concentration and affinity of the receptor. This study further substantiates the validity of 99mTc-NGA as a quantitative probe for the HBP receptor. 
Abnormal cerebral glucose metabolism in long-term survivors of childhood acute lymphocytic leukemia. Chemotherapy and radiation treatment of the central nervous system may cause delayed neurotoxicity in children with acute lymphocytic leukemia. We evaluated 12 long-term survivors of childhood leukemia using [18F]fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography, computed tomography scans, clinical neurological examinations, and neuropsychological tests. Regional cerebral metabolic rate for glucose (rCMRGlc) values for white matter were lower in the older long-term survivors (greater than 18 years old) treated with cranial radiation and intrathecal chemotherapy than in normal control subjects or survivors who had been treated with intrathecal chemotherapy alone. The ratio of white matter: cortex rCMRGlc values was lower than control values in the long-term survivors treated with cranial radiation and intrathecal chemotherapy, regardless of age, but not in those treated with intrathecal chemotherapy alone. By contrast, thalamic rCMRGlc values were lower than control values in older survivors regardless of treatment, and the ratio for thalamus:cortex rCMRGlc values was lower in all the treatment groups than in the control subjects. The highest rCMRGlc values were found in the youngest children, indicating an important effect of age on cerebral glucose metabolism. No neuropsychological deficits were identified in patients treated only with intrathecal chemotherapy; however, lower IQ scores were found in the long-term survivors who had been treated with cranial radiation and intrathecal chemotherapy. Treatment of the central nervous system with cranial radiation and intrathecal chemotherapy may cause prolonged alterations in white-matter and thalamic rCMRGlc, which may permit the identification and assessment of neurotoxicity in long-term survivors of acute lymphocytic leukemia by [18F]fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography. 
Effect of cyclosporine and steroids on canine bile flow. Cyclosporine and hydrocortisone are the main immunosuppressants used in transplant surgery. The purpose of this study was to determine the effect of intravenous administration of cyclosporine and hydrocortisone on bile flow in dogs. Cyclosporine in doses of 0.5, 1.0 and 1.5 mg.kg-1.hr-1 were administered along with 18 mumol/min intravenous sodium taurocholate to dogs with chronic biliary and gastric fistulas. Bile volume and bile chloride concentration and output were increased by cyclosporine in a dose-related manner, whereas bile salt concentration decreased and bile salt output was unchanged. Hydrocortisone produced small but significant increases in bile flow only at the highest dose of hydrocortisone administered. Subsequently, experiments were performed when sodium taurocholate was administered in progressively increasing doses (9, 18 and 36 mumol/min), with the dose changed every hour. Bile volume, [14C]erythritol clearance in bile and bile salt concentrations were measured with and without cyclosporine and hydrocortisone administration. Cyclosporine increased the bile salt-independent fraction of canalicular bile flow and ductular bile flow. Experiments evaluating the role of the cyclosporine carrier polyoxyethylated castor oil (Cremophor EL) demonstrated that this substance had no independent choleretic activity, whereas cyclosporine dissolved in ethanol and administered without Cremophor EL significantly increased bile flow. The results of this study indicate that cyclosporine stimulates chloride-rich choleresis independent of bile salt secretion. 
Cavernomas of the central nervous system: clinical and neuroimaging manifestations in 47 patients. Forty seven cases of central nervous system cavernous angioma (21 males and 26 females) are described. The main clinical signs were epilepsy and brainstem syndromes. Digital subtraction intra-arterial angiography, when used, failed to reveal cavernoma. CT detected many of the lesions, but the most successful supplementary diagnostic procedure was MRI which produces highly characteristic images of cavernous angioma. The diagnosis of cavernous angioma was confirmed in the 18 cases in which the tumour was removed surgically. 
Nicardipine and vascular hypertrophy. The effects of nicardipine administration on the morphology of coronary, renal, and pulmonary vascular trees were studied in spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHRs). Male 10-week-old SHRs received 1 mg/kg/day of nicardipine or vehicle orally for 12 weeks. Age-matched Wistar-Kyoto rats were used as normotensive reference animals. Blood pressure, heart weight, heart/body weight ratio, the area occupied by the medial layer, and area occupied by the vascular wall/area of lumen ratio increased significantly (p less than 0.001) in SHRs compared with normotensive Wistar-Kyoto rats. Nicardipine reduced blood pressure, as well as relative heart weight, the area occupied by vascular smooth muscle, and the area occupied by the vascular wall/area of lumen ratio. In addition, the size of laminae of smooth muscle of the pulmonary artery was reduced in nicardipine-treated SHRs; coronary artery branches were the most sensitive. The results of the study provide direct evidence that nicardipine reduces not only blood pressure but is also able to counteract the development of hypertension-dependent changes in the morphology of the cardiovascular system. 
Lung function in school-age children who had mild lower respiratory illnesses in early childhood. We examined the relationship between patterns of mild lower respiratory illness (LRI) experienced in early childhood and lung function in 89 boys and 70 girls 6 to 18 yr of age. The children's histories of outpatient visits for wheezing and nonwheezing LRI during the first 6 yr of life had been documented by physicians in a single pediatric practice. Most children were reported by their parents to have been free of recurrent respiratory symptoms during the 2 yr prior to lung function testing. In sex-specific analyses, average lung function assessed by spirometry was similar in children who had made zero or one physician visit for wheezing LRI during the preschool years. Boys who had experienced two or more episodes of wheezing LRI during the preschool years had lower average FEV1, FEV1/FVC, FEF25-75, Vmax50, and Vmax75 than did boys who had zero or one preschool wheezing illness. The association between recurrent preschool wheezing LRI and later lung function remained after exclusion of data from seven boys who were reported to have wheezed in the 2 yr prior to study. Girls who had experienced two or more preschool wheezing LRI had lower average FEF25-75 and Vmax50 than girls with a history of zero or one such illness, but differences were not statistically significant. Recurrent nonwheezing LRI during the preschool years was not significantly associated with subsequent lung function in either sex, regardless of preschool wheezing LRI history. Detailed information concerning early childhood LRI experience is valuable in epidemiologic studies of factors influencing lung function in children. 
Renal arteriolar diameters in spontaneously hypertensive rats. Vascular cast study. The relation between the arteriolar diameters and hypertensive glomerulosclerosis was studied by using microvascular casts and histological evaluation. Spontaneously hypertensive rats 4 weeks of age were divided into three groups: nontreated, captopril (40 mg/kg/day)-treated, and trichlormethiazide (1 mg/kg/day) with hydralazine (20 mg/kg/day)-treated. Wistar-Kyoto rats served as controls. At 6 weeks old, the captopril-treated rats showed a lower blood pressure and a larger afferent arteriolar diameter compared with the control rats. At 20 weeks old, the nontreated group exhibited hypertension and a lower arteriolar diameter ratio (afferent to efferent, 0.89 versus 1.22 in control group) because of afferent constriction and efferent dilatation, seen equally in the outer and inner cortexes. Glomerulosclerosis was accentuated only in the inner cortex of the nontreated group (score, 63 versus 29 in control group). In the two treated rat groups, the blood pressure was reduced and arteriolar diameter ratios were similar to those in the control group (1.18 and 1.26). The sclerosis score in the trichlormethiazide with hydralazine-treated rats (score, 26) was lower than in the nontreated rats but not the captopril-treated rats (score, 36). These results indicated that 1) in the hypertensive rats, despite a reduced diameter ratio, glomerulosclerosis was more severe in the inner cortex; 2) two therapies reduced blood pressure and reversed the arteriolar changes, but a decrease in glomerulosclerosis was seen only in the trichlormethiazide with hydralazine-treated rats; and 3) for development of glomerulosclerosis, factors other than hemodynamics may be important in addition to intraglomerular pressure. 
An overview of venous thromboembolism prophylaxis. This symposium reviewed the risk factors and problems associated with venous thromboembolism in surgical patients, especially those patients having total hip replacement. The importance of venous thromboembolism prophylaxis was emphasized by a theoretical analysis indicating that venous thromboembolism in patients having hip replacement not only saves lives but is also effective. A discussion of the pharmacology of low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) included a review of its role, clinically and experimentally, in venous thromboembolism prophylaxis. Three of the discussants presented their favorable experiences with LMWH in reducing the incidence of venous thromboembolism in patients having hip replacement. It can be concluded that LMWH does reduce the incidence of venous thromboembolism in patients having hip replacement without causing an increase in blood loss. If its effectiveness and safety remain substantiated, LMWH may soon become the preferred agent for venous thromboembolism prophylaxis. 
Nasalis myocutaneous sliding flap: repair of nasal supratip defects. The nasalis myocutaneous sliding flap ("nasalis flap") is an axial island flap based on the branch of the angular artery that supplies the nasalis muscle. The technique for performing this flap for the repair of defects up to 1.5 cm in diameter on the supratip area of the nose is described in detail. Twenty-four cases with supratip defects following Mohs surgery repaired with the nasalis flap are reported. Flap survival was 100% and final cosmetic results were excellent. It is concluded that the nasalis flap should always be considered for the repair of defects of the supratip area of the nose. 
Coronary vasospasm secondary to labetalol in a patient with aortic dissection. A 66-year-old hypertensive woman presented with epigastric and scapular pain on the basis of type 3 aortic dissection. Appropriate therapy with a combined alpha-adrenergic and beta-adrenergic antagonist agent prevented further ongoing dissection and amelioration of symptoms. On day 5, an episode of coronary vasospasm occurred presumably due to beta-blockade with unopposed alpha-adrenergic activity. 
Cutaneous and subcutaneous leiomyosarcoma: a clinicopathological review of 14 cases with reference to antidesmin staining and nuclear DNA patterns studied by flow cytometry. Among 14 patients (11 female and three male) with cutaneous and subcutaneous leiomyosarcomas, metastatic spread occurred in six of the 13 patients with adequate follow-up. The tumours were classified with regard to tumour grade, number of mitotic figures per 10 high-power fields, reactivity to antidesmin antibodies, and DNA pattern as assessed by flow cytometry. Antidesmin antibody staining was present in only six cases and seemed to be less common in the higher-grade tumours. The DNA pattern was aneuploid in five cases and non-classifiable in one case; all of these cases had metastatic spread. None of the eight remaining diploid cases had metastatic spread. DNA content was a strong predictor of metastatic potential. 
Biochemical liver profile in hemochromatosis. A survey of 100 patients. To determine the frequency of liver profile abnormalities in hereditary hemochromatosis, we under took a retrospective survey in 100 patients, all of whom had undergone liver biopsy. Liver histology was compared with the biochemical profile, which included aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), alkaline phosphatase, bilirubin and albumin determinations. Mild abnormalities in the AST and ALT levels were seen in more than 65% of patients. Patients with cirrhosis had significantly greater elevations in AST, ALT, and alkaline phosphatase, and a significant decrease in albumin (p less than 0.05). Proband cases had more frequent abnormalities than discovered cases within families. Accordingly, we find that mild abnormalities in the biochemical liver profile are common in hemochromatosis and suggest that patients with an unexplained abnormality in the liver profile should be screened for hemochromatosis with a serum ferritin and transferrin saturation. 
Petrosal sinus sampling with and without corticotropin-releasing hormone for the differential diagnosis of Cushing's syndrome BACKGROUND. Measurement of adrenocorticotropin levels in plasma from the inferior petrosal sinuses of patients with Cushing's syndrome can distinguish adrenocorticotropin-secreting pituitary tumors (Cushing's disease) from other causes of the syndrome, principally ectopic adrenocorticotropin secretion from an occult tumor. However, it is unknown whether such measurement consistently identifies patients with Cushing's disease and whether testing with corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) enhances the value of the procedure. METHODS. We prospectively studied 281 patients with Cushing's syndrome to evaluate the diagnostic efficacy of the procedure. Bilateral sampling was successfully accomplished in 278 patients, with no major morbidity; 262 of these patients underwent sampling before and after administration of ovine CRH. The adrenocorticotropin levels in the samples were used to calculate the ratio of the concentration in plasma from the inferior petrosal sinuses to the concentration in peripheral-blood plasma (the IPS:P ratio). RESULTS. The diagnosis of 246 patients was confirmed surgically as Cushing's disease in 215, as ectopic adrenocorticotropin syndrome in 20, and as primary adrenal disease in 11. An IPS:P ratio greater than or equal to 2.0 in basal samples identified 205 of the 215 patients with Cushing's disease (sensitivity, 95 percent), with no false positive results (specificity, 100 percent). A peak IPS:P ratio greater than or equal to 3.0 after CRH administration identified all 203 of the patients with Cushing's disease who received CRH (sensitivity, 100 percent), with no false positive results (specificity, 100 percent). The sensitivity was much lower when the adrenocorticotropin concentrations in the samples from one sinus were considered alone. In patients with Cushing's disease a difference of greater than or equal to 1.4-fold between the concentrations in the two sinuses (the adrenocorticotropin gradient) predicted the location of the microadenoma in 68 percent of 104 patients during basal sampling and in 71 percent of 105 patients after CRH administration. CONCLUSIONS. Simultaneous bilateral sampling of plasma from the inferior petrosal sinuses, with the adjunctive use of CRH, distinguishes patients with Cushing's disease from those with ectopic adrenocorticotropin secretion with high diagnostic accuracy. 
HIV-1 infection complicated by food allergy and allergic gastroenteritis: a case report. A 34-year-old female with HIV-1 infection detected by positive serology in 1983 subsequently developed acute granulomatous interstitial pneumonitis, eosinophilic gastroenteritis, and angioedema associated with the ingestion of vanilla ice cream and tangerines. The enteritis and angioedema symptoms appeared to respond to large doses of oral sodium cromoglycate. Sera collected over several years before clinical symptoms revealed a sharp rise of IgE antibody in 1985 and a subsequent decline to baseline values followed by markedly increased levels of IgE antibodies to a number of inhalant and food allergens. The findings suggest disordered IgE antibody regulation as a consequence of HIV-1 infection and as a cause of allergic manifestations including eosinophilic gastroenteritis and food-induced angioedema. 
Hereditary angioneurotic edema in the puerperium. A case report. Hereditary angioneurotic edema is a potentially fatal condition. Below is described the first reported case of the initial presentation of the condition precipitated by vaginal delivery. 
Effect of beta-blockade on low heart rate-related ischemia during mental stress. To explore the effect of beta-adrenergic blockade on low heart rate-related (mental stress) ischemia, 19 patients with coronary artery disease were randomized into a double-blind crossover trial of metoprolol, 100 mg twice daily, and underwent serial mental stress/bicycle exercise studies. Mental stress-induced wall motion abnormalities occurred at a lower heart rate than exercise-induced wall motion abnormalities during placebo administration (81 +/- 16 vs. 123 +/- 20 beats/min, p less than 0.05). Metoprolol reduced the mean magnitude of exercise-induced wall motion abnormalities (2.8 +/- 2.0 vs. 1.6 +/- 2.4, p = 0.003); improvement was related to the magnitude of hemodynamic beta-blockade effect. Metoprolol did not significantly reduce the mean magnitude of mental stress-induced wall motion abnormalities (3.0 +/- 2.2 vs. 2.6 +/- 2.2), although individual responses predominantly either improved (50%) or worsened (29%). Unlike exercise, the magnitude of hemodynamic beta-blockade did not predict mental stress response and metoprolol did not block mental stress-induced blood pressure elevations. Patients with abolition of exercise-induced ischemia were more likely to have reduction of mental stress-induced ischemia. Patients whose ischemia worsened with metoprolol during mental stress had more easily inducible ischemia, as assessed by exercise-induced placebo wall motion abnormality, chest pain and prior myocardial infarction. Beta-blockade was associated with a lowering of ischemia-related hemodynamic thresholds compared with placebo. These results suggest that beta-blockade has a variable effect on low heart rate-related ischemia that may be due to a lack of effect on mental stress-induced blood pressure elevation in patients with easily induced ischemia or to effects on coronary vasomotor tone, or both. 
Coronary-subclavian steal: correction of recurrent angina and cerebrovascular symptoms. Six months following aortic valve replacement and myocardial revascularization using the left internal mammary artery as a pedicle graft, recurrent angina and cerebrovascular symptoms occurred in our patient. Cardiac catheterization demonstrated a subtotal stenosis of the proximal left subclavian artery and a patent internal mammary artery graft with angiographic steal from the myocardium. The angina and cerebrovascular symptoms were relieved with correction of the proximal subclavian stenosis by balloon angioplasty. This demonstrates the importance of aortic arch and subclavian evaluation and selected angiography prior to myocardial revascularization using the internal mammary artery as a pedicle graft. 
Anterior mediastinal tumor of 30 years' duration. A 67-year-old woman had a large mediastinal mass with calcification. On roentgenogram of 30 years ago, the same mass without calcification was seen. The mediastinal mass was removed by surgery and proved to be a non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL), most probably as a transition from a giant lymph node hyperplasia (Castleman's disease). 
Mass closure of the abdominal wound with delayed absorbable suture in surgery for gynecologic cancer. There has been a resurgence of interest recently in the optimal method of closure of the midline abdominal wound. The focus has been on the high-risk patient in particular. The controversy centers on interrupted versus continuous fascial closure and the choice of suture material. For three years on a gynecologic cancer service, running mass closure with delayed absorbable suture (Polyglactin) was used. Two hundred fifty-six patients were evaluable for analysis. The minimum follow-up time was two years. There was no wound dehiscence. Fourteen patients (5.5%) developed incisional hernias. The mass closure technique using delayed absorbable suture was effective in very-high-risk patients. 
Peritonsillar abscess: risk of disease in the remaining tonsil after unilateral tonsillectomy a chaud. The occurrence of disease in the remaining tonsil after unilateral tonsillectomy a chaud in the treatment of peritonsillar abscess, was studied in 536 patients. No patient had a history of previous severe tonsillitis at the time of the unilateral tonsillectomy, 6.1 per cent of the patients were readmitted for surgery of the remaining tonsil during the follow-up period. Ninety-seven per cent of these patients were younger than 30 years of age. Previous investigations have shown increasing frequency by age of pharyngitis after bilateral tonsillectomy. We suggest bilateral tonsillectomy in all cases of patients younger than 30 years old who suffer from peritonsillar abscess irrespective of previous tonsillar disease. Patients older than 30 should be treated with unilateral ablation, unless there is a clear indication for bilateral tonsillectomy. 
Anti-tumor effect of L-methionine-deprived total parenteral nutrition with 5-fluorouracil administration on Yoshida sarcoma-bearing rats. L-methionine-deprived total parenteral nutrition (methionine-deprived TPN), infusing amino acid solution devoid of L-methionine and L-cysteine by the method of TPN as an only protein source, showed enhancement of the effect of several anti-cancer agents. In this study the combined effect of the methionine-deprived TPN with administration of 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) was examined in Yoshida Sarcoma (YS)-bearing rats, from aspects of effects on the tumor metastasis and the host animal's life span, in the following four groups treated with: methionine-deprived TPN with administration of 5-FU, methionine-deprived TPN without administration of 5-FU, L-methionine-contained TPN plus 5-FU, and L-methionine-contained TPN without 5-FU. In the first experiment, TPN was continued for 8 days in the four groups, and the anti-cancer effect of methionine-deprived TPN and administration of 5-FU based on both the growth of the primary tumor at the implanted site and the tumor metastasis was studied from the view point of pathologic findings of animals killed immediately after these treatments. In experiment 2 the survival period was examined after these treatments for 10 days with subsequent oral feeding until death. The results were as follows: proliferation of YS, transplanted subcutaneously, was markedly suppressed; particularly hematogenous metastasis, characteristic in YS, was prominently blunted then obtained an apparent longer survival period in rats treated with the methionine-deprived TPN with administration of 5-FU. 
Remodeling of heart and arteries by chronic converting enzyme inhibition in spontaneously hypertensive rats. Hemodynamic and structural changes of the heart and large arterial vessels were studied in normotensive and spontaneously hypertensive rats following 12 weeks administration of converting enzyme inhibitor (perindopril, 2 mg/kg daily by gavage). In both strains, a significant blood pressure reduction was observed. In normotensive rats, the hemodynamic changes involved significant increase in systemic arterial compliance whereas slight changes in left ventricular weight and aortic medial thickness were observed. In hypertensive rats, the increase in compliance was relatively small, whereas there was a major reduction in medial thickness. Furthermore, the reduction of the media thickness was much more pronounced than that of the left ventricular hypertrophy. The present results suggest that the cardiac and arterial changes observed following long term converting enzyme inhibition do not strictly parallel the blood pressure changes in hypertensive rats. Dissociation between cardiac and arterial changes may be observed. 
Cardiovascular and metabolic characteristics of hypertension. Hypertension is now seen as a broader condition than high blood pressure alone. Large-scale epidemiologic studies have established that high blood pressure is associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular events, but clinical trials of antihypertensive therapy have shown an inconsistent reduction in major cardiovascular endpoints. Importantly, the incidence of coronary disease has been reduced to only a small extent, suggesting that factors beyond high blood pressure are important in the genesis of atherosclerotic disease in hypertensive patients. It is evident, for example, that patients with hypertension have an exaggerated vulnerability to the consequences of lipid abnormalities. Moreover, it has recently been established that hypertension is characterized by insulin resistance and altered glucose tolerance. As a result, high plasma concentrations of insulin produce proliferative effects on vascular smooth muscle and connective tissue, and they may adversely affect the lipid profile. The left ventricle is also involved in hypertension--independent of blood pressure. There is growing evidence that there are increases in the muscle mass of the left ventricle and changes in its diastolic filling characteristics at the very early stages of hypertension. The arterial circulation is similarly involved, for alterations in structure or function, reflected by diminished arterial compliance, can be demonstrated prior to the appearance of clinical hypertension. Treatment designed to protect hypertensive patients from cardiovascular events must not only be based on blood pressure, but must take into account all the components of the hypertension syndrome. 
Intraspinal neurothekeoma (nerve sheath myxoma). A report of two cases. Neurothekeomas (nerve sheath myxomas) are rare benign cutaneous tumors. The authors describe two spinal intradural cases that show histologic, immunohistochemical, and electron microscopic features identical to their cutaneous counterparts. The authors' findings suggest histogenesis from Schwann's cells or undifferentiated nerve sheath precursor cells. Neurothekeomas in unusual locations should be differentiated from myxoid neurofibromas, perineuriomas, and soft tissue myxomas. 
A 2-year experience with the Wolf piezoelectric lithotripter: impact of repeat treatment on results and complications. During a 2-year period, 884 extracorporeal piezoelectric lithotripsy treatments have been performed on stones in 388 renal units (kidney and upper ureter) using a Wolf Piezolith device.* Lithotripsy routinely was performed on an outpatient basis without use of anesthesia or premedication. Often, the maximum number of pulses allowable by a Food and Drug Administration protocol (4,000) was delivered and retreatments frequently occurred on successive days. Of the patients 75% were stone-free 3 months after treatment, while another 20% had only residual small fragments. No intrarenal or perinephric hematomas were observed and only 1 patient has had hypertension requiring medication. Renal colic from passage of stone fragments occurred in only 10% of the patients. An aggressive treatment policy using repeat treatments as necessary provides for superior results with this device without an incision or complication. 
Segregation of atrial-specific and inducible expression of an atrial natriuretic factor transgene in an in vivo murine model of cardiac hypertrophy. To study the mechanisms that activate expression of the atrial natriuretic factor (ANF) gene during pressure-induced hypertrophy, we have developed and characterized an in vivo murine model of myocardial cell hypertrophy. We employed microsurgical techniques to produce a stable 35- to 45-mmHg pressure gradient across the thoracic aorta of the mouse that is associated with rapid and transient expression of an immediate-early gene program (c-fos/c-jun/junB/Egr-1/nur-77), an increase in heart weight/body weight ratio, and up-regulation of the endogenous ANF gene. These responses that are identical to those in cultured cell and other in vivo models of hypertrophy. To determine whether tissue-specific and inducible expression of the ANF gene can be segregated, we used a transgenic mouse line in which 500 base pairs of the human ANF promoter region directs atrial-specific expression of the simian virus 40 large tumor antigen (T antigen), with no detectable expression in the ventricles. Thoracic aortic banding of these mice led to a 20-fold increase in the endogenous ANF mRNA in the ventricle but no detectable expression of the T-antigen marker gene. This result provides evidence that atrial-specific and inducible expression of the ANF gene can be segregated, suggesting that a distinct set of regulatory cis sequences may mediate the up-regulation of the ANF gene during in vivo pressure overload hypertrophy. This murine model demonstrates the utility of microsurgical techniques to study in vivo cardiac physiology in transgenic mice and should allow the application of genetic approaches to identify the mechanisms that activate ventricular expression of the ANF gene during in vivo hypertrophy. 
Combined use of nifedipine and diltiazem for the treatment of severe hypertension. Calcium channel blockers are a heterogeneous group of drugs that have enhanced our ability to concurrently control blood pressure, treat coronary artery disease, and avoid many of the side effects of previously available antihypertensive agents. Patients with severe hypertension may require multiple agents for adequate control of blood pressure because of either poor control with one agent or side effects from high doses of a single agent. Laboratory investigations have shown a synergistic effect on receptor binding, as well as increased drug levels with the concurrent use of diltiazem and a dihydropyridine calcium channel blocker (nifedipine or nicardipine). It is as yet unknown whether these effects on receptor binding and increased drug levels translate into greater clinical efficacy in blood pressure control. We have reported what we believe to be the first case in which this interaction was used successfully to control previously poorly controlled hypertension, while minimizing side effects. 
Epipodophyllotoxin-related leukemia. Identification of a new subset of secondary leukemia. Thirty-seven children and adults who developed acute nonlymphocytic leukemia after the administration of chemotherapy that included etoposide or teniposide for a variety of hematologic and solid malignancies were identified. The secondary leukemia that occurred in these patients could be distinguished from the secondary leukemia that occurs after treatment with alkylating agents by the following: a shorter latency period; a predominance of monocytic or myelomonocytic features; and frequent cytogenetic abnormalities involving 11q23. Patients receiving an epipodophyllotoxin are at risk for developing secondary leukemia that has features distinct from the syndrome of secondary leukemia associated with alkylating agents. 
Cerebral dural sinus thrombosis. Cerebral dural sinus thrombosis is an unusual syndrome in which a patient presents with a severe headache that may be associated with diverse neurologic and physical findings. The case of a 31-year-old woman with headache, vomiting, generalized tonic-clonic seizure, and subsequent dense hemiplegia is presented. The patient was diagnosed as having a cerebral dural sinus thrombosis, but only after the diagnosis was missed initially. The syndrome may be difficult to detect because it can mimic several other entities. There are several known or suspected predisposing factors. The syndrome, diagnostic modalities, and therapeutic options are reviewed. 
The course of lymphocytic hypophysitis. A 27-year-old woman presented to our institution in her seventh month of pregnancy with complaints of headache and visual field disturbance. Workup revealed bitemporal hemianopia, a markedly enlarged pituitary gland on computed tomography scan, and biochemical evidence of partial hypopituitarism. At surgery, a biopsy specimen of the pituitary gland was taken revealing lymphocytic hypophysitis. The patient was treated with steroids and replacement doses of thyroid hormone. Visual fields improved postoperatively. A repeat computed tomography scan obtained 2 months after an uneventful pregnancy showed that her pituitary had regained normal size and contour. Over the next 9 months she had gradual recovery of all pituitary function. This case allowed us to follow and document the course of lymphocytic hypophysitis from its presentation as a macroadenoma with partial hypopituitarism to full recovery of both size and hormonal function of the pituitary. Lymphocytic hypophysitis should be considered in the differential diagnosis of a pituitary mass or pituitary dysfunction presenting in pregnancy. In patients with suspected lymphocytic hypophysitis and a pituitary mass, a trial of steroids may be therapeutic. 
Hepatocellular expression of lymphocyte function-associated antigen 3 in chronic hepatitis. T lymphocyte-mediated cytolytic immune reactions are considered a major cause of hepatocyte injury in chronic viral and autoimmune hepatitis. To further investigate local immune responses, we studied the expression of lymphocyte antigens and cell-cell interaction molecules known to be involved in effector-target cell interactions by light and electron microscopy in liver biopsy specimens from patients with chronic viral and autoimmune hepatitis. CD8+ lymphocytes were found to be the predominant population of cells in the inflammatory infiltrate in chronic hepatitis B and non-A, non-B hepatitis. In contrast, CD4+ cells constituted a comparably higher proportion of cells and were more numerous than CD8+ cells in chronic autoimmune hepatitis. In both viral and autoimmune hepatitis, a substantial portion of lymphocytes expressed activation antigens such as T11/3 (CD2R) and IL-2-R (CD25). Lymphocyte function-associated antigen-3 (CD58), which mediates lymphocyte adhesion and activation and is the natural ligand of the CD2/T11 lymphocyte surface receptor, could be demonstrated on endothelial cells and hepatocytes. Hepatocellular lymphocyte function-associated antigen-3 expression in chronic hepatitis showed membranous and cytoplasmic staining of hepatocytes and had a positive correlation with the degree of inflammatory activity. These results suggest that effector-target interactions between hepatocytes and lymphocytes mediated by the lymphocyte function-associated antigen-3/CD2 pathway play a role in chronic inflammatory liver disease. Possible functional consequences of this interaction include enhancement of antigen-specific immune reactions and antigen-independent mechanisms of T cell activation, which may contribute considerably to the degree of inflammatory activity and tissue damage in chronic hepatitis. 
The role of prolactin in autoimmune demyelination: suppression of experimental allergic encephalomyelitis by bromocriptine. Several lines of evidence suggest that the anterior pituitary hormone prolactin has a stimulatory role on immune function and that pharmacological suppression of prolactin secretion with the dopamine-agonist bromocriptine suppresses both humoral and cellular immunity. Here, we describe the effects of prolactin-suppression on the course of experimental allergic encephalomyelitis in female Lewis rats. Initiation of continuous bromocriptine treatment before immunization reduced both the severity and incidence of clinical signs of acute experimental allergic encephalomyelitis. Experimental allergic encephalomyelitis-immunized rats experienced a threefold rise in basal prolactin levels on day 4 after immunization and maintained elevated prolactin levels on day 10, before the onset of neurological signs of experimental allergic encephalomyelitis. Bromocriptine treatment reduced prolactin levels to those of sham-immunized rats. In vivo bromocriptine pretreatment inhibited splenic lymphocyte proliferative responses in vitro to the immunizing antigen and to concanavalin A. Moreover, bromocriptine therapy was protective when initiated 1 week after the initial immunization and was also effective in suppression of late disease. These results indicate that (1) prolactin levels are elevated after immunization and before the onset of experimental allergic encephalomyelitis, (2) bromocriptine inhibits both prolactin secretion and the severity of acute experimental allergic encephalomyelitis, and (3) inhibition is also present when treatment is begun after sensitization, suggesting an effect of prolactin on the effector limb of the immune response during experimental allergic encephalomyelitis. 
Life expectancy of patients with chronic nonleukemic myeloproliferative disorders. This study determines, within the frame of current therapeutic possibilities, the impact of chronic nonleukemic myeloproliferative disorders on expected survival. The survival data for 1067 patients (454 with polycythemia vera, 247 with essential thrombocythemia, and 366 with idiopathic myelofibrosis) were collected from 38 Spanish institutions. The actuarial survival probability of each group of patients was compared with that of the age-matched and sex-matched control population. The survival of the patients with polycythemia vera and essential thrombocythemia did not differ from that of the control population (P = 0.92 and, 0.22, respectively), whereas the survival of the patients with idiopathic myelofibrosis was strikingly reduced with respect to the control population (P = 0.0000000007). Thus, in terms of survival, current therapeutic procedures may be considered as quite satisfactory in patients with polycythemia vera and essential thrombocythemia. On the other hand, due to poor survival of patients with idiopathic myelofibrosis, new therapeutic approaches for this condition are clearly needed. 
Identification and characterization of a low-affinity granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor receptor on primary and cultured human melanoma cells. Hematopoietic growth factor receptors are present on cells of normal nonhematopoietic tissues such as endothelium and placenta. We previously demonstrated functional human granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) receptors on small cell carcinoma of the lung cell lines, and others have reported that certain solid tumor cell lines respond to GM-CSF in clonogenic assays. In the current study, we examine human melanoma cell lines and fresh specimens of melanoma to determine whether they have functional GM-CSF receptors. Scatchard analyses of 125I-GM-CSF equilibrium binding to melanoma cell lines showed a mean of 542 +/- 67 sites per cell with a kd of 0.72 +/- 0.14 nmol/L. Cross-linking studies in the melanoma cell line, M14, showed a major GM-CSF receptor species of 84,000 daltons. Under the conditions tested, the M14 cells did not have a proliferative response to GM-CSF in vitro, nor was any induction of primary response genes detected by Northern analysis in response to GM-CSF. Studies to determine internal translocation of the receptor-ligand complex indicated less than 10% of the 125I-GM-CSF internalized was specifically bound to receptors. Primary melanoma cells from five surgical specimens had GM-CSF receptors; Scatchard analysis was performed on one sample, showing 555 sites/cell with a kd of 0.23 nmol/L. These results indicate that human tumor cells may express a low-affinity GM-CSF receptor protein that localizes to the cell surface and binds ligand, but lacks functional components or accessory factors needed to transduce a signal. 
Bacterial translocation induces procoagulant activity in tissue macrophages. A potential mechanism for end-organ dysfunction. The ability of bacterial translocation to induce cell-associated procoagulant activity was examined in a rodent model. Intestinal decontamination with streptomycin sulfate and bacitracin followed by oral feeding with a streptomycin-resistant strain of Escherichia coli produced monoassociation of the gastrointestinal tract with this microorganism. Using this model, the rate of bacterial translocation at day 3 increased from 6% (1 of 17) to 90% (28 of 31). Cell-associated procoagulant activity was measured in the mononuclear cell population of mesenteric lymph nodes as well as portal and systemic blood and also in hepatic nonparenchymal cells. In monoassociated animals, the procoagulant activity of mesenteric lymph node mononuclear cells was significantly greater than in control animals at day 3 (210% +/- 28% vs 100% +/- 6%) but not at days 1 or 6. Procoagulant activity of hepatic nonparenchymal cells was elevated in monoassociated animals at days 3 and 6 compared with control animals. Both control and monoassociated animals remained well throughout the experiment. The histologic features of the gastrointestinal tract, mesenteric nodes, and liver did not differ between groups. These studies provide evidence that bacterial translocation, in the absence of external stimuli, is able to induce cell activation at sites remote from the gastrointestinal tract and may therefore contribute to the pathogenesis of multiple organ failure. 
The bentiromide test using plasma p-aminobenzoic acid for diagnosing pancreatic insufficiency in young children. The effect of two different doses and a liquid meal. The bentiromide test was evaluated using plasma p-aminobenzoic acid as an indirect test of pancreatic insufficiency in young children between 2 months and 4 years of age. To determine the optimal test method, the following were examined: (a) the best dose of bentiromide (15 mg/kg or 30 mg/kg); (b) the optimal sampling time for plasma p-aminobenzoic acid; and (c) the effect of coadministration of a liquid meal. Sixty-nine children 91.6 +/- 1.0 years) were studied, including 34 controls with normal fat absorption and 35 patients (34 with cystic fibrosis) with fat maldigestion due to pancreatic insufficiency. Control and pancreatic insufficient subjects were studied in three age-matched groups: (a) low-dose bentiromide (15 mg/kg) with clear fluids; (b) high-dose bentiromide (30 mg/kg) with clear fluids; and (c) high-dose bentiromide with a liquid meal. Plasma p-aminobenzoic acid was determined at 0, 30, 60, and 90 minutes then hourly for 6 hours. The dose effect of bentiromide with clear liquids was evaluated. High-dose bentiromide best discriminated control and pancreatic insufficient subjects, due to a higher peak plasma p-aminobenzoic acid level in controls, but poor sensitivity and specificity remained. High-dose bentiromide with a liquid meal produced a delayed increase in plasma p-aminobenzoic acid in the control subjects probably caused by retarded gastric emptying. However, in the pancreatic insufficient subjects, use of a liquid meal resulted in significantly lower plasma p-aminobenzoic acid levels at all time points; plasma p-aminobenzoic acid at 2 and 3 hours completely discriminated between control and pancreatic insufficient patients. Evaluation of the data by area under the time-concentration curve failed to improve test results. In conclusion, the bentiromide test is a simple, clinically useful means of detecting pancreatic insufficiency in young children, but a higher dose administered with a liquid meal is recommended. 
Tube feeding-related diarrhea in acutely Ill patients. Acutely ill patients received tube feeding for an average of 15.8 days and, on average, 35% of those days were spent in the intensive care unit (ICU). Patients were prospectively assigned either a fiber-free formula (FFF-OSMOLITE HN, Ross; n = 50) or a fiber-supplemented (soy polysaccharide 14.4 g/L) formula (FSF = JEVITY, Ross; n = 50). Diarrhea was defined as three or more loose or watery stools per day and occurred in 30% of all patients. Diarrhea developed in 29 (41%) of the 71 patients who received antibiotics during, or within 2 weeks prior to, the feeding period, whereas only 1 (3%) of the 29 patients not receiving antibiotics developed diarrhea (p less than 0.005); and this patient developed diarrhea on the day of death. Among the 30 patients with diarrhea, stool Clostridium difficile (CD) toxin was positive in 15 (50%), negative in 11 (37%), and was not measured in four. The mean serum albumin was significantly lower in patients with diarrhea (2.43) than in those without diarrhea (2.75) (p = 0.043). There were no significant differences in age, sex, diagnoses, number of feeding days, and percent ICU days between patients with and without diarrhea. While not statistically significant, patients who received FSF were observed to have a lower incidence of diarrhea, a lower percentage of diarrhea days per total feeding days, and a lower frequency of positive CD toxin assays than patients who received FFF. In this patient population, antibiotic usage was the factor most strongly associated with diarrhea during tube feedings. 
The choice between surgical resection and radiation therapy for patients with cancer of the esophagus and cardia: a retrospective comparison between two treatments. The choice of treatment for patients with cancer of the esophagus and cardia is controversial. Since overall survival is poor, the most important aim of treatment should be improvement of the main complaint: the inability to eat. In a retrospective analysis of 265 patients, referred to the University Hospital in Leiden, The Netherlands, comparisons were made between palliative effects of surgical resection (N = 92) and irradiation (N = 128). Several methods of comparing surgery with irradiation are possible: (1) all surgical patients vs. all irradiated patients; (2) only those surgical patients who survived the operation (N = 70) vs. all irradiated patients (N = 128); and (3) survivors after resection (N = 70) vs. only those irradiated patients treated with "curative" radiation (N = 62). Analysis of prognostic factors showed that in both surgical and irradiated patients, the only statistically significant factor was the (dis)ability to eat. Criteria to be considered to make individual recommendations for either treatment are presented. 
Expression of immunoreactive E-cadherin adhesion molecules in human cancers. E-cadherin (E-CD), a Ca(2+)-dependent adhesion molecule, plays a major role in the maintenance of intercellular junctions in normal epithelial cells in most organs. The expression of E-CD in human carcinoma samples (esophagus, stomach, and breast) was investigated using immunohistochemical staining, which was performed on surgical specimens using a monoclonal antibody for human E-CD. E-cadherin was strongly expressed in all normal epithelium examined. However E-CD expression in primary tumors of esophagus (11 of 15: 73%), stomach (5 of 20: 25%), and breast (9 of 20: 45%) was reduced, and 68% of these (esophagus: 8 of 11, stomach: 4 of 5, breast: 5 of 9) displayed heterogeneous E-CD expression. In some tumor cells with reduced E-CD expression, E-CD molecules were located in the cell cytoplasm. These results indicate that there are human cancer cells in which E-CD-related intercellular adhesion is impaired. 
Value of transesophageal echocardiography as an adjunct to transthoracic echocardiography in evaluation of native and prosthetic valve endocarditis. To determine if transesophageal echocardiography provides better visualization of valvular vegetations than transthoracic echocardiography, we used both methods to evaluate 24 consecutive patients (mean age, 54 years; 15 female patients and nine male patients) referred for symptoms suggestive of infectious endocarditis. Ten of the 24 patients had one or more valvular prostheses. Echocardiograms were classified as positive or negative based on visualization of valvular vegetations or abscesses. Of ten patients with a final diagnosis of infectious endocarditis on extended follow-up, transthoracic echocardiography was positive in five patients. Transesophageal echocardiography not only yielded abnormal findings in all ten of these patients, but also revealed additional information in four of the five patients with abnormal transthoracic echocardiographic examinations. Among the 14 patients who, on subsequent follow-up, were found not to have infectious endocarditis, transthoracic echocardiography was normal in 13 and falsely abnormal in one. Transesophageal echocardiography revealed no evidence of infectious endocarditis in any of these patients. The ten patients who were determined to have infectious endocarditis all had positive blood cultures and no alternative cause for their clinical presentation; in seven patients in this group who underwent operative or postmortem evaluation, infectious endocarditis was confirmed. All patients without infectious endocarditis were demonstrated to have other causes for their clinical presentation. We conclude that transesophageal echocardiography is a highly valuable test in the work-up of patients with suspected infectious endocarditis, especially those patients with inconclusive or normal transthoracic echocardiograms. In addition, transesophageal echocardiography may be of benefit to patients with previously documented infectious endocarditis and a complicated clinical course in whom additional cardiac lesions are suspected but not demonstrated by transthoracic echocardiography. 
Long-term efficacy of repeat argon laser trabeculoplasty. The role of repeat argon laser trabeculoplasty (RALT) in the management of open-angle glaucoma is controversial. To determine the long-term efficacy of RALT, the authors reviewed case records of 44 patients (50 eyes) who received RALT for uncontrolled glaucoma at the Wills Eye Hospital before 1986. Success was defined as a 3 mmHg or greater decrease in intraocular pressure (IOP) to less than 22 mmHg, and no further surgical intervention. By life table analysis, RALT was successful in 35% of eyes at 6 months, in 21% at 12 months, in 11% at 24 months, and in 5% at 48 months. Thirty-three percent of eyes in which primary ALT was successful for 1 year were successful 12 months after RALT. Complications included IOP spikes in 12%. In conclusion, RALT was generally not effective for long-term control of open-angle glaucoma, but may be useful as a temporizing measure. However, this use of RALT must be weighed against the risks of complications and the additional progression of disease before more definitive surgical intervention. 
Muscarinic acetylcholine receptor subtypes as agonist-dependent oncogenes. We have evaluated the muscarinic acetylcholine family of G protein-coupled receptors (mAChRs) for their oncogenic potential. These receptors are preferentially expressed in postmitotic cells, transducing signals specified by their endogenous agonist, the neurotransmitter acetylcholine. Cells transfected with individual human mAChR genes were morphologically indistinguishable from parental NIH 3T3 cells in the absence of agonist. In contrast, when cultures were supplemented with carbachol, a stable analog of acetylcholine, foci of transformation readily appeared in m1, m3, or m5 but not in m2 or m4 mAChRs transfectants. Receptor expression was verified by ligand binding and was similar for each transfected culture. Transformation was dose-dependent and required only low levels of receptor expression. In transformation-competent cells, agonist induced phosphatidylinositol hydrolysis, whereas in m2 or m4 transfectants, receptors were coupled to the inhibition of adenylyl cyclase. These findings demonstrate that mAChRs linked to phosphatidylinositol hydrolysis can act as conditional oncogenes when expressed in cells capable of proliferation. 
Odor identification deficit of the parkinsonism-dementia complex of Guam: equivalence to that of Alzheimer's and idiopathic Parkinson's disease. Olfactory dysfunction is among the first signs of Alzheimer's disease (AD), idiopathic Parkinson's disease (PD), and the parkinsonism-dementia complex (PDC) of Guam. We have recently demonstrated that the odor identification and detection deficits of patients with PD are equivalent to those of patients with mild AD when subtle differences in cognitive function are statistically controlled for by analysis of covariance. In contrast, patients with progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP) and patients with 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP)-induced parkinsonism evidence olfactory function much more similar to that of normal controls. In the present study, we administered the University of Pennsylvania Smell Identification Test and the Picture Identification Test to 24 patients with early signs of the PDC of Guam and statistically compared their test scores to those of 24 early-stage AD and 24 early-stage PD patients of similar age and gender from the United States mainland. Although the PDC group evidenced slightly more difficulty in identifying pictures than did the other 2 groups, the odor identification deficit associated with this disorder was of the same magnitude as that observed in AD and PD, suggesting that olfactory testing cannot be used to distinguish among these 3 diseases and that the olfactory dysfunction of these disorders may reflect a common neurologic substrate. 
Insulin acutely suppresses parathyroid hormone second messenger generation in UMR-106-01 osteoblast-like cells: differential effects on phospholipase C and adenylate cyclase activation. Insulin modifies the effects of PTH on osteoblast-like cells. However, the basis for this effect is unknown. In bone and kidney cells, the effects of PTH on cellular function are mediated by second messengers generated through both the phospholipase C and adenylate cyclase systems. Therefore, we examined the effects of insulin on PTH second messenger generation in UMR-106-01 rat osteoblastic osteosarcoma cells. PTH produced a rapid, transient increase in intracellular free calcium concentration ([Ca2+]i) which was maximal at 30 sec and was only minimally reduced in the absence of extracellular calcium. Inositol-triphosphate (IP3) production was increased in parallel. PTH stimulation of [Ca2+]i was concentration-dependent from 0.5-1,000 nM, with half-maximal stimulation at approximately 50 nM PTH. A 30-sec exposure to 50 nM PTH produced 32% and 23% increases in IP1 and IP3 production, respectively (both P less than 0.05). Although insulin alone did not significantly alter basal [Ca2+]i, a 1-min exposure to 1-100 nM insulin produced a concentration-dependent suppression of the PTH-stimulated transient increase in [Ca2+]i and IP3 generation. 100 nM insulin decreased 50 nM PTH stimulation of [Ca2+]i and IP3 levels by 84% (P less than 0.02) and 80% (P less than 0.001), respectively. Preexposure to insulin also decreased PTH stimulation of intracellular cAMP levels, but to a lesser degree. A 1-min exposure to 100 nM insulin produced a 32% (P less than 0.01) decrease in PTH-stimulated cAMP generation, but lower insulin concentrations were without significant effects. These results demonstrate that in UMR-106-01 cells, insulin suppresses PTH stimulation of second messengers generated through both the phospholipase C and adenylate cyclase systems, but has a more marked effect on the former. 
Infected intravenous port device causing tricuspid valve regurgitation. Sepsis and tricuspid valve regurgitation developed in a 29-year-old man with Crohn's disease after implantation of an intravenous port device for parenteral nutrition. A thrombus, caused by Staphylococcus epidermidis, had grown along the catheter and prolapsed through the valve without affecting it. Complete removal in an open heart procedure led to quick recovery. 
"Heartstart Scotland"--initial experience of a national scheme for out of hospital defibrillation. OBJECTIVE--To determine the outcome of out of hospital defibrillation in Scotland during the year after the introduction of automated external defibrillators in October 1988. DESIGN--Retrospective analysis of ambulance service reports and hospital records. SETTING--Scottish Ambulance Service and acute receiving hospitals throughout Scotland. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES--Delay from cardiac arrest to first defibrillator shock; vital state on arrival at hospital accident and emergency department; survival to hospital discharge. RESULTS--During the study period 268 defibrillators were purchased by public subscription and 96% of the 2000 ambulance crew underwent an eight hour training programme in cardiopulmonary resuscitation and defibrillation. A total of 1111 cardiac arrests were recorded, and defibrillation was indicated and undertaken in 602 (54%) patients, mean age 63 (range 14-92) years. A spontaneous pulse was present on arrival at hospital in 180 (30%) of the defibrillated patients, and 75 (12.5%) were subsequently discharged alive. As expected, the likelihood of survival was inversely related to the delay from the onset of cardiac arrest to the time of the first shock and was greater in the case of witnessed arrest. If ventricular fibrillation occurred after the arrival of the ambulance, survival to discharge was 33%. CONCLUSIONS--An effective scheme for out of hospital defibrillation can be introduced rapidly, and with limited training implications and costs, by the use of automated external defibrillators in ambulances. 
Quantitative analysis of the bacterial findings in otitis media. Qualitative and quantitative bacterial analysis of 200 samples of middle ear effusions collected from patients with current otitis media was performed. When middle ear pathogens (S. pneumoniae, H. influenzae and B. catarrhalis) were found during current acute otitis media or otitis media with effusion infection, the quantity of these bacteria was of the magnitude 10(6)-10(8)/ml and 0-5 x 10(5)/ml effusion material, respectively. Mucopurulent effusion material contained 6 x 10(5)-10(8) bacteria per ml whereas effusion from chronically discharging ears exceeded 10(9) bacteria per ml. Serous effusions did not harbour middle ear pathogens. The appearance of the effusion material was dependent on the number of bacteria involved. Quantification of bacteria in various middle ear effusions offers opportunities to make the diagnosis of various otitis media infections more accurate and readily comparable. 
Algorithm to predict triple-vessel/left main coronary artery disease in patients without myocardial infarction. An international cross validation. Logistic regression was applied to the clinical, risk factor, and exercise data of consecutive angiographic referrals without prior myocardial infarction to determine an algorithm predicting the probability of triple-vessel/left main coronary artery disease. These data were obtained from a total of 1,074 such subjects from patient populations at four centers (Cleveland Clinic Foundation, Cleveland, Ohio; Hungarian Institute of Cardiology, Budapest, Hungary; the university hospitals, Zurich and Basel, Switzerland; and the Veterans Administration Medical Center, Long Beach, Calif.) and used to derive four separate probability algorithms. Each algorithm is based on patient data from study samples at three of the four centers and consists of 272 logistic functions, which are related to linear combinations of 13 variables (age, sex, type of chest pain, systolic blood pressure, resting electrocardiogram, serum cholesterol, fasting blood sugar, achieved exercise work load, achieved heart rate, exercise-induced angina and hypotension, heart rate-adjusted resting ST depression, and exercise ST slope). The four algorithms were cross validated by testing them on the populations not involved in their derivation. The resulting probabilities in the four test groups were then compared with the angiographic findings of triple-vessel/left main coronary artery disease. The discriminatory power of all the algorithms was fair to good (area under receiver operating characteristic curve, 0.68, 0.75, 0.82, 0.85) in the test groups. The algorithm did not significantly underestimate or overestimate disease probability except in one center (Long Beach). 
Rehabilitation in cerebral palsy. Cerebral palsy is the most frequent physical disability of childhood onset. Over the past four decades, prevalence has remained remarkably constant at 2 to 3 per 1,000 live births in industrialized countries. In this article I concentrate on the rehabilitation and outcome of patients with cerebral palsy. The epidemiologic, pathogenetic, and diagnostic aspects are highlighted briefly as they pertain to the planning and implementation of the rehabilitation process. 
Treatment of subungual hematomas with nail trephination: a prospective study. Subungual hematoma is a commonly encountered problem in the emergency department. We designed a prospective, observational study to determine if treatment of simple subungual hematomas (SUH) by nail trephination alone is without cosmetic or infectious complications. Over a 2-year study period, 48 patients met inclusion criteria. Radiographs of all digits were taken to detect distal phalangeal fracture and SUH size was measured. Nail trephination was performed using electrocautery, and all patients reported relief of pain after the procedure. Follow-up was achieved in 45 of 48 patients with a total of 47 SUH. Average follow-up period was 10.3 +/- 4.3 months. By patient history, average time for the nail to grow back was 4.0 +/- 2.6 months. No complications of infection, osteomyelitis, or major nail deformities occurred in any patients treated by nail trephination, regardless of SUH size or presence of fracture. In simple SUH, regardless of size, nail removal with suture repair of the nail bed, as suggested in previous studies, is unnecessary. 
Cavitation potential of mechanical heart valve prostheses. Just like technical check valves, the function of mechanical heart valve prostheses may presumably also lead to cavitation effects during valve closure. Due to the waterhammer effect, cavitation may primarily occur in the mitral position leading to high mechanical loading of the valve itself and of corpuscular blood elements. Ten different types of commercial mechanical heart valves were investigated in the mitral position of a pulsatile mock loop, to detect cavitation thresholds under physiologically similar conditions by cinematographic techniques. Almost all these valve prostheses show cavitation up to a ventricular pressure gradient of 5000 mmHg/s. The threshold depends on valve type and size and is sometimes within the physiological range below 2000 mmHg/s. Visible cavitation bubbles with a diameter of up to 1.8 mm and a collapse time of less than 0.1 ms suggest that vapour cavitation may play an important role for material and blood damage in mechanical heart valve prostheses. 
Subcutaneous sumatriptan in the acute treatment of migraine. Sumatriptan International Study Group. Two double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled multicentre studies were carried out to assess the efficacy and tolerability of subcutaneous (s.c.) injections of 1-3 mg and 1-8 mg sumatriptan, respectively, in the acute treatment of migraine. Data are presented from a total of 519 patients. In both studies, the primary endpoint of efficacy was a reduction in headache severity from severe or moderate to mild or no headache. All doses of sumatriptan were significantly more effective than placebo in relieving symptoms, and the response appeared to be dose-related; an effective response to treatment was achieved within 30 min in 73% of patients treated with 6 mg sumatriptan and 80% of patients treated with 8 mg sumatriptan s.c., compared with 22% for placebo. Sumatriptan was well tolerated and the majority of adverse events were mild and transient. The most frequent complaint was irritation and pain at the site of injection. No changes in laboratory values were noted and ECG readings were unaltered by treatment. On the basis of these results, the 6 mg subcutaneous dose has been selected for further evaluation in large-scale studies. 
Enteropathogenic Escherichia coli and life threatening chronic diarrhoea. Enteropathogenic Escherichia coli (EPEC) infection is not generally thought to cause severe diarrhoea after the neonatal period. Patients admitted to Queen Elizabeth Hospital for Children over the three years (1984-7) with diarrhoea and EPEC infection were reviewed. Clinical details, features of small intestinal mucosa, and treatment were recorded in those who developed chronic diarrhoea with failure to thrive. Twenty six children with EPEC required hospital admission for diarrhoea and six of these (23%) developed chronic diarrhoea. In contrast only two (5%) of 42 with other serogroups of E coli (p less than 0.01) and 28 (4%) of 764 children without EPEC admitted with acute diarrhoea developed chronic symptoms (p less than 0.01). EPEC serogroups detected in the stool of the six children with chronic diarrhoea were 0128 in three, 0114 in two, and 0119 in one. The patients' clinical characteristics were: previous good health, no significant immunodeficiency, age 4-10 months, foreign travel (three of six), severe life threatening secretory diarrhoea from 0.5 to 1.5 1 per day (four of six), small intestinal enteropathy (five of six) three of whom showed mucosal adherent, non-invasive E coli of the same serotype as that in the stool, in association with microvillous loss and pedestal formation. All were treated with hypoallergenic feeds, two with parenteral nutrition, and three with parenteral antibiotics. All eventually recovered. EPEC infection is a common treatable cause of life threatening chronic diarrhoea in infancy. 
The development of a Norwegian pain questionnaire. The study was undertaken to develop a multidimensional measuring instrument for pain in the Norwegian language. The McGill Pain Questionnaire (MPQ) was used as a model as it is a valid and reliable tool for pain measurement in English speaking countries. A series of steps were taken to develop a Norwegian pain questionnaire: (1) words describing pain were derived from 95 subjects (patients, students and health personnel); (2) 10 subjects allocated pain descriptors into groups; (3) 36 college student validated the word groupings; (4) 72 patients graded the words contained in each group according to intensity; and (5) the reliability of group items was tested. The study demonstrated that there are many descriptors of pain in the Norwegian language. The final version of the Norwegian pain questionnaire consisted of 106 pain descriptors divided into 18 groups. Validity of the classifications as well as reliability of the words was demonstrated. The actual value of the Norwegian pain questionnaire as a measuring instrument has not yet been documented. 
Dysphoria in male alcoholics with a history of hallucinations. This paper examines severity of depressive symptoms, as measured by the Beck Depression Inventory, in chronic alcoholics with and without a history of hallucinations. We found a) alcoholics entering alcohol treatment who have experienced hallucinations during detoxification report higher levels of subjective depression than alcoholics who have never experienced hallucinations, b) the level of subjective depression in alcoholics with a history of hallucinations remains higher at the end of inpatient alcohol treatment than in alcoholics without hallucinations, and c) hallucination is the important variable; alcoholics with blackouts, seizures, and delirium tremens, do not experience higher levels of depression during detoxification. The reporting of a significantly higher level of depressive symptoms by alcoholics with a history of experiencing hallucinations during withdrawal suggests that in some alcoholics, there exists a vulnerability for mood abnormalities which includes a predisposition toward other abnormal mental phenomena such as perceptual distortions. 
The epinephrine-blood platelet connection with special reference to essential hypertension. About three decades ago it was shown by an aggregometer that epinephrine activated blood platelets, and it was proposed that platelets could be the link between stress and cardiovascular disease. During the past 10 years this hypothesis has been tested in clinical studies. It has been found that subjects with hypertension consistently have raised plasma catecholamine levels and in particular elevated epinephrine levels. Arterial but not venous epinephrine concentrations correlated with plasma concentrations of the platelet-release reaction marker beta-thromboglobulin (BTG). Plasma BTG is elevated in hypertensive patients, and psychological stress (i.e., hypertension labeling) stimulates plasma epinephrine and BTG. When a physiologic dose of epinephrine is infused into essential hypertensive patients, platelet counts, platelet size, and plasma BTG concentrations increase more than in normotensive subjects. Data suggest that there is a connection between psychological stress, plasma epinephrine levels, and platelet function, especially in patients with essential hypertension. 
The radiology of headache. The patient who presents with a severe and acute headache should be evaluated radiographically with CT. The key diagnosis to make in this situation is hemorrhage, either subarachnoid or intraparenchymal. Computed tomography is more sensitive to acute hemorrhage than is MRI. When the patient is stable, MRI frequently contributes information to narrow the diagnostic possibilities, because vascular malformations and certain parenchymal lesions have a characteristic appearance on MRI. Hydrocephalus may also present acutely and is easily seen on CT or MRI. In a patient may show WMF and atrophy. The patient with trigeminal neuropathy may demonstrate central or peripheral lesions. In temporomandibular joint dysfunction, conventional tomography and MRI are frequently used. Magnetic resonance imaging shows excellent detail of the disk and surrounding soft tissues, whereas tomography better demonstrates bony changes. When a history of trauma is present, MRI may show a subacute subdural hematoma. These collections are easily seen on MRI, even when isodense on CT. Evidence of old shear injury is also well seen on MRI. Finally, neoplastic, inflammatory, congenital, and idiopathic sources of headache may be demonstrated by either MRI or CT, depending on presentation. MRI will generally show superior characterization. 
Pelvic osteosarcoma. Resection, reconstruction, local control, and survival statistics. Nine patients with a malignant tumor in the periacetabular region of the pelvis were treated with a Type IIC resection and were reconstructed using a cementless, adaptable prosthetic system. In two patients, a new planning strategy was applied using three-dimensional reconstruction. There were two chondrosarcomas, three Ewing-sarcomas, two osteosarcomas, and two metastases of thyroid cancer. Excision was wide, marginal, and intralesional in three cases each. Ages ranged from eight to 68 years (average, 40 years), and follow-up periods ranged from 12 to 36 months with an average of 27 months. Overall functional evaluation was good in five cases, fair in three, and poor in one. Four patients died of local recurrences and lung metastases; all of them had marginal or intralesional resections. Histologic analysis of one retrieved specimen revealed bone ingrowth with connective tissue interface. Three-dimensional planning has proven to be a very valuable tool for achieving an anatomic reconstruction of the pelvic ring. These results are encouraging and endorse the authors to continue with the current approach of prosthetic reconstruction following Type IIC resections. 
Pulmonary embolism update. Lessons for the '90s. Pulmonary embolism continues to be an underdiagnosed, potentially fatal problem. Because clinical diagnosis of pulmonary embolism is notoriously inaccurate, clinical suspicions must always be confirmed with objective studies. Evaluation generally begins with ventilation-perfusion lung scanning. Further evaluation is usually unnecessary if the lung scan is interpreted as normal (diagnosis excluded) or high-probability (diagnosis accepted). However, if the lung scan is indeterminate (referring to all other interpretations), additional diagnostic studies are usually required. Newer trends in the management of pulmonary embolism and deep venous thrombosis include a more aggressive initial regimen of heparin; simultaneous administration of warfarin with heparin, resulting in a shorter duration of heparin therapy; use of the international normalized ratio to monitor warfarin therapy; and use of a less intense warfarin regimen. Adjusted-dose subcutaneous heparin therapy and low-intensity warfarin therapy are newer prophylactic techniques for patients at moderate to high risk for deep venous thrombosis. 
Early onset cerebellar ataxia with retained tendon reflexes. Clinical, electrophysiological and MRI observations in comparison with Friedreich's ataxia. Fourteen patients with the clinical diagnosis of early onset cerebellar ataxia with retained tendon reflexes (EOCA) were examined and compared with 11 patients with Friedreich's ataxia (FA). The mean age of onset in EOCA was 15.9 +/- 6.0 yrs (FA: 14.0 +/- 5.7 yrs). Annual progression rate and the percentage of patients who were wheelchair-bound was lower in EOCA as compared with FA, although the difference did not reach statistical significance. The latency until becoming wheelchair-bound, however, was significantly longer in EOCA than in FA. The segregation ratio in EOCA was significantly lower than 0.25. Clinically, EOCA and FA patients presented with a progressive cerebellar syndrome. Associated symptoms, such as muscle wasting, sensory disturbances, foot deformity, scoliosis and electrocardiographic abnormalities were encountered less frequently in EOCA than in FA patients. The electrophysiological findings in EOCA were variable and pointed to axonal degeneration in peripheral nerves and central pathways. Posturographic measurements revealed a higher incidence of anteroposterior sway direction in EOCA as compared with FA, suggesting a cerebellar type of ataxia in EOCA. Eleven out of the 14 EOCA patients had cerebellar atrophy in MRI. The characteristic MRI finding in FA was upper cervical cord shrinkage and only minor atrophy of the cerebellum. The demonstration of cerebellar atrophy in the majority of EOCA patients supports the view that EOCA is distinct from FA. It is uncertain, however, whether EOCA is a homogenous disease entity or a group of phenotypically similar syndromes. 
Fluconazole therapy for chronic disseminated candidiasis in patients with leukemia and prior amphotericin B therapy. OBJECTIVE: To study the efficacy of fluconazole against chronic disseminated candidiasis (hepatosplenic candidiasis) in patients with leukemia in whom amphotericin B treatment had failed. DESIGN: Retrospective analysis of patients with chronic disseminated candidiasis treated with fluconazole on a compassionate investigational new drug protocol. SETTING: Multi-institutional. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Twenty consecutive patients received 100 to 400 mg of fluconazole per day for a median of 30 weeks. All had either failed to respond to treatment with more than 2 g of amphotericin B or had serious amphotericin B-related toxicities. RESULTS: Fourteen of 16 evaluable patients (88%) responded. Responses were observed in seven of nine patients in whom adequate doses of amphotericin B had failed and in all seven patients who had amphotericin B-related toxicities. In 12 patients, cytotoxic chemotherapy was continued without flare of the infection. Fluconazole was well tolerated with rare side effects. Aspergillus superinfection developed in three patients and contributed to the death of two of them. CONCLUSION: Fluconazole is a safe and effective agent with significant activity against chronic disseminated candidiasis. 
Treatment of blepharospasm and hemifacial spasm with botulinum A toxin: a Canadian multicentre study. Botulinum A exotoxin was recently approved for use in Canada. We describe the efficacy of botulinum toxin in the management of 235 patients with blepharospasm (mean age 64.3 years) and 130 patients with hemifacial spasm (mean age 60.4 years) treated at three Canadian ophthalmologic centres between 1984 and 1989. A total of 98% of the patients with blepharospasm and 100% of the patients with hemifacial spasm had significant relief of their symptoms; however, 11% of the former and 2% of the latter did not respond to the usual starting concentrations of the drug and needed stronger dosages for relief. The duration of relief varied widely in both groups. Up to 7% of patients had ineffective treatments but responded to subsequent injections. Analysis of variance and linear trend statistics showed that there were no changes in the mean duration of relief over the first several treatments for individual patients in either group. Side effects were transient and included ptosis, exposure keratitis, epiphora and strabismus. 
Achalasia: current evaluation and therapy. The current evaluation of and therapy for achalasia are reviewed. Esophageal manometry remains the best means for diagnosing achalasia. Initial therapy can include either pneumatic dilation or esophagomyotomy. Symptomatic improvement occurs in 71% of patients after pneumatic dilation, with a risk of perforation of 1.4%. Eight percent of these patients require subsequent esophagomyotomy. Surgical procedures for achalasia can be performed through either an abdominal or a thoracic incision. Nearly all authors favoring an abdominal approach add an antireflux operation to esophagomyotomy, whereas many authors advocating a transthoracic esophagomyotomy believe that an antireflux wrap is unnecessary. Overall results for the various surgical approaches used as initial therapy are excellent, with symptomatic improvement in 89% of patients, a mortality rate of less than 1%, and development of gastroesophageal acid reflux in less than 10%. Factors governing the choice of initial therapy are discussed. 
Partial-thickness wedge and advancement flap for upper lip repair Reconstruction of upper lip defects demands careful attention in order to reconstitute both normal function and normal appearance. These defects may involve mucosa, orbicularis oris muscle, skin, vermilion, or any combination of these structures. We will describe five cases in which there were defects created by Mohs micrographic surgery and present the concept of partial-thickness wedge in combination with a flap to repair these wounds. 
Acute cholangitis secondary to hepatolithiasis. In a series of 88 patients with acute cholangitis secondary to hepatolithiasis, 26 (30%) required emergency therapeutic intervention because of septicemic shock (n = 15), persistent fever (n = 8), or spreading peritonitis (n = 3). Analysis was made to define factors that predisposed to failure of conservative treatment and characteristics that could predict the need for emergency biliary decompression. The age, incidence of concomitant medical diseases, previous biliary surgery, positive blood culture, bacterial strains resistant to antibiotics used, and multiplicity of bacterial strains in bile cultures in patients who required emergency intervention were similar to these factors in patients who had elective operations after successful conservative management. The incidence of intrahepatic segmental obstruction by stones or strictures was similar, but many more patients who required emergency intervention had concomitant extrahepatic obstruction due to impacted common ductal stones or strictures. Logistic regression analysis of clinical, hematological, and biochemical data showed that maximum pulse rate within 24 hours of presentation (greater than 100 beats per minute, relative risk, 2.8) and platelet count at the time of admission (less than 150 x 10(9)/L, relative risk, 5.2) were the factors with independent significance in predicting the need for emergency therapeutic procedures. This finding may serve as a guideline for identifying high-risk patients for early intervention. 
Narrow duct segment distal to choledochal cyst. "Narrow segments" (or stenotic portions) of the common bile duct (CBD) distal to cysts in two patients (a 50-yr-old woman and a 25-yr-old man) with choledochal cyst (CholCyst) were studied macroscopically and histologically. The narrow segments of the ducts were patent and connected with the main pancreatic duct extraduodenally, whereas the CBD in controls were neither dilated nor stenotic, and joined the main pancreatic duct within the duodenal wall. These narrow segments were 1 cm long. In case 1, a minute orifice was found in the narrow segment of the duct macroscopically and was identified microscopically as a small duct from a pancreatic lobule. In case 2, a small pancreatic duct also joined the narrow segment of the duct. These small pancreatic ducts were derived from the ventral pancreas, based on distribution of PP-islets. Therefore, the narrow duct distal to the cyst in patients with CholCyst (or congenital biliary dilatation) was considered to be a branch of the ventral pancreatic duct. 
Prenatal diagnosis of the neurofibromatoses. This article reviews the application of genetic linkage analysis to molecular prenatal diagnosis using the neurofibromatoses as an example. The clinical manifestations and diagnostic criteria for these diseases are reviewed first, followed by a brief description of the principles underlying genetic linkage analysis, the detection of DNA polymorphisms and their application to the cloning of the NF1 gene. The last two sections review the molecular diagnosis and some of the problems in prenatal genetic counseling for NF1. 
Waking and rising at night as a trigger of myocardial ischemia. A diurnal pattern of changes in transient myocardial ischemia has been well documented in patients with coronary artery disease (CAD) with an increase in the early morning hours. To further investigate potential triggers of ischemia, certain defined and distinct episodes of waking and rising during the nighttime were examined. Of 113 patients who underwent ambulatory monitoring of the electrocardiogram, 466 episodes of ischemia lasting 3,926 minutes were detected in 67 of the patients. In 30 patients who had ischemia at night, 21 reported 36 occasions of waking and rising, and 67% of these events were associated with ST-segment depression. Frequency and duration of ischemia were similar in the nocturnal episodes versus the early morning episodes of ischemia as were the increases in heart rate at 30, 10, 5 and 1 minute before the onset. Even before waking, there was an increase in heart rate beginning approximately 30 minutes before the onset of ischemia. This increase became significant 5 minutes before onset both in the early morning and on rising at night. Patients with nocturnal ischemia had significantly worse clinical signs of CAD. This study shows that rising at night is often associated with episodes of myocardial ischemia and, like the morning events on rising, is likely an important trigger of ischemia in patients with CAD. 
Treatment of compound fractures. Management of compound fractures remains a challenge to the surgeon. Methods to decrease patient morbidity include early fracture stabilization and sequential debridement. External fixation remains the standard; however, early internal fixation in low-grade injuries may be an acceptable option. Early soft tissue coverage is critical. The use of prophylactic parenteral antibiotics has decreased the incidence of acute infection and chronic osteomyelitis. Supplemental use of local antibiotic polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA) beads appears to further diminish the morbidity in high-grade open fractures. 
Chronic osteomyelitis due to Clostridium clostridiiforme. We have reported a case of chronic osteomyelitis due to an unusual anaerobic organism, Clostridium clostridiiforme, a gram-positive rod that often stains gram-negative and that is frequently resistant to such drugs as cefoxitin and clindamycin. Clostridia other than those similar to C perfringens are generally not considered invasive pathogens, but our case and several similar ones show that they can be. 
Long-term results and patterns of disease recurrence after radical operations for lung cancer. Long-term results and patterns of disease recurrences after radical operations for lung cancer between 1975 and 1984 were investigated. Eight hundred fifty-two patients (76.1%) with lung cancer underwent operations during this period. Radical operations were performed on 648 patients. There were 326 (50.6%) pneumonectomies, 314 (48.5%) lung resections (lobectomies), and 8 (1.2%) segmentectomies. Long-term survival rates of 542 patients were studied. In 49.2% of the patients survival was beyond 3 years; in 33% of the patients it was beyond 5 years. Five-year survival was observed in 40.3% +/- 2.5% of patients with N1 and in 19% +/- 4.9% of patients with N2 disease. The differences in survival rates between patients with epidermoid cancer and adenocarcinoma were slight and statistically insignificant. The prognosis was poor in patients with small-cell cancer, large-cell cancer, and dimorphous cancer. The causes of death were studied in 193 patients. Disease recurrence was diagnosed in 75.1% of cases. Bronchopulmonary and concomitant diseases accounted for 19.7% of deaths in these patients. In 5.2% of the patients malignant tumors occurred in other organs. Local-regional recurrences were diagnosed in 33.8% of patients, distant metastases occurred in 55.2% of patients, and 11% of patients had combined disease recurrences. The problem of disease recurrence classification is discussed in the article. 
Left flank retroperitoneal exposure: a technical aid to complex aortic reconstruction. Over the last 5 years an extended left flank retroperitoneal approach was used in 85 of 531 (16%) aortic reconstructions deemed technically complex. Abdominal aortic aneurysm repair was performed in 70 patients (82%), bypass of aortoiliac occlusive disease was performed in 11 (13%), and aortic endarterectomy for mesenteric and/or renovascular disease was performed in 4 (5%). Indications for use of this approach included a "hostile" abdomen (43 patients), juxta/suprarenal abdominal aortic aneurysm (35), large (greater than 10 cm) abdominal aortic aneurysm (12), extreme obesity (10), associated renal and/or visceral artery stenosis requiring endarterectomy (9), inflammatory abdominal aortic aneurysm (2), and horseshoe kidney (2). Suprarenal or supraceliac aortic clamping, averaging 31 minutes, was required in 43 patients (50%). Postoperative recovery was rapid (average length of stay, 10.2 days), and morbidity was minimal despite the complex nature of these reconstructions. The perioperative mortality rate in elective operations was 1.2%. This approach facilitated proximal abdominal aortic exposure and anastomosis, especially in large, pararenal aneurysms or in situations unfavorable to a transabdominal approach. Whereas a left flank retroperitoneal approach can be used in most aortic reconstructions, it seems especially suited to those that pose significant technical challenges. 
Brachial approach to emergency cardiac catheterization during thrombolytic therapy for acute myocardial infarction. TAMI Study Group. The use of the brachial approach to acute coronary intervention has not been previously studied. In the course of the Thrombolysis and Angioplasty in Myocardial Infarction (TAMI) trials, we used the transbrachial approach to cardiac catheterization with or without angioplasty in 202 of 704 (28.6%) patients. The baseline characteristics of age, sex, risk factors, medical history, time from symptom onset to therapy, and left ventricular function were similar for the 2 different approaches. Time from therapy to coronary angiography was not delayed by the brachial approach compared with the femoral approach: 97.1 +/- 26 min vs. 99.9 +/- 133.8 min, respectively. Chemical patency was established in 78 vs. 73% of patients and technical success with acute PTCA with the brachial approach was 89% vs. 78% with the femoral approach. Clinical outcomes were quite similar with respect to death (6 vs. 6%), reocclusion (10 vs. 14%), and emergency coronary bypass surgery (5 vs. 6%). Baseline hematocrit was 43.9 +/- 4.4 and 43.5 +/- 4.8, respectively with a nadir of 32.9 +/- 5.6 vs. 33.0 +/- 5.4. The need for vascular repair occurred in 1% vs. 3% of patients and retroperitoneal hemorrhage was documented in 1% vs. 1% of patients. This study indicates that in the hands of experienced operators the transbrachial approach to acute coronary intervention in the acute phase of treatment with thrombolytic therapy can be used with equal risks and efficacy as the femoral approach. 
Selection criteria for successful immediate breast reconstruction. To evaluate the factors leading to success in immediate breast reconstruction after mastectomy, 176 consecutive immediate reconstructions done with implants or expanders over a 5-year period were analyzed. None of these 176 had "complete muscle coverage." There were only five failures: four with implant loss (one involving radiation) and one removed electively. The failures were 1 in 40 regular implants, 4 in 77 temporary expanders, and 0 in 59 long-term expanders. There is no other report in the literature comparing these different types of implants. Various hypotheses for failure are reviewed. It is concluded that failure in immediate reconstruction is not related to use of drains, bilaterality, or lack of "complete muscle coverage." It is concluded that failure is related to implant type, prior radiation, and most of all to suboptimal patient selection. Specific selection criteria and operative techniques are discussed. 
Fragile X syndrome: diagnosis using highly polymorphic microsatellite markers. We describe two highly polymorphic microsatellite AC repeat sequences, VK23AC and VK14AC, which are closely linked to the fragile X at Xq27.3. Both VK23AC (DXS297) and VK14AC (DXS292) are proximal to the fragile site. Two-point linkage analysis in 31 fragile X families gave (a) a recombination frequency of 1% (range 0.00%-4%) with a maximum lod score of 32.04 for DXS297 and (b) a recombination frequency of 7% (range of 3%-15%) with a maximum lod score of 12.87 for DXS292. Both of these polymorphisms are applicable to diagnosis by linkage in families with fragile X syndrome. A multipoint linkage map of genetic markers at Xq27.3 was constructed from genotyping these polymorphisms in the CEPH pedigrees. The DXS292 marker is in the DXS98-DXS297 interval and in 3 cM proximal to DXS297. 
Gastrointestinal mucosal injury in experimental models of shock, trauma, and sepsis. BACKGROUND AND METHODS: The mucosa of the GI tract serves as an important barrier limiting the systemic absorption of luminal microbes and microbial products. Two methods commonly used to assess the integrity of the GI mucosal barrier are assessment of the extent of microbial translocation and measurement of mucosal permeability to hydrophilic probes. RESULTS: Studies using these methods have provided convincing evidence that the barrier function of the intestinal mucosa is deranged in numerous animal models of shock, trauma, and sepsis. CONCLUSIONS: Although the mechanisms underlying mucosal injury under these circumstances remain incompletely understood, current evidence suggests that mucosal damage in shock, trauma, and sepsis is likely due to various combinations of intracellular hypoxia due to ischemia, tissue injury caused by reactive oxygen metabolites, the deleterious effects of various lipid mediators (e.g., platelet-activating factor) and/or cytokines (e.g., tumor necrosis factor), and deficient utilization or supply of key nutritional substrates (e.g., glutamine). 
Grading of human urothelial carcinoma based on nuclear atypia and mitotic frequency. II. Prognostic importance. A grading system was applied in a retrospective study of 124 patients with transitional cell carcinoma of the bladder using a modified Bergkvist system. The intermediate World Health Organization (WHO) grade II tumors were divided into supposedly benign and malignant forms of grades IIa and IIb, respectively. The 5-year survival was 92% for patients with grade IIa urothelial carcinoma, compared to 43% for patients with grade IIb tumors. The corresponding figures for grades I and III tumors were 100 and 44%, respectively. When excluding carcinoma in situ (5-year survival 50%) no patient with a noninvasive tumor (stage Ta) died of bladder carcinoma within 5 years, compared to 50% of those with invasive cancers (stages T1 to T4). We propose a new grading system in which grades I and IIa are embraced as grade A, grades IIb and III as grade B, and grade IV as grade C. The 5-year survival rate in the 3 grades was 94, 44 and 27%, respectively. Grade A seems to represent a type of tumor with universally favorable prognosis, in contrast to grades B and C. This offers practical advantages, since the former can be treated conservatively, whereas the latter need more urgent radical intervention, especially in patients in whom invasive growth is recorded. 
Expression of c-jun during macrophage differentiation of HL-60 cells. Cellular transcription factors are important in the regulation of cellular genes. Recent studies have indicated that a class of cellular genes known as early response genes are important in the control of cellular growth properties. Two of these genes, c-jun and c-fos, play an important role in the control of cellular differentiation. Because the acute myelogenous leukemia cell line, HL-60, is capable of differentiating to either macrophages or granulocytes, it provides a good model to understand differential gene expression. To determine if the modulation of c-jun was important in the differentiation of HL-60 cells to either macrophages or granulocytes, expression of c-jun mRNA was determined by Northern analysis at various times following treatment with a variety of differentiating agents, including 12-tetradeconyl-phorbol 13-acetate (TPA), retinoic acid (RA), dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), or 1,25 dihydroxyvitamin D3 [1,25 (OH)2 D3]. Both TPA and 1,25(OH)2D3, which induce HL-60 cells to differentiate to macrophages, resulted in marked increases in c-jun mRNA; while RA and DMSO, which induce HL-60 cells to differentiate to granulocytes, did not greatly alter c-jun mRNA expression. HL-60 cell lines resistant to macrophage differentiation after exposure to either 1,25(OH)2D3 or TPA did not result in increases in c-jun mRNA. These results suggest that elevation of c-jun mRNA in HL-60 cells correlated temporally with differentiation to macrophages. Thus, c-jun may be a critical cellular transcription factor involved in macrophage differentiation. 
Presence of the terminal complement complex (C5b-9) precedes myelin degradation in immune-mediated demyelination of the rat peripheral nervous system. In this study, the terminal complement complex C5b-9 (TCC) was localized by immunocytochemistry at different clinical stages of experimental autoimmune neuritis. Deposits of TCC were found on the surface of Schwann cells and their myelin sheaths, and to some extent in the extracellular space at predilective sites of impending demyelination before onset of clinical signs and for a short period thereafter. Additionally, TCC was deposited on the surface of W3/13 positive leukocytes. No TCC immunoreactivity was seen in the distal stump of transected sciatic nerves 1 to 15 days after axotomy. The early and transient deposition of TCC on Schwann cells and myelin sheaths in experimental autoimmune neuritis before overt demyelination suggests that complement activation plays a pathogenic role in the initiation of immune-mediated myelin damage. The lack of TCC immunoreactivity after nerve transection excludes a nonspecific activation process. The signals involved in local TCC formation in demyelinating peripheral nervous system disorders have yet to be explored. 
Results of Medical Research Council phase II study of low dose cisplatin and methotrexate in the primary treatment of locally advanced (T3 and T4) transitional cell carcinoma of the bladder. A series of 49 previously untreated patients with category T3 or T4 bladder cancer underwent treatment with low dose methotrexate and cisplatin; 44 patients were eligible for assessment of response. Complete response (CR) was seen in 5 patients (11%) and partial response in 15 (34%) (overall response rate 45%). Treatment was reasonably well tolerated with no major morbidity and no treatment-related deaths. After a median follow-up of 3.5 years, the 1-year and 2-year survival rates were 70 and 30% respectively. Ten patients remain recurrence-free without having received "definitive local therapy" (cystectomy and/or radiotherapy) at follow-up extending from 20 to 50 months. 
Aspirin in the prevention of thrombosis. More than a decade has passed since the introduction of the concept that inhibition of platelet function may be helpful in preventing the initiation of thrombus formation. Aspirin has been recognized as inhibiting normal platelet function and the mechanism has been clearly delineated. Legions of patients have been studied to answer the question of whether aspirin is efficacious in the primary prevention of acute myocardial infarction. At the present time, however, a solid, clear answer is not available and firm recommendations cannot be made. A large number of studies evaluating aspirin and other antiplatelet agents in the prevention or delay of recurrent myocardial infarction (secondary prevention) have been completed and those studies reporting a favorable beneficial effect are in the minority. In these secondary prevention studies reporting success, the doses of aspirin employed were large enough to inhibit both the cyclo-oxygenase system and thromboxane A2 production as well as the synthesis of prostacyclin. Thus, in these studies if aspirin is effective in reducing adverse cardiovascular events, its efficacy is being mediated by an unknown mechanism. If the reader of the few studies that report positive results is convinced of the benefit of aspirin, it must be emphasized that thoughtful, cautious patient selection based upon the individual's cardiovascular risk profile must be exercised. Individual variation may exist with respect to aspirin's beneficial effect. It must be absolutely recognized that aspirin or any antiplatelet agent does not in any way substitute for the removal or treatment of coexisting risk factors such as tobacco, obesity, hypercholesterolemia, hyperlipidemia, hypertension, and metabolic disease. In contrast to aspirin, control of the above risk factors has been established as beneficial. Aspirin is not free of undesirable side-effects; fatalities secondary to hemorrhage have been reported, and these must be known in detail and understood by both physician and patient before this agent is prescribed in the prophylactic treatment of cardiovascular disease. 
Limb salvage for osteosarcoma in the 1980s. The incidence of local recurrences following limb salvage performed by experienced surgeons with wide surgical margins and with the use of neoadjuvant chemotherapy is sufficiently low (5%-10%) so as not to have a biologically statistically significant impact on the long-term survival rate. Following limb salvage, the incidence of morbidity increases with a few patients occasionally requiring prolonged or repeated hospitalizations and further surgical procedures, even amputation. The durability of the reconstructions is variable, and many of the mobile knee reconstructions may need to be revised if the patients become long-term survivors. The function of salvaged limbs is better than that after the alternative amputation, but none of the reconstructions will give normal function. Finally, no matter which type of surgery on the lower extremity is selected, patients will have a good early psychosocial adjustment if no premorbid psychosocial disorder is present. 
Complement activation by artificial blood substitute Fluosol: in vitro and in vivo studies. A perfluorocarbon blood substitute, Fluosol, is undergoing clinical trials as an adjunct to chemotherapy. The adverse effects associated with its administration have been postulated to result from complement activation. When gel electrophoresis and Western blotting of Fluosol are used after its incubation with serum, activated C3 and factors Bb and H are bound to the Fluosol particles in a time-dependent fashion, which suggests that complement activation with Fluosol, as does that with zymosan, occurs on the surface of the particles. Paradoxically, it is found, both by the measurement of Fluosol-bound C3d and by fluid-phase C5a, that lower concentrations of Fluosol cause greater amounts of complement activation, which suggests a complex interaction of activators and inhibitors that changes as the available surface area is decreased. Studies performed with bystander red cell-bound C3d demonstrated in vivo complement activation occurring in six patients receiving Fluosol as an adjunct to chemotherapy for colon cancer. In two patients, there was a marked increase in red cell-bound C3d after Fluosol infusion; these two patients also developed adverse reactions during Fluosol infusion. These studies suggest that the Fluosol surface plays a major role in the initiation and regulation of complement activation that is seen during Fluosol infusion. 
Early-initiated zidovudine therapy prevents disease but not low levels of persistent retrovirus in mice. An F1 hybrid mouse strain containing the Rfv-3r/s genotype was inoculated with Friend virus complex (FV) and treated with zidovudine (ZDV) intraperitoneally three times daily for 20 days beginning as early as 10 min after initial viral exposure. This strain of mice develops FV-specific neutralizing antibodies that aid in reducing viremia and splenic virus titers but do not prevent splenomegaly and eventual FV-associated death. The virally exposed mice treated with ZDV did not develop splenomegaly or have detectable viremia after the last drug treatment. On day 21, a single animal had demonstrable virus in the spleen as determined by a focal immunoenzyme assay; 57% had detectable virus at 5 weeks, but non displayed splenic virus after 35 weeks. None of the animals died after the 35-week holding period, compared to 38% dying in placebo-treated mice. To detect low levels of the virus, or potentially latent virus, splenocytes were cocultivated with a cell line known to readily propagate FV, and the cells were subsequently passaged four times to amplify replication of the virus. After amplification, a significant increase was seen in the number of mice testing positive for virus. Thus, ZDV treatment initiated early after virus exposure was effective in preventing FV-induced splenomegaly and death, but did not prevent low levels of persistent retrovirus in the mice. 
Epileptiform EEG activity of the centromedian thalamic nuclei in children with intractable generalized seizures of the Lennox-Gastaut syndrome. Centromedian thalamic nuclei (CM) epileptiform EEG activities were recorded in children with intractable generalized seizures of Lennox-Gastaut syndrome (LGS) through implanted recording-stimulating electrodes used for seizure control. Ictal CM epileptiform activities were consistently correlated to widespread surface cortical EEG activities and symptoms in all patients and all types of generalized seizures; i.e., fast spike discharges at CM correlated at onset of tonic and tonic-clonic generalized seizures; slow (1-2 Hz) spike-wave complex discharges at CM correlated for atypical absence seizures; slow polyspike-wave complex discharges correlated for myoclonic seizures; and spike bursts and suppression patterns correlated for combined tonic-atonic-myoclonic seizures. Ictal EEG activities occurred simultaneously at right and left CM and surface at onset of all seizure types, with the exception of myoclonic seizures where CM complete discharges and individual spike-wave complexes significantly lead those of the surface. Brief tonic-atonic spasms clinically undistinguishable from "real" epileptic seizures showed no EEG counterparts at CM and surface. Interictal CM spike-wave complete discharges and individual spike-wave complexes showed variable amplitude-temporal patterns. Amplitude emphasis on CM and frontopolar regions was observed in most of complete discharges, however, and phase shifts between CM and frontopolar regions were observed in individual spike-wave complexes. 
HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor-induced myopathy in the rat: cyclosporine A interaction and mechanism studies. Recent clinical evidence indicates a potential for skeletal muscle toxicity after therapy with HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors (HMGRIs) in man. Although the incidence of drug-induced skeletal muscle toxicity is very low (0.1-0.2%) with monotherapy, it may increase following concomitant drug therapy with the immunosuppressant, cyclosporine A (CsA), and possibly with certain other hypolipidemic agents. In the Sprague-Dawley rat, very high, pharmacologically comparable dosages (150-1200 mg/kg/day) of structurally similar HMGRIs (lovastatin, simvastatin, pravastatin and L-647, 318) produced dose-related increases in the incidence and severity of skeletal muscle degeneration. Physical signs included inappetence, decreased activity, loss of body weight, localized alopecia and mortality. To evaluate the interaction between HMGRIs and CsA, a rat model of CsA-induced cholestasis was developed. In this 2-week model, the skeletal muscle toxicity of the HMGRIs was clearly potentiated by CsA (10 mg/kg/day). Doses of HMGRIs which did not produce skeletal muscle toxicity when given alone caused between 75 and 100% incidence of myopathy (very slight to marked skeletal muscle degeneration) when CsA was coadministered. Typical light microscopic changes included myofiber necrosis with interstitial edema and inflammatory infiltration in areas of acute injury. Histochemical characterization of the muscle lesion indicated that type 2B fibers (primarily glycolytic white fibers) were most sensitive to this toxicity but that, with prolonged administration, all fiber types were ultimately affected. Results of pharmacokinetic studies in rats treated with various HMGRIs +/- CsA indicated that coadministration of CsA alters the disposition of these compounds, resulting in increased systemic exposure (e.g., increased area under the plasma drug concentration vs. time curve-AUC) and consequent (up to 13-fold) increases in skeletal muscle drug levels. Evaluation of the potential interaction between the HMGRI, lovastatin and CsA at the level of hepatic microsomal metabolism indicated that CsA did not inhibit the metabolism of lovastatin in isolated microsomes from female rats. In light of the above findings, it appears that HMGRI-induced myopathy is a class effect in the rat, which is potentiated by CsA as the result of altered clearance and resultant increased tissue exposure. Cholestasis associated with CsA and HMGRIs may form the basis for decreased elimination and the resultant elevated systemic exposure. Furthermore, this toxicity is muscle fiber-selective and may be associated with impaired skeletal muscle energy metabolism. 
Age of onset in siblings concordant for multiple sclerosis. We have evaluated genetic and environmental influences in multiple sclerosis (MS) by comparing age of onset in 99 sibling pairs concordant for the disease. We used three methods of analysis: (1) comparison of mean differences in age of onset and year of onset, (2) linear regression of differences in age or year of onset vs difference in ages, and (3) intraclass correlation of age of onset which is also used for monozygotic twins concordant for MS. Comparison of the mean differences in age of onset or year of onset is found to be inappropriate and potentially misleading. No significant results were found in linear regression of the age of onset or year of onset vs differences in ages, although a trend towards onset at the same age is present. However, nontwin siblings show a significant intraclass correlation for age of onset (P less than 0.01) as is seen in genetic disorders. A stronger intraclass correlation in age of onset in concordant monozygotic twins vs concordant sibling pairs further suggests that age of onset is partly under genetic control, assuming common exposure to an environmental agent. The results give little support for common exposure to an environmental trigger in concordant MS sibling pairs. They are consistent with a mixture of random independent exposures and common exposures leading to the development of the disease, with the former predominating. 
Prolonged lumbar spinal drainage after the resection of tumors of the skull base: a cautionary note. A combined transcranial and facial approach was used for an en bloc resection of a malignant angiosarcoma of the ethmoid sinuses. The patient awoke neurologically intact and was monitored in the Intensive Care Unit. A lumbar subarachnoid drain was placed for the continuous removal of the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). Approximately 36 hours after surgery, she deteriorated neurologically and demonstrated bilateral extensor posturing to painful stimuli. A computed tomographic scan demonstrated obliteration of the basal cisterns indicative of transtentorial herniation and a small amount of extradural air. Eight hours after the lumbar drain was turned off, the patient had recovered completely. We propose that the patient manifested transtentorial herniation caused by a pressure gradient between the supratentorial and lumbar cistern compartments brought on by the continuous removal of CSF from the lumbar subarachnoid space. We suggest that ventricular drainage should be considered for these cases rather than lumbar drainage. This offers the same advantage of removing the CSF and maintaining low-to-normal intracranial pressure without the risk of transtentorial herniation. 
A management plan for tongue base cancer that includes brachytherapy. For physiologic as well as oncologic reasons, there has been an increasing interest in radiation therapy as the primary treatment of base of tongue carcinoma. At Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, we have used such a plan, using external beam conventional therapy in combination with an interstitial boost of iridium 192 to the primary site, plus planned neck dissections in selected patients. Between 1981 and 1986, 17 patients with untreated base of tongue squamous cell carcinoma were treated in this manner. Thirteen of the 17 are disease-free as a result of this therapy. Two patients have failed locally, yielding an actuarial local control of 87% at a median followup of 2 years. These data would suggest that primary radiation that includes interstitial therapy as part of the plan, along with neck dissection in certain situations, is a worthwhile method management of base of tongue carcinoma. 
Pelvic osteosarcoma. Resection, reconstruction, local control, and survival statistics. Nine patients with a malignant tumor in the periacetabular region of the pelvis were treated with a Type IIC resection and were reconstructed using a cementless, adaptable prosthetic system. In two patients, a new planning strategy was applied using three-dimensional reconstruction. There were two chondrosarcomas, three Ewing-sarcomas, two osteosarcomas, and two metastases of thyroid cancer. Excision was wide, marginal, and intralesional in three cases each. Ages ranged from eight to 68 years (average, 40 years), and follow-up periods ranged from 12 to 36 months with an average of 27 months. Overall functional evaluation was good in five cases, fair in three, and poor in one. Four patients died of local recurrences and lung metastases; all of them had marginal or intralesional resections. Histologic analysis of one retrieved specimen revealed bone ingrowth with connective tissue interface. Three-dimensional planning has proven to be a very valuable tool for achieving an anatomic reconstruction of the pelvic ring. These results are encouraging and endorse the authors to continue with the current approach of prosthetic reconstruction following Type IIC resections. 
A double-blind comparison of low-dose intravenous ketamine and methohexital in adults. Two ultralight general anesthetic techniques, one using low-dose ketamine and the other using methohexital as the primary anesthetic agent, were compared for efficacy, safety, and psychomotor recovery in a double-blind fashion for use during third molar surgery. Low-dose intravenous ketamine as the primary anesthetic following premedication with fentanyl and midazolam, and in conjunction with nitrous oxide, appeared to produce less hypoxia, hypercarbia, and apnea than when methohexital was used. No significant differences were noted in heart rate or blood pressure between the techniques. The ketamine technique was universally preferred by the surgeons and anesthesiologists because of superior patient cooperation and airway management. No unpleasant psychomimetic side effects of significance were noted with the use of ketamine. Postoperative recovery took slightly longer in the ketamine group, with patients being judged fit for discharge approximately 10 to 15 minutes later than the patients who received methohexital. 
CNS pathology in the neurological mutant rats zitter, tremor and zitter-tremor double mutant (spontaneously epileptic rat, SER). Exaggeration of clinical and neuropathological phenotypes in SER. The pathological alterations in the central nervous system (CNS) were examined in three kinds of mutant rat; the zitter (zi/zi; Zi), the tremor rat (tm/tm; Tm) and the spontaneously epileptic rat (SER) which is a double mutant carrying both zitter and tremor genes. Two major alterations demonstrated in these mutants were hypomyelination and vacuolation or spongy degeneration. Hypomyelination was observed predominantly in SER and to a lesser extent in Zi, and was accompanied by a redundant or aberrant myelin sheath formation in addition to a decreased number of myelinated fibres. This appeared to be related to the occurrence of tremor. There was no abnormality in the structure of the myelin lamellae and oligodendrocytes or any destruction of myelin sheaths by phagocytic cells. The number of radial components in CNS myelin was increased almost equally in Zi, Tm and SER. Vacuolation was prominent in SER and Tm, especially in the brainstem and thalamus. Zi also developed mild vacuolation with advancing age. Vacuolation seemed to be related to the epileptic phenomena in SER and Tm. Vacuoles consisted mainly of swollen astrocytic processes and enlargement of the extracellular space, as well as occasional enlargement of periaxonal spaces. Thus both pathological findings--the hypomyelination derived from the zitter mutation with tremor, and the vacuolation from the tremor mutation with epileptic symptoms--were mutually exaggerated in SER. It is postulated that the two different genetic loci with zi and tm mutations interact and synergistically reinforce each other both clinically and pathologically in SER. 
Catalase-negative listeria monocytogenes causing meningitis in an adult. Clinical and laboratory features. A 63-year-old previously healthy woman presented with acute meningitis. Cultures of the cerebrospinal fluid yielded a serotype 1/2a isolate of Listeria monocytogenes that was biochemically typical in all respects, other than the reproducible lack of catalase production. During therapy, the patient developed oculomotor dysfunction that was attributed to an abscess in the internal capsule. This case report documents the existence of catalase-negative L. monocytogenes indicating that catalase production should not be a strict criterion for identification of Listeria. Furthermore, this clinical experience extends in vitro and experimental animal studies indicating that catalase production is not a necessary virulence factor for invasion by Listeria. 
Perioperative respiratory compliance in children undergoing repair of atrial septal defects. Children with atrial septal defects (ASD) have less respiratory compliance (Crs) than normal cohorts. There could be implications for anaesthetic management if these children also have decreased compliance during anaesthesia. To examine the changes in Crs before, during and following surgical correction of the atrial defect, Crs was measured in 29 infants and children, 15 undergoing correction of secundum type atrial septal defects, and a group of 14 children of similar weight undergoing non-thoracic surgery. During sedation, Crs was measured using the single breath technique (SBT) and during anaesthesia, both before and after the surgical procedure, an inflation technique was applied to determine Crs. To investigate the aetiology of the difference in Crs, the pulmonary to systemic flow ratio (Qp:Qs) was determined using echocardiography during sedation in the ASD patients. During sedation, Crs in the ASD group was 52.7 +/- 19.5% less than in the control group. The slope of the line of regression of Crs vs height for the ASD group was significantly less (P less than 0.05) than that of the control group during sedation. However, during anaesthesia, Crs in the ASD group was not significantly different from the control group either before or after surgery. The per cent decrease in Crs during sedation in the children with ASD, in comparison with the control group, did not correlate with the Qp:Qs ratio of the ASD group (r2 = 0.012,NS). We conclude that, in spite of lower Crs during sedation, infants and children with ASD do not have lower Crs during anaesthesia and cardiopulmonary bypass than normal controls undergoing non-thoracic surgery. 
Proliferative assessment of GFAP-positive and GFAP-negative glioma cells by nucleolar organizer region staining. The proliferative potential of two types of tumor cells that did or did not express glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) in 19 cases of high-grade gliomas, including nine anaplastic astrocytomas (WHO criteria, grade 3) and 10 glioblastoma multiforme (grade 4), was investigated by a combined staining technique, one-step silver colloid method for nucleolar organizer region-associated argyrophilic protein (Ag-NOR) and immunocytochemistry for GFAP. The mean numbers of Ag-NORs in GFAP-positive cells and GFAP-negative cells of high-grade gliomas were 2.68 and 3.74, respectively. The value of GFAP-negative cells was significantly greater than that of GFAP-positive cells (p less than 0.01). Our results show that, by means of the immunocytochemistry for GFAP, tumor cells in human high-grade gliomas can be divided into two groups expressing GFAP or not, and that the mean number of Ag-NORs of GFAP-negative cells is more representative of the degree of histological malignancy than that of positive cells. It is considered that the proliferative assessment of GFAP-negative tumor cells in high-grade gliomas by combined staining of Ag-NOR silver staining and GFAP immunocytochemistry is useful for understanding the histological malignancy of high-grade gliomas. 
Twenty-four-hour variation of blood pressure in vascular dementia of the Binswanger type. Using a noninvasive portable blood pressure recorder, we compared 24-hour variations of blood pressure among 1) 35 patients with Binswanger-type dementia, 2) 43 with lacunar-type dementia, 3) 26 with a single lacunar stroke, and 4) 30 controls. Each group was divided into antihypertensive-treated and -untreated subgroups. Among the untreated subgroups, patients with Binswanger-type dementia had significantly greater 24-hour mean systolic blood pressures, 24-hour systolic blood pressure standard deviations, and maximal systolic blood pressure variations than the controls (p less than 0.05). Among the treated patients, blood pressure variability increased similarly in all subgroups with cerebrovascular lesions compared with the controls (p less than 0.05). The nocturnal blood pressure decreases seen in the controls were absent among both untreated and treated patients with Binswanger- or lacunar-type dementia (p less than 0.05). Our results suggest the importance of hypertension, short-term variations in blood pressure, and a sustained nighttime elevation of blood pressure for the pathogenesis of both Binswanger-type and lacunar-type dementia in patients receiving antihypertensive medication. 
Radial nerve paralysis and tumor. This paper presents ten cases of radial nerve paralysis because of tumor and reviews 38 previously reported cases. The tumor distribution was 35 lipomas, four neurofibromas, four ganglions, three neuromas, one fibroma, and one neurilemoma. Malignant tumors are not discussed in this review. Electromyography is of value if diagnostic problems occur. Postoperative results are normally good. 
Dynamic F waves in neurogenic claudication. Serial F waves were elicited before and after ambulation in 2 patients with neurogenic claudication. In both patients dynamic changes in F wave parameters consisting of either unelicitability or increased latencies occurred postexercise. The time course of these changes and their subsequent rapid reversibility over 15 minutes suggest ischemic-induced conduction block and slowing in proximal motor axons. These physiological changes may account for some of the dynamic neurological symptoms of this disorder. Moreover, F wave exercise testing may provide corroborative information for the diagnosis of neurogenic claudication. 
Ten-year survivors after surgical treatment and perioperative irradiation for esophageal carcinoma. Ten of 150 patients with primary squamous cell carcinoma of the esophagus and surgically treated, survived for more than 10 years. All 10 underwent a complete resection of the primary tumor and extensive lymph node dissection plus perioperative irradiation. The clinicopathologic findings in these 10 patients were reviewed. Five were female. Seven of the tumors exceeded 6 cm in length; seven were early stage, and the remaining three were advanced stage tumors. Lymph node metastases were evident in three, lymph vessel permeation was recognized in four, and no vascular vessel permeation was seen in any tumor. Two tumors had a characteristic appearance of carcinoma with lymphoid stroma, suggesting a good prognosis. In six for which cytophotometric DNA analysis could be done, four were type II, two were type III, and none was type IV. Thus, a complete resection of the primary tumor and extensive lymph node dissection can lead to a long survival time even for those with an advanced primary esophageal carcinoma. 
Determination of prostate volume by transrectal ultrasound. Estimation of prostate gland volume with transrectal ultrasound may provide important information in the evaluation of benign and malignant prostatic diseases. To determine the most accurate means of volume estimation 150 patients underwent transrectal ultrasound with 15 separate methods of volume estimation. All patients underwent subsequent radical prostatectomy or cystoprostatectomy. Prostate specimen weights were compared with the results of each volume estimation method. Step-section planimetry, previously assumed to be the most accurate means of volume measurement, exhibited a Pearson correlation coefficient of 0.93. The elliptical volume, widely used as an alternative to planimetry, demonstrated a correlation coefficient of 0.90. The most accurate method to estimate prostate weight (r = 0.94) was a variation of the prolate spheroid formula, expressed as pi/6 (transverse dimension)2 (anteroposterior dimension). When different volume ranges were considered, this prolate spheroid formula provided the closest estimate of weight in glands of less than 40 gm. and those in the 40 to 80 gm. range. The most accurate method to estimate prostates weighing greater than 80 gm. was the formula pi/6 (transverse dimension)3. 
Endoscopic therapy for early colon cancer: the strip biopsy resection technique. Strip biopsy is an endoscopic tissue resection technique in which a lesion and its surrounding tissues are first elevated using physiological saline. The saline solution is injected into the submucosa at the site of the lesion with the help of needle forceps. A snare is placed around the elevated tissue, which is then resected endoscopically by electrocoagulation. The specimen obtained includes both submucosal and mucosal tissues. The authors used this technique to resect a total of 71 lesions of the colon. They were classified histologically as 21 adenocarcinomas, 46 adenomas, 3 metaplastic polyps, and 1 juvenile polyp. All lesions were confirmed to be entirely intramucosal by histological examination. The strip biopsy technique permits resection of tissue down to the submucosal layer regardless of the morphological type of the lesion. This suggests that strip biopsy is an effective new form of endoscopic treatment for early colon cancer. 
Fecal carriage of Streptococcus bovis and colorectal adenomas. An association between fecal carriage of Streptococcus bovis and colorectal carcinoma has been reported. A relationship between S. bovis and colorectal adenomas has also been suggested. In the present study, the relationship between S. bovis and adenomas was investigated. Two of 18 current adenoma patients (11%) were found to have S. bovis in their stool compared with 12 of 84 controls (14%). Six of 38 patients who had ever had a diagnosis of adenoma (16%) had S. bovis compared with 8 of 64 controls (13%). These results rule out a strong association between fecal carriage of S. bovis and adenomas; however, because of the relatively small sample size, a weak to moderate association cannot be excluded. 
Eicosanoids regulate tumor necrosis factor synthesis after hemorrhage in vitro and in vivo. The aim of this investigation was to determine whether PGE2 regulates TNF release in vitro and in vivo following hemorrhage. To study this, C3H/HeN mice were bled to a mean blood pressure (BP) of 35 mm Hg, maintained for 60 minutes, and then resuscitated. For in vitro studies, peritoneal (pM phi) and splenic (sM phi) macrophages obtained at 2 hours and 24 hours after hemorrhage were stimulated with LPS for 24 or 48 hours with or without ibuprofen (IBU). For in vivo studies, M phi were harvested 24 hours following hemorrhage with and without IBU treatment and stimulated with LPS for 48 hours. The decreased TNF release by pM phi but not sM phi from hemorrhaged mice was restored by IBU in vitro. IBU treatment in vivo significantly enhanced TNF release by pM phi compared with untreated hemorrhaged animals, while TNF release by sM phi was only slightly increased. These data indicate a major role of PGE2 in the regulation of TNF release by pM phi following hemorrhage. 
Sex hormones in postmenopausal women with primary biliary cirrhosis. To evaluate serum sex hormone profiles in nonalcoholic postmenopausal women with liver disease, 25 women with primary biliary cirrhosis (11 in cirrhotic stage) and 46 healthy controls were studied. The patients had significantly (p less than 0.05) elevated serum concentrations of estrone and androstenedione and significantly (p less than 0.05) lower concentrations of estrone sulfate, dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate and 5 alpha-dihydrotestosterone compared with the 46 controls. Serum concentrations of sex hormone binding globulin, testosterone, non-sex hormone binding globulin-bound testosterone and non-protein-bound testosterone did not differ significantly (p greater than 0.05) between primary biliary cirrhosis patients and controls. Patients in the cirrhotic stage had significantly (p less than 0.05) higher concentrations of sex hormone binding globulin than did controls. Patients in the cirrhotic stage had significantly (p less than 0.05) higher sex hormone binding globulin and estrone sulfate levels compared with noncirrhotic patients with primary biliary cirrhosis. Otherwise, no significant differences were observed between cirrhotic and noncirrhotic patients. The observed changes in steroid concentrations may be a consequence of hepatic dysfunction. 
DNA image cytometry of keratoacanthoma and squamous cell carcinoma. The distinction between the keratoacanthoma (KA) and the squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) can sometimes be difficult on the basis of histologic and clinical criteria. The possible diagnostic significance of DNA ploidy initiated the present study evaluating the DNA ploidy in paraffin-embedded tissue sections of 7 KA and 15 SCC, and fresh frozen tissue touch preparations of 15 of the same cases using the CAS 200 Image Analyzer. In paraffin-embedded tissue sections the main peak DNA index was based on normal epidermis, and ranged from 1.03 to 1.59 in KA and from 1.47-2.71 in SCC. The DNA Index (DI) discriminated KA from SCC in 17 of 22 cases (p less than 0.0007). The highest DNA content of single nuclei ranged from 9.0-18.0 picograms (pg) (DI 2.9-6.03) in KA and 14.8-38.6 pg (DI 4.0-11.03) in SCC. The highest DNA content discriminated KA from SCC in 16 of 22 cases (p less than 0.003). In fresh frozen tissue touch preparations from 15 of the same lesions, there was considerable overlap in DNA indices of KA (0.534-1.39) and SCC (0.464-1.41). Abnormal DNA peaks seen in histograms from three SCC in paraffin-embedded tissue sections were lost in the touch preparation histograms, probably due to inadequate sampling. Therefore, image analysis of paraffin-embedded tissue sections is better able to distinguish KA from SCC than touch preparations.
