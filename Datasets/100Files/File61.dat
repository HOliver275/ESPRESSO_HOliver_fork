Varicella zoster virus DNA in throat swabs. Eighty-one throat swabs from 18 patients infected with varicella were tested for varicella zoster virus DNA by the polymerase chain reaction. The positive rates were 26.2% (11/42) during the incubation period and 89.7% (35/39) after clinical onset. The results indicate the pharynx is a site for early replication of the virus. 
Content and boundaries of medicine in long-term care: physicians talk about stroke. Twenty physicians were interviewed about roles, treatments, goals, and relationships with older patients, especially stroke patients. Findings from this descriptive, anthropological investigation address the problem of congruence between needs and existing services, and in doing so, recast the ongoing debate about the medicalization of long-term care. This study emphasized the nonmedical features of geriatric medicine in general and stroke care in particular. In many instances, these physicians attempt to bridge gaps between medical and emotional needs and clinical and social services with social and psychotherapeutic as well as biomedical interventions. Because we found physicians' activities with stroke patients to be so broadly construed, treatment and management of stroke may be seen as paradigmatic for the role of physicians in long-term care. 
The risk of seizure recurrence following a first unprovoked seizure: a quantitative review. Knowledge of the recurrence risk following a first unprovoked seizure and the predictors of that risk are necessary for rational treatment decisions. Published estimates of recurrence risk range from 23% to 71%. In a meta-analysis of 16 reports, three methodologic factors explained much of the reported variation: (1) study inclusion criteria, ie, whether patients were enrolled at the time of their first seizure or if patients with prior seizures were included; (2) retrospective versus prospective ascertainment of patients; (3) the interval between the first seizure and the time at which risk was assessed. The average recurrence risk across the 16 studies was 51%. The risk was 40% and 52% in prospective and retrospective studies that employed first-seizure methods and 67% in non-first seizure studies. At or near 2 years following the first seizure, the recurrence risk was 36% and 47% in prospective and retrospective first-seizure studies. The distribution of prognostic factors was also important. Seizure etiology and the EEG were the strongest predictors of recurrence distinguishing between patient subgroups, with recurrence risks as low as 24% and as high as 65%. Partial seizures were associated with an increased recurrence risk, but not consistently. There is considerable agreement among studies concerning the recurrence risk following a first seizure, and much of the discrepancies among studies can be explained by differences in study methods and distributions of important prognostic factors. 
Pathological features of Crohn's disease determining perforation. Even if Crohn's disease (CD) stenoses are related to perforating complications, such as abscess or fistula, it remains unclear why only some stenoses lead to such complications. We have studied the surgical specimens in 94 cases of CD to characterize the anatomical features of stenosis. We found no differences between group A (patients with perforation) and group B (noncomplicated patients) as far as extent of lesion, number of stenoses, and the caliber of the stenotic bowel. In CD of the ileum, the wall thickness of the stenoses was significantly different: 12.0 +/- 3.4 mm in group A and 7.6 +/- 3.1 mm in group B (p less than 0.001). In colonic CD, the length of stenosis was significantly greater in patients with perforation. Duration of symptoms, age at surgery, and sex did not correlate with the increased thickness or with perforating complications. These observations suggest that the fibrotic gastrointestinal tract, poorly distensible, may increase the intraluminal pressure above the stenosis and in this way squeeze bowel content through mucosal fissures of the inflamed bowel. Evaluation and monitoring of wall thickness may help in prompting surgery before the disease is complicated by perforation. 
Prevalence and prognostic significance of silent and symptomatic ischemia after coronary bypass surgery: a report from the Coronary Artery Surgery Study (CASS) randomized population. The prevalence and prognostic significance of postoperative myocardial ischemia, as detected by exercise testing, were prospectively assessed in 174 patients from the Coronary Artery Surgery Study (CASS) randomized surgical population who had exercise testing before and 6 months after coronary artery bypass graft surgery. Whereas the prevalence of symptomatic ischemia significantly decreased postoperatively (52% vs. 6%, p less than 0.001), the frequency of silent myocardial ischemia did not change (30% vs. 29%). Survival at 12 years after bypass surgery based on the 6-month postoperative exercise test results was significantly better for the 112 patients with no ischemia (80%) than for the 51 patients with silent ischemia (68%) or the 11 patients with symptomatic ischemia (45%). These data show that coronary artery bypass graft surgery diminishes the overall prevalence of symptomatic but not silent ischemia and that both silent and symptomatic ischemia adversely affect the postoperative prognosis of these patients. 
Subrenal capsule assay using nude mice as a predictor of the response of the gastric cancer to chemotherapy. Feasibility of utilizing human gastric cancers as first transplant generation xenografts in nude mice for determining tumor sensitivity to chemotherapeutic agents was demonstrated by applying subrenal capsule (SRC) assay. A total of 55 human gastric tumors from patients were tested in this assay. Mitomycin-C (MMC) and hexycarbamyl-5-FU (HCFU, 5-FU derivative) were selected for the treatment of these patients after surgery and also for this assay as first transplant. Evaluable rate of MMC in this assay was 92.7% and that of HCFU was 90.9%. Sensitivity of tumors to MMC was 25% and to HCFU was 32%. Correlation between response to chemotherapy of human tumors in patients and in nude mice was 78.6%. These results indicate that this assay could predict effective drugs for patients with gastric cancer. 
Preclinical markers in studies of Parkinson's disease. The development of reliable preclinical detection procedures for idiopathic Parkinson's disease may be the fundamental advance required for the establishment of the cause, the natural history, and ultimately, the prevention of this neurodegenerative disorder. The usefulness of these preclinical markers in efforts to better understand the etiology and development of this disorder will relate to whether they are direct measures of dopamine production or indirect measures such as metabolic changes or comorbidity, whether they can be used in the first or later decades of life, whether they are invasive, and whether they are expensive and sophisticated or simple and cheap. An overview of the criteria for evaluation of the utility of specific markers, as well as an assessment of the importance of early markers in future research, is presented. 
Rapid growth of untreated esophageal squamous-cell carcinoma in 10 patients. We documented the natural history of esophageal carcinoma and its rapid growth by measuring the change in tumor diameter radiographically in 10 patients during an observation period because the diagnosis had been missed. Nine men and one woman (age range, 48-74 years; mean, 60 years) were included in the study. Eight patients had undergone esophagography for gastrointestinal complaints and had lesions missed on the initial interpretation that were apparent on retrospective review after the patient had returned with more severe complaints and undergone repeat studies; two patients had refused treatment. The tumor was squamous-cell carcinoma in all. The treatment-free retrospective observation period ranged from 4 to 19 months (mean, 12.2 months) and was shorter for elevated (mean, 9.2 months) than for depressed lesions (mean, 16.8 months). The longitudinal diameter increased from 10-100 mm initially (mean, 30.5 mm) to 32-150 mm (mean, 74.9 mm). No correlation existed between the increase in size and histologic features. This documentation of the rapid increase in the size of esophageal carcinoma involving at least the submucosa confirms clinical impressions of the aggressive nature of this lesion and offers an explanation of why this disease is seldom detected at an early stage and long-term survival is so poor after the early stage of disease. 
Primary intrasellar coccidioidomycosis simulating a pituitary adenoma. The case of a 68-year-old woman who had relatively acute, unilateral ophthalmoplegia is reported. Radiological studies indicated a mass lesion involving the pituitary gland and left cavernous sinus. Pathological tissue obtained by the transsphenoidal approach revealed the presence of a Coccidioides granuloma. This pathological entity should be considered when evaluating patients with a pituitary mass and ophthalmoplegia. 
Mapping of DNA instability at the fragile X to a trinucleotide repeat sequence p(CCG)n. The sequence of a Pst I restriction fragment was determined that demonstrate instability in fragile X syndrome pedigrees. The region of instability was localized to a trinucleotide repeat p(CCG)n. The sequence flanking this repeat were identical in normal and affected individuals. The breakpoints in two somatic cell hybrids constructed to break at the fragile site also mapped to this repeat sequence. The repeat exhibits instability both when cloned in a nonhomologous host and after amplification by the polymerase chain reaction. These results suggest variation in the trinucleotide repeat copy number as the molecular basis for the instability and possibly the fragile site. This would account for the observed properties of this region in vivo and in vitro. 
Correlation of the blind spot size to the area of the optic disk and parapapillary atrophy. We evaluated the relationship between the optic disk and the blind spot area. Using kinetic Goldmann perimetry in 23 patients with open-angle glaucoma and 19 normal subjects, the blind spot size was correlated significantly with the total area of the optic disk, peripapillary scleral ring, and parapapillary chorioretinal atrophy. Zone beta of the parapapillary atrophy with a visible sclera was attributed to an absolute scotoma, and zone alpha with irregular pigmentation was attributed to a relative scotoma. The blind spot was significantly larger in the glaucomatous eyes than in the normal eyes, which corresponded with a larger zone beta in the glaucomatous eyes. The intrapapillary and parapapillary region of the optic nerve head correlated to the size of the blind spot, which included the parapapillary chorioretinal atrophy and a significant size difference between normal and glaucomatous eyes. 
Gastroenteritis associated with consumption of raw shellfish--Hawaii, 1991. On January 2, 1991, 12 of 24 persons who attended one or more of three New Year's celebrations in Honolulu, Hawaii, had onset of gastrointestinal illness. An investigation by the Epidemiology Branch of the Hawaii Department of Health (HDOH) determined that the only common foods shared by participants were oysters and clams provided by one distributor. 
Familial juvenile polyposis coli and colorectal cancer. A 40-year-old mother and her 7-year-old son underwent colectomy for polyposis coli. Both colectomy specimens contained predominantly juvenile polyps. The mother's specimen also had numerous tubular adenomas and one 5-cm severely dysplastic villous adenoma without invasive carcinoma. Foci of adenomatous change in juvenile polyps were present in the son's specimen. The histologic features of both cases suggest a sequence of change from juvenile polyps to adenomatous polyps to cancer. 
Mesenteric infarction secondary to tumor emboli from primary aortic sarcoma. Guidelines for diagnosis and management. Primary aortic tumors are rare, difficult to diagnose, and often fatal. This case and a review of the literature identified aortic tumors as a potential source of emboli leading to acute mesenteric insufficiency. The case showed the efficacy of magnetic resonance imaging in diagnosing and determining the extent and location of an aortic tumor. 
MDR1 gene expression and treatment outcome in acute myeloid leukemia To prospectively assess the role of MDR1 gene expression in patients with de novo acute myeloid leukemia (AML), levels of MDR1 RNA in blast cells were determined at diagnosis and correlated with treatment outcome in 63 patients. MDR1 RNA levels were negative in 29% and positive in 71% of the patients. The complete remission rate in response to induction chemotherapy was 89% for MDR1 RNA-negative patients and 53% for MDR1 RNA-positive patients (P = .008). Expression of the MDR1 gene was observed in most patients who died early or had resistant disease. Kaplan-Meier curves revealed a decrease in both disease-free survival and overall survival of patients with detectable MDR1 gene expression compared with the disease-free survival and overall survival of MDR1 RNA-negative patients (P = .029 and P = .009, respectively). These data indicate that MDR1 gene expression is an unfavorable prognostic factor and suggest that multidrug resistance is important in AML. 
Increased dopamine-induced nephrogenous cAMP formation in hypertension. Low doses of exogenous dopamine (3 micrograms/kg/min) were administered intravenously to nine patients with essential hypertension and to six age-matched healthy volunteers. During infusion with dopamine, mean arterial blood pressure decreased in hypertensive patients whereas it did not change in normotensive subjects. Basal levels of sodium excretion were comparable in hypertensive and normotensive subjects. The natriuretic response to dopamine was significantly greater in hypertensive patients. Urinary and nephrogenous cAMP significantly increased in both normotensive and hypertensive subjects. The increase of nephrogenous cAMP was more pronounced in hypertensive patients than in normotensive controls. A significant correlation was found between nephrogenous cAMP and sodium excretion. The enhanced natriuretic response to dopamine in hypertensive patients may be due to increased cAMP formation in response to tubular dopamine receptor stimulation. This is in agreement with the hypothesis of either up-regulation or affinity changes of renal dopamine receptors in patients with essential hypertension, secondary to a decreased endogenous production of intrarenal dopamine. 
Surveillance for recurrent stenosis after endovascular procedures. A prospective study. Eighty-nine endovascular procedures were performed during a 1-year period. Techniques included balloon angioplasty (n = 50), laser-assisted balloon angioplasty (n = 32), and atherectomy (n = 7). Indications were claudication (65.2%), critical ischemia (30.3%), and failing bypass (4.5%). Preoperative evaluation included a history and physical examination, segmental limb pressures, and color duplex ultrasonography. Postoperative surveillance consisted of a history and physical examination, ankle-arm indexes, and color duplex examinations at 1-week, 1-month, and then 3-month intervals. All levels of aortoiliac and infrainguinal disease were treated. Immediate technical success rate was 89.8%. Recurrence rates by life-table analysis reveal a 9-month patency rate of 45.4%. Early results of this prospective study indicate that endovascular procedures are subject to significant restenosis rates. Restraint is advised concerning general acceptance of endovascular procedures pending critical study. 
Pain and vascular reflexes in man elicited by prolonged noxious mechano-stimulation. Interdigital webs of the hands of human volunteers were pinched for periods of 2 min duration to induce tonic pain perceptions. During stimulation, the subjects gave estimates of their pain level at 10-sec intervals on a visual analogue scale, and the stimulus induced changes of the skin blood flow in the stimulated hand was assessed by photo-plethysmography. Sustained pinching induced a tonic reflex vasoconstriction in the stimulated hand with rather slow adaptation rate and no signs of habituation between trials. Step increases of the pinching force in the course of a stimulus were reflected by a decrease in plethysmogram amplitude as well as by increased pain ratings, although the subjects were usually unaware of these steps. Lowering the stimulus strength induced opposite, albeit much smaller effects in both pain ratings and vascular reactions. It is concluded that the vasomotor responses described in this paper are mediated by nociceptor input and reflect the processing of this input mainly at a spinal level. 
Striking CT scan findings in a case of unilateral moyamoya disease--a case report. The authors report striking CT scan findings in a young woman with unilateral Moyamoya disease. Serial CT scans showed features that paralleled the clinical and pathophysiologic evolution of the disorder, in much the same way as has been reported in studies using serial angiograms. 
Acute delta hepatitis: serological diagnosis with particular reference to hepatitis delta virus RNA. To evaluate serologic diagnosis of hepatitis delta virus, we tested HDV RNA in stored sera from 48 patients with acute delta hepatitis who were identified with anti-HD antibodies. Initial sera were positive for HDV RNA in 27 of 48 (56%) patients. In comparison, isolated IgM anti-HD was present in 18 (38%) patients, although IgM and IgG anti-HD were present concurrently in 16 (33%) additional patients. Overall, either HDV RNA or IgM anti-HD was present in 69% of the initial sera. The HDV infection was self-limiting in all except two patients who died of fulminant hepatitis and nine others in whom chronic delta hepatitis ensued. Patterns of HDV seropositivity during progression to chronicity induced variable persistence, disappearance or recrudescence of either HDV RNA or IgM and IgG anti-HD. Results of HDV RNA and IgM anti-HD tests were concordant in only 40-50% of instances. Our results indicate that serological testing for HDV RNA is direct and will demonstrate HDV replication in a large number of cases with acute delta hepatitis. Testing for IgM anti-HD could provide supplemental evidence for HDV infection. Sequential testing for these markers will facilitate assessment of the outcome of acute HDV infection. 
The endoscopic repair of choanal atresia. Since 1755, when choanal atresia was first described by Roederer, more than 300 papers have appeared in the literature dealing with various aspects of choanal atresia. Today's preferred methods of repair are transnasal and transpalatal. Each method has its advantages, disadvantages, proponents, and opponents. The main disadvantage of the transnasal procedure is limited vision, even with a microscope, especially in newborn infants, and the inability to adequately remove enough vomerine septal bone to prevent restenosis. Endoscopic transnasal repair of choanal atresia provides excellent visualization and the ability to perform exact surgery on patients of all ages. Described are four patients who underwent endoscopic repair of choanal atresia. Three of the four have patent nares, one patient after revision surgery. The technique is discussed along with its advantages and disadvantages relative to other surgical treatment modalities. 
Assessment of left atrial appendage function by transesophageal echocardiography. Implications for the development of thrombus. BACKGROUND. The predilection of the left atrial appendage (LAA) for thrombus formation has long been known. METHODS AND RESULTS. We prospectively studied the two-dimensional echocardiographic and Doppler patterns of LAA function in 82 patients by transesophageal echocardiography. In the 63 patients in sinus rhythm, LAA area was measured during LAA diastole at the onset of the electrocardiographic (ECG) P wave (LAAmax) and after LAA systole at the ECG R wave (LAAmin) and LAA ejection fraction was calculated as (LAAmax-LAAmin)/LAAmax; peak Doppler velocity was recorded from the LAA outlet. The 58 patients in sinus rhythm without LAA thrombus were grouped according to left atrial size on transthoracic echocardiography; 39 patients had a left atrial size of less than 40 mm (group 1) and 19 had a left atrial size of 40 mm or greater (group 2). Five patients in sinus rhythm had LAA thrombus. In the 19 patients with atrial fibrillation or flutter LAAmax was measured independent of the ECG; three of these patients had LAA spontaneous contrast, four had thrombus, and one had both. Patients in sinus rhythm without LAA thrombus demonstrated a characteristic pattern of a contractile LAA apex and a noncontractile base with color flow and pulsed Doppler evidence of LAA emptying that coincided with the P wave. Patients in sinus rhythm with LAA thrombus had a mean +/- SD LAAmax (8.0 +/- 1.5 cm2) larger than that in group 1 (5.0 +/- 1.9 cm2) (p less than 0.01) but not group 2 (6.7 +/- 3.1 cm2), LAAmin (6.5 +/- 1.0 cm2) larger than that in both group 1 (2.3 +/- 1.5 cm2) and group 2 (4.2 +/- 2.7 cm2) (p less than 0.01), and LAA ejection fraction (17 +/- 11%) and LAA velocity (0.24 +/- 0.10 m/sec) less than those in both group 1 (55 +/- 21% and 0.48 +/- 0.24 m/sec, respectively) and group 2 (45 +/- 27% and 0.46 +/- 0.24 m/sec, respectively) (p less than 0.01). Patients with atrial fibrillation or flutter with LAA spontaneous contrast and/or thrombus had LAAmax (10.4 +/- 6.6 cm2) greater than that in patients with atrial fibrillation or flutter without LAA contrast and/or thrombus (6.8 +/- 3.0 cm2) (p less than 0.05). The LAA appeared as a static pouch in seven of eight of the former compared with in two of 11 of the latter. When attempted, Doppler demonstrated a recognizable fibrillatory LAA outflow velocity pattern in none of three in the former versus four of seven in the latter group. CONCLUSIONS. We conclude that the LAA has a characteristic pattern of emptying in sinus rhythm. LAA thrombus formation in sinus rhythm and atrial fibrillation is associated with both poor LAA contraction and LAA dilation. 
Square wave jerks in parkinsonian syndromes. The frequency of square wave jerks (SWJ) was compared in eight patients with progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP), 25 patients with multiple system atrophy or Parkinson's disease plus (MSA/PP), 85 patients with idiopathic Parkinson's disease (PD) and 20 age-matched normal volunteers. In the control group, the mean (SD) SWJ frequency (SWJ larger than 1 degree amplitude) was 2.3 (2.4)/min. Abnormal ocular fixation (SWJ frequency greater than 10/min) was observed in a large proportion of PSP patients (7/8) and of MSA/PP patients (16/25) but in few PD patients (13/85). In the group of PD patients with abnormal ocular fixation, freezing of gait, falls and instability were more severe than in the group of PD patients with normal fixation. The study of ocular fixation may help to differentiate PD clinically from other Parkinsonian syndromes. SWJ are probably not related to the central degeneration of the dopaminergic nigrostriatal pathway observed in PD. 
Consequences of ileal pouch-anal anastomosis for Crohn's colitis. Patients with Crohn's colitis are generally not considered candidates for the ileal pouch-anal anastomosis (IPAA) procedure. We reviewed 362 consecutive patients undergoing IPAA and analyzed the outcome of this procedure on 25 patients with a preoperative diagnosis of mucosal ulcerative colitis who were subsequently proven to have Crohn's disease. The mean follow-up was 38.1 months. Sixteen patients have a functioning pouch, seven have required pouch excision, one is diverted, and one has died. Only one of nine patients in whom there was a preoperative clinical feature suggestive of Crohn's disease has a functioning pouch, with complications uniformly occurring within months of ileostomy closure. In contrast, 15 of 16 patients without preoperative features of Crohn's disease have maintained their pouch, generally with good results. These data suggest that patients in whom there is clinical and pathologic evidence of Crohn's disease do very poorly without meaningful symptom-free intervals. However, patients without any clinical features of Crohn's disease, despite a histopathologic diagnosis of Crohn's colitis, have had a good outcome with IPAA thus far. 
Roles of deoxycholate and arachidonate in pathogenesis of cholesterol gallstones in obese patients during rapid loss of weight. Our aim was to examine the relationship between biliary deoxycholate and arachidonate in obese patients and the relationship of deoxycholate and arachidonate to the stimulation of biliary mucous glycoprotein among obese patients predisposed to cholesterol gallstones. Thirty-four obese patients predisposed to cholesterol gallstones by a weight-reducing diet (520 kcal/day) received placebo, ursodiol (1200 mg/day), or aspirin (1300 mg/day). Duodenal bile was collected prior to beginning the diet and at four weeks. There was no correlation between deoxycholate and arachidonate among the 34 patients before beginning the diet. With placebo, deoxycholate decreased while arachidonate and glycoprotein increased. With ursodiol, deoxycholate decreased while arachidonate decreased and glycoprotein did not change. With aspirin, there was no change in deoxycholate but a decrease in arachidonate and no change in glycoprotein. Our data do not support a role for biliary deoxycholate in the regulation of biliary arachidonate. Our data do support a role for arachidonate, but not deoxycholate, in the regulation of biliary glycoprotein during the formation of cholesterol gallstones. 
Psychiatric illness in patients with chronic fatigue and those with rheumatoid arthritis OBJECTIVES: To identify psychiatric differences between patients with chronic fatigue and those with rheumatoid arthritis and to investigate whether patients meeting Centers for Disease Control (CDC) criteria for chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS) can be differentiated from patients with chronic fatigue on measures of disability and psychosocial distress. DESIGN: Cross-sectional study comparing 98 patients with chronic fatigue with 31 patients with rheumatoid arthritis on structured psychiatric interviews and patient questionnaires. Nineteen patients meeting CDC criteria for CFS were compared with 79 patients with chronic fatigue not meeting CDC criteria on questionnaires measuring disability and psychosocial distress. SETTING: Consecutive patients with chronic fatigue were selected from a chronic fatigue clinic at the University of Washington, and 31 consecutive patients with rheumatoid arthritis were sampled from a private rheumatology practice. MAIN RESULTS: Patients with chronic fatigue had a significantly higher prevalence of lifetime major depression and somatization disorder than did patients with rheumatoid arthritis. Patients with chronic fatigue also had a significantly higher prevalence of current and lifetime psychiatric diagnoses. Only 19 of 98 patients with chronic fatigue met CDC criteria for CFS. Patients meeting CDC criteria for CFS could not be differentiated from the larger group of patients with chronic fatigue on any study variable. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with chronic fatigue have a significantly higher burden of psychiatric illness than do patients with rheumatoid arthritis. The psychiatric illness preceded the development of chronic fatigue in over half the patients. Centers for Disease Control criteria for CFS did not select a subset of chronic fatigue patients who could be differentiated on disability or psychosocial parameters from patients with chronic fatigue who did not meet CDC criteria. 
Ossifying fibromyxoid tumor of soft parts. Additional observations of a distinctive soft tissue tumor. The author studied four subcutaneous soft tissue tumors, similar to those recently described by Enzinger and associates (Am J Surg Pathol 1989;13:817) by the name "ossifying fibromyxoid tumor," by immunohistochemistry and electron microscopy to further understand the cellular nature of this lesion. The four tumors were composed of uniform round cells often surrounded by a lacunar space. The tumors often contained a peripheral zone of metaplastic bone. The cellularity was high, but the mitotic rate was low, suggesting a benign or borderline nature of the lesion. Longer follow-up was available for three cases, showing recurrence-free survival times of 11, 8, and 3 years. Immunohistochemistry studies revealed that all tumors were strongly positive for S-100 protein and focally positive for Leu-7, whereas melanoma-specific marker HMB45 was negative. Vimentin was the main type of intermediate filament protein, and one case also contained scattered glial fibrillary acidic protein-positive cells. Epithelial markers (keratins, epithelial membrane antigen), desmin, and muscle actins were negative. Electron microscopic examination showed partial, sometimes reduplicated, basal lamina surrounding many cells. Complex cell processes were also present. No myofilaments were found. The immunohistochemical and electron microscopic results may suggest that this tumor has Schwann's cell differentiation. 
Mitral valve repair in the extensively calcified mitral valve annulus. Mitral valve replacement in patients with an extensively calcified mitral annulus is associated with an increased risk of ventricular rupture. Until now techniques of mitral valve repair have not been applied to patients with a heavily calcified mitral valve annulus. We present 12 patients who underwent extensive decalcification of the annulus with subsequent mitral valve repair between 1987 and 1990. Ages ranged from 11 to 78 years; 6 patients were in New York Heart Association functional class II, 4 were in class III, and 2 were in class IV. All patients had varying degrees of mitral insufficiency. There were no deaths, reoperations, or thromboembolic events. Postoperative echocardiography revealed minimal residual mitral insufficiency in only 2 of 12 patients. All patients are currently in New York Heart Association class I or II. We believe mitral valve repair can be done safely on patients with an extensively calcified mitral annulus, thus avoiding the risks of left ventricular rupture, thromboembolic events, and hemorrhagic complications associated with mitral valve replacement. 
Intrathecal morphine for postoperative analgesia in children after selective dorsal root rhizotomy. The authors report their experience with low doses (0.007-0.015 mg/kg), moderate doses (0.016-0.025 mg/kg), and high doses (0.026-0.035 mg/kg) of intrathecal morphine for postoperative analgesia after selective dorsal root rhizotomy surgery in 50 children, aged 3 to 12 years. After closure of the dura, a single dose of preservative-free morphine was injected into the subarachnoid space, and patients were assessed for 48 hours for level of comfort and side effects. The three doses of morphine provided equivalent analgesia and similar side effects. The duration of postoperative analgesia ranged from 3 to 48 hours (mean, 12.2 +/- 9.5 h). Common side effects were limited to nausea and vomiting (42%) and mild facial pruritus. No patient experienced late respiratory depression or generalized pruritus. The authors conclude that low doses of intrathecal morphine is as effective as moderate or high doses of morphine for reducing pain in the immediate postoperative period. Intrathecal morphine provides excellent analgesia after selective dorsal rhizotomy. 
A novel technique for the evaluation of mechanical pain and hyperalgesia. We describe a new technique which is useful for the evaluation of mechanically induced pain and hyperalgesia. Light metal cylinders are guided and accelerated in a barrel. On impact against the skin they elicit a brief sensation of pain. This method allows the application of a wide range of controllable innocuous and noxious impact velocities of the cylinder at variable stimulus repetition rates. The system is sufficiently flexible to stimulate perpendicularly any skin area and to move rapidly to adjacent target regions if desired. Psychophysical testing using magnitude estimation techniques revealed that pain thresholds were normally distributed. Over a wide range of stimulation intensities monotonically increasing stimulus response functions were obtained. Repeated testing showed a good intra-individual reproducibility of both threshold and supramaximal pain ratings. The method was also useful in determining the time course of pain and mechanical hyperalgesia following a brief painful stimulus. We conclude that the new technique is useful for evaluating psychophysical stimulus response functions of mechanically induced pain and its changes following tissue injury. This technique may also hold some promise in quantifying altered pain sensitivity in patients. 
Cloning of a leucine-zipper protein recognized by the sera of patients with antibody-associated paraneoplastic cerebellar degeneration. Antibody-associated paraneoplastic cerebellar degeneration (the Yo syndrome) is an uncommon disorder in which an immune response is specifically directed against tumor tissue and the cerebellum. Screening of a lambda expression library has resulted in the isolation of cDNA clones that encode the major antigen recognized by serum from these patients. The fusion protein produced by the cDNA clones provides the basis of a simple diagnostic assay for this neurological syndrome. The occurrence of leucine-zipper and zinc-finger motifs in the predicted open reading frame suggests that this protein plays a role in the regulation of gene expression. 
Emergency management of blunt trauma in children. Apart from the trend to nonoperative treatment of blunt abdominal injuries, based on accurate CT diagnosis, most of the recent and anticipated changes in pediatric trauma are organizational. They include resuscitation and triage before hospitalization, the use of designated trauma centers, resuscitation by trauma teams, noninvasive diagnosis and monitoring, comprehensive pediatric intensive care, the use of objective measures of outcome, and improved rehabilitation programs (Templeton JM: personal communication). The treatment of individual cases is based on simple but well-established principles. The key steps in management are to recognize children with life-threatening injuries (on the basis of the mechanism of injury or a Pediatric Trauma Score less than or equal to 8 or a Revised Trauma Score less than or equal to 11), to support the function of vital organs by establishing and maintaining adequate respiratory gas exchange and circulation, and to identify all important injuries by thorough and ongoing assessment. 
Interpretation and clinical significance of the QRS axis of the electrocardiogram. The frontal plane QRS axis of the standard 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) is easily and accurately measured by the clinician. A simple method of estimating this axis is discussed. This axis is age-dependent. We reviewed the literature to determine if evidence exists of an association between an "abnormal" QRS axis and clinically significant myocardial disease. We also examined the literature for clinical correlation of a "normal" QRS axis with the absence of myocardial pathology. We found that although an abnormal QRS axis (falling outside the limits of +30 degrees and +90 degrees) occurs in a small number of normal individuals, its presence should prompt a thorough evaluation of all the parameters of the ECG to look for myocardial disease. 
Explicit memory and repetition priming in depression. Preliminary findings. Explicit memory and repetition priming, a form of implicit memory, were examined in depressed patients and controls. Explicit memory of depressed patients was severely impaired, whereas repetition priming was intact. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that the impairment of memory in depression is linked to a failure of effort-demanding cognitive processes. Repetition priming might be useful in differentiating between depression and dementia. 
Delayed presentation and treatment of popliteal artery embolism. In the course of reviewing a 10-year experience with popliteal artery embolism (PAE), two distinct patterns of clinical presentation were identified. In addition to those patients presenting with typical acute (symptom duration less than 7 days) arterial ischemia, a second group was identified who presented with more chronic symptoms. The present study was conducted to contrast the clinical factors and treatment of these two temporal patterns of presentation with PAE. Sixty PAEs in 58 patients were documented by the combination of angiography and/or exploration of the popliteal artery. Acute presentation (AP) was seen in 41 (68%) of these and delayed presentation (DP) was noted in 19 (32%) patients. Delayed presentation patients typically presented with a history of sudden onset of claudication or rest pain and a median symptom duration of 30 days. Eighty per cent of AP patients presented with immediately threatened limbs. Angiography was generally diagnostic of chronic popliteal embolism. In the acute group, 90% were treated with embolectomy alone, while 20% of the DP group required bypass grafting. However in two thirds of the DP group, embolectomy alone performed through a direct popliteal approach was possible. Current results with overall limb salvage (92%) and mortality (7%) represents a substantial improvement compared to the authors' previous experience with PAE. The current study suggests that as many as one third of patients with popliteal artery embolism may present in delayed fashion with chronic symptoms. Furthermore most of these patients can be treated with direct popliteal embolectomy alone with favorable results. 
A phase IA trial of sequential administration recombinant DNA-produced interferons: combination recombinant interferon gamma and recombinant interferon alfa in patients with metastatic renal cell carcinoma. This study investigated the effects of sequentially administered recombinant interferon gamma (rIFN gamma) and recombinant interferon alfa (rIFN alpha) in 36 patients with metastatic renal cell carcinoma (RCC). rIFN alpha was subcutaneously administered daily for 70 days at dosages that varied (2.5, 5, 10, and 20 x 10(6) U/m2) across four cohorts of patients. Within each cohort of patients receiving a given dose of rIFN alpha, three subsets of patients received either 30, 300, or 1,000 micrograms/m2 rIFN gamma. rIFN gamma was administered intravenously for 5 days every third week, 6 hours prior to administration of rIFN alpha. Dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) included constitutional symptoms, leukopenia, nephrotic syndrome with acute renal failure, hypotension associated with death, and congestive heart failure. DLT was related more often to the rIFN alpha dose level than to rIFN gamma dose level. Maximum-tolerated dose (MTD) was 10 x 10(6) U/m2 rIFN alpha and 1,000 micrograms/m2 rIFN gamma. Six patients failed to complete a minimum of 21 days of therapy due to toxicity or rapid progression of disease. Clinical responses were seen in eight of 30 assessable patients. Two patients experienced complete remission and have remained in complete remission 20+ and 22+ months. An additional six patients have shown partial responses for 4 to 18+ months. One patient in partial remission continues to show slow regression of pulmonary and liver lesions off therapy with rIFNs. Clinical responses have remained durable for patients with complete remissions and patients with partial remissions. The results of this study suggest that toxicities associated with combination rIFN therapy can be reduced by administering these agents sequentially as opposed to simultaneously. 
Radiologic recommendation for breast biopsy on screening mammography reports. Radiologic reports on screening mammography findings often obligate breast biopsy. Ready recommendation for biopsy of nonpalpable lesions imaged by x ray is a conservative radiologic policy but is unsettling for patients and creates an imperative bind for surgeons. Like the decision to send the patient with right lower quadrant abdominal pain home rather than to the operating room, the diagnosis that requires clinical confidence and precision is nonappendicitis. Noncancer of the breast is a similar diagnosis that can usually be made on clinical and mammographic findings rather than passing such patients through to invasive diagnosis. A series of 84 patients was referred for needle localization of nonpalpable mammographically detected lesions called suspicious on screening examination. Of these 84 patients, new radiographic reports reinterpreting the findings without biopsy were written on the original mammogram in 15 patients. This is a cancellation rate of 21 per cent. In 69 patients needle localization was carried out with the finding of cancer in 28 per cent, compared with the national average of 15 per cent. This higher than average yield caused concern whether any unbiopsied cancers had been followed, and a review of these patients was undertaken. In the log of patients referred for needle localization, the prereading by the mammographer performing the needle localization was recorded in advance of biopsy confirmation, and specificity proved to be 94 per cent and sensitivity 96 per cent. Of the cancers that were detected, 39 per cent were proven in patients older than 50 years. 
Overnight studies in severe chronic left heart failure: arrhythmias and oxygen desaturation. Overnight studies were performed in 10 patients with severe chronic left heart failure (New York Heart Association grades III and IV) without pulmonary disease and in eight controls. Transcutaneous oxygen (Po2) and carbon dioxide tensions (Pco2) and oxygen saturation were measured and the electro-cardiogram was recorded. During sleep mean oxygen saturation fell to 92.7% (minimum 86.1%) from 95.1% when awake. During the night oxygen saturation was below 95% for 62% of the time, below 90% for 6% of the time, and below 85% for 1% of the time. In four patients there were oxygen desaturation dips (a fall of greater than 4% in oxygen saturation from a stable baseline that lasted greater than 30 s) with concurrent increases in Pco2. Two patients had bradycardia during the dips: in one there was non-sustained ventricular tachycardia during the dips and in the other there was ST depression (greater than 0.1 mV at 80 ms after the J point) during a dip. In the controls the fall in mean oxygen saturation from 95.4% when they were awake to 94.4% when they were asleep was less than the fall in patients with heart failure and there were no desaturation dips or arrhythmias. Thus patients with severe heart failure had episodes of oxygen desaturation during sleep, some of which were associated with arrhythmia. Such episodes may be related to the increased risk of sudden death in chronic heart failure. 
Potential use of monoclonal antibodies in the diagnostic distinction of gynecomastia from breast carcinoma in men. Immunohistochemical (IHC) assays using the monoclonal antibodies (MoAbs) B72.3 and B6.2, recognizing two distinct and independently expressed breast tumor-associated antigens (BTAAs), recently have been shown to significantly improve the accuracy of cytodiagnosis of breast nodules by fine-needle aspiration (FNA). To evaluate whether the same method may be useful diagnostically in distinguishing gynecomastia from breast cancer in men, a retrospective avidin-biotin immunoperoxidase assay study was performed on 50 cases of gynecomastia and 30 cases of breast carcinoma in men, using a panel of five MoAbs known to recognize different BTAAs. The results of this study demonstrated that MoAbs B1.1, HMFG2, and MBr1 displayed a strong reactivity with gynecomastia and carcinoma, but MoAbs B72.3 and B6.2 separated benign and malignant lesions in a high percentage of cases. When used in combination, the latter two reagents reacted with 96% of the carcinomas that were analyzed but labeled only 67% of gynecomastia cases. Thus, the conjoint use of these two reagents may enhance the use of FNA biopsy as a valuable tool in the presurgical diagnosis of breast nodules in men. 
Corynebacterium parvum versus bacille Calmette-Guerin adjuvant immunotherapy of stage II malignant melanoma. Two separate studies have been reported comparing Corynebacterium parvum and bacille Calmette-Guerin (BCG) as adjuvant immunotherapy for stage II melanoma patients (The Milton S. Hershey Medical Center, 48 patients; Southeastern Cancer Study Group [SECSG], 162 patients). As the criteria for patient selection and drugs used were similar, we have pooled the data to analyze the effects of these two treatments. Both studies used BCG (Tice, Chicago, IL) 3 x 10(8) live organisms per treatment by Tine technique and C parvum (Burroughs-Wellcome, Triangle Park, NC) subcutaneous at a dose of 4 mg/m2 (SECSG) or 5 micrograms/m2 (Hershey) per treatment. The only difference in these studies was the frequency of immunization, with patients in Hershey receiving 22 doses and the SECSG patients receiving 55 doses during the 2-year period of treatment. Kaplan-Meier life-table analysis for the 210 patients shows a prolonged disease-free interval for patients treated with C parvum (P = .02, two-sided Mantel procedure). In similar fashion, patients treated with C parvum had an improved survival rate (from all causes) when compared with BCG-treated patients (P = .012). An analysis of the results for the 170 patients for which the number of positive nodes was available was performed using Cox's model, with nodes as a stratification variable and with covariates of place, treatment, age, and sex. In this analysis, an observed benefit for C parvum on the disease-free interval had a P value of .37 while the benefit of C parvum on the survival times (from all causes) had a P value of .04. When the same analysis was performed using only patients aged younger than 60 years, the observed benefit of C parvum on disease-free interval had a P value of .08 and the benefit of C parvum on survival times (from all causes) had a P value of .008. 
Immunohistochemistry of Terrien's and Mooren's corneal degeneration. Lamellar keratoplasty specimens from a patient with Terrien's marginal degeneration and a patient with Mooren's ulcer were compared using routine histopathologic and immunohistochemical staining with an avidin-biotin-peroxidase complex. Less than 25% of the resident cells in the Terrien's marginal degeneration specimen expressed major histocompatibility class II antigens compared with 75% to 100% of the resident cells in the Mooren's ulcer specimen. The ratio of CD4 cells (T-helper/inducer) to CD8 cells (T-suppressor/cytotoxic cells) in the Terrien's marginal degeneration specimen was almost 1:1 compared with 24:1 in the Mooren's ulcer specimen. In addition, less than 5% of the infiltrating cells from the Terrien's marginal degeneration specimen stained positive for CD22 (B cells), compared with 25% to 50% from the Mooren's ulcer specimen. These data may help explain why Terrien's marginal degeneration runs a more benign course than does Mooren's ulcer and provides a rationale for the use of immunosuppressive drugs to treat Mooren's ulcer. 
Developmental disorders of the pediatric spine. Developmental disorders of the pediatric spine are a group of congenital malformations commonly referred to as spinal dysraphism. These malformations are characterized by incomplete or absent fusion of midline mesenchymal, bony, and neural structures. They can be classified according to the presence or absence of an associated back mass. A detailed analysis of the embryology, clinical findings, and radiologic characteristics of the common forms of spinal dysraphism is outlined. 
Subcutaneous lidocaine for treatment of neuropathic cancer pain. Three patients with terminal malignancy reporting ineffective analgesia using systemic and subsequently spinal opiates were treated with subcutaneous infusion of 10% lidocaine hydrochloride. During the infusion, reasonably stable blood concentrations were achieved and maintained using a subcutaneous infusion at varying dose rates over days to months with improvement of the pain complaints which continued to be refractory to conventional analgesics. Blood lidocaine levels obtained at regular intervals revealed effective concentrations between 2 and 5 micrograms/ml for each patient. 
Mycosis fungoides in childhood: an unusual presentation. Mycosis fungoides, a cutaneous T cell lymphoma, is rare in childhood and adolescence. We report a case of mycosis fungoides in a 9-year-old boy initially at a site of benign reactive lymphoid hyperplasia. 
Late results of two hundred seventeen femoropopliteal bypasses to isolated popliteal artery segments. A 10-year-experience of 217 femoropopliteal bypasses to isolated popliteal artery segments in 207 patients is reported. Thirty-three femoropopliteal bypasses (15%) were performed with reversed saphenous vein and 184 (85%) with polytetrafluoroethylene grafts. Operative indications were gangrene in 121 (56%), nonhealing ulceration in 40 (18%), ischemic rest pain in 51 (24%), and claudication in 5 (2%) cases. The 5-year primary graft patency rate of these bypasses was 59% (reversed saphenous vein, 74%; polytetrafluoroethylene, 55%; p less than 0.05), the secondary 5-year graft patency rate was 61% (reversed saphenous vein, 79%; polytetrafluoroethylene, 56%; p less than 0.05), and the 5-year limb salvage rate was 78% (reversed saphenous vein, 78%; polytetrafluoroethylene, 78%). The 30-day operative mortality rate was 10%, and the 5-year patient survival rate was 38%. Eleven patients (5%) required lower extremity amputation because of progressive gangrene or extensive infection despite a patent bypass to an isolated popliteal artery segment. We conclude that femoropopliteal bypasses to isolated popliteal artery segments (1) have acceptable 5-year graft patency and limb salvage rates; (2) should be performed with reversed saphenous vein grafts when possible; (3) may be performed with polytetrafluoroethylene grafts if necessary, with a resulting limb salvage rate equal to that of reversed saphenous vein grafts; and (4) require sequential extension to an infrapopliteal artery in up to 20% of patients. In addition, the presence of an isolated popliteal artery segment is associated with a high operative mortality rate and limited life expectancy because of coronary artery disease. 
Insights gained from the management of problematical anal fistulae at St. Mark's Hospital, 1984-88. Twenty-four (3.6 percent) patients with problematical anal fistulae out of 671 with anal fistulae were analysed to assess the reasons for their recurrences and ultimate outcome. Thirteen patients (group A) had recurrent fistulae despite two definitive attempts at surgery at this hospital (median number of previous procedures before referral to this hospital was two, range 0-7; median number of definitive procedures at this hospital was three, range 3-4). In five of these patients, the reason for recurrence was missed primary (four cases) or secondary tracks (one case) at earlier operations. Five patients required multiple operations related to the use of setons. Eleven other patients (group B) required colostomy construction, eight because of severe perianal sepsis, two because of complex fistulae, and one for postrectal dermoid. Fistula healing occurred ultimately in all patients in group A after a median of 14 months (range 4-38 months). In group B, fistula healing occurred in eight patients after a median of 7.5 months (range 2-55 months) after colostomy construction. Only one patient has had a proctectomy, and five still have their colostomy. Of the other 18 patients, continence is normal in 14, there is mucus leakage in two, flatus incontinence in one and faecal incontinence in one. In conclusion, persistent attempts to resolve anal fistulae in difficult cases are frequently successful in the long term and result in good continence. 
In situ DNA hybridization analysis of oral papillomas, leukoplakias, and carcinomas for human papillomavirus. Twenty-one papillomas, 23 ordinary benign keratoses, 13 smokeless tobacco keratoses, 10 verrucous hyperplasias, 10 verrucous carcinomas, 17 squamous cell carcinomas, 3 epithelial dysplasias, and 6 lichen planus lesions were evaluated for human papillomavirus (HPV) types 6/11, 16/18, and 31/33/35, with biotinylated double-stranded DNA probes by in situ hybridization. Sixty-two percent (13/21) of oral squamous papillomas were positive for HPV DNA. HPV DNA types 6 and 11 demonstrated the strongest reactivity. Of the 13 cases, 10 also showed some reactivity with HPV-16/18 and -31/33/35. None of the cases of keratoses, epithelial dysplasia, squamous cell carcinoma, verrucous hyperplasia, verrucous carcinoma, or lichen planus were positive for HPV DNA. This study confirms the consistent and frequent finding of HPV DNA in oral squamous cell papillomas and the inconsistency of being able to identify HPV DNA in keratotic, premalignant, or cancerous lesions of the oral mucous membranes. 
Anti-IL-6 monoclonal antibodies protect against lethal Escherichia coli infection and lethal tumor necrosis factor-alpha challenge in mice. Potentially fatal physiologic and metabolic derangements can occur in response to bacterial infection in animals and man. Recently it has been shown that alterations in the levels of circulating cytokines such as IL-6 and TNF-alpha occur shortly after bacterial challenge. To understand better the role of IL-6 in inflammation, we investigated the effects of in vivo anti-mouse IL-6 antibody treatment in a mouse model of septic shock. Rat anti-mouse IL-6 neutralizing mAb was produced from splenocytes of an animal immunized with mouse rIL-6. This mAb, MP5-20F3, was a very potent and specific antagonist of mouse IL-6 in vitro bioactivity, demonstrated using the NFS60 myelomonocytic and KD83 plasmacytoma target cell lines, and also immunoprecipitated radiolabeled IL-6. Anti-IL-6 mAb pretreatment of mice subsequently challenged with lethal doses of i.p. Escherichia coli or i.v. TNF-alpha protected mice from death caused by these treatments. Pretreatment of E. coli-challenged mice with anti-IL-6 led to an increase in serum TNF bioactivity, in comparison to isotype control antibody, implicating IL-6 as a negative modulator of TNF in vivo. Anti-TNF-alpha treatment of mice challenged i.p. with live E. coli resulted in a 70% decrease in serum IL-6 levels, determined by immunoenzymetric assay, compared to control antibody, thereby supporting a role for TNF-alpha as a positive regulator of IL-6 levels. We conclude that IL-6 is a mediator in lethal E. coli infection, and suggest that antagonists of IL-6 may be beneficial therapeutically in life-threatening bacterial infection. 
Imaging of cystic and cavitary lesions of the spinal cord and canal. The value of MR and intraoperative sonography. This article discusses the utility and technique of magnetic resonance imaging and intraoperative spinal sonography in the evaluation of cystic and cavitary lesions of the spinal cord and canal. The pathophysiology and fluid dynamics of these lesions are also discussed. 
Inspiratory muscle relaxation rate after voluntary maximal isocapnic ventilation in humans. We have investigated whether the capacity of the inspiratory muscles to generate pressure and flow during a ventilatory load is related to changes in inspiratory muscle relaxation rate. Five highly motivated normal subjects performed voluntary maximal isocapnic ventilation (MIV) for 2 min. Minute ventilation and esophageal, gastric, and transdiaphragmatic pressures were measured breath by breath. We observed that ventilation, peak inspiratory and expiratory pressures, and inspiratory flow rate declined from the start of the run to reach a plateau at 60 s that was sustained for the remainder of the exercise. In a subsequent series of studies, MIV was performed for variable durations between 15 and 120 s. The normalized maximum relaxation rate of unoccluded inspiratory sniffs (sniff MRR, %pressure loss/10 ms) was determined immediately on stopping MIV. Sniff MRR slowed as the duration of MIV increased and paralleled the decline in inspiratory pressure and ventilation observed during the 2-min exercise. No further slowing in MRR occurred when ventilation became sustainable. We conclude that, during MIV, the progressive loss of ventilation and capacity to generate pressure is associated with the early onset and progression of a peripheral fatiguing process within the inspiratory muscles. 
Clindamycin treatment of chronic pharyngeal carriage of group A streptococci. We previously demonstrated that chronic pharyngeal carriage of group A beta-hemolytic streptococci (GABHS) can be terminated by intramuscular administration of benzathine penicillin plus 4 days of orally administered rifampin. Because an effective oral regimen would be desirable, we compared clindamycin with P + R for treating GABHS carriage. Healthy, symptom-free GABHS carriers were randomly assigned to receive orally administered clindamycin (20 mg/kg per day) three times a day for 10 days or intramuscularly administered benzathine penicillin with oral doses of rifampin (20 mg/kg per day) twice a day for 4 days. Compliance was documented by antibiotic activity in urine. Throat cultures for GABHS were obtained every 3 weeks for up to 9 weeks after treatment. Patients who had positive throat cultures for their original GABHS T type 3 weeks after randomization were crossed over to the other treatment. Treatment success was defined as eradication of the original GABHS T type, with all follow-up cultures negative. Clindamycin eradicated carriage in 24 (92%) of 26 patients; penicillin plus rifampin was effective in 12 (55%) of 22 patients (p less than 0.025). Including patients crossed over 3 weeks after enrollment, clindamycin was effective in 28 (85%) of 33 treatment courses compared with 12 of 22 courses of penicillin plus rifampin (p less than 0.05). We conclude that 10 days of oral clindamycin therapy was significantly more effective than benzathine penicillin plus 4 days of orally administered rifampin for treatment of symptom-free GABHS carriers. 
Linear IgA disease of adults: association with lymphoproliferative malignancy and possible role of other triggering factors. Seventy patients with linear IgA disease of adults were followed up for a mean of 8.5 years and all malignant diseases in this group were ascertained. There were three cases of lymphoproliferative malignancy, which constituted a significant excess over the 0.2 cases that would be expected by comparison with an age- and sex-matched population using National Cancer Registry statistics. In contrast, the non-lymphoid malignancy rate of 13% is almost identical to the expected 14%. A subgroup of 35 of the adult linear IgA disease patients were assessed with respect to the possible precipitating illnesses or drugs, as well as co-existing medical conditions. Almost one-third of patients described an event that was felt could possibly have triggered the linear IgA disease, the most frequent being non-steroidal anti-inflammatory or antibiotic drug therapy, trauma/burns and upper respiratory tract infections. However, it is difficult to determine how often the preceding event is coincidental, and how often, if at all, it is causal. 
Unexplained syncope evaluated by electrophysiologic studies and head-up tilt testing. OBJECTIVE: To determine the clinical characteristics of subgroups of patients with unexplained syncope having electrophysiologic studies and head-up tilt testing and to assess the efficacy of various therapies. DESIGN: Retrospective study. SETTING: Inpatient services of a tertiary referral center. PATIENTS: Eighty-six consecutively referred patients with unexplained syncope. MEASUREMENTS: All patients had electrophysiologic examinations. Patients with negative results subsequently had head-up tilt testing. MAIN RESULTS: Twenty-nine (34%) patients (group 1) had abnormal electrophysiologic results, with sustained monomorphic ventricular tachycardia induced in 72%. Thirty-four (40%) patients (group 2) had syncope provoked by head-up tilt testing. The cause of syncope remained unexplained in 23 (26%) patients (group 3). Structural heart disease was present in 76%, 6%, and 30% of groups 1, 2, and 3, respectively. In group 1, pharmacologic or nonpharmacologic therapy was recommended based on electrophysiologic evaluation. All group 2 patients had negative results on head-up tilt testing while receiving oral beta blockers (27 patients) or disopyramide (7 patients). Group 3 patients did not receive any specific therapy. During a median follow-up period of 18.5 months, syncope recurred in 9 (10%) patients. CONCLUSIONS: The combination of electrophysiologic evaluation and head-up tilt testing can identify the underlying cause of syncope in as many as 74% of patients presenting with unexplained syncope. Therapeutic strategies formulated according to the results of these diagnostic tests appear to prevent syncope effectively in most patients. 
Hepatitis C virus infection in chronic hepatitis B virus carriers. One hundred eighty-four patients with hepatitis B surface antigen-positive chronic hepatitis were evaluated for antibodies to hepatitis C virus (anti-HCV). Only 11 (8%) of 136 patients with hepatitis B virus (HBV) replication (HBV-DNA-positive in serum) while 7 (35%) of 20 positive for antibody to hepatitis B e antigen (anti-HBe) but HBV-DNA-negative were positive for anti-HCV. By contrast, anti-HCV was never found in 30 anti-HBe-positive "healthy" carriers. Anti-HCV was more frequent in hepatitis D virus (HDV)-positive than in HDV-negative cases (32% vs. 12%). During 1-11 years of follow-up, anti-HCV persisted in 90% of cases, who showed continuing alanine aminotransferase elevation. Liver histology deteriorated in 2 of 4 anti-HCV-positive, anti-HBe-positive, HBV-DNA-negative patients. These results demonstrate the existence of a subgroup of patients with anti-HBe-positive, HBV-DNA-negative, HDV-negative chronic hepatitis B, where HCV may play a leading role in causing liver disease. 
Impact of left ventricular hypertrophy on ventricular arrhythmias in the absence of coronary artery disease. Left ventricular hypertrophy has a grave prognosis. Ventricular arrhythmias may account for a large portion of this poor prognosis, but the contribution of coronary artery disease has not been excluded. The occurrence of ventricular arrhythmias was investigated by 24 h ambulatory electrocardiographic (ECG) monitoring in 49 hypertensive patients who had normal findings on coronary arteriography. The presence of left ventricular hypertrophy was assessed by both ECG and echocardiography. The frequency and complexity of ventricular arrhythmias were significantly related to the presence of left ventricular hypertrophy whether it was defined by wall thickness (interventricular septum or posterior wall greater than or equal to 1.2 cm) or by left ventricular mass indexed to height (left ventricular mass/height greater than or equal to 163 g/m in men and greater than or equal to 121 g/m in women). The relation between left ventricular mass or wall thickness to ventricular arrhythmia was graded and continuous; for every 1 mm increase in the thickness of interventricular septum or posterior wall there was an associated two- to threefold increase, respectively, in the occurrence and complexity of ventricular arrhythmias. In conclusion, left ventricular hypertrophy is associated with an increase in the frequency and complexity of ventricular arrhythmias in the absence of coronary artery disease, and the relation is graded and continuous. 
Duplex Doppler sonography of the carotid artery: false-positive results in an artery contralateral to an artery with marked stenosis. Anecdotal reports have described a false-positive "jet effect" or velocity increase in the carotid artery contralateral to an artery with significant stenosis or occlusion when using duplex Doppler sonography. In this study, the frequency, significance, and possible reasons for this finding were evaluated by a retrospective comparison of duplex sonography and angiography. Twenty-three patients with unilateral 81-100% carotid artery stenosis who underwent both duplex sonography (16 Acuson, seven Quantum) and angiography were evaluated. In 14 patients, there was an accurate or slight underestimate (less than 20%) of stenosis present in the internal carotid artery contralateral to an artery with tight stenosis/occlusion. In nine, a velocity increase in the internal carotid artery resulted in overestimation (10-80%) of the actual degree of stenosis. In one of these nine patients, real-time images were sufficient to explain the velocity increase on the basis of vessel tortuosity. In one, falsely elevated velocity resulted from inaccurate assignment of the Doppler angle of incidence in a patient in whom real-time visualization of a distal internal carotid lesion was poor. In four of the nine patients, cross filling via the circle of Willis toward the side of greater stenosis occurred. However, seven of 14 patients in whom there was duplex sonography/angiography agreement or slight duplex sonography underestimation also had cross filling. Vertebral artery patency did not correlate well with the presence of a "jet effect." These findings suggest that an increase in blood flow velocity with duplex Doppler sonography in the internal carotid artery on the side opposite an artery with a tight stenosis is a common source of error and is not readily explained by angiographic evidence of collateral flow. 
Exercise echocardiography in the detection of anthracycline cardiotoxicity. Twenty long-term survivors of childhood cancer underwent exercise echocardiography to evaluate possible late anthracycline-induced cardiac toxicity. Ten patients ages 10 to 20 years had received anthracyclines, and ten patients ages 8 to 27 years had not received anthracyclines as part of their medical regimen. Both groups had normal cardiac function at rest. Patients who had not received anthracyclines had a greater increase in M-mode shortening fraction (P less than 0.005), velocity of circumferential fiber shortening (P = 0.05), and Doppler aortic peak flow velocity (P = 0.01) than patients receiving anthracyclines. There were no significant differences in work performed, or increase in heart rate or blood pressure with exercise between the groups. These results suggest that subtle abnormalities in myocardial function exist which become apparent only after exercise in survivors of childhood cancer who have received anthracyclines and have normal resting cardiac function. 
Blood and liver-infiltrating lymphocytes in primary biliary cirrhosis: increase in activated T and natural killer cells and recruitment of primed memory T cells. We used two-color and three-color flow cytometric analysis to study phenotypical activation and functional subsets of T and natural killer cells in the blood and liver tissue of patients with primary biliary cirrhosis, other chronic liver diseases and the blood of healthy subjects. The changes in blood lymphocyte phenotype in patients with primary biliary cirrhosis and other chronic liver diseases were similar and comprised elevated relative or absolute numbers of activated human leukocyte antigen-DR + T subset (CD4+ and CD8+) cells and DR+ natural killer-like (CD16+) cells. B cell (CD19+) numbers were normal. In primary biliary cirrhosis a selective reduction in T cells of suppressor-inducer (CD45RA + CD4 + ) type was registered. The human leukocyte antigen-DR expression among CD4+ T cell subsets was investigated further in primary biliary cirrhosis and healthy controls using triple antibody flow cytometric analysis. Phenotypical cell activation was confined to helper T cells of the primed, memory (CD45RO + CD4+) type. The decrease in suppressor-inducer T cells in primary biliary cirrhosis was paralleled by a reciprocal increase in primed memory T cells. Several significant differences were observed when blood and liver-infiltrating cells from primary biliary cirrhosis patients were compared. In the liver tissue, the CD4/CD8 ratio was decreased, the relative activation of T-subset cells and NK cells was further increased, the suppressor-inducer T subset was further depressed and the primed memory T subset was increased. The cytotoxic T-cell subset (CD11b-) dominated within the CD8+ population. In liver tissue from other chronic liver disease subjects, a lower CD4/CD8 ratio was found compared with primary biliary cirrhosis. 
Low nm23 protein expression in infiltrating ductal breast carcinomas correlates with reduced patient survival. Protein levels corresponding to nm23 were determined in normal and neoplastic breast tissues by immunoperoxidase staining. Nm23 protein levels were highest in normal breast epithelium, and lower in intraductal carcinomas. Based on nm23 staining, 39 infiltrating ductal carcinomas were separated into two groups: tumors with homogeneously high nm23 protein content, and tumors with low staining in either a homogeneous or heterogeneous pattern. Patients with low nm23 staining tumors, determined by three pathologists independently, had reduced survival times (alpha = 0.034, alpha = 0.012, alpha = 0.052 by the log rank test). Nm23 expression approached significance as an independent predictor of survival in Cox's proportional hazards model. The data provide the first correlation of low nm23 protein expression and reduced breast carcinoma patient survival. 
Effect of chronic D-Ala,2 D-Leu5-enkephalin or pertussis toxin treatment on the high-affinity state of delta opioid receptor in neuroblastoma x glioma NG108-15 hybrid cells. Chronic treatment of neuroblastoma x glioma NG108-15 hybrid cells with the opioid agonist D-Ala,2 D-Leu5-enkephalin (DADLE) induces a homologous desensitization of the delta opioid receptors present in these cells. Since the Kd value of the delta opioid receptor's high-affinity state reflects the potency of the agonist, we examined the effect of receptor desensitization in NG108-15 cells on the percentage of receptor in the high-affinity state. When NG108-15 hybrid cells were treated with 10 or 100 nM DADLE for 4 hr at 24 degrees C, loss of DADLE's ability to inhibit adenylate cyclase was observed. However, when competition binding experiments were carried out with P2P3 membranes isolated from the delta opioid-desensitized hybrid cells, it was determined that 41.7 +/- 3.4% of the total binding sites remained in the high-affinity state, with no apparent alteration in the Kd value of either high- or low-affinity states. Similarly, when NG108-15 cells were treated with 100 ng/ml of pertussis toxin for 3 hr at 37 degrees C, 39.9 +/- 3.6% of the binding sites remained in the high-affinity state. This reduction in the percentage of receptor in high-affinity state was agonist specific, for chronic treatment of hybrid cells with levorphanol, a partial agonist, or the antagonist naloxone did not alter the percentage of opioid receptors in the high-affinity state. Furthermore, the delta opioid receptors remaining in the high-affinity state after chronic DADLE treatment were still sensitive to both Na+ and guanyldylimidodiphosphate, indicating that opioid ligand binding remained coupled to the G-proteins. 
Effects of prolonged inhalation of N-formyl-methionyl-leucyl-phenylalanine in rabbits. On the basis of its potent proinflammatory and spasmogenic effects, N-formyl-methionyl-leucyl-phenylalanine (FMLP), a bacterial oligopeptide, is a putative mediator of bronchoconstriction and airway inflammation during bacterial bronchial infection. However, after an FMLP dose-response curve in rabbits, tachyphylaxis to a second challenge was seen in some rabbits and airway inflammation was absent. This study was designed to reproduce the more prolonged airway exposure to FMLP that may occur during bacterial infection. Two groups of rabbits received FMLP [5 mg/ml in 66% dimethyl sulfoxide- (DMSO) saline] or DMSO diluent alone by nebulization every 15 min for 2 h. Pulmonary resistance (RL) was measured at 1 and 2 h. Recovery from bronchoconstriction was also assessed by measuring RL every 30 min for 2 h after the final FMLP administration. Sections of trachea and large bronchi were prepared and graded by quadrant from 0 to 3 for inflammation, a total score from 0 to 12 being given for each section. There was a progressive increase in RL in FMLP-treated rabbits, reaching 68 +/- 9% above baseline after 120 min, a significantly greater change than after diluent, 8 +/- 12% (P less than 0.01). RL remained elevated above baseline for 90 min after the final FMLP dose. Inflammation scores were greater after FMLP than DMSO: 9.3 +/- 0.5 vs. 4.3 +/- 0.7 (P less than 0.01) in trachea and 5.2 +/- 0.4 vs. 1.7 +/- 0.5 (P less than 0.01) in lobar bronchi. We conclude that prolonged exposure of airways to FMLP produces a sustained increase in RL and airway inflammation, the cardinal features of infective exacerbations of chronic airflow limitation. 
Comparison of transrectal ultrasound and magnetic resonance imaging in the staging of prostate cancer. A group of 32 patients with a histological diagnosis of prostate cancer underwent transrectal ultrasound (TRUS) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to stage the disease. TRUS was more sensitive in the detection of tumour and in the detection of direct extracapsular spread. MRI was more sensitive in the detection of tumour involvement of the seminal vesicles and bladder base. MRI allowed the detection of lymphadenopathy and bone metastases in the lumbosacral spine and pelvis. During MRI the short tau inversion recovery (STIR) sequence was found to be particularly useful for the detection of tumour spread. TRUS and MRI are complementary investigations and for the accurate staging of prostatic malignancy both investigations should be used. 
Preliminary vascular control for renal trauma. Preliminary control of the renal vascular pedicle prior to opening Gerota's fascia is advocated as the standard approach for decreasing the rate of nephrectomy from trauma. This method, however, has not been studied widely. Previous reports failed to grade the severity of the renal injury and involved small patient series and historic control for comparison of nephrectomy rates. We studied 297 patients with renal trauma during a ten year period. Sixty-three of 75 patients with penetrating injuries and 12 of 222 patients with blunt injuries underwent renal exploration. We obtained vascular control prior to opening Gerota's fascia in 32 patients; it was obtained in 43 patients after opening Gerota's fascia. The nephrectomy rate depended on the degree of injury rather than on the type of renal vascular control obtained. Obtaining vascular control after opening Gerota's fascia did not increase the nephrectomy rate and shortened operative time by an average of 58 minutes. We recommend vascular control after opening Gerota's fascia when there is a large hematoma crossing the midline, a rapidly expanding renal hematoma, if the patient is unstable, or if Gerota's fascia has already been opened by the injury. 
Magnesium inhibits the hypertensive but not the cardiotonic actions of low-dose epinephrine. Intravenous magnesium supplementation is often used to control cardiac arrhythmias and coronary artery vasospasm resulting from disturbances of magnesium homeostasis after coronary artery bypass surgery. Many such patients also require inotropic drug support of depressed myocardial function. However, increased serum magnesium concentrations directly depress cardiac contractility in animals and may interfere with catecholamine actions. To determine whether small intravenous doses of magnesium sulfate (MgSO4) interfere with the cardiotonic actions of epinephrine, we examined the hemodynamic effects of MgSO4 and epinephrine infusion in 17 cardiac surgical patients on their 1st postoperative day in a prospective, controlled study. In 11 patients, infusion of MgSO4 (7-mg.kg-1 bolus followed by 10 mg.kg-1.h-1 as a continuous infusion) increased serum magnesium concentrations by 44% (mean +/- standard error of the mean [SEM] of 0.8 +/- 0.1 to 1.2 +/- 0.1 mM; P less than 0.01) but had no significant effect on heart rate; mean arterial, central venous, or pulmonary arterial occlusion pressures; or cardiac output. Epinephrine infusion (30 ng.kg-1.min-1) significantly increased cardiac index (2.7 +/- 0.1 to 3.1 +/- 0.21.min-1.m-2; P less than 0.05); this effect was not altered by MgSO4 administration (n = 11). However, MgSO4 significantly blunted epinephrine's hypertensive action and prevented a significant increase in mean arterial pressure during concurrent MgSO4-epinephrine administration. Six placebo control patients were given two sequential infusions of epinephrine separated by a placebo infusion to rule out an effect of time on the hemodynamic response to epinephrine. Mean arterial pressure and cardiac index responses to epinephrine were identical before and after placebo infusion. 
Combined nasal intermittent positive-pressure ventilation and rocking bed in chronic respiratory insufficiency. Nocturnal ventilatory support of a disabled person at home. The use of intermittent positive-pressure ventilation via nasal mask with a rocking bed provided the necessary ventilatory support for a person with quadriplegia living at home. This option was required to maintain an independent life-style of choice. The combination of techniques and the linkage of devices demonstrated an effective use of simple available technology for respiratory care at home and the adaptation of the respiratory prescription to the total needs of each person: medical, social, and financial. The further use of nasal mask ventilation in selected cases is encouraged by clinical research protocol. 
Evidence for a specific role of vasopressin in sustaining pituitary-adrenocortical stress response in the rat. In the adult male Wistar rat a 2-fold 2-min restraint stress exposure, repeated 15 min apart, activated the adrenocortical secretion more than a single one would have. However, in rats with a pharmacological block of the endogenous CRF release, exogenous CRH (0.3 micrograms/kg iv), administered 15 min after a first similar dose, was unable to stimulate pituitary-adrenocortical activity above the level attained with the first peptide injection. On the contrary, in the same conditions exogenous arginine vasopressin (AVP) (0.3 micrograms/kg iv) administered 15 min after CRH, was able to further stimulate pituitary-adrenocortical activity. Using the same experimental procedure, oxytocin (0.3 micrograms/kg iv) was found to be totally inactive. The physiological import of these findings was investigated in the Brattleboro rat, genetically lacking in endogenous AVP, in which, unlike the control Long-Evans strain, the 2-fold stress exposure did not cause an increase in plasma corticosterone concentration greater than that of a single exposure. These results suggest that endogenous AVP is essential in sustaining adrenocortical activation in circumstances in which pituitary refractoriness towards CRH stimulation intervenes. 
Use of folic acid for prevention of spina bifida and other neural tube defects--1983-1991. Neural tube defects--including spina bifida, anencephaly, and encephalocele--are common, serious birth defects that are important causes of infant mortality and disability. Women in the United States who have had a pregnancy resulting in an infant or fetus with a neural tube defect have a 2%-3% risk for having another pregnancy resulting in an infant or fetus with a neural tube defect (i.e., a recurrence) The British Medical Research Council (MRC) Vitamin Study Group recently reported the results of a randomized prevention trial that indicated that daily oral supplementation with folic acid before conception and during early pregnancy substantially reduces the recurrence of neural tube defects. This report summarizes the findings of that study and provides recommendations for supplementation with folic acid to prevent the recurrence of neural tube defects. 
Low-molecular-weight heparin (enoxaparin) vs dextran 70. The prevention of postoperative deep vein thrombosis after total hip replacement. The Danish Enoxaparin Study Group. A prospective randomized study compared the thromboprophylactic efficacy and safety of a low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH), enoxaparin (40.6 mg subcutaneously once daily), with a standard regimen of dextran 70 in patients undergoing elective total hip replacement. Deep vein thrombosis was diagnosed by bilateral ascending phlebography 7 to 11 days after operation. Two hundred forty-six patients were included and 219 were eligible for analysis. Deep vein thrombosis was diagnosed in seven of 108 patients in the LMWH group and in 24 of 111 patients in the dextran group. Clinical symptoms of pulmonary embolism did not develop in any patients during the study. In the postoperative period, patients receiving LMWH had a lower blood loss in drains and required fewer blood transfusions than patients receiving dextran, although no significant differences were noted between the groups with respect to the total number of blood transfusions required. Bleeding events and adverse events did not differ between the groups. None of the patients died in hospital during the study. One patient in the LMWH group died at home 15 days after the operation. Three patients receiving dextran had development of symptomatic deep vein thrombosis after hospital discharge. In conclusion, enoxaparin was a more effective thromboprophylactic than a standard regimen of dextran in patients undergoing total hip replacement. The two regimens were equally safe under the clinical conditions. 
Recurrent kidney stones: causes and diagnostic criteria in patients from Campania (southern Italy). A study was carried out on 180 recurrent kidney stone formers from the Campania region of southern Italy. The data showed that this hypercalciuric population was similar to that in previous studies; however, there was no difference in terms of parathyroid activity when compared with normal controls. The slightly depressed serum levels of vitamin D in hypercalciurics indicate that gut calcium absorption is not directly related to vitamin D levels. We found no difference in the prevalence of metabolic abnormalities associated with stone formation between the patients in this series and those in previous studies. 
Increased tumor necrosis factor-alpha receptor number in chronic hepatitis B virus infection. Production of the antiviral cytokine, tumor necrosis factor-alpha is increased in chronic hepatitis B virus infection, and clinical studies of tumor necrosis factor-alpha have indicated a proviral effect at higher doses. To determine whether this might be related to abnormal cell surface tumor necrosis factor-alpha receptor expression, binding characteristics of cell surface tumor necrosis factor-alpha receptor on peripheral blood mononuclear cells in chronic hepatitis B virus carriers were studied using radioiodinated recombinant tumor necrosis factor-alpha. The specific binding curves generated were analyzed according to the method of Scatchard to determine cell surface receptor numbers and dissociation constants. A single class of cell surface tumor necrosis factor-alpha receptor was demonstrated on peripheral blood mononuclear cells and mononuclear subsets. The median number (range) of cell surface tumor necrosis factor-alpha receptors on peripheral blood mononuclear cells from controls (n = 11), chronic hepatitis B virus patients seropositive for hepatitis B virus DNA (n = 8) and seronegative for hepatitis B virus DNA (n = 8) were 2,329 (range = 1,538 to 3,133), 3,375 (range = 2,300 to 6,718) (p less than 0.01) and 3,113 (range = 2,229 to 5,246) (p less than 0.05) sites/cell, respectively. They all had similar dissociation constants of 8.4 x 10(-10) mol/L (range = 4.1 to 16.9), respectively. Further dissection of the peripheral blood mononuclear cells showed that this increase in cell surface receptor number was confined to the monocyte fraction (p less than 0.01). Plasma tumor necrosis factor-alpha levels in five patients with increased monocyte cell surface tumor necrosis factor-alpha receptor numbers were also elevated. 
Intratemporal facial nerve hemangiomas. Facial nerve hemangiomas are benign vascular tumors that arise within the temporal bone and have a histologic appearance similar to both cavernous hemangiomas and vascular malformations. In contrast to facial nerve schwannomas, these are extraneural tumors that cause symptoms by compression and tend to produce deficits when very small in size. We report our experience at the House Ear Clinic with 34 patients having these nonglomus intratemporal vascular tumors. Hemangiomas arising in the internal auditory canal tend to produce a progressive sensorineural hearing loss and are demonstrated with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), whereas those at the geniculate ganglion are usually first seen with facial nerve symptoms and may require high-resolution computerized tomography (CT) for detection. Facial electromyography is helpful in establishing the diagnosis. Because of their extraneural nature, early diagnosis can permit removal of the tumor with preservation of facial nerves in some patients. 
Cellular ions in hypertension, diabetes, and obesity. A nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopic study. To investigate the cellular basis linking hypertension, non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM), and obesity, we used 31P and 19F nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy to measure intracellular pH (pHi), free magnesium (Mgi), and cytosolic free calcium (Cai) in erythrocytes of obese and NIDDM subjects with and without hypertension. Compared with normotensive, nondiabetic controls (Cai, 25.2 +/- 1.4 nM; Mgi, 232 +/- 8 microM), Cai was elevated in both normotensive (36.8 +/- 2.7 nM, sig = 0.005) and hypertensive (43.4 +/- 2.9 nM, sig = 0.001) NIDDM subjects, and Mgi was concomitantly suppressed (normotensive: 206 +/- 11 microM, sig = 0.05; hypertensive: 196 +/- 8 microM, sig = 0.001). Similar but less striking changes were noted in obese subjects. Values of pHi were significantly lower (sig = 0.05) in all hypertensive groups compared with their normotensive controls. Continuous relations were observed for all subjects between Cai and diastolic blood pressure (r = 0.649, p less than 0.001) and body mass index (r = 0.565, p less than 0.001), between Mgi and diastolic blood pressure (r = -0.563, p less than 0.001) and fasting blood glucose (r = -0.580, p less than 0.001), and in diabetics, between pHi and diastolic blood pressure (r = -0.680, p less than 0.001). Thus, the constellation of elevated Cai and suppressed Mgi and pHi levels is characteristic of the hypertensive state. These abnormalities of cellular ion handling in whole or in part common to hypertension, diabetes, and obesity may contribute to the pathophysiology of these syndromes and may help to explain their frequent clinical coexistence. 
Oxygen radicals generated at reflow induce peroxidation of membrane lipids in reperfused hearts. To test whether generation of oxygen radicals during postischemic reperfusion might promote peroxidation of cardiac membrane lipids, four groups of Langendorff-perfused rabbit hearts were processed at the end of (a) control perfusion, (b) 30 min of total global ischemia at 37 degrees C without reperfusion, (c) 30 min of ischemia followed by reperfusion with standard perfusate, (d) 30 min of ischemia followed by reperfusion with the oxygen radical scavenger human recombinant superoxide dismutase (h-SOD). The left ventricle was homogenized and tissue content of malonyldialdehyde (MDA), an end product of lipid peroxidation, was measured on the whole homogenate as well as on various subcellular fractions. Reperfusion was accompanied by a significant increase in MDA content of the whole homogenate and of the fraction enriched in mitochondria and lysosomes. This phenomenon was not observed in hearts subjected to ischemia but not reperfused, and was similarly absent in those hearts which received h-SOD at reflow. Reperfused hearts also had significantly greater levels of conjugated dienes (another marker of lipid peroxidation) in the mitochondrial-lysosomal fraction. Again, this phenomenon did not occur in ischemic hearts or in reperfused hearts treated with h-SOD. Unlike the effect on tissue MDA and conjugated dienes, reperfusion did not significantly stimulate release of MDA in the cardiac effluent. Treatment with h-SOD was also associated with significant improvement in the recovery of cardiac function. In conclusion, these data directly demonstrate that postischemic reperfusion results in enhanced lipid peroxidation of cardiac membranes, which can be blocked by h-SOD, and therefore is most likely secondary to oxygen radical generation at reflow. 
Physician practices in the prevention of venous thromboembolism. OBJECTIVE: To determine the rate of use of prophylaxis for venous thromboembolism in high-risk hospital patients. DESIGN: A retrospective medical record review. SETTING: A community-wide study in 16 short-stay hospitals in central Massachusetts. PATIENTS: A total of 2017 patients with multiple risk factors for venous thromboembolism. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: On the basis of age, length of hospitalization, and the presence of at least one additional major risk factor, 17% of 151,349 discharges (25,410 patients) were identified as being at high risk for venous thromboembolism. Eight percent of these discharges were randomly selected for medical record review. Prophylaxis for venous thromboembolism was received by 32% of these high-risk patients. Prophylaxis use among the 16 study hospitals varied widely, ranging from 9% to 56%, and was higher in teaching hospitals than in nonteaching hospitals (44% compared with 19%; P less than 0.001). One or more of the following methods of prophylaxis was used: low-dose heparin (78%), intermittent calf compression (13%), warfarin (12%), and inferior vena caval filter (3%). Use of prophylaxis increased with the number of risk factors identified (P less than 0.001). CONCLUSION: Prophylaxis for venous thromboemobolism is underused, particularly in nonteaching hospitals. 
Intra-aortic balloon counterpulsation support in the high-risk cardiac patient undergoing urgent noncardiac surgery. Patients with a recent myocardial infarction, congestive heart failure, sever angina, or uncorrected multivessel coronary artery disease are at increased risk of cardiac complications after major noncardiac surgery. Although invasive hemodynamic monitoring and preoperative optimization of cardiac status may lead to some reduction in the rate of perioperative cardiac events, the mortality from such events remains high. We report our experience with the use of perioperative intra-aortic balloon counterpulsation in eight patients with unstable coronary syndromes or severe coronary artery disease who underwent urgent noncardiac surgery. There were no perioperative cardiac events while the intra-aortic balloon pump (IABP) was in place. There were two postoperative cardiac events (non-fatal myocardial infarction, congestive heart failure) in the first postoperative week after the IABP was removed. One patient required emergent femoral thrombectomy as a result of intra-aortic balloon counterpulsation and subsequently died of a gastrointestinal hemorrhage. Intra-aortic balloon counterpulsation should be considered as an adjunct to maintain hemodynamic stability for the high-risk cardiac patient about to undergo urgent or emergent noncardiac surgery. 
The short test of mental status. Correlations with standardized psychometric testing. The Short Test of Mental Status can be administered to patients in inpatient and outpatient settings in approximately 5 minutes, and it contains items that test orientation, attention, immediate recall, arithmetic, abstraction, construction, information, and delayed (approximately 3 minutes) recall. The test was administered to a group of demented community patients and their age- and sex-matched control subjects. Using an age-adjusted approach, sensitivity of the test to identifying dementia is 86.4, with a specificity of 93.5. The test was compared with standardized tests of cognitive function such as the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale, Mattis Dementia Scale, and the Auditory Verbal Learning Test, and showed a high degree of correlation. Group means and standard deviations for subtest items and total score are presented for control subjects (n = 138), demented patients (n = 130), and patients with memory impairment only (n = 20). Percentile scores for subtest items in control subjects are also provided. 
Diagnostic accuracy and clinical utility of thermography for lumbar radiculopathy. A meta-analysis. The role of thermography for diagnosing lumbar radiculopathy was evaluated by literature review and meta-analysis. From 81 relevant citations, 28 studies could be analyzed for diagnostic-accuracy data (sensitivity and specificity) and method. Diagnostic-accuracy data varied significantly between studies; therefore meaningful pooled summary statistics could not be reported. Twenty-seven studies had major methodologic flaws including biased test interpretations, faulty cohort assembly, poor clinical descriptions, and small sample size. The only study of reasonably high quality found no discriminant value for liquid-crystal thermography. The role of thermography remains unclear. Rigorous clinical research is required to establish its diagnostic accuracy and clinical utility. Thermography cannot be recommended currently for routine clinical use in evaluating low-back pain. 
Eosinophilic cystitis in children. Eosinophilic cystitis is an uncommon inflammatory disorder of the urinary bladder which causes irritative voiding symptoms and may mimic rhabdomyosarcoma radiographically. In children, eosinophilic cystitis has been previously reported to be self-limiting and requires no specific therapy. Reported herein is a case of a nine-year-old girl in whom eosinophilic cystitis recurred following antireflux surgery, raising the question of an association of eosinophilic cystitis with local trauma such as bladder surgery. Consideration should be given to pretreatment with steroids and antihistamines prior to surgery in these patients. 
Dysrhythmias and blood pressure changes associated with thrombolysis. Recent technologic advances facilitate salvage of viable myocardium before the process of myocardial infarction is complete. The aim of thrombolytic agents is to restore antegrade flow of blood in occluded coronary arteries. The process of reperfusion may be dysrhythmogenic because of the heterogeneous return of electrical activity in myocardial cells. This study examined the incidence and type of dysrhythmia occurrence and the associated changes in mean arterial blood pressure (MAP) during infusion of tissue-type plasminogen activator (TPA). A retrospective chart review of 41 subjects showed that 80% of subjects experienced dysrhythmias during TPA therapy. The most common dysrhythmia was sinus bradycardia, followed by idioventricular/accelerated idioventricular rhythm, ventricular premature beats, and ventricular tachycardia/fibrillation. There was a significant difference between MAP changes when there were no dysrhythmias and MAP changes when dysrhythmias occurred (p less than 0.05). The largest change in MAP (-22.71 mm Hg) was observed when dysrhythmias occurred in those subjects with blockage of the left anterior descending artery, although there was no statistically significant difference in changes in MAP among the groups of different sites of blockage (p greater than 0.05). 
Cytogenetic abnormalities associated with renal cell carcinoma. Cytogenetic analysis was performed on 23 renal cell carcinomas (21 sporadic and 2 associated with von Hippel-Lindau's disease). Clonal chromosomal abnormalities were found in 19 of 21 of the sporadic tumors. The most frequent abnormalities were a loss or rearrangement of material in 3p (11 of 21 cases) or an extra chromosome 7 (7 of 21 cases). Correlation between specific chromosomal abnormalities and clinical presentation was absent with the exception of trisomy 7 and -Y, which occurred only in patients more than 60 years old. An increasing number of cytogenetic abnormalities were associated with a greater likelihood of renal vein and/or capsule involvement. Both patients with von Hippel-Lindau's disease had tumors with a normal karyotype. 
Common bile duct distensibility after cholecystectomy. To assess the possibility of common bile duct distensibility after cholecystectomy, we made a retrospective study of patients who had ultrasonography and endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP). The study comprised 52 patients without extrahepatic biliary obstruction; 19 had had cholecystectomy, 18 of whom complained of biliary colic similar to that they had had originally. The other 33 patients had intact, well visualized gallbladders; 15 of these patients had pain in the right upper quadrant or epigastrium, but none had chronic pancreatitis. The average diameter of the common bile duct at its widest point by ultrasonography was 4.8 mm (range, 4.0 to 9.0 mm) in the 33 patients with intact gallbladders, and 5.7 mm (range, 4.0 to 8.0 mm) in the 19 patients who had had cholecystectomy. The diameter by ERCP was 4.4 mm (range, 2.9 to 6.3 mm) in the patients with intact gallbladders, and 11.17 mm (range, 6.9 to 14.7 mm) in the patients who had had cholecystectomy. In each patient who had had cholecystectomy the diameter as measured by ERCP was larger than it appeared by ultrasonography. The results suggest that the common bile duct is distensible, and that this distensibility may be related to the postcholecystectomy syndrome. 
Long-term efficacy of oral cisapride in symptomatic upper gut dysmotility. We conducted a 12-month trial of cisapride (10 mg three times a day) in 21 patients with gastric stasis due to clinically and manometrically diagnosed gastroparesis (N = 9; seven due to diabetes) or chronic intestinal pseudo-obstruction (N = 12). Radionuclide solid-liquid gastric emptying tests were performed at baseline and at the end of the 12-month period. Symptoms were assessed monthly by diary and every three months by the investigators; frequency and severity of symptoms were scored in a standardized manner. For the whole group of 21 patients, gastric emptying of both solids and liquids improved significantly after one year of cisapride (P less than 0.05). Among chronic intestinal pseudoobstruction patients, there was predominantly an improvement in gastric emptying of solids; in contrast, patients with gastroparesis had a greater improvement in liquid emptying. Total symptom score improved significantly in the gastroparesis group (median score: 8 at baseline vs 6 at one year, P less than 0.05) but not in the chronic intestinal pseudoobstruction patients (median score at baseline 10 vs 9 at one year). Similarly, body weight showed a trend towards improvement in the gastroparesis group. No significant side effects were noted. We conclude that during a 12-month open trial, cisapride was effective in improving gastric emptying in patients with gastric stasis and consistently improved symptoms in those with gastroparesis. 
HELLP syndrome: a case report with guidelines for diagnosis and management. A 25-yr-old patient with a twin pregnancy of 34 weeks gestation developed HELLP syndrome and required urgent delivery by Caesarean section. Before operation, a central venous catheter and urinary catheter were inserted, and fresh frozen plasma and platelets were administered to correct hypovolaemia and severe thrombocytopenia. This case demonstrates the critical condition of these patients before operation and that extensive preoperative preparation and invasive monitoring are necessary for successful management. The choice of anaesthetic is governed by the presence of liver and renal dysfunction and severe thrombocytopenia. 
Expression of natriuretic peptide in ventricular myocardium of failing human hearts and its correlation with the severity of clinical and hemodynamic impairment. Atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) was immunohistochemically investigated in (1) right ventricular endomyocardial biopsy specimens from 87 apparently healthy donor hearts taken from victims of cerebral accidents; (2) 1 normal heart not suitable for transplantation (HBsAg carrier); (3) right ventricular endomyocardial biopsy specimens from 151 patients with dilated cardiomyopathy (DC); and (4) 57 explanted hearts, 26 with DC and 31 with ischemic heart disease. No ANP immunoreactivity was found in normal ventricles. Failing hearts showed ventricular positivity in 31% of the DC biopsy series, in 61% of the left ventricles, and in 30% of the right ventricles of the explanted heart series. An endoepicardial gradient was observed, because ANP positivity was greater and more extensive in the subendocardial layers. Ultrastructural studies were performed on biopsy specimens from 10 normal hearts and 132 DC biopsy samples. No ANP-storing granules were found in biopsy samples of normal ventricles, whereas ANP granules were seen in 15 of 132 (11.4%) DC cases. In parallel immunoblotting, investigation showed the same 13 kDa band protein in 1 normal atrium as well as in 8 failing atria and ventricles. ANP immunoreactivity was positively correlated with higher New York Heart Association functional classes as well as with higher left ventricular end-diastolic pressure (p less than 0.005), end-diastolic volume (p less than 0.005) and end-diastolic volume index (p less than 0.005). In conclusion, apparently healthy ventricles do not show ANP immunoreactivity, whereas failing ventricles do. ANP expression seems to be independent of the underlying disease, but positively related to the clinical status and the degree of left ventricular impairment and dilatation. 
High-energy proton beam radiation therapy for gynecologic malignancies. Potential of proton beam as an alternative to brachytherapy. Fifteen patients with advanced gynecologic malignancies were treated with high-energy proton beam radiation therapy (RT) at the Particle Radiation Medical Science Center (PARMS), Tsukuba University, Japan, from 1983 to 1987. The potential of proton beam RT as an alternative to conventional brachytherapy was evaluated. Except for one local recurrence, 14 of 15 patients were locoregionally controlled for 15 to 57 months. Two-year local control rate and 2-year survival rate were 92.3% and 93.3%, respectively. Two cases of transient, radiation-induced proctitis (neither of which required surgical treatment) were the only complications despite a target dose that exceeded 8000 cGy in most cases. The results suggest that sharply localized, high-dose proton beam RT can produce an antitumor effect equivalent to that of conventional brachytherapy. 
Propafenone disposition and pharmacodynamics in normal and norepinephrine-induced cardiomyopathic rabbit hearts. The myocardial disposition and pharmacodynamics of propafenone were studied in 10 normal and 10 norepinephrine-induced cardiomyopathic rabbit hearts. The left ventricular propafenone concentrations measured after perfusion of propafenone (0.3 microM) for 150 min were similar in the normal group (18 +/- 8 micrograms/g) compared to the cardiomyopathy group (20 +/- 5 micrograms/g, P = NS). However, the concentration of propafenone in cardiomyopathic left ventricular papillary muscle, which was always extensively involved in the inflammatory process, was significantly lower (11 +/- 2 micrograms/g) compared to normal papillary muscle (19 +/- 4 micrograms/g, P less than .05). During propafenone perfusion a significantly greater increment in ventricular conduction time was observed in the cardiomyopathy group (17 +/- 6 msec) compared to the normal group (12 +/- 3 msec, P less than .05). The propafenone myocardial concentration-effect relationships describing changes in QRS duration were shifted to the left in the cardiomyopathy group. Furthermore, the slopes of these linear concentration-effect relationships were greater in the cardiomyopathy group (1.80 +/- 0.60 msec/micrograms/g) compared to the normal group (1.07 +/- 0.25 msec/micrograms/g, P less than .01). The ventricular effective refractory period was shorter at base line in the cardiomyopathy hearts (156 +/- 21 msec) compared to the normal group (176 +/- 23 msec, P less than .08). However, propafenone effects on changes in the ventricular effective refractory period were similar in the two groups. Thus, the myocardial accumulation of propafenone is reduced in areas of extensive necrosis observed in norepinephrine-induced cardiomyopathy. As well, cardiomyopathic tissue is more responsive to propafenone effects on ventricular conduction time. 
Roles of adenosine and theophylline on the recovery of adenine nucleotides in postischemic cultured renal tubular cells. The effect of adenosine (ADO) on the recovery of cellular adenine nucleotides (AN) was evaluated in the cultured cells deprived of oxygen and substrates (ischemia) and in nonischemic cells (control). The primary cultured cells were obtained from microdissected rabbit proximal straight tubules. Ten-day-old cultured cells were made ischemic for 6 hr, and allowed to recover for 24 hr. At the end of ischemia, cells were incubated with ADO, theophylline (T), dipyridamole (D), coformycin (C) or combined agents for 3 hr. Total AN (TAN) were determined after 3 and 24 hr of recovery. The results, after 3 hr of incubation, suggest that in both control and ischemic cells, ADO is taken up by cultured cells and is preferentially converted to nucleotides. This effect is blocked by D, which inhibits ADO uptake, uninfluenced by C, which inhibits ADO deaminase and potentiated by T, which inhibits 5'-nucleotidase. After 24 hr of recovery, the beneficial effects of ADO alone or combined D, C, or T, on TAN were not seen in control cells. In contrast, in the ischemic cells, after 24 hr of recovery, ADO + T normalized ATP, ADP and TAN to the preischemic levels. T alone significantly increased ATP after 24 hr of recovery. To demonstrate further that the beneficial effect of T is due to inhibition of 5'-nucleotidase, cells were treated with adenosine alpha, beta-methylene diphosphate in the same manner as T. Combined ADO + adenosine alpha, beta-methylene diphosphate normalized ATP, ADP and TAN after 24 hr of recovery. This finding suggests that inhibition of 5'-nucleotidase improves postischemic AN. 
Interactive effects of ST-T wave abnormalities on survival of patients with coronary artery disease. Previous studies have documented a reduced survival time in patients with an electrocardiographic (ECG) ST-T wave abnormality. This study was designed to determine the clinical, hemodynamic and angiographic correlates of this observation. Data from 9,731 patients undergoing cardiac catheterization from 1976 through 1986 were analyzed; 5,531 had severe (greater than 70%) obstruction of at least one major coronary artery, 1,706 had mild (10 to 69%) obstruction and 2,494 had no obstruction. Of the patients with severe obstruction, 2,536 were treated medically and 2,995 were treated by surgical revascularization. Patients with an ST-T abnormality had more clinical risk factors (including older age and greater prevalence of diabetes mellitus, hypertension and prior myocardial infarction) and greater left ventricular dysfunction (including higher end-diastolic pressure and ventricular volume, reduced ejection fraction and greater prevalence of contraction abnormality) than did those without this ECG pattern. Survival time was significantly (p less than 0.01) reduced in subsets of patients with an ST-T abnormality and with severe or mild coronary artery disease; in those without coronary disease, ST-T changes did not correlate with reduced survival. Stepwise regression analysis was applied to each group to determine the independent predictors of 5-year survival. In patients with severe disease or no disease, an ST-T abnormality was not chosen as an independent predictor of 5-year survival; in the group with mild disease, ST-T changes were an independent predictor of reduced survival. Thus, the independent impact of an ST-T abnormality on survival is dependent on the severity of underlying coronary artery disease. 
The effect of preoperative flurbiprofen on miosis produced by acetylcholine during cataract surgery. Sustained pupillary dilation during cataract surgery may be achieved with preoperative noncorticosteroidal anti-inflammatory agents such as flurbiprofen. However, these agents may interfere with miosis after injection of acetylcholine. Thirty patients for extracapsular cataract extraction were randomly assigned in a double-masked fashion to receive either a placebo or preoperative 0.03% flurbiprofen every 30 minutes for four doses. All patients also received three doses of 2.5% phenylephrine and 2% cyclopentolate. Pupillary diameter was measured the day before surgery, immediately before the surgical incision, immediately before and five minutes after acetylcholine injection, and the morning after surgery. The flurbiprofen group had a larger mean pupillary diameter before injection of acetylcholine (P less than .001), five minutes after acetylcholine (P less than .001), and on the first postoperative day (P less than .005). 
Prevalence of asthma in Melbourne schoolchildren: changes over 26 years. OBJECTIVES--To determine the prevalence of asthma in the past 12 months in Melbourne schoolchildren aged 7, 12, and 15 years and to compare the prevalence of a history of asthma with that of 26 years ago. DESIGN--A questionnaire on respiratory symptoms was distributed to children for completion by parents and return to the school. Subjects were selected by a stratified cluster design. SETTING--Government and non-government schools in the greater Melbourne area, Australia. SUBJECTS--10,981 children. Parents completed questionnaires for 3324 children aged 7, 2899 aged 12, and 2968 aged 15. The overall response rate was 90%. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES--History of wheeze or asthma in the past 12 months and in lifetime. RESULTS--The prevalences of wheeze in the past 12 months were 23.1%, 21.7%, and 18.6% for 7, 12, and 15 year olds respectively. A history of wheeze was more common in boys than in girls at age 7 (443/1711 v 324/1614) and 12 (418/1767 v 322/1718) but not at age 15. Overall, 78% (1548) of those reporting wheeze also reported a history of asthma and 83% (1611) had used a bronchodilator. The prevalence of a history of asthma among 7 year olds was 46% compared with 19.1% in the 1964 survey, an increase of 141%. CONCLUSIONS--The current prevalence of asthma in Melbourne schoolchildren is high and has risen substantially over the past 26 years. 
'Role of bone marrow stromal cells in the growth of human multiple myeloma. We have verified the hypothesis that multiple myeloma (MM) may be disseminated by circulating clonogenic cells that selectively home to the bone marrow (BM) to receive the signal(s) leading to proliferation, terminal differentiation, and production of the osteoclast activating factors. Long-term cultures of stromal cells have been developed from the BM of nine patients with MM. These cells were mostly fibroblast-like elements, interspersed with a proportion of scattered macrophages and rare osteoclasts. BM stromal cells were CD54+, produced high levels of interleukin-6 (IL-6) and measurable amounts of IL-1 beta, and were used as feeder layers for autologous peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC). After 3 weeks of cocultures, monoclonal B lymphocytes and plasma cells, derived from PBMC, developed and the number of osteoclasts significantly increased. Both populations grew tightly adherent to the stromal cell layer and their expansion was matched by a sharp increase of IL-6 and by the appearance of IL-3 in the culture supernatant. These data attribute to BM stromal cells a critical role in supporting the growth of B lymphocytes, plasma cells, and osteoclasts and the in vivo dissemination of MM. 
Irreducible inguinal hernia in children below two years of age Eighty-five cases of irreducible inguinal hernia in children below 2 years of age were reviewed. Non-operative treatment was successful in 71 (84 per cent); 14 children required emergency surgery. The younger the child and the longer the duration of symptoms at presentation, the worse was the outcome of non-operative treatment. In 35 (41 per cent) children the diagnosis of inguinal hernia had been made before irreducibility. There is an increased incidence of postoperative complication associated with irreducibility, especially in preterm infants. Early diagnosis of inguinal hernia in young children and prompt referral for surgery is recommended. 
Rickettsial meningitis and encephalitis. Nine of 72 patients with scrub typhus and three of 137 with murine typhus presented with meningitis and/or encephalitis syndromes. Focal neurologic signs were rare, and cerebrospinal fluid profiles were similar to those of leptospirosis and viral and tuberculous meningitis. One patient had papilledema, and another had cerebellitis. Other major organ involvement (renal, liver, or lungs) occurred in five patients. One patient died and four spontaneously recovered, while the conditions of the rest responded well to either chloramphenicol or doxycycline. Scrub and murine typhus should be included in the differential diagnoses of aseptic meningitis and encephalitis in patients exposed to endemic areas, especially when accompanied by renal insufficiency and/or jaundice. They are treatable forms of virallike meningoencephalitis. 
Beneficial effect of carotid endarterectomy in symptomatic patients with high-grade carotid stenosis. North American Symptomatic Carotid Endarterectomy Trial Collaborators BACKGROUND. Without strong evidence of benefit, the use of carotid endarterectomy for prophylaxis against stroke rose dramatically until the mid-1980s, then declined. Our investigation sought to determine whether carotid endarterectomy reduces the risk of stroke among patients with a recent adverse cerebrovascular event and ipsilateral carotid stenosis. METHODS. We conducted a randomized trial at 50 clinical centers throughout the United States and Canada, in patients in two predetermined strata based on the severity of carotid stenosis--30 to 69 percent and 70 to 99 percent. We report here the results in the 659 patients in the latter stratum, who had had a hemispheric or retinal transient ischemic attack or a nondisabling stroke within the 120 days before entry and had stenosis of 70 to 99 percent in the symptomatic carotid artery. All patients received optimal medical care, including antiplatelet therapy. Those assigned to surgical treatment underwent carotid endarterectomy performed by neurosurgeons or vascular surgeons. All patients were examined by neurologists 1, 3, 6, 9, and 12 months after entry and then every 4 months. End points were assessed by blinded, independent case review. No patient was lost to follow-up. RESULTS. Life-table estimates of the cumulative risk of any ipsilateral stroke at two years were 26 percent in the 331 medical patients and 9 percent in the 328 surgical patients--an absolute risk reduction (+/- SE) 17 +/- 3.5 percent (P less than 0.001). For a major or fatal ipsilateral stroke, the corresponding estimates were 13.1 percent and 2.5 percent--an absolute risk reduction of 10.6 +/- 2.6 percent (P less than 0.001). Carotid endarterectomy was still found to be beneficial when all strokes and deaths were included in the analysis (P less than 0.001). CONCLUSIONS. Carotid endarterectomy is highly beneficial to patients with recent hemispheric and retinal transient ischemic attacks or nondisabling strokes and ipsilateral high-grade stenosis (70 to 99 percent) of the internal carotid artery. 
Isolated atrial infarction in a patients with single vessel disease of the sinus node artery. Atrial infarction is found in approximately 17 percent of autopsy-proven cases of myocardial infarction, but is a frequently missed clinical diagnosis. The antemortem diagnosis of atrial infarction occurring in the absence of ventricular infarction has not been previously reported. We present a patient with ischemic chest discomfort associated with paroxysmal atrial fibrillation. Electrocardiographic and enzymatic changes were consistent with atrial infarction. Cardiac catheterization demonstrated single vessel critical stenosis at the origin of the sinus node artery. Combined atrial and ventricular infarction occurs frequently and should be considered in the setting of paroxysmal supraventricular arrhythmias occurring early in the course of ventricular myocardial infarction. Lone atrial infarction is a rare but distinct clinical entity. The tetrad of typical ischemic chest discomfort, paroxysmal supraventricular arrhythmia, P-Ta segment shifts, and elevated cardiac enzyme levels without evidence for ventricular infarction strongly suggests isolated atrial infarction. 
Alcohol consumption and risk of coronary heart disease. OBJECTIVE--To investigate the hypothesis that the apparent protective effect of habitual alcohol consumption on coronary heart disease is due to drinkers at high risk of coronary heart disease becoming non-drinkers. DESIGN--Case-control population based study. Data were obtained from interviews with patients with non-fatal myocardial infarction and their controls and with the next of kin of those who had died of coronary heart disease and their controls. SETTING--Auckland, New Zealand. SUBJECTS--Two groups of cases were studied. The first comprised 227 men and 72 women with non-fatal myocardial infarction identified from a population based surveillance programme for coronary heart disease; controls were 525 men and 341 women randomly selected from the same population group and matched for age and sex. The second group comprised 128 men and 30 women who had died of coronary heart disease and had been identified from the surveillance programme; controls were a sample of the previous control group and comprised 330 men and 214 women matched for age and sex. All participants were aged 25-64 years and without diagnosed coronary heart disease. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES--Regular alcohol consumption; high density lipoprotein cholesterol and low density lipoprotein concentrations. RESULTS--Men with myocardial infarction and men who had died of coronary heart disease were more likely to have been never drinkers (had never drunk more than once a month) than controls (18% v 12% and 23% v 13% respectively). After possible confounding factors had been controlled for, people in all categories of drinking (up to more than 56 drinks per week) had at least a 40% reduction in risk of fatal and non-fatal coronary heart disease compared with never drinkers. Former drinkers also had a lower risk of non-fatal myocardial infarction than never drinkers (relative risks 0.41 and 0.10 in men and women respectively) but a similar risk of death from coronary heart disease. The reduction in risk was consistently greater in women than in men in all drinking categories but there was no clear dose-response effect in either sex. CONCLUSIONS--The results support the hypothesis that light and moderate alcohol consumption reduces the risk of coronary heart disease. This protective effect in this population was not due to the misclassification of former drinkers with a high risk of coronary heart disease as non-drinkers. 
Corticobasal degeneration. A unique pattern of regional cortical oxygen hypometabolism and striatal fluorodopa uptake demonstrated by positron emission tomography. Corticobasal degeneration presents with an asymmetric akinetic-rigid syndrome, apraxia and combinations of supranuclear gaze palsy, myoclonus, and an alien limb. Six patients aged 59-77 yrs, diagnosed on clinical criteria as having corticobasal degeneration, have been studied with positron emission tomography using tracers of dopamine storage capacity and oxygen metabolism. Striatal 18F-6-fluorodopa uptake was reduced in an asymmetric pattern, caudate and putamen being involved in all cases. Uptake into medial frontal cortex was also impaired. Regional cortical oxygen metabolism was most significantly depressed in the superior and posterior temporal, inferior parietal, and occipital associated cortices. Within the frontal lobe, the hypometabolism was chiefly posterior. This unique combination of regional hypometabolism and disruption of the nigrostriatal system is discussed in relation to the clinical features of the disease and is compared with reported findings in other disorders of cognition and movement. 
Trends in use of coronary angiography in subacute phase of myocardial infarction. BACKGROUND. Most patients do not undergo acute reperfusion after myocardial infarction, and which of these patients should undergo coronary angiography is still debated. METHODS AND RESULTS. We analyzed the 1-year clinical outcomes and rates of coronary angiography performed as late as 60 days after myocardial infarction in 3,804 patients admitted between 1979 and 1988 and followed in six different centers. Patients less than 75 years old were classified into low-, medium-, and high-risk groups using a multivariate analysis of historical and clinical variables gathered during the first 8 hospital days. Patients who underwent early reperfusion (17%, all after 1984) were analyzed separately. To analyze time trends, patients were compared before and after mid-1984. Mortalities from day 9 through 1 year were similar for the two time periods in the low- (3.3% versus 2.5%) and medium-risk (7.4% versus 5.6%) groups, but mortality was lower for the high-risk group after 1984 (31.6% versus 20.0%). The proportion of patients undergoing coronary angiography increased dramatically in each group after 1984 (low risk, 18% versus 48%; medium risk, 23% versus 49%; high risk, 10% versus 32%, before and after 1984, respectively). Furthermore, a large percentage of patients (more than 40%) in the low-risk group did not have at least one of the indications for coronary angiography recently recommended by a joint task force. Among patients undergoing coronary angiography, the proportion of patients with three-vessel coronary artery disease decreased after 1984, whereas the proportion undergoing mechanical revascularization in the year after infarction increased in all risk groups. CONCLUSIONS. Despite the recent development of noninvasive techniques with high sensitivity for detecting high-risk patients after myocardial infarction, coronary angiography is being performed increasingly in all patients, including those determined to be at low risk for complications based on clinical data. The economic consequences of such a trend could be considerable, and its impact requires careful analysis. 
Gastric carcinoma in patients with Crohn disease: report of four cases. An association between Crohn disease and gastric carcinoma has not been described before. However, we report four patients with documented Crohn disease in whom gastric carcinoma developed later. In three of the four patients, onset of Crohn disease occurred after the age of 40. All of the patients had nonspecific constitutional symptoms and/or complaints referable to the upper gastrointestinal tract. No clinical evidence of active Crohn disease was present. In each patient, barium examination and CT showed either a mass (two cases) or other radiologic features of malignancy (two cases). Endoscopy with biopsy was performed in three patients and findings were misleading in two patients. The possibility of an increased risk of malignancy in sites remote from inflamed bowel segments has been reported. The findings in this study suggest that patients with Crohn disease, particularly disease of late onset, may be predisposed to the development of gastric carcinoma. 
Use of recombinant human interleukin-2 in conjunction with syngeneic bone marrow transplantation in mice as a model for control of minimal residual disease in malignant hematologic disorders. Unlike allogeneic bone marrow transplantation (BMT), autologous BMT is not accompanied by immune-mediated graft-versus-leukemia (GVL) effects; hence, the relapse rate observed after autologous BMT in malignant hematologic disorders is higher than that observed after allogeneic BMT. Autologous BMT represents a much safer medical procedure available for many patients in need in situations where allogeneic BMT is not feasible or risky. The present experiments were designed to investigate whether it might be possible to combine the therapeutic benefits of autologous BMT with additional immunotherapy after BMT. The tumor model used for investigating GVL effects was the murine B-cell leukemia (BCL1), a spontaneous, nonimmunogenic, highly lethal leukemia of BALB/c origin. BALB/c mice inoculated with 10(3) BCL1 leukemia cells were treated on day-1 with cyclophosphamide 100 mg/kg and transplanted with normal syngeneic BM cells on day 0. High-dose recombinant interleukin-2 (rIL-2) (100,000 Cetus units x 3/day intraperitoneally x 5 consecutive days) was initiated on day +1, +7, or +21 after BMT. Kinetics of lymphocyte reconstitution after syngeneic BMT indicated a steep increase in the absolute number of peripheral blood lymphocytes on days 17 through 24. All experimental groups were observed for relapse. Mice receiving no rIL-2 therapy relapsed and died within 50 days after BMT, whereas mice receiving rIL-2 showed long-term disease-free survival. Optimal time for administration of rIL-2 was noted at 3 weeks post-BMT, with 90% of the mice surviving with no evidence of disease for more than 1 year. Similarly, when 10(4) BCL1 cells were given 1 day after syngeneic BMT to simulate minimal residual disease after syngeneic BMT, rIL-2 therapy administered at 14 days post-BMT seemed effective in prolonging disease-free survival in contrast to the same regimen given at 1 day after BMT. Our data suggest that immunotherapy with rIL-2 should be further investigated as a new immunotherapeutic tool for decreasing the relapse rate after BMT for hematologic malignancies. 
A rare cause of nasal obstruction: a solitary neurofibroma. This case represents a peripheral nerve sheath tumor as a cause of nasal obstruction. Nerve sheath tumors are relatively uncommon; however, most otolaryngologists will encounter them. These tumors develop from cranial and spinal nerve roots and from peripheral nerves. In total, approximately 25% to 44% of nerve sheath tumors occur in the head and neck region. Although the most important are cranial nerve tumors--the majority being acoustic neuromas arising from the vestibular nerve--they may also develop in the nasal cavity. 
Cocaine-induced myocardial infarction. A growing threat to men in their 30s. A clear association has been established between cocaine use and acute myocardial infarction. Because of the continuing rise in cocaine use in the United States, many more young patients have or will have this disorder. Such patients are usually managed conservatively with calcium channel blockade and have an excellent in-hospital prognosis. If chest pain recurs or stress testing reveals evidence of ischemia, cardiac catheterization should be done. If cocaine use is discontinued, the long-term prognosis of a typical patient with cocaine-induced acute myocardial infarction is excellent in the absence of other chronic illnesses. 
Ambulatory stab evulsion phlebectomy for truncal varicose veins. The management of primary varicose veins is evolving. Recovery time, cost, recurrence rate, and cosmesis are critical determinants. Classic "high ligation" and ankle-to-groin stripping is expensive, results in a long convalescence, and may produce unacceptable scarring and possible permanent nerve injury. This report describes the technique of stab evulsion phlebectomy performed in an outpatient setting. Under loco-regional anesthesia, and after high ligation, existing tributary and trunk varicosities are evulsed with specially designed hooks. The multiple stab incisions, 1.5- to 3-mm long, are closed with adhesive strips. Fifty-six patients, with 69 involved limbs, have been operated on during the past 9 months. Postoperative pain and complications were minimal. Convalescence was eliminated and all patients immediately resumed normal daily activities. Cosmesis was excellent. This technique is based on hemodynamically accurate principles. It effectively removes all varicosities, eliminates the proximal source of reflux, and disconnects potentially outflowing perforators, yet leaves in situ undamaged trunk veins, which may be used as potential vein grafts. 
Transcriptional regulation of c-jun gene expression by arabinofuranosylcytosine in human myeloid leukemia cells. Previous studies have demonstrated that 1-beta-D-arabinofuranosylcytosine (ara-C) induces terminal differentiation of human myeloid leukemia cells. Other studies have shown that the c-jun protooncogene is expressed during phorbol ester-induced myeloid differentiation. This work examines the effects of ara-C on c-jun gene expression in human KG-1 myeloid leukemia cells. The results demonstrate that c-jun transcripts are undetectable in uninduced KG-1 cells and that ara-C induces expression of this gene in a concentration- and time-dependent manner. Ara-C treatment was also associated with increases in c-jun transcripts in U-937, THP-1, and HL-60 myeloid leukemia cells. Furthermore, transcriptional run-on analysis has demonstrated that exposure to ara-C increases the rate of c-jun gene transcription. The results also demonstrate that while inhibition of protein synthesis superinduces c-jun mRNA levels in phorbol ester-treated KG-1 cells, cycloheximide had no effect on the induction of c-jun transcripts during ara-C treatment. Moreover, the half-life of c-jun transcripts in ara-C-treated KG-1 cells was 42 min. These findings suggest that the increase in c-jun mRNA observed during ara-C treatment is regulated by a transcriptional mechanism, and that c-jun may be involved in the induction of differentiation and regulation of gene expression by ara-C. 
Proenkephalin A in bone-derived cells. Enkephalins, a group of small peptides with opiate-like activity, have been defined originally as neuropeptides. Recent reports showed, using in situ hybridization, that the enkephalin-encoding gene, proenkephalin A (pEnkA), is expressed in nondifferentiated cells of diverse mesodermal lineages. The transient expression of pEnkA in these tissues during organogenesis suggests that this gene is involved in processes such as differentiation and/or cell proliferation. In situ hybridization revealed that bone and cartilage are among the tissues that express pEnkA most actively during organogenesis. Here we show that pEnkA mRNA is abundant in normal calvaria-derived cells and in osteosarcoma-derived cell lines ROS 17/2.8 and ROS 25/1. In addition, pEnkA-derived peptides are synthesized and secreted by these cells, as revealed by specific RIA. pEnkA expression in ROS cells is decreased by osteogenin, an osteoinductive factor, and by the calcium-regulating hormone, 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3, whereas the osteoblastic phenotype marker, alkaline phosphatase, is increased by these factors. These results together with the inhibitory effects of pEnkA-derived peptides on alkaline phosphatase activity in ROS 17/2.8 cells suggest that pEnkA is involved in bone development and provide a model system for further analysis of pEnkA expression during this process. 
Rocker-soled shoes and walking distance in patients with calf claudication. Calf claudication is the major clinical manifestation of peripheral vascular occlusive disease in a significant number of patients. Although claudication causes substantial patient disability, most patients are treated conservatively because of the risks of surgical therapy and the uncertain efficacy of drug therapy. It was hypothesized that rocker-soled shoes would decrease the work of the plantar flexors and therefore increase walking distance in patients with calf claudication. To test this hypothesis, walking distances in patients with calf claudication using rocker-soled shoes and a placebo shoe insert were compared. Rocker-soled shoes significantly increased both the total distance walked and the distance at which patients were initially bothered by symptoms by 77m (37%, p less than .0005) and 89m (91%, p = .003), respectively. It was concluded that rocker-soled shoes may reduce disability in patients with calf claudication by increasing walking distance. 
Sympathetic neural control of vascular muscle in reduced renal mass hypertension. Vascular smooth muscle (VSM) transmembrane potentials (Em) were measured in situ in small branch arteries (150-300-microns o.d.), small branch veins (300-400-microns o.d.), arterioles (90-150-microns o.d.), and venules (80-250-microns o.d.) in the mesenteric and gracilis muscle and the arterioles and venules of cremaster muscle vascular beds in anesthetized rats with reduced renal mass hypertension (HT-RRM) and normotensive sham-operated RRM control rats. All rats were given a 4% NaCl diet for 2 weeks with water ad libitum. Relative to sham, HT-RRM mesenteric and gracilis arterial and venous vessels, but not the microvessels of the cremaster muscle bed, were less polarized during superfusion with normal physiological salt solution. Also relative to sham, hyperpolarization responses to local sympathetic neural (SNS) denervation with 6-hydroxydopamine were greater in mesenteric and gracilis small arteries, arterioles, veins, and venules but not in cremaster microvessels. The immediate (less than 5-minute) electrogenic depolarization response to local blockade of VSM Na(+)-K+ pump activity with 10(-3) M ouabain was similar between each respective HT-RRM and sham vessel pair in each vascular bed. 
Effects of hypothermia and hyperthermia on the reactivity of rat intracerebral arterioles in vitro. The effects of hypothermia and hyperthermia on the cerebral microcirculation were studied using isolated perfused intracerebral (parenchymal) arterioles obtained from rats. In a temperature-dependent manner, hypothermia (20.0 degrees to 35.0 degrees C) dilated the spontaneous tone developed by the arterioles and also diminished their contractile response to potassium and prostaglandin F2 alpha. In contrast, hyperthermia (40.0 degrees to 45.0 degrees C) induced a biphasic response consisting of initial vasoconstriction and secondary vasodilation. Exposure of the vessels to 45.0 degrees C for 30 minutes irreversibly abolished the spontaneous tone and responsiveness of the arterioles when the temperature of the preparation was returned to 37.5 degrees C. In calcium-free solutions, however, the arteriolar diameter was not affected within a temperature range of 20.0 degrees to 45 degrees C. Furthermore, arterioles that had been in a calcium-free solution during exposure to 45 degrees C temperature recovered their viability at 37.5 degrees C. These results suggest that changes in ambient temperature alter calcium-induced contraction in arteriolar smooth muscle, and that the irreversible effects of hyperthermia on the arterioles are dependent upon extracellular calcium. These studies indicate that alterations in brain temperature may affect the pathogenesis of cerebral ischemia by mechanisms that are in part independent of parenchymal metabolism. 
Dynamic tracking of cardiac vulnerability by complex demodulation of the T wave. A link is found between T wave alternans and vulnerability to ventricular fibrillation, and a new approach is provided for quantification of susceptibility to malignant arrhythmias. Complex demodulation reveals that alternation of the electrocardiogram is concentrated during the first half of the T wave, coinciding with the vulnerable period of the cardiac cycle. During myocardial ischemia and reperfusion, there are marked increases in the degree of T wave alternans that parallel the established time course of changes in vulnerability. The influence of the sympathetic nervous system in arrhythmogenesis is also accurately detected. Ultimately, complex demodulation of the electrocardiogram could provide a technique for identification and management of individuals at risk for sudden cardiac death. 
Balloon dilation of postsurgical subaortic obstruction. Two children aged 10 and 5.5 years underwent balloon dilation for postsurgical subaortic obstruction. The outcome and the role of this procedure are discussed. 
Post stenotic aneurysm in popliteal artery entrapment syndrome. In a retrospective review of 74 cases of Popliteal Entrapment Syndrome collected over a 16 year period, 10 cases of aneurysm were found (13.5%). This represents an incidence of 26% of the 38 cases of popliteal aneurysm of any etiology seen during the same period of time. In contrast to atherosclerotic aneurysms, these aneurysms were seen in a young age group (21-30 years of age) and all were associated with popliteal entrapment. Evidence is presented to support our opinion that these aneurysms are post-stenotic in origin. We feel that young adults with symptoms of leg ischaemia and evidence of an aneurysm of the popliteal artery should be investigated for popliteal entrapment and treated before complications occur. We have found a posterior approach to be the most satisfactory method of exploring the popliteal fossa. 
A prospective study of liver function in infants and children exposed to daily isoflurane for several weeks. Eleven infants and children presenting for daily radiotherapy for a period of at least 2 weeks were anaesthetised with isoflurane in 33% oxygen and nitrous oxide. They were unpremedicated and given no other agents to supplement anaesthesia. The average number of exposures was 24 (SD 11; range 10-39) and the total anaesthetic time per exposure varied between 15 and 30 minutes. Liver function was assessed by determining serum total bilirubin, aspartate amino transferase, gamma glutamyl transferase and alkaline phosphatase before the start of treatment and at 5-daily intervals thereafter. There was no measurable change in any of these determinants of liver function. All children accepted daily induction of anaesthesia with isoflurane. Induction, maintenance and recovery from anaesthesia were uncomplicated. 
FK 506 ameliorates the hepatic injury associated with ischemia and reperfusion in rats. The effect of FK 506 on regeneration of the liver was studied in rats after a two-thirds partial hepatectomy after 60 min of ischemia of the unresected liver. The animals were divided into three distinct groups of 10 rats each. Group 1 (controls) received 0.5 ml saline solution intravenously 30 min after the induction of ischemia. Groups 2 and 3 were injected with FK 506 (0.3 mg/kg) intravenously 30 min after and 24 min before the induction of hepatic ischemia, respectively. The hepatic content of ATP and serum levels of ALT and lactate dehydrogenase were determined on each animal. In addition, the histological appearance and mitotic activity of the remnant liver was determined at regular 24-hr intervals after hepatic ischemia. All 10 control animals died within 72 hr. Treatment with FK 506 resulted in improved survival in groups 2 and 3 (30% and 80%, respectively). The improved survival seen in the FK 506-treated animals was reflected by a restoration of hepatic ATP content, a reduction in the serum levels of ALT and lactate dehydrogenase, an amelioration of hepatic necrosis and neutrophilic infiltration and an increase in the mitotic activity of the liver. These results suggest that FK 506 ameliorates the hepatic injury associated with ischemia/reperfusion and has a potent stimulatory effect on liver cell regeneration that may make it valuable as a hepatoprotective agent when administered to organ donors before graft harvesting. 
Synthesis of C1 inhibitor in fibroblasts from patients with type I and type II hereditary angioneurotic edema. Patients with hereditary angioneurotic edema (HANE) have serum levels of functionally active inhibitor of the first component of complement (C1 INH) between 5 and 30% of normal, instead of the 50% expected from the single normal allele. Increases in rates of catabolism have been documented in patients with HANE and certainly account for some of decrease in C1 INH level. A possible role for a decrease in synthesis of C1 INH in producing serum levels of C1 INH below the expected 50% of normal has not been well studied. We studied the synthesis of C1 INH in skin fibroblast lines, which produce easily detectable amounts of C1 INH. In type I HANE cells, C1 INH synthesis was 19.6 +/- 4.0% (mean +/- SD) of normal, much less than the 50% predicted. In type II HANE cells, the total amount of C1 INH synthesis (functional and dysfunctional) was 98.9 +/- 17% of normal; the functional protein comprised 43% of the total. Thus, type II HANE cells synthesized functional C1 INH at a much greater rate than for the type I cells. In both type I and II HANE cells, amounts of steady-state C1 INH mRNA levels paralleled rates of C1 INH synthesis, indicating that control of C1 INH synthesis occurred at pretranslational levels. Both type I and type II fibroblasts synthesized normal amounts of C1r and C1s. These data suggest that the lower than expected amounts of functionally active C1 INH in type I HANE may be due, in part, to a decrease in rate of synthesis of the protein, and that the expressions of the normal C1 INH allele in HANE is influenced by the type of abnormal allele present. 
Orbital exenteration with eyelid sparing: indications, technique, and results. Of 22 orbital exenterations performed from January 1980 to December 1989, 16 were performed by an eyelid-sparing technique, and six were allowed to heal by spontaneous granulation. Reviewing these procedures, we conclude that the eyelid-sparing method is indicated mainly for advanced primary orbital malignancies and for certain secondary orbital malignancies such as orbital extension of uveal melanoma, conjunctival melanoma, and conjunctival squamous cell carcinoma. It is not usually applicable to orbital invasion of malignant eyelid tumors such as basal cell carcinoma and sebaceous gland carcinoma. Advantages of the eyelid-sparing method are more rapid healing and earlier fitting of a prosthesis. 
Carotid cavernous fistula after minimal facial trauma. Report of a case. The carotid cavernous fistula has historically been associated with extensive facial trauma as a result of direct or indirect forces. Most fistulas of traumatic origin develop as a result of a fracture through the base of the skull, which produces a force causing laceration of the internal carotid artery in the region where it approximates the cavernous sinus. We report a case in which apparently minimal head trauma resulted in the development of a carotid cavernous fistula. The rather innocuous presentation of this complication requires particular attention by the caregiver in assessing the patient sustaining maxillofacial trauma. 
Outcome of patients with acute myocardial infarction who are ineligible for thrombolytic therapy. OBJECTIVE: To determine what proportion of patients with acute myocardial infarction are not eligible for thrombolytic therapy and to assess their natural history. DESIGN: Retrospective chart review. SETTING: A large community-based hospital. PATIENTS: All patients with acute myocardial infarction hospitalized during a 27-month period. MEASUREMENTS: Of 1471 patients with acute myocardial infarction, 230 (16%) received thrombolytic therapy according to the protocol and an additional 97 (7%) received nonprotocol thrombolytic therapy, primary coronary balloon angioplasty, or both because of contraindications. The other 1144 patients (78%) did not receive reperfusion therapy. MAIN RESULTS: The patients who did not receive thrombolytic therapy were older, more likely to be women, and more likely to have a history of hypertension, previous myocardial infarction, or chronic angina (all comparisons, P less than 0.002). An average of 1.9 reasons for exclusion were identified per patient among the ineligible patients. Mortality was fivefold higher among ineligible patients (19%; Cl, 16% to 21%) than among protocol-treated patients (4%; Cl, 1% to 6%) (P less than 0.001). In-hospital mortality rates for excluded patients were 28% (Cl, 23% to 32%) in elderly patients (age, greater than 76 years; n = 396); 29% (Cl, 23% to 35%) in patients with stroke or bleeding risk (n = 209); 17% (Cl, 14% to 20%) in patients with delayed presentation (greater than 4 hours after the onset of chest pain; [n = 599]); 14% (Cl, 11% to 16%) in patients with an ineligible electrocardiogram (ECG) (n = 673); and 26% (Cl, 21% to 32%) in patients with a miscellaneous reason for exclusion (n = 243). Independent predictors of increased mortality were: age greater than 76 years, stroke or other bleeding risk, ineligible ECG, or the presence of two or more exclusion criteria. CONCLUSIONS: Thrombolytic therapy is currently used in the United States for only a minority of patients with acute myocardial infarction: those who have low-risk prognostic characteristics. 
Patellofemoral pain caused by overactivity. A prospective study of risk factors in infantry recruits. A prospective study of 390 infantry recruits revealed that the medial tibial intercondylar distance and that the isometric strength of the quadriceps, tested at 85 degrees of flexion of the knee, had a statistically significant correlation with the incidence of patellofemoral pain caused by overactivity. Increased medial tibial intercondylar distance and increased strength of the quadriceps were therefore deemed to be risk factors for this syndrome. 
Effect of intrathoracic pressure on plasma arginine vasopressin levels. Abdominal distention during pneumoperitoneum results in a marked increase in plasma arginine vasopressin levels, which has been ascribed to an increase in intrathoracic pressure. Because of this relationship, tense ascites could contribute to nonosmotic release of antidiuretic hormone, to the development of hyponatremia, and eventually to further ascites formation. The effect of pneumoperitoneum, thoracocentesis, and paracentesis on plasma arginine vasopressin levels was studied in three groups of patients, and the mechanism by which these maneuvers may induce these changes was investigated. Patients with pleural effusion, pneumothorax, or ascites showed a significant increase in plasma arginine vasopressin levels, and thoracocentesis or paracentesis resulted in a decrease in these levels. Plasma vasopressin levels increased significantly during pneumoperitoneum, as did intrathoracic and atrial pressures; the atrial transmural pressure gradient declined. However, no changes in plasma levels of norepinephrine, aldosterone, and renin activity were observed during pneumoperitoneum. Changes in plasma arginine vasopressin levels correlated with the changes in intrathoracic and atrial pressures and transmural pressure gradient. The authors conclude that increased intrathoracic pressure is associated with an increase in plasma arginine vasopressin levels and propose that ascites could be a factor promoting vasopressin release by acting on intrathoracic volume receptors in decompensated cirrhotics. 
Toxic effects of cisplatin alone and in combination with gentamicin in stria vascularis of guinea pigs. The toxic effects on the stria vascularis of treatment with cisplatin alone and combined with the aminoglycoside antibiotic, gentamicin, were studied in guinea pigs. The toxicity induced in albino and pigmented guinea pigs was investigated morphologically with light and transmission electron microscopy, and functionally by brainstem-evoked response audiometry. The results of hearing thresholds were variable, ranging from no change in one ear in some of the animals to a hearing loss of 20 dB in one or both ears when treated with low-dose cisplatin alone or in combination with gentamicin. Bilateral deafness resulted from high-dose cisplatin combined with gentamicin. The combined treatment produced prominent structural damage in the stria vascularis. The results should be considered when aminoglycoside therapy is required in conjunction with cisplatin. 
Malignant melanoma arising in a dermoid cyst of the ovary. Autopsy findings of primary malignant melanoma arising in an ovarian dermoid cyst in an 86-year-old woman are presented. The right ovary was replaced by a dermoid cyst, 14 x 9 x 9 cm in size, in which several nodular tumors with diameters less than 3.2 cm were localized. They comprised diffusely proliferating anaplastic cells with prominent nucleoli. Some of them contained melanin pigments in the cytoplasm. The tumor cells were positive for S-100 protein and ultrastructurally showed melanosomes. In addition, several benign pigmented lesions resembling dermal nevus, pigmented schwannoma, or cellular blue nevus were present in the dermoid cyst, one of which contained a malignant melanomatous component. Histologic transition between benign and malignant components and the presence of another small focus of atypical melanocytes in the benign lesion suggested that the malignant melanoma arose in close association with the previously existing benign pigmented lesions in the dermoid cyst. 
Elective coronary artery bypass surgery without homologous blood transfusion. Early results with an inexpensive blood conservation program. Restriction of donor blood transfusions in cardiac surgery should reduce risks of infective contamination and antigenicity. We report a systemic, simple and inexpensive blood conservation program used for 121 consecutive patients who underwent elective coronary artery bypass surgery without need for homologous blood transfusion. The left internal mammary artery was grafted in all cases, in addition to saphenous vein grafts. Autologous, heparinized blood was removed intraoperatively, pre-bypass, and returned to the patient at conclusion of the extracorporeal circulation. The volume remaining in the oxygenator and the tubing set was returned without cell processing or hemofiltration. Using the hard-shell cardiotomy reservoir from the heart-lung machine, autotransfusion of the shed mediastinal blood was continued hourly up to 18 hours after surgery. The mean postoperative mediastinal bleeding was 551 +/- 206 ml, of which 505 +/- 218 ml was autotransfused. No re-exploration for bleeding was required and no homologous red-cell transfusions were given. Five patients each received 1-2 units of fresh frozen plasma because of prolonged bleeding time. Morbidity was low and mortality nil. At discharge the mean hemoglobin was 12.0 +/- 1.4 g/dl and the hematocrit 36.0 +/- 4.2%. 
Insect paralysis by baculovirus-mediated expression of a mite neurotoxin gene. Female mites of the species Pyemotes tritici inject an extremely potent venom into their insect prey that causes muscle-contraction and paralysis. These mites are able to paralyse insects 150,000 times their size and their venom is effective in a broad range of insect species. A toxin (TxP-I) associated with the mite venom apparatus causes immediate muscle-contractive paralysis when injected into insects but not mice. In this report, we describe the cloning, sequencing and expression of a complementary DNA (Tox-34) encoding TxP-I. Insect cells infected with a recombinant baculovirus (vEV-Tox34) expressing Tox-34 secrete three polypeptides related to TxP-I which cause paralysis on injection. Larvae infected with vEV-Tox34 become paralysed during infection, thus reflecting the potential application of this toxin gene in insect biocontrol methods. The toxin gene expression system will also allow further exploration of the neurophysiological basis of its insect-specific effects. 
Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada syndrome. Clinical course, therapy, and long-term visual outcome. We reviewed data from 26 patients with Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada syndrome who presented at the Bascom Palmer Eye Institute between March 1969 and February 1990. Visual outcomes were good, with final visual acuity of better than 20/30 in 29 (66%) of 44 eyes and of worse than 20/400 in only three (7%) of 44 eyes. A poor prognosis was associated with the development of choroidal neovascular membranes or chronic uveitis. All patients were treated with systemic corticosteroids. Corticosteroid therapy averaged 6 months, but was prolonged (48 months) in patients who developed chronic uveitis. Disease recurred in nine (43%) of 21 patients in the first 3 months, usually in association with a rapid tapering of steroid dosage. We recommend the early, aggressive use of systemic corticosteroids in patients with Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada syndrome and a gradual tapering of drug dosage for 6 months after presentation. 
Splenosis presenting as a left renal mass indistinguishable from renal cell carcinoma. Splenosis following splenic trauma is a common but underdiagnosed entity before surgical exploration. In all previously reported cases the ectopic splenic tissue was distinctly separate from the kidney. To our knowledge we report the first known case in which the splenic tissue was located in direct apposition with the kidney. Using conventional imaging techniques, including renal ultrasonography, abdominal computerized tomography and selective renal arteriography, this ectopic splenic tissue appeared to be part of the left kidney and was indistinguishable from renal cell carcinoma. The pathophysiology, clinical presentation and diagnostic studies of splenosis are reviewed. 
Metabolic consequences of (regional) total pancreatectomy. Little information has been reported on the metabolic characteristics of the totally pancreatectomized patient or the efficacy of medical management after radical pancreatic surgery. The prospective evaluation of 49 such patients, with 31% followed for 48 or more months, forms the basis of this report. The major immediate postoperative challenge is control of diarrhea and weight stabilization. Chronically patients have an increased daily caloric requirement (mean +/- SE, 56 +/- 1 kcal/kg), not wholly explained by moderate steatorrhea (fecal fat excretion, 16% +/- 2% of unrestricted fat intake). Despite persistent malabsorption, deficiencies in fat-soluble vitamin, magnesium, and trace element serum levels can be prevented in most patients. Pancreatogenic diabetes is characterized by (1) absence of the major glucoregulatory hormones insulin and glucagon, (2) instability, and (3) frequent hypoglycemia, with the latter parameters improving with rigorous home glucose monitoring. No patient has developed clinically overt diabetic micro- or macrovascular disease. Performance status in long-term survivors has been reasonable. However adverse chronic sequelae of the operation occur and include an unusual frequency of liver disease, characterized by accelerated fatty infiltration, and osteopenia, with an 18% reduction in radial bone mineral content noted in pancreatectomized patients studied more than 5 years after surgery. 
Correlation of nuclear morphometry and DNA ploidy in rectal cancer. Several investigators have used morphometric measurements to determine differences in the nuclear size and shape of normal and neoplastic colorectal tissue. Changes in nuclear morphometric parameters have also been shown to correlate with prognosis in a variety of noncolorectal cancers. The association of nuclear morphometry with prognostic indicators in rectal cancer has not been well studied. Measurements of the nuclear area, perimeter, longest cord, and circularity factor from 39 primary rectal adenocarcinomas were compared with DNA content, degree of tumor differentiation, Dukes' class, and patient survival. Nuclear circularity was found to correlate with DNA ploidy. Nondiploid tumors with a DNA index greater than 1.3 had significantly more circular nuclei than tumors with diploid or near-diploid DNA content. There was no correlation between nuclear morphometry and Dukes' class or patient survival. Significant increases in DNA content of rectal cancers appear to be reflected by measurable changes in nuclear shape. Nuclear morphometric measurements may provide useful information in the study of the progression of neoplastic changes in colorectal cancer. 
Chondrosarcoma of the parapharyngeal space. Chondrosarcoma is rarely found arising in the head and neck region. An unusual case arising in the parapharyngeal space in a male is reported and the differential diagnosis, pathology and treatment are discussed. 
Coronary angioplasty in single-vessel complex lesions: short- and long-term outcome and factors predicting acute coronary occlusion. Percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA) of complex coronary lesions (plaque ulceration and/or thrombus) has an increased risk of procedural complications. To assess the influence of these angiographic features on immediate and long-term results of PTCA, we prospectively compared the success rate, incidence of procedural complications, and restenosis rate in two groups of patients selected on the basis of the presence (study group = 30 patients) or absence (control group = 200 patients) of complex morphology at the time of angioplasty. The two groups were similar with regard to extent of coronary artery disease and site of coronary stenosis. Patients in the study group had a higher incidence of periprocedural acute coronary occlusion (47% vs 6%; p less than 0.01), which in 78% of the cases was successfully treated with repeat angioplasty and intracoronary thrombolysis. Univariate correlates of this complication were Canadian Cardiovascular Society class IV (57% vs 19%; p less than 0.05) and recent (less than 30 days) onset of worsening of symptoms (71% vs 31%; p less than 0.05). The incidence of acute myocardial infarction was slightly higher in the study group (6.7% vs 2%; p = NS), and the success rate with redilatation was the same (90%). Clinical and angiographic follow-up data were obtained from all patients in whom the procedure was successful; the restenosis rate was 55% in the study group compared with 36% in the control group (p less than 0.05). 
Intravascular ultrasound imaging of human coronary arteries after percutaneous transluminal angioplasty: morphologic and quantitative assessment. An intravascular ultrasound catheter system was used in patients to assess the effect of percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty. In 14 out of 16 patients, the intravascular ultrasound catheter could be successfully advanced to the site of a previous dilatation. Qualitative assessment of the cross-sectional images revealed intimal thickening and an increase of ultrasound reflectance and calcification at atherosclerotic coronary arteries. A disruption of the obstructing plaque and evidence for local dissections (11 of 14 cases) were observed after angioplasty. The quantitative comparison between angiography and the ultrasound measurement showed a close correlation for vessel sites distant to the dilatation (r = 0.91 for vessel diameter; r = 0.86 for luminal area; p less than 0.001). After angioplasty, the quantitative evaluation of the dilated area was possible in 11 cases. The correlation of angiographic and sonographic measurements of these segments was good for the assessment of the vessel diameter (r = 0.82, p less than 0.001), but poor for the determination of the luminal area (r = 0.48, p = 0.10). This difference reflected the complex morphology of the vessel lumen after angioplasty, which would be better assessed by the cross-sectional sonographic technique than by contrast angiography. The intravascular imaging of coronary arteries provides a new and unique method to obtain information on the plaque morphology and composition, and to assess the local effects of interventional procedures and their complications. 
Smoking and mortality among older men and women in three communities. BACKGROUND. Although cigarette smoking is the leading avoidable cause of premature death in middle age, some have claimed that no association is present among older persons. METHODS. We prospectively examined the relation of cigarette-smoking habits with mortality from all causes, cardiovascular causes, and cancer among 7178 persons 65 years of age or older without a history of myocardial infarction, stroke, or cancer who lived in one of three communities: East Boston, Massachusetts; Iowa and Washington counties, Iowa; and New Haven, Connecticut. At the time of the initial interview, prevalence rates of smoking in the three communities ranged from 5.2 to 17.8 percent among women and from 14.2 to 25.8 percent among men. During five years of follow-up there were 1442 deaths, 729 due to cardiovascular disease and 316 due to cancer. RESULTS. In both sexes, rates of total mortality among current smokers were twice what they were among participants who had never smoked. Relative risks, as adjusted for age and community, were 2.1 among the men (95 percent confidence interval, 1.7 to 2.7) and 1.8 among the women (95 percent confidence interval, 1.4 to 2.4). Current smokers had higher rates of cardiovascular mortality than those who had never smoked (as adjusted for age and community, the relative risk was 2.0 [95 percent confidence interval, 1.4 to 2.9] among the men and 1.6 [95 percent confidence interval, 1.1 to 2.3] among the women), as well as increased rates of cancer mortality (relative risk, 2.4 [95 percent confidence interval, 1.4 to 4.1] among the men and 2.4 [95 percent confidence interval, 1.4 to 3.9] among the women). In both sexes, former smokers had rates of cardiovascular mortality similar to those of the participants who had never smoked, regardless of age at cessation, whereas the rates for all cancers, as well as smoking-related cancers, remained elevated among men who had once smoked. CONCLUSIONS. Our prospective findings indicate that the mortality hazards of smoking extend well into later life, and suggest that cessation will continue to improve life expectancy in older people. 
Tissue polypeptide antigen activity in cerebrospinal fluid: a marker of central nervous system metastases of breast cancer. Tissue polypeptide antigen (TPpA) in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) was measured in 59 consecutive breast cancer patients with suspected central nervous system (CNS) metastases. Subsequently, we determined that 13 patients had parenchymal brain metastases, 10 had leptomeningeal carcinomatosis, and 36 had no CNS involvement. The concentration of TPpA, which is a nonspecific marker for cell proliferation, was significantly higher in patients with CNS metastases than in those without it (P less than .0001; Mann-Whitney test). A tentative cutoff value for CNS metastases was set at 95 U/L TPpA; the upper limit of values indicating absence of CNS metastases was 89 U/L. Given these cutoff points, the sensitivity of TPpA as a marker for CNS metastases was 74% and the specificity was 100%; the predictive values of positive and negative tests were 100% and 86%, respectively. In 16 patients with CNS metastases, no correlation was found between TPpA activity in corresponding CSF and blood samples (correlation coefficient, Spearman's rho = .4; P greater than .1). In three patients treated for leptomeningeal carcinomatosis, the measurements of CSF TPpA showed correlation between the presence of tumor cells in the CSF and neurological clinical function. TPpA concentrations decreased in parallel with the clinical response and increased prior to CNS disease progression. As a marker for CNS metastases, the level of TPpA in the CSF in breast cancer patients appears to be superior to the level of protein, lactate dehydrogenase, or glucose, which showed very low sensitivity (41%, 47%, and 8%, respectively). For quantitative evaluation of treatment for leptomeningeal carcinomatosis, the TPpA level appears to be valuable and superior to CSF cytology, because tumor cells are not always present in CSF samples from patients with this condition. 
Human papillomavirus type-related DNA and c-myc oncogene alterations in colon cancer cell lines. Although squamous-cell epithelium is the most frequent target site of human papillomavirus (HPV) infection, a similar infection is demonstrated in columnar epithelial cells in this paper. The papillomavirus expression in three cell lines was detected in colorectal adenocarcinoma of Chinese patients. The HPV-16 and HPV-18 DNA sequences were found in colorectal cancer cell lines, which might suggest the correlation of HPV to the etiology of colorectal cancers. In addition, c-myc oncogene was identified by amplification in all three colorectal cancer cell lines, but only normal germ-line fragments were found in control tissue. The correlation between HPV and c-myc, and the implications of these findings in colorectal cancers are also discussed. 
Parathyroiditis associated with hyperparathyroidism and branchial cysts. A 57-year-old man had renal stones, and biochemical investigation led to a diagnosis of primary hyperparathyroidism. Surgical exploration revealed bilateral inferior parathyroid enlargement. Both glands were removed; macroscopically, small cysts were seen on cut sections. Histologic examination showed broad bands of fibrosis, lymphoid follicles, and plasma cells that diffusely effaced the parathyroid architecture. Such features--if seen in the thyroid gland--would be reminiscent of an autoimmune process. The cysts were lined by respiratory and squamous epithelia and contained lymphoid follicles in their walls. Less affected areas of the parathyroid tissue were hyperplastic. It is believed that the inflammatory response in the parathyroid glands that is described in this article may be characteristic. It may result from the cysts or their contents or from an autoimmune reaction. 
Intraoperative ultrasonography: an important surgical adjunct for intramedullary tumors. The echographic characteristics of 186 suspected intramedullary spinal cord tumors were reviewed. Ultrasonography was found to be specific in distinguishing the tumor type, the extent of the lesion, and the presence and type of associated cysts. Ultrasonography greatly facilitates the selection of respective sites for the placement of a myelotomy, and for initiation of the resection. Additionally, this indispensable adjunct provides ongoing images that allow the preoperative plan to be precisely followed in a surgical field where anatomical landmarks are limited and the margin for error is minimal. 
Molecular basis of the enhanced susceptibility of the erythrocytes of paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria to hemolysis in acidified serum. When incubated in acidified serum, the erythrocytes of paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH) are hemolyzed through activation of the alternative pathway of complement (APC), but normal erythrocytes are resistant to this process. PNH cells are deficient in decay-accelerating factor (DAF), a complement regulatory protein that inhibits the activity of both the classical and the alternative pathways. However, deficiency of DAF alone does not account entirely for the aberrant effects of acidified serum on PNH cells. Recently, we have shown that PNH erythrocytes are also deficient in another complement control protein called membrane inhibitor of reactive lysis (MIRL) that restricts complement-mediated lysis by blocking formation of the membrane attack complex (MAC). To determine the effects of the DAF and MIRL on susceptibility to acidified serum lysis, PNH cells were repleted with the purified proteins. DAF partially inhibited acidified serum lysis by blocking the activity of the amplification C3 convertase. MIRL inhibited acidified serum lysis both by blocking the activity of the MAC and by inhibiting the activity the C3 convertase. When DAF function was blocked with antibody, normal erythrocytes became partially susceptible to acidified serum lysis. By blocking MIRL, cells were made completely susceptible to lysis, and control of C3 convertase activity was partially lost. When both DAF and MIRL were blocked, the capacity of normal erythrocytes to control the activity of the APC and the MAC was destroyed, and the cells hemolyzed even in unacidified serum. These studies demonstrate that DAF and MIRL act in concert to control susceptibility to acidified serum lysis; of the two proteins, MIRL is the more important. In addition to its regulatory effects on the MAC, MIRL also influences the activity of the C3 convertase of the APC. Further, in the absence of DAF and MIRL, the plasma regulators (factor H and factor I) lack the capacity to control membrane-associated activation of the APC. 
Prevention of heterotopic ossification in high-risk patients by radiation therapy. Heterotopic ossification (HO) is a frequent occurrence after cemented and cementless total hip arthroplasty (THA). Patients at risk for this complication include those with preexisting ipsilateral or contralateral HO, diffuse idiopathic skeletal hyperostosis, hypertrophic osteoarthrosis, posttraumatic arthritis, and ankylosing spondylitis. Low-dose radiation therapy effectively prevents HO in this high-risk group when treatment is begun early in the postoperative period. A prospective evaluation has established the efficacy of fractionated and single-dose radiation therapy protocols. Limited radiation portals are used in patients receiving cementless prostheses. A rectangular radiation portal obliquely oriented to the prosthesis enables radiation treatment of the periarticular soft tissues while avoiding exposure of the bone-prosthesis interface. Radiation therapy to this interface may inhibit or delay bony ingrowth. Radiation therapy is the only treatment used to prevent HO that is delivered locally and not systemically. Low-dose radiation therapy using a limited radiation portal is the treatment of choice to prevent HO in high-risk patients after cementless THA. 
Long-term inhibition of tumor growth by tumor necrosis factor in the absence of cachexia or T-cell immunity. The relationship between detrimental (cachectic) and beneficial (antitumor) effects of tumor necrosis factor (TNF) was studied in mice bearing murine tumors transfected to secrete human TNF. In vitro, the TNF-producing transfectants were resistant to the secreted TNF and grew at rates similar to those of untransfected cells or transfected cells that did not secrete TNF. However, tumors formed by the TNF-secreting cells in vivo remained much smaller than the nonsecreting (transfected and untransfected) tumors. This inhibition of tumor growth required only relatively low serum levels of TNF, persisted for many weeks, and was independent of T cells since it occurred in nude mice. Growth of the TNF-secreting tumors increased dramatically after treatment with anti-human TNF antibody, indicating that extracellular TNF secreted by the tumor cells was necessary for the tumor inhibition. Severe weight loss characteristic of cachexia only occurred in animals with very high serum TNF levels (250 pg/ml) and could be prevented or reversed by anti-TNF antibody treatment. These data are consistent with the existence of a therapeutic window in which persistent exposure to human TNF can lead to prolonged inhibition of tumor growth in the absence of T-cell immunity or severe weight loss and without development of resistant tumor variants. 
Demonstration of osteonectin mRNA in megakaryocytes: the use of the polymerase chain reaction. Platelets have been shown to release osteonectin on thrombin stimulation. The origin of platelet osteonectin was unclear as it may have been synthesized by megakaryocytes or it may have been endocytosed from plasma as other platelet alpha-granule constituents are. Platelet osteonectin has a larger apparent molecular size than the bone species, although the molecular basis for this difference has not been elucidated. These two issues have been addressed here by (1) examining the potential for osteonectin biosynthesis in human megakaryocytes by demonstrating the presence of osteonectin mRNA in purified megakaryocytes, and (2) comparing the coding portion of osteonectin transcript in megakaryocytes to the size of its bone counterpart. Because of the limitations of cell population purity and in obtaining sufficient numbers of megakaryocyte cells for Northern analysis, we have used the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) to detect the presence of human osteonectin mRNA in megakaryocyte and megakaryocyte-depleted bone marrow cells. Isolation of RNA, cDNA synthesis, and PCR were performed on human osteosarcoma SaOS-2 cells, enriched megakaryocytes, and megakaryocyte-depleted cells. Restriction enzyme analysis of PCR DNA products confirmed the identity of the products as those encoding osteonectin for all three cell populations studied. In addition, the sizes of DNA indicate that osteonectin genomic DNA, nuclear RNA, or altered transcript were not amplified, and that the transcript from megakaryocytes is the same size as that from bone cells. These data suggest that the difference in protein size between platelet and bone osteonectin is due to posttranslational modification. To overcome the possibility that megakaryocyte signal originated from contaminating cells (less than 5% by cell count), all three cell populations were diluted to less than one cell per tube and PCR amplification was performed. Limiting dilution analyses demonstrated the presence of osteonectin mRNA in single megakaryocytes as well as in single cells from the cell population depleted of megakaryocytes, suggesting the capacity for osteonectin biosynthesis in all cells studied. The procedure we describe in this report can be used to examine specific characteristics of mRNA molecules in heterogeneous cell populations and in situations where only small quantities of cells can be obtained. 
The double-balloon and Inoue techniques in percutaneous mitral valvuloplasty: comparative results in a series of 232 cases. Immediate hemodynamic results of percutaneous mitral valvuloplasty were compared in two consecutive series of unselected patients from the same institution undergoing valvuloplasty with the double-balloon (161 patients) or the Inoue balloon (71 patients) technique. Before valvuloplasty, the patient series were comparable with regard to average age, gender repartition and most clinical, electrocardiographic, X-ray and hemodynamic variables. Poor anatomic forms of mitral stenosis were equally distributed in both series (41% vs. 45%, p = NS). The magnitude of mitral valve area increase and of mean mitral gradient decrease during percutaneous mitral valvuloplasty did not differ significantly in the Inoue balloon and double-balloon series (mean +/- SEM 1.1 +/- 0.2 to 1.95 +/- 0.5 and 1.0 +/- 0.2 to 1.97 +/- 0.5 cm2, respectively, for mitral valve area and 12 +/- 3 to 5 +/- 2 and 13 +/- 4 to 5 +/- 2 mm Hg, respectively, for mean mitral gradient). Four cases of 3+ mitral regurgitation occurred in the Inoue balloon series and 7 in the double-balloon series (p = NS). A good immediate result--defined as mitral valve area greater than or equal to 1.5 cm2 with greater than or equal to 25% in mitral valve area gain and mitral regurgitation less than 2+ at the end of the procedure--was observed in 78% of patients in both series. Three cases of tamponade due to chamber perforation and 14 cases of transient air embolism in the right coronary system due to balloon rupture were observed in the double-balloon series. 
Mutational analysis of an archaebacterial promoter: essential role of a TATA box for transcription efficiency and start-site selection in vitro. By using a recently developed in vitro transcription assay, the 16S/23S rRNA-encoding DNA promoter from the archaebacterium Sulfolobus sp. B12 was dissected by deletion and linker substitution mutagenesis. The analysis of 5' and 3' deletion mutants defined a core promoter region between positions -38 and -2 containing all information for efficient and specific transcription. Further characterization of this region by linker substitution mutagenesis indicated two sequence elements important for promoter function--one located between positions -38 and -25 (distal promoter element) and the other one located between positions -11 and -2 (proximal promoter element). The distal promoter element encompassed the TATA-like "box A" element located approximately 26 nucleotides upstream of the majority of transcription start sites in archaebacteria (Archaeobacteria). All mutations within this box A motif virtually abolished promoter function. Complete inactivation of the proximal promoter element was dependent on extensive mutagenesis; this element is not conserved between archaebacterial promoters except for a high A + T content in stable RNA gene promoters from Sulfolobus. Mutants containing insertions or deletions between the distal and proximal promoter elements were only slightly affected in their transcription efficiency but displayed a shift in their major initiation site, retaining an essentially fixed distance between the distal promoter element and the transcription start site. Thus, efficient transcription and start-site selection were dependent on a conserved TATA-like sequence centered approximately 26 nucleotides upstream of the initiation site, a situation unlike that of eubacterial promoters but resembling the core structure of most eukaryotic RNA polymerase II (and some RNA polymerase III) promoters. This finding suggests a common evolutionary origin of these promoters consistent with the known similarities between archaebacterial and eukaryotic RNA polymerases. 
Decreased CD45RA T cells in B-cell chronic lymphatic leukemia patients: correlation with disease stage. T-cell subsets CD4, CD8 and suppressor-inducers (CD45RA) were determined in 20 patients with B-cell chronic lymphatic leukemia (B-CLL). The proportion of CD4 and CD45RA was decreased when compared with T cells from normal subjects. CD8 was markedly increased. The activity of concanavalin A-induced suppressor cells was not significantly different from that of normal controls and was negatively correlated to the percentage of CD4 of B-CLL patients. The selective loss of CD45RA cells was more prominent in patients in advanced Rai stages of the disease (III to IV) than in early stages (0 to II). Six patients of the advanced stages group suffered from autoimmune hemolytic anemia, whereas no patient in the early stages of disease showed an autoimmune phenomenon. Our results may indicate a mechanism of autoimmunity in B-CLL similar to that of patients with autoimmune diseases. 
Role of endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography after orthotopic liver transplantation. Twelve of 178 (7%) liver transplant patients underwent endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) after transplantation. The indications for ERCP were persistent or late onset cholestasis, recurrent cholangitis, and suspected biliary leaks or strictures. The time between transplantation and ERCP ranged from 44 to 330 days (median 153 days). Biliary complications diagnosed by ERCP included biliary sludge in the form of casts, calculi, or debris (n = 7); bile leaks (n = 2); a biliary stricture (n = 1), and complete biliary obstruction (n = 1). One patient had a normal cholangiogram after transplantation. Biliary sludge was detected by ultrasound before ERCP in only one of six patients. Eight patients underwent endoscopic papillotomy, followed by clearance of biliary sludge in four and dilatation of a biliary stricture in one. Two patients bled after papillotomy but neither required surgical intervention. At a median follow up of 1.2 years (range 0.5-2.8 years), nine patients are well and three have died. ERCP provides both accurate diagnosis of biliary complications after liver transplantation and treatment that obviates the need for additional surgery in selected patients. 
The JH/LVOH method in the quantification of aortic regurgitation: how the cardiac sonographer may avoid an important potential pitfall. Color flow Doppler allows for methods in which to quantitate the severity of valvular regurgitation. In particular, the regurgitant jet height/left ventricular outflow tract height (JH/LVOH) method of quantitating the severity of aortic regurgitation has been validated and is routinely used in the adult echocardiography laboratory. A potential pitfall exists in the measurement of the LVOH. This article points out this potential source of error and, in addition, proposes steps that may be taken by the cardiac sonographer to avoid this potential measurement pitfall. 
The double-stapled ileal reservoir and ileoanal anastomosis. A prospective review of sphincter function and clinical outcome. Fifteen consecutive patients (nine males and six females) who underwent construction of a double-stapled ileoanal reservoir (DS-IAR) were prospectively evaluated. Mean and maximal resting pressures preoperatively, before ileostomy closure, and at 12 months, were 53 and 84 mm Hg, 39 and 62 mm Hg, and 62 and 81 mm Hg. Mean and maximal squeeze pressures at those same time periods were 96 and 153 mm Hg, 111 and 173 mm Hg, and 95 and 168 mm Hg. There were no significant decreases in either resting or squeeze pressure between preoperative values and those obtained 12 months after surgery. However, the length of the high pressure zone decreased from 3.8 cm preoperatively to 2.3 cm at 12 months. This reflects the sacrifice of the cephalad 1.5 cm of the internal anal sphincter necessary to effect this anastomosis at a mean of 1.4 cm from the dentate line. However, this maneuver did not result in poor continence. Eleven patients whose ileostomies were closed for a mean of 9 months, ranging from 3 to 15 months, were evaluated regarding functional outcome. Only one patient had any incontinence and this patient had incomplete circular-stapled tissue rings, which necessitated transanal suture repair of the anastomotic defect. Similarly, three of the four patients who sometimes or rarely use a pad at night had transanal-suture reinforcement. Ten of the 11 patients never wear a pad during the day. No pelvic or perianal sepsis occurred. Stratified squamous epithelium was found in 6 of the 13 distal stapler "donuts" that were examined. In addition, 10 patients underwent biopsy of the tissue immediately caudad to the circular staple line at the time of ileostomy closure; in five, only stratified squamous epithelium was noted. The DS-IAR is associated with excellent objective physiologic and subjective functional results. 
Adverse effect of therapeutic vasoconstrictors in experimental acute pancreatitis. Alpha-adrenergic drugs commonly are used to treat hypotension resulting from severe acute pancreatitis. It was shown previously that although systemic arterial pressure is increased by phenylephrine, pancreatic microcirculatory perfusion is decreased. Because inadequate tissue perfusion may be critical in the progression of edematous pancreatitis to parenchymal necrosis, it was hypothesized that vasoconstrictors might be harmful in pancreatitis. Therefore the effect of phenylephrine on cerulein-induced mild pancreatitis were studied. Sprague-Dawley rats (n = 54) were randomly allocated to 6 experimental groups and subjected to the following infusion regimens: (1) cerulein (cae) + phenylephrine (phe), (2) cae + saline (NS), (3) NS + phe, (4) cae + phenoxybenzamine (pbz) + phe, (5) NS + pbz + phe, and (6) NS. Initial and terminal hematocrit, serum amylase activity, and blood ionized calcium concentration were determined. The animals were killed 9 hours after starting the infusion. Macroscopic and histologic changes were scored by a 'blinded' pathologist. Phenylephrine increased the severity of cerulein-induced pancreatitis as manifested by statistically significant adverse changes in serum amylase, hematocrit, ionized calcium, peripancreatitic soap formation, and acinar cell vacuolization. These changes were antagonized by alpha-adrenergic receptor blockade with phenoxybenzamine. It is concluded that phenylephrine is deleterious in acute experimental pancreatitis, the first demonstration of such an effect by a pharmacologic vasoconstrictor, and suggested that microcirculatory changes may be important in the transition of mild to severe pancreatitis. Caution in the use of vasoconstrictor drugs in patients with acute pancreatitis is recommended. 
Clinical effect of continuous gastric cooling for massive GI bleeding in uremia. Continuous gastric cooling (CGC) with dialysate was done in nine hemodiaysis patients with massive gastro-intestinal (GI) bleeding. Eight patients were treated by direct irrigation using a double-lumen naso-gastric (NG) tube without balloon. Four patients with bleeding from the duodenum (B-f-D) had complete hemostasis, and there was only one recurrence. However, two out of four patients with bleeding from the stomach (B-f-S) had complete hemostasis, but all four suffered recurrence. The NG tube had to be reinserted in three patients with B-f-S because of obstruction by clots. The direct irrigation method of CGC thus appears to be more effective for the treatment of B-f-D than B-f-S, so we investigated a three lumen, single-balloon catheter (3L-SBC) with which the bleeding site in the stomach can be cooled and pressed without removing coagula. CGC using the 3L-SBC was done in one patient with B-f-S, and complete hemostasis was obtained without recurrence. 
Preliminary results of left heart bypass in pigs using a heparin-coated centrifugal pump. To assess the feasibility of left ventricular assist without systemic heparinization, we used a commercially available (Sarns 3M) centrifugal pump with tubing set and cannulas, all internally precoated for the purpose of this study with heparin, to bypass the left ventricle in 12 pigs for periods of either 1 or 3 hours. There was no significant activation of clotting and there was no sign of generalized embolization. However, on postmortem studies, 5 kidneys out of 22 examined showed signs of minimal thromboembolism. This experiment shows that artificial left ventricular assist, free of systemic heparinization but using heparin precoating, is feasible and safe, at least for a short period of time. 
Detection of clinically suspected deep vein thrombosis using light reflection rheography. Venography is the current standard for the diagnosis of deep vein thrombosis (DVT). Noninvasive tests have differing sensitivity and specificity, are technically demanding, and may be subject to variability in interpretation. Light reflection rheography (LRR) is a noninvasive method utilizing light-emitting diodes and a sensor to measure light reflected from the skin surface. The intensity of reflected light establishes a graphic pattern that indirectly quantifies parameters of venous function by measuring changes in the microcirculation. Seventy-two patients who underwent contrast venography at our institution were also evaluated with LRR. Twenty-four patients were found to have DVT as demonstrated by venography. Of these, 23 also had DVT detected by LRR. No evidence of thrombus was seen in 45 patients studied by venography; in this group, 35 had normal venous emptying indicated by LRR. Using LRR, a sensitivity of 96% was achieved in the evaluation of clinically suspected DVT. This sensitivity is comparable with other noninvasive tests. In addition, LRR is easy to operate, portable, inexpensive, and not technically demanding. Further investigation is needed to confirm these data and further define the role of LRR in the evaluation of clinically suspected DVT. 
Effect of ischemia on protein synthesis in the septic liver. The effect of ischemia on hepatic protein synthesis during sepsis is not known, but is of clinical relevance, since hepatic blood flow decreases during the late phase of sepsis. In this study, synthesis of acute-phase proteins was measured in perfused livers of rats 16 hours after sham operation or cecal ligation and puncture. Livers from each group had 45 minutes of complete ischemia or control perfusion. Protein synthesis was measured during two hour perfusion after the ischemia or control period, by determining incorporation of 3H-leucine into total secreted trichloracetic acid precipitated proteins, immunoprecipitated complement component C3 and albumin and phosphotungstenate-precipitated alpha 1-acid glycoprotein. Lactate, glutamine-oxalacetic transaminase (GOT) and glutamic-pyruvic transaminase (GPT) levels in the perfusate were measured during preischemic and postischemic perfusion. Tissue glutathione levels were measured at the end of the perfusion. Synthesis of alpha 1-acid glycoprotein was increased by 100 per cent and albumin synthesis decreased by 46 per cent in septic livers, consistent with an acute-phase response and apparent downregulation of albumin synthesis during early sepsis. Synthesis rates were reduced by 50 to 60 per cent after ischemia in perfused livers from sham operated rats and 70 to 80 per cent in livers from septic rats. Hepatic production of interleukin-1 was not different between the groups during perfusion. GOT and GPT levels increased significantly during ischemia of both nonseptic and septic livers and rapidly returned toward baseline during reperfusion. Lactate levels were higher in perfusate of septic than of nonseptic livers before ischemia and increased further during ischemia. The results suggest that ischemia inhibits production of secreted hepatic proteins similarly in nonseptic and septic livers, but perhaps to a slightly greater extent in septic livers. 
Insulin resistance. A multifaceted syndrome responsible for NIDDM, obesity, hypertension, dyslipidemia, and atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease. Diabetes mellitus is commonly associated with systolic/diastolic hypertension, and a wealth of epidemiological data suggest that this association is independent of age and obesity. Much evidence indicates that the link between diabetes and essential hypertension is hyperinsulinemia. Thus, when hypertensive patients, whether obese or of normal body weight, are compared with age- and weight-matched normotensive control subjects, a heightened plasma insulin response to a glucose challenge is consistently found. A state of cellular resistance to insulin action subtends the observed hyperinsulinism. With the insulin/glucose-clamp technique, in combination with tracer glucose infusion and indirect calorimetry, it has been demonstrated that the insulin resistance of essential hypertension is located in peripheral tissues (muscle), is limited to nonoxidative pathways of glucose disposal (glycogen synthesis), and correlates directly with the severity of hypertension. The reasons for the association of insulin resistance and essential hypertension can be sought in at least four general types of mechanisms: Na+ retention, sympathetic nervous system overactivity, disturbed membrane ion transport, and proliferation of vascular smooth muscle cells. Physiological maneuvers, such as calorie restriction (in the overweight patient) and regular physical exercise, can improve tissue sensitivity to insulin; evidence indicates that these maneuvers can also lower blood pressure in both normotensive and hypertensive individuals. Insulin resistance and hyperinsulinemia are also associated with an atherogenic plasma lipid profile. Elevated plasma insulin concentrations enhance very-low-density lipoprotein (VLDL) synthesis, leading to hypertriglyceridemia. Progressive elimination of lipid and apolipoproteins from the VLDL particle leads to an increased formation of intermediate-density and low-density lipoproteins, both of which are atherogenic. Last, insulin, independent of its effects on blood pressure and plasma lipids, is known to be atherogenic. The hormone enhances cholesterol transport into arteriolar smooth muscle cells and increases endogenous lipid synthesis by these cells. Insulin also stimulates the proliferation of arteriolar smooth muscle cells, augments collagen synthesis in the vascular wall, increases the formation of and decreases the regression of lipid plaques, and stimulates the production of various growth factors. In summary, insulin resistance appears to be a syndrome that is associated with a clustering of metabolic disorders, including non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus, obesity, hypertension, lipid abnormalities, and atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease. 
Two-dimensional echocardiographic assessment of intracardiac masses in infants and children. We studied six infants and children with intracardiac masses of different causes. The diagnosis was made noninvasively using two-dimensional echocardiography in all six patients. In five patients, surgical excision of the mass was undertaken with good results. Two-dimensional echocardiography is an excellent noninvasive diagnostic tool that allows the clinician to determine the size and location of intracardiac masses in infants and children. 
Toxin production by Bacillus pumilus. Two strains of Bacillus pumilus (M11 and M38) and one strain each of Bacillus cereus (M27), Bacillus subtilis (M67), and Enterobacter agglomerans (M14) were identified from the air of Lancashire cotton mills. These strains were tested for cytopathic effects in Vero cells; B pumilus and B cereus strains were also examined for haemolytic activity, lecithinase production, and proteolytic action on casein. Rounding and clumping of the Vero cells occurred after the addition of supernatants prepared from B pumilus and B cereus strains; finger-like projections developed in the cells treated with B pumilus supernatants. Minimal effects occurred with B subtilis and E agglomerans. After two hours of exposure B pumilus (M11) produced the greatest effect, but treatment with trypan blue showed that most cells exposed to the M11 strain were still alive after 96 hours of exposure; those exposed to the supernatant prepared from the M38 strain of B pumilus were dead. Sheep erythrocytes were lysed more rapidly by B cereus than by B pumilus, B cereus (strongly positive) had a greater effect on lecithin than either of the B pumilus strains (M38 weakly positive, M11 negative). All hydrolised casein but the effect was more rapid with one of the B pumilus (M11) strains. It is concluded that not only do the toxins of B pumilus differ from those of B cereus, but there are also differences between the toxins produced by the two strains of B pumilus (M11 and M38). 
Cardioplegia by way of the coronary sinus for valvular and coronary surgery. Retrograde coronary sinus perfusion has recently reemerged as an attractive means of delivering cardioplegic solutions during open heart procedures. In patients undergoing aortic valve or aortic root surgery, there is no evidence that coronary sinus cardioplegia results in a better myocardial protection than that achieved with the use of standard methods of anterograde cardioplegia delivery. However, the retrograde approach provides distinct technical advantages that might favor its use as an alternative to direct coronary ostial cannulation. In select subgroups of patients undergoing coronary bypass procedures, there is a growing body of evidence that the coronary sinus route may be more effective than the anterograde route because of its superior capacity to ensure homogeneous distribution of cooling and cardioplegia in myocardial areas supplied occluded arteries. The well established safety of coronary sinus cardioplegia in the clinical setting further justifies its inclusion among techniques for ensuring adequate myocardial preservation during surgically induced ischemic arrest. 
Single photon emission computed tomography in patients with acute hydrocephalus or with cerebral ischaemia after subarachnoid haemorrhage. Using single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT), cerebral blood flow was studied in eight patients with gradual deterioration in the level of consciousness after subarachnoid haemorrhage. Four had cerebral ischaemia and four had acute hydrocephalus. In patients with cerebral ischaemia, single photon emission computed tomography scanning showed multiple regions with decreased uptake of technetium-99M labelled d,l-hexamethyl-propylene amine oxime (99mTcHM-PAO) mainly in watershed areas. In patients with acute hydrocephalus, decreased uptake was seen mainly in the basal parts of the brain: around the third ventricle, around the temporal horns of the lateral ventricles, and in the basal part of the frontal lobe. After serial lumbar puncture, there was improvement of the uptake of 99mTc HM-PAO in these basal areas in three (convincingly in two and slightly in the other) of the four patients accompanied by clinical improvement in these three patients. These results suggest that patients with acute hydrocephalus and impaired consciousness after SAH, in contrast to patients with cerebral ischaemia, have decreased cerebral blood flow predominantly in the basal parts of the brain. 
Retroperitoneal fibrosis as host response to papillary renal cell carcinoma. A case of papillary renal cell carcinoma associated with retroperitoneal fibrosis is described. This type of fibrosis has not been previously reported to be associated with renal cell carcinoma. The case is of additional interest in that it implicates an immune phenomenon in the pathogenesis of the fibrosis, involving both putative tumor antigens and antigens associated with tumor growth but unrelated to tumor cells. 
A "twilight period" of coronary perfusion: the risk of intraoperative infarction in surgery for main left coronary obstruction. This study investigates the significance of an intraoperative period of low coronary perfusion pressure which may lead to ischemia, infarction, or both, in patients undergoing coronary bypass surgery for tight left main obstruction. "Twilight Period" (TP) was defined as the time interval from initiation of cardiopulmonary bypass to implementation of cold cardioplegia. Fifty-four patients with main left coronary obstruction (greater than 50%) were divided in three groups: Group I (20), TP less than 5 minutes; Group II (15), TP = 5-15 minutes; and Group III (19), TP greater than 15 minutes. Monitoring parameters included: systemic perfusion pressure during TP, perfusion flows, length of TP, time of ischemia, myocardial temperatures during ischemia, postoperative CK-MB level, EKG-detectable infarction, and postoperative therapeutic support requirements. Results: Intraoperative myocardial infarction by EKG was 0% in Group I, 7% in Group II, and 26.3% in Group III; mortality was 0%, 0%, and 15.7%, respectively. CK-MB values were 18 +/- 3.2 IU, Group I; 18.3 +/- 2.5 IU, Group II; and 49.4 +/- 10.3 IU, Group III. Group I vs. III: P 0.01. Levels of postoperative support: Level A, less than 12 hours; Level B, 12-36 hours; and Level C, greater than 36 hours. Intra-aortic balloon pump (IABP) was considered Level C. In Group I, 75% (15/20) fell in Level A; 15% (3/20) in Level B and 10% (2/20) in Level C. In Group II, 60% (9/15) fell in Level A; 26.7% (4/15) in Level B; and 13% (2/15) in Level C. In Group III, 36.8% (7/19) fell in Level A; 15.8% (3/19) in Level B; and 47.4% (9/19) in Level C. 
Mechanisms of lymphocytotoxicity induced by extracorporeal photochemotherapy for cutaneous T cell lymphoma. Extracorporeal photochemotherapy is an effective treatment for cutaneous T cell lymphoma but its mode of action is uncertain. The reduction in viability of patients' photoirradiated buffy coat lymphocytes was correlated with a 35% increase in DNA single-strand breaks and marked decreases in cellular ATP and NAD levels (to 58 and 34% of control, respectively) immediately after photoirradiation. Complementary in vitro studies were conducted with normal human peripheral blood lymphocytes using a Therakos ultraviolet A (UVA) light box. UVA light was cytotoxic on its own but was potentiated by 8-methoxysporalen. 3-aminobenzamide, a poly (ADP-ribose) synthetase inhibitor, mitigated the cytotoxic effect of ultraviolet A light in the presence of 8-methoxypsoralen in lymphocytes and reduced the amount of nucleotide depletion they caused. 10 J/cm2 of UVA light in the presence of 300 ng/ml 8-methoxypsoralen increased the poly (ADP-ribose) synthetase activity of peripheral blood lymphocytes. Exposing lymphocytes to deoxycoformycin and deoxyadenosine was found to induce biochemical and physical effects similar to those of photochemotherapy. In summary, we have shown that the lymphocytotoxic effect of extracorporeal photochemotherapy for cutaneous T cell lymphoma is apparently mediated by DNA damage, subsequent poly (ADP-ribosyl)ation and adenine nucleotide depletion. It is not known how the DNA damage and resultant biochemical effects relate to the possible immunological mechanism of extracorporeal photochemotherapy; however, it is possible that its effects can be mimicked by other DNA-damaging agents. 
Tumor growth dependent on Kaposi's sarcoma-derived fibroblast growth factor inhibited by pentosan polysulfate. A neoangiogenic response is critical for the unrestricted growth of solid tumors beyond a few millimeters in diameter. Release of adequate growth-stimulating activity from tumor cells is obviously required for the stimulation of blood vessel growth, and blockade of such stimulatory activity should repress tumor growth at the microscopic level. To test this hypothesis and to study appropriate inhibitors, we used a human adrenal cancer cell line (SW-13/K-fgf) engineered to secrete Kaposi's sarcoma-derived fibroblast growth factor (K-FGF), which we previously showed to induce growth of highly vascularized subcutaneous tumors in animals by autocrine and paracrine stimuli. In the present study, we tested different polysulfates for their selective inhibition of proliferation induced by K-FGF versus proliferation independent of K-FGF. Suramin and dextran sulfate showed slight selective inhibition of K-FGF-induced proliferation, ie, inhibition three- and five-fold greater, respectively, than the inhibition of proliferation independent of K-FGF. In contrast, heparin was inactive. The heparin analogue pentosan polysulfate (PPS), however, showed selective inhibition that was more than 2000-fold greater. The inhibitory effects of PPS on growth of SW-13/K-fgf cells, as well as endothelial cells, were fully reversible by an excess of added FGF. Daily intraperitoneal injections of PPS were tolerated well by athymic nude mice and prevented growth of subcutaneous SW-13/K-fgf tumor xenografts. PPS will be a useful tool to elucidate the effects of FGFs in vitro and in vivo and appears to be a prototype for the development of tumoricidal therapy based on targeting of growth factors. 
CT of acute pancreatitis: correlation between lack of contrast enhancement and pancreatic necrosis. This study was performed to determine if a correlation exists between pancreatic parenchymal enhancement or lack thereof on contrast-enhanced CT and surgical evidence of pancreatic necrosis. Accurate CT assessment of pancreatic vascular perfusion would be helpful in preoperative planning before pancreatic debridement and necrosectomy. The CT scans and medical records were blindly and retrospectively reviewed in 13 patients with the operative diagnosis of pancreatic necrosis. In all cases, CT examinations preceded surgery within 72 hr. Surgical and pathologic findings served as the gold standards for the diagnosis of pancreatic necrosis. Seven (54%) of 13 patients had a region or regions of parenchymal necrosis within the head, body, and/or tail of the pancreas seen during surgery. All seven of these patients had no pancreatic enhancement on CT in at least one region of the pancreas (CT sensitivity = 100%). In four of the seven, two regions were found to be necrotic at surgery, but only one of the two segments did not enhance on CT scans. In three of the seven patients, lack of contrast enhancement on CT (no enhancement of the pancreatic head and body in two patients and throughout the gland in another) correlated with necrosis in the same regions at surgery. The remaining six (46%) patients, who had peripancreatic or small, focal, and/or superficial areas of pancreatic necrosis at surgery, had normal pancreatic enhancement on CT. Our results show that regions of pancreatic necrosis found surgically correlate with lack of enhancement of pancreatic parenchyma on CT. Peripancreatic necrosis and minor areas of focal or superficial parenchymal necrosis were not detected on CT. 
Shunt failure caused by valve collapse. Shunt failure due to collapse of the Mini-Holter valve was observed 13 times in 11 out of 179 children with an implanted Mini-Holter ventriculo-peritoneal (VP) or ventriculo-atrial (VA) shunt during a 10 year period. Intussusception of the proximal or distal end of the valve thus caused a shunt failure rate of 6% of the children in this series. Two children experienced this complication twice. All collapsed valves were part of a VP shunt system. Because of this experience use of the mini valve was abandoned and an adult Holter valve was implanted in children over the age of one month. Breakdown of this particular valve has not occurred in 102 children and two hundred adults with the adult Holter shunt system. 
Myocardial ischemia during daily activities: the importance of increased myocardial oxygen demand. The role of increased myocardial oxygen demand in the pathophysiology of myocardial ischemia occurring during daily activities was evaluated in 50 patients with coronary artery disease and exercise-induced ST segment depression. Each patient underwent ambulatory electrocardiographic (ECG) monitoring for ST segment shifts during normal daily activities and symptom-limited bicycle exercise testing with continuous ECG monitoring. All 50 patients had ST depression greater than or equal to 0.1 mV during exercise. A total of 241 episodes of ST depression were noted in the ambulatory setting in 31 patients; only 6% of these were accompanied by angina pectoris. Significant (0.1 mV) ST depression during ambulatory monitoring was preceded by a mean increase in heart rate of 27 +/- 12 beats/min. Patients with ischemia during daily activities developed ST depression earlier during exercise (7.9 +/- 4.4 vs. 14.2 +/- 6.4 min, p less than 0.001) and tended to have significant ECG changes at a lower exercise heart rate and rate-pressure product than did those without ST depression during ambulatory monitoring. In the 31 patients with ischemia during daily activities, the mean heart rate associated with ST depression in the ambulatory setting was closely correlated with the heart rate precipitating ECG changes during exercise testing (r = 0.74, p less than 0.001). 
Renal artery stenosis: preliminary results of treatment with the Strecker stent. Use of the Strecker flexible balloon-expandable tantalum stent for treatment of renal artery stenosis after failed angioplasty or transaortic thromboendarterectomy was evaluated in 10 patients (nine hypertensive, one normotensive). Left (n = 3) and right (n = 5) renal arteries were involved; renal artery stenosis in two patients had developed after kidney transplantation. Indications for stent placement were inadequate immediate postangioplasty response (n = 7), development of considerable restenosis after angioplasty (n = 1), and obstructing intimal flaps following transaortic endarterectomy (n = 2). Stent placement was technically successful (less than 20% residual stenosis) and patency was preserved in eight patients. Of the seven hypertensive patients with successful implantation, two were cured, three had improvement, and two had no change at latest follow-up evaluation (mean, 10.6 months; range, 6-12 months). The Strecker stent may be helpful in treating restenosis after failed revascularization procedures, although the precise indication, true safety, and long-term efficacy of stent placement in renal arteries will not be known until trials with more subjects and longer follow-up periods are completed. 
Transoral decompression evaluated by cine-mode magnetic resonance imaging: a case of basilar impression accompanied by Chiari malformation. Cine-mode magnetic resonance imaging provides simultaneous images of cerebrospinal fluid flow dynamics. A patient with a basilar impression accompanied by a Chiari malformation and von Recklinghausen's disease who underwent transoral decompression is reported. Preoperative cine-mode magnetic resonance imaging visualized an associated obstruction of cerebrospinal fluid pulsatile flow at the level of the foramen magnum. Tonsilar herniation (Chiari I malformation) and hydrocephalus were also present. Postoperatively, the obstruction of cerebrospinal fluid flow was resolved concomitant with the correction of the cervicomedullary angulation. On the basis of observations made by magnetic resonance imaging, the surgical treatment of basilar impression accompanied by Chiari malformation is briefly discussed. 
Atrial natriuretic peptide response to cardioversion of atrial flutter and fibrillation and role of associated heart failure. Plasma atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) concentrations were measured before and 1 hour after cardioversion in 40 patients (27 with atrial flutter and 13 with atrial fibrillation) admitted for elective cardioversion. Fourteen (11 with atrial flutter and 3 with atrial fibrillation) had clinical evidence of congestive heart failure (CHF). Conversion to sinus rhythm was successful in 39 patients. The mean ANP concentration in the entire group decreased after cardioversion from 38 +/- 4 to 17 +/- 2 pmol/liter (p less than 0.001). In the subgroup with CHF, the ANP level, which was not significantly higher than that in the group without CHF, decreased from 47 +/- 8 to 19 +/- 3 pmol/liter (p less than 0.01). Neither mode of cardioversion (spontaneous 1, pharmacologic 2 and direct-current countershock 36) nor associated CHF influenced ANP response to cardioversion. One patient with atrial flutter and "failed cardioversion" had unchanged ANP level. The decrease after cardioversion in ANP concentration correlated with its control level (r = 0.88, p less than 0.001) but not with the decrease in heart rate. The ANP level in patients with atrial fibrillation was 45 +/- 9 vs 38 +/- 5 pmol/liter in those with atrial flutter (difference not significant). Arrhythmia duration, left atrial size, and ventricular rate or arterial blood pressure did not correlate with ANP concentration in any subgroup. It is concluded that (1) the ANP level is elevated comparably in patients with both atrial flutter and fibrillation regardless of the presence or absence of CHF; and (2) the level decreases, independent of the mode of cardioversion or presence of CHF, promptly after successful cardioversion. 
Quantitation of estrogen and androgen receptors in hepatocellular carcinoma and adjacent normal human liver. Sex hormones have been shown to influence the development and course of several liver diseases. The worldwide predominance of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in males has led to the suggestion that this disease might be hormone-responsive. Therefore, the hepatic estrogen (ER) and androgen receptor (AR) status of liver specimens from such patients was investigated. Samples were obtained from three female and six males patients undergoing liver resection; in each case, a small sample of both the tumor and adjacent normal tissue was collected. All patients had primary hepatocellular carcinoma without cirrhosis. In most cases, the tumor and the normal specimen had an equivalent content of cytosolic ER; however, three of the tumor samples (one female and two male) displayed considerably elevated cytosolic ER levels as compared to that of the normal tissue. In every sample, the tumor contained less nuclear ER than did the normal liver. When AR was measured, tumors of three patients (one female and two male) demonstrated a twofold elevation in cytosolic AR as compared to adjacent normal tissue. In the two male patients, an approximately twofold greater nuclear AR was found. Two other samples from male patients showed a modest elevation of cytosolic AR in the tumors. The patients whose tumors showed elevations in ER were not the same patients as those in whom the AR was elevated. Thus, these studies indicate that certain, but not all, specimens of HCC demonstrate either elevated ER or AR and suggest that a determination of receptor content might be useful prior to initiation of certain antihormone therapies. 
Premenstrual syndrome. Tailoring treatment to symptoms. Despite the interest in premenstrual syndrome (PMS) taken by the media and the public in recent years, some women still do not recognize the cyclic nature of their symptoms. Thus, PMS continues to elude diagnosis. Dr Nader discusses the major categories of symptoms and when they occur, summarizes theories on the cause of PMS, and comments on how well these theories have been substantiated by testing. Choosing agents for treatment on the basis of symptoms to be controlled is also described. 
CHARGE and Joubert syndromes: are they a single disorder? A patient with the CHARGE association (Coloboma of the eye, Heart defect, Atresia of the choana, Retarded growth and development, Genital hypoplasia, and Ear anomalies or deafness) had intermittent hyperpnea and cerebellar hypoplasia; therefore, he had both the CHARGE association and Joubert syndrome. The 2 syndromes have not been previously linked. We discuss their similarities and review the literature. 
Current medical management of cirrhotic ascites. The presence of ascites may indicate a number of hepatic and extra-hepatic disorders. This situation requires comprehensive evaluation to determine the underlying cause. The evaluation and management of ascites in patients with known cirrhosis is very important since this manifestation of portal hypertension has a detrimental effect on the prognosis for such patients. 
Hepatic colorectal metastases: correlation of MR imaging and pathologic appearance. Results of magnetic resonance (MR) imaging examinations for 76 patients with proved colorectal metastases to the liver were retrospectively reviewed. Signal intensity and morphologic patterns of 157 lesions were scored. The morphologic patterns were correlated with the histologic material obtained at segmental hepatic resections or excisional biopsies in 33 patients. In 154 lesions (98%) colorectal metastases to the liver were found to be hyperintense on MR images acquired with a long repetition time/echo time; in 77 lesions (49%) central low-signal-intensity changes were seen. Virtually all larger lesions demonstrated areas of low signal intensity within the tumor. These areas were found to reflect histologic findings of coagulative necrosis and desmoplasia within the tumor. Peripheral hyperintense halos around central hypointense areas encompassed the growing tumor margin and variable degrees of cell necrosis. Hypointense peripheral rims, which correspond to abnormalities of surrounding hepatic parenchyma, were seen in 40 lesions (25%). This sign should not be assumed to represent the fibrous pseudocapsule of primary hepatic malignancy. No correlation between tumor grade (differentiation) and tumor morphology was observed. 
Alterations of the nailfold capillary morphology associated with Raynaud phenomenon in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus. Quantitative analysis of nailfold capillary morphology was performed in age and sex matched groups of 29 patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) presenting Raynaud phenomenon (RP), 29 RP negative patients with SLE with the same duration of the disease, and 29 healthy controls. Percentages of tortuous, meandering and bushy capillaries were significantly increased in both groups of patients without influence of RP. Capillary density was lower, mean diameters of the capillary loops were higher in patients, especially when RP was present (at the venular branch in microns, mean +/- SD: controls: 15.0 +/- 2.0, RP negative patients with SLE: 17.6 +/- 3.6, RP positive patients with SLE: 20.5 +/- 6.3). In a subgroup of 13 patients with frequent Raynaud's attacks (more than 1/week), diameters were still higher (22.1 +/- 7.1, p to controls less than 0.0005; p to RP negative patients less than 0.05). In patients with SLE, the prevalence of RP seems not to be associated with the increased number of abnormal capillaries but with capillary enlargement, correlating with the frequency of attacks. 
A review of 32 cases of tardive dystonia. OBJECTIVE: Tardive dystonia, historically combined with tardive dyskinesia, is now viewed as probably having a different pathophysiology, course, outcome, and treatment response than tardive dyskinesia. In addition, patients with tardive dystonia are reported to be younger, and most are men. This study evaluates characteristics of 32 patients with tardive dystonia and compares results to other reports. METHOD: Twenty-four patients had been referred for research purposes and were videotaped, while eight had been followed clinically. Two of the authors reviewed all available videotapes and clinical reports to assess the course of symptoms over time. For global ratings and ratings of affected body parts, two scales were used: the Abnormal Involuntary Movement Scale (AIMS) for tardive dyskinesia and a similar scale for tardive dystonia. The method of case finding does not provide incidence or prevalence data for tardive dystonia. RESULTS: Fifty-nine percent of the patients experienced onset of tardive dystonia symptoms within 6 years of antipsychotic drug exposure; women had a shorter exposure time. No patient had complete remission of tardive dystonia symptoms, and 22 were moderately or severely impaired when their movements were most prominent. CONCLUSIONS: While epidemiological studies of tardive dystonia have yet to be performed, these results support the observations of others that most patients with tardive dystonia are men, have a short history of exposure to antipsychotic drugs, and may initially present with blepharospasm. Tardive dystonia rarely remits completely, can cause notable disability, and may partially respond to anticholinergic agents. 
The use of magnetic resonance imaging in the study of edema. A method of studying edema using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is presented. Three patients with lower extremity edema due to congestive heart failure were imaged with a 0.6 tesla system before and after diuresis. Edge detection algorithms were utilized to precisely outline regions of interest for quantification. Water and nonwater elements were separated within the region of interest to quantify water content. The results show that: (1) Edema can be quantified by use of MRI. (2) Subcutaneous edema is distributed along defined planes (ie, nonuniformly). (3) Increased water content is present not only in the subcutaneous tissue but also in deeper lying muscle. 
Hypertension and coronary artery disease. Can the chain be broken? Hypertension is an established risk factor for all the clinical sequelae of coronary artery disease. Despite this, individual therapeutic trials of antihypertensive therapy have not demonstrated the expected reduction in coronary morbidity and mortality. This apparent failure is perhaps not surprising when one considers the multifactorial nature of coronary artery disease and the different ways in which hypertension may affect the coronary circulation. Much debate has also centered on the antihypertensive therapy used in major trials in that it may in some way prevent the reduction in coronary mortality. However, thus far no clear evidence of a harmful effect has emerged. Reducing coronary mortality in hypertensive patients is a major challenge but one that can be effectively surmounted by approaching these different factors in a concerted manner. The ultimate goal must be to prevent the development of hypertension and left ventricular hypertrophy, but until such time as that can be achieved, the early detection of hypertension is mandatory. The optimal levels of systolic and diastolic blood pressures must be established. Studies on the more recent antihypertensive agents hold promise for a more specific effect on the atherosclerotic process as well as sustained control of arterial blood pressure. In this regard, it would seem essential to develop more precise ways of quantifying atherosclerosis and thus clarifying the nature of its relation to hypertension. Finally, management of hypertension must include precise assessment of the patient's overall cardiovascular risk status and appropriate and aggressive management of all risk factors for coronary artery disease. 
Platelet-activating factor produces shock, in vivo complement activation, and tissue injury in mice. We previously showed that TNF and endotoxin (LPS) synergize to activate the complement system and produce shock and bowel injury in normal mice. However, C5-deficient mice were protected from these adverse effects. In this study, we show that in mice, platelet-activating factor (PAF) antagonist prevents TNF- and LPS-induced complement activation, bowel injury, and death, indicating that PAF mediates the actions of TNF and LPS. We then examined the role of the complement system in PAF-induced shock and tissue injury. We found that 1) PAF (3 micrograms/kg) induces shock, hemoconcentration, bowel necrosis, and death in normal mice, whereas C5-deficient mice are protected from these effects. (Protection was abrogated when the dose of PAF was raised to 5 micrograms/kg.) Furthermore, when C5-deficient mice were reconstituted with normal serum, they also developed shock, bowel injury, and death in response to PAF. Thus, C5 is required for PAF to induce injury. 2) PAF activates the complement system in vivo, but not in vitro. The mechanism of complement activation by PAF is unclear. Inasmuch as PAF stimulates neutrophils to release protease that may activate the complement system, we examined the effect of neutrophil depletion on PAF-induced injury and complement activation. We found that neutrophil depletion fails to prevent PAF-induced complement activation, although PAF-induced lethality is much reduced. We conclude that PAF causes complement activation, and acts in synergy with active complement fragments to produce shock and tissue injury. Neutrophils probably do not play the pivotal role in PAF-induced complement activation. 
Leiomyosarcoma arising in atypical fibromuscular hyperplasia (phyllodes tumor) of the prostate with distant metastasis. An extremely rare neoplasm of the prostate, commonly known as phyllodes type of atypical prostatic hyperplasia, is described in a 57-year-old man. Over a 2-year period, the atypical smooth muscle component has transformed into leiomyosarcoma, and eventually metastasized to the bones and the lungs. Such an evolution has never been documented for this tumor. 
Rationale for development of low-molecular-weight heparins and their clinical potential in the prevention of postoperative venous thrombosis. Interest in low-molecular-weight heparins (LMWHs) as potential antithrombotic agents was stimulated by two observations in the mid-1970s and early 1980s. The first was finding that LMWH fractions prepared from unfractionated heparin (UFH) progressively lost their ability to prolong the activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT) while retaining their ability to inhibit Factor Xa. The second was the observation that LMWHs prepared by chemical depolarization of UFH are antithrombotic in experimental animal models but produce less microvascular bleeding in experimental models for an equivalent antithrombotic effect than the UFH from which they are derived. Subsequently, it was shown that LMWHs inhibit platelet function and impair vascular permeability less than standard heparin and that LMWHs have a longer biological half-life than standard heparin. A number of LMWHs have been evaluated in clinical trials in general and orthopedic surgery and in the treatment of venous thrombosis. LMWHs are highly effective in orthopedic surgery, where they appear to be more effective than standard heparin. LMWHs have also been shown to be either as effective or more effective than UFH in preventing postoperative thrombosis following general surgery. In preliminary studies, LMWHs appear to be as effective as standard heparin in the treatment of venous thrombosis, but larger studies are required using clinically relevant outcome measures. 
Cortical blindness and residual vision: is the "second" visual system in humans capable of more than rudimentary visual perception? We studied 12 patients with static cortical blindness to evaluate residual vision after destruction of area 17 and to assess the visual capacity of the subcortical "second" visual system in humans. In each case, the cause was bilateral infarction of the occipital lobes. Five patients had total blindness, and four had residual rudimentary vision (RRV), characterized by homonymous areas of light perception in the peripheral field and ability to detect moving objects. Only three patients had the ability to read; two of these had spared macular vision, and the other had spared left homonymous hemimaculae and spared temporal crescent. Neuroimaging and visual evoked potentials (VEPs) correlated with the extent of the visual dysfunction. Total destruction of area 17 bilaterally was associated with total permanent visual loss. The larger the amount of spared visual cortex, the better the vision. Positron emission tomography (PET) or single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) demonstrated retained metabolic activity in islands of preserved area 17 in patients with some residual vision. VEPs were present in totally blind individuals. We conclude that, in humans, useful visual function is preserved only when a critical amount of area 17 is spared. The subcortical second system may participate in the generation of VEPs, but is incapable of conscious visual perception. 
Estramustine binding protein in human brain-tumor tissue. Estramustine, an estradiol-17 beta and nornitrogen mustard complex, is used in the treatment of advanced prostatic carcinoma. A specific estramustine binding protein (EMBP) is important for its cytotoxic action, and the presence of EMBP has previously been demonstrated in rat and human prostatic cancer tissue. Significant levels of EMBP were detected by radioimmunoassay in human brain-tumor tissue. The EMBP concentrations (expressed as ng/mg protein) in 16 astrocytomas (mean 2.6 ng/mg, range 0.5 to 6.2 ng/mg) and seven meningiomas (mean 5.1 ng/mg, range 0.3 to 9.3 ng/mg) were significantly higher than that found in four samples of epileptic brain (mean 0.7 ng/mg, range 0.5 to 1 ng/mg) and 18 samples of normal brain (mean 0.5 ng/mg, range 0.2 to 1.0 ng/mg). The uptake, metabolism, and antiproliferative effects of the prostatic anticancer agent estramustine have been previously demonstrated in cultured glioma cells. The presence of EMBP may suggest a selective binding and effectiveness in human brain-tumor tissue. 
Determination of pulse wave velocities with computerized algorithms. Careful determination of pulse wave velocity is important in the study of arterial viscoelastic properties, wave reflections, and ventricular-arterial interactions. In spite of its increasingly widespread use, there is as yet no standardized method for its determination. Most studies have manually identified the transit time of the pressure wave front as it travels over a known distance in the arterial system, but the issues of accuracy and reproducibility have not been addressed. This study was designed to investigate the efficacy of four computerized algorithms in the determination of pulse wave velocities in invasive as well as in noninvasive pressure determinations. The four methods were the identification of: (1) the point of minimum diastolic pressure, (2) the point at which the first derivative of pressure is maximum, (3) the point at which the second derivative of pressure is maximum, and (4) the point yielded by the intersection of a line tangent to the initial systolic upstroke of the pressure tracing and a horizontal line through the minimum point. High-fidelity aortic pressure recordings were obtained in 26 patients with a multi-sensor micromanometer catheter. Noninvasive brachial and radial pressure waveforms were recorded in 11 volunteers with external piezoelectric transducers. The results show that the first derivative method consistently provided results that were different from the other methods for both the invasive and noninvasive methods because of changes in the structure of the upstroke as the arterial pulse propagates distally. Although the minimum method worked well for the invasive determinations, it was erratic with the noninvasive determinations, probably because of the higher amount of noise and reflection in the latter. Among the four algorithms, the second derivative and the intersecting tangents methods worked well with both invasive and noninvasive determinations with mean variation coefficients of less than 7% and correlation coefficients between the methods of greater than 0.90 for all data. In conclusion, computerized algorithms allow accurate determination of pulse wave velocity in invasively and noninvasively measured arterial pressure waveforms. 
CT of the gastrointestinal tract: principles and interpretation. The experience accumulated in daily abdominal CT scanning and CT evaluation of gastrointestinal lesions has generated helpful technical guidelines and some reliable principles of interpretation. These general principles are briefly discussed in this review, and the importance of performing a CT examination that is adequate for the detection and evaluation of gastrointestinal lesions is stressed. CT features useful in differentiating benign from malignant lesions, limitations and pitfalls in CT interpretation, overlap in the CT appearance, and classical CT features leading to specific diagnoses are described and illustrated. Although CT is established as one of the most important techniques for imaging the gastrointestinal tract, it should be used selectively and only in the context of appropriate clinical and conventional radiologic examination. CT should not be regarded as competing with, but as complementing, barium examination of the gastrointestinal tract. 
Visual field defects in diabetic patients with primary open-angle glaucoma. We reviewed the automated visual field tests of 110 nondiabetic and 87 diabetic patients with primary open-angle glaucoma randomly selected from a large glaucoma practice to investigate a possible qualitative difference in the pattern of visual field defects between nondiabetic and diabetic patients with primary open-angle glaucoma. A single reviewer analyzed, in masked fashion, the visual field tests of each patient and decided whether or not visual field defects were present mainly in the inferior half of the visual field. Of the 110 nondiabetic patients, 40 (36.4%) had visual field defects located mainly in the inferior half of the visual field in one or both eyes, whereas 56 of the 87 (64.4%) diabetic patients had such defects. This difference was statistically significant (P = .0001). We believe that a vascular factor, such as that attributable to diabetes mellitus, may influence glaucomatous optic nerve damage, thus causing a difference in the pattern of visual field loss in patients with primary open-angle glaucoma. 
C6 glioma-astrocytoma cell and fetal astrocyte migration into artificial basement membrane: a permissive substrate for neural tumors but not fetal astrocytes. Cortically homografted C6 glioma-astrocytoma cells both invade the rat host brain as a mass and migrate as individual cells. In contrast, fetal astrocytes derived from homografted whole pieces of fetal cortex migrate only as individual cells throughout the brain of the rat but are not capable of invasion. Our experiment explored the migratory capacity (over 7 days) of cultured purified fetal astrocytes and C6 cells after seeding 10(6) cells on a hydrated artificial basement membrane wafer (Matrigel). The artificial basement membrane wafer was not a suitable substrate for the growth of cultured fetal astrocytes. In contrast, C6 cells migrated as individual cells from the surface of the wafer into the substrate. Individual C6 cells migrated 1.8 mm in the first 4 days and then ceased migration. The C6 cells were observed at the base of a digestion tube that extended from and was open to the surface of the wafer. At 3 days, micropockets were observed to form around each C6 cell at the base of each tube. By 7 days, the majority of pockets observed were large and contained several C6 cells. These multiple cell groups appeared to be progenitors of tumor masses. These data indicate that C6 glioma-astrocytoma cells, which in vivo appear to be a model for glioblastoma multiforme, primarily migrate as individual cells through artificial basement membrane and secondarily form tumor masses. Progenitor tumor masses form by coalescence of individual C6 cell micropockets or the division of a single cell in an individual micropocket. 
Liver metastases: results of percutaneous ethanol injection in 14 patients. Percutaneous ethanol injection (PEI) was performed under ultrasound (US) guidance in the outpatient department in 14 patients with 21 metastases 1.0-3.8 cm in diameter. The primary cancer was colorectal adenocarcinoma (seven patients), adenocarcinoma of the stomach (four patients), abdominal leiomyosarcoma (one patient), gastrinoma of unknown origin (one patient), and bronchial carcinoid (one patient). The indicators of therapeutic efficacy were US, computed tomography, fine-needle biopsy, and serologic markers. No complications occurred after a total of 175 treatment sessions. Complete response was obtained in 11 lesions, nine of which were less than 2 cm in diameter, and in all endocrine metastases (four lesions in two patients) with a maximum, recurrence-free follow-up of 38 months. Carcinoembryonic antigen values decreased in all patients but one for a 2-6-month period. The natural course of metastatic disease strictly limits the applicability of PEI, a local treatment. Single, metachronous, nonoperable metastasis of adenocarcinoma and endocrine metastases seem to be the only indications for PEI. 
Theophylline-associated seizures with "therapeutic" or low toxic serum concentrations: risk factors for serious outcome in adults. We report 12 adults with seizures associated with serum theophylline levels between 14 and 35 mg/l. The seizures were frequently prolonged, and outcome was generally poor with eight deaths. Although we did not identify comparable control groups, possible risk factors for serious outcome in theophylline-associated seizures were age, previous brain injury or disease, severe pulmonary disease, and possibly low serum albumin level. In patients with these risk factors, serum theophylline levels should be maintained below 10 to 15 mg/l. 
Multivessel PTCA using the hugging balloon technique based on single guide catheter and dual balloon-on-a-wire systems. For percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA) of oversized arteries, often-times a satisfactory dilatation cannot be achieved with conventional balloon systems due to the unavailability of adequately sized balloons. This fact has contributed to a higher restenosis rate for this group of patients. We were able to obtain a satisfactory dilatation result in an oversized right coronary artery with a shepherd's crook configuration and eccentric anatomy at the origin using two balloon-on-a-wire systems and an Amplatz type guiding catheter. Although such favorable dilatation of an oversized artery using this "hugging balloon technique" can be expected, issues do exist such as difficult maneuverability and estimation of the balloon size obtained through simultaneous dual balloon inflation wherein size does not simply equal the sum of the two balloon catheters. It is hoped that there will be further improvements of the technique and development of new systems. At this time, however, it is felt that this is the most effective and reasonable strategy to achieve a high chance of success in oversized vessel lesions. 
Combined interferon alfa and doxorubicin in the treatment of advanced cervical cancer. Interferon alfa and doxorubicin have been shown to have synergistic effects when tested in vitro with cells derived from cervical cancers. A clinical trial was designed, testing interferon alfa plus doxorubicin in patients with advanced or recurrent cervical cancers. Twenty-one patients were given interferon alfa, 10 million units per square meter intramuscularly and 10 million units per square meter intravenously over a 30-minute infusion period. One hour later 20 mg/m2 doxorubicin was given intravenously slowly over a 2-hour period. Treatments were repeated once weekly for 3 weeks. Initial response evaluation was done at week 5, and treatment was continued on an every-other-week schedule for patients showing favorable responses or stable disease. Bone marrow, hepatic, and renal toxicities were minimal. Fever and malaise were the major sources of toxicity. Of the 17 evaluable patients, six had clinical partial responses. Two of the responders have enjoyed more than 5 years' survival. This regimen is well tolerated and does have efficacy in some patients with advanced cervical cancers. 
Repetitive sinoatrial exit block as the major mechanism of drug-provoked long sinus or atrial pause. Prolonged sinus or atrial pause occurred in six patients with paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia after drug administration. All six patients had normal sinus node function during control electrophysiologic study; the sinus cycle length ranged from 510 to 900 ms (mean 743 +/- 141) and the longest sinus node recovery time ranged from 800 to 1,230 ms (mean 1,018 +/- 168). A long sinus or atrial pause occurring at the termination of tachycardia or cessation of atrial pacing, ranging from 3,100 to 8,200 ms (mean 6,270 +/- 1,674), was provoked by the administration of various drugs. These included an intravenous bolus injection of adenosine triphosphate (5 mg; one patient), intravenous bolus injection of verapamil (5 mg; one patient), a combination of a single oral dose of diltiazem (120 mg) and propranolol (20 to 40 mg; three patients), oral diltiazem (240 mg/day; one patient) and a combination of oral diltiazem (240 mg/day) and propranolol (160 mg/day; one patient). In five patients, low frequency deflections suggestive of sinus node activity with a cycle length between 620 and 3,500 ms were recorded during pauses. These findings suggest that repetitive sinoatrial exit block was responsible for the pause. Sinus slowing with a long arrest suggesting suppression of sinus automaticity was also noted in three of these five patients; the longest sinus arrest in these three patients was 4,160, 4,800 and greater than 4,910 ms, respectively. The remaining patient with a pause of 6,840 ms had no recordable sinus activity, either reflecting suppression of sinus automaticity or technical failure. 
Intracranial aneurysms in sickle-cell anemia: clinical features and pathogenesis. Intracranial aneurysms are an unusual complication of sickle-cell anemia; only 15 patients have been described in the world literature. An additional 15 patients with sickle-cell anemia and subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) from ruptured intracranial aneurysms are presented. There was a high incidence of multiple aneurysms (60%); some of which were in unusual locations. The clinical and pathological features of this series of patients have provided a paradigm for acquired aneurysm formation that may be applicable to other intracranial aneurysms. Thirteen patients underwent craniotomy and clip ligation; the perioperative management of these patients is discussed. Of these 13, eight had a good recovery, three were left with moderate disability, one patient died of surgical complications, and one died of complications related to sickle-cell anemia. Two of the 15 patients died of SAH. The authors propose that endothelial injury from the abnormal adherence of sickle erythrocytes to the endothelium is the initiating event in arterial wall injury. Subsequently, there is fragmentation of the internal elastic lamina and degeneration of the smooth-muscle layer. Hemodynamic stress at these loci of arterial wall damage results in aneurysm formation. This hypothesis also explains other cerebrovascular manifestations of sickle-cell anemia, namely vaso-occlusive disease and hemorrhage without aneurysm formation. Pathological material from this series and data from the literature are presented to support this hypothesis. 
Time course of recovery from frostbitten phrenics after coronary artery bypass graft surgery. Bilateral diaphragmatic paralysis developed in a patient after coronary artery bypass graft surgery during which cold cardioplegia was used. The patient's progress and eventual recovery over an 18-month period is described, with particular reference to chest wall motion and respiratory pressure measurements. 
Necrotizing bronchial aspergillosis in a patient receiving neoadjuvant chemotherapy for non-small cell lung carcinoma. We describe a case of necrotizing bronchial aspergillosis which developed after lobectomy following neoadjuvant chemotherapy in a 73-year-old woman with non-small cell lung cancer. The lesion was visualized and biopsied through FBS, which played a useful role for early diagnosis of this disease. Itraconazole therapy was effective and safe. 
Effect of antihypertensive therapy on focal stroke in spontaneously hypertensive rats. Spontaneously hypertensive rats subjected to focal cerebral ischemia develop larger infarcts than normotensive rat strains. To determine whether antihypertensive therapy decreases infarct volume in hypertensive rats, 60 13-week-old animals were treated with 20 mg/kg hydralazine added daily to the drinking water for 1.5, 6, 10, or 16 weeks and then subjected to focal cerebral ischemia by tandem right common carotid artery and middle cerebral artery occlusion. Blood pressure in the treated groups was substantially lower than that in untreated groups after 1 week of hydralazine therapy and remained lower for the entire treatment period in all four experiments. Mean infarct volume in spontaneously hypertensive rats treated for 10 (p = 0.02) or 16 (p = 0.005) weeks, but not 1.5 or 6 weeks, was significantly less than that in the untreated controls. The percentage reduction of infarct volume in animals treated for 10 and 16 weeks was similar. This study demonstrates that antihypertensive therapy decreases infarct volume in hypertensive rats subjected to focal cerebral ischemia. This treatment effect appears to be dependent on the duration of therapy, and the magnitude of the treatment effect seems to plateau by 10 weeks of therapy. 
The effects of resection of the proximal part of the fibula on stability of the knee and on gait. We studied six patients to determine the effects of unilateral marginal resection of the proximal part of the fibula on stability of the knee and on gait. At the time of the operation, the fibular collateral ligament and the tendon of the biceps femoris were reattached, but no attempt was made to stabilize the fibula otherwise. The patients were tested an average of sixty-one months after operation. Stability of the knee was measured with an instrumented system. Gait was evaluated with an optical electronic three-dimensional digitizing system and a multicomponent force-platform. The gait of six healthy control subjects of similar age was also studied, and the reproducibility of measurements of stability of the knee was investigated in four healthy adults. There were significant differences between the side on which an operation had been done and the contralateral side with regard to the extent of anterior translation and of total anterior-posterior translation of the tibia at both 20 and 90 degrees of flexion of the knee, and in total varus and valgus rotation of the knee (the number of degrees from a position of maximum varus to one of maximum valgus angulation) at 20 degrees of flexion. The measurements of gait and of motion of the knee were found to be normal when compared with those in the control subjects. In the ground-reaction measurements, there were some significant differences from normal in the medial-lateral plane, but they were clinically unimportant. Resection of the proximal part of the fibula can lead to instability of the knee. 
Bacterial meningitis following spinal anaesthesia for caesarean section. We report a case of meningitis caused by inadvertent introduction of bacteria following spinal anaesthesia for Caesarean section. The technique of performing the spinal anaesthesia is reviewed. Meningitis may occur, although very rarely, despite meticulous aseptic techniques. It is vital that meningitis should be considered in the differential diagnoses of post-spinal headache when patients present with headaches, pyrexia and meningism in the postoperative or postpartum period. 
The effects of chronic endoscopic variceal sclerotherapy on portal pressure in cirrhotics. The effect of obliterating esophageal varices by endoscopic sclerotherapy on portal pressure was prospectively studied in 11 cirrhotic patients with variceal hemorrhage. Portal venous pressure gradient, determined as the difference between transhepatic portal and hepatic vein pressure, increased by a mean of 31.1% +/- 14.5% in 8 (73%) and decreased by a mean of 30.1% +/- 11.7% in 3 (27%) patients, with no statistically significant change overall (P = 0.1). These changes in portal venous pressure gradient occurred despite an improvement in the laboratory and clinical parameters of hepatic function. Deep abdominal sonography with color flow imaging at variceal obliteration showed patent paraumbilical veins in 6 (55%) patients, 3 of whom had decreases in portal venous pressure gradient (29%, 19%, 42.5%) at variceal obliteration. In 5 (45%) patients without patent paraumbilical veins, a statistically significant increase in portal venous pressure gradient between initial endoscopic variceal sclerotherapy and variceal obliteration was noted (P = 0.008). Rebleeding (single episode in all 4 patients, before obliteration in 3 patients) occurred in those with an increase in portal venous pressure gradient; all patients with portal venous pressure gradient decreases were nonbleeders. No correlation between changes in portal venous pressure gradient and time to variceal obliteration, number of sclerotherapy treatments, or rebleeding episodes was observed. Thus, an increase in portal venous pressure gradient was noted in the majority of patients at variceal obliteration. Although the portal venous pressure gradient decrease may be explained by a patent paraumbilical vein, the mechanism of portal venous pressure gradient increase is not clear. It is speculated that this portal venous pressure gradient increase may be caused by an increase in collateral resistance or flow or a combination of both, resulting from obliteration of esophageal varices by endoscopic sclerotherapy. 
Portal venous system after portosystemic shunts or endoscopic sclerotherapy: evaluation with Doppler sonography. We sought to determine the usefulness of duplex Doppler sonography in the assessment of blood flow and clot formation in the portal vein in 44 patients with portal hypertension and bleeding esophageal varices who had undergone either endoscopic sclerotherapy (28 cases) or portosystemic shunt procedures (16 cases). The main, left, and right portal veins (collectively referred to as intrahepatic portal veins), superior mesenteric vein, splenic vein, and shunt were assessed for flow direction, presence of thrombi, and collaterals. Patent shunts were visualized in 12 (75%) of the 16 cases. Clot was detected in 27 (69%) of 39 intrahepatic portal veins in patients with end-to-side shunts, in six (67%) of nine intrahepatic portal veins in patients with distal splenorenal shunts, and in five (5%) of 92 intrahepatic portal veins in patients who had had endoscopic sclerotherapy. Flow in the main portal vein was hepatopetal in two (15%) of 13 patients with patent shunts (one end-to-side portacaval shunt and one distal splenorenal shunt). Flow in the main portal vein was hepatopetal in 26 (93%) of 28 patients who had had endoscopic sclerotherapy. Our data suggest endoscopic sclerotherapy preserves antegrade portal flow and results in fewer portal vein clots than surgical portosystemic shunts do. Patterns of thrombosis and flow direction vary unpredictably from patient to patient. Shunt patency should not be inferred without direct visualization of the shunt. 
Funic reduction for the management of umbilical cord prolapse. The current management of umbilical cord prolapse centers on attempts to alleviate the pressure of the presenting part on the cord while preparation for cesarean section is being made. A 10-year experience in which there were vigorous attempts to accomplish safe vaginal delivery after the diagnosis of umbilical cord prolapse is presented. Eight cases of umbilical cord prolapse occurred, a frequency of 1 in 277 deliveries (0.37%), all of which had a normal immediate neonatal outcome. Vaginal delivery was accomplished in seven patients (87.5%); diagnosis was made in two of them when delivery was imminent. Five patients were more remote from delivery and had successful funic reduction (manual replacement of the prolapsed cord). Funic reduction is proposed as a potentially beneficial initial step in the management of umbilical cord prolapse. 
Sudden unexpected death due to papillary fibroma of the aortic valve. Report of a case and review of the literature. The case of the sudden unexpected death of a 21-year-old man due to embolization of segments of an aortic valve papillary fibroma to the left main and anterior descending coronary artery is presented. The literature regarding cardiac papillary fibroma is reviewed with particular reference to those cases associated with sudden death. 
Laser balloon angioplasty: potential for reduction of the thrombogenicity of the injured arterial wall and for local application of bioprotective materials. Mitigation of adverse biologic reactivity after balloon angioplasty is necessary before the incidence of restenosis can be appreciably reduced. A brief review of experimental evidence supports the hypothesis that the thrombogenicity of the injured arterial wall can be reduced by a suitable level of thermal denaturation or cross-linking of thrombogenic proteins. In addition, the concept of local pharmacologic therapy, which can be provided with laser balloon angioplasty at the site of arterial injury, is introduced. Preliminary in vitro and in vivo data suggest that guide catheter-injected albumin-heparin conjugates fabricated as water-insoluble microspheres remain adherent to the injured luminal surface and deeper arterial layers after physical trapping by the inflated balloon and subsequent laser/thermal exposure. The combination of initially adequate luminal morphology, reduction of the thrombogenicity of the injured arterial wall and application of local pharmacologic therapy with laser balloon angioplasty may eventually prove helpful in reducing the incidence of restenosis. 
Innominate artery occlusive disease: surgical approach and long-term results. We reviewed our experience with 54 patients who underwent innominate artery revascularization during a 10-year period. Their age range was from 16 to 75 years (mean, 49.8 years). The innominate artery alone was involved in 21 patients (39%); the remaining patients had additional arch vessel obstructions. Before operation, neurologic symptoms occurred in 25 patients (46%), arm ischemia related to claudication and microembolization occurred in 8 patients (14%), a combination of symptoms occurred in 17 patients (32%), and no symptoms were noted in 4 patients (8%). The extrathoracic approach to surgery was used in 16 patients (30%). Eleven of the 38 patients in whom the intrathoracic approach was used had endarterectomy of the innominate artery; in three of those, the procedure was combined with left common carotid endarterectomy. Bypass grafts were used in the other 27 patients undergoing procedures with an intrathoracic approach; in six of those, bypass was combined with carotid endarterectomy. No operative deaths occurred. Perioperative revascularization failure occurred in four cases; all of those patients underwent a second revascularization procedure, with a secondary patency rate of 100%. In four patients, late occlusion was noted at 6 months and at 1, 1.5, and 10 years. One patient had a permanent perioperative neurologic deficit in the distribution of the left carotid artery after a combined common carotid endarterectomy/innominate endarterectomy procedure. No neurologic deficits were directly related to the innominate artery territory. Long-term actuarial survival was 83% at 10 years. Early and late graft failures were related to inadequate inflow in bypass grafts, progression of distal disease in arteritis, and primary closure in endarterectomy. 
Idiotypic cross-reactivity of immunoglobulins expressed in Waldenstrom's macroglobulinemia, chronic lymphocytic leukemia, and mantle zone lymphocytes of secondary B-cell follicles. Monoclonal antibodies (MoAbs) specific for autoantibody-associated cross-reactive idiotypes (CRIs) of Waldenstrom's IgM react frequently with the surface Ig (slg) expressed by leukemia cells of patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). Evaluation of the molecular basis for this cross-reactivity indicates that such CRIs are encoded by conserved antibody variable region genes (V genes) that have undergone little or no somatic hypermutation. We find that such anti-CRI MoAbs stain a subpopulation of cells within the mantle zones surrounding the germinal centers of normal human tonsil. In contrast, MoAbs specific for variable region subgroup determinants react with cells in both the mantle zones and germinal centers of secondary B-cell follicles. To test whether mantle zone B cells not reactive with existing anti-CRI MoAbs may express slg bearing as-yet-unrecognized CRIs present on Igs produced by neoplastic cells of some patients with Waldenstrom's macroglobulinemia or CLL, we immunized mice with purified Waldenstrom's IgM that have been characterized for their variable region subgroups using subgroup-specific antisera raised against synthetic peptides. The supernatants of hybridomas generated from the splenocytes of immunized mice were screened for their ability to stain a subpopulation of mantle zone lymphocytes in human tonsil. With this approach, two new anti-CRI MoAbs were identified, designated OAK1 and VOH3. OAK1 binds to a CRI present on a subset of kappa light chains of the VK1 subgroup. VOH3 recognizes a CRI determinant(s) present on a subset of antibody heavy chains of the VH3 subgroup. Flow cytometric analyses demonstrated that OAK1 specifically binds leukemia cells from 5 to 20 patients (25%) with kappa light chain expressing CLL. In addition, VOH3 reacted with the leukemia cells from 1 of 17 (6%) patients tested. The success of these methods demonstrates that the variable regions of the Igs produced by mantle zone B cells share idiotypic determinants with Igs expressed in B-cell CLL (B-CLL) and Waldenstrom's macroglobulinemia. 
Suturing or stapling in gastrointestinal surgery: a prospective randomized study. West of Scotland and Highland Anastomosis Study Group. A prospective randomized study of 1004 patients is reported, comparing surgical stapling and manual suturing techniques in the construction of gastrointestinal anastomoses. The incidence of clinical leaks was similar between the two groups (sutured 3.2 per cent, stapled 4.7 per cent; P = 0.22), while for radiological leaks the incidence was significantly higher in the sutured group (12.2 per cent versus 4.1 per cent, P less than 0.05). Stapling instruments afforded significantly quicker anastomoses, mean(s.e.m.) 28.1(0.7) versus 14.3(0.5) min (P less than 0.001), and quicker operations, 115.5(2.4) versus 103.8(2.2) min (P less than 0.001). The two groups were found to be comparable in other respects such as operative mortality, requirements for blood transfusion, incidence of infective complications, recovery of gastrointestinal function and postoperative hospital stay. 
Hepatitis C in liver transplant recipients. HCV infection is commonly found in patients with chronic liver disease undergoing liver transplantation. However, the presence of antibody to HCV does not appear to be associated with the development of hepatitis posttransplant. No other risk factors were identified that appear to predispose patients to development of hepatitis in the posttransplant period, including amount of blood product exposure. The role of immunosuppression in the acquisition and expression of liver disease caused by HCV remains to be determined. 
Cholestasis and changes of portal pressure caused by chlorpromazine in the perfused rat liver. Chlorpromazine (10 mumol/L) causes a marked increase in portal pressure in perfused rat liver. Simultaneously, oxygen consumption, hepatic clearance of taurocholate and bile flow are diminished. These effects are prevented by the cyclooxygenase inhibitors indomethacin (15 mumol/L), acetylsalicylate (3 mmol/L) or ibuprofen (200 mumol/L). On addition of chlorpromazine the liver releases increased amounts of prostaglandin D2; this increase does not occur in the presence of indomethacin. At higher concentrations of chlorpromazine (100 mumol/L) the inhibition of taurocholate clearance and bile flow is accompanied by only a moderate increase of portal pressure, and indomethacin is without effect. At this high concentration, substantial cell damage, as indicated by the release of lactate dehydrogenase, is present. We conclude that arachidonic acid-derived metabolites, notably prostanoids, are involved in the inhibition of bile flow and of taurocholate clearance observed at low concentrations of chlorpromazine. The data suggest that changes in the microcirculation are responsible for the impairment of the liver functions. At higher concentrations of chlorpromazine the cell toxicity of the drug becomes prominent. 
Prevention of an air embolism by moderate hypoventilation during surgery in the sitting position. The effect of ventilation (normo-, hypo-, and hyperventilation) on transverse sinus pressure (TSP), central venous pressure (CVP), mean arterial blood pressure (mABP), and heart rate was studied in 15 patients undergoing neurosurgical treatment in the sitting position for tumors of the posterior fossa, and the findings were compared with the influence of positive end expiratory pressure (PEEP) on these parameters. TSP was not influenced significantly by PEEP ranging from 0 to 15 mbar, whereas CVP increased. At the same time, mABP decreased slightly. In contrast, TSP showed characteristic changes with varying ventilation: during normoventilation [end expiratory CO2 pressure (PECO2), 38 mm Hg], TSP was 3 mm Hg and increased to 7 mm Hg on average with hypoventilation (PECO2, 44 mm Hg), whereas hyperventilation (PECO2, 32 mm Hg) caused a reduction in TSP to the atmospheric range. At the same time, CVP remained unchanged, whereas mABP increased with hypoventilation. Presuming that the risk of venous air embolism is closely related to the level of TSP, our results allow the following conclusions. 1) PEEP does not seem to be effective in preventing venous air embolism. 2) Hyperventilation is dangerous in the sitting position, as TSP is reduced to the atmospheric and even subatmospheric range. 3) To prevent air embolism, moderate hypoventilation is recommended during the most critical period of exposing the posterior fossa followed by normoventilation when surgery of the actual lesion has begun. 
Pyruvate dehydrogenase deficiency due to a 20-bp deletion in exon II of the pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) E1 alpha gene. A 20-bp deletion in the last exon of the pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) E1 alpha gene was found in a severely affected female patient diagnosed with PDH deficiency. PDH-complex activity in the patient's fibroblasts was 22% of that in normal controls. The mutation was characterized using PCR techniques with both patient cDNA and genomic DNA, followed by sequencing of the products. E1 beta cDNA sequence was found to be the same as that in controls. The deletion causes a frameshift and the occurrence of a premature stop codon. Western blot analysis revealed an extra band migrating just above the PDH E1 beta band. Northern blot analysis showed normal levels of both E1 alpha and E1 beta message when probed with the respective cDNAs. However, a larger intermediate-size transcript was observed for this patient in the E1 beta blot. The 20-bp deletion was not found in either parent's genomic DNA, and hence we conclude that the mutation must have occurred de novo, either in the germ-line cells or immediately following fertilization. 
Induction and prevention of radiocontrast-induced nephropathy in dogs with heart failure. Radiocontrast-induced nephropathy (RCIN) is a clinically important cause of acute renal failure with no effective treatment. Recognizing the high incidence of RCIN in humans with severe congestive heart failure (CHF), this study was designed to test the hypotheses that dogs with experimental CHF are at increased risk for RCIN and that pharmacologic renal levels of atrial natriuretic factor (ANF) can prevent RCIN in this model. In chronic experiments, three groups of five conscious dogs received intravenous radiocontrast (7 ml/kg). One group consisted of normal controls, while the two other groups had experimental CHF induced by eight days of ventricular pacing at 250 beats per minute. One of the CHF groups received an infusion of ANF (30 ng/kg/min) into the suprarenal aorta for one hour before, during and after the infusion of radiocontrast to achieve pharmacologic renal plasma levels. Renal function remained stable in the normal controls in contrast to the consistent decreases in daily creatinine clearance during the five days following radiocontrast in experimental CHF. In addition, ANF prevented radiocontrast-induced reductions in creatinine clearance in dogs with experimental CHF. Additional studies performed in two groups of anesthetized dogs with experimental CHF demonstrated that, in this model of RCIN, the reduction in renal function appears biphasic, and the action of ANF may be to increase glomerular filtration rate prior to radiocontrast, thus allowing a maintenance of renal function during and after radiocontrast. 
MR imaging of the portal venous system: value of gradient-echo imaging as an adjunct to spin-echo imaging. We evaluated the use of gradient-echo (GRE) as an adjunct to spin-echo (SE) MR imaging of the portal venous system. GRE imaging was performed in 31 subjects, 15 normal volunteers and 16 patients with documented portal venous disease (15 cases) or suspected disease (one case). Eight of 16 patients had venous thrombosis, five had focal thrombus, and three had complete occlusion. Six patients had extrinsic venous compression by tumor. Of the two other patients, one had an arteriovenous fistula and the other a falsely positive angiogram, suggesting portal vein occlusion. In normal subjects, GRE scans had excellent visualization of the portal venous system with high intravascular signal compared with surrounding tissues. Nine (60%) of 15 normal subjects and three patients had an artifact consisting of a curvilinear area of decreased signal that could mimic clot. In three of five patients with focal thrombus, clot was identified on GRE but not on SE images. In all three patients with occlusion, SE and GRE images demonstrated similar findings. In five of the six patients with extrinsic venous compression by tumor, SE and GRE studies showed similar findings. Of the two patients, an arteriovenous fistula was seen on GRE MR in one, and in the other, patency of the left portal vein was seen on SE and GRE images after angiography had suggested portal vein occlusion. Collateral vessels were seen in nine of 16 patients. In five of nine cases, GRE MR demonstrated more extensive collaterals than did SE MR. In summary, GRE MR provides a useful adjunct to standard SE MR imaging. Benefits include high contrast between vascular structures and surrounding tissues, reduced motion artifact, and rapid scanning within a breath-hold. 
Posttraumatic stress disorder following recent-onset psychosis. An unrecognized postpsychotic syndrome. Clinical experience with psychotic patients early in the course of their illness suggested that symptoms of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) may not be uncommon after recovery from an acute psychotic episode. Thirty-six patients recovering from an acute psychotic episode within 2 to 3 years of onset of their illness were assessed as inpatients and followed up on two occasions during the year after discharge. The prevalence of PTSD was found to be 46% at 4 months and 35% at 11 months, measured by a questionnaire linked to DSM-III criteria. The relationships between negative symptomatology and PTSD symptoms and between depressive symptomatology and PTSD symptoms were also examined; a significant correlation was found only for the latter. The psychopathological, preventive, and therapeutic implications of these findings are discussed, and future research strategies are proposed. 
The effect of quadriceps excision on functional results after distal femoral resection and prosthetic replacement of bone tumors. Although resection and reconstruction with a prosthesis is an accepted form of treatment for tumors of the distal femur, minimal effort has been made to correlate the functional result with the degree of adjacent muscle excision. From 1983 to 1986, 65 patients had distal femoral resection and prosthetic reconstruction. Ten patients had only the vastus intermedius excised (Group A), 30 patients had excision of the vastus intermedius plus either the vastus medialis or lateralis (Group B), nine patients had only the rectus femoris spared (Group C), and 16 patients had the entire quadriceps excised or conversion of the previous arthrodesis (Group D). Based on the rating system of the Musculoskeletal Tumor Society, satisfactory results were obtained in 70% of Group A patients (30% excellent and 40% good), with no poor results. In group B, 80% had good or excellent results and 7% poor results. In Group C, 78% of the patients had good results but no excellent results, whereas Group D had only 50% satisfactory results. The parameters that most often led to functional impairment were restricted motion and inadequate extensor powers. Muscle transfers, however, (flexors to extensors) were effective only in Group C patients. With proper technique and prosthetic design, satisfactory results can be achieved after distal femoral resection and prosthetic reconstruction, even after extensive quadriceps excision. 
Swedish Agency for Research Cooperation with Developing Countries. Prospects for public health benefits in developing countries from new vaccines against enteric infections. The symposium participants concluded that vaccines with even moderate efficacy can be highly useful to prevent large numbers of severe illness episodes and deaths and that the decision of whether to initiate a vaccine program should be based on measures or estimates of public health effectiveness rather than only on protective efficacy. Studies of protective efficacy are of course critical to establish the vaccine's biologic activity, but additional aspects of public health effectiveness are also crucial in making these decisions. First-generation vaccines are available against typhoid, cholera, and soon rotavirus diarrhea, and vaccines against enterotoxigenic E. coli diarrhea and shigellosis are under development. The problems related to enteric diseases are enormous; the vaccines may soon be produced at low cost and promise to be relatively more easy to distribute than most previous vaccines. The number of illnesses and deaths averted from vaccine programs are potentially great. Pilot programs using the new vaccines should urgently be considered in areas where the disease burden is high, and steps should be taken to monitor effectiveness of the intervention in these programs. Such studies of vaccine effectiveness and costs in a "real world" situation are an essential step of the research process and should be used to guide the organization of larger-scale programs. Finally, many of the necessary research and development activities relevant to public health vaccinology must address country-specific problems. Developing countries should consider the role of vaccine-related research among the priorities for their essential national health research and build the necessary capabilities in applied and basic medical sciences and in the social sciences. 
Determination of growth fraction in advanced prostate cancer by Ki-67 immunostaining and its relationship to the time to tumor progression after hormonal therapy. Reliable predictors of response for prostate cancer patients undergoing hormonal therapy are lacking. This study investigates the possibility that tumor proliferation rates might predict tumor behavior for these patients. The growth fraction of metastatic prostate cancer biopsy specimens obtained before androgen withdrawal therapy was evaluated by Ki-67 antibody immunohistochemical study to determine whether a higher tumor growth fraction was associated with a shorter time to tumor progression after therapy. The percentage of Ki-67-positive malignant epithelial nuclei in the primary tumors of 17 patients ranged from 1.7% to 7.5% (median, 2.5%). When patients were divided into two response groups according to the median time to progression, poor responders (time to progression less than 20 months) and good responders (greater than or equal to 20 months) had similar growth fractions (3.5 +/- 0.5% versus 3.1 +/- 0.6% Ki-67-positive nuclei, respectively). However, when patients were divided into two groups based on the median growth fraction, patients with a high growth fraction (greater than 2.5% Ki-67-positive nuclei) tended to have a shorter time to progression (median, 10 months) than patients with a low (less than 2.5%) growth fraction (median time to progression, 25 months), although statistical significance was not reached. Despite this interesting trend, Ki-67 immunostaining was not accurate to predict the time to progression in individual patients undergoing hormonal therapy. Reliable prediction of growth rates may require measurement of both cell proliferation and cell death rates. 
Donor hearts with impaired hemodynamics. Benefit of warm substrate-enriched blood cardioplegic solution for induction of cardioplegia during cardiac harvesting. Brain-dead donors frequently show circulatory deterioration and often require so much inotropic support that the donor heart is of questionable value. This experimental study quantifies the cardiac metabolic consequences of brain death and the role of warm blood cardioplegic solution for induction of cardioplegia to improve the quality of potential donor hearts with impaired hemodynamics. Twelve dogs were subjected to brain death by interrupting cerebral blood flow (ligation of innominate artery, carotid arteries, and superior vena cava) and were followed up for as long as 6 hours. Each showed progressive hemodynamic deterioration, necessitating inotropic support (dopamine, calcium, and epinephrine) and large amounts of volume replacement (hetastarch; Hespan) to support the circulation (maintain mean arterial blood pressure greater than 60 mm Hg). Biopsy specimens were taken after 6 hours, or when irreversible ventricular fibrillation occurred, and were analyzed for adenosine triphosphate, creatine phosphate, glycogen, glutamate, and lactate. In six dogs the aorta was then clamped, and a 10-minute infusion of warm (37 degrees C) substrate-enriched aspartate/glutamate blood cardioplegic solution (with the dog's own blood) was given by roller pump to simulate warm induction during the harvesting process. Biopsies were then repeated. Myocardial metabolism, expressed as percent of control values, during brain death was characterized by the following: (1) moderate energy depletion (adenosine triphosphate fell 25% +/- 8%, creatine phosphate fell 55% +/- 15%; p less than 0.05 versus control: mean +/- standard error of the mean); (2) substrate depletion (tissue glutamate fell 48% +/- 9.5%, glycogen fell 66% +/- 7.5%; p less than 0.05 versus control: mean +/- standard error of the mean); and (3) evidence of anaerobic metabolism (lactate increased 374% +/- 95%; p less than 0.05 versus control: mean +/- standard error of the mean). Warm induction of blood cardioplegia in these energy- and substrate-depleted ischemic hearts showed (1) return of creatine phosphate levels to normal (113% +/- 16.8%), (2) replenishment of glutamate (201% +/- 24% of control; p less than 0.05 versus control: mean +/- standard error of the mean), and (3) 43% +/- 14% reduction in myocardial lactate content; (p less than 0.05 versus brain-dead animals). These data suggest that brain-dead donors requiring inotropic support sustain energy and substrate depletion and ischemic damage that can be reversed by a brief period of induction of cardioplegia with a warm substrate-enriched blood cardioplegic solution before harvesting.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS). 
Hepatic perfusion index (HPI) in mesenteric angina and following successful revascularization. This is a case report of a 45 year old man who had previously undergone a small bowel resection for acute mesenteric ischaemia. He subsequently suffered from mesenteric angina due to stenosis of the origin of the superior mesenteric artery and intermittent claudication due to aorto-iliac atheroma. The patient underwent a successful aorto-bifemoral Y graft and small bowel revascularization with a saphenous vein graft between the Y graft and the accessible proximal portion of the superior mesenteric artery. Before vascular reconstruction, the hepatic perfusion indices (HPI) in both the fasted and fed states were elevated; after mesenteric revascularization the HPI values were substantially lowered. The hepatic perfusion index may, by demonstrating functional abnormality, be useful in the diagnosis of mesenteric ischaemia and also in the assessment of treatment. Further evaluation of HPI in patients with suspected mesenteric ischaemia is therefore required. 
Treatment with recombinant human tumor necrosis factor-alpha protects rats against the lethality, hypotension, and hypothermia of gram-negative sepsis. Tumor necrosis factor (TNF) is a peptide secreted by macrophages in response to endotoxin that can produce many of the changes seen in septic shock. After cecal ligation and puncture (CLP) rats gradually develop tachycardia, hypotension, tachypnea, and hypothermia. At 5 h post-CLP, rats have a peak in serum levels of endotoxin and 60% of rats have blood cultures that grow Gram-negative rods (Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumonia). At 20 h post-CLP all rats develop positive blood cultures. Serum levels of TNF are not reproducibly measurable in rats following CLP. Rats undergoing CLP have a 50-80% mortality with deaths usually occurring 24-72 h postinjury. Repetitive (twice daily x 6 d) i.p. injection of sublethal doses of recombinant human TNF-alpha (100 micrograms/kg) to rats undergoing CLP 1 d after the treatment period resulted in a significant reduction in mortality compared to control rats previously unexposed to rTNF (P less than 0.03). Animals treated with rTNF had no hypotension or hypothermia after CLP and regained normal food intake faster than control rats. 12 h after CLP the gene expression for manganous superoxide dismutase (MnSOD), an inducible mitochondrial metalloenzyme responsible for cellular resistance to injury from toxic reactive oxygen species, was higher in livers of rats treated with rTNF suggesting that the TNF treatment augmented expression of this protective enzyme. Unlike MnSOD, expression of the gene for copper-zinc SOD was not affected by CLP or rTNF treatment. The results suggest that prior treatment with recombinant TNF can ameliorate the lethality, hypotension, hypothermia, and anorexia of Gram-negative sepsis in rats and that the mechanism may be related to enhanced hepatic expression of the gene for MnSOD. Repeated administration of recombinant TNF may be a strategy to minimize mortality and morbidity of Gram-negative sepsis. 
Adequate crystalloid resuscitation restores but fails to maintain the active hepatocellular function following hemorrhagic shock. Studies have shown that active hepatocellular function is depressed early after trauma-hemorrhage and persists despite resuscitation with two or three times (x) the volume of maximum bleedout (MB) with lactated Ringer's solution (LR). However, it is not known if a larger volume of fluid resuscitation corrects this dysfunction. To study this, rats were bled to and maintained at a mean arterial pressure of 40 mm Hg until 40% of the MB volume was returned in the form of LR, and then resuscitated with 4x or 5x the volume of MB with LR. Three doses of indocyanine green (ICG) were given intravenously and [ICG] measured in vivo using an in-vivo hemoreflectometer. The initial velocity of the clearance of ICG was calculated. Maximal velocity of the clearance (Vmax: the number of functional ICG receptors) and kinetic constant (Km: the efficiency of the active transport) were determined from the Lineweaver-Burk plot. Vmax decreased during hemorrhage, was restored to control levels at 0-4 hours after resuscitation, but decreased at 4-8 hours after resuscitation despite restoration of cardiac output following resuscitation with 5x LR. This could be the result of increased TNF release. The Km also decreased during hemorrhage, but increased at 0-1.5 hours and remained at control levels even 4-8 hours after resuscitation. Thus the failure of Vmax to remain at control levels following adequate fluid resuscitation may form the basis of cellular dysfunction and multiple organ failure after severe hemorrhagic shock. 
Analyses of 200 lymphadenectomies in patients with penile carcinoma. From 1972 to 1987, 200 consecutive lymphadenectomies were performed in 112 patients with squamous cell carcinoma of the penis. A Gibson incision provided exposure of the iliac and inguinal lymph nodes with a low morbidity rate (5% flap necrosis, 15% wound infection, 16% lymphedema and 9% lymphocele). The controversy surrounding the necessity of iliac lymphadenectomy is discussed, since 305 iliac lymph nodes examined did not have metastatic invasion. 
Peripheral white blood cell counts and bacterial meningitis: implications regarding diagnostic efficacy in febrile children. In order to investigate the clinical value of peripheral white blood cell variables for the diagnosis of bacterial meningitis among young, febrile children, we compared total peripheral white counts, total segmented neutrophil counts, total band counts, and the ratio of immature-to-total neutrophils (I:T ratio) among 46 children with bacterial meningitis, 130 children with aseptic meningitis, and 56 febrile children with culture confirmed extrameningeal bacterial infection. Children with bacterial meningitis were comparable to those with aseptic meningitis with respect to median total white blood cell counts and median total segmented neutrophil counts but had a significantly higher median total band count (1760/microliters vs 378/microliters, P = 0.0001) and a significantly higher median I:T ratio (0.40 vs 0.09, P less than 0.001). In contrast, children with bacterial meningitis were comparable to those with an extrameningeal bacterial infection with respect to median total band count but had a significantly lower median total peripheral white count (10,650/microliters vs 15,300/microliters, P = 0.0013), a lower median total segmented neutrophil count (4511/microliters vs 6796/microliters, P = 0.023), and a significantly higher median I:T ratio (0.40 vs 0.15, P less than 0.001). Children with meningitis who were bacteremic at presentation had a significantly lower total white cell count (P = 0.001) and significantly higher I:T ratio (P = 0.005) when compared with children who had an extrameningeal infection and concurrent bacteremia at presentation. 
Pancreatic-portal vein fistula with disseminated fat necrosis treated by pancreaticoduodenectomy. I have reported the case of a 62-year-old man with chronic alcoholic pancreatitis and a rare pseudocyst-portal vein fistula. Even though he experienced no abdominal symptoms, he had severe metastatic fat necrosis manifested as subcutaneous fat necrosis, polyarthritis, medullary bone necrosis, and mental status changes. Remote tissue destruction continued until relief was gained by pancreaticoduodenectomy and repair of the necrotic portal vein. Disseminated fat necrosis is a rare syndrome that can be the only presenting feature in patients with pancreatitis and pancreatic cancer. Early recognition and treatment of the underlying pancreatic disease may decrease the high morality rate associated with this syndrome. 
The use of intraaortic balloon pumping as an adjunct to reperfusion therapy in acute myocardial infarction. The Thrombolysis and Angioplasty in Myocardial Infarction (TAMI) Study Group. To assess the risk and possible benefits of use of the percutaneous IABP in patients given thrombolytic therapy as treatment for acute myocardial infarction, we prospectively evaluated 810 consecutive patients entered into the TAMI trials. During hospitalization the 85 patients treated with the IABP had more cardiac risk factors, were slightly older (58 vs 56 years), and more often had anterior infarction (62% vs 38%). At acute cardiac catheterization, patients treated with the IABP also had more multivessel coronary disease (67% vs 43%), more frequent TIMI grade 0 or 1 flow (44% vs 28%), lower global ejection fraction (40% vs 52%), and worse regional infarct (-3.2 vs -2.5 SD/chord) and noninfarct (-0.67 vs +0.36 SD/chord) zone function. Although mortality rates (32% vs 4%) and in-hospital complications were greater in patients treated with the IABP, a greater improvement in global (delta ejection fraction: +1.9% vs +0.7%) and noninfarct zone (delta SD/chord: +0.11 vs -0.09) left ventricular function was observed in patients treated with the IABP at 1-week follow-up angiography. In addition, no reinfarction or reocclusion of the infarct-related artery occurred while patients were being treated with the IABP. These results suggest that the IABP may have a specific role after thrombolytic therapy in treating patients at high risk for reocclusion or at high risk for hemodynamic deterioration because of large infarction or critical stenoses in coronary vessels supplying the noninfarct zone. 
Chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyradiculoneuropathy of childhood: treatment with high-dose intravenous immunoglobulin. We treated four children with chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyradiculoneuropathy (CIDP) with high-dose intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG). All patients received 400 mg/kg of IVIG a day for 5 days during relapses, and one patient received additional periodic infusions of 400 mg/kg. All patients showed excellent recovery of motor strength following each relapse that was treated with IVIG. Compared with plasmapheresis (which was used to treat relapses earlier), recovery of function with IVIG treatments was similar, and in two patients it was superior, to plasmapheresis. There were no side effects with IVIG treatments as compared with plasmapheresis with which two children had infection of central lines with Staphylococcus epidermidis, one had profuse bleeding from accidental extrusion of a central line, and one had multiple episodes of major venous thromboses. High-dose IVIG was a safe and effective adjunctive therapy for childhood CIDP in these four patients. 
Postoperative computed tomography three months after lumbar disc surgery. A prospective single-blind study. In a prospective single-blind study, 60 patients surgically treated for lumbar disc herniation underwent clinical examination and computed tomography preoperatively and 3 months after surgery. At follow-up (58 patients; median, 31 months; range, 21-37 months), 29 patients had an excellent outcome (51%), 20 improved (33%), and 9 were unchanged or worse (16%). Dural or radicular scar tissue was present by computed tomography in 88% of the patients, but the findings could not be correlated with the clinical outcome. Recurrent or persistent disc herniation was found in 9% of the patients. The clinical outcome of patients with abnormal computed tomography did not differ significantly from patients without this finding. A relation between facet joint degeneration and less successful clinical outcome was demonstrated. Computed tomography (without contrast) 3 months after surgery gave little information which could be correlated with the clinical outcome. Patients with an excellent outcome had all degrees of intraspinal scar tissue. 
Fragile X genotype characterized by an unstable region of DNA. DNA sequences have been located at the fragile X site by in situ hybridization and by the mapping of breakpoints in two somatic cell hybrids that were constructed to break at the fragile site. These hybrids were found to have breakpoints in a common 5-kilobase Eco RI restriction fragment. When this fragment was used as a probe on the chromosomal DNA of normal and fragile X genotype individuals, alterations in the mobility of the sequences detected by the probe were found only in fragile X genotype DNA. These sequences were of an increased size in all fragile X individuals and varied within families, indicating that the region was unstable. This probe provides a means with which to analyze fragile X pedigrees and is a diagnostic reagent for the fragile X genotype. 
Treatment of bilateral intrahepatic stones with high duct strictures through selective central hepatic resection. Bilateral intrahepatic duct stones with strictures, more common in the Orient than elsewhere, are difficult to access surgically. The results of surgical procedures have not been generally successful and are attended by a high postoperative complication and recurrence rate. We report the treatment of 30 patients with intrahepatic calculi and high duct strictures by means of selective central hepatic resection without dissection of the major vessels at the hilum. Central hepatic resection provided satisfactory access to the primary and secondary confluences of the intrahepatic ducts, allowed removal of residual stones and ascariasis, and permitted correction of multiple strictures. Twenty-nine patients so treated were followed for a mean of 32 months after operation. No patients developed recurrent fever, biliary colic, or jaundice after the operation. The technique is therefore recommended as an effective alternative to extensive hepatic lobectomy in the treatment of the intrahepatic calculi with multiple strictures. 
Carcinoma and DNA aneuploidy in Crohn's colitis--a histological and flow cytometric study. Twenty four patients with longstanding colonic Crohn's disease were examined prospectively with colonoscopy and multiple biopsy sampling in order to detect histological dysplasia or abnormal aneuploid DNA content, or both. Biopsy specimens were taken from 10 predetermined locations in the colon and rectum. No patient had definite dysplasia but three displayed DNA aneuploidy (12.5%), and one of these subsequently developed a carcinoma (Dukes' C at operation) in the ascending colon. No concomitant dysplasia was detected but the carcinoma as well as other parts of the mucosa were DNA aneuploid. It is concluded that dysplasia is rare in patients with Crohn's colitis, but findings of DNA aneuploidy warrant vigilance in follow up as this may indicate impending carcinoma. Further prospective studies are needed before the predictive value of DNA aneuploidy can be determined and before general recommendations of colonoscopic surveillance, as in longstanding ulcerative colitis, can be made. 
Neonatal schizencephaly: comparison of brain imaging. Schizencephaly is a regional disturbance of cerebral hemisphere formation occurring at 3-5 months gestation; neonatal presentation is uncommon. Three neonates with schizencephaly were evaluated with cranial ultrasonography (US), unenhanced computed tomography (CT), and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) examinations. Common findings in US, CT, and MRI include parasylvian and midline clefts, size asymmetries of the basal ganglia and thalamus, cerebral parenchymal volume loss, ventriculomegaly, ventricular diverticula, and absence of the septum pellucidum. MRI and CT were superior to US in detecting calcification, gyral and sulcal abnormalities, and parasylvian clefts. MRI alone demonstrated homolateral absence of the sylvian vasculature, small medullary pyramids, low position of the fornix, and the thinning of the corpus callosum. Although US appears adequate as a screening test, MRI best defines the precise pathoanatomic findings of neonatal schizencephaly and allows for the prediction of neurologic outcomes in affected newborns. 
Surgical treatment of peptic ulcer disease. Elective surgery for peptic ulcer disease has diminished significantly over the past 15 years. However, emergency surgery has not shown a decline. Some series have even reported an increase in hospitalizations and operations for hemorrhage. The appropriate surgical procedure for peptic ulcer disease must be tailored to the specific needs of the individual patient. During emergency operations for hemorrhage from duodenal ulcer, we recommend suture ligature of the bleeding vessel and vagotomy-pyloroplasty for high-risk patients, or vagotomy-antrectomy for the lower-risk patient. Bleeding gastric ulcers should be resected, if possible. For massive hemorrhage from stress ulceration requiring surgery, near-total or total gastrectomy should be performed. Perforated duodenal ulcers are best managed by closure and a definitive ulcer operation, such as vagotomy-pyloroplasty. Perforated gastric ulcers are best excised but may be simply closed if conditions do not favor resection. In these situations, biopsy should be performed. We recommend truncal vagotomy-antrectomy for patients presenting with obstruction. Vagotomy (truncal or proximal gastric) with drainage is an acceptable alternative in this situation. For patients with intractable ulcer disease or for those who are noncompliant, proximal gastric vagotomy is the preferred operation. However, other operations may need to be considered, depending on the specific situation. Recurrent ulceration needs appropriate work-up to determine the possible cause. Although patients with ulcer recurrence initially may be placed on medical treatment, about 50% will require reoperation. The most effective procedure for peptic ulcer disease is truncal vagotomy-antrectomy, which has a recurrence rate of less than 1%. The procedure with the least morbidity and the fewest undesirable side effects is proximal gastric vagotomy. Ulcer recurrence after proximal gastric vagotomy or truncal vagotomy-pyloroplasty is in the range of 10% to 15%. 
Interstitial delivery of dexamethasone in the brain for the reduction of peritumoral edema. Controlled-release polymers have facilitated the interstitial delivery of drugs within the central nervous system. In the present study, dexamethasone was incorporated into ethylene-vinyl acetate polymers, which were then implanted adjacent to a 9L gliosarcoma in the brain of Fischer 344 rats. The effect of interstitial delivery of dexamethasone on peritumoral edema was assessed and compared to the effect of dexamethasone delivered systemically. Eighty-five rats underwent intracranial implantation of the 9L gliosarcoma. Five days later, the animals were randomly assigned to one of four treatment groups: Group 1 received intracranial implantation of controlled-release polymers containing dexamethasone; Group 2 received intraperitoneal implantation of controlled-release polymers containing dexamethasone; Group 3 received serial intraperitoneal injections of dexamethasone; and Group 4 received sham treatment. The animals were sacrificed 3 days after initiation of therapy and their brains were removed for measurement of the water content (edema) in the tumor-bearing and contralateral hemispheres. Brain and plasma samples were analyzed by reverse-phase high-performance liquid chromatography to determine the tissue and plasma concentrations of dexamethasone. Measurement of the release kinetics of dexamethasone from the ethylene-vinyl acetate polymers in an in vitro system showed that the drug was released in a controlled, tapering fashion. During the first 3 days of controlled release in vitro, 330 micrograms of a total content of 7.5 mg of dexamethasone was released into the medium. Analysis of tissue for drug levels demonstrated, however, that the interstitial delivery of this fractional amount of dexamethasone within the brain resulted in levels 19 times higher than those achieved by administering the full dose of 7.5 mg systemically over a 3-day period. Conversely, the systemic administration of dexamethasone resulted in plasma levels 16 times higher than those measured in the interstitial delivery of dexamethasone in the brain. Brain-water content determinations showed that the interstitial controlled release of the fractional amount of dexamethasone within the brain was as effective in controlling peritumoral edema as systemic administration of the full dose by serial intraperitoneal injections. The study demonstrates the following: 1) controlled-release polymeric carriers deliver biologically active dexamethasone in a sustained fashion; 2) very high concentrations of dexamethasone in brain tissue can be achieved using interstitial polymer-mediated drug delivery while minimizing plasma concentrations of this drug which are sometimes associated with serious systemic side effects; and 3) peritumoral brain edema can be effectively treated by the interstitial delivery of dexamethasone directly within the tumor bed. 
Thromboprophylaxis in patients with hip fractures: a prospective, randomized, comparative study between Org 10172 and dextran 70. A prospective, randomized, assessor-blind trial has been undertaken to compare the thromboprophylactic effect and safety of the heparinoid Org 10172 (a mixture of low molecular-weight sulfated glycosaminoglycuronides) and dextran 70 in patients operated on for hip fracture. Prestudy biostatistical calculations led to the need for 260 patients. Three hundred eight patients were randomized and 19 were excluded after randomization, the majority because of postponed surgery. Analyses were made on the 289 patients on an intention-to-treat basis, as well as on the 247 patients given correct prophylaxis. Diagnosis of deep vein thrombosis was based on bilateral ascending phlebography on postoperative days 10 through 12. The frequency of deep vein thrombosis on an intention-to-treat basis was 10% in the Org 10172 group and 30% in the dextran 70 group and, on the basis of correct prophylaxis, 12% and 31%, respectively, both differences being significant (p less than 0.001). Two-month mortality rates were equal in the groups. Three fatal pulmonary emboli were seen in the dextran group. Significantly more patients in the dextran group received postoperative transfusions; no other differences in various hemorrhagic parameters were seen. Thus it can be concluded that Org 10172 has a significantly better thromboprophylactic effect than does dextran in patients with hip fractures without significant side effects. 
Early combination of selegiline and low-dose levodopa as initial symptomatic therapy in Parkinson's disease. Experience in 26 patients receiving combined therapy for 26 months. Thirty-eight patients newly diagnosed as having Parkinson's disease (mean age, 57.3 years; mean Parkinson's disease duration, 2.7 years) in the earlier phase of the disease (mean Hoehn/Yahr stage, 2; mean motor scores, 11.4) were given selegiline (Deprenyl), 10 mg daily, and maintained on this drug alone until significant clinical worsening warranted the addition of low-dose levodopa (Sinemet, 25/100 three to four doses per day). Five of these patients were not yet receiving additional levodopa despite some worsening of motor scores. Of the 33 patients now taking combined therapy, seven have been followed up for 6 months or less. Twenty-four (92%) of the 26 patients taking combined therapy for a mean of 26 months (8.5 to 99 months) who have had Parkinson's disease for 6 years showed a dramatic improvement in their parkinsonism shortly after the addition of levodopa, with significant decreases in their rated motor scores, such improvement being maintained at their latest neurologic evaluation. Eighteen (75%) of these 24 patients responded to the combined selegiline/levodopa therapy with degrees of improvement equal to or greater than 50%, compared with their motor status at the start of combined therapy just before the addition of levodopa. This degree of "reversal" of parkinsonism on addition of levodopa (mean carbidopa/levodopa dose, 98/389 mg) was not observed in any of these same patients receiving selegiline alone for an average of 13.8 months. Four patients taking combined therapy developed mild, transient, abnormal involuntary movements, and end-of-dose pattern of response after more than 2 years of combined therapy (24.75 and 33.5 months, respectively). 
Rotavirus surveillance--United States, 1989-1990. Rotavirus infection is the most common cause of dehydrating diarrhea in children in the United States. In January 1989, CDC established a National Rotavirus Surveillance System (NRSS) to monitor national patterns in the epidemiology of rotavirus. This report summarizes findings from the NRSS from January 1989 through November 1990. 
Massive incisional hernia: abdominal wall replacement with Marlex mesh. Marlex (polypropylene) mesh was used to replace the abdominal wall in massive incisional herniation in 50 patients. Seventeen unsuccessful attempts at primary repair had previously been made on nine patients. Patient follow-up ranged from 6 to 120 months (mean = 45 months). There was minor hernia recurrence in four (8 per cent) patients. In each instance it was due to partial detachment of the peripheral fixation of the patch. Complications were: wound infection, four (8 per cent); wound seroma, two (4 per cent); wound haematoma, one (2 per cent); and wound sinus, six (12 per cent). Complications did not necessitate removal of the patch in any case. Inadequate peripheral attachment of the patch has been the only cause of hernia recurrence and should be avoidable. 
Palliation of proximal malignant biliary obstruction by endoscopic endoprosthesis insertion. For four years up to December 1987, 190 patients (median age 73 years) with proximal malignant biliary obstruction were treated by endoscopic endoprosthesis insertion. Altogether 101 had cholangiocarcinoma, 21 gall bladder carcinoma, 20 local spread of pancreatic carcinoma, and 48 metastatic malignancy. Fifty eight patients had type I, 54 type II, and 78 type III proximal biliary strictures (Bismuth classification). All patients were either unfit or unsuitable for an attempt at curative surgical resection. A single endoprosthesis was placed initially, with a further stent being placed only if relief of cholestasis was insufficient or sepsis developed in undrained segments. The combined percutaneous-endoscopic technique was used to place the endoprosthesis when appropriate, after failed endoscopic endoprosthesis insertion or for second endoprosthesis placement. Full follow up was available in 97%.Thirteen patients were still alive at the time of review and all but one had been treated within the past six months. Initial endoprosthesis insertion succeeded technically at the first attempt in 127 patients, at the second in 30, and at a combined procedure in a further 13 (cumulative total success rate 89% - type I: 93%; type II: 94%; and type III: 84%). There was adequate biliary drainage after single endoprosthesis insertion in 152 of the 170 successful placements, giving an overall successful drainage rate of 80%. Three patients had a second stent placed by combined procedure because of insufficient drainage, giving an overall successful drainage rate of 82% (155 of 190). The final overall drainage success rates were type I: 91%; type II: 83%; and type III: 73%. The early complication rates were type I: 7%; type II: 14%; and type III: 31%. 
Reactivity of proximal and distal angiographically normal and stenotic coronary segments in chronic stable angina pectoris. To assess whether vasoreactivity of significant coronary stenosis (greater than 50% intraluminal diameter reduction) and that of angiographically normal coronary segments differs in proximal and distal locations, 53 patients (40 men, 13 women, mean +/- standard deviation age 55 +/- 11 years) with chronic stable angina and angiographically documented coronary artery disease were studied. While abstaining from antianginal therapy, all 53 patients underwent coronary arteriography before and after 1 mg of intracoronary isosorbide dinitrate and 21 of the 53 also before and after 20 to 30 micrograms intracoronary ergonovine. Computerized quantitative angiography was used to assess changes in the intraluminal diameter of 126 normal coronary segments (63 proximal, 63 distal) and 43 significant coronary stenoses. Nitrates dilated proximal normal coronary segments by 7.4 +/- 1.2% and distal normal coronary segments by 15 +/- 1.7% (p less than 0.01). Significant proximal coronary stenoses dilated by 11 +/- 2.5% and distal stenoses by 23 +/- 2.8% (p less than 0.01) after nitrates. Ergonovine reduced the diameter of proximal normal coronary segments by 9.3 +/- 1.7% and that of normal distal segments by 15.5 +/- 1.4% (p less than 0.01). Proximal stenoses constricted by 11 +/- 2.2% and distal stenoses by 18.4 +/- 2.8% (p = 0.06). Analysis of segments showed that nitrates dilated 19 of 63 (30%) proximal normal segments by (greater than or equal to 10%), 31 of 63 (49%) distal (p less than 0.05) and 21 of 43 (49%) stenoses. 
Endometrial thickness after menopause: effect of hormone replacement Ultrasound (US) images of the pelvis were evaluated in 112 asymptomatic postmenopausal women to investigate the normal range of endometrial thickness (double-layer measurement) and the effect of hormone replacement on these measurements. Twenty-one patients (19%) had endometrial thickness greater than 0.8 cm. One patient, with an endometrial thickness of 2.5 cm, had endometrial carcinoma. Consideration of the known actions of estrogen and progestogen on the endometrium led the authors to believe that the clinical significance of an endometrium measuring more than 0.8 cm depends on the patient's hormonal status. Among asymptomatic postmenopausal women with an endometrial thickness between 0.8 and 1.5 cm, those receiving unopposed estrogen or continuous estrogen and progestogen need to undergo dilatation and curettage (D&C) or biopsy and those receiving no hormones or receiving sequential estrogen and progestogen should be encouraged to undergo D&C or biopsy. If a patient in one of the latter two groups is unwilling to undergo an invasive procedure, then US examination at 3-month intervals is acceptable. Any patient with endometrial thickness of at least 1.5 cm should undergo histologic diagnosis, regardless of symptoms or hormone status. 
Lineage-restricted clonality in biphasic solid tumors. Cytogenetic analysis of two pulmonary chondroid hamartomas and nine breast adenofibromas revealed clonal chromosome aberrations in both hamartomas and in four breast tumors. To determine lineage of the cells with chromosome aberrations, a combined immunohistochemical/cytogenetic approach was developed that enabled simultaneous ascertainment of cytogenetic aberrations and immunohistochemical features in individual cells. Immunohistochemical/cytogenetic evaluation of one hamartoma and two adenofibromas demonstrated that neoplastic proliferation, in each case, was confined to the mesenchymal (stromal) component, whereas epithelial cells appeared to be reactive. Cytogenetically abnormal short-term cultures of the remaining hamartoma and another of the breast adenofibromas were composed entirely of mesenchymal elements, indicating mesenchymal clonality in those tumors as well. Our findings support redesignation of pulmonary chondroid hamartomas as 'pulmonary chondromas' and suggest that carcinomas developing within fibroadenomas arise from reactive epithelial proliferation. Combined immunohistochemical/cytogenetic analysis might be useful in the development of novel therapeutic approaches that selectively target neoplastic populations within solid tumors. 
Intravascular streaming during carotid artery infusions. Demonstration in humans and reduction using diastole-phased pulsatile administration. Intra-arterial carotid artery chemotherapy for malignant gliomas is limited by focal injuries to the eye and brain which may be caused by poor mixing of the drug with blood at the infusion site. This inadequate mixing can be eliminated in animal models with diastole-phased pulsatile infusion (DPPI) which creates 1-ml/sec spurts during the slow blood flow phase of diastole. Before treatment with intracarotid cisplatin, 10 patients with malignant gliomas were studied to determine whether intravascular streaming occurs after intracarotid infusion in humans, and if so, if it is reduced with DPPI. Regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) studies were performed by intravenous injection of H2(15)O and positron emission tomography. This was followed by supra- or infraophthalmic internal carotid artery (ICA) injections of H2(15)O with either continuous infusion or DPPI. Local H2(15)O concentration in the brain was determined and the images of radiotracer distribution in the continuous infusion and DPPI studies were compared to the rCBF images. Intravascular streaming of the infusate was identified by a heterogeneous distribution of the infused H2(15)O in brain compared to rCBF. Extensive and variable intravascular streaming occurred in three patients who received infusions into the supraophthalmic segment of the ICA. Some brain areas received up to 11 times the expected radiotracer delivery, while other regions received as little as one-tenth. This streaming pattern was markedly reduced or eliminated by DPPI. In the five patients who received infraophthalmic infusions, a minimally heterogeneous distribution of the infusate was detected. The authors conclude that extensive intravascular streaming accompanies supraophthalmic ICA infusions in patients. The magnitude of streaming can be substantially reduced or eliminated with DPPI. Those who perform intra-arterial infusion should consider using DPPI to assure uniform drug delivery to brain. 
Experimental superficial siderosis of the central nervous system. I. Morphological observations. Autologous washed red blood cells were injected weekly over a period of three to six months into the cisterna magna of adult New Zealand white rabbits. After three months, the surface of the brain stem, cerebellum, and piriform cortex showed a distinct brown color, and staining of the gross specimens for iron produced an intense blue color which extended for a distance of 1-2 mm into the brain parenchyma. Enhanced iron stains of vibratome sections revealed the accumulation of reaction product in microglia and Bergmann glia of the cerebellar cortex, and in microglia and astrocytes of the piriform cortex. Ferritin immunocytochemistry revealed reaction product in cerebellar microglia and Bergmann glia which strongly resembled that obtained by the enhanced iron stain. In the piriform cortex, only microglia were reactive with anti-ferritin. Electron microscopy confirmed the accumulation of electron-dense ferritin granules only in the cytoplasm of microglia. Bergmann glia in the cerebellum and astrocytic processes in the piriform cortex were replete with intermediate filaments and contained an excess of glycogen. After six months, small granules of hemosiderin began to appear in cerebellar and piriform cortices. The observations support that the sequence of conversion of hemoglobin to ferritin and hemosiderin occurs in brain as in other organs. 
Esophageal obstruction 14 years after treatment for Hodgkin's disease. The incidence of late radiation injury of the esophagus is not precisely determined but, overall, the occurrence of clinically apparent damage is infrequent. The authors report a complete esophageal obstruction in a 21-year-old man, 14 years after chemo-radiation therapy for Hodgkin's lymphoma. Although endoscopy failed to demonstrate a gross morphologic abnormality, an esophagogram detected abnormal peristalsis and stricture, and esophageal manometry coupled with dynamic isotopic study clearly demonstrated a multilevel secondary neuronal damage. Data in the literature suggest that alteration in motility is by far the most frequent radiologic manifestation. Further prospective studies will probably clarify the actual incidence of late esophageal damage after chemo-radiation therapy. 
Renal lesion characterization with gadolinium-enhanced MR imaging: efficacy and safety in patients with renal insufficiency. Five patients with renal insufficiency were studied with T1-weighted magnetic resonance (MR) imaging before and after intravenous administration of gadopentetate dimeglumine (0.1 mmol/kg) to characterize renal lesions that were detected with nonenhanced computed tomography (CT) and were considered indeterminate. Four patients demonstrated renal lesions that enhanced after gadolinium administration. A total of five lesions in these four patients were surgically resected and found to be renal cell carcinoma at pathologic examination. The fifth patient was spared surgery because a hyperattenuated lesion noted at nonenhanced CT did not enhance with intravenous gadolinium, indicating a benign cyst. Five incidentally occurring benign cysts removed at the time of nephrectomy in two of the patients did not demonstrate enhancement with gadolinium on MR images. Serial serum creatine levels were obtained before and after gadolinium administration in all patients; no changes were noted after gadolinium administration. Gadolinium-enhanced MR imaging is an effective method for characterizing renal lesions in patients with renal insufficiency. At the usual dosage, there appears to be no nephrotoxic reaction in these patients. 
Malignant colorectal polyps: venous invasion and successful treatment by endoscopic polypectomy. We reviewed the pathology of 81 malignant colorectal polyps in 80 patients treated by endoscopic polypectomy and assessed the importance of carcinomatous invasion of veins in the stalk (submucosa). All the patients were followed up for at least five years. Venous invasion was present in 30 of the polyps (37%). The histological features of lymphatic invasion were considered too subjective to be of value. Most of the tumours were well or moderately differentiated adenocarcinomas, one was poorly differentiated, and one was a signet ring cell carcinoma. Seventy one patients were treated by polypectomy alone, and 58 of these were alive and well five years later, with no evidence of recurrence. Nine died of unrelated causes within five years, but four died of carcinomatosis: one with recurrent tumour, one with a possible metachronous caecal cancer, and in two patients there was late development of malignancy of uncertain nature. The remaining nine patients underwent surgical resection after initial endoscopic polypectomy because of incompleteness of excision, poor differentiation of the tumour, or a decision by the surgeon. Tumour was not present in the resection specimens apart from a single lymph node deposit in the patient with signet ring cell carcinoma. These nine patients were alive and well without evidence of recurrence five years later. The results reemphasise the necessity of good cooperation between endoscopist and pathologist, meticulous laboratory technique, strict histopathological criteria including examination of resection margins and degree of differentiation of the tumour, and regular endoscopic follow up. 
Cachexia and tumour necrosis factor-alpha in cytomegalovirus infection. Although cachexia is a common feature of cytomegalovirus infection, little is known about its cause. To explore any contributory role that tumour necrosis factor-alpha (TNF) might have the serum concentrations of TNF in eight patients who developed CMV disease after liver transplantation were investigated. All patients exhibited pronounced and long lasting increases in TNF serum concentrations. Increased endogenous TNF concentrations were associated with weight loss and anorexia. In contrast, liver transplant recipients without CMV disease showed no weight loss. 
Transesophageal echocardiographic demonstration of distinct mechanisms for right to left shunting across a patent foramen ovale in the absence of pulmonary hypertension. The optimal visualization of the atrial septum and fossa ovalis by transesophageal echocardiography was utilized to demonstrate saline contrast transit across the atrial septum and to relate it to the motion of the flap valve (septum primum) of the fossa ovalis. In three cases, three distinct mechanisms of right to left interatrial shunting in the absence of right ventricular systolic hypertension were identified: 1) transient spontaneous reversal of the left to right atrial pressure differential with each cardiac cycle; 2) sustained elevation of right atrial pressure above left atrial pressure induced by respiratory maneuvers; and 3) aberrant flow redirection across the foramen ovale due to a large right atrial mass. Any of these three mechanisms may be operative during paradoxic embolism in the absence of elevation of right ventricular pressures. 
Scopolamine patch reduces postoperative emesis in paediatric patients following strabismus surgery. Scopolamine patch was evaluated for the prevention of postoperative emesis in 50 children undergoing strabismus surgery. All subjects were premedicated, with none receiving narcotic premedicants. Anaesthesia included controlled ventilation with the use of muscle relaxants, atropine, and halothane. Before operation, the subjects were randomly assigned to one of two groups: a treatment group received a scopolamine patch at a dose of either 0.75 mg or 0.375 mg, and a control group received no patch. Both the incidence and frequency of vomiting in the scopolamine-treated group were significantly (P less than 0.05) lower than in the control group. 
Enhanced immunoglobulin levels correlate with infectious complications after surgery in esophageal cancer. Severe septic complications account for the high mortality of patients with esophageal cancer. We examined the levels of immunoglobulins and complements together with infection-related complications in a large number of patients. Enhancements of IgG, IgA, C3, C4, and CH50 were evident in patients with esophageal cancer and were more predominant compared to findings in cases of gastric cancer. Average levels of IgG and IgA immediately before surgery were significantly higher in esophageal cancer patients with postoperative septic complications than in those without such problems. Preoperative radiation therapy and total parenteral nutrition did not significantly alter the levels of immunoglobulins and complements. It would thus appear that the enhancement of IgG and IgA is associated with the occurrence of infectious complications following surgery for patients with esophageal cancer. 
Exercise endurance and arterial desaturation in normobaric hypoxia with increased chemosensitivity. We studied whether exercise endurance under normobaric hypoxia can be enhanced by increasing hypoxic ventilatory sensitivity with almitrine bismesylate (ALM). On both ALM and placebo (PL) days, resting subjects breathed a hypoxic gas mixture (an inspired O2 fraction of 10.4-13.2%), which lowered resting arterial O2 saturation (SaO2) to 80%. After 15 min of rest there was a 3-min warm-up period of exercise at 50 W (light) on a cycle ergometer, followed by a step increase in load to 60% of the previously determined maximum power output with room-air breathing (moderate), which was maintained until exhaustion. With PL, SaO2 decreased rapidly with the onset of exercise and continued to fall slowly during moderate exercise, averaging 71.0 +/- 1.8% (SE) at exhaustion. With ALM, saturation did not differ from PL during air breathing but significantly exceeded SaO2 with PL, by 3.4% during resting hypoxia, by 4.0% at the start of exercise, and by 5.9% at exhaustion. Ventilation was not affected by ALM during air breathing and was slightly, although not significantly, increased during hypoxic rest and exercise. ALM was associated with an increased heart rate during room air breathing but not during hypoxia. Endurance time was 20.6 +/- 1.6 min with ALM and 21.3 +/- 0.9 min with PL. During hypoxic exercise, the potential benefit of greater saturation with ALM is apparently offset by other unidentified factors. 
Endoscopic sphincterotomy complications and their management: an attempt at consensus. Despite its relative safety (in comparison with surgery), and undoubted role in many clinical circumstances, biliary sphincterotomy is the most dangerous procedure routinely performed by endoscopists. Complications occur in about 10% of patients; 2 to 3% have a prolonged hospital stay, with a risk of dying. This document is an attempt to provide guidelines for prevention and management of complications, based on a workshop of selected experts, and a comprehensive review of the literature. We emphasize particularly the importance of specialist training, disinfection, drainage, and collaboration with surgical colleagues. 
Athletic participation after myocardial revascularization. Possibilities and benefits. Exercise after open heart operation is not only possible but highly desirable. Training increases the efficiency of exercise and therefore decreases myocardial work for any given level of activity. Even before sternal and incisional healing is complete the patient may become physically active. Almost every patient can improve his or her level of fitness safely by following simple guidelines. Exercise treadmill testing is the basis for assessing exercise capacity in cardiac patients. Upper-body exercise is not adequately emphasized in most exercise programs. 
Roles of muscularis mucosae and myofibroblasts in the healing process of acetic acid-induced ulcer. The changes in the localization of FITC-phalloidin-positive smooth muscle cells and interstitial cells were studied in control and acetic acid-treated rat fundic mucosa. In the control rats, the FITC-phalloidin-positive cells mostly corresponded to the smooth muscle cells of the muscularis mucosae, and the arteriolar and venular smooth muscle cells. On the other hand, 1 week after the acetic acid treatment, the fluorescence of the smooth muscle cells of the muscularis mucosae disappeared and a large number of fluorescent interstitial cells, probably corresponding to myofibroblasts, appeared in the regenerated mucosal layer. Three weeks after the application, severely thickened fluorescent muscularis mucosae were formed and the fluorescence of the interstitial cells was rather decreased. 
Infection of inbred rat strains with Rift Valley fever virus: development of a congenic resistant strain and observations on age-dependence of resistance. A congenic rat strain (WF.LEW) was derived from the susceptible Wistar-Furth (WF) (background strain) and the resistant LEW (donor strain) inbred strains and was used to evaluate the phenotypic expression of a dominant Mendelian gene that confers resistance to fatal hepatic disease caused by the ZH501 strain of Rift Valley fever virus (RVFV). Resistance to hepatic disease developed gradually with age, with full expression at approximately 10 weeks in the WF.LEW and LEW rat strains. The ZH501 strain caused fatal hepatitis in WF rats regardless of age. However, resistance to the SA75 RVFV strain (relatively non-pathogenic for adult rats), was age- and dose-dependent in both WF and LEW rats. The resistance gene transferred to the newly derived WF.LEW congenic rat strain appears to amplify age-dependent resistance of adult rats, resulting in protection against fatal hepatic disease caused by the virulent ZH501 strain. The congenic rat strain will be a valuable asset in elucidating the mechanism of resistance to Rift Valley fever virus governed by the dominant Mendelian gene. 
Diagnosis of cysticercosis in endemic regions. The Cysticercosis Working Group in Peru. Taenia solium cysticercosis is a frequent cause of neurological disease in developing countries. Specific diagnosis of cysticercosis is difficult. We obtained serum and/or CSF samples from 204 consecutive patients admitted to a neurological ward in Lima, Peru, and looked for antibodies specific for T solium with the enzyme-linked immunoelectrotransfer blot (EITB) assay. 21 (12%) of 173 serum samples from these patients were EITB-positive. In contrast, only 2 (1.5%) of 135 patients attending a public endoscopy clinic and 1 (1%) of 88 patients attending a private endoscopy clinic were seropositive. 1 (1%) of 98 pregnant women living in a Lima shanty town was EITB-positive. 15 (58%) of 26 neurology patients diagnosed clinically as having cysticercosis were seronegative. Routine screening by EITB of all patients with neurological symptoms from areas of endemic cysticercosis would avoid misdiagnosis of this common and treatable disease. 
Function of the diabetic retina after panretinal argon laser photocoagulation. Influence of the intensity of the coagulation spots. To investigate the influence of the intensity of coagulation spots on retinal function and the clinical course after panretinal argon laser photocoagulation in diabetic retinopathy, we conducted a prospective study in 24 eyes of 12 diabetics. One eye was treated with moderate spots (average: 300 mW), the fellow eye was coagulated with intense spots (average: 600 mW). The spot size was identical in both eyes. Subjective parameters (visual acuity, perimetry), as well as objective functions (ERG, EOG) and the clinical course, were studied preoperatively and on a regular base with a follow-up of 12 months. Visual acuity and fundus findings deteriorated less often in eyes coagulated with intense spots. Visual field loss, however, was more prevalent in eyes treated with intense spots. Early treatment complications only occurred with high-energy coagulation. For this reason, high-energy spots should not be used even though they might be indicated theoretically. 
Association of a precore genomic variant of hepatitis B virus with fulminant hepatitis. A variant of hepatitis B virus has been described recently in HBsAg+ Mediterranean patients who lack HBeAg and who have an unusual and severe form of chronic hepatitis. This variant is unable to produce HBeAg because of the presence of a novel translational stop codon at the end of the precore region of the genome. By direct sequencing of DNA, generated by the polymerase chain reaction, we have evaluated the association between infection with this variant and the fulminant course of hepatitis B. Eighteen patients with fulminant hepatitis B were studied. Of the 15 cases from whose serum viral DNA could be sequenced, the variant was found in the admission sera of 8 of 9 HBeAg- patients but in none of 6 HBeAg+ patients who had fulminant hepatitis B. Patients harboring the variant progressed more rapidly into hepatic encephalopathy, but those infected with the variant strain alone had a greater likelihood of survival than those infected with the normal strain or a mixture. The mutant strain may emerge spontaneously during fulminant hepatitis as occurs in chronic hepatitis B infection during seroconversion from HBeAg to antibody. Alternately, and perhaps less commonly, patients may be infected with the variant ab initio. 
Infectious and inflammatory processes of the spine. Infectious and inflammatory processes of the spinal column are discussed, including disc space infection, osteomyelitis, epidural abscess, arachnoiditis, and rheumatoid arthritis. The relative sensitivity and specificity of various imaging modalities, as well as the imaging characteristics and utility of these various modalities are given. Emphasis is placed on the use of magnetic resonance imaging. 
Intrathoracic osteosarcoma diagnosed by CT scan and pleural biopsy. Osteosarcoma rarely presents as a primary lesion in the chest, whereas pulmonary metastases are common. The diagnosis of primary intrathoracic osteosarcoma has invariably been by thoracotomy or autopsy. We present a case of a densely calcified, primary intrathoracic osteosarcoma where diagnosis was made antemortem by pleural biopsies and computed tomography scan. 
Diffuse mesangial sclerosis in a fetus. An 18-week fetus was born following termination of pregnancy by prostaglandin induction. Pregnancy was terminated because of elevated maternal serum alpha-fetoprotein and ultrasonographic evidence of severe oligohydramnios, intrauterine growth retardation, non-visualization of the bladder, dolichocephaly and possible mild hydrocephalus. Pathologic examination disclosed diffuse mesangial sclerosis and histologic evidence of the nephrotic syndrome. To our knowledge this is the first reported example of ante-natal diffuse mesangial sclerosis; of fetal congenital nephrosis other than Finnish type; and of fetal congenital nephrosis with prominent glomerular lesions. 
The zinc-reversible antimicrobial activity of neutrophil lysates and abscess fluid supernatants. There is some evidence to suggest that microbial growth inhibition may occur in chronic abscesses. A substance perhaps responsible for this phenomenon is calprotectin, a neutrophil cytoplasmic protein that inhibits microbial growth and that belongs to a class of proteins often having specific binding sites for zinc. In the present study, the suppressive effects of either human or mouse neutrophil lysates on Candida albicans growth were found to be completely reversed by micromolar quantities of zinc but not by iron or other trace elements. Similarly, supernatants of exudates from experimental abscesses in mice or from clinical specimens of abscesses in humans markedly inhibited the proliferation of C. albicans, and this effect was also completely reversed by zinc. A protein complex characteristic of calprotectin was identified in the abscess fluids. Preparations of the neutrophil growth-inhibiting protein, containing predominantly calprotectin, were shown to have zinc-binding activity by a dialysis technique. These findings suggest that the major mechanism of C. albicans growth inhibition by abscess fluids is through competition for zinc by a cytoplasmic protein apparently released from dying neutrophils. 
Acute atraumatic subdural hematoma associated with moyamoya disease in an African-American. A 57-year-old black woman with an atraumatic subdural hematoma was treated for congestive heart failure and was found to have moyamoya disease. The association of these two lesions is rare and has never been described in an African-American. High cerebral venous pressures and changes in cerebral perfusion caused by congestive heart failure and the loss of cerebrovascular autoregulation in moyamoya disease may explain the spontaneous occurrence of a subdural hematoma. Recommendations for management are discussed. 
Management of radionecrosis of the vulva and distal vagina. Twelve patients were seen between January 1983 and June 1989 with the clinical diagnosis of radionecrosis of the vulva or distal vagina. Seven patients received radiation for vulvar cancer, three for distal vaginal cancer, and two for recurrent endometrial cancer. No patient healed spontaneously and the mean delay in surgical therapy was 8.5 months. The radionecrotic site was treated with local therapy, radical local excision (with or without colostomy), or exenteration. The operative defect was closed primarily in three patients and covered with local flaps or myocutaneous flaps in seven patients. The two patients with local care still have radionecrotic ulcers. One of three patients who were closed primarily continues to have an ulcer. All other patients have healed satisfactorily except one who died after two attempts to correct the problem. Radionecrosis of the vulva and distal vagina should generally be treated surgically. 
Primary resection and anastomosis in obstructed descending colon due to cancer. Intraoperative colonic irrigation followed by one-stage resection is gaining popularity as the optimal surgical treatment for left-sided colonic obstruction. However, its efficacy and potential hazards have not been adequately tested in obstruction due to colonic cancer. We analyzed the early results of 23 consecutive patients with obstructive left-sided colonic carcinoma treated by primary resection and anastomosis following intraoperative antegrade colonic lavage. Two patients (8.6%) died, one from complication of anastomotic leakage. The significant postoperative complications were chest infection in three (13%) and wound infection in seven (30.4%). The average hospital stay was 16.5 days. The results of this study suggest that intraoperative bowel irrigation permits one-stage resection and anastomosis to be conducted with reasonable safety provided care is taken in operative techniques. 
Phacoemulsification combined with pars plana vitrectomy. Phacoemulsification combined with pars plana vitrectomy was performed on seven patients with both cataracts and vitreoretinal disease. Six of the seven had a posterior chamber intraocular lens (PC-IOL) placed in the capsular bag following cataract extraction. Visual acuities ranging from light perception to hand movement preoperatively, postoperatively ranged from hand movement to 20/25. There were no perioperative complications. During an average follow-up of more than 6 months, neovascular glaucoma developed in one patient, and a conjunctival cyst in another. The PC-IOLs were well tolerated. The small limbal incision used in phacoemulsification allows better control during the vitrectomy procedure and ensures a water-tight wound. In addition, with the limbal approach, the posterior lens capsule is maintained, with all the attendant advantages. 
A phase I trial of recombinant human interleukin-1 beta alone and in combination with myelosuppressive doses of 5-fluorouracil in patients with gastrointestinal cancer. We studied escalating doses of recombinant human interleukin-1 beta (IL-1 beta) alone and after a myelosuppressive dose of 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) in patients with gastrointestinal cancer. Transient neutropenia, monocytopenia, and lymphocytopenia were observed followed by a 1.3- to 6.0-fold (mean, 3.46-fold) dose-dependent neutrophil leukocytosis (P less than .00001) on the days of IL-1 beta administration. Increases in platelet counts were observed at a median of 14 days (range, 6 to 23) after IL-1 beta administration. Transient hypoglycemia, rebound hyperglycemia, elevations in serum cortisol, and C-reactive protein were observed. Side effects included fever, rigors, and headache in the majority of patients. Hypotension was observed in three of five patients at the highest dose level (0.1 micrograms/kg) and was dose-limiting. Fewer days of neutropenia were noted after 5-FU plus IL-1 beta than after 5-FU alone; however, this difference did not reach statistical significance. These data show that IL-1 beta has stimulatory effects in human hematopoiesis. 
Localization of the gene encoding the GABAA receptor beta 3 subunit to the Angelman/Prader-Willi region of human chromosome 15. Deletions of the proximal long arm of chromosome 15 (bands 15q11q13) are found in the majority of patients with two distinct genetic disorders, Angelman syndrome (AS) and Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS). The deleted regions in the two syndromes, defined cytogenetically and by using cloned DNA probes, are similar. However, deletions in AS occur on the maternally inherited chromosome 15, and deletions in PWS occur on the paternally derived chromosome 15. This observation has led to the suggestion that one or more genes in this region show differential expression dependent on parental origin (genetic imprinting). No genes of known function have previously been mapped to this region. We show here that the gene encoding the GABAA (gamma-aminobutyric acid) receptor beta 3 subunit maps to the AS/PWS region. Deletion of this gene (GABRB3) was found in AS and PWS patients with interstitial cytogenetic deletions. Evidence of beta 3 gene deletion was also found in an AS patient with an unbalanced 13;15 translocation but not in a PWS patient with an unbalanced 9;15 translocation. The localization of this receptor gene to the AS/PWS region suggests a possible role of the inhibitory neurotransmitter GABA in the pathogenesis of one or both of these syndromes. 
Sleep apnea in patients with acute myocardial infarction. OBJECTIVE: To document sleep apnea in the acute phase of myocardial infarction. If apnea occurs in patients with myocardial infarction, hypoxemia induced by apnea might exaggerate insufficiency of oxygen supplied to the damaged myocardium. DESIGN: Prospective controlled study. SETTING: Critical care unit of a teaching hospital. PATIENTS: Forty-nine patients, average age 64 yrs (range 49 to 91). MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Patient measurements were recorded on a polygraph using an apnea-monitor, pulse oximeter, pulmonary artery pressure monitor, and an ECG. All of the patients observed showed frequent apneic episodes. The apnea was especially frequent when the cardiac index was low. Capillary oxygen saturation of less than 90% (suggesting systemic hypoxia) was observed in 21 patients concomitantly with apnea. Occasionally, arrhythmias followed these episodes (premature supraventricular contractions [n = 10], premature ventricular contraction [n = 4], and ventricular tachycardia [n = 2]). CONCLUSIONS: This study suggests that sleep apnea is common in the setting of acute myocardial infarction. It may be a factor predisposing to, or even causing, sudden death in patients with acute phase of myocardial infarction. 
Choanal atresia and lymphedema. The coexistence of bilateral bony choanal atresia and lower-extremity lymphedema was observed in a family with several consanguineous marriages. The combination of these two rare anomalies, in a hereditary form, has not been described before. 
Clinical overview of management of chronic ischemic heart disease. The outcome of patients with chronic coronary artery disease is dependent on many factors; the most important ones include the severity and extent of coronary artery disease, state of left ventricular function at rest, extent and severity of myocardial ischemia, and the total amount of left ventricular myocardium that is at risk. To use noninvasive tests optimally, the clinician first must define the information needed. The sensitivity, specificity, and predictive accuracy of the test(s) in providing the necessary information, the additive value of the result of a test to the information already available, and the best combination of tests in providing the desired information help determine the choice of various noninvasive tests in a particular clinical circumstance. 
A regional prospective study of in-hospital mortality associated with coronary artery bypass grafting. The Northern New England Cardiovascular Disease Study Group. OBJECTIVE--A prospective regional study was conducted to determine if the observed differences in in-hospital mortality rates associated with coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) are solely the result of differences in patient case mix. DESIGN-Regional prospective cohort study. Data including patient demographic and historical data, body surface area, cardiac catheterization results, priority of surgery, comorbidity, and status at hospital discharge were collected. This study presents data for 3055 CABG patients between July 1, 1987, and April 15, 1989. SETTING--This study includes data from all surgeons performing cardiothoracic surgery in Maine, New Hampshire, and Vermont; the data were collected from five regional medical centers. PATIENTS--Data were collected from all consecutive isolated CABG surgery patients during the study period. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES--Crude and adjusted in-hospital mortality rates associated with CABG. MAIN RESULTS--The overall crude in-hospital mortality rate for isolated CABG was 4.3%. The rate varied among centers (range, 3.1% to 6.3%) and among surgeons (range, 1.9% to 9.2%). Predictors of in-hospital mortality included increased age, female gender, small body surface area, greater comorbidity, reoperation, poorer cardiac function as indicated by a lower ejection fraction, increased left ventricular end diastolic pressure and emergent or urgent surgery. After adjusting for the effects of potentially confounding variables, substantial and statistically significant variability was observed among medical centers (P = .021) and among surgeons (P = .025). CONCLUSION--We conclude that the observed differences in in-hospital mortality rates among institutions and among surgeons in northern New England are not solely the result of differences in case mix as described by these variables and may reflect differences in currently unknown aspects of patient care. Understanding this variation requires a detailed understanding of the processes of care. 
Tumor necrosis factor-alpha inhibits 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3-stimulated bone Gla protein synthesis in rat osteosarcoma cells (ROS 17/2.8) by a pretranslational mechanism. Tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF alpha), a 17,000 mol wt protein, mediates a variety of immunological and inflammatory events. TNF alpha is a potent inhibitor of bone collagen synthesis and stimulator of osteoclastic bone resorption, the net effect of which is to cause bone loss. We have previously reported that TNF alpha inhibits the synthesis of collagen by osteoblastic cells in culture out of proportion to effects on total protein synthesis, suggesting that inhibition of bone formation by TNF alpha may be due to selective inhibition of matrix protein synthesis. To further test this hypothesis and to evaluate the mechanism of TNF alpha action, we studied the effect of TNF alpha on synthesis of the osteoblast-specific bone Gla protein (BGP) by ROS 17/2.8 cells, which have the osteoblast phenotype. Cells were cultured with 10 nM 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 to stimulate BGP secretion, followed by the addition of TNF alpha (1-100 ng/ml) in 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3-containing medium. TNF alpha (10 ng/ml) inhibited BGP secretion to 42 +/- 5%, 19 +/- 10%, and 15 +/- 3% of control values after 24, 48, and 72 h of treatment. After 48 h, inhibition of BGP secretion was observed with 2 ng/ml TNF alpha and was maximum with 100 ng/ml. To determine the effect of TNF alpha on total protein synthesis, cells were pulse labeled with [14C]leucine during the last 4 h of TNF alpha treatment, and incorporation of radioactivity into trichloroacetic acid-precipitable protein in cell layer and medium was determined. The TNF alpha inhibition of BGP secretion was independent of changes in [14C]leucine incorporation, suggesting that TNF alpha did not have a general inhibitory effect on total protein synthesis. Cell number was not affected by TNF alpha. Northern analysis of steady state BGP mRNA revealed a dose-dependent decrease in the BGP/cyclophilin mRNA hybridization signal intensity after 24 h of treatment. The maximum inhibitory effect was 41 +/- 5% of the control value with 100 ng/ml TNF alpha. The effect of TNF alpha on steady state BGP mRNA levels was not prevented by treatment of cells with cycloheximide, suggesting that TNF-induced new protein synthesis was not required for TNF alpha action. These results suggest that the mechanism of TNF alpha inhibition of BGP synthesis includes a pretranslational site and support the hypothesis that TNF alpha inhibits bone formation by a selective inhibition of matrix protein production. 
C4A deficiency and poor prognosis in patients with IgA nephropathy. IgA nephropathy (Berger's disease) is an important cause of end-stage renal failure in persons of Asian and European descent. We performed C4 phenotyping on plasma from 123 patients with IgA nephropathy who resided in several different parts of the United States. All of these patients underwent diagnostic renal biopsy in adulthood. Six patients had a total deficiency for the C4A protein and all six had chronic renal insufficiency (serum creatinine concentration higher than 1.4 mg/dl at last follow-up). In contrast, 47% of the patients without C4A deficiency had chronic renal insufficiency (p = 0.001). The C4 gene defect was due to deletion of both C4A genes in only two individuals, whereas three patients were heterozygous for the C4A gene deletion. We speculate that the functional alteration of the complement system related to C4A deficiency might lead to expression of clinically severe disease in an individual with a genetic susceptibility to IgA nephropathy. 
A comparative immunohistochemical study of Kuru and senile plaques with a special reference to glial reactions at various stages of amyloid plaque formation. The authors examined 10 patients with Gerstmann-Straussler syndrome or Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease and 10 with Alzheimer's disease (AD). Immunohistochemistry using anti-prion protein (PrP) and anti-beta/A4 protein (beta/A4) coupled with formic acid pretreatment could detect Congophilic and non-Congophilic deposits. Prion protein deposits were classified into five types and compared with types of beta/A4 deposits. Kuru plaques with multicentric cores and fine granular deposits were a characteristic feature of PrP deposits. Some types of PrP or beta/A4 deposits depend on the anatomic sites. To clarify the relationship of microglia and astrocytes to PrP or beta/A4 deposits, double-immunostaining method was performed. In both kuru and senile plaques, microglia were closely linked to the Congophilic plaques. Astrocytes, however, extended their processes toward the plaques even in the non-Congophilic plaques. These observations strongly suggest that similar glial association with plaque formation may be involved in both kuru and senile plaques, although the amyloid core proteins differ. 
Determinant selection in murine experimental autoimmune myasthenia gravis. Effect of the bm12 mutation on T cell recognition of acetylcholine receptor epitopes. C57BL/6 (B6) mice respond to immunization with acetylcholine receptor (AChR) from Torpedo californica as measured by T cell proliferation, antibody production, and the development of muscle weakness resembling human myasthenia gravis. The congenic strain B6.C-H-2bm12 (bm12), which differs from B6 by three amino acid substitutions in the beta-chain of the MHC class II molecule I-A, develops a T cell proliferative response but does not produce antibody or develop muscle weakness. By examining the fine specificity of the B6 and bm12 T cell responses to AChR by using T cell clones and synthetic AChR peptides, we found key differences between the two strains in T cell epitope recognition. B6 T cells responded predominantly to the peptide representing alpha-subunit residues 146-162; this response was cross-reactive at the clonal level to peptide 111-126. Based on the sequence homology between these peptides and the T cell response to a set of truncated peptides, the major B6 T cell epitope was determined to be residues 148-152. The cross-reactivity of peptides 146-162 and 111-126 could also be demonstrated in vivo. Immunization of B6 mice with either peptide primed for T cell responses to both peptides. In contrast, immunization of bm12 mice with peptide 111-126 primed for an anti-peptide response, which did not cross-react with 146-162. Peptide-reactive T cells were not elicited after immunization of bm12 mice with 146-162. These results define a major T cell fine specificity in experimental autoimmune myasthenia gravis-susceptible B6 mice to be directed at alpha-subunit residues 148-152. T cells from disease-resistant bm12 mice fail to recognize this epitope but do recognize other portions of AChR. We postulate that alpha-148-152 is a disease-related epitope in murine experimental autoimmune myasthenia gravis. In this informative strain combination, MHC class II-associated determinant selection, rather than Ag responsiveness per se, may play a major role in determining disease susceptibility. 
Transesophageal echocardiography in the detection of potential cardiac source of embolism in stroke patients. To compare the diagnostic yields of transesophageal and transthoracic echocardiography in the detection of potential cardiac sources of embolism, 63 patients (mean +/- SD age 63 +/- 15 [range 18-87] years) with transient ischemic attacks or stroke underwent both procedures. Transthoracic echocardiography revealed a potential cardiac source of embolism in 14% (nine) of the patients, all of whom had clinical evidence of heart disease. Transesophageal echocardiography revealed a potential cardiac source of embolism in 41% (26) of the patients; 27% (seven) of these patients had no clinical cardiovascular abnormalities. Abnormalities detected only by transesophageal echocardiography in the patients with unsuspected cardiac disease included atrial septal aneurysm in two, patent foramen ovale in two, left atrial appendage thrombus in one, and myxomatous mitral valve in two. The 26 patients with an identified cardiac source of embolism were older (67.5 versus 59.4 years, p = 0.04), more frequently in atrial fibrillation (62% [16] versus 8% [3], p less than 0.0001), had a larger left atrium (43 versus 37 mm, p = 0.01) and more commonly had left ventricular hypertrophy (62% [16] versus 32% [12], p less than 0.02) than the 37 patients in whom no cardiac source of embolism was identified. Thus, transesophageal echocardiography is more sensitive than transthoracic echocardiography in the detection of potential cardiac sources of embolism in patients with cerebral ischemic events. 
Localization and needle aspiration of breast lesions: complications in 370 cases. A prospective study of the immediate complications of 370 consecutive breast-imaging procedures (203 wire localizations and 167 radiographically or sonographically guided fine-needle aspirations) is reported. Vasovagal reactions occurred in 27 (7%) of 370 cases, ranging in severity from syncope (four of 370, 1%) to mild light-headedness. These vasovagal reactions were independent of procedure type or use of local anesthesia, but were more common in younger patients. Other complications included prolonged (5 min or longer) bleeding (three of 370, 1%) and extreme pain (two of 370, 1%). One patient was found to have malignant hypertension. We conclude that wire localizations and imaging-guided aspirations are generally well tolerated procedures. However, vasovagal reactions are frequent enough to warrant close observation of patients. Radiologists and breast-imaging personnel should be able to recognize and treat vasovagal reactions. 
Response of atrial natriuretic factor to acute and chronic increases of atrial pressures in experimental heart failure in dogs. Role of changes in heart rate, atrial dimension, and cardiac tissue concentration. BACKGROUND. This study evaluated the role of changes in heart rate, atrial pressure, volume, and cardiac tissue atrial natriuretic factor (ANF) concentration in the modulation of plasma ANF concentration in a model of pacing-induced heart failure. METHODS AND RESULTS. The effects of acute right ventricular pacing (250 beats/min), acute volume expansion (35 ml/min), and volume expansion after 1 week of right ventricular pacing on plasma ANF concentration were compared in eight dogs (group 1). As shown during right ventricular pacing previously, volume expansion produced significant increases in cardiac filling pressures and left atrial volume. Right ventricular pacing and volume expansion produced similar increments in plasma ANF concentration: from 32 +/- 12 to 168 +/- 153 pg/ml (p less than 0.05) and from 32 +/- 9 to 137 +/- 113 pg/ml (p less than 0.05), respectively. When pacing was initiated after volume expansion, plasma ANF concentration increased further to 462 +/- 295 pg/ml (p less than 0.05) despite little change in filling pressures and left atrial volume. With repeated volume expansion after 1 week of pacing, there were no significant further increases in left atrial volume and plasma ANF concentrations (from 332 +/- 121 to 407 +/- 113 pg/ml) despite significant increases in filling pressures. Atrial and ventricular tissue samples were also obtained from 21 dogs paced to severe heart failure (group 2) and from 14 normal dogs (controls). In all groups, atrial ANF was higher than ventricular ANF concentration. At 1 week (group 1), left atrial appendage ANF concentration (6.2 +/- 2.5 versus 16.1 +/- 10.3 ng/mg) was reduced, whereas left ventricular free wall ANF concentration (0.62 +/- 0.31 versus 0.24 +/- 0.16 pg/mg) was increased compared with that of controls (both p less than 0.001). At severe heart failure (group 2), atrial ANF remained low, whereas ventricular ANF concentration was similar to that of the controls. CONCLUSIONS. These data indicate that in pacing-induced heart failure, changes in heart rate, atrial pressure, and volume all contribute to the increased plasma ANF concentration. However, by 1 week (early heart failure), ANF release is attenuated, perhaps because of the inability of the atria to be stretched further and because of reduced atrial ANF concentration. In addition, the ventricle may be an additional source of ANF. 
Lymphocytic adenohypophysitis: a pituitary mass lesion occurring in pregnancy. Proposal for medical treatment. Lymphocytic adenohypophysitis is a nonneoplastic, autoimmune cause of pituitary enlargement and insufficiency. Forty-eight of the 50 reported cases have occurred in women, nearly all in association with pregnancy. Left undiagnosed and untreated, it can progress to pituitary insufficiency and death. Histologic studies show characteristic changes of autoimmune disease with lymphocytic infiltration and destruction of anterior pituitary tissue with fibrotic replacement. Lymphocytic adenohypophysitis is currently diagnosed after other pituitary mass lesions are excluded and has been treated with a combination of neurosurgery and end-organ hormone replacement. However, with improved knowledge of the pathophysiologic characteristics and natural history of the disease and with the ability to make a prospective diagnosis, we believe glucocorticoids may suppress the inflammatory response and protect remaining pituitary tissue. Two previously unreported pregnancy-associated cases are described, including one prospectively diagnosed and treated without neurosurgery during pregnancy. Obstetrician-gynecologists must place lymphocytic adenohypophysitis in the differential diagnosis of pituitary enlargement associated with pregnancy, since treatment is available and the sequelae may be life-threatening. 
Hepatocellular carcinoma in Richardson's ground squirrels (Spermophilus richardsonii): evidence for association with hepatitis B-like virus infection. During studies of seasonal obesity, a high frequency of hepatic neoplasms was observed in Richardson's ground squirrels. Of 12 Richardson's ground squirrels examined thoroughly, 7 had mild or moderate degrees of chronic portal hepatitis and 6 (50%) had hepatocellular carcinoma. Serological tests for hepadnavirus surface antigen, anti-core antibody and virion DNA that recognize the ground squirrel hepatitis virus of California ground squirrels (Spermophilus beecheyi) were uniformly negative. Southern blot analyses of EcoRI digests of liver cell DNA demonstrated 3.2 kb fragments that hybridized with a ground squirrel hepatitis virus-specific probe in nontumorous liver tissue from 6 of 10 ground squirrels and in hepatocellular carcinoma specimens from 2 of 5 squirrels indicating infection with a hepadnavirus related to ground squirrel hepatitis virus. Failure, however, to detect serum antibody to ground squirrel hepatitis core antigen suggested probable antigenic differences between the ground squirrel hepatitis virus of California ground squirrels and the putative Richardson's ground squirrel agent. Further studies are required to fully characterize the hepadnavirus of Richardson's ground squirrels and to determine its relationship to hepatocarcinogenesis in this species. 
Experimental induction of heterotopic bone. Heterotopic bone can be induced in experimental animals by trauma to the soft tissues, by induction from living cells, or by extracts from bone and teeth. In the first two types, the mechanism of the inductive process is not known, whereas in the latter, a factor isolated from bone matrix induces bone formation. Mesenchymal cells in bone marrow are determined for development into cartilage and bone cells and only an unspecific stimulus, such as trauma or autotransplantation, is sufficient for the development into mature osteogenic tissue. Mesenchymal cells will not differentiate into bone cells unless stimulated by a specific inductive substance, bone morphogenetic protein (BMP). Implanted to a heterotopic site, BMP induces undifferentiated mesenchymal cells into a bone morphogenetic pathway of development, causing heterotopic bone formation. The quantitative inductive response is dependent on the source of the BMP, and the bone formation is also determined by the recruitment of inducible target cells and by the environment at the implantation site. Hence, the environment at the implantation site is of major importance for the amount of bone formed. BMP initiates a cascade of events that is modulated by endocrine and paracrine factors. The heterotopic bone has all the morphologic and biochemical characteristics of orthotopic bone, is subjected to turnover, and even has the intriguing ability to generate the formation of bone marrow. Experimental induction of heterotopic bone has become a most useful method to study osteoneogenesis and has supplied important information on the prerequisites for new bone formation and on the regulation of bone metabolism. 
Mechanisms of failure of mitral valve repair: an echocardiographic study. Surgical valve repair for mitral regurgitation has significant advantages over valve replacement, but little is known about the mechanisms of its failure. This echocardiographic study examined abnormalities leading to failed mitral valve repair in two populations: "immediate failure" of the valve repair in the operating room requiring a second run of cardiopulmonary bypass and "late failure" of valve repair necessitating reoperation on another occasion. Intraoperative echocardiography (IOE) after cardiopulmonary bypass was performed in 309 patients undergoing valve repair for mitral regurgitation over a 3-year period. Twenty-six (8%) of these patients had immediate failure of the repair demonstrated by IOE, requiring further repair or replacement during the same thoracotomy. The causes of immediate failure were left ventricular outflow tract obstruction (10 patients), incomplete correction (10 patients), and suture dehiscence (six patients). Echocardiography was performed on 17 patients requiring reoperation for recurrent mitral regurgitation who had undergone previous primary valve repair. These late failures resulted from progressive degenerative leaflet or chordal disease (n = 9) or suture dehiscence of the annular ring or the leaflet resection site (n = 6). In only two patients early in the series did the problem originate from inadequate initial surgery. IOE is an effective marker for unsuccessful mitral valve repair, and affords an understanding of the mechanism of the persistent dysfunction. Immediate failure of mitral repair may be reduced by greater attention to the mechanism of valve dysfunction and by changes in valvuloplasty technique to avoid outflow tract obstruction. Late failure after mitral repair occurs predominantly due to progression of disease, particularly in patients with severe myxomatous or annular abnormalities that are prone to progress. 
Sleep apnea and systemic hypertension: a causal association review. OBJECTIVE: To critically examine the causal association between sleep apnea syndrome and hypertension. METHODS: A retrospective systematic critique of five epidemiologic studies published in the English literature during 1978 to 1989 identified on Medline and manual literature searches. The evidence was evaluated using the standard observational criteria for causation: strength of association, consistency, dose-response relationship, temporal sequence, specificity, and biologic plausibility. RESULTS: We found evidence to support a causal association between sleep apnea syndrome and hypertension in consistency and specificity and some evidence to suggest a dose-response relationship. Review of the data dealing with the mechanisms important in the pathogenesis of sleep apnea and hypertension allowed us to advance several theories to provide support for biologic plausibility. CONCLUSION: We concluded that there is a positive association--relative risk estimate between 1.3 and 40--for sleep apnea syndrome and hypertension, but the risk association is unstable. Thus, we believe that there is insufficient data to justify doing polysomnography as part of the routine diagnostic work-up for patients with hypertension. 
Accessory receptors regulate coupling of the T-cell receptor complex to tyrosine kinase activation and mobilization of cytoplasmic calcium in T-lineage acute lymphoblastic leukemia. T-lineage acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) cells have abundant cytoplasmic CD3/Ti but express low amounts on the cell surface and are deficient in CD3/Ti-mediated signal transduction. Nevertheless, plating T-ALL cells on dishes containing immobilized anti-CD3 monoclonal antibodies with a source of growth factors induced the expression of CD25 (interleukin-2 receptor alpha chain) and stimulated the formation of blast colonies in 12 of 14 cases studied. The proliferative response to CD3 ligation was modulated by the presence of antibodies to the CD2, CD4, or CD8 accessory T-cell receptors. The effect of these accessory receptors on signal transduction mediated by CD3/Ti was next investigated by monitoring cytoplasmic calcium concentration [( Ca2+]i) and by measuring tyrosine phosphorylation after stimulation. Crosslinking CD3, CD2, CD4, or CD8 alone did not induce cytoplasmic calcium mobilization in T-ALLs, but crosslinking the accessory receptors with CD3/Ti induced calcium responses in three of the T-ALLs and enhanced calcium responses in three of the T-ALL cell lines, including HPB-ALL, MOLT-4, and CEM. Crosslinking CD4 but not CD2 with CD3/Ti greatly enhanced tyrosine phosphorylation of multiple substrates in comparison with crosslinking either CD4 or CD3/Ti separately on both normal mature T cells and the CEM T-ALL cell line. Thus, CD4 regulates CD3/Ti signal transduction in T-ALL cells through the tyrosine phosphorylation of substrates whereas CD2 may regulate [Ca2+]i signal transduction through a separate mechanism. 
Double-inlet ventricle presenting in infancy. II. Results of palliative operations. The influence of palliation on survival was studied in 191 consecutive infants, presenting at under 1 year of age, with double-inlet ventricle (1973 to 1988, median follow-up 8.5 years). Palliative operations were performed on 154 occasions in 121 patients (63%). Survival after a systemic-pulmonary arterial shunt (n = 57) and banding of the pulmonary trunk (n = 35) was comparable (84% and 77% at 1 year, 62% and 45% at 5 years), but those who underwent repair of aortic arch obstruction fared worse (n = 18, 44% and 22% at 1 and 5 years, p less than 0.001). The remainder did not undergo an operation because of balanced physiology (n = 17, 9% of entire group), complex anatomy (n = 32, 15%), or irreversible low output (n = 19, 12%). Palliative surgery, overall, had a deleterious effect on immediate survival (greater than 1 month relative risk 6.6, p less than 0.001), but, in the survivors, medium-term outcome was improved (greater than 6 months, 0.68, p less than 0.05). This effect was most marked for those undergoing a systemic-pulmonary artery shunt (less than 1 month, 2.52; greater than 6 months, 0.43); by contrast, after banding of the pulmonary trunk, with or without additional repair of the aortic arch repair, medium-term risk was not altered (greater than 6 months, 1.13 and 0.91, respectively). These data will assist the clinician in making decisions concerning the management of infants with double-inlet ventricle and in the judicious use of palliative surgery. 
Effect of intraoperative aprotinin administration on postoperative bleeding in patients undergoing cardiopulmonary bypass operation. To study the hemostyptic effect of aprotinin (Trasylol) in patients undergoing extracorporeal circulation for coronary artery bypass operations, we randomized 12 of 24 patients to receive aprotinin in high dosage (about 800 mg) during extracorporeal circulation. From the resulting two groups each, one patient was excluded from the study because of postoperative myocardial infarction (control group) and surgical hemorrhage (aprotinin group) leading to a second operation. Although heparin was used for anticoagulation in all 22 patients, all had a marked increase in plasma levels of thrombin-antithrombin III complexes during extracorporeal circulation, indicating an intravasal activation of coagulation. By monitoring the plasma levels of fibrin degradation products in patients without aprotinin therapy, we recorded a concomitant hyperfibrinolysis significantly less pronounced in patients receiving aprotinin (p less than 0.005). The mean total postoperative blood loss was lower in patients receiving aprotinin (620 ml) than in control patients (1000 ml; p less than 0.03). The results confirm previous reports of a hemostyptic effect of aprotinin in cardiac operations. This effect is probably due to a prevention of hyperfibrinolysis. 
Gout and hyperuricemia. Accurate diagnosis is essential since gout is overdiagnosed by a factor of three. Asymptomatic hyperuricemia is not associated with adverse consequences and should not ordinarily be treated. The acute attack of gout responds to any nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug, and antihyperuricemic therapy with allopurinol, probenecid or sulfinpyrazone is effective in lowering uric acid and preventing further attacks. Except for prophylaxis, colchicine is not recommended for the treatment of gout because of unacceptable levels of toxicity. Diet therapy, once a mainstay of treatment, is usually not indicated since drug therapy alone is far more efficacious. 
Reduced cerebral grey matter observed in alcoholics using magnetic resonance imaging. Twenty-eight chronic alcoholics and 36 age- and sex-matched non-alcoholic controls were examined with magnetic resonance imaging and brain morphometric analyses. Results confirmed large increases in subarachnoid cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) volume and mild ventricular enlargement in the alcoholics and revealed associated volume reductions of localized cortical and subcortical cerebral structures. Volume losses in the diencephalon, the caudate nucleus, dorsolateral frontal and parietal cortex, and mesial temporal lobe structures were the most prominent. Significant correlations between increments in cortical and ventricular CSF and decrements in the volume of cortical and subcortical grey matter were noted. Although there was little evidence for relationships between performance on neuropsychological tests and volume of grey matter structures, significant correlations between some cognitive measures and subcortical and cortical fluid volumes were found. The parallels between this pattern of affected structures and recent neuropathological findings are discussed. 
Pathogenesis of edema in constrictive pericarditis. Studies of body water and sodium, renal function, hemodynamics, and plasma hormones before and after pericardiectomy. BACKGROUND. The pathogenesis of sodium and water accumulation in chronic constrictive pericarditis is not well understood and may differ from that in patients with chronic congestive heart failure due to myocardial disease. This study was undertaken to investigate some of the mechanisms. METHODS AND RESULTS. Using standard techniques, the hemodynamics, water and electrolyte spaces, renal function, and plasma concentrations of hormones were measured in 16 patients with untreated constrictive pericarditis and were measured again in eight patients after pericardiectomy. The average hemodynamic measurements were as follows: cardiac output, 1.98 l/min/m2; right atrial pressure, 22.9 mm Hg; pulmonary wedge pressure, 24.2 mm Hg; and mean pulmonary artery pressure 30.2 mm Hg. The systemic and pulmonary vascular resistances (36.3 +/- 2.5 and 3.2 +/- 0.3 mm Hg.min.m2/l, respectively) were increased. Significant increases occurred in total body water (36%), extracellular volume (81%), plasma volume (53%), and exchangeable sodium (63%). The renal plasma flow was only moderately decreased (49%), and the glomerular filtration rate was normal. Significant increases also occurred in plasma concentrations of norepinephrine (3.6 times normal), renin activity (7.2 time normal), aldosterone (3.4 times normal), cortisol (1.4 times normal), growth hormone (21.8 times normal), and atrial natriuretic peptide (5 times normal). The ratio of left atrial to aortic diameter measured by echocardiography was only minimally increased (1.29 +/- 0.04), indicating that in constrictive pericarditis the atria are prevented from expanding. The studies repeated after pericardiectomy in the eight patients showed that all measurements returned toward normal. CONCLUSIONS. The restricted distensibility of the atria, in constrictive pericarditis, limits the secretion of atrial natriuretic factor and, thus, reduces its natriuretic and diuretic effects. This results in retention of water and sodium greater than that occurring in patients with edema from myocardial disease. The arterial pressure is maintained more by the expansion of the blood volume than by an increase in the peripheral vascular resistance. 
Transient penetration of the hip joint during in situ cannulated-screw fixation of slipped capital femoral epiphysis. Before the routine intraoperative use of fluoroscopy at our institution during procedures to stabilize a slipped capital femoral epiphysis, twenty-five patients (thirty hips) had in situ cannulated-screw stabilization of a slipped capital femoral epiphysis with use of biplane radiography. Thus, a permanent record of the procedure was available for review. Fourteen hips in fourteen patients had an intraoperative episode during which the joint was penetrated by the guide-pin assembly or cannulated screw, or both. This penetration was corrected at the time of the operation. Eleven patients were followed for a minimum of two years (mean, thirty-nine months; range, twenty-four to sixty-three months). All physes went on to closure. None of the patients had clinical or radiographic evidence of chondrolysis. Transient penetration of the hip joint did not lead to chondrolysis in this series. This suggests that a single episode of penetration by a pin or screw, with immediate removal from the joint, is not associated with the development of chondrolysis. 
Massive hepatic enlargement with fatty change associated with ketoconazole Several forms of hepatic toxicity have been described with the antifungal agent ketoconazole. We report a case of massive liver enlargement with fatty infiltration presenting as gastric compression. This occurred in a young woman with AIDS taking ketoconazole as maintenance therapy for cryptococcal meningitis. This is the first reported case of ketoconazole causing fatty change in the liver. 
Angelchik prosthesis complicates treatment of adenocarcinoma in Barrett's esophagus. Indications for use of the Angelchik prosthesis remain controversial, and many surgeons actively involved in the treatment of reflux disease have not used the device. We describe a case that illustrates difficulties associated with resection of a tumor in the presence of this prothesis. Such experience suggests that patients known to have Barrett's esophagus might be better treated with standard antireflux procedures.
