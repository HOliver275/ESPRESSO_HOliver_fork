An in vivo model for the neurodegenerative effects of beta amyloid and protection by substance P. Deposition of the beta-amyloid protein in senile plaques is a pathologic hallmark of Alzheimer disease (AD). Focal deposition of beta amyloid in the adult rat cerebral cortex caused profound neurodegenerative changes, including neuronal loss and degenerating neurons and neurites. Chronic induction of the Alz-50 antigen appeared in neurons around focal cortical deposits of beta amyloid. Immunoblot analysis showed that beta amyloid induced Alz-50-immunoreactive proteins in rat cerebral cortex that were very similar to the proteins induced in human cerebral cortex from patients with AD. The neuropeptide substance P prevented beta-amyloid-induced neuronal loss and expression of Alz-50 proteins when coadministered into the cerebral cortex. Systemic administration of substance P also provided protection against the effects of intracerebral beta amyloid. Thus, beta amyloid is a potent neurotoxin in the adult brain in vivo, and its effects can be blocked by substance P. 
Chronic prosthetic vascular graft infection visualized with technetium-99m-hexamethylpropyleneamine oxime-labeled leukocytes Technetium-99m-HMPAO labeled leukocytes demonstrated chronic femoro-femoral prosthetic vascular graft infection several times during an 18-mo period in a 77-yr-old man. The intensity and distribution of the uptake in the graft were fluctuating in different imaging occasions possibly indicating the strength and location of the infection. Gallium-67-citrate imaging showed negative results twice. The reason for negative 67Ga results remained obscure. The infected graft was removed and the patient did well 5 mo postoperatively. 
No effect of zidovudine on hepatitis B virus replication in homosexual men with symptomatic HIV-1 infection. Zidovudine triphosphate inhibits the hepatitis B virus (HBV) DNA polymerase (DNAp) in vitro. Serial measurements of serum HBV DNAp activity and HBV DNA were made in 14 consecutive male homosexual patients starting zidovudine for symptomatic HIV-1 infection. Median duration of treatment was 15 weeks (range 2-72). In the 13 patients with detectable DNAp/DNA pre-treatment, no significant change in either measure of viral replication was observed during the first 16 weeks of treatment compared with the 13 weeks prior to treatment. The lack of response may be due to the opposing effect of immunosuppression, or to a failure of in vivo activity. 
Tumor invasion of the chest wall and mediastinum in lung cancer: evaluation with pneumothorax CT. For preoperative evaluation of chest wall and mediastinal invasion by lung cancer, computed tomography (CT), combined with artificial pneumothorax (pneumothorax CT), was performed in 43 patients with lung cancer in whom conventional CT scans showed that the mass was contiguous to the chest wall (n = 30) and/or mediastinum (n = 25) but without evidence of definite tumor invasion. Invasion was diagnosed on the basis of whether an air space existed between the mass and the adjacent structures. In three patients pneumothorax was not produced. After the procedure, four patients developed symptomatic pneumothorax, and one, subcutaneous emphysema. Comparison of diagnoses based on findings at pneumothorax CT, surgery, and pathologic examination showed that pneumothorax CT is 100% accurate for chest wall invasion and 76% accurate for mediastinal invasion. The authors conclude that this procedure is helpful in accurate evaluation of the T criterion in lung cancer, especially for patients in whom findings at conventional CT suggest tumor invasion of the chest wall and mediastinum. 
Alpha 2 macroglobulin state in acute pancreatitis. Raised values of alpha 2 macroglobulin-protease complexes in severe and mild attacks. Plasma values of C reactive protein, alpha 1 proteinase inhibitor, alpha 2 macroglobulin, and complexed alpha 2 macroglobulin have been determined in serial samples from 27 patients with acute pancreatitis. Complexed alpha 2 macroglobulin was measured by a novel enzyme linked immunosorbent assay with a monoclonal antibody specific for the complexed form. Patients with severe illness had lower concentrations of total alpha 2 macroglobulin and higher concentrations of complexed alpha 2 macroglobulin than those with mild illness, and in the majority of severe attacks the abnormal amounts of complexed alpha 2 macroglobulin were present throughout the eight days of the study. The proportion of total alpha 2 macroglobulin in the uncomplexed form, however, was generally greater than 90%, and in 26% of the mild cases completely normal concentrations of uncomplexed alpha 2 macroglobulin (greater than 99% of total) were found throughout the eight days of the study. This suggests that exhaustion of alpha 2 macroglobulin in plasma is unlikely to be a major factor in the pathogenesis of acute pancreatitis. 
Depression of factor XII-dependent fibrinolytic activity characterizes patients with early myocardial reinfarction after recombinant tissue-type plasminogen activator therapy. Twenty patients with acute myocardial infarction treated with recombinant tissue-type plasminogen activator (rt-PA) had endogenous factor XII-dependent fibrinolytic activity levels measured throughout the hospital period and those levels were prospectively correlated with the incidence of recurrent myocardial infarction until 8 weeks after hospital discharge. Within the follow-up period, recurrent myocardial infarction was observed in 8 patients, whereas the remaining 12 patients showed no clinical evidence of recurrence. The patients in the reinfarction group were characterized by a more pronounced depletion of and sustained lower levels of factor XII-dependent fibrinolytic activity than were the patients with no reinfarction (p less than 0.05). The decrease in fibrinolytic activity during rt-PA therapy was significantly associated with a depletion of functional alpha 2-antiplasmin, the primary plasmin inhibitor. These results indicate that, paradoxically, coronary thrombolysis with rt-PA involves depletion of endogenous factor XII-dependent fibrinolytic activity levels, which constitutes a risk for early myocardial reinfarction. 
Arthroscopic stapling for detached superior glenoid labrum. Superior labral tears of the shoulder involve the biceps tendon and labrum complex which may be detached, displaced inferiorly, and interposed between the glenoid and the humeral head. We have treated ten young athletes with painful shoulders due to this lesion by arthroscopic stapling. Arthroscopy at the time of staple removal, after three to six months, showed that all the lesions had been stabilised. Clinical review at over 24 months showed an excellent or good result in 80%. The two relative failures were due in one to residual subacromial bursitis, and the other to multidirectional shoulder instability. Arthroscopic stapling can restore the shoulder anatomy, and it is recommended for active adolescent athletes with this lesion. 
Percutaneous intra-aortic balloon pump: emphasis on complications. In a review of our 5-year experience with intra-aortic balloon pump (IABP) insertion I examined the complications of percutaneous IABP placement in 93 patients, and compared them with those reported in other studies in the literature. I analyzed several variables that may affect the complication rate. Of 78 patients in our series who had percutaneous IABP cardiac assist, 15 (19%) had complications, which falls into the acceptable range reported by others. Among 15 patients who had surgical placement of an IABP, the complication rate was similar at 20%. The complication rate after IABP insertions done by surgeons primarily in the operating room was compared with that from insertions done by cardiologists in the catheterization laboratory. The overall complication rate was found to be higher in the second group, 28.0% compared with 12.8%. The application of the IABP in cardiogenic shock was associated with a high complication rate (46%). On the other hand, its insertion before cardiac surgery was associated with a relatively low complication rate (9.5%). 
Left ventricular outflow obstruction resulting from insertion of mitral prostheses leaving the native leaflets intact: adverse clinical outcome in seven patients. Left ventricular (LV) outflow obstruction may result from retaining the anterior mitral leaflet when a mitral prosthesis is inserted in the mitral anulus. We retrospectively reviewed the echocardiograms (two-dimensional Doppler and Doppler color flow imaging, or transesophageal with color flow imaging) obtained in seven patients with preoperative mitral regurgitation who had a prosthesis implanted with the native mitral leaflets left intact. Systolic anterior motion of the native anterior mitral leaflet, as seen in dynamic LV outflow tract obstruction, was observed in six of seven patients. LV fractional shortening preoperatively was less than or equal to 0.25 in all (mean 0.20 +/- 0.04) and did not significantly (p = ns) increase postoperatively (mean 0.27 +/- 0.12). Color flow imaging revealed disturbed systolic flow in the LV outflow tract in five patients, and all had systolic anterior motion of the native anterior mitral leaflet. Continuous wave Doppler detected significant systolic LV outflow tract jets in five patients averaging 4.1 +/- 0.9 m/sec. Mitral prosthetic function was normal (pressure half-time of 81 +/- 25 msec and mean gradient of 7 +/- 3 mm Hg +/- SD) in five patients. Clinical follow-up revealed that all had died, six of them within 2 months of their operation. Thus systolic anterior motion of the native anterior mitral leaflet occurs commonly after prosthetic mitral valve insertion with the native leaflets left intact. Continuous wave Doppler often demonstrates increased systolic LV outflow tract velocities consistent with dynamic LV outflow obstruction. 
Periorbital necrobiotic xanthogranuloma and stage I multiple myeloma. Ultrastructure and response to pulsed dexamethasone documented by magnetic resonance imaging. We observed a 40-year-old woman with necrobiotic xanthogranuloma from the inception of indurated eyelid and periorbital infiltrates and concurrent stage I multiple myeloma to resolution of infiltrates in skin and bone marrow after pulsed high-dose oral dexamethasone therapy. Ultrastructural studies revealed lipid vacuoles in epidermal keratinocytes, in dermal histiocytic macrophages, and in vascular and lymphatic endothelial cells. The presence of lipid vacuoles in epidermal keratinocytes has not been reported previously in xanthogranuloma. 
Failed back surgery syndrome: 5-year follow-up after spinal cord stimulator implantation. Spinal cord stimulation, in use for more than 20 years, has evolved into an easily implemented technique, with percutaneous methods for electrode placement. We have reviewed our experience with this technique in treating "failed back surgery syndrome," and have assessed patient and treatment characteristics as predictors of long-term outcome. A series of 50 patients with failed back surgery syndrome (averaging 3.1 previous operations), who underwent spinal cord stimulator implantation, was interviewed by impartial third parties, at mean follow-up intervals of 2.2 years and 5.0 years. Successful outcome (at least 50% sustained relief of pain and patient satisfaction with the result) was recorded in 53% of patients at 2.2 years and in 47% of patients at 5.0 years postoperatively. Ten of 40 patients who were disabled preoperatively returned to work. Improvements in activities of daily living were recorded in most patients for most activities; loss of function was rare. Most patients reduced or eliminated analgesic intake. Statistical analysis (including univariate and multivariate logistic regression) of patient characteristics as prognostic factors showed significant advantages for female patients and for those with programmable multi-contact implanted devices. These results, in patients with postsurgical lumbar arachnoid and epidural fibrosis and without surgically remediable lesions, compare favorably with the results in two separate series of patients with failed back surgery syndrome, in whom 1) surgical lesions were diagnosed and repeated operation performed; and 2) monoradicular pain syndromes were diagnosed and dorsal root ganglionectomies performed at our institution. This suggests the need for further assessment of selection criteria, critical analysis of treatment outcome, and prospective study of spinal cord stimulation and alternative approaches to failed back surgery syndrome. 
Antiplatelet and antithrombotic therapy in unstable angina. In 4 well-controlled clinical trials, aspirin reduced the incidence of coronary events in unstable angina. The benefits were present during the acute, subacute and more chronic phases of the disease and were independent of the doses and of other protocol differences. This benefit of aspirin can be extended to some, but not all, other antiplatelet drugs. In 4 clinical trials, heparin used acutely added substantial benefit to the management of unstable angina, reducing the event rate and also the incidence of refractory angina more than aspirin. The long-term benefit of antithrombin therapy remains to be more thoroughly investigated. Despite these successes, the failure rate of aspirin and of heparin remains high, justifying a continuing search for more potent and safe antiplatelet and antithrombotic drugs. 
Carbon dioxide laser ablation of cutaneous metastases from malignant melanoma. Multiple cutaneous and superficial subcutaneous metastases from malignant melanoma in 30 patients were treated palliatively by carbon dioxide laser ablation when lesions were to numerous, too large or recurring too rapidly for multiple local excisions. The number of lesions per patient ranged from three to 250 (median 30). Patients were treated under local or general anaesthetic and as day cases or inpatients. After a median follow-up interval of 8 months fewer than 1 per cent of lasered metastases have recurred locally. Sixteen patients have developed cutaneous metastases at other sites requiring further treatment. Approximately 2000 lesions have been treated on 64 occasions. Patients reported little or no pain after the operation and required only simple dry dressings. Wounds were completely healed in 2-6 weeks with good cosmetic results. This simple and effective treatment is becoming an alternative to isolated limb perfusion. 
Use of endoscopy in peptic ulcer disease. The diagnosis and treatment of acute bleeding caused by peptic ulcer disease has been greatly facilitated by fiberoptic endoscopy. The basic differentiation between malignant and benign gastric ulcer requires endoscopic confirmation with biopsy. The management of bleeding from peptic ulceration can be enhanced by endoscopic examination as can the prediction of risk for recurrent bleeding or need for surgical intervention. Various therapeutic maneuvers can be performed endoscopically, including monopolar and multipolar cautery, laser and heater probe therapy, and injection of vasoconstrictors to control bleeding. Endoscopic balloon dilation for the management of gastric outlet obstruction is often effective. 
Optic chiasmal neuritis. In four of six patients with clinical optic chiasmal neuritis, MRI demonstrated abnormalities of the chiasm. Optic chiasmal neuritis may be the initial manifestation of multiple sclerosis, a reflection of established CNS demyelination, or an isolated clinical finding. 
MR imaging evaluation of endometrial carcinoma: results of an NCI cooperative study. A prospective study to assess the usefulness of magnetic resonance (MR) imaging in the evaluation of endometrial carcinoma was undertaken by five institutions under the auspices of the National Cancer Institute. Six different MR imagers were used, ranging in magnetic field strength from 0.15 T to 1.5 T. For each unit, appropriate T1- and T2-weighted sequences in the transverse plane and T2-weighted sequences in the sagittal plane were used. Initially, 107 patients were entered in the study, but only 88 fulfilled all the criteria and provide the basis for this study. The abnormality within the endometrial cavity was demonstrated with MR imaging in 81% of the patients. The overall accuracy with MR imaging for staging endometrial carcinoma was 85%. In the evaluation of depth of myometrial invasion for stage I disease, overall accuracy with MR imaging was 74%. The accuracy of MR imaging in assessing tumors confined to endometrium or tumor with superficial myometrial invasion was 89% and decreased to 54% in assessing deep myometrial invasion. The results of this prospective study performed by multiple examiners with vastly different equipment demonstrate the inherent value of MR imaging in the evaluation of this neoplasm. 
Effect of prazosin treatment on HDL kinetics in patients with hypertension. The effect of prazosin treatment on blood pressure, plasma HDL-cholesterol concentration, and apoprotein-AI/HDL (apoAI/HDL) kinetics was studied in 11 patients with mild hypertension. Blood pressure (mean +/- SEM) fell from 143 +/- 1/96 +/- 1 to 134 +/- 1/86 +/- 1 mm Hg after 4 to 5 months of prazosin treatment (P less than .001), associated with an increase in plasma HDL-cholesterol concentration from 38 +/- 2 to 46 +/- 2 mg/dL (P less than .001). Both the fractional catabolic rate (FCR) and total synthetic rate of apoAI/HDL, which were higher than previous reported values for normal individuals, decreased from 0.36 +/- 0.02 to 0.30 +/- 0.02 L/day and 17.4 +/- 1.1 to 13.8 +/- 1.1 mg/kg/min, respectively. These changes were statistically significant, and the post-treatment values for both variables were now within the normal range. When the decay curve was further analyzed by nonlinear curve fitting, it was shown that the return to normal of the FCR of apoAI/HDL in patients treated with prazosin was accounted for by the decrease of the decay constants of the second [p(2)] and third [p(3)] components of the 125I-AI/HDL disappearance curve. In conclusion, abnormalities in HDL concentration and HDL kinetics exist in patients with very mild hypertension. These defects were significantly improved with prazosin treatment, and this may render the compound of particular clinical benefit in the treatment of patients with mild hypertension. 
Paediatric haemangiomas: the role of radiotherapy. Radiotherapy currently maintains an occasional place in the therapy of complicated haemangiomas of childhood. Eight such childhood benign lesions have been so treated at St Bartholomew's Hospital in the last 10 years. The case histories are presented before being discussed in the context of other therapies available (no treatment, steroids, embolism and surgery), radiation technique used and radiation dose prescription advised. 
Fatal human cyclical neutropenia with unresolving tonsillitis and bilateral cervical abscesses. Human Cyclical Neutropenia is a rare haematological disorder, characterized by periodic oscillations in peripheral neutrophil levels from normal to neutropenic, during which patients experience ulcerative stomatitis, fever, malaise and occasional cutaneous and subcutaneous infections. We present our experience with a fatal case of Human Cyclical Neutropenia together with a brief review of the literature and diagnostic criteria. The paper aims to heighten the clinical awareness of the otolaryngologist to the condition. Close co-operation with the haematologist is essential both for diagnosis and management. 
'Medial maxillectomy' for lateral nasal wall neoplasms. Lateral rhinotomy and "medial maxillectomy," an en bloc resection of the medial maxillary sinus, ethmoid sinus with the lamina papyracea, medial orbital floor, and lacrimal fossa-duct, have been advocated for lateral nasal wall neoplasma. Experience with 35 (of 41) patients followed up at least 30 months (median, 57 months) postoperatively is reported. There was a 9% recurrence for benign tumors and 15% for malignant neoplasms, the latter only in the patients with nonmelanoma malignant neoplasms not receiving postoperative radiotherapy. The most frequent complications were cavity crusting, epicanthal scarring, and epiphora. 
Efficacy of slow-release nifedipine on myocardial ischemic episodes in variant angina pectoris. To evaluate the efficacy of slow-release nifedipine (a single dose of 20 mg given at 10 P.M. or 2 doses of 20 mg at 10 P.M. and 6 A.M.) on ischemic episodes in patients with variant angina, a single-blind crossover study with ambulatory electrocardiographic monitoring was performed in 15 patients (13 men and 2 women, mean age 63 years). In all, there were 646 ischemic episodes detected with ambulatory electrocardiographic monitoring during the study period, and 618 episodes of them occurred during placebo periods with a circadian variation. Sixty-nine percent of the episodes in placebo periods were asymptomatic. The number of anginal attacks, nitroglycerin tablets taken, ST-segment elevation and the total ischemic duration significantly decreased during nifedipine therapy compared with results after the placebo therapy period, respectively (p less than 0.01 or 0.05). Twenty-eight ischemic episodes occurred during nifedipine therapy when the plasma level of nifedipine was low. Thus, asymptomatic ischemic episodes more frequently occur than symptomatic episodes and the administration of slow-release nifedipine is highly effective in suppressing not only symptomatic but also asymptomatic myocardial ischemia in patients with variant angina. The timing of the administration of slow-release nifedipine is an important factor in suppressing ischemic episodes. 
Natural history of hepatic haemangiomas: clinical and ultrasound study. Hepatic haemangiomas are the most common benign tumours of the liver and commonly present as incidental findings on sonographic examination of the abdomen. Since little is known of the natural course of these tumours, we performed a clinical and sonographic follow up of 123 haemangioma patients. Our prospective study investigated clinical and sonographic findings in 158 haemangiomas for periods of 12 to 60 months. Ninety nine haemangiomas measured less than 2 cm and had an echogenic pattern; 40 were between 2 cm and 5 cm with a mainly echogenic structure; 19 measured greater than 5 cm and showed a mixed echo pattern. At the first examination only eight patients, all with giant haemangiomas, presented symptoms which could be attributed to the tumour. During follow up only one haemangioma changed in shape and size. One patient who was symptom free at the first examination experienced right upper abdominal quadrant pain during follow up. No deterioration occurred in any of the patients with symptoms at the first examination, and all had a satisfactory quality of life. No complications arose during the follow up period. This study shows that in adults haemangiomas remain stable in size and echo patterns rarely change. Only haemangiomas greater than 5 cm may cause symptoms. Prolonged clinical and sonographic follow up of small and medium sized haemangiomas is not warranted. 
Recent advances in the treatment of breast cancer. Multidisciplinary efforts have defined a number of prognostic factors and newer strategies to improve the outcome of patients with breast cancer. Conservative surgery has led to improved functional and cosmetic results. The development of a number of effective adjuvant regimens has led to improved survival. In patients with stage I disease, several biological characteristics of tumor have been identified that are associated with increased risk of relapse. A multimodality approach to patients with locally advanced disease and inflammatory cancer has resulted in improved survival. A number of hormonal and cytotoxic drug contaminations can palliate metastatic disease, with a small fraction of patients remaining in extended remission. Dose-intensive programs may lead to further improvements in survival of selected patients with this disease. 
Metabolic imaging of patients with cardiomyopathy. The cardiomyopathies comprise a diverse group of illnesses that can be characterized functionally by several techniques. However, the delineation of derangements of regional perfusion and metabolism have been accomplished only relatively recently with positron emission tomography (PET). Regional myocardial accumulation and clearance of 11C-palmitate, the primary myocardial substrate under most conditions, demonstrate marked spatial heterogeneity when studied under fasting conditions or with glucose loading. PET with 11C-palmitate permits the noninvasive differentiation of patients with nonischemic from ischemic dilated cardiomyopathy, since patients with ischemic cardiomyopathy demonstrate large zones of intensely depressed accumulation of 11C-palmitate, probably reflecting prior infarction. Patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy and Duchenne's muscular dystrophy demonstrate relatively unique patterns of myocardial abnormalities of perfusion and metabolism. The availability of new tracers and techniques for the evaluation of myocardial metabolism (11C-acetate), perfusion (H2(15)O), and autonomic tone (11-C-hydroxyephedrine) should facilitate further understanding of the pathogenesis of the cardiomyopathies. 
Complications following external beam radiation therapy for prostate cancer: an analysis of patients treated with and without staging pelvic lymphadenectomy. We reviewed the treatment morbidity associated with definitive high energy external beam radiotherapy in 289 consecutive patients with clinically localized prostate cancer (stages A2 to C) treated from 1984 to 1988 inclusively. All patients were treated with 18 mv. photon beams via a 4-field box technique. Radiation doses ranged from 5,858 to 6,900 cGy., with a mean dose of 6,456 cGy. and a median dose of 6,400 cGy. A total of 65 patients underwent extraperitoneal pelvic staging lymphadenectomy before radiotherapy. Complications noted in 42 patients were mild (generally trivial) in 23 and moderate in 19 (6.6%). There were no severe complications. The actuarial incidence of moderate complications was 9% at 5 years. Only 6 patients experienced symptoms for longer than 6 months. The risk of complications was not increased in patients who had undergone prior lymph node dissection, and only 2 of 65 had mild lymphedema, which resolved in both cases. We conclude that high energy external beam radiation for prostate cancer can be delivered with a low risk of serious complications, even in patients who have undergone extraperitoneal staging pelvic lymphadenectomy, provided the patients are treated to limited fields with high energy photons and at doses limited to 6,800 cGy. or less. 
Favorable response to parenteral nutrition and medical therapy in Crohn's colitis. A report of 38 patients comparing severe Crohn's and ulcerative colitis. The courses of 38 patients with severe, uncomplicated acute colitis (16 with Crohn's colitis and 22 with ulcerative colitis) were analyzed retrospectively. The patients were placed on total parenteral nutrition and treated concomitantly with corticosteroids, antibiotics (often metronidazole), sulfasalazine, and/or azathioprine. Fifteen of the 16 Crohn's colitis patients were initially managed without surgery. Four patients subsequently relapsed, two responded to reinstituted medical therapy, and two underwent colon resection 2 and 4 years later. Of 22 ulcerative colitis patients, 16 required surgery during the initial hospitalization, one patient subsequently had surgery, and one died after refusing surgery. Three of the other four continue in remission on medical therapy. Thus, there were significant differences in this series between the clinical courses of severe ulcerative colitis and severe Crohn's colitis. While most of the ulcerative colitis patients with severe disease underwent colectomy, most of the patients with severe but uncomplicated Crohn's colitis responded to aggressive medical therapy, of which total parenteral nutrition and perhaps bowel rest seemed to be an important part. Afterwards, the majority remained in remission on long-term medical therapy. 
Combined intertrochanteric and Chiari pelvic osteotomies for hip dysplasia. Thirty-two dysplastic hips with secondary osteoarthritis, in 28 patients aged 18 to 42 years, were treated by combined intertrochanteric and Chiari osteotomy. They were followed up for 2.5 to 10 years. Pain was the main presenting symptom in all the patients. The indication for surgery was based on the severity of disease with respect to congruency, secondary degenerative change and degree of dysplasia. The average pre-operative Harris hip score was 47.7 and the majority had severe dysplasia with degenerative changes. On final review the average score was 88. The radiographic appearances of degenerative arthritis regressed in 72% of hips and dysplasia was improved in all cases. The results of this conservative form of surgery are better in hips with less severe dysplasia and mild secondary degenerative change. 
Familial aggregation of nasopharyngeal carcinoma and other malignancies. A clinicopathologic description. Nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) occurred in five members in three generations of a white American family of Scandinavian descent. Six other family members had malignancies including malignant melanoma, malignant lymphoma, squamous cell carcinoma of the tongue, adenocarcinoma of the colon, and asynchronous bilateral in situ and invasive ductal carcinomas of the breast. There was also a history of autoimmune disorders and exposure to smoke, fumes, and chemicals in some family members. Regression analysis revealed a significant covariate risk for exposure to smoking, alcohol ingestion, dust, salted or spicy foods, and poorly ventilated conditions. According to segregation analysis, the susceptibility to nasopharyngeal carcinoma and other malignancies in this family was transmitted as an autosomal codominant characteristic. A specific histocompatibility antigen (HLA) haplotype of A1-B37-DR6 was associated with a predisposition for NPC, but no linkage was identified. Laboratory studies in selected family members did not reveal significantly elevated levels of Epstein-Barr virus antibodies or serum carcinoembryonic antigen. No specific karyotypic abnormalities were identified with peripheral blood chromosome analysis. This family was an example of apparent autosomal codominant susceptibility to NPC and other malignancies. The relationship of malignancy to the HLA haplotype of A1-B37-DR6, autoimmune disorders, and cytogenetic abnormalities was intriguing but not defined clearly. 
Glial contribution to seizure: carbonic anhydrase activity in epileptic mammalian brain. The activity of carbonic anhydrase (CA), a glial enzyme, was measured in the epileptic cortex of audiogenic DBA/2 mice and of cats with a freeze lesion. In mice, the activity increased with age from birth to 24 days, but were always higher in audiogenic mice than in normal C57/BL mice, reflecting species differences. The difference between the two strains increased sharply from 25 to 40 days of age, after the period of maximal audiogenic susceptibility. Acetazolamide, a CA-specific inhibitor, greatly decreased the seizure severity score of DBA/2 mice after a single intraperitoneal (i.p.) administration (150 mg/kg). After 24 days of age, when CA activities were high, the effect of acetazolamide was less important, suggesting that the increased cortical CA activity might reflect a protective mechanism. In cats with a freeze lesion, no significant changes in CA activities were observed in the actively discharging primary and secondary foci as compared with the nonepileptogenic perifocal cortex and the control cortex of sham-operated animals. The results indicate that the cortex of genetically susceptible audiogenic mice has an increased CA activity. The hypothesis of an adaptive glial mechanism, relating to the age-dependent decrease of seizure susceptibility in DBA/2 mice, is postulated. 
Hilar and mediastinal lymphadenopathy in the limited form of Wegener's granulomatosis. A patient with the limited form of Wegener's granulomatosis is reported. The case is unusual because of hilar and mediastinal lymphadenopathy, severe ulceration of the respiratory and digestive tracts, and the rapidly fatal outcome. 
Revascularization of infarcted vs. viable myocardium. Effects on symptoms, physical performance and global/regional left ventricular function. Symptoms, physical performance and global vs. regional left ventricular (LV) function were reviewed in 25 patients with postinfarction anterior-apical akinesia and minor dyskinesia who subsequently underwent revascularization of all graftable stenotic vessels. The observed postoperative improvement in functional NYHA capacity and physical performance was not related to significant change in any systolic or diastolic variable of global LV function. 'Nonspecific postoperative septal hypokinesia' developed in most cases. The regional ejection fraction showed slight (nonsignificant) mean increase in the infarcted apex and low anterior wall supplied by the left anterior descending artery, but marked increase in the noninfarcted lateral wall supplied by the left circumflex branch. Hearts with grafted left circumflex artery showed on average lower preoperative and postoperative ejection fraction in the lateral wall than did hearts without such grafting, but the rise in regional ejection fraction was significant only after left circumflex grafting. The clinical response to coronary artery surgery is attributed mainly to functional improvement of non-infarcted myocardium. Revascularization of viable myocardium occurs directly via bypass grafts, but collateral vessels may also contribute. 
A 2-year experience with the Wolf piezoelectric lithotripter: impact of repeat treatment on results and complications. During a 2-year period, 884 extracorporeal piezoelectric lithotripsy treatments have been performed on stones in 388 renal units (kidney and upper ureter) using a Wolf Piezolith device.* Lithotripsy routinely was performed on an outpatient basis without use of anesthesia or premedication. Often, the maximum number of pulses allowable by a Food and Drug Administration protocol (4,000) was delivered and retreatments frequently occurred on successive days. Of the patients 75% were stone-free 3 months after treatment, while another 20% had only residual small fragments. No intrarenal or perinephric hematomas were observed and only 1 patient has had hypertension requiring medication. Renal colic from passage of stone fragments occurred in only 10% of the patients. An aggressive treatment policy using repeat treatments as necessary provides for superior results with this device without an incision or complication. 
Torticollis in children. Torticollis is a common clinical sign that is found in a variety of disorders. Childhood torticollis differs from the adult form in that congenital types are common and many frequently encountered disorders found in adults are unusual. Pediatric torticollis related to otolaryngologic conditions is reviewed, and three illustrative cases are presented. 
Serum-erythropoietin concentration during acute cardiogenic pulmonary edema. Reduced oxygen tension is regarded as the primary physiologic signal for the production of erythropoietin (EPO). There is little information available about early changes of EPO production in man due to severe hypoxia. The purpose of the present study was to examine the time course of EPO in serum of patients with acute cardiogenic pulmonary edema (ACPE). In 29 patients (seventy-five +/- six years, mean age +/- SEM) who were hospitalized within two hours after onset of symptoms of ACPE, serum EPO concentrations were monitored for up to seventy-two hours. At the moment of admission all patients showed significantly increased EPO concentrations of 121 +/- 64 mU/mL (mean +/- SEM) compared with a healthy population (15-35 mU/mL). Twenty-three patients who recovered within thirty minutes (group A) exhibited a quick return of their EPO serum levels to normal. The remaining 6 patients (group B) had a protracted clinical course and their EPO concentration showed a further increase up to the end of the observation period. The comparative monitoring of concentrations of alpha-1-proteinase inhibitor, antithrombin III, C-reactive protein, fibronectin, hapotoglobin, and transerrin in serum and plasma revealed no significant changes. Thus a major contribution of fluid shifts into or from the intravascular compartment to the observed changes in EPO concentration seems to be unlikely. The data suggest that the production and release of EPO in the kidneys due to altered oxygen delivery is a fast-responding mechanism. 
Effect of surgery on the systemic inflammatory response to intermittent claudication The hypothesis that intermittent claudication initiates a systemic inflammatory response was investigated by studying the effect of exercise on markers of neutrophil activation and vascular permeability in 25 claudicants and 10 controls. Urinary albumin excretion, previously demonstrated to reflect vascular permeability, increased significantly after exercise in claudicants and was associated with decreased neutrophil filterability and increased serum lysozyme activity. No similar exercise-induced changes were seen in controls or in claudicants after successful arterial bypass surgery. These results suggest that intermittent claudication is associated with potentially deleterious systemic manifestations that are surgically reversible. 
Temporal arteritis: an atypical presentation. Temporal (giant cell) arteritis is a systemic granulomatous vasculitis primarily involving branches of the carotid arteries in patients aged 50 years and greater. Its classic symptoms and signs are headache and elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), but this is not the only presentation. This case is the first reported in a Korean, whose chief complaint was pain in the tongue and headaches and whose ESR was normal. The diagnosis was confirmed by biopsy. Her symptoms abated when treated with prednisone, but she developed diabetes mellitus, osteoporosis, and compression fracture of lumbar vertebrae while being treated. Primary physicians should become aware of the atypical features of this disease, as well as the potential complications of treatment. 
Pre-travel health, immunization status, and demographics of travel to the developing world for individuals visiting a travel medicine service. It is estimated that five million Americans will travel to the developing world over the next year. This study examines the demographic profile, past medical and immunization history, itinerary, and reason for travel of 2, 445 travelers to the developing world seen at a travel medicine service from 1984 through 1989. The travelers age ranged from three months to 85 years (mean age 43). A chronic medical condition was reported by 654 (27%). Four percent of all travelers were intolerant of sulfonamides, and 9% had contraindications to mefloquine for malaria prophylaxis. Many travelers were due to receive the primary series or updatings of routinely recommended immunizations: 43% for tetanus/diphtheria, 55% of those born after 1956 for measles, and 70% for polio if their travel itinerary included a polio risk. Most travel (71%) was for vacations, 13% was for teaching or study, 11% for business, and 5% for missionary activities. The median duration of travel was 21 days; 5% traveled for more than one year. While over 150 countries were visited, 52% of all travel was to 10 countries in East Africa, the Indian subcontinent, the Far East, and South America. Information about the epidemiology of travel to the developing world can help physicians and travel medicine services develop more effective preventive measures for travelers. 
A review of current drugs for migraine. The current treatments available for migraine are reviewed and may be classified into four basic types. (a) Identification and elimination of migraine trigger factors, which include stress, emotions, fatigue, certain foods and beverages, and certain medications such as oestrogen therapy. (b) Symptomatic treatment of individual attacks. This includes various non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), including aspirin and paracetamol, and ergotamine, dihydroergotamine and phenothiazines. Morphinomimetics, which are often given for migraine, should really be avoided. (c) Prophylactic treatment which is particularly recommended for patients averaging two or more severe migraine attacks per month. Useful drugs include: beta-adrenergic receptor blockers as first choice, e.g. propranolol, timolol, nadolol and metoprolol; 5-hydroxytryptamine blockers, e.g. pizotifen and methysergide; calcium channel blockers; dihydroergotamine; and NSAIDs. (d) Non-drug treatment which is best combined with identification and elimination of trigger factors, and the use of various relaxation techniques. These four treatment types are covered in some detail, however it is clear that none of them is ideal and side-effects present a problem. Clearly, the continued research and development of novel and specific drugs for migraine is vital. 
Simulation of compartment syndrome by rupture of the deep femoral artery from blunt trauma. Life-threatening hemorrhage of the femoral vasculature from a blunt injury to the thigh without femoral fracture has not been emphasized in the medical literature. Two cases of massive hemorrhage from the deep femoral system resulted from blunt injury to the thigh without femoral fracture. In the first case, a diagnosis of compartment syndrome was based on muscle swelling from the blunt trauma. A fasciotomy uncovered life-threatening bleeding. In the second case, which had a similar history and clinical symptoms, a vascular injury was suspected and an arteriogram was done. Disruption of the deep femoral arterial system was detected, and fluoroscopic embolization controlled the bleeding. A routine fasciotomy was then done. Both patients appeared clinically to have a thigh compartment syndrome, presumably based on injury from the crushed muscle. They both had normal arterial pulsations distal to the injured thigh. The only feature that suggested a vascular injury was a need for transfusion for hemodynamic support in excess of apparent blood loss. Arteriography, with embolization if necessary, is advised for all cases of suspected thigh compartment syndrome in which there is an unexplained need for hemodynamic support by transfusion. 
Porous-coated anatomic total knee arthroplasty. A prospective analysis comparing cemented and cementless fixation. The results of 26 cementless porous-coated anatomic (PCA) total knee arthroplasties (TKAs) were analyzed and compared to 25 cemented PCA TKAs. Identical prospective protocols were followed. The mean preoperative and postoperative knee scores at an average three-year follow-up interval (range, two to five years) were 59.6 and 81.5 for cementless knees compared to 57.6 and 80.4 for cemented knees. The difference was not statistically significant (p greater than 0.10). Blood loss was significantly higher in the cementless knees (p = 0.02). Radiolucent lines, loose beads, and tibial component subsidence were more frequent in cementless knees. No differences between cementless and cemented knees were observed in the femoral components. The PCA femoral components implanted without cement compare favorably to those implanted with cement. The PCA tibial and patellar components are more reliably secured with cement. 
Expression of a mitogen-responsive gene encoding prostaglandin synthase is regulated by mRNA splicing. Rous sarcoma virus was shown to induce in chicken embryo fibroblasts (CEF) a 4.1-kilobase mRNA (designated CEF-147) encoding a 603-amino acid protein. Analysis of the protein sequence showed that it shared 59% amino acid identity with sheep prostaglandin G/H synthase, the enzyme that catalyzes the rate-limiting steps in the production of prostaglandins. Significant differences, at both the protein and mRNA levels, existed between the src oncogene product-inducible prostaglandin synthase and the protein isolated and cloned from sheep seminal vesicle, suggesting that the src-inducible prostaglandin synthase may be a new form of the enzyme. A distinguishing feature of src-inducible prostaglandin synthase mRNA is its low abundance in nonproliferating chicken embryo fibroblasts and its relatively high abundance in src-transformed cells. Additionally, the majority of the src-inducible prostaglandin synthase RNA present in nonproliferating cells was found to be nonfunctional because of the presence of an unspliced intron that separated the signal peptide from the remainder of the protein. Upon mitogenic stimulation, this intron was removed, resulting in the induction of fully-spliced CEF-147 mRNA. 
A pair of monozygotic twins who are concordant for myasthenia gravis but became discordant for systemic lupus erythematosus post-thymectomy. We describe a pair of monozygotic twins who are concordant for myasthenia gravis but discordant for systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). SLE developed in twin 1 18 years post-thymectomy and has been characterized by recurrent transverse myelitis and optic neuritis. Twin 2 remains well post-thymectomy, except for a skin rash and persistent leukopenia. Both twins have developed autoimmune thyroid disease. We review genetic and environmental factors of importance in the pathogenesis of SLE and discuss the possible role of thymectomy in the etiology of the disease. 
Cause of death in patients attending multiple sclerosis clinics. Between 1972 and 1988, 145 deaths occurred among 3,126 patients attending the Multiple Sclerosis (MS) Clinics in Vancouver, British Columbia (N = 1,583), and London, Ontario (N = 1,543). We could determine the exact cause of death in 82.1% of cases (119 of 145). Of the 119 patients for whom the cause of death was known, 56 deaths (47.1%) were directly attributed to complications of MS. Of the remaining 63 deaths, 18 (28.6%) were suicides, 19 (30.2%) were due to malignancy, 13 (20.6%) to an acute myocardial infarction, seven (11.1%) to stroke, and the remainder (9.5%) to miscellaneous causes, of which two may have been suicides. The proportion of suicides among MS deaths was 7.5 times that for the age-matched general population, and the proportion of MS deaths from malignancy was 0.67 times that for the age-matched general population. The proportion of deaths due to malignancy and stroke was the same for the MS patients and the age-matched general population. 
Tissue plasminogen activator for the treatment of thromboembolism in infants and children. We report our experience with the use of tissue plasminogen activator to treat 12 infants and children with various thromboembolic states after conventional thrombolytic agents had failed. The dosage range was between 0.1 to 0.5 mg/kg per hour. Complete clot dissolution occurred in seven cases after 2 hours to 3 days of therapy. Partial clot dissolution and clinical improvement were noted in another four patients. Bleeding complications were noted in 6 of the 12 patients and included bruising, oozing from various venipuncture sites, and bleeding; these complications were controlled by clinically available means. In all cases with bleeding the dose rate was in the higher range (0.46 to 0.50 mg/kg per hour). In one patient, restlessness, agitation, and screaming were noted during administration of tissue plasminogen activator and when it was reinstituted. We conclude that tissue plasminogen activator is effective in inducing clot lysis in children. Because the effective dose appears to overlap with those causing bleeding, we recommend that a dose of 0.1 mg/kg per hour be started and increased gradually if clot dissolution does not occur, with close monitoring for bleeding. 
Quality of life after bypass surgery for unstable angina. 5-year follow-up results of a Veterans Affairs Cooperative Study To assess the effect of bypass surgery on outcome from unstable angina, 468 patients were randomized to medical treatment (237 patients) or surgery plus medical treatment (231 patients) and have been followed for comparison of survival, cardiac end points, and quality of life; the latter end point is discussed in the present report. Data were available at 3 and 5 years for 80% and 82% of patients in the medical group, respectively, and 77% and 80% of patients in the surgery group, respectively. At 3 months after randomization to therapy, 79.8% of patients in the surgery group reported subjective improvement, compared with 58% of the medical group, 12.6% of the surgery group reported no change compared with 24.5% of the medical group, and 5.5% of the surgery group reported worsening compared with 24.5% of the medical group (p less than 0.01 by chi 2). Similar data were found for chest pain status, and the benefit to the surgery group remained statistically significant through 5 years of follow-up. Crossover rate to surgery was 43% by 5 years. Treadmill duration was increased in the surgery group compared with the medical group (6.5 +/- 0.25 versus 5.3 +/- 0.25 minutes at 6 months, p less than 0.01), and a significant difference was again demonstrated at 3 and 5 years. A trend toward decreased recurrence of unstable angina was present in the surgery group at 1 year (six of 168 [3.6%] versus 13 of 187 [6.9%] in the medical group, p = 0.158), but the two groups were similar at 3 and 5 years. 
Hearing aid evaluation and fitting. Although many patients with hearing loss benefit from medical or surgical intervention, the vast majority have noncorrectable hearing disorders for which rehabilitation through amplification is indicated. There are three goals for the application of hearing aids: (1) to amplify normal conversational speech to levels that are maximally understandable to the patient; (2) to help the patient hear other environmental sounds; and (3) to assist in the educational or habilitative process for those children who sustain hearing loss prior to language and speech development. In addition, there are certain issues that require medical consideration when a wearable device is placed in the ear. This article describes current hearing aid technology; reviews its benefits, limitations, and application for typical patients; discusses the medical aspects of hearing aid fitting; and describes new hearing aid technology on the horizon. 
Androgen receptor gene mutations in X-linked spinal and bulbar muscular atrophy. X-linked spinal and bulbar muscular atrophy (Kennedy's disease) is an adult-onset form of motorneuron disease which may be associated with signs of androgen insensitivity. We have now investigated whether the androgen receptor gene on the proximal long arm of the X chromosome is a candidate gene for this disease. In patient samples we found androgen receptor gene mutations with increased size of a polymorphic tandem CAG repeat in the coding region. These amplified repeats were absolutely associated with the disease, being present in 35 unrelated patients and none of 75 controls. They segregated with the disease in 15 families, with no recombination in 61 meioses (the maximum log likelihood ratio (lod score) is 13.2 at a recombination rate of 0). The association is unlikely to be due to linkage disequilibrium, because 11 different disease alleles were observed. We conclude that enlargement of the CAG repeat in the androgen receptor gene is probably the cause of this disorder. 
High energy underwater shock wave treatment on implanted urinary bladder cancer in rabbits. The effects of focused high energy shock waves (SW) on the implanted urinary bladder cancer in rabbits were examined. The bladder cancer was exposed to 2000 to 8000 shots of focused SW under ultrasound guidance. Although only focal necrosis of the tumor was seen in the one day SW exposure, wider and deeper tumor necrosis was observed in the tumors following serial SW (2000 to 6000 shots, for two to three days). Eight to 10 day serial SW exposure (6000 to 8000 shots) decreased the tumor growth in comparison with that of the control. Lung metastases examined by periodic chest X-ray after SW treatment revealed that SW did not promote lung metastases. Pathological findings were also in accord with the X-ray examinations. Polyclonal antibody type 4 collagen was used for immunohistochemical staining of vascular wall in bladder cancer. Vascular wall destruction, not found in spontaneous necrotic tumor, were clearly visible in SW induced necrotic area. SW induces vascular damage in the tumor, which may be the primary cause promoting the tumor necrosis. 
Tinnitus. Tinnitus, a common complaint, reportedly affects more than 37 million Americans. Most often, it is associated with a sensorineural hearing loss in the high-frequency range. Tinnitus, however, is a symptom and not a disease. Complacency about this symptom complex may cause physicians to overlook a severe underlying pathologic process. Patients with unilateral tinnitus, pulsatile tinnitus, fluctuating tinnitus, or tinnitus associated with vertigo should undergo thorough assessment, including elicitation of a complete history, physical examination, and audiologic analysis. In many instances, treatment is effective. Masking of tinnitus, medical therapy, and biofeedback and counseling are some measures that have been used in the management of tinnitus. 
Comparison of a single layer continuous hand-sewn method and circular stapling in 580 oesophageal anastomoses. A total of 611 patients with carcinoma of the oesophagus or gastric cardia were operated on between July 1982 and December 1989. Resection was performed in 491 patients (one-stage, 483; two-stage, eight), bypass operation in 97, and 23 had exploration alone. The anastomoses of 580 patients with one-stage resection and bypass operations were evaluated. Hand-sewn anastomosis using a single layer of continuous absorbable monofilament suture was performed in 304 patients (221 resections and 83 bypasses). A stapled anastomosis was performed on 276 patients (262 resections and 14 bypasses). Following resection, there were 11 (5 per cent) anastomotic leaks in the hand-sewn group and ten (3.8 per cent) in the stapled anastomosis group (P = 0.69). Excluding anastomotic leaks, hospital mortality and anastomotic recurrence, stricture occurred in 18 of 172 hand-sewn anastomoses (10.5 per cent) and in 57 of 195 stapled anastomoses (29.2 per cent) (P less than 0.001). In patients who had bypass operations there were 12 anastomotic leaks, ten in the hand-sewn group (12.0 per cent) and two in the stapled anastomosis group (14.3 per cent). Only two of the discharged patients with bypass developed anastomotic strictures, a low incidence probably because of short survival. In addition, there were 245 subsidiary anastomoses made in the abdomen by the hand-sewn method as part of the reconstructive procedure, and there was one leak. The results of this non-randomized study suggest that hand-sewn anastomosis using a single layer continuous technique for the oesophagus is as safe as the use of circular staplers; hand-sewn anastomosis is less likely to become stenotic. 
Allele loss at the retinoblastoma locus in human ovarian cancer. To gain a broad spectrum on allelic loss of specific loci in ovarian tumors, we initially examined DNA from 23 pairs of ovarian tumors and matched peripheral blood lymphocyte samples from the same patients, using 27 polymorphic DNA markers distributed on 13 chromosomes. Significant high frequency of allelic deletion (22%-44%) at chromosome 13 loci (D13S31, D13S32, D13S33, and D13S34) at bands q12-q34 was observed in tumor tissues. These results led us to investigate the loss of heterozygosity at the retinoblastoma (RB) locus in ovarian tumors, because the RB gene is a tumor-suppressor gene located at 13q14. Analysis of the variable number of tandem repeat sequence polymorphism in intron 20 in the RB gene revealed that 6 (30%) of 20 patients with informative samples showed allelic loss at the RB locus in their tumor tissues. This loss, of relatively high frequency, suggests that the RB gene, or a closely linked gene, seems to be involved in the development of ovarian cancer. 
Radioiodinated 1-(5-iodo-5-deoxy-beta-D-arabinofuranosyl)-2-nitroimidazole (iodoazomycin arabinoside: IAZA): a novel marker of tissue hypoxia. 1-(5-Iodo-5-deoxy-beta-D-arabinofuranosyl)-2-nitroimidazole (IAZA) has been synthesised and labeled with 125I. Radioiodinated IAZA was shown to undergo hypoxia-dependent binding in EMT-6 cells in vitro and to have an initial binding rate of 284 pmole/10(6) cells/hr at a substrate concentration of 30 microM. This binding rate is more than three times that of the reference compound, misonidazole (89 pmole/10(6) cells/hr). The elevated binding rate was accompanied by in vitro cytotoxicity 30-40 times greater than that observed for misonidazole. Whole-body elimination and biodistribution studies in BALB/c mice bearing implanted, subcutaneous EMT-6 tumors showed a rapid excretion (greater than 98% in 24 hr) with moderate tissue levels which, in general, declined as a function of blood clearance. Tumor-to-blood ratios of 4.6 (4 hr) and 8.7 (8 hr), with respective tumor uptake values of 2.08% and 1.22% ID/g of tissue, form a rational basis for evaluation of this and related 2-nitroimidazole analogs as radiopharmaceuticals suitable for scintigraphic evaluation of tissue (tumor) hypoxia. 
Gynecologic cytology. Practical considerations and limitations. Diagnostic problems arise as a result of overlap of cytologic criteria of some squamous and glandular lesions of the female genital tract, lack of experience, or an overzealous attempt to interpret some features. This article emphasizes the role and limitations of cytology in the diagnosis of neoplasia and preneoplasia of squamous and glandular elements of the uterus. Sampling techniques greatly influence the pathologist's ability to interpret the material. The classifications and cytologic features of preneoplastic and neoplastic squamous and glandular epithelia, including the new Bethesda System for reporting, are reviewed. Problems in interpretation, particularly of nondysplastic conditions that mimic true neoplasia, and reasons for false-negative and false-positive results are discussed. 
Amnestic effects in mice of four synthetic peptides homologous to amyloid beta protein from patients with Alzheimer disease. Immediate post-training intracerebroventricular administration of a synthetic peptide homologous to beta protein of brain amyloid, [Gln11]beta-(1-28), caused amnesia for footshock active avoidance training in mice in a dose-dependent fashion. This effect was specific to memory processing since the peptide did not cause amnesia when injected 24 hr after training nor did it disturb storage or retrieval of older memories. Shorter fragments of the amyloid beta protein consisting of residues 12-28, 18-28, and 12-20 also were amnestic when given intracerebroventricularly, residues 12-20 being least effective. The hippocampus, a brain structure importantly involved in learning and memory, consistently shows severe pathological changes and deposition of amyloid in patients with Alzheimer disease. Immediate post-training bilateral intrahippocampal injection of [Gln11]beta-(1-28) produced amnesia at much lower doses than did [Gln11]beta-(1-28) injected intracerebroventricularly. Thus these experimental results suggest a possible direct role of amyloid beta protein or fragments thereof in an aspect of the spectrum of cognitive deficit in Alzheimer disease. 
Caffeine self-administration, withdrawal, and adverse effects among coffee drinkers. Twenty-two coffee drinkers (three to seven cups per day) underwent repeated double-blind trials to test for caffeine self-administration, withdrawal, and adverse effects. Each trial consisted first of a randomized crossover period of 1 day of decaffeinated coffee and 1 day of caffeinated coffee (100 mg) to assess withdrawal and adverse effects of caffeine. Next, subjects were given 2 days of concurrent access to the two coffees. The relative use of the two coffees was used to assess caffeine self-administration. Reliable caffeine self-administration occurred in three of 10 subjects in study 1 and seven of 12 subjects in study 2. Withdrawal symptoms were headaches, drowsiness, and fatigue. The major adverse effect from self-administration was tremulousness. The occurrence of headaches on substitution of decaffeinated coffee prospectively predicted subsequent self-administration of caffeine. These results indicate that some coffee drinkers exhibit signs of a caffeine dependence, ie, they self-administer coffee for the effects of caffeine, have withdrawal symptoms on cessation, and experience adverse effects. 
Five-day bismuth-free triple therapy for the eradication of Helicobacter pylori and reduction of duodenal ulcer relapse. Previous studies have demonstrated that the eradication of Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) is associated with a significant reduction of the rate of duodenal ulcer (DU) relapse. The aim of this study was to assess the long-term effect of a bismuth-free triple therapy on the eradication of H. pylori and reduction of DU relapse. After informed consent, 61 patients with endoscopically proven DU and H. pylori infection detected on 14C-urea breath test (BT) were included in the study. All patients received a combination of furazolidone, amoxicillin, and metronidazole, three times a day, for 5 days, in addition to eventual classical antiulcer agents prescribed by their attending physicians. BT was repeated after an interval of at least 60 days to evaluate H. pylori eradication. Endoscopy and another BT were performed again at 6.5 months after therapy to detect possible recurrences. Forty-eight patients completed the trial: 26 (54%) patients were negative for H. pylori at 6.5 months after the end of treatment, and 22 (46%) persisted H. pylori positive. Ninety-two percent of the patients in whom the bacteria were eradicated showed endoscopically healed ulcers and were asymptomatic, and two that were symptomatic presented only occasional pain not requiring therapy. Among the 22 patients who persisted H. pylori positive, six (27%) showed endoscopically active ulcers (p = 0.012) and eight (36%) patients continued to be symptomatic (p less than 0.01), and were still using antiulcer drugs (p = 0.002) 6.5 months after treatment. It is concluded that combined treatment with furazolidone, amoxicillin, and metronidazole for 5 days represents a well-tolerated, inexpensive, and effective therapeutic regime for the eradication of H. pylori and abolition of DU relapse in more than 50% of the patients during a follow-up period of 6.5 months. 
Plasmapheresis does not increase the risk for infection in immunosuppressed patients with severe lupus nephritis. The Lupus Nephritis Collaborative Study Group. OBJECTIVE: To determine whether plasmapheresis increases the risk for infection in immunosuppressed patients. DESIGN: Randomized, controlled trial. SETTING: Multicenter. PATIENTS: Eighty-six patients enrolled in a trial of plasmapheresis for severe diffuse proliferative lupus nephritis. INTERVENTIONS: Forty-six of the patients received high-dose steroid therapy plus cyclophosphamide therapy for 8 weeks. Thereafter, cyclophosphamide therapy was discontinued, and steroid therapy was tapered (standard treatment group). Forty patients received identical treatment and had 12 plasmapheresis procedures during the first 4 weeks of the treatment. MEASUREMENTS: Patients were examined for the development of infection. MAIN RESULTS: No statistical difference in age, sex, race, serum creatinine level, proteinuria, or complement levels was found between the two groups. Over a follow-up period of 5376 patient-weeks, 74% of patients in the standard treatment group had 62 infections, yielding an aggregate infection rate of 1.15 infections per 100 weeks (median individual infection rate, 1.08; 25th and 75th percentiles, 0.0 and 2.44). This rate was comparable to that seen in the plasmapheresis-treated patients who were followed for 4187 patient-weeks: 68% had 51 infections, for an aggregate infection rate of 1.22 infections per 100 weeks (median individual infection rate, 0.94; 25th and 75th percentiles, 0.0 and 2.32). The infection rate was also comparable in the initial acute phase of the study, despite the fact that patients who received plasmapheresis then had significantly lower immunoglobulin (IgG) levels (P less than 0.001). Neither the site (superficial compared with systemic) nor the nature (conventional compared with unconventional) of infection differed statistically between the two groups. Of 14 patient deaths, 7 were from infection (4 in control group and 3 in the plasmapheresis group). CONCLUSION: Plasmapheresis did not increase the risk for infection in immunosuppressed patients with severe lupus nephritis. 
Anti-tumor activities of immunotoxins made of monoclonal antibody B3 and various forms of Pseudomonas exotoxin [published erratum appears in Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A 1991 Jun 1;88(11):5066] B3 is a monoclonal antibody that reacts with a carbohydrate epitope present on a variety of proteins located on the surface of many cancer cells and a limited number of normal tissues. We evaluated the cytotoxic activity of immunotoxins composed of monoclonal antibody B3 coupled to native Pseudomonas exotoxin (PE) or two recombinant forms of Pseudomonas exotoxin, PEArg57 or LysPE40, a form of PE with a deletion of the cell binding domain. All three conjugates were cytotoxic to human cell lines expressing the B3 antigen on their surface. The survival of each of the three immunotoxins in the circulation of mice was determined after administering the immunotoxin i.v. The half-life in blood of B3-PE and B3-PEArg57 was 20 hr, whereas the half-life of B3-LysPE40 was 4 hr. The short half-life of B3-LysPE40 may be due to the absence of domain I of PE. To determine the therapeutic effects of the three immunotoxins, they were given intraperitoneally to nude mice bearing subcutaneous A431 tumors. All three immunotoxins caused complete regression of 50-mm3 tumors with no toxic effects to the animals at therapeutic doses. Furthermore, substantial regression was also noted with much larger tumors. Our data indicate that the monoclonal antibody B3, when coupled to PE or recombinant forms of PE, may be useful for the treatment of tumors expressing B3 antigen. The therapeutic window was largest with B3-LysPE40, which can be administered in higher doses because it lacks sequences in domain I of PE that enable PE to bind to nontarget cells. 
Prognostic impact of stress testing in coronary artery disease. Observational data prospectively collected permit the examination of a complex set of decisions, including the decision not to perform any stress testing. Patients with or without previous myocardial infarction admitted for coronary evaluation and not submitted to any stress testing because of clinical reasons are at a higher risk for subsequent death. For prognostication, no test has been better validated than exercise electrocardiography: it can identify patients at low and high risk for future cardiac events among those without symptoms, with typical chest pain, and with previous myocardial infarction. In patients with triple-vessel disease, the results of exercise also allow those at low and high risk to be recognized. Both exercise radionuclide angiography and 201Tl scintigraphy (the latter in larger patient populations) have also demonstrated significant prognostic value on patients with or without previous myocardial infarction. Neither one has shown superiority to the other in prognostication. So far, they have been considered the only viable alternatives to exercise electrocardiography stress testing for diagnosis and prognostication. However, their costs limit their extensive application. Preliminary data suggest that intravenous dipyridamole echocardiography can be used for both diagnosis and prognostication of coronary artery disease; moreover, the prognostic information derived from dipyridamole echocardiography testing seems independent of and additive to that provided by exercise electrocardiography. Further prospective studies on larger patient populations are needed to better define the prognostic value of dipyridamole echocardiography testing. 
Intermittent torsion: association with horizontal lie of the testicle. The importance of making an early diagnosis of intermittent testicular torsion cannot be over-emphasized. We report on 3 patients with recurrent episodes of severe testicular pain but who were pain-free at evaluation. All 3 patients were found to have a horizontal lie of the symptomatic testicle and a normal vertical axis in the contralateral asymptomatic testicle. Scrotal exploration revealed a bell-clapper deformity in all 3 patients. A history of recurrent scrotal pain and horizontal testicular lie, even in the absence of pain at the time of physical examination, is a strong indication for exploration and bilateral testicular fixation. 
Characteristics of cirrhosis undiagnosed during life: a comparative analysis of 73 undiagnosed cases and 149 diagnosed cases of cirrhosis, detected in 4929 consecutive autopsies. In 4929 consecutive autopsies performed during a period of 4 years, 222 cases (4.5%) of cirrhosis were found, of which 149 (3%) were detected while the patients were alive (diagnosed cirrhosis) and 73 (1.5%) were not detected while the patients were living (undiagnosed cirrhosis). Fifty-three of the 73 undiagnosed patients appeared to be completely without signs of cirrhosis (silent cirrhosis). In the diagnosed group, 70% of patients died from hepatic causes, in contrast to 16% in the undiagnosed group. At autopsy, the following complications of cirrhosis were found more frequently in the diagnosed group than in the undiagnosed group: ascites (41% vs. 8%), oesophageal varices (44% vs. 10%), splenomegaly (52% vs. 29%). The prevalence of hepatocellular carcinoma did not differ significantly in the two groups (12% vs. 8%). It is concluded that cirrhosis without obvious signs occurs relatively frequently, and that no sensitive non-invasive screening methods are available at present. 
Modeling: optimal marathon performance on the basis of physiological factors. This paper examines current concepts concerning "limiting" factors in human endurance performance by modeling marathon running times on the basis of various combinations of previously reported values of maximal O2 uptake (VO2max), lactate threshold, and running economy in elite distance runners. The current concept is that VO2max sets the upper limit for aerobic metabolism while the blood lactate threshold is related to the fraction of VO2max that can be sustained in competitive events greater than approximately 3,000 m. Running economy then appears to interact with VO2max and blood lactate threshold to determine the actual running speed at lactate threshold, which is generally a speed similar to (or slightly slower than) that sustained by individual runners in the marathon. A variety of combinations of these variables from elite runners results in estimated running times that are significantly faster than the current world record (2:06:50). The fastest time for the marathon predicted by this model is 1:57:58 in a hypothetical subject with a VO2max of 84 ml.kg-1.min-1, a lactate threshold of 85% of VO2max, and exceptional running economy. This analysis suggests that substantial improvements in marathon performance are "physiologically" possible or that current concepts regarding limiting factors in endurance running need additional refinement and empirical testing. 
Prospective study of alcohol consumption and risk of coronary disease in men. Although an inverse association between alcohol consumption and risk of coronary artery disease has been consistently found in several types of studies, some have argued that the association is due at least partly to the inclusion in the non-drinking reference group of men who abstain because of pre-existing disease. The association between self-reported alcohol intake and coronary disease was studied prospectively among 51,529 male health professionals. In 1986 the participants completed questionnaires about food and alcohol intake and medical history, heart disease risk factors, and dietary changes in the previous 10 years. Follow-up questionnaires in 1988 sought information about newly diagnosed coronary disease. 350 confirmed cases of coronary disease occurred. After adjustment for coronary risk factors, including dietary intake of cholesterol, fat, and dietary fibre, increasing alcohol intake was inversely related to coronary disease incidence (p for trend less than 0.001). Exclusion of 10,302 current non-drinkers or 16,342 men with disorders potentially related to coronary disease (eg, hypertension, diabetes, and gout) which might have led men to reduce their alcohol intake, did not substantially affect the relative risks. These findings support the hypothesis that the inverse relation between alcohol consumption and risk of coronary disease is causal. 
EPA in the prevention of restenosis post PTCA. The effect of fish oil on restenosis was evaluated in patients undergoing coronary balloon angioplasty. In addition to routine pharmacotherapy, subjects were given 2.8 g of eicosapentanoic acid (EPA) daily. Treatment was started within twenty-four hours after successful percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA). After six months of therapy, participants were subjected to coronary arteriography, exercise scintigraphy, exercise electrocardiography, or clinical evaluation. Follow-up evaluation involved 97 coronary lesions in 85 patients. Partial or significant restenosis occurred in 36.5% of patients and 33% of vessels. The presence of severe stenosis before PTCA, dissection, thrombus, multilesion PTCA, and template bleeding time values were not correlated with restenosis. Dilation of the left anterior descending (LAD) and a residual stenosis greater than or equal to 35% were associated with restenosis. Approximately 20% of the patients related difficulty in taking the fish oil. Furthermore, these results show no advantage over expected restenosis rates. 
Comparison of CT, low-field-strength MR imaging, and high-field-strength MR imaging. Work in progress. To assess objectively the sensitivity and specificity of low-field-strength (0.064 T) magnetic resonance (MR) imaging, a prospective blind study of 280 examinations was performed to compare low-field-strength MR imaging with computed tomography (CT) and with high-field-strength (1.5-T) MR imaging of the cranium. The sensitivity (defined as the true-positive rate) with high-field MR imaging was superior to that with low-field MR imaging and CT in helping detect overall abnormalities. Sensitivities were generally similar over a broad range of specific cranial central nervous system diseases. Low-field and high-field MR imaging were equivalent in the blind diagnoses of neoplasms and white matter disease, whereas low-field MR and CT were equivalent in the blind diagnoses of contusion, subdural and epidural hematoma, sinus disease, normality, and abnormality. The specificities with low-field MR imaging and CT were substantially better than those with high-field MR imaging. 
Effect of breast implants on mammography. We developed an experimental, reproducible method of evaluating the radiographic characteristics of breast implants in vitro using a mammographic phantom and a cadaver. Implant shells tested included smooth silicone, textured silicone, and silicone coated with polyurethane foam. Each type of shell was subsequently filled with saline, silicone gel, and peanut oil; the images were recorded radiographically. Textured silicone and smooth silicone shells minimally impair detection of artifacts. Polyurethane-coated shells are less radiolucent but allow visualization of some microcalcifications. Saline and silicone-gel-filled implants are radiopaque regardless of shell type. Textured silicone and smooth silicone shells filled with peanut oil are radiolucent and allow visualization of microcalcifications and most soft-tissue masses. These data demonstrate that radiolucent breast implants are possible, and further efforts are under way to achieve Food and Drug Administration approval for clinical testing. 
Substitution of leucine for isoleucine in a sequence highly conserved among retroviral envelope surface glycoproteins attenuates the lytic effect of the Friend murine leukemia virus. Friend murine leukemia virus is a replication-competent retrovirus that contains no oncogene and that exerts lytic and leukemogenic properties. Thus, newborn mice inoculated with Friend murine leukemia virus develop severe early hemolytic anemia before appearance of erythroleukemia. To identify the retroviral determinants regulating these effects, we used chimeric infectious constructions and site-directed point mutations between a virulent Friend murine leukemia virus strain and a naturally occurring variant attenuated in lytic and leukemogenic effects. We found that severe hemolytic anemia was always associated with higher numbers of blood reticulocytes with budding retroviral particles. Furthermore, a remarkably conservative leucine to isoleucine change in the extracellular SU component of the retroviral envelope was sufficient to attenuate this lytic effect. Also, this leucine at position 348 of the envelope precursor protein was located within the only stretch of five amino acids that is conserved in the extracellular SU component of all murine, feline, and primate type C and type D retroviral envelopes. This observation suggested an important structural function for this yet undescribed conserved sequence of the envelope. Lastly, we observed that lytic and leukemogenic effects were attenuated by a deletion of a second repeat in the transcriptional enhancer region of the viral long terminal repeats of the variant strain. 
The causes and complications of late diagnosis of foreign body aspiration in children. Report of 210 cases. Late diagnoses of foreign body aspiration were defined as occurring beyond 3 days between the aspiration of the foreign body, or onset of symptoms, and correct diagnosis. We reviewed a total of 210 children with late diagnosis of foreign body aspiration. The causes creating late diagnosis of foreign body aspiration in children were as follows: (1) parental negligence (106/210, 50%); (2) misdiagnosis by the fellow professionals and pediatricians (39/210, 19%); (3) the normal chest roentgenographic findings (29/210, 14%); (4) lack of typical symptoms and signs (26/210, 12%); (5) mismanagement (8/210, 4%); and (6) a negative bronchoscopic finding (2/210, 1%). The most common complications encountered were obstructive emphysema (77/186, 41%), mediastinal shift (63/186, 34%), pneumonia (43/186, 24%), and atelectasis (33/186, 18%) in 186 patients who underwent a chest roentgenographic examination. The incidence of major complications was 64% (48/75) in the children who were diagnosed within 4 to 7 days; however, the complication rate was 70% (39/56) in those with a delay in diagnosis of 15 to 30 days, and 95% (20/21) in the cases with a delay in diagnosis of over 30 days after aspirating the foreign bodies. 
Mucin-producing tumor of the pancreas. A new pancreatic tumor, called mucin-producing tumor, has received great attention in Japan. These tumors are found inside the pancreatic duct and produce large quantities of copious mucus. The authors examined 22 cases of these tumors histologically and histochemically. In 12 malignant cases, the tumors inside the ducts consisted of cancerous lesions over small areas along with papillary or atypical hyperplasia. Tumors in ten benign cases mainly consisted of papillary hyperplasia. Except for three patients with carcinoma in situ, cancerous tumors infiltrated the pancreatic parenchyma and, in some cases, were observed invading the bile duct or duodenum. A mucous histochemical study showed evidence of sialomucin in malignant cases; neutral mucin was dominant in benign cases. Characteristics of this disease were also compared with 13 cases of mucinous cystic neoplasm. From the results, it was concluded that these two diseases can be classified into the same conceptual category. 
Hormonal therapy before surgical treatment for uterine leiomyomas. Use of GnRH-A offers a promising medical approach to treating uterine leiomyomas. This therapy can be useful in selected patients, preserving fertility by delaying the need for imminent surgical treatment. In selected perimenopausal women, agonist therapy may, in fact, be an alternative to surgical intervention. Shrinking the size of myomas and reducing uterine volume with these agents have been reported to control symptoms of myoma, making myomectomy or vaginal hysterectomy a safer procedure. Used preoperatively, GnRH-A therapy can also reduce the risk of surgical complications and excessive blood loss. 
The effect of ibuprofen on cardiac performance during abdominal aortic cross-clamping. Decreased cardiac output and increased plasma thromboxane have been observed during aortic cross-clamping under general anesthesia. Amelioration of these changes has been reported by preoperative administration of cyclooxygenase inhibitors, but heterogeneity in patients' intravascular volume status has confounded analysis of the drugs' effects in previous studies. We studied hemodynamic conditions in 24 volume-loaded (pulmonary capillary wedge pressure greater than 10 mm Hg) patients undergoing abdominal aortic aneurysm repair under general plus epidural anesthesia, after preoperative double-blind administration of either ibuprofen 800 mg (n = 12) or placebo (n = 12). The hemodynamic response to aortic cross-clamping was similar in both groups. Pulse and mean arterial pressure remained unchanged; cardiac index decreased after aortic cross-clamping from 2.4 +/- 0.1 (mean +/- standard error of the mean [SEM]) to 2.1 +/- 0.1 1/min/m2 in the ibuprofen group and from 2.5 +/- 0.1 to 2.3 +/- 0.2 1/min/m2 in the placebo group (p less than 0.01 versus preclamp values in both groups, multivariate analysis of variance [MANOVA]), but improved after declamping. Both left and right ventricular stroke work indexes followed a similar pattern. Plasma 6-keto prostaglandin Fl alpha (6-k-PGF1 alpha) increased transiently from a baseline level of 304 +/- 44 to 2083 +/- 698 pg/ml plasma in mixed venous blood 30 minutes after incision in the placebo group (p less than 0.05), but no other significant change in plasma 6-keto prostaglandin Fl alpha or in thromboxane B2 occurred in either group at any other time. 
Rib fractures complicating median sternotomy. The postoperative chest radiographs of 100 consecutive patients undergoing median sternotomy were reviewed for the presence of acute rib fractures. The majority of patients underwent coronary artery bypass grafting. Thirteen patients sustained 15 fractures. Eleven of these fractures were of the left first rib and 7 of the 15 fractures occurred at the costotransverse articulation. The fractures tended to be subtle on the postoperative portable chest radiographs and were initially overlooked in 4 patients. Heavier patients and those with larger body surface areas were more susceptible to the development of fractures. There was no statistical correlation to total operating time, bypass time, or global ischemic time. 
Evaluating genetic association among ovarian, breast, and endometrial cancer: evidence for a breast/ovarian cancer relationship. The possibility of a genetic relationship between ovarian, breast, and endometrial cancer was investigated in data from a large multicenter, population-based, case-control study, the Cancer and Steroid Hormone Study conducted by the Centers for Disease Control (CDC). Age-adjusted relative risks (RRs) for mothers and sisters of 493 ovarian cancer cases, 895 breast cancer cases, and 143 endometrial cancer cases versus 4,754 controls were calculated. Significantly elevated age-adjusted RRs were found for ovarian cancer (RR = 2.8; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.6-4.9) and breast cancer (RR = 1.6; 95% CI = 1.1-2.1) among relatives of ovarian cancer probands and for breast cancer (RR = 2.1; 95% CI = 1.7-2.5) and ovarian cancer (RR = 1.7; 95% CI = 1.0-2.0) among relatives of breast cancer probands. Relatives of endometrial cancer probands had an elevated RR for endometrial cancer only (RR = 2.7; 95% CI = 1.6-4.8). The genetic relationship between ovarian, breast, and endometrial cancer was tested using a multivariate polygenic threshold model developed by Smith (1976), which was modified to accommodate three classes of probands. Estimates of heritability for ovarian, breast, and endometrial cancer were 40%, 56%, and 52%, respectively. There was a significant genetic correlation between ovarian and breast cancer (R12 = .484). Evidence for significant genetic overlap between endometrial cancer and either ovarian or breast cancer was not found. These results suggest the existence of a familial breast/ovarian cancer syndrome. Endometrial cancer, while heritable, appears to be genetically unrelated. 
The safety and efficacy of terazosin in the treatment of essential hypertension in blacks. Terazosin, a new selective alpha 1-adrenergic receptor antagonist, has been found to be an effective antihypertensive agent. In a series of studies, the safety and efficacy of terazosin, alone and in combination with other antihypertensive agents, were evaluated in 1180 black patients with mild to moderate essential hypertension. Terazosin was effective in lowering blood pressure when administered alone (in dosages of 1 to 80 mg/day) and when prescribed (in dosages of 1 to 20 mg/day) in combination with other antihypertensive agents. In elderly black patients, terazosin, 1 to 10 mg daily, was as effective in lowering blood pressure as propranolol (40 to 120 mg twice daily). Changes (mean +/- SE) in sitting diastolic blood pressure from baseline were -8.1 +/- 1.4 mm Hg for terazosin and -5.0 +/- 1.5 mm Hg for propranolol. Terazosin (5 mg) combined with methyclothiazide (2.5 to 5 mg) produced a significantly greater (p less than 0.01) antihypertensive effect than that of terazosin alone. Changes (mean +/- SE) in standing diastolic blood pressure from baseline were -7.9 +/- 2.0 mm Hg for terazosin alone, -15.1 +/- 2.1 mm Hg for terazosin plus 2.5 mg of methyclothiazide, and -15.0 +/- 2.0 mm Hg for terazosin plus 5 mg of methyclothiazide. Terazosin had a favorable effect on serum lipid levels and appeared to compensate for the negative lipid effects associated with diuretics and beta-blockers when used in combination with these agents. Terazosin, alone and combined with other antihypertensive agents, was well tolerated with minimal side effects in black hypertensive patients. 
Superficial thrombophlebitis diagnosed by duplex scanning. Since July 1982, this noninvasive vascular laboratory has performed 12,856 lower extermity venous duplex examinations. All cases of acute venous thrombosis have been categorized and entered into a computer data base. One thousand four hundred twelve examinations were positive for acute venous thrombosis. This report analyzes the laboratory's entire experience with superficial thrombophlebitis (SVT). One hundred eighty-six patients were diagnosed by duplex scanning to have SVT. Women outnumbered men 99 to 87. They were slightly older (average age 58.4 +/- 16.2 years) compared with the men (53.8 +/- 14.2 years). Men were more likely to have a complicated course of SVT (40% vs 22%; p less than 0.01). Complications included either radiographically documented pulmonary embolism or deep venous involvement. Fifty-seven (31%) patients had at least one complication of SVT. A series of predisposing factors was analyzed and six factors were associated with an increased risk of complications. They are bilateral SVT (p less than 0.01), age greater than 60 years (p less than 0.01), male sex (p less than 0.01), history of deep venous thrombosis (p less than 0.01), bed rest (p less than 0.02), and presence of infection (p less than 0.02). Location of thrombus within the greater saphenous vein (35%) was most likely to be associated with complications. Isolated varicosities (8%) were least likely to be associated with complications. Duplex scanning identifies a significant number of complications of patients with SVT and should be obtained in cases of saphenous vein involvement or in the presence of associated risk factors. 
Effect of Candida albicans plus histamine on prostaglandin E2 production by peripheral blood mononuclear cells from healthy women and women with recurrent candidal vaginitis. The in vitro production of prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) by peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) in response to viable Candida albicans, histamine, and C. albicans plus histamine was examined. With PBMC from 10 healthy women, C. albicans but not histamine induced PGE2 at a low level (100 pg/ml). However, C. albicans plus histamine acted synergistically to stimulate PGE2 production (448 pg/ml). PBMC from 8 of 10 women with recurrent candidal vaginitis also produced maximal levels of PGE2 in the presence of C. albicans plus histamine. Production of tumor necrosis factor by PBMC from patients and controls was unaffected by histamine in both the presence and absence of C. albicans. However, unlike the controls, PBMC from six of the patients who were atopic and from two nonatopic patients spontaneously released PGE2 in vitro. Addition of 4 or 10 units/ml interferon-gamma inhibited spontaneous and C. albicans-induced PGE2 production by PBMC. These data reinforce the evidence that immediate hypersensitivity responses may be involved in the etiology of recurrent candidal vaginitis. 
Trunk orientation as the determining factor of the 'contralateral' deficit in the neglect syndrome and as the physical anchor of the internal representation of body orientation in space. The present study examines which egocentric coordinate system determines the border between the disturbed 'contralateral' and the normal 'ipsilateral' side in patients with hemineglect. Based on the observation of significantly longer reaction times for saccades towards stimuli presented in the left visual field (LVF) in right brain-damaged patients with hemineglect, stimuli were presented randomly to the LVF or RVF and the corresponding saccadic reaction times (SRTs) were compared. Beginning with the standard body position generally used for the investigation of neglect patients, where the midlines of head, trunk and visual field are parallel and oriented straight towards the middle of the projection screen, the spatial relation between orientation of head and trunk midlines and location of the target stimuli was systematically varied while holding the retinal projection of the stimuli constant. The deficit in SRTs towards the LVF in 4 right brain-damaged patients with left-sided hemineglect could be compensated for by turning the patients' trunk to the left, such that both LVF and RVF-stimuli were projected to the right, ipsilateral side of trunk space. The results suggest that the spatial orientation of the trunk midline divides our normal perception of space into an egocentric 'left' and an egocentric 'right' sector and seems to be the decisive factor for determining the neglected 'contralateral' part of space in patients with brain-damage. They indicate that the trunk midline constitutes the physical anchor for calculation of the internal egocentric coordinate frame for representing body position with respect to external objects. The hypothesis of Ventre et al. (1984) that deficient reactions to contralaterally located stimuli in neglect patients could be the result of a displacement of these egocentric coordinates towards the non-neglected, ipsilateral side is discussed. 
Perioperative stroke. Part II: Cardiac surgery and cardiogenic embolic stroke. The major mechanism of stroke in cardiac surgery is embolization. The risk is higher in intracardiac than in extracardiac surgery. The incidence of stoke associated with CABG is about 5%. The cerebral protective properties of isoflurane and thiopentone, acid-base management, and monitoring of cerebral perfusion during cardiopulmonary bypass are discussed. Prophylactic carotid endarterectomy for patients with asymptomatic carotid disease before cardiac surgery is not necessary. Symptomatic carotid disease increases the risk of stroke, and the management of patients who have both symptomatic coronary and carotid artery diseases is discussed. Cardiogenic embolism is probably responsible for many perioperative strokes. Patients with atrial fibrillation, valvular disease, and prosthetic heart valves are at high risk of cardiogenic embolism. Strokes associated with cardioversion, pacemaker insertion, coronary arteriography and angioplasty are explored. 
Chemotherapy of metastatic and/or recurrent undifferentiated nasopharyngeal carcinoma with cisplatin, bleomycin, and fluorouracil. Undifferentiated nasopharyngeal carcinoma (UCNT) is known to be radiosensitive and chemosensitive, but the latter has never been studied prospectively with phase II methodology. After an intensive work-up, 49 patients with recurrent (REC) and/or metastatic (MTS) UCNT were treated with three monthly cycles of cisplatin (CDDP) 100 mg/m2 day 1; bleomycin 15 mg intravenously (IV) day 1, and 16 mg/m2/d continuous infusion (CI) days 1 to 5; and fluorouracil (5FU) 650 mg/m2/d CI days 1 to 5 (PBF). Of the 49 patients, 33 were North African. The sex ratio was three males:one female, and the median World Health Organization (WHO) performance status was 1.6. In the 48 patients assessable for response, we observed nine (19%) complete responses (CRs) and 29 (60%) partial responses (PRs) (60%), for a 79% overall response rate (95% confidence interval, 68% to 90%) in the assessable group and a 78% global rate. There were eight CRs (24%) observed in the group without previous chemotherapy (33 patients) compared with one CR in the chemotherapy pretreated group (16 patients). Four patients are still alive without evidence of disease after 52+, 54+, 58+, and 58+ months, respectively. All of them had less than three bone MTS sites, and received radiation therapy in these sites. The results confirm the chemosensitivity of UCNT, and the observation of unmaintained long-term responders makes curability a possible consideration. 
Effect of denervation or unweighting on GLUT-4 protein in rat soleus muscle. The purpose of this study was to test the hypothesis that the decreased capacity for glucose transport in the denervated rat soleus and the increased capacity for glucose transport in the unweighted rat soleus are related to changes in the expression of the regulatable glucose transporter protein in skeletal muscle (GLUT-4). One day after sciatic nerve sectioning, when decreases in the stimulation of soleus 2-deoxyglucose (2-DG) uptake by insulin (-51%, P less than 0.001), contractions (-29%, P less than 0.05), or insulin and contractions in combination (-40%, P less than 0.001) were observed, there was a slight (-18%, NS) decrease in GLUT-4 protein. By day 3 of denervation, stimulation of 2-DG uptake by insulin (-74%, P less than 0.001), contractions (-31%, P less than 0.001), or the two stimuli in combination (-59%, P less than 0.001), as well as GLUT-4 protein (-52%, P less than 0.001), was further reduced. Soleus muscle from hindlimb-suspended rats, which develops an enhanced capacity for insulin-stimulated glucose transport, showed muscle atrophy similar to denervated soleus but, in contrast, displayed substantial increases in GLUT-4 protein after 3 (+35%, P less than 0.05) and 7 days (+107%, P less than 0.001). These results indicate that altered GLUT-4 expression may be a major contributor to the changes in insulin-stimulated glucose transport that are observed with denervation and unweighting. We conclude that muscle activity is an important factor in the regulation of GLUT-4 expression in skeletal muscle. 
Donor limb vascular events following femoro-femoral bypass surgery. A Veterans Affairs Cooperative Study. Three hundred seventeen patients who had femorofemoral bypass surgery were examined for postoperative vascular changes that developed in the donor limb. "Unmasked" claudication developed in 7%, new claudication related to a "steal" developed in 3.5%, progression of preoperative claudication developed in 1%, new rest pain developed in 1.7%, and new necrosis developed in 0.7% of patients. Postoperatively, the donor limb ankle-brachial index decreased 0.30 or greater in 3% of the patients, decreased 0.15 to 0.29 in 6%, and decreased 0.10 to 0.14 in 6% of the patients. Only eight patients (3%) had a clinical and hemodynamic steal. Late vascular procedures for donor iliac stenosis were few, resulting in an iliac percutaneous transluminal angioplasty in 3% and inflow bypasses in 3%. Angiographic patterns of donor and recipient limbs were not predictive of "clinical" or "hemodynamic" steal events. Most new donor limb symptoms of claudication were an unmasking of arterial insufficiency previously present in the donor limb that became apparent when the recipient limb was improved. 
Prosthetic replacement of the distal femur for primary bone tumours. Over a 16-year period, 135 custom-made distal femoral prostheses, based on a fully constrained Stanmore-type knee replacement, were used in the treatment of primary malignant or aggressive benign tumours. Survivorship analysis showed a cumulative success rate of 72% at five years and 64% at seven years. Intact prostheses in 91% of the surviving patients gave good or excellent functional results. Deep infection was the major complication, occurring in 6.8% of cases; clinical aseptic loosening occurred in 6.0%. Revision surgery was carried out for loosening and infection, and the early results are encouraging. We conclude that prosthetic replacement of the distal femur can meet the objectives of limb salvage surgery. 
Electrophysiologic recording and thermodynamic modeling demonstrate that helium-neon laser irradiation does not affect peripheral Adelta- or C-fiber nociceptors. The effect of helium-neon laser irradiation (632.5 nm) on A delta- and C-fiber sensory afferents was investigated in the rabbit cornea, to determine the physiologic basis for reports that low power (0.1-5 mW) helium-neon (He-Ne) lasers produce acute analgesia and alleviate chronic pain. Multiple and single unit extracellular recordings from nociceptive corneal afferent nerves (C-fiber cold, C-fiber chemical, A delta mechanical and A delta bimodal) were used to study the effects of He-Ne laser radiation upon the electrophysiologic responses to mechanical, thermal, chemical and electrical stimulation of the cornea. Action potentials were analyzed for latency, amplitude, rise time, duration and frequency. Exposure of the neural receptive field and/or nerve bundle to a 4-mm diameter He-Ne laser (0-5 mW; 0-1800 sec) did not alter spontaneous or evoked neural activity. In addition, single unit action potential parameters were not altered by laser irradiation. Modeling of thermal changes produced by He-Ne radiation on corneal nerves indicated that effects predicted for receptor and axonal depths in both skin and cornea were minimal (less than 0.15 degrees C) and unlikely to alter sensory transduction or transmission. 
Brain tumor resection aided with markers placed using stereotaxis guided by magnetic resonance imaging and computed tomography. In the operative resection of brain tumors, defining and locating edges of deep-seated tumors or those with indistinct color and consistency can be difficult. This report presents a simple yet precise, alternative method, using the basic Brown-Roberts-Wells or Cosman-Roberts-Wells stereotactic frame, for placement of visual markers to aid in tumor resections. The method can also be extended to the Leksell system. Using routine computed tomographic scanning or magnetic resonance imaging after stereotactic frame application, multiple points along tumor edges were used as target points. In the operating room, standard techniques were used for the skin incision, removal of the bone flap, and opening the dura. At each target point, after opening the dura and using stereotactic coordinates and equipment, a microbiopsy forceps was used to place "micropatties" (each with a string tail) or small catheters with pledgets or catheter tips located at tumor edges. After removing the arc, the tumor resection was accomplished in a conventional nonstereotactic manner by simply following string tails or catheters to the tumor. Gross tumor edges were determined from positions of actual patties or catheter tips. These simple but accurate techniques offer the possibility of tumor resections under stereotactic guidance with equipment readily available to most neurosurgeons. The fidelity of marker placement is also maintained in relation to tumor edges despite shifts in the tumor and/or brain as cystic areas are drained or large amounts of the tumor are resected. 
Strut fracture after Greenfield filter placement. We present the unusual event of strut fracture of a Greenfield filter. This being an extremely rare complication, we postulate a possible cause of fracture and present a review of literature. 
Primary hyperaldosteronism due to a functional black (pigmented) adenoma of the adrenal cortex. The clinical and pathologic findings are reported in a case of primary hyperaldosteronism due to a functional black (pigmented) adenoma of the adrenal cortex. Cortical atrophy of the involved gland was present, the mechanism of which was obscure. 
Prevention of fetal growth retardation with low-dose aspirin: findings of the EPREDA trial. The efficacy of low-dose aspirin in preventing fetal growth retardation was tested in a randomised, placebo-controlled, double-blind trial. A secondary aim was to find out whether dipyridamole improves the efficacy of aspirin. 323 women at 15-18 weeks' amenorrhoea were selected at twenty-five participating centres on the basis of fetal growth retardation and/or fetal death or abruptio placentae in at least one previous pregnancy. They were randomly allocated to groups receiving placebo, 150 mg/day aspirin, or 150 mg/day aspirin plus 225 mg/day dipyridamole, for the remainder of the pregnancy. In the first phase of the trial all actively treated patients (n = 156) were compared with the placebo group (n = 73). Mean birthweight was significantly higher in the treated than in the placebo group (2751 [SD 670] vs 2526 [848] g; difference 225 g [95% CI 129-321 g], p = 0.029) and the frequency of fetal growth retardation in the placebo group was twice that in the treated group (19 [26%] vs 20 [13%]; p less than 0.02). The frequencies of stillbirth (4 [5%] vs 2 [1%]) and abruptio placentae (6 [8%] vs 7 [5%]) were also higher in the placebo than in the treated group. The benefits of aspirin treatment were greater in patients with two or more previous poor outcomes than in those with only one. In the second analysis, of aspirin only (n = 127) vs aspirin plus dipyridamole (n = 119), no significant differences were found. There was no excess of maternal or neonatal side-effects in the aspirin-treated patients. 
Vasoactive intestinal polypeptide inhibits c-myc expression and growth of human gastric carcinoma cells. Vasoactive intestinal polypeptide (VIP) is a gut neuroendocrine polypeptide that increases cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) production in cells with VIP receptors. Some gastrointestinal cancer cells possess functional receptors for VIP; however, the role of VIP in regulation of growth of gastric cancer cells has not been determined. The purpose of this study was to determine whether VIP and other agents that increase cAMP regulate growth of a human gastric cancer cell line (AGS) and whether these agents regulate expression of c-myc proto-oncogene, which is required for cell proliferation. We measured levels of cAMP by radioimmunoassay, and we used Northern blot analysis to examine c-myc messenger RNA expression. Cell-growth studies were carried out in media supplemented with 3% serum, and cells were counted with a Coulter counter. We found that VIP significantly increased cAMP production of AGS cells in a dose-dependent manner, whereas secretin, glucagon, and peptide histidine methionine (PHM) did not stimulate cAMP production. Exogenous cAMP (8-bromo-cAMP) inhibited AGS cell growth in a dose-dependent manner. VIP acted synergistically with either isobutylmethyl-xanthine or forskolin to inhibit AGS cell proliferation. The increased c-myc expression, which was induced by serum, was inhibited by simultaneous treatment with VIP and isobutylmethyl-xanthine. We have found that AGS cells have specific, functional VIP receptors (activation of which are negatively correlated with cell growth) and that the mechanism by which VIP acts to inhibit cell growth appears to be due, in part, to cAMP-dependent regulation of c-myc proto-oncogene expression. 
Leukotrienes as mediators in ischemia-reperfusion injury in a microcirculation model in the hamster. Leukotriene (LT)B4 promotes leukocyte chemotaxis and adhesion to the endothelium of postcapillary venules. The cysteinyl leukotrienes, LTC4, LTD4, and LTE4, elicit macromolecular leakage from this vessel segment. Both leukocyte adhesion to the endothelium and macromolecular leakage from postcapillary venules hallmark the microcirculatory failure after ischemia-reperfusion, suggesting a role of leukotrienes as mediators of ischemia-reperfusion injury. Using the dorsal skinfold chamber model for intravital fluorescence microscopy of the microcirculation in striated muscle in awake hamsters and sequential RP-HPLC and RIA for leukotrienes, we demonstrate in this study that (a) the leukotrienes (LT)B4 and LTD4 elicit leukocyte/endothelium interaction and macromolecular leakage from postcapillary venules, respectively, that (b) leukotrienes accumulate in the tissue after ischemia and reperfusion, and that (c) selective inhibition of leukotriene biosynthesis (by MK-886) prevents both postischemic leukotriene accumulation and the microcirculatory changes after ischemia-reperfusion, while blocking of LTD4/E4 receptors (by MK-571) inhibits postischemic macromolecular leakage. These results demonstrate a key role of leukotrienes in ischemia-reperfusion injury in striated muscle in vivo. 
Intellectual outcome in children with maple syrup urine disease. We report a controlled study of intellectual outcome in 16 children with maple syrup urine disease (MSUD) that compares the outcome of MSUD diagnosed after symptoms became apparent with that of MSUD diagnosed prospectively and in unaffected siblings and parents. The mean IQ (+/- SD) score in the children with classic MSUD was 78 +/- 24; however, there were two discrete groups: one with normal IQ (greater than 84) whose MSUD had been diagnosed at a mean age of 3.5 days and a second group, with IQ below normal, whose MSUD was diagnosed at a mean of 10 days of age. Affected children treated presymptomatically had higher IQ scores than their affected siblings treated when their disease was symptomatic. Multiple regression analysis indicated that the important influences on IQ were age at the time of diagnosis and long-term metabolic control; control at the time of testing also might have affected performance. The mean score of unaffected siblings was 92 +/- 5 and the mean parental IQ was 83 +/- 9. The mean IQ scores of children with variant MSUD, 97 +/- 4, was similar to that of their parents, 103 +/- 6. This study was not longitudinal and thus could not identify subtle developmental learning problems. We conclude that early and meticulous treatment of MSUD can result in intellectually normal children. 
Ig gene rearrangements on individual alleles of Abelson murine leukemia cell lines from (C57BL/6 x BALB/c) F1 fetal livers. We have previously shown that selection of Ig H chain V region genes used by colonies obtained from splenic B cells and fetal liver pre-B cells was dependent on strain-specific factors. Moreover, by examining the V gene usage in strains congenic at the Igh locus, we also determined that the strain-specific factor was encoded by sequences lying outside of the Igh locus. We decided to examine whether there are differences in Vh gene rearrangement between alleles in an F1 strain. To do this analysis we chose to examine the relative Ig H chain V region gene usage of pre-B cell lines derived from (C57BL/6 x BALB/c)F1 fetal liver cells by Southern blot analysis. We found a high frequency of Vh-gene rearrangements (77% of the alleles had VDJ rearrangements) and these rearrangements occurred to Vh-genes throughout the Vh locus and were not confined to the D-proximal Vh-genes as has been previously observed with lines from other mouse strains. The Vh-gene usage pattern is similar on both alleles indicating that at least one of the determinants of which Vh-gene is used is trans-acting and acts similarly on each allele. Furthermore, one allele, Ighb (donated by the C57BL/6 parent), rearranged Vh-genes more frequently than the other allele, Igha (donated by the BALB/c parent) suggesting that one of the determinants of Vh-gene rearrangement may be acting in an allele-specific manner. 
Peripheral pulmonary adenoid cystic carcinoma with substantial submucosal extension to the proximal bronchus. A rare case of a peripheral pulmonary adenoid cystic carcinoma is presented. Histological examination after lobectomy showed pronounced submucosal invasion of the carcinoma to proximal bronchi. 
Aortic dissection type A surgery: Doppler sonography to evaluate correct carotid artery perfusion during cardiopulmonary bypass. In the surgery of acute aortic type A dissection we have employed preoperative and intraoperative Doppler sonography, to check safe and correct perfusion of the carotid arteries by the cardiopulmonary bypass before instituting cardiac arrest. Ten patients, operated upon for acute aortic type A dissection, were evaluated by means of Doppler sonography and in two patients a very abnormal flow pattern was found in the carotid arteries at the moment of aortic cross-clamping; immediate unclamping allowed temporary antegrade carotid perfusion, while the perfusion technique was readjusted. We report our experience with preoperative and intraoperative Doppler sonography, which appears to be a valuable new method of improving the surgical management of acute aortic type A dissection. 
Randomized comparative trial of indomethacin and ritodrine for the long-term treatment of preterm labor. A randomized prospective trial was performed to compare the efficacy and safety of ritodrine and indomethacin in the long-term treatment of preterm labor. Forty patients with intact membranes in preterm labor at 23 to 34 weeks' gestation were randomized to receive either intravenous ritodrine or oral indomethacin as the first-line tocolytic agent. Successful intravenous ritodrine therapy was followed by oral terbutaline therapy, and indomethacin-treated patients continued to receive oral indomethacin. Treatment failures were defined as progressive preterm labor or patient intolerance, and these patients were treated with intravenous magnesium sulfate. Ritodrine and indomethacin were equally successful in delaying preterm birth as defined by interval to delivery, gestational age at delivery, delivery delayed greater than 7 days, attainment of 35 weeks of gestation, percentage of patients who required magnesium sulfate therapy, percentage of patients who were readmitted with premature rupture of membranes, absence of recurrent preterm labor, and infant birth weight. More than 80% of mothers who received ritodrine voiced complaints of beta-sympathomimetic side effects, and one patient discontinued treatment as the result of intolerance. There were minimal patient complaints with indomethacin use. No statistically significant differences were noted in neonatal outcome as defined by Apgar scores, umbilical cord pH, intensive care days, ventilator days, or neonatal deaths. However, three cases of primary pulmonary hypertension were observed in the indomethacin group. We had not previously observed this problem with short-term (24 to 48 hours) indomethacin therapy. 
Interleukin-2 immunotherapy followed by resection of residual renal cell carcinoma. We administered 10 (E5) units per kg. interleukin-2, 3 times daily, with or without lymphokine-activated killer cells, to 10 patients with metastatic renal cell carcinoma. All patients had metastases to the lung, and 3 of 5 patients who had previously undergone nephrectomy had metastases to the renal fossa. Of the 9 patients who completed at least 1 course of therapy 3 had complete regression of disease outside the abdomen, including 2 who were rendered disease-free after subsequent cytoreductive surgery (nephrectomy in 1 and resection of the renal fossa recurrence in 1). Viable tumor comprised less than 1% of each surgical specimen. Our results support the view that initial treatment with interleukin-2 immunotherapy, followed by abdominal cytoreductive surgery if the peripheral metastases have regressed, may be preferable to the practice of performing abdominal cytoreductive surgery before administering interleukin-2 immunotherapy for patients with widely metastatic renal cell carcinoma. 
Specific adoptive immunotherapy mediated by tumor-draining lymph node cells sequentially activated with anti-CD3 and IL-2. Lymph nodes (LN) draining progressively growing tumors contain tumor-sensitized but not fully functional preeffector lymphocytes. These cells could acquire therapeutic efficacy and be expanded upon sequential culture with anti-CD3 mAb for 2 days followed by incubation in IL-2 for 3 days. Using the weakly immunogenic MCA 106 and MCA 205 murine sarcomas, we have further defined conditions of this anti-CD3/IL-2 activation with which preeffector cells differentiated into immune effector cells. In vitro activation and expansion of effector cells required sequential but independent stimulation with anti-CD3 and IL-2 because the simultaneous presence of both anti-CD3 and IL-2 at either stage did not enhance the efficacy of activation. Generation of effector cells by this two-stage activation was critically dependent on the optimal concentrations of anti-CD3 (1.0 microgram/ml) and IL-2 (2-10 U/ml). However, these conditions were not optimal for inducing the greatest cellular proliferation. In adoptive immunotherapy experiments, although the transfer of anti-CD3/IL-2-activated cells alone could mediate the regression of established metastases, the concomitant administration of IL-2 enhanced the in vivo activity of these cells. More importantly, tumor regression mediated by the anti-CD3/IL-2-activated cells was found to be immunologically specific. The specificity was determined by the tumor that stimulated the preeffector cell response. In spite of their in vivo antitumor effects, the anti-CD3/IL-2-activated tumor-draining LN cells did not exhibit detectable in vitro cytotoxicity against the tumor target in the 4-h 51Cr-release assay. In mice bearing progressive tumor, draining LN contained most preeffector cells. Some preeffector cells were also detected in the spleen whereas mesenteric LN did not demonstrate any reactivity. In kinetics studies, sensitization of preeffector cells in the draining LN occurred between 4 to 6 days after tumor inoculation. As the tumor progressed, the presence of preeffector cells declined gradually suggesting a tumor-induced suppression. These results define the conditions whereby tumor-draining LN cells could be stimulated, in the absence of tumor Ag, to develop into specific therapeutic effector cells. Our findings also raise the possibility of using similar approaches for isolating immune effector cells from cancer patients for adoptive immunotherapy. 
Studying whole-mounted sections of the paranasal sinuses to understand the complications of endoscopic sinus surgery. Endoscopic techniques for paranasal sinus surgery have allowed detailed and complete removal of sinus disease while promising minimum distress to the patient. The telescopic view of the operative field shows detail of the sinus anatomy and its disease, not possible in earlier transnasal techniques. Several articles document the serious complications seen with the endoscopic surgery. To understand the paranasal sinuses and their relationships to the orbit and cribriform plate, blocks of cadaver heads that included the orbit and paranasal sinuses were whole sectioned. It has been possible to see areas of the cribriform and orbital wall that are at risk to produce cerebrospinal fluid rhinorrhea and orbital complications. At the same time, landmarks for avoiding these complications can be defined to guide the surgeon during this dissection as seen through the endoscope. 
Prognostic significance of anticentromere antibodies and anti-topoisomerase I antibodies in Raynaud's disease. A prospective study. Seventy-seven patients with Raynaud's disease were studied for a mean of 4 years (range 1-11 years) to determine the relationship between autoantibodies and long-term clinical outcome. Anticentromere antibodies (ACA) were assayed by indirect immunofluorescence and by immunoblotting of HeLa cell chromosome extracts. Antibodies to topoisomerase I (anti-topo I) were assayed by immunodiffusion and immunoblotting. Antibodies to the major centromeric protein, CENP-B, and anti-topo I were studied by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Eight patients developed telangiectasias, 4 developed skin tightening, and 4 developed a connective tissue disease other than scleroderma. The presence of ACA at the start of the study was associated with the development of telangiectasias (P less than 0.003). An initial 100-kd band on immunoblot in conjunction with a positive anti-topo I ELISA result was associated with the development of tight skin (P less than 0.0025), while a 100-kd band with a negative anti-topo I ELISA result was associated with the subsequent development of a connective tissue disease other than scleroderma (P less than 0.0073). Patients who were initially ACA positive, had the 100-kd band on immunoblot, or had positive ELISA results for anti-topo I or for anti-CENP-B were 63-fold more likely to develop signs of connective tissue disease by the end of the study (P less than 0.000009). The presence of any of these autoantibodies was more sensitive (100%), although less specific (75%), than were findings from nailfold capillaroscopy (sensitivity 67% and specificity 95%) in predicting subsequent clinical progression. We conclude that findings of assays for anti-topo I and ACA complement the findings from nailfold capillaroscopy in providing useful prognostic information in Raynaud's disease. 
The role of definitive radiation therapy in squamous cell carcinoma of the oral tongue. Between 1968 and 1985, 114 patients with squamous cell carcinoma of the tongue were evaluated in the Department of Radiation Oncology at the University of Virginia (Charlottesville, VA); of these, 86 received treatment with curative intent. The majority were treated with radiation therapy alone, whereas the remainder were treated with radiation therapy with preoperative or postoperative surgery. There were 17 T1 primary malignancies, 40 T2, 27 T3, and 2 T4. Clinically positive adenopathy was present in 48% of the patients overall and ranged from 35% in the T1 group to 100% in the T4 group. Twenty-six percent of patients either presented with or later had second malignancies. At 36 months, the patient status was evaluated as dead of disease (37%), dead of intercurrent disease (23%), alive with disease (1%), and alive without evidence of disease (38%). Seventy-five patients received external beam therapy and 32 patients received an implant as either all or part of their treatment. Average doses were in the range of 6000 Gy. Adjusted local control rate at 3 years was not statistically different for different treatment techniques used on either T1 or T2 primary malignancies. The rates were 89% versus 88% for T1 lesions treated with definitive radiation therapy versus postoperative radiation therapy. For T2 primary malignancies, the rates were 67%, 71%, and 83% for the definitive, preoperative, and postoperative radiation therapy groups, respectively. For T3 lesions, there was close to statistical significance with the corresponding rates being 47%, 50%, and 100%, respectively. When the effect of implants was examined for T1 and T2 lesions, no difference in local control rate at 3 years was noticed with or without an implant. Survival was improved for the group presenting with positive neck disease when compared with the N0 group. The external beam severe complication rate was less than 5%, and the implant complication rate was 6%. 
Chronic cluster headache associated with a vertebral artery aneurysm. This is a report of a patient with chronic cluster headache-like pain of 12 years duration. Investigation revealed an aneurysm at the junction of the vertebral and posterior inferior cerebellar arteries and after removal the patient experienced resolution of his cluster headache. The headache and aneurysm were both right sided suggesting a possible relationship. 
What is migraine? Controversy and stalemate in migraine pathophysiology. Theories of migraine pathophysiology have evolved from the realms of the supernatural into the scientific arena but their further evolution seems delayed by unproductive controversy about whether or not migraine is primarily a vascular or a neurological dysfunction. This conceptual deadlock needs to be transcended by thinking beyond the neural and vascular systems, and by identifying mechanisms that could affect both to produce the characteristic clinical phenomena of migraine. One theoretical model envisages 5-hydroxytryptamine (serotonin; 5-HT) as a link between the neural and vascular systems, with global alteration of serotonergic neurotransmission affecting not only these systems, but the gastrointestinal tract as well, with incidental reverberations on platelet function. Such altered serotonergic transmission might originate from altered 5-HT receptor dynamics, a molecular change in turn produced by genetic mechanisms. Recognition of the importance of 5-HT receptor function in migraine, most notably that agonists of 5-HT1 receptors abort acute migraine and that antagonists of 5-HT2 receptors prevent migraine, may lead to significant therapeutic advances. The possibility that the "trigeminovascular system" might be the end-stage mechanism that these serotonergic changes detonate to produce the painful reverberations of migraine headache is also important. Seeking ways to muffle these reverberations, or to insulate the system itself from the action of external influences (likely through further study of peptidergic transmission and receptors) might result in more drugs that will abort or prevent migraine. 
Cerebrospinal fluid leaks and meningitis in acoustic neuroma surgery. Cerebrospinal fluid leaks and associated meningitis are the most common life-threatening complications of surgery for acoustic neuromas. This retrospective study reviews 319 patients who had surgery for 321 acoustic tumors at the Sunnybrook Health Sciences Center, University of Toronto, from April 1975 to March 1990. Cerebrospinal fluid leaks occurred after 13.4% of primary tumor operations. Surgical repair was required in 6.2% of all patients; 4.4% needed more than one operation. Meningitis occurred in 5.3% of all patients. These complications were more common in larger tumors and after the combined translabyrinthine middle fossa approach. Transnasopharyngeal eustachian tube obliteration was used to stop recurrent cerebrospinal fluid leaks in two patients. 
Cerebral metastases as first symptom of bronchogenic carcinoma. A prospective study of 37 cases. Among the patients showing evidence of cerebral metastases without previously known cancer history, lung cancer has been found 37 times as the primary tumor in our institution. There were 34 men and three women and all but two were heavy smokers. Only one presented at diagnosis with thoracic symptoms but the chest radiograph was abnormal in 34. The histologic type of the primary tumor was obtained in 32 cases as a result of thoracic investigations and in five cases from metastatic tumor tissue. The primary tumor appeared to be non-small cell lung carcinoma in 26 cases and small cell lung carcinoma in 11 cases. These results show that patients treated with surgery (20 cases) have a better survival (median 10 months versus 4.5) than the others, and among surgically treated patients only those treated with bifocal resection (eight patients) are long-term survivors. Also, in four of six patients, objective regression of the neurologic symptoms was seen after radiation therapy alone. Central nervous system relapse was seen in 12 patients, but in none of the patients treated with postoperative radiation therapy. Conventional chemotherapy (11 patients) induced objective responses only in the small cell type and proved to be too toxic when used simultaneously with radiation therapy in inoperable patients. 
Nasal hyper-responsiveness to histamine, methacholine and phentolamine in patients with perennial non-allergic rhinitis and in patients with infectious rhinitis. Recently it has been shown that patients with atopic rhinitis and with an allergy to house dust mites have a stronger nasal response to insufflation of histamine, methacholine and phentolamine than a control group. This hyper-responsiveness could not be demonstrated in patients with perennial non-allergic rhinitis, unless the patients were selected according to the predominant symptoms in the history. Patients with rhinorrhoea ('runners') proved to be hyper-responsive to methacholine compared with normal controls. The existence of two subpopulations was emphasized by hyper-responsiveness to both histamine and methacholine in the runners group compared with the patients with a stuffy nose ('blockers'). Patients with chronic nasal infections (characterized by recurrent episodes of purulent discharge) showed no hyper-responsiveness at all, indicating that either hyper-reactivity does not play an important part in this patient population or methods to detect hyper-reactivity in this group are inadequate. In contrast to our earlier observations in patients with atopic rhinitis, increased responsiveness to phentolamine could not be detected either in the patients with perennial rhinitis or in the patients with infectious rhinitis, indicating that the possible alpha-adrenergic dysfunction found in patients with atopic rhinitis is restricted to this group. 
Clonality and clonal evolution of hepatocellular carcinoma with multiple nodules. To determine the clonal evolution of hepatocellular carcinoma, the integrated hepatitis B virus DNA patterns of the main tumor, satellites and/or metastatic lesions were analyzed by Southern-blot hybridization in 28 hepatocellular carcinomas, including three HBsAg-seronegative cases. Unicentric or multicentric hepatocellular carcinoma was confirmed by histopathological criteria in 89% of the cases. Among 17 unicentric hepatocellular carcinomas, minor changes of the integration pattern--including partial loss or addition of the integration sites or both--were detected in the metastatic lesions in 29% of the cases. Furthermore, none of five cases with free-form hepatitis B virus DNA in the primary tumor had detectable free hepatitis B virus DNA in the metastatic lesions. These results suggest that the alteration of integrated hepatitis B virus DNA pattern during the course of tumor growth and metastasis may occur more often than previously perceived and that the switch-off of virus replication may be related to tumor metastatic potential. In eight cases with unilateral, multicentric hepatocellular carcinoma, two clones were detected in six cases, three were seen in another and four were seen in one. One case of note was a 9-yr-old boy with two histological types and two different integration patterns, one associated with vascular invasion and lung metastasis. Three patients with bilateral hepatocellular carcinoma were confirmed to have bicentric or tricentric hepatocellular carcinoma rather than intrahepatic dissemination and had survival rates similar to those in unicentric hepatocellular carcinoma. Three invasive HBsAg-seronegative hepatocellular carcinomas were found to have hepatitis B virus DNA integration and were of unicentric origin. 
Endoscopic sphincterotomy: the whole truth. An 8 year experience of 602 patients (median age 76 years) referred for endoscopic management of common bile stones is reported. No patient referred for treatment has been excluded. A diagnostic cholangiogram was achieved in 94 per cent and sphincterotomy was accomplished in 91.5 per cent. The bile ducts were demonstrated to be completely cleared of stones in 491 (81.6 per cent) of 602 patients. A mean number of 1.9 endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography examinations per patient were necessary to achieve this result. Complications of endoscopic sphincterotomy, which were strictly defined, occurred in 10.5 per cent of patients although five patients had two complications (total complication rate 11.3 per cent). The 30-day mortality rate was 2.2 per cent, seven of 13 deaths (1.2 per cent) occurring as a direct result of sphincterotomy. There have been statistically significant improvements in bile duct clearance and complication rates with increasing experience of endoscopists. 
The contributing role of condylar resorption to skeletal relapse following mandibular advancement surgery: report of five cases. The contribution of condylar resorption to relapse following mandibular advancement surgery has not been fully evaluated, yet may contribute substantially to postoperative occlusal and skeletal changes too often considered simply as "relapse." Five cases showing a typical relapse pattern are presented, illustrating the role of condylar resorption. Preoperative factors that may contribute to the development of condylar resorption (age, sex, high preoperative mandibular plane angle, and the presence of preoperative temporomandibular joint disease), as well as intraoperative and postoperative factors, are discussed. A target group is defined in which special considerations should be made with regard to preoperative and postoperative management. 
Type IV procollagen mRNA regulation: evidence for extracellular matrix/cytoskeleton/nuclear matrix interactions in human urothelium. The absence of basement membrane components correlates with tumor stage and progression in human bladder cancers. We have previously shown that invasive tumors possess the ability to degrade basement membrane. However, the presence of basement membrane may be affected not only by its degradation, but by its synthesis and deposition as well. Our results in the present study suggest that while the invasive human transitional carcinoma cell line EJ has an increased amount of type IV procollagen mRNA when compared to the non-invasive RT4 cell line, type IV collagen staining is absent in the invasive EJ cells and intensely present in the non-invasive RT4 cells. Moreover, when EJ cells were grown on an artificial basement membrane (Matrigel), type IV procollagen mRNA expression was down-regulated to the levels seen with the non-invasive RT4 cells. We also discovered that the invasive cells, when grown on Matrigel, appeared morphologically different from the same cells grown on plastic tissue cultures. We conclude that a deficient basement membrane in invasive cancer cells may be due not only to active proteolytic activity but also to an abnormal production and deposition of extracellular matrix components. In addition, we also demonstrated that basement membrane components may have a significant effect on epithelial cell morphology and gene regulation, and that any alterations of the extracellular matrix-cytoskeleton-nuclear matrix interactions can lead to altered gene regulations and cell function. 
Adjuvant chemotherapy enhances long-term survival of patients with advanced gastric cancer following curative resection. We examined the effectiveness of postoperative adjuvant chemotherapy with mitomycin C (MMC), 1-(2-tetrahydrofuryl)-5-fluorouracil (tegafur), plus PSK, an immunomodulator, for patients with advanced gastric cancer who underwent histological curative resection. The effect of chemotherapy on prognostic serosal (ps) invasion [ps(-) or ps(+)] and lymph node metastasis [n(-) or N(+)] was examined. One hundred eighteen patients were in the no-chemotherapy group and 137 were on the drugs. The median follow-up time for the 86 survivors at the time of analysis was 13.8 years. With regard to prognostic factors, there were no differences between the two groups. Generalized Wilcoxon test of the two survival patterns revealed a P value of .0351, and the survival rate for 15 years was 45.7% for patients in the no-chemotherapy group and 56.9% for those of the chemotherapy group. In particular, adjuvant chemotherapy was effective for patients with ps(-)n(+) (P less than .05) and ps(+)n(-) (P less than .05), but not for those with ps(-)n(-) and ps(+)n(+). Our findings show that the concomitant prescription of MMC, tegafur, and PSK improves the 15-year survival rate for patients with advanced gastric cancer, following curative resection. As the survival rate is low for the patients with ps(+)n(+), an even more aggressive postoperative chemotherapy is recommended. 
Are depressive symptoms nonspecific in patients with acute stroke? OBJECTIVE: Some investigators have suggested that major depression might be overdiagnosed in stroke patients because of changes in appetite, sleep, or sexual interest caused by their medical illness; others have suggested that depression may be underdiagnosed in stroke patients who deny symptoms of depression because of anosognosia, neglect, or aprosody. The authors' goal was to determine how frequently depressive symptoms occur in acute stroke patients with and without depressed mood to estimate how often diagnostic errors of inclusion or exclusion may be made. METHOD: They examined the rate of autonomic and psychological symptoms of depression in 205 patients who were consecutively hospitalized for acute stroke. Eighty-five (41%) of these patients had depressed mood, and 120 (59%) had no mood disturbance. Forty-six (54%) of the 85 patients with depressed mood (22% of all patients) were assigned the DSM-III diagnosis of major depression. RESULTS: The 120 patients without mood disturbance had a mean of one autonomic symptom, but the 85 patients with depressed mood had a mean of almost four. Tightening the diagnostic criteria to account for one more nonspecific autonomic symptom decreased the number of patients with major depression by only three; adding two more criteria decreased the number by only five. Thus, the rate of DSM-III major depression was 1% higher than the rate with one extra nonspecific autonomic symptom and 2% higher than the rate with two extra criteria. Conversely, loosening diagnostic criteria to account for denial of depressive illness increased the rate of major depression by only 5%. CONCLUSIONS: Both autonomic and psychological depressive symptoms are strongly associated with depressed mood in acute stroke patients. 
Current approaches to chronic pain in older patients. As the population ages, primary care physicians face an increasing number of individuals who suffer from the effects of chronic diseases, including the accompanying chronic pain. This article reviews the common causes of pain in the elderly and suggests a system for assessing its severity. Five different approaches to treating pain in this population are outlined, as are guidelines for managing the potential side effects of treatment. 
Morphometric studies in intraductal breast carcinoma using computerized image analysis. A morphometric study was performed using computerized image analysis on the histologic specimens of 26 patients with intraductal carcinoma of the breast and 26 normal control patients. A significant incidence of necrosis (56%) was observed in the breast ducts containing intraductal carcinoma. This was characterized by one or more areas of necrosis surrounded by a rim of viable tumor cells. The mean diameter of the ducts containing intraductal carcinoma was 349 microns compared with a mean diameter of 90 microns for the normal ducts. The mean diameter of the ducts containing necrosis was 470 microns compared with a mean diameter of 192 microns for the ducts containing a solid pattern of intraductal carcinoma. Central necrosis occurred in 94% of the ducts more than 180 microns in radius, whereas only 34% of the ducts less than 180 microns in size contained necrosis. The width of the viable neoplastic tissue was less than 180 microns in 91% of the ducts. These results are analogous to the findings of Thomlinson and Gray in human lung tumor cords and provide indirect evidence for the existence of a hypoxic compartment in intraductal carcinoma of the breast. This could be an explanation for the higher local failure rate after conservative surgery and irradiation for infiltrating cancers containing an extensive intraductal component. 
A prospective comparison of thromboembolic stockings, external sequential pneumatic compression stockings and heparin sodium/dihydroergotamine mesylate for the prevention of thromboembolic complications in urological surgery. Deep venous thrombosis and pulmonary emboli are reported to occur in up to 66% of the patients undergoing a major urological operation. Thromboembolic stockings, external sequential pneumatic compression stockings and anticoagulant agents, such as heparin sodium plus dihydroergotamine mesylate, have been suggested to decrease the risk of deep venous thrombosis and pulmonary emboli. A total of 74 evaluable patients undergoing a major urological operation was randomized to receive either thromboembolic stockings, external sequential pneumatic compression stockings, or heparin plus dihydroergotamine as prophylaxis against deep venous thrombosis and pulmonary emboli. 111Indium-labeled platelet scans, performed preoperatively and on days 1, 3 and 6 postoperatively, were used to diagnose deep venous thrombosis and pulmonary emboli. Mean patient age was 63 years and all but 1 operation was performed for neoplastic disease. Deep venous thrombosis was detected in 5 of 25 patients (20%) with thromboembolic stockings, 3 of 24 (12.5%) with external sequential pneumatic compression stockings and 2 of 25 (8%) with heparin plus dihydroergotamine. There was no difference in blood loss or complications among the groups. Although statistical significance among the treatment groups was not reached in this study, the trend to a decrease in deep venous thrombosis and pulmonary emboli with external sequential pneumatic compression stockings and heparin plus dihydroergotamine, and an absence of an increase in morbidity in these groups supports the use of these modalities to decrease the morbidity and mortality of deep venous thrombosis and pulmonary emboli. 
Nerve cell loss in the thalamus in Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease. Serial sections through the thalamus from the fixed right cerebral hemispheres of 15 cases (5 Parkinson's disease, 5 Alzheimer's disease (AD) and 5 controls) were used to obtain quantitative estimates of neuronal loss, neurofibrillary tangle formation and Lewy body inclusions within individual thalamic nuclei. Severe neuronal loss and tangle formation were evident in the anterodorsal nucleus from the AD cases. Nerve cell damage was also present in the centromedian nucleus but was not associated with tangle formation and occurred in all but 2 of the brains examined. It is likely that the anterodorsal neurons are damaged locally by the Alzheimer's disease process whereas the changes in the centromedian nucleus may be related to ageing. 
Rupture of the internal elastic lamina and vascular fragility in stroke-prone spontaneously hypertensive rats. We studied a possible relation between stroke and an enhanced susceptibility to rupture of the arterial internal elastic lamina by comparing stroke-prone spontaneously hypertensive rats with spontaneously hypertensive rats, which have a very low incidence of stroke. We quantified interruptions in the internal elastic lamina in certain arteries and studied the effect of beta-aminopropionitrile, an inhibitor of cross-link formation in collagen and elastic fibers, on rupture of the internal elastic lamina and on mortality in these two substrains. To eliminate any influence of higher blood pressure in the stroke-prone rats on the parameters studied, we used antihypertensive treatment to obtain equivalent blood pressures in the two substrains. Results showed that stroke sensitivity was associated with an enhanced early spontaneous rupture of the internal elastic lamina in the caudal artery, an increased susceptibility to beta-aminopropionitrile-induced rupture of the internal elastic lamina, and earlier mortality, mainly from aortic rupture, under beta-aminopropionitrile treatment. These findings suggest that stroke-prone rats have an enhanced minor connective tissue defect that is expressed by rupture of the internal elastic lamina and may be related, at least in part, to their greater vascular fragility and increased susceptibility to stroke. 
Capillary refill--is it a useful predictor of hypovolemic states? STUDY OBJECTIVES: To evaluate whether the capillary refill test can correctly differentiate between hypovolemic and euvolemic emergency department patients. DESIGN: A prospective, nonrandomized, nonblinded time series. SETTING: The orthostatic and hypotensive patients were seen in a university hospital ED with 44,000 visits per year. Blood donors were studied in the hospital's blood donor center. TYPE OF PARTICIPANTS: Thirty-two adult ED patients who presented with a history suggestive of hypovolemia and either abnormal orthostatic vital signs (19) or frank hypotension (13), and 47 volunteer blood donors who ranged in age from 19 to 83 participated. INTERVENTIONS: Capillary refill was measured before rehydration in the ED subjects and, in the donor group, before and after a 450-mL blood donation. MEASUREMENTS: Sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, and positive and negative predictive values were calculated. Analyses were stratified by age, sex, and study group. MAIN RESULTS: For the blood donor group, mean capillary refill time before donation was 1.4 seconds and after donation was 1.1 seconds. Mean capillary refill time for the orthostatic group was 1.9 seconds and for the hypotensive group was 2.8 seconds. When scored with age-sex specific upper limits of normal, the sensitivity of capillary refill in identifying hypovolemic patients was 6% for the 450-mL blood loss group, 26% for the orthostatic group, and 46% for the hypotensive group. The accuracy of capillary refill in a patient with a 50% prior probability of hypovolemia is 64%. Orthostatic vital signs were found to be more sensitive and specific than capillary refill in detecting the 450-mL blood loss. CONCLUSION: Capillary refill does not appear to be a useful test for detecting mild-to-moderate hypovolemia in adults. 
Indications for and the technique of local resection of tumors of the papilla of Vater. Local resection of tumors of the papilla of Vater was performed in six cases (three benign adenomas and three adenocarcinomas). Pathology was suggested in all cases by endoscopic biopsy and confirmed by operative excision. A method of excision of the tumor and reconstruction of the pancreaticobiliary apparatus was used that eliminated all gross and microscopic disease. Only one of the patients with benign disease (familial polyposis) suffered from local recurrence. All three patients with malignant tumors developed local recurrences within 2 years of resection. Local resection seems to be a viable alternative to Whipple's resection in patients with benign tumors. In malignant cases, local resection should be considered only a palliative procedure and confined to elderly patients with severe concomitant disease and patients in whom a more radical procedure would incur an undue surgical risk. 
Influenza A and the virus associated haemophagocytic syndrome: cluster of three cases in children with acute leukaemia. At the height of the United Kingdom influenza A epidemic in December 1989, three children receiving treatment for non-T cell acute leukaemia developed pancytopenia with concomitant influenza A infection. Bone marrow histology showed prominent marrow erythrophagocytosis by morphologically mature histiocytes, consistent with the picture of virus associated haemophagocytic syndrome (VAHS). In two cases there was an initial spontaneous recovery, though recurrence of VAHS developed in one case in association with a different viral infection (cytomegalovirus) following autologous bone marrow transplantation. The third child died from cardiorespiratory failure secondary to infection with influenza A and Klebsiella pneumoniae sepsis. It is suggested that influenza A should be added to the list of infective causative agents. 
Localization of the gene encoding the GABAA receptor beta 3 subunit to the Angelman/Prader-Willi region of human chromosome 15. Deletions of the proximal long arm of chromosome 15 (bands 15q11q13) are found in the majority of patients with two distinct genetic disorders, Angelman syndrome (AS) and Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS). The deleted regions in the two syndromes, defined cytogenetically and by using cloned DNA probes, are similar. However, deletions in AS occur on the maternally inherited chromosome 15, and deletions in PWS occur on the paternally derived chromosome 15. This observation has led to the suggestion that one or more genes in this region show differential expression dependent on parental origin (genetic imprinting). No genes of known function have previously been mapped to this region. We show here that the gene encoding the GABAA (gamma-aminobutyric acid) receptor beta 3 subunit maps to the AS/PWS region. Deletion of this gene (GABRB3) was found in AS and PWS patients with interstitial cytogenetic deletions. Evidence of beta 3 gene deletion was also found in an AS patient with an unbalanced 13;15 translocation but not in a PWS patient with an unbalanced 9;15 translocation. The localization of this receptor gene to the AS/PWS region suggests a possible role of the inhibitory neurotransmitter GABA in the pathogenesis of one or both of these syndromes. 
Effect of hyaluronic acid on postoperative intraperitoneal adhesion formation and reformation in the rat model. The local application of 0.25% or 0.4% HA before the induction of a measured laser injury on the rat uterine horn was associated with a significant reduction (P less than 0.05) in postoperative IP adhesions when compared with the group of animals pretreated with the diluent vehicle PBS or received no pretreatment. However, 0.4% HA, when applied in a similar manner, was ineffective in reducing reformation of adhesions after microsurgical adhesiolysis. 
Cardiac involvement in patients with primary antiphospholipid syndrome. To evaluate cardiac involvement in primary antiphospholipid syndrome, two-dimensional and Doppler echocardiographic studies were performed in 34 consecutive patients with this syndrome. All patients had an increased level of serum anticardiolipin antibodies with no evidence of malignancy or systemic lupus erythematosus. The clinical manifestations of primary antiphospholipid syndrome were arterial thrombosis in 14 patients, venous thrombosis in 6 and recurrent fetal loss in 14. Valvular lesions were observed on two-dimensional echocardiography in 11 patients (32%) (9 women and 2 men), aged 24 to 57 years (mean +/- 1 SD 36 +/- 10). Abnormal echocardiographic findings were observed in 9 (64%) of 14 patients with arterial thrombosis versus 1 (17%) of 6 patients with venous thrombosis and 1 (7%) of 14 patients with recurrent fetal loss. The most common echocardiographic abnormality was mitral leaflet thickening, found in five patients; this was associated with mitral regurgitation in three and with combined mild mitral stenosis and regurgitation in one patient. Localized subvalvular mitral thickening was observed in one patient and calcification of the anulus in another. Aortic valve thickening was observed in two patients, one of whom also had a moderate degree of aortic regurgitation. Vegetation-like lesions on the mitral or aortic valve were found in two patients. It is concluded that valvular lesions are commonly found in primary antiphospholipid syndrome, particularly when the syndrome is manifested by peripheral arterial thrombosis. The location and appearance of valvular lesions in this syndrome are heterogeneous. Most patients have no clinically significant valvular disease. Two-dimensional and Doppler echocardiographic studies are often informative in these patients. 
Cerebral akinetopsia (visual motion blindness). A review. Cerebral akinetopsia is a syndrome in which a patient loses specifically the ability to perceive visual motion following cortical lesions outside the striate cortex. There has been only one good case of akinetopsia in the published literature. Yet that case was immediately accepted by the neurological world. In this, cerebral akinetopsia differs markedly from cerebral achromatopsia, the evidence for which was strongly contested for the better part of a century (Zeki, 1990). This article complements the one on cerebral achromatopsia, traces the history of akinetopsia and enquires into why it was so much more readily acceptable than achromatopsia. 
Normalisation of refractive error after steroid injection for adnexal haemangiomas. A longitudinal study of 27 patients with infantile haemangiomas is reported. It confirmed the efficacy of local steroid injection as a method of treatment; 81.5% of patients showed a marked improvement, with the lesion reducing to 25% or less of its original size. Involution was most marked in the first two weeks but continued for up to four months after injection. Amblyopia was present in 43% of children and was usually the result of induced refractive error rather than obstruction of the visual axis or strabismus. Anisometropia was found in 68% of children, with a high incidence of asymmetric astigmatism on the side of the haemangioma. Following local steroid injection a marked reduction in astigmatism was noted in 53.8% of children, a lesser reduction in 15.4%, and no reduction in 30.8%. Successful treatment of the haemangioma, therefore, may not remove the risk of amblyopia, and regular refraction and visual assessment remain mandatory. 
Association of postoperative apnea, airway obstruction, and hypoxemia in former premature infants. Airway obstruction plays an important role in the pathogenesis of apnea in premature infants who have not previously undergone anesthesia. To determine the role of airway obstruction in postoperative apnea, we studied 74 former premature infants by integrated recordings of nasal airflow, pneumocardiography, and pulse oximetry during the initial 2 h of recovery from inhalational anesthesia. Apnea (greater than 6 s) was classified as central, obstructive, or mixed, wherein mixed apnea consisted of central and obstructive apnea within the same apneic episode. Postoperative apnea was observed in 23 infants, ranging in age from 31-48 weeks postconception: 12 had inguinal herniorrhaphy (hernia group) and 11 had other procedures (other group). Of the 268 apneic episodes in the hernia group, 73% were central, 6% obstructive, and 21% mixed. Infants in the other group had 505 apneic episodes, with a distribution nearly identical to that in the hernia group. Central and mixed apnea occurred in all infants experiencing apnea, except in 1 infant, who had only central apnea, whereas obstructive apnea occurred in only one third of the apneic infants. Arterial hemoglobin desaturation was significantly more frequent at the end of mixed and obstructive apnea than after central apnea (P less than 0.01). In both groups, arterial hemoglobin O2 saturation (SpO2) decreased to less than 80% in approximately 35% of mixed and obstructive apneic episodes, compared to approximately 5% of central apneic episodes. SpO2 remained greater than or equal to 90% in over 80% of central apneic episodes, compared to 40% of mixed and obstructive apneic episodes. 
Combined portal vein and liver resection for carcinoma of the biliary tract. Twenty-nine patients with advanced carcinoma of the bile duct or gallbladder underwent combined portal vein and liver resection. Segmental excision of the portal vein was performed in 16 cases and wedge resection of the vessel wall in 13. The operative mortality rate was 17 per cent. The median survival for the 24 patients who left hospital was 19.8 months. Actuarial survival rates at 1, 3 and 5 years for all 29 patients were 48 per cent, 29 per cent, and 6 per cent respectively, whereas the median survival for 46 patients with unresectable carcinoma was 3 months and the 1 and 3-year actuarial survival rates were 13 per cent and zero respectively. This difference in survival times between patients undergoing hepatectomy with portal vein resection and those with unresectable carcinoma were statistically significant (P less than 0.01). Combined portal vein and liver resection is recommended as a reasonable surgical approach in selected patients with advanced carcinoma of the biliary tract. 
A reappraisal of the coelomic metaplasia theory by reviewing endometriosis occurring in unusual sites and instances. Endometriosis occurring in unusual sites and instances was reviewed for the purpose of exploring the pathogenesis of the disease. Endometriosis is frequently observed in the pelves of menstruating women. It occurs in teenagers even before menarche, in women who have never menstruated, and in postmenopausal women. It affects not only the pelvic organs but also the right-sided thoracic organs and rarely the extremities. It occurs in men who are castrated and treated with estrogen. The affected sites in both common and uncommon endometriosis include cells arising from the coelomic membrane and sites exposed to metaplasia-inducing substances such as estrogen and unknown factors liberated from the degenerating endometrium. This appears to strengthen the coelomic metaplasia theory, although additional basic and experimental data must still be accumulated to confirm this theory. 
Herpes zoster myelitis. We studied the clinical (10 patients) and pathological (9 patients) findings in 13 patients with herpes zoster myelitis, all of whom had systemic illnesses associated with immunosuppression. The median interval between the onset of the herpes zoster rash and myelopathic symptoms was 12 days, and the subsequent median interval to maximal deficit was 10.5 days. Presenting neurological symptoms were characteristically ipsilateral to the rash, with motor dysfunction predominating, followed by a spinothalamic and, less often, posterior column sensory deficit. Pathological involvement was most severe in the dorsal root entry zone and posterior horn of the spinal cord segment corresponding to the involved dermatome. There was variable spread both horizontally and vertically in the spinal cord. Direct varicella-zoster virus (VZV) infection of neuroectodermal cells, particularly oligodendrocytes, was demonstrated by immunostaining viral antigens (8 cases), and by the presence of Cowdry type A intranuclear inclusions (7 cases) and often was associated with focal demyelination (6 cases). In 4 patients a VZV vasculitis was associated with leptomeningitis and haemorrhagic necrosis (spinal cord in 1; brainstem or cerebellum in 3). The protracted evolution in many cases and the pathologically documented direct viral infection of the spinal cord provide a rational basis for the use of antiviral therapy in preventing or attenuating the evolving myelopathy. 
HLA association with dermatitis herpetiformis is accounted for by a cis or transassociated DQ heterodimer. HLA-DR, DQ, and DP restriction fragment genotyping was undertaken in 23 dermatitis herpetiformis patients and 53 healthy control subjects. HLA-DQw2 was present in 100% of patients with dermatitis herpetiformis (23 of 23) versus 40% of control subjects (21 of 53). Significant secondary associations occurred with HLA-DR3 (91% of patients versus 28% of control subjects) and DPw1 (39% of patients versus 11% of control subjects). Dermatitis herpetiformis and coeliac disease thus share an identical HLA class II association. It is likely that HLA class II genes directly influence the immune responses leading to mucosal damage in both diseases. The strongest candidate for disease susceptibility to dermatitis herpetiformis is DQw2. The HLA molecule most likely to be involved in coeliac disease is a specific DQ alpha/DQ beta heterodimer, encoded in cis arrangement in DR3 haplotypes or in trans arrangement in a DR5, 7 genotype. Our data on dermatitis herpetiformis patients fits this model perfectly. All these patients are capable of expressing this molecule, which may be responsible for the gluten sensitive enteropathy seen in a subgroup of patients with dermatitis herpetiformis and coeliac disease. 
Sequences of taxol and cisplatin: a phase I and pharmacologic study. Untreated and minimally pretreated solid tumor patients received alternating sequences of taxol and cisplatin. Sequential dose escalation of each agent using taxol doses of 110 or 135 mg/m2 and cisplatin doses of 50 or 75 mg/m2 resulted in four dosage permutations that induced grades 3 and 4 neutropenia in 72% to 84% and 50% to 53% of courses, respectively. Neutropenia was brief, and hospitalization for neutropenia and fever was required in 13% to 24% of courses. However, further escalation of taxol to 170 or 200 mg/m2 induced grade 4 neutropenia in 79% to 82% of courses. At the highest taxol-cisplatin dose level (200 mg/m2 to 75 mg/m2), the mean neutrophil count nadir was 98/microL, and hospitalization for neutropenia and fever was required in 64% of courses. The sequence of cisplatin before taxol, which has less antitumor activity in vitro, induced more profound neutropenia than the alternate sequence. Pharmacologic studies indicated that this difference was probably due to 25% lower taxol clearance rates when cisplatin preceded taxol. Although neurotoxicity was initially thought to be a potentially serious effect of the combination, mild to modest neurotoxicity occurred in only 27% of patients. Adverse effects also included myalgias, alopecia, vomiting, diarrhea, bradycardia, and asymptomatic ventricular tachycardia. Objective responses were noted in melanoma, as well as non-small-cell lung, ovarian, breast, head and neck, colon, and pancreatic carcinomas. Based on these results, the sequence of taxol before cisplatin at doses of 135 and 75 mg/m2, respectively, is recommended for phase II/III trials, with escalation of taxol to 170 mg/m2 if treatment is well tolerated. 
Nosocomial pneumonia in the critically ill: product of aspiration or translocation? OBJECTIVE: To examine the possibility that nosocomial pneumonias might be caused by the translocation of enteric bacteria and their toxins. DESIGN: Prospectively collected previous database was examined by logistic regression analysis. SETTING: University medical center. PATIENTS: Sixty-two ICU patients. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: The best stand-alone predictors for nosocomial pneumonia were bleeding from stress ulceration (p less than .001), the severity of illness present (p less than .001), and intramucosal acidosis in the stomach (p = .023), a metabolic indication of mucosal ischemia. Mechanical ventilation (p = .038) and the administration of antacids/cimetidine (p = .054) were also of stand-alone predictive value, but did not significantly improve the best predictive model for nosocomial pneumonia derived from the severity of illness present and the intramucosal pH in the stomach. CONCLUSIONS: The findings are consistent with the hypothesis that ischemic mucosal injury and its associated translocation of enteric bacteria and toxins might be more important in the pathogenesis of nosocomial pneumonia in the critically ill than the aspiration of contaminated nasopharyngeal secretions. 
Intrathecal morphine for postoperative analgesia in children after selective dorsal root rhizotomy. The authors report their experience with low doses (0.007-0.015 mg/kg), moderate doses (0.016-0.025 mg/kg), and high doses (0.026-0.035 mg/kg) of intrathecal morphine for postoperative analgesia after selective dorsal root rhizotomy surgery in 50 children, aged 3 to 12 years. After closure of the dura, a single dose of preservative-free morphine was injected into the subarachnoid space, and patients were assessed for 48 hours for level of comfort and side effects. The three doses of morphine provided equivalent analgesia and similar side effects. The duration of postoperative analgesia ranged from 3 to 48 hours (mean, 12.2 +/- 9.5 h). Common side effects were limited to nausea and vomiting (42%) and mild facial pruritus. No patient experienced late respiratory depression or generalized pruritus. The authors conclude that low doses of intrathecal morphine is as effective as moderate or high doses of morphine for reducing pain in the immediate postoperative period. Intrathecal morphine provides excellent analgesia after selective dorsal rhizotomy. 
Hypopituitarism. The pituitary regulates the body's endocrine system, including the thyroid gland, adrenal cortex, ovaries and testes, through the release of numerous hormones. Pituitary function, in turn, is regulated through complex feedback loops involving the hypothalamus and the target endocrine glands. Hypopituitarism may result from multiple causes, including primary and metastatic cancer, ischemic and granulomatous disease, infection, developmental abnormalities and trauma, which may affect the gland itself (primary hypopituitarism) or the hypothalamus (secondary hypopituitarism). Depending on the anatomic lesion, patients with hypopituitarism may present with signs or symptoms of multiple endocrine abnormalities, such as hypothyroidism, adrenal insufficiency, diabetes insipidus, hypoglycemia, sexual dysfunction and growth retardation. A thorough clinical history, detailed examination, laboratory evaluation of endocrine function and radiographic views of the pituitary and sella turcica can suggest the diagnosis and etiology. Treatment, usually lifelong, may include hormone replacement and medical or surgical correction of the underlying disease. 
Lithotripsy versus cholecystectomy for management of gallstones. A decision analysis by Markov process. Extracorporeal shock-wave lithotripsy is a new treatment method that effectively distintegrates radiolucent gallstones and is associated with a low complication rate. Using the model of a Markov process for decision analysis, survival and costs under four possible strategies to treat gallstones were compared: expectant management with cholecystectomy (EC) or lithotripsy (EL) reserved for symptomatic gallstones; prophylactic cholecystectomy (PC) or lithotripsy (PL) for all gallstones. Life expectancy for the different strategies varies by few days. Only if high annual rates of pain and complication occurred in subjects with silent gallstones would both prophylactic procedures marginally increase life expectancy. Prophylactic cholecystectomy then would be more cost-effective than prophylactic lithotripsy. Expectant strategies remain much cheaper than prophylactic management over a broad range of probability values and procedural costs. Expectant use of lithotripsy costs less than cholecystectomy. A low success rate of lithotripsy would raise the direct costs of lithotripsy above those of cholecystectomy but leave total costs of both strategies in the same order of magnitude. Lithotripsy appears to be a feasible alternative to treat symptomatic but not asymptomatic gallstones. 
Urinary retention after pyeloplasty. A retrospective review of 37 pyeloplasties, performed between 1984 and 1988, revealed that 38% of patients had post-operative retention requiring catheterisation, compared with 8% in an age and sex matched group of patients undergoing cholecystectomy. This suggests that direct surgical trauma to the upper genitourinary system may inhibit bladder function. We therefore suggest that pre-operative catheterisation should be considered in theatre, for patients undergoing pyeloplasty. 
Fatal pulmonary aspergillosis presenting as acute eosinophilic pneumonia in a previously healthy child. A previously healthy boy presented with cough and diffuse pulmonary interstitial infiltrates. Acute eosinophilic pneumonia was diagnosed by bronchoalveolar lavage in the absence of a demonstrable infectious etiologic agent. Corticosteroid therapy resulted in immediate improvement but was followed by respiratory distress and death from invasive aspergillosis and Pseudomonas cepacia sepsis. 
Otolaryngology problems in the immune compromised patient--an evolving natural history. As the human immunodeficiency virus is being detected in increasing numbers of asymptomatic individuals at risk, newer earlier patterns of disease have become apparent--including cranial and cervical herpes zoster, oral hairy leukoplakia, and oral candidiasis--thus linking viral and other disease to the development of acquired immunodeficiency disease (AIDS). Many similarities between patients with AIDS and other immunosuppressed patients have emerged. As immunosuppressed patients survive longer, they begin to manifest cancers such as lymphomas and squamous cell cancers in addition to Kaposi's sarcoma. Otolaryngologists can learn to identify and treat otitis and sinusitis in the immunosuppressed patient, to identify predictive early signs such as oral hairy leukoplakia, herpes simplex virus, and oral candidiasis, and to diagnose and treat Kaposi's sarcomas of the head and neck, lymphomas, squamous cell cancers, and opportunistic infections as the immunodeficiency disease progresses. 
The expression of proliferative-associated nuclear antigen p105 in gastric carcinoma. The expression of proliferation-associated nuclear antigen p105 of gastric carcinomas was studied by multiparameter flow cytometric and immunohistochemical technique. Multiparameter flow cytometric analysis revealed that p105 expression was rarely observed in the resting cells of normal gastric epithelium. On the contrary, the immunofluorescence (IF) intensity of cancer cells in G1 phase was approximately two-fold to three-fold greater than that of G0 phase of cancer cells or normal gastric epithelium. The p105 antigen content of cancer cells increased with cell cycle progression, and increased more rapidly in cells in late S-phase than in cells in G0 and early S-phase. Microphotometric study demonstrated that cells in M-phase exhibited a dramatic increase in the amount of the antigen, and the IF intensity of the mitotic cells were approximately five-fold to ten-fold greater than that of cells in G1 and S-phase. These results indicate that the antigen demonstrated by the p105 monoclonal antibody is present in the G1, S, G2, M-phases, but not in the G0 phase. Immunohistochemical technique demonstrated that patients with lymph node metastases are more likely to have high p105-positive rates than did node-negative patients. The mean p105-positive rates of aneuploid tumors was significantly higher than those of diploid tumors. From these results the authors speculate that the measurement of p105-positive rates may be a powerful prognostic indicator of gastric carcinoma. 
Anterior capsule adherence to iris leading to pseudophakic pupillary block. We present a rare case of anterior capsule adherence to the iris following extracapsular cataract extraction with posterior chamber intraocular lens implantation and leading to pseudophakic pupillary block. There were no synechiae at the pupillary margins associated with the capsule/iris adherence, but aqueous was entrapped behind the iris and intraocular pressure rose. Laser iridotomy was temporarily beneficial, but it had to be repeated several times. 
The renal growth hormone/insulin-like growth factor I axis. Collecting duct is a major site of insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I) synthesis within kidney. Production of IGF-I at this site is stimulated by growth hormone (GH). IGF-I produced in collecting duct is likely to act on glomerulus and proximal tubule via IGF-I receptors present at these locations. Renal IGF-I may be causative of the glomerular and proximal tubular hypertrophy that occurs in hypersomatotropic states, of compensatory renal hypertrophy, and of renal regeneration following acute ischemic injury. 
Evaluation of penile dorsal arteries and deep arteries in arteriogenic impotence. The dorsal and deep arteries are the 2 main blood supplies to the penis. High resolution ultrasonography was used to evaluate the role of these 2 sets of arteries in erection. A total of 44 impotent patients entered this study. We used duplex ultrasonography (Diasonic DRF/400) to assess the role of the dorsal and deep arteries in arteriogenic and nonarteriogenic impotent patients. Vascular velocity, as well as the change in diameter, was recorded before and after an intracavernous injection of 60 mg. papaverine. In the arteriogenic impotence group (28 patients, 63.6%), the velocity increments were 37.1 +/- 23.6 (right side) and 35.4 +/- 17.5 (left side) cm. per second in the dorsal arteries, and 8.3 +/- 5.9 (right side) and 12.6 +/- 5.6 (left side) cm. per second in the deep arteries. In the nonarteriogenic group (16 patients, 36.4%) the velocity increments were 46.5 +/- 25.2 and 41.1 +/- 22.4, respectively, in the dorsal arteries, and 37.3 +/- 16.5 and 37.5 +/- 15.8, respectively, in the deep arteries. Comparison of the velocity increments between the arteriogenic and nonarteriogenic groups revealed no difference in the dorsal arteries (p greater than 0.1) but a significant difference was noted in the deep arteries (p less than 0.01). Similar findings were also encountered when the velocities and diameter increments were compared. This study indicates that the deep arteries have an important role in erectile response, while the dorsal arteries are less important. 
Elevation of serum interleukin-6 concentration precedes acute-phase response and reflects severity in acute pancreatitis. Experimental studies have shown that interleukin-6 induces all major acute-phase proteins in the liver, including C-reactive protein. In 50 patients with acute pancreatitis, the serum concentrations of interleukin-6 and C-reactive protein were determined daily during the first week of hospitalization. Patients were divided into three groups according to clinical criteria: mild pancreatitis (less than or equal to 1 complication; n = 25), severe pancreatitis (greater than or equal to 2 complications; n = 15), and lethal outcome (n = 10). Patients with mild disease showed initially slightly elevated levels of interleukin-6 (22.0 +/- 9.8 U/mL) that decreased to low levels within 4 days (5.0 +/- 1.0 U/mL). In patients with severe pancreatitis, serum concentrations of interleukin-6 were initially clearly elevated (35.0 +/- 7.5 U/mL) and remained slightly elevated until day 7 (13.0 +/- 2.0 U/mL). Patients with lethal outcome had markedly elevated initial interleukin-6 concentrations (61.0 +/- 15.0 U/mL) that decreased but were still elevated at day 7 (26.0 +/- 2.5 U/mL). In all three groups, C-reactive protein concentrations followed the course of interleukin-6 concentrations by 1 day. There was a positive correlation between maximal interleukin 6 concentrations and maximal increases in the serum concentrations of C-reactive protein (r = 0.66). At days 1 and 2, increased (greater than 15 U/mL) interleukin-6 concentrations (positive predictive value, 91%; negative predictive value, 82%) predicted a severe or lethal course of the disease more accurately than elevated [greater than 0.10 g/L (greater than 10 mg/dL)] C-reactive protein concentrations (positive predictive value, 67%; negative predictive value, 79%). In conclusion, elevated serum concentrations of interleukin-6 followed by increased levels of C-reactive protein reflect the severity of acute pancreatitis. 
Acquired aphasia, dementia, and behavior disorder with epilepsy and continuous spike and waves during sleep in a child. Severe persistent neuropsychological disorders sometimes develop in the course of a focal epilepsy of unknown origin in previously normal children. Very frequent bilateral focal or generalized discharges are often noted on the sleep EEG records of these patients with no evidence of clinical seizures. The relation between these paroxysms and the observed deterioration remains unclear. We report a child with a partial complex epilepsy and severe disturbances of language, cognition, and behavior acquired in the early years of development who was followed for 15 years. A correlation between the evolution of the striking EEG abnormalities during sleep and the neuropsychological disorders could be established retrospectively. The observed sequence of onset and recovery of the aphasia, the dementia, and the "psychotic" behavior makes a direct causal relation between the deficits quite unlikely. Rather it suggests an association of independent symptoms with a specific language disorder becoming manifest in the course of the evolution. This child shows many of the main characteristics of the syndromes of "acquired aphasia with convulsive disorder" (Landau-Kleffner syndrome) and "epilepsy with continuous spike waves during sleep." Both syndromes describe probably different facets of a similar underlying, still unexplained cerebral dysfunction. 
Optimal dose of lignocaine for preventing pain on injection of propofol. The purpose of this study was to define the optimum dose of lignocaine required to reduce pain on injection of propofol. We conducted a prospective, randomized, double-blind trial on 310 patients undergoing anaesthesia. Patients were allocated to four groups according to the lignocaine dosage: group A (control), no lignocaine; group B, lignocaine 0.1 mg kg-1; group C, lignocaine 0.2 mg kg-1; group D, lignocaine 0.4 mg kg-1. Our results showed that a dose of lignocaine 0.1 mg kg-1 significantly reduced the incidence of pain and that there was no improvement when the dose was increased. 
Morphometric studies in intraductal breast carcinoma using computerized image analysis. A morphometric study was performed using computerized image analysis on the histologic specimens of 26 patients with intraductal carcinoma of the breast and 26 normal control patients. A significant incidence of necrosis (56%) was observed in the breast ducts containing intraductal carcinoma. This was characterized by one or more areas of necrosis surrounded by a rim of viable tumor cells. The mean diameter of the ducts containing intraductal carcinoma was 349 microns compared with a mean diameter of 90 microns for the normal ducts. The mean diameter of the ducts containing necrosis was 470 microns compared with a mean diameter of 192 microns for the ducts containing a solid pattern of intraductal carcinoma. Central necrosis occurred in 94% of the ducts more than 180 microns in radius, whereas only 34% of the ducts less than 180 microns in size contained necrosis. The width of the viable neoplastic tissue was less than 180 microns in 91% of the ducts. These results are analogous to the findings of Thomlinson and Gray in human lung tumor cords and provide indirect evidence for the existence of a hypoxic compartment in intraductal carcinoma of the breast. This could be an explanation for the higher local failure rate after conservative surgery and irradiation for infiltrating cancers containing an extensive intraductal component. 
Sequences of taxol and cisplatin: a phase I and pharmacologic study. Untreated and minimally pretreated solid tumor patients received alternating sequences of taxol and cisplatin. Sequential dose escalation of each agent using taxol doses of 110 or 135 mg/m2 and cisplatin doses of 50 or 75 mg/m2 resulted in four dosage permutations that induced grades 3 and 4 neutropenia in 72% to 84% and 50% to 53% of courses, respectively. Neutropenia was brief, and hospitalization for neutropenia and fever was required in 13% to 24% of courses. However, further escalation of taxol to 170 or 200 mg/m2 induced grade 4 neutropenia in 79% to 82% of courses. At the highest taxol-cisplatin dose level (200 mg/m2 to 75 mg/m2), the mean neutrophil count nadir was 98/microL, and hospitalization for neutropenia and fever was required in 64% of courses. The sequence of cisplatin before taxol, which has less antitumor activity in vitro, induced more profound neutropenia than the alternate sequence. Pharmacologic studies indicated that this difference was probably due to 25% lower taxol clearance rates when cisplatin preceded taxol. Although neurotoxicity was initially thought to be a potentially serious effect of the combination, mild to modest neurotoxicity occurred in only 27% of patients. Adverse effects also included myalgias, alopecia, vomiting, diarrhea, bradycardia, and asymptomatic ventricular tachycardia. Objective responses were noted in melanoma, as well as non-small-cell lung, ovarian, breast, head and neck, colon, and pancreatic carcinomas. Based on these results, the sequence of taxol before cisplatin at doses of 135 and 75 mg/m2, respectively, is recommended for phase II/III trials, with escalation of taxol to 170 mg/m2 if treatment is well tolerated. 
Femoro-femoral or ilio-femoral bypass for unilateral inflow reconstruction? Femoro-femoral and ilio-femoral bypass are two popular options for unilateral inflow reconstruction. In order to evaluate these alternative approaches, the records of 70 consecutive patients who underwent either femoro-femoral (n = 50) or ilio-femoral (n = 22) grafts were retrospectively reviewed. There were 46 men and 24 women, ranging in age from 27 to 84 years (mean: 66 years). Operative mortality was 10% for all femoro-femoral procedures, including 50% for emergent, 14% for synchronous, and 0% for solitary procedures; mortality was 9% for all ilio-femoral grafts including 20% for synchronous and 6% for solitary procedures. Among the elective solitary procedures, there was no significant difference with respect to operative time, blood loss, fluid requirement, time until resuming an oral diet, or duration of postoperative course for the two procedures. Five-year patency was 93% for all ilio-femoral and 57% for all femoro-femoral grafts. Although femoro-femoral bypass has been the more popular option for unilateral inflow reconstruction in this and other institutions, these findings justify the more widespread use of ilio-femoral bypass. 
Valvular heart disease: management and intervention. Clinical overview and discussion. The diagnosis and estimation of severity of valvular disease can usually be made by a well done history and physical examination. We now have a wealth of noninvasive techniques capable of imaging the heart and the great vessels. With Doppler echocardiography and magnetic resonance imaging we are beginning to develop methods that can measure pressures and flow. All of these advances have duplicated to a large extent the information obtainable in the past only from cardiac catheterization and angiography. In some instances, in aortic and mitral stenosis, for example, echo-Doppler evaluation is so good that catheterization is rendered unnecessary. The decision to send patients to surgery without catheterization is especially secure when the valvular obstruction is very severe. When the gradient is only moderately increased, then estimation of severity depends on flow, and in many cases these patients are sent to catheterization before surgery is recommended. With regurgitant lesions there is less confidence with noninvasive techniques that the severity is always correctly estimated, and therefore catheterization and angiography are more often necessary before sending the patient to surgery. At the present time cardiac catheterization and angiography are required 1) whenever there is an inconsistency between the clinical picture and noninvasive information, for example, the symptomatic patient with aortic stenosis who has mild-to-moderate aortic stenosis by echo-Doppler techniques, and 2) whenever additional information not obtainable by noninvasive techniques is necessary, for example, the need to know the status of the coronary arterial circulation. Noninvasive techniques have not in any way replaced a good history and physical examination. 
Malaria in an urban emergency department: epidemiology and diagnostic features of 25 cases. This article presents a retrospective study of 25 patients diagnosed with malaria in an urban emergency department (ED) between June 1986 and June 1989. The mean annual case rate of malaria in this study group was more than three times the national rate. This may be ascribed to the notable ethnic diversity of the population. A history of travel to an area endemic for malaria was eventually elicited from all patients. The most common chief complaint was fever (56%) followed by abdominal pain (12%). Temperatures were elevated in 70% of the patients, with a mean temperature of 102.9 degrees F (39 degrees C). Gender was found to play a role in delaying diagnosis, with women accounting for 83% of a group of patients requiring multiple ED visits before diagnosis. The authors conclude that malaria must be considered when diagnosing patients in ethnically diverse populations. Gender may be associated with a delay in diagnosis. A careful travel history and a peripheral smear are aids in rapid diagnosis. 
Symptomatic xanthogranuloma of choroid plexus with unilateral hydrocephalus. Case report. Xanthogranulomas involving the choroid plexus of the lateral ventricles are generally asymptomatic lesions. The case is reported of a 50-year-old man in whom a xanthogranuloma of the choroid plexus had occluded the left trigone, causing unilateral hydrocephalus of the left temporal horn and neurological symptoms. A review of the literature shows that xanthogranulomas of the glomus of the lateral ventricles differ from the xanthomatous cystic lesions of the third ventricle, which are probably akin to colloid cysts. 
Inherited protein C deficiency and nonhemorrhagic arterial stroke in young adults. Out of a consecutive series of 50 young people less than 45 years old with nonhemorrhagic arterial stroke, three patients had inherited protein C deficiency. CT revealed hypodense areas consistent with the clinical picture, and angiography showed occlusion of some intracranial arterial vessels. Other possible associated causes of stroke were ruled out. One patient had a transient ischemic attack and a peripheral venous thrombosis prior to the actual stroke, whereas the others were completely asymptomatic, as were relatives with the same deficiency. We suggest determining protein C in ischemic stroke of all young adults, especially when major risk factors are excluded. 
Problems in the surgical treatment of interstitial cystitis. Two series of patients with histologically proven interstitial cystitis that was unresponsive to hydrostatic bladder distension and intravesical chemotherapy with dimethyl sulfoxide have been studied. In the first series 24 patients were treated by subtotal cystectomy and substitution cystoplasty without further consideration; 8 of these 24 patients had persistent frequency due to active disease in the remaining trigone and/or urethra and in 2 cases this was severe. Because of this experience the second group of patients had routine biopsy of the trigone and assessment of urethral sensation as part of the initial assessment. In those in whom the trigone was unaffected, treatment was unchanged. If the trigone was affected, total cystourethrectomy was performed with substitution cystourethroplasty unless the patient chose or was advised to avoid surgery altogether or to have a simpler option such as conduit or continent urinary diversion. Trigonal biopsies should be part of the routine assessment of all patients being considered for surgery, since residual active disease is a major cause of dissatisfaction after subtotal cystectomy and substitution cystoplasty. 
Psychological aspects of orthognathic surgery: how people respond to facial change. This study was undertaken to explore the motivations and problems shared by adult orthognathic surgical patients over the age of 25. Objective findings included demographic information and reasons for seeking surgery. The majority of 65 respondents cited functional problems as their primary reason for seeking treatment. Eighty-nine percent were pleased with esthetic changes, and 83% responded that the functional problem had been corrected. For most, the greatest discomfort related to the surgery was the postoperative intensive care unit. Two of the most common side effects of the surgery were the loss of sensation in the lips and chin area and a short period of depression. Women had depression more often than men but were more enthusiastic about the final results of the procedure. Two major areas of interest to surgeons emerged from the research. First, although women have functional problems, the majority seem to have a desire for cosmetic improvement. Having a functional problem seemed to provide the psychological permission necessary to spend the time and money for a cosmetic change. The second point focused on the need for good communication between surgeon and patient. The patients who were more positive toward the procedure and more satisfied with the results were those who were better informed and who thought they had a good system of communication with the orthodontist, surgeon, and their respective staffs. 
Radiotherapy improves the outlook for patients older than 1 year with Pediatric Oncology Group stage C neuroblastoma. Children older than 1 year of age who have neuroblastoma with complete or partial removal of the primary tumor and positive intracavitary lymph nodes (Pediatric Oncology Group [POG] stage C) are a small but higher-risk subset of patients. To further evaluate the importance of identifying patients with POG stage C neuroblastoma and to assess the efficacy and toxicity of adding concurrent radiation therapy (RT) to chemotherapy (CT) in these children, a randomized study was conducted. Eligible patients received cyclophosphamide 150 mg/m2 orally days 1 to 7 and Adriamycin (doxorubicin; Adria Laboratories, Columbus, OH) 35 mg/m2 intravenously (IV) on day 8 (CYC/ADR) every 3 weeks for five courses with or without RT to primary tumor and regional lymph nodes (24 to 30 Gy/16 to 20 fractions). Second-look surgery was advised to evaluate response and to remove residual disease. Continuation therapy alternated CYC/ADR every 3 weeks with cisplatin 90 mg/m2 day 1 followed by teniposide 100 mg/m2 day 3 (CDP/VM) for two courses each. Secondary CT with CDP/VM alone was available for patients not achieving complete response (CR) following induction treatment and second-look surgery. Of 29 eligible patients randomized to CT alone, 13 achieved CR, and nine are disease-free (NED) 1 to 52 months (median, 35 months) off therapy. Twenty-two of 33 eligible cases treated with CT/RT attained CR, and 19 are NED 1 to 77 months (median, 23 months) off therapy. Local and metastatic relapses occurred in both arms. Differences in CR, event-free survival, and survival rates were significant, P = .013, .009, and .008, respectively. Surgical compliance was excellent and complications uncommon. Therapy was tolerable in both groups but hematopoietic toxicity was more common in the CT/RT arm. We conclude that POG stage C neuroblastoma in children older than 1 year of age is a higher-risk group that should be identified, that CT/RT provides superior initial and long-term disease control compared with CT alone in this patient subset, and that the occurrence of metastatic failures in both treatment groups suggests a need for more aggressive chemotherapy. 
Higher recurrence rate after coronary angioplasty in unstable angina pectoris. PURPOSE: Recurrent stenosis after percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA) is a significant problem, requiring repeat dilation in about one-third of all treated patients. Various clinical and procedure-related predictors have been proposed. Between 1983 and 1987, 257 patients underwent 322 procedures, where 380 stenoses were attempted. Indications were: stable angina pectoris 73%, unstable angina pectoris 22%, other indication 5%. The primary success rate was defined as a less than 50% remaining postprocedure stenosis. FINDINGS: Repeat angiograms were done for 88% of the initially successful cases, either six months after PTCA or if there was a clinical recurrence. Restenosis was defined as a recurrence of a more than 50% diameter stenosis. The restenosis rate was 33% and was significantly higher (p less than 0.05) for unstable (46%) than for stable angina pectoris (29%). There was a nonsignificant tendency to a higher restenosis rate in the left anterior descending artery than in the other coronary vessels. IMPLICATIONS: The increased restenosis rate seen after PTCA for unstable angina pectoris could be caused by a higher activity in systems affecting the proliferative processes in the smooth muscle cells of the arterial wall, which is thought to form the pathophysiologic basis for restenosis after PTCA. 
Pulmonary origin of left anterior descending coronary artery in tetralogy of Fallot. We report the case of a 4-year-old girl with an anomalous origin of the left anterior descending coronary artery from the pulmonary artery in association with tetralogy of Fallot. Creation of an intrapulmonary tunnel from a newly created aortopulmonary window to the coronary ostium in the pulmonary trunk and total repair of tetralogy of Fallot were successfully carried out. The advantage of intrapulmonary tunnel technique (Takeuchi method) for this very rare combination is stressed. 
Operative survival and 40 year follow up of surgical repair of aortic coarctation. OBJECTIVE--To study early and late mortality after surgical correction of coarctation of the aorta. DESIGN--Data on 223 patients operated on at the Westminster Hospital, London, between 1946 and 1981, were collected and updated by questionnaire. PARTICIPANTS--All 223 patients recorded as undergoing operation for aortic coarctation up to the end of 1981. Fifteen of 197 survivors were lost to follow up; most of them were patients from overseas. OUTCOME AND RESULTS--The early mortality (within one month of operation) was 12% overall, 2.6% for elective surgery, and 0% for the 77 patients undergoing surgery since 1968. Survivors were followed up for a total of 3288 patient years; in 27 follow up lasted more than 30 years. In a few it reached 40 years. Twenty two patients died during this period, 18 from causes that could be attributed to coarctation or its repair. Mortality was highest more than 20 years after the operation. CONCLUSION--Repair increased life expectancy in patients with aortic coarctation. Late problems caused by persistent hypertension or recoarctation became apparent in long term survivors. The increased risk of late mortality associated with the duration of preoperative hypertension was not statistically significant. There were no deaths from cerebrovascular accidents. (In an earlier necropsy series cerebrovascular accidents accounted for 11.8% of deaths.) The incidence of deaths from aneurysms resembled that in the earlier necropsy series. 
Pneumoparotid: a case report. Pneumoparotid is an unusual condition resulting from air being forced into the parotid ductal system. When it develops, it is a result of increased intraoral air pressure. Diagnosis is based on the etiologic factor, palpatory evidence of tissue emphysema, the escape of frothy saliva from the involved duct, and the sialographic finding of retained ductal air and ductal infection. 
Vascular trauma as a result of therapeutic procedures for the treatment of malignancy. Twenty-two iatrogenic vascular injuries caused by resection of tumors with local recurrences or adjuvant chemotherapy were treated over a 42-month period in 11 female and 8 male patients with cancer (58% had documented metastases). Sixteen of 22 vascular injuries were caused by intraarterial administration of chemotherapy (8 emboli; 8 direct catheter trauma), and six were caused by resection of tumors with local invasion. The injuries were extremity ischemia (15 extremities in 13 patients), pseudoaneurysm (4), expanding hematoma (3 injuries in 2 patients). Twenty-two surgical repairs included bypass of severely damaged arteries in five, embolectomy in five, interposition grafts in three, pseudoaneurysm resection and primary repair in three, primary repair of three vascular injuries, and one patch angioplasty. Leg amputation was required in two patients. Seventeen of 19 patients had successful vascular repairs with resolution of preoperative indications for vascular repair without intraoperative or postoperative deaths. Long term follow-up (mean, 17 months) showed no recurrence of vascular problems; however, two patients died of metastatic cancer at 6 and 24 weeks after vascular repair. This study supports an aggressive approach to the management of vascular injuries caused by therapeutic interventions for malignancy despite the presence of metastatic disease. 
Abnormal guanine nucleotide regulatory protein in MVP dysautonomia: evidence from reconstitution of Gs. We and others have used the term MVP dysautonomia for a particular subset of hyperadrenergic dysautonomia patients. The role of the stimulatory guanine nucleotide regulatory protein (Gs) in this dysautonomia was studied by cholate extraction of Gs from erythrocytes from 11 normal subjects and 14 symptomatic dysautonomic patients and reconstitution into cyc-S49 lymphoma membranes, which have normal receptor and adenylyl cyclase but lack Gs. Isoproterenol-stimulated adenylyl cyclase activity in the dysautonomia group was increased compared to that in controls [3.66 +/- 0.20 (mean +/- SE; n = 14) vs. 2.87 +/- 0.14 (n = 11) U cyc- reconstituted activity/mg erythrocyte protein; P less than 0.05]. beta-Adrenergic receptor high affinity state formation was greatest in the severely symptomatic group [KL/KH: severe symptoms, 130 +/- 48 (n = 6); mild symptoms, 33 +/- 7 (n = 7); control, 27 +/- 6 (n = 11); severe dysautonomia distinct, P less than 0.017]. Sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gels of cholera toxin-dependent ADP-ribosylated G-proteins yielded no gross distinction between severely symptomatic and control groups. This subset of hyperadrenergic dysautonomia patients, thus, has supercoupled beta 2-adrenergic receptors (increase in both agonist binding and cyclase activation) conferred by an abnormal Gs, whose effects on agonist binding reflect the severity of illness. 
Ischemic complications of abdominal aortic surgery. From 1982 through 1988, 634 consecutive patients underwent abdominal aortic reconstruction for occlusive (37%) or aneurysmal (63%) disease. We studied the ischemic problems affecting the branches of the aorta, excluding the coeliac and superior mesenteric arteries. Ischemic colitis (0.6%), spinal cord ischemia (0.16%), renal insufficiency (17%), and lower limbs ischemia (6.5%) were the major problems encountered. We identified the most significant factors associated with these complications such as hypotension, emergency, hypovolemia, preoperative renal function, suprarenal clamping, the quality of the preoperative investigation, and have suggested some specific preventive measures. 
Asbestos induced pericardial effusion and constrictive pericarditis. The number of disorders attributable to asbestos exposure has increased gradually over the years. The latest to be recorded is pericardial effusion and constrictive pericarditis, and three cases are reported here. A man with bilateral pleural thickening and plaques developed acute pericarditis and an effusion and was treated by pericardiectomy. Two men died from constrictive pericarditis associated with bilateral pleural effusions and diffusion pleural thickening. The pericardium showed nonspecific fibrous thickening. All had been occupationally exposed to asbestos. In the fatal cases the lungs contained amphibole fibres, in keeping with a modest degree of occupational exposure. Asbestos produces progressive fibrosis of the pericardium that is similar to diffuse pleural thickening and may be fatal. Both conditions may develop after relatively short or light exposure. 
The phenotype of the X-linked dystonia-parkinsonism syndrome. An assessment of 42 cases in the Philippines. The clinical phenotype of X-linked recessive torsion dystonia was documented in 42 affected individuals from 21 families. In 7 families, there were 9 sibships (core families) with 2 or more affected individuals available for evaluation. The ages of the patients ranged from 29 to 79 years with a mean of 46.2 +/- 10.1 years; the mean age of onset of dystonia was 35.0 +/- 8.0 years with a range of 12 to 48 years; and the mean duration of illness was 11.1 +/- 7.9 years. First manifestations were noted in the lower extremities in 36%, the axial musculature in 29%, the upper extremities in 23%, and in the head in 12% of the cases. The majority of patients displayed gait abnormalities (90%), leg dystonia (79%), oromandibular dystonia (64%), neck dystonia (57%), blepharospasm (57%), and truncal dystonia (52%). The disease generalized in 90% of the cases within 1 to 11 years of onset (median duration, 5 years). Overall, the condition was disabling, but the Fahn-Marsden disability score did not correlate with age of onset, duration of illness, site of onset, rate of generalization, or presence of parkinsonism. Thirty-six percent of the cases displayed at least 1 of the following "parkinsonian symptoms": bradykinesia, tremor, rigidity, loss of postural reflexes and a shuffling gait. Parkinsonism was diagnosed as definite in 14%, probable in 2%, and possible in 19% of the cases. Given this high association of dystonia and parkinsonism, we propose to call the disorder X-linked dystonia-parkinsonism syndrome (XDP). 
Computer- and robot-assisted resection of thalamic astrocytomas in children. Six children ranging in age from 2 to 10 years who harbored deep benign astrocytomas were operated upon using a computer- and robot-assisted system. A radical excision was achieved in all cases with no significant morbidity nor any mortality. The system consists of an interactive, three-dimensional display of computed tomographic image contours and digitized cerebral angiograms taken using the Brown-Roberts-Wells stereotactic frame. The surgical retractor is held and manipulated using a PUMA 200 robot. The position and orientation of the surgical retractor is displayed on the three-dimensional display. Preoperative planning and simulation are important features of this system. Movement of the brain after removal of the tumor and cerebrospinal fluid is substantial, so the tumor removal is based on visually defined margins. Enhanced computer graphics and robotic devices are important adjuncts to neurosurgical procedures and will find increasing use in the future. 
Randomized trial of doxorubicin, bisantrene, and mitoxantrone in advanced breast cancer: a Southwest Oncology Group study. Four hundred eleven women with metastatic breast cancer were randomly assigned to receive either 60 mg/m2 doxorubicin (130 patients), 320 mg/m2 bisantrene (146 patients), or 14 mg/m2 mitoxantrone (135 patients). The doses were given intravenously every 3 weeks with a cross-over design to determine their relative efficacy and toxicity. To be eligible, patients must have had one previous chemotherapy regimen, and patients who were estrogen receptor positive must have failed endocrine therapy. There were 365 patients assessable for response and 399 assessable for toxic effects. The median age was 57 years; 18% were premenopausal or perimenopausal. Visceral dominant disease was present in 66% of the patients. Ninety-seven percent of the patients had a disease-free interval from diagnosis to first recurrence of less than 1 year. The response rate was 28% with doxorubicin, 13% with bisantrene, and 14% with mitoxantrone (P = .004). Median time to treatment failure was 133 days with doxorubicin, 66 days with bisantrene, and 68 days with mitoxantrone (logrank P = .06). The median survival was 315 days for doxorubicin, 290 days for bisantrene, and 177 days for mitoxantrone (logrank P = .04), although survival at 2 years was similar for all three agents. There were five responses in the 66 patients crossed over to doxorubicin and one response each for patients crossed over to bisantrene (39 patients) or mitoxantrone (63 patients). Toxicity leading to discontinuance of therapy was more common with doxorubicin, and discontinuance of therapy was due primarily to patient's request or cardiotoxicity. The major dose-limiting toxic effect for all three agents was leukopenia. Nausea and vomiting, mucositis, and alopecia were more severe with doxorubicin. Congestive heart failure developed in nine patients treated with doxorubicin, zero patients treated with bisantrene, and two patients treated with mitoxantrone. A decrease in the left ventricular ejection fraction, as defined by moderate to severe Alexander grade changes, was more common in patients treated with doxorubicin (doxorubicin-treated patients = 20%, bisantrene-treated patients = 5%, and mitoxantrone-treated patients = 10%). This study demonstrates that bisantrene and mitoxantrone have only modest activity in metastatic breast carcinoma. The activity of doxorubicin is greater than that of the other two agents, but at a cost of increased toxicity. 
Myocardial infarction with minimal coronary atherosclerosis in the era of thrombolytic reperfusion. The Thrombolysis and Angioplasty in Myocardial Infarction (TAMI) Study Group. The incidence of minimal residual atherosclerotic coronary obstruction after successful intravenous thrombolytic therapy was evaluated in 799 patients with acute myocardial infarction. Minimal residual coronary obstruction (less than or equal to 50%) was observed on selective coronary angiography performed 90 min after initiation of thrombolytic therapy in 43 patients (5.5%). In 42 other patients (5.4%), a greater than 50% but less than 100% residual stenosis noted at 90 min demonstrated further resolution of obstruction to less than 50% at an angiographic follow-up study 7 to 10 days later. Patients with minimal residual coronary obstruction were significantly younger (52 +/- 10.7 versus 56.7 +/- 10 years; p = 0.002) and had less multivessel coronary disease (p less than 0.001), better initial left ventricular ejection fraction (54 +/- 12% versus 50.2 +/- 11.4%; p = 0.006) and a lower in-hospital mortality rate (1% versus 7%; p = 0.04) than did patients who had a significant (greater than 50%) residual coronary obstruction after intravenous thrombolysis. Long-term follow-up study of patients with a minimal coronary lesion (average 1.5 +/- 0.6 years) and those with significant residual stenosis (average 1.6 +/- 0.7 years) demonstrated that the incidence of death (2.4% in patients with minimal stenosis versus 3.5% in those with significant stenosis) and recurrent myocardial infarction (5% each) were similar in both groups. New strategies are needed to prevent coronary rethrombosis in patients with minimal atherosclerosis after thrombolytic therapy for acute myocardial infarction. 
Cor triatriatum with isolated pulmonary venous stenosis in an adult: diagnosis with transesophageal two-dimensional echocardiography. The diagnosis of cor triatriatum in an adult was made from routine two-dimensional transthoracic echocardiography. The findings of aliasing and turbulence in the roof of the left atrium suggested pulmonary venous stenosis. A transesophageal echocardiogram defined both the hemodynamic features of nonobstructing cor triatriatum and the presence of isolated pulmonary venous stenosis. The clinical use of transesophageal echocardiography with color flow Doppler in the elucidation of complex anatomic substrate is demonstrated. 
Regulation of thyrotropin-releasing hormone receptors is cell type specific: comparison of endogenous pituitary receptors and receptors transfected into non-pituitary cells. TRH, which does not elevate cyclic AMP, and elevation of cellular cyclic AMP decrease the density (down-regulate) of TRH receptors (TRH-Rs) on pituitary (GH3) cells. In this study we measured the effects of TRH and elevation of cyclic AMP on TRH-Rs expressed in non-pituitary cells transfected with a recently cloned mouse pituitary TRH-R complementary DNA. In stably transfected rat glioma (C6-2) cells and transiently transfected COS-1 cells TRH caused TRH-R down-regulation while elevation of cyclic AMP caused increases in TRH-R density. Hence, the effects of cyclic AMP on TRH-Rs in transfected C6-2 and COS-1 cells are different from those in GH3 cells while the effects of TRH on TRH-R are similar in all three cell types. These data show that regulation of TRH-Rs is cell type specific. 
Malignant tumours of the middle ear. The authors present 15 patients with middle ear malignant tumours, of which 13 were squamous cell carcinomas, one was a rhabdomyosarcoma and one a malignant lymphoma. In 11 of 13 patients with squamous cell carcinoma, long-standing chronic otitis media preceded the malignant process and only in 2 patients did the tumour develop without previous chronic infection. Most of the patients presented at an advanced stage of the disease: in 6 the tumour had destroyed surrounding bone, commonly involving the endocranium; in 7 the facial nerve was paralysed and in 8 patients there was total hearing loss. The diagnosis of malignant tumour was established before surgery in 5 patients, but 8 patients were operated upon for suspected chronic otitis. Three patients died without treatment and 10 were treated: 3 with radiotherapy because the tumour was inoperable, 3 had surgery only and 4 patients had surgery and received radiotherapy post-operatively. Of 7 operated patients only 2 are alive without signs of tumour. Our findings suggest that otologists should bear in mind this disease in patients with chronic suppurative otitis and accompanying suspected symptoms. In 2 patients with rare types of sarcoma of the middle ear the diagnosis of tumour was established at an advanced stage and they could not be treated. 
Chronic ulcerations following topical therapy with 5-fluorouracil for vaginal human papillomavirus-associated lesions. Applied topically to the vagina, 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) cream is an effective therapy for human papillomavirus (HPV)-associated lesions of the vagina including condylomata acuminata and vaginal intraepithelial neoplasia. Although the acute side effects of 5-FU therapy are well recognized, long-term sequelae of intravaginal 5-FU use have not been described in detail in the literature. To assess the incidence and clinical course of 5-FU-related vaginal mucosal alterations, we studied 220 patients who underwent 5-FU therapy for HPV-associated lesions of the vagina. Eighteen women (8.2%) had epithelial ulcers 6 months after completion of the 5-FU treatment. The incidence of ulcers was higher in women who used 5-FU for longer than 10 weeks compared with those who used it for 10 weeks or less (9.6 versus 5.7%; P = .05). All but one of the mucosal defects were in the vaginal fornices and/or the periphery of the ectocervix. The ulcers were mostly singular and measured 0.5-7 cm in greatest diameter. Fourteen patients (77.8%) had symptoms related to the ulcers including a serosanguineous or watery discharge (55.6%), postcoital spotting or bleeding (44.4%), irregular bleeding unrelated to intercourse (16.7%), and pain (5.6%). Spontaneous healing of the ulcers was protracted. Office methods of therapy including estrogen creams and cauterizing agents failed to accelerate healing as compared with untreated patients. Excision of the ulcer and primary closure of the wound was curative in all four cases in which it was used. We conclude that topical 5-FU therapy may lead to troublesome chronic mucosal ulcers that tend to persist despite conservative treatment attempts. 
Coronary focal ectasia formation following percutaneous transluminal angioplasty. Focal ectasia of the right coronary artery developed following percutaneous transluminal angioplasty. Operative intervention was not deemed necessary. No restenosis was found on repeat coronary angiography. Five-yr follow-up was associated with a benign course. 
Iatrogenic renal disease. We studied iatrogenic problems in nephrology by classifying all patients for nephrology consultation into nine presenting syndromes and seven etiologic groups. One hundred (2.2%) of all admissions were seen in nephrology consultation. Acute renal failure was the most common presenting syndrome, accounting for 59% of the consultations. Forty-one of the 100 consultations (1% of all admissions) had a renewal syndrome of iatrogenic origin. Of these 41 patients, 38 had acute renal failure and three had fluid and electrolyte problems. Twenty of the 41 patients had drug-induced problems. Eighteen of these patients were dehydrated, and in three patients, acute renal failure occurred after surgery. Of the 20 patients with iatrogenic renal problems caused by drugs, seven problems were antibiotic related, five were due to diuretics, four were due to nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, three were due to angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, and one was from the use of contrast medium. The 41 patients with iatrogenic-related renal disease were older than the other 59 patients (61.8 vs 49.3 years). Iatrogenic renal disease developed in 1% of all patients admitted to a tertiary care hospital, and 12% of these patients died. The most common renal syndrome is acute renal failure, most often caused by nephrotoxic drugs. The incidence can probably be decreased by better monitoring of body weight and fluid balance to prevent dehydration and by the avoidance of nephrotoxic drugs. 
Incidence of neuropathy in 395 patients with ovarian cancer treated with or without cisplatin. In two consecutive trials, a total of 395 patients with ovarian cancer were treated with a combination of hexamethylmelamine, cyclophosphamide, methotrexate, and 5-fluorouracil chemotherapeutic regimens including cisplatin or without this drug. With respect to neurotoxicity, 387 patients were fully eligible. The median follow-up for survival was 45 months. Neurotoxicity in any grade of severity developed in 47% of the patients treated with a cisplatin-containing regimen and in 25% of those treated with the non-cisplatin-containing regimen. The severity of neurotoxicity was much higher, however, in the cisplatin-treated patients. Neurotoxicity-free survival decreased below 50% at cumulative doses of cisplatin between 500 and 600 mg/m2. No additional effect of hexamethylmelamine on the incidence or severity of neurotoxicity could be demonstrated. In patients who survived for more than 5 years, the incidence of cisplatin neuropathy was 61%. Prognostic variables (age, International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics [FIGO] stage, performance status, and others) possibly associated with high-risk subgroups could not be identified. The only consistent factor correlated with neurotoxicity was the total dose of cisplatin received. 
Initial clinical experience with a 48 by 48 element biplane transesophageal probe. Recent technologic advances in ultrasound have resulted in the capability of transesophageal echocardiographic imaging in both transverse and longitudinal planes. Previous biplane probes suffered from inferior images because of reduced scan elements. We evaluated the utility of a prototype 48 X 48 element biplane transesophageal probe in 23 consecutive patients. Examinations were well tolerated with no side effects. In comparison to the single transverse plane, imaging with the longitudinal plane gave superior information on prosthetic valve pathology, atrial septal abnormalities, and pathoanatomy of the ascending aorta and mitral valve. Complementary information was provided by the longitudinal plane in patients with endocarditis and vegetations and in mitral protheses. Images obtained with this 48 X 48 element biplane probe along with color and spectral Doppler information were not perceptibly inferior to those obtained by single-plane probes. In conclusion, biplane transesophageal echocardiography with a 48 X 48 element probe indicates a great potential for enhanced three-dimensional understanding of cardiac pathology and diagnostic yield in specific pathologies. 
Risk of adverse events in children completing treatment for acute lymphoblastic leukemia: St. Jude Total Therapy studies VIII, IX, and X. We studied the frequency, causes, and predictors of adverse events in 624 patients who had completed treatment for acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) in three consecutive total therapy studies (VII, IX, and X, 1972 to 1983). Event-free survival in study X was significantly better overall than that in studies VIII and IX (P less than .0001 by the log-rank test). In study X, 75% of the patients were electively taken off therapy, compared with 54% in studies VIII and IX. However, the risks of having an adverse event during the first 5 years after completion of therapy were remarkably similar: 22% (95% confidence interval, 17% to 29%) in study X versus 24% (20% to 29%) in studies VIII and IX. Bone marrow, testicular, and CNS relapses accounted for the majority of failures in both groups (85% in study X and 92% in studies VIII and IX). Late adverse events consisted largely of hematologic relapses and the development of solid tumors. Black race (P = .001) and leukemia without an anterior mediastinal mass (P = .05) were associated with an increased risk of failure after completion of treatment in the two earlier clinical trials, whereas a lower leukemic cell DNA content (DNA index less than 1.16) was the only predictor of late treatment failure in the more recent trial (P = .019). None of the other presenting features that were examined (eg, age, leukocyte count, and sex) had value as predictors of late failure. Thus, improved treatment altered the impact of specific prognostic factors and the distribution of sites of relapse, but it did not significantly affect the risk of delayed failure. 
An open, multicenter trial of recombinant tissue plasminogen activator in acute stroke. A progress report. The rt-PA Acute Stroke Study Group. Sixteen clinical centers in two countries have undertaken a prospective open angiography- and computed tomography scan-based safety and efficacy dose-rate finding study of recombinant (two-chain) tissue plasminogen activator (rt-PA) in acute thrombotic and thromboembolic stroke. Preliminary experience with 71 rt-PA treated patients in seven dose-rate groups has demonstrated both partial and complete recanalization, documented by angiography, although a dose response has not yet been achieved. Hemorrhagic infarction has been documented at all dose rates, and dose-rate independent cerebral hematomas have been observed. The study continues at higher dose rates while still remaining within the safety guidelines. 
Intraoperative identification of cardiac patients at risk to develop postoperative atrial fibrillation. Postoperative atrial fibrillation (AF) is a complication occurring in 11% to 36% of patients after cardiac operations, which results in increased morbidity and hospital costs. A new electrophysiologic screening test was developed to identify those patients at risk for development of postoperative AF. The test was validated in 50 patients (43 men and 7 women) with a mean age of 59.6 +/- 1.3 years who underwent coronary artery bypass grafting with or without other cardiac surgical procedures. After aortic and venous cannulation, but before initiation of bypass, the mid-right atrium was stimulated with a bipolar probe at 25 microA for 3 seconds. Alternating current was increased by 25 microA until AF was induced or up to a maximum of 200 microA. Postoperative AF occurred in 18 patients (36%), 17 of whom had inducible AF (sensitivity = 0.94). Of the remaining 32 AF-free patients, 13 had negative tests (specificity = 0.41). Age and sex were not factors affecting inducibility, although patients who developed AF were older than those who were AF free (63.6 versus 57.3 years, p = 0.02). Length of stay in the intensive care unit was longer for those with postoperative AF than for AF-free patients (3.6 versus 1.9 days, p = 0.02). The negative predictive value of the test was 0.93, and the positive value was 0.47. These data show that this new intraoperative technique may be used to identify patients at risk for postoperative AF. Prophylactic therapy can therefore be directed to only those patients at risk for postoperative AF. 
Two patients with insulin resistance due to decreased levels of insulin-receptor mRNA. Mutations have been identified in the insulin-receptor gene in insulin-resistant patients. We studied two patients with acanthosis nigricans and insulin resistance caused by a decrease in the number of cell surface insulin receptors. Patient 1 was an 11-yr-old boy with a fasting insulin level of 2130 pM; patient 2 was a 14-yr-old girl with hyperandrogenism and a fasting insulin level of 580-740 pM. Based on Southern-blotting studies, the structure of both alleles of the insulin-receptor gene in both patients appeared to be grossly normal. There was no evidence of insertions, deletions, or major rearrangements. Moreover, the nucleotide sequences of all 22 exons of the gene were normal in both patients. Thus, the predicted amino acid sequences of both patients' insulin receptors were normal. In Epstein-Barr virus-transformed lymphoblasts from patient 1, insulin-receptor mRNA levels were so low they could not be detected with an RNase A protection assay, whereas mRNA levels from patient 2 were in the lower half of the normal range. By use of a more sensitive assay based on the polymerase chain reaction, insulin-receptor mRNA could be detected in Epstein-Barr virus-transformed lymphoblasts from both patients. Moreover, because of the existence of silent polymorphisms in the nucleotide sequences, it was possible to differentiate the two alleles of the insulin-receptor gene in both patients. In patient 2, the two alleles were expressed asymmetrically, with 90% of the mRNA molecules having been transcribed from one allele but only 10% transcribed from the second allele. This suggests that there is an unidentified mutation in the underexpressed allele that acts in a cis-dominant fashion to decrease insulin-receptor mRNA levels. However, in patient 1, both alleles were expressed symmetrically in similarly low levels. Although not proven, it seems likely that the mutations that decrease insulin-receptor mRNA levels in patient 1 also map to the insulin-receptor locus. 
Colonic ischemia complicating immunotherapy with interleukin-2 and interferon-alpha. Colonic ischemia (CI) is a rare complication of high-dose interleukin-2 (IL-2) immunotherapy. This complication occurred in three of 141 patients (2.1%) with metastatic cancer treated with high-dose IL-2 therapy; CI only developed in patients receiving interferon-alpha (IFN) with IL-2 (three of 21, 14%) compared with none of 120 in those patients receiving IL-2 alone (P equals 0.0009). Severe diarrhea (greater than or equal to 7 bowel movements/day) also was significantly more common in patients receiving IFN with IL-2 (six of 21, 29%) than in those receiving IL-2 alone (three of 120, 2.5%, P equals 0.001) and preceded the clinical diagnosis of CI in all three patients. Three of nine patients with severe diarrhea had CI. Hematochezia occurred in four patients, all of whom received IFN with IL-2; three had CI, and the other patient had nonspecific colitis. Differences in vasopressor use did not explain the increased risk of CI in patients receiving IFN; those receiving IFN with IL-2 required phenylephrine less often than patients receiving IL-2 alone (P equals 0.01). The administration of lymphokine-activated killer (LAK) cells had no significant effect on the incidence of CI, severe diarrhea, peritonitis, or vasopressor use; two of three patients with CI, however, had their ischemic episode within 24 hours after the last of three LAK cell infusions. In conclusion, CI is an unusual complication of high-dose IL-2 and IFN immunotherapy. In patients receiving such combination therapy, severe diarrhea is a risk factor for the subsequent occurrence of CI. 
Prostate-specific antigen and prostatic acid phosphatase: biomolecular and physiologic characteristics. PSA is a 34-kd 240-amino acid glycoprotein produced by the prostatic epithelial cells. It is a member of the glandular kallikrein gene family and has a high sequence homology with human glandular kallikrein (hGK-1). PSA is a serine protease and has chymotrypsin-, trypsin-, and esterase-like activities. It is secreted into the seminal fluid where it degrades two seminal vesicle proteins that are important components of the semen coagulum, thus playing an important role in semen liquefaction. The production of PSA protein appears to be under the control of circulating androgens acting through the androgen receptor. Therefore, the significance of a low serum PSA value in a patient who has undergone previous antiandrogen therapy may not be the same as that for a patient who has not received endocrine treatment. 
Fatal aortic rupture during balloon dilatation of recoarctation. In an eight year old boy with a patch aortoplasty, the aorta ruptured during balloon angioplasty for recoarctation. At necropsy a 1.5 cm long, full thickness tear and a separate, smaller, intimal tear were found. Histological examination showed thinning of the elastic laminae of the aorta. Angioplasty for recoarctation may be dangerous in patients with a patch aortoplasty. 
The danger of an ultra-early computed tomographic scan in a patient with an evolving acute epidural hematoma. A case of an acute traumatic epidural hematoma that developed after an ultra-early computed tomographic scan of the head is discussed. Serial neurological examinations in patients with head injuries are recommended. 
Principal causes of mechanical bowel obstruction in surgically treated adults in western Turkey. A retrospective study of the principal causes of mechanical bowel obstruction occurring in Western Turkey between 1979 and 1989 was undertaken. The records of 14,777 operations performed in the general surgery departments of two hospitals were reviewed. Mechanical bowel obstruction occurred in 582 patients. Among the causes of mechanical bowel obstruction, adhesions were most common (44.0 per cent), followed by strangulated hernia (23.9 per cent), volvuli (12.7 per cent) and colonic carcinomas (10.1 per cent). A previous appendicectomy appeared to be the most important cause of adhesions causing mechanical bowel obstruction. 
Total body calcium in patients with inflammatory bowel disease: a longitudinal study. 1. Serial measurements of total body calcium have been made by prompt gamma-neutron activation analysis in 13 patients with inflammatory bowel disease over a mean period of 23 months. Changes in spinal trabecular bone mineral density and radial shaft bone mineral content were also assessed by using quantitative computed tomography and single photon absorptiometry, respectively. 2. The mean annual decreases (95% confidence intervals) were: total body calcium, 7.8% (-12.0 to -3.7%; P less than 0.001); spinal trabecular bone mineral density, 2.5% (-5.0 to +0.1%; 0.05 less than P less than 0.1), radial bone mineral content, 2.1% (-3.4 to -0.8%; P less than 0.01). 3. No significant correlations were found between rates of change of the three variables. However, there were significant positive correlations between the baseline values for total body calcium and radial bone mineral content (r = 0.638, P less than 0.05), spinal bone mineral density and radial bone mineral content (r = 0.854, P less than 0.01), and total body calcium and spinal bone mineral density (r = 0.876, P less than 0.001). 4. These results demonstrate rapid decreases in total body calcium in patients with inflammatory bowel disease which, in conjunction with the significant decrease in radial shaft bone mineral content, indicate increased rates of cortical bone loss. Whilst values for bone mass at different skeletal sites showed positive correlations within individuals, no relationship was found between the rates of change in bone mass at these sites. 5. The rapid bone loss observed in some subjects emphasizes the importance of early detection of osteoporosis by bone densitometry and the need for effective prophylactic measures to be established in this group of patients. 
Treatment of meningitis and other infections due to ampicillin-resistant Haemophilus influenzae type b in children. Cefotaxime and other cephalosporins were retrospectively evaluated for the treatment of meningitis and non-central nervous system (CNS) infections due to ampicillin-resistant Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib). Between January 1985 and February 1989, 45 cases of meningitis and 27 cases of non-CNS infection due to ampicillin-resistant Hib were documented at Texas Children's Hospital in Houston. Of the 45 children with meningitis, 26 (57.8%) were treated with cefotaxime, 11 (24.4%) with chloramphenicol, and three (6.7%) with cefuroxime; five children (11.1%) were initially given chloramphenicol but later received cefotaxime instead. In addition, 14 chloramphenicol-treated patients from a previous study were included in this analysis. There were no significant differences in terms of neurologic sequelae or other complications (except diarrhea) between the cefotaxime and chloramphenicol groups. The efficacy of cefotaxime was equivalent to that of chloramphenicol for the treatment of ampicillin-resistant Hib meningitis. Cefuroxime was as safe and effective as chloramphenicol or cefotaxime for the treatment of non-CNS infections due to ampicillin-resistant Hib. 
Effect of age on use of thrombolytic therapy and mortality in acute myocardial infarction. The MITI Project Group. The findings in 3,256 consecutive patients hospitalized for acute myocardial infarction were tabulated to assess the history, treatments and outcome in the elderly; 1,848 patients (56%) were greater than 65 years of age, including 28% who were aged greater than or equal to 75 years. The incidence of prior angina, hypertension and heart failure (only 3% of patients less than 55 years of age had a history of heart failure compared with 24% greater than or equal to 75 years old) was found to increase with age. Twenty-nine percent of patients less than 75 years of age were treated with a systemic thrombolytic drug compared with only 5% of patients older than 75 years. Mortality rates increased strikingly with advanced age (less than 2% in patients less than or equal to 55, 4.6% in those 55 to 64, 12.3% in those 65 to 74 and 17.8% in those greater than or equal to 75 years). Both the incidence of complicating illness and a nondiagnostic electrocardiogram (ECG) increased with age. In a multivariate analysis of outcome in older patients (greater than or equal to 65 years), adverse events were related to both prior history of heart failure (odds ratio 3.9) and increasing age (odds ratio 1.4 per each decade of age). Outcome was not improved by treatment with thrombolytic drugs, but these agents were prescribed to only 12% of patients greater than 65 years of age, thereby reducing the power for detecting such an effect. 
Pararectus retroperitoneal radical nephrectomy. We describe a new pararectus retroperitoneal approach to the kidney, which allows easy identification and occlusion of the renal vessels before mobilization of the kidney. This approach potentially reduces morbidity, hospital stay and cost. The technique has been used in 4 cases of radical nephrectomy for tumor and in 1 for pyonephrosis. 
The effect of magnesium sulfate on the biophysical profile of normal term fetuses. Forty term pregnant women with singleton breech gestations admitted for external cephalic version underwent biophysical profile testing before any fluid infusion or medication. After magnesium sulfate had been infused for contraction prophylaxis, the maternal serum magnesium level was measured and a second biophysical profile was performed. The mean (+/- SD) serum magnesium was 5.1 +/- 1.0 mg/dL. The biophysical profile score decreased significantly, reflecting a decrease in fetal breathing activity. In patients with therapeutic maternal serum magnesium levels, loss of any component of the biophysical profile other than respiration cannot be attributed to the elevation in magnesium concentration. 
Hemicholinium-3 derivatives A-4 and A-5 alter choline metabolism in NB41A3 neuroblastoma cells. A-4, A-5 and HC-3 are experimental bis tertiary and quaternary amines which have been shown to be potent inhibitors of the sodium-dependent, high affinity choline uptake system. When incubated with neuroblastoma cells, experimental compounds A-4, A-5 and HC-3 inhibit choline metabolism. Over a 24-hr incubation, A-4, A-5 and HC-3 produced a significant decrease in total choline accumulation, choline incorporation into phospholipid and free choline content. However, despite decreases in choline incorporation into phospholipid, no change occurred in content of phosphatidylcholine. Treatment of cells with A-4, A-5 and HC-3 resulted in an increase in the incorporation of S-adenosyl-methionine into phosphatidylcholine. However, the incorporation of ethanolamine or serine into phosphatidylcholine was not increased. Phosphatidylcholine turnover was decreased in cells treated with A-4 and A-5. A-4, A-5 and HC-3 produce significant decreases in choline metabolism; however, the cells are able to maintain membrane integrity by decreasing turnover of phosphatidylcholine and increasing phosphatidylcholine synthesis through the methylation pathway. These studies suggest that the biological effects of A-4 and A-5 are independent of membrane perturbations. 
Cardiac myofibroblasts express alpha smooth muscle actin during right ventricular pressure overload in the rabbit. A number of changes occur in contractile proteins and mechanical performance of the heart within 2 weeks of right ventricular pressure overload in 8- to 12-week-old rabbits. These changes are accompanied by increases in collagen concentration and the ratio of type I to type III collagen. The purpose of the present study was to evaluate the evolution of these connective tissue changes morphologically and to characterize the interstitial cells that might be responsible. The myocardium is infiltrated by mononuclear inflammatory cells 2 days after banding, accompanied by focal myocyte necrosis. By 7 days, the inflammatory infiltrates subside and the damaged myocytes seen at 2 days are replaced by new collagen and a population of spindle-shaped cells, with ultrastructural features of myofibroblasts. A significant proportion of these cells contain alpha smooth muscle actin by immunohistochemical analysis. At 14 days, there is a large increase in stainable collagen with complex remodeling and reduplication of the collagen fiber network of the interstitium. Alpha smooth muscle actin-containing myofibroblasts persist, but their immunoreactivity appears reduced compared with day 7. The authors hypothesize that the interstitial fibroblasts that acquire smooth-muscle-like features in this model play a critical role in the heart's response to severe and sudden mechanical stress and are at least partly responsible for the changes in connective tissue that occur as a result of pressure overload in this model. 
Solitary polyclonal autonomous thyroid nodule: a rare cause of childhood hyperthyroidism. Solitary autonomous thyroid tumors are an unusual cause of hyperthyroidism, particularly in childhood. We describe the youngest individual so far reported with this condition, a 22 month child with a large hyperfunctioning thyroid nodule who became overtly hyperthyroid after iodinated contrast administration. The histology of the nodule was compatible with follicular cell hyperplasia. These tumors are often called toxic adenomas, although there is no solid evidence that they are true neoplasms. We examined the clonal composition of the child's thyroid tumor by X-chromosome inactivation analysis, taking advantage of a polymorphism in the X-chromosome gene phosphoglycerate kinase. The tumor consisted of an even mixture of cells containing activated paternal and maternal PGK alleles, indicating that the tumor was polyclonal. Furthermore, the nodule had no structural rearrangements or activating point mutations of ras oncogenes, which are found in up to 50% of solitary monoclonal follicular adenomas. Solitary hot nodules may at least in some cases be secondary to hyperplasia, and not to clonal expansion of an abnormal, mutated cell. This may also explain the relatively low frequency of malignant transformation observed in hyperfunctioning thyroid tumors. 
Alteration of the pulsatile load in the high-altitude calf model of pulmonary hypertension. We compared main pulmonary arterial elasticity and global pulmonary arterial compliance in control and high-altitude (HA) calves to determine whether 1) changes in pulmonary arterial elasticity are contributing to an increase in the oscillatory load of the right ventricle in this model of pulmonary hypertension and 2) measured changes in stiffness of the HA calves' arterial wall are the result of both an increase in pressure and an alteration of the material properties of the HA calves' arterial wall. Newborn calves were placed at 4,300 m simulated altitude for 14 days, and control calves were kept at 1,500 m. The HA calves were then reacclimatized to 1,500 m for 24 h so that baseline pressures of the two groups were similar. Open-chest main pulmonary arterial and right ventricular micromanometric pressures, ultrasonic main pulmonary arterial diameter, and green dye flow were measured under baseline conditions and then under moderate and severely hypoxic conditions to make measurements at both baseline and increased pulmonary pressures. At elevated pressures, the pressure-diameter relationship was noted to be nonlinear, and a characteristic late systolic peaking of the right ventricular pressure waveform was seen. The Peterson pressure-strain modulus, pulse wave velocity, characteristic impedance, and global compliance (3 element windkessel) were calculated. The calculated variables were all shown to be pressure dependent, and no intrinsic differences in stiffness were seen between the control and HA animals when mean pressure was taken into account. Pulmonary arterial histology demonstrated, however, a characteristic increase in wall thickness in the HA animals. Thus, in this model of pulmonary hypertension, major changes in elasticity and pulsatile load are primarily due to an increase in pulmonary pressure. The structural changes present in the HA calves' arterial wall did not separately produce any measurable changes in arterial distensibility or the oscillatory load. 
Behavioral audiometry. Behavioral audiometry is based on observation of overt responses to controlled auditory stimuli, as contrasted with electrophysiologic procedures, which involve electrophysiologic monitoring or direct recording of the bioelectric correlates of the original signal. When reinforcement is added to the behavioral procedures, the infant or young child provides highly reliable responses, and it is possible to test most infants 6 months of age and older with these procedures. The combination of both behavioral and electrophysiologic procedures can resolve most clinical questions regarding the auditory function of young infants and children. 
Oral acyclovir therapy of recurrent herpes simplex virus type 2 infection of the hand. Acyclovir was evaluated as treatment of recurrent herpes simplex virus type 2 infection of the hand in a double-blind, placebo-controlled crossover study. In nine fully evaluable patients, oral acyclovir (2 g/day in three doses for 10 days) initiated during the earliest phase of a recurrence reduced the mean durations (+/- standard deviation) of clinical symptoms from 10.1 (+/- 3.6) to 3.7 (+/- 3.0) days (P = 0.008), signs from 11.1 (+/- 3.7) to 6.2 (+/- 3.3) days (P = 0.024), and viral positivity from 5.3 (+/- 3.8) to 0.6 (+/- 1.1) days (P = 0.011). 
Patient-controlled analgesia. Does a concurrent opioid infusion improve pain management after surgery? OBJECTIVE.--To assess the influence of a continuous (basal) morphine infusion as part of a patient-controlled analgesia (PCA) system on the postoperative analgesic requirement and on recovery parameters following abdominal hysterectomy. DESIGN.--Single-center, randomized, controlled protocol. SETTING.--University medical center. PARTICIPANTS.--A total of 230 adult women were randomly assigned to receive no morphine infusion (control group) or a continuous 0.5-, 1.0-, or 2.0-mg/h morphine infusion. Each patient was able to self-administer supplemental intravenous bolus doses of morphine (1 to 2 mg) using a PCA infuser. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES.--Use of the PCA device, opioid-related side effects, recovery times, and the patients' assessment of pain and sedation on linear visual analog scales were recorded during the 72-hour study period. Follow-up questionnaires were completed by the patients and their health care professionals to assess the overall adequacy of PCA therapy. RESULTS.--Patients who received the 2-mg/h morphine infusions received significantly more opioid medication 9 to 72 hours after their operation than those who received no infusion (control group). The presence of a continuous morphine infusion of 0.5 to 2 mg/h did not significantly decrease the number of patient demands or supplemental bolus doses administered compared with the control group. Overall, 168 (84%) of the 199 patients who completed the 72-hour study were able to achieve adequate analgesia without requiring changes in the PCA regimen or experiencing major side effects. Recovery times and outcome variables were similar in all four groups. CONCLUSION.--The routine use of a continuous opioid infusion in combination with a standard PCA regimen does not improve pain management compared with PCA alone after abdominal hysterectomy. 
Leukaemia mortality among relatives of cystic fibrosis patients. A total of 219 families of patients with cystic fibrosis living in Wales were studied for the occurrence of other diseases and for cause of death, and the findings in relation to leukaemia are reported. There were eight deaths due to leukaemia, five of the myeloid type, in first and second degree relatives; this is significantly more than the expected on the basis of national age specific mortality rates. In comparison, mortality among siblings, parents, aunts and uncles, and grandparents from all causes was within the expected. Screening the five patients with myeloid leukaemia for the delta F508 mutation showed that four were carriers of this mutation. It is concluded that carriers of the delta F508 mutation may have an increased risk of developing acute myeloid leukaemia. This could happen through the direct effect of the cystic fibrosis gene itself, or through its influence on another gene, such as the met oncogene, or gene(s) involved in granulocyte function on the long arm of chromosome 7. 
Subclinical cardiac dysfunction in sarcoidosis. Clinically apparent myocardial disease is infrequent in sarcoidosis. However, autopsy data show myocardial involvement in up to 30 percent of patients. Unexplained exertional symptomatology is a common complaint in patients with sarcoidosis. In this study, we investigated whether abnormal cardiac function might limit exercise performance in patients with sarcoidosis without overt cardiac involvement. We studied exercise responses in 35 patients with sarcoidosis and compared them with 28 untrained controls. Seventy-seven percent of the patients were symptomatic. Pulmonary function test results were lower in the group with sarcoidosis than normal controls, but they were within normal range. Only one patient had evidence of ventilatory limitation to exercise. Sixteen (46 percent) patients had abnormally increased heart rates (HRs) at rest prior to exercise testing and/or with exercise. Rapid HRs were confirmed during daily activities by continuous ambulatory electrocardiographic (ECG) monitoring. Left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) was measured to determine if systolic dysfunction could account for abnormal HR responses. Of patients with abnormally increased HRs, five had LVEFs less than 50 percent, and eight had normal LVEFs, of whom 75 percent had tachycardia at rest. Retrospective comparison of HR responses and LVEF between patients who did or did not receive corticosteroids revealed no significant differences between groups. We conclude that abnormal HR responses in patients without evident cardiac sarcoidosis are common and exertional symptoms in this population are often associated with chronotropic abnormalities. The exact mechanisms underlying the chronotropic abnormalities are unclear, but they likely include ventricular systolic dysfunction, sinus node dysfunction from granulomatous infiltration, or combinations of the two. 
Effect of massive dose vitamin A on morbidity and mortality in Indian children The effect of vitamin A supplementation on preschool child morbidity and mortality was assessed in a prospective double-blind placebo-controlled study around Hyderabad, India. Every six months 200,000 IU vitamin A was given to 7691 children (treatment group) whereas 8084 children received a placebo (control group). Morbidity and mortality data were collected every three months. Risk of respiratory infection was higher in children with mild xerophthalmia than in children with normal eyes. Vitamin A supplementation had no effect on morbidity status. Mortality rates were similar in the two groups; it was highest in children who did not receive either vitamin A or placebo. The findings suggest that vitamin A supplementation alone may not reduce child mortality. 
Origin of malignant centrofacial granulomas: surface markers and gene rearrangement of malignant cells. Malignant centrofacial granuloma (MCFG) is a clinical entity characterized by a relentless ulceration of the upper airway involving the nose, palate, and face, without any demonstrable etiology. The origin of 11 cases were analyzed with the help of cell-surface immunostaining in all and with T-cell receptor gene (TCR) rearrangement in 3. The results show that most of the cases of MCFG are in fact T-cell lymphomas with cell-surface antigens (CD2, CD7, CD3) consistent with either early or mature T lymphocytes. However, some cases exhibit B-lymphoid (CD19, CD20) or histiomonocytic (CD13, CD14) lineage-specific markers. In conclusion, despite its remarkable clinical unity, MCFG is a heterogeneous group of neoplastic diseases, most but not all of which may be classified as T-cell lymphoma. 
Popliteal aneurysm with spontaneous arteriovenous fistula. This report documents a rare manifestation of aneurysmal disease of the popliteal artery. We describe a popliteal aneurysm presenting with acute venous hypertension due to a spontaneously occurring arteriovenous fistula. The fistula was defunctionalized by treating the aneurysm with a standard technique of exclusion and bypass with resolution of the symptoms of venous hypertension and maintenance of normal distal perfusion. 
Extraocular muscle surgery in myasthenia gravis. Myasthenia gravis is typically a disease of young people in active employment who need a field of binocular single vision. Although it is systemically controllable with a good chance of spontaneous remission, persistent loss of binocularity may cause chronic disability. We report our experience of extraocular muscle surgery in five patients with stable myasthenia gravis and persistent double vision. Extraocular muscle involvement was selective, giving rise to incomitant and concomitant squints, with individual muscle overactions as well as underactions. Treatment was by conventional recession and resection procedures with the additional use of Faden and adjustable sutures where appropriate. In all five cases a larger, stable field of binocular single vision was established. It is concluded that extraocular muscle surgery may be beneficial in selected cases of myasthenia gravis. 
A comparison of sucralfate with placebo in the treatment of esophageal ulcers following therapeutic endoscopic sclerotherapy of esophageal varices--a prospective controlled randomized trial. In 1984 Roark published the first report of a sucralfate treatment of esophageal ulcers after sclerotherapy. Because this was an uncontrolled trial we planned a prospective double-blind placebo-controlled study with 60 patients. After therapeutic paravariceal injection-sclerotherapy of esophageal varices, patients were randomly treated with sucralfate suspension or placebo. Time of treatment was limited to a maximum of 3 weeks and the dosage of sucralfate was 1 g q.i.d. (Ulcogant-Suspension). Healing was assessed by endoscopy at weekly intervals. Fifty-three patients (25 sucralfate, 28 placebo) were evaluable according to the protocol. No patient left the study because of side effects. At the start of the trial, the patients in the sucralfate group showed a larger ulcer area than the placebo group. There was a tendency to faster healing in the sucralfate group, especially in patients with deeper ulcerations. However, there was no significant difference in global healing between both treatment groups after 3 weeks. Sucralfate suspension may be of value in accelerating the healing process in esophageal ulcers after sclerotherapy, especially in patients with deep ulcers. These results should be confirmed in further trials, in which patients should be stratified with respect to their ulcer volume and severity of liver disease. 
Orthostatic vital signs in emergency department patients. STUDY OBJECTIVE: To examine the variability and define the normal ranges of orthostatic vital signs in an emergency department population. DESIGN: Descriptive. TYPE OF PARTICIPANTS: Adult ED patients with no history of recent blood or fluid losses. MEASUREMENTS: Lying and standing heart rate and blood pressure measured by an automated instrument. RESULTS: In 132 presumed euvolemic patients, the statistical normal ranges (mean +/- 2 SD) of orthostatic vital signs were wide: on standing, the heart rate range was from decreases 5.0 to increases 39.4 beats per minute; for systolic blood pressure, the range was decreases 20 to increases 25.7 mm Hg; and for diastolic blood pressure, the range was decreases 6.4 to increases 24.9 mm Hg. In this sample, 43% had "positive" orthostatic vital signs according to currently accepted values. CONCLUSION: The data from this study indicate that there is a wider than expected variation in orthostatic vital signs among presumed euvolemic ED patients. 
Prognosis of symptomatic duodenal adenomas in familial adenomatous polyposis. The frequent association between familial adenomatous polyposis and duodenal tumors is increasingly recognized, yet many patients do not benefit from adequate diagnosis and follow-up of upper gastrointestinal polyps. A retrospective review of 14 patients with duodenal tumors associated with familial adenomatous polyposis was undertaken to assess the impact of early diagnosis by screening asymptomatic patients. Six of eight patients presenting with symptoms suggesting duodenal disease had invasive cancer. Four of these six patients died after surviving a mean of 13 months after diagnosis. In contrast, none of the six patients diagnosed after screening with upper gastrointestinal endoscopy has had invasive carcinoma. Early diagnosis and long-term surveillance of asymptomatic patients with familial adenomatous polyposis affords the opportunity to diagnose and treat duodenal tumors at an early stage, thereby, avoiding the dismal prognosis once invasive cancer has developed. 
Triiodothyronine-enhanced left ventricular function after ischemic injury. Hypothyroidism is associated with profound left ventricular dysfunction. Brain-dead organ donors and patients undergoing cardiopulmonary bypass are chemically hypothyroid with significantly reduced circulating free triiodothyronine (T3). To test the hypothesis that T3 enhances left ventricular function in a hormonally deficient environment, a total of 36 healthy New Zealand White rabbit hearts were studied using a modified Langendorff preparation with Krebs-Henseleit perfusate and intra-ventricular balloon. In 9 normal rabbit hearts a cumulative dose-response curve with logarithmically increasing doses of T3 was obtained. The vehicle solution for T3 dissolution served as control (n = 9). Left ventricular function was assessed from peak developed pressure at baseline and after T3 administration. Triiodothyronine had no effect in normal hearts on peak developed pressure or end-diastolic pressure. In 18 rabbits, the acute effect of T3 administration after ischemia was investigated. Preischemic left ventricular function was measured to serve as baseline, and hearts were subjected to 37 degrees C global ischemia. Triiodothyronine (n = 9) or vehicle (n = 9) was infused during reperfusion, and left ventricular peak developed pressure was measured at 30 and 60 minutes of reperfusion. Recovery of function (expressed as percent return of left ventricular peak developed pressure) was significantly improved within 15 minutes of reperfusion (65.0% +/- 2.1% versus 80.2% +/- 4.1%) and remained significantly improved throughout the reperfusion period (p less than 0.05 by analysis of variance). These data suggest that although T3 possesses no inotropic properties, it significantly improves postischemic left ventricular function. The rapidity of the functional improvement suggests that these effects may be due to plasma membrane-mediated mechanisms. 
Brain protection during circulatory arrest. Previous nuclear magnetic resonance studies in this laboratory have shown a beneficial biochemical effect of antegrade cerebroplegia (CP-A) during hypothermic circulatory arrest. This study compared CP-A with other methods of cerebral protection during hypothermic circulatory arrest to assess the clinical utility of this technique. Twenty-three sheep were divided into four groups: systemic hypothermia alone (SYST) and systemic hypothermia combined with external cranial cooling (EXTNL), retrograde cerebroplegia (CP-R), or CP-A. Cardiopulmonary bypass was started, and the sheep were cooled to 15 degrees C and subjected to 2 hours of circulatory arrest. Cardiopulmonary bypass was restarted, and the animals were rewarmed and weaned from cardiopulmonary bypass. Serial neurological examinations were performed and hourly scores assigned until the animals were extubated. Postanesthetic neurological scores improved in all groups throughout the 6-hour recovery period except the CP-R group. The improvement over time for these scores was similar for the EXTNL and CP-A groups and significantly better than for the SYST or CP-R groups (p = 0.004). The CP-A group had 5 of 7 animals with deficit-free survival despite the similarity in recovery of baseline brainstem function. We conclude that both antegrade infusion of cerebroplegia and external cranial cooling confer distinct cerebroprotective effects after a protracted period of hypothermic circulatory arrest when compared with the other methods studied. 
Diagnosis of cerebral amyloid angiopathy by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay of cystatin C in cerebrospinal fluid. An abnormally low level of cystatin C in the cerebrospinal fluid is a diagnostic marker for the hereditary form of brain hemorrhage associated with amyloidosis that was first identified in Iceland. We developed an assay for cystatin C to use in the diagnosis of patients with cerebral amyloid angiopathy and brain hemorrhage. This test consists of a sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay using monoclonal mouse anticystatin C and polyclonal rabbit anticystatin C antibodies. The cystatin C level was assayed in cerebrospinal fluid samples from 29 patients with brain hemorrhage and 45 control patients with other neurological diseases. Fifteen patients with brain hemorrhage showed low cystatin C levels (less than or equal to 70 ng/ml) in a clinical setting in which the positive and negative findings were compatible with a diagnosis of cerebral amyloid angiopathy. Immunohistological examination of brain tissue obtained by biopsy from two of the 15 patients confirmed the diagnosis of cerebral amyloid angiopathy and identified the deposition of cystatin C and beta-protein. This enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay is simple to perform and may be useful for investigating patients suspected of having cerebral amyloid angiopathy with brain hemorrhage and the deposition of cystatin C. 
Pain on intradermal injection with lignocaine. The effect of concentration. Twenty ASA 1 volunteers were each injected intradermally with four solutions containing 0.2 ml of 0.5%, 1%, and 2% lignocaine and 0.9% saline to determine whether the pain experienced on injection was related to the concentration of local anaesthetic. A 10 cm linear analogue pain scoring system was used, and the solutions were ranked from most painful to least painful. There were no differences between the different concentrations of lignocaine and 0.9% saline in the severity of pain experienced. We conclude that any concentration of lignocaine may be used intradermally before inserting intravenous catheters without affecting the degree of pain experienced by that injection. 
Dissociation of second messenger activation by parathyroid hormone fragments in osteosarcoma cells. PTH activates multiple second messengers in its target cells, but the level at which the hormonal signal splits into different pathways is still unknown. To achieve insights on this issue, we have studied the structure-function relationship of PTH by analyzing the effects of bovine PTH-(1-34) [bPTH-(1-34)] and PTH fragments truncated at the N-terminus on the intracellular calcium concentration [( Ca2+]i) and cAMP production in the rat osteogenic sarcoma cell line UMR 106-01. [Ca2+]i was measured in single cells using fura-2. When exposed to 10(-7) M bPTH-(1-34), 20% of the cells responded with a transient increase in [Ca2+]i of variable amplitude. Equimolar doses of bPTH-(2-34), propionyl bPTH-(2-34) [(pbPTH-(2-34)], and bPTH-(3-34) also transiently increased [Ca2+]i, whereas both [tyrosine34]bPTH-(7-34) amide [bPTH-(7-34)] and bPTH-(30-34) were ineffective. The amplitude of the [Ca2+] i transients was dose-dependent, with threshold concentrations of 10(-10) M for bPTH-(1-34) and bPTH-(2-34), and 10(-9) M for bPTH-(3-34). The response rate to the active peptides ranged between 10-30%, without a clear dose-relatedness. A second addition of 10(-7) M bPTH-(1-34) to cells prestimulated with equimolar doses of bPTH-(2-34), pbPTH-(2-34), or bPTH-(3-34) produced another transient, whereas after exposure to 10(-7) M bPTH-(1-34), the cells were completely desensitized to a second homologous stimulation, suggesting that the binding affinity of the truncated peptides for the PTH receptor is lower than that of the intact bPTH-(1-34) fragment. In addition, both bPTH-(1-34) and bPTH-(2-34) dose-dependently stimulated cAMP production, but the former was more potent (ED50 = 10(-9) vs. 10(-7) M, respectively). On the contrary, pbPTH-(2-34), bPTH-(3-34), and bPTH-(7-34) had no effect on cAMP. Pretreating the cells with pertussis toxin to enhance cAMP responses via inhibition of Gi potentiated the effect of bPTH-(1-34) and bPTH-(2-34) and disclosed weak but detectable agonist action of pbPTH-(2-34). These results indicate that specific domains of the PTH molecule are linked to activation of different second messenger pathways; while the first two amino acids are indispensable for activating the cAMP system, generation of the [Ca2+]i signal appears to involve a longer domain, including the amino acid residue in position 3. 
Molecular evaluation of response to all-trans-retinoic acid therapy in patients with acute promyelocytic leukemia. The advent of retinoic acid (RA) in the treatment of acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) has led to a high frequency of short-lasting complete remissions (CR). We studied the response to RA by molecularly analyzing the RA receptor alpha (RAR alpha) locus, which has recently been shown to be rearranged in all APLs. Southern blot analysis demonstrated that the RAR alpha rearrangements persisted in the APL samples containing maturing myeloid cells 2 to 3 weeks after the start of RA treatment, but disappeared after 5 to 8 weeks, when the patients achieved CR. Our investigations provide clear evidence that CR occurs at molecular level and that there is reconstitution of an apparently normal, nonclonal hematopoiesis. Further, it shows that RA acts by triggering differentiation rather than by exerting a cytotoxic effect on the leukemic clone. 
The role of intraluminal radiotherapy and concurrent 5-fluorouracil infusion in the management of carcinoma esophagus: a pilot study. Fifty patients with carcinoma of the esophagus were entered in a randomized pilot study to test the efficacy of intraluminal radiotherapy (ILRT) and concurrent 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) infusion. The median age was 65 years, with 80% having middle third lesions; in 62%, the lesions were longer than 5 cm. After external beam therapy of 50 Gy in 5 weeks, patients were randomized to receive chemotherapy. Significant improvement in dysphagia was recorded in 76% patients with complete response in 47 cases ranging from 6 to 27 months. The overall survival at 2 years was 15% with ILRT alone versus 22% with ILRT plus 5-FU infusion. 
From tissue angiotensin converting enzyme inhibition to antihypertensive effect. The renin-angiotensin system (RAS) has long been regarded as a classical hormonal system, with angiotensin II (ANG II) being the circulating effector peptide. In recent years, evidence for additional RAS in various organs, including vascular wall, kidney, adrenal gland, heart, and brain, has been obtained. Drugs interfering with the RAS such as the converting enzyme (CE) inhibitors may, therefore, not only inhibit the plasma RAS but also inhibit these tissue RAS. Such a "tissue" RAS inhibition has been repeatedly demonstrated in animal experiments, and in some cases it correlated better with the cardiovascular actions of the CE inhibitors than did inhibition of plasma RAS. In the vascular wall, a local inhibition of ANG II synthesis may contribute not only to the reduction of vascular tone but also to the marked regression of media hypertrophy seen after CE inhibitor treatment. Vascular ANG II generation by CE appears to occur almost exclusively at the luminal surface of the endothelium. Locally formed ANG II may then contribute to the pool of circulating ANG II (endocrine ANG II) or feed back to adjacent cells without being transported by the blood (paracrine ANG II). Thus, CE inhibitors may not have to penetrate into deeper layers of the vascular wall to inhibit the vascular RAS, but may rather prevent the paracrine actions of locally generated ANG II. 
Effect of clean intermittent catheterisation on radiological appearance of the upper urinary tract in children with myelomeningocele. Of the 102 consecutive children with myelomeningocele who were treated by intermittent catheterisation between 1977 and 1985, 89 were investigated with regard to the development of the upper urinary tract. The median follow-up period was 6.7 years. Dilatation and vesicoureteric reflux were assessed by means of repeated urography and voiding cystourethrography. Of the 49 children with normal radiology at the start of catheterisation, all but 2 remained normal. In 27 with isolated dilatation of the upper urinary tract or reflux at the start, 17 subsequently became normal. Dilatation together with reflux was seen in 13 patients at the start; 3 became normal, 4 still had reflux and in 6 patients both dilatation and reflux persisted. Intermittent catheterisation thus had a positive effect on the upper urinary tract in the vast majority of cases. In children with both dilatation and reflux, however, there is a risk of deterioration and they should be followed up closely. 
Helicobacter pylori-negative duodenal ulcer. Most patients with chronic duodenal ulcer (DU) craters have gastritis associated with Helicobacter pylori (HP), now thought to be the major cause of DU. A smaller proportion of DU patients have no detectable HP. In this study, we examined the frequency and causes of HP-negative duodenal ulcers. In 302 consecutive patients with endoscopic diagnosis of duodenal ulcer, 284 (94%) were found to have associated HP gastritis, whereas 18 (6%) were HP-negative on histology, culture, and urease test. The largest subgroup of HP-negative patients (8/18) was made up of those who had been taking nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), followed closely (4/18) by patients with recent intake of antibiotics. Causes of DU in the remaining subgroups included two patients with duodenal Crohn's disease, two with Gastrospirillum hominis infection, one with penetrating carcinoma of the pancreas and one with no detectable cause. We conclude that, although the most common causal factor of duodenal ulcer is HP, some 6% of DU's will be HP-negative, signaling unusual etiology. It is now important to identify the cause of duodenal ulcer so as to initiate appropriate therapy. 
Epitope map of neurofilament protein domains in cortical and peripheral nervous system Lewy bodies. A subset of demented elderly patients exhibit large numbers of cortical intraneuronal inclusions similar to the neurofilament (NF)-rich Lewy bodies (LB) found in pigmented subcortical neurons of patients with Parkinson's disease (PD). Because these cortical inclusions may contribute to the emergence of cognitive impairments in afflicted individuals, the authors mapped the distribution of NF epitopes in these so-called cortical LBs. This was done using ethanol-fixed tissues and a large library of monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) with well-characterized binding specificities to various regions of each NF triplet protein. Cortical LBs were examined by light, confocal, and electron microscopy, and they were compared with the subcortical LBs of PD and LBs in the peripheral nervous system (PNS). Monoclonal antibodies specific for the rod regions of each of the three NF subunits, or for phosphate-dependent and independent antigenic sites in the tail region of the high- (NF-H) and middle- (NF-M) molecular weight (Mr) NF subunits as well as other MAbs to the extreme COOH terminus of NF-L and NF-M or the head region of NF-M labeled a variable number of cortical LBs. Remarkably one of these anti-NF MAbs, RMO32, which recognized a phosphorylated epitope in the tail region of NF-M, immunolabeled nearly all cortical LBs, whereas each of the other anti-NF MAbs never labeled more than 10% of ubiquitin- or RMO32-positive cortical LBs. Further LBs in the PNS resembled those in the central nervous system (CNS) in their immunologic properties, and LBs in both sites were dominated by filamentous aggregates at the ultrastructural level. These findings suggest that NF proteins are profoundly altered during their incorporation into cortical and PNS LBs. Further the authors here identified immunologic and ultrastructural properties common to cortical LBs, PNS LBs, and classic substantia nigra LBs in PD. The accumulation of filamentous, perikaryal inclusions rich in NF proteins at diverse sites in the CNS and PNS of patients with a variety of neurodegenerative disorders suggests a widespread disruption of NF metabolism or transport. 
Neurosarcoidosis--demonstration of meningeal disease by gadolinium enhanced magnetic resonance imaging. Arriving at a firm diagnosis of neurosarcoidosis continues to pose serious problems, particularly when evidence of granulomatous disease outside the nervous system is lacking. The commonest mode of presentation of neurosarcoidosis is with cranial nerve palsies. Two cases of presumed neurosarcoidosis with cranial nerve palsies showed clear evidence of focal meningeal disease on gadolinium-DTPA enhanced MRI brain scans. Although not specific for sarcoidosis, this technique may be very useful in aiding the diagnosis in suspected cases. 
Interrelationship between histopathologic characteristics of melanoma and estrogen receptor status. To evaluate whether the increase in disease-free survival and survival previously reported for women with melanomas with estrogen receptors (ER) was a reflection of the histopathology of the primary melanoma, the interrelationship of histopathologic characteristics of 143 patients with such tumors was examined. The ER was assayed in the primary tumor from 44 patients and in 99 metastatic deposits from the other patients. Tumor thickness, level of invasion, prognostic index, mitoses/mm2, ulceration, vascular invasion, necrosis, histologic grade, preexisting nevus, and predominant malignant cell type were examined. There was no relationship between ER presence and any histopathologic characteristic examined, irrespective of the tumor source (primary or metastatic). Examination of histopathologic characteristics as a function of sex and receptor status showed a slight but insignificant predominance of more well-differentiated, thinner tumors in women whose lesions were positive for the ER. These results suggest that the increased disease-free survival in patients with ER-positive lesions is not attributable to the pathologic characteristics of the primary tumor examined during this study. 
Benign positional vertigo: incidence and prognosis in a population-based study in Olmsted County, Minnesota. A retrospective review of our population-based medical records linkage system for residents of Olmsted County, Minnesota, revealed 53 patients (34 women and 19 men; mean age, 51 years) with newly diagnosed benign positional vertigo in 1984. The age- and sex-adjusted incidence was 64 per 100,000 population per year (95% confidence interval, 46 to 81 per 100,000). The incidence of benign positional vertigo increased by 38% with each decade of life (95% confidence interval, 23 to 54%). One patient had an initial stroke during follow-up; thus, the relative risk for new stroke associated with benign positional vertigo was 1.62 (95% confidence interval, 0.04 to 8.98) in comparison with the expected occurrence based on incidence rates for an age- and sex-adjusted control population. The observed survival among the 53 Olmsted County residents with benign positional vertigo diagnosed in 1984 was not significantly different from that of an age- and sex-matched general population. Patients with benign positional vertigo seem to have a good prognosis. 
Update: drug therapy for acute myocardial infarction. Acute myocardial infarction is potentially a highly treatable disease. Immediate interventions are directed to decreasing tissue hypoxia with oxygen and improving bloodflow to ischemic myocardium using nitrates and thrombolytic agents. Cardiac workload should be reduced by eliminating endogenous catecholamine release with analgesia and sedation, and beta blockade in patients without CHF to decrease heart rate and myocardial oxygen demand. Treatment of the complications of AMI include dysrhythmia prophylaxis, monitoring and specific therapy. Treatment of pump failure includes using vasodilators, vasopressors and positive inotropic agents. Early recognition and timely initiation of appropriate therapy should be every physician's goal. 
Optic nerve sheath decompression for nonarteritic ischemic optic neuropathy improves multiple visual function measurements. Optic nerve sheath decompression was performed in seven patients with nonarteritic anterior ischemic optic neuropathy. Visual function was evaluated by measurement of visual acuity with standardized Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study charts, color vision testing, quantitation of relative afferent pupillary defects with neutral-density filters, and Goldmann and Humphrey perimetry. Visual acuity improved markedly in all patients (at least doubling of the visual angle); the peripheral visual field expanded by at least 20 degrees (as measured by Goldmann perimetry) in six patients. Three patients also experienced marked improvement in color vision, relative afferent pupillary defect, and foveal sensitivity. Our experience supports the possible beneficial effect of optic nerve sheath decompression in patients with nonarteritic anterior ischemic optic neuropathy. 
On the mechanisms of ventricular tachycardia acceleration during programmed electrical stimulation. BACKGROUND. The pathophysiological mechanisms leading to acceleration of ventricular tachycardia (VT) are still unclear. METHODS AND RESULTS. High-resolution epicardial mapping was used to study the mechanisms of VT acceleration by programmed electrical stimulation (PES) in a model of sustained reentrant VT in Langendorff-perfused rabbit hearts (n = 40). Three different mechanisms responsible for acceleration of VT were identified: 1) induction of double-wave reentry (n = 6), defined as the occurrence of two successive activation waves circulating in the same direction in the same circuit; 2) change to a functionally determined circuit (n = 4), defined as reentry of the impulse around a functional line of block without involvement of a fixed obstacle; and 3) change of the reentrant circuit to reentry within a different, faster anatomic pathway (n = 3). Analysis of 81 episodes of sustained monomorphic VT induced by PES in 74 patients with clinically documented sustained VT in the setting of chronic coronary artery disease showed that in 22 episodes VT was suddenly accelerated by PES (mean cycle length, from 345 +/- 73 to 277 +/- 71 msec, p less than 0.01). CONCLUSIONS. With the observations made in the experimental model, the following tentative classification of the mechanisms of VT acceleration of the 22 episodes was made: 1) induction of double-wave reentry in two, 2) change to a functionally determined circuit in four, and 3) change to reentry within a faster anatomic circuit in 16. Simple criteria suggest that these mechanisms may apply in the clinical situation. 
Oxygen transport measurements to evaluate tissue perfusion and titrate therapy: dobutamine and dopamine effects. BACKGROUND: Increased cardiac index, oxygen delivery (DO2), and oxygen consumption (VO2) patterns were shown to characterize the physiologic status of surviving high-risk surgical patients, and indicate increased metabolic needs; relatively normal DO2 and VO2 values were found to characterize the sequential pattern of nonsurvivors who developed an early oxygen debt followed by lethal organ failure. The cardiac index, DO2, and VO2 values empirically determined from survivors' patterns were shown to improve outcome in prospective randomized trials. The present study considers these criteria to evaluate the tissue perfusion status as well as the effects of therapy on tissue perfusion and oxygenation. OBJECTIVE: To summarize new information on the temporal patterns of DO2, VO2, and oxygen debt on outcome and the effects of fluids and inotropes on these patterns in a wide range of clinical, temporal, and physiologic conditions. DESIGN: Descriptive analysis based on data gathered prospectively using a specified protocol. PATIENTS: High-risk patients with accidental or elective surgical trauma, and patients with or without sepsis or septic shock and organ failure. SETTING: University-run county hospital with a large trauma service. INTERVENTIONS: Fluids, dobutamine, and dopamine at various times and at various doses throughout critical illness of postoperative, posttraumatic, septic, and hypovolemic patients with and without lethal and nonlethal organ failure. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: The pattern of DO2 plotted against the corresponding VO2 values in 437 consecutive critically ill surgical patients showed a wide variability and poor correlation probably because complex clinical conditions may obscure the supply-dependent and supply-independent VO2 relationships observed in normal dogs bled or given bacterial infusions. However, the use of specific therapy by well-defined protocols was shown to provide objective evidence of efficacy. Significant increases in DO2 and VO2 were previously shown after whole blood, packed red cells, and colloid administration, but not after crystalloid administration. Dobutamine administration in 715 circumstances in postoperative, traumatic, septic patients and patients with adult respiratory distress syndrome, renal failure, and multiple organ failure significantly improved DO2 and VO2. Dopamine under comparable conditions produced less improvement in DO2 and VO2 than that of dobutamine; most of the VO2 changes were not significant. CONCLUSIONS: The monitored patterns of cardiac index, DO2, and VO2 may be used to evaluate the adequacy of tissue perfusion as well as the relative effectiveness of alternative therapies. Second, these physiologic criteria may be used to titrate therapy in order to achieve optimal outcome. Third, after colloids optimally expand the plasma volume, dobutamine may be used to enhance flow and the distribution of flow in order to improve tissue oxygenation. Vasodilators may be used when hypertensive episodes occur or there is an inadequate response to inotropic agents. Vasopressors are used as a last resort, usually in the terminal or preterminal state. 
New method for dealing with late-presenting spontaneous esophageal ruptures. A new technique is described for dealing with late-presenting spontaneous esophageal ruptures. This method requires only a short period of general anesthesia to drain the periesophageal abscess by a drainage tube inserted into the abscess cavity from the esophagus with the aid of a gastroscope and fluoroscopy. Gastric fluids are diverted from the esophageal rupture with a gastrostomy, and a jejunostomy is used for enteral feeding. The esophagus is retained, and closure of the fistula with resumption of normal swallowing is documented with serial sinograms. 
Nutrition: its relationship to orthopedic infections. The malnutrition of orthopedic surgical patients plays an important role in the development of complications, including infection. A high index of suspicion that malnutrition exists or will soon exist in patients who are subjected to significant stress, trauma, or surgery will lead the clinician to take measures to avoid further protein calorie deficits and replenish the patient's nutritional needs. There are many pathways in which malnutrition causes a propensity for infection, and these have been discussed. Meeting the patient's nutritional needs should avoid some of the complications of infections in orthopedic surgery. 
Tissue oxygenation in hemorrhagic shock measured as transcutaneous oxygen tension, subcutaneous oxygen tension, and gastrointestinal intramucosal pH in pigs BACKGROUND AND METHODS: Tissue oxygenation, measured in peripheral tissue as transcutaneous PO2 (PtCO2) and subcutaneous PO2, was compared with the oxygenation in GI mucosa, which was measured as intramucosal wall pH (pHi), during experimental hemorrhagic shock and resuscitation in pigs. The pigs were hemorrhaged stepwise to a BP of 80 and 45 mm Hg, followed by retransfusion. PtCO2 was measured in the groin and subcutaneous PO2 was measured in the hip region. Intraluminal PCO2 was measured in the stomach, in the small intestine, and the sigmoid colon using silicone catheters. A simultaneous determination of arterial blood HCO3 concentration allowed pHi to be calculated using Henderson-Hasselbalch equation. Cardiac output was determined by thermodilution, and oxygen delivery (DO2) was calculated. RESULTS: Early indications of shock were decreases in PtCO2 and intestinal pHi (p less than .01). All measured variables decreased at the second step of bleeding. PtCO2 and subcutaneous PO2 was correlated to DO2 through the entire experiment (r2 = .25 and .49, respectively). Also, the pHi of the small intestine and the sigmoid colon correlated with DO2 (r2 = .36 and .25, respectively). PtCO2 and subcutaneous PO2 correlated with pHi in the small intestine and sigmoid colon. CONCLUSIONS: PtCO2 and pHi in the small intestine and sigmoid colon were the variables that most rapidly indicated blood volume loss. Subcutaneous PO2 and PtCO2, and small intestine and sigmoid colon pHi were correlated to total body oxygen transport. Peripheral tissue perfusion followed intestinal perfusion to some extent. 
Mechanical cardiac valvular prostheses. Mechanical cardiac valvular prostheses currently enjoy a 60% to 40% market-share advantage over tissue prostheses in the United States and worldwide. Only the Starr-Edwards caged Silastic (Dow Corning) ball, Medtronic-Hall, St. Jude Medical, and Omniscience valves remain available in the United States. Although each valve has certain advantages and disadvantages, no design has achieved functional mechanical perfection. Late follow-up of valve-related complications from the literature favors the St. Jude Medical and Medtronic-Hall valves. 
Sudden death due to disease flare with luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone agonist therapy for carcinoma of the prostate. Luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone agonist therapy for prostate cancer is a new method of management for metastatic disease. During the initial 1 to 2-week period of administration an increase in serum testosterone concentration can lead to an exacerbation of clinical symptoms (flare phenomenon). Two patients are summarized who received luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone agonist therapy without flare blockade and died suddenly during month 1 of therapy. A review of 765 patients in 9 series found 10.9% who suffered disease flare and 15 who died during disease flare. Of these 17 patients 12 were similar to our 2. These data suggest that any patient placed on luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone agonist therapy for prostate cancer merits some form of flare blockade during the initial 1 or 2 months of therapy. 
A nurse-managed special care unit. The authors describe the first year of operation of a nurse-managed intensive care unit (ICU). Concerned with the problems, costs, and inadequacies of caring for long-term patients in traditional ICUs, nurse administrators designed a special care unit that incorporates a physical design facilitating family involvement and rehabilitative care, registered nurse case management, and a shared governance management philosophy. Compared with traditional ICUs, the effectiveness of the special care unit is tested in terms of patient and nurse outcomes. Implications of this innovation for health-care delivery systems and the nursing profession are discussed. 
Resting energy expenditure in chronic cardiac failure. 1. Resting energy expenditure has previously been shown to be elevated in the acute phase of heart failure, but the situation in the compensated state of chronic cardiac failure is unclear. Resting energy expenditure was assessed in 14 patients with stable chronic cardiac failure and 14 matched control subjects by using indirect calorimetry. 2. Resting energy expenditure was significantly elevated in the patients with chronic cardiac failure (112.6 +/- 18.1 versus 87.1 +/- 12.2 kJ day-1 kg-1 total body weight, P less than 0.0002; mean +/- SD) as were resting O2 consumption (3.88 +/- 0.64 versus 3.00 +/- 0.43 ml min-1 kg-1, P less than 0.0002), ventilation (164 +/- 40.3 versus 104 +/- 16.2 ml min-1 kg-1, P less than 0.0001) and heart rate (85.8 +/- 16.9 versus 66.6 +/- 6.9 beats/min, P less than 0.001). Both the resting plasma concentration of noradrenaline (4.48 +/- 1.52 versus 2.28 +/- 0.96 nmol/l, P less than 0.0001) and the serum concentration of free fatty acids (0.78 +/- 0.21 versus 0.57 +/- 0.27 mmol/l, P less than 0.03) were greater in the patients with chronic cardiac failure. Analysis of covariance indicated that most of the difference in resting energy expenditure could be accounted for by the elevated ventilation in the patients with chronic cardiac failure. Arm muscle area, an index of wasting, was lower in the patients with chronic cardiac failure (39.1 +/- 13.1 versus 50.5 +/- 9.4 cm2, P less than 0.02) and resting energy expenditure was found to account for some of this difference. 3. We conclude that an elevated basal metabolism occurs in chronic cardiac failure. 
Complication of a penile prosthesis reservoir: venous compression masquerading as a deep venous thrombosis. We report a case of vascular compromise secondary to the reservoir of an inflatable penile prosthesis. The problem masqueraded as deep venous thrombosis in the lower extremity of a patient 3 years after a spinal cord injury. 
Microangiopathy of the brain, retina, and ear: improvement without immunosuppressive therapy. We describe a pregnant young woman with branch retinal arteriolar occlusions, encephalopathy, and hearing loss in whom we demonstrated a patent foramen ovale. She improved while receiving anticoagulants and no immunosuppressive therapy. The microangiopathic syndrome of retinopathy, encephalopathy, and deafness may be due to a disturbance of coagulation and/or microembolism. 
Choledocholithiasis in acute gallstone pancreatitis. Incidence and clinical significance. A prospective study of choledocholithiasis was performed using 110 patients with presumptive diagnoses of acute gallstone pancreatitis. The incidence of migrating and persistent bile duct stones was determined using stool screening and intraoperative cholangiography, and the clinical significance of continued stone obstruction of the papilla was investigated using ultrasound assessment of migration time and a second evaluation of prognostic signs. Pancreatic inflammation was confirmed at surgery in 51 patients, of whom only 27 had stones in the stools (n = 22) or the bile duct (n = 5), suggesting that choledocholithiasis may not be the sole triggering factor of acute gallstone pancreatitis. Neither delayed migration nor persistent stone obstruction of the papilla promoted pancreatic inflammation. 
A temperature-dependent rabbit model for production of dermal lesions by Haemophilus ducreyi. The fact that optimal in vitro growth of Haemophilus ducreyi occurs at 33 degrees C prompted evaluation of the effect of temperature on the ability of this organism to produce skin lesions in rabbits after intradermal inoculation. Animals housed at a reduced ambient temperature (15-17 degrees C) consistently developed necrotic lesions when injected intradermally with 10(5) cfu of H. ducreyi; this inoculum did not produce necrotic lesions in animals housed at normal room temperature (23-25 degrees C). Lesion production in this new model was dependent on both viability of the H. ducreyi inoculum and replication of these organisms after intradermal injection. Histopathologic examination of the lesions revealed that H. ducreyi infection of the rabbit dermis evolves from an acute inflammatory reaction to abscess formation. Evaluation of three additional strains of H. ducreyi in this model confirmed that lesion formation was not bacterial strain-dependent. This new temperature-dependent rabbit model for productive H. ducreyi infection will facilitate investigation of the molecular pathogenesis of chancroid. 
Cutaneous type of adult T cell leukemia/lymphoma in a French West Indian woman. Clonal rearrangement of T-cell receptor beta and gamma genes and monoclonal integration of HTLV-I proviral DNA in the skin infiltrate. A 45-year-old woman, a native of the French West Indies who had lived in France since 1973, developed multiple cutaneous plaques and nodules in 1987. Histopathologic studies revealed dermal infiltration with mature activated T cells (CD4+, CD25+, DR+) with nuclear convolutions and epidermatotropisim. High titers of specific human T lymphotropic virus (HTLV)-I antibodies were detected in the serum. Molecular analysis of DNA extracted from the skin tumor biopsy specimen showed a clonal integration of an HTLV-I provirus and a T-cell clonal population as demonstrated by T-cell receptor beta and gamma gene rearrangement studies. Neither HTLV-I provirus nor T-cell receptor rearrangements were detected in peripheral blood mononuclear cells DNA despite the presence of rare adult T cell leukemia cells (less than 1%) and a small excess of DR-expressing cells, and detection of HTLV-I Pol and Px sequences by in vitro gene amplification. In this case only gene analysis of the skin lesions made possible an early diagnosis of a cutaneous adult T cell leukemia. This illustrates the need for such molecular studies to differentiate, in HTLV-I seropositive patients from endemic areas, a HTLV-I-induced T cell lymphoma from HTLV-I-nonrelated cutaneous T cell lymphomas. 
Luteinizing hormone (LH) secretory burst duration is independent from LH, prolactin, or gonadal steroid plasma levels in amenorrheic women. The possible presence of LH pulsatile secretion has been studied in patients with hypothalamic amenorrhea [LH plasma levels, less than 3 (n = 35) or greater than 3 IU/L (n = 18)], amenorrhea associated with hyperandrogenemia (n = 31), or hyperprolactinemia (n = 10). Patients were sampled every 10 min for 4 h, and LH plasma concentrations were determined by the use of an immunofluorimetric assay. The program Detect was used for both pulse detection and data deconvolution, i.e. for instantaneous secretory rate computation, on LH time series. The presence of episodic LH secretion was observed in all patients, and LH pulse frequency ranged between 3.5 +/- 0.3 and 3.8 +/- 0.2 peaks/4 h among the four groups. LH pulse amplitude was significantly reduced in patients affected by hypothalamic amenorrhea with LH plasma levels lower than 3 IU/L (0.7 +/- 0.1 IU/L; P less than 0.01) and significantly increased in patients with hyperandrogenic amenorrhea (6.8 +/- 0.3 IU/L; P less than 0.01) compared to levels in the other groups under study. Instantaneous secretory rate computation permitted the optimal resolution of the secretory events and demonstrated that the duration of gonadotrope secretory bursts ranged from 22.8 +/- 1.4 to 26.8 +/- 2.3 min in amenorrheic patients and did not depend on LH, PRL, or sex steroid plasma levels. In conclusion, the present study shows the presence of significant LH pulsatile release in amenorrheic patients, suggesting that in amenorrheic, as in normally cycling, women the secretory bursts from the gonadotropes have the same duration, despite the plasma LH, PRL, or steroid hormone levels. 
Carcinoid tumor of the common bile duct: evidence for its origin in metaplastic endocrine cells. Carcinoid tumors of the extrahepatic bile ducts are extremely rare neoplasms. The authors report the case of a 36-yr-old male patient with a carcinoid tumor that arose in the common hepatic bile duct. The non-neoplastic mucosa showed areas of gastric and intestinal metaplasia that included scattered argyrophil endocrine cells. Since the normal mucosa of the bile ducts lacks the latter type of cells, this case provides evidence for the first time that carcinoid tumors of this anatomic site probably originate from metaplastic endocrine cells. 
Occult pontine glioma in a patient with hemifacial spasm. Hemifacial spasm due to an intracranial mass lesion is rare. We describe a 29-year-old man with hemifacial spasm successfully treated with botulinum A toxin injections for 2 years. The development of acquired diplopia secondary to acquired sixth cranial nerve palsy prompted investigation. Computed tomography done at the time of original diagnosis and on three other occasions (concentrating on the brain stem and cerebellopontine angle) failed to demonstrate an intracranial mass lesion. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed a large mass lesion in the pons presumed to be a glioma. Patients with hemifacial spasm who have atypical features, especially those with associated neurologic findings, should be screened for tumours. Our case illustrates the superiority of MRI in demonstrating pontine gliomas causing hemifacial spasm. 
Hyperinsulinaemia in thyrotoxic hypokalaemic periodic paralysis. To test the hypothesis that there is an abnormal serum insulin response to a carbohydrate load in thyrotoxic hypokalaemic periodic paralysis (THPP), 18 men with THPP and 15 with uncomplicated thyrotoxicosis were studied during an oral glucose tolerance test. The THPP group had significantly higher fasting insulin concentrations (27.6 [3.6] vs 13.4 [1.8] mU/l; p less than 0.005) and a higher overall insulin response to oral glucose (p less than 0.001 by ANOVA) than the thyrotoxicosis group. There were no significant differences in fasting or stimulated glucose. Hyperinsulinaemia may be an important factor in the precipitation of acute paralysis in THPP. 
Blunt trauma-induced pacemaker failure. A 54-year-old man with an artificial pacemaker sustained blunt trauma to his chest when he was struck with a baseball bat. Within 15 minutes after the injury, the patient experienced cardiovascular collapse. His pacemaker failed, and he required insertion of a temporary transvenous pacemaker. At surgery, the defect was traced to failure of the pulse generator, a rare cause of pacemaker failure. Emergency department evaluation should include prompt and continuous ECG monitoring, an overpenetrated chest radiograph, and telemetry evaluation after discharge. 
MR imaging in fibromatosis: results in 26 patients with pathologic correlation. Fibromatoses are a diverse group of soft-tissue lesions that have been inconsistently categorized and treated. The purpose of our study was to establish the range of appearances of fibromatoses on MR images and perform a pathologic correlation to explain the variable signal-intensity patterns. During a 3-year period, 26 patients with deep fibromatoses were examined with MR. The MR images were evaluated for signal-intensity characteristics, and findings were correlated retrospectively with the pathologic diagnoses. The results showed that the MR appearance of fibromatoses is similar to that of other soft-tissue lesions, and the signal intensities vary greatly from lesion to lesion and within lesions themselves. The fibromatoses were either hyperintense, isointense, hypointense, or of mixed signal intensity relative to adjacent skeletal muscle. The hypointense areas appear to be zones of hypocellularity and dense collagen deposition. Microscopically all of the lesions invaded adjacent structures, but the MR appearances of the margins varied and were judged to be well demarcated (n = 14), intermediate (n = 5), or poorly demarcated (n = 6). Our experience shows that fibromatoses have a variable MR appearance no different from that of other soft-tissue lesions, and this variability reflects the composition and cellularity of the lesions. 
GLI3 zinc-finger gene interrupted by translocations in Greig syndrome families. The Greig cephalopolysyndactyly syndrome (GCPS) is an autosomal dominant disorder affecting limb and craniofacial development in humans. GCPS-affected individuals are characterized by postaxial polysyndactyly of hands, preaxial polysyndactyly of feet, macroephaly, a broad base of the nose with mild hypertelorism and a prominent forehead. The genetic locus has been pinpointed to chromosome 7p13 by three balanced translocations associated with GCPS in different families. This assignment is corroborated by the detection of two sporadic GCPS cases carrying overlapping deletions in 7p13 (ref. 7), as well as by tight linkage of GCPS to the epidermal growth factor receptor gene in 7p12-13 (ref. 8). Of the genes that map to this region, those encoding T cell receptor-gamma, interferon-beta 2, epidermal growth factor receptor, and Hox1.4, a potential candidate gene for GCPS, have been excluded from the region in which the deletions overlap. Here we show that two of the three translocations interup the GLI3 gene, a zinc-finger gene of the GLI-Kruppel family already localized to 7p13 (refs 5, 6). The breakpoints are within the first third of the coding sequence. In the third translocation, chromosome 7 is broken at about 10 kilobases downstream of the 3' end of GLI3. Our results indicate that mutations disturbing normal GLI3 expression may have a causative role in GCPS. 
Supraglottic carcinoma: impact of radiation therapy on outcome of patients with positive margins and extracapsular nodal disease. Seventy-nine patients with supraglottic carcinoma treated between 1966 and 1985 are reviewed. All patients were treated with surgery and postoperative radiation therapy. Thirty-five percent of the patients had positive margins at the site of resection of the primary tumor. Of the 25 patients who had positive nodal disease, 13 patients (52%) had either extracapsular extension or soft-tissue or adjacent organ invasion, referred to in composite as "grave signs." The median follow-up of the patients was 4.9 years and all patients were followed for a minimum of 3 years. The disease-free survival for all patients was 76% at 2 years and 71% at 3 years. The locoregional control rate for all patients was 70%. This study demonstrates that there is no difference in local recurrence or disease-free survival, or time to recurrence relative to the status of the surgical margins, which may be a benefit of the postoperative radiation therapy. This study also demonstrates that there is an increase in the number of patients with grave signs with increasing nodal stage. The rate of neck recurrence in patients with grave signs was substantially higher (54%) than in patients without grave signs (8%), even though these patients also had positive lymph nodes. Interestingly, there was also a higher rate of local recurrence among patients who had grave signs. Patients receiving doses higher than 6000 cGy to the primary site had fewer local failures, although within each group of patients with positive or negative surgical margins the differences in survival were minimal. 
Comparison of the Radiation Therapy Oncology Group and American Joint Committee on Cancer staging systems among patients with non-small cell lung cancer receiving hyperfractionated radiation therapy. A report of the Radiation Therapy Oncology Group protocol 83-11. Since 1973, the Radiation Therapy Oncology Group (RTOG) has staged and stratified patients in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) protocols according to the RTOG staging system. In 1985, the American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) revised its lung cancer staging system, with the principle differences from the RTOG system being the staging of involvement of the chest wall and of contralateral mediastinal and hilar lymph nodes. To determine if the AJCC system discriminated outcome differently than the RTOG system in a nonoperative series, all 850 evaluable patients treated with hyperfractionated radiation therapy (RT) on the RTOG protocol 83-11 were restaged by the AJCC system. There was 67% agreement in patient distribution between the following comparable stages in each system: RTOG Stage II/AJCC Stage II; RTOG Stage III/AJCC Stage IIIA; and RTOG Stage IV/AJCC Stage IIIB. Both systems successfully predicted for survival (P less than 0.001), although the RTOG staging was more discriminating (relative risk ratios, 1.59 versus 1.38). Among the 507 favorable patients (those with less than or equal to 5% weight loss and Karnofsky performance status [KPS] of 70 to 100), the RTOG staging was also more predictive (P = 0.004 versus P = 0.01). When RTOG Stage III (462 patients) was divided into those without contralateral mediastinal or hilar adenopathy (AJCC Stage II/IIIA) and those with (AJCC Stage IIIB), a significant survival (P = 0.0001) was noted with 2-year survival rates of 26% versus 4%, respectively. When AJCC Stage IIIA (348 patients) was divided into the patients without chest wall invasion (RTOG Stage II/III) and those with (RTOG Stage IV), a difference in 2-year survival of 22% versus 10% was observed (P = 0.002). Although both staging systems independently predict for survival, a fusion of both staging systems is the most discriminating of outcome. Future nonoperative studies in locally advanced NSCLC should stratify for contralateral nodal involvement (per AJCC staging) and chest wall invasion (per RTOG staging). 
Survival after resection of carcinoma of the splenic flexure. Nine hundred ten patients undergoing colectomy for colon cancer were studied retrospectively. Seventy-four cancers (8 percent) were located at the splenic flexure. The stage at presentation was no different between splenic flexure cancers and colon carcinomas at other sites. Although splenic flexure cancers had twice the incidence of obstruction as did other colon cancers and obstruction in the overall series adversely affected survival, there was no difference in survival between splenic flexure cancer patients and patients with other colon cancers. 
Cortical magnetic resonance imaging changes in elderly inpatients with major depression. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of the study was to determine if magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans of elderly depressed patients differ from MRI scans of age-matched control subjects and age-matched patients with Alzheimer's disease. METHOD: The authors studied 21 patients 60 years or older with major depression, 16 patients with Alzheimer's disease, and 14 age-matched control subjects. RESULTS: Compared to control subjects, depressed patients had greater cerebral sulcal and temporal sulcal atrophy; larger sylvian fissures, lateral ventricles, third ventricles, and temporal horns; and greater severity of subcortical white matter lesions. Depressed patients also had more basal ganglia lesions but similar levels of periventricular hyperintensity. There were no differences between depressed patients with and without delusions on any MRI measure. Depressed patients who received ECT had more temporal horn atrophy and greater subcortical abnormality summary scores than normal subjects. Cortical sulcal atrophy correlated with age at onset of depression. CONCLUSIONS: The findings suggest that elderly hospitalized depressed patients have greater cortical as well as subcortical atrophy and more basal ganglia lesions than age-matched normal control subjects. The correlation of these abnormalities with outcome remains unknown. 
Capsaicin-sensitive nerves mediate esophageal mucosal protection. The esophageal mucosa is exposed to damaging agents both by ingestion and reflux. Using our in vivo rabbit model of esophagitis, we have observed that acute luminal exposure (within 1 to 5 minutes) to potentially harmful agents, such as acid, bile, or ethanol, induces a rapid increase in mucosal blood flow; whereas prolonged exposure (10 to 60 minutes) results in mucosal injury and ablation of blood flow. We have also shown that capsaicin-sensitive mucosal afferent nerves can modulate esophageal blood flow. These findings led us to hypothesize that the reactive increase in blood flow induced by luminal agents represents a mechanism of protection mediated by capsaicin-sensitive nerves. The objective of these experiments was to determine if luminal capsaicin, a specific probe for visceral afferent nerves, could both preserve mucosal blood flow and protect against ethanol injury. Rabbits were subjected to luminal instillation of 50% ethanol with or without 1% capsaicin. Blood flow was measured with microspheres at baseline and after 2 and 10 minutes. Rabbits exposed only to ethanol developed severe mucosal injury coincident with near ablation of mucosal blood flow. In contrast, rabbits exposed to ethanol with capsaicin showed protection of the epithelium with a sixfold increase in mucosal blood flow. We conclude that capsaicin-sensitive nerves in the esophagus are local effectors of mucosal protection by virtue of preserving blood flow. 
Paraprosthetic leak: a complication of cardiac valve replacement. Paraprosthetic leak (PPL) is a rare but potentially serious complication of cardiac valve replacement. Between 1974 and 1988, 1175 prosthetic valves were implanted in 1026 patients by one cardiac surgeon at St. Thomas' Hospital, London. Of these 539 (52.5%) were aortic (AVR), 334 (32.6%) mitral (MVR), 7 (0.7%) tricuspid, and 144 (14%) AV and MV double valve replacements (DVR). There were only 2 triple valve replacements. The prosthetic valves implanted were the Starr-Edwards (7%), Bjork Shiley (11.8%), Lillehei-Kaster (23%), Carpentier-Edwards bioprosthesis (35.2%), Duromedics bileaflet (16.4%) and a variety of other mechanical and bioprosthetic valves (6.6%). Over the 15 year period there were a total of 82 (7%) valve failures of which PPL was diagnosed in 29 (2.5%) valves in 24 patients. Presenting features included cardiac decompensation in 72%, bacterial endocarditis in 12% and haemolytic anaemia in 12%. One patient (4%) had no symptoms. Nineteen patients underwent re-operation. Median time to re-operation was 15 months (range 1-65 months) with a re-operative mortality of 22%. Clinical evidence of prosthetic valve infection was found in 79% of MVR and 67% of AVR. A heavily calcified aortic annulus, found in 47% of patients, may also have contributed to PPL after AVR. 
Sun-related skin diseases. Severe photoaging of the skin, which may be caused by exposure to both natural and artificial ultraviolet light, ultimately results in actinic keratoses and cancer. Cancers are common on the head, neck, arms, and hands. Because of the potential for metastasis, squamous cell carcinomas generally require surgical excision and histologic examination. Although metastasis is rare with basal cell carcinoma, neglected lesions around the eyes, nose, or ears can invade bone, nerves, and cartilage and may cause death. Avoidance of sun, physical protection, and regular use of sunscreens are recommended. 
From Papanicolaou to Bethesda: the rationale for a new cervical cytologic classification. The Bethesda System for reporting cervical/vaginal diagnoses was introduced to replace the numerical Papanicolaou class designations, thereby facilitating precise communication between cytopathologist and clinician. The terminology for squamous epithelial lesions includes the following categories: 1) atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance; 2) squamous intraepithelial lesion (SIL), which encompasses the spectrum of squamous cell carcinoma precursors, divided into low-grade SIL (human papillomavirus [HPV]-associated cellular changes, mild dysplasia, and cervical intraepithelial neoplasia [CIN] I) and high-grade SIL (moderate dysplasia, severe dysplasia, and carcinoma in situ and CIN II and III); and 3) squamous cell carcinoma. The rationale for including HPV-related changes (koilocytosis) with CIN I within low-grade SIL is based on the morphologic, behavioral, and virologic similarity of these two lesions, which precludes their separation in a consistent and reliable fashion. For the same reasons, CIN II and III lesions have been combined within the category of high-grade SIL. The term "atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance" is used for cytologic findings that do not fulfill the criteria for defined benign reactive changes or SIL. Therefore, this term is more restricted in usage as compared with the wide range of interpretations previously ascribed to "atypia" or "inflammatory atypia.". 
Influence of balloon size and stenosis morphology on immediate and delayed elastic recoil after percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty. After successful coronary angioplasty, the minimal luminal diameter of the dilated coronary artery segment is generally smaller than the diameter of the largest balloon catheter at the maximal inflation pressure. The determinants of this phenomenon were studied in 28 patients. Biplane angiograms were obtained after intracoronary administration of isosorbide dinitrate (1 mg) before, immediately and 24 h after coronary angioplasty. Balloon and coronary luminal diameters were measured by automated contour detection. Immediately after the procedure, the difference between inflated balloon diameter and minimal luminal diameter averaged 0.93 +/- 0.43 mm for the entire group and was greater both in eccentric stenoses (1.13 +/- 0.39 vs. 0.70 +/- 0.36 mm; p less than 0.01) and after angioplasty with an oversized balloon (1.20 +/- 0.37 vs. 0.71 +/- 0.33 mm; p less than 0.005). At 24 h, the balloon - minimal luminal diameter difference was unchanged at the group level (0.86 +/- 0.38 mm, but the minimal luminal diameter increased significantly in the subgroup of coronary segments dilated with an oversized balloon (1.97 +/- 0.37 vs. 1.81 +/- 0.28 mm; p less than 0.05). Thus, the difference between the minimal diameter of a dilated coronary segment immediately after a successful coronary balloon angioplasty procedure and the maximal diameter of the inflated balloon catheter is dependent both on eccentricity of the stenosis and on the balloon/artery diameter ratio. Moreover, the increase in minimal luminal diameter 24 h after angioplasty performed with an oversized balloon suggest that in addition to elastic recoil partly reversible factors related to vessel barotrauma are involved. 
Immunoreactive transforming growth factor alpha is commonly present in colorectal neoplasia. Surgical specimens from 19 patients with invasive colorectal cancers and 12 specimens of normal mucosa from the same patients were examined immunohistochemically for the production of the immunoreactive (IR-) transforming growth factor (TGF)-alpha and IR-epidermal growth factor (EGF) with an anti-TGF-alpha monoclonal antibody (MAb) OAL-MTG01 and anti-EGF MAb KEM-10. Immunoreactive TGF-alpha was detected in 16 (84.2%) of 19 colorectal cancers. In contrast, there was no IR-TGF-alpha in the gland cells of normal mucosa. Immunoreactive EGF was detected in 7 (36.8%) of 19 colorectal cancers and 1 (8.3%) of 12 cases of normal mucosa. The production of both IR-TGF-alpha and IR-EGF in colorectal cancer did not differ by histologic type and Dukes' stage. Immunoreactive TGF-alpha was detected at significantly higher incidence than IR-EGF in colorectal cancer. These results indicate that IR-TGF-alpha should prove valuable as a possible tumor marker in colorectal cancers, and it may be very useful in understanding the biology of colorectal cancer. 
Comparison of chest pain, electrocardiographic changes and thallium-201 scintigraphy during varying exercise intensities in men with stable angina pectoris. This study was performed to evaluate the presence of angina pectoris, electrocardiographic changes and reversible thallium-201 defects resulting from 2 different levels of exercise in 19 patients with known coronary artery disease and evidence of exercise-induced ischemia. The exercise protocols consisted of a symptom-limited incremental exercise test (Bruce protocol) followed within 3 to 14 days by a submaximal, steady-state exercise test performed at 70% of the maximal heart rate achieved during the Bruce protocol. The presence and time of onset of angina and electrocardiographic changes (greater than or equal to 0.1 mV ST-segment depression) as well as oxygen uptake, exercise duration and pressure-rate product were recorded. Thallium-201 (2.5 to 3.0 mCi) was injected during the last minute of exercise during both protocols, and the images were analyzed using both computer-assisted quantitation and visual interpretations. Incremental exercise resulted in anginal symptoms in 84% of patients, and electrocardiographic changes and reversible thallium-201 defects in all patients. In contrast, submaximal exercise produced anginal symptoms in only 26% (p less than 0.01) and electrocardiographic changes in only 47% (p less than 0.05), but resulted in thallium-201 defects in 89% of patients (p = not significant). The locations of the thallium-201 defects, when present, were not different between the 2 exercise protocols. These findings confirm the sequence of the ischemic cascade using 2 levels of exercise and demonstrate that the cascade theory is applicable during varying ischemic intensities in the same patient. 
Hypoxaemia during anaesthesia--an observer study. We have investigated 296 inpatients in a single-blind observer study to determine the incidence, degree and duration of hypoxaemia during anaesthesia. The clinical recognition of hypoxaemia, period of time until recognition and risk factors were studied. Oxygen saturation (Spo2) was monitored continuously with a pulse oximeter (Ohmeda, model 3700). One or more episodes of mild hypoxaemia (Spo2 86-90%) were recorded in 53% of patients. Severe hypoxaemia with Spo2 values less than 81% were recorded in 20% of patients. The mild hypoxaemic episodes lasted up to 34.6 min (mean 2.3 min) and 70% were not detected by the anaesthetist. In the remaining 30% of episodes, the anaesthetist diagnosed the complication with a mean time delay of 70 s. After intervention a mean time delay of 57 s was recorded until Spo2 exceeded 90%. Utilizing a stepwise multiple logistic regression analysis, we found that risk factors associated with a greater incidence of hypoxaemia were patient age (P less than 0.005) and anaesthetic technique (P less than 0.00001). We conclude that hypoxaemic episodes in our operating rooms are common during anaesthesia and suggest preoxygenation in all patients in addition to administration of supplementary oxygen during arousal from anaesthesia and during transfer to the recovery room. 
Portal venous barium intravasation complicating barium enema examination. Venous intravasation of contrast is a potentially life-threatening complication of the barium enema examination. A patient in whom portal venous contrast intravasation was nearly fatal is presented, and the significant morbidity and mortality from this unusual event is reviewed. Since barium infiltration into the venous system almost always occurs in the setting of altered mucosal integrity, this examination should be used cautiously in patients with inflammatory bowel disease or diverticulitis. Prompt recognition and rapid resuscitation are critical to the survival of patients with contrast intravasation. 
Tricuspid atresia: association with persistent truncus arteriosus. Clinical, echo-Doppler, and pathologic data of a rare case of tricuspid atresia in association with truncus arteriosus are presented. There are only six patients (including the patient reported here) with this anomaly in whom detailed pathologic and/or clinical descriptions are available in the literature. An additional six cases were mentioned in the literature but without any details. A prevalence rate of 1.4% among tricuspid atresia cases is estimated. All infants presented with symptoms of cyanosis and/or congestive heart failure within a few days to 2 months after birth and died shortly thereafter. Cardiomegaly and increased pulmonary vascular markings on the chest x-ray film and left axis deviation with left ventricular hypertrophy on the ECG are usually present. Echocardiographic, catheterization, and angiocardiographic studies are helpful in documenting anatomic and physiologic features of this anomaly. Pathologically, the muscular type of tricuspid atresia, type I or II truncus arteriosus, a large subtruncal VSD, and a hypoplastic right ventricle are present. It is concluded that coexistence of tricuspid atresia and truncus arteriosus is rare; clinical, laboratory, and pathologic features are distinctive; the clinical presentation early in life with rapid demise is common; and prompt palliative surgery immediately after recognition of this anomaly should be undertaken. 
Association of exotoxin-producing group A streptococci and severe disease in children. Clinical features and microbiologic data on all cases of serious (hospitalized) Group A streptococcal infections in children managed at our institution between 1985 and 1988 are presented. All 6 cases were caused by toxin-producing strains. Four of 6 were toxin A-producing strains whereas none of 58 community-acquired (Group A streptococcal) pharyngeal isolates in the same period was a toxin A producer. A review of the literature on the incidence of toxin A-producing strains provides information suggesting a resurgence of such strains in the late 1980s after a relative disappearance of toxin B production in isolates from these patients was also significantly greater than in the isolates acquired from the community in uncomplicated pharyngitis. These findings suggest a role for exotoxin in severe manifestations of Group A streptococcal disease in children. 
Distribution of thymic tissue in the mediastinal adipose tissue. The distribution of thymic tissue in the anterior mediastinal, retrocarinal, and preaortic fat was examined histologically in 27 autopsy subjects. Thymic tissue was found in the anterior mediastinal fat in 12 subjects (44.4%), in the retrocarinal fat in two (7.4%), and in the preaortic fat in none. The finding of ectopic thymic tissue in these areas has not been reported previously, would appear to be surgically inaccessible via a median sternotomy, and may be responsible in part for some of the failures of thymectomy in the treatment of myasthenia gravis. 
Identifying anterior segment crystals. A series of 22 patients with crystals in the anterior segment of the eye was examined by specular microscopy. Of 10 patients with hypermature cataract and hyperrefringent bodies in the anterior chamber cholesterol crystals were identified in four patients and in six of the 10 in whom aspirate was obtained cholesterol crystals were demonstrated in three, two of these having shown crystals on specular microscopy. In 10 patients with intracorneal crystalline deposits, cholesterol crystals were found on specular microscopy, including one case of Schnyder's crystalline corneal dystrophy. Of two patients with multiple myeloma, corneal crystals were demonstrated in one. Crystals of the anterior segment of the eye are most likely to be cholesterol, and identification is important for future treatment. 
Simple examination techniques to aid in the diagnosis of urethral diverticulum. Patients with urethral diverticula classically present with dyspareunia, dribbling of urine, chronic dysuria, and/or a tender suburethral mass. Physical examination, urethroscopy, positive pressure urethrography, and the urethral pressure profile may not confirm the suspected diagnosis. Three simple diagnostic maneuvers are presented to aid in confirming the diagnosis before surgical exploration. 
Symptomatic and silent gall stones in the community. The prevalence of gall stone disease in a stratified random sample of 1896 British adults (72.2% of those approached) was established using real time ultrasound. The prevalence rose with age, except in women of 40-49 years, so that at 60-69 years, 22.4% of women and 11.5% of men had gall stones or had undergone cholecystectomy. The cholecystectomy rate of people with gall stone disease was higher in women than in men (43.5% v 24%, p less than 0.05). Very few subjects with gall stones had convincing biliary symptoms. In women, 10.4% had symptoms according to a questionnaire definition of biliary pain and 6.3% according to conventional history taking, while no men at all admitted to biliary pain. Nevertheless, cholecystectomy in men had nearly always been preceded by convincing biliary symptoms. The age at cholecystectomy was, on average, nine years less than the age at detection of silent gall stones in both sexes. It is concluded that either gall stones are especially prone to cause symptoms in younger people or that there are two kinds of cholelithiasis - symptomatic and silent. The lack of symptomatic gall stones in cross sectional surveys is probably due to their rapid diagnosis and treatment. 
Genetic susceptibility to Parkinson's disease. Genetic factors clearly cause Lewy-body Parkinson's disease (PD) in a subset of autosomal-dominant families. However, most cases of PD are sporadic. The two most likely models of four discussed for sporadic PD are the reduced penetrance model and the multifactorial model. Sporadic PD is likely to be caused by the combined effect of environmental precipitating factors and genetic susceptibility factors. Because the number of major genetic factors is likely to be small, these hypotheses can be tested and genetic factors located using linkage mapping techniques. The affected pair analysis methods are especially suited to PD. Finding the genetic susceptibility factors for PD is important because this may be the fastest way to identify the environmental precipitating factors and because it may lead to prevention of PD. Because of the usefulness of identifying genetic susceptibility factors for PD, we are carrying out linkage studies in a group of 16 large autosomal-dominant families with PD and more than 300 living affected PD pairs. 
The rhombotin family of cysteine-rich LIM-domain oncogenes: distinct members are involved in T-cell translocations to human chromosomes 11p15 and 11p13. A chromosomal translocation in a T-cell leukemia involving the short arm of human chromosome 11 at band 11p15 disrupts the rhombotin gene. This gene encodes a protein with duplicated cysteine-rich regions called LIM domains, which show homology to zinc-binding proteins and to iron-sulfur centers of ferredoxins. Two homologues of the rhombotin gene have now been isolated. One of these, designated Rhom-2, is located on human chromosome 11 at band 11p13, where a cluster of T-cell leukemia-specific translocations occur; all translocation breakpoints at 11p13 are upstream of the Rhom-2 gene. Human and mouse Rhom-2 are highly conserved and, like rhombotin, encode two tandem cysteine-rich LIM domains. Rhom-2 mRNA is expressed in early mouse development in central nervous system, lung, kidney, liver, and spleen but only very low levels occur in thymus. The other gene, designated Rhom-3, is not on chromosome 11 but also retains homology to the LIM domain of rhombotin. Since the Rhom-2 gene is such a common site of chromosomal damage in T-cell tumors, the consistency of translocations near the rhombotin gene was further examined. A second translocation adjacent to rhombotin was found and at the same position as in the previous example. Therefore, chromosome bands 11p15 (rhombotin) and 11p13 (Rhom-2) are consistent sites of chromosome translocation in T-cell leukemia, with the 11p15 target more rarely involved. The results define the rhombotin gene family as a class of T-cell oncogenes with duplicated cysteine-rich LIM domains. 
Different mechanisms of polyuria and natriuresis associated with paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia. The mechanism of polyuria associated with paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia (SVT) was investigated in 8 patients. SVT was induced artificially and sustained for 60 minutes. Urine and blood samples were collected every 30 minutes. During the latter half of SVT, urine flow increased twofold in the control subjects before SVT. Urinary sodium excretion increased significantly (p less than 0.01) within 30 minutes after SVT. Urinary excretion of antidiuretic hormone (ADH) decreased (p less than 0.01) during the latter half of SVT and increased (p less than 0.01) after SVT, respectively. Plasma level of ADH did not change during SVT but increased (p less than 0.05) after SVT. The concentration of plasma atrial natriuretic polypeptide (ANP) increased significantly (p less than 0.05) before SVT ended. Urinary excretion of prostaglandin E2 increased significantly (p less than 0.05) after termination of SVT. The percent changes in the urinary excretion of prostaglandin E2 were correlated (r = 0.713, p less than 0.001) with those of ADH. There was also a correlation (r = 0.6, p less than 0.001) between the percent changes in the urinary excretion of prostaglandin E2 and those of sodium. Their findings suggest that the polyuria during SVT is attributed mainly to the inhibition of ADH release and that the natriuresis after SVT is due not only to the increased ANP but also to the increased renal prostaglandin E2 probably stimulated by ADH. 
Comparison of acute and chronic protein-energy malnutrition on host antitumor immune mechanisms. Protein-calorie malnutrition (PCM) is prevalent in cancer patients. However, the effect of PCM on anti-tumor immunity is unclear and critically important in an era of improving results with adoptive immunotherapy. This study examined the effect of short- and long-term PCM on tumor-specific and natural immune effector mechanisms in a murine neuroblastoma (C1300 NRB) model. A/J mice received an isocaloric 2.5% or 24% casein diet for 3 or 8 weeks before inoculation with tumor. Three weeks later lymphocytes from tumor-bearing mice were harvested for determination of cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) generation and natural killer (NK) cell cytotoxicity. Both 3 and 8 weeks of PCM significantly reduced mean total body weight by 25% (p less than 0.001) and 41% (p less than 0.001), respectively, compared with regularly nourished mice. Short-term PCM did not inhibit CTL or NK cytotoxicity, whereas long-term PCM significantly diminished CTL generation (p less than 0.001) but preserved NK cytotoxic function. These results indicate that CTL development against autologous tumor, in contrast to basal NK function, is dependent on host nutritional status. Mean tumor growth, determined by tumor-weight to carcass-weight ratio, was unchanged for both short- and long-term protein-energy deprived groups compared with results in regularly nourished mice. These findings suggest that NK function is the predominant effector mechanism inhibiting C1300 NRB growth and that NK tumoricidal capacity is preserved during PCM. 
Pathophysiology of isolated systolic hypertension in elderly patients: Doppler echocardiographic insights. Systemic hemodynamics were evaluated with aortic pulsed wave Doppler echocardiography in 79 elderly subjects with isolated systolic hypertension participating in the Systolic Hypertension in the Elderly Program (SHEP) and were compared with the values in 39 normal age-matched subjects. Cardiac output was elevated (4.50 +/- 1.13 L/min versus 3.94 +/- 1.12 L/min, p less than 0.05) in patients with isolated systolic hypertension in comparison with values in normal elderly subjects. Systemic vascular resistance did not differ between both groups (2140 +/- 536 dyn.sec/cm-5 versus 2011 +/- 553 dyn.sec/cm-5, p = NS). The mean acceleration of blood during left ventricular ejection was similar in patients with isolated systolic hypertension in comparison with normals (12.6 +/- 5.6 m/sec2 versus 11.5 +/- 3.5 m/sec2, p = NS). Patients with isolated systolic hypertension had significantly decreased arterial compliance, as measured by the stroke volume-to-pulse pressure ratio (0.77 +/- 0.26 cm3/mm Hg versus 1.11 +/- 0.30 cm3/mm Hg, p less than 0.0001). The prevalence of aortic and mitral regurgitation as well as valvular and annular calcification did not differ between analyzed groups. Isolated systolic hypertension in elderly patients appears to be multifactorial, with reduced arterial compliance and increased cardiac output both playing a role. 
Reading problems in adult chronic headache sufferers. In a questionnaire survey we determined the prevalence of problems with reading, at present as well as in the past, in adult chronic headache sufferers as compared with age- and sex-matched controls. The reading problems inquired about were those with reading in general, reading quickly, prolonged reading and reading comprehension. The subjects were also asked about present and past problems with writing, concentrating, performing mathematics and overall learning. Significant differences in the prevalences of the problems studied between the headache sufferers and controls were observed on just two items and only for the female groups. These items were present problems with reading comprehension (39.3% versus 7.5%; p = 0.002) and concentrating (46.4% versus 17.5%; p = 0.015). We concluded that adult female headache sufferers have impaired reading comprehension and concentration abilities which do not seem to originate from the past. 
Paramyotonia congenita and hyperkalemic periodic paralysis map to the same sodium-channel gene locus. Paramyotonia congenita (PC), an autosomal dominant muscle disease, shares some clinical and electrophysiological similarities with another myotonic muscle disorder, hyperkalemic periodic paralysis (HYPP). However, clinical and electrophysiologic differences allow differentiation of the two disorders. The HYPP locus was recently shown to be linked to a skeletal muscle sodium-channel gene probe. We now report that PC maps to the same locus (LOD score 4.4, theta = 0 at assumed penetrance of .95). These linkage results, coupled with physiological data demonstrating abnormal sodium-channel function in patients with PC, implicate a sodium-channel gene as an important candidate for the site of mutation responsible for PC. Furthermore, this is strong evidence for the hypothesis that PC and HYPP are allelic disorders. 
Efficacy of low-molecular-weight heparin in the management of intermittent claudication. Treating chronic arterial occlusive disease with heparin is controversial because of the risks associated with long-term anticoagulant therapy. Low molecular weight (LMW) heparin (mw about 5000 Dalton), which selectively inhibits the Xa factor with minimal risk of hemorrhage, seems to offer new possibilities in the prevention and treatment of both venous and acute arterial thromboembolism. Therefore, 44 patients with intermittent claudication were recruited to a randomized, double-blind, controlled study. Twenty-two were treated for six months with a single daily subcutaneous dose (15,000 UaXa) of LMW heparin and 22 with placebo administered in the same way over the same period of time. After six months, LMW heparin treatment not only improved walking capacity (by lengthening the pain-free walking time by 25%) but also significantly modified the hemorrheologic pattern (by reducing fibrinogen concentrations and whole blood viscosity at low shear rates). LMW heparin also exerted an antithrombotic and profibrinolytic effect by significantly increasing both the anti-Xa factor and plasminogen activity without markedly modifying activated partial thromboplastin time (+20%). No LMW heparin-treated patient hemorrhaged or reported other noteworthy side effects. These results suggest LMW heparin might be a useful drug in the long-term treatment of chronic arterial occlusive disease of the limbs. 
Role of conversion of xanthine dehydrogenase to oxidase in ischemic rat liver cell injury. This study was undertaken to determine whether hepatic ischemia and the subsequent reflow of blood have any effect on the conversion of xanthine dehydrogenase to xanthine oxidase (XO). Ischemia of the liver for 90 or 120 minutes did not permit survival of the animals. XO represented 15% of the total xanthine dehydrogenase plus XO activity in the control liver. XO activity remained unchanged even after 90 minutes of hepatic ischemia, although a marked increase in lipid peroxide in the liver tissue was observed during the reperfusion. When hepatic ischemia was prolonged for 6 hours (animals were dead), XO activity rose to 35% of the total activity. Incubation of the liver at 37 degrees C resulted in a definite change in XO activity dependent on the length of incubation period. Although no significant changes occurred in XO activity during the first 2 hours of incubation, a marked XO conversion was observed between 2 and 4 hours, and a maximal conversion was achieved after 6 hours of incubation. These results suggest that XO newly generated during ischemia has a very limited role in oxygen free radical production after resuming perfusion. 
Increased therapeutic index of antineoplastic drugs in combination with intracellular histamine antagonists. L-Histidinol, a protein synthesis inhibitor and structural analogue of L-histidine, has been demonstrated in chemotherapy-treated mice to be cytoprotective to normal stem cells but to enhance cytotoxicity to tumor cells. N,N-Diethyl-2-[4-(phenylmethyl) phenoxy]ethanamine.HCl (DPPE) is an antagonist of recently described microsomal and nuclear intracellular histamine receptors implicated in the mediation of proliferation and modulation of prostaglandin synthesis. DPPE is cytotoxic to tumor cells in vitro and cytoprotective to the gut in vivo. Noting the similar pharmacologic profiles for histidinol and DPPE and the structural resemblance between histidinol and histamine, we tested 1) whether binding to intracellular histamine receptors may be important to the action of histidinol, 2) whether there exists a differential effect of DPPE and histidinol on proliferating normal and transformed or malignant cells, and 3) whether DPPE, like histidinol, protects host cells from the effects of chemotherapy while augmenting tumor cell kill in vivo. It was observed that histidinol does compete at intracellular histamine receptors in isolated microsomes and nuclei, but with significantly lower affinity than DPPE. Nevertheless, for each agent, potency at intracellular histamine receptors correlates with potency to inhibit DNA and protein synthesis, without cytotoxicity, in normal mitogen-stimulated murine lymphocytes and to kill transformed mouse lymphocytes or MCF-7 human breast cancer cells. As demonstrated previously for histidinol (1-2 g/kg), DPPE (4 mg/kg) protected murine bone marrow progenitors from doxorubicin or fluorouracil, while doses of 4-50 mg/kg significantly enhanced the antitumor activity of doxorubicin and daunorubicin in murine models of early cancer. One postulate to explain the effects of intracellular histamine receptor ligands is that intracellular histamine mediates DNA and protein synthesis, possibly through a downward modulation of growth-inhibitory prostaglandin levels. Antagonism of the intracellular action of histamine at intracellular histamine receptors by DPPE or histidinol may result in differential perturbations of growth/eicosanoid metabolism in normal and malignant cells, thus forming the basis of a new approach to chemotherapy. 
Alfentanil infusion for postoperative pain: a comparison of epidural and intravenous routes. The efficacy of intravenous (iv) and epidural infusions of alfentanil for postoperative pain relief was investigated in 24 patients (ASA physical status 1-2) who were scheduled for abdominal hysterectomy. The patients were allocated randomly to receive either epidural or iv alfentanil. In both groups, a loading dose of 15 micrograms.kg-1 was administered, followed by a constant rate infusion of 18 micrograms.kg-1.h-1 alfentanil for 20 h. Both routes provided similar degrees of analgesia; however, analgesia occurred earlier in the intravenously treated group (P less than 0.03). Mean plasma alfentanil concentrations (Cps) varied between 42 and 82 ng.ml-1 in the iv group and 23 and 68 ng.ml-1 in the epidural group, with higher concentrations in the iv group for the first 60 min only (P less than 0.01). Cps increased with infusion time, suggesting accumulation of alfentanil. After infusion ended, pain recurred at the same time in both groups, whereas the alfentanil Cps still were greater than 45 ng/ml. Postoperative epinephrine concentrations decreased after 60 min of infusion (P less than 0.02), whereas, after 6 h, cortisol levels decreased to preoperative values. Norepinephrine concentrations decreased only slightly. The only clinically meaningful effect on vital signs that occurred was an abrupt reduction of respiratory rate after the iv loading dose. PaCO2 increased to the same extent in both groups during the first 15 min only. The incidence of opioid-related side effects was similar in both groups. These results suggest that the iv and epidural routes were equally effective for providing postoperative pain control and controlling the postoperative response to surgical stress. 
Dendritic hypertrophy in Purkinje neurons of old Fischer 344 rats after long-term ethanol treatment. Metric parameters of Purkinje cell dendritic networks in 24- to 26-month-old Fischer 344 rats were determined after 48 weeks of chronic ethanol intake. Measurements included the total number and length of all segments/network, the total number and length of segments within topologically defined segment categories, and the mean length of segments in each category. A main effect of ethanol was expressed as a significant increase in cumulative length within one category of terminal segments. This increase was the result of a significant increase in mean length/segment in that category. Metric changes in other segment categories were not significant, showing that changes in the networks during ethanol treatment were not distributed randomly. Recovery after ethanol treatment was associated with further nonrandom remodeling of these networks. Significant differences in lengths of terminal segments were no longer present, but internal segments in networks of both pair-fed and ethanol-fed rats were significantly longer. Only one category of internal segments showed this change during recovery. The data showed that long term ethanol treatment in old rats, at a time when effects of aging processes were prominent in Purkinje cell networks, was associated with remodeling of those networks through dendritic extension. This effect was interpreted as compensatory growth in surviving networks following ethanol-related neuronal loss and/or damage to the surrounding neuropil. Recovery from dietary treatment produced further internal remodeling of those networks that was not related specifically to ethanol. It could be shown, however, that the restructuring processes that resulted in longer internal segments after dietary recovery were different in the pair-fed and the ethanolfed rats. 
Combination therapy of OK432 and recombinant human interferon alpha A/D on viral myocarditis in mice starting after infection. We investigated the effects of OK432, recombinant human interferon alpha A/D (rIFN alpha A/D) and a combination of these drugs on murine acute myocarditis due to encephalomyocarditis virus. Mice were administered 1 KE of OK432 and 10(4)U/g of rIFN alpha A/D starting 24 hr after viral inoculation for 14 days. The survival rate of mice having the combination therapy was significantly higher than that of untreated mice on day 21 (15 of 20 vs. 6 of 20, P less than .001), whereas the viral titer in the heart, the heart weight/body weight ratio and the scores for myocardial inflammation and necrosis were significantly lower. On the other hand, therapy with OK432 or rIFN alpha A/D individually improved neither the survival rate nor the extent of myocardial damage. The natural killer cell activity in the combination therapy mice on day 3 after infection was significantly increased in comparison with untreated mice (46.2 +/- 5.5 vs. 37.7 +/- 2.8%, P less than .01), and the cytotoxicity of peritoneal macrophages was increased (45.0 vs. 26.7%). Thus, the combination therapy of OK432 and rIFN alpha A/D was more effective than the therapy with OK432 alone or rIFN alpha A/D alone against acute viral myocarditis when the treatment was started early after infection, and the stimulation of host immunologic response by OK432 may be important for this combination therapy. 
Efficacy and safety of intravenous sotalol for termination of paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia. The Sotalol Versus Placebo Multicenter Study Group. A double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover, multicenter study was conducted to study the efficacy and safety of a single intravenous dose of sotalol (1.5 mg/kg over 10 minutes) in achieving normal sinus rhythm in paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia (SVT) lasting greater than or equal to 15 minutes. Patients were randomized to either sotalol or placebo as initial treatment, and if the SVT was not terminated a crossover was performed after 20 minutes. A total of 43 patients were enrolled, 38 of whom with spontaneous (n = 14) or induced (n = 24) SVT were analyzed for sotalol efficacy. Most patients (n = 27) had atrioventricular (AV) nodal reentrant tachycardia, and an important subgroup (n = 11) had circus movement tachycardia, using an accessory pathway for retrograde conduction. The number of patients converting to sinus rhythm as a result of the initial treatment was significantly higher in the sotalol group than in the placebo group, for spontaneous (p less than 0.005) as well as for induced tachycardia (p less than 0.001). Sinus rhythm was achieved within 30 minutes in 83% of all patients who received sotalol as the first drug, compared with 16% of the patients first receiving placebo (p less than 0.0001). For sotalol safety analysis, 42 patients were included. A total of 37 patients received sotalol, 19 as the first treatment, and 18 as the second treatment, while 25 patients received placebo. A total of 15 possible adverse effects were reported, occurring in 10 patients with sotalol versus 4 with placebo. The only severe side effect (hypotension) necessitating termination of drug administration occurred with placebo. No proarrhythmic effects were observed. 
Oriental cholangiohepatitis: pathologic, clinical, and radiologic features. Oriental cholangiohepatitis, an endemic disease in Southeast Asia, is characterized by recurrent attacks of abdominal pain, fever, and jaundice. Pathologically, the intra- and extrahepatic ducts are dilated and contain soft, pigmented stone and pus. There is proliferation of bile ducts and infiltration of inflammatory cells along the periportal spaces and hepatic parenchyma. Localized intrahepatic segmental ductal stenosis may be present, especially in the lateral segment of the left lobe or posterior segment of the right hepatic lobe. The cause of the disease is not known, but associations with clonorchiasis, ascariasis, and nutritional deficiency have been suggested. Sonographic and CT findings include intra- or extrahepatic duct stones, dilatation of the extrahepatic duct with relatively mild or no dilatation of the intrahepatic ducts, localized dilatation of the lobar or segmental bile ducts, increased periportal echogenicity, segmental hepatic atrophy, and gallstones. Cholangiographic findings include bile duct stones; disproportionately severe dilatation of the extrahepatic ducts with mild or no dilatation of the intrahepatic ducts; and focal strictures, acute peripheral tapering, straightening, rigidity, decreased arborization, and an increased branching angle of the intrahepatic bile ducts. 
Dose-dependent kinetics of orally administered 6-mercaptopurine in children with leukemia. To determine whether the pharmacokinetics of 6-mercaptopurine (6-MP) would show dose dependency, we studied three different single oral doses in eight children (aged 3.6 to 15.1 years) with acute leukemia in remission. Marked interindividual differences in maximum plasma concentration (Cmax) and the area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC) were observed when children received the 50 mg/m2 dose. This variability decreased when the doses were increased. Six of the eight children showed a disproportionate increase in the AUC with increasing doses; the other two had a proportionate relationship between the AUC and dose. Overall mean (+/- SD) Cmax and AUC values increased disproportionately (88 +/- 123, to 326 +/- 194, to 653 +/- 344 ng/ml for Cmax, and 147 +/- 180, to 451 +/- 177, to 1291 +/- 415 ng/ml per hour for AUC, respectively) when the dose increased from 50 to 87.5 mg/m2 and then to 175 mg/m2. The results suggest that a saturable first-pass metabolism of oral 6-MP occurs with increasing oral doses in some, but not all, children. Whether and to what extent this pharmacokinetic character of oral 6-MP affects the interindividual difference in systemic exposure to the drug in children with leukemia receiving maintenance therapy require further studies. 
Nerve growth and expression of receptors for nerve growth factor in tumors of melanocyte origin. Nerve growth factor (NGF) stimulates growth and differentiation of sensory and sympathetic neurons. It is not known what role NGF plays in melanoma development, but nevus and malignant melanoma cells express NGF-receptor (NGF-R). We counted nerve fibers within melanocytic nevi, primary cutaneous melanomas, and cutaneous melanoma metastases using a monoclonal antibody (MoAb) as marker against a 200-kD glycoprotein that is expressed on human nerves. The expression of NGF-R was studied in serial cryostat sections using a MoAb against the NGF-R. Compared to normal skin, increased numbers of nerve fibers were found in 72 melanocytic nevi. In congenital nevi their number significantly increased with age. In 47 primary cutaneous melanomas the number of nerve fibers decreased in proportion to tumor thickness. In 33 cutaneous melanoma metastases no accumulation of nerve fibers was found. NGF-R was not expressed in normal skin melanocytes and in the majority of nevus cells in melanocytic nevi. Considerable numbers of NGF-R-positive nervus cells were found only in some congenital nevi and few acquired nevi with dysplastic features. By contrast, in primary and metastatic melanomas higher expression of NGF-R was observed. The increased number of nerve fibers in melanocytic nevi suggests that neurite-promoting factors are produced in situ. Production of such factors appears to be lost in malignant melanoma cells. The finding of an inverse correlation between an abundance of nerve fibers in NGF-R-poor nevi and a high expression of NGF-R in melanomas that show no evidence of nerve growth suggest a role of NGF and its receptor in malignant melanocytic tumors. 
Effects of exercise on transmitral gradient and pulmonary artery pressure in patients with mitral stenosis or a prosthetic mitral valve: a Doppler echocardiographic study. Doppler echocardiography was used to determine changes in transmitral gradient and pulmonary artery pressure after exercise in 12 patients with mitral stenosis and 11 patients with a prosthetic mitral valve. The mean transmitral gradient in the mitral stenosis group was 9 +/- 7 mm Hg at rest and increased to 17 +/- 8 mm Hg after exercise. In patients with a prosthetic mitral valve, exercise resulted in an increase in mean transmitral gradient from 5 +/- 2 to 8 +/- 3 mm Hg. Calculated pulmonary artery systolic pressure increased with exercise from 41 +/- 19 to 70 +/- 32 mm Hg in the mitral stenosis group and from 28 +/- 8 to 39 +/- 15 mm Hg in patients with a prosthetic valve. Exercise Doppler echocardiographic evaluation of changes in transmitral gradient and pulmonary artery systolic pressure was found to be technically simple and an important addition to the noninvasive evaluation of patients with mitral valve disease. 
Multivariate analysis to simplify the differential diagnosis of broad complex tachycardia. Univariate analysis has identified several criteria that aid the differential diagnosis of broad complex tachycardia. In this study of 102 consecutive patients multivariate analysis was performed to identify which of 15 clinical and 11 electrocardiographic variables were independent predictors of ventricular tachycardia. These were shown to be a history of myocardial infarction, the QRS waveforms in leads aVF and V1, and a change in axis from sinus rhythm to tachycardia of more than 40 degrees. If none of the criteria was met, the diagnosis was almost certainly supraventricular tachycardia. If one criterion was met the diagnosis was probably supraventricular tachycardia. If two criteria were met then the diagnosis was probably ventricular tachycardia. If three or four criteria were met, the diagnosis was almost certainly ventricular tachycardia. The predictive accuracy was 93%. This was increased to 95% by including two other criteria--definite independent P wave activity and ventricular extrasystoles with the same QRS configuration as that in tachycardia. These criteria were not included in the multivariate analysis because though they were 100% specific they were seldom seen. These four criteria can be used as simple rules in determining the origin of a broad complex tachycardia. 
Expression of c-erbB-2 oncoprotein in gastric carcinoma. Immunoreactivity for c-erbB-2 protein is an independent indicator of poor short-term prognosis in patients with gastric carcinoma. Correlations of c-erbB-2 protein expression with clinical outcomes of gastric carcinomas were studied in 189 gastric carcinomas. There were 23 (12.2%) carcinomas with evidence of c-erbB-2 protein in which the reaction was localized to the cell membrane. There was no significant association between c-erbB-2 staining and the macroscopic or histologic type of the carcinomas. c-erbB-2-stained tumors were more likely to be associated with serosal invasion, nodal involvement, and peritoneal metastasis, than c-erbB-2-unstained ones. In addition, c-erbB-2 was stained in none of early gastric carcinomas. The 5-year survival rates of the c-erbB-2 protein-positive and the protein-negative group were 11% and 50%, respectively. When the c-erbB-2 tissue status and seven clinicopathologic variables as conventional prognostic factors were entered simultaneously into the Cox regression model, serosal invasion, hepatic metastasis, peritoneal metastasis, nodal status, and c-erbB-2 tissue status emerged as independent prognostic variables. The results suggested that c-erbB-2 protein expression might be enhanced in advanced stages during the progression of gastric carcinoma. In this particular group of patients, immunoreactivity for c-erbB-2 protein is an indicator of poor short-term prognosis. 
Quantitative angiography after directional coronary atherectomy. OBJECTIVE--To assess by quantitative analysis the immediate angiographic results of directional coronary atherectomy. To compare the effects of successful atherectomy with those of successful balloon dilatation in a series of patients with matched lesions. DESIGN--Case series. SETTING--Tertiary referral centre. PATIENTS--62 patients in whom directional coronary atherectomy was attempted between 7 September 1989 and 31 December 1990. INTERVENTIONS--Directional coronary atherectomy. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES--Increase in minimal luminal diameter of coronary artery segment. RESULTS--Angiographic success on the basis of intention to treat was obtained in 54 patients (87%). In four patients the lesion could not be crossed by the atherectomy device; all four had an uneventful conventional balloon angioplasty. Four of the 58 patients who underwent atherectomy were subsequently referred for coronary bypass surgery because of failure or complications; three of them sustained a transmural infarction. In the successful cases, coronary atherectomy resulted in an increase in the minimal luminal diameter from 1.1 mm to 2.5 mm with a concomitant decrease of the diameter stenosis from 62% to 22%. In the subset of 37 patients in which the changes induced were compared with conventional balloon angioplasty atherectomy increased the minimal luminal diameter more than balloon angioplasty (1.6 v 0.8 mm; p less than 0.0001). Conventional histology showed media or adventitia in 26% of the atherectomy specimens. In hospital complications occurred in six patients who had undergone a successful procedure: two transmural infarctions, two subendocardial infarctions, one transient ischaemia attack, and one death due to delayed rupture of the atherectomised vessel. All patients were clinically evaluated at one and six months. One patient had persisting angina (New York Heart Association class II), one patient sustained a myocardial infarction, one patient underwent a percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty for early restenosis, and one patient underwent coronary bypass surgery because of a coronary aneurysm formation. At six months 80% (36/47) of the patients were symptom free. CONCLUSIONS--Coronary atherectomy achieved a better immediate angiographic result than balloon angioplasty; however, in view of the complication rate in this preliminary series, which may be related to a learning curve, a randomised study is needed to show whether this procedure is as safe as a conventional balloon angioplasty. 
Current chemotherapy of head and neck cancer. This article reviews the results of over 50 published trials testing the use of chemotherapy in patients with squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck. Among the trials using chemotherapy before standard surgery and/or radiotherapy in stage III and IV disease, none has shown an improvement in survival compared with surgery and/or radiotherapy alone. In these studies, the survival at 3 to 5 years has been generally 40% to 50%. Several trials using chemotherapy after standard therapy, however, have reported survival benefits of 10% to 20%, suggested that further evaluation of classic adjuvant chemotherapy in this disease is warranted. Among studies in recurrent head and neck cancer, the most effective chemotherapy regimens appear to be variations of the program consisting of cisplatin followed by a 5-day infusion of 5-fluorouracil. Nevertheless, median survivals in recurrent disease remain short, generally 5 to 10 months. 
Recurrent classic migraine attacks following transdermal scopolamine intoxication. A 20 year old male naval crew-member suffering from sea sickness was treated with transdermal scopolamine (TS). After 5 months of continuous treatment, he developed scopolamine intoxication followed by the appearance of recurrent classic migraine attacks. He had never suffered from headache or migraine prior to TS intoxication. The migraine attacks comprised a prodrome of apathy, bad mood and loss of appetite lasting several hours. An aura of scintillating spots, left arm numbness and paresthesias lasting several minutes was followed by a severe throbbing unilateral headache with photophobia, sonophobia and nausea. After one year of repeated follow-up examination, he continued to suffer from the attacks once every 10 to 14 days, with no identified precipitating factors. We are not aware of similar cases in the medical literature. Although it is not possible to establish TS intoxication as a causal effect of the appearance of classic migraine in our patient, the temporal association and clinical course are very supportive of this assumption. Central nervous system neurotransmitter imbalance of cardiovascular alterations may possibly be implicated. 
Effect of destruction of the vascular endothelium upon pressure/flow relations and endothelium-dependent vasodilatation in resistance beds of spontaneously hypertensive rats. 1. Pressure/flow relationships were determined in the in situ blood-perfused superior mesenteric and hindquarters vascular beds of spontaneously hypertensive rats and Wistar-Kyoto normotensive rats before and after destruction of the endothelium with detergent. The effects of indomethacin on the regression of pressure on flow were also investigated in the spontaneously hypertensive rats, as were the endothelium-dependent relaxations in response to carbachol in the mesenteric bed. 2. In the spontaneously hypertensive rats the regression line of pressure on flow in the two vascular beds was both steeper and more elevated than in the Wistar-Kyoto rats, showing that there was greater resistance to flow in the hypertensive animals. Destruction of the endothelium significantly increased the slope of the regression in both Wistar-Kyoto and spontaneously hypertensive rats: the increases in the Wistar-Kyoto rats were 2.4 +/- 0.3 fold (mesenteric) and 2.0 +/- 0.5 fold (hindquarters) which were comparable with the respective increases of 1.6 +/- 0.3 fold and 1.8 +/- 0.3 fold in the spontaneously hypertensive rats. 3. Indomethacin (5 mg/kg, intravenously) had no effect on the pressure/flow relations in either of the vascular beds of the spontaneously hypertensive rats. 4. The dose-response curves for the endothelium-dependent vasodilatation in response to carbachol were not significantly different in spontaneously hypertensive and Wistar-Kyoto rats. 5. The results suggest that tonic release of endothelium-derived relaxing factor has similar effects in modulating resistance vessel tone in vivo in both hypertensive and normotensive rats. 
Ablepharon macrostomia syndrome. The association of congenital ablepharon with the absence of eyelashes and eyebrows, a wide mouth (macrostomia), and auricular, nasal, genital, and other systemic anomalies has been termed the ablepharon macrostomia syndrome. One such case is reported which illustrates the importance of immediate postnatal ocular management to minimise severe visual loss. 
Drug treatment of hypertension in patients with diabetes mellitus. Patients with diabetes mellitus have an increased prevalence of hypertension and its vascular consequences, including coronary and cerebrovascular disease. Drug treatment of hypertension in diabetic subjects is fraught with potential difficulties, including the altered efficacy of medications, the increased risk of side effects, and the possibility of worsening glycemic control and increasing serum lipid levels. Despite these difficulties, treatment is an important part of reducing morbidity and mortality from vascular events. Antihypertensive therapy may also have the potential to prevent or retard the development of diabetic nephropathy. In this article, we discuss the efficacy and metabolic and nonmetabolic side effects of the various classes of antihypertensive agents in patients with diabetes mellitus and suggest a stepped-care approach to the drug treatment of patients with hypertension and diabetes. 
Effect of radiation on the expression of carcinoembryonic antigen of human gastric adenocarcinoma cells. The changes of antigenic expression of cultured human gastric adenocarcinoma MKN45 cells caused by irradiation were investigated to elucidate the immune responses to localized irradiation. The expression of carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) showed remarkable increases in the culture supernatant and on the surface of the membrane of irradiated cells. The expression of major histocompatibility complex Class I antigen on the membrane also was enhanced by irradiation. In addition, the irradiated cell groups, when analyzed using a CEA-specific probe, showed remarkable increases in the CEA mRNA. These enhancements increased in the 10-Gy and 15-Gy irradiated populations compared with the 5-Gy irradiated population. These results suggest that the enhancement of expression of CEA by radiation takes place at the CEA gene expression (mRNA) level but not at the protein level. 
Jejunal permeability to water and electrolytes in patients with chronic intrahepatic hypertension: evidence for a role of aldosterone. Acute prehepatic portal hypertension induces intestinal secretion in animal models. In the course of chronic liver disease, however, these changes are not observed, despite higher portal pressures than those found in experimental studies. Eight patients without diarrhoea and with chronic alcoholic liver disease were examined for evidence of increased jejunal secretion; their suprahepatic wedge pressure was raised from 21 to 45 mmHg (mean 34.6 mmHg). Jejunal perfusion with a triple lumen catheter and a proximal occluding balloon was used to study net flows of water and chloride as well as net and unidirectional flows of sodium and potassium. No statistical difference in intestinal flows of water and electrolytes was noted between cirrhotic patients and control subjects after infusion with a 30 mmol/l glucose solution. Infusion with a 30 mmol/l mannitol solution resulted in a lower absorption of water, Na, K, and Cl than with the glucose solution. A higher rate of Na secretion was observed in cirrhotic patients than control subjects after infusion with 30 mmol/l mannitol (p less than 0.01). In addition, the rate of Na secretion was higher in cirrhotic patients than in control subjects (p less than 0.05). There was no correlation between the net flow of Na and the suprahepatic wedge pressure. A second perfusion with a 30 mmol/l glucose solution was given 75 minutes after a bolus injection of spironolactone (400 mg). Net flows of Na and Cl were lower in cirrhotic patients than in control subjects (p less than 0.05) because of a lower absorption of Na. Patients with gradually developing portal hypertension have moderate jejunal secretions of H2O and electrolytes which we assume are partly masked by increased absorption resulting from hyperaldosteronism. In contrast to animal models, this mechanism may be part of the jejunal adaptation to permeability in acute portal hypertension. 
Clinical significance of the large adrenal mass. Current clinical teaching indicates that large (greater than 5 cm in diameter) adrenal masses are often malignant. In a retrospective analysis of patients studied between 1977 and 1988 with computed tomography (CT), adrenal scintigraphy, and when available, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) 45 were found to have adrenal masses greater than 5 cm (range 5-19 cm) in diameter. Thirty were benign (16 phaeochromocytomas, six adrenocortical adenomas, four adrenal cysts, two myelolipomas, an adrenal hematoma and a ganglioneuroma). Of 15 malignant masses, there were seven adrenocortical carcinomas, five adrenal metastases and three adrenal lymphomas. With the exception of the adrenal myelolipomas, cysts, and the ganglioneuroma neither CT nor MRI demonstrated sufficient diagnostic specificity to distinguish benign from malignant lesions. Functional scintigraphy with 131I-6-beta-iodomethyl-19-norcholesterol for suspected adrenocortical lesions and 131I-metaiodobenzylguanidine for suspected phaeochromocytomas frequently provided useful information.
