Recurrent spinal cord tethering by sacral nerve root following lipomyelomeningocele surgery. Case report. A 21-year-old woman had recurrent progressive weakness/hypesthesia and pain in both lower extremities. At the age of 5 and 19 years, she had undergone surgical resection of a lipomyelomeningocele at L5-S1. Surgical exploration revealed that the cord was tethered and pulled over to the side by an excessively short right S-1 nerve root. The contralateral L-5 and S-1 nerve roots were markedly stretched. Division of the right S-1 nerve root resulted in prompt disappearance of pain in the lower extremities and improvement in neurological function. 
Let sleeping dogs lie: role of the omentum in the ileal pouch-anal anastomosis procedure. A surgical aphorism has long held that the omentum is the "watchdog of the abdomen." However, detractors believe that leaving the omentum behind after colectomy precipitates later small bowel obstruction. A retrospective comparison was made between a group of 406 patients (Group I) having omentectomy with proctocolectomy and ileoanal anastomosis and a group of 239 patients (Group II) having a similar procedure without omentectomy. Follow-up in this series of 645 patients was 4.3 +/- 2.1 years (mean +/- SEM). No difference was present in the rate of partial small bowel obstruction or complete small bowel obstruction between Group I patients (32 percent partial, 12 percent complete) and Group II patients (29 percent partial, 12 percent complete; P greater than 0.1). However, a better outcome with regard to postoperative sepsis and sepsis requiring operation was apparent in Group II patients retaining the omentum (4 percent and 3 percent, respectively) than in Group I patients (10 percent and 8 percent, respectively), in whom the omentum was removed (P less than 0.01). As this experience would support, we urge surgeons to "let sleeping dogs lie" and, when possible, retain the omentum when performing colectomy or proctocolectomy. 
Cancer incidence following subtotal gastrectomy. Hawaiian Japanese men (n = 432) who had undergone subtotal gastrectomy for peptic ulcers before 1971-1975 were followed up for detection of cancer development. They showed a significant increase in colon cancer risk (P = 0.008) and lung cancer risk (P = 0.002) compared with 6161 nongastrectomized men. The association with lung cancer persisted after adjustment for cigarette use (P = 0.03). Alcohol consumption was associated with colonic cancer in this cohort, and gastrectomized men consumed more alcohol than nongastrectomized men; however, the association of gastrectomy with colon cancer persisted after adjustment for alcohol use (P = 0.02). Gastrectomized men were lighter and had lower serum lipid levels than controls, suggesting that undernutrition might favor the development of some cancers. The type of gastroenteric anastomosis did not influence the cancer risk level in the colon or lung. 
Reasons for the lack of benefit of immediate angioplasty during recombinant tissue plasminogen activator therapy for acute myocardial infarction: a regional wall motion analysis. European Cooperative Study Group. Regional ventricular wall motion analysis utilizing three different methods was performed on predischarge left ventriculograms from 291 of 367 patients enrolled in a randomized trial of single chain recombinant tissue-type plasminogen activator (rt-PA), aspirin and heparin with and without immediate angioplasty in patients with acute myocardial infarction. With univariate analysis, no difference in regional wall motion variables between the two treatment groups was observed. However, with individual baseline risk assessment by multivariate linear regression analysis using baseline characteristics known to be related to left ventricular function after thrombolytic therapy or outcome of coronary angioplasty, or both, an excess of high risk patients in the invasive treatment group was detected. To adjust for this unequal distribution of baseline risk, multivariate linear regression analysis was performed. No benefit of immediate coronary angioplasty was observed after adjustment. Reocclusion or reinfarction, or both, occurred more frequently in the invasive than in the noninvasive treatment group (18% versus 13%, respectively). Among patients with a patent infarct-related vessel on angiography between days 10 and 22 and without reinfarction before angiography, there was a trend toward benefit from the invasive strategy, indicating that reocclusion and reinfarction might be responsible for the lack of benefit of the invasive strategy. This implies that immediate coronary angioplasty may be beneficial in selected patients, provided that these complications can be prevented. 
Percutaneous ethanol injection therapy of hepatocellular carcinoma: analysis of 77 patients. Although sonographically guided percutaneous ethanol injection therapy has been attracting a great deal of attention in the treatment of liver neoplasms, few reports regarding long-term results of this therapy have been published. We report here our 4-year experience, in which ethanol injection was performed 419 times on 108 lesions in 77 patients with hepatocellular carcinoma. Histopathologic examination performed in 14 cases after the therapy revealed that the lesion was completely necrotic in 10 cases, 90% necrotic in three cases, and 70% necrotic in the remaining case. Angiography performed after the therapy showed complete disappearance of tumor stain in 37 of 42 cases treated with ethanol injection. CT after the therapy showed no enhancement of the treated lesion in 55 of 56 cases. Elevated serum levels of alpha-fetoprotein decreased in 21 of 24 cases. Ethanol injection improved the long-term prognosis of the patients. Among the 50 patients in whom there were three or fewer lesions and all lesions were treated by ethanol injection, the 1-, 2-, 3-, and 4-year survival rates were 89%, 74%, 68%, and 60%, respectively. Factors that significantly affected the prognosis were the goal of the treatment, liver function, and size of the largest lesion. Serious complications rarely occurred even in patients with severe liver dysfunction. Percutaneous ethanol injection therapy appears to be valuable for treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma. 
Effect of increasing degrees of ischemic injury on myocardial oxidative metabolism early after reperfusion in isolated rat hearts. The present investigation studied the effect of increasing severities of ischemic injury on recovery of oxidative metabolism after reperfusion in isolated rat hearts perfused retrogradely with erythrocyte-containing medium. Hearts subjected to 60 minutes of low-flow ischemia (5% of control perfusion) exhibited delayed but sustained recovery of left ventricular pressure development during reperfusion and preservation of ultrastructure delineated with electron microscopy. Immediately after reperfusion, myocardial oxygen consumption returned to control values, well before left ventricular pressure development recovered. Early after reperfusion release of 14CO2 from [1-14C]palmitate was reduced (-53%, p less than 0.01). Conversely, release of 14CO2 from [U-14C]glucose was increased (+131%, p less than 0.05). After 60 minutes of reperfusion 14CO2 release had completely returned to normal for both labeled substrates. Pulse-labeling experiments indicated that during transient depression of [1-14C]palmitate oxidation more tracer was incorporated into myocardial lipid esters, primarily triglycerides. In contrast to hearts subjected to low-flow ischemia, hearts subjected to 60 minutes of no-flow ischemia exhibited poor recovery of contractile function during the reperfusion period. Electron microscopic examination of reperfused hearts showed advanced myocyte damage consistent with irreversible injury. Interestingly, myocardial oxygen consumption in this group also recovered to control values. The substrate pattern during the early reperfusion period was similar to that of hearts subjected to low-flow ischemia. After 120 minutes of no-flow ischemia, recovery of oxidative metabolism was virtually absent. The results indicate a pronounced dissociation between recovery of oxidative metabolism and of contractile function in reperfused myocardium. The oxidative metabolic rate was disproportionately high compared with contractile function, not only in reversibly "stunned" hearts, but also in severely damaged hearts exhibiting signs of irreversible injury. 
Pituitary adenomas: automatic static perimetry and Goldmann perimetry. A comparative study of 345 visual field charts. In a series of 81 cases of pituitary adenoma 345 charts of visual field performed with static automatic perimetry (AP) on the Vision Monitor and Goldmann perimetry (GP) were compared. Generally both methods were equivalent in the detection of chiasmal compression. The charts were divided into two groups: (A) 208 charts and (B) 137 charts according to the number of isoptres investigated: two (V4, 112) or three (V4, 112, 12). In group A the AP was more often altered than the GP, and the difference was statistically significant (p less than 0.001). In group B the GP seemed more effective, but the number of questionable cases was greater and the difference was not statistically significant. When the most internal isoptre of GP was outside the central 30 degrees, AP was more often abnormal (29%) than GP (2.2%), and the difference was statistically significant (chi 2, p less than 0.001). Within the central 30 degrees the GP seemed more often to be altered (23% of cases) than the AP (19.4%), but one-third of the cases were questionable. Within the central 30 degrees both techniques gave identical results and there was no statistically significant difference. The discrepancies between both static and kinetic techniques are an argument for their complementary use. 
Primary soft tissue tumours of the pelvis causing referred pain in the leg. Referred pain in the leg is occasionally due to a pelvic soft tissue tumour. Among 11 patients who presented this way, one had a lymphoma, one had a benign schwannoma, and nine had soft tissue sarcomas. Most patients had undergone a variety of procedures, including laminectomy, before the correct diagnosis was established. In five cases, an accurate diagnosis was obtained by needle biopsy. The lymphoma responded to chemotherapy, and the benign schwannoma was excised. Of the nine patients with soft tissue sarcoma, six underwent marginal/intracapsular excision, three receiving supplementary radiotherapy, and two were treated by nonsurgical means. Hindquarter amputation was technically impossible or inappropriate in these cases. All those with high-grade tumours have died or have metastases. Of four patients with low-grade tumours, three have exhibited only slow disease progression. Careful judgment and a precise histopathological diagnosis are required in planning treatment for patients with pelvic soft tissue tumours causing referred pain in the leg. 
Urothelial leiomyomatous hamartoma of the kidney. A 34-year-old woman presented with a renal pelvic mass. A nephroureterectomy including a cuff of bladder, was performed and pathologic examination revealed a hamartoma involving the renal parenchyma and pelvis. The pelvic portion of the tumor was composed of papillae lined by urothelium; the parenchymal portion of the tumor was composed of tubules within a fibromuscular stroma. The authors propose that this is a distinct entity not previously described in the literature. 
Restoration of Na(+)-K+ pump activity and resting membrane potential by myo-inositol supplementation in neuroblastoma cells chronically exposed to glucose or galactose. myo-Inositol uptake by culture neuroblastoma cells at a concentration of myo-inositol less than 50 microM was largely Na+ dependent. Exposing neuroblastoma cells to media supplemented with increasing concentrations of myo-inositol resulted in an increase in myo-inositol accumulation and intracellular content, but myo-inositol incorporation into phospholipids was not increased. The data indicate that myo-inositol exists as separate pools in neuroblastoma cells, and one or more of these pools may contribute to phospholipid synthesis. Exposing neuroblastoma cells to an increased concentration of glucose caused a decrease in myo-inositol uptake by two separate mechanisms. Acute exposure of the cells to 30 mM glucose caused a myo-inositol concentration-dependent decrease in Na(+)-dependent myo-inositol uptake. We propose that the acute inhibition of myo-inositol uptake by glucose is likely due to a competitive type of inhibition. Chronic exposure of cells to media containing 30 mM glucose or 30 mM galactose also caused decreases in myo-inositol uptake and incorporation into inositol phospholipids and intracellular myo-inositol content. This decrease in myo-inositol metabolism persisted at a higher concentration of external myo-inositol than the acute inhibition. Supplementing media containing 30 mM glucose or 30 mM galactose with 250 microM myo-inositol restored myo-inositol metabolism and content. The inhibition of myo-inositol uptake by cells chronically exposed to increased concentrations of glucose or galactose was due to a noncompetitive type of inhibition that was blocked by the addition of sorbinil. Chronic exposure of neuroblastoma cells to media containing 30 mM glucose or 30 mM galactose caused a decrease in Na(+)-K(+)-ATPase transport activity and resting membrane potential. 
Maternal and fetal haemodynamics in hypertensive pregnancies during maternal treatment with intravenous hydralazine or labetalol. Intravenous treatment with 10 mg of hydralazine or 100 mg of labetalol was randomly allocated to 30 hypertensive pregnant women. Umbilical artery flow velocity waveforms were recorded using a pulsed Doppler duplex scanner (ATL Mk V) and umbilical artery pulsatility index (PI) and fetal heart rate (FHR) were derived from these recordings. Maternal blood pressure decreased significantly after both drugs. Maternal pulse rate increased after hydralazine but did not change significantly after labetalol. FHR did not change significantly after hydralazine but decreased after labetalol. PI decreased after hydralazine and increased after labetalol--most fetuses showed little change but a few in each group showed large changes in PI, as did two of five additional patients studied. We attributed the decrease in PI in some fetuses after hydralazine to vasodilation, and the increase in PI in some fetuses after labetalol to vasoconstriction in the fetoplacental circulation, suggesting that fetal beta-blockade may occur after maternal treatment with labetalol. 
Selective effects of acute and chronic ethanol exposure on neuropeptide and guanine nucleotide stimulated phospholipase C activity in intact N1E-115 neuroblastoma. The influence of acute and chronic ethanol exposures on the coupling of neurotensin and bradykinin receptors to phospholipase C was determined in intact N1E-115 cells. Phospholipase C was monitored by the formation of total [3H]inositol phosphates in the presence of lithium in cells prelabeled with [3H]inositol. Acute exposure to ethanol over a range of 50 to 200 mM inhibited the stimulation of [3H]inositol phosphate formation elicited by neurotensin and bradykinin. In cells chronically exposed to 100 mM ethanol for 7 days, neither basal- nor neurotensin-stimulated [3H]inositol phosphate formation differed significantly from those of control (untreated) cells. In contrast, the [3H]inositol response to bradykinin was significantly inhibited in cells chronically exposed to ethanol. Because chronic ethanol exposure had no parallel effects on either the specific binding of [3H]bradykinin or the stimulation of [3H]inositol phosphate formation by the stable GTP analog, guanine 5'-(y-thiotriphosphate), it is suggested that chronic ethanol impairs the ability of bradykinin receptors to activate the guanine nucleotide binding protein associated with phospholipase C. In addition, because chronic ethanol had no effect on the inositol phosphate response to neurotensin, it is proposed that certain types of receptor-guanine nucleotide binding protein interactions are more vulnerable than are others to disruption by chronic ethanol treatment. 
Identification of nuclear tau isoforms in human neuroblastoma cells. The tau proteins have been reported only in association with microtubules and with ribosomes in situ, in the normal central nervous system. In addition, tau has been shown to be an integral component of paired helical filaments, the principal constituent of the neurofibrillary tangles found in brains of patients with Alzheimer disease and of most aged individuals with Down syndrome (trisomy 21). We report here the localization of the well-characterized Tau-1 monoclonal antibody to the nucleolar organizer regions of the acrocentric chromosomes and to their interphase counterpart, the fibrillar component of the nucleolus, in human neuroblastoma cells. Similar localization to the nucleolar organizer regions was also observed in other human cell lines and in one monkey kidney cell line but was not seen in non-primate species. Immunochemically, we further demonstrate the existence of the entire tau molecule in the isolated nuclei of neuroblastoma cells. Nuclear tau proteins, like the tau proteins of the paired helical filaments, cannot be extracted in standard SDS-containing electrophoresis sample buffer but require pretreatment with formic acid prior to immunoblot analysis. This work indicates that tau may function in processes not directly associated with microtubules and that highly insoluble complexes of tau may also play a role in normal cellular physiology. 
Differentiation between somatic and cognitive/affective components in commonly used measurements of depression in patients with chronic low-back pain. Let's not mix apples and oranges. Patients with chronic low-back pain are frequently diagnosed as depressed. However, many of the neurovegetative signs of depression may also result from pain. The purpose of the present study was 1) to investigate the relationship between commonly used measurements of depression and pain perception; and 2) to examine the utility of differentiating between somatic signs and cognitive/affective symptoms of depression in patients with chronic low-back pain. The Beck Depression Inventory and the Hamilton Psychiatric Rating Scale for Depression were divided into cognitive/affective and somatic subscales. These measures, as well as the Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory, were administered to 111 patients with chronic low-back pain. Analyses revealed significant correlations between depression scores and self-reported pain intensity. The cognitive/affective subscale of the Beck Depression Inventory resulted in the only nonsignificant correlation with pain intensity. These findings suggest that commonly used measurements of depression are confounded with pain symptomatology and that the cognitive/affective category of the Beck Depression Inventory may prove to be a more accurate measurement of depression in patients with chronic low-back pain. 
Patient dose and risk in mammography. Patient dose in mammography is estimated by two different methods which are compared and which give good agreement. A mean tissue dose of about 1 mGy per film is found for a breast of 4.5 cm compressed thickness. Variables which affect dose are then considered quantitatively, including compressed breast thickness, tube potential, grids, magnification and beam collimation. The variables having the greatest effect are breast thickness and magnification. For example, an 8 cm breast receives about four times the mean tissue dose of a 3.5 cm breast. Similarly, using a magnification factor of about 2, dose is increased about four times in the primary beam, but the adverse consequences may be largely removed with conventional collimation to part of the breast only. Finally, the dose estimates are combined with existing data on breast cancer induction to predict the risk of carcinogenesis in a breast screening programme. For example, in a screening centre performing 15,000 examinations per year, only one induced cancer is predicted in about 7 years of screening under average UK conditions of age and breast thickness. 
Coronary heart disease: black-white differences. Important features of the racial patterns in CHD at the present time are summarized in Table 15-10. Many of these conclusions follow inevitably from the economic disadvantage suffered by blacks, and the overwhelming importance of hypertension in this population. More knowledge is needed regarding the value of standard diagnostic tools in distinguishing noncoronary from coronary chest pain symptoms. A hard look is also needed at questions of access for blacks, particularly to angioplasty and thrombolytic therapy. There is additional growing evidence that the gains against CHD have been concentrated primarily among the educated and affluent. New strategies will need to be developed if we are to repeat the kind of gains against cardiovascular disease among blacks in the 1990s that were made in the 1970s and 1980s. 
Chylothorax after oesophagectomy. Chylothorax is an uncommon complication of oesophagectomy. In a review of 537 oesophageal resections there were 11 cases of chylothorax, an incidence of 2.0 per cent. There was no correlation with site, size, penetration, lymph node status, length or type of tumour but there was a significant correlation between chylothorax and the type of operative procedure carried out. The incidence in 95 transhiatal resections was 10.5 per cent. The incidence following 442 transthoracic procedures was 0.2 per cent (P less than 0.001) with one chylous fistula occurring after a three-stage oesophagectomy. Initial management was conservative with chest drainage and total parenteral nutrition. Thoracotomy and duct ligation was subsequently carried out in three patients and was successful in two. The third patient died. Conservative management alone was successful in four out of eight patients, with closure of the fistula at a median of 35 days (range 14-42 days). Four patients treated conservatively died. Transhiatal oesophagectomy greatly increases the risk of chylothorax, a condition that carries a high mortality rate (46 per cent in this series) whether managed conservatively or by surgical intervention. 
Establishment and characterization of a new human leukemia cell line derived from M4E0. A new human leukemia cell line, designated as ME-1, was established from the peripheral blood leukemia cells of a patient with acute myelomonocytic leukemia with eosinophilia (M4E0). This cell line has the characteristic chromosome abnormality of M4E0, inv(16) (p13q22). When cultured in RPMI 1640 medium containing 10% fetal calf serum, ME-1 cells were monoblastoid, but with the addition of cytokines such as interleukin-3 (IL-3), granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF), IL-4, or medium conditioned by phytohemagglutinin-stimulated human peripheral leukocytes (PHA-LCM), the cells exhibited differentiation to macrophage-like cells. PHA-LCM also promoted eosinophilic-lineage differentiation of this cell line, although IL-5 did not do so. To elucidate the mechanism of proliferation and differentiation of ME-1 cells, we studied the effect of a potent inhibitor of protein kinase C, 1-(5-isoquinolinyl-sulfonyl)-2-methylpiperazine (H-7), on colony formation of ME-1 cells. H-7 inhibited colony formation of ME-1 cells by IL-3 or GM-CSF dose dependently, but had little inhibitory effect on colony formation by IL-4. These results indicate that the proliferation and differentiation of ME-1 cells by IL-3 or GM-CSF were related to the activation of protein kinase C, while those by IL-4 involved other regulatory systems. ME-1 cells should be useful for studying the pathogenesis of M4E0 and the mechanisms of proliferation and differentiation of leukemic and normal progenitors by cytokines. 
Phosphate metabolites and steroid hormone receptors of benign and malignant breast tumors. A Nuclear Magnetic Resonance study. Phosphorous 31 (31P) nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectra were recorded from perchloric acid extracts of benign and malignant breast tumors. The spectra were correlated with the histopathologic diagnosis and the steroid receptor status of the tumor. Higher relative content of the lipid-derived metabolite glycerolphosphoethanolamine (GPE), the high-energy nucleoside phosphates (nucleoside-diphosphate [NDP], nucleoside-triphosphate [NTP]), and sugar esters of uridine diphosphate (UDPS) appeared in the carcinomas. Malignant tumors also showed a lower ratio of phosphoethanolamine to phosphocholine (PE/PC) than benign conditions. Lower content of the lipid-derived metabolite glycerolphosphocholine (GPC) and high content of the high-energy compound phosphocreatine (PCr) were associated with malignant tumors having high content of estrogen receptors (ER). High PCr content was also associated in the carcinomas with high progesterone receptors (PgR) content. In the benign tumors NDP and NTP were higher in tumors with high PgR content. The authors suggest that 31P magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) of the breast can provide additional variables to diagnose malignancy, and when combined with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), invasive procedures may be avoided. It also seems that levels of PCr and GPC obtained from the spectra can serve as markers to hormonal receptor status of breast carcinomas, and may be used in addition to the ER and PgR content to improve prediction of the response to hormonal therapy. Additional development requires in situ MRI and MRS combined studies. 
Spontaneous regression of juvenile nasopharyngeal angiofibroma. This report describes the spontaneous regression of a biopsy-proved juvenile nasopharyngeal angiofibroma that was first diagnosed when the child was age 11 years. The patient was followed up over a 12-year period during which he did not receive any therapy. Total involution of this lesion can be demonstrated by serial computed tomographic studies. Our report supports the theory of hormonal influence on this group of tumors and the possibility of spontaneous involution. 
Conservative management of anal leiomyosarcoma. Leiomyosarcomas of the large intestine are unusual neoplasms, comprising less than 0.1% of all malignancies of the colon and rectum. Six cases of leiomyosarcoma of the anus have been reported. The optimal treatment for this neoplasm is not known. The standard surgical approach is abdominoperineal resection. The authors report the seventh case of this rare neoplasm and outline its treatment using local excision and iridium 192 brachytherapy in an attempt to preserve the anal sphincter. In selected patients, conservative surgery followed by radiation therapy may be an alternative to radical surgery, with the goals of local control of the disease and anal sphincter preservation. However, more experience is needed before this approach could be recommended routinely. 
Primary adenocarcinoma of bladder. Between April 1983 and December 1987, we have treated and followed 16 patients at the University of Southern California for adenocarcinoma of the bladder. In 10 patients, the cancer originated from a nonurachal source; all underwent radical cystectomy, bilateral pelvic lymph node dissection, and urinary diversion. The other 6 patients had an apparent urachal origin of their cancer. Half of these patients were treated with radical cystectomy and urinary diversion and half were treated initially with segmental cystectomy. Presenting characteristics (age, sex ratio, and symptoms) were similar for both groups. Three-year adjusted acturial tumor-free survival rates for the two groups were 48 percent and 31 percent, respectively. We advocate an aggressive approach of radical cystectomy, bilateral pelvic lymph node dissection, and urinary diversion for all invasive adenocarcinoma of the bladder, regardless of location. 
Migraine pain associated with middle cerebral artery dilatation: reversal by sumatriptan. The combination of measurements of regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) and blood velocity in the middle cerebral arteries (MCA) by transcranial doppler sonography was used to investigate cerebrovascular involvement in migraine. Ten migraine patients with unilateral headache were studied during an attack and when they had been free of attacks for 5 days (non-attack). On both occasions they were given as intravenous infusion of sumatriptan (2 mg), a 5-HT1-like receptor agonist, which relieved the symptoms within 30 min without affecting rCBF. The MCA velocity was normal on both sides on the non-attack day and on the unaffected side during the attack. However, during the attack the MCA velocity on the headache side was significantly lower than that on the non-headache side (45 vs 61 cm/s:mean difference 16.3 [95% confidence interval 10.3-22.3]; p = 0.02). The MCA velocity on the headache side returned to normal after treatment with sumatriptan and recovery. Since rCBF in the MCA supply territory was unaffected, the lower velocity can be explained only by dilatation of the MCA. The mean MCA diameter increase was estimated to be 20%. Thus, headache was associated with intracranial large arterial dilatation on the headache side. Sumatriptan predominantly had effects on the distended artery, which suggests that the 5-HT receptor system has a role in the pathogenesis of migraine. 
Treatment with intravenously administered gamma globulin of chronic relapsing colitis induced by Clostridium difficile toxin. We tested the hypothesis that children with chronic relapsing colitis induced by Clostridium difficile toxin have defective antibody responses to C. difficile toxins as a cause of their underlying illness. Six such children were tested for serum IgG and IgA antibody to C. difficile toxin A. These six children had lower IgG anti-toxin A levels than 24 healthy children (p = 0.026) and 18 healthy adults (p = 0.0008). Five patients treated with 400 mg intravenously administered gamma-globulin per kilogram every 3 weeks had significant increases in IgG (p = 0.01) but not IgA anti-toxin A (p = 0.406) levels, and all five had clinical resolution of their gastrointestinal symptoms as well as clearing of C. difficile cytotoxin B from their stools. These observations suggest that a deficiency of IgG anti-toxin A may predispose children to the development of chronic relapsing C. difficile-induced colitis. In such cases, intravenous gamma-globulin therapy may be effective in producing clinical remission. 
Bleeding peptic ulcer after abdominal aortic aneurysm surgery. A retrospective study of 112 patients with abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) and 232 with arteriosclerosis obliterans (ASO) demonstrated that 16.7% of those with AAA and 1.6% of those with ASO had a history of gastroduodenal ulcer; 83% of these lesions with AAA were gastric ulcers. Ulcer bleeding after vascular reconstruction developed in seven patients with AAA and one with ASO. Serum fibrinogen levels and platelet counts were significantly lower in patients with AAA than in those with ASO or controls. A prospective study showed that 25 (52.1%) of 48 patients with AAA and six (20.0%) of 30 patients with ASO had endoscopically proved gastroduodenal lesions before vascular reconstruction. None of them developed postoperative bleeding after treatment of both their gastroduodenal lesions and coagulopathy. Furthermore, the significant decrease in blood flow and prostaglandin content of gastric mucosa was demonstrated in patients with AAA. 
Recruitment of new osteoblasts and osteoclasts is the earliest critical event in the pathogenesis of human multiple myeloma. Considering the special relation of human multiple myeloma (MM) to bones, it is of importance to clarify the early steps of bone involvement in this disease. In this work, using bone histomorphometry (including histoenzymologic and kinetic studies for the first time), we have evaluated the bone remodeling (i.e., bone resorption and bone formation rates) of 16 individuals with early MM in comparison with that of 10 with benign monoclonal gammopathy (BMG) and that of 17 patients with previously untreated overt MM. A significantly increased osteoblastic recruitment was observed in the individuals with early MM when compared with those with BMG (P less than 0.01). A significant (P less than 0.01) increased bone resorption (i.e., eroded surfaces, osteoclast numbers and surfaces) was observed from the early stage of MM in comparison with the BMG status where bone resorption remained within the normal range. At the tissue level, there was no difference in terms of bone resorption between early and overt MM. On the other hand, osteoblast activity was significantly reduced in patients with overt MM (P less than 0.05 by comparison with those with early MM). A significant enhancement of osteoblastic recruitment with an increased generation of new osteoclasts is an early critical event in the pathogenesis of human MM. Of particular importance is the early stimulation of osteoblasts, since these cells produce high amounts of IL-6, a potent myeloma cell growth factor and a critical cytokine for the formation of osteoclasts in the bone marrow. 
Focal spared area in fatty liver simulating a mass. Scintigraphic evaluation. The characterization of focally spared areas in a fatty liver may at times be problematic. This report illustrates the unique diagnostic role that combined xenon-133/technetium-99m sulfur colloid scintigraphy can play in such cases. 
Focal nodular hyperplasia of the liver: results of treatment and options in management. Twenty two patients (19 females) with focal nodular hyperplasia were seen between 1973 and 1989. Five were children, and all the adults were aged under 42 years (median 33 years). Fourteen patients (64%) were symptomatic on presentation. Twelve of the 14 adult women had taken the oral contraceptive pill. Twelve patients, nine of whom were symptomatic, underwent hepatic resection shortly after presentation. There were no deaths or major complications, and all remain well on follow up. Four patients underwent either hepatic artery embolisation or ligation. After an interval of six to 10 years they were asymptomatic and only one has histological evidence of residual focal nodular hyperplasia. Of five patients initially treated conservatively, two were asymptomatic and have remained so for three and 13 years. One of the three symptomatic patients became symptom free after stopping the contraceptive pill. The management of focal nodular hyperplasia requires a flexible approach. Lesions which are asymptomatic can be observed with regular ultrasound and treated if they enlarge or become symptomatic. Symptomatic patients who present while taking the contraceptive pill can also have a trial of conservative treatment. Other symptomatic patients, including those who previously took the pill, are best treated by surgical resection, and, where this is not possible, by embolisation. 
Postoperative retention of urine: a prospective urodynamic study. OBJECTIVE--To investigate the cause of post-operative retention of urine in elderly men. DESIGN--Prospective study. SETTING--Northern General Hospital, Sheffield. PATIENTS--32 consecutive men (median age 73, range 55-85) referred to the urology department who were unable to pass urine either within 48 hours after operation and required catheterisation (23) or after removal of a catheter inserted at the initial operation (nine). INTERVENTION--Intermittent self catheterisation. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES--Urological investigation by medium fill and voiding cystometry within four weeks after operation, and minimum follow up three months thereafter. RESULTS--6 patients resumed normal voiding before urodynamic assessment, three proceeded straight to prostatectomy, and one was unfit for self catheterisation. Of 22 men who underwent urodynamic investigation, only five had bladder outflow obstruction, who subsequently had successful prostatectomy; 15 showed either a low pressure-low flow system (seven) or complete detrusor failure (eight) and two showed pelvic parasympathetic nerve damage. With intermittent self catheterisation spontaneous voiding returned in all but one man within a median of 8 weeks (range 6-32 weeks). Recovery of bladder function took significantly longer in men with detrusor failure than in those with an underactive bladder (median 10 weeks (range 6-32 weeks) v median 8 weeks (range 6-8 weeks); p = 0.05). Three months later all patients had re-established their own normal voiding pattern with minimal residual urine on ultrasonography and satisfactory flow rates. CONCLUSIONS--Postoperative urinary retention in elderly men is not an indication for prostatectomy; a normal pattern of micturition can be re-established by intermittent self catheterisation in most men. 
Are some antihypertensive therapies more efficacious than others in preventing complications and prolonging life? Antihypertensive therapy has been used for almost 35 years to reduce blood pressure and prevent morbidity and mortality related to the hypertensive state. Malignant, severe, and moderate hypertension have all been shown to be worthy of drug treatment, but controversy remains as to the degree of benefit that is achievable by treating milder hypertension. A variety of clinical trials have demonstrated that antihypertensive therapy reduces the incidence of stroke, congestive heart failure, and left ventricular hypertrophy and the progression in severity of hypertension. The benefits with respect to prevention of coronary heart disease (CHD) have been much less impressive. Thiazide diuretics have been the base therapy for the bulk of the hypertensive subjects studied to date who have not demonstrated reduced incidence of CHD. Therapy with beta-blockers has the potential for reducing CHD, but an analysis of four studies finds only two with positive results. On the other hand, since that study found reduced total mortality as well as CHD compared with thiazide diuretic, its findings cannot be ignored. Other questions deserving further investigation include how other antihypertensive therapies compare with respect to the risk reduction found with thiazide diuretics and beta-blockers, the optimal posttreatment blood pressure, whether persons with mild hypertension benefit from therapy, whether women should be treated differently, and whether atherosclerosis may be affected by specific antihypertensive therapies. 
Pheochromocytoma with pyrexia and marked inflammatory signs: a paraneoplastic syndrome with possible relation to interleukin-6 production. Pheochromocytoma can cause several paraneoplastic syndromes. We report a patient with pheochromocytoma who exhibited pyrexia and marked inflammatory signs along with an elevated serum interleukin-6 (IL-6) level. All of these abnormalities disappeared and serum IL-6 became undetectable by removal of the tumor. In addition, immunohistochemical analysis revealed the presence of IL-6 in the tumor cells. It is suggested that pyrexia and the elevation of acute phase proteins can be a paraneoplastic syndrome with pheochromocytoma, and that the elaboration of IL-6 from pheochromocytoma may play an important role in the development of the syndrome. 
Slow toxins, biologic markers, and long-latency neurodegenerative disease in the western Pacific region. The western Pacific parkinsonism-dementia and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis complex is a prototypical neurodegenerative disorder found among inhabitants of Guam, New Guinea (Irian Jaya, Indonesia) and Japan (Kii Peninsula, Honshu). Nonviral environmental factors peculiar to the affected populations seem to play a prominent etiologic role. Although cause-effect relationships cannot be established by epidemiologic studies alone, we have shown in all three affected population groups that individuals develop the amyotrophic lateral sclerosis variant of this disorder after heavy exposure to the raw or incompletely detoxified seed of neurotoxic cycad plants. Since long periods may elapse between cycad exposure and the appearance of neurological disease in humans, cycads may harbor a "slow toxin" that causes the postmitotic neuron to undergo slow irreversible degeneration. Two cycad neurotoxins are recognized, one of which (cycasin) is known to have long-latency effects (tumorigenesis) on mitotic neurons and replicating cells in other tissues. This paper explores the possible relationship between tumorigenesis and long-latency neurotoxicity, and discusses possible biologic markers of cycad exposure and subclinical neurodegenerative disease. 
Detection of the interferon-gamma-induced protein 10 in psoriasiform dermatitis of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome. Interferon-gamma-induced protein 10 is a 10-kd protein produced by human keratinocytes following an exposure to interferon gamma. Keratinocytes within psoriatic plaques and within delayed-type hypersensitivity reactions have been shown to stain strongly with an affinity-purified rabbit antibody prepared against interferon-gamma-induced protein 10, suggesting a possible role for interferon gamma in the production of the lesions. A psoriasiform eruption has been seen in patients with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS). Its severity appears to correlate with the degree of immunodeficiency in the early stages of AIDS. We stained 10 lesions of psoriasiform dermatitis of AIDS with the anti-interferon-gamma-induced protein 10 antibody using immunoperoxidase techniques. As controls, we studied 10 lesions of non-AIDS psoriasis, six lesions of seborrheic dermatitis with psoriasiform hyperplasia, one lesion of lichen simplex chronicus, and four biopsy specimens of normal skin from patients with AIDS. In addition, normal skin specimens taken from patients with AIDS and human immunodeficiency virus-negative patients at time of autopsy were examined. An identical, strong and diffuse staining pattern was seen in all cases of psoriasiform dermatitis of AIDS, non-AIDS psoriasis, seborrheic dermatitis, and lichen simplex chronicus. The specimens of normal skin showed only weak basal layer staining with anti-interferon-gamma-induced protein 10. Thus, the presence of interferon-gamma-induced protein 10 in keratinocytes was associated with psoriasiform hyperplasia and could be detected in both AIDS-associated and classic psoriasis. 
Acute pancreatitis and systemic lupus erythematosus: necropsy of a case and review of the pancreatic vascular lesions. The role of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) in the development of acute pancreatitis is a matter of controversy since, in many cases, this complication has been attributed to the drugs administered. In this study, we present a patient diagnosed as having SLE who developed acute pancreatitis with no apparent cause aside from her basic disease, and in whose necropsy was observed vascular damage consisting of severe intimal proliferation. Pancreatic vascular lesions in previously reported patients with lupus are reviewed. 
Effect of elevated plasma norepinephrine on electrocardiographic changes in subarachnoid hemorrhage. We compared electrocardiographic abnormalities and plasma norepinephrine concentrations in 40 patients with subarachnoid hemorrhage within the first 24 hours, at 72 hours, and after 1 week. In 20 patients with high plasma norepinephrine concentrations within the first 24 hours, sinus tachycardia (p less than 0.02) and negative T waves (p less than 0.01) were more frequent than in the 20 patients with normal plasma norepinephrine concentrations. After 72 hours, only sinus tachycardia (p less than 0.03) was found with increased frequency in the 26 patients with high plasma norepinephrine concentrations. Although 24 patients had high plasma norepinephrine concentrations after 1 week, we found no differences in the frequency of electrocardiographic abnormalities compared to patients with normal plasma norepinephrine. However, QTc prolongation, U waves, ST depression, and arrhythmias were found with similar frequency in patients with both high and normal plasma norepinephrine concentrations. We conclude that, with the exception of sinus tachycardia and negative T waves, electrocardiographic changes in patients with subarachnoid hemorrhage do not depend on elevated plasma norepinephrine concentrations. 
Diagnostic imaging in cancer care. The role of cost/benefit analysis. As the cost of medical care rises, there is increasing need to analyze the costs and benefits of diagnostic imaging. A review of previous research shows reasonable success at defining costs and the ability to identify safety and risk, but limited data on defining benefits in economic terms. The technology to analyze costs and benefits is improving, and satisfactory research protocols and methods have recently become generally accepted. While research studies to determine costs and benefits or efficacy are themselves costly, time consuming, and difficult to perform in clinical practice, the wise allocation of medical resources in the US requires physicians in all specialties to evaluate the technology when we are responsible for its use. 
Pyridostigmine used as a nerve agent pretreatment under wartime conditions. OBJECTIVE. To determine the adverse effects of pretreatment with pyridostigmine bromide for nerve agent exposure during wartime. DESIGN. A retrospective study. SETTING. Southwest Asia. PARTICIPANTS. Personnel who provided medical support to the XVIII Airborne Corps. These medical officers supplied information pertaining to symptoms and disposition of 41,650 soldiers who received pyridostigmine at the onset of hostilities of Operation Desert Storm. INTERVENTION. Pyridostigmine bromide, 30 mg orally, was self-administered every 8 hours while under the threat of nerve agent attack (for 1 to 7 days). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE. Physiologic changes attributable to pyridostigmine that resulted in need for medical attention, discontinuation of the drug, hospitalization, and/or evacuation from Southwest Asia. RESULTS. About half of the population noted physiologic changes that were not incapacitating, such as increased flatus, abdominal cramps, soft stools, and urinary urgency. Approximately 1% of the soldiers believed they had effects that warranted medical attention, but fewer than 0.1% had effects sufficient to discontinue the drug. Nonincapacitating symptoms often occurred; however, military mission performance was not impaired. CONCLUSION. While under the threat of nerve agent attack, pyridostigmine can be administered to virtually all soldiers. 
Success of temporomandibular joint arthroscopy in disk displacement with and without reduction. Forty-three subjects with disk displacement without reduction (DNR) or disk displacement with reduction (DWR) underwent arthroscopic lysis and lavage of the temporomandibular joints. Both groups of subjects were assessed by clinical examination, a questionnaire, and joint imaging, to determine the impact of internal derangement type (DWR vs DNR) on postsurgical outcome. There were no significant differences in postsurgical outcomes between the two groups of meniscal disorders with respect to clinical and questionnaire data. However, the DNR group generally exhibited a smoother, less erratic recovery. After surgery dramatic improvements were in range of motion, pain, and function in both groups, although some level of residual pain and dietary limitation remained in approximately half the subjects. The incidence of joint sounds and deviation were not improved by surgery. Significant differences were found between the two groups with respect to imaging results. Arthroscopy had little effect on the disk positions of DNR subjects: 84% were unchanged after surgery, and the remaining 16% were improved. The disk position of DWR subjects appeared more labile, with 31% unchanged, 38% worsened, and 31% improved. 
Fecal occult blood testing. Guidelines for follow-up after positive findings. Fecal occult blood testing should be performed under optimal conditions to minimize false-positive test results. Obvious bleeding from the rectum or other sources during the test period should be investigated and testing should be postponed. When a fecal occult blood test is positive, colonoscopy is recommended as the definitive method of diagnosis and often of treatment. When a complete colonoscopy cannot be performed, sigmoidoscopy with air-contrast barium enema is the next best alternative for direct visualization of the distal bowel and indirect investigation of the proximal colon. 
Diffuse pulmonary alveolar hemorrhage after bone marrow transplantation: radiographic findings in 39 patients. Diffuse alveolar hemorrhage is a life-threatening complication after bone marrow transplantation. We investigated the radiographic abnormalities that occurred in 39 transplantation patients with a diagnosis of diffuse alveolar hemorrhage and correlated the findings with the patients' clinical course. The initial radiographic abnormalities after diffuse alveolar hemorrhage developed an average of 11 days after bone marrow transplantation, and the radiographic abnormalities preceded the clinical diagnosis by an average of 3 days. Twenty-seven patients initially had bilateral radiographic abnormalities; 10 initially had unilateral abnormalities (seven in the right lung, three in the left lung). Two patients had normal chest radiographs throughout their clinical course. All 37 patients with radiographic abnormalities had abnormalities involving the central portion of the lung, primarily the middle and lower lung zones. The initial radiographic pattern was interstitial in 27 and alveolar in 10. In 24 patients, radiographic abnormalities were initially judged to be mild; three were severe from the onset. Radiographic abnormalities rapidly worsened in most patients over 6 days. In 30 patients, diffuse bilateral radiographic abnormalities involving all lung zones developed. Eleven patients persisted in having only interstitial radiographic abnormalities; 26 had a confluent alveolar pattern. At the height of radiographic abnormalities, 27 cases were judged to be severe, and only one case was judged to be mild. The mortality rate in patients with diffuse alveolar hemorrhage was 77%. The radiographic abnormalities of diffuse alveolar hemorrhage are nonspecific and usually precede the clinical diagnosis. The clinical course after hemorrhage is short, often resulting in death. 
Dissections of the cervicocerebral arteries. We present four cases of cerebral ischemia secondary to dissections of cervicocerebal arteries. The majority of patients presented with transient ischemic attacks and strokes, although one patient presented with headache and focal seizure. In addition to history and physical examination, the diagnostic evaluation of these patients included computed tomography scan, carotid duplex studies, angiogram, and, in some cases, magnetic resonance imaging studies. Initially, the patients were anticoagulated with heparin and then with warfarin for a period of six to eight weeks. The emergency physician must consider such dissections in younger patients with sudden neurologic deficits and no or few risk factors for cerebrovascular disease. In our experience, these are not rare syndromes; with proper workup, prompt diagnosis, and therapy, the prognosis is usually excellent. 
Midazolam use in the emergency department. Midazolam is a new imidazobenzodiazepine derivative that is two to three times as potent as diazepam, is water-soluble, has a rapid onset and short duration of action, and produces a profound amnestic effect. These properties make it an extremely useful drug for outpatient sedation. We performed retrospective review of midazolam use in a general emergency department over a one-year period. Midazolam was used in 120 patients, 71 men and 49 women, with an average age of 46 years. The average dose given was 3.4 mg, with a range of 1 to 10 mg. In 69 of the cases (57%) other drugs were administered, most commonly an opiate. There were only four adverse reactions. One patient developed urinary retention, one patient vomited, and two patients were somnolent for a prolonged period of time. There were no serious cardiovascular or respiratory problems. We conclude that midazolam is a safe drug to use in the emergency department. Close monitoring of the patient and the availability of airway support equipment are mandatory. 
Export of intracellular HBsAg in chronic hepatitis B virus infection is related to viral replication. Serum and liver HBsAg bear an inverse relation to each other during the evolution of chronic hepatitis B virus infection and the quantity of HBsAg in tissue rises gradually with time. In this study, intracellular and extracellular levels of HBsAg were measured by radioimmunoassay in primary culture of hepatocytes from 30 patients with chronic hepatitis B virus infection to determine a possible relationship with hepatitis B virus replication. Serum levels of HBsAg correlated with markers of active viral replication (serum hepatitis B virus DNA, p less than 0.005, and tissue HBcAg, p less than 0.02) but inversely with tissue HBsAg (p less than 0.05). In similar fashion, in vitro export of HBsAg was also related to the presence of active viral replication markers (serum hepatitis B virus DNA, p less than 0.02, and tissue HBcAg, p less than 0.05) and negatively with tissue HBsAg (p less than 0.001). Export of HBeAg also correlated positively with markers of active viral replication (serum hepatitis B virus DNA, p less than 0.05 and tissue HBcAg, p less than 0.05). Further experiments indicated that intrahepatic pre-S1 and pre-S2 correlated closely with intrahepatic HBsAg, indicating that a failure to export HBsAg was unlikely to be attributable to deficient intracellular expression of pre-S1 or pre-S2. These data indicate that in vitro primary hepatocyte culture of hepatitis B virus-infected cells provides an accurate reflection of in vivo export of HBsAg and that this is closely related to the presence of active viral replication. 
Beta-receptor sensitivity in autonomic failure. We examined the cardiovascular, plasma norepinephrine (NE), and plasma renin (PRA) responses to isoproterenol infusion in patients with autonomic failure and in normal subjects. Slopes of the blood pressure response/dose relationships were more negative in patients with multiple system atrophy and pure autonomic failure (PAF) than in normal subjects, consistent with impaired baroreflex modulation. A shift to the left in patients with PAF suggests beta-adrenergic receptor supersensitivity. In normal subjects, the increase in plasma NE and PRA was proportional to the log of the plasma isoproterenol level. Isoproterenol infusion did not increase plasma NE or PRA in either patient group despite a reduction in mean blood pressure. Reflexive cardiovascular and renal mechanisms appear to play a role in eliciting the plasma NE and PRA responses to isoproterenol infusion in normal subjects. 
Microalbuminuria in patients with essential hypertension. Effects of an angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor and of a calcium channel blocker. Several patients with essential hypertension manifest an abnormal (greater than 30 mg/24 h) urinary albumin excretion (UAE). Since microalbuminuria is considered an independent predictor of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality, studies are currently being undertaken to determine the effect of various antihypertensive agents on UAE, on the assumption that a reduction of UAE might result in improved prognosis in patients with essential hypertension. Twenty-four patients with essential hypertension were randomly divided into two groups of 12. The first group received 20 mg/day enalapril for 8 weeks, followed by 20 to 40 mg/day nitrendipine for 8 more weeks. The second group received nitrendipine for 8 weeks, followed by enalapril. Mean arterial pressure decreased similarly during both therapeutic regimens in the two groups of patients. In patients of group 1, UAE decreased significantly (P less than .01) from 74 +/- 7.0 to 33 +/- 5.8 mg/24 h after 8 weeks of treatment with enalapril; during the following 8 weeks of treatment with nitrendipine, UAE increased to 58 +/- 5.3 mg/24 h (P less than .02). In patients of group 2, UAE did not change during the first 8 weeks of therapy with nitrendipine despite a significant reduction in blood pressure; subsequently, after 8 weeks of therapy with enalapril, UAE decreased from 62 +/- 9.2 to 31 +/- 4.8 mg/24 h (P less than .01). This study demonstrates that enalapril but not nitrendipine may reduce UAE in patients with essential hypertension despite similar antihypertensive efficacy. The significance of microalbuminuria and the impact of the normalization of UAE on cardiovascular morbidity and mortality in patients with essential hypertension remains to be determined. 
Interaction of sodium and volume in fluid resuscitation after hemorrhage. Some measures of the efficacy of fluid resuscitation after hemorrhage are blood volume restitution (BVR) and attenuation of the neuroendocrine response. We compared the effectiveness of resuscitation with 0.9% NaCl and 3.0% NaCl in chronically prepared awake dogs after 30% hemorrhage. Each dog was bled on four occasions and resuscitated by four protocols: 1) full resuscitation (infusion to return and maintain mean arterial pressure (MAP) at control +/- 10 mm Hg) with 3.0% NaCl (HS); 2) full resuscitation with 0.9% NaCl (NS); 3) under-resuscitation with a volume of 0.9% NaCl equal to the subject's previous 3.0% NaCl requirement (SV); and 4) no fluid therapy (NR). Approximately three times more volume was needed to restore MAP with NS vs. HS, and thus the amount of Na administered was not different in these groups. Net volume balance was positive in the NS and SV groups but negative in the HS group due to marked saline diuresis. Net Na balance was positive in all three fluid-treated groups, but significantly higher in the HS group (p less than 0.01). MAP remained below baseline in the SV and NR groups (p less than 0.05). BVR exceeded 100% in NS and HS early in resuscitation, but BVR was not sustained in the HS group. Total plasma protein increased in all three fluid treated groups. Responses of all hormones were completely attenuated in the NS group. ACTH, cortisol, and AVP responses were promptly attenuated in the HS group, but remained greater than control. In the SV group, all hormone levels except renin returned to control values, but more slowly than the other groups. ACTH and cortisol correlated best with BVR; AVP, PRA, and aldosterone correlated with MAP restoration. In summary, resuscitation with either HS or NS can achieve similar MAP restoration. Hypertonic saline produces a more rapid increase in BVR and MAP, but the BVR improvement is transient. Resuscitation with HS incurs an intracellular water debt which is aggravated by a saline diuresis. Hormonal attenuation is linked either to BVR (ACTH, cortisol) or to MAP restoration (renin, AVP). Thus the optimal resuscitation regimen may consist of initial infusion of hypertonic saline followed by sufficient hypotonic solution to restore interstitial fluid volume and normal cellular hydration. 
Neurogenic sarcoma of the sinonasal tract. Five cases of a rare malignant sinonasal tumour of neurofibromatous nature are described. The term neurogenic sarcoma (or malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumour) is advocated instead of malignant schwannoma. The clinicopathological features of this tumour are described, and the different diagnosis are discussed. The necessity of using immunohistochemistry in the diagnosis of sinonasal tumours of fibromatous nature is emphasized. The clinical management consists of radical surgery and adjuvant radiotherapy. Clinically there seems to be a high-grade and a low-grade type of sinonasal neurogenic sarcoma, however, this could not be distinguished histologically in the present series. 
Dowling-Degos disease, hidradenitis suppurativa, and multiple keratoacanthomas. A disorder that may be caused by a single underlying defect in pilosebaceous epithelial proliferation. We report a case in which one patient had Dowling-Degos disease (reticulate pigmented anomaly of the flexures), hidradenitis suppurativa, and multiple keratoacanthomas. Abnormal epithelial proliferation involving mainly the pilosebaceous apparatus has been recognized in all three conditions. We speculate that a single underlying defect in follicular epithelial proliferation, characterized by variable expressivity, accounts for the coexistence of these clinically distinct disorders of follicular derivation. 
Fractures of the penis: therapeutic approach and long-term results. Injury to the external male genitalia is considered, with attention focused on accidental fracture of the corpora cavernosa (by coitus or masturbation). Such injuries are often complicated by urethral lesions. We present 13 patients with either simple or complicated fracture of the penis, all of whom were operated on between 2 h and 8 days following injury, with excellent functional results. The need for immediate surgery is emphasised, in order to avoid erectile failure and curvature, which are typical complications of conservative treatment. Surgery consists of complete evacuation of haematoma, curettage and repair of the albuginea. If the fracture is associated with urethral disruption, the latter is also repaired. 
Acquired perforating dermatosis. Transepidermal elimination of DNA material and possible role of leukocytes in pathogenesis. A patient had acquired perforating dermatosis and suffered from renal disease, diabetes mellitus, and lupus vulgaris. Histologic and immunohistochemical studies revealed that the bulk of the coarse granular basophilic material being extruded by transepidermal elimination was of nuclear origin obviously derived from polymorphonuclear leukocytes that were particularly abundant in an early, nonperforated lesion. At the lower boundary of the material being eliminated transepidermally, leukocytes were seen to accumulate, to undergo pyknosis and karyorrhexis, and to transform into nuclear debris. As a minor component, the material contained collagen fibers with altered staining qualities and, in an early lesion, elastic fibers. We speculate that accumulation, disintegration, and enzyme release from polymorphonuclear leukocytes may represent an important, hitherto disregarded driving force in transepidermal elimination. Lysosomal enzymes may later be responsible for the alteration of staining properties in collagen fibers, the degradation of elastic fibers, and for opening up the transepidermal route by impairing intercellular keratinocyte cohesion. 
Heterogeneity in oxygen diffusion around venous ulcers. The pathogenesis of venous ulceration is thought to involve the formation of fibrin cuffs around dermal capillaries. Consistent with a barrier effect of fibrin, it has been shown that the dermal diffusion of oxygen, as measured by transcutaneous oxygen pressure (TcPO2), is decreased in limbs affected by venous ulcer. However, it is unknown whether oxygen diffusion around the perimeter of venous ulcers is uniformly affected. In this study, we investigated TcPO2 values at four different quadrants around the ulcers of 14 patients, the contralateral leg of five patients with unilateral ulcers, and the leg of six normal individuals. These values were also compared to TcPO2 measurements at the chest. Our results indicate that, whereas TcPO2 values in limbs affected by venous ulcers are much lower than normal, there is a great deal of variability in oxygen diffusion around individual ulcers. These findings may represent a heterogeneity in the disease process affecting the leg. 
Association between development of lower lip cancer and tobacco habits. Tobacco use is considered to increase the risk of tumor induction. The purpose of this case-controlled investigation was to assess the association of tobacco habits and development of squamous cell carcinoma of the lower lip. Sixty-one patients treated for lower lip cancer, aged between 42 and 90 years, were studied. Age- and sex-matched healthy controls showed a similar exposure to tobacco in years and a comparable distribution of tobacco habits. Although the mean exposure factor (duration times exposure) was greater in the tumor group, no intimate correlation between lip cancer and tobacco was demonstrated. However, an increased, although small, occurrence of herpes labialis lesions was found in cancer patients. The hypothesis is presented that smokers experiencing recurrent herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV-1) infections are more liable to tumor initiation, which issue will be subjected to a future study. 
A critical review of the evidence supporting a relationship between impaired fibrinolytic activity and venous thromboembolism. We critically evaluated the evidence for an association between venous thromboembolism and impaired fibrinolytic activity, as determined by global tests of fibrinolytic activity or specific tests for tissue plasminogen activator and plasminogen activator inhibitor. A computer-assisted and manual search was performed to retrieve all articles that reported on fibrinolytic activity and venous thromboembolism. The strength of the evidence for an association was assessed by analysis of the design of individual studies with special attention directed to choice of controls and methods of diagnosis of venous thromboembolism. It is concluded that for patients with symptomatic thrombosis the published evidence does not prove an association between impaired fibrinolytic activity and increased risk of thrombosis. In contrast, for postoperative thrombosis there is good evidence for an association between impaired fibrinolytic activity measured either preoperatively or postoperatively and increased risk of postoperative thrombosis. Whether this association is causal or coincidental is unclear, since randomized clinical trials that used interventions to enhance fibrinolytic activity produced inconsistent results. 
Comparison of computerized tomography and magnetic resonance imaging for the postoperative assessment of residual acoustic tumor. Ten patients with surgically confirmed residual cerebellopontine angle neuromas, imaged by both computerized tomography (CT) with iodine contrast and magnetic resonance (MR) with and without gadolinium enhancement, are reviewed to identify the strengths and limitations of MR as compared with CT imaging. MR imaging offers superior anatomic resolution in multiple imaging planes without ionizing radiation, but it is expensive and has adverse effects on some patients. CT imaging offers good anatomic resolution, but in only one or two planes. CT is both less expensive and generally well tolerated, but allergy to the iodine contrast is not uncommon. The cases presented demonstrate the adequacy of CT imaging of residual tumor. However, in some cases MR imaging provided important additional detail. MR imaging also demonstrated postoperative changes within the brain stem and cerebellum. In our experience, CT imaging remains a satisfactory, unambiguous approach to the assessment of known postoperative residual cerebellopontine angle neuromas. MR imaging provides superior resolution, however, and should be used when better definition of tumor detail is needed for management decisions or when multiple follow-up scans are anticipated, so that the exposure to ionizing radiation is limited. MR is also useful to investigate postoperative neurologic dysfunction. Postoperative changes and residual tumors are more difficult to interpret on MR than on CT. Guidelines are proposed to help distinguish residual tumor from postoperative changes and scarring. 
Elevation of serum interleukin-6 concentration precedes acute-phase response and reflects severity in acute pancreatitis. Experimental studies have shown that interleukin-6 induces all major acute-phase proteins in the liver, including C-reactive protein. In 50 patients with acute pancreatitis, the serum concentrations of interleukin-6 and C-reactive protein were determined daily during the first week of hospitalization. Patients were divided into three groups according to clinical criteria: mild pancreatitis (less than or equal to 1 complication; n = 25), severe pancreatitis (greater than or equal to 2 complications; n = 15), and lethal outcome (n = 10). Patients with mild disease showed initially slightly elevated levels of interleukin-6 (22.0 +/- 9.8 U/mL) that decreased to low levels within 4 days (5.0 +/- 1.0 U/mL). In patients with severe pancreatitis, serum concentrations of interleukin-6 were initially clearly elevated (35.0 +/- 7.5 U/mL) and remained slightly elevated until day 7 (13.0 +/- 2.0 U/mL). Patients with lethal outcome had markedly elevated initial interleukin-6 concentrations (61.0 +/- 15.0 U/mL) that decreased but were still elevated at day 7 (26.0 +/- 2.5 U/mL). In all three groups, C-reactive protein concentrations followed the course of interleukin-6 concentrations by 1 day. There was a positive correlation between maximal interleukin 6 concentrations and maximal increases in the serum concentrations of C-reactive protein (r = 0.66). At days 1 and 2, increased (greater than 15 U/mL) interleukin-6 concentrations (positive predictive value, 91%; negative predictive value, 82%) predicted a severe or lethal course of the disease more accurately than elevated [greater than 0.10 g/L (greater than 10 mg/dL)] C-reactive protein concentrations (positive predictive value, 67%; negative predictive value, 79%). In conclusion, elevated serum concentrations of interleukin-6 followed by increased levels of C-reactive protein reflect the severity of acute pancreatitis. 
The high risk of death by alcohol related diseases in subjects diagnosed as diabetic and impaired glucose tolerant: the Paris Prospective Study after 15 years of follow-up. The 15 year mortality rates and causes of death are reported for the Paris Prospective Study cohort of 7180 working men, aged between 44 and 55 years who attended the first follow-up examination. All subjects were classified as normoglycaemic, impaired glucose tolerant or diabetic according to the WHO criteria, following an oral glucose tolerance test. The relative risks of death in comparison to the normoglycaemic group were 1.6 for impaired glucose tolerant and 2.3 for diabetic subjects; for death due to coronary heart disease: 1.7 and 2.3 respectively; for death due to alcohol and cirrhosis: 7.0 and 13.3 respectively. It appears that in this cohort a proportion of subjects screened as diabetic have impaired liver function and disturbed carbohydrate metabolism, due to excessive alcohol consumption. Alcohol should be investigated as a possible risk factor for diabetes, particularly in epidemiological studies where diabetes is diagnosed by the oral glucose tolerance test and the population has a high consumption of alcohol. 
Prevalence of liver disease in cystic fibrosis. To assess the prevalence, demography, and clinical features of liver disease among patients with cystic fibrosis the case notes of 524 patients of all ages who were attending the cystic fibrosis clinic were studied. Computer databases were used to establish the condition of the liver in a further 576 such patients. The overall prevalence of overt liver disease indicated by the presence of an enlarged liver or spleen (or both) was 4.2%. The age related prevalence rose to a peak in adolescence, and then fell in patients over 20 years old. The implied increase in mortality among those with liver disease was not explained by deaths from liver disease, which were rare. Male patients were significantly more affected than female, the ratio being 3:1 among adolescents. Increasing prevalence of liver disease in patients with cystic fibrosis is, therefore, not just a result of longevity. 
Flow cytometric analysis of nuclear DNA content in advanced gastric cancer and its relationship with prognosis. Cell nuclear DNA content was determined by flow cytometric analysis in 270 patients with deeply infiltrating (beyond the submucosa) cancer, so-called advanced gastric cancer. Aneuploidy was observed in 150 cases (55.6%). Multivariate analysis showed that the DNA ploidy pattern was the third significant prognostic factor behind peritoneal dissemination and liver metastasis. The 5-year survival rate of diploid patients (62.9%) was significantly higher than that of aneuploid patients (22.7%) (P less than 0.01). This trend was most clear in patients with Stage III and IV tumors. Among aneuploid cases the high DNA index group indicated a worse prognosis than the low DNA index group. It was thus assumed that the DNA ploidy pattern was a useful prognostic indicator of advanced gastric cancer. 
Endometrial carcinoma in the cancer family syndrome. The study group consisted of 26 women with endometrial adenocarcinoma belonging to 19 cancer families. Age at the onset of cancer, the stage and histologic differentiation of the tumor, initial symptoms, other malignancies, 5-year survival, and transmission of cancer to descendants were studied. The focus was on the importance of endometrial carcinoma in the tumor spectrum. The diagnosis of cancer family was delayed in 14 of the 19 families because endometrial carcinoma was not included in the primary diagnostic carcinoma. This delay may have been harmful to 16 family members who had carcinomas later in life. In ten of the 14 women with multiple malignancies, endometrial adenocarcinoma was the primary malignancy diagnosed, thus enabling the suspicion of a gene carrier and screening for subsequent malignancies. The authors concluded that endometrial carcinoma is a significant component of cancer family syndrome and should be included in the main criteria of Lynch syndrome II. 
Simultaneous occurrence of cutaneous T cell lymphoma and low-grade B cell lymphoproliferative diseases. A report of two cases. Two previously unreported patients with cutaneous T cell lymphoma associated with systemic low-grade B cell proliferations are presented. The first patient had Waldenstrom's macroglobulinemia and the second had simultaneous chronic lymphocytic leukemia. The use of immunosuppressive drugs or a genetic predisposition may have contributed to the second malignancy. However, the possibility that malignant helper/inducer T lymphocytes were a factor in the promotion of the proliferation of B cells cannot be excluded. 
Placental examination in a clinical setting. Placental examination has been proved to be of clinical value in cases selected because of gestational complications, unusual disorders of mother or infant, perinatal death, problems in perinatal diagnosis, and multiple pregnancy. Ten percent to 15% of births meet these criteria for selection. Causes of perinatal death, such as placental abruption, cord accidents, placental infarction, infection, and hematologic disorders, have been demonstrated. Clinically occult abnormalities, including chronic infections, maternal vascular disease, neoplasms, and storage diseases, have been recognized. Amniotic lesions and single umbilical artery have directed attention to fetal malformations. Monozygosity has been documented by monochorionic placentation. As a diagnostic source, the placenta has contributed to clinical care, understanding of disabilities among surviving children, and insight of forensic value. Limitations of placental studies stem from their qualitative nature and from gaps in current knowledge of gestational pathophysiology. 
Monomelic amyotrophy in siblings. Monomelic amyotrophy is a rare, benign motor neuron disorder. Electrophysiologic studies are suggestive of localized chronic anterior horn cell disease. Two young siblings are reported with monomelic amyotrophy who had proximal muscle weakness confined to one arm. We propose that monomelic amyotrophy, at least in this family, is inherited as an autosomal recessive trait. 
Right- and left-arm blood pressure discrepancies in vascular surgery patients. To identify a relationship between atherosclerotic vascular disease and differences in blood pressure between the right and left arms, blood pressure differences between arms were measured in patients with peripheral vascular disease (PVD, n = 58), in patients with coronary artery disease (CAD, n = 38), and in patients with no evidence of atherosclerotic disease, who served as a control group (n = 38). The incidence and magnitude of right and left arm pressure difference determined by the oscillometric technique were compared between the patient groups. The incidence of systolic pressure difference greater than or equal to 20 mmHg between arms in patients with PVD (21%) was greater than that in either those with CAD (3%) (P less than or equal to 0.05) or control subjects (0%) (P less than 0.01). The incidence of systolic pressure difference greater than or equal to 45 mmHg between arms in patients with PVD (10%) was greater than that in either those with CAD (0%) (P less than 0.05) or control subjects (0%) (P less than 0.05). Patients with PVD also had a greater incidence of right and left arm difference than did those with CAD or controls for mean and diastolic blood pressures. Of all patients with a systolic difference greater than 10 mmHg, neither the right nor the left arm blood pressure was consistently higher: 21 of 35 (60%) had a higher pressure in the right arm, and 14 of 35 (40%) had a higher pressure in the left arm (P = 0.33). Gender, diabetes, hypertension, smoking, and age were not associated with a difference in blood pressure between the right and left arms. 
The origin of symptoms on the brain-gut axis in functional dyspepsia. It was hypothesized that symptoms in functional dyspepsia are originated by an altered mechanism at the brain-gut axis (one or several) in the process of gastric accommodation to a meal. To test the key mechanisms potentially involved in symptomatic gastric accommodation, the sensorial responses (on a 0-10 perception score) and the gastric tone responses (by electronic barostat) to either gastric accommodation (n = 10) or to cold stress (n = 10) were measured in 20 patients with functional dyspepsia and 20 healthy controls. The mechanical accommodation of the stomach to gastric distention (compliance) was similar in patients (52 +/- 8 mL/mm Hg) and controls (57 +/- 6 mL/mm Hg). However, isobaric gastric distention elicited more upper abdominal discomfort in dyspeptics than in controls (perception scores, 4.7 +/- 0.9 vs. 1.1 +/- 0.5, respectively; mean +/- SE; P less than 0.005). Cold stress induced a similar gastric relaxatory response in dyspeptics and controls (delta vol, 145 mL +/- 40 mL vs. 141 mL +/- 42 mL, respectively); hand perception (scores, 8.3 +/- 0.4 vs. 7.9 +/- 0.4, respectively) and autonomic responses were also similar. It is concluded that an abnormal afferent sensorial pathway (altered gastric perception) may be a major mechanism of symptom production in functional dyspepsia. 
Pretranslational regulation of albumin synthesis in tumor-bearing mice. The role of anorexia and undernutrition. Hepatic albumin synthesis, serum albumin turnover, and hepatic albumin messenger RNA (mRNA) content were evaluated in mice bearing a transplantable low differentiated tumor (MCG 101). Results obtained on tumor-bearing mice were compared with results obtained from non-tumor-bearing animals that were either freely fed, food restricted so that their body composition was similar to tumor-bearing animals (pair-weighed), fed a protein-free diet for 5 days, or fasted for 48 hours. Tumor-bearing animals became hypoalbuminemic (33 +/- 5 vs. 44 +/- 3 g/L in freely fed mice), which could be explained by both depressed albumin synthesis (1.95% +/- 0.20% vs. 2.67% +/- 0.27%/h in freely fed mice) and increased albumin degradation. Pair-weighed and protein-calorie malnourished controls had reductions in albumin synthesis (1.81% +/- 0.18% and 1.67% +/- 0.17%/h, respectively) similar to tumor-bearing animals, and the starved controls had the lowest synthetic rates (1.07% +/- 0.10%/h). Albumin degradation was increased only in tumor-bearing animals. Hepatic albumin mRNA in undernourished animals was less (tumor bearing, 32% +/- 5%; pair weighed, 47% +/- 4%; 48 hours fasted, 18% +/- 2%; and protein-calorie malnourished, 26% +/- 3%) than 50% of the mRNA content in the livers of freely fed control mice. Messenger RNA-directed synthesis of albumin in vitro was also depressed to a variable degree in tumor-bearing and malnourished non-tumor-bearing controls. The hypoalbuminemia in tumor-bearing animals could not be prevented by daily injections of a prostaglandin synthesis inhibitor (indomethacin, 1 microgram/g body wt), but the hepatic acute phase protein serum amyloid P decreased from 157 +/- 12 to 103 +/- 9 micrograms/mL in indomethacin-treated tumor-bearing mice (P less than 0.01). It is concluded that increased albumin degradation seen in tumor-bearing animals cannot be explained by associated malnutrition, whereas tumor-associated malnutrition can explain to a large extent the depressed albumin synthesis. Decreased albumin synthesis in tumor-bearing animals correlated in part with a decreased quantity of liver albumin mRNA. The results of the current study are consistent with either a reduced transcription of the albumin gene or a change in albumin mRNA processing and stability communicated by anorexia and malnutrition. 
Misdiagnosed papillary renal adenocarcinoma. We present 3 patients with papillary renal adenocarcinoma who were initially misdiagnosed owing to unusual clinical presentation. We suggest that if these presentations are borne in mind, pre-operative detection of this uncommon condition should be possible more often than is now the case. 
In vivo footprinting of MHC class II genes: bare promoters in the bare lymphocyte syndrome. Major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II genes are coordinately regulated and show tissue-specific expression. With the use of in vivo footprinting, common promoter sites in these genes were found to be occupied only in cells that expressed the genes, in spite of the presence of the promoter binding proteins. In vivo analysis of mutant cell lines that exhibited coordinate loss of class II MHC expression, including several from individuals with bare lymphocyte syndrome, revealed two in vivo phenotypes. One suggests a defect in gene activation, whereas the other suggests a defect in promoter accessibility. 
Neurenteric cyst located dorsal to the cervical spine: case report. A patient with a neurenteric cyst located dorsal to the cervical spine and associated with occult cervical spinal dysraphism is described. The embryological theories that might explain the occurrence of such a lesion are discussed. 
Prevention of irradiation-induced bowel discomfort by sucralfate: a double-blind, placebo-controlled study when treating localized pelvic cancer. Sucralfate, an aluminum hydroxide complex of sulfated sucrose used in the treatment of gastric ulcer, was shown to prevent irradiation-induced diarrhea and bowel discomfort significantly in patients treated for pelvic cancer with external radiotherapy with intent to cure. The double-blind placebo-controlled study included 70 patients with carcinoma of the prostate and urinary bladder without distant metastasis (T1-4NO1xMO) and performance status of greater than or equal to 90% Karnofsky scale. Radiotherapy was administered in a conventional manner with MeV photons and a four-field technique. The total dose was 62-66 Gy and total treatment time of 6.5 weeks. Dose granules of sucralfate or placebo were dispensed to each patient 2 weeks after radiation started and continued for 6 weeks. All analyses were performed blindly. Seven of 34 evaluable patients in the placebo group and 18 of 32 evaluable patients in the sucralfate group did not present with diarrhea during the observation period. The frequency of defecation and stool consistency were significantly improved by sucralfate. Fourteen patients in the placebo group and only three in the sucralfate group required symptomatic therapy with loperamide. There was no evidence of adverse effects associated with the use of sucralfate. Sucralfate can be of beneficial value in diminishing the bowel discomfort during radiotherapy of pelvic malignancies, and the earlier proposed mechanisms of action (e.g., protection of denuded mucosa, cytoprotective properties, binding bile acids) can also be valid for the current effects of sucralfate. 
Phosphate diabetes associated with bone metastases of oat cell lung cancer. Although the link between phosphate diabetes and neoplasm or benign mesenchymal tumors has been well documented, the nature of the phosphaturia factor remains unknown. We describe two cases of phosphate diabetes associated with bronchogenic cancer. In these case reports, we suggest that fibroblasts or osteoblasts synthesize a phosphate eliminating substance. 
A mutant alpha subunit of Gi2 induces neoplastic transformation of Rat-1 cells. In a recently discovered class of oncogenes, GTPase-inhibiting mutations constitutively activate alpha subunits of signal-transducing guanine nucleotide-binding proteins (G proteins). Somatic mutations in a subclass of endocrine tumors are found in the arginine-179 codon of the alpha subunit of Gi2 (alpha i2), creating the putative gip2 oncogene. We have tested the ability of gip2 to mediate neoplastic transformation of Rat-1 and NIH 3T3 fibroblasts in tissue culture. Expression of a mutant alpha i2 cDNA encoding cysteine in place of arginine-179 (alpha i2-R179C) caused Rat-1 cells to grow to a higher density in monolayer culture, to lose anchorage dependence, and to form tumors when injected subcutaneously into nude mice. In contrast, expression of alpha i2-R179C failed to alter growth or tumorigenicity of NIH 3T3 cells. We conclude that gip2 is an oncogene, by the criterion that it induces neoplastic transformation of Rat-1 cells. Failure of gip2 to transform NIH 3T3 cells is in keeping with clinical indications that gip2 is a tissue-selective oncogene. 
Colorectal cancer: cross-sectional imaging for staging of primary tumor and detection of local recurrence. This review describes the use of cross-sectional imaging in the staging of colorectal carcinoma and detection of local recurrence. The contributions of CT, MR imaging, and sonography are discussed and illustrated. Colorectal carcinoma is the second most common tumor in the United States and the most common cancer in the gastrointestinal tract. The prognosis for patients with this neoplasm is closely related to the extent of tumor at the time of diagnosis. Accurate noninvasive preoperative assessment of tumor stage by one or a combination of radiologic techniques would enable appropriate treatment to be planned in each case. Also, determination of possible tumor recurrence would permit effective monitoring of success of therapy and surgical intervention for recurrent disease before widespread metastasis occurs. 
Stage IB squamous cell cancer of the cervix: clinicopathologic features related to survival. Three hundred forty-five patients with stage IB squamous cell carcinoma of the cervix were treated at the University of Michigan Medical Center from 1970 through 1985. The overall cumulative 5-year survival was 89%. The clinical characteristics included mean age 44.6 years, nulliparity 10%, married 93%, obese 38%, hypertension 32%, diabetes mellitus 5%, smoking 54%, symptoms of bleeding 68%, positive cytologic smear 83%. Lymph nodes were diseased in 45 of 261 (17%) with 26 unilateral (10%) and 19 bilateral (7%). Tumor differentiation showed: grade 1, 112 (33%); grade 2, 144 (42%); grade 3, 86 (25%). Factors that did not influence survival included age, presence or absence of positive cervical cytologic smear, the interval from previous papanicolaou smear, hypertension, smoking history, patient's blood type, and transfusion at radical hysterectomy. In all patients survival was significantly influenced by the following features: tumor classified as well differentiated (95%) or poorly differentiated (82%); tumor size less than 3 cm (91%) or greater than 3 cm (76%); negative lymph nodes (93%) or positive lymph nodes (61%). When three or fewer lymph nodes were involved, the survival was 79% compared with 33% when four or more lymph nodes were involved. In 213 patients undergoing radical hysterectomy the cumulative 5-year survival was significantly influenced by the amount of residual cervical disease: no residual disease, 100%; less than 50% penetration, 96%; greater than 50% penetration, 83%. Involvement of the lower uterine segment reduced survival to 73% compared with 95% when the lower segment was uninvolved. One hundred seventeen patients without angiolymphatic invasion had a 97% cumulative 5-year survival whereas 70 patients without disease in the lymph nodes but with angiolymphatic invasion had an 88% cumulative 5-year survival rate. A Cox model, multiple proportional hazard analysis was performed for all patients, and the factors that influenced survival included tumor grade, tumor size, presence of metastatic disease in the lymph nodes, and diabetes mellitus. In patients undergoing radiation therapy, the tumor grade and size were significant factors in survival. In patients undergoing radical hysterectomy, survival was influenced by the depth of cervical penetration and lower uterine segment involvement whereas the tumor grade, tumor size, patient's age, and removal of ovaries were not significant. 
Adjuvant effect of human growth hormone with an inactivated flavivirus vaccine. Vaccines made by inactivating pathogenic microorganisms have been dramatically successful in controlling diseases in humans and animals. Despite their successes, they have a major disadvantage in that several inoculations are required for them to be effective. To overcome this problem, a commercial inactivated vaccine preparation against tickborne encephalitis was combined with human growth hormone (HGH). This formulation produced complete protection in a murine model with only one dose of vaccine, apparently by binding hormone and antigen to an insoluble matrix containing aluminium hydroxide. Thus it is postulated that when virus-specific lymphocytes are attracted to the site of injection, the hormone is at a high local concentration and stimulates the clonal expansion of antigen-specific T cells. The development of genetically engineered HGH now gives unlimited supplies of hormone, potentially resulting in an increase in efficacy of a wide variety of vaccines, especially those needing prolonged immunization schedules such as those being developed to combat human immunodeficiency virus infection. 
Segregation analysis reveals evidence of a major gene for Alzheimer disease. In an attempt to resolve the relative influences of major genes, multifactorial heritability, and cohort effects on the susceptibility to Alzheimer disease (AD), complex segregation analysis was performed on 232 nuclear families. All families were consecutively ascertained through a single proband who was referred for diagnostic evaluation of a memory disorder. The results suggest that susceptibility to AD is determined, in part, by a major autosomal dominant allele with an additional multifactorial component. Single-locus, polygenic, sporadic, and no-transmission models, as well as recessive inheritance of the major effect, were significantly rejected. Excess transmission from the heterozygote was marginally significant and probably reflects the presence of phenocopies or perhaps the existence of two or more major loci for AD. The frequency of the AD susceptibility allele was estimated to be .038, but the major locus accounts for only 24% of the transmission variance, indicating a substantial role for other genetic and nongenetic mechanisms in the causation of AD. 
The clinical management of cirrhosis. The discipline of hepatology is being rapidly advanced by several methods of investigation, most notably those of molecular and genetic biology. The polymerase chain reaction holds very great promise in unraveling the implications of hepatic virus infections. At the present time, we have no method of reversing established cirrhosis, and those with life threatening impairment of liver function can only look to liver transplants for salvage. The clinician can therefore best serve by identifying liver disease before cirrhosis and its complications occur. With effective case finding, and the continued development of therapeutic interventions directed toward known or suspected etiologic and pathogenic factors, many productive, high-quality years can be added to the lifespans of many patients. 
Subretinal neovascularization in systemic lupus erythematosus. Choroidal involvement in systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) occurs infrequently. We describe a patient with unusual manifestations of lupus oculopathy: prominent choroidal vasculopathy associated with multiple chorioretinal scars and subretinal neovascularization in the macular area. Choroidal disease was the primary feature of ocular involvement. SLE should be considered in the differential diagnosis in patients with inflammatory choroidal lesions. 
Rationale for development of low-molecular-weight heparins and their clinical potential in the prevention of postoperative venous thrombosis. Interest in low-molecular-weight heparins (LMWHs) as potential antithrombotic agents was stimulated by two observations in the mid-1970s and early 1980s. The first was finding that LMWH fractions prepared from unfractionated heparin (UFH) progressively lost their ability to prolong the activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT) while retaining their ability to inhibit Factor Xa. The second was the observation that LMWHs prepared by chemical depolarization of UFH are antithrombotic in experimental animal models but produce less microvascular bleeding in experimental models for an equivalent antithrombotic effect than the UFH from which they are derived. Subsequently, it was shown that LMWHs inhibit platelet function and impair vascular permeability less than standard heparin and that LMWHs have a longer biological half-life than standard heparin. A number of LMWHs have been evaluated in clinical trials in general and orthopedic surgery and in the treatment of venous thrombosis. LMWHs are highly effective in orthopedic surgery, where they appear to be more effective than standard heparin. LMWHs have also been shown to be either as effective or more effective than UFH in preventing postoperative thrombosis following general surgery. In preliminary studies, LMWHs appear to be as effective as standard heparin in the treatment of venous thrombosis, but larger studies are required using clinically relevant outcome measures. 
Acute lung injury induced by phospholipase A2. Structural and functional changes. On the basis of the observation that serum levels of phospholipase A2 (PLA2) are elevated in pancreatitis and systemic sepsis, and the association of these conditions with the subsequent development of acute lung injury, the present investigation examined the structural and physiologic consequences of intratracheal administration of PLA2 to adult male rats. Rats received direct intratracheal instillation of either control vehicle or 40,000 units/kg of PLA2 repurified from Naja naja venom. Animals treated with PLA2 showed higher cumulative mortality (33% versus 0%, n = 79; p less than 0.01) than did their control littermates. The PLA2-treated animals showed histologic evidence of acute lung injury characterized by interstitial and alveolar edema, accumulation of inflammatory cells, and alveolar wall thickening, which reached maximal severity 48 h after enzyme instillation. Forty-eight hours after PLA2 administration experimental animals had lower arterial oxygen tensions (73.9 +/- 7.66 mm Hg versus 96.7 +/- 2.52 mm Hg, mean +/- SEM; p less than 0.01), higher alveolar-arterial oxygen gradients (35.3 +/- 6.3 mm Hg versus 18.8 +/- 1.42 mm Hg, p less than 0.01), and higher wet-dry lung weight ratios (5.08 +/- 0.26, mean +/- SEM, n = 7 versus 3.29 +/- 0.08, n = 3; p less than 0.002) than did control animals. Lung lavage from experimental animals 48 h after PLA2 instillation showed increased total cell counts [(26.6 +/- 5.04) x 10(6) cells versus (4.69 +/- 1.48) x 10(6) cells; p less than 0.01], an increased percentage of neutrophils (34.2 +/- 4.6% versus 1.25 +/- 0.25%, mean +/- SEM; p less than 0.01), and increased protein concentrations in lavage fluid (0.38 +/- 0.06 mg/ml, mean +/- SEM, n = 4 versus 0.27 +/- 0.02 mg/ml, n = 5; p less than 0.05). The histologic and physiologic abnormalities had largely resolved by 240 h. These results suggest that PLA2 may be a potent mediator of lung inflammation and that intratracheal administration of PLA2 to adult rats may provide a useful experimental model of acute lung injury. 
Word deafness and auditory cortical function. A case history and hypothesis. A patient who already had Wernicke's aphasia due to a left temporal lobe lesion suffered a severe deterioration specifically of auditory language comprehension, subsequent to right temporal lobe infarction. A detailed comparison of his new condition with his language status before the second stroke revealed that the newly acquired deficit was limited to tasks related to auditory input. Further investigations demonstrated a speech perceptual disorder, which we analysed as due to deficits both at the level of general auditory processes and at the level of phonetic analysis. We discuss some arguments related to hemisphere specialization of phonetic processing and to the disconnection explanation of word deafness that support the hypothesis of word deafness being generally caused by mixed deficits. 
Outcome of patients with acute myocardial infarction who are ineligible for thrombolytic therapy. OBJECTIVE: To determine what proportion of patients with acute myocardial infarction are not eligible for thrombolytic therapy and to assess their natural history. DESIGN: Retrospective chart review. SETTING: A large community-based hospital. PATIENTS: All patients with acute myocardial infarction hospitalized during a 27-month period. MEASUREMENTS: Of 1471 patients with acute myocardial infarction, 230 (16%) received thrombolytic therapy according to the protocol and an additional 97 (7%) received nonprotocol thrombolytic therapy, primary coronary balloon angioplasty, or both because of contraindications. The other 1144 patients (78%) did not receive reperfusion therapy. MAIN RESULTS: The patients who did not receive thrombolytic therapy were older, more likely to be women, and more likely to have a history of hypertension, previous myocardial infarction, or chronic angina (all comparisons, P less than 0.002). An average of 1.9 reasons for exclusion were identified per patient among the ineligible patients. Mortality was fivefold higher among ineligible patients (19%; Cl, 16% to 21%) than among protocol-treated patients (4%; Cl, 1% to 6%) (P less than 0.001). In-hospital mortality rates for excluded patients were 28% (Cl, 23% to 32%) in elderly patients (age, greater than 76 years; n = 396); 29% (Cl, 23% to 35%) in patients with stroke or bleeding risk (n = 209); 17% (Cl, 14% to 20%) in patients with delayed presentation (greater than 4 hours after the onset of chest pain; [n = 599]); 14% (Cl, 11% to 16%) in patients with an ineligible electrocardiogram (ECG) (n = 673); and 26% (Cl, 21% to 32%) in patients with a miscellaneous reason for exclusion (n = 243). Independent predictors of increased mortality were: age greater than 76 years, stroke or other bleeding risk, ineligible ECG, or the presence of two or more exclusion criteria. CONCLUSIONS: Thrombolytic therapy is currently used in the United States for only a minority of patients with acute myocardial infarction: those who have low-risk prognostic characteristics. 
Prevalence and incidence of Becker muscular dystrophy. We measured the prevalence and incidence of Becker muscular dystrophy in the Northern Health Region of England, UK. Patients were identified from the records of the Regional Neurological Centre and Muscular Dystrophy Group laboratories, Newcastle upon Tyne, and by writing to local doctors. We used cDNA probes and/or dystrophin immunolabelling of muscle-biopsy samples to prove the diagnosis of all cases. Results were compared with the known prevalence and incidence of Duchenne muscular dystrophy. 73 patients alive and resident in the Northern Health Region were identified, giving a prevalence rate of 2.38/100,000. This compares with a prevalence of Duchenne muscular dystrophy of 2.48/100,000. The cumulative birth incidence of Becker muscular dystrophy (at least 1 in 18 450 male live births) was about one third that of Duchenne muscular dystrophy (1 in 5618 male live births), suggesting that the disorder is more common than previously thought. 
Open lung biopsy does not correlate with pulmonary function after the adult respiratory distress syndrome. Abnormalities of pulmonary function occur following the adult respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). To determine if open lung biopsy (OLB) during ARDS predicts late pulmonary function abnormalities, we examined nine survivors of ARDS who had OLB during ARDS. Open lung biopsy was performed within two weeks of the diagnosis of ARDS, and the following were scored by a pulmonary pathologist as to extent and severity: hyaline membranes (HM), interstitial fibrosis (IF), air space organization (AO), interstitial cellularity (IC), and type 2 cell proliferation (T2C). Pulmonary function tests performed at least one year after ARDS were also used for analysis. Percent predicted Dco, TLC, DL/VA, and FVC were regressed against extent, severity, and combined scores. No significant correlation was found despite impressive histologic abnormalities. These data suggest that the severity and extent of HM, IF, AO, T2C, or IC do not correlate with lung function following ARDS. 
Effects of different angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors on ischemic isolated rat hearts: relationship between cardiac ACE inhibition and cardioprotection. We determined the relationship between cardiac angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibition and anti-ischemic efficacy of several structurally different ACE inhibitors or their prodrug esters perfused through the isolated rat heart. Seven ACE inhibitors inhibited cardiac ACE to varying degrees due to differences in uptake during perfusion through nonischemic rat hearts. Zofenopril-sulfhydryl and fosinoprilic acid were the most effective of the free inhibitors. Among the prodrugs, zofenopril and S-benzoylcaptopril, hydrolyzed rapidly by cardiac esterase, were more effective than their component ACE-inhibitors, whereas fosinopril, ramipril and enalapril were poorly active. For studies in ischemic rat hearts, vehicle or drug treatment was initiated 10 min before a 25-min period of global ischemia and during a 30-min reperfusion period. Of five unesterified ACE inhibitors studied for anti-ischemic activity, only captopril and zofenopril-sulfhydryl were found to improve postischemic contractile function and reduce cell death in the isolated rat hearts. Fosinoprilic acid, ramiprilat and enalaprilat were not cardioprotective at high perfusion concentrations, despite the fact that nearly complete inhibition of cardiac ACE was achieved with all of the compounds studied. The S-benzoyl prodrugs of zofenopril-sulfhydryl and captopril were at least as potent as their component ACE inhibitors in reducing ischemic-reperfusion damage in the same model. Neither zofenopril nor captopril, however, had any effect on coronary flow before or after ischemia. Thus, it appears that the cardioprotective effects of zofenopril and captopril are independent of cardiac ACE inhibition or, at least, that ACE inhibition alone is not sufficient. Both captopril and zofenopril are sulfhydryl-containing compounds whereas the inactive compounds are not; and, thus, this group appears to be important in mediating their cardioprotective actions. 
Endosonographic TNM staging of extrahepatic bile duct cancer: comparison with pathological staging. Endosonography was performed preoperatively in 33 patients with common bile duct carcinoma and in 43 patients with carcinoma of the common hepatic duct and its bifurcation. The results were correlated with the histology of resected specimens according to the new (1987) TNM (tumor, node, metastasis) classification. Endosonography was accurate in the evaluation of the depth of tumor infiltration. Overall accuracy for common bile duct carcinoma and common hepatic duct carcinoma was 82.8% and 85%, respectively. Endosonography was helpful in diagnosing regional lymph node metastases but not accurate in diagnosing nonmetastatic lymph nodes. With common bile duct carcinoma, the incidence of lymph node metastasis increased with progressive depth of tumor infiltration. No such correlation was found in common hepatic duct carcinomas. In the staging of distant metastasis, this technique was limited by the low-penetration depth of ultrasonography. Thus, additional transcutaneous ultrasonography or computed tomography was necessary for complete staging. The routine use of the biopsy channel for endosonographically guided aspiration puncture will further enhance the diagnostic value of endosonography in the future. 
Does metoclopramide reduce the length of ileus after colorectal surgery? A prospective randomized trial. Between August 1988 and September 1989, 100 consecutive patients who underwent elective abdominal colorectal surgical procedures were prospectively randomized to receive or not to receive metoclopramide. Metoclopramide was intravenously administered every 8 hours from the completion of surgery until a solid food diet was able to be tolerated. Seven patients were not included in the final tabulations because of one death, one small bowel obstruction requiring laparotomy, one anastomotic leak requiring laparotomy, and four protocol violations. Ninety-three patients, 37 men and 56 women (mean age, 59.5; range, 14-89 years) underwent 40 segmental colectomies, 13 total abdominal colectomies, 8 abdominoperineal resections, 8 ileoanal pouch procedures, 7 small bowel resections, and 17 other colorectal procedures. The 40 patients who received postoperative metoclopramide were in Group 1, and the 53 who did not were in Group 2. The mean length of time between laparotomy and commencement of oral fluid and oral solid intake in Groups 1 and 2 were 3.5 and 4.8 days, and 3.5 and 5.0 days, respectively. These differences were not statistically significant (P greater than 0.05). Prolonged ileus was seen in seven patients in Group 1 and in eight patients in Group 2. These differences were also not statistically significant (P greater than 0.05). Prolonged ileus was defined as the need for nasogastric tube reinsertion or discontinuation of oral intake. We conclude that metoclopramide does not significantly alter the course of postoperative ileus. 
Cerebral infarction in young people. A study of 148 patients with early cerebral angiography. The aetiology of strokes was studied in a hospital based series of patients aged up to 40 years with precise clinical and radiological criteria. One hundred and forty five patients (75 males and 73 females) aged five to 40 years with cerebral ischaemia were evaluated. Aetiology was heterogeneous and could be classified into seven groups. Cerebral arteriograms were performed in all cases and indicated the aetiological diagnosis in most patients. Embolism was the most frequent recognised abnormality (38.4%). There were no complications of arteriography. Arterial dissections discovered by arteriography were the cause of the stroke in 10.1% of the patients. Atherosclerosis was diagnosed in 32 cases and was the commonest cause (21.6%). In one fifth of cases no cause was found. Contraceptive drugs were considered as potential cause of ischaemic stroke in 11.5%, cardiac diseases in 12.8% and haematological disorders in 8.1%. Other potential causes included migraine, inflammatory diseases, pregnancy and lacunas. Follow up in 126 cases showed that many patients had good functional recovery. 
Bleeding complications to oral anticoagulant therapy: multivariate analysis of 1010 treatment years in 551 outpatients. One thousand and ten patient years of oral anticoagulant therapy with vitamin-K-antagonists were reviewed with regard to major bleeding complications. The incidence of bleeding that necessitated hospital admission was 2.7% per year (95% confidence limits, 1.7-3.7%). The major source of bleeding was the alimentary tract, whereas no cases of intracranial bleeding were found. Various factors with potential effects on the bleeding risk were evaluated by multivariate statistical analysis, and the following independent risk factors were identified: age greater than 75 years and hypertension increased the bleeding risk by 10.5% and 4.5%, respectively. Each recorded prothrombin value significantly below the therapeutic range increased the bleeding risk by 3.9%, and each year of treatment increased the risk by 2.0%. These figures may be used to estimate the risk of major bleeding in an individual patient. Current treatment with thiazide diuretics was found to increase the bleeding risk by 5.2%. However, this observation requires further documentation and analysis. Although no lethal episodes of bleeding occurred, the developing field of indications for oral anticoagulant therapy should be considered on the basis of a continuous substantial risk of major bleeding. 
Malakoplakia of the temporal bone in a nine-month-old infant. A case of malakoplakia, of the temporal bone in a nine-month-old male child is reported. The lesion presented as an aural polyp, associated with a lower motor neuron facial palsy. On exploration, the granuloma was noted to involve the temporal bone, eroding the bony labyrinth. It was successfully treated with surgical debridement, and antibiotics. A review of the relevant literature is presented. 
British Columbia sends patients to Seattle for coronary artery surgery. Bypassing the queue in Canada. Concern about waiting lists for elective procedures has become a highly visible challenge to the universal health insurance program in Canada. In response to lengthening queues for patients waiting for cardiac surgery, British Columbia made contracts with four Seattle hospitals to send a total of 200 patients for coronary artery bypass surgery. This article examines the cause of the queue for cardiac surgery in British Columbia and the events that led to outside contracting. Global hospital budgets and restrictions on capital expansion have limited hospital capacity for cardiac surgery. This constrained supply, combined with periodic shortages in critical care nurses and cardiac perfusion technologists, has resulted in a rapid increase in the waiting list. Reducing wide variations in the lengths of queues for individual surgeons may afford an opportunity to reduce long waits. While the patient queue for cardiac surgery has sparked a public debate about budget limits and health care needs, its clinical impact remains uncertain. 
Double-blind, cross-over study comparing prostaglandin E1 and papaverine in patients with vasculogenic impotence. Intracorporeal injection of vasoactive agents is the treatment of choice for many patients with organic impotence. However, some patients with vasculogenic impotence respond poorly to injections of papaverine or papaverine/phentolamine. This study was conducted to determine if patients with vasculogenic impotence who failed to respond to papaverine might respond to prostaglandin E1 and thus be salvaged from possible prosthetic surgery. A total of 54 patients with vasculogenic impotence were administered intracorporeal prostaglandin E1 (20 micrograms) and intracorporeal papaverine (60 mg) randomized in a double-blind fashion and crossed over one week later. Forty-six percent of patients receiving prostaglandin E1 produced a satisfactory erection compared with 14 percent of patients with a similar response to papaverine. The difference between these results was highly significantly by the McNemar test. The number of side effects were similar for both drugs. Prostaglandin E1 might be considered the intracorporeal agent of choice for patients with significant vasculogenic impotence. 
Hidradenoma papilliferum of the upper eyelid arising from the apocrine gland of Moll. Hidradenoma papilliferum is derived from apocrine sweat glands and was originally described as a tumor located in the anogenital area. The authors recently examined a 78-year-old man with a hidradenoma papilliferum at the margin of the upper eyelid. While the tumor was located in the dermis, serial sections showed a connection to the epidermis and neoplastic cells partially replacing a gland of Moll. There were glandular structures with luminal cells that showed apical decapitation-type secretion, indicating the apocrine origin of the tumor. The luminal cells also contained granules that stained with periodic acid-Schiff (PAS) stain and were diastase resistant. Results of examination of the duct-forming cells by transmission electron microscopy showed adluminal villi, focal decapitation secretion, luminal cytoplasmic debris, and electron-dense cytoplasmic secretory granules. Because the apocrine glands of Moll are localized adjacent to the eyelid cilia, hidradenoma papilliferum and other tumors of apocrine origin should be considered in the clinical setting of a mass at the eyelid margin. 
Reflex anal dilatation: effect of parting the buttocks on anal function in normal subjects and patients with anorectal and spinal disease. Anal dilatation in response to gentle parting of the buttocks has been advocated as a sign of sexual abuse in children, but nothing is known of the physiology of this response or its existence in normal subjects, in patients with spinal disease, and in patients with a weak sphincter and whether it can be elicited after training. To answer these questions we investigated the effect of parting the buttocks on anal function. Combined anal manometry and electromyography was conducted in six normal subjects (five men, one woman, aged 19-53 years), in 18 patients with faecal incontinence (three men, 15 women, aged 30-80 years), and in seven paraplegic patients (six men, one woman, aged 25-36 years), in four of whom the posterior sacral roots had been cut. Parting the buttocks in normal subjects reduced the pressure in the anal canal from 102 (20) to 14 (3) cm H2O (mean (SEM), p less than 0.00001), but did not cause the anus to gape. This drop in pressure was associated with increased electrical activity in the external anal sphincter. Normal subjects could consciously relax the external anal sphincter and reduce the anal pressure but not so as to result in anal gaping during traction on the buttocks, even after anal dilatation. Stimulation of the anal lining by moving a probe in and out of the anal canal increased the activity of the external anal sphincter, raising anal pressures. Paraplegic patients who had lost conscious control of their external sphincters showed anal gaping when the buttocks were parted. 
Inflammatory pseudotumor of the liver causing biliary obstruction. Treatment by biliary stenting with 5-year follow-up. Inflammatory pseudotumors of the liver are rare lesions that are becoming increasingly recognized, possibly because of frequent use of abdominal computed tomography (CT) and ultrasonography. Most previously reported cases have been treated by hepatic resection. For this reason, we describe a patient with obstructive jaundice secondary to an inflammatory hepatic pseudotumor in the porta hepatis. Bilateral internal biliary stents were inserted, and the patient remains well 5 years later. The clinicopathologic features of inflammatory pseudotumors of the liver are described, as are the implications of accurate diagnosis. There have been no previous reports of biliary stenting in management of inflammatory hepatic pseudotumors. 
'Low sodium' diuresis and ileal loss in patients with ileostomies: effect of desmopressin. Patients with ileostomies show an early diuresis when sodium restricted; this, together with an obligatory ileal sodium loss, predisposes them to severe salt and water depletion. The role of arginine vasopressin in this circumstance and whether it is natriuretic, or antinatriuretic, is unclear. There is also controversy over its likely effect on small bowel fluid reabsorption. We have examined the effect of the non-pressor (V2) synthetic vasopressin analogue 1-deamino-8-D-arginine (desmopressin) on renal and ileal sodium and water excretion in ileostomy patients during acute adaptation to a low sodium diet. Patients were studied on two separate occasions (nonrandomised) with and without the administration of desmopressin (0.75 micrograms intramuscular, three times a day). In eight subjects without desmopressin there was pronounced diuresis on the first low sodium day, associated with a fall in renal sodium excretion and no change in ileal output or composition. In five (of the original) subjects with desmopressin there was pronounced antidiuresis, no change in renal sodium excretion, and no change in ileal output or composition. In both studies rises in plasma renin activity and salivary aldosterone concentration lagged behind the early decline in renal sodium excretion. We have confirmed the phenomenon of 'low sodium' diuresis after sodium restriction in ileostomy patients and shown that it can be prevented by desmopressin. Desmopressin has no direct or indirect effect on renal sodium excretion or ileal fluid and electrolyte loss in humans. 
Otolaryngologic manifestations of gastroesophageal reflux. The exact incidence of gastroesophageal reflux (GER) is unknown, although it is estimated that at least 25% of patients with GER have head and neck symptoms alone. These symptoms may consist of one or more of the following: excess salivation, hoarseness, "post-nasal drip," voice change, persistent coughing, food sticking in the throat, globus hystericus, otalgia, throat clearing, neck pain, sore throats, the sensation of a lump in the throat, choking spells, and bronchospasm. Carcinoma of the larynx and upper aerodigestive tract may be a consequence of chronic reflux. GER, especially when the classic symptoms of reflux are absent, is frequently overlooked as a cause of these problems. This article reviews the symptoms and pathophysiology of these conditions. The diagnostic and therapeutic modalities available to us in managing these patients are also discussed. 
Diagnostic accuracy of temporomandibular joint lower-compartment arthroscopy using an ultrathin arthroscope: a postmortem study. Arthroscopy was performed on the lower temporomandibular (TMJ) joint compartment of 30 fresh cadavers using a newly developed ultrathin arthroscope. Comparison of arthroscopic and dissection findings showed a diagnostic accuracy of 57%. There were both false-positive and false-negative arthroscopic diagnosis. The majority of the false diagnosis occurred in the lateral part of the joint. Iatrogenic damage to the disc occurred in one joint. The study suggests that arthroscopy of the lower joint space of the TMJ can be done with a diagnostic accuracy similar to what has been described for the upper joint space. There appears to be no major risks of iatrogenic damage to the joint structures using an ultrathin arthroscope. 
Treatment of peptic ulcer disease with sucralfate: a review. Sucralfate has been used widely for the treatment of peptic ulcer. Healing rates for duodenal ulcer range from 60 to 90% at 4-6 weeks and up to 90% at 12 weeks for gastric ulcer. The small number of maintenance trials suggest that relapse of duodenal ulcer is reduced comparably to H2 receptor antagonists. There has been considerable interest in the possibility of lower relapse ratios after initial healing with sucralfate compared with H2 receptor antagonists, but more studies of the possible mechanisms as well as larger trials are still needed to confirm these observations. 
Bowel obstruction: evaluation with CT Eighty-four computed tomographic (CT) scans from patients referred for bowel obstruction between January 2, 1988, and December 31, 1989, were retrospectively evaluated. A pair of radiologists without knowledge of patient histories determined the presence or absence of bowel obstruction. Sixty-four patients ultimately proved to have intestinal obstruction, and 20 did not. Diagnosis was established by means of surgery (n = 39), barium studies (n = 17), and clinical course (n = 28). Causes of obstruction included adhesions (n = 37), metastases (n = 6), primary tumor (n = 7), Crohn disease (n = 4), hernia (n = 3), hematoma (n = 2), colonic diverticulitis (n = 2), and other (n = 3). In addition, 83 CT examinations in patients with no history or indication of intestinal obstruction were simultaneously reviewed. The overall sensitivity was 94%, specificity was 96%, and accuracy was 95%. The cause of obstruction was correctly predicted in 47 of 64 cases (73%). Intestinal obstruction was not diagnosed in any of the 83 control patients. CT is most useful in patients with a history of abdominal malignancy and in patients who have not been operated on and who have signs of infection, bowel infarction, or a palpable abdominal mass. 
Prevalence of HIV antibody in a noninner-city university hospital emergency department. STUDY HYPOTHESIS: To determine the prevalence of antibody to human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) in trauma and nontrauma patients not identified as having known HIV infection in a noninner-city university teaching hospital emergency department, and to determine the frequency with which treating emergency physicians are knowledgeable of patients' risk factors for HIV infection. POPULATION: ED patients between 18 and 59 years old with injuries that met trauma center triage criteria or with nontrauma-related illness who had blood drawn for physician-requested laboratory tests and for whom an extra aliquot of blood was available for HIV antibody testing. METHODS: All serum samples were first tested for antibody to HIV by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. If positive, the specimen was retested. All repeatedly reactive specimens were analyzed by Western blot test. The treating physician completed a questionnaire regarding the patient's illness and risk factors for HIV infection after the patient's care was completed. RESULTS: Two of 100 major trauma patients (confidence interval, 0% to 5%) and seven of 100 nontrauma patients (confidence interval, 2% to 12%) had antibody to HIV. The seropositive rate by age and clinical group varied from 0% to 12.5%, with the highest rates in the 30- to 39-year-old group of nontrauma patients. The difference in proportions of seropositivity between the sexes was not statistically significant. Physicians obtained information regarding homosexual or bisexual behavior, IV drug use, and hemophilia from 52% of the nontrauma patients and only 17% of trauma patients. None of 30 trauma patients for whom data were available and only two of the 100 nontrauma patients gave a history of any high-risk behavior. CONCLUSION: Although the sampling technique we used has limitations, the prevalence of HIV infection in our noninner-city ED is similar to that recently reported from inner-city EDs. This is in contrast to previous reports of low rates of HIV infection among ED patients in nonurban settings. Physician assessment of risk factors was incomplete in the majority of our patients. Patients rarely acknowledged any high-risk behavior. It is essential that emergency health care workers take maximum diligence to prevent exposure to blood and other body fluids from all ED patients. 
Immune dysfunction in mice with plasmacytomas. I. Evidence that transforming growth factor-beta contributes to the altered expression of activation receptors on host B lymphocytes. Plasmacytoma-bearing mice (PC-mice) develop a polyclonal B cell immunodeficiency syndrome characterized by marked impairment of: a) primary antibody responses and b) proliferative responses to B cell mitogens. The present investigations used two-color flow cytometry to examine B lymphocytes from the spleens and lymph nodes of PC-mice and found decreased surface membrane expression of surface IgM (sIgM), transferrin receptors (TfR) and IgE FcR (CD23), increased expression of class II MHC, but normal expression of B220, Mel-14, Fc gamma RII, and Fc mu R. These changes were not related to the H chain class or the amount of Ig produced by the plasmacytoma. When cultured with IL-4, B lymphocytes from PC-mice increased their expression of sIgM and class II MHC, but not of CD23. Several findings implicate transforming growth factor-beta 1 (TGF-beta 1) in the mechanism that modulates receptor expression on B lymphocytes in PC-mice: a) ascites fluid from PC-mice contains large quantities of TGF-beta 1; b) supernatants of cultured spleen cells from PC mice contain up to eightfold more TGF-beta than is found with normal spleen cells; c) cloned plasmacytoma cells produce TGF-beta in vitro; and d) the abnormal phenotype of B cells from PC-mice, i.e., decreased CD23, sIgM, and TfR, and increased class II MHC, is induced on normal B cells cultured in the presence of TGF-beta 1. Because sIgM, TfR, class II MHC, and CD23 are molecules that play fundamental roles in the activation of normal B cells, their modulation by TGF-beta 1: a) identifies molecular mechanisms that could account for some of the known immunosuppressive properties of TGF-beta 1 and b) implicates TGF-beta in the pathogenesis of the polyclonal B cell immunodeficiency that is characteristic of plasma cell tumors. 
Endoscopic removal of inflammatory fibroid polyps of the stomach. Three cases of gastric inflammatory fibroid polyp removed by endoscopic polypectomy are reported. All lesions were located in the gastric antrum or prepyloric region, and their depth was restricted to the submucosa. The correct diagnosis was obtained, and the digestive symptoms disappeared after polypectomy. In contrast to observations in previous reports, we believe these lesions are suitable for removal by endoscopic means, provided they are small in size and strictly submucosal in location. 
Peptic ulcer disease in children. Primary duodenal ulcer disease occurs in children of all ages, but is most often seen in those over 10 years. As in the adult, it often pursues a chronic course. Primary gastric ulcer is seen in children under 6 years, is more unusual, and does not tend to recur. Stress ulcers are seen most often in infants and in critically ill children and are asymptomatic until the complications of hemorrhage or perforation appear. Drug-related ulcers are being seen more frequently as the use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents increases. With the use of new therapeutic agents, management has been simplified and surgical intervention has become a rarity. Helicobacter pylori is now a recognized cause of antral gastritis and ulceration in the child. 
Formation of noninfectious HIV-1 virus particles lacking a full-length envelope protein. Deletions were constructed within a functional human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) proviral clone in order to assess the role of the envelope protein in virus particle formation. A graded exonuclease deletion technique was used to produce 12 clones with deletions of 175-308 nucleotides in the first conserved domain of envelope. This included 9 clones with frameshift deletions and 3 clones with in-frame deletions. Isogenic pairs of env deletion clones were produced with or without an additional deletion in the vif and vpr genes. Upon transfection, all clones produced virus particles, as determined by p24 antigen, reverse transcriptase, and sucrose gradient assays with conditioned media. Virus particles produced from clones with deletions in env or vif and vpr, or both regions, banded on sucrose gradients with a mobility similar to that of virus produced by the parental clone. The p24 gag capsid protein in the particles was resistant to trypsin, but the particles were disrupted by treatment with Triton X-100, suggesting the presence of a surrounding lipid bilayer. Furthermore, electron microscopic studies revealed both mature and immature virus particles derived from COS cells transfected with the env deletion clones. Cocultivation experiments with lymphoid cells and cells transfected with each of the env deletion clones demonstrated that the virus particles were noninfectious. 
Ribose facilitates thallium-201 redistribution in patients with coronary artery disease To investigate whether i.v. infusion of ribose, an adenine nucleotide precursor, postischemia facilitates thallium-201 (201Tl) redistribution and improves identification of ischemic myocardium in patients with coronary artery disease (CAD), 17 patients underwent two exercise 201Tl stress tests, performed 1-2 wk apart. After immediate postexercise planar imaging, patients received either i.v. ribose (3.3 mg/kg/min x 30 min) or saline as a control. Additional imaging was performed 1 and 4 hr postexercise. Reversible defects were identified by count-profile analysis. Significantly more (nearly twice as many) reversible 201Tl defects were identified on the post-ribose images compared to the post-saline (control) images at both 1 and 4 hr postexercise (p less than 0.001). Quantitative analyses of the coronary arteriogram was available in 13 patients and confirmed that the additional reversible defects were in myocardial regions supplied by stenosed arteries. We conclude that ribose appears to facilitate 201Tl redistribution in patients with CAD and enhances identification of ischemic myocardium. 
Gastric emptying and interdigestive antroduodenal motility in patients with esophageal scleroderma. The study was carried out on two groups of patients with esophageal scleroderma (LES pressure less than 5 mm Hg and amplitude of smooth muscle pressure waves less than 10 mm Hg): one group included patients with mild (group M) and the other severe (group S) gastroesophageal reflux (GER) diagnosed by ambulatory esophageal pH monitoring. Nine normal subjects were used as controls. Antroduodenal motility was recorded by means of manometry for 200-300 min after an overnight fast and the gastric emptying (T1/2) of a semisolid meal was measured utilizing a scintigraphic method. Patients of group S showed a significantly lower incidence of migrating motor complex activity fronts, as well as a more delayed gastric emptying, compared with those of group M. The reason that patients with the same degree of esophageal motor impairment have different degrees of GER may lie in the fact that the concomitant impairment of gastrointestinal interdigestive cyclic clearing activity and the delay in gastric emptying may allow a larger quantity of material to remain stagnant in the gastric lumen, readily available for gastroesophageal reflux. 
Impaired diastolic function and coronary reserve in genetic hypertension. Role of interstitial fibrosis and medial thickening of intramyocardial coronary arteries. Left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) in rats with genetic hypertension is accompanied by abnormal myocardial diastolic stiffness and impaired coronary reserve. Whether these functional defects are related to a structural remodeling of the myocardium that includes an interstitial and perivascular fibrosis, myocyte hypertrophy, and medial thickening of intramyocardial coronary arteries is uncertain. To address these issues, 14-week-old male spontaneously hypertensive rats with established hypertension and LVH were treated with low-dose (SLO group: 2.5 mg/kg/day, n = 11) or high-dose (SHI group: 20 mg/kg/day, n = 9) oral lisinopril for 12 weeks to sustain hypertension and LVH or to normalize arterial pressure and myocardial mass, respectively. When SHI and SLO groups were compared with age- and sex-matched 26-week-old untreated spontaneously hypertensive rats (n = 11) and normotensive Wistar-Kyoto rats (n = 9), we found 1) normalization of blood pressure (p less than 0.005) and complete regression of LVH (p less than 0.005) in the SHI group and no significant blood pressure or LVH reduction in the SLO group, 2) complete regression of morphometrically determined myocardial interstitial and perivascular fibrosis in SHI and SLO groups (p less than 0.025) associated with normalization of diastolic stiffness, measured in the isolated heart (p less than 0.025), and 3) regression of medial wall thickening of intramyocardial coronary arteries only in the SHI group (P less than 0.005), accompanied by a normalization of coronary vasodilator reserve to adenosine (p less than 0.005). Thus, interstitial fibrosis and not LVH is responsible for abnormal myocardial diastolic stiffness, whereas medical wall thickening of intramyocardial resistance vessels, influenced by arterial pressure, is associated with impaired coronary reserve. 
Time course of the blood pressure response to oral isradipine in uncomplicated mild-to-moderate essential hypertension. Forty-five patients with supine diastolic blood pressures (DBPs) above 95 mm Hg at the end of a four-week placebo run-in period were randomized to receive either 1.25 mg, 2.5 mg, or 5 mg isradipine twice daily as monotherapy for 12 weeks. Blood pressures (BP) were measured every 14 days, always by the same observer and using standard techniques. The Montevideo Mathematical Model was used to determine the time course of the response to treatment in each dosage group. Of the 33 patients who completed the study, four of the 12 patients receiving 1.25 mg isradipine twice daily had their BP controlled by weeks 10 or 12 (supine DBP less than or equal to 90 mm Hg), seven of 11 by 2.5 mg twice daily, and five of 10 by 5 mg twice daily. Mean DBPs for each dosage group were significantly reduced by week 12 (P less than .015 in all groups). The Montevideo Model allows estimation of the time after onset of treatment by which BP is reduced by a given amount. This model indicated that, with 2.5 mg isradipine twice daily, a fall in mean arterial pressure of 10 mm Hg is to be expected within three weeks of initiating drug administration. 
Clinical studies of sucralfate in reflux esophagitis. The European experience. Reflux esophagitis is encountered quite frequently in clinical practice. Symptoms can be mild, moderate, or severe and complications can occur, particularly if the disorder is untreated or undertreated. Treatment is aimed at relieving symptoms, healing lesions, and preventing complications. Various pharmacologic options are available for treatment, including antacids, alginate/antacid compounds, acid-reducing agents, prokinetic drugs, and agents that protect the mucosa. This article reviews a number of clinical studies evaluating sucralfate in the treatment of reflux esophagitis. Almost all of the investigations were conducted in Europe and encompassed open-label studies, placebo-controlled trials, and comparative studies. From the studies discussed, it can be concluded that sucralfate not only has a place in the treatment of peptic ulcer disease, but is also effective in treating reflux esophagitis. Sucralfate is comparable to H2-receptor antagonists in symptom improvement and healing rates. In addition, the studies reviewed have shown sucralfate to be safe and well tolerated. 
Accumulation of glycoprotein in the Golgi apparatus of hepatocytes in alcoholic liver injuries. To clarify the role of the hepatocytic Golgi apparatus in the accumulation of proteins in the hepatocytes of alcoholic liver disease, changes in the Golgi apparatus in human and experimental alcoholic liver injuries were analyzed. Immunoelectron microscopically, transferrin, one of the secretory glycoproteins from the liver, was retained in the smooth endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi apparatus of the hepatocytes in both human and rat alcoholic liver injuries. Biochemically, transferrin content in the Golgi fraction was clearly high in the rats with alcoholic liver injury. Desialo-glycoproteins were found in the serum of rats with alcoholic liver injuries. These results suggested that the glycosylation and secretion of hepatic glycoproteins in the Golgi apparatus were impaired in alcoholic liver injury. These abnormalities in the Golgi apparatus function may be important for the development of alcoholic liver injury. 
An autopsy study of the peritoneal cavity from patients on continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis. Sixteen autopsies were performed on patients aged 56 +/- 15 (SD) years who were on continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD) for 834 +/- 766 (SD) days. Lactate-buffered dialysate and povidone-iodine antiseptic were used in all cases. Multiple peritoneal sections were taken to evaluate peritoneal membrane thickening, inflammation, neovascularization, fibrosis, and adhesions. Peritoneal thickening, inflammation, or adhesions were not related to sex, race, or etiology of renal failure. Time on dialysis was also not a direct determinant of peritoneal adhesions or neovascularization. Peritonitis episodes correlated with chronic peritoneal serosal changes. This study supports the hypothesis that peritoneal alterations in patients on CAPD are related to episodes of peritonitis. 
The prognostic significance of postoperative residual tumor in ependymoma. Between 1970 and 1989, 29 patients with intracranial ependymomas were evaluated and treated at the Children's Hospital in Boston. With a median follow-up of 82 months, the actuarial survival rates at 5 and 10 years were 61 +/- 10% and 46 +/- 12%, respectively. Anaplastic histological findings were uncommon (2 of 29). Initial postoperative radiotherapy was given to 25 patients, with a median tumor dose of 5360 cGy. With a median time to recurrence of 22 months, local failure (within 2 cm of original enhancing mass) was the predominant pattern of relapse (15 of 16 failures). The presence of radiographic residual disease seen on postoperative magnetic resonance imaging or computed tomographic scans was the most important prognostic variable for patients with intracranial ependymoma. Analysis of the 19 patients who underwent postoperative imaging revealed a 75 +/- 15% 5-year freedom from progressive disease for 9 patients with no residual disease, as compared with 0% freedom from progressive disease for the 10 patients with gross residual disease (P = 0.03). In contrast, the surgical assessment of residual disease was not significant (P = 0.4). Age at presentation was also a significant prognostic factor. The overall actuarial survival rate at 12 years for infants 24 months or younger at diagnosis was 0%, as compared with 62 +/- 13% for older patients (P = 0.03). For non-anaplastic ependymomas, complete surgical resection followed by local-field, high-dose (greater than 54 Gy) radiotherapy appears to offer the greatest chance for long-term survival. Because of the markedly reduced survival rate for patients with radiologically apparent postoperative disease, maximal surgical resection and novel therapeutic endeavors appear warranted for this high-risk group. Future protocols should use postoperative imaging, not operative reports, to stratify patients with ependymoma. 
The course of peptic ulcer disease. Peptic ulcer disease usually has periodic exacerbations and remissions. Pain can disappear without total healing of the ulcer crater and can be absent when an ulcer is present. Changes in the incidence of ulcer disease have been noted in recent years. Genetic predisposition, infection with H. pylori, and the use of anti-inflammatory drugs are involved in causation. Stress; the use of alcohol, tobacco and caffeine; and other diseases have been implicated as etiologic factors. Ulcer pain has a recognizable pattern, but the symptoms can be variable, particularly in older people and in patients taking ulcerogenic medications. The familiar complications of hemorrhage, perforation, and obstruction still occur, and nonulcer dyspepsia has not been fully explained. Duodenal ulcers have a disturbing tendency to return; new therapeutic approaches offer hope. 
Comparative study of glass and antimony electrodes for continuous oesophageal pH monitoring. Oesophageal pH monitoring data are influenced by numerous patient or technique related factors, or both. In this study, data recorded with glass microelectrodes or antimony electrodes, both with external cutaneous Ag/AgCl reference electrodes, connected to two different recording devices are compared. Pearson correlation coefficients regarding the reflux index (% of the investigation time with a pH less than 4) ranged from poor to excellent (0.55 to 1.00). Differences in data recorded with glass electrodes are not significantly dependent on the recording device (r:0.93 to 1.00 for the reflux index). The correlation between data simultaneously recorded with antimony electrodes is lower, although not significantly different for the reflux index (0.90). Correlation between data recorded with glass and antimony probes is rather poor (0.55 to 0.70). Therefore data recorded with antimony electrodes cannot be compared with those recorded with glass electrodes. The mean pH recorded with glass electrodes is lower than that with antimony probes. 
Combined treatment of symptomatic gallbladder stones by extracorporeal shock-wave lithotripsy (ESWL) and instillation of methyl tert-butyl ether (MTBE). Twenty-four patients with symptomatic gallbladder stones (12 radiolucent and 12 calcified) were treated by a combined approach of extracorporeal shock-wave lithotripsy (ESWL) and subsequent instillation of methyl tert-butyl ether (MTBE). The patients received a mean of 1500 +/- 185 shock-wave discharges. The mean instillation time of MTBE was 13 +/- 4.2 hr. Treatment was tolerated without major adverse effects. Within a time period of three to five days eight of 12 patients with pure radiolucent stones and four of 12 with calcified stones became stone-free. After a median follow-up of five months (range: one week to 26 months), a total of 11 patients (92%) with radiolucent stones and of eight patients (66%) of those with calcified stones were free of stones, fragments, or debris. These clearance rates appear high when compared with reports on monotherapy with ESWL or MTBE, suggesting a positive effect of a combined approach in selected patients. Two patients exhibited recurrent stones after six and seven months, respectively. 
Cytopathologic diagnosis of benign lesions simulating choroidal melanomas. In three cases of benign pigmented lesions (one melanocytoma and two pigment epithelial adenomas) there was evidence of tumor growth and the lesions were referred to us as uveal melanomas. The fine needle aspiration biopsy specimens were correctly interpreted in the operating room as being benign tumors. The pigment granules in these benign pigmented lesions are much larger than are observed in uveal melanomas. When they were visible through the heavy pigmentation, the cellular detail appeared benign. In two cases the tumors were successfully resected with cyclochroidectomy techniques and the visual outcome was good. The third eye was studied after it had been removed at another institution. Fine needle aspiration biopsy can often differentiate a benign-simulating pigmented lesion from uveal melanoma. 
Insights into the mechanisms of defective antigen presentation after hemorrhage. Although hemorrhage depresses macrophage antigen presentation (AP), a critical component in eliciting an antigen-specific immune response, it is not known which particular step in macrophage AP (i.e., uptake, ingestion, catabolism, or presentation of degraded antigens to T cells) is defective. To study this, C3H/HeN mice were bled to an arterial mean blood pressure of 35 mm Hg, maintained for 60 minutes, and then adequately resuscitated. Peritoneal and splenic macrophage cultures were prepared 2 and 24 hours after hemorrhage. Macrophage AP capacity was measured by coculturing macrophages with the T-helper cell clone D10.G4.1. To gain information about macrophage ability to digest the specific antigen conalbumin, lysosomal activity was bypassed by use of chemically denatured conalbumin peptides. To study macrophage ability to present conalbumin peptides, macrophages were fixed and D10.G4.1 proliferation in response to fragmented conalbumin was determined. AP of native conalbumin by peritoneal macrophages and splenic macrophages was depressed (p less than 0.05) by 50% (peritoneal macrophages) and 55% (splenic macrophages) 2 hours and 57% (peritoneal macrophages) and 35% (splenic macrophages) 24 hours after hemorrhage. In contrast, presentation of conalbumin peptides was only slightly decreased. In addition, the ability of fixed peritoneal macrophages and splenic macrophages to present conalbumin peptides was similar in hemorrhaged and sham mice. Because bypassing of macrophage lysosomal activity with degraded native antigens prevented the suppression of AP, the results suggest that hemorrhage-induced suppression of AP is not caused by a reduced macrophage capacity to present antigenic peptides but by decreased antigen catabolism by macrophages. 
An improved palpebral spring for the management of paralytic lagophthalmos. Facial nerve paralysis with orbicularis muscle palsy can result in serious corneal complications, such as exposure, ulceration, and perforation. Eyelid springs have been used for patients with orbicularis muscle palsy to provide corneal protection while maintaining vision by restoring some kinetic eyelid function. The authors report on 24 patients with facial nerve paralysis who underwent implantation of an eyelid spring over a period of 8 years. The most common cause of orbicularis muscle paralysis was acoustic neuroma, followed by squamous cell carcinoma. Eighty-three percent of the cases successfully regained and maintained their eyelid function during the follow-up period, averaging 3.0 years. We have modified the spring to allow permanent attachment to the orbital rim by wiring. This modification of the surgical technique has minimized the most common postoperative complication: loosening of the spring from its periosteal attachment with subsequent loss of function and extrusion. In addition, transcutaneous adjustments of the spring now can be made without an incision using clasp-adjusting dental pliers. In selected patients, the placement of an eyelid spring prevents the corneal complications associated with paralytic lagophthalmos while maintaining visual function. 
Adenosine use during pregnancy. Adenosine is a naturally occurring endogenous nucleoside that suppresses atrioventricular nodal conduction time, terminates supraventricular tachycardia, and restores sinus rhythm. Its use has been reported in children and adults but not in pregnant patients. This case documents the successful termination of a supraventricular tachycardia in a 39-week pregnant hypotensive patient. Emergency physicians may wish to consider adenosine use in pregnant patients needing emergency therapy or when conventional therapy fails. 
Cloning of the gene for a human dopamine D4 receptor with high affinity for the antipsychotic clozapine. Dopamine receptors belong to the family of G protein-coupled receptors. On the basis of the homology between these receptors, three different dopamine receptors (D1, D2, D3) have been cloned. Dopamine receptors are primary targets for drugs used in the treatment of psychomotor disorders such as Parkinson's disease and schizophrenia. In the management of socially withdrawn and treatment-resistant schizophrenics, clozapine is one of the most favoured antipsychotics because it does not cause tardive dyskinesia. Clozapine, however, has dissociation constants for binding to D2 and D3 that are 4 to 30 times the therapeutic free concentration of clozapine in plasma water. This observation suggests the existence of other types of dopamine receptors which are more sensitive to clozapine. Here we report the cloning of a gene that encodes such a receptor (D4). The D4 receptor gene has high homology to the human dopamine D2 and D3 receptor genes. The pharmacological characteristics of this receptor resembles that of the D2 and D3 receptors, but its affinity for clozapine is one order of magnitude higher. Recognition and characterization of this clozapine neuroleptic site may prove useful in the design of new types of drugs. 
Unproven methods of cancer management. Laetrile. "Laetrile" is used interchangeably with "amygdalin" to designate natural substances, derived primarily from apricots and almonds, that can release cyanide, which is lethal to living organisms. In the 1920s, Dr. Ernst T. Krebs, Sr., formulated a theory that amygdalin could kill cancer cells. His theory was inconsistent with biochemical facts and has since been modified at least twice by his son, Ernst T. Krebs, Jr. Extensive work has been done by cancer scientists to test the claim that Laetrile fights cancer. Many animal experiments in the 1970s showed a complete lack of tumor killing by Laetrile. Reviews of the medical records of patients whose cancers were claimed to be reduced or cured after Laetrile treatment found insufficient medical evidence to judge Laetrile's efficacy. Finally, in a clinical trial in cancer patients reported in 1982, Laetrile neither caused shrinkage of tumors, nor increased survival time, nor alleviated cancer symptoms, nor enhanced well-being. Several reports in the medical literature document instances in which Laetrile has caused serious, life-threatening toxicity when taken in large doses in the manner prescribed by Laetrile advocates. In light of the lack of efficacy of Laetrile and its demonstrated ability to cause harm, Laetrile should not be used to treat cancer. 
Pain characterization in cancer patients and the analgetic response to epidural morphine. In 48 patients with pain related to malignancy, a pain characterization was performed during oral opioid therapy. After an optimal epidural morphine regimen had been established, the alteration in pain relief was evaluated by means of a visual analogue scale. The CSF and plasma morphine concentrations at minimum steady state were then analysed in 28 patients and related to the degree of pain relief. The efficacy of the spinal treatment ranked in the following order: somatic greater than visceral greater than radiating = 0, but the difference was only significant between the somatic and radiating pain groups. There was a tendency for continuous pain to be better relieved than intermittent pain. No correlations were found between the CSF or plasma morphine concentrations and the degree of pain relief, suggesting that not all pain impulses are modulated in a dose-dependent manner by morphine at the spinal level. Pain characterization may be instrumental in providing an optimal spinal opioid analgesia in malignancy. Moreover, there is a need for better defined diagnostic criteria for clinical pain characterization. 
Abnormal guanine nucleotide regulatory protein in MVP dysautonomia: evidence from reconstitution of Gs. We and others have used the term MVP dysautonomia for a particular subset of hyperadrenergic dysautonomia patients. The role of the stimulatory guanine nucleotide regulatory protein (Gs) in this dysautonomia was studied by cholate extraction of Gs from erythrocytes from 11 normal subjects and 14 symptomatic dysautonomic patients and reconstitution into cyc-S49 lymphoma membranes, which have normal receptor and adenylyl cyclase but lack Gs. Isoproterenol-stimulated adenylyl cyclase activity in the dysautonomia group was increased compared to that in controls [3.66 +/- 0.20 (mean +/- SE; n = 14) vs. 2.87 +/- 0.14 (n = 11) U cyc- reconstituted activity/mg erythrocyte protein; P less than 0.05]. beta-Adrenergic receptor high affinity state formation was greatest in the severely symptomatic group [KL/KH: severe symptoms, 130 +/- 48 (n = 6); mild symptoms, 33 +/- 7 (n = 7); control, 27 +/- 6 (n = 11); severe dysautonomia distinct, P less than 0.017]. Sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gels of cholera toxin-dependent ADP-ribosylated G-proteins yielded no gross distinction between severely symptomatic and control groups. This subset of hyperadrenergic dysautonomia patients, thus, has supercoupled beta 2-adrenergic receptors (increase in both agonist binding and cyclase activation) conferred by an abnormal Gs, whose effects on agonist binding reflect the severity of illness. 
Diastolic perfusion time at ischemic threshold in patients with stress-induced ischemia BACKGROUND. To evaluate the relevance of diastolic perfusion time on the mechanisms underlying stress-induced ischemia, 16 patients with coronary artery disease and seven patients with syndrome X underwent five randomized stress tests (upright and supine exercise with and without therapy, transesophageal atrial pacing). METHODS AND RESULTS. Exercise duration Time to 0.1 mV ST segment depression, heart rate, rate-pressure product, and diastolic perfusion time were evaluated for each patient during stress tests. In both groups, variability coefficients of the above-mentioned parameters were not different at rest. At ischemic threshold (0.1 mV ST segment depression) in patients with coronary artery disease, the variability coefficient of exercise duration (40.1 +/- 22.2) was significantly higher (p less than 0.0001) than those of heart rate (12.8 +/- 2.9), rate-pressure product (14.8 +/- 3.3), and diastolic perfusion time (0.39 +/- 0.1). The variability coefficient of diastolic perfusion time was also significantly (p less than 0.0001) lower than those of heart rate and rate-pressure product. Similarly, the variability coefficient of diastolic perfusion time (0.44 +/- 0.1) in syndrome X patients was significantly lower (p less than 0.0001) than those of exercise duration (28.2 +/- 9.4), heart rate (12 +/- 1.4), and rate-pressure product (14.6 +/- 1.3). CONCLUSIONS. Fixed diastolic perfusion time at ischemic threshold, despite different kinds of stress tests and variability of heart rate and rate-pressure product, indicates the relevant role of diastolic perfusion time in determining myocardial ischemia. 
Comparison of coronary and myocardial morphologic findings in patients with and without thrombolytic therapy during fatal first acute myocardial infarction. The TIMI Investigators. The hearts of 61 patients (39 men aged 64 +/- 11 years) who died from 5 hours to 42 days (median 3 days) after a fatal first acute myocardial infarction without having undergone percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty or coronary bypass surgery were studied to compare clinical and cardiac morphologic features of patients receiving thrombolytic therapy with tissue-plasminogen activator (t-PA) to those not receiving thrombolytic therapy. Comparison of findings in the 23 patients who received t-PA intravenously 3 +/- 1 hours after onset of symptoms, with the 38 patients who did not, showed similar baseline characteristics with respect to: age, gender, history of hypertension; location of the infarct; heart weight; severity and numbers of coronary arteries narrowed; and frequencies of plaque rupture, plaque hemorrhage and coronary thrombi. Among the patients receiving t-PA, however, there was a greater frequency of platelet-rich (fibrin-poor) thrombi in the infarct-related coronary arteries (6 of 11 vs 4 of 25 thrombi; p = 0.02), more nonocclusive than occlusive thrombi (6 of 11 vs 4 of 25 thrombi; p = 0.02), and a lower frequency of myocardial rupture (left ventricular free wall or ventricular septum) (5 of 23 [22%] vs 18 of 38 [46%]; p = 0.045). 
Testicular abscess caused by Salmonella typhi. This case, which we believe is the first report of a bacteriologically proven infection of the testis by Salmonella typhi, illustrates the occurrence of this complication in the convalescent phase of typhoid fever and the absence of a clinically evident preceding bacteremic phase. The case also emphasizes the need for prolonged antibiotic therapy and the role of surgery in treatment of relapses. 
Involvement of the retinoblastoma gene in primary osteosarcomas and other bone and soft-tissue tumors. The retinoblastoma (Rb) gene, thought by some to be associated with tumor formation of retinoblastoma as a recessive human oncogene, was investigated in 57 cases using DNA and RNA from primary osteosarcomas and other bone and soft-tissue tumors. Eight of 23 osteosarcoma cases (35%) showed structural alterations of the Rb gene. Three of the eight demonstrated homozygous deletions, and the remaining five cases showed heterozygous deletions. Seven out of eight cases represented deletion of a 7.5-kb HindIII fragment. Northern blot analysis of five cases of osteosarcoma showed that four demonstrated no detectable Rb gene transcription, and one case had a truncated 3.5-kb fragment with a faint 4.7-kb band. In the other 34 cases of bone and soft-tissue tumors, two cases of three malignant fibrous histiocytomas showed an Rb gene abnormality by Southern blot analysis. These results strongly suggest that Rb gene alteration is pertinent to the tumorigenesis of most osteosarcoma cases and some other bone and soft-tissue tumors. 
Neuroanatomy in fragile X females: the posterior fossa. The relative homogeneity of the neuropsychiatric phenotype in individuals with fragile (fra) X syndrome suggests that there are consistent central nervous system (CNS) abnormalities underlying the observed cognitive and behavioral abnormalities. In this study, the neuroanatomy of the posterior fossa and other selected CNS regions in 12 young fra X females were compared with those of a group of 12 age-, sex-, and IQ-matched females without evidence of the fra X syndrome. Fra X females were shown to have decreased size of the posterior cerebellar vermis and increased size of the fourth ventricle, findings that are identical to those previously reported for fra X males. When compared with fra X male and nonfra X control groups, the distribution of the posterior-vermis and fourth-ventricle variables for the fra X female group was intermediate. These results support the hypothesis that the fra X genetic abnormality leads to hypoplasia of the posterior cerebellar vermis, a neuroanatomical variation of potential importance to both developmental and neuropsychiatric syndromes. 
Multihormonal regulation of insulin-like growth factor-binding protein-1 in rat H4IIE hepatoma cells: the dominant role of insulin. Circulating levels of insulin-like growth factor-binding protein-1 (IGFBP-1) and the abundance of hepatic IGFBP-1 mRNA are increased in streptozotocin-diabetic rats and are regulated in accordance with insulin and metabolic status. We recently purified rat IGFBP-1 from medium conditioned by well differentiated rat H4IIE hepatoma cells. Since this cell line provides a useful model for examining the effects of hormones on hepatocellular function, we used H4IIE cells to examine the relative role that insulin and other factors may play in the regulation of IGFBP-1 production. H4IIE cells were stabilized in serum-free medium, then treated with specific hormones. The availability of IGFBPs in conditioned medium was estimated by [125I]IGF-I binding assay, and specific BPs were assessed by Western ligand and immunoblot analyses. The abundance of IGFBP-1 mRNA was determined by Northern and slot blot analysis. Initial studies revealed that [125I]IGF-I-binding activity in conditioned medium was reduced after 24-h incubation with 100 nM insulin (52 +/- 4% of control; P less than 0.001). In contrast, binding activity was increased after only 4 h of incubation with 75 microM 8-(4-chlorophenylthio)cAMP (8-CPT-cAMP) or 1 microM dexamethasone (P less than 0.001 vs. control for each), but these effects were prevented by insulin. Ligand and immunoblotting demonstrated that insulin decreased the production of 32K and 34K forms of IGFBP-1, while both 8-CPT-cAMP and dexamethasone increased the production of IGFBP-1; again, insulin prevented the effects of 8-CPT-cAMP and dexamethasone. Of note, 1 microM rat GH, testosterone, progesterone, or 17 beta-estradiol had no effect on either IGF-binding activity or IGFBP-1 production. Northern and slot blot analyses revealed that 100 nM insulin profoundly lowered the abundance of IGFBP-1 mRNA in H4IIE cells (4 +/- 0.6% of control at 4 h; P less than 0.001), while IGFBP-1 mRNA was increased 2-fold during incubation with 75 microM 8-CPT-cAMP (P less than 0.001) and 9-fold with 1 microM dexamethasone (P less than 0.001). Once again, the effect of insulin was dominant; insulin both prevented and reversed the effects of maximally effective concentrations of 8-CPT-cAMP and dexamethasone. To determine whether this effect of insulin reflected altered generation or stability of IGFBP-1 mRNA, H4IIE cells were incubated with 2.5 micrograms/ml actinomycin-D with or without insulin, and mRNA was quantitated by Northern blot.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS). 
Survival of DNA HLA-DR typed and matched cadaver kidney transplants. The Collaborative Transplant Study. The clinical value of serological HLA matching for cadaver kidney transplantation remains uncertain because the success rate for HLA-matched cadaver transplants is lower than that of HLA-matched sibling grafts. Up to 25% of serological HLA-DR typings may be incorrect when compared with a more accurate DNA-RFLP method, and we have now examined whether incorrect HLA-DR typings account for the lower than expected success rates of HLA-matched cadaver transplants. 58 transplant centres took part in this study and DNA was extracted from over 4000 samples of frozen tissue at the study centre. 8 laboratories then completed blind RFLP typing for HLA-DR. Serological typing data were reported by individual transplant laboratories. 29 of 107 transplants (27%) that were reported as HLA A, B, DR compatible and 76 of 273 (28%) transplants that were reported as HLA B, DR compatible according to serological typing were found to be HLA-DR mismatched by DNA typing. The one-year transplant success rate for DNA-matched HLA, A, B, DR grafts was 87% compared with 69% for mismatched grafts (p less than 0.02); the corresponding success rate for DNA-matched HLA B, DR grafts was 85% compared with 72% for mismatched grafts (p less than 0.01). Many transplants that were previously thought to be HLA matched are mismatched, and this finding may account for previously unexplained graft failures. 
Oestrogen and androgen states in oligo-amenorrhoeic women with polycystic ovaries. Oestrogen and androgen states have been studied in relation to ovarian morphology defined by ultrasonography in 65 women with oligo-amenorrhoea. Of the 48 women with polycystic ovaries (PCO), 44 (92%) had a withdrawal bleed following progestogen challenge (indicating oestrogenization) compared with just three (18%) of the 17 with non-PCO (P less than 0.001). Median serum concentrations of oestradiol and oestrone were statistically significantly higher in the PCO group but the ranges overlapped widely. Of the four women with PCO but oestrogen deficiency, two were hirsute and had evidence of a severe form of the disorder. The other two were not hirsute and appeared to have hypothalamic dysfunction associated with weight loss overriding the disorder due to pre-existing PCO. Compared with the non-PCO group, the PCO subgroup without hirsutism (n = 31) had statistically significantly higher median values of LH, testosterone, androstenedione, and dehydroepiandrosterone sulphate concentrations, and free androgen index. Concentrations of androgen, but not LH, were significantly higher still in the PCO subgroup with hirsutism (n = 17). 
Nonpalpable breast lesions: stereotactic automated large-core biopsies. One hundred two patients with mammographically suspicious, nonpalpable lesions underwent stereotactic breast biopsy with a biopsy gun and an automated 14-gauge cutting needle. After biopsy, a localization wire was placed and surgical biopsy performed. There was agreement of the histologic results from the gun biopsy and the surgical biopsy specimens in 98 cases (96%), including 22 of 23 carcinomas (96%) (kappa = 0.936). The gun biopsy yielded findings that led to the correct diagnosis in two cases involving lesions that were missed at surgical biopsy; two lesions found at surgery were missed at gun biopsy. The results of this study suggest that the use of 14-gauge needles improves agreement between surgical and needle core biopsy findings and that stereotactic biopsy with an automated needle and gun can be an acceptable alternative to surgical biopsy in women with mammographically suspicious breast lesions. 
The perception of angina in diabetes: relation to somatic pain threshold and autonomic function. Silent ischemia is common in diabetic patients with coronary heart disease. These patients may also have more subtle alteration in the perception of angina as reflected by prolongation of anginal perceptual threshold--the time from onset of 0.1 mV ST segment depression to the onset of chest pain during treadmill exercise. Silent ischemia may be associated with a generalized hyposensitivity to pain, although the pathophysiologic mechanism is obscure. The purpose of the present study was to determine whether diabetic patients with prolonged anginal perceptual thresholds are also hyposensitive to painful stimuli and to investigate whether this is associated with autonomic neuropathy. Nineteen diabetic and 25 nondiabetic patients with exertional angina were exercised on a treadmill to measure anginal perceptual threshold. Somatic pain threshold was measured by calf sphygmomanometry. The cuff was inflated rapidly until pain occurred, and six repeat inflations were done to test reproducibility. Because there was no significant difference between measurements (coefficient of variation = 0.156) the mean value for each patient provided a measure of somatic pain threshold. The diabetic group had a longer anginal perceptual threshold (138 +/- 64 seconds vs 34 +/- 51 seconds, p less than 0.001), which correlated positively with the somatic pain threshold (r = 0.5, p = 0.03); patients with more prolonged anginal perceptual thresholds tended to have higher somatic pain thresholds. In the diabetic group anginal perceptual (r = -0.3, p = NS) and somatic pain (r = -0.4, p = 0.05) thresholds tended to increase as the ratio of peak to minimal heart rate during the Valsalva maneuver fell below 1.21, but these variables were unrelated in the nondiabetic group. 
Systolic ejection murmurs in the elderly: aortic valve and carotid arteries echo-Doppler findings. Two-dimensional echographic and color Doppler studies of the heart and carotid arteries (CA) were performed in 45 patients greater than sixty-five years old without aortic stenosis, 23 with (Group 1) and 22 without (group 2) precordial ejection systolic murmur (SM). Aortic cusps thickening was found in 11 Group 1 (48%) and 2 Group 2 (9%) patients (p less than 0.001). Aortic root and aortic arch size were similar in the two groups. Maximum aortic flow velocity was significantly greater in Group 1 (200 60 cm/sec) than in Group 2 (120 20 cm/sec) (p less than 0.001). Left ventricular outflow systolic maximum velocity was similar in the two groups. A bilateral neck murmur was heard in 10/23 Group 1 patients (43%); in this group, patients with cervical SM had a greater maximum aortic flow velocity than those without cervical SM (230 + 60 cm/sec vs 172 + 32 cm/sec, p less than 0.001). In Group 1, 3 patients had a cervical SM louder on one neck side; only in these 3 patients were ipsilateral obstructive CA plaques found. A unilateral neck SM was heard in 4/22 Group 2 patients (18%); in these 4, ipsilateral obstructive CA were found. Conclusions: (1) in the elderly, precordial ejection SM is related to mild increase in maximum aortic flow velocity and thickening of aortic cusps; (2) in patients with precordial SM radiated to both neck sides, maximum aortic flow velocity tends to be more markedly increased; (3) in patients with precordial SM, a cervical SM louder on one neck side should suggest coexistent ipsilateral CA stenosis. 
I-TevI, the endonuclease encoded by the mobile td intron, recognizes binding and cleavage domains on its DNA target. Mobility of the phage T4 td intron depends on activity of an intron-encoded endonuclease (I-TevI), which cleaves a homologous intronless (delta In) target gene. The double-strand break initiates a recombination event that leads to intron transfer. We found previously that I-TevI cleaves td delta In target DNA 23-26 nucleotides upstream of the intron insertion site. DNase I-footprinting experiments and gel-shift assays indicate that I-TevI makes primary contacts around the intron insertion site. A synthetic DNA duplex spanning the insertion site but lacking the cleavage site was shown to bind I-TevI specifically, and when cloned, to direct cleavage into vector sequences. The behavior of the cloned duplex and that of deletion and insertion mutants support a primary role for sequences surrounding the insertion site in directing I-TevI binding, conferring cleavage ability, and determining cleavage polarity. On the other hand, sequences around the cleavage site were shown to influence cleavage efficiency and cut-site selection. The role of cleavage-site sequences in determining cleavage distance argues against a strict "ruler" mechanism for cleavage by I-TevI. The complex nature of the homing site recognized by this unusual type of endonuclease is considered in the context of intron spread. 
Neobladder construction using completely detubularized sigmoid colon after radical cystoprostatectomy. To improve the quality of life of the patient we used completely detubularized sigmoid colon for bladder reconstruction along with radical cystoprostatectomy in 6 men with invasive bladder cancer. Followup was 8 to 20 months. Postoperatively, all of the patients were continent during the day but only 4 (66.7%) were continent at night, although they had to awaken twice to remain dry. Neocystourethroscopy in 4 of the 6 patients revealed no tumor and no stricture at the urethrocolonic anastomosis. However, a stone in the neobladder was found in 1 patients. Urodynamic study of the neobladder showed a low pressure (mean 16.7 cm. water) at the filling phase of water cystometry and an adequate maximal urethral closure pressure (mean 52.0 cm. water) and functional profile length (mean 3.8 cm.). The uroflow rate in all patients was good (1 patient even had a maximal uroflow rate of 31 ml. per second). There was no reflux in any patient. One patient had intestinal obstruction 5 months postoperatively and died 5 months later of widespread metastasis. The remaining 5 patients are alive with a satisfactory quality of life. In conclusion, use of completely detubularized sigmoid colon may be an ideal operation for neobladder construction after radical cystoprostatectomy. 
Entrapment of a cat in a new-style pet food container. Although many regulations exist to protect human consumers from hazardous products, there are no comparable safeguards for products intended for pet use. The authors describe a case in which a new-style cat food container presented a hazard to pets. 
Fetal supraventricular tachycardia and hydrops fetalis: combined intensive, direct, and transplacental therapy. A 25-week fetus with severe hydrops fetalis secondary to supraventricular tachycardia was treated with fetal intramuscular injections of digoxin in conjunction with maternal intravenous digoxin, followed by oral digoxin and subsequently by oral procainamide therapy. Fetal umbilical blood sampling revealed poor placental transfer of digoxin, even after 2 weeks of therapeutic maternal levels. This case suggests that direct fetal therapy is of value in the treatment of some fetuses with supraventricular tachycardia, and lends further evidence that the role of transplacental digoxin therapy is limited in the compromised fetus. It also demonstrates that resolution of hydrops may require a prolonged period. 
Superiority of granisetron to dexamethasone plus prochlorperazine in the prevention of chemotherapy-induced emesis. Trials of selective 5-hydroxytryptamine3 receptor antagonists have shown excellent antiemetic activity for chemotherapy containing cisplatin when compared with high-dose metoclopramide. There is little information about the efficacy of these new agents for chemotherapy other than for high-dose cisplatin. We performed a double-blind, randomized trial comparing a single dose of the 5-hydroxytryptamine3 receptor antagonist granisetron (BRL 43694A) as a single intravenous dose with dexamethasone plus prochlorperazine in 152 patients receiving their first course of moderately emetogenic chemotherapy (mainly doxorubicin- and cyclophosphamide-containing combinations). During the first 24 hours, there was a statistically significant advantage for the granisetron group in terms of the prevention of both nausea and emesis. There was no difference in the frequency of reported adverse events. We conclude that granisetron is more effective than dexamethasone plus prochlorperazine in patients who are receiving moderately emetogenic cytotoxic agents. 
The Damus-Stansel-Kaye procedure: anatomical determinants and modifications. Seven of 119 patients undergoing anatomical correction for transposition of the great arteries and Taussig-Bing anomalies without pulmonary stenosis had the Damus-Stansel-Kaye procedure and the rest, the arterial switch. The age of the patients having the Damus-Stansel-Kaye procedure ranged from 0.5 year to 5 years (mean age, 2.2 +/- 1 years). Four patients had transposition, 2 had Taussig-Bing anomaly, and 1 had corrected transposition. Indications for the Damus-Stansel-Kaye procedure were side-by-side great arteries associated with difficult coronary anatomy (5 patients), single coronary system (1 patient), and subaortic stenosis (1). A graft between the ascending and descending aorta for interrupted aortic arch made mobilization and posterior displacement of the ascending aorta for the arterial switch difficult. Subaortic stenosis (1 patient), subpulmonary ventricular septal defect (2 patients), and restrictive ventricular septal defect (4) precluded the Rastelli procedure. In 6 patients, the main pulmonary artery was transected at the band, a proximal main pulmonary artery to aorta anastomosis was complemented with a synthetic patch, and a right ventricle to distal main pulmonary artery valved conduit was inserted. Four patients had closure of the aortic outflow. Two patients had postoperative bleeding and 2, heart block. The only patient who did not have transection of the main pulmonary artery, an omission that led to an obstructed conduit at the distal anastomosis, died late. Two patients subsequently needed aortic outflow closure for critical aortic insufficiency. The Damus-Stansel-Kaye procedure has a definite role and can be safely performed in patients with transposition of the great arteries and Taussig-Bing anomalies. 
Low molecular weight heparin (enoxaparin) reduces restenosis after iliac angioplasty in the hypercholesterolemic rabbit. Smooth muscle cell proliferation is central to the process of restenosis. Attempts to inhibit the events leading to this proliferation have met with little success. In addition to its known antithrombotic effects, heparin also has inhibitory effects on smooth muscle cell proliferation. These effects appear to be unrelated to its anticoagulant properties and are retained in low molecular weight heparin derivatives. Although the use of heparin for as long as 18 to 24 h after coronary angioplasty in humans has not prevented restenosis, longer treatment periods have not been assessed. This study examines the effect of treatment with a low molecular weight heparin (enoxaparin) in a hypercholesterolemic rabbit iliac artery model. Control rabbits had a mean iliac artery diameter of 0.70 +/- 0.06 mm, which increased to 1.73 +/- 0.09 mm after balloon angioplasty. At follow-up angiography 4 weeks later, the mean vessel diameter was 0.56 +/- 0.12 mm. Animals treated with low dose enoxaparin (1 mg/kg per day) for 4 weeks and high dose enoxaparin (10 mg/kg per day) for either 2 or 4 weeks had similar mean luminal diameters before and immediately after angioplasty. At follow-up angiography, the mean luminal diameter was 0.82 +/- 0.17 mm for low dose enoxaparin, 1.04 +/- 0.20 mm for 2 week high dose enoxaparin (p = 0.03 versus control) and 1.19 +/- 0.09 mm for 4 week high dose enoxaparin (p = 0.001 versus control). When defined as loss of 50% of the initial gain achieved with angioplasty, restenosis was found in all control vessels. 
Post-herpetic neuralgia: further post-mortem studies of cases with and without pain. The pathological features associated with post-herpetic neuralgia require further study. We report here 5 cases, 3 with severe post-herpetic neuralgia (PHN) and 2 with no persistent pain. The findings of dorsal horn atrophy and cell, axon and myelin loss with fibrosis in the sensory ganglion were found only in patients with persistent pain. Marked loss of myelin and axons in the nerve and/or sensory root were found in cases with and without pain. Some evidence is presented for a more generalized subacute or chronic inflammatory process which may explain the clinical features of some patients. Further studies will be necessary to fully describe the morbid anatomy of this disorder. 
Gonadal vein thrombosis in patients with acute gastrointestinal inflammation: diagnosis with CT. During a 31-month period, evidence of gonadal vein thrombosis (GVT) was demonstrated by computed tomography (CT) in seven patients who had a broad spectrum of acute gastrointestinal inflammatory lesions, including diverticulitis, ulcerative colitis, Crohn disease, appendicitis with abscess, and perforated appendix with pseudomembranous colitis. All patients had lower abdominal pain, tenderness, fever, and leukocytosis. CT demonstrated thrombus through the length of the gonadal vein in each patient; the entire lumen of the vein was filled. No symptoms relating to GVT were present. GVT may resolve with treatment of the underlying enteric disease alone, and anticoagulant therapy may not be necessary. 
High energy neutron treatment for pelvic cancers: study stopped because of increased mortality. OBJECTIVE--To compare high energy fast neutron treatment with conventional megavoltage x ray treatment in the management of locally advanced pelvic carcinomas (of the cervix, bladder, prostate, and rectum). DESIGN--Randomised study from February 1986; randomisation to neutron treatment or photon treatment was unstratified and in the ratio of 3 to 1 until January 1988, when randomisation was in the ratio 1 to 1 and stratified by site of tumour. SETTING--Mersey regional radiotherapy centre at Clatterbridge Hospital, Wirral. PATIENTS--151 patients with locally advanced, non-metastatic pelvic cancer (27 cervical, 69 of the bladder, seven prostatic, and 48 of the rectum). INTERVENTION--Randomisation to neutron treatment was stopped in February 1990. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES--Patient survival and causes of death in relation to the development of metastatic disease and treatment related morbidity. RESULTS--In the first phase of the trial 42 patients were randomised to neutron treatment and 14 to photon treatment, and in the second phase 48 to neutron treatment and 47 to photon treatment. The relative risk of mortality for photons compared with neutrons was 0.66 (95% confidence interval 0.40 to 1.10) after adjustment for site of tumour and other important prognostic factors. Short term and long term complications were similar in both groups. CONCLUSIONS--The trial was stopped because of the increased mortality in patients with cancer of the cervix, bladder, or rectum treated with neutrons. 
Noninvasive face mask mechanical ventilation in patients with acute hypercapnic respiratory failure. Mechanically assisted intermittent positive-pressure ventilation effectively provides ventilatory support in patients with respiratory failure but it requires placing an artificial airway. We have previously reported our successful experience delivering mechanical ventilation via a face mask (FMMV) rather than with an endotracheal tube in a pilot study of patients with acute respiratory failure. The present investigation evaluated an additional 18 patients with hypercapnic respiratory failure to determine the efficacy of FMMV in a more homogeneous group and to determine factors predicting its success. FMMV was successful in avoiding intubation in 13 of the 18 patients. A significant initial improvement in PCO2 (greater than 16 percent decrease) and in pH (from less than 7.30 to greater than 7.30) predicted success. The five patients who failed on FMMV required endotracheal intubation because of inability to improve gas exchange (three patients), apnea due to sedatives (one patient), and management of secretions (one patient). FMMV was generally well accepted with only two patients withdrawn because of intolerance of the mask. The mean duration of FMMV was 25 h. Complications were seen in only two patients (11 percent): aspiration (one patient) and mild skin necrosis (one patient). Seven patients entered the study by meeting entrance criteria after an unsuccessful extubation attempt and therefore received both forms of mechanical ventilation. All but one patient avoided reintubation, and the face mask proved to be as effective as the endotracheal tube as a conduit for delivering the mechanical tidal volume and improving gas exchange. Our findings indicate that FMMV is a viable option for short-term (one to four days) ventilatory support of patients with hypercapnic respiratory failure and insufficiency. 
Evaluation of combination thrombolytic therapy and timing of cardiac catheterization in acute myocardial infarction. Results of thrombolysis and angioplasty in myocardial infarction--phase 5 randomized trial. TAMI Study Group Recent trials of myocardial reperfusion using single-agent thrombolytic therapy and sequential cardiac catheterization have supported a conservative approach to the patient with acute myocardial infarction. To evaluate combination thrombolytic therapy and the role of a previously untested strategy for the aggressive use of cardiac catheterization, we performed a multicenter clinical trial with a 3 x 2 factorial design in which 575 patients were randomly allocated to one of three drug regimens--tissue-type plasminogen activator (t-PA) (n = 191), urokinase (n = 190), or both (n = 194) - and one of two catheterization strategies--immediate catheterization with angioplasty for failed thrombolysis (n = 287) or deferred predischarge catheterization on days 5-10 (n = 288). Patients with contraindications to thrombolytic therapy, cardiogenic shock, or age of more than 75 years were excluded. Global left ventricular ejection fraction was well preserved and almost identical at predischarge catheterization (54%), regardless of the catheterization or thrombolytic strategy used (p = 0.98). Combination thrombolytic therapy was associated with a less complicated clinical course, most clearly documented by a lower rate of reocclusion (2%) compared with urokinase (7%) and t-PA (12%) (p = 0.04) and a lower rate of recurrent ischemia (25%) compared with urokinase (35%) and t-PA (31%). When a composite clinical end point (e.g., death, stroke, reinfarction, reocclusion, heart failure, or recurrent ischemia) was examined, combination thrombolytic therapy was associated with greater freedom from any adverse event (68%) compared with either single agent (urokinase, 55%; t-PA, 60%) (p = 0.04) and with a less complicated clinical course when the composite clinical end points were ranked according to clinical severity (p = 0.024). Early patency rates were greater with combination therapy, although predischarge patency rates after considering interventions to maintain patency were similar among drug regimens. No difference in bleeding complication rates was observed with any thrombolytic regimen. The aggressive catheterization strategy led to an overall early patency rate of 96% and a predischarge patency rate of 94% compared with a 90% predischarge patency in the conservative strategy (p = 0.065). The aggressive strategy improved regional wall motion in the infarct region (-2.16 SDs/chord) compared with deferred catheterization (-2.49 SDs/chord) (p = 0.004). More patients treated with the aggressive strategy were free from adverse outcomes (67% versus 55% in the conservative strategy, p = 0.004), and the clinical course was less complicated when the adverse outcomes were ranked according to severity (p = 0.016). No significant increase in use of blood products resulted from the aggressive strategy.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS). 
Colonoscopically guided tube decompression in Ogilvie's syndrome. Ogilvie's syndrome (pseudo-obstruction of the colon) may result in gangrene and perforation of the colon if not effectively treated. Colonoscopic decompression and endoscopically guided rectal tube placement were employed to treat five patients with this syndrome who had failed medical therapy. All patients tolerated the procedure well and required no further treatment. 
Introducing an acute pain service. An acute pain service in a new district general hospital is described. We have reported incidence of severe pain, common postoperative anaesthetic problems and patient satisfaction in relation to the analgesic technique. Over half the patients were treated by intermittent intramuscular injection of opioid, but increase in the use of continuous intravenous therapy and in particular patient-controlled analgesia, was welcomed by both medical and nursing staff. 
Specific triggering of gamma, delta T cells by K562 activates the gamma, delta T cell receptor and may regulate natural killer-like function. Freshly isolated and resting gamma/delta T cell lines, although capable of lysing a variety of MHC-unrestricted targets, fail to lyse K562. Yet, the killing of K562 can be specifically induced by antibodies to CD3 or delta-chains. Although this phenomenon may be caused by redirected lysis, it also raised the possibility that K562 may possess ligands capable of specifically interacting with the gamma/delta receptor. We found that K562 specifically induced both CD3 and delta modulation as well as IL-2R expression and IL-2 production by gamma/delta cells, supporting the idea that the TCR-gamma/delta is specifically triggered by K562 cells. Moreover, although the gamma/delta cell clones lysed other target cells (e.g., Molt 4, U937, Jurkat etc.), these latter targets did not induce delta modulation or IL-2R expression. In addition, F(ab)2 anti-CD3 antibodies inhibited activated gamma/delta T cells from killing K562 but did not inhibit the lysis of the other targets. Taken together, these results suggest that gamma/delta cells lyse some targets by utilizing receptors (perhaps NK-like) distinct from the gamma/delta receptor. We also found that triggering of the gamma/delta receptor by K562 inhibited the capacity of resting gamma/delta to lyse Molt 4 cells under conditions in which the K562 cells were not lysed. These findings suggest that the gamma/delta receptor maybe directly involved in the lysis of certain targets (i.e., K562) and, importantly, may potentially regulate the function of NK-like receptors that are involved in the lysis of other targets. 
Modified Indiana pouch. The modified continent Indiana pouch is based upon the terminal 8 to 12 cm. of ileum and 26 to 30 cm. of right colon. Our modifications include complete detubularization of the colonic segment with an easier appendectomy, a transcolonic ureteral reimplantation that is technically simple and reinforced plication of the ileocecal junction. This procedure was performed in 70 patients (ages 27 to 85 years) with followup ranging between 3 and 24 months. There have been 5 hospitalizations for urinary tract infections or gastrointestinal complications. Open surgical revision (4%) has been necessary for incontinence in 1 case, for a redundant ileal limb and difficult catheterization in 1, and for ureteral stenosis in the mid portion of the left ureter in 1. A revision procedure is pending for inadequate reservoir volume. Endoscopic meatotomy of ureterocolonic junction strictures has been necessary in 2 cases. All patients are continent day and night with easy catheterization of volumes ranging between 400 and 800 cc. The modified Indiana pouch should be considered for any patient requiring cutaneous urinary diversion because of a low complication and revision rate, and an excellent continence rate. 
Gastrostomy tube transmigration: a rare cause of small bowel obstruction. A 77-year-old woman with an indwelling gastrostomy tube presented with a clinical picture of pneumonia and small bowel obstruction. During gastrostomy closure and performance of a feeding jejunostomy, inadvertent transmigration of the gastrostomy tube was found to be the etiology of the small intestinal obstruction. This case illustrates a rare complication of enteric feeding tubes. 
Colovesical fistula secondary to vesical gangrene in a diabetic patient. We present a case of colovesical fistula secondary to vesical gangrene. Precipitating factors were diabetes and vesical distension caused by the obstruction of an indwelling catheter. This complication is an exceptional outcome in gangrenous cystitis and it requires emergency surgical treatment. 
Prognosis in AZT myopathy. The myopathy caused by zidovudine (AZT) appears to be common but is incompletely characterized, particularly regarding prognosis. Twenty patients with HIV infection developed a necrotizing myopathy while taking AZT for 9 to 30 months. Ten presented with myalgia and 17 with proximal muscle weakness. Serum CK was elevated in all (two to 11 times normal), and EMG suggested active myopathy in all but two. There were scattered granular degenerating fibers, with scant or no inflammation, in a pattern consistent with a toxic myopathy in all 18 patients biopsied. Three patients with an HIV-related inflammatory myopathy were distinguished by histologic differences. After stopping AZT (n = 15), myalgia promptly resolved (10 of 10). Strength improved more slowly with 12 of 15 regaining normal or nearly normal strength, but three have persistent weakness. CK returned to normal in 12 of 15, and follow-up EMG (n = 11) documented reduced fibrillation density in all 11 patients. These findings underscore the need for early diagnosis of this reversible myopathy. 
Somatostatin cerebrospinal fluid levels in dementia. Somatostatin levels were measured in cerebrospinal fluid of patients with Alzheimer's disease, multi-infarct dementia and normal pressure hydrocephalus and compared with levels from a normal control group. All pathological groups showed a statistically significant decrease of somatostatin with respect to the control group, but no significant differences were found amongst them. A negative correlation was found between the Mini Mental State Test and the somatostatin levels in Alzheimer's disease patients but not in the other groups. Our results confirm that the lower levels of somatostatin in cerebrospinal fluid are not specific to Alzheimer's disease and indicate that the decrease found in all the groups is probably the result of neuronal destruction or damage in the diseases examined. 
Human acid maltase-deficient myogenic cell transformation with origin-defective SV40: characterization of a cloned line. A clonal human skeletal muscle cell line showing acid maltase deficiency (AMD) was established through the transfection of origin-defective SV40 DNA. The low acid alpha-glucosidase activity and glycogenosomes in this clone corresponded to AMD. This clone, in spite of loading glycogenososmes, was competent not only as to proliferation without contact inhibition but also as to myogenic differentiation to some extent. Dexamethasone promoted the formation by the transformant of multinucleated myotubes, which expressed acetylcholine receptors. The existence of glycogenosomes did not seem to affect the proliferation or differentiation of myoblasts. The aberrant acid alpha-glucosidase expressed in the transformed myogenic clone was shown to be biochemically identical to that in AMD fibroblasts. This transformant should be of great value for investigating the pathogenesis of AMD because of the possibility of supplying semi-permanently a uniform myogenic cell line expressing AMD. 
Late onset Krabbe's leukodystrophy: a report of four cases. Four cases of late-onset Krabbe's leukodystrophy had varying clinical features. One sibling became wheelchair-bound while another leads an active working life. The computed tomography (CT) scan of a third patient showed occipital demyelination with contrast enhancement identical to that seen in an adrenoleucodystrophy. The fourth was the only patient with peripheral neuropathy. All patients had enzyme activity comparable to the classic infantile-onset form. 
MIDAS, the Multicenter Isradipine/Diuretic Atherosclerosis Study. Design features and baseline data. The Multicenter Isradipine/Diuretic Atherosclerosis Study (MIDAS) is a randomized, double-blind, active-control trial to compare the effectiveness of two treatment regimens for the control of hypertension in reducing the rate of progression of early extracranial carotid artery atherosclerosis in hypertensive patients. The two double-blind treatment regimens are 2.5 or 5 mg isradipine twice daily and 12.5 mg or 25 mg hydrochlorothiazide twice daily. Patients whose blood pressure is not controlled with either of these regimens will receive, in addition to the highest tolerated dose of the blinded drug, 2.5 to 10 mg open-label enalapril twice daily. The MIDAS study has enrolled 883 patients to treatment with either isradipine or hydrochlorothiazide. Inclusion criteria included men and women over the age of 40 years, the presence of an atherosclerotic lesion in the extracranial carotid artery demonstrated on B-mode ultrasound scanning (maximum thickness between 1.3 and 3.5 mm), an average sitting diastolic blood pressure between 90 and 115 mm Hg, and low-density lipoprotein levels between 130 and 189 mg/dL. An assessment of each patient's blood pressure and any side effects is made every three months; a B-mode ultrasound examination of the carotid arteries was performed at baseline and every six months thereafter; an electrocardiogram was carried out at baseline and once a year thereafter; and a brief quality-of-life assessment was made at baseline and every year thereafter. 
Abnormal platelet and lymphocyte calcium handling in prehypertensive rats. We have reported that the basal and stimulated cytosolic free calcium concentrations [( Ca2+]i) are elevated in platelets isolated from 12-14-week-old spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) as compared with normotensive Wistar-Kyoto (WKY) rats. To determine whether altered cell calcium metabolism precedes the development of overt hypertension, we measured [Ca2+]i under resting and stimulated conditions in blood platelets and thymic lymphocytes isolated from 4-week-old prehypertensive SHR and WKY rats. Blood pressure was similar in both groups (SHR 95 +/- 8 versus WKY rats 92 +/- 7 mm Hg). Basal [Ca2+]i in platelets was higher in SHR than WKY rats (63.4 +/- 3.9 versus 54.8 +/- 3.1 nM, p less than 0.003). Also the [Ca2+]i response to thrombin was greater in SHR than WKY rats in both the presence and absence of extracellular calcium. For lymphocytes, although no difference was detected in basal [Ca2+]i, the concanavalin A-induced peak [Ca2+]i was higher for SHR than WKY rats in both calcium-containing and calcium-free media. These results suggest that agonist-stimulated calcium influx and calcium discharge from intracellular stores are enhanced in both platelets and lymphocytes of 4-week-old SHR. We conclude that abnormalities in calcium metabolism in two different cell types precede the development of overt hypertension in the SHR. 
Mutations in the precore region of hepatitis B virus DNA in patients with fulminant and severe hepatitis BACKGROUND. The presence of the hepatitis B e antigen (HBeAg) in serum is known to be a marker of a high degree of viral infectivity. However, fulminant hepatitis may occur in persons who are negative for HBeAg. A single point mutation has been reported to produce a stop codon in the precore region of hepatitis B virus DNA and prevent the formation of the precore protein required to make HBeAg. To determine whether a precore-mutant virus is causally related to severe liver injury, we analyzed the entire precore region in viral strains isolated from patients with fatal cases and uncomplicated cases of hepatitis B. METHODS. Serum was obtained from 9 patients with fatal hepatitis B (5 with fulminant and 4 with severe exacerbations of chronic hepatitis) and 10 patients with acute, self-limited hepatitis B. Serum samples from a sex partner implicated as the source of the virus in one case of fulminant hepatitis were also studied. The 87 nucleotides in the precore region of the hepatitis B virus were amplified by the polymerase chain reaction and then directly sequenced. RESULTS. Of the nine patients with fatal hepatitis, seven had retrievable hepatitis B DNA. In all seven there was a point mutation from G to A at nucleotide 1896 of the precore region, converting tryptophan (TGG) to a stop codon (TAG). In contrast, this mutation was not found in the 10 patients with acute, self-limited hepatitis B. The hepatitis B DNA from the implicated source contained a sequence with the stop-codon mutation that was identical to the sequence in her partner, who had fulminant hepatitis. CONCLUSIONS. The presence of a mutant viral strain is associated with and may be involved in the pathogenesis of fulminant hepatitis B and severe exacerbations of chronic hepatitis B. 
The place of oophorectomy at vaginal hysterectomy. A series of 740 vaginal hysterectomies with attempted vaginal oophorectomy is presented and compared with 700 vaginal hysterectomies without oophorectomy. Vaginal oophorectomy was successful in 94% of the patients. Factors influencing the success include obesity, nulliparity, decreased vaginal access and space, lack of uterine descent, increased uterine size and tubo-ovarian disease. These have been analysed and the recognition and management of technical difficulties are described. There was no morbidity attributable to the vaginal oophorectomy. With experience and appropriate technique suitable women can be offered prophylactic oophorectomy at the time of vaginal hysterectomy. 
Hemostasis activation during esophageal variceal sclerotherapy with thrombin in cirrhotics. Sclerotherapy of bleeding esophageal varices in liver cirrhotics is a common procedure, but little is known about the possible entry of sclerosants into the systemic circulation. We injected a mixture of thrombin, sodium tetradecyl, and cefazolin and studied the effect of this sclerosant on selected hemostasis parameters. Twenty-four patients with liver cirrhosis (Child's Classification C) were studied 29 times. Blood samples were drawn before and immediately after the injection of the sclerosant. In seven patients we collected a sample 30 minutes and 24 hours after treatment. Before injection, almost all patients had elevated D-dimer, t-PA and PAI-1 levels. Fibrinogen, antithrombin, alpha-2 antiplasmin, and protein C were decreased. Only thrombin/antithrombin III complex (TAT) levels were within normal ranges. Immediately after the injection, TAT, D-dimer, and t-PA levels rose significantly (P less than 0.001, P less than 0.01, P less than 0.001), PAI-1 and PC levels decreased (P less than 0.01), while antithrombin, alpha-2 antiplasmin, and fibrinogen concentrations were unchanged. TAT and D-dimer levels were still elevated after 24 hours (P less than 0.05). These data indicate that thrombin entered the systemic circulation (elevated TAT) and that the hemostasis system was briefly systemically activated (elevated D-dimer). In spite of these changes in the hemostasis system, clinically there were no detectable thrombotic or hemorrhagic complications. 
Electrophysiologic and electrocardiographic effects, efficacy and safety of encainide in malignant ventricular arrhythmias associated with coronary artery disease. The electrophysiologic and electrocardiographic effects, efficacy and safety of encainide were evaluated in 48 patients with coronary artery disease undergoing programmed stimulation for ventricular tachyarrhythmias. The study group included 41 men and 7 women, aged 64 +/- 8 years (mean +/- standard deviation), who had presented with nonsustained ventricular tachycardia (VT) (4 patients), sustained VT (32), ventricular fibrillation (8) or unexplained syncope (4). The left ventricular ejection fraction averaged 34 +/- 13%. The arrhythmias induced at the baseline, drug-free electrophysiologic study included nonsustained VT in 8 patients, sustained VT in 35 and ventricular fibrillation in 5. All patients had failed greater than or equal to 1 class IA and a combination of class IA and IB agents (mean 2.2 +/- 1.1 drugs) before encainide. Oral encainide was given in a mean daily dose of 80 +/- 11 mg for greater than or equal to 3 days before repeat programmed stimulation. Encainide was discontinued before follow-up electrophysiologic testing in 5 patients due to spontaneous development of new sustained VT. Of the 43 patients undergoing electropharmacologic testing with encainide, 5 had no inducible arrhythmia. In 9 patients VT was inducible by fewer extrastimuli, in 2 patients a previously stable VT required cardioversion, whereas in 28 patients VT remained inducible by the same number of or more extrastimuli. Thus, encainide prevented the induction of VT or ventricular fibrillation in 5 of 48 patients (10%), while it had a possible proarrhythmic effect in 15 patients (31%). Of the 5 patients without inducible VT administered long-term encainide therapy, 1 returned within 4 weeks of hospital discharge with VT recurrence. 
Evidence for alpha 1-adrenoreceptor hyperresponsiveness in hypotensive cirrhotic patients with ascites. Cirrhosis with ascites is often characterized by arterial hypotension associated with increased plasma norepinephrine levels. Clinical evidence suggests a decreased sensitivity to norepinephrine in this clinical setting, indicating a potential derangement of alpha 1 adrenoreceptors. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the reactivity of the alpha 1-adrenoreceptor, using phenylephrine, a selective alpha 1 receptor agonist. First, we evaluated the pupillar response to the intraconjunctival administration of the agonist. Hypotensive cirrhotic patients showed a trend to a more marked and prolonged response, compared with age-matched healthy controls. Second, we studied the response of alpha 1-adrenoreceptors in the peripheral vasculature by administering iv phenylephrine to a similar group of patients. A significantly greater and longer lasting pressor response was observed in hypotensive cirrhotic patients (p less than 0.0001 vs. healthy controls). Our results indicate that in this group of patients, there is a rather peculiar situation, characterized by alpha 1-adrenoreceptor hyperresponsiveness in the presence of high levels of circulating norepinephrine. This finding could be related to biochemical abnormalities within the peripheral sympathetic nervous system endings. 
5-HT3 receptor antagonists and migraine therapy. Neuronal 5-hydroxytryptamine3 (5-HT3) receptors mediate the excitatory effects of 5-HT. They are located in pain- and nausea-modulating areas in the central nervous system and on C-fibre primary afferents in the peripheral nervous system. Consequently, these receptors mediate the painful and emetic effects of 5-HT. Selective and potent 5-HT3 receptor antagonists have been shown to block inflammatory and 5-HT induced and potentiated "vascular pain". Based on the hypothesis that 5-HT3 receptor antagonists may block neurogenic dural inflammation in the distribution area of the trigeminal nerve and, thus, could potentially prevent migraine (pain), four highly selective and potent 5-HT3 receptor antagonists have been tested in both the acute and prophylactic treatment of migraine. Unfortunately, except for a clear anti-emetic effect, none of these drugs has shown unequivocal efficacy in the treatment of migraine. This may be partly due to the complex (bell-shaped) dose-response relationship of these compounds, making exact titration of the correct dose difficult. Moreover, most 5-HT3 receptor antagonists have proved to be toxic in man on chronic administration thereby preventing further trials in migraine with adjusted doses. Short-term treatment for cytotoxic drug-induced emesis so far appears to be the only proven indication for 5-HT3 receptor antagonists. 
Closure of tracheocutaneous fistula with perichondrial flap following cricothyroidotomy. A method for closure of large tracheocutaneous fistulas occurring in the cricothyroid membrane is described. Though an infrequent complication, large defects in this area can be successfully repaired with this technique. 
Chemotherapy with high dose ifosfamide/mesna plus cisplatin for the treatment of ovarian cancer: a study of the Grupo de Estudio y Tratamiento Latino-Americano del Cancer. Twenty-one evaluable patients with FIGO stages II-IV epithelial ovarian cancer, median age 57 (range 47-75 years), were treated with ifosfamide (IF), 3 g/m2 diluted in 500 ml saline solution, 8 hour intravenous (i.v.) infusion on days 1-5; mesna 20% of IF dose, i.v. bolus injection, was given at hours 0 and 4; mesna 40% of IF dose by oral route at hours 8 and 12, days 1-5; plus cisplatin 20 mg/m2 diluted in 500 ml saline solution, 2 hour i.v. infusion, days 1-5. Cycles were repeated every 4 weeks. All patients had metastatic lesions (mesentery, pleura, colon, cervix, abdominal wall, lung, liver, bladder, and nodes). Toxicity ranged from mild to moderate. All patients experienced alopecia, nausea, and vomiting. Neutropenia and anemia ranged from mild to moderate. One patient experienced mild brain confusion and two patients microscopic hematuria. Ten clinically complete responses (47%) and five clinically partial responses (23%) were registered, for an overall 70% objective response. However, after a second look performance in 10 patients with clinically complete response, six of 10 patients showed a pathological complete response and four showed pathological partial response. The median duration of complete response is about 33 months, and median partial response duration is 14 months. Although the numbers are small, these data indicate that combination chemotherapy with high dose ifosfamide/mesna plus cisplatin may be an active treatment for advanced ovarian carcinoma. 
Glucose uptake, perfusion, and cell proliferation in head and neck tumors: relation of positron emission tomography to flow cytometry The uptake of 18F-Deoxyglucose (FDG) was studied in vivo in relation to the proliferation rate of human head and neck tumors. Forty-two patients with histologically proven squamous-cell carcinoma of the head and neck and four patients with metastases of head and neck tumors were examined with PET and FDG prior to surgery. In 35 of these patients, a flow cytometric analysis of the DNA content and the proliferation rate was done using one-dimensional flow cytometry rate was done using one-dimensional flow cytometry (DAPI staining). In 17 cases, perfusion studies with 15O-labeled water were performed. Twenty-seven specimens were evaluable by flow cytometry. The analysis of the distribution of the FDG uptake revealed two groups, showing a high and a lower uptake pattern. In both groups the FDG uptake and the proliferation rate were correlated with an r-value of 0.64 and 0.8 respectively. However, the slope of the regression function was flat. No correlation was found between the perfusion and the proliferation rate. It is suggested that these differences in uptake in histologically identical tumor populations may correspond to differences at the molecular level, e.g., differences in the amount of the glucose carrier, perhaps caused by oncogenic transformation. 
A case of pheochromocytoma associated with meningioma. We have recently observed a rare case of pheochromocytoma associated with meningioma. To determine the mechanism of such a coexistence in this particular case, we compared the constitutional and pheochromocytoma genotypes of the patient using polymorphic four DNA markers, and we found a loss of heterozygosity at the D1S7 locus. A loss of heterozygosity at this locus has previously been reported by Mathew et al. in pheochromocytoma patients, and our results were in agreement with that study. Therefore the allelic deletion at the D1S7 locus may be an important step in the tumorigenesis of pheochromocytoma in this case. 
Influence of hepatitis B virus infection and age on mode of growth of hepatocellular carcinoma. According to the extent of hepatic involvement of the tumor and that of portal vein invasion at the time of initial diagnosis, patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) were grouped into three or four groups. Correlations among the extent of hepatic involvement, extent of portal vein invasion, and prevalence of hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) and age distribution were examined. The extent of hepatic involvement of the tumor and that of portal vein invasion were significantly greater in patients with positive HBsAg compared with findings in the negative patients (P less than 0.001). For cases of both positive and negative HBsAg, patients with a more extensive HCC were significantly younger. Results of the multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that hepatitis B antigenemia and younger age were statistically significant and independent positive predictors of extensive HCC. These results strongly suggest that hepatitis B surface antigenemia and age play an important role in the growth mode and the kinetics of HCC in Japanese patients. 
Effect of mild hyperthermia on the ischemic infarct volume after middle cerebral artery occlusion in the rat. We investigated the effect of mild whole-body hyperthermia (40 degrees C) on a permanent middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAo) model in Fisher rats by subjecting them to MCAo under the following conditions: (1) normothermia (n = 20); (2) hyperthermia (n = 14) before (1 hour), during, and after (1 hour) MCAo; and (3) post-MCAo hyperthermia (n = 14) for 1 hour. We measured brain and body temperatures during the experiment using micro-thermocouples and blood-brain-barrier (BBB) permeability using Evans blue staining of the brain. We measured the volume of the infarcted brain tissue 4 days after MCAo. We detected no differences in BBB permeability among three groups. The volume of infarcted tissue was significantly greater (p less than 0.05) for the two groups of hyperthermic animals than the normothermic animals. Our data suggest that mild hyperthermia, both during and after induction of ischemia, has a detrimental effect on the ischemic infarct volume in this model. 
Systemic neurohumoral activation and vasoconstriction during pacing-induced acute myocardial ischemia in patients with stable angina pectoris. To identify the effect of myocardial ischemia on systemic neurohormones and vascular resistance, 32 untreated, normotensive patients with coronary artery disease underwent incremental atrial pacing until angina. Arterial and coronary venous lactate and arterial values of catecholamines and angiotensin II were determined at control, at maximal pacing rates, and at 1, 2, 5 and 30 minutes after pacing. Based on pacing-induced ST-segment depression (greater than or equal to 0.1 mV) or myocardial lactate production, or both, patients were selected as ischemic (n = 25) or nonischemic (n = 7). Baseline clinical and hemodynamic data were comparable. During pacing, chest pain was similar (20 ischemic vs 7 nonischemic patients). Also, hemodynamic measurements were comparable, except for contractility, which did not improve, and left ventricular end-diastolic pressure, which significantly increased in ischemic patients. Moreover, during ischemia arterial pressures increased significantly (13%) and systemic resistance increased from 1,470 +/- 60 (control) to 1,632 +/- 76 dynes.s.cm-5 5 minutes after pacing (p less than 0.05) in ischemic but not in nonischemic patients. Pacing did not affect neurohormones in nonischemic patients. In contrast, norepinephrine in ischemic patients increased significantly from 1.7 +/- 0.2 (control) to 2.6 +/- 0.3 (maximal pacing) and to 3.0 +/- 0.4 nmol/liter (1 minute after pacing), whereas angiotensin II levels increased from 6.2 +/- 1.4 (control) to 9.3 +/- 2.1 pmol/liter (1 minute after pacing, p less than 0.05). Epinephrine only increased during maximal rates (0.9 +/- 0.1 vs 0.6 +/- 0.1 nmol/liter at control, p less than 0.05). Thus, myocardial ischemia activates circulating catecholamines and angiotensin II, accompanied by systemic vasoconstriction. 
Cigarette smoking and other vascular risk factors in vasculogenic impotence. A total of 132 consecutive patients with erectile impotence underwent extensive evaluation, including vascular evaluation with intracavernous injection of papaverine and penile duplex ultrasonography, to determine the etiology of impotence. Three vascular risk factors, smoking, diabetes mellitus and hypertension, were investigated for their impact on vasculogenic impotence. The patients were divided into four groups: one with no risk factors, one with one vascular risk factor, one with two vascular risk factors, and one with all three risk factors. The results of penile vascular evaluation in these patient groups were compared. The incidence of penile vascular impairment was found to be higher in patients with one vascular risk factor than in those with none. The proportion of abnormal penile vascular findings significantly increased as the number of risk factors increased. These data confirm the important role of vascular risk factors, smoking, diabetes mellitus, and hypertension, in the pathogenesis of organic impotence. 
A randomized comparison of multipolar electrocoagulation and injection sclerosis for the treatment of bleeding peptic ulcer. Several options are available to the gastroenterologist for the endoscopic control of peptic ulcer hemorrhage. Sixty men (mean age, 62 years) were stratified into those with actively bleeding ulcers or ulcers with stigmata of recent hemorrhage, and then randomized to treatment with injection sclerosis or the multipolar probe until bleeding ceased. There were no significant differences between the randomized groups in terms of age, ulcer size, or transfusion requirements. We achieved hemostasis in 95% of all patients. Re-bleeding rates were 25% and 23% in patients treated with the multipolar probe and injection sclerosis, respectively. There was no significant difference in mortality (14% multipolar probe, 7% injection sclerosis). Patients over the age of 70, those whose onset of bleeding was while an inpatient, and those with an ulcer larger than 2 cm were more likely to have a poor outcome, regardless of the type of endoscopic therapy. Injection sclerosis and multipolar electrocoagulation are equally effective in controlling bleeding from peptic ulcer. 
Perioperative stroke. Part I: General surgery, carotid artery disease, and carotid endarterectomy. Although stroke, defined as a focal neurological deficit lasting more than 24 hr, is uncommon in the perioperative period, its associated mortality and long-term disability are high. No large-scale data are available to identify the importance of recognized risk factors for stroke in the perioperative period. A review of the literature shows that the incidence and mechanism of its occurrence are influenced by the presence of cardiovascular disease and the type of surgery. The most common cause of perioperative stroke is embolism. In non-cardiac surgery, the incidence of perioperative stroke is higher among the elderly. Properly administered, controlled hypotension is associated with minimal risk of stroke. Cerebral vasospasm may be the cause of focal cerebral ischaemia in eclamptic patients, and the aggressive treatment of hypertension may exacerbate the neurological damage. The risk of stroke associated with carotid endarterectomy is closely related to the preoperative neurological presentation, and the experience of the surgical/anaesthetic team. Symptomatic cerebrovascular disease, acute stroke, asymptomatic carotid lesions, preoperative assessment of risk, local and general anaesthesia, cerebral protection and monitoring during carotid endarterectomy are discussed with reference to reducing the risk of perioperative stroke. Adequate monitoring and protection have minimized the risk of ischaemia from carotid clamping, and the major mechanism of stroke is embolization. 
Failure of centralization of the fibula for congenital longitudinal deficiency of the tibia. Between 1962 and 1983, fourteen patients (twenty knees) had centralization of the fibula for congenital longitudinal deficiency: tibial, complete. Eleven of the twenty index procedures were performed on patients who were one year old or less. A progressive flexion deformity of the knee developed after all twenty index procedures. Twenty-six secondary procedures were needed, including disarticulation at the knee, posterior release, extension osteotomy, femorofibular arthrodesis, and biceps-to-quadriceps transfer, and one patient had a second attempt at centralization of the fibula. The duration of follow-up after the initial centralization of the fibula ranged from four years to twenty-two years and seven months (average, twelve years and four months). Seven patients (eight limbs) in whom the index procedure resulted in failure had a satisfactory result after disarticulation at the knee. The patients who did not have secondary disarticulation at the knee are also considered to have had a failed index procedure because they had a flexion deformity at the latest follow-up. Attempts to reconstruct the knee joint by centralization of the fibula are not warranted for patients who have congenital longitudinal deficiency: tibial, complete. Early disarticulation at the knee and fitting with a prosthesis, with close follow-up, is the treatment of choice. 
Effects of a sodium-potassium ion-exchanging seaweed preparation in mild hypertension. A nonpharmacological approach in the treatment of mild hypertension is often advocated. In an attempt to decrease sodium and increase potassium intake, sixty-two middle-aged patients with mild hypertension were given a potassium loaded ion-exchanging sodium-adsorbing potassium-releasing seaweed preparation (seaweed fiber, SF). The mean blood pressure (MBP), evaluated in a double-blind crossover manner with four weeks familiarization and wash-out periods, showed a significant decrease after four weeks on 12 and 24 g/day SF but not on 6 g/day or placebo treatment. Systolic blood pressure during submaximal exercise decreased on all three SF doses. The decrease in MBP appeared to be significantly higher in sodium-sensitive (11.2 mm Hg, P less than .001) than in sodium-insensitive (5.7 mm Hg, P less than .05) patients and was in salt-sensitive patients significantly correlated to the increase in plasma renin activity (PRA). The urinary sodium excretion decreased, the urinary potassium increased and the sodium/potassium urinary excretion ratio decreased, indicating that the decrease of MBP was dependent on the decreased intestinal absorption of sodium and increased absorption of potassium released from the seaweed preparation. A sodium-potassium ion-exchanging seaweed preparation is an effective means of decreasing sodium and increasing potassium intake, and may be used for antihypertensive treatment in mild hypertension. 
Simulation of high-resolution QRS complex using a ventricular model with a fractal conduction system. Effects of ischemia on high-frequency QRS potentials. Recent studies have analyzed the high-fidelity surface electrocardiographic signal, and efforts have been made to increase the diagnostic sensitivity of the electrocardiogram by observing its high-frequency components. It was found that the high-frequency (150-250-Hz) electrocardiogram appears to detect evidence of transient ischemia with greater sensitivity than visual inspection of the surface electrocardiogram. A finite-element three-dimensional model of the ventricles with a self-similar (fractal) conduction system has been introduced as a bridge to the understanding of electrocardiographic phenomena related to high-frequency potentials. The model was activated, and the dipole potential generated by adjacent activated and resting cells was calculated to obtain a high-resolution QRS complex. Normal and ischemic activation processes was stimulated by regional reduction in conduction velocity. It was found that although the resulted low-frequency QRS complex was not significantly altered from normal conditions, the high-frequency components exhibited morphological changes similar to the ones observed during animal experiments and human studies. Based on the results obtained from the model, it can be concluded that these morphological changes can be attributed to a slowing of conduction velocity in the region of ischemia and that the model is adequate for meeting the challenges imposed by the requirements of high-frequency methods applied in clinical cardiology. 
Complex segregation analysis of primary hepatocellular carcinoma in Chinese families: interaction of inherited susceptibility and hepatitis B viral infection. Primary hepatocellular carcinoma (PHC) is extremely common in eastern China, where it is both associated with chronic infection with hepatitis B virus (HBV) and often familial. Complex segregation analysis of 490 extended families was undertaken with liability classes defined by age, sex, and HBV infection status. The maximum-likelihood model suggests that a recessive allele with population frequency approximately .25 yields lifetime risk of PHC, in the presence of both HBV infection and genetic susceptibility, of .84 for males and .46 for females. The model further predicts that, in the absence of genetic susceptibility, lifetime risk of PHC is .09 for HBV-infected males and .01 for HBV-infected females and that, regardless of genotype, it is virtually zero for uninfected persons. Complex segregation analysis therefore provides evidence for the interaction of genotype, environmental exposure, sex and age in determining the occurrence of PHC in this population. 
Visual impairment and cognitive dysfunction in Alzheimer's disease. OBJECTIVE: To determine whether impaired visual acuity is associated with dementia and cognitive dysfunction in older adults. DESIGN: Paired case-control comparisons of the relative frequencies of visual impairment in demented cases and nondemented controls. Cohort analyses of correlation between visual acuity and cognitive functioning in demented cases. SETTING: Internal medicine clinics at two academically affiliated medical centers. PARTICIPANTS: Eighty-seven consecutively selected patients greater than or equal to 65 years of age with mild-to-moderate, clinically diagnosed Alzheimer's disease (cases) and 87 nondemented controls matched to the cases by age, sex, and education. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: The prevalence of visual impairment was higher in cases than in controls [unadjusted odds ratio for near-vision impairment = 2.7 (95% CI = 1.4, 5.2); unadjusted odds ratio for far-vision impairment = 2.1 (95% CI = 1.02, 4.3); odds ratios adjusted for family history of dementia, depression, number of medications, and hearing loss were 2.5 (95% CI = 1.1, 10.5) for near-vision impairment and 1.9 (95% CI = 0.8, 4.6) for far-vision impairment]. When further stratified by quartiles of visual acuity, no statistically significant "dose-response" relationship between vision impairment and dementia risk was observed. Among cases, the degree of visual impairment was significantly correlated with the severity of cognitive dysfunction for both near and far vision (adjusted ps less than 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Visual impairment is associated with both an increased risk and an increased clinical severity of Alzheimer's disease, but the increased risk may not be consistent with a progressive dose-response relationship. Further studies are needed to determine whether visual impairment unmasks and exacerbates the symptoms of dementia or is a marker of disease severity. 
Recurring catamenial pneumothorax treated with a Gn-RH analogue. We report a case of recurring catamenial pneumothorax with concurrent pelvic endometriosis. Thoracoscopy revealed a blue-like lesion on top of the dome of the right hemidiaphragm. Microscopic examination of biopsy specimens showed endometriosis. The patient was treated with a Gn-RH analogue and remains well without further evidence of pneumothorax after six months. 
Sixth nerve schwannomas. Report of two cases. Two cases of sixth cranial nerve schwannoma are presented with a review of four other cases from the literature. The clinical spectrum, neuroradiological findings, and surgical outcome of the six cases are discussed. There are two distinct clinical presentations for sixth cranial nerve schwannomas. Type I sixth nerve schwannomas present with sixth nerve palsy and diplopia and arise from the cavernous sinus. In contrast, type II sixth nerve schwannomas have a more severe presentation with obstructive hydrocephalus, raised intracranial pressure, sixth nerve palsy, and diplopia. This type arises along the course of the sixth cranial nerve in the prepontine area. Cavernous sinus involvement in either type may preclude total surgical excision and indicate an increase possibility for recurrence. 
Differentiation between hemangiomas and metastases of the liver with ultrafast MR imaging: preliminary results with T2 calculations. We studied the efficacy of T2 measurements at high field strength in distinguishing between liver hemangiomas and hepatic metastases when an ultrafast (single-excitation) MR imaging technique is used. Fourteen patients with known liver tumors were imaged in a 2.0-T prototype ultrafast MR scanner with a spin-echo (infinite TR and TE of 30-340 msec) pulse sequence. Each image was obtained with a total data acquisition time of 20 msec. T2 calculations for hepatic metastases (n = 6) showed a mean of 79.3 +/- 13.5 msec, whereas hemangiomas (n = 8) showed a T2 of 139.8 +/- 18.8 msec (p less than .0001). T2 values of lesions had a smaller relative standard deviation than previously reported, and the range of T2 values of hemangiomas (119-181 msec) and metastases (68-103 msec) did not overlap. Our preliminary results suggest that T2 calculations with ultrafast MR imaging may be useful for differentiating hemangiomas from metastases. We hypothesize that T2 values obtained from ultrafast MR images are more reliable than those obtained from conventional MR images, primarily because of the elimination of T1 information and effects of motion on image signal intensity. 
Cerebral circulation: humoral regulation and effects of chronic hypertension. New concepts have emerged in recent years concerning regulation of cerebral circulation. The purpose of this review is to summarize briefly several of these concepts. First, humoral mechanisms may have important effects on cerebral blood vessels and blood flow to choroid plexus. Recent evidence suggests that several vasoactive peptides may have major effects on fluid and ion balance in the brain by altering blood flow to the choroid plexus and possibly the production of cerebrospinal fluid. Second, chronic hypertension produces structural remodeling and hypertrophy of cerebral blood vessels and a shift in the relationship of cerebral blood flow to systemic blood pressure. Third, endothelium-dependent responses of cerebral arterioles to receptor and nonreceptor mediated agonists are impaired during chronic hypertension. Alterations in endothelium-dependent responses of cerebral arterioles during chronic hypertension appears to be due to release of an endothelium-derived contracting factor. 
Ischemic necrosis: a hypothesis to explain the pathogenesis of spontaneously ruptured enterocystoplasty. Spontaneous enterocystoplasty rupture represents a devastating and potentially fatal late complication. Previously proposed mechanisms of rupture include catheter trauma, chronic infection, avulsion of adhesions between the bowel patch and peritoneum, and chronic overdistension with elevated intravesical pressures. We have witnessed this complication 4 times in 3 patients 5 weeks to 46 months postoperatively. Tissue specimens from 3 episodes in 2 patients with detubularized sigmoid enterocystoplasties were available for histological examination. All patients had a neurogenic bladder from myelomeningocele, all had an AMS800 artificial urinary sphincter and all had a documented history of chronic distension from inadequate emptying of the augmented bladder. At exploration, all of the ruptures were found within the bowel segment near the bladder apex in an area remote from the anastomotic line. In each case tissue specimens from the rupture site showed marked vascular congestion, intramural hemorrhage, abundant hemosiderin laden macrophages, myofiber atrophy and intravascular thrombi. These features are interpreted to reflect the sequelae of vascular compromise and ischemia. We propose that enterocystoplasty rupture results from ischemia, possibly due to chronic overdistension and subsequent vascular compromise. This mechanism may account for many of the previously reported cases of enterocystoplasty rupture. 
Prospective cohort study of prone sleeping position and sudden infant death syndrome. Studies of the link between prone sleeping position and sudden infant death syndrome have been criticised on grounds of recall bias and for not taking into account possible confounding effects. To avoid recall bias and to allow measurement of important biological factors a prospective cohort study of the cause of sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) is being conducted. The infants included are those at high risk of the syndrome as assessed by a perinatal score. Of the 3110 members of the cohort born between January, 1988, and end of March, 1990, 23 infants later died of SIDS. Sleep position information was available for 15 of these. Matched analysis to control for the confounding effects of infant birthweight and maternal age indicated that prone sleeping position was associated with an increased risk of SIDS (OR 4.47 95% Cl [1.30-15.43]). The findings are strengthened by the results of a concurrent retrospective case-control study of 42 SIDS cases in which the prone position was also associated with an increased risk of SIDS (unadjusted OR 3.45 [1.59-7.49]). 
Acute lymphoblastic leukemia with t(4;11) translocation after osteogenic sarcoma. The authors report a case of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) with t(4;11) (q21;q23) occurring 9 months after treatment of osteogenic sarcoma. Cell surface marker and molecular analyses suggest early B lineage involvement. This is the first report, to the knowledge of the authors, of t(4;11) ALL arising after an osteogenic sarcoma. The observations of the authors support the possibility of a causal relationship between exposure to carcinogens and the occurrence of leukemia with t(4;11). 
Measuring cell proliferation. Histopathology is based on the interpretation of features of the microscopic image. In recent years, there has evolved interest in assessing quantifiable data from these images, with the intent of providing more precise diagnostic and prognostic information. Proliferation characteristics of tumors are among the most important of these data. Methods for measuring cell proliferation are reviewed. 
Miosis and internal ophthalmoplegia as a manifestation of partial seizures. We present a patient whose only physical manifestation of a partial sensory seizure was bilateral pupillary constriction and internal ophthalmoplegia. The onset and offset of each attack corresponded distinctly with an electroencephalographic discharge of the left temporo-occipital region. We propose involvement of a cortical pupillary constrictive center in the temporal-occipital area. 
Multiple renal neoplasms: a case of 3 histologically dissimilar primary tumors. A 69-year-old woman who presented with bilateral renal masses and gross hematuria was found to have 3 different primary renal neoplasms. She first underwent left partial nephrectomy for an oncocytoma and subsequently right radical nephroureterectomy for transitional cell carcinoma of the pelvis. An incidental angiomyolipoma was found in the specimen. Deoxyribonucleic acid image analysis of all 3 tumors is presented. 
The beneficial effects of early dexamethasone administration in infants and children with bacterial meningitis. BACKGROUND. In experimental models of meningitis and in children with meningitis, dexamethasone has been shown to reduce meningeal inflammation and to improve the outcome of disease. METHODS. We conducted a placebo-controlled, double-blind trial of dexamethasone therapy in 101 infants and children admitted to the National Children's Hospital, San Jose, Costa Rica, who had culture-proved bacterial meningitis or clinical signs of meningitis and findings characteristic of bacterial infection on examination of the cerebrospinal fluid. The patients were randomly assigned to receive either dexamethasone and cefotaxime (n = 52) or cefotaxime plus placebo (n = 49). Dexamethasone (0.15 mg per kilogram of body weight) was given 15 to 20 minutes before the first dose of cefotaxime and was continued every 6 hours thereafter for four days. RESULTS. The demographic, clinical, and laboratory profiles were similar for the patients in the two treatment groups. By 12 hours after the beginning of therapy, the mean opening cerebrospinal pressure and the estimated cerebral perfusion pressure had improved significantly in the dexamethasone-treated children but worsened in the children treated only with cefotaxime (controls). At 12 hours meningeal inflammation and the concentrations of two cytokines (tumor necrosis factor alpha and platelet-activating factor) in the cerebrospinal fluid had decreased in the dexamethasone-treated children, whereas in the controls the inflammatory response in the cerebrospinal fluid had increased. At 24 hours the clinical condition and mean prognostic score were significantly better among those treated with dexamethasone than among the controls. At follow-up examination after a mean of 15 months, 7 of the surviving 51 dexamethasone-treated children (14 percent) and 18 of 48 surviving controls (38 percent) had one or more neurologic or audiologic sequelae (P = 0.007); the relative risk of sequelae for a child receiving placebo as compared with a child receiving dexamethasone was 3.8 (95 percent confidence interval, 1.3 to 11.5). CONCLUSIONS. The results of this study, in which dexamethasone administration began before the initiation of cefotaxime therapy, provide additional evidence of a beneficial effect of dexamethasone therapy in infants and children with bacterial meningitis. 
Intracerebral hemorrhage, cerebral infarction, and subdural hematoma after acute myocardial infarction and thrombolytic therapy in the Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction Study. Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction, Phase II, pilot and clinical trial. In the Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction, Phase II pilot and clinical trial, 908 patients [326 (35.9%) in the pilot study and 582 (64.0%) in the randomized study] were treated with 150 mg recombinant tissue-type plasminogen (rt-PA) activator in combination with heparin and aspirin, and 3,016 patients [64 (2.1%) in the pilot study and 2,952 (97.9%) in the randomized study] were treated with 100 mg rt-PA in combination with heparin and aspirin. Adverse neurological events occurred in 23 patients treated with 150 mg rt-PA (2.5%) [nine cerebral infarctions (1.0%), 12 intracerebral hemorrhages (1.3%), and two subdural hematomas (0.2%)] and in 33 patients treated with 100 mg rt-PA (1.1%) [20 cerebral infarctions (0.7%), 11 intracerebral hemorrhages (0.4%), and two subdural hematomas (0.1%)]. The difference in adverse neurological events observed comparing the two rt-PA regimens was primarily due to a higher frequency of intracerebral bleeding among patients treated with 150 mg rt-PA (1.3% versus 0.4%, p less than 0.01). Patients with recent (within 6 months) histories of stroke were not eligible for the study, and patients with any history of cerebrovascular disease were declared ineligible early in the study. The small number of patients (89, or 2.3%) with any history of neurological disease, intermittent cerebral ischemic attacks, or stroke who were enrolled before the stricter eligibility criteria were imposed or on the basis of incomplete baseline information experienced an increased frequency of intracerebral hemorrhage compared with patients without such histories (3.4% versus 0.5%). Mortality at 6 weeks after presentation among 23 patients who had intracerebral hemorrhage was 47.8%. Intracerebral hemorrhage is a severe but infrequent complication of rt-PA therapy for acute myocardial infarction. The combined frequency of intracerebral hemorrhage, subdural hematoma, and cerebral infarction after treatment with 100 mg rt-PA is comparable to that observed in other trials with thrombolytic agents in acute myocardial infarction. 
High doses of recombinant alpha-interferon or gamma-interferon for chronic hepatitis C: a randomized, controlled trial. Chronic hepatitis C is often a progressive liver disease for which there is no satisfactory treatment. We studied the efficacy of recombinant alpha-interferon or gamma-interferon in the treatment of this disease in comparison with a control group. Thirty patients were randomly assigned to three groups. Ten patients received 7.5 MU alpha-interferon/m2 body surface three times weekly for 3 mo, then 5 MU/m2 for 3 mo and 2.5 MU/m2 for 6 mo. Ten patients were treated with gamma-interferon at a dose of 2 MU/m2 for 6 mo and the other 10 served as controls without treatment. The mean serum ALT levels and liver histological findings improved significantly only in the patients treated with alpha-interferon. No changes were observed in patients treated with gamma-interferon or in controls. Five of 10 patients treated with alpha-interferon had complete responses (mean ALT normal during therapy). After treatment ALT returned to pretreatment levels in two of 5 patients. The long-term response rate after alpha-interferon therapy was 30% at 18 mo. We conclude that alpha-interferon is effective in controlling disease activity in a portion of patients with chronic hepatitis C. High doses of alpha-interferon do not appear to add further benefit in the response rate or relapse rate. gamma-Interferon therapy is ineffective. 
Fluorescein angiographic risk factors for progression of diabetic retinopathy. ETDRS report number 13. Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study Research Group. In the Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study (ETDRS), a multicenter clinical trial sponsored by the National Eye Institute, one eye of each patient was assigned randomly to early photocoagulation and the other to deferral of photocoagulation (i.e., careful follow-up and initiation of photocoagulation only if high-risk proliferative retinopathy developed). This design allowed observation of the natural course of diabetic retinopathy in the initially untreated eye. Gradings of baseline stereoscopic fluorescein angiograms of these eyes were used to examine relationships of angiographic characteristics with each other, with retinopathy severity level and macular edema status graded from color photographs, and with risk of progression from nonproliferative to proliferative retinopathy during 1 to 5 years of follow-up. Fluorescein leakage (particularly diffuse), capillary loss and dilatation, and various arteriolar abnormalities were associated with retinopathy severity and with the likelihood of progression to proliferative retinopathy during follow-up. Severity of fluorescein leakage was strongly associated with macular edema. 
Headaches due to spontaneous internal carotid artery dissection magnetic resonance imaging evaluation and follow up. Spontaneous internal carotid artery (ICA) dissection is not an infrequent cause of headache and acute neurologic deficits in the younger population. Angiography has been the imaging modality of choice for both diagnosis and follow-up. The use of magnetic resonance imaging, (MRI), in conjunction with angiography, is described in three patients shown to have ICA dissection. Our clinical findings suggest that MRI may provide a less expensive, non-invasive, diagnostic and particularly a follow up modality in patients with headache and signs suggestive of ICA dissection. 
Midbrain vs. pontine medial longitudinal fasciculus lesions: the utilization of masseter and blink reflexes. Masseter (MR) and blink reflexes (BL) were investigated in 51 patients with internuclear ophthalmoplegia (INO) due to multiple sclerosis (28) and lacunar infarction (23). The MR was abnormal in 20 of 23 cases with bilateral INO and in 21 of 28 with unilateral INO. The R1 component of the BL (BL-R1) was abnormal in 7 of 23 patients with bilateral INO and 10 of 28 with unilateral INO. Combined MR and BL-R1 changes occurred in 8 of 28 cases with unilateral INO and 7 of 23 with bilateral INO. The findings provide evidence for a rostral/caudal localization of lesions within the medial longitudinal fasciculus causing INO on the basis of MR and BL-R1 abnormalities. An abnormality limited to MR suggests a midbrain location in 58.8% of patients while abnormal BL-R1 with or without an associated MR change suggests a rostral pontine location in 35.3%. 
Assessment of blood echogenicity as an alternative measure to erythrocyte sedimentation rate. OBJECTIVE--To determine the relation between erythrocyte sedimentation rate and blood echogenicity and whether measurement of erythrocyte sedimentation rate could be replaced by measurement of blood echogenicity in monitoring acute phase reactions. DESIGN--Simultaneous measurement of echogenicity of flowing blood and erythrocyte sedimentation rate in blood samples and comparison of results. SETTING--A radiological department in a university hospital. SUBJECTS--83 patients with a suspected venous thrombosis and 36 healthy volunteers. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES--Correlations between the erythrocyte sedimentation rate, packed cell volume, and echogenicity of flowing blood. RESULTS--Blood echogenicity correlated poorly with the packed cell volume, but strongly correlated with the erythrocyte sedimentation rate (when the packed cell volume was within reference limits) (correlation coefficient = 0.73). Blood samples with a greatly raised erythrocyte sedimentation rate were highly echogenic. Only one of the 30 samples with an erythrocyte sedimentation rate below 10 mm in first hour had a higher echogenicity than the least echogenic sample of the 19 with a sedimentation rate above 30 mm in first hour. CONCLUSIONS--Echogenicity of flowing blood correlates with the erythrocyte sedimentation rate and its measurement may compete with conventional methods for evaluating the long term changes in acute phase reactions. Also, it has the added advantage that non-invasive in vivo measurements of blood echogenicity may become possible. 
Is there a premorbid personality typical for Parkinson's disease? For decades clinicians have postulated a characteristic preexisting personality in patients who develop Parkinson's disease (PD). They are described as moralistic, law-abiding, conscientious, and averse to risk-taking. The limited personality surveys tend to be confirmatory, but most of the literature is anecdotal or replete with unprovable psychodynamic postulates. In addition to an apparent stability of marriages and lack of alcoholism, patients with PD are less likely than controls to be smokers. It has been suggested that nicotine and its byproducts are not actually protective against PD, and it could be postulated that higher-than-average intrinsic dopamine may facilitate addiction. Smoking for the patient who is later to develop PD may be particularly unrewarding. In addition, the postulated personality for PD may predispose to hard work, perspiration, and increased exposure to putative trace elements in the water supply. 
Headaches due to cerebrovascular disease. Subarachnoid hemorrhage causes sudden, severe headache and requires immediate medical and surgical diagnosis and treatment. A CT scan is the first choice for correct diagnosis. In order to prevent rebleeding, delays in treatment should be avoided. Intraparenchymal cerebral hemorrhage is now often recognized by means of CT scanning and sometimes is a cause of headache. Cerebellar hemorrhage commonly causes occipital headache and is an indication for immediate surgical intervention, although small cerebellar hemorrhages can be treated conservatively. Ischemic cerebrovascular disease is frequently accompanied by headache, but its etiology remains uncertain. Thrombosis of the cerebrovenous system is a less frequent cause of head pain than that of the arterial system, but it usually shows characteristic neurologic signs. Following carotid endarterectomy or superficial temporal artery-middle cerebral artery bypass surgery, the patient may have moderate to severe unilateral headaches, probably as a result of platelet aggregation and serotonin release. 
Relapsing systemic infection due to Rhodococcus equi in a drug abuser seropositive for human immunodeficiency virus. A case of recurrent multisystemic infection due to Rhodococcus equi in a patient with antibody to the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) but without AIDS is reported. This case, which occurred in a woman with a history of alcohol and drug abuse, is, to our knowledge, the first such case described. The infection involved the lungs, kidneys, brain, and bloodstream. Despite several courses of therapy with antibiotics to which her isolates of R. equi were susceptible in vitro, the patient experienced multiple relapses before her death. On the basis of this case and a few others reported in HIV-infected patients, we recommend an initial antibiotic course at least 6-8 weeks in duration, and we suggest that combination antibiotic treatment be considered. We also suggest that infection with R. equi be included in the diagnostic criteria for AIDS. 
Preoperative insurance status influences postoperative complication rates for gastric bypass. One hundred morbidly obese patients who had gastric bypass surgery were studied to determine how various demographic and medical variables affected complication rates, weight loss, and reduction in comorbidities associated with obesity. During the follow-up period (range: 12 to 59 months), 42 patients developed at least 1 complication. Twenty-three patients developed postoperative medical complications, 9 developed psychiatric complications, and 24 developed complications related to food ingestion. No significant relationships were observed between outcome and age, sex, age of obesity onset, or associated medical disorders. Striking differences in outcome were noted, however, when patients were contrasted according to their preoperative insurance status. Patients dependent on medical assistance, social security disability, or workman's compensation (publicly funded group) (n = 40) developed significantly more medical and psychiatric complications than did those (n = 60) who had private medical insurance (p less than 0.02). Despite the higher complication rate, both groups had the same average weight loss (44.9 +/- 15.3 kg for the publicly funded group versus 43.1 +/- 12.9 kg for those with private insurance) and similar reductions in percent excess weight (66.0 +/- 18.4% versus 75.7 +/- 23.0%) during the first postoperative year. All patients also had similar reductions in medication requirements for hypertension, diabetes, and degenerative joint disease. Additionally, 45% of the publicly funded insurance group who either received public welfare (n = 26) or disability benefits (n = 14) preoperatively were able to attain either full-time or part-time employment postoperatively which allowed them to decrease their level of support (58% and 21%, respectively). Forty-six percent of women in the private insurance group who were not working outside the home also began part-time or full-time employment postoperatively. All patients who were working preoperatively continued to work. These data suggest that although the risks associated with gastric bypass surgery are greater in patients dependent on public funding, these patients benefit significantly from the surgery. 
Hemothorax as a complication following percutaneous renal biopsy. Percutaneous renal biopsy is a routine procedure with a low complication rate. We report a patient who developed shock and respiratory distress secondary to hemothorax following a fluoroscopically guided biopsy. 
Treatment of murine transitional cell carcinoma with intralesional interleukin 2 and murine interferon gamma. The antitumor effect of intralesionally administered recombinant interleukin-2, alone or in combination with recombinant interferon gamma was studied in murine transitional cell carcinoma, MBT2. In the initial prophylactic model treatment was started at day one at the site of tumor inoculation. Maximal and significant reduction in tumor volume occurred in groups receiving 4,000 units of recombinant interleukin 2 and 10(7) colony forming units Bacillus Calmette Guerin (p less than 0.00001 vs saline control). In the same experiment, a reduction in tumor incidence and increase in survival occurred in groups receiving 4,000 units of recombinant interleukin 2, 1,000 units of recombinant interleukin 2 plus 2,000 units of recombinant interferon gamma, as well as 10(7) colony forming units Bacillus Calmette Guerin relative to saline control (p less than 0.005). The dose-response effect of recombinant interleukin 2 alone was also tested in a model of an established transitional cell carcinoma. Intralesional injection treatments were initiated after tumors were palpable. Reduction in tumor volume was observed in the group receiving 8,000 units of recombinant interleukin 2 (p = 0.01 vs saline control), but no significant advantage in survival was noted. 
Muir-Torre syndrome associated with alpha 1-antitrypsin deficiency and cutaneous vasculitis. Report of a case with exacerbation of a cutaneous neoplasm during immunosuppressive therapy. We describe a patient with both Muir-Torre syndrome and alpha 1-antitrypsin deficiency. A keratoacanthoma developed after immunosuppressive therapy for necrotizing vasculitis. To our knowledge, this is the first reported case of Muir-Torre syndrome associated with alpha 1-antitrypsin deficiency. 
Assessment of coronary artery disease by thallium scan in type-1 diabetic uremic patients awaiting combined pancreas and renal transplantation. Twenty-five type-1 diabetic uremic patients (14 men, 11 women, mean age forty +/- eleven years, range, nineteen to sixty) were prospectively analyzed for coronary artery disease (CAD) by thallium scan (TLS) before synchronus pancreas and kidney transplantation. Duration of diabetes ranged from ten to thirty-two years (mean twenty-two +/- five). Fifteen patients (60%) were in dialysis from two to sixty months (mean twenty +/- eighteen). Advanced diabetic degenerative complications were present in all patients. Twenty exercise and five pharmacologic thallium scans were performed. Forty-four percent of patients (6 men, 5 women, mean age forty-two +/- eleven years, range, twenty-six to sixty) had a positive (reversible or permanent defects) TLS. In 2/11 cases, severe CAD required further cardiac investigations for therapeutic management decision. A statistical correlation with resting ECG nonspecific ST-segment and T-wave abnormalities was observed (p less than 0.05) despite the absence of angor in 8 of the 11 patients. On the contrary, no statistical correlations were found regarding high blood pressure, smoking, hypercholesterolemia, duration of diabetes, and duration of dialysis. In this particular diabetic population (young age, male/female ratio = 1.2) with high incidence of silent ischemia, resting ECG repolarization abnormalities, though predictive, were not specific or prognostic of CAD severity; in these cases, exercise and pharmacologic TLS, a noninvasive and sensitive cardiovascular test, may be of great interest in diagnosis of CAD, allowing adequate cardiac management before, during, and after pancreas transplantation. 
Surgical treatment of chronic otitis media and Meniere's syndrome. Meniere's symptom-complex in conjunction with chronic otitis media (COM) has occasionally been encountered in otologic practice. This study compares the effects of various surgical techniques on patients with COM and Meniere's syndrome, primarily on incapacitating vertigo. One group of patients with incapacitating vertigo received endolymphatic system drainage procedures, either endolymphatic sac surgery (83 patients) or cochleosacculotomy (12 patients) simultaneously with surgery for COM. Another group (14 patients) had surgery for COM only. A comparison of the results for vertigo control between the two approaches indicates a significant difference in success rate in favor of endolymphatic system drainage procedures (80% versus 20%). COM is regarded as one of the causes of endolymphatic hydrops (EH). The results of this study seem to indicate both 1. the likelihood of the cause-and-effect relationship between COM and EH, and 2. the effectiveness of endolymphatic shunting procedures on control of incapacitating vertigo, thus supporting the contentions of other authors with regard to pathogenesis and sac enhancement in patients with COM and Meniere's syndrome. 
Focal spared area in fatty liver simulating a mass. Scintigraphic evaluation. The characterization of focally spared areas in a fatty liver may at times be problematic. This report illustrates the unique diagnostic role that combined xenon-133/technetium-99m sulfur colloid scintigraphy can play in such cases. 
Effects of electrophysiologic testing of the automatic implantable cardioverter-defibrillator on left ventricular systolic function and diastolic filling. We investigated the effects of electrophysiologic testing of the automatic implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (AICD) on left ventricular systolic function and diastolic filling in 12 patients. Ventricular tachycardia or ventricular fibrillation was induced by programmed electrical stimulation and alternating-current, respectively. Patients were studied before and immediately after, 10 minutes after, and 1 hour after defibrillation by the AICD using M-mode, two-dimensional, and pulsed Doppler echocardiography. Immediately after defibrillation, increases were found in the peak early filling velocity (70 +/- 10 cm/sec to 84 +/- 24 cm/sec, p less than 0.01), peak early-to-atrial filling velocity ratio (1.05 +/- 0.21 to 1.29 +/- 0.26, p less than 0.005), and maximum rate of diastolic chamber enlargement (82 +/- 26 mm/sec to 102 +/- 44 mm/sec, p less than 0.05). These changes were not evident at 10 minutes and 1 hour. Cardiac output and ejection fraction were unchanged after defibrillation. Heart rate and diastolic filling time were unchanged. We conclude that electrophysiologic testing of the AICD does not impair left ventricular function in the immediate to 1-hour period after defibrillation. Left ventricular systolic function is unchanged and diastolic filling is enhanced. 
Post-endarterectomy headache and the role of the oculosympathetic system. A study was carried out on headache after carotid endarterectomy. A specific type of headache, similar in its characteristics to "cluster headache", occurred on the operative side in 30% of 54 patients, whereas no such headache occurred after extra-intracranial bypass or peripheral vascular surgery. This postoperative headache was not spontaneously reported by 56% of patients unless they were specifically asked about it. Pharmacological pupillary testing performed in 37 patients revealed that a decreased oculosympathetic activity (with or without adrenoceptor supersensitivity) was constantly associated with post-endarterectomy headache. Although this same abnormality was also observed in 54% of the patients without headache, a statistically significant (p less than 0.01) higher prevalence of decreased oculosympathetic responses was found in the patients with headache. The results suggest that damage to the sympathetic plexus due to the surgical procedure is involved in the development of postoperative "cluster-like" headache. 
Pouchitis--is it a wastebasket diagnosis? Pouchitis is a poorly defined syndrome that is unique to patients with an ileal reservoir. During a prospective follow-up review of 215 patients who underwent ileal pouch-anal anastomosis, pouchitis was diagnosed in 30 patients (14 percent). Based on the clinical course, two distinct patterns of pouchitis were recognized: patients who experienced two or fewer episodes (Group 1-18 patients) and patients who experienced at least three episodes (Group 2-12 patients). Histopathologic review of resected colons revealed a preponderance of indeterminate colitis in patients in Group 2 (58.3 percent) compared with patients in Group 1 (0 percent). In Group 1; 88.9 percent of patients responded to therapy with metronidazole. Only 25 percent of patients in Group 2 responded to metronidazole alone. Most patients in Group 2 required sulfasalazine, topical steroids, or both. Of the 30 patients with pouchitis, four (13.3 percent) had a distinct endoscopic pattern of distal inflammation. This subset of patients with short strip pouchitis was successfully treated with topical steroid preparations. The clinical differences suggest different causes of pouchitis in these two groups. 
Broca's aphasia following damage to Wernicke's area. For or against traditional aphasiology? Classic aphasiology has been challenged by studies that have employed cranial computed tomography to test predicted anatomic-behavioral correlations. We treated a patient who developed a classic Broca's aphasia but whose computed tomographic scan revealed damage to Wernicke's area, thus seeming to contradict the principles of traditional aphasiology. However, subsequent information obtained by magnetic resonance imaging, intracarotid amobarbital (Amytal) testing, and electrophysiologic studies, including cortical stimulation, demonstrated that the brain-behavior correlations in this patient can be understood in terms of the formulations of traditional aphasiology. 
Variations in length of stay and outcomes for six medical and surgical conditions in Massachusetts and California. OBJECTIVES.--To determine the extent to which interinstitutional variations in length of stay are explained by differences in patient characteristics and to determine whether patients in hospitals with shorter lengths of stay had worse outcomes. DESIGN.--We reviewed patients' medical records and surveyed patients between 3 and 12 months after hospital discharge using a questionnaire. SETTING.--Six teaching hospitals in California and Massachusetts. PATIENTS.--A cohort of 2484 selected patients who had been hospitalized for acute myocardial infarction or to rule out acute myocardial infarction, coronary artery bypass graft surgery, total hip replacement, cholecystectomy, or transurethral prostatectomy. Between 73% and 84% of the patients with each condition completed a follow-up questionnaire. OUTCOME MEASURES.--In-hospital complications, deaths, length of stay, functional status after hospital discharge, readmission, and patient satisfaction with hospital care were analyzed. RESULTS.--Significant interinstitutional differences in length of stay were noted for all conditions except rule-out acute myocardial infarction. Statistical adjustment for case-mix differences accounted for most of the interinstitutional differences in length of stay for total hip replacement but explained little of the differences in the other conditions. When we controlled statistically for other predictors, length of stay did not have a significant impact on deaths, functional status after hospital discharge, the probability of readmission, or patient satisfaction with hospital care. CONCLUSION.--More research is needed to determine the medical practices that are related to variations in lengths of stay. Routinely available outcome data may help preserve quality in the face of efforts to decrease costs by effecting more standardized practices of care. 
Pancreaticobiliary ductal union. The main pancreatic duct and the common bile duct open into the second part of the duodenum alone or after joining as a common channel. A common channel of greater than 15 mm (an anomalous pancreaticobiliary duct) is associated with congenital cystic dilatation of the common bile duct and carcinoma of the gall bladder. Even a long common channel (greater than or equal to 8 mm) is associated with a higher frequency of carcinoma of the gall bladder. Gall stones smaller than the common channel and a long common channel predispose to gall stone induced acute pancreatitis. Separate openings for the two ductal systems predisposes to development of gall stones and alcohol induced chronic pancreatitis. The role of ductal union has also been investigated in primary sclerosing cholangitis and biliary atresia. 
The effect of valproic acid on plasma carnitine levels. Plasma total, free, and acyl carnitine levels were determined in four groups of children: (1) those treated with valproic acid as monotherapy (n = 43), (2) those treated with valproic acid plus other antiepileptics as polytherapy (n = 91), (3) those treated with other antiepileptic drugs alone (n = 43), and (4) normal patients (n = 89). The mean free carnitine level was significantly lower in both the valproic acid monotherapy (29.9 mumol/L) and polytherapy (21.4 mumol/L) groups compared with normal subjects (36.8 mumol/L); it was also significantly lower than that in patients treated with other antiepileptic drugs (36.7 mumol/L). Comparison of valproic acid polytherapy and monotherapy yielded significantly lower free carnitine levels in the polytherapy group. The ratios of acyl to free carnitine for monotherapy (0.41) and polytherapy (0.45) were significantly higher than that in the normal group (0.25). This study indicates that a general decrease in the carnitine pool should be anticipated in patients taking valproic acid polytherapy and, to a lesser degree, monotherapy. Carnitine levels in the group taking other drugs did not differ from normal. 
A critical review of the evidence supporting a relationship between impaired fibrinolytic activity and venous thromboembolism. We critically evaluated the evidence for an association between venous thromboembolism and impaired fibrinolytic activity, as determined by global tests of fibrinolytic activity or specific tests for tissue plasminogen activator and plasminogen activator inhibitor. A computer-assisted and manual search was performed to retrieve all articles that reported on fibrinolytic activity and venous thromboembolism. The strength of the evidence for an association was assessed by analysis of the design of individual studies with special attention directed to choice of controls and methods of diagnosis of venous thromboembolism. It is concluded that for patients with symptomatic thrombosis the published evidence does not prove an association between impaired fibrinolytic activity and increased risk of thrombosis. In contrast, for postoperative thrombosis there is good evidence for an association between impaired fibrinolytic activity measured either preoperatively or postoperatively and increased risk of postoperative thrombosis. Whether this association is causal or coincidental is unclear, since randomized clinical trials that used interventions to enhance fibrinolytic activity produced inconsistent results. 
Smoking, the oral contraceptive pill, and Crohn's disease. Both cigarette smoking and the oral contraceptive pill have been implicated as aggravating factors in Crohn's disease. Based upon the recent demonstration of multifocal gastrointestinal infarction in Crohn's disease, a possible pathogenic mechanism for this condition, we propose how smoking and the oral contraceptive pill may potentiate a tendency for focal thrombosis and hence exacerbate the activity of Crohn's disease. 
Auditory performance with simultaneous intracochlear multichannel stimulation. Different sound processing strategies are used in the various cochlear implant designs. This report presents auditory data on 35 patients implanted at the University of Utah from April 1984 to April 1989. A multichannel monopolar electrode system is inserted intracochlearly. During daily use and auditory performance testing, four electrodes receive simultaneous input. The incoming acoustic signal is amplified and routed to the different electrodes through a band-pass filter system. Mean pure-tone performances were: 500 Hz-29.6 +/- 9.4 dB; 1000 Hz-23.5 +/- 13.2 dB; 2000 Hz-25.4 +/- 9.6 dB; 4000 Hz-32.1 +/- 11.5 dB; and 6000 Hz-42.2 +/- 7.7 dB. Audio-only CID sentence testing showed 51.4% of patients scoring better than 60% and 40% scoring better than 80%. The percutaneous pedestal is well tolerated; patients have had the systems in place for 13 and 15 years. 
Effects of CO2 rebreathing on pulmonary mechanics in premature infants. The effects of hypercapnia produced by CO2 rebreathing on total pulmonary, supraglottic, and lower airway (larynx and lungs) resistance were determined in eight premature infants [gestational age at birth 32 +/- 3 (SE) wk, weight at study 1,950 +/- 150 g]. Nasal airflow was measured with a mask pneumotachograph, and pressures in the esophagus and oropharynx were measured with a fluid-filled or 5-Fr Millar pressure catheter. Trials of hyperoxic (40% inspired O2 fraction) CO2 rebreathing were performed during quiet sleep. Total pulmonary resistance decreased progressively as end-tidal PCO2 (PETCO2) increased from 63 +/- 23 to 23 +/- 15 cmH2O.l-1.s in inspiration and from 115 +/- 82 to 42 +/- 27 cmH2O.l-1.s in expiration between room air (PETCO2 37 Torr) and PETCO2 of 55 Torr (P less than 0.05). Lower airway resistance (larynx and lungs) also decreased from 52 +/- 22 to 18 +/- 14 cmH2O.l-1.s in inspiration and from 88 +/- 45 to 30 +/- 22 cmH2O.l-1.s in expiration between PETCO2 of 37 and 55 Torr, respectively (P less than 0.05). Resistance of the supraglottic airway also decreased during inspiration from 7.2 +/- 2.5 to 3.6 +/- 2.5 cmH2O.l-1.s and in expiration from 7.6 +/- 3.3 to 5.3 +/- 4.7 cmH2O.l-1.s at PETCO2 of 37 and 55 Torr (P less than 0.05). The decrease in resistance that occurs within the airway in response to inhaled CO2 may permit greater airflow at any level of respiratory drive, thereby improving the infant's response to CO2. 
Acute fetal ductal occlusion in lambs. To assess fetal right ventricular and hemodynamic responses to acute occlusion of the ductus arteriosus, the pulmonary pressure, right and left ventricular output, and right ventricular dimensions of five fetal lambs were measured with simultaneous echocardiographic monitoring. Ductal occlusion resulted in a rise in pulmonary arterial pressure, a decrease in right ventricular output of 68%, an increase in left ventricular output of 18%, and a fall in combined cardiac output of 34%. The right ventricular systolic dimension increased, and the shortening fraction decreased from 0.41 to 0.14. Tricuspid regurgitation started within two heartbeats after ductal occlusion and resolved as soon as the occlusion was released. Acute fetal ductal occlusion imposes a marked increase in the right ventricular afterload, resulting in reversible triscuspid regurgitation. 
Importance of RAA system and the treatment of patients with ACE inhibition after myocardial infarction. There is activation of the renin angiotensin system after both complicated and uncomplicated myocardial infarction. Angiotensin II increases myocardial oxygen consumption whilst reducing coronary flow and is also directly toxic to the myocardium. Angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors produce beneficial haemodynamic and neuroendocrine changes in patients with acute left ventricular failure, and may have a role in selected patients with cardiogenic shock. There is evidence to suggest that they might prevent the development of late cardiac failure by limiting the extent of post infarction ventricular dilation. Further research is necessary to define their role in the treatment of acute myocardial infarction. 
Paraproteinemic corneal deposits in plasma cell myeloma. We treated two patients who had IgG-kappa-light chain monoclonal gammopathy with partially crystalline and partially amorphic corneal deposits. Impairment of vision made keratoplasty necessary for each patient. Histologic examination of the corneal specimens showed deposits that stained positively for Masson's trichrome in all corneal cells. Immunohistochemical tests identified these deposits as IgG-kappa-light chain immunoglobulin fragments. Electron microscopy showed intracellular, rhomboid-shaped deposits enveloped by a membrane. The same deposits appeared in the conjunctival epithelium, within subconjunctival fibrocytes, and in the plasma cells of the bone marrow. Immunoelectrophoresis showed IgG-kappa-light chain fragments in the blood serum, the lacrimal film, and the aqueous humor. This suggests that the intracellular immunoglobulin fragments may have entered the corneal and conjunctival epithelium by way of the lacrimal film, the keratocytes by way of the corneo-scleral limbus vasculature, and the endothelial cells from the aqueous humor. 
The necessary length of hospital stay for chronic pulmonary disease. OBJECTIVE.--To determine the necessary length of stay for patients admitted to the hospital with an exacerbation of chronic pulmonary disease and to compare this with the length of stay assigned by the diagnosis related group system. DESIGN.--A cohort of patients were followed up prospectively after hospital admission to determine when complications, critical incidents, and the need for monitoring occurred. The medically derived necessary lengths of stay were statistically compared with the lengths of stay assigned by the diagnosis related group. Clinical factors were used to predict long vs short necessary lengths of stay. SETTING.--Two acute care hospitals: one was the principal and the other a major community teaching hospital. PATIENTS.--A consecutive sample of 83 patients who were 45 years of age or older and who required admission for treatment of chronic pulmonary disease. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES.--The occurrence and time of complications, critical interventions, and monitoring. RESULTS.--After 6 days in the hospital, 90% of patients were free of complications or the need for monitoring. However, 16 days elapsed before 90% of patients had been discharged from the hospital. The length of stay that was considered necessary for care averaged 6.9 days; the actual mean length of stay was 8.7 days. The correlation between each patient's ideal length of stay and the length of stay assigned by the diagnosis related group was low and was not statistically significant. Three clinical variables at the time of admission (high PCO2 levels, symptoms that were present for more than 1 day, and antibiotic treatment) were associated with the need for longer hospital stays. CONCLUSIONS.--The medically required length of stay for patients with an exacerbation of chronic pulmonary disease was between 6 and 7 days, on average. This length of stay, which was based on clinical events, differs from the length of stay that was calculated as a statistical norm by the diagnosis related group system. Clinical characteristics may help to identify patients who require a longer length of stay. 
Isoenzymes of alkaline phosphatase in epileptic patients receiving carbamazepine monotherapy. The effects of carbamazepine monotherapy were investigated in 20 female and 21 male epileptic patients to determine whether treatment would induce an increase in serum alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity, a known effect of many anticonvulsant drugs. Serum total ALP activity was increased in nine out of the 41 patients (22%), serum bone ALP activity was increased in 10 (24%), and serum non-bone ALP activity was increased in three (7%). There was no significant difference when the mean of the patients' serum total ALP was compared with that of the controls. Twenty per cent of the patients with increased serum bone ALP had normal serum total ALP, indicating that increased serum bone isoenzyme activity may precede an increase in the total enzyme activity. This should be considered when interpreting results of increased total ALP in epileptic patients. 
Adenocarcinoma of the prostate: biopsy to whole mount. Denver VA experience. Clinical understaging abounds in adenocarcinoma of the prostate. The preoperative prostate-specific antigen is not useful in preoperative staging, although enzymatic acid phosphatase elevation is associated with positive nodes in two-thirds of patients. Whole mount evaluation of radical prostatectomy specimens reveals tumor multicentricity in more than half the patients and tumor extension beyond the prostatic capsule in the majority of patients. A significant number of patients have a final tumor grade higher than that initially assigned. Capsule penetration by tumor is a factor of tumor grade as is volume. 
Drug-induced esophagitis. Drug-induced esophagitis is being recognized increasingly in the past few years. We have reviewed 175 cases with a view to classifying this disease based on pathology. Drug-induced esophageal injury tends to occur at the anatomical site of narrowing, with the middle third behind the left atrium predominating. The disease is classified broadly into two groups. The first group is transient and self-limiting, as exemplified by tetracycline- and emepronium-induced injury (57.3%). The second is the persistent esophagitis group, often with stricture with two distinct entities: 1) patients on nonsteroidal antiinflammatory agents whose injury is aggravated by gastroesophageal reflux (26.2%) (reflux aggravated), and 2) patients with potassium chloride and quinidine sulfate-induced injury (16.2%) (persisting drug injury). We report a case that highlights the pathophysiology (delayed transit, persisting potassium within the stricture) of this type of injury which is not reflux aggravated. 
Cervical human papillomavirus deoxyribonucleic acid and cytologic evaluations in gynecologic outpatients. We studied the prevalence and cytologic manifestations of human papillomavirus deoxyribonucleic acid among 2668 gynecologic outpatients. The study population consisted of 1573 women who came into the emergency room, 623 women from an abortion clinic who were seen because of induced first-trimester abortion, and 472 women who had been referred to a colposcopy clinic because of an abnormal Papanicolaou smear finding. A dot blot technique was used for the detection of human papillomavirus types 6/11, 16/18, and 31/33/35. The prevalence of human papillomavirus deoxyribonucleic acid was 4.4% in the emergency room population, 8.8% in the abortion clinic population, and 31.4% in the colposcopy clinic population. Human papillomavirus type 16/18 was most prevalent (3.5%), followed by human papillomavirus type 31/33/35 (3.1%), and human papillomavirus type 6/11 was least prevalent (2.1%). Of all unselected human papillomavirus deoxyribonucleic acid-positive women who were enrolled from the emergency room or from the abortion clinic, 73% had normal cytologic evaluations. Twenty-five percent had benign atypia, and 2% had dyskaryotic changes. No human papillomavirus deoxyribonucleic acid type-specific differences were detected in the distribution of cytologic atypias. 
Gastrointestinal lipoma and malignancies. Twenty gastrointestinal lipomata in 18 patients are reviewed: 15 located in the colon, 3 in the distal ileum, one in the duodenum, and one in the stomach. They were found most frequently in European-born, elderly women and presented with variable abdominal symptomatology. Four lipomata were removed during endoscopy, the remainder at laparotomy, partial colectomy being performed in 10 cases. All, except 2 subserosal types, were located in the submucosa, and their average size was 2.7 cm diameter. Microscopically, none showed true encapsulation, and all were composed of mature fat cells without cellular atypia. In spite of nonspecific changes at endoscopy, one-half of the cases showed, on microscopic examination, atrophy of the overlying glands and a prominent eosinophilic and/or lymphoplasmocytic infiltration of the lamina propria. Two large subserosal lipomata were associated with Crohn's disease. In addition, in 39% of cases, malignant tumours, either single or double, were present in the gastrointestinal tract or elsewhere. Gastrointestinal "lipomata" are located in the sites of normal fatty infiltration in the elderly; these growths could be a local aging or reactive process of the intestinal wall rather than true neoplasms without any potential malignancy. However, coexistent malignancies should be carefully searched for in elderly patients with colonic lipoma. 
Clinicopathologic observations in essential tremor: report of six cases. Essential tremor (ET) is the most common pathologic tremor, but only eight cases have been studied pathologically. We report detailed clinical and neuropathologic studies of six additional patients. We did not find any neuropathologic lesions that might be specific for ET. Moreover, there were no abnormalities of the substantia nigra consistent with Parkinson's disease. The neuropathologic substrate of ET remains unknown. 
Ossifying fibroma in the sylvian fissure: case report. A rare case of an ossifying fibroma that developed in the sylvian fissure is reported here. During surgery, branches of the middle cerebral artery were encased in osseous tumor. The encased branches were divided and reanastomosed after the mass was removed. Postoperative angiograms demonstrated patency of the anastomosed arteries and a postoperative magnetic resonance imaging scan revealed no infarction distal to the arterial anastomoses. The authors recommend division and anastomosis of the encased arteries rather than partial removal of tumor from around the encased arteries, resulting in residual tumor being left behind. 
Neurological and neuropathological sequelae of correction of chronic hyponatremia. The effect of correction of chronic hyponatremia at different rates was studied in 91 rats maintained at a plasma [Na+] of 112 +/- 1 mmol/liter for 19 +/- 1 days. Hyponatremia was corrected into normal ranges (140 to 145 mmol/liter) using three different methods. Rats corrected by water restriction achieved normal plasma [Na+] by 2.1 +/- 0.2 day and had a maximal (4 hr) correction rate of 1.0 +/- 0.1 mmol/liter.hr; rats corrected by water diuresis achieved normal plasma [Na+] by 1.6 +/- 0.1 day and had a maximal correction rate of 2.8 +/- 0.2 mmol/liter.hr; rats corrected by hypertonic saline infusion achieved normal plasma [Na+] by 5.4 +/- 0.3 hr and had a maximal correction rate of 5.7 +/- 0.4 mmol/liter.hr. A fourth control group was not corrected. No demyelinative lesions were found in the brains from the uncorrected rats, whereas the occurrence of such lesions in the brains of the corrected rats was highly correlated with the maximal rate of increase in plasma [Na+] (r = 0.68, P less than 0.001), and to a lesser degree with the magnitude of the increase in plasma [Na+] over the first 24 hours of correction (r = 0.41, P less than 0.001). Brain myelinolysis was first observed in animals whose maximal (4 hr) rate of correction exceeded 1.75 mmol/liter.hr, and the incidence of demyelination increased progressively in rats with more rapid rates of correction. Similarly, myelinolysis was first observed in rats whose magnitude of correction at 24 hours exceeded 16 mmol/liter and also increased in rats with larger 24 hour magnitudes of correction. 
Changes in standard electrocardiographic ST-segment elevation predictive of successful reperfusion in acute myocardial infarction. The ability of the electrocardiographic ST segment to predict successful reperfusion after thrombolytic therapy remains controversial. To evaluate whether angiographically determined reperfusion could be predicted from changes in ST-segment elevation, the sum of ST-segment elevation in affected leads of the electrocardiogram was compared before and after thrombolytic therapy in 53 patients with acute myocardial infarction (AMI). Reperfusion status of the infarct-related artery was determined angiographically less than 8 hours from onset of symptoms. According to the Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction trial (TIMI) criteria, 33 patients had successful reperfusion (TIMI grade 2 to 3 flow) after thrombolytic therapy and 20 patients did not (TIMI grade 0 to 1 flow). Logistic multiple regression analysis showed that the proportional value for the shift in the sum of ST elevation, termed the "% ST change," was more strongly associated with reperfusion than the absolute measured difference in millimeters (chi-square = 11.34 vs 9.22). The entire spectra of sensitivities and specificities were determined to identify a level of the percent ST change with simultaneous high sensitivity and specificity. A 20% decrease in ST elevation provided such a level (88% sensitivity, 80% specificity). The positive and negative predictive values of a 20% decrease in ST elevation were 88 and 80%, respectively. These results suggest that a decrease of only 20% in the sum of ST elevation in the standard electrocardiogram after thrombolytic therapy is a useful noninvasive predictor of reperfusion status in patients with evolving AMI. 
Hypersensitivity myocarditis. Autopsy tissue specimens of 69 cases of hypersensitivity myocarditis were studied to determine drug association, spectrum of histologic findings, distribution of infiltrates, and correlation between degree of infiltrates and cardiac symptoms. Hypersensitivity myocarditis was defined by the presence of eosinophils, a mixed lymphohistiocytic infiltrate along natural planes of separation, and an absence of fibrosis or granulation tissue in areas of infiltrate. Commonly implicated drugs were methyldopa, hydrochlorothiazide, ampicillin, furosemide, digoxin, tetracycline, aminophylline, phenytoin, benzodiazepines, and tricyclic antidepressants. Histiocytes composed the predominant cell type (in addition to eosinophils and lymphocytes). Lymphocytes were predominantly T cells in 12 cases studied immunohistochemically. Small foci of myocyte necrosis were present in 37 cases, and they correlated with the degree of infiltrate. A nonnecrotizing vasculitis was present in 28 cases. The right ventricle was involved in all but three cases. Cardiac arrhythmias or unexplained death occurred in 29 patients and did not correlate with the degree of myocardial infiltrate or presence of necrosis. Eosinophils were present in the livers of 30 of 58 patients, and their presence correlated with the degree of cardiac infiltration. A causative association between histologic findings and drugs is difficult to prove because of the common usage of many of the drugs implicated, multiple drug use, and the absence of clinical criteria of hypersensitivity. Symptoms do not appear related to the degree of infiltrate. In more than half the cases, infiltrates may be missed by endomyocardial biopsy due to focality of lesions. 
A phase I, II study of high-dose 5-fluorouracil and high-dose leucovorin with low-dose phosphonacetyl-L-aspartic acid in patients with advanced malignancies. Twenty-eight patients with refractory advanced malignancies were treated with a 24-hour infusion of 5-fluorouracil (5-FU), leucovorin (LV), and N-(phosphonacetyl)-L-aspartic acid (PALA) weekly. Twenty-seven patients were evaluable to assess toxicity and antitumor activity. The PALA was administered as an intravenous bolus over 15 minutes at a fixed dose (250 mg/m2) 24 hours before the start of the 5-FU and leucovorin infusions. Initially the dose of 5-FU was 750 mg/m2; this was increased incrementally to 2600 mg/m2. The LV was administered in a fixed dose of 500 mg/m2 concurrently with the 5-FU over a 24-hour period. This regimen was repeated weekly. Diarrhea, stomatitis, nausea, and vomiting were among the dose-limiting toxicities. Others were hand-foot syndrome, hair loss of the scalp and eyelashes, overall weakness, rhinitis, and chemical conjunctivitis. The maximum tolerated dose of 5-FU in this combination and schedule was 2600 mg/m2. Seven of 14 patients treated with 2600 mg/m2 were able to tolerate the chemotherapy on a weekly basis without interruption. The other seven patients required dose reductions, but most received 5-FU at a dose of 2100 mg/m2. Twenty-three of 27 patients were treated previously. Eight patients had a partial response; five of these were treated previously. A complete response was observed in one patient with pancreatic carcinoma, previously untreated. The overall response rate for patients treated with 2100 or 2600 mg/m2 of 5-FU was nine of 18 patients (50%). Three of four previously untreated patients with pancreatic cancer responded to this treatment (two responded partially, and one had a complete response). One of three heavily pretreated patients with non-small cell lung cancer had a partial response as did a patient with breast cancer. Four of ten patients with colorectal cancer responded to the treatment (four partial responses), of whom three had been treated previously. 
Endoscopic removal of inflammatory fibroid polyps of the stomach. Three cases of gastric inflammatory fibroid polyp removed by endoscopic polypectomy are reported. All lesions were located in the gastric antrum or prepyloric region, and their depth was restricted to the submucosa. The correct diagnosis was obtained, and the digestive symptoms disappeared after polypectomy. In contrast to observations in previous reports, we believe these lesions are suitable for removal by endoscopic means, provided they are small in size and strictly submucosal in location. 
Meningiomas of the lateral skull base: neurotologic manifestations and patterns of recurrence. The eradication of basicranial meningiomas by traditional surgical techniques is often hindered by neoplastic entanglement with critical neurovascular structures. Apparent, complete tumor resection is frequently followed by extensive, yet clinically silent, recurrent disease with local infiltration of bone, cranial nerves, and brain. Fifty-five cases of sphenoid wing or parasellar meningioma were analyzed to identify clinical manifestations suggestive of early tumor recurrence. Regrowth patterns were then defined according to preoperative radiographic and intraoperative surgical findings. Medial tumor regrowth, involving the cavernous sinus, caused neurapraxia of cranial nerves III, IV, or VI, with associated diplopia or ophthalmoplegia. Inferior (caudal) regrowth of disease involved the infratemporal fossa, pterygomaxillary space, or paranasal sinuses by bony erosion of the middle cranial fossa floor or through natural anatomic foramina and fissures. Such inferior extension was manifested clinically by facial hypesthesia, trismus, and referred otalgia caused by trigeminal nerve involvement and by autophony or serous otitis media related to eustachian tube obstruction. Posterior tumor regrowth occurred along the petrous bone and horizontal carotid canal, resulting in internal auditory meatus erosion and cerebellopontine angle extension with associated tinnitus, hearing loss, unsteadiness, and occasional facial twitching. While the clinical and radiographic evaluations of any patient with a suspected recurrent basicranial meningioma are critical in planning the method and magnitude of reoperation, an understanding of potential recurrence patterns can be used in devising more extensive, combined approaches that may allow complete tumor extirpation at the initial surgical intervention. 
Therapeutic defibrination with ancrod does not protect canine myocardium from reperfusion injury. The purpose of this study was to determine whether normal fibrinogen contributes to the development of myocardial reperfusion injury by acting as a substrate in vivo for neutrophil adhesion. This was tested in a dog model of acute myocardial infarction that used pentobarbital anesthetized dogs subjected to 90 min regional myocardial ischemia and 5 h reperfusion. Dogs were treated with 1 unit/kg Ancrod (venom from the Malayan pit viper, Agkistrodon rhodostoma) or vehicle i.v. 60 min after left circumflex coronary artery occlusion. Therapeutic defibrination was verified in Ancrod-treated dogs by measurements of clottable fibrinogen, alpha-2 antiplasmin and plasminogen, by the activated partial thromboplastin time and by immunoelectrophoresis. Fibrinogen was depleted to below detectable limits of the assay (less than 0.05 mg/ml) after treatment with Ancrod. The defibrination effect was accomplished by the expected activation of the fibrinolytic system: alpha-2 antiplasmin was decreased by 10% and plasminogen activity was decreased by 30% with Ancrod treatment. There were no measureable differences between the two treatment groups in heart rate, mean arterial blood pressure, rate pressure product or circumflex coronary blood flow throughout the 90 min of regional ischemia or during the 5 h of reperfusion. The relative severity of ischemia between the two treatment groups was similar when assessed with radiolabeled microsphere measurement of myocardial blood flow. The accumulation of neutrophils (measured by myeloperoxidase activity) within the myocardium after reperfusion was not reduced by prior depletion of fibrinogen. 
Presence of PAF-acether in stool of patients with pouch ileoanal anastomosis and pouchitis. Platelet-activating factor is an endogenous phospholipid produced by a wide variety of inflammatory cells. Platelet-activating factor induces severe pathological changes in various organs and, among numerous potent effects, causes bowel necrosis. Pouchitis is a poorly understood complication of ileoanal pouch anastomosis which occurs in patients who undergo surgery for ulcerative colitis. The aim of this study was to measure ileal or fecal platelet-activating factor and lyso platelet-activating factor contents in normal volunteers (n = 12), in patients with terminal ileostomy (n = 7), and in patients with ileoanal anastomosis (n = 15) (8 patients have pouchitis defined by the presence of ulcerations on the reservoir). Fecal samples were processed and assessed for platelet-activating factor by platelet aggregation assay. The aggregating material was further characterized as platelet-activating factor by the following: inhibition of the platelet aggregation it induced by specific platelet-activating factor receptor antagonist (BN 52021; IHB, Le Plessis Robinson, France); abolition of platelet aggregation after incubation with phospholipase A2 but not with lipase A1; and retention time on high-performance liquid chromatography. Stool platelet-activating factor content (in nanograms per gram of stool, mean +/- 1SD) was significantly increased in patients with pouchitis (22.2 +/- 16 ng/g) compared with patients with normal reservoir (1.59 +/- 0.63 ng/g, P less than 0.01), terminal ileostomy (0.59 +/- 0.43 ng/g, P less than 0.01), and healthy controls (0 +/- 0 ng/g of stool, P less than 0.001). Lyso platelet-activating factor (nanograms per gram of stool) was increased in patients with pouchitis (10,704 +/- 5499 ng/g) compared with patients with normal reservoir (4721 +/- 4549 ng/g of stool, P less than 0.05), terminal ileostomy (3042 +/- 4019 ng/g, P less than 0.02), and healthy volunteers (128 +/- 107 ng/g, P less than 0.001). In patients with ileoanal anastomosis and pouchitis, increased platelet-activating factor production could be implicated in the inflammation and ulcerations observed in the reservoir. 
Chronic perineal pain related to sacral meningeal cysts. Chronic perineal pain is an often encountered problem that is difficult to evaluate. Based on a series of 17 patients in whom urological, gynecological, and anorectal pathology was excluded, the authors compared magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) with computed tomographic (CT) scan with myelography in the investigation of chronic perineal pain. After a clinical neurological examination, patients underwent radiodiagnostic imaging of both techniques. Thirteen patients (76%) had one or more sacral meningeal cysts (MC) on MRI scan, whereas CT scan with myelography of the lumbar and sacral region revealed 7 patients (41%) with sacral MC. Sacral MC may be the etiology of chronic perineal pain in many instances, and MRI scan appears to be superior to CT scan with myelography in demonstrating sacral MC. Ten patients with sacral MC were operated on with moderate to excellent results 6 months after operation. Early postoperative results are encouraging, but further follow-up and larger series are required. 
Treatment of posterior urethral strictures with a titanium urethral stent. A total of 5 patients with recurrent posterior urethral strictures underwent endoscopic placement of an expandable endourethral stent made of titanium. Patient age ranged from 17 to 66 years (mean age 42.6 years). Followup ranged from 13 to 20 months (mean 14.1 months). Of the patients 4 presently have unobstructed voiding with no incontinence. To date no side effects have been directly related to the stents and no incrustations or calculi have formed. Our preliminary study supports the use of titanium urethral stents as an alternative form of treatment for selected urethral strictures. 
Low-dose aspirin therapy for chronic stable angina. A randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trial. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the efficacy of low-dose aspirin in the primary prevention of myocardial infarction among patients with chronic stable angina. DESIGN: A randomized, double-blind, trial. PATIENTS: The study included 333 men with baseline chronic stable angina but with no previous history of myocardial infarction, stroke, or transient ischemic attack who were enrolled in the Physicians' Health Study, a trial of aspirin among 22,071 male physicians. INTERVENTION: Patients were randomly assigned to receive alternate-day aspirin therapy (325 mg) or placebo and were followed for an average of 60.2 months for the occurrence of myocardial infarction, stroke, or cardiovascular death. RESULTS: During follow-up, 27 patients had confirmed myocardial infarctions; 7 were among the 178 patients with chronic stable angina who received aspirin therapy and 20 were among the 155 patients who received placebo (relative risk, 0.30; 95% CI, 0.14 to 0.63; P = 0.003). While simultaneously controlling for other cardiovascular risk factors in a proportional hazards model, an overall 87% risk reduction was calculated (relative risk, 0.13; CI, 0.04 to 0.42; P less than 0.001). For the subgroup of patients with chronic stable angina but no previous coronary bypass surgery or coronary angioplasty, an almost identical reduction in the risk for myocardial infarction was found (relative risk, 0.14; CI, 0.04 to 0.56; P = 0.006). Of 13 strokes, 11 occurred in the aspirin group and 2 in the placebo group (relative risk, 5.4; CI, 1.3 to 22.1; P = 0.02). No stroke was fatal, but 4 produced some long-term impairment of function. One stroke, in the aspirin group, was hemorrhagic. CONCLUSION: Our data indicated that alternate-day aspirin therapy greatly reduced the risk for first myocardial infarction among patients with chronic stable angina, a group of patients at high risk for cardiovascular death (P less than 0.001). Although our results for stroke were based on small numbers, they suggested an apparent increase in frequency of stroke with aspirin therapy; this finding requires confirmation in randomized trials of adequate sample size. 
Haemopericardium and cardiac tamponade complicating pulmonary lymphangioleiomyomatosis. A case of pulmonary lymphangioleiomyomatosis complicated by haemopericardium and cardiac tamponade is reported. This was successfully managed by creating a subdiaphragmatic extraperitoneal window. 
Feasibility of epidural morphine for postoperative analgesia in a small community hospital. The first 6-mo experience of a two-physician APS using primarily epidural morphine in a community hospital is presented. After-hours anesthesia coverage was from home. The only monitoring was by nursing service observation. Complications occurred at incidences comparable to larger studies. Using the precautions outlined in the text, complications were appropriately diagnosed and treated despite the lack of 24-h in-house anesthesia coverage. 
Pain and impairment beliefs in chronic low back pain: validation of the Pain and Impairment Relationship Scale (PAIRS). Few validated instruments are available to assess beliefs and attitudes that patients have regarding pain, or ability to function despite discomfort. The Pain and Impairment Relationship Scale (PAIRS) was developed to tap these important beliefs and attitudes in chronic pain patients. Preliminary data indicate that the PAIRS is internally consistent and significantly related to impairment in a highly selected pain clinic sample of patients, including some chronic low back pain patients. The present study was designed to extend the validation of the PAIRS to a more general sample of chronic benign low back pain patients. Furthermore, additional tests supported the discriminant, convergent and divergent validity, as well as the reliability and relative independence from favorable self-report response bias of the PAIRS, by respectively demonstrating that: (1) the impairment beliefs assessed with the PAIRS were more prominent in chronic low back pain (CLBP) patients than in matched non-pain, healthy controls; (2) scores on the PAIRS were significantly related to measures of physical impairment, but not to physicians ratings of disease severity; (3) the impairment beliefs assessed with the PAIRS are readily distinguishable from cognitive distortions and emotional distress; (4) PAIRS scores for chronic low back pain patients are relatively consistent over time; and (5) PAIRS scores are not significantly associated with measures of favorable self-report response bias. We conclude that the PAIRS has demonstrated at least preliminary utility for applications by researchers and clinicians interested in chronic pain. 
Confirmation of the efficacy of hepatic tissue iron index in differentiating genetic haemochromatosis from alcoholic liver disease complicated by alcoholic haemosiderosis. The hepatic tissue iron index proposed by Bassett et al was evaluated in 35 patients with homozygous genetic haemochromatosis, 67 patients with alcoholic liver disease, and 18 patients with other forms of chronic liver disease with and without cirrhosis. In patients with cirrhosis hepatic tissue iron concentration reliably differentiated alcoholic liver disease from genetic haemochromatosis. Although mean iron concentration was greater in patients with prefibrotic haemochromatosis than in those with prefibrotic alcoholic liver disease, some overlap occurred and complete differentiation of the two conditions was not possible. This overlap was particularly evident in some young patients with haemochromatosis in whom the tissue iron concentration grade fell in the range commonly seen in alcoholic haemosiderosis. Inability to differentiate early genetic haemochromatosis from alcoholic liver disease complicated by haemosiderosis was also a problem with standard Perls's staining. When the hepatic tissue iron index was calculated (hepatic tissue iron concentration/patient's age in years), clear differentiation of genetic haemochromatosis from both alcoholic liver disease and other forms of chronic liver disease was obtained in both cirrhotic and precirrhotic patients. This study confirms that the hepatic tissue iron index is a useful means of differentiating patients with genetic haemochromatosis from those with alcoholic liver disease. We suggest that biochemical estimation of tissue iron concentration and calculation of the tissue iron index in all patients in whom genetic haemochromatosis is a possible diagnosis will reduce the likelihood of misdiagnosing this as alcoholic liver disease. 
Intralesional interferon gamma treatment for keloids and hypertrophic scars. Keloids and hypertrophic scars are characterized by excessive collagen formation. Interferon gamma is a lymphokine that can down-regulate collagen synthesis in vitro and in vivo and, therefore, has potential therapeutic benefit in the management of abnormal scars. Intralesional scar injections of interferon gamma were performed to determine the tolerance toxicity and to obtain preliminary evidence for the efficacy of this treatment in the management of hypertropic and keloid lesions. All scars decreased in linear dimensions and flattened out. Five of 10 scars studied decreased at least 50% in linear dimensions. Interferon gamma can safely be administered intralesionally once per week up to a dosage of 0.05 mg for 10 weeks with no serious toxic effects. The commonest reported side effect was a mild headache. 
Recurrent spinal cord tethering by sacral nerve root following lipomyelomeningocele surgery. Case report. A 21-year-old woman had recurrent progressive weakness/hypesthesia and pain in both lower extremities. At the age of 5 and 19 years, she had undergone surgical resection of a lipomyelomeningocele at L5-S1. Surgical exploration revealed that the cord was tethered and pulled over to the side by an excessively short right S-1 nerve root. The contralateral L-5 and S-1 nerve roots were markedly stretched. Division of the right S-1 nerve root resulted in prompt disappearance of pain in the lower extremities and improvement in neurological function. 
Postoperative deficits and functional recovery following removal of tumors involving the dominant hemisphere supplementary motor area. The supplementary motor area (SMA) is a region located within each cerebral hemisphere at the posterior mesial border of the frontal lobe adjacent to the falx. The functional significance of this area has been somewhat unclear, and information regarding its influence on motor output has largely been based on evoked responses to direct stimulation in primates and humans. In this series of patients with primary and metastatic tumors involving the dominant hemisphere SMA, a distinct pattern of postoperative deficits and recovery has emerged which emphasizes the role of this critical area in the initiation of motor activity, including speech. Based upon this analysis, ablation of this region after first identifying the primary motor cortex may be accomplished without risk of permanent loss of motor activity or speech function, despite the initial severe deficits. 
The relationship between autoantibodies and intrauterine growth retardation in hypertensive disorders of pregnancy. Abnormal levels of autoantibodies have recently been demonstrated in patients with hypertensive disorders of pregnancy and patients whose fetuses have intrauterine growth retardation. We determined total immunoglobulin levels (immunoglobulin G, immunoglobulin M, and immunoglobulin A) and a broad panel of autoantibodies (six antiphospholipid, four antihistone, and four antipolynucleotide antibodies) in 50 normotensive pregnant females, 19 patients with preeclampsia, and 18 patients with chronic hypertension to examine the relationship to intrauterine growth retardation. Mothers who were delivered of infants with intrauterine growth retardation demonstrated significantly more autoantibody abnormalities in the two hypertensive groups and in the normotensive control group as compared with patients delivered of appropriately grown infants. The most frequently observed autoantibody abnormalities were antiphospholipid antibodies and the most frequently observed among those were immunoglobulin G isotypes. Total immunoglobulin levels in both hypertensive and normotensive groups were identical. These results suggest a close association between the degree of B-cell activation and both severity of hypertensive diseases and development of intrauterine growth retardation in their offspring. 
Emergency treatment with recombinant tissue plasminogen activator of pulmonary embolism in a pregnant woman with antithrombin III deficiency. Thromboembolic complications during pregnancy are frequent in patients with congenital antithrombin III deficiency. We report on a 29-year-old patient with congenital antithrombin III deficiency and severe pulmonary embolism treated with recombinant tissue plasminogen activator. The diagnosis of antithrombin deficiency is retrospective. This case indicates that the risk of thrombolytic therapy in this clinical setting might have been overemphasized. 
Tobacco, alcohol, and coffee and cancer of the pancreas. A population-based, case-control study in Quebec, Canada. A population-based, case-control study of pancreatic cancer was carried out in greater Montreal between 1984 and 1988. A total of 179 cases and 239 population-based controls were interviewed. This study was part of the SEARCH program of the International Agency for Research on Cancer of the World Health Organization. A strong positive association was observed between total cigarette smoking and risk of pancreatic cancer (odds ratio [OR] = 3.76; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.80 to 7.83). The OR for current smokers in the highest quintile of number of cigarettes was 5.15 compared with 3.99 for exsmokers. Those who consumed alcohol were in general at lower risk than nondrinkers. Coffee drinkers were collectively at lower risk than nondrinkers, particularly when coffee was consumed with meals, not on empty stomach. 
Induction of T helper cell unresponsiveness to antigen by macrophages from schistosomal egg granulomas. A basis for immunomodulation in schistosomiasis? The present studies were undertaken in an effort to understand the role of mononuclear phagocytes in the regulation of the T cell-mediated granulomatous inflammatory response in experimental murine schistosomiasis mansoni. We report that macrophages from schistosomal egg granulomas did not efficiently stimulate, but rather induced marked proliferative unresponsiveness to Ag in an IL-2-producing, I-Ek-restricted, CD4+ Th cell clone specific for pigeon cytochrome c. The unresponsive state of the T cells was achieved after incubation with granuloma macrophages in the presence of the specific Ag fragment 81-104, but not with either of them independently, and was, similarly, restricted by the I-Ek molecule. Equivalent amounts of peritoneal macrophages from schistosome-infected, but not from normal mice, were also effective in inducing T cell unresponsiveness. We postulate that granuloma macrophages, and potentially other accessory cells in schistosome-infected individuals, are similarly capable of inducing anergy in egg Ag-specific Th cells, and that the resulting inhibited T cell reactivity, which translates into failure of lymphokine secretion and of clonal expansion, represents a major basis of the immunologic down-regulation (immunomodulation) of granulomatous hypersensitivity, characteristically seen in this disease. 
Complex segregation analysis of primary hepatocellular carcinoma in Chinese families: interaction of inherited susceptibility and hepatitis B viral infection. Primary hepatocellular carcinoma (PHC) is extremely common in eastern China, where it is both associated with chronic infection with hepatitis B virus (HBV) and often familial. Complex segregation analysis of 490 extended families was undertaken with liability classes defined by age, sex, and HBV infection status. The maximum-likelihood model suggests that a recessive allele with population frequency approximately .25 yields lifetime risk of PHC, in the presence of both HBV infection and genetic susceptibility, of .84 for males and .46 for females. The model further predicts that, in the absence of genetic susceptibility, lifetime risk of PHC is .09 for HBV-infected males and .01 for HBV-infected females and that, regardless of genotype, it is virtually zero for uninfected persons. Complex segregation analysis therefore provides evidence for the interaction of genotype, environmental exposure, sex and age in determining the occurrence of PHC in this population. 
Repression of the interferon signal transduction pathway by the adenovirus E1A oncogene. The signal transduction pathway initiated by type I interferon (alpha and beta interferons) is inhibited by expression of the adenovirus type 5 E1A oncogene. Cotransfection analyses with the E1A oncogene and an interferon-stimulated reporter gene show that mutations within an amino-terminal domain of the E1A oncoprotein are defective in transcriptional repression. Cotransfection experiments also revealed that the transcriptional repression is mediated through the interferon-stimulated response element (ISRE) found within the promoter of interferon-stimulated genes. Since interferon treatment activates a latent cytoplasmic DNA-binding factor that can recognize the ISRE and subsequently stimulate transcription, the appearance of this factor was analyzed in a cell line that constitutively expresses the E1A oncogene. The DNA binding activity of this transcriptional activator was found to be inhibited in the E1A-expressing cell line. In vitro cytoplasmic mixing experiments with extracts from control and E1A-expressing cells identified a specific component of this multimeric transcription factor to be defective. 
Acute pseudobulbar or suprabulbar palsy. We studied 13 patients with supranuclear lower cranial nerve ("pseudobulbar" or "suprabulbar") palsy of acute onset. While seven patients had had a prior stroke, six patients had no history of stroke. Eight patients experienced a complete bilateral supranuclear lower cranial nerve palsy, which was isolated in five patients and associated with hemiplegia and with hemiparesis in three patients. Pseudobulbar palsy was partial in five patients. Only one patient had neuropsychologic impairment. The pseudobulbar features improved or recovered within a few weeks in all patients. The common characteristic of the lesions on computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging was the interruption of the corticonuclear pathways contrasting with marked sparing of the corticospinal pathways in both hemispheres. These lesions were either an opercular infarct, or a deep infarct in the corona radiata or internal capsule, or a lenticular hemorrhage. Hypertension was the most prevalent concomitant. Our findings suggest that acute pseudobulbar or suprabulbar palsy has rather stereotyped anatomic-vascular correlates and time course. 
Adnexal torsion. An unusual cause of abdominal pain in postmenopausal women. Adnexal torsion is a rare cause of abdominal pain in older women. Because the presenting symptoms and signs are vague, the diagnosis is not often considered. Lower abdominal pain with nausea and vomiting are usual in patients with torsion. Ultrasonography or computed tomography are useful diagnostic tests. Two case reports of older patients with adnexal torsion are presented to emphasize the diagnostic features of this entity, including lower abdominal pain, nausea and vomiting, and abdominal mass. Although the condition is uncommon, adnexal torsion should be considered in the differential diagnosis of acute abdominal pain. 
Value and limitations of color Doppler echocardiography in the evaluation of percutaneous balloon mitral valvuloplasty for isolated mitral stenosis. The limitations of 2-dimensional and pulsed Doppler echocardiography in patients undergoing mitral valvuloplasty are well known. This study was undertaken to assess the value of color Doppler flow imaging in 36 symptomatic mitral stenosis patients who subsequently underwent successful balloon mitral valvuloplasty by comparing the results to those obtained at cardiac catheterization. Color Doppler-guided conventional Doppler assessment agreed well with cardiac catheterization results in classifying mitral stenosis as mild, moderately severe and severe, both before and after valvuloplasty. Color Doppler was also useful in identifying patients who had moderate to severe mitral regurgitation before and after valvuloplasty. Color Doppler flow mapping was more sensitive than oximetry in the detection of iatrogenic atrial septal defects, which were noted in 25 patients. The defects of those patients with smaller defects by color Doppler (diameter less than 0.7 cm) or echocardiographic shunt volume less than 0.7 liters/min tended to close, usually within 6 months, as opposed to those with larger defects or higher shunt volumes, which tended to persist. Echocardiographic shunt volumes revealed a fair correlation with oximetric results. 
Stricture disease: radiology of urethral stents. Self-expanding metal stents are emerging as an effective alternative treatment in the management of urethral obstruction. The radiologic studies of 33 men with anterior urethral strictures (subprostatic, n = 11; bulbar, n = 22) that had recurred despite repeated optical urethrotomy and dilation were reported. In all patients, the stricture was successfully treated with stent insertion. Urethrography performed 1 month later in 19 patients showed an irregular intrastent lumen of varying degrees due to a hyperplastic urothelial reaction confirmed at endoscopy the same day. Available follow-up urethrograms in seven patients at 3 months showed that the hyperplasia was settling, and by 6 months, the intrastent lumen was smooth and of good caliber. Urethrography revealed postoperative structures in 14 patients. Strictures seen at 1 month (n = 6) were due to initial stent misplacement and were treated with the insertion of a second stent. Strictures seen 3 months after insertion (n = 4) occurred within the stent lumen and were considered to be significant at endoscopy in only one patient. Strictures that developed 6-12 months after stent insertion (n = 4) were not within the stent and were considered to represent genuine new strictures. 
Acute and chronic urticaria and angioedema. Urticaria and angioedema are clinical manifestations of various immunologic and inflammatory mechanisms, or they may be idiopathic. The respiratory and gastrointestinal tracts as well as the cardiovascular system may be involved in any combination. Patients with urticaria and/or angioedema can be classified based on pathophysiologic mechanisms into those with IgE-dependent or complement-mediated immunologic disorders, those with nonimmunologic disorders in which there is a direct effect on the mast cell or on arachidonic acid metabolism, and those whose condition is idiopathic. Evaluation of patients should focus on a thorough history. Laboratory tests provide minimal additional information. About one half of patients with urticaria alone and 25% with urticaria and angioedema or angioedema alone are free of lesions within 1 year. With urticaria, angioedema, or both, 20% of patients experience episodes for more than 20 years. 
Hematologic effects of stem cell factor in vivo and in vitro in rodents. Recombinant rat stem cell factor (rrSCF) administered to rats as a single intravenous injection causes a dose-dependent neutrophilia and lymphocytosis as well as the appearance of immature myeloid cells and occasional blast cells in the circulation. Neutrophilia begins at 2 hours, peaks at 4 to 6 hours, and subsides between 12 and 24 hours. Lymphocytosis occurs at 0.5 hours and has subsided by 2 hours. rrSCF-induced neutrophilia and lymphocytosis are abrogated by boiling, demonstrating that endotoxin-contamination of the rrSCF preparation is not responsible for the observed hematologic effects. The bone marrow at 6 hours after injection of rrSCF shows a left-shifted myeloid and erythroid hyperplasia as evidenced by significant increases in the absolute numbers of morphologically recognizable early myeloid and erythroid precursors. A concurrent decrease in the absolute numbers of mature marrow neutrophils is noted, suggesting that the release of marrow neutrophils contributes to the peripheral neutrophilia. After 2 weeks of daily injections of rrSCF, bone marrow smears demonstrate a remarkable mast cell hyperplasia accompanied by a decrease in total marrow cellularity and by a striking erythroid and lymphoid hypoplasia. rrSCF also causes mast cells to appear in the circulation and causes a systemic increase in embryonic connective tissue-type, but not mucosal-type, mast cells. In vitro long-term culture of lineage-depleted mouse bone marrow cells with rrSCF results in an almost pure outgrowth of mast cells. 
Cervicofacial cystic hygroma. Patterns of recurrence and management of the difficult case. Cystic hygromas usually present in infancy or early childhood as compressible masses that may rapidly and intermittently enlarge. While they may arise in any anatomic location, hygromas of the head and neck are especially difficult to manage since enlargement may cause serious sequela such as airway obstruction, feeding difficulties, and speech pathology. Complete extirpation of these lesions is often impossible, and recurrence rates are accordingly high. We reviewed our 10-year experience in treating cervicofacial cystic hygromas. Of 34 patients, 21 had lesions cephalad to the hyoid and 13 had lesions caudal to the hyoid. While none of the 13 children with infrahyoid lesions demonstrated feeding or respiratory difficulties, eight of 21 children with suprahyoid involvement presented with dysphagia or airway compromise. The recurrence rates for infrahyoid and suprahyoid lesions were 15% and 81%, respectively. Those children with suprahyoid hygromas also experienced an increased operative complication rate compared with patients with infrahyoid involvement. Principles of management for suprahyoid and infrahyoid lesions are described, including the specific management of lingual, submandibular, parotid, and parotofacial hygromas. 
Multisystem failure and hepatic microvesicular fatty metamorphosis associated with tolmetin ingestion. Multisystem toxicity including both renal and hepatic failure has been reported with the use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. We report a fatal case of multisystem failure associated with tolmetin ingestion in a 15-year-old girl. Microvesicular fatty change was found in the liver at autopsy. To our knowledge, this is the first reported case of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug-associated multisystem failure to have this histopathologic finding. 
Maximal sniff mouth pressure compared with maximal inspiratory pressure in acute respiratory failure. Inspiratory muscle strength most often is better reflected by sniff Pes than PImax against occlusion. Furthermore, sniff Pes can be estimated noninvasively by the measurement of sniff Pmo in normal subjects and in patients with respiratory muscle weakness. The aim of this study was to compare sniff Pmo and P.PImax to assess inspiratory muscle strength in patients with acute respiratory failure. The highest pressure was produced by P.PImax in 61 percent of measurements, and by sniff Pmo in 39 percent. Above 35 cm H2O P.PImax yielded the highest pressure in 55 percent of cases and the ratio sniff Pmo/P.PImax was 1.20 +/- 0.54. Below 35 cm H2O, P.PImax yielded the highest pressure in 75 percent of cases and the ratio sniff Pmo/P.PImax was 0.76 +/- 0.35 (p less than 0.02). Thus, measurements of sniff Pmo and P.PImax complement one another for assessing inspiratory muscle strength. However, sniff Pmo underestimates inspiratory muscle strength in patients with severe inspiratory muscle weakness. 
Lightning and its effects on the auditory system. Patients struck by lightning can present with a wide variety of unusual otologic problems including burns to the external auditory canal, tympanic membrane rupture, middle ear injury, and sensorineural hearing loss. Four patients who incurred various otologic problems, including one patient with previously unreported bilateral oval window fistulas following lightning injury, are presented. Audiologic, otologic, and surgical findings are reviewed as well as patient follow-up and outcome. 
Isovolumic relaxation sound: a new class of added heart sound? An early diastolic sound in a patient with apical left ventricular disease is reported. Pulsed Doppler echocardiography showed blood flow within the left ventricular cavity during the isovolumic relaxation period whose peak flow velocity was synchronous with the onset of this diastolic sound. Because it occurred before filling started it could not have been either a third or fourth heart sound. It must thus represent a distinct and apparently unrecognised class of diastolic sound. 
Clinical correlation with serum-soluble interleukin-2 receptor levels in Guillain-Barre syndrome. In patients with Guillain-Barre syndrome (GBS) soluble interleukin-2 receptor (sIL-2R) levels were elevated compared with those of patients with other neurologic diseases (OND), and of healthy controls. Smaller increases in sIL-2R levels occurred in OND patients compared to healthy subjects. Monitoring of GBS patients clearly demonstrated that decreases in sIL-2R levels correlated with clinical recovery. Thus, T-cell activation may be relevant in the pathogenesis of GBS. 
Effect of triple therapy (antibiotics plus bismuth) on duodenal ulcer healing. A randomized controlled trial. OBJECTIVE: To determine whether antimicrobial therapy for Helicobacter pylori infection accelerates the healing of duodenal ulcers. DESIGN: Single-blind, randomized, controlled trial. SETTING: Veterans Affairs hospital. PARTICIPANTS: One hundred and five patients with endoscopically verified duodenal ulcers. INTERVENTION: Patients received either ranitidine, 300 mg/d, or ranitidine, 300 mg/d, plus "triple therapy" (2 g/d of tetracycline, 750 mg/d of metronidazole, and 5 or 8 bismuth subsalicylate tablets per day). Triple therapy was administered for only the first 2 weeks of ulcer treatment. MEASUREMENTS: Videoendoscopic assessment of ulcer status was done until ulcer healing was complete. Evaluations were done after 2, 4, 8, 12, and 16 weeks of therapy. MAIN RESULTS: Ulcer healing was more rapid in patients receiving ranitidine plus triple therapy than in patients receiving ranitidine alone (P less than 0.01). The cumulative percentages of patients with healed ulcers in the group receiving ranitidine plus triple therapy and in the group receiving ranitidine alone were as follows: 37% and 18% after week 2; 74% and 53% after week 4; 84% and 68% after week 8; 96% and 80% after week 12; and 98% and 84% after week 16. CONCLUSION: Combined therapy with anti-H. pylori agents and ranitidine was superior to ranitidine alone for duodenal ulcer healing. Our results indicate that H. pylori plays a role in duodenal ulcer disease. 
Heart rate variability and cardiac autonomic function in men with chronic alcohol dependence. Cardiac autonomic function was studied in 23 alcohol dependent men by standard tests of autonomic function and measurement of 24 hour heart rate variability. In all there was peripheral or central nervous system damage or both. Standard tests of autonomic function showed vagal neuropathy in seven. The remainder had normal autonomic function tests. Twenty four hour heart rate variability was measured as the standard deviation of the successive differences between RR intervals from an ambulatory electrocardiogram recording. Twenty four hour heart rate variability was significantly lower in both alcohol dependent groups than in controls, but the results in the two alcohol dependent groups were not significantly different from each other. The results of standard tests of autonomic function did not distinguish between the alcohol dependent men with normal autonomic function and controls. The differences in heart rate variability between this group and the controls may have been the result of the ability of this method to detect small changes in autonomic integrity. Cardiomyopathy may also account for some of these differences and such abnormalities should be excluded before results are to be regarded as a reflection of vagal function. Twenty four hour measurement of heart rate variability may be a more useful index of cardiac vagal neuropathy than currently available tests of autonomic function. 
The role of serotonin (5HT2) receptor blockade in myocardial reperfusion injury: effects of LY53857 in a canine model of myocardial infarction. The potential protective effects of serotonin receptor antagonism during the process of acute myocardial infarction were studied in anesthetized male dogs, which were subjected to a 90-min left circumflex coronary artery occlusion followed by 5 h of reperfusion. Either vehicle (0.9% NaCl) or the serotonin (5HT2) receptor antagonist LY53857 was infused i.v. at a dose of 0.5 mg/kg, followed by a constant infusion of 2 mg/kg/min beginning 5 min before left circumflex coronary artery occlusion and continuing throughout the duration of the ischemia and subsequent reperfusion. Verification of functional 5HT2 receptor antagonism in the circulating blood of the LY53857-treated dogs was monitored throughout the experiments by periodic assessment of ex vivo platelet reactivity to exogenous serotonin. After 5 h of reperfusion, the hearts were excised and analyzed utilizing histochemical staining with triphenyltetrazolium, which demarcates myocardial infarct size and anatomical area of myocardium at risk of infarction. There was not a significant reduction of infarct size with LY53857 treatment: control infarct/area at risk = 38.6 +/- 4.7%, n = 9 LY53857 infarct/area at risk = 33.4 +/- 3.8%, n = 6. Similarly, when myocardial infarct size was analyzed as a function of myocardial collateral blood flow, there were no significant effects of drug treatment on the relationship between collateral blood flow and infarct size. The effects of 5HT on neutrophil activation were determined by measuring the potential ability of 5HT to enhance the chemotactic peptide-induced production of superoxide. 5HT did not activate human neutrophils in vitro and LY53857 had no effect on neutrophil superoxide production. 
A rat model of acute liver necrosis induced by a monoclonal antibody to liver-specific antigen and complement. Acute massive hepatic injury was induced in rats by a monoclonal antibody against a rat liver-specific membrane antigen, and its histological characteristics were investigated. A single intravenous injection of murine ascites containing a monoclonal antibody produced numerous hemorrhagic foci of degenerated and necrotic liver cells predominantly in zones 1 (the periportal area) and 2 (the area of transition between the periportal zone and the perivenular zone) of the liver lobule within 10 min. Massive hepatocellular necroses were observed 1 hr later, but no inflammatory cell infiltration occurred in and around the necrotic foci. Immunohistological study demonstrated marked deposition of the third component of the complement system in the necrotic area. Serum complement activity was sharply decreased immediately after the injection of the antibody, suggesting that the hepatic necrosis is ascribable to a complement-mediated immune attack on the liver cell membrane induced by the antigen-antibody reaction. The hepatic necrosis in response to monoclonal-antibody injection did not progress to a chronic disease and healed almost completely, changing to scar tissues within 2 wk. Although it is not clear whether this hepatic injury has any clinical relevance, this antibody/complement model may be useful for investigating the cause and therapy of hepatic diseases such as fulminant hepatitis. 
Residual tumor discovered in routine second transurethral resection in patients with stage T1 transitional cell carcinoma of the bladder. When a second transurethral resection was routinely performed 8 to 14 days after the initial transurethral resection in 46 patients for stage T1 bladder tumors residual disease was found in 20 despite the surgical report of complete resection in 40. In only 13 patients was residual tumor noted at repeat resection by the senior urologist performing the operation and residual tumor was confirmed histologically in 10 of them. The extent of the lesion is easily misjudged even by experienced surgeons. Early cystoscopy cannot exclude residual tumor. Residual tumor is an important cause of early recurrence and repeat resection of stage T1 lesions is recommended. 
Recurrent malacoplakia of the female urethra. Malacoplakia, a rare inflammatory lesion, afflicts the genitourinary system in most cases. A 22-year-old women had a recurrence of urethral malacoplakia that had been excised 5 years earlier. The recurrence was accompanied by staphylococcal infection in the urinary tract. The pathological specimens in both instances had the features typical of malacoplakia with von Hansemann cells and Michaelis-Gutmann bodies. 
Recurrent haemospermia--underlying urogenital anomalies and efficacy of imaging procedures. Recurrent haemospermia is often regarded as "essential". Following routine diagnostic procedures, we found an associated factor in 54 of 72 patients (75%). With one exception (prostatic carcinoma), the benign character of the disease was confirmed. Urogenital infection was the most frequent concomitant finding (50%); in 26 men chronic prostatis was diagnosed. Other disorders such as hypertension and coagulation disorders played a minor role. Additional investigation of the prostate gland and seminal vesicles by transrectal prostatic ultrasonography revealed persistent asymmetry of the latter glands as the main finding in 20 men (28%). In every case seminal vesicle carcinoma was excluded; haemorrhage due to cystic distension, inflammatory lesions or ductal obstruction was associated in all cases with congenital abnormalities, chronic urogenital infection, coagulation disorders or hypertension. 
Viral persistence in neurons explained by lack of major histocompatibility class I expression. Viruses frequently persist in neurons, suggesting that these cells can evade immune surveillance. In a mouse model, 5 x 10(6) cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs), specific for lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV), did not lyse infected neurons or cause immunopathologic injury. In contrast, intracerebral injection of less than 10(3) CTL caused disease and death when viral antigens were expressed on leptomeningeal and choroid plexus cells of the nervous system. The neuronal cell line OBL21 expresses little or no major histocompatibility (MHC) class I surface glycoproteins and when infected with LCMV, resisted lysis by virus-specific CTLs. Expression of MHC heavy chain messenger RNA was limited, but beta 2-microglobulin messenger RNA and protein was made normally. OBL21 cells were made sensitive to CTL lysis by transfection with a fusion gene encoding another MHC class I molecule. Hence, neuronal cells probably evade immune surveillance by failing to express MHC class I molecules. 
Adverse effect of therapeutic vasoconstrictors in experimental acute pancreatitis. Alpha-adrenergic drugs commonly are used to treat hypotension resulting from severe acute pancreatitis. It was shown previously that although systemic arterial pressure is increased by phenylephrine, pancreatic microcirculatory perfusion is decreased. Because inadequate tissue perfusion may be critical in the progression of edematous pancreatitis to parenchymal necrosis, it was hypothesized that vasoconstrictors might be harmful in pancreatitis. Therefore the effect of phenylephrine on cerulein-induced mild pancreatitis were studied. Sprague-Dawley rats (n = 54) were randomly allocated to 6 experimental groups and subjected to the following infusion regimens: (1) cerulein (cae) + phenylephrine (phe), (2) cae + saline (NS), (3) NS + phe, (4) cae + phenoxybenzamine (pbz) + phe, (5) NS + pbz + phe, and (6) NS. Initial and terminal hematocrit, serum amylase activity, and blood ionized calcium concentration were determined. The animals were killed 9 hours after starting the infusion. Macroscopic and histologic changes were scored by a 'blinded' pathologist. Phenylephrine increased the severity of cerulein-induced pancreatitis as manifested by statistically significant adverse changes in serum amylase, hematocrit, ionized calcium, peripancreatitic soap formation, and acinar cell vacuolization. These changes were antagonized by alpha-adrenergic receptor blockade with phenoxybenzamine. It is concluded that phenylephrine is deleterious in acute experimental pancreatitis, the first demonstration of such an effect by a pharmacologic vasoconstrictor, and suggested that microcirculatory changes may be important in the transition of mild to severe pancreatitis. Caution in the use of vasoconstrictor drugs in patients with acute pancreatitis is recommended. 
Opercular cheiro-oral syndrome. Perioral and distal upper limb sensory dysfunction (cheiro-oral syndrome) has classically been attributed to cortical involvement. In previously reported cases of the syndrome, caused by stroke, however, the thalamus or brain stem has been the actual site of the lesion. We have studied two patients with infarct in the superficial middle cerebral artery territory involving the parietal operculum. Sensory involvement was purely subjective in the face, but severe hypoesthesia was present in the distal upper limb, involving mainly position sense, stereognosis, and graphesthesia. Temperature and pain sensation were involved in one patient. These findings correlated with involvement of the lower part of the postcentral gyrus, more caudal parts of the parietal operculum, and underlying white matter. This opercular cheiro-oral syndrome seems more uncommon than faciobrachiocrural hemihypesthesia associated with anterior parietal artery territory infarct. A double supply to the parietal opercular region through branches of the temporal arteries and anterior parietal artery may explain the rarity of cheiro-oral syndrome resulting from hemisphere stroke, because simultaneous and partial compromise to two different pial artery networks is uncommon. 
Determinants of one-year outcome from balloon aortic valvuloplasty. Balloon aortic valvuloplasty (BAV) has been a therapeutic alternative treatment for severe symptomatic aortic stenosis. Previous studies have been unable to predict 1-year outcome because of limited acute and follow-up clinical, invasive and echocardiographic data. The purpose of this study was to predict long-term outcome based on comprehensive data obtained at the time of valvuloplasty and at 3 and 6 months after the procedure. Of 170 consecutive patients undergoing BAV, 108 (mean age 78 years) were at least 1 year from their procedure. Prospective clinical, micromanometer hemodynamic, digital ventriculographic and echocardiographic/Doppler data were collected at baseline and immediately after the procedure. Echocardiographic data were also obtained at 3 and 6 months. With use of Cox model analysis, major events (defined as cardiac death [n = 30], aortic valve replacement [n = 21] or repeat BAV [n = 13]) were predicted by advanced age, baseline heart failure class, and baseline echocardiographic-determined diastolic left ventricular diameter. Only baseline left ventricular ejection fraction proved to be a significant predictor of cardiac death (p = 0.002) in a multivariate model. Absolute values after BAV (stroke work, first derivative of left ventricular pressure, valve area, end-systolic volume, Fick cardiac output, transvalvular gradient) and acute changes measured by catheterization or echocardiography did not provide additional predictive information over that of post procedure ejection fraction. Similarly, echocardiographic valve area and transvalvular gradient at 3 months added no further prognostic data. With an ejection fraction greater than or equal to 45% (n = 63), cardiac survival at 1 year was 80%, irrespective of age, sex, congestive heart failure class or severity of coronary artery disease. 
The prevalence and management of bronchial anastomotic complications in lung transplantation. The prevalence and management of bronchial anastomosis complications have been assessed in a series of 53 patients undergoing lung transplantation. Of the 50 patients subsequently at risk of airway complications, these problems occurred in seven (14%). Only one patient died as a direct result of the airway complication (2%). Four patients required airway stenting, and their management is discussed. Although airway healing is normal in the majority of patients undergoing lung transplantation (86%), when deficits occur they can usually be successfully managed with conservative treatment. Bronchial stenting may be required on either a temporary or a permanent basis. 
A limitation of endoscopic ultrasound: an unusual case of early gastric cancer overlying a pancreatic rest. Endoscopic ultrasonography (EUS) has been developed as a valuable tool for examining the depth of carcinoma invasion and evaluating the submucosal tumors of the gastrointestinal tract. In the present case, that of a 60-yr-old woman, the work-up of radiography and conventional endoscopy revealed an ulcerating cancer of the stomach. Subsequent EUS showed a solid high-echoic mass occupying the third (submucosal) and fourth (muscularis propria) layers of gastric wall, suggestive of an advanced cancer invading the muscularis propria. However, histologic examination of the surgical specimen showed that this tumor was early submucosal carcinoma confined to the surface of a pancreatic rest. Retrospective evaluation of EUS pictures proved that the mass had tubular or circular echoless structures associated with thickening of the fourth layer, suggesting the pancreatic rest. Our experience in reviewing EUS findings of this tumor seems noteworthy, inasmuch as EUS indicates that EUS may provide certain characteristic features of gastric pancreatic rest that should be differentiated from invading carcinoma. 
Tibial meniscal dynamics using three-dimensional reconstruction of magnetic resonance images. The human knee joint represents a complex biomechanical system of which the menisci are an integral component. At present, little data exists describing the meniscal kinematics of the intact knee. Accordingly, a three-dimensional reconstruction magnetic resonance image model was used to explore this issue. Five fresh cadaveric knees were examined by magnetic resonance imaging throughout a full range of motion at 10 degrees intervals. Computer three-dimensional images of the menisci were generated and evaluated for anteroposterior excursion and deformation. During flexion, the posterior excursion of the medial meniscus was 5.1 mm, while that of the lateral meniscus was 11.2 mm. The anterior horn segments were shown to be more mobile than the posterior horn segments bilaterally. Prior limitations of meniscal kinematic assessment may be overcome with advanced imaging techniques such as magnetic resonance imaging and three-dimensional reconstruction. The menisci are highly mobile and easily deformed structures within the intact, cadaveric knee. This imaging technique may prove useful in the elucidation of meniscal dynamics. In the future, similar techniques may be applied clinically to aid in the diagnosis of joint dysfunction. 
Peer problems in Tourette's disorder. To explore the social adjustment and peer relationships of children with Tourette's disorder, 29 patients with mild to moderate Tourette's disorder were studied. Children underwent neuropsychological testing. The patients completed self-esteem scales and their parents and teachers completed behavior rating scales. Peer relationships were examined with the Pupil Evaluation Inventory, which is a sociometric questionnaire completed by the child's classmates and provides measures of aggression, withdrawal, and likability. As a group, Tourette's disorder patients were significantly more withdrawn, more aggressive, and less popular than their classmates. Thirty-five percent of the children with Tourette's disorder received the lowest rating in the class on one or more of the Pupil Evaluation Inventory factors. These social problems were not predicted by the frequency or duration of tics. A clinical diagnosis of attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder and teachers' ratings on the summary scale of the Child Behavior Checklist and the Pupil Evaluation Inventory did predict poor adjustment. It is concluded that social adjustment is a major difficulty for many children with Tourette's disorder, irrespective of tic severity. 
Color Doppler imaging in the management of intraocular tumors. Forty-four intraocular mass lesions were studied using a new, non-invasive ultrasound technique known as color Doppler imaging (CDI). This technique displays color-encoded Doppler flow information throughout a two-dimensional gray scale image thus providing selective analysis of Doppler spectra in small vessels using pulsed Doppler. Abnormal Doppler shifts were demonstrated within 39 neoplastic lesions studied, but Doppler shifts could not be detected in three tumor-simulating lesions. In a group of 12 choroidal melanomas studied after radiation therapy, lower Doppler shifts were seen compared with a group of 28 tumors before therapy. This change in Doppler shift may reflect the decreased vascular supply of the tumor. Color Doppler imaging may be of value as an additional useful tool in the diagnosis and management of intraocular tumors. 
Fluconazole therapy for chronic disseminated candidiasis in patients with leukemia and prior amphotericin B therapy. OBJECTIVE: To study the efficacy of fluconazole against chronic disseminated candidiasis (hepatosplenic candidiasis) in patients with leukemia in whom amphotericin B treatment had failed. DESIGN: Retrospective analysis of patients with chronic disseminated candidiasis treated with fluconazole on a compassionate investigational new drug protocol. SETTING: Multi-institutional. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Twenty consecutive patients received 100 to 400 mg of fluconazole per day for a median of 30 weeks. All had either failed to respond to treatment with more than 2 g of amphotericin B or had serious amphotericin B-related toxicities. RESULTS: Fourteen of 16 evaluable patients (88%) responded. Responses were observed in seven of nine patients in whom adequate doses of amphotericin B had failed and in all seven patients who had amphotericin B-related toxicities. In 12 patients, cytotoxic chemotherapy was continued without flare of the infection. Fluconazole was well tolerated with rare side effects. Aspergillus superinfection developed in three patients and contributed to the death of two of them. CONCLUSION: Fluconazole is a safe and effective agent with significant activity against chronic disseminated candidiasis. 
Amplified expression of three jun family members inhibits erythroleukemia differentiation. Several different proto-oncogenes have been shown to influence cellular differentiation. One of the most widely studied model systems has been the Friend murine erythroleukemia cell (F-MELC) line, which can be induced to undergo erythroid differentiation by a variety of chemical agents. Constitutive overexpression of either the c-myc or c-myb proto-oncogenes has been previously shown to inhibit F-MELC differentiation, whereas c-myc antisense sequences accelerate the process. To investigate the potential involvement of other proto-oncogenes and immediate early response genes in F-MELC differentiation, we studied the expression of the three known members of the jun family as well as another gene, egr-1, which, like the jun family members, is expressed as an immediate early response gene in growth factor-stimulated quiescent cells. All four genes were expressed in F-MELC, although the levels of expression and modes of regulation differed. Transfection with amplifiable c-jun, junB, or junD expression plasmids inhibited differentiation, whereas transfection with an egr-1 expression plasmid was without effect. These results indicate that jun family members play a role in mediating F-MELC differentiation. The known inhibitory effect of phorbol ester tumor promoters on F-MELC differentiation may be the result of their known stimulation of jun expression. 
The molecular basis for Duchenne versus Becker muscular dystrophy: correlation of severity with type of deletion. About 60% of both Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) and Becker muscular dystrophy (BMD) is due to deletions of the dystrophin gene. For cases with a deletion mutation, the "reading frame" hypothesis predicts that BMD patients produce a semifunctional, internally deleted dystrophin protein, whereas DMD patients produce a severely truncated protein that would be unstable. To test the validity of this theory, we analyzed 258 independent deletions at the DMD/BMD locus. The correlation between phenotype and type of deletion mutation is in agreement with the "reading frame" theory in 92% of cases and is of diagnostic and prognostic significance. The distribution and frequency of deletions spanning the entire locus suggests that many "in-frame" deletions of the dystrophin gene are not detected because the individuals bearing them are either asymptomatic or exhibit non-DMD/non-BMD clinical features. 
Lipoprotein(a) and apolipoprotein changes after cardiac transplantation. Although lipoprotein changes after cardiac transplantation have been documented, the effects of transplantation and subsequent immunosuppressive therapy (particularly the combination of prednisone, azathioprine and cyclosporine) on apolipoprotein levels and lipoprotein(a) have not been reported. Fasting cholesterol, triglycerides, high density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol, low density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, apolipoprotein A-1 and B-100 and lipoprotein(a) were evaluated in 69 consecutive patients during the waiting period before cardiac transplantation. There were 28 deaths before donor organ identification and 41 patients received a cardiac allograft. The lipoprotein levels of transplant recipients were again assayed 3 months postoperatively. Mean (+/- SEM) values increased for total plasma cholesterol (from 180 +/- 8 to 228 +/- 8 mg/dl, p less than or equal to 0.001), triglycerides (from 126 +/- 11 to 207 +/- 14 mg/dl; p less than or equal to 0.001), HDL cholesterol (from 39 +/- 2 to 49 +/- 3 mg/dl; p less than or equal to 0.002) and LDL cholesterol (from 119 +/- 7 to 138 +/- 7 mg/dl; p less than 0.02). Apolipoprotein A-1 and B-100 also increased, but lipoprotein(a) decreased from 11.7 +/- 1.7 to 6.8 +/- 1.1 mg/dl; p less than or equal to 0.0001) after transplantation. Although total cholesterol, triglycerides, LDL cholesterol, apolipoprotein A-1 and B-100 increased dramatically after cardiac transplantation, so did HDL cholesterol, thereby keeping the LDL/HDL cholesterol ratio constant. The surprising decrease in lipoprotein(a) after cardiac transplantation suggests that metabolism of lipoprotein(a) is independent of LDL cholesterol and that immunosuppressive drugs either decrease the synthesis or increase catabolism of lipoprotein(a). 
Acute dependence on depressant drugs is determined by common genes in mice. Withdrawal seizure prone (WSP) and withdrawal seizure resistant (WRS) mice were genetically selected to express severe or mild handling-induced convulsions (HIC), respectively, after cessation of chronic ethanol (EtOH) vapor inhalation. The studies reported here tested WSP and WSR mice to determine whether elevated HIC were seen after administration of acute doses of several drugs that depress central nervous system activity. The drugs tested were EtOH, pentobarbital, t-butanol, acetaldehyde, and diazepam. All drugs initially suppressed HIC in WSP mice. This suppression was followed by an exacerbation of HIC, suggestive of a state of rebound central nervous system hyperexcitability during acute withdrawal. Susceptibility to acute withdrawal seizures was clearly under genetic control, since WSR mice did not display acute withdrawal HIC to any appreciable extent. Acute EtOH withdrawal seizures did not require testing WSP mice repeatedly, as they could be seen upon a single HIC test 8 hr after EtOH injection. Results with acetaldehyde and t-butanol suggest that the formation of acetaldehyde may be sufficient, but is not necessary for the elicitation of acute EtOH withdrawal. Earlier studies had found that WSP mice displayed more severe withdrawal HIC than WSR mice after chronic treatment with t-butanol, phenobarbital, nitrous oxide, or diazepam. The genetic predisposition to chronic EtOH withdrawal HIC in WSP mice generalized to all central nervous system depressants acutely tested, suggesting that acute and chronic withdrawal to all these drugs is largely under the control of a common group of genes. 
Reconstruction of failed lumbar surgery with narrow AO DCP plates for spinal arthrodesis. Forty-five patients underwent surgical reconstruction with transpedicular fixation of the lumbar spine with narrow AO DCP plates. Preoperatively, all patients underwent spinal imaging with either magnetic resonance imaging, computed tomography, or myelogram as well as provocative discography to determine the location and the number of symptomatic segments. The minimum follow-up in this series was 2 years. The determination of solid posterior fusion in the presence of plate instrumentation was difficult. The patients in the series were classified as having 1) solid fusion; 2) radiographic flaws within the posterolateral fusion without implant failure; or 3) frank pseudarthrosis with implant failure. Thirty-six (80%) of the patients had a solid fusion, 9 of whom required an additional anterior interbody fusion to obtain symptom control. Twenty percent of the patients in the series had radiographic evidence of reabsorption without implant failure. Four patients in the series (8.8%) had screw breakage, three of which required anterior interbody fusions. The highest rate of reabsorption and pseudarthrosis implant failure was in the 12 patients who had three-level instrumentation; 33% of these patients required anterior interbody fusion to obtain a solid arthrodesis. The average preoperative pain scale was 8.9, and the average postoperative pain scale was a 3.3. Twenty-two patients in the series were cigarette smokers and had a slightly lower fusion rate than non-smokers. They did, however, have a higher use of narcotics after surgery. Forty percent of the patients in this series continued to have radiculopathy after their reconstruction. This study demonstrates the utility of transpedicular fixation in salvage lumbar surgery in obtaining a solid arthrodesis with a beneficial clinical result. Anterior interbody fusions are highly successful in the management of pseudarthrosis and implant failure after transpedicular instrumentation. 
Role of balloon angioplasty in the treatment of aortic coarctation. Since the initial report of coarctation balloon angioplasty in 1982, several groups have used this technique for native coarctations in neonates, infants, and children and for postoperative recoarctations. However, recommendations for use of balloon angioplasty as a treatment procedure of choice are clouded by reports of aneurysm development at the site of coarctation. Here we review our experience as well as that published in the literature, including Valvuloplasty and Angioplasty of Congenital Anomalies Registry data, and present evidence in support of balloon angioplasty as a therapeutic procedure of choice for treating native and recurrent postoperative aortic coarctations. Balloon angioplasty of native aortic coarctations in 20 neonates and infants 1 year old or less reduced peak systolic pressure gradient across the coarctation from 40 +/- 12 mm Hg (mean +/- standard deviation) to 11 +/- 8 mm Hg (p less than 0.001); no patient required immediate surgical intervention. The residual gradient at follow-up (mean follow-up, 12 months) in 16 infants was 18 +/- 16 mm Hg, a significant improvement (p less than 0.01) compared with preangioplasty values. In none of the patients did an aneurysm develop. Recoarctation developed in 5 (31%) of the 16 infants and was successfully treated either by surgical resection (in 2) or by repeat balloon angioplasty (in 3). A comparison of mortality and recurrence rates between the balloon angioplasty and surgical groups was made with the help of data pooled from the literature published since 1980. The initial (7% versus 23%) and late (2% versus 25%) mortality and recoarctation (11% versus 18%) rates were higher (p less than 0.025) after surgical intervention than after balloon therapy. When only reports in which patients were operated on after 1979 were included in this type of analysis, the initial and late mortality rates remained higher (p less than 0.01) after operation than after angioplasty, and the recoarctation rates became similar (p greater than 0.1). Thirty-two children (greater than 1 year old) underwent balloon angioplasty of native coarctation with a resultant reduction in peak systolic pressure gradient from 48 +/- 19 mm Hg to 10 +/- 9 mm Hg (p less than 0.001), which continued to remain low (14 +/- 11 mm Hg; p less than 0.001) at follow-up catheterization in 24 children 13 months (mean) later. There were no immediate or late deaths. A small aneurysm developed in 1 patient (4%) but did not require intervention. Recoarctation developed in 2 patients (8%), and in both, repeat balloon angioplasty was performed with good results.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS). 
Relation between skin cancer and HLA antigens in renal-transplant recipients BACKGROUND. Recipients of renal allografts are at an increased risk for skin cancer. It is also known that recipients who are homozygous for HLA antigens are at an increased risk for certain cancers, as are those who are mismatched with their donors for these antigens. In a case-control study we assessed the relation between skin cancer in renal-transplant recipients and HLA homozygosity and mismatching. METHODS. Of 764 patients who received renal transplants between 1966 and 1988, 66 had squamous-cell carcinoma or basal-cell carcinoma of the skin after transplantation. HLA homozygosity was assessed in all 66 recipients, and HLA mismatching in 39; the results were compared with those in 124 recipients without skin cancer. We also investigated the relation between skin cancer and the use of immunosuppressive drugs. In separate case-control analyses we investigated the influence of exposure to the sun and keratotic skin lesions on the risk of skin cancer. RESULTS. The risk of squamous-cell carcinoma was increased in recipients mismatched for HLA-B antigens; the relative risks were 2.6 (95 percent confidence interval, 1.1 to 6.5) and 5.0 (95 percent confidence interval, 1.3 to 19.0) with mismatching for one and two antigens, respectively, as compared with no mismatching. Mismatching for HLA-A or HLA-DR antigens had no effect on the risk of squamous-cell carcinoma, and there was no association between mismatches at any of the HLA loci and the occurrence of basal-cell carcinoma. The total doses of azathioprine and prednisone were not associated with the occurrence of skin cancer or with HLA matching. Exposure to sunlight and keratotic skin lesions were strongly associated with skin cancer but not with HLA mismatching. Homozygosity for HLA-DR was more frequent among the patients with squamous-cell carcinoma (relative risk, 2.5; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.95 to 4.6) and among patients with 100 or more keratotic skin lesions (relative risk, 4.8; 95 percent confidence interval, 1.5 to 15.1). CONCLUSIONS. HLA-B mismatching is significantly associated with the risk of squamous-cell carcinoma in renal-transplant recipients, as is HLA-DR homozygosity. An indirect effect on the level of immunosuppression does not appear to explain these findings, nor does exposure to sunlight or the number of keratotic skin lesions account for this observation.
