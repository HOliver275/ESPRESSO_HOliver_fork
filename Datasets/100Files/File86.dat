Porencephalic cyst: a complication of fetal intravascular transfusion. A case of unilateral porencephalic cyst as a result of intravascular intrauterine transfusion is reported. Although other factors may have contributed, fetal bradycardia and relative hyperviscosity as a result of increased fetal hematocrit value were considered to be related to this event. Because some authors recommend direct intravascular transfusion to supraphysiologic hematocrits to prolong the interval between procedures, we would caution the use of this approach on the basis of theoretic considerations and the occurrence of this complication. 
A single-blind comparison of intravenous ondansetron, a selective serotonin antagonist, with intravenous metoclopramide in the prevention of nausea and vomiting associated with high-dose cisplatin chemotherapy Ondansetron (GR 38032F), a selective antagonist of serotonin subtype 3 receptors, is effective in the prevention of emesis associated with cisplatin as well as other chemotherapeutic agents. In this randomized, single-blind, multicenter, parallel group study, we compared the efficacy and safety of intravenous (IV) ondansetron with IV metoclopramide in the prevention of nausea and vomiting associated with high-dose (greater than or equal to 100 mg/m2) cisplatin chemotherapy. Three hundred seven patients receiving their first dose of cisplatin, either alone or in combination with other antineoplastic agents, were randomized to receive ondansetron 0.15 mg/kg IV every 4 hours for three doses or metoclopramide 2 mg/kg IV every 2 hours for three doses, then every 3 hours for three additional doses. The study prohibited the concurrent administration of other antiemetics or dexamethasone. Patients receiving ondansetron had a higher rate of complete protection from emesis (40% v 30%, P = .07), a higher complete plus major response rate (65% v 51%, P = .016), a lower rate of failure (21% v 36%, P = .007), and a lower median number of emetic episodes (one v two, P = .005) than did those receiving metoclopramide. The median time to the first emetic episode was longer on ondansetron (20.5 v 4.3 hours, P less than .001). Adverse events occurred in 48% of patients receiving ondansetron and 69% of those receiving metoclopramide (P less than .001). Akathisia and acute dystonic reactions occurred only on metoclopramide; headache (controlled with acetaminophen) was significantly more frequent with ondansetron. Ondansetron is more effective, produces fewer adverse events, and is easier to administer than metoclopramide for the prevention of emesis associated with high-dose cisplatin chemotherapy. 
Intraarterial portography with gadopentetate dimeglumine: improved liver-to-lesion contrast in MR imaging. Magnetic resonance imaging during arterial portography (MRAP) was performed by the authors in a selected group of 12 patients with hepatic lesions. A low dose of gadopentetate dimeglumine (4 mL of a 0.5-mol/L solution, corresponding to a dose of 0.05-0.07 mmol/kg) was injected into the superior mesenteric artery during acquisition of breath-holding gradient-echo or rapid acquisition spin-echo images. Images were always acquired during the first passage of gadopentetate dimeglumine through the liver parenchyma. An increase in liver-to-lesion contrast was obtained with MRAP imaging (contrast-to-noise ratio = 8 +/- 1.8 vs 19 +/- 2.7). Signal intensity enhancement of the liver was high (signal-to-noise ratio = 9.48 +/- 2.42), while the lesion presented no significant enhancement (signal-to-noise ratio = 0.55 +/- 0.22). Lobar portal vein thrombosis was detected in one patient owing to lack of enhancement of the left lobe of the liver. No side effects related to administration of iodinated and paramagnetic contrast agents were observed. This new technique provides specific enhancement of liver parenchyma with improved liver-to-lesion contrast. 
Improved detection of hypotension by automated noninvasive blood pressure monitoring. This study was undertaken to determine whether the use of automated noninvasive blood pressure monitoring altered the frequency of detection of intraoperative hypotension. We retrospectively reviewed 1,861 anesthetic records from a period in 1987, when blood pressure was obtained manually by auscultation. We compared the records from 1987 with 1,716 anesthetic records from 1989, when automated blood pressure monitors were used universally. The incidences of hypotension requiring vasopressor therapy were determined during the two periods and compared using Student's two-tailed t test. The data revealed that the incidence of detected hypotension increased from 2.4 to 5.2% with the use of automated blood pressure monitors (P less than 0.00002). We conclude that at our hospital the use of automated noninvasive blood pressure monitors increases the incidence of detection of intraoperative hypotension as compared with the use of manual blood pressure measurement. 
Mucinous carcinomas of the colon and rectum. An analysis of 62 stage B and C lesions. The significance of a large extracellular mucinous component in colorectal adenocarcinomas continues to be controversial. We studied 62 stage B and C mucinous carcinomas defined by 60% or greater mucinous component. Sixty of these patients had matched nonmucinous adenocarcinoma controls. Patients with mucinous carcinomas with a residual adenoma had a significantly greater survival than those who did not. Overall, no difference was noted in 5-year survival between patients with mucinous carcinoma and nonmucinous adenocarcinoma (64% each). However, when the stages were considered separately, patients with stage B mucinous carcinoma fared significantly worse and had more local sites of treatment failure. We speculate that patients with stage B mucinous carcinoma may have a worse prognosis owing to the extra-cellular mucin, which may make a complete surgical extirpation more difficult. 
Urokinase-type plasminogen activator is expressed in stromal cells and its receptor in cancer cells at invasive foci in human colon adenocarcinomas. In this study in situ hybridization methods were used to examine biopsy samples from 13 adenocarcinomas of the colon for the presence of mRNA for the urokinase-type plasminogen activator (u-PA) and its specific cell-surface receptor (u-PAR). In all cases, u-PA mRNA was present in fibroblastlike cells in the stroma adjacent to the invasive tumor nodules. Urokinase-type plasminogen activator mRNA was not detected in the malignant cells. All specimens also contained u-PAR mRNA in cells located at the tumoral-stromal interface of invasive foci, but in contrast at least some of these cells were in all but one case identified as being of malignant origin. Stromal cells, probably tumor-infiltrating macrophages and neutrophils, also were positive in these areas. These results support the view that components of the plasminogen activation system may act to influence proteolytic events occurring at the interface between stroma and malignant cells in adenocarcinomas of the colon in humans. 
Mechanisms of tubulointerstitial fibrosis. With regard to tubulointerstitial fibrogenesis we are left with a variety informational gaps regarding nearly all aspects of this clinically important process. Table 2 summarizes a generalized version of fibrogenesis based primarily on investigations in other organs. Extrapolation of data obtained with other fibrogenic systems is useful, but only in so far as it motivates us to adapt and test many of the experimental principles within in the context of the kidney. This begins with a comprehensive examination of the in vivo state, the establishment of adequate animal models, and the dissections of the process in vitro. Key areas for the future are the characterization of the signals involved, the cellular responses to these signals, and the variations in interactions produced by differing inciting fibrogenic conditions. 
A case of gastric plasmacytoma: genetic analysis and immunofixation electrophoresis. A case of early gastric plasmacytoma in a 66-yr-old woman is reported. The demonstration of monotypic IgM lambda immunoglobulin in plasma cells infiltrating the gastric antrum contributed the histological diagnosis. Genetic analysis of the tumor cells confirmed the presence of a monoclonal neoplastic population of plasma cells in the tumor. Monoclonal immunoglobulin (IgM lambda) was demonstrated in serum, not by conventional immunoelectrophoresis, but by a highly sensitive immunofixation electrophoresis technique. Serum monoclonal immunoglobulin disappeared after subtotal gastrectomy. The value of immunofixation electrophoresis of serum protein and DNA analysis of tumor cells was emphasized for the diagnosis of gastric plasmacytoma. 
The selenium-75-homocholic acid taurine test reevaluated: combined measurement of fecal selenium-75 activity and 3 alpha-hydroxy bile acids in 211 patients. The recommended reference values for the selenium-75-homocholic acid taurine (75SeHCAT) test, used in the analysis of chronic diarrhea, were evaluated in 211 patients by comparing simultaneous measurements of 3 alpha-hydroxy bile acids and 75Se activity in daily collected stools. An initial evaluation in 11 patients showed that the fecal collection method, which allows inspection and additional analysis of stools, was equivalent to the abdominal retention method. Selenium-75-HCAT whole-body retention half-life (WBR50) was greater than 2.8 days in less than 10% of the patients with bile acid malabsorption and less than 1.7 days in less than 10% of the normals. We recommend that a 75SeHCAT WBR50 less than 1.7 days is abnormal, a WBR50 greater than 2.8 days is normal, and a WBR50 in the range 1.7-2.8 days is equivocal, which was the case in 48% (94/195) of the patients in this study. 
A randomized comparative study of laser photocoagulation, heater probe, and bipolar electrocoagulation in the treatment of actively bleeding ulcers. A randomized study was performed to compare the efficacy of Nd:YAG laser, heater probe, and bipolar electrocoagulation in the treatment of active bleeding from peptic ulcers. Nine hundred and forty-eight consecutive patients with upper gastrointestinal bleeding underwent endoscopy and 91 patients with active bleeding from peptic ulcer were randomized to receive laser (N = 30), heater probe (N = 31), and bipolar electrocoagulation (N = 30). The angulation of the probe to the ulcer base was assessed at endoscopy. The three treatment groups were comparable in their clinical and endoscopic characteristics. There was no significant difference among patients treated with laser, heater probe, and bipolar electrocoagulation in the rate of re-bleeding (10%, 19.4%, and 10%), duration of hospital stay (4, 4, and 5 days), and proportion requiring emergency surgery (7%, 13%, and 7%), but the cost per patient was higher with laser than heater probe and bipolar electrocoagulation. The angulation of the probe to the ulcer base did not affect the re-bleeding rate. No complication was reported. We conclude that the three modalities were equally effective and safe in endoscopic hemostasis but because bipolar electrocoagulation and heater probe were cheaper, they were recommended for use. 
Exaggerated radiation-induced fibrosis in patients with systemic sclerosis. Four patients with stable systemic sclerosis and limited skin involvement received radiation for the treatment of solid malignant neoplasms. Following localized irradiation, each patient developed an exaggerated cutaneous and internal fibrotic reaction in the irradiated areas. The surface area of fibrosis extended beyond the radiation portals employed, and the fibrotic process was poorly responsive to antifibrotic therapy. Three of the patients died of complications caused by fibrous encasement of internal organs. The extent and severity of postradiation fibrosis in these patients was distinctly unusual. These observations suggest that patients with systemic sclerosis are particularly susceptible to developing excessive radiation-induced fibrosis. 
Case report: epidural and bilateral retroorbital hematomas complicating sickle cell anemia. Early in the course of a painful crisis, a 19-year-old man with known sickle cell anemia (SCA) developed a clinical picture that resembled either early cavernous sinus thrombosis or retroorbital and bifrontal microinfarcts. A brain computer tomography scan demonstrated bilateral retroorbital hemorrhages along with a left frontal epidural hematoma. In the absence of trauma, thrombocytopenia, or any other detectable hemostatic defect, this type of hemorrhagic manifestation in the setting of SCA has not, to our knowledge, been previously reported in the literature. 
Periodic mammographic follow-up of probably benign lesions: results in 3,184 consecutive cases. The author prospectively evaluated the value of periodic mammographic surveillance among 3,184 consecutive cases of nonpalpable, probably benign breast lesions detected with mammography. Follow-up consisted of four mammographic examinations during a 3- or 3.5-year period. Clinical outcome was ascertained in each case after the study period, whether or not patients complied with the protocol. Probably benign lesions were subsequently found to be malignant in 17 cases (positive predictive value for cancer, 0.5%). Fifteen of the 17 cancers were identified by means of interval mammographic change prior to development of a palpable mass; all 17 were stage 0 or stage 1 tumors. All 17 women who had cancer currently show no evidence of tumor recurrence (median duration of follow-up, 5 years). These results should help establish the validity of managing mammographically detected, probably benign lesions with periodic mammographic surveillance. By decreasing the number of biopsies of benign lesions and thereby substantially reducing costs, this approach may help overcome a major barrier to widespread use of mammographic screening. 
Gastric H+,K(+)-ATPase as a therapeutic target in peptic ulcer disease. The presence of unbuffered acid appears to be an essential contributory factor in the pathogenesis of peptic ulcer disease. Treatment has concentrated therefore on the reduction of acidity, and the last decade has seen the widespread and effective use of H2 antagonists. They are, at low doses, more successful in improving the natural history of duodenal ulcer disease than of gastric or esophageal ulceration. The H2 receptor plays a central role in activation of parietal cell acid secretion, and antagonists at this receptor block most (but not all) of the acid secretion due to even gastrinergic or muscarinic (vagal) stimulation. In hypergastrinemic states such as Zollinger-Ellison syndrome, or where acid secretion has to be inhibited by more than 20% over a 24-hr period, such as for treatment of esophagitis, NSAID damage, or gastric ulcers, the dose and frequency of administration of the currently available antagonists must be increased to achieve reliable therapy. This has led to a search for an alternative target for acid inhibitory drugs, such as the gastric acid pump, the H+,K(+)-ATPase. This article focuses on the function of this ATPase and suggests that inhibition of this pump will provide a more efficacious means of reduction of acid secretion by the stomach, hence improving and simplifying therapy of acid related diseases. 
IgA antiendomysial antibody test. A step forward in celiac disease screening. Serum IgA antiendomysial antibodies (EmA) were found in 61 (87%) of 70 adults and children with untreated celiac disease, whereas IgA antigliadin antibodies (AGA) and IgA R1-antireticulin antibodies (R1-ARA) were positive in 71% and 47%, respectively, of the same patients. Two of the nine untreated celiacs negative for IgA EmA showed positivity for IgA AGA. While IgA AGA and R1-ARA disappeared in all the celiacs tested one year after gluten-free diet, IgA EmA persisted at low titer in seven (18%) of these 38 subjects, although the jejunal biopsy showed a complete regrowth of jejunal villi. All the disease control patients as well as the blood donors tested were always negative for the three IgA antibodies. Our results state that the search for both IgA EmA and AGA gives the best results in the screening of celiac disease, since the positivity for at least one of these two antibodies allows identification with a 100% specificity of the 90% of untreated celiac patients. 
Obstructive sleep apnoea syndrome in morbidly obese patients. Twenty-seven morbidly obese patients (13 men and 14 women) with body mass index greater than or equal to 40 kg m-2 were examined. The mean age of the subjects was 36.9 +/- 8.2 years (range 23-51 years), and the mean BMI was 50.2 +/- 6.2 kg m-2 (range 40.0-62.9 kg m-2). A whole-night sleep recording was made for all patients with signs or symptoms indicative of possible obstructive sleep apnoea syndrome (OSAS). If the first nocturnal sleep recording was abnormal, it was controlled after 1 year. Eleven (10 men and one woman) of the 27 patients had an oxygen desaturation index (ODI) of 10 h-1. They were symptomatic with excessive daytime sleepiness or other daytime symptoms of OSAS. The occurrence of OSAS in men and women was 76.9 and 7.1%, respectively. Arterial hypertension was associated with OSAS, but not with smoking or the degree of obesity. Antihypertensive treatment was received by nine of the 27 patients; six of them had OSAS. Thus six of the 11 (54.5%) patients with OSAS and three of the 16 (18.8%) nonapnoeic patients were treated for arterial hypertension (Fisher exact test, P = 0.042). The odds ratio of OSAS for arterial hypertension is 5.2 (95% CI, 0.71-43.6). Vertical-banded gastroplasty was performed in 14 patients, three of whom had OSAS. The selection of patients for gastroplasty was made without taking into account the results of sleep recordings. In the three OSAS patients, a 30-38% reduction in BMI was achieved by surgery. Eight patients with OSAS were treated with an intensified dietary regimen, and the reduction in BMI ranged from -2.6 to 33%. OSAS was either cured or significantly improved in six (55%) patients, with a mean reduction in BMI of 27%, while in patients with persistent OSAS the mean reduction in BMI was only 7%. 
Multiple coronary artery-left ventricular fistulae: clinical, angiographic, and pathologic findings. Multiple fistulae between all 3 major coronary arteries and the left ventricle were found at cardiac catheterization in a 69-year-old woman presenting with typical angina. Subsequent necropsy showed abnormal intramyocardial vessels communicating with the left ventricular lumen. This is the first report to document clinical, angiographic, and pathologic findings in this anomaly. 
Ebstein's anomaly associated with splenomegaly and reversible hypersplenism. A case of Ebstein's anomaly associated with chronic right heart failure, hepatosplenomegaly, and the haematological features of hypersplenism is presented. The haematological abnormalities were corrected after tricuspid valve replacement but recurred with the reemergence of clinical features of right heart failure. 
Possible mechanism of vascular reocclusion after initially successful thrombolysis with recombinant tissue-type plasminogen activator. We studied the effects of urokinase (UK), pro-urokinase (pro-UK), and recombinant tissue-type plasminogen activator (rt-PA) on platelet aggregation and the production of thromboxane A2 (TXA2) in vitro. Both UK and pro-UK inhibited the platelet aggregation induced by adenosine 5'-diphosphate (ADP), collagen, or thrombin in a concentration-dependent manner. In contrast, although a low dose of rt-PA (5 to 10 x 10(4) U/ml) blunted platelet aggregability, a high dose (40 to 60 x 10(4) U/ml) led to platelet hyperaggregation. UK and pro-UK markedly inhibited TXA2 synthesis during ADP-induced platelet aggregation. Despite the significant reduction of TXA2 synthesis by 10 x 10(4) U/ml rt-PA, a concentration of 60 x 10(4) U/ml rt-PA had no effect on synthesis. These results indicate that UK and pro-UK each inhibit platelet function, but a high concentration of rt-PA enhances platelet aggregability. This finding may at least in part contribute to the high incidence of reocclusion after initially successful thrombolysis with rt-PA. 
Transverse versus longitudinal arteriotomy: an experimental study in dogs. An arteriotomy is a commonly used surgical technique. Either a transverse or a longitudinal incision can be made, but no study has been done to determine if one technique results in more stenosis or flow disturbance than the other. Six-millimeter arteriotomies were made on the carotid and femoral arteries of six dogs. Transverse arteriotomies were made on the right, and longitudinal arteriotomies were made on the left. Four weeks later the vessels were reexplored. Duplex scanning was used to assess the amount of turbulence at each arteriotomy. Afterward, latex casts of the arteries were made to determine the percent stenosis caused by each arteriotomy. The mean percent stenosis associated with transverse arteriotomies was 10.5% (+/- 4.4%), versus 22.8% (+/- 9.4%) for the longitudinal arteriotomies, (p = 0.001, matched t test). No difference in the amount of turbulence associated with each technique was demonstrated. A longitudinal arteriotomy results in significantly greater stenosis than does a transverse arteriotomy. Unless there is a specific indication for a longitudinal arteriotomy, a transverse arteriotomy should be used. 
The treatment of small acoustic tumors: now or later? Prior to the advent of microneurosurgery, the operative mortality for acoustic tumor removal was high and management often consisted of observation until sufficient symptoms warranted removal. The treatment of these tumors has evolved, and recent introduction of gadolinium-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) allows the diagnosis of very small intracanalicular acoustic tumors before hearing has been significantly affected. For such tumors, some surgeons advocate the premicrosurgical philosophy of observation rather than removal. Our results of small acoustic tumor removal with attempt at hearing preservation were reviewed. From 1961 to June 1989, 39 acoustic tumors 0.5 cm or less were removed by the middle fossa approach. Measurable hearing was preserved in 67%, and facial function 1 year postoperatively was normal or nearly normal in 97%. There was no other permanent operative morbidity. Given our results, early surgical removal of small acoustic tumors is advocated. 
Localization of nuclear matrix proteins (NMPs) in multiple tissue types with NM-200.4 (an antibody strongly reactive with NMPs found in breast carcinoma). Nuclear matrix proteins (NMP) are nonhistone proteins found in the nucleus of many eukaryotic cells. Furthermore certain NMPs are reported to be cell-type specific and expressed differentially by malignant cells. To study the specificity of NM-200.4 (an antibody reactive to NMPs extracted from cultured breast carcinoma cells of the T-47D line), cancers and benign tissues from multiple body sites were surveyed. All 17 breast carcinomas showed strong reactivity to tumor cell nuclei. Also nuclei from one of two lung carcinomas, a papillary thyroid carcinoma, an ovarian fibroma, and a lymphoma were strongly reactive. One leiomyosarcoma and a dermoid cyst were negative. Although 1 benign breast with duct hyperplasia showed moderate reactivity, only 1 of 10 benign breast biopsies without hyperplasia showed reactivity. Three of 4 skin biopsies, 2 liver biopsies, 6 of 9 kidney biopsies, and 5 of 10 gastrointestinal mucosal biopsies showed reactivity in benign nuclei. It is concluded that, although breast carcinoma nuclei showed the most consistent reactivity for NM-200.4, both benign and malignant nuclei from other body sites also show reactivity. 
Aortic valve replacement for aortic stenosis in persons aged 80 years and over. Seventy-one patients aged greater than or equal to 80 years (mean +/- standard deviation 82 +/- 2) with aortic stenosis or mixed stenosis and regurgitation underwent aortic valve replacement alone (n = 35, group 1) or in combination with a coronary artery bypass procedure without any other valve procedure (n = 36, group 2). Preoperatively, 91% had severe cardiac limitations (New York Heart Association class III or IV). Hospital mortality was 12.7% overall (9 of 71), 5.7% (2 of 35) for group 1 and 19.4% (7 of 36) for group 2. Perioperatively, 1 patient (1.4%) had a stroke. Survival from late cardiac death at 1 and 3 years was 98.2 and 95.5%, respectively, for all patients, 100% for patients who underwent isolated aortic valve replacement, and 96.3 and 91.2%, respectively, for patients who underwent aortic valve replacement plus coronary artery bypass. Eighty-three percent of surviving patients had marked symptomatic improvement. Freedom from all valve-related complications (thromboembolism, anticoagulant, endocarditis, reoperation or prosthetic failure) was 93.3 and 80.4% at 1 and 3 years, respectively. Thus, short- and long-term morbidity and mortality after aortic valve replacement for aortic stenosis in patients aged greater than or equal to 80 years are encouragingly low, although the addition of coronary artery bypass grafting increases short- and long-term mortality. 
Leptomeningeal dissemination of optic pathway gliomas in three children. We treated three children with optic pathway gliomas who had progressive disease associated with metastatic spread to the leptomeninges. One patient had radiographic resolution of leptomeningeal disease after treatment with intravenous carmustine and oral mercaptopurine but died of progressive pulmonary fibrosis. The second patient was treated with intravenous thiotepa, and the leptomeningeal disease remained stable. The third patient was treated with intravenous vincristine sulfate, cyclophosphamide, cisplatin, and etoposide and had a significant size reduction of the leptomeningeal lesion. Although leptomeningeal dissemination is a seemingly rare event, it is important that all children with optic pathway gliomas be considered for this possibility, particularly after the onset of new, atypical neurologic symptoms. 
Continuous spinal anaesthesia for abdominal surgery in a patient receiving amiodarone. The perioperative management of a 57-yr-old patient receiving chronic amiodarone therapy with a continuous spinal anaesthetic for a low anterior resection of the colon is discussed. The most appropriate anaesthetic technique for patients receiving chronic amiodarone therapy remains controversial, but the avoidance of general anaesthesia may be beneficial because of the risk of postoperative pulmonary failure. In this patient continuous spinal anaesthesia was slowly titrated to the desired level, coincident haemodynamic alterations were easily treated as they developed, and high serum local anaesthetic concentrations which occur with other regional anaesthetic techniques were avoided. 
Massive evisceration: a complication following sacrospinous vaginal vault fixation. This report describes a spontaneous vaginal vault prolapse in association with massive evisceration following sacrospinous vaginal vault fixation. Careful attention to surgical technique is critical to the success of the operation. In particular, good apposition of the vaginal vault to the sacrospinous ligament and adequate repair of an enterocele should avoid this complication. 
Long-term bridge to transplantation with the Symbion acute ventricular assist device system. A 48-year-old man was supported for 164 days with Symbion biventricular assist devices. During that time, his cytotoxic antibody screen fell from 97% positivity to less than 10%, enabling cardiac transplantation. Complications during the implantation included a 3-minute episode of amaurosis fugax, one positive blood culture, and anemia, which responded to decreased frequency of blood drawing. He is now alive 7 months after transplantation. 
Intracranial neurenteric cysts. Report of two cases. Two cases of intracranial neurenteric cysts are reported and the literature is reviewed. Neurenteric cysts are rare congenital lesions that tend to occur in the spinal intradural space. An intracranial location is exceptional. 
Selective inhibition of leukemia cell proliferation by BCR-ABL antisense oligodeoxynucleotides. To determine the role of the BCR-ABL gene in the proliferation of blast cells of patients with chronic myelogenous leukemia, leukemia blast cells were exposed to synthetic 18-mer oligodeoxynucleotides complementary to two identified BCR-ABL junctions. Leukemia colony formation was suppressed, whereas granulocyte-macrophage colony formation from normal marrow progenitors was unaffected. When equal proportions of normal marrow progenitors and blast cells were mixed, exposed to the oligodeoxynucleotides, and assayed for residual colony formation, the majority of residual cells were normal. These findings demonstrate the requirement for a functional BCR-ABL gene in maintaining the leukemic phenotype and the feasibility of gene-targeted selective killing of neoplastic cells. 
Twenty-four-hour variation of blood pressure in vascular dementia of the Binswanger type. Using a noninvasive portable blood pressure recorder, we compared 24-hour variations of blood pressure among 1) 35 patients with Binswanger-type dementia, 2) 43 with lacunar-type dementia, 3) 26 with a single lacunar stroke, and 4) 30 controls. Each group was divided into antihypertensive-treated and -untreated subgroups. Among the untreated subgroups, patients with Binswanger-type dementia had significantly greater 24-hour mean systolic blood pressures, 24-hour systolic blood pressure standard deviations, and maximal systolic blood pressure variations than the controls (p less than 0.05). Among the treated patients, blood pressure variability increased similarly in all subgroups with cerebrovascular lesions compared with the controls (p less than 0.05). The nocturnal blood pressure decreases seen in the controls were absent among both untreated and treated patients with Binswanger- or lacunar-type dementia (p less than 0.05). Our results suggest the importance of hypertension, short-term variations in blood pressure, and a sustained nighttime elevation of blood pressure for the pathogenesis of both Binswanger-type and lacunar-type dementia in patients receiving antihypertensive medication. 
Gallstone formation after major abdominal surgery. 84 patients underwent multiple abdominal ultrasound examinations over a median of 36 months (range 6-140). 11 had gallstones at their first ultrasound examination, and were excluded from further analysis. Of the remaining 73 patients, 12 of 47 who underwent major abdominal surgery had gallstones within 14-36 months of operation, compared with 0 of 26 who did not undergo such surgery. The cumulative prevalence of new gallstones within 3 years of major surgery was 28%; no new gallstones were seen from 36 to up to 140 months postoperatively. By univariate and logistic regression analysis, age and major abdominal surgery were the only significant clinical determinants for the appearance of gallstones during follow-up. The findings of this retrospective study indicate that major abdominal surgery may accelerate the development of gallstones in some patients. If confirmed in a prospective study, it may be possible to define groups at high risk of gallstones after surgery and to institute prophylactic measures. 
Comparison of catheter ablation using radiofrequency versus direct current energy: biophysical, electrophysiologic and pathologic observations. The effects of catheter ablation with radiofrequency versus direct current energy were compared in 18 dogs assigned to two groups (of 9 dogs each). Each dog underwent a single ablation at two sites in the left ventricle at energy levels of 100, 200 or 300 J delivered in unipolar configuration to six dogs each. A transient decrease in left ventricular systolic pressure (from 121.3 +/- 24.5 to 94.2 +/- 18.7 mm Hg, p less than 0.01) and wall motion abnormality were noted in dogs with direct current shock. The left ventricular ejection fraction decreased (from 50 +/- 2% to 34 +/- 3%, p less than 0.001) shortly after direct current ablation but improved 4 weeks later to 43 +/- 3%. There were no significant changes in left ventricular pressure, wall motion or ejection fraction in dogs in the radiofrequency ablation group. Sustained ventricular tachycardia (greater than or equal to 30 s) was seen immediately after direct current shock in all dogs, and one dog died of intractable ventricular fibrillation. A 24-h ambulatory electrocardiographic (ECG) monitor obtained immediately after the procedure showed multiple runs of ventricular tachycardia in all dogs exposed to direct current ablation but in only three dogs that underwent radiofrequency ablation. No differences were found in peak creatine kinase, complete blood count with smear and B-beta 15-42 fibrinopeptide levels. Pathologically, direct current-induced lesions were larger (mean length x width x depth 10.9 x 7.5 x 5.2 vs. 4.8 x 4.6 x 4.3 mm) and were poorly circumscribed with inhomogeneous margins of necrosis. 
Impaired lipopolysaccharide-inducible tumor necrosis factor production in vitro by peripheral blood monocytes of patients with viral hepatitis. We investigated lipopolysaccharide-induced tumor necrosis factor production in vitro by peripheral blood monocytes from patients with various liver diseases. Tumor necrosis factor production was found to be significantly reduced in patients with chronic hepatitis B (n = 17; 135 +/- 30 pg tumor necrosis factor/ml; mean +/- S.E.M.) and patients with chronic non-A, non-B hepatitis (n = 15; 212 +/- 22 pg tumor necrosis factor/ml) compared with healthy control individuals (n = 47; 411 +/- 40 pg tumor necrosis factor/ml; p less than 0.0005 and p less than 0.01, respectively). This reduced tumor necrosis factor production was not only seen with an optimal stimulating concentration of lipopolysaccharide (100 ng/ml) but also with suboptimal concentrations (0.1 ng/ml). In contrast to patients with chronic viral hepatitis, monocytes from patients with alcohol-induced cirrhosis (n = 26; 444 +/- 49 pg tumor necrosis factor/ml), primary biliary cirrhosis (n = 7; 412 +/- 81 pg tumor necrosis factor/ml) and alcohol-induced fatty liver changes (n = 5; 401 +/- 62 pg tumor necrosis factor/ml) produced normal amounts of tumor necrosis factor when stimulated with an optimal concentration of lipopolysaccharide. Lipopolysaccharide (0.1 ng lipopolysaccharide/ml)-stimulated peripheral blood monocytes of patients with chronic hepatitis B (n = 15; 102 +/- 32 pg/ml) or non-A, non-B hepatitis (n = 13; 97+/- 16 pg/ml) could not be induced to produce more tumor necrosis factor either when prestimulated with gamma-interferon (170 +/- 45 pg/ml and 149 +/- 32 pg/ml, respectively), a lymphokine known to activate monocytes, or with the cyclooxygenase inhibitor indomethacin to reduce the suppressive effect of prostaglandin E2 (148 +/- 40 pg/ml and 153 +/- 45 pg/ml, respectively. 
The long-term course of Lyme arthritis in children. BACKGROUND AND METHODS. The natural history of Lyme disease is not completely known. We studied the long-term course of Lyme arthritis in 46 children in whom the onset of the disease occurred between 1976 and 1979 and who received no antibiotic therapy for at least the first four years of the illness. RESULTS. Of the 46 children (age range, 2 to 15 years), 33 (72 percent) initially had erythema migrans, 7 (15 percent) had influenza-like symptoms, and 6 (13 percent) had migratory joint pain. These manifestations were followed by brief attacks of arthritis, particularly affecting the knee. The percentage of children with recurrent episodes of arthritis declined each year. By year 4, only 10 children still had a mean of two episodes of arthritis per year; the duration of arthritis was generally longer in older children (P less than 0.05). During the sixth year of illness, two children (4 percent) had keratitis, and more than 10 years after the onset of disease, a subtle encephalopathy developed in two other children. Of the 39 children whom we were able to contact in 1988-1989, 12 (31 percent) still had occasional brief episodes of joint pain and 1 (3 percent) had marked fatigue. All 46 children had positive IgG antibody responses to Borrelia burgdorferi throughout the illness and on long-term follow-up. As compared with those who became asymptomatic, the children with recurrent symptoms more often had IgM responses to the spirochete and had significantly higher IgG titers (P less than 0.05). CONCLUSIONS. The course of initially untreated Lyme disease in children may include acute infection followed by attacks of arthritis and then by keratitis, subtle joint pain, or chronic encephalopathy. 
Lower respiratory tract iron burden is increased in association with cigarette smoking. Iron, by catalyzing the generation of the hydroxyl radical via the Haber-Weiss reaction, may participate in oxidant tissue injury. To determine whether iron might contribute to cigarette smoke-induced lung injury, we estimated the iron content of the lower respiratory tract by measuring intracellular iron content of pulmonary macrophages and extracellular iron content of bronchoalveolar lavage fluid from cigarette smokers and nonsmokers. Bronchoalveolar lavage was performed by using methods that allow for recovery of samples enriched for bronchial and alveolar contents. The intracellular iron content of the alveolar macrophages was determined by staining cytocentrifuged, air-dried pulmonary macrophages with a modified Prussian blue stain and assigning a score of 0 to 3 (0 = no stain, 3 = dense staining throughout the cytoplasm) to 100 macrophages. The extracellular iron level of bronchoalveolar lavage fluid was determined by using modifications of the Ferrozine method of Carter. Macrophage intracellular iron content was measured in a group of cigarette smokers with chronic bronchitis (n = 17), in smokers without chronic bronchitis (n = 15), and in normal volunteers (n = 15). Extracellular iron concentration was determined in a subset of the subjects with chronic bronchitis (n = 12) and in a separate group of normal volunteers (n = 5). The intracellular iron score was elevated in the bronchial sample lavage fluid in both the smokers with chronic bronchitis (45.3 +/- 13.9) and the asymptomatic smokers (26.6 +/- 8.0) compared with the normal individuals (8.1 +/- 1.7, p less than 0.03, both comparisons), but did not differ between the two groups of cigarette-smoking subjects (p = 0.68). 
A selective deficit for writing vowels in acquired dysgraphia Brain-damaged patients with acquired writing disorders provide important information about the normal processes of spelling and writing. Current models indicate that to produce a letter string, its 'abstract' representation is computed and stored in a temporary orthographic buffer, from which it is converted to a verbal code (if the word is to be spelled aloud) or to a physical letter code (if the word is to be written). The stored graphemic representations specify the identity and order of the component letters and their consonant/vowel status. Here I describe the spelling performance of two patients with a selective deficit in writing vowels. When writing words, the first patient omitted all vowels, leaving a blank space between consonants or consonant clusters, whereas the second produced errors that almost exclusively involved vowels. This pattern of performance supports the hypothesis that the consonant/vowel status of graphemes is differentially specified in the spelling process and may be selectively affected after brain damage. 
Repair of coarctation of the aorta in children: postoperative morphology. To determine the morphologic sequelae after surgical repair of coarctation of the aorta, the authors retrospectively reviewed angiograms and hemodynamic and clinical data on 215 patients who underwent cardiac catheterization after surgical repair of coarctation of the aorta during a 13-year period. Ninety-seven patients (45%) underwent coarctation resection with end-to-end anastomosis; 92 (43%), subclavian-flap angioplasties; and 26 (12%), synthetic-patch repairs. Sixty-four patients (30%) had an "aneurysm," defined as a measurement ratio of repair site to diaphragmatic aorta greater than 1.5. Transverse-arch or isthmic hypoplasia or recoarctation was detected in 86 patients (40%) and was most commonly associated with septal defects or obstruction of the left ventricular outflow tract. Pullback systolic pressure gradients at catheterization were significantly higher (P = .0001) in the patients with transverse-arch hypoplasia and recoarctation than in those with ratios of transverse arch to diaphragmatic aorta greater than 0.9. Significant postoperative arch obstructions can be predicted with measurement ratios on the basis of the diameter of the abdominal aorta. 
Elevated intravesical pressure causes arterial hypoperfusion in canine colocystoplasty: a fluorometric assessment. Since 1988 there have been 15 reported cases of late, spontaneously ruptured intestinal cystoplasties at bowel sites remote from the anastomosis. Ischemic necrosis has been suggested as a possible etiology. We examined this hypothesis by quantifying the uptake of intravascular fluorescein in the augmented bowel of adult mongrel canines. There was a statistically significant decrease in fluorescein uptake at high intravesical pressures, which appeared to be most pronounced at the antimesenteric border. This laboratory study supports a recent clinical report of histological changes pathognomonic for chronic ischemia in the augmented bowel of patients with spontaneous rupture. 
Hypertension and vascular disease. The use of antihypertensive drug treatment has altered the natural history of hypertension. Whereas congestive heart failure, cerebral hemorrhage, and renal failure were the major complications of untreated severe hypertension, myocardial infarction and thrombotic stroke have emerged as the major problems in treated hypertensives. None of the major therapeutic trials in hypertension have provided evidence that reducing blood pressure reduces the risk of atherosclerotic complications of hypertension. Hypertension certainly aggravates the severity of atheromatous lesions in experimental animals and, thus, may do so in humans. However, atherosclerosis is more closely related to disturbances in lipoprotein metabolism than to other factors. The common finding that serum cholesterol is raised in hypertensive patients may be due to atherosclerosis being the primary lesion, with the hypertension as a secondary complication rather than the primary lesion. 
Magnetic resonance imaging of great vessel, myocardial, and pericardial disease. The outstanding ability of magnetic resonance imaging to provide anatomic information over a large field of view in any plane in patients of all sizes and body habitus has made it the current modality of choice for evaluating the thoracic aorta and for differentiating constrictive pericarditis from restrictive cardiomyopathy. The lack of radiation exposure makes it particularly advantageous for patients requiring serial studies. It serves as an important clinical adjunct to ultrasound in evaluating diseases of the abdominal aorta, other great vessels, the myocardium, and the pericardium. Myocardial function, thickness, and mass can be assessed without geometric assumptions. Myocardial tagging offers a unique way to study cardiac biomechanics. The combination of anatomic and quantitative functional information becoming available in clinically reasonable acquisition times makes magnetic resonance imaging an increasingly attractive noninvasive tool. The contribution of tissue characterization has been disappointing, but may improve with utilization of contrast agents; that of in vivo spectroscopy remains investigational. 
Lymphocytic adenohypophysitis: a pituitary mass lesion occurring in pregnancy. Proposal for medical treatment. Lymphocytic adenohypophysitis is a nonneoplastic, autoimmune cause of pituitary enlargement and insufficiency. Forty-eight of the 50 reported cases have occurred in women, nearly all in association with pregnancy. Left undiagnosed and untreated, it can progress to pituitary insufficiency and death. Histologic studies show characteristic changes of autoimmune disease with lymphocytic infiltration and destruction of anterior pituitary tissue with fibrotic replacement. Lymphocytic adenohypophysitis is currently diagnosed after other pituitary mass lesions are excluded and has been treated with a combination of neurosurgery and end-organ hormone replacement. However, with improved knowledge of the pathophysiologic characteristics and natural history of the disease and with the ability to make a prospective diagnosis, we believe glucocorticoids may suppress the inflammatory response and protect remaining pituitary tissue. Two previously unreported pregnancy-associated cases are described, including one prospectively diagnosed and treated without neurosurgery during pregnancy. Obstetrician-gynecologists must place lymphocytic adenohypophysitis in the differential diagnosis of pituitary enlargement associated with pregnancy, since treatment is available and the sequelae may be life-threatening. 
The relationship between esophageal motility disorders and microvascular angina. Patients with unexplained chest pain have caused investigators in cardiology, gastroenterology, and psychiatry to find abnormalities with overlap among the three specialties. This article reviews the data concerning the potential interrelation of chest pain of cardiac or esophageal origin. 
Continuous intra-arterial administration of recombinant interleukin-2 in low-stage bladder cancer. A phase IB study. Toxicity and clinical effects of intra-arterial (IA) continuous infusion of recombinant interleukin-2 (rIL-2) were evaluated in twelve patients with low-stage transitional cell carcinoma (TCC) of the bladder (T1NOMO; G1 to G2). rIL-2 dosages were escalated from 18 x 10(3) to 18 x 10(6) IU/m2/d in four groups of three patients. After two 5-day courses, separated by a 48-hour interval, evaluation of clinical response and transurethral resection (TUR) were carried out. World Health Organization (WHO) Grade 3 toxicity occurred in 2 of 12 patients (hypotension/mental confusion and fever, respectively); all side effects rapidly disappeared after infusion was abandoned. No laboratory toxicity developed in any patient. Two pathologically proven complete responses (CR) were achieved using 18 x 10(4) IU/m2/d, and three partial responses (PR) were achieved using 18 x 10(5) IU/m2/d in two patients and 18 x 10(6) IU/m2/d in one patient, giving an overall response rate of 42%. All objective responses are still ongoing after a mean follow-up time of 23 months (range, 12 to 32 months). Local relapses occurred 3 months after TUR only in two nonresponders. 
Chemotherapy and radiation therapy for anal carcinoma. Survival and late morbidity. This study was performed to evaluate the survival and late morbidity rates of a widely used combined chemotherapy and radiation therapy regimen given to patients with carcinoma of the anal canal. One hundred six patients received radiation therapy (5000 cGy given by two anteroposterior-posteroanterior [AP-PA] opposed fields) and chemotherapy (mitomycin C plus 5-fluorouracil [5-FU]) from 1983 to 1989. Patients with primary tumors (n = 86) had a complete response rate of 84% and a 5-year survival rate of 72%. There was no significant difference in survival rate according to tumor stage. Patients with local recurrence (n = 20) after primary surgery had a complete response rate of 50% and a 5-year survival rate of 40%. Fifteen percent of the patients experienced late treatment-related symptoms including anal incontinence, intestinal obstruction, and chronic pelvic pain. The current treatment regimen is effective but carries a considerable risk of complications. As survival rate was independent of tumor stage, the locoregional treatment should probably be less extensive for small tumors than for advanced tumors. This strategy may reduce the late side effects for patients with small tumors without reducing the survival rate. 
Diagnosis and treatment of arachnoid cysts of the posterior fossa. Arachnoid cysts of the posterior fossa are rare. When arachnoid cysts are encountered, the presenting symptoms are frequently otologic, with hearing loss and imbalance occurring commonly. Three cases are presented with a previously unreported otologic symptom, that of bilateral hearing loss, which in one case was fluctuant. None of the patients had the common symptoms of unilateral hearing loss and headache. With the advent of computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging, these cysts may be readily identified, usually with diagnostic imaging alone. Unfortunately there is often a delay in diagnosis because of the vague and fleeting nature of the symptoms. Because no single diagnostic symptom pattern is able to characterize all cases, it is believed computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging or both are indicated in patients with long-standing otologic complaints--even in the absence of unilateral symptoms. Treatment of posterior fossa arachnoid cysts primarily consists of surgical procedures designed to decompress the cyst. In this series, treatment with diuretics alone resulted in improvement of symptoms during several years of followup, with no evidence of enlargement of the cysts. 
Immunologic reactivity in the middle ear in otitis media with effusion. This article reviews the immunologic reactivity in the middle ear in both the human disease and in animal models of otitis media. It differentiates the role of immune complexes in otitis media in the animal model and in the human form of middle ear inflammation. The effect of immunization of the gut on the mucosal immune system in the middle ear is briefly explored, and the source of lymphocytes that make their way into the middle ear mucosa from other parts of the mucosal immune system and systemic immune system are briefly discussed. Finally, work from the author's laboratory on the immune response of children with recurrent otitis media due to nontypable Haemophilus influenzae is summarized. 
Plasma beta endorphin in cirrhosis and renal failure. Whether the plasma concentration of beta endorphin was increased in hepatic cirrhosis like that of smaller opioid peptides methionine enkephalin and leucine enkephalin was determined. Its concentration in chronic renal failure was also measured. Plasma beta endorphin was not significantly raised in cirrhotic patients with or without ascites (medians 5.2 pmol/l and 4.7 pmol/l respectively) compared with disease control subjects (4.9 pmol/l) and healthy control subjects (4.9 pmol/l). In contrast, the peptide was increased 2.5 fold (p less than 0.001) in chronic renal failure (12.4 pmol/l) and was found in many of these patients' urine. The data are compatible with the hypothesis that the liver may play an important role in the elimination of opioid peptides of octapeptide size or less but not the larger peptides such as beta endorphin. 
Blood pressure, pulse, and neurohumoral responses to nitroprusside-induced hypotension in normotensive aging men. In order to assess the effects of age on blood pressure, pulse, and neurohumoral responses to hypotensive stress, we infused nitroprusside into healthy young and old men until mean arterial blood pressure was reduced 20% from basal. Elderly subjects were much more sensitive to nitroprusside. Pulse increases in response to this hypotensive stress were markedly reduced in the elderly, but renin, vasopressin, and norepinephrine responses were not different between young and old. We conclude that cardioacceleration, one of the primary defenses against hypotension, is impaired with age. However, neurohumoral responses to hypotension are intact in the elderly. 
Exercise echocardiography as a screening test for coronary artery disease and correlation with coronary arteriography. We evaluated exercise echocardiography as a screening test for coronary artery disease in 228 patients, all of whom underwent subsequent coronary angiography. After an echocardiogram at rest was obtained, each patient performed maximal, symptom-limited, upright treadmill exercise, immediately after which repeat imaging was performed. The exercise echocardiogram was abnormal if any segment failed to become hypercontractile with exercise, and these regional wall motion abnormalities were used to predict the extent and distribution of coronary disease. At subsequent angiography, coronary stenosis was defined as significant if luminal diameter was reduced greater than or equal to 50%. Compared with electrocardiography, exercise echocardiography was more sensitive (97 vs 51%) and specific (64 vs 62%), and had higher positive (90 vs 82%) and negative (87 vs 28%) predictive accuracies. Exercise echocardiography was also highly predictive of the extent (no, 1-, 2- or 3-vessel disease) and distribution (which vessel) of coronary stenoses. It is concluded that exercise echocardiography is an excellent screening test for the presence, extent and distribution of coronary artery disease. 
Phenytoin-induced elevation of serum estradiol and reproductive dysfunction in men with epilepsy. Reproductive and sexual dysfunction in men with epilepsy has been attributed to androgen deficiency. Low serum free testosterone (FT) levels occur in both hypogonadotropic and hypergonadotropic hypogonadism. Antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) have been implicated. Proposed mechanisms include induction of increased sex hormone binding globulin (SHBG) resulting in decreased FT, as well as dysfunction or premature aging of the hypothalamopituitary-gonadal axis. In an investigation comparing serum reproductive steroid levels among 20 men receiving phenytoin (PHT) monotherapy for complex partial seizures, 21 untreated men with complex partial seizures, and 20 age-matched normal controls, total estradiol levels were significantly higher in the PHT group (56.3 +/- 29.4 pg/ml, mean +/- SD) than in the untreated (32.4 +/- 27.4 pg/ml, p less than 0.01) and normal control (34.3 +/- 12.7 pg/ml, p less than 0.05) groups. The physiologically active non-SHBG-bound serum estradiol levels were also significantly higher in the medicated group (45.1 +/- 21.7 pg/ml) than in the untreated (29.9 +/- 17.2 pg/ml, p less than 0.01) and normal control (31.1 +/- 11.4 pg/ml, p = 0.05) groups. These findings suggest that PHT may lower FT by induction of aromatase, enhancing FT conversion to estradiol, as well as SHBG synthetase. Estradiol exerts a potent inhibitory influence on luteinizing hormone secretion and has been suggested to play a major role in negative feedback in men as well as women. Suppression of LH secretion results in hypogonadotropic hypogonadism. Chronically low FT leads to testicular failure and hypergonadotropic hypogonadism. Finally, estradiol has been shown to produce premature aging of the hypothalamic arcuate nucleus, which secretes gonadotropin-releasing hormone. 
Epiphyseal involvement in osteosarcoma. Plain radiography and magnetic resonance (MR) imaging were used to assess the extent of transphyseal involvement in 15 consecutive patients with long bone osteosarcoma and nonfused epiphyses. The findings were correlated with those from surgical and microscopic pathologic examinations. There were no cases of false-positive findings with either MR imaging or plain radiography. Conventional radiography accurately helped predict transphyseal spread in only nine of 15 cases (60%). Spread to the epiphysis was present in 12 of the 15 cases (80%) and was accurately predicted with MR imaging in all 12 cases. This finding contradicts the common misconception that the physis acts as a "barrier" to tumor spread. 
The stomach in liver cirrhosis. Endoscopic, morphological, and clinical correlations. The stomachs of cirrhotic patients are frequently subject to a number of alterations, detectable by endoscopy, the presence of which indicates a disturbance in the mucosa. Several investigators believe that portal hypertension plays an etiopathogenetic role. Three groups of subjects were studied prospectively: 83 cirrhotic patients with portal hypertension, 53 cirrhotic patients without portal hypertension, and 135 control subjects. Snake skin, scarlatina rash, and petechia were the most frequent endoscopic findings in the cirrhotic patients with portal hypertension (P less than 0.001); these findings were also most frequently present in association with each other in this group. There was no correlation between the endoscopic findings, the clinical gravity of liver cirrhosis (Child-Pugh grade), and the gravity of esophageal varices (Beppu score). There were no characteristic inflammatory findings in the gastric mucosa. Hypergastrinemia was often observed in cirrhotic patients with and without angiodysplasias. 
Occurrence of stroke associated with use/abuse of drugs. Ischemic and hemorrhagic stroke frequently occur in temporal association with use or abuse of illicit and over-the-counter (OTC) sympathomimetic drugs. However, little information is available on the proportion of strokes associated with use/abuse of drugs in specific hospital populations. Between September 1, 1988, and August 1, 1989, 167 of 178 stroke patients entered into the Maryland Stroke Data Bank were asked for a history of drug use or abuse. Information was incomplete in 51 of 167 (31%) patients due to neurologic deficit or lack of inquiry. Eleven of the remaining 116 cases (9.5%) were historically associated with drug use. Age range was 25 to 56 years (mean, 41 years). Stroke associated with drug use occurred in four of 62 (6%) cerebral infarcts, two of 28 (7%) intracerebral hemorrhages, and five of 26 (19%) subarachnoid hemorrhages (p = ns). Drugs included cocaine in five (45%), OTC sympathomimetics in three (27%), phencyclidine in two (18%), and heroin in one (9%). 
Acupuncture and transcutaneous stimulation analgesia in comparison with moderate-dose fentanyl anaesthesia in major surgery. Clinical efficacy and influence on recovery and morbidity The efficacy of acupuncture and transcutaneous stimulation analgesia, supplemented by small doses of fentanyl (mean 1.2 micrograms/kg, SD 1.7) was compared with moderate-dose fentanyl anaesthesia (mean 22.9 micrograms/kg, SD 2.8) in 29 patients who underwent surgery for retroperitoneal lymph node dissection. The present study describes the anaesthetic techniques and comparison of haemodynamics, demand for analgesics after surgery, recovery and blood gases, restoration of urinary and bowel functions, convalescence in terms of self-reliance and the postoperative course in respect of fatigue and morbidity. A more rapid return of consciousness, an absence of hypercapnia and a smaller decrease in pH were observed in patients who received acupuncture and transcutaneous stimulation (p less than 0.05). No clinically relevant disadvantages attributable to the method were demonstrated. 
Self-efficacy and outcome expectancies: relationship to chronic pain coping strategies and adjustment. Recent studies suggest that coping strategies play an important role in adjustment to chronic pain. Identification of factors that influence coping could potentially help clinicians facilitate the use of adaptive coping strategies by pain patients. According to social learning theory, self-efficacy beliefs (judgments regarding one's capabilities) and outcome expectancies (judgments regarding the consequences of behaviors) are significant determinants of coping behavior. This study tested hypotheses derived from social learning theory by examining the contributions of these beliefs to the prediction of coping behavior in chronic pain patients. One hundred and fourteen chronic pain patients completed measures of health-related dysfunction, pain severity, use of 8 coping strategies, and outcome and self-efficacy expectancies regarding these coping strategies. In support of social learning theory, and consistent with research in other areas, the patients' beliefs regarding their capabilities were strongly related to reported coping efforts. Beliefs about the consequences of coping efforts and their interaction with beliefs about capabilities were generally unrelated to coping. These results suggest that treatment should emphasize the actual practice and use of adaptive coping strategies over education about their outcome. 
Control of morbidity due to Schistosoma haematobium on Pemba Island: egg excretion and hematuria as indicators of infection. The variability of Schistosoma haematobium egg excretion using a quantitative syringe filtration technique and the variability of hematuria detected visually and by reagent strips were studied in a population of 520 subjects from the village of Pujini (Pemba Island, Zanzibar, Tanzania) for 6 consecutive days. A high degree of day-to-day variability of egg excretion within subjects was found both in the whole population and in the 5-19 year age group. Subjects with 1 urinary egg count of greater than or equal to 50 eggs/10 ml urine were not similarly classified in 36-61% of the other 5 examinations and 4-16% of their other examinations were negative. Gross hematuria had a specificity of almost 100%, when related to a positive filtration on any day, and was closely related to egg counts of greater than or equal to 50 eggs/10 ml urine. The finding of a strongly positive reaction for hematuria on a given single day was closely associated with the subject having a high egg count (greater than or equal to 50 eggs/10 ml urine) on at least one of the 6 days of the study. At the primary health care level, single highly positive semiquantitative values for hematuria were a more useful diagnostic indicator than a single egg count to select patients with heavy infections for selective population chemotherapy. 
Inflammation at the neuromuscular junction in myasthenia gravis. To better define the pathogenic mechanisms in the antibody-mediated autoimmune disease myasthenia gravis (MG), we analyzed the morphology and electrophysiology of the neuromuscular junction in anconeus muscle biopsy specimens from eight patients with MG and seven control subjects. There were inflammatory cells at the neuromuscular junction in seven of the eight biopsies from MG patients. The endplate index (length of the postsynaptic membrane divided by the length of the apposed presynaptic membrane) was abnormally reduced in all the MG patients, and fiber type grouping, suggestive of reinnervation, was present in six of the eight MG patients. Intracellular recording revealed diminished amplitude of miniature endplate potentials and miniature endplate currents in the MG patients compared with the controls. The time constant of decay of miniature endplate currents did not differ from that of controls, suggesting no change in mean channel open time of the acetylcholine receptor. The endplate receptor sensitivity to iontophoretically applied acetylcholine was also decreased in MG patients compared with controls. The quantal content of neurally evoked endplate potentials was reduced in six of the eight MG patients, demonstrating abnormal presynaptic function as well. The presence of inflammatory cells at the neuromuscular junctions of limb muscles in MG reconciles an apparent disparity between the animal model of MG, experimental autoimmune myasthenia gravis, and the human disease. This study also demonstrates a frequent presynaptic component to the abnormal neuromuscular transmission in MG. 
The role of endogenous free radical scavengers on tissue recovery in the experimental ulcer model. The role of lipid peroxidation and endogenous oxygen-derived free radical scavengers on ischemia-reperfusion injury and tissue recovery in rat ulcer model corresponding to the gastric histopathology was investigated. Male Wistar rats weighting 200-250 g were heparinized before occlusion of the celiac axis for 1.5 h. Endogenous CuZn-superoxide dismutase (SOD), Mn-SOD, glutathione peroxidase, fumarase, cytochrome c oxidase, and thiobarbituric acid-reactive compounds as lipid peroxidation products were measured in the gastric tissue at 3 h, and 1, 2, 4, and 7 days after release and in the controls (no occlusion). At 3 h after release, erosion of the gastric mucosa was observed, and gastric ulcers beyond the muscularis mucosae were present in the gastric body 2 days later. Seven days after release, gastric ulcers had disappeared. Activity levels for all five enzymes (CuZn-SOD, Mn-SOD, glutathione peroxidase, fumarase, and cytochrome c oxidase) were low for days 1-4 after release and did not return to control levels by the seventh day. It was observed that the ulcer formation, as evidenced by the histopathology, was significantly related to the levels of endogenous CuZn-SOD, Mn-SOD, glutathione peroxidase, fumarase, and cytochrome c oxidase activities. Thiobarbituric acid-reactive compounds were also low through the entire course of ulcer formation. The study concludes that decreases in the levels of these oxygen-derived free radical scavengers may result in the formation of gastric ulcers; however, endogenous free-radical scavengers may not correspond with tissue recovery. Lipid peroxidation may not be related to ulcer formation. 
Intestinal absorption of free oral hyperalimentation in the very short bowel syndrome. Ten adult ambulatory patients with the nonactive digestive disease short bowel syndrome were prospectively studied to quantitatively assess their free oral intake and their net digestive absorption of total calories, fat, protein, and carbohydrate during a 3-day period at least 6 months after a resection. The remaining portions of small bowel had a mean length of 75 cm (range, 0-200 cm); the remaining colon lengths had a mean of 67% of normal (range, 0%-100%). The experimental diets were formulated according to a home dietary inquiry. During the study period, pooled intakes and digestive losses were measured for total calories, fat, and protein using the bomb calorimetry, Van de Kamer, and Kjeldahl techniques, respectively. The ingested diet provided 58 +/- 14 kcal.kg-1.day-1 (mean +/- SD) and consisted of 46% carbohydrate, 31% fat, and 23% protein. Net digestive absorption was 67% +/- 12% for total calories, 79% +/- 15% for carbohydrate, 52% +/- 16% for fat, and 61% +/- 19% for protein. The larger net digestive absorption of carbohydrate (P less than or equal to 0.004) compared with fat and protein suggests salvage of colonic cholesterol in short bowel syndrome patients. It is concluded that these patients with the short bowel syndrome adapted to a hypercaloric, hyperprotein diet to compensate for increased fecal losses and that this hyperphagia does not seem to have impaired their net digestive absorption. 
Stanozolol in treatment of leg ulcers due to cryofibrinogenaemia. Five consecutive patients with cryofibrinogenaemia in association with painful leg ulcers and intravascular dermal thrombi were treated with stanozolol, an androgenic steroid with fibrinolytic properties. In all patients treatment was followed by rapid and striking pain relief and healing of the ulcers. Cryofibrinogenaemia was not detected on subsequent laboratory evaluation, and dermal intravascular thrombi had resolved on repeat histological examination. 
Hepatitis C viral RNA in serum of patients with chronic non-A, non-B hepatitis: detection by the polymerase chain reaction using multiple primer sets. The recently introduced antibody test for hepatitis C virus infection has already proved to be valuable in many situations such as screening blood donors and diagnosing chronically infected patients, but this antibody assay has certain limitations. Hepatitis C virus itself is usually present in clinical specimens at very low titers; therefore a useful assay for the virus must have very high sensitivity. We have developed a simple, highly sensitive assay for hepatitis C virus RNA based on the polymerase chain reaction. In this test RNA extracted from hepatitis C virus-infected serum or plasma is used as the template for double polymerase chain reaction with nested primers. Sensitivity studies demonstrate that this assay is able to detect hepatitis C virus at or beyond the sensitivity level of chimpanzee infectivity. Preliminary studies in chronic non-A, non-B hepatitis showed that 16 of 36 patients positive for antibody to hepatitis C virus and 2 of 4 patients negative for antibody to hepatitis C virus were positive in the polymerase chain reaction test. By retesting the polymerase chain reaction-negative patients with several sets of polymerase chain reaction primers, we found hepatitis C virus RNA in 35 of the 40 patients including all 4 seronegative patients. Normal human plasma and plasma from patients with hepatitis B infection did not react in this test. This assay has proved to be valuable for determining the presence of hepatitis C virus RNA in various samples. Furthermore, it offers the possibility of diagnosis of hepatitis C virus infection in patients who do not react in the presently available antibody tests. 
Importance of bone marrow cytogenetic evaluation before autologous bone marrow transplantation for Hodgkin's disease. Alkylating agents used either with or without radiation therapy have been associated with the development of myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) and acute nonlymphoblastic leukemia (ANLL) after treatment of both malignant and nonmalignant disorders. This report describes seven patients with recurrent Hodgkin's disease (HD) evaluated for bone marrow transplantation (BMT) who developed chromosomal abnormalities, and emphasizes the importance of bone marrow cytogenetic studies before bone marrow harvest. Three patients with histologically normal bone marrow underwent autologous BMT and subsequently developed an MDS or ANLL. Four patients had the clonal abnormality detected before bone marrow harvest and did not proceed to BMT. 
Recurrent deletion in the human antithrombin III gene. Eight unrelated patients with recurrent thromboembolism, a family history of thrombosis, and plasma antithrombin III (ATIII) activity/antigen levels consistent with a diagnosis of heterozygous type I ATIII deficiency were studied by polymerase chain reaction/direct sequencing of ATIII gene exon-coding regions. Frameshift mutations of one base and two bases, respectively, were found to have occurred in two unrelated patients at the same GAG codon (Glu 245) within exon 4 of the ATIII gene. A literature search showed six further hitherto unrecognized deletion "hotspots" in four other human genes. These deletion-prone sites exhibited sufficient sequence homology with each other to derive a consensus sequence (T G A/G A/G G A/C), suggesting that deletion in human genes may not only be non-random but also sequence-directed. 
Subacute AIDS-related lumbosacral radiculopathy: a bacterial infection? A case of lumbosacral polyradiculitis in an HIV-1-positive man (CDC IIB) leading to a flaccid paraplegia below the level of L4 is reported. A detailed analysis of several cerebrospinal fluid samples led to the suspicion of a bacterial infection. After treatment with antibiotics and tuberculostatic agents the neuropathy improved and the patient has survived for 2 years. In contrast to similar cases that were probably caused by cytomegalovirus in terminal stages of AIDS, it is argued that an unidentified bacterial infection was the cause of the polyradiculitis in the present case. 
Superior vena cava occlusion in a patient with antiphospholipid antibody syndrome. A 55-year-old woman with a lupus like disease, associated with the lupus anticoagulant, was admitted because of facial edema. Her facial swelling was previously attributed to the steroids she had been taking and they were tapered without improvement. Laboratory tests revealed high titers of anticardiolipin antibodies. Computerized tomography of her chest and Doppler ultrasound examination of her neck veins demonstrated a thrombus in the superior vena cava. She was treated with heparin and was maintained with longterm warfarin therapy with uneventful followup. Superior vena cava obstruction should be added to the long list of thromboembolic complications of the antiphospholipid syndrome. 
Rupture of the internal elastic lamina and vascular fragility in stroke-prone spontaneously hypertensive rats. We studied a possible relation between stroke and an enhanced susceptibility to rupture of the arterial internal elastic lamina by comparing stroke-prone spontaneously hypertensive rats with spontaneously hypertensive rats, which have a very low incidence of stroke. We quantified interruptions in the internal elastic lamina in certain arteries and studied the effect of beta-aminopropionitrile, an inhibitor of cross-link formation in collagen and elastic fibers, on rupture of the internal elastic lamina and on mortality in these two substrains. To eliminate any influence of higher blood pressure in the stroke-prone rats on the parameters studied, we used antihypertensive treatment to obtain equivalent blood pressures in the two substrains. Results showed that stroke sensitivity was associated with an enhanced early spontaneous rupture of the internal elastic lamina in the caudal artery, an increased susceptibility to beta-aminopropionitrile-induced rupture of the internal elastic lamina, and earlier mortality, mainly from aortic rupture, under beta-aminopropionitrile treatment. These findings suggest that stroke-prone rats have an enhanced minor connective tissue defect that is expressed by rupture of the internal elastic lamina and may be related, at least in part, to their greater vascular fragility and increased susceptibility to stroke. 
A "public" T-helper epitope of the E7 transforming protein of human papillomavirus 16 provides cognate help for several E7 B-cell epitopes from cervical cancer-associated human papillomavirus genotypes. We have identified a major T-cell epitope, amino acids 48-54 (DRAHYNI, in one-letter code) in the E7 open reading frame protein of human papillomavirus (HPV) type 16. Lymph node cells from mice immunized with synthetic peptides containing DRAHYNI proliferated and produced interleukin when challenged in vitro with peptide or whole HPV-16 E7 fusion protein. The T epitope was recognized in association with all five major histocompatibility complex class II I-A and I-E alleles tested. Synthetic peptides consisting of DRAHYNI linked to major B-cell epitopes on the E7 molecule formed immunogens capable of eliciting strong antibody responses to HPV-16 E7. The T epitope could provide help for the production of antibody to several B epitopes simultaneously, including a B epitope of HPV-18 E7 protein. Mice immunized with a peptide containing DRAHYNI and B epitope and, at a later date, infected with recombinant vaccinia E7 virus, displayed secondary antibody responses to E7. Because E7 has a role in cell transformation and is the most abundant viral protein in HPV-associated neoplastic cervical epithelial cells, the data have implications for vaccine strategies. 
Retroperitoneal fibrosis as host response to papillary renal cell carcinoma. A case of papillary renal cell carcinoma associated with retroperitoneal fibrosis is described. This type of fibrosis has not been previously reported to be associated with renal cell carcinoma. The case is of additional interest in that it implicates an immune phenomenon in the pathogenesis of the fibrosis, involving both putative tumor antigens and antigens associated with tumor growth but unrelated to tumor cells. 
Classic Kaposi's sarcoma: T-lymphocyte subsets, T4/T8 ratio, and NK cell activity. Lymphocyte function as expressed by T-lymphocyte subsets and natural killer cell activity was evaluated in a group of Israeli patients with classic Kaposi's sarcoma. T-cell subsets were examined in 28 patients, 14 with lesions limited to the lower extremities and 14 with diffuse cutaneous or systemic involvement. CD4 and CD8 lymphocytes and CD4/CD8 ratio were in the normal range in all patients, and mean values of the entire group were similar to a control group. However, CD8 was in the upper limits of the normal range in some patients with diffuse cutaneous or systemic involvement. This factor led to a significantly decreased CD4/CD8 ratio in that group as compared with the group of patients with the disease limited to the lower extremities. Mean values of natural killer cell activity in three effector/target cell ratios were significantly decreased in 13 of the patients with Kaposi's sarcoma with lesions limited to the lower extremities and in all of the patients with normal T-cell subsets and CD4/CD8 ratios. 
Excision of cavernous angioma with preservation of coexisting venous angioma. Case report. The case of a patient presenting with dysphasic seizures due to a cavernous angioma coexisting with a venous malformation is reported. The cavernous angioma was resected with preservation of the venous malformation, as confirmed by postoperative studies. The patient was seizure-free following surgery. 
Resistance to vecuronium in patients with cerebral palsy. To determine the electromyographic response of patients with cerebral palsy to vecuronium, 10 children (mean age, 6 yr 10 mo) without cerebral palsy and 11 children with cerebral palsy (mean age, 10 yr 3 mo) were studied. All patients were undergoing abdominal or orthopedic surgery and were anesthetized with isoflurane and nitrous oxide. The time from intravenous administration of 0.1 mg/kg of vecuronium to 25% recovery of control twitch height was 43.9 +/- 5.3 and 18.9 +/- 1.7 min (mean +/- SEM) in children without and with cerebral palsy, respectively (P less than 0.01). The authors conclude that patients with cerebral palsy are either resistant to vecuronium or have a rapid clearance as evidenced by the rapid recovery from neuromuscular blockade. 
Improved compliance measures: applications in an ambulatory hypertensive drug trial. To assess the value of improved monitoring of medication-taking behavior in a drug trial, we employed a modified pill vial with microcircuitry to record the precise times when the vials were opened. After a 3-week placebo washout period, 21 ambulatory subjects with mild hypertension (mean age, 57 years; 67% men; 76% white) randomly received isradipine or enalapril twice daily in a double-blind titration during 10 weeks. Both drugs achieved a 13% reduction in sitting diastolic blood pressure (p less than 0.01) with minimal symptomatic or laboratory toxicity. Although pill counts indicated near-perfect compliance (92% to 99% for both groups), the electronic monitor showed that fewer than half of all openings occurred at the prescribed interval of 12 +/- 2 hours. Modest overdispensing was documented in the 3 days before scheduled visits. The monitor confirmed that pill count misclassified compliance sufficiency in 22% of visits and permitted more discrete attribution for drug-associated adverse reactions and secondary resistance to treatment. We conclude that the electronic monitor reduces ambiguity about medication compliance and helps interpret both the biology and pharmacology of the trial. 
Influence of contrast media on thrombus formation during coronary angioplasty The influence of contrast media on thrombus formation during percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty was assessed in 124 consecutive patients undergoing coronary angioplasty and receiving either ionic (n = 57) (Group I) or nonionic (n = 67) (Group II) contrast medium. The presence of thrombus was assessed by qualitative analysis of angiograms in identical pre- and postangioplasty projections by four observers who had no knowledge of other data. Quantitation of stenosis severity before and after angioplasty and qualitative analysis of lesion eccentricity and complexity and of the presence of dissection were also performed. Although the baseline clinical characteristics of the two groups (including presenting syndromes and procedural and angiographic variables) did not differ, more patients in Group II than Group I developed new thrombus during coronary angioplasty (18% vs. 4%, p less than 0.02). In particular, patients with a presenting syndrome of recent myocardial infarction or rest angina, or both, and patients with an eccentric coronary plaque were more likely to develop new thrombus if they received nonionic than if they received ionic contrast medium (p less than 0.05). Patients with new thrombus formation and patients with thrombus present both before and after angioplasty had a high incidence of acute procedural complications (36% and 23%, respectively). Patients in Groups I and II had a similar incidence of ischemic events during follow-up. 
Crackles in patients with fibrosing alveolitis, bronchiectasis, COPD, and heart failure. We have studied the crackling lung sounds of ten patients with cryptogenic fibrosing alveolitis, ten with bronchiectasis, ten with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and ten with heart failure by analyzing frequency, waveform, and timing of crackles. The upper frequency limit of inspiratory sounds was higher in CFA than in COPD or in HF. The period of crackling was shorter in COPD than in CFA or BE. Inspiratory crackling terminated significantly earlier in COPD than in CFA, BE, or HF. The initial deflection width and the two-cycle duration of the expanded waveforms of crackles were smaller in CFA than in BE, COPD, or HF. The largest deflection width was smaller in CFA than in BE, HF, or COPD and smaller in BE than in HF. The results indicate that crackling lung sounds in different diseases have distinctive features and that their analysis can be of diagnostic value. 
Effect of coronary reocclusion after initial reperfusion on ventricular function and infarct size. Reocclusion of a coronary artery after thrombolytic therapy occurs in approximately 12% to 33% of patients; however, there are few experimental data concerning reocclusion. Accordingly, to compare the effects of reocclusion versus sustained occlusion on the myocardium, a canine model (n = 12) of 2 h of left circumflex artery occlusion, 1 h of reperfusion and 1 h of reocclusion was studied. In a control group (n = 11), 3 h of circumflex artery occlusion was followed by 1 h of reperfusion. As a result, both groups had the same total duration of ischemia (3 h) and reperfusion (1 h). Hemodynamic measurements, radioactive microsphere injections and two-dimensional echocardiography were performed at baseline, occlusion and reperfusion for both groups and at the end of reocclusion for the experimental group. In vivo risk area was determined with Evans blue dye and infarct size with triphenyltetrazolium staining methods. Similar decreases in myocardial blood flow after coronary occlusion and similar reperfusion blood flows occurred in both groups. Despite intervening reperfusion in the reocclusion group, no significant difference was found in the infarct size/risk area ratio between the reocclusion and control groups (54.5 +/- 6.9% vs. 48.4 +/- 5.1%, respectively, p = NS). Two-dimensional echocardiography demonstrated a similar degree and extent (159 +/- 9 degrees vs. 153 +/- 12 degrees, p = NS) of left ventricular dysfunction with both the occlusion and reocclusion. In addition, there were no significant differences in global or regional left ventricular function between the two groups. However, reocclusion after reperfusion did produce a further deterioration in ischemic zone wall thickening (9.5 +/- 2.0% to 0.7 +/- 1.8%, p less than 0.001). 
Gastrointestinal carcinoid tumors. Fifty-five patients were evaluated and treated for gastrointestinal (GI) carcinoid tumors at our institution from 1968 through 1988. Thirty patients had primary tumors smaller than 1 cm and were treated surgically or endoscopically by local excision, whereas 25 underwent resection with regional lymphadenectomy for larger primaries. At the time of initial treatment 17 patients demonstrated metastasis. Although 13 of these patients had primary tumors larger than 2 cm, in four patients with ileal carcinoids, the primary measured 0.8 to 1.5 cm. Serosal involvement was present in nine of 17 patients with metastasis. With a follow-up range of 3 months to 20 years, six patients have died with metastatic carcinoid tumor, two patients died without evidence of disease, 12 patients are alive with metastasis, and 35 patients are alive, free of disease. In this series three determinants for risk of metastasis in GI carcinoid tumors were evident: primary size, serosal penetration, and primary site in the small intestine. In patients with any of these risk factors, resection with regional lymphadenectomy is recommended. 
Results of a recently instituted programme of thrombolytic therapy in acute lower limb ischaemia. Twenty-eight patients with acute lower limb ischaemia received low dose intra-arterial thrombolytic therapy over a 2-year period. Eighteen patients received streptokinase and ten patients received recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (rTPA). Indications included arterial thromboemboli and graft failures. Mean ischaemic times were similar in both groups. Treatment time to achieve lysis was significantly less with rTPA (P less than 0.01). Subsequent vascular procedures, including angioplasty or reconstruction, were undertaken in 36 per cent of patients. Arterial puncture site bleeding occurred in eight (29 per cent) patients. Three (11 per cent) patients suffered rethrombosis after initial successful lysis. All rethromboses were successfully lysed with rTPA. There were two major amputations. Five (18 per cent) patients died, all lytic failures in the streptokinase treatment group. There were no cerebral haemorrhagic events and no patient died as a result of thrombolytic therapy. Good clinical outcome was obtained in nine of 18 patients treated with streptokinase and in nine of ten patients treated with rTPA. Intra-arterial thrombolysis provides effective therapy with high rates of limb salvage and a low mortality rate. This study suggests that rTPA may be a more effective agent, causing less morbidity, than streptokinase. 
Home parenteral nutrition for patients with inoperable malignant bowel obstruction. The use of home parenteral nutrition (HPN) in patients with inoperable malignant bowel obstruction (IMBO) is controversial. The efficacy, safety, and indications for HPN in these patients is uncertain, and its benefit is difficult to demonstrate. The records of 17 patients (9, ovarian cancer; 4, colon cancer; 4, other) with IMBO receiving HPN managed by the Nutrition Support Team (NST) at Yale-New Haven Hospital from 1980 to 1989 were reviewed. Median survival was 53 days and was longest in the two patients with appendiceal carcinomatosis (208 and 159 days), intermediate in patients with colon cancer (median 90 days), and shortest in patients with ovarian cancer (median 39 days). Survival was unrelated to age or sex. All patients died of their underlying disease; 82% of deaths occurred at home. Only one treatment-related complication requiring readmission occurred. Fourteen patients and their families (82%) perceived their therapy as highly beneficial or beneficial. The NST agreed with this assessment in 11 patients but did not share this perception in three patients. These three patients had a short duration of HPN (less than 25 days) or minimal rehabilitation. It is concluded that HPN for patients with IMBO is associated with a low complication rate, may be most beneficial for those patients with gastrointestinal tract primary tumors, and is usually perceived by patients and care providers as beneficial. HPN has palliative benefit and facilitates compassionate home care for carefully selected patients with IMBO. 
Electrophysiologic effects and clinical hazards of carbamazepine treatment for neurologic disorders in patients with abnormalities of the cardiac conduction system. Carbamazepine, a first-line drug for the treatment of epilepsy and neuralgia, may exert hazardous effects on the cardiac conduction system. Standard ECG and long-term ECG monitoring and invasive electrophysiologic testing were carried out in 10 patients who required this drug for neurologic disorders, but in whom its safe use had been questioned because of symptoms of ECG abnormalities. We observed depression of sinus node function and an atrioventricular conduction delay with a significant prolongation of the PQ interval of 16 msec (9%; 95% confidence interval: 1.9% to 16.5%; p less than 0.05), of which the HV interval was significantly prolonged but not the PA and AH intervals. These effects are in accordance with previously shown class 1A properties. However, the lack of effects on QRS, JT, and QT intervals at normal heart rates is a class 1B characteristic. Thus carbamazepine seems to have composite electropharmacologic actions. A cause effect relationship between carbamazepine treatment and significant arrhythmias was established in five patients. Thus the negative chronotropic and dromotropic effects of carbamazepine may, at least in predisposed patients, induce symptoms confusingly similar to the epileptic seizures it is used to prevent. 
KTP laser stapedotomy: is it safe? Recent published concerns about the potential for visible light lasers to injure the inner ear have led to differing conclusions. While one has advised cautious application of a visible light laser, another eschewed visible light lasers in favor of the CO2 laser. Others have anguished over the efficacy of stapes surgeons as numbers of suitable candidates for otosclerosis surgery decline. In three years' experience with the KTP-532 laser, 80 primary and revision stapedotomies have been completed by this author. The author's experience with low morbidity and high air-bone gap closure rates are presented. The absence of apparent cochlear injury suggests that properly used KTP laser systems are safe. Competitive results were obtained with less than prolific numbers of stapes surgeries. 
Distribution of valvular incompetence in patients with venous stasis ulceration. Valvular incompetence associated with venous ulceration can occur in the superficial, deep, or perforating systems. Duplex imaging was used to evaluate 95 extremities (78 patients) with current venous ulceration to determine the location of incompetence in each extremity. In addition, in 91 of the 95 extremities the area of the venous ulcer was evaluated for the presence of perforating veins or any other superficial veins or both conditions. Sixty-three (66.3%) of the 95 extremities had multisystem incompetence (superficial and perforating plus superficial and deep plus perforating and deep plus superficial and perforating and deep), whereas single system incompetence (superficial plus perforating plus deep) was seen in only 26 (27.3%). Isolated deep incompetence was identified in only two extremities (2.1%). Furthermore, 45% (41/91) of the ulcers had no duplex evidence of any venous abnormality in the ulcer bed. These data show that the site of valvular incompetence occurred in multiple locations, that isolated valvular incompetence of the deep venous system was uncommon, and that perforating veins were not always in the ulcer bed itself. Because standard venous surgery has traditionally been directed toward only one system, this may provide one explanation for ulcer recurrence. Therefore complete venous evaluation with duplex imaging allowing for surgical intervention directed specifically to the sites of involvement in each system is recommended. 
Intracapsular fractures of the neck of femur. Parallel or crossed garden screws? The results of treatment in 242 patients with intracapsular fractures of the neck of femur treated with Garden screws are presented with reference as to whether the screws were crossed or parallel. The incidence both of nonunion and of avascular necrosis was less in those fractures treated with parallel screws. The outcome was also superior if the reduction was good. 
Exercise electrocardiography versus dipyridamole echocardiography testing in coronary angioplasty. Early functional evaluation and prediction of angina recurrence. Recently, we have shown the usefulness of high-dose dipyridamole echocardiography testing (DET) as an exercise-independent method for the evaluation of patients having coronary angioplasty. The purpose of the present study was to determine the value of DET compared with exercise testing in the early functional evaluation after successful percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA) and in the prediction of late recurrence of angina. We performed DET and exercise testing in 52 consecutive patients both before and after successful PTCA. Criteria of positivity for DET were transient dyssynergy absent or negligible in the baseline examination and exercise testing for an ST segment shift greater than 0.1 mV from baseline. All patients had an angiographically successful PTCA: the percent stenosis went from 78 +/- 7% before to 30 +/- 7% after PTCA. Exercise testing was positive in 49 and 29 patients, respectively, before and after PTCA (94% versus 44%, p less than 0.001). DET was positive in 47 patients before and in 10 after PTCA (90% versus 19%, p less than 0.001). Recurrence of angina was found in 18 patients: 14 of 23 with positive and four of 29 with negative exercise testing after PTCA. With DET, recurrence of angina was found in eight of 10 patients with positive and 10 of 42 with negative DET after PTCA. 
Aseptic colon resection by an invagination technique. Experimental study on dogs. A new aseptic colon resection by an invagination technique is presented. The bowel to be resected is invaginated down into the healthy intestine, and the anastomosis is sutured in one layer of continuous suture before transection by a diathermy wire, placed in the intestinal lumen via the anus. Sections of bowel that cannot be invaginated, e.g., because of a tumor, are first removed by transection between pairs of cable ties, which close the lumen. Twenty dogs were operated on without receiving prophylactic antibiotics. In 10, the intestine was transected between cable ties. An imprint, taken from the anastomosis and subcutis, was cultured. The bacterial count at the anastomosis exceeded 100 in only three cases; in the subcutis, this was the case in one dog. One wound infection developed. Serial barium enemas at 1, 2, 3, and 4 weeks revealed no anastomotic leakage. One early death because of a total anastomotic dehiscence was encountered, and two dogs were killed because of wound dehiscence and anastomotic stricture, respectively. It is concluded that, in dogs, the method is easily and safely performed, but further experimental studies are needed. 
The cognitive and psychological sequelae of uncomplicated aneurysm surgery. Many patients are left with psychological symptoms after surgery for a ruptured intracranial aneurysm. Often the reason for these symptoms is not clear. A prospective study was carried out of 27 patients who were in a good (Grade 1 or 2) condition before operation to identify the origin of such symptoms and discover whether the basic techniques of aneurysm surgery could lead to serious psychological sequelae even in the absence of any specific complication. Each patient was given a modified psychometric assessment just before surgery and at the time of discharge from hospital. One year later a full psychometric and social assessment was carried out. Even a temporary worsening of psychometric performance did not occur unless there had been some specific surgical or post-operative problem. Five patients showed worsening of psychometric performance in the immediate post-operative period but by one year, only two of the 27 patients showed any abnormalities on formal psychometric evaluation; in both, clear reasons were evident. Although the majority of patients reported minor psychological symptoms, these had not hindered full functional recovery, and we doubt whether they had any organic basis. It is concluded that aneurysm surgery does not, itself, threaten higher intellectual function unless some specific complication occurs. 
Expression of haptoglobin-related protein in primary and metastatic breast cancers. A longitudinal study of 48 fatal tumors. The ability to establish a prognosis for patients with early breast cancer is an important clinical issue. Recent studies have shown that antibodies to haptoglobin-related protein (Hpr) may be useful in stratifying early patients with breast cancer according to their relative risks of recurrence. Nearly 30% of early breast cancers express proteins bearing Hpr epitopes. Hpr-positive breast cancers are more likely to recur after primary resection and are associated with shorter disease-free intervals. This immunohistochemical study examines temporal changes in Hpr expression during the course of disease in 48 patients with fatal breast carcinoma. Thirty-seven primary tumors (77%) were Hpr positive. Ten of the 11 initially negative tumors (91%) were Hpr positive at the time of recurrence. In contrast, only 10 of the 37 initially positive tumors (27%) were Hpr negative with relapse. Of 18 axillary nodes that were examined, 16 (89%) were Hpr positive; all four lymph nodal metastases in patients with initially negative primary tumors were Hpr positive. The authors conclude that the acquisition of Hpr expression parallels increased malignant potential and that Hpr expression, once acquired, tends to remain a permanent characteristic of any given mammary tumor. 
Valve deformity and balloon mechanics in percutaneous transvenous mitral commissurotomy. Percutaneous transvenous mitral commissurotomy (PTMC) using balloon catheters has emerged as an alternative therapeutic modality for patients with mitral stenosis. When used initially in the United States, a single balloon, designed for peripheral arterial angioplasty, was passed across the intraatrial septum for mitral dilatation. The results were less than ideal, with resultant valve areas between 1.0 and 1.5 cm2. Double balloon dilatation was introduced and yielded valve areas between 1.5 and over 2.0 cm2. However, the double balloon technique is substantially more cumbersome, requires passage of two catheters through the atrial septum with an incidence of atrial septal defect, and results in significant hemodynamic sequelae during the procedure. This report describes a novel single balloon for PTMC. In contrast to the more conventionally used peripheral arterial balloons, this device was specifically designed for mitral stenosis. Results in 25 patients (mean age 60 +/- 5 years; range 29 to 87 years) showed an increase in value area from 0.9 +/- 0.2 cm2 to 1.6 +/- 0.5 cm2 (p less than 0.001). In contrast to the results reported with conventional balloon dilatation, there was no difference in the resultant valve area or in the incidence of complications among patients with more severely deformed valves compared with patients with more "ideal" valves for commissurotomy. An in vitro comparison of the pressure-volume characteristics of the conventional versus the Inoue balloon showed the latter to be more compliant, reaching nominal inflated diameter at 2.0 +/- 0.4 atm versus 3.3 +/- 0.5 atm for conventional balloons (p less than 0.005). 
Much ado about gastrin [editorial; comment] The regulation of gastrin secretion from antral G-cells is of major importance in the physiologic control of acid secretion. Gastrin secretion is highly dependent upon gastric intraluminal pH and is inhibited significantly by a pH of less than 3.0. Acute gastric alkalinization greater than pH 6.0 with antisecretory agents such as H2-receptor antagonists or H+/K+ ATPase inhibitors has little impact on fasting serum gastrin levels but promotes an enhanced sustained rise in meal-stimulated gastrin release. Courses of standard therapy with both H2-antagonists and H+/K+ inhibitors cause a significant rise in 24 h integrated plasma gastrin levels that is inversely correlated to the 24-h integrated gastric acidity. The rise in fasting or integrated plasma gastrin levels observed in patients treated with H2-antagonists is small and of unclear clinical significance. Therapy with antisecretory agents leads to earlier ulcer relapse than with other agents. A variety of factors have been proposed to explain the earlier ulcer relapse rate, including secondary hypergastrinemia with rebound acid hypersecretion after discontinuation of the drug. Secondary hypergastrinemia may also lead to tolerance to prolonged courses of H2-antagonists therapy with a decrease in acid inhibition. This may contribute to break-through ulcer recurrence during maintenance H2-antagonist therapy. However, the relative importance of hypergastrinemia and tolerance to H2-antagonists compared with other factors such as baseline gastric acid secretion, smoking status, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug use, and Helicobacter pylori status is difficult to assess. 
The recognition and control of occupational disease. Occupational diseases account each year in the United States for an estimated 50,000 to 70,000 deaths and 350,000 new cases of illness. Often, however, occupational diseases are not correctly diagnosed, because they mimic diseases due to other causes and because most physicians are not well trained in their recognition. Opportunities for prevention and treatment are therefore lost. The occupational history is the most effective means for proper diagnosis of occupational illness. It should routinely be obtained for every patient. A brief but systematic guide for obtaining an occupational history is presented in this report. Also, approaches are summarized for the recognition and diagnosis of such important occupational diseases as occupational cancer, asbestosis and other respiratory disorders, and occupational neuropsychologic disorders. The management and prevention of occupational diseases depend on reduction of hazardous exposures in the workplace and better education of workers, industrial managers, and physicians. This report outlines a program for the control of occupational disease based on (1) preventing exposures in the workplace, (2) premarket toxicity testing of new chemicals and technologies, and (3) astute clinical diagnosis. 
One gram of aspirin per day does not reduce risk of hospitalization for gallstone disease. Data from 4524 patients in a randomized, controlled trial of aspirin were analyzed to determine if aspirin reduced the risk for hospitalization for gallstone disease. Aspirin at a dose of 1000 mg/day did not reduce the risk of hospitalization for gallstones. Hospitalization rates for gallstone disease were consistent with national rates, and the data confirmed previous associations of gallstone disease with age, elevated serum triglycerides, obesity, and female gender. 
Comparison of insect species associated with decomposing remains recovered inside dwellings and outdoors on the island of Oahu, Hawaii. A comparison of insects collected from 35 cases of decomposing remains on the island of Oahu, Hawaiian Islands (14 from indoor situations and 21 from outdoors), yielded a total of 22 species of insects in 3 orders and 12 families. Of these, five species were recovered in both indoor and outdoor situations. Remains recovered indoors had a greater variety of Diptera larvae associated with them, while remains discovered outdoors had a greater variety of Coleoptera species present. Some species of insects were restricted to remains discovered indoors, while others were found only associated with remains in outdoor situations. Knowledge of the species of insects associated with different habitats may serve to provide information concerning the history of the remains. 
What does Cruzan mean to the practicing physician? The United States Supreme Court's recent decision in the Cruzan case declared that the states have broad powers to formulate their own rules in "right to die" cases. The Court held that competent adults have a constitutionally protected "liberty interest" that allows them to accept or refuse medical treatments. Since liberty interests are subject to rational state regulation, the narrow holding in Cruzan affirmed Missouri's authority to require a "clear and convincing" evidence standard to determine a patient's wishes before life-sustaining treatment could be withdrawn from a formerly competent adult now in a persistent vegetative state. For practicing physicians, some of the implications of Cruzan are as follows: (1) For competent adult patients, physicians should respect patient wishes regarding life-sustaining treatment. (2) Physicians also should discuss with competent patients their wishes for life-sustaining treatment at a future time, when a patient may no longer be able to participate in such decisions. (3) Physicians should record these wishes in a legally acceptable instrument that addresses two aspects of care that may arise in the future if the patient becomes incompetent. What would the patient want done? Who would the patient wish to designate as a surrogate or proxy? (4) For patients who are now incompetent, but for whom decisions must be made about life-sustaining treatment, physicians should focus on the previously expressed wishes of the patient rather than on the patient's current quality of life or on the wishes of the patient's family. 
Two cases of neoplastic angioendotheliomatosis presenting with myelopathy. We describe two patients with autopsy-proven neoplastic angioendotheliomatosis (NAE) presenting only as a transverse myelopathy for 10 to 12 months, followed by disseminated intracranial manifestations. Postmortem examination disclosed a vasculocentric distribution of neoplastic cells in various organs that stained positively with B-lymphocyte-specific monoclonal antibody. These cases were unusual because they manifested as an isolated myelopathy for many months. 
An acquired interatrial fistula secondary to para-aortic abscess documented by transesophageal echocardiography. Para-aortic ring abscess and resulting fistulous communication between adjacent structures frequently occur in prosthetic aortic valve endocarditis but are rarely diagnosed preoperatively. We report a patient who had an abscess involving the aortic-mitral intervalvular fibrosa that eroded into the interatrial septum, causing an interatrial communication with a left-to-right shunt. The abscess was detected by transthoracic echocardiography, but the fistula was only seen by the subsequent transesophageal echocardiogram. To our knowledge, this is the first report of an interatrial fistula secondary to a para-aortic valve abscess and its diagnosis preoperatively. Transesophageal echocardiography should be performed in any patient suspected to have complicated aortic endocarditis. 
Postoperative external alimentary tract fistulas. Most series dealing with external gastrointestinal fistulas cover experience of many years and include a heterogeneous sample of fistulas. We present our experience with 117 cases of postoperative external alimentary tract fistulas treated since 1980. Only fistulas caused by anastomotic leaks and operative injury to bowel are included. The overall mortality rate was 37%. The fistulas are classified into four types: type I-abdominal, esophagus, gastroduodenal (mortality rate, 17%); type II-small bowel (mortality rate, 33%); type III-large bowel (mortality rate, 20%), and type IV-all sites associated with a large abdominal wall defect (mortality rate, 60%). The main cause of death was intra-abdominal infection. Seventy-six percent of the patients required further operations. We conclude that despite the availability of all modern diagnostic and management facilities, postoperative external gastrointestinal fistulas treated during the 1980s continue to represent a surgical "disaster." Only prevention and improved methods in the management of the associated intra-abdominal infections could improve the results. 
Chest pain: an evaluation of the initial diagnosis made by 25 Flemish general practitioners. Twenty-five general practitioners collected information on 318 contacts of patients with a new episode of chest pain, discomfort or tightness. A list of complaints, signs and symptoms were checked, together with the initial diagnosis, made by the GP immediately after the physical examination. The initial diagnosis was compared to a follow-up diagnosis. The gain in certainty was also compared. The GP made a correct initial diagnosis in 82% of patients. In 8% there was a clinically important difference, and seven of 17 episodes of oesophageal disease were missed. For their initial diagnosis, the GP scored 74% certain, 20% uncertain and no diagnosis in 6%. For the final diagnosis, these figures were 88%, 8% and 4%. 
Reversible symptomatic biliary obstruction associated with ceftriaxone pseudolithiasis. Ceftriaxone, a third-generation cephalosporin, has been associated with the development of sludge or stones in the gallbladders of some patients treated with this medication. Such precipitates, which are usually reversible upon discontinuation of the drug, sometimes cause symptoms, have simulated acute cholecystitis, and have even led to cholecystectomy in some cases. We report the first known instance of biliary obstruction and secondary pancreatitis in association with reversible ceftriaxone-induced pseudolithiasis. 
Excimer laser-assisted femoral angioplasty: early results. The ability to ablate atheroma without generating heat makes the excimer laser wavelength a promising intraluminal technique for the treatment of arterial occlusive disease. This series reviews a preliminary experience treating patients with superficial femoral arterial disease admitted with limb-threatening ischemia or claudication. Twenty-six diseased superficial femoral arteries (5 stenotic and 21 occluded) were treated in 23 consecutive patients. Patients with claudication (18) reluctant to undergo bypass or with limb-threatening ischemia (8) at extremely high risk for surgery were included. There were 10 men and 13 women with a mean age of 67 years. A 308 nm excimer laser with an over-the-wire catheter (19) or balloon-centered end-on catheter (7) was used followed by balloon angioplasty. Twenty-four procedures were performed percutaneously, and two were performed with the vessel open in the operating room. Technical success, defined as disobliteration confirmed by angiography and greater than 0.15 increase of the ankle/brachial index, was achieved in 15 of 26. Eleven of 21 occlusions (52%) and four of five stenoses (80%) were opened. Only two of 11 lesions longer than 10 cm were successfully treated. Unsuccessful attempts (technical failure) occurred in 11 of 26 patients and resulted in four elective and one emergency femoral-popliteal bypass. Five patients were discharged with their claudication unchanged, and one had an elective amputation. Six arterial perforations with three arteriovenous fistulas occurred, all resolved without operation. No unanticipated limb loss occurred. In the 15 successful cases, the mean ankle/brachial index increase was 0.34. Seven (47%) of these 15 remain patent with a mean follow-up of 9.5 months (1.5 to 14 months). 
Noninvasive radiological diagnosis of renal vein thrombosis in renal transplantation. Thrombosis of the allograft renal vein is a rare complication of renal transplantation. Of 557 consecutive renal transplants performed between January 1, 1985 and November 30, 1989, 3 cases occurred for an over-all incidence of 0.4%. In 2 cases the diagnosis was made preoperatively with renal scintigraphy and duplex Doppler sonography. No graft was salvaged, despite timely diagnosis in 2 patients. We conclude that the diagnosis of renal vein thrombosis in the renal allograft recipient should be suspected clinically and by the radiographic findings of absent perfusion on renal scintigraphy, and the detection of an arterial signal, albeit abnormal, on duplex Doppler sonography. When diagnosed, nephrectomy appears to be the only treatment. 
Coronary risk factors and the postbypass patient. Atherosclerosis frequently develops in SVGs during the first 10 years. This process appears related to coronary risk factors. Several studies have found an association between hyperlipidemia and atherosclerosis documented at pathology. Late changes attributed to atherosclerosis that were observed at angiography were also significantly related to elevated serum levels of total cholesterol and triglycerides. They also were found in association with diabetes, systemic hypertension, and smoking in some studies. Several clinical studies have documented an association of one or several coronary risk factors with postoperative clinical events, including recurrence of angina, myocardial infarction, heart failure, reoperation because of clinical deterioration, and survival. These factors have been shown to act alone or in combination. The most important is an abnormal lipid profile and diabetes. Smoking and hypertension were seldom found to be significant predictors when considered separately, but appear to play an important role in association with the others. Control of coronary risk factors, particularly hyperlipidemia and smoking, seems mandatory in order to prevent SVG atherosclerosis and progression of the disease in the native coronary arteries. 
Prevention of arterial reocclusion after thrombolysis with recombinant lipoprotein-associated coagulation inhibitor BACKGROUND. This study was designed to determine whether arterial reocclusion after thrombolysis can be prevented by lipoprotein-associated coagulation inhibitor (LACI), a physiological inhibitor of tissue factor-induced coagulation mediated by the extrinsic pathway. METHODS AND RESULTS. Thrombosis was induced in femoral arteries of anesthetized dogs with the use of anodal current to elicit extensive vascular injury and formation of platelet-rich thrombi in one artery and with thrombogenic copper wire to elicit fibrin-rich thrombi without appreciable vascular injury in the contralateral artery. Recanalization of both vessels was induced with t-PA (1.7 mg/kg i.v. over 1 hour) and verified with Doppler flow probes. Reocclusion occurred within 2 hours in seven of seven arteries with electrical injury-induced thrombosis and in four of seven arteries with copper wire-induced thrombosis in the absence of LACI. In dogs given infusions of recombinant DNA-produced LACI (225 micrograms/kg over 15 minutes, followed by 4 micrograms/kg/min i.v.) after completion of the infusion of t-PA, no reocclusion occurred during the 2-hour interval of observation in any of the five arteries subjected to electrical injury (p less than 0.001), and cyclic partial occlusions were nearly abolished (0.4 +/- 0.4/hr in LACI-treated dogs compared with 13.7 +/- 5.5/hr in saline-treated dogs, p less than 0.0001). In contrast, reocclusion occurred in two of five arteries with indwelling copper wires, and cyclic partial occlusions were unaffected despite LACI. LACI prolonged the partial thromboplastin time modestly (1.7 +/- 0.2 x baseline) but did not affect platelet counts or aggregation assessed ex vivo. CONCLUSIONS. Inhibition of the extrinsic pathway of coagulation with LACI prevents thrombotic arterial reocclusion after thrombolysis in vessels subjected to extensive vascular injury. Our results demonstrate that activation of the extrinsic pathway plays a critical role in thrombotic reocclusion and that LACI provides a highly targeted approach to facilitate sustained recanalization without directly inhibiting platelets. 
Heterosexual transmission of hepatitis delta virus in the general population of an area endemic for hepatitis B virus infection: a prospective study. A prospective study was conducted in 268 consecutive patients with overt hepatitis to examine the transmission of hepatitis delta virus (HDV) in the general population of an area hyperendemic for hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection. The patients were interviewed extensively for potential risk factors associated with transmission. Of the 203 patients with type B hepatitis, 34 (30 men, 4 women) showed serologic evidence of acute HDV infection (HDV+ group), while the other 169 did not (HDV- group). Of the 30 HDV+ men, 27 (90%) had had sexual intercourse with prostitutes within 3 months of admission, while only 31 (22.7%) of the 136 HDV- men, 8 (17.4%) of the 46 men with non-A, non-B hepatitis and 5 (8.3%) of the 60 control men had done so (P less than .001). Of the 4 HDV+ women, 1 was a prostitute and another was the wife of a patient with active HDV infection. There was no significant difference in exposure to other risk factors among these groups of patients. The results suggest that heterosexual exposure, particularly prostitute contact, is the most important route of HDV transmission in the general population of this area endemic for HBV infection. 
Portal-systemic encephalopathy: presence of basal ganglia lesions with high signal intensity on MR images. Sixteen patients with cirrhosis of the liver underwent cranial magnetic resonance (MR) imaging and transarterial portography to evaluate the relationship between basal ganglia lesions and portal-systemic collateral vessels. No neuropsychiatric disturbance was observed in any of the patients at the time of the MR examination, but four patients with portal-systemic encephalopathy were included in the study. Basal ganglia lesions, characterized by increased signal intensity on T1-weighted MR images, were observed in nine of the 16 patients, including the four with portal-systemic encephalopathy. These nine patients had large portal-systemic collateral vessels that were more than 10 mm in diameter. These collateral vessels were receiving blood from the superior mesenteric vein (SMV) in all nine patients. The lesions involved the globus pallidus and portions of internal capsules in a bilateral and symmetric fashion and did not exhibit mass effect. The authors conclude that there may be a significant relationship between high-intensity basal ganglia lesions and large portal-systemic collateral vessels receiving blood from the SMV. 
Bladder substitution with ileocaecal (Mainz) pouch. Clinical performance over 2 years. A series of 11 patients underwent ileocaecal bladder substitution (Mainz pouch) with urethral anastomosis after radical cystectomy and pelvic lymphadenectomy for moderate to high grade transitional cell carcinoma of the bladder. With 12 to 27 months of follow-up (mean 18), 6 patients are voiding and are dry day and night with timed voidings; 4 patients continue intermittent catheterisation because of inability to perform the Valsalva manoeuvre adequately, and 1 has a suprapubic tube because of stricture of the enterourethral anastomosis. Upper tract studies revealed dilation of 4 of 22 renal units and 1 patient required endourological intervention. Serum electrolyte studies revealed slightly elevated chloride levels in 6, mild hypocarbia in 3, and reduced vitamin B12 levels in all patients, but no megaloblastic anaemia. The Mainz pouch appears to have very satisfactory short- and intermediate-term results. 
Ifosfamide extrapyramidal neurotoxicity. Ifosfamide-associated central nervous system toxicity has been reported in 5% to 30% of patients treated with ifosfamide. Its pattern is characterized by metabolic encephalopathy with confusion, blurred vision, mutism, auditory or visual paranoid hallucinations, seizures, and rarely coma. The biochemical cause of the neurotoxicity is not understood completely, but it is thought to result from an accumulation of drug metabolites with direct central nervous system effects. A case of ifosfamide neurotoxicity is reported that had unusual extrapyramidal features in a patient treated with a 5-day course of infused ifosfamide. Although usually spontaneously reversible with cessation of drug administration, ifosfamide neurotoxicity occasionally has been associated with prolonged psychopathologic sequelae. Death from irreversible encephalopathy has also been reported rarely. The authors believe that classic extrapyramidal symptoms should be considered to be a part of the neurotoxic profile of ifosfamide. 
Preoperative and postoperative adjuvant chemotherapy using CISCA (cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, and cisplatin) in the treatment of invasive transitional-cell carcinoma of the bladder. Fifteen patients with invasive (T2-T4) transitional-cell carcinoma of the bladder were scheduled for three courses of CISCA followed by radical cystectomy and two additional courses of CISCA. Seven patients completed the entire protocol, and 13 completed all the preoperative courses. Seven of 13 patients demonstrated downstaging of their cancers. Of these patients, one has died, one is alive with disease, and five are free of disease at 7 to 38 (mean 17) months. Of the six patients without downstaging, one survives free of disease at 42 months and one is alive with disease 12 months after cystectomy. Downstaging appears to be an important prognostic indicator. Additional studies are being conducted to determine if neoadjuvant chemotherapy improves long-term survival. 
Evolution of the treatment of the injured colon in the 1980s. During the past 10 years, 1006 patients with colon injuries were treated in an urban trauma center. Primary repair, including suture repair and resection with anastomosis, was performed in 614 patients (61%), colostomy in 284 patients (28%), and exteriorized repairs in 83 patients (8.3%). In the remaining 25 patients (2.5%) who were exsanguinating, the colon injuries were ligated. Independent risk factors for adverse outcomes (defined as a fecal fistula, abdominal abscess, stomal complication, or death from multisystem failure) were identified using multiple logistic regression analysis. These factors were used to match patients at similar risk within different treatment groups, and odds ratios for each treatment were calculated. The odds ratios for primary repair, colostomy, and exteriorized repair were 1.0, 1.9, and 2.0, respectively. Therefore, the chance of an adverse outcome was twice as great for both exteriorized repair or colostomy as for primary repair. It is concluded that further increases in the use of primary repair are warranted. 
CD4+ T cell clones specific for the human p97 melanoma-associated antigen can eradicate pulmonary metastases from a murine tumor expressing the p97 antigen. p97 is a human tumor-associated Ag present on most melanoma cells that represents a possible target for immunologic attack. To evaluate the capacity of T cells reactive with this protein to promote elimination of melanoma cells expressing p97, a murine model was developed by transfecting a C3H/HeN melanoma with the p97 cDNA, generating p97-specific CD4+ T cells by in vivo immunization of C3H/HeN mice with a vaccinia/p97 recombinant virus followed by in vitro cloning with soluble p97 protein, and determining whether these CD4+ T cells could mediate rejection of pulmonary metastases. Characterization of the T cell clones demonstrated the presence of both I-Ak and I-Ek-restricted clones, although the majority of clones recognized p97 in the context of I-Ek. Analysis of clonal specificity using truncated p97 proteins revealed that at least three epitopes were immunogenic, and further studies with overlapping 15-amino acid peptides from a region of the p97 molecule defined by these truncated proteins identified an immunodominant epitope responsible for the majority of the I-Ek response. The T cell clones were not capable of directly recognizing the p97-expressing melanoma cells but responded to the tumor if syngeneic APC were present to process the tumor-derived p97 Ag. The therapeutic efficacy of these CD4+ T cell clones was evaluated in an adoptive therapy model in which mice bearing metastatic pulmonary lesions were treated by i.v. administration of the p97-specific cells. Despite the inability of the CD4+ clones to directly respond to or lyse the tumor cells, the clones were effective in promoting tumor eradication. In vitro studies demonstrated that this may have reflected secretion of lymphokines that activated macrophages to lyse the tumor. The results suggest that noncytolytic p97-specific CD4+ T cell clones can be effective in therapy of pulmonary melanoma metastases. Moreover, if human T cells reactive with the p97 protein could be generated, the expression of this tumor-associated Ag in melanoma cells might be adequate for such T cells to mediate a therapeutic antitumor response. 
Facial nerve regeneration through autologous nerve grafts: a clinical and experimental study. Human facial nerve regeneration was compared in two systems: autologous neural cable grafts (N = 56) and direct end-to-end anastomosis (N = 34). The data were analyzed based on the following criteria: facial symmetry and muscle tone at rest, degree of total facial reinnervation, voluntary motion, synkinesis, and electrophysiologic testing. Facial tone and symmetry at rest, and electrophysiologic tests were similar, while voluntary motion and facial reinnervation were decreased and synkinesis increased in the autologous cable graft repairs. Electrophysiologic tests failed to distinguish between the two repair methods in successful regenerates. Neural cable grafts were associated with more mass movement and less fine precise emotive facial movement. Excellent cable graft repair results diminish with time because of continual progressive synkinesis, which may take up to 4 years to develop. Eight-millimeter neural cable graft repairs of the buccal division of the facial nerve in rabbits (N = 8) demonstrate, at 5 weeks, equal myelinated and more unmyelinated axons than in the normal nerve controls. Neural cable graft repairs demonstrate two features not found in the normal nerve: 1. myelin debris and 2. two subpopulations of axons--extrafascicular and intrafascicular. Myelin debris predisposes towards extrafascicular axon regeneration. Extrafascicular axons are the major neurite regenerates (63%). Intrafascicular axons are the major reinnervators of the distal transected nerve stump. Electrophysiologic studies demonstrate decreased conduction velocities which are related to the number and size of myelinated axonal regenerates. The implications for neurite reinnervation of the autologous cable graft and their role in synkinesis are discussed. 
Morbidity and vaginal tubal cautery: a report and review. Vaginal tubal sterilization was once the procedure of choice for interval sterilization. This technique fell out of favor in part because of a perceived increase in morbidity over the evolving laparoscopic techniques. Complications should be minimized by the advent of routine antibiotic prophylaxis and improved operating techniques that allow shorter procedure times. We retrospectively reviewed 240 vaginal tubal sterilization procedures performed by a single physician. Long-term follow-up (more than 5 years) was available in over half the study group (52%). Half of all operations were completed in 12 minutes or less, with an average time of 14.5 minutes. The planned vaginal procedure was completed in all but two cases, both of which required laparotomy secondary to dense adhesions. Median estimated blood loss was 20 mL. No postoperative infection was encountered. These data suggest that vaginal tubal sterilization may still be a safe alternative for interval sterilization. 
Development of cirrhosis after chronic type B hepatitis: a clinicopathologic and follow-up study of 46 HBeAg-positive asymptomatic patients. The rate of HBeAg clearance and the outcome were analyzed in 46 patients with asymptomatic chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection whose condition was followed for 1-4 yr (mean 2.4). Mean age was 32.5 yr (range 10-68), and 28 (61%) were males. All had chronic hepatitis, on biopsy, and were positive for HBcAg on hepatocytes. Alcoholics, homosexuals, drug abusers, immunocompromised patients, and those with advanced liver disease were excluded. During the follow-up, 25 patients (54%) cleared HBeAg and became seronegative for HBV-DNAp. The estimated annual rate of seroconversion was 26%. One patient cleared HBsAg. After seroconversion, 18 patients had no evidence of ongoing liver disease, proved by biopsy in eight and by clinical follow-up in 10 that refused biopsy. A second liver biopsy was available in 15 patients, and HBcAg was negative in all; histology was normal in eight, unchanged in one, and compatible with cirrhosis in six. All six had clinical and/or biochemical evidence of advanced liver disease. These were significantly older at the start of the study, and had chronic active hepatitis with bridging necrosis on initial biopsy. Early identification of patients with silent chronic HBV infection and high levels of viral replication for antiviral therapy could prevent transmission of the infection and stop progression to liver cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. 
Intraoperative colonic lavage and primary anastomosis in nonelective colon resection. In selected individuals requiring emergency colon resection, intraoperative colonic lavage with primary anastomosis represents a safe alternative to staged reconstruction. This procedure achieves excellent mechanical preparation of the colon, facilitates safe anastomosis, and avoids the disadvantages associated with multistaged operations. At our institution, 25 patients requiring urgent segmental resection of the left colon have undergone intraoperative colonic lavage. Primary anastomosis without fecal diversion has been performed in 21 of these patients. Obstruction of the large intestine was the indication for operation in 56 percent of the patients in this series. Ten patients (40 percent) required laparotomy for an acute intra-abdominal inflammatory process. No post-operative deaths have occurred in our series, and no patient has sustained clinically evident anastomotic leakage. A pelvic abscess developed in one patient after sigmoid colectomy for diverticulitis. Three patients required treatment for wound infection. Based on our results, we recommend resection with intraoperative colonic lavage and primary anastomosis as the preferred treatment for the majority of patients requiring nonelective segmental left colon resection. 
Role of endogenous endothelin in the development of hypertension in rats. To further elucidate the pathophysiologic role of endogenous endothelin (ET), we have studied the chronic effect of anti-ET gamma-globulin on the development of hypertension in spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) and stroke prone SHR (SHR-SP) for three weeks. In neither SHR nor SHR-SP did repetitive bolus injection of anti-ET gamma-globulin suppress the rise in blood pressure. The present data suggest that endogenous ET is not likely to play a key role in the development of hypertension, although ET may induce a local vasoconstriction at the injured vascular wall. 
Local toxicity with subcutaneous methadone. Experience of two centers. We report on 8 patients treated with subcutaneous methadone for cancer-related pain at 2 institutions. The success of other subcutaneous agents for pain control has been well demonstrated. It was felt that methadone would be useful due to its low cost. Unfortunately, 7 of the 8 patients experienced adverse reactions at the subcutaneous sites requiring cessation of subcutaneous methadone. 
Potassium accumulation in the globally ischemic mammalian heart. A role for the ATP-sensitive potassium channel. We investigated the contribution of opening of the ATP-sensitive K+ channel to extracellular accumulation of K+ during ischemia with the use of glibenclamide, a specific blocker of this K+ channel. To characterize the electrophysiological effects of glibenclamide during metabolic inhibition (by either application of dinitrophenol or hypoxia) we performed patch-clamp studies in isolated membrane patches of guinea pig myocytes and in intact guinea pig myocytes and studied action potential parameters in isolated superfused guinea pig papillary muscle. We studied the effect of glibenclamide on extracellular accumulation of K+ and H+ in isolated retrogradely perfused globally ischemic hearts of rat, guinea pig, and rabbit. Experimental evidence is presented that supports the conclusions that glibenclamide 1) effectively blocks open K+ATP channels, 2) reverses the dinitrophenol-induced increase of the outward current and prevents the hypoxia-induced shortening of the action potential, 3) decreases the rate of K+ accumulation during the first minutes of ischemia in stimulated hearts, an effect which was entirely absent in quiescent hearts, and 4) does not influence the rate and extent of ischemia-induced extracellular acidification. 
Intracortical osteosarcoma. A case report. Intracortical osteosarcoma (IO) is the rarest form of osteosarcoma. A 19-year-old man had one of these lesions in the upper diaphysis of the femur. Microscopically, IO was a well-differentiated osteosarcoma with an osteoblastic histologic pattern. The typical location in the diaphysis and the peculiar histologic and roentgenographic findings with intracortical origin clearly separate this entity from conventional osteosarcomas as well as periosteal and parosteal osteosarcomas. IO are lytic neoplasms confined to the cortex of the diaphysis with a benign roentgenographic appearance, but are included in the differential diagnosis of benign tumors. 
Surveillance alone versus radiotherapy after orchiectomy for clinical stage I nonseminomatous testicular cancer. Danish Testicular Cancer Study Group. From December 1980 to January 1984, all patients with stage I nonseminomatous testicular cancer in Denmark entered a randomized trial comparing surveillance only with radiotherapy after orchiectomy. One hundred fifty patients were assessable for the final analysis. Relapse occurred in 23 patients in the surveillance group and in 11 patients in the radiotherapy group. Radiotherapy completely prevented retroperitoneal relapse; 14 retroperitoneal relapses occurred in the surveillance-only group. All relapsing patients in the surveillance-only group are without evidence of disease with a median observation time after chemotherapy of 67 months. Two of the patients with relapse in the radiotherapy group died with disease; the others are alive without evidence of disease, with a median observation time after relapse treatment of 72 months. In the surveillance group, four relapses occurred later than 2 years after orchiectomy; only one such late relapse occurred in the radiotherapy group. Four of the retroperitoneal relapses occurred without concomitant increase in the serum marker levels (alpha-fetoprotein [AFP] and human chorionic gonadotropin [HCG]). It is concluded that surveillance only should replace radiotherapy after orchiectomy as standard treatment for clinical stage I nonseminomatous testicular cancer. Improved methods for control of retroperitoneal relapses, especially of embryonal carcinomas, are needed. 
Export of intracellular HBsAg in chronic hepatitis B virus infection is related to viral replication. Serum and liver HBsAg bear an inverse relation to each other during the evolution of chronic hepatitis B virus infection and the quantity of HBsAg in tissue rises gradually with time. In this study, intracellular and extracellular levels of HBsAg were measured by radioimmunoassay in primary culture of hepatocytes from 30 patients with chronic hepatitis B virus infection to determine a possible relationship with hepatitis B virus replication. Serum levels of HBsAg correlated with markers of active viral replication (serum hepatitis B virus DNA, p less than 0.005, and tissue HBcAg, p less than 0.02) but inversely with tissue HBsAg (p less than 0.05). In similar fashion, in vitro export of HBsAg was also related to the presence of active viral replication markers (serum hepatitis B virus DNA, p less than 0.02, and tissue HBcAg, p less than 0.05) and negatively with tissue HBsAg (p less than 0.001). Export of HBeAg also correlated positively with markers of active viral replication (serum hepatitis B virus DNA, p less than 0.05 and tissue HBcAg, p less than 0.05). Further experiments indicated that intrahepatic pre-S1 and pre-S2 correlated closely with intrahepatic HBsAg, indicating that a failure to export HBsAg was unlikely to be attributable to deficient intracellular expression of pre-S1 or pre-S2. These data indicate that in vitro primary hepatocyte culture of hepatitis B virus-infected cells provides an accurate reflection of in vivo export of HBsAg and that this is closely related to the presence of active viral replication. 
Practical considerations in treating the elderly hypertensive patient. More than half of all older Americans die of cardiovascular diseases. Hypertension is a major risk factor for cardiovascular diseases, and its prevalence increases with age. Older patients are both at higher risk for end-organ complications and less likely than younger ones to survive such complications as myocardial infarction and stroke. Clinical studies have shown that reduction of elevated blood pressure is beneficial in many older persons. Optimal selection of antihypertensive therapy requires consideration of the special characteristics of the elderly, who differ from their younger counterparts in physiology, response to therapy and frequency of concomitant illnesses and medications. Calcium antagonists are particularly effective in these patients; other agents are useful in selected situations. Drugs that are likely to cause central nervous system side effects or orthostatic hypotension generally should be avoided in this patient population. Therapy should begin with a low dose and be titrated upward slowly, thus avoiding excessive reduction of blood pressure and the development of orthostatic hypotension. Treatment should be altered as necessary to minimize side effects that may impair quality of life or lead to poor compliance. 
Efficacy of dorsal longitudinal myelotomy in treating spinal spasticity: a review of 20 cases. The authors report their experience using dorsal longitudinal myelotomy in treating spasticity in 20 patients with complete spinal cord injuries. These patients suffered from severe painful flexor/extensor spasms that prevented them from wheelchair ambulation and/or their decubitus ulcers healing. All were receiving large doses of various oral drugs, including baclofen, which had failed to control their spasticity, and all underwent a modification of a posterior T-myelotomy as first described by Bischof. All 20 patients enjoyed immediate complete relief of their painful spasms, although two (10%) eventually experienced return of their spasms and are thus classified as long-term failures. Seventeen patients succeeded in markedly reducing, or being completely weaned from, their antispasmodic medications. In 11 of 14 patients, nonhealing decubitus ulcers subsequently healed with treatment. Bladder function was unchanged from the preoperative status in all patients. Chronic intrathecal baclofen infusion has recently been reported as an effective treatment of the spasticity of paraplegia. The results of this study, along with previous reports advocating dorsal longitudinal myelotomy, suggest that this approach is an efficacious alternative to chronic baclofen infusion in reducing spasticity for complete paraplegics. Considering the cost of the infusion pump, along with the fact that chronic intrathecal baclofen therapy necessitates long-term medical supervision, it appears that myelotomy is superior for this select group of patients who have no hope of regaining voluntary motor function. 
Effect of Helicobacter pylori infection on the severity of gastroduodenal mucosal injury after the acute administration of naproxen or aspirin to normal volunteers. This study asked whether Helicobactor pylori infection accentuated the severity of NSAID-induced mucosal injury of the stomach or duodenum. We evaluated the severity of acute mucosal injury and H. pylori status in 61 normal volunteers (ages 22-43 yr) receiving naproxen (1000 mg, n = 30) or aspirin (3900 mg, n = 31) daily for 7 days. NSAID-induced gastric and duodenal mucosa each were endoscopically graded separately for hemorrhages and erosions-ulcers on a scale of 0 to 4. H. pylori infection was identified by a sensitive and specific ELISA. Nine of the 30 subjects in the naproxen group and 12 of the 31 subjects in the aspirin group were H. pylori positive (p = NS). There was no statistically significant difference between the frequency of mucosal hemorrhage in those with and those without H. pylori infection (44% compared with 33% for those receiving naproxen and 90% of those receiving ASA, p = NS for each). There were also no differences in the frequency or severity of erosive mucosal injury seen, e.g., acute ulcers were found in 16.5% and 17.5% of infected and uninfected subjects, respectively. We conclude that the presence of H. pylori infection does not influence the degree or type of mucosal damage associated with the acute administration of naproxen or aspirin. 
Evidence for reduced fibrinolytic activity in unstable angina at rest. Clinical, biochemical, and angiographic correlates. BACKGROUND. The goal of this study was to evaluate the role of the fibrinolytic system in patients with unstable angina at rest associated with transient electrocardiographic changes. METHODS AND RESULTS. Tissue plasminogen activator activity in plasma was comparable among patients with unstable angina (n = 17), patients with stable exertional angina (n = 10), and control patients with normal coronary arteriograms (n = 8). In contrast, plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1) activity in plasma was elevated in the unstable angina group (21.67 +/- 9.52 AU/ml) as compared with either the stable angina group (12.01 +/- 7.06 AU/ml, p less than 0.02) or the controls (12.49 +/- 8.54 AU/ml, p less than 0.02). Coronary angiography performed within 24 hours after the last anginal episode showed a similar extent of coronary artery disease in the unstable and stable angina groups. However, intracoronary thrombi were observed in eight patients in the unstable angina group while no thrombus was noted in the stable angina group (chi 2 = 7.22, p less than 0.01). CONCLUSIONS. We conclude that patients with unstable angina at rest have a reduced fibrinolytic activity and an increased incidence of intracoronary thrombi. It is postulated that elevated PAI-1 activity in the presence of coronary arterial wall injury may be an important factor leading to the development of acute coronary syndromes. 
Results of multimodal therapy in Ewing's sarcoma: a retrospective analysis of 20 patients. A retrospective analysis was performed of 20 patients with Ewing's sarcoma treated by combined modality therapy, consisting of surgery, radiotherapy, and chemotherapy. Fourteen patients (70%) achieved complete remission and 5 patients (25%) were in partial remission at the end of treatment. One patient (5%) failed to respond to combined modality therapy. The overall 5 year actuarial survival was 64% and the disease free survival, 55%. Persistent or recurrent disease occurred in 8 patients (40%); one of them was salvaged by surgery and chemotherapy. Site and extent of primary lesion were prognosticators of patients' outcome. One patient developed radiation-related-sequelae. The efficacy of aggressive management consisting of wide surgery, radiotherapy and intermittent high dose chemotherapy is discussed. 
In vitro activity of sparfloxacin (CI-978; AT-4140) against clinical isolates from cancer patients. The in vitro activity of sparfloxacin, a new quinolone, was compared with those of ciprofloxacin and fleroxacin against gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria, greater than 90% of which were isolated from blood culture specimens of cancer patients. Sparfloxacin was extremely active against Acinetobacter species, Aeromonas hydrophila, Citrobacter diversus, Enterobacter species, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella species, Proteus vulgaris, and Serratia marcescens (inhibiting greater than 90% of these isolates at a concentration of 0.5 microgram/ml) and moderately active against Pseudomonas species, other Proteus species, and Citrobacter freundii. Sparfloxacin inhibited greater than 90% of staphylococci (including methicillin-resistant and coagulase-negative strains) at a concentration of 0.12 microgram/ml and greater than 90% of streptococci (including Streptococcus pneumoniae) at a concentration of 1.0 microgram/ml. It was also active against Bacillus cereus, Enterococcus species, and Corynebacterium jeikeium, organisms that have become fairly common in cancer patients. 
Femoropopliteal arterial occlusions: laser-assisted versus conventional percutaneous transluminal angioplasty. Recanalization of 75 femoropopliteal arterial occlusions was attempted with either conventional percutaneous transluminal angioplasty (n = 28; mean occlusion length, 5.5 cm) or percutaneous laser-assisted angioplasty (PLA) (n = 47; mean occlusion length, 11.6 cm). Conventional recanalization was technically successful in 21 patients (mean occlusion length, 4.4 cm +/- 3.9) and was a technical failure in seven (mean occlusion length, 8.7 cm +/- 6.2). The technical outcome was a function of the length of the occlusion (P = .04). The PLA procedure, performed with a laser with a sapphire probe, was a technical success in 32 patients (mean length, 10.7 cm +/- 6.5) and a technical failure in 15 (mean length, 13.6 cm +/- 8.2). With PLA, the length of the occlusion did not determine the technical (P = .20) or clinical (P = .12) outcome. In patients with gangrene, PLA of occlusions longer than 5 cm failed clinically (P = .02). This PLA method appeared to be safe and allowed passage through occlusions longer than 10 cm. 
Mixed acid fermentation of glucose as a mechanism of emphysematous urinary tract infection. Emphysematous pyelonephritis is a severe necrotizing infection that usually occurs in patients with diabetes mellitus or obstructive uropathy. Although glucose fermentation has been considered as the main cause of gas production the actual mechanism remains controversial. Compositions of gas samples from 2 patients with emphysematous pyelonephritis recently encountered were analyzed, and showed 15% hydrogen, 4.8% carbon dioxide, 60% nitrogen, 6.7% oxygen and some unknown gases in case 1, and 3.4% hydrogen, 22% carbon dioxide, 66% nitrogen and 9.8% oxygen in case 2. These results tend to implicate mixed acid fermentation of glucose as the pathway by which emphysematous urinary tract infections develop. 
Carboplatin, doxorubicin, and cyclophosphamide versus cisplatin, doxorubicin, and cyclophosphamide: a randomized trial in stage III-IV epithelial ovarian carcinoma. One hundred sixty-four patients with stage III-IV epithelial ovarian carcinoma were randomized to receive cisplatin (CDDP) 50 mg/mq, doxorubicin 45 mg/mq, and cyclophosphamide 600 mg/mq (PAC) or carboplatin 200 mg/mq, doxorubicin 45 mg/m2, and cyclophosphamide 600 mg/mq (CAC). To administer equitoxic doses at each cycle, the drug dosages were adjusted according to the hematologic toxicities experienced after the previous course; 44.7% of CAC and 21.1% of PAC patients required a dosage reduction at the second course (P = .002). Neither CAC nor PAC caused any clinically relevant neuro-nephrotoxicity; however, CDDP was administered with hydration and forced diuresis, while carboplatin was administered by rapid intravenous (IV) infusion. After six cycles, response rates were superimposable: 62.5% and 66.6% for CAC and PAC, respectively; pathologic complete responses (pCRs) were 16.7% for CAC and 23.2% for PAC; among patients with more than 2 cm residual disease, PAC induced more pCRs than CAC (eight of 52 or 15.4% v one of 42 or 2.4%, P = .07). Median survivals and progression-free survivals (PFSs) were 22.6 and 13.2 months for PAC, and 23.1 and 15.5 months for CAC, respectively; these differences are not significant. In conclusion, this trial demonstrates that equitoxic doses of PAC or CAC result in a similar response rate, PFS, and survival. 
Marshall-Smith syndrome: new radiographic, clinical, and pathologic observations. Radiographic, clinical, and histologic findings in two infants and a neonate with a syndrome of profoundly accelerated skeletal maturation included features closely resembling those of Marshall-Smith (MS) syndrome, but patients had dysmorphic ears as well as distinctive generalized skeletal abnormalities suggestive of a bone dysplasia. Among these was an instability at the craniocervical junction with severe spinal stenosis. These previously unrecognized abnormalities may represent uncommon manifestations within the spectrum of MS syndrome or indicate the existence of a separate disorder. 
Patient and technique survival among an urban population of peritoneal dialysis patients: an 8-year experience. Estimates of patient and technique survival are given for 146 peritoneal dialysis (PD) patients who underwent dialysis between January 1, 1981 through December 31, 1989. In all, 33 patients died and 44 patients changed treatment. Patient survival was 92% at 1 year, 80% at 2 years, and 55% at 4 years, while technique survival was 85% at 1 year, 74% at 2 years, and 47% at 4 years. Cox's proportional hazards regression model was used to assess the effects of sex, age, diabetes, cardiovascular disease (CVD), education, and training time on both patient and technique survival. Both patient age (P = 0.001) and CVD (P = 0.03) had a significant impact on patient survival. On the average, for every 10 years' increase in age, the risk of death increased by a factor of 1.71. Patients with CVD had a risk of death 2.57 times higher than the risk of death among patients without CVD. With respect to technique or method survival, black patients had a risk of changing treatment 2.24 times higher than that for white patients. Our patient and technique survivals are similar to that reported in the national CAPD registry over a comparable period (1981 to 1988). 
Postoperative analgesia after triple nerve block for fractured neck of femur Fifty patients with fractured neck of femur that required surgical correction with either a compression screw or pin and plate device were randomly allocated to receive one of two anaesthetic techniques, general anaesthesia combined with either opioid supplementation or triple nerve block (three in one block) with subcostal nerve block. The nerve blocks significantly reduced the quantity of opioid administered after operation; 48% of these patients required no additional analgesia in the first 24 hours. Plasma prilocaine levels in these patients were well below the toxic threshold, and peak absorption occurred 20 minutes after the injection. No untoward sequelae were associated with the nerve blocks. 
Limitations of faecal chymotrypsin as a screening test for chronic pancreatitis. Faecal chymotrypsin was measured in patients with chronic pancreatitis and in healthy black urban and rural control subjects. In the patients, significantly lower values of faecal chymotrypsin were obtained (mean (SD) 2.4 1.79 U/g stool) whereas in urban control subjects, values were within the normal range (mean (SD) 13.2 (11.9)). In rural black control subjects, however, the faecal chymotrypsin value was significantly lower (mean (SD) 7.1 (5.1)) than in urban black control subjects. It is suggested that faecal pH may influence faecal chymotrypsin values. The mean faecal pH in rural black subjects (pH 6.14) was significantly lower than that in urban control subjects (pH 6.77) and in patients with chronic pancreatitis (pH 6.61). Moreover, mean faecal chymotrypsin is high (20.0 U/g stool) at a pH greater than 7. Between pH 6 and 7 the mean value drops to 8.6 U/g stool and below pH 6 mean faecal chymotrypsin is in the abnormal range (4.4 U/g stool). Hence, low values for faecal chymotrypsin may be due to lower faecal pH (less than 6) in healthy control subjects. For diagnostic purposes, the faecal pH value should be determined if a low faecal chymotrypsin value is obtained. 
The time course of acute psychiatric episodes in systemic lupus erythematosus. Acute psychotic manifestations in systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) have been considered usually to occur early in the course of illness, although these findings are primarily based on studies with few patients and limited lengths of observation. To further investigate the chronology of acute psychiatric disturbances in SLE, the time course of these episodes was examined in 36 patients over a median duration of observation of 72 months. Twenty-two of 36 (61.1%) initial psychiatric episodes occurred within the first year of diagnosis of SLE, although several patients experienced the initial onset of psychiatric manifestations several years after the onset of SLE. Recurrent episodes occurred in 10 of 36 patients at a median of 8 months after the initial episode. Although tending to occur early in SLE, primary acute psychiatric events may first occur in patients with long durations of illness, and the time of onset of these episodes does not appear helpful in their differential diagnosis. 
Fetal choroid plexus cysts in the second trimester of pregnancy: a cause for concern. Controversy surrounds the issue of recommending cytogenetic studies in second-trimester fetuses with fetal choroid plexus cysts. To assist in clarifying this issue, a prospective study was designed to describe the association between fetal choroid plexus cysts and aneuploidy in a large population. During a 3-year period 7350 women at 15 to 22 weeks' gestation underwent an ultrasonographic evaluation. Fetal choroid plexus cysts were diagnosed in 71 (0.96%) of these pregnancies. Sixty-two of the 71 patients elected to undergo amniocentesis. An abnormal karyotype was identified in four (6.4%) of these fetuses. One fetus had trisomy 21, and three fetuses were diagnosed with trisomy 18. These data indicate that it is reasonable to offer genetic counseling and cytogenetic studies in those patients identified as having a fetal choroid plexus cyst. 
Leukaemia of novel gastrointestinal T-lymphocyte population infected with HTLV-I In a 72-year-old man with watery diarrhoea and leukocytosis the proliferation of abnormal cells was studied in specimens obtained by endoscopic biopsy of the gastrointestinal tract. Flow cytometry of leukaemia cells revealed a monoclonal expansion of "double-negative" (CD4-, CD8-) cells bearing T-cell receptor (TCR) alpha beta products. Southern blotting confirmed monoclonal integration of HTLV-I. A novel T-cell subset of double-negative TCR alpha beta cells in the gastrointestinal tract in adult man may be a target for HTLV-I infection. 
Symptomatic subependymoma: a clinicopathological and flow cytometric study. Twenty-one intracranial subependymomas were reviewed with regard to presentation, diagnosis, operative findings, and long-term follow-up data. The histopathological features were critically reviewed, and deoxyribunucleic acid analysis was performed by flow cytometry. The patients' mean age was 48.5 years (range 32 to 72 years). In 14 cases the tumor was located in the fourth ventricle, in six within a lateral ventricle, and in one in the third ventricle with extension into the lateral ventricle. Radiographic characteristics included isodensity with minimal enhancement on computerized tomography, frequent dystrophic calcification, and isointensity on T1-weighted or slight hyperintensity on T2-weighted magnetic resonance images. The predominant histological features in all cases were those of classic subependymoma. Nonetheless, pathological examination showed a minor (less than 20%) ependymoma component in five cases, significant cytological atypia in seven, mitoses in 11, endothelial prominence in four, and focal hemorrhage-associated necrosis in two. Flow cytometry revealed a diploid pattern in 12 patients, tetraploidy in two, and aneuploidy in one. Two patients died in the perioperative period. Of the remaining 19, 12 underwent gross total resection (two of whom received postoperative irradiation) and seven underwent subtotal resection (five of whom received irradiation). None of the 12 non-irradiated patients developed tumor progression or died of direct tumor-related causes. Of the seven irradiated patients, follow-up imaging studies demonstrated their tumors to be radioresponsive, particularly with doses of 5000 cGy or greater. Despite the presence of cytological atypia and mitotic activity in the majority of cases, the prognostic effects of such factors as tumor location and the extent of surgical resection outweighed those of the standard histopathological parameters. Routine postoperative irradiation is not recommended, but should be reserved for cases with a symptomatic residual or recurrent subependymomas following surgery. 
Effects of fibrin sealant on tubal anastomosis and adhesion formation. The results of the present study suggest that there is no difference in adhesion formation and PR after tubal anastomosis using sutures or fibrin sealant. It appears that the use of fibrin sealant is associated with decreased incidence of ectopic pregnancy. 
Effect of positive end-expiratory pressure on intra-abdominal pressure. Massive elevation of intra-abdominal pressure (IAP) causes renal, cardiovascular, and respiratory dysfunction. Positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) markedly increases the detrimental effect of IAP on the cardiovascular system. The purpose of this study was to determine the effect of PEEP on IAP. In 15 patients requiring mechanical ventilation, IAP was measured, after 15-minute equilibration intervals, at PEEP levels of 0, 5, 10, and 15 cm H2O. Parametric analysis with multiple paired t tests and nonparametric analysis with Spearman's rho and Kendall's tau tests were used to determine correlation between PEEP and IAP. All patients were male. The mean age was 39 years (range, 18-77). Ten patients had just had laparotomy. No correlation was found between PEEP and IAP. We conclude that PEEP of 15 cm H2O or less has no effect on IAP, and we discuss the clinical implications. 
Differing activities of medullary respiratory neurons in eupnea and gasping. Our purpose was to compare further eupneic ventilatory activity with that of gasping. Decerebrate, paralyzed, and ventilated cats were used; the vagi were sectioned within the thorax caudal to the laryngeal branches. Activities of the phrenic nerve and medullary respiratory neurons were recorded. Antidromic invasion was used to define bulbospinal, laryngeal, or not antidromically activated units. The ventilatory pattern was reversibly altered to gasping by exposure to 1% carbon monoxide in air. In eupnea, activities of inspiratory neurons commenced at various times during inspiration, and for most the discharge frequency gradually increased. In gasping, the peak discharge frequency of inspiratory neurons was unaltered. However, all commenced activities at the start of the phrenic burst and reached peak discharge almost immediately. The discharge frequencies of all groups of expiratory neurons fell in gasping, with many neurons ceasing activity entirely. These data are consistent with the hypothesis that brain stem mechanisms controlling eupnea and gasping differ fundamentally. 
Fistula-in-ano in Crohn's disease. Results of aggressive surgical treatment. The outcome of aggressive surgical treatment of 64 symptomatic anal fistulas in 55 patients with Crohn's disease has been studied. Forty-one fistulas, in 33 patients, were treated by conventional fistulotomy (17 subcutaneous, 19 intersphincteric, 5 low transsphincteric fistulas). Thirty wounds (73 percent) healed within 3 months and eight more wounds (93 percent) healed within 6 months. Three wounds did not heal within 12-18 months. Two of these patients subsequently required proctocolectomy. Wound healing was not influenced by the presence of rectal Crohn's disease or granulomatous inflammation in the tract. No change in continence was experienced by 26 of the 33 patients who underwent fistulotomy. Three patients required proctocolectomy and the remaining four patients experienced minor degrees of incontinence postoperatively. Sixteen high transsphincteric, five suprasphincteric, and one extrasphincteric fistula in 22 patients were treated by laying open external tracts and placing a noncutting seton through the sphincter, which was left in place for prolonged periods to maintain drainage. During follow-up (6 months to 10 years, median 2.5 years), three fistulas healed and seven remained quiescent. Nine patients required further treatment by a new seton and three patients required proctocolectomy. Eight of the 22 patients who had a seton inserted had no change in continence, and six patients in this group developed minor changes in continence, mostly related to diarrhea associated with intestinal disease. Anal fistulas in Crohn's disease, which involve minimal sphincter muscle, can be successfully treated by fistulotomy. High fistulas should be treated with seton drainage to limit recurrent suppuration and preserve sphincter function. 
Long-term visual function in acute posterior multifocal placoid pigment epitheliopathy. Acute posterior multifocal placoid pigment epithellopathy is a chorioretinal inflammatory disease occurring in young, healthy adults. The long-term visual prognosis and recurrence rate is uncertain. We reexamined 28 patients (53 affected eyes) with acute posterior multifocal placoid pigment epitheliopathy (mean follow-up, 8 years) to obtain details on the long-term functional visual outcome. The final visual acuities were 20/25 or better in 48 eyes (90.6%), 20/30 to 20/100 in four eyes (7.5%), and 20/200 in one eye (1.9%). Although the final visual acuity was good, 33 eyes (62.3%) were symptomatic with blurred vision, metamorphopsia, or scotomas. Thirty-six eyes (67.9%) had significant central visual field defects on follow-up examination. There were no recurrences after the initial month of symptoms. The chorioretinal scars did not enlarge with time. Acute posterior multifocal placoid pigment epitheliopathy has a good longterm prognosis for visual acuity, although most patients have residual symptoms and paracentral scotomas. 
Cytokine biology. Implications for transfusion medicine. The development and widespread availability of recombinant products will effect blood centers through reduced product use, replacement of current products, and novel applications of new products. The greatest amount of clinical experience to date has dealt with the use of recombinant human erythropoietin (r-HuEPO) in the treatment of anemia in end-stage renal failure. Data also support its use in anemia associated with acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS), cancer, and chronic inflammatory diseases. This article will focus on the effect of erythropoietin on the demand for erythrocyte use. 
A multicenter, controlled trial of ursodiol for the treatment of primary biliary cirrhosis. UDCA-PBC Study Group. BACKGROUND. In primary biliary cirrhosis the hepatic lesions may result, at least in part, from the intracellular accumulation of potentially toxic endogenous bile acids. Preliminary work suggests that the administration of ursodiol (also called ursodeoxycholic acid), a hydrophilic bile acid without hepatotoxicity, leads to improvement in the condition of patients with primary biliary cirrhosis. METHODS. We conducted a two-year, multicenter, double-blind trial to compare the efficacy of ursodiol with that of placebo. Patients with biopsy-proved primary biliary cirrhosis were randomly assigned to receive either ursodiol (13 to 15 mg per kilogram of body weight per day) (n = 73) or placebo (n = 73). Treatment failure was defined as a doubling of bilirubin levels to more than 70 mumol per liter or the occurrence of a severe complication (ascites or variceal bleeding) or an adverse reaction. RESULTS. Treatment failed in 6 patients in the ursodiol group, as compared with 13 in the placebo group (P less than 0.01 by Cox regression model). A single patient in each group withdrew because of minor adverse effects. After two years of treatment, the proportion of patients with clinically overt disease decreased only in the ursodiol group (P less than 0.02). The patients treated with ursodiol had significant improvements in serum levels of bilirubin, alkaline phosphatase, alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase, gamma-glutamyltransferase, cholesterol, and IgM (all P less than 0.001); the antimitochondrial-antibody titer (P less than 0.01); and the Mayo risk score (P less than 0.001). Follow-up analysis of 95 liver-biopsy specimens showed a significant improvement in the mean histologic score (P less than 0.002) and in all the characteristic histologic features except fibrosis only in the group given ursodiol. CONCLUSIONS. Ursodiol is a safe and effective treatment for primary biliary cirrhosis. 
Diuretics after transurethral prostatectomy: a double-blind controlled trial comparing frusemide and mannitol. Mannitol and frusemide were compared in a randomized, controlled, double-blind trial for their effects in promoting diuresis after prostatectomy and on indices of water intoxication. The drugs had comparable diuretic effects. Sodium loss was greater with frusemide, contributing to sodium depletion after operation. Administration of frusemide was associated with more frequent need for i.v. volume expansion after operation. Plasma osmolality was greater with mannitol (289 (SD 4.2 mosmol kg-1 at 1 h after operation and 285 (5.3) mosmol kg-1 at 4 h after operation) than with frusemide (282 (7.1) mosmol kg-1 and 279 (6.7) mosmol kg-1, respectively) (P less than 0.05). Plasma concentration of sodium was significantly greater with mannitol (136.9 (3.1) mmol litre-1) than with frusemide (134.4 (2.8) mmol litre-1) only on the morning after surgery (P less than 0.05). Mannitol is an effective alternative to frusemide in inducing diuresis after prostatectomy, and may protect against water intoxication. 
Altretamine. Altretamine is a National Cancer Institute-designated group C antineoplastic agent used in the treatment of advanced ovarian cancer. Altretamine is a highly lipid-soluble drug available only for oral administration as a capsule. The drug is activated through metabolic oxidation to intermediate methylol derivatives and formaldehyde. It is unclear which metabolite is the major species responsible for cytotoxicity or the primary mechanism of cytotoxicity. As a single agent in the treatment of ovarian cancer, altretamine demonstrates a response rate similar to other active agents in this disease (21-39 percent). The major utility of altretamine is in combination with other agents such as cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, fluorouracil, melphalan, and cisplatin. However, few randomized trials have evaluated the contribution of altretamine in these multiagent combinations. Dose-limiting toxicities include gastrointestinal (nausea, vomiting, anorexia), hematologic, and neurotoxic (peripheral neurotoxicity). The therapeutic role of altretamine is limited because of a toxicity profile similar to that of cisplatin, one of the more active agents in ovarian cancer. Its use should be reserved for patients who are not candidates for more standard platinum-based regimens. 
Detection of DNA sequence polymorphisms by enzymatic amplification and direct genomic sequencing. The discovery of RFLPs and their utilization as genetic markers has revolutionized research in human molecular genetics. However, only a fraction of the DNA sequence polymorphisms in the human genome affect the length of a restriction fragment and hence result in an RFLP. Polymorphisms that are not detected as RFLPs are typically passed over in the screening process though they represent a potentially important source of informative genetic markers. We have used a rapid method for the detection of naturally occurring DNA sequence variations that is based on enzymatic amplification and direct sequencing of genomic DNA. This approach can detect essentially all useful sequence variations within the region screened. We demonstrate the feasibility of the technique by applying it to the human retinoblastoma susceptibility locus. We screened 3,712 bp of genomic DNA from each of nine individuals and found four DNA sequence polymorphisms. At least one of these DNA sequence polymorphisms was informative in each of three families with hereditary retinoblastoma that were not informative with any of the known RFLPs at this locus. We believe that direct sequencing is a reasonable alternative to other methods of screening for DNA sequence polymorphisms and that it represents a step forward for obtaining informative markers at well-characterized loci that have been minimally informative in the past. 
Prevention of thromboembolic disease following total knee arthroplasty. Epidural versus general anesthesia. Seventy-two patients were randomized into a prospective clinical trial to evaluate the effects of epidural (EA) versus general anesthesia (GA) on the incidence of thromboembolic disease (TED) following total knee arthroplasty (TKA). Males received aspirin 650 mg po bid and females low-dose warfarin daily to maintain the prothrombin time at 15 to 16 seconds for pharmacologic prophylaxis against TED. Thirty-four patients had EA and 38 GA for their primary TKA. Contrast venography and ventilation-perfusion scanning were performed on the sixth, seventh, and eighth postoperative days, and these were interpreted in a blinded fashion. The mean age of the 45 males and 27 females was 64 years (range, 42-84 years). There were no significant differences between the two groups with respect to hematocrit, operative time, blood loss, number of units transfused, or hospital stay. Twelve of the 34 patients (35%) receiving an EA and 10 of the 38 patients (26%) receiving GA developed TED, an overall incidence of 31% (p greater than 0.05) Fifty-three percent of the clots were located in the popliteal vein above the trifurcation or more proximal. However, the incidence of proximal vein thrombosis was significantly less in patients receiving an EA (46%) rather than a GA (64%). The incidence and distribution of clots was not affected by the type of pharmacologic prophylaxis, gender, or use of methylmethacrylate. Ten percent of the patients had a positive scan by strict criteria and were thought to have a pulmonary embolism (PE). In patients with a femoral vein clot, the incidence of PE was 67%. One bleeding complication occurred in a patient who took double the appropriate warfarin dose. 
Comparison of the predictive characteristics of heart rate variability index and left ventricular ejection fraction for all-cause mortality, arrhythmic events and sudden death after acute myocardial infarction. Heart rate (HR) variability index and left ventricular ejection fraction (EF) were compared for the prediction of all-cause mortality, arrhythmic events and sudden death in 385 survivors of acute myocardial infarction. For arrhythmic events, where, for a sensitivity of 75%, HR variability index had a specificity of 76%, EF had a specificity of only 45%. An EF of less than or equal to 40% had a sensitivity of 42% and a specificity of 75% for arrhythmic events; for the same sensitivity an HR variability index of 20 U had a specificity of 92%. An EF less than or equal to 40% had a sensitivity of 40% and a specificity of 73% for sudden death; HR variability index had a specificity of 83% for the same sensitivity. For all cause mortality, where, for a sensitivity of 75%, HR variability index had a specificity of 52%, EF had a specificity of 40%. It is concluded that HR variability index appears a better predictor of important postinfarction arrhythmic complications than left ventricular EF, but both indexes perform equally well in predicting all-cause mortality. 
A clinical perspective on common forms of acquired heterotopic ossification. The clinical courses of heterotopic ossification (HO) as a consequence of trauma and central nervous system insults have many similarities as well as dissimilarities. Detection is commonly noted at two months. The incidence of clinically significant HO is 10%-20%. Approximately 10% of the HO is massive and causes severe restriction in joint motion or ankylosis. The most common sign and symptom are decreased range of motion and pain. The locations are the proximal limbs and joints. Sites of HO about a joint may vary according to the etiology of the HO. Roentgenographic evolution of HO occurs during a six-month period in the majority of patients. Treatment modalities include diphosphonates, indomethacin, radiation, range of motion exercises, and surgical excision. Surgical timing differs according to etiology: traumatic HO may be resected at six months; spinal cord injury HO is excised at one year; and traumatic brain injury HO is removed at 1.5 years. A small number of patients have progression of HO with medicinal treatment and recurrence after resection. The patients seem recalcitrant to present treatment methods regardless of the HO etiology. 
Radiation therapy to prevent heterotopic ossification after cementless total hip arthroplasty. Clinical and roentgenographic observations on a postoperative low-dose radiation of 1000 cGy for prevention of heterotopic ossification in high-risk patients after 48 noncemented total hip arthroplasties demonstrated no overall statistical difference in the Harris hip scores between the treated group (92.2) and the control group (91.0). There was no difference in the incidence of radiolucent lines about the components, and there were no revisions for aseptic loosening in the treated group. The incidence of clinically significant (Brooker Grades III and IV) heterotopic bone formation was lower in the treated group (7%) than in the control group (32%). This difference in the incidence of heterotopic bone formation was statistically significant. Radiation therapy was effective in preventing postoperative heterotopic bone formation in biologically fixed total hip implants. 
The atrial natriuretic factor hormonal system in the regulation of sodium excretion in dogs with experimental heart failure. In response to a meat meal containing 125 mEq of sodium, conscious dogs (n = 5) with an arteriovenous (AV) fistula and chronic compensated heart failure exhibited temporally related increases in postprandial plasma immunoreactive atrial natriuretic factor (iANF), right atrial pressure, and sodium excretion. In separate experiments, two weeks of dietary sodium restriction produced similar marked stimulation of renin and aldosterone both in normal dogs (n = 5), and in AV fistula dogs (n = 5) with chronic high circulating levels of ANF. Plasma iANF did not change (P greater than .05) in either group. These results suggest that the ANF system is involved in the postprandial regulation of sodium excretion in the AV fistula dogs with compensated heart failure. In the postabsorptive state, however, the activity of the renin-aldosterone axis is closely related to dietary sodium intake and appears to function independently of the ANF system for the prevention of sodium loss. 
Analysis of auditory comprehension performance in individuals with severe aphasia. This research compared the performance of 20 individuals with global and mixed nonfluent aphasia across the four auditory comprehension subtests of the Boston Diagnostic Aphasia Examination (Word Discrimination, Body Part Identification, Commands, and Complex Ideational Material) and across the six subcomponents of the Word Discrimination Subtest (objects, actions, letters, colors, forms, and numbers). As expected, group means revealed severely reduced performance which was equally observable across all auditory comprehension tasks. To determine whether individual subjects demonstrated a pattern of consistently reduced performance for auditory comprehension tasks, z-scores and chi-square statistics were also calculated for each subject and task. The individuals with global aphasia demonstrated a greater number of statistically significant z-scores than was expected by chance. This was not true for the subjects with mixed nonfluent aphasia. Results of this research indicate that although as a group individuals with global aphasia may demonstrate consistently reduced auditory comprehension, when considered on an individual basis, this group may comprise a somewhat divergent population with respect to the configuration of preserved and impaired auditory comprehension skills. 
Cancer occurrence in a cohort of patients surgically treated for peptic ulcer. A cohort of 4107 patients treated surgically for peptic ulcer between 1955 and 1960 was followed up to determine the incidence of cancer by record linkage to the Danish Cancer Registry. A total of 930 cases of cancer were observed during 76,634 person-years. Relative risks of cancer were computed by comparison with the recorded cancer incidence in the Danish population. During the first five years after surgery the relative risk of gastric cancer was slightly increased (RR = 1.43), but 5-15 years after the operation the risk was lower than expected (RR = 0.55). Thereafter, the relative risk of gastric cancer increased steadily and increased more than twofold after 25 years. Lung cancer occurred more frequently in the cohort members than expected (RR = 1.66), but the relative risk was independent of time since surgery. Malignancies other than gastric cancer and cancers related to tobacco smoking were close to the expected numbers. The results do not support the findings of a recent British study of similar size in which increased risks were reported for cancer at other sites. 
Liver damage caused by therapeutic vitamin A administration: estimate of dose-related toxicity in 41 cases. Clinical presentation, changes in liver function test results, and liver morphology were examined in 41 consecutive patients with vitamin A hepatoxicity. The cause of liver disease was suspected at initial interview in only 13 instances, whereas histological evidence of fat-storing cell hyperplasia with fluorescent vacuoles led to the diagnosis in the remaining cases. Cirrhosis was found in 17, mild chronic hepatitis in 10, noncirrhotic portal hypertension in 5, and "increased storage" alone in 9 cases. During a mean follow-up period of 4.6 years, 6 patients died of causes related to the liver disease. A precise appraisal of drug consumption was obtained in 29 cases. Among them the total cumulative intake was the highest in patients with cirrhosis (423 +/- 103 x 10(6) IU) and significantly lower in those with noncirrhotic liver disease (88.5 +/- 41; P less than 0.02). The smallest continuous daily consumption leading to cirrhosis was 25,000 IU during 6 years, whereas higher daily doses (greater than or equal to 100,000 IU) taken during 21/2 years resulted in similar histological lesions. It was concluded that at least in some western countries chronic vitamin A consumption might represent an appreciable cause of chronic liver disease, the recognition of which mainly relies on expert liver biopsy interpretation. The data also indicate that prolonged and continuous consumption of doses in the low "therapeutic" range can result in life-threatening liver damage. 
Accurate prediction of death by serial determination of galactose elimination capacity in primary biliary cirrhosis: a comparison with the Mayo model. We retrospectively analyzed the predictive accuracy of serial determinations of galactose elimination capacity in 61 patients with primary biliary cirrhosis. Death was predicted from the time that the regression line describing the decline in galactose elimination capacity vs. time intersected a value of 4 mg.min-1.kg-1. Thirty-one patients exhibited decreasing galactose elimination capacity; in 11 patients it remained stable and in 19 patients only one value was available. Among those patients with decreasing galactose elimination capacity, 10 died and three underwent liver transplantation; prediction of death was accurate to 7 +/- 19 mo. This criterion incorrectly predicted death in two patients with portal-vein thrombosis; otherwise, it did better than or as well as the Mayo clinic score. The latter was also tested on our patients and was found to adequately describe risk in yet another independent population of patients with primary biliary cirrhosis. Cox regression analysis selected only bilirubin and galactose elimination capacity, however, as independent predictors of death. We submit that serial determination of galactose elimination capacity in patients with primary biliary cirrhosis may be a useful adjunct to optimize the timing of liver transplantation and to evaluate new pharmacological treatment modalities of this disease. 
Multimodal therapy for the management of localized Ewing's sarcoma of pelvic and sacral bones: a report from the second intergroup study. A total of 59 eligible patients with localized Ewing's sarcoma of the pelvic and sacral bones were entered into a multimodal Intergroup Ewing's Sarcoma Study (IESS-II) (1978 to 1982) and compared with a historical control series of 68 patients entered into an earlier multimodal Intergroup Ewing's Sarcoma Study (IESS-I) (1973 to 1978). High-dose intermittent multiagent chemotherapy (vincristine, cyclophosphamide, Adriamycin [doxorubicin; Adria Laboratories, Columbus, OH], and dactinomycin) was given to all patients for 6 weeks before and for 70 weeks following local therapy. All patients who had a tumor biopsy or incomplete resection performed received a dose of 55 Gy to the tumor bed. With a median follow-up time of 5.5 years, two of 59 patients (3%) had a local recurrence, five patients (8%) had a local recurrence and metastases, and 17 patients (29%) developed metastases only. There was significant statistical evidence of an advantage in relapse-free survival (RFS) and survival (S) for patients on IESS-II versus IESS-I, P = .006 and P = .002, respectively. At 5 years, the comparison between IESS-II versus IESS-I was 55% versus 23% for RFS and 63% versus 35% for S. 
Urticaria pigmentosa and preleukemia: evidence for reactive mast cell proliferation. A 64-year-old man had urticaria pigmentosa and myelodysplasia (refractory anemia with excess blast cells; partial trisomy 8 syndrome) without increased numbers of marrow mast cells. Clonal marrow assays in agar demonstrated normal to increased colony-forming units of granulocytes/macrophages. In long-term liquid cultures containing mast cell growth factor (interleukin 3), his marrow cells proliferated after 3 weeks to produce abnormal myeloid precursors similar to those in the corresponding marrow aspirate specimen. Cells with basophilic-staining granules were less abundant in comparison with normal marrow specimens cultured similarly. These results suggest that the mast cells in this patient are not of the same clone as the preleukemic marrow cells, although the possible marrow-cell origin of urticaria pigmentosa mast cells cannot be excluded. Previous reports suggest that urticaria pigmentosa without systemic mastocytosis occurs as a nonspecific abnormality in a variety of myeloid, lymphoid, and nonhematologic malignancies. Our data also support this hypothesis that urticaria pigmentosa is a reactive process rather than a manifestation of clonal proliferation of the primary malignancy. 
Norepinephrine response to exercise of rats with a chronic myocardial infarction. Plasma and tissue norepinephrine (NE) concentrations were determined at rest and after 45 min of swimming in rats with a surgically induced myocardial infarction (MI) and in rats having undergone a sham operation (SHAM). The MI rats had moderate-sized infarcts and demonstrated decreases in maximal O2 uptake (VO2max) that are consistent with the contention that the animals possessed a significant amount of left ventricular (LV) dysfunction and chronic heart failure (CHF). Plasma NE concentrations measured at rest were not significantly different between the SHAM and MI groups of rats, although a strong trend was found for the plasma NE concentrations to be elevated in the MI group. The plasma NE responses to 45 min of swimming at the same absolute submaximal workload were similar in the two groups of rats in light of the fact that the MI group of rats exercised at a greater percentage of their VO2max when compared with their SHAM counterparts. Exercise produced significant reductions in the NE concentrations of the diaphragm, vastus lateralis, red portion of the gastrocnemius, plantaris, and vastus intermedius muscles for both the SHAM and MI groups of rats. In addition, the NE concentrations measured in both the soleus and red portion of the gastrocnemius muscle were significantly greater in the MI rats when compared with their SHAM counterparts for both rest and exercise conditions. The results from the present study support the hypothesis that the sympathetic response to exercise is either unchanged or attenuated in MI rats that have a significant amount of LV dysfunction and CHF. 
The effect of prostaglandin E1 on acute pulmonary artery hypertension during oleic acid-induced respiratory dysfunction. This study examined the general effect of intravenous PGE1 on RV Ees and effective PA elastance (EA) during acute pulmonary hypertension associated with oleic acid infusion. In eight pigs, RV end-systolic elastance was quantified with the Ees and Ea was defined with reference to the Windkessel model. Oleic acid infusion increased mean PAP and Ea. Prostaglandin E1 reduced PAP and decreased Ea. Ees did not change throughout the study. Mean arterial pressure was reduced and the pulmonary shunt was increased after PGE1 infusion. The PaO2 was reduced. Data from this study suggest that although PGE1 is effective in reducing PAP, it is not as effective in reducing RV afterload. Furthermore, PGE1 does have significant side effects such as reduction of systemic arterial pressure and an increase in pulmonary shunt. 
Naltrexone in functional hypothalamic amenorrhea and in the normal luteal phase. Fifteen young women with a diagnosis of secondary hypothalamic amenorrhea of at least 2 years' duration were given either 50 mg naltrexone daily or placebo, following a randomized double-blind crossover scheme. Seven patients did not menstruate with either therapy. In the other eight, the following results were recorded (mean +/- SD and range): a cycle length of 28.7 +/- 7.6 (12-45) days for naltrexone compared with 30.8 +/- 5.9 (16-43) days for placebo, a follicular phase length of 20.8 +/- 5.4 (14-34) days for naltrexone and 23.2 +/- 4.3 (19-32) days for naltrexone and 8.3 +/- 1.6 (5-10) days for placebo. The number of ovulatory cycles was 18 of 24 (75%) with naltrexone and eight of 24 (33%) with placebo (P less than .05). Most luteal phases were short. In five normally menstruating women, we gave either naltrexone or placebo in the luteal phase using a crossover blinded scheme. Steroidogenesis in the normal luteal phase was not impaired by naltrexone therapy. In functional hypothalamic amenorrheic patients with normal weight, menstruation might be restored by either placebo or naltrexone, but naltrexone provides a clinical and therapeutic advantage by increasing the ovulation rate. 
Multiple site avascular necrosis in HIV infected patients. We describe avascular necrosis at multiple sites in 2 young adults. This is a condition rarely seen except in hypercortisonism or hemoglobinopathies. In one case, it occurred in the first trimester of pregnancy. No obvious cause of osteonecrosis could be found but both patients were infected by the HIV. The role of the latter in the bone necrosis is questionable. 
Impact of age, race, and obesity on hypertensive mechanisms and therapy. Despite the demonstrated efficacy of traditional antihypertensive therapy in reducing blood pressure, hypertension continues to be a major cause of cardiovascular disease morbidity and mortality. Stepped-care therapy is a nonphysiologic approach that, due to potential metabolic derangements and stimulation of undesirable reflex responses, may not substantially reduce the cardiovascular and renal complications associated with hypertension or improve long-term survival in many hypertensive patients. Because of fundamental hemodynamic differences related to the age, race, and weight of hypertensive patients, drug treatment often elicits varying responses. Certain classes of drugs are not only more effective but also more appropriate from a physiologic standpoint in specific types of patients. Therapy selection based in part on hemodynamic mechanisms and demographic patterns is a more rational approach to patient management and may contribute to a better overall outcome than has been observed with conventional treatment. 
A prospective evaluation of intracoronary ethanol ablation of the atrioventricular conduction system. The clinical efficacy and complications associated with ablation of the atrioventricular (AV) conduction system by the selective infusion of ethanol into the AV node artery were prospectively assessed in 12 consecutive patients with medically refractory atrial arrhythmias. Six of the patients had previously failed to have permanent complete AV block created with direct current or radiofrequency catheter ablation. The AV node artery was cannulated with a 0.016 in. (0.041 cm) guide wire in all 12 patients. It was also possible to advance a 2.7F infusion catheter into the AV node artery in all patients. Transient AV block was induced by selective injections into the AV node artery of iced saline solution (8 patients) and of radiographic contrast agent (ioxaglate) (10 patients). The infusion of 2 ml of ethanol (96%) induced immediate complete AV block in all 10 patients who demonstrated AV block with ioxaglate. The escape rhythm exhibited a narrow QRS complex preceded by a His bundle deflection in nine patients and left bundle branch block in one patient. The immediate mean rate of the escape rhythm was 45.3 +/- 13.4 beats/min. In two patients who demonstrated reflux of contrast agent into the distal right coronary artery with selective injections into the AV node artery, transient ST segment elevation developed in the inferior electrocardiographic leads with the infusion of ethanol. There was no change in the left ventricular ejection fraction from the baseline value (0.53 +/- 0.12) to that measured after ablation (0.55 +/- 0.11) and no patient developed wall motion abnormalities. 
Surgical approaches for resection of heterotopic ossification in traumatic brain-injured adults. The site of heterotopic ossification (HO) at the elbow or the hip dictates the surgical approach for resection. Three approaches are used for HO resection at the elbow: (1) a posterolateral approach for posterolateral HO; (2) an anterolateral approach for anterior HO; and (3) a medical approach for medial or posteromedial HO or anterior transfer of the ulnar nerve. Two approaches are recommended for resection of HO at the hip: (1) an anterior approach for anterior or inferomedial HO and (2) a posterior approach for posterior HO. Posterior HO is often associated with a hip-flexion contracture, and an anterior soft-tissue release may be necessary as well. Physical examination indicates the prognosis for functional improvement as well as recurrence. Patients with a near normal neurologic recovery have minimal to no HO recurrence with improved limb function and increased joint motion, whereas a poor neurologic recovery and persistent spasticity are associated with recurrence of HO and no functional limb improvement. Standard roentgenograms aid in selecting the appropriate surgical approach. Radiation, indomethacin, and diphosphonates have been administered for prophylaxis. Physical therapy is necessary until range of motion stabilizes. 
Role of sinus node artery disease in sick sinus syndrome in inferior wall acute myocardial infarction. This study was undertaken to evaluate a possible role of sinus node (SN) artery disease in the pathogenesis of sick sinus syndrome (SSS) in patients with an inferior wall acute myocardial infarction (AMI). Coronary angiography and electrophysiologic studies of the SN, both in the basal state and after pharmacologic autonomic blockade, were performed in 23 study patients (mean age 60 years) with SSS and a previous inferior wall AMI and in another 23 control patients (mean age 57 years) with normal sinus rate and a previous inferior AMI. Stenosis of the SN artery (or that proximal to its origin) greater than 50% was present in 13 study patients (56%) and in 8 control patients (34%) (p less than 0.05). In the study group, the intrinsic heart rate was abnormal in 5 of the 6 patients (83%) with severe SN artery stenosis (greater than or equal to 75% narrowing), in 3 of the 7 (43%) with moderate stenosis (50 to 75% narrowing) and in 3 of the 10 (30%) with insignificant stenosis (less than 50% narrowing). In the study group, the correlation between the SN measures (heart rate, corrected SN recovery time and sinoatrial conduction time) and the severity of SN artery stenosis was good after autonomic blockade (r between 0.59 and 0.64) and poor in the basal state. These data provide evidence for a role of SN artery disease in the pathogenesis of SSS in patients with an inferior wall AMI. 
Transforming growth factor-alpha, epidermal growth factor receptor, and proliferating potential in benign and malignant gliomas. Surgical specimens from six benign and 16 malignant human gliomas were investigated immunohistochemically to correlate the degree of malignancy, the distribution of transforming growth factor-alpha (TGF-alpha) and epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptor, and the potential for cell proliferation using monoclonal antibodies to TGF-alpha, EGF receptor, and Ki-67. Fourteen (88%) of the malignant gliomas and one (17%) of the benign gliomas were found to be positive for TGF-alpha, and 14 (88%) of the malignant gliomas and two (33%) of the benign gliomas expressed EGF receptor. The proliferation index with Ki-67 was 18.8% +/- 8.1% (mean +/- standard deviation) in malignant gliomas and 1.9% +/- 1.8% in benign gliomas. In general, cells positive for EGF receptor and Ki-67 were randomly distributed throughout the tumor tissue, and cells positive for TGF-alpha tended to be clustered without obvious relationship to areas of necrosis or blood vessels. In some tumors, cells positive for TGF-alpha, EGF receptor, and Ki-67 were associated in a focal distribution. The more frequent expression of TGF-alpha and EGF receptor in the highly proliferative malignant gliomas is compatible with a role for TGF-alpha and EGF receptor in the induction or stimulation of malignant gliomas. 
Temporal relationships between plasma and cerebrospinal fluid pharmacokinetics of levodopa and clinical effect in Parkinson's disease. We studied the pharmacokinetics of levodopa and its metabolites in plasma and ventricular cerebrospinal fluid in 4 parkinsonian patients with indwelling Ommaya reservoirs placed at the time of previous adrenal-medullary to caudate nucleus transplantation. Cerebrospinal fluid levodopa levels were 11.9% of those in plasma. Motor performance and dyskinesia correlated more closely with the time course of the appearance of levodopa in the ventricular cerebrospinal fluid than with the plasma levodopa concentration and did not correlate with plasma 3-O-methyldopa or cerebrospinal fluid 3-O-methyldopa or homovanillic acid. Our data confirm that the wearing off of the levodopa effect in patients with advanced Parkinson's disease is a function of drug concentration in the central nervous system. 
Human response against NP-4, a mouse antibody to carcinoembryonic antigen: human anti-idiotype antibodies mimic an epitope on the tumor antigen. Anti-idiotype antibodies (Ab2) were purified from a cancer patient treated with NP-4, a murine monoclonal antibody to carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA). These Ab2 were specific for NP-4 and inhibited the binding between NP-4 and CEA. BALB/c mice immunized with these human Ab2 produced anti-Ab2 antibodies that were also reactive with the CEA epitope recognized by NP-4. These results indicate that human Ab2 to NP-4 can antigenically mimic the CEA epitope recognized by NP-4. 
Detection of chimeric BCR-ABL genes in acute lymphoblastic leukaemia by the polymerase chain reaction Philadelphia chromosome-positive acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL) is most common in adults and is associated with poor prognosis. Since karyotypic identification of the Philadelphia translocation has been hampered by technical difficulties, we used the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) to look for the BCR-ABL rearrangement in stored samples from a selected group of 314 German ALL patients. BCR-ABL transcripts were found in 77 of 179 adults and were restricted to those with B-precursor leukaemias. 55% of adult common ALL patients had BCR-ABL and its presence correlated with poor overall survival and remission duration. Of 135 children with common ALL, 5 (6%) primary cases and 8 (17%) with recurrent neoplasias were PCR-positive. We recommend prospective evaluation of BCR-ABL analysis with PCR in patients with a B-precursor leukaemia. 
Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy characterized by marked hypertrophy of the posterior left ventricular free wall: significance and clinical implications. This report describes a subgroup of 17 patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy and an unusual and distinctive pattern of left ventricular hypertrophy characterized on echocardiography by marked thickening of the posterior left ventricular free wall and virtually normal or only modestly increased ventricular septal thickness. This distribution of hypertrophy often created a distinctive pattern of "inverted" asymmetry of the posterior wall relative to the septum. The thickness of the posterior wall was 20 to 42 mm (mean 25), while that of the basal ventricular septum was only 12 to 24 mm (mean 17). The left ventricular outflow tract was narrowed because of anterior displacement of the mitral valve within the small left ventricular cavity. Systolic anterior motion of the mitral valve was present in 16 of the 17 patients. The patients ranged in age from 13 to 54 years (mean 31) at most recent evaluation; most (11 of 17, 65%) were severely symptomatic and had experienced important symptoms early in life (before age 40). The condition of only 4 of these 11 patients improved with medical therapy over an average follow-up period of 9 years; however, 6 of the 7 patients who had unsuccessful medical treatment and underwent operation with mitral valve replacement (5 patients) or ventricular septal myotomy-myectomy (1 patient) experienced symptomatic benefit from surgery. The subgroup of patients described in this report underscores the morphologic and clinical diversity that exists within the overall disease spectrum of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. Characteristically, the patients were young, severely symptomatic and demonstrated evidence of outflow obstruction and an "inverted" asymmetric pattern of posterior free wall left ventricular hypertrophy. 
Neuropsychiatric aspects of psychogenic status epilepticus. We studied 20 patients with continuous repetitive psychogenic seizures simulating status epilepticus. Most patients received intravenous doses of multiple anticonvulsants. Our definition used for status epilepticus was that of Delgado-Escueta et al, at least 30 minutes of repetitive seizures without regaining consciousness. Nineteen of 20 patients were young women, all but one under 40 years of age. Sixteen of these patients had a history of childhood seizures. In over 50% of patients, seizures continued until respiratory arrest and intubation occurred. Thorough neuropsychological testing and psychiatric interview were done after cessation of the acute episode. Long-term outcome and prognosis depended on definitive psychiatric diagnosis. Repetitive psychogenic seizures simulating status epilepticus are not uncommon, and such patients may incur serious iatrogenic complications from treatment for status epilepticus. Appropriate management and long-term prognosis may be determined by the type and severity of the underlying psychiatric disorder. 
Survival of patients with well-differentiated astrocytomas diagnosed in the era of computed tomography. We report 25 verified cases of well-differentiated cerebral astrocytomas in adults treated between 1978 and 1988. All patients were diagnosed by computed tomographic (CT) scans, with 5 undergoing a craniotomy for debulking and 20 undergoing a biopsy alone. The median survival for the entire group was 8.2 years, the longest survival yet reported for a series of patients with these tumors. A review of the literature suggests that the longer survival observed in more recent series is the result of the earlier diagnosis of tumors afforded by modern brain imaging. Twenty of our patients presented with seizures in the absence of any other focal findings and would probably not have had a biopsy in the era before CT scans until their tumors had progressed. Only 8% of our patients had papilledema at the time of presentation, in contrast to almost half of the patients with low-grade astrocytomas reported before 1975, supporting the hypothesis that patients in the CT era are diagnosed earlier. None of our patients died from progressive low-grade disease. One patient died from a squamous cell cancer, and 7 died as a consequence of their tumors dedifferentiating into a more malignant astrocytoma or glioblastoma multiforme, with a median time of approximately 5 years after the diagnosis. Our findings, together with the available data in the literature, suggest that death from a focal low-grade astrocytoma, in the absence of malignant degeneration, may be a rare event. Consequently, future therapeutic efforts should be targeted at preventing dedifferentiation. 
Expression of a cell adhesion protein (VLA beta) in normal and diseased skin. Biopsies from normal skin (n = 17) and various cutaneous disorders (n = 83) were examined immunohistologically for reactivity with an antibody (CD29) against the common beta chain of the VLA integrin family. In normal skin, CD29 recognized a number of cell types, i.e. endothelial cells, fibroblasts, T lymphocytes and basal keratinocytes. Similar cells were positive in diseased skin, but the expression of VLA beta was upregulated on keratinocytes. The phenotype of the VLA beta-positive T cells was examined in more detail by staining with anti-T-cell antibodies, i.e. CD3, CD4, CD8, CD45RO (UCHL1) and CD45R (2H4). These studies showed that most of the T cells in normal skin, benign cutaneous conditions and early cutaneous T-cell lymphomas (CTCL) expressed a similar phenotype and resembled antigen committed 'memory' (helper/inducer) cells (CD4+, CD29+, CD45RO+, CD45R-). In advanced CTCL, expression of these antigens was more variable, and many of these infiltrates showed aberrant (or unusual) expression of CD29, CD45RO, CD45R and other T-cell antigens. It is concluded that several cells involved in cutaneous immune reactions express a molecule (VLA beta) which acts as a receptor for extracellular matrix components. This molecule is important for the attachment of cells to connective tissue constituents and may act to facilitate the migration of lymphocytes (and other cells) during immune reactions in normal and diseased cutaneous conditions. Advanced CTCL differ from the early lesions and it is possible that there is a progressive accumulation of increasingly malignant (or transformed) cells in these conditions. 
Lipid cyst: classic and atypical appearances. Lipid cysts, a specific type of fat necrosis, frequently have a pathognomonic appearance on radiographs. This consists of a lucent lesion surrounded by a smooth rim that may or not be calcified. Occasionally, lipid cysts with unusual mammographic appearances are encountered. An appreciation of some of these appearances may prevent unnecessary biopsies. 
Angioscopically directed valvulotomy: a new valvulotome and technique. Despite a large experience with "blind" retrograde valvulotomy in in situ vein bypass grafting, the incidence of residual competent valves remains high, and valvulotome-induced injury is common. In this study we describe a new valvulotome and technique of angioscopically directed valvulotomy and review the video tape recordings of 85 completion angioscopies of in situ femorodistal bypasses. Fifty-three vein grafts were prepared with the blind retrograde valvulotomy technique and 32 vein grafts with the new valvulotome and angioscopy. The use of the new valvulotome and technique is compared with that of the standard blind retrograde valvulotomy technique, and the normal endoluminal anatomy and incidence of primary disease in saphenous vein grafts was noted. The incidence of valvulotome-induced injury was 5/32 (15.6%) and 45/53 (85%) in vein grafts prepared with angioscopically directed valvulotomy and blind retrograde valvulotomy, respectively. Residual competent valves were found in 10/53 (18.9%) in blind retrograde valvulotomy and 0/25 of angioscopically directed valvulotomy vein grafts (p = 0.0114). In 22/53 vein grafts unsuspected primary disease was detected. Angioscopically directed valvulotomy with the new valvulotome and technique is feasible, reliable, and safe. It avoids residual competent valves, minimizes valvulotome-induced injury, and allows the detection and correction of unappreciated primary vein graft abnormalities. The new valvulotome and technique is a first step in the complete endoluminal preparation of the in situ vein graft. 
Large vessel vasculitis of the central nervous system in systemic lupus erythematosus: report and review of the literature. Large vessel vasculitis rarely involves the central nervous system in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus. We describe an exemplary case, along with its dramatic cerebral angiogram, and review the literature on this unusual entity. 
Acute cor pulmonale secondary to metastatic tumor to the heart: a case report and literature review. Metastatic tumors to the heart are becoming more common due to improved survival afforded by advanced treatment of malignancies. Their presence should be sought in a cancer patient who develops new primary cardiac symptoms. We present a case of a 50-year-old woman who succumbed to acute cor pulmonale secondary to metastatic laryngeal carcinoma to the right ventricle with subsequent tumor emboli to the pulmonary vasculature. 
Predictors of first discharge and subsequent survival in patients with automatic implantable cardioverter-defibrillators. BACKGROUND. Two hundred eighteen patients were evaluated in a two-phase approach (time to first appropriate discharge, survival after discharge) to identify factors that may be related to maximal benefit derived from use of an automatic implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (AICD). METHODS AND RESULTS. One hundred ninety-seven patients survived implantation of AICD, with or without concomitant cardiac surgery. One hundred five patients had an AICD discharge associated with syncope, presyncope, documented sustained ventricular tachycardia or fibrillation, or sleep at 9.1 +/- 11.1 months after implantation. Patients survived 23.8 +/- 18.0 months after AICD discharge. Left ventricular dysfunction (p = 0.008 for ejection fraction less than 25%) was associated with earlier AICD discharge and shortened survival after AICD discharge (p = 0.008 for ejection fraction less than 25%; p = 0.01 for New York Heart Association functional class III and IV). beta-Blocker administration (p = 0.006) and coronary bypass surgery (p = 0.06) were associated with later AICD discharge. Coronary bypass surgery (p = 0.035) but not beta-blockers was associated with more prolonged survival after AICD discharge. CONCLUSIONS. These data suggest that a relatively easy algorithm can be applied to predict which patient will benefit most from AICD implantation. 
Amsacrine is safe and effective therapy for patients with myocardial dysfunction and acute leukemia. The role of amsacrine in inducing remission in patients with cardiac disease and acute leukemia was evaluated. There were 17 patients with acute myelogenous leukemia (AML), six with acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL), and one with biphenotypic leukemia. In this series of 24 patients whose disease had relapsed and who had reduced left ventricular ejection fraction, nine had a complete remission, seven with AML and two with ALL. In addition, four of six with newly diagnosed acute leukemia and reduced left ventricular ejection fraction also responded. Among nine patients who underwent endomyocardial biopsy, none had morphologic changes of sufficient degree to account for drug-induced heart failure. Patients with preexisting arrhythmias received amsacrine without incident if their serum potassium level was higher than 4.0 mEq/l at the time of drug administration. Amsacrine is safe and effective therapy for patients with acute leukemia and cardiac disease. 
New technique for pacemaker implantation in the upper chest of children and women. A new lateral approach for implanting pacemaker generators in the chest of women and children is described. Using this technique, 83 women and 21 children were operated on with no early or late complications and with good cosmetic results up to 9 years after operation. This technique prevents formation of visible wide scars above the breast in women and prevents thinning or disruption of the chest incision in children. Ages of the women ranged from 19 to 56 years; children, 5 to 18 years. In 23 patients, this technique was used after wound complications had occurred 7 days to 3 years after use of the standard implantation technique. 
Diagnostic accuracy of thallium-201 myocardial perfusion imaging. Myocardial thallium-201 (Tl-201) imaging performed in conjunction with exercise stress has enhanced the accuracy of detecting coronary artery disease among patients with chest pain. Sensitivity and specificity of qualitative visual Tl-201 scintigraphy for detection of coronary artery disease average 84% and 87%, respectively. Quantitative analysis of planar Tl-201 scintigrams has yielded sensitivity and specificity in the 90% range. Single photon emission computed tomographic imaging is associated with even higher sensitivity but with specificity in the 82-85% range. Perfusion defects representing ischemia can now be distinguished from scar by demonstration of delayed Tl-201 redistribution or enhanced uptake after reinjection of a second dose of Tl-201. Stenoses of the left circumflex coronary artery are less easily detected than lesions of the right and left anterior descending coronary arteries. False-positive Tl-201 perfusion defects may occur as a result of attenuation artifacts, most often caused by overlying breast tissue or by a high left hemidiaphragm. Patient motion during acquisition of single photon emission computed tomographic images results in artifactual defects on reconstruction. Abnormal Tl-201 uptake has been noted in patients with 1) left bundle branch block and normal coronary arteries, 2) hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, and 3) progressive systemic sclerosis. 
Flow-mediated dilatation of the basilar artery in vivo. Flow-mediated dilatation has been described mainly in peripheral conduit arteries. The goal of this study was to examine mechanisms and functional implications of flow-mediated dilatation in large cerebral arteries in vivo. Vessel diameter and velocity of blood flow through the basilar artery were measured using a cranial window in 45 anesthetized rats. Mean blood flow velocity through the basilar artery increased by 94 +/- 8% during unilateral common carotid artery occlusion and 203 +/- 13% during bilateral occlusion. Diameter of the basilar artery increased by 10 +/- 1% during unilateral common carotid artery occlusion and 29 +/- 2% during bilateral occlusion from control diameter of 275 +/- 8 microns. Vasodilatation appeared with a delay of 13 +/- 1 seconds after the onset of the increase in flow velocity. With systemic arterial pressure maintained at baseline levels, pressure in the basilar artery (servonull) decreased initially during carotid occlusion, and during dilatation of the basilar artery, pressure was restored partially toward normal. Indomethacin (10 mg/kg i.v.), topical application of tetrodotoxin (10(-6) M), NG-monomethyl L-arginine (5 x 10(-6) M), tetraethylammonium chloride (10(-2) M), glibenclamide (10(-5) M), SKF 525A (3 x 10(-5) M), and ouabain (10(-5) M) had no effect on flow-mediated dilatation. 
Minor contribution of hepatocytes to collagen production in normal and early fibrotic rat livers. Hepatocyte contribution to hepatic collagen production in vivo was estimated in rats, based on the fact that ornithine is used for protein synthesis in the liver as arginine after conversion by way of the urea cycle only by hepatocytes. From rats given a mixture of [14C] ornithine and [3H]arginine, hepatic collagen and serum albumin were obtained. The hepatocyte contribution was calculated from the 14C and 3H in arginine purified from collagen and albumin by high performance liquid chromatography. The contribution was less than 10% of total collagen production in normal and early fibrotic livers induced by a single dose of carbon tetrachloride or dimethylnitrosamine. We conclude that hepatocytes may play a minor role in collagen production in normal and early fibrotic rat livers. 
Childhood blindness in the Republic of Ireland: a national survey. We completed a national study of blindness in children under 16. Approximately 80% of the blind children (that is, with vision of 3/60 or less) in the Republic of Ireland (172 children) were seen, 93 males and 79 females. The survey was carried out between July 1989 and June 1990. It is the first such study to be carried out. Ninety seven (56%) children had lesions due to factors acting before the perinatal period. Of these, 28 (16% of the total number surveyed) had lesions due to genetic causes; 69 (40%) had lesions due to factors operating in the prenatal period other than genetic factors. Forty six (27%) had lesions due to factors acting in the perinatal period. Twenty two (13%) had lesions due to factors acting in childhood. (4% could not be categorised in this way). The commonest single primary diagnoses were birth asphyxia in 19 (11%) cases and retinopathy of prematurity in 19 (11%) cases. 
The TPR-MET oncogenic rearrangement is present and expressed in human gastric carcinoma and precursor lesions. The TPR-MET oncogenic rearrangement was originally observed in an in vitro transformed human osteosarcoma cell line. Recently, we detected the expression of this rearrangement at very low levels in several cell lines derived from human tumors of nonhematopoietic origin using a highly sensitive method based on polymerase chain reaction amplification of the transcript. We report here the results of analysis of TPR-MET expression in cell lines derived from human gastric tumors and 22 biopsy samples of human gastric mucosa showing cancer or precursor lesions. The rearranged RNA was expressed in all four cell lines as well as in biopsy samples from 12 of the 22 patients. Overexpression of TPR-MET RNA in superficial gastritis lesions with hyperplasia of glandular neck cells suggests the possible involvement of this oncogene at an early stage of gastric tumorigenesis. Analysis of gastric biopsy samples for RAS gene mutations showed base substitutions occurring in the codon 12 region of Ki- and Ha-RAS genes in four cases, including two precursor lesions. 
Deep vein thrombosis: effect of graduated compression stockings on distension of the deep veins of the calf. The mechanisms by which graduated compression stockings prevent deep vein thrombosis are not completely understood. Recent work has suggested that venous distension plays a role in initiating the process. Our previous work has shown that the deep veins of the lower limb distend in patients undergoing surgical procedures. We have investigated 40 patients receiving surgical treatment on the abdomen or neck. A medial gastrocnemius vein was studied using ultrasound imaging during the operations. In half the patients a graduated compression anti-embolism stocking was applied to the limb under study at the start of the operation, immediately after initial measurements of vein diameter. The median vein diameter in both groups was the same at the start of the operative procedures (control, 2.6 mm, interquartile range 2.1-3.3 mm; stocking, 2.6 mm, interquartile range 2.1-3.7 mm). After application of a stocking the median diameter in this group fell to 1.6 mm (interquartile range 1.3-2.8 mm) and then decreased slightly at the end of the operation. In the control group the vein diameter increased to 2.9 mm (interquartile range 2.3-4.0 mm) during the operative procedure. 
Identification and mapping to chromosome 1 of a susceptibility locus for periinsulitis in non-obese diabetic mice. Insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM) is a polygenic disease caused by autoimmune destruction of insulin-producing beta cells in the islets of Langerhans. Its onset is preceded by a long and variable period in which lymphoid cells infiltrate the pancreas but first remain outside the islets (peri-insulitis) before invading them (insulitis). Among susceptibility loci, only the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) has been clearly assigned. Genetic study of the nonobese diabetic (NOD) mouse model for insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus has revealed genetic linkage of insulitis and of early onset diabetes with two non-MHC loci mapping to chromosome 3 and 11 respectively. Here we report a close association of periinsulitis with a third non-MHC locus mapping to chromosome 1. Successive stages in the progression of diabetic disease thus appear to be controlled by distinct genes or sets of genes. 
Failure of treatment with teicoplanin at 6 milligrams/kilogram/day in patients with Staphylococcus aureus intravascular infection. The Infectious Diseases Consortium of Oregon. Patients with blood cultures positive for gram-positive cocci were enrolled in a prospective randomized double-blind comparative trial of vancomycin at 15 mg/kg every 12 h versus teicoplanin at 6 mg/kg every 12 h for three doses and then 6 mg/kg every 24 h. A total of 54 patients were randomized, and 40 were evaluable. Of the 40, 9 had infection of indwelling vascular catheters. Four infections were due to Staphylococcus aureus, and five were due to Staphylococcus epidermidis. In concert with catheter removal, all patients were treated successfully, regardless of which drug they were taking. Of 31 patients without an indwelling catheter, 19 were infected with S. aureus, and 12 of the 19 had either endocarditis or mycotic aneurysm. Six of eight patients given teicoplanin failed treatment, as opposed to one of four patients given vancomycin (P = 0.14). Of greater concern, four of four patients with left-sided endocarditis or mycotic aneurysm failed to recover when given teicoplanin, as opposed to one of three patients given vancomycin (P = 0.07). Although not quite statistically significant, the unexpectedly high number of treatment failures with teicoplanin resulted in a decision to discontinue patient enrollment. It is suggested that future trials explore the efficacy of larger doses of teicoplanin. 
Stroke Prevention in Atrial Fibrillation Study. Final results BACKGROUND. Atrial fibrillation in the absence of rheumatic valvular disease is associated with a fivefold to sevenfold increased risk of ischemic stroke. METHODS AND MAIN RESULTS. The Stroke Prevention in Atrial Fibrillation Study, a multicenter, randomized trial, compared 325 mg/day aspirin (double-blind) or warfarin with placebo for prevention of ischemic stroke and systemic embolism (primary events), and included 1,330 inpatients and outpatients with constant or intermittent atrial fibrillation. During a mean follow-up of 1.3 years, the rate of primary events in patients assigned to placebo was 6.3% per year and was reduced by 42% in those assigned to aspirin (3.6% per year; p = 0.02; 95% confidence interval, 9-63%). In the subgroup of warfarin-eligible patients (most less than 76 years old), warfarin dose-adjusted to prolong prothrombin time to 1.3-fold to 1.8-fold that of control reduced the risk of primary events by 67% (warfarin versus placebo, 2.3% versus 7.4% per year; p = 0.01; 95% confidence interval, 27-85%). Primary events or death were reduced 58% (p = 0.01) by warfarin and 32% (p = 0.02) by aspirin. The risk of significant bleeding was 1.5%, 1.4%, and 1.6% per year in patients assigned to warfarin, aspirin, and placebo, respectively. CONCLUSIONS. Aspirin and warfarin are both effective in reducing ischemic stroke and systemic embolism in patients with atrial fibrillation. Because warfarin-eligible patients composed a subset of all aspirin-eligible patients, the magnitude of reduction in events by warfarin versus aspirin cannot be compared. Too few events occurred in warfarin-eligible patients to directly assess the relative benefit of aspirin compared with warfarin, and the trial is continuing to address this issue. Patients with nonrheumatic atrial fibrillation who can safely take either aspirin or warfarin should receive prophylactic antithrombotic therapy to reduce the risk of stroke. 
Ploidy in invasive colorectal cancer. Implications for metastatic disease. A retrospective study was performed to determine the ploidy of superficial (above muscularis propria) and deep (below muscularis propria) biopsy specimens from the primary colorectal cancer of 88 patients with Dukes Stage C2 and D colorectal tumors. The ploidy of lymph node and liver metastases was compared with that of the superficial and deep specimen from the corresponding primary tumor. Among the tumors studied, 78% exhibited nondiploid stemlines. In 19% of the tumors, the ploidy of the superficial biopsy differed from that of the deep biopsy. Among these discordant tumors, all of the deep biopsy specimens corresponded in ploidy to the liver metastases, whereas most of the superficial specimens were similar in ploidy to the lymph node metastases. Our observations suggest that measurement of a single site may not be sufficient to detect nondiploid stemlines within a tumor. They also suggest that measurement of deeper parts of invasive tumors may be more reflective of the phenotype of distant metastases than measurement of superficial specimens. 
Holmium laser angioplasty after failed coronary balloon dilation: use of a new solid-state, infrared laser system. A new solid-state laser system was used in a case of saphenous vein graft occlusion untreatable by standard very low-profile balloon angioplasty. The 2100 nm infrared pulsed thulium/holmium: YAG laser successfully recanalized an obtuse marginal bypass graft without complications. The holmium laser has several advantages over excimer systems and may prove an effective adjunct or alternative to coronary balloon angioplasty. 
Ultrasound diagnosis of an obstructive cardiac rhabdomyoma with severe hydrops and hypoplastic lungs. A case report. Cardiac rhabdomyomas of the fetus and neonate are benign cardiac muscle hamartomas with an incidence of 0.027% in pediatric autopsies. This is the third reported case of prenatally diagnosed cardiac rhabdomyoma, the second with severe hydrops and the only one associated with aortic valve hypoplasia and hypoplastic lungs. 
Bone marrow: ultrasmall superparamagnetic iron oxide for MR imaging. An ultrasmall superparamagnetic iron oxide (USPIO) preparation was evaluated as a potential intravenous contrast agent for magnetic resonance (MR) imaging of bone marrow. One hour after administration of USPIO (40, 80, and 160 mumols of iron per kilogram body weight) in rats and rabbits, T1 and T2 relaxation times were, respectively, approximately 30%, 50%, and 65% lower than precontrast relaxation times. Maximum decrease in relaxation times of marrow occurred within 1-24 hours after intravenous administration; thereafter, relaxation times slowly returned to normal within 7 days. In vivo MR imaging of rabbits and rats confirmed that USPIO decreases signal intensity of red and yellow marrow. The decrease was most marked with gradient echo pulse sequences. An animal model of intramedullary tumor demonstrated the potential of USPIO to enable differentiation between tumor and normal red marrow. USPIO-enhanced MR imaging improves detection of smaller tumors and allows differentiation of tumor deposits from islands of hyperplastic or normal red marrow. 
Schwannomas of the paranasal sinuses. Case report and clinicopathologic analysis. Schwann's cell tumors are common neoplasms arising from the neural sheath of autonomic, cranial, or peripheral nerves. We describe a case of destructive malignant schwannoma of the right ethmoid and sphenoid sinuses. The tumor was successfully treated by surgical excision, external radiotherapy, and radon seed implants. The patient remains symptom free 3 years after therapy ended, emphasizing the previously unrecognized benefits of radiotherapy for these types of tumors. The value of endoscopy in diagnosing and following schwannomas of the nasal and paranasal sinuses is highlighted in our review of the clinicopathologic features and radiologic findings of this tumor. 
Differential regulation of thyroid hormone receptor messenger ribonucleic acid levels by thyrotropin-releasing hormone. In addition to its well known actions in stimulating TSH and PRL synthesis and secretion, TRH has been shown to decrease the concentration of thyroid hormone receptors (TRs) in GH4C1 cells as measured by nuclear thyroid hormone (T3) binding. In the present study we have investigated the effects of TRH on the levels of mRNA encoding the different forms of TR, TR beta-1, TR beta-2, and TR alpha-1 as well as that of the non-T3-binding variant, c-erbA alpha-2. GH3 cells were incubated with 100 nM TRH in the presence or absence of 1 nM T3 for 48 h, and mRNA levels were determined by Northern blot analysis. Results revealed that there is differential regulation of the individual TRs by TRH at the pretranslational level. The mRNA for the pituitary-specific form of TR, TR beta-2, was down-regulated by 60% by TRH in GH3 cells, while that of its alternative splice product, TR beta-1, was unchanged. A modest change was observed in TR alpha-1 mRNA levels, which were down-regulated by 20%; there was no change in c-erbA alpha-2 mRNA levels. Levels of nuclear T3 binding were assessed under the same conditions, and 100 nM TRH was found to decrease binding by 40% from 0.78 to 0.46 fmol/micrograms DNA. A similar change in nuclear T3 binding was seen after incubation with 1 nM T3. The effect of TRH on the GH mRNA response to T3 was investigated. In the absence of TRH there was a 4-fold induction of GH mRNA after incubation with 1 nM T3. In the presence of 100 nM TRH, no significant induction in GH mRNA by T3 was seen, indicating that T3 responsiveness as well as receptor concentration are diminished by TRH under these conditions. 
Current role of catheter ablative procedures in patients with cardiac arrhythmias. A report for health professionals from the Subcommittee on Electrocardiography and Electrophysiology, American Heart Association. Catheter ablative techniques have assumed an increasingly important role in the treatment of patients with drug-refractory cardiac arrhythmias. Catheter ablation of the AV junction is considered the procedure of choice for management of patients without bypass tracts with drug-resistant supraventricular arrhythmias. Catheter techniques have been used with increasing frequency in attempts to ablate accessory AV tracts. These techniques currently appear to be less effective than surgical techniques but involve less morbidity and expense. In some centers, accessory pathway ablation using catheter techniques is the procedure of first choice in selected patients with drug-refractory tachycardia mediated by an accessory pathway. Catheter ablation of ventricular tachycardia should be reserved for patients with mappable ventricular tachycardia who are not candidates for cardiac electrosurgery or insertion of an automatic defibrillator. The development of more flexible catheters and more manageable energy delivery systems holds promise for more effective catheter techniques. 
Assessment of severity of coronary narrowings by quantitative exercise echocardiography and comparison with quantitative arteriography. To determine the correlation of quantitative assessment of coronary narrowings with left ventricular functional impairment induced by exercise, 57 patients with 1-vessel coronary artery disease and without evidence of collateral flow were studied. A significant relation was observed between minimal cross-sectional area, percent area stenosis, minimal lumen diameter, percent diameter stenosis and the percentage of segmental area change from rest to peak exercise in a vascular distribution territory (r = 0.76, p less than 0.001; r = -0.55, p less than 0.001; r = 0.56, p less than 0.001; r = -0.75, p less than 0.001, respectively). For minimal cross-sectional area, the best cut-off value to separate significantly patients who had a decrease in contractility at peak exercise testing from those who had a normal response was 2 mm2 (p less than 0.001); for percent cross-sectional area stenosis, it was 75% (p less than 0.001); for minimal lumen diameter, it was 0.7 mm (p less than 0.001); and, for percent diameter stenosis, it was 85% (p less than 0.001). High cut-off values for angiographic variables are necessary to separate significantly patients who have a decrease in contractility at peak exercise testing from those who have a normal response. Several patients with mild coronary stenoses may have either normal or abnormal wall motion during exercise. Thus, exercise echocardiography is a useful tool in detecting the presence of fairly severe anatomic narrowing, whereas it is of limited clinical use in the assessment of intermediate coronary atherosclerotic lesions. 
Non-invasive assessment of pulmonary arterial pressure in healthy neonates. Doppler echocardiograms were carried out on 51 healthy babies three times during the first 72 hours of life to estimate pulmonary arterial systolic pressure by measuring regurgitant tricuspid jet velocity and applying the Bernoulli equation. Tricuspid regurgitation was detected at some stage in all preterm babies and most of those born at full term. Pulmonary arterial pressure could be measured from peak regurgitant velocity in babies with pansystolic regurgitation. The incidence of pansystolic regurgitation among 34 term babies at 0-12, 13-36, and 32-72 hours of age was 22, 27, and 19%, and in 17 preterm babies (within the same age groups) was 53, 50, and 31%, respectively. Estimates of pulmonary artery pressure in the term babies were in accord with known catheter values. Pressure fell rapidly during the first day in all 51 babies. The ratio of pulmonary:systemic arterial pressure was comparable between the two groups throughout. Ductal flow patterns mirrored the fall in this ratio with age--bidirectional flow was associated with a ratio of between 0.88:1 and 1.22:1 and high velocity left to right flow with a ratio of between 0.49:1 and 0.66:1. Both these techniques are noninvasive ways of assessing neonatal pulmonary arterial pressure. 
Peritoneal seeding following potentially curative resection of colonic carcinoma: implications for adjuvant therapy. Adjuvant therapeutic strategies for colon cancer are based on the knowledge of tumor recurrence patterns following potentially curative resection. Innovative methods for regional delivery of chemotherapy to the liver and peritoneal surfaces are now available to complement systemic treatment. We reviewed clinical, reoperation, and autopsy series to determine the incidence of peritoneal seeding following colon cancer resection. The data suggest a 25-35 percent peritoneal failure rate among patients that recur, indicating that intraperitoneal chemotherapy is a sensible adjuvant approach. The theory behind intraperitoneal chemotherapy and potential complications is discussed. We suggest initiation of clinical trials combining systemic and intraperitoneal chemotherapy. 
Beat-to-beat electrocardiographic morphology variation in healed myocardial infarction. Using high-fidelity electrocardiographic (ECG) amplifiers, we measured subtle beat-to-beat ECG morphologic variations at different phases of the ECG complex. The electrocardiograms were recorded from 49 men with a documented Q-wave myocardial infarction and from 30 age-matched normal men. Forty consecutive beats were averaged to achieve an average ECG signal from which variance could be calculated. The relative variance, defined as the ratio between the integrated variance of the examined window and the integrated variance of the ECG signal that was close to full cycle length, was calculated at QRS onset and at offset in 2 frequency bands (4 to 40 and 60 to 120 Hz). Patients with healed infarction had a relative variance of 2.1 +/- 0.5 (mean +/- standard deviation [SD]) at QRS offset (a window of 40 ms), which was significantly lower than that of the healthy volunteers: 2.5 +/- 0.33 (mean +/- SD; p less than 0.02) at the low-frequency band. At the high-frequency band, patients with healed infarction had a significantly higher relative variance than the control subjects at QRS onset: 1.95 +/- 0.58 vs 1.55 +/- 0.35 (mean +/- SD; p less than 0.005). A model based on the numerous minor conduction abnormalities that exist in the chronically ischemic myocardium is presented to explain the changes in variance at the onset and offset of the QRS. The variance changes described can eventually serve as quantitative indexes of myocardial injury and electrical stability in patients with ischemic heart disease. 
Patient acceptance of Nordiject: a new drug delivery system for growth hormone. Twenty-seven children, aged 5-20 years, with growth retardation were enrolled in an open study to evaluate the acceptability of a new injection pen (Nordiject 24, Novo Nordisk A/S) for administration of recombinant human growth hormone (r-hGH). Prior to this study, 17 of the patients had been receiving treatment with r-hGH administered via syringes and vials; their experiences with this conventional technique have been used for comparison with Nordiject. The injection pen is provided with a replaceable 27-gauge needle and a cartridge containing 24 IU of reconstituted r-hGH (12 IU/mL). A benzyl alcohol 0.9% solution is used as the solvent for the reconstitution. The pen can be regulated for doses from 0.5 to 8 IU per injection; regulation is accomplished by a turning movement. The patients had no problems with the dissolving procedure or handling the pen. Nearly two-thirds of the patients experienced less injection pain with the pen as compared with the syringe. Special attention was paid to local tolerability, which was reported to be good. The thigh was the preferred injection site. The residual contents from 68 cartridges returned by the patients were analyzed for microbial contamination. Contamination was detected in only one cartridge, which could not be confirmed in a repeated test. Because of the simplification of the injection procedure afforded by the injection pen, 20 of 27 patients were able to perform the injections themselves and hence assume a more active role in their treatment. The patients who previously had been using conventional syringes strongly preferred the pen, and all patients wished to continue using the device. 
Recurrent buccal space abscesses: a complication of Crohn's disease. A patient is described with generalized gastrointestinal involvement by Crohn's disease. Symptoms of recurrent ulceration and mucosal tags are well-described oral manifestations of Crohn's disease; however, in our patient recurrent facial abscesses, which required extraoral drainage, also developed. This complication has not previously been reported. 
Aspiration cytology of breast. Most primary malignant epithelial neoplasms and many benign lesions of the breast possess such characteristic cytologic features that they can be diagnosed with certainty by needle aspiration. Because inadequate sampling may result in a false-negative cytology diagnosis, the time-tested rule is that a negative cytologic diagnosis is not definitive unless it is fully supported by negative clinical and mammographic findings. 
Obstructive sleep apnea during pregnancy. Therapy and implications for fetal health. A 32 yr-old woman in her last trimester of pregnancy was found to have severe obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). The overnight polysomnogram demonstrated an apnea plus hypopnea index of 159 events per hour. Apneas were associated with severe oxygen desaturation to 40% during rapid eye movement sleep, maternal bradycardia, and second degree heart block. External cardiotocography showed normal fetal heart rate reactivity to fetal movements, even during the apneas and episodes of oxygen desaturation. Nasal continuous positive airway pressure at a level of 15 cm H2O effectively treated the apneas and desaturation and had no effect on the fetal heart rate. The patient was induced electively during the 39th wk of pregnancy and gave birth to a newborn with growth retardation. Early recognition and treatment of OSA in pregnancy might prevent problems with fetal development. 
Short-term effect of albuterol, delivered via a new auxiliary device, in wheezy infants. In a double-blind, placebo-controlled study, the response of lung function to albuterol, topically administered by a metered-dose inhaler (MD) through a baby-adapted auxiliary device, was evaluated in 36 wheezy infants (1.6 to 25.2 months of age; median 8.1 months). The auxiliary device contains an air chamber of 350 ml and two low-resistant valves separating the inspiratory from the expiratory line. After baseline lung function measurements by infant whole-body plethysmography, the patients were randomly assigned to inhale either three times two puffs albuterol (100 micrograms/puff) or three times two puffs placebo at 5-min intervals. Changes in the degree of pulmonary hyperinflation, estimated by thoracic gas volume (TGV) and/or in the degree of bronchial obstruction, estimated by thoracic gas volume (TGV) and/or in the degree of bronchial obstruction, estimated by airway conductance (Gaw), were measured at 5-min intervals for up to 30 min. TGV and Gaw were expressed as standard deviation scores (SDS) of values predicted, and patients improving TGV and/or Gaw more than 2 SD were considered responders. In comparison with placebo, a significant percentage improvement in TGV (by the mean 26 to 53%) and a significant percentage improvement in Gaw (by the mean 34 to 51%) could be found in the active treatment groups. The study documents the usefulness of a new auxiliary device for the administration of aerosolized bronchodilators to wheezy infants. 
Household pets and human infections. Because many Americans keep a wide variety of household pets, they are exposed to the many pet-associated diseases that are transmitted in various ways, including through bites, scratches, saliva, excreta, and respiration. This article briefly describes a number of the illnesses that may be acquired from household pets. 
Scalp tumours mimicking encephaloceles. Two neonates presented with benign scalp tumours that mimicked encephaloceles. In the more recent case ultrasonography confirmed that the tumour was extracranial. 
Dementia presenting with aphasia: clinical characteristics. Dementia, a disorder of multiple cognitive functions, may atypically present as an aphasia. The clinical characteristics are reported of 13 patients with up to 14 years of progressive language impairment before developing dementia. In reviewing the literature, it was found that these patients were similar to those reported with progressive aphasia. It is concluded that dementia may present with an anomic, dysfluent language disorder due to the focal left sylvian onset of several dementing illnesses. 
Functional assessment of neurologic impairment: track analysis in diabetic and compression neuropathies. A laboratory approach to measuring neurologic impairment has been developed that is applicable to systemic disease as well as localized nerve injury. This approach compares individual parameters of the experimental rat hind footprint (walking track) with weight- and sex-matched control track parameters; classic mathematical indexing is not utilized. The normal track data obtained for the Sprague-Dawley rat showed a significant increase in print length (PL), toe spread (TS), and intermediate toe spread (ITS) with increasing rat weight. A significant difference between male and female rats above 400 gm also was noted. For a localized injury (sciatic nerve cut), this approach demonstrated that the contralateral hind footprint was a "compensated" rather than a normal track. This approach to track analysis also was capable of demonstrating progressive neurologic impairment for a sciatic nerve compression model and a systemic disease such as diabetes, as well as demonstrating reversal of these abnormal patterns when the "disease state" was treated. 
Human immunodeficiency virus exanthem. The human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) exanthem can be the primary manifestation of HIV infection. We report three cases of an exanthematous skin eruption associated with acute HIV infection. HIV antigen (p24 core antigen) was present, whereas results of the HIV antibody test were negative. 
Retinoic acid-induced growth inhibition of a human myeloma cell line via down-regulation of IL-6 receptors. In this report we demonstrate that retinoic acid (RA) down-regulated the number of IL-6R on human leukocyte cell lines, including the myeloma cell line AF10, and two B cell hybridomas that correspond to cells at earlier stages of B cell development. Using AF10 cells, whose growth was determined to be mediated by the autocrine action of IL-6, we found that RA reduction of IL-6R was concentration-dependent over a range of 10(-11) to 10(-5) M and corresponded to the ability of the retinoid to inhibit cell proliferation. The down-regulation of IL-6R number by RA was accompanied by reduced IL-6R mRNA expression. RA did not affect endogeneous IL-6 synthesis or secretion from AF10 cells. However, addition of exogenous rIL-6 could overcome RA-induced growth inhibition. Menthol, a structurally unrelated compound to RA, also suppressed IL-6R expression and, correspondingly, inhibited cell growth. Taken together, our results suggest that the antiproliferative action of RA on AF10 cells is caused by reduction of IL-6R expression and subsequent inhibition of IL-6-mediated autocrine growth. These findings suggest the possibility that down-regulation of IL-6R is a means by which RA can modulate immune function. 
Requirement of heparin for arterial and venous thrombolysis with recombinant tissue-type plasminogen activator. The effect of concomitant intravenous (IV) heparin (200 U/kg bolus, followed by 100 U/kg/h) on the efficacy of arterial and venous thrombolysis with IV recombinant tissue-type plasminogen activator (rt-PA; 0.5 mg/kg over 1 hour) was investigated in a combined femoral arterial and venous thrombosis model in the dog. The arterial model consisted of a high-grade stenosis, endothelial damage, and a thrombotic occlusion, and the venous model consisted of a 125I-fibrin-labeled blood clot. After a dose-finding pilot study in four dogs, a randomized, prospective, and blind study was performed in 20 animals pretreated with 2.8 mg/kg IV acetyl salicylic acid (ASA). The combination of rt-PA and heparin (group I, n = 10) induced early (less than 30 minutes) arterial reperfusion in seven dogs, late (greater than 30 minutes) reflow in two dogs, and persistent occlusion in one dog. rt-PA alone (group II, n = 10) was associated with early reperfusion in one dog, late reflow in three dogs, and persistent occlusion in six dogs (P = .018). Reocclusion occurred in five of nine reperfused dogs of group I and in one of four reperfused dogs of group II (P = not significant). Venous clot lysis amounted to 81% +/- 4% (mean +/- SEM) for group I and to 49% +/- 7% for group II (P less than .001). Template bleeding times increased moderately, but significantly, in group I (from 2.2 +/- 0.2 minutes at baseline to 7.0 +/- 1.4 minutes at 30 minutes, P = .006), but only marginally in group II (from 2.2 +/- 0.2 minutes to 3.6 +/- 0.7 minutes, P = .09). No systemic fibrinogen depletion was observed. Thus, the concommitant use of heparin with rt-PA accelerates arterial reperfusion and enhances venous thrombolysis in dogs pretreated with ASA. These results, obtained in a randomized prospective study design, add to a growing body of experimental and clinical evidence, indicating that thrombolytic therapy with rt-PA requires concomitant adjunctive IV heparin for optimal efficacy, even in the face of treatment with ASA. 
Correlates of Beck Depression Inventory scores in an ambulatory elderly population: symptoms, diseases, laboratory values, and medications. BACKGROUND. Depression is one of the most important psychiatric disorders of older people. Between 1% and 5% of elderly persons who live in the community have major depression. Depressed elderly people are thought to be more likely to complain of symptoms such as headache, constipation, and pain than of disordered mood. The purpose of this study was to determine whether certain symptoms, diseases, or drugs used by older people correlate with scores on the Beck Depression Inventory. METHODS. Beck Depression Inventory scores were obtained in an ambulatory elderly population to identify correlates with self-reported signs, symptoms, diseases, drugs, and laboratory values. A total of 1048 participants were studied, including 712 women and 336 men. RESULTS. In this study, 13.7% of the men and 20.7% of the women had scores suggesting possible depression. A linear regression model revealed eight factors of significance in predicting scores on the Beck Depression Inventory. The most important predictors were the total number of symptoms reported by the patient (P less than .0001), and subjective complaints of memory loss (P less than .0003) and of pain in the abdomen (P less than .0004). CONCLUSIONS. Clinically, the results of this study suggest that depression is underdiagnosed in older patients and that multiple somatic symptoms are the best indicator of depression in this population. 
Differential effects of atrial natriuretic peptide and dopamine on urinary protein excretion in chronic glomerulonephritis. 1. To examine whether or not atrial natriuretic peptide-induced proteinuria simply results from increases in urine flow or glomerular filtration rate, we infused dopamine (1 microgram min-1 kg-1) and alpha-human atrial natriuretic peptide (0.025 microgram min-1 kg-1) into nine patients with chronic glomerulonephritis and nine essential hypertensive patients without renal damage, and compared the effects of the two agents on renal function and urinary protein excretion. 2. In patients with chronic glomerulonephritis, dopamine infusion significantly increased urinary sodium excretion (+59%), renal blood flow (+20%) and creatinine clearance (+14%). However, urinary protein excretion was not changed. Addition of atrial natriuretic peptide to the dopamine infusion further increased urinary sodium excretion and maintained creatinine clearance at the same level. In contrast to the infusion of dopamine alone, atrial natriuretic peptide markedly increased urinary protein excretion (77 versus 229 mg min-1 m2, P less than 0.02). Furthermore, the addition of atrial natriuretic peptide elevated the urinary protein/creatinine ratio (1.55 versus 5.35, P less than 0.05), while dopamine alone did not (1.55 versus 1.45, not significant). 3. In essential hypertensive patients, dopamine and dopamine plus ANP showed renal effects similar to those of chronic glomerulonephritis; however, the urinary excretion of protein was not changed significantly. 4. These results suggest that atrial natriuretic peptide may increase urinary protein excretion mainly by increasing the permeability of the damaged glomeruli to protein rather than by simply increasing urine flow or glomerular filtration. Possible mechanisms underlying the proteinuria-increasing effects of atrial natriuretic peptide are discussed. 
Effect of saline infusion on urinary calcium excretion in essential hypertension. Urinary excretion of sodium and calcium was examined in hypertensive (n = 8) and normotensive (n = 7) subjects following infusion of 2% saline at a rate of 11 mL/min for 90 min. The urinary sodium excretion was 204 +/- 38 (mean +/- SEM) muEq/min in normotensives and 233 +/- 28 muEq/min in hypertensives before infusion of saline and increased maximally to 499 +/- 114 muEq/min (P less than .05) and to 928 +/- 68 muEq/min (P less than .01), respectively, after saline infusion. In normotensives, urinary calcium excretion did not change significantly; however, in hypertensives excretion increased markedly (P less than .01) from 6.1 +/- 0.7 muEq/min to 12.3 +/- 1.6 muEq/min. Plasma atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) levels increased significantly (P less than .05) in both groups. Serum ionized calcium and plasma parathyroid hormone (PTH) levels did not change significantly. The increments of urinary sodium and calcium and of plasma ANP, as well as the preinfusion plasma PTH level, were significantly (P less than .05) higher in hypertensives than in normotensives. The present study showed that exaggerated natriuresis was accompanied by hypercalcinuria and an enhanced rise in plasma ANP in hypertensives. Basal levels of plasma PTH were elevated in hypertensives. The calcium deficiency may be attributable to a close relationship between urinary sodium and calcium, and causally related to the disturbance of sodium and volume homeostasis in hypertension, which results in exaggerated natriuresis. 
In-office mental status testing: a practical guide. Elderly patients with dementia often first come to the attention of their primary medical care providers. Evaluation of cognitive functioning is an important part of the diagnostic work-up, since dementia is a disorder defined by problems of mental or cognitive abilities. Mental status examination in the physician's office can provide diagnostically valuable information and prove useful for determining the need for referral for formal neuropsychological testing. This article briefly describes the cognitive changes associated with dementia and explains proper administration and interpretation of the Mini-Mental State Examination, a quantitative screening test of cognitive function. 
Sodium channel density in hypomyelinated brain increased by myelin basic protein gene deletion. Trophic control over the expression and membrane distribution of voltage-dependent ion channels is one of the principal organizing events underlying the maturation of excitable cells. The myelin sheath is a major structural determinant of regional ion channel topography in central axons, but the exact molecular signals that mediate local interactions between the oligodendrocyte and axolemma are not known. We have found that large caliber fibre pathways in the brain of the mutant mouse shiverer (shi, gene on chromosome 18), whose developmental fate of myelination is averted by deletion of five exons in the myelin basic protein gene, have a striking excess of sodium channels. As cytoplasmic membranes of shiverer oligodendroglia still adhere to axons, the evidence indicates that myelin basic protein or a myelin basic protein-dependent glial transmembrane signal associated with compact myelin formation, rather than a simple glial-axon contact inhibition or an intrinsic genetic program of neuronal differentiation, could be critical in downregulating sodium channel density in axons. Here we use the shiverer mutant to show that mature central nervous system projection neurons with large caliber unmyelinated fibres sustain functional excitability by increasing sodium channel density. This axon plasticity, triggered by the absence of a single glial protein, contributes to the unexpectedly mild degree of neurological impairment in the mutant brain without myelin, and may be a potentially inducible mechanism determining the recovery of function from dysmyelinating disease. 
Pain and measles, mumps, and rubella vaccination. Seventy-seven children (mean age 44.2 months) were entered in a randomised double blind study to find out if two commonly used measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) vaccines (Pluserix and MMR II) caused pain on injection. Pain was judged by the amount of crying. Infants given MMR II were 2.31 times more likely to cry than those given Pluserix. 
Early experience with low speed rotational angioplasty. OBJECTIVE--Preliminary assessment of the efficacy and safety of the low speed rotational angioplasty catheter system (ROTACS). DESIGN--Open prospective trial. SETTING--Department of cardiology in a teaching hospital. PATIENTS--Eleven patients (10 with chronic stable angina and one with acute coronary occlusion after conventional angioplasty) in whom a coronary angiogram showed occlusion or critical stenosis of the coronary artery (right in seven patients, circumflex in two, and left anterior descending in two). The nature or severity of the lesion ruled out conventional coronary angioplasty. INTERVENTIONS--An attempt was made to cross the lesion with a rotating guide wire with a blunt swelling at its tip. Where necessary progress was assessed by simultaneous injection of contrast into both main coronary arteries. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES--Progress of the ROTACS through the lesion that allowed a guide wire to pass into the distal vessel was regarded as a device specific success. When a guide wire crossed the lesion aided only by the support of the ROTACS without the use of rotation this was counted as a success that was not device specific. Failure to cross the lesion and any associated complications were noted. RESULTS--The ROTACS crossed only two of the 10 chronic lesions (20% device specific success rate); however, the support it provided enabled a guide wire to cross a further two lesions and allowed subsequent successful angioplasty in four of the 10 patients. One of these four patients presented after five months with recurrent angina requiring bypass grafting. The other three were symptom free at follow up seven months after the procedure. In the one patient with acute coronary occlusion the ROTACS was advanced over the guide wire to allow passage of an angioplasty balloon where this had previously proved impossible. An excellent final result was obtained and this patient remains symptom free. Three of the six patients in whom the ROTACS was unsuccessful had coronary artery dissection without sequelae. Three patients required subsequent elective coronary bypass grafting for control of symptoms while the other three remain well on medical treatment. CONCLUSIONS--The ROTACS may extend the range of patients with coronary artery occlusion or critical stenosis who can be treated non-surgically. The low device specific success rate (20%) achieved in this study indicates that it should be compared with other simpler mechanical devices that may be just as effective. 
The acute and chronic effects of G-lasing on femoral vein grafts in dogs. Each year, 5% of all coronary artery bypass operations are repeat procedures, and 15%-30% of coronary artery vein grafts occlude within the first eighteen months postoperatively. To evaluate the macroscopic and histologic effects of G-lasing on vein grafts and their patency, femoral veins were used to bypass bilaterally induced stenoses of femoral arteries in 10 dogs. The left vein grafts were G-lased with a 1.5 mm, hot-tipped argon laser at 5 watts for ninety seconds, while the right grafts were used as the controls. Acutely, each vein graft demonstrated no evidence of charring or perforation. The percentage of endothelium present in the G-lased vein grafts was consistently less than 5%, whereas the control vein grafts had an average of 70%. After ten weeks, the animals were sacrificed, and the vein grafts were evaluated for histologic changes and patency. There were no significant microscopic differences between the G-lased and control vein grafts. A statistically significant difference in graft patency was not achieved between G-Lased and control vein grafts at 10 weeks, but only a small number of grafts were studied. Further studies will be needed to evaluate the effects of G-lasing on the long-term patency of vein grafts. 
A single base mutation in type I procollagen (COL1A1) that converts glycine alpha 1-541 to aspartate in a lethal variant of osteogenesis imperfecta: detection of the mutation with a carbodiimide reaction of DNA heteroduplexes and direct sequencing of products of the PCR. Skin fibroblasts from a proband with a lethal variant of osteogenesis imperfecta synthesized both apparently normal type I procollagen and a type I procollagen that had slow electrophoretic mobility because of posttranslational overmodifications. The thermal unfolding of the collagen molecules as assayed by protease digestion was about 2 degrees C lower than normal. It is surprising, however, that collagenase A and B fragments showed an essentially normal melting profile. Assay of cDNA heteroduplexes with a new technique involving carbodiimide modification indicated a mutation at about the codon for amino acid 550 of the alpha 1(I) chain. Subsequent amplification of the cDNA by the PCR and nucleotide sequencing revealed a single-base mutation that substituted an aspartate codon for glycine at position alpha 1-541 in the COL1A1 gene. The results here confirm previous indications that the effects of glycine substitutions in type I procollagen are highly position specific. They also demonstrate that a recently described technique for detecting single-base differences by carbodiimide modification of DNA heteroduplexes can be effectively employed to locate mutations in large genes. 
Significance of CSF immunoglobulins in monitoring neurologic disease activity in Behcet's disease. We examined the intrathecal production of immunoglobulins (Ig) G, A, and M in 16 patients with Behcet's disease, 13 of whom have CNS involvement, and in 40 neurologic controls. Oligoclonal IgA and IgM bands were mainly detected in CSF samples from patients with active neuro-Behcet's disease and were documented to disappear when neurologic manifestations remit. Oligoclonal IgG bands, however, were not related to disease activity and were also found in some neurologic controls. High immunoglobulin index values were detected in both active and quiescent diseases and were high in some patients with impaired blood-CSF barriers. The study presented here demonstrates that CSF oligoclonal IgA and IgM may be helpful in monitoring CNS disease activity in neuro-Behcet's and could be useful in understanding the pathogenesis of this disease. 
Radiology in the intensive-care unit. Portable chest radiography is an essential component of clinical patient management in the intensive-care unit. With routine use of this procedure, unexpected cardiopulmonary abnormalities are frequently detected, and malposition or complications of intravascular devices and endotracheal, thoracostomy, or nasogastric tubes are also commonly found. The pulmonary parenchyma may be assessed for changes of acute lung injury, cardiogenic edema, areas of pneumonitis, atelectasis, or other abnormal collections of fluid or air. In mechanically ventilated patients, barotrauma occurs frequently and may be manifested by subtle intrathoracic collections of air. Technical factors may limit the resolution of the anteroposterior chest radiograph obtained at the bedside, but crucial clinical information is often gained. Portable chest radiographic findings, the role of computed tomography and ultrasonography, and interventional radiologic procedures pertinent to patients in the intensive-care unit are reviewed. 
Cervical carcinoma: MR imaging with an endorectal surface coil. Ten consecutive patients with biopsy-proved invasive cervical carcinoma underwent magnetic resonance (MR) imaging with both a standard body coil and with an endorectal surface coil. The endorectal coil provided a markedly improved signal-to-noise ratio, enabling the use of small fields of view; thus, the images had significantly improved in-plane resolution. The images were assigned an MR imaging stage based on the clinical staging system of the International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics. Vaginal wall, vaginal fornix, parametrium, and pelvic side-wall invasion by tumor were all well demonstrated. When compared with body coil images, the endorectal coil images provided increased anatomic detail and demonstrated tissue planes between tumor and normal structures that were not seen on the body coil images. This preliminary investigation indicates that use of an endorectal surface coil is a promising technique to obtain high-resolution images of the female genital tract. This technique has the potential to improve the accuracy of staging for cervical carcinoma. 
Are angiotensin converting enzyme inhibition and aldosterone antagonism equivalent in hypertensive patients over fifty? The effects of inhibiting angiotensin converting enzyme with perindopril and aldosterone with spironolactone were tested in hypertensive patients over fifty. Accordingly, 75 patients with mild hypertension aged 50 to 70 were randomly divided into three groups for a double-blind 8 week comparison of the actions of placebo, 4 to 8 mg/day perindopril, and 37.5 to 75 mg/day spironolactone. Side-effects caused one patient to withdraw from placebo and one from spironolactone treatment. Mean blood pressure rose by 2.4 mm Hg after placebo but dropped by 7.4 and 8.6 after perindopril and spironolactone (P less than .01). Placebo, perindopril, and spironolactone did not alter blood glucose or plasma potassium, but induced, respectively, variations of -0.09, 0, and +0.34 mmol/L in cholesterol (P = .04), and -0.02, -0.05, and +0.27 mmol/L in triglycerides (P less than .01). After the three treatments, changes in angiotensin converting enzyme activity averaged -1, -6, and -1 mU/mL (P less than .01), in active renin -2, +18, and +28 pg/mL (P less than .01), and in aldosterone, +15, +8, and +95 pg/mL (P less than .01). Placebo, perindopril, and spironolactone did not alter microalbuminuria, but reduced urinary kallikrein activity by 0.9, 1.8, and 5.4 mU/mmol creatinine (P = .04). Although short-term administration of spironolactone raised renin and aldosterone markedly and lipids moderately (possibly because of volume contraction), the present results show that perindopril and spironolactone are both safe and effective for treating hypertension at the age of 50 or older. 
Iodine-125 seed implantation as an adjunct to surgery in advanced recurrent squamous cell cancer of the head and neck. Survival for extensive recurrent squamous cell carcinomas of the head and neck remains poor, with the major cause of death being local recurrence. Surgical implantation of iodine-125 interstitial seeds allows tumoricidal doses of radiation to be delivered to residual tumor while minimizing radiation doses to the surrounding tissues. From 1978 to 1988, 39 implantations were performed on 35 patients for extensive recurrent squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck. The decision for implantation was based on positive margins or close to resection margins from frozen sections after salvage resection. The determinate 5-year disease-free survival was 41%, with both the overall and no evidence of disease 5-year survivals being 29%. Significant complications occurred in 36% of all cases. This figure increased to 56% when flap reconstruction was required. Possible reasons for this seemingly high complication rate are discussed. Considering the advanced nature of these recurrent carcinomas, surgical resection with iodine-125 seed implantation appears to be an effective method of managing disease that might otherwise be judged unresectable and treated for palliation only. 
Pathological features of Crohn's disease determining perforation. Even if Crohn's disease (CD) stenoses are related to perforating complications, such as abscess or fistula, it remains unclear why only some stenoses lead to such complications. We have studied the surgical specimens in 94 cases of CD to characterize the anatomical features of stenosis. We found no differences between group A (patients with perforation) and group B (noncomplicated patients) as far as extent of lesion, number of stenoses, and the caliber of the stenotic bowel. In CD of the ileum, the wall thickness of the stenoses was significantly different: 12.0 +/- 3.4 mm in group A and 7.6 +/- 3.1 mm in group B (p less than 0.001). In colonic CD, the length of stenosis was significantly greater in patients with perforation. Duration of symptoms, age at surgery, and sex did not correlate with the increased thickness or with perforating complications. These observations suggest that the fibrotic gastrointestinal tract, poorly distensible, may increase the intraluminal pressure above the stenosis and in this way squeeze bowel content through mucosal fissures of the inflamed bowel. Evaluation and monitoring of wall thickness may help in prompting surgery before the disease is complicated by perforation. 
Squamous carcinoma cell lines produce 1,25 dihydroxyvitamin D, but fail to respond to its prodifferentiating effect. The active metabolite of vitamin D3, 1,25 dihydroxyvitamin D3 [1,25(OH)2D], is produced by normal human keratinocytes (NKC) and regulates their differentiation. Squamous carcinoma cell (SCC) lines lack the ability to differentiate in vitro, which might involve defective 1,25(OH)2D synthesis or response. To address this possibility we obtained four SCC lines (12F2, 12B2, 25, and A431) and first determined whether they could produce 1,25(OH)2D from its substrate 25 hydroxyvitamin D3 (250HD). All could (12F2 greater than NKC greater than 25 greater than 12B2 greater than A431). Furthermore, exogenously added 1,25(OH)2D inhibited 1,25(OH)2D production and stimulated 24,25 dihydroxyvitamin D3 [24,25(OH)2D] production in all cell lines but with different potency (25 = A431 greater than NKC greater than 12B2 greater than 12F2). Cellular binding studies suggested that the high-affinity binding site for 1,25(OH)2D in NKC is not found in 12F2 and 12B2. When the effect of 1,25(OH)2D on differentiation was determined, only NKC responded with an increase in cornified envelope formation, although some of the cell lines responded to the proliferative [at low 1,25(OH)2D concentration] or antiproliferative [at high 1,25(OH)2D concentration] effect of 1,25(OH)2D. Thus, although SCC lines synthesize 1,25(OH)2D and respond to exogenous 1,25(OH)2D with respect to appropriate regulation of endogenous 250HD metabolism, these cell lines fail to respond to the differentiating influence of this vitamin D metabolite. 
Small cell carcinoma of the stomach: a clinicopathologic study of 17 cases. Of 17 cases of small cell carcinoma of the stomach, three were early and 14 were advanced. Grossly, the tumors were mostly polypoid at the early stage, and as they advanced, deep ulcerations developed. Histologically, only one tumor was "oat cell type," and the other 16 were "intermediate cell type." With regard to tumor components, five were "pure" tumor, and 12 were "composite" admixing glandular and/or squamous differentiation. Argyrophil cells were seen in eight tumors. Immunohistochemically positive cells for chromogranin, neuron-specific enolase, and keratin were seen in 12, 10, and 7 tumors, respectively. Carcinoembryonic antigen was negative in the small cell component of most tumors as opposed to strong positivity in the glandular component. Electron-dense core granules were evident in seven of nine tumors examined. These findings suggest that histologic variety is quite characteristic of the small cell carcinomas of the stomach, and this type of carcinoma takes an aggressive clinical course like its counterparts in other organs. 
Disruption of the blood-brain barrier in open and closed cranial window preparations in rats. The goal of this study was to determine whether the severity of disruption of the blood-brain barrier during acute hypertension is similar in open and closed cranial window preparations. Intravital fluorescent microscopy and fluorescein-labeled albumin were used to evaluate disruption of the blood-brain barrier under control conditions and during acute arterial hypertension in 10 rats equipped with an open cranial window and in six rats equipped with a closed cranial window. Permeability of the blood-brain barrier was quantified by calculating the clearance of fluorescein-labeled albumin and by counting the number of microvascular leaky sites under control conditions and during acute hypertension. Pressure in cerebral venules and intracranial pressure were measured in rats equipped with an open cranial window and a closed cranial window, respectively, under control conditions and during acute hypertension. In rats equipped with an open cranial window, arterial pressure increased from 118 +/- 6 to 189 +/- 3 mm Hg (mean +/- SEM) and pial venous pressure increased from 7 +/- 1 to 22 +/- 3 mm Hg during acute hypertension induced with 30 micrograms/kg/min phenylephrine for 5 minutes. In addition, the clearance of fluorescent albumin increased from 0.11 +/- 0.03 to 1.2 +/- 0.4 ml/sec x 10(-6) and the number of microvascular leaky sites increased from 0 to 25 +/- 1 during phenylephrine infusion. In rats equipped with a closed cranial window, arterial pressure increased from 122 +/- 5 to 187 +/- 7 mm Hg and intracranial pressure increased from 3 +/- 1 to 12 +/- 1 mm Hg during the intravenous infusion of 30 micrograms/kg/min phenylephrine for 5 minutes. 
Are there interactions and relations between genetic and environmental factors predisposing to high blood pressure? An overview of published observations suggests that both genetic predisposition and environment work together to produce hypertension in most persons. High blood pressure before age 55 occurs 3.8 times more often among persons with a strong positive family history of high blood pressure. Much of the total variability in blood pressure in modern populations seems attributable to genetic factors. Estimates of the proportion of the variance attributable to all genetic factors (heritability [H2]) vary from 25% in pedigree studies to 65% in twin studies for sitting diastolic blood pressure. Several biochemical traits associated with high blood pressure are highly genetic (H2, 78-84%) and may help elucidate the pathophysiology of high blood pressure. While pertinent environmental factors such as salt intake, alcohol use, and amount of exercise also correlate significantly among relatives, only 7% of the total variance of diastolic blood pressure seems attributable to all shared environmental factors in family households. Thus most familial aggregation of high blood pressure appears to be due to genes rather than shared family environment. Practical benefit may result from identifying familial predisposition in multiple siblings with high blood pressure before age 55 and lipid abnormalities (labeled "familial dyslipidemic hypertension"). About 12% of high blood pressure patients have familial dyslipidemic hypertension and also have high risk of early coronary heart disease. Hyperinsulinemia and central obesity as well as high triglycerides and low high density lipoprotein cholesterol are prominent features of familial dyslipidemic hypertension. 
Immunohistochemical study of childhood rhabdomyosarcomas and related neoplasms. Results of an Intergroup Rhabdomyosarcoma study project. The authors assessed a panel of immunohistochemical stains against 109 pediatric solid tumors, primarily rhabdomyosarcomas, under the auspices of the Intergroup Rhabdomyosarcoma Study. Fresh tumor tissue received from participating organizations was divided into portions that were either frozen or fixed in formalin, alcohol, or B5. Immunostaining was performed by the avidin-biotin complex method using monoclonal antibodies to desmin, neurofilaments, vimentin, cytokeratin, and leukocyte common antigen on cryostat sections. Tissue was also embedded in paraffin and stained with antimuscle-specific actin (MSA) and polyclonal antibodies to desmin, creatine kinase M subunit (CKM), myoglobin, and neuron-specific enolase (NSE). Antidesmin staining of cryostat sections was the most sensitive indicator of rhabdomyosarcoma (58 of 62 specimens positive). Results with this reagent in alcohol-fixed and formalin-fixed tissue were similar (46 of 56 positive versus 43 of 56 positive, respectively) and comparable with results with anti-MSA in formalin-fixed tissue (43 of 55 positive). However, the proportion of cells stained by antidesmin was higher in alcohol-fixed tissue than in formalin-fixed tissue. Staining with antimyoglobin and anti-CKM was much less satisfactory, with positivity rates of 17 of 37 and 11 of 57, respectively, in formalin-fixed rhabdomyosarcomas. Immunostaining of muscle markers revealed evidence of myogenesis in six undifferentiated sarcomas and in two sarcomas with inadequate histologic study on hematoxylin-eosin-stained sections. However, positivity was also noticed in samples of fibromatosis, Wilms' tumor, ectomesenchyoma, peripheral primitive neuroectodermal tumor, renal rhabdoid tumor, myositis ossificans, malignant fibrous histiocytoma, and embryonal sarcoma of the liver. The authors conclude that combined use of antidesmin and anti-MSA enhances the diagnosis of childhood sarcomas, especially when employed with other techniques such as electron microscopic study. 
Fistulous degeneration of a giant esophageal ulcer in a patient with acquired immune deficiency syndrome. Esophageal involvement in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) disease can take many forms, including the recently described giant solitary ulcerations thought to be due to cytomegalovirus or, more recently, Mycobacterium species. Current experience suggests that steroids may provide symptom relief and healing in selected patients. We report a case of fistulous change in one such ulcer, with documented endoscopic, radiologic, and pathologic findings. No organism was identified by culture or pathologic staining, leading to a postulated role for the persistent irritation of medications. 
Angiotensin II receptor antagonist markedly reduces mortality in salt-loaded Dahl S rats. We investigated the effect of blockade of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) on morbidity and hypertension in salt-loaded Dahl salt-sensitive (Dahl S) rats. Six-week-old male Dahl S rats (n = 198) were fed a high sodium diet (8% NaCl) for 10 weeks. One group of rats (n = 91) was treated with 30 mg/kg/day of the nonpeptide angiotensin II receptor antagonist, DuP 753, whereas the control group (n = 107) was left untreated. Blood pressure rose steeply in both groups, reaching levels above 200 mm Hg by week 6. DuP 753-treated animals were less hypertensive than controls between weeks 3 and 5 of the study, but had similar blood pressure before and after that time. Although the angiotensin II antagonist had only a transient effect on blood pressure it markedly prolonged survival. After 10 weeks, 68.3% of rats receiving DuP 753, but only 30.1% of controls, were still alive (P less than .0001). Higher morbidity in controls than in DuP 753-treated rats was also suggested by body weights. Following 6 weeks of high salt diet, untreated rats progressively lost weight while DuP 753-treated animals maintained a steady body weight. These results show that the angiotensin II receptor antagonist DuP 753 greatly enhanced survival in salt-loaded Dahl S rats although it reduced blood pressure only transiently. Our data are consistent with a contribution of the RAS to morbidity in this model of hypertension. 
Epithelial-myoepithelial carcinoma of salivary glands. Four cases of epithelial-myoepithelial carcinoma of the salivary glands arose as painless masses in patients over 60 years old, three in the parotid and one in the submandibular gland. Histologically, all the tumours were composed of small ducts with a double cell lining surrounded by a basement membrane. The inner cells were epithelial and the outer cells myoepithelial, the latter usually possessing clear cytoplasm. There was a variable degree of intervening hyalinised stroma. All the tumours were partly encapsulated, but also displayed local invasiveness. One of the tumours also showed areas of dedifferentiation when it later recurred and metastasised. The other three were apparently cured by initial excision, with adjuvant radiotherapy in one instance. In the past this tumour has been described as clear cell adenoma, and it was only recently that its true malignant nature, albeit low grade, was recognised. Reports of epithelial-myoepithelial carcinoma are still relatively few, with only one case described from Britain. It is recommended that this histologically distinct neoplasm deserves wider recognition. 
Vascular rehabilitation: benefits of a structured exercise/risk modification program. A vascular rehabilitation program was designed to increase exercise tolerance and reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease in patients with lower extremity arterial occlusive disease. Sixty-eight patients (32 men, 36 women); ages 55 to 85 years (mean, 68 years) with claudication 30 (44%), or recovering from lower extremity revascularization 36 (53%), or endovascular procedures 2 (3%) entered the vascular rehabilitation program. Each underwent a physical examination, risk factor assessment, noninvasive arterial studies, and cardiac evaluation. A history was taken from each patient also. Six patients (9%) were excluded on recognition of silent myocardial ischemia. Sixty-two patients (91%) were accepted for exercise training in a program designed to offer 24 (1-hour) monitored exercise sessions, 12 (1-hour) personalized education lectures, and development of a home maintenance exercise program. No deaths or major morbidity occurred. Seventeen patients (27%) did not finish the program, eight (13%) because of development of significant cardiac, extremity, or cerebrovascular disease and nine for nonmedical reasons. Of the 45 patients (73%) who completed the program, 38 (88%) had documented increases in walking distances of greater than 100% (122% to 450%). All 45 patients designed home exercise programs, and 88% of the smokers quit. Long-term follow-up was available on 100% of the patients. Thirty-eight patients (84%) have been followed for 2 years or more. Thirty-eight (84%) maintained or improved walking distances recorded on exit from the program. Thirty of the 36 patients (83%) who stopped smoking remained nonsmokers. Significant reductions in cholesterol were seen at 1 year, and significant reductions in triglycerides were seen at 12 weeks and 1 year. 
Are history and physical examination a good screening test for sleep apnea? OBJECTIVE: To determine whether presenting clinical history, pharyngeal examination, and the overall subjective impression of the clinician could serve as a sensitive screening test for sleep apnea. DESIGN: Blinded comparison of history and physical examination with results of nocturnal polysomnography. SETTING: Sleep clinic of a tertiary referral center. PATIENTS: A total of 410 patients referred for suspected sleep apnea syndrome. Most patients reported snoring. MEASUREMENTS: All patients were asked standard questions and given an examination relevant to the diagnosis of the sleep apnea syndrome, and all had full nocturnal polysomnography. Patients with more than ten episodes of apnea or hypopnea per hour of sleep were classified as having sleep apnea. Stepwise linear logistic regression was used to develop two predictive models of sleep apnea: one based on the presence of characteristic clinical features, age, sex, and body mass index; and one based on subjective clinical impression. RESULTS: The prevalence of sleep apnea in our patients was 46%. Only age, body mass index, male sex, and snoring were found to be predictors of sleep apnea. The logistic rule discriminated between patients with and without sleep apnea (receiver operating characteristic [ROC] area, 0.77 [95% Cl, 0.73 to 0.82]). For patients with a predicted probability of apnea of less than 20%, the clinical model had 94% sensitivity and 28% specificity. Subjective impression alone identified correctly only 52% of patients with sleep apnea and had a specificity of 70%. CONCLUSIONS: In patients with a high predicted probability of the sleep apnea syndrome, subjective impression alone or any combination of clinical features cannot serve as a reliable screening test. However, in patients with a low predicted probability of sleep apnea, the model based on clinical data was sufficiently sensitive to permit about a 30% reduction in the number of unnecessary sleep studies. 
Overview: diagnosis of ischemic heart disease by noninvasive techniques. Noninvasive tests have greatly improved in their ability to diagnose coronary artery disease. In addition, new testing modalities have been added to our armamentarium. However, no test is clearly superior to all others in every clinical circumstance. Moreover, none have been shown to provide sensitivities and specificities consistently above 90%. Therefore, their use for diagnostic purposes in populations with a lower prevalence of disease is only of moderate value. Conversely, for the assessment of the functional significance of coronary artery disease or prognosis in patients with ischemic heart disease, the addition of noninvasive imaging modalities to exercise testing is of high value. 
Screening of gene deletions by polymerase chain reaction in Japanese patients with Duchenne muscular dystrophy. Gene deletions were screened in 49 Japanese Duchenne muscular dystrophy patients from 43 families, using the polymerase chain reaction. Enzymatic amplification was carried out on six regions prone to deletion. Fifteen of 43 families (33%) had gene deletions in at least one of the six regions. This frequency was almost the same as that previously reported in Caucasians. The mid-part of the dystrophin gene was the location most frequently deleted. The frequency of deletion of the region encompassing exon 45 was higher in Japanese families (18.4%) than in Caucasians. 
Unexplained displacement of ipsilateral ovary and fallopian tube. During routine laparoscopy, the right fallopian tube and ovary were noted to be displaced. Ovarian and fallopian tube tissue were found on biopsy of adjacent omentum. The most probable cause is asymptomatic torsion of the right adnexum; therefore, evaluation of the renal system with intravenous pyelogram is probably not necessary. 
Choledochoduodenostomy. Analysis of 71 cases followed for 5 to 15 years. To investigate the long-term effectiveness of choledochoduodenostomy (CDD), the experience with 71 patients followed for 5 or more years after CDD was analyzed retrospectively. From 1968 to 1984, 134 patients underwent CDD. Eight patients (6%) died in the immediate postoperative period, 55 left the hospital, 8 of them were lost to follow-up, and 47 were followed but died before 5 years elapsed after CDD. The remaining 71 patients form the data base for this analysis: 38 were followed for more than 5 years, 25 were followed for more than 10 years, and 8 were followed for more than 15 years (mean 12.1 years +/- 1.3 SEM). Choledocholithiasis, chronic pancreatitis, and postoperative stricture were the indications for CDD. Cholangitis was observed in only three patients. The diameter of the common bile duct (CBD) was large in most patients (mean 18 mm +/- 0.9 SEM). These results infer that CDD is effective to treat non-neoplastic obstructing lesions of the distal CBD on a long-term basis and that the presence of a dilated CBD (more than 16 mm) that allows the construction of a CDD more than 14 mm is essential to obtain good results. 
Hemodynamic and metabolic effects of venoarterial cardiopulmonary support in coronary artery disease. Coronary angioplasty was performed on 14 high-risk patients supported with venoarterial partial cardiopulmonary bypass. Hemodynamic, metabolic and physiologic parameters were monitored to assess the effect of cardiopulmonary support in conscious patients. Cardiopulmonary support caused a decrease in systolic (45 +/- 17 to 27 +/- 14 mm Hg, p less than 0.001), diastolic (23 +/- 12 to 14 +/- 8 mm Hg, p less than 0.005) and mean (29.7 +/- 13.2 to 18 +/- 9 mm Hg, p less than 0.001) pulmonary artery pressures. Aortic systolic (129 +/- 18 to 106 +/- 17 mm Hg, p less than 0.001), mean (89 +/- 19 to 84 +/- 19 mm Hg, p less than 0.05) and pulse (64 +/- 17 to 37 +/- 16 mm Hg, p less than 0.00001) pressures also decreased. Heart rate and aortic diastolic pressures were unchanged. End-systolic wall stress (122 +/- 48 x 10(3) to 96 +/- 44 x 10(3) dynes/cm2, p less than 0.001) and left ventricular end-diastolic diameter (5.7 +/- 0.8 to 5.5 +/- 0.9 cm, p less than 0.05) were reduced during partial cardiopulmonary bypass. After initiation of cardiopulmonary support, normal lactate extraction across the coronary circulation was diminished or converted to lactate production (38 +/- 23 to 2 +/- 29%, p less than 0.005). There was a marked reduction in hematocrit (41 +/- 4 to 28 +/- 5%, p less than 0.0001) and platelet count (259,000 +/- 57,600/ml to 145,900 +/- 46,000/ml, p less than 0.0001) after bypass. Cardiopulmonary bypass successfully supported all patients during balloon inflation, for an optimal angioplasty result. 
Management of hypertensive crises. The availability of potent antihypertensive drugs that will decrease markedly elevated blood pressure within minutes to hours has changed the concepts of definition and therapy of hypertensive emergencies and urgencies. Intravenous infusion of sodium nitroprusside can be used in the truly emergent situation and is effective, reliable, and safe. While oral therapy is more convenient, it is not as consistently effective as parenteral administration and can lead to excessive reductions in blood pressure that are more difficult to manage than when short-acting agents are given intravenously. 
Cytomegalovirus ileitis presenting as massive rectal bleeding in infancy. Two Zambian infants presented with massive rectal bleeding caused by cytomegalovirus ileitis. The first was seropositive for HIV and the second seronegative, though her mother was seropositive. Both infants died. 
Mefloquine-resistant falciparum malaria on the Thai-Burmese border Mefloquine is the treatment of choice for uncomplicated multiresistant falciparum malaria, and in combination with sulphadoxine and pyrimethamine (MSP) at a single dose of 15/30/1.5 mg/kg, respectively, has been used in Thailand for the past 6 years. In 1985-86, MSP cured over 98% of 5192 patients with falciparum malaria on the Thai-Burmese border. 4 years later we studied the efficacy of MSP in 395 patients at the same location. The cure rate at 28 days was 70.8% (95% Cl 67-77.2%). The proportion of early treatment failures (in whom parasitaemia did not clear) had risen from 0.27 to 3.7% (p less than 0.0001). Failure rates were 50% in children under 6 years old, 29% in the 6-15 age group, and 19% in adults (p less than 0.001). Patients with early treatment failure were retreated with 25 mg/kg mefloquine, but 27% had a further recrudescence of infection within 28 days. The mean (95% Cl) serum mefloquine concentration at the time of first recrudescence was 638 (546-730) ng/ml, a value previously associated with successful treatment. Mefloquine concentrations were no lower in those with recrudescent infections than in age-matched successfully treated patients, suggesting that pharmacokinetic factors were not responsible for the high treatment-failure rate. Plasmodium falciparum has developed resistance to mefloquine rapidly, despite the addition of sulphadoxine and pyrimethamine and strict control of drug administration. The MSP combination should now be abandoned. 
EPA in the prevention of restenosis post PTCA. The effect of fish oil on restenosis was evaluated in patients undergoing coronary balloon angioplasty. In addition to routine pharmacotherapy, subjects were given 2.8 g of eicosapentanoic acid (EPA) daily. Treatment was started within twenty-four hours after successful percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA). After six months of therapy, participants were subjected to coronary arteriography, exercise scintigraphy, exercise electrocardiography, or clinical evaluation. Follow-up evaluation involved 97 coronary lesions in 85 patients. Partial or significant restenosis occurred in 36.5% of patients and 33% of vessels. The presence of severe stenosis before PTCA, dissection, thrombus, multilesion PTCA, and template bleeding time values were not correlated with restenosis. Dilation of the left anterior descending (LAD) and a residual stenosis greater than or equal to 35% were associated with restenosis. Approximately 20% of the patients related difficulty in taking the fish oil. Furthermore, these results show no advantage over expected restenosis rates. 
Regional three-dimensional geometry and function of left ventricles with fibrous aneurysms. A cine-computed tomography study. BACKGROUND. To assess the extent and nature of the dysfunction surrounding aneurysms of the left ventricle (LV), we examined the parameters of local and global three-dimensional shape, size, and function of LVs of eight patients with histologically confirmed anterior fibrous aneurysms. METHODS AND RESULTS. Three-dimensional reconstructions of each LV were made from 10-12 short-axis fast cine-angiographic computed tomography (cine-CT) slices encompassing the entire heart at end diastole and end systole. Regional three-dimensional wall thickness, thickening, motion, curvature, and stress index were calculated for 84 elements encompassing the entire LV. The aneurysmal border was defined by a sharp decrease in end-diastolic wall thickness and separated the LV into an aneurysmal zone and a normal zone that was further divided into adjacent normal (AN) and remote normal (RN) zones. As expected, thickening was negligible in both the aneurysmal and the border zones. Although both the AN and the RN zones had normal wall thickness (1.05 +/- 0.20 and 1.09 +/- 0.20 cm, respectively), thickening was depressed in the AN (0.22 +/- 0.08 cm) but not the RN (0.44 +/- 0.19 cm) zones. The size of the dysfunction zone (defined as less than 2 mm thickening) was found to be considerably greater than the anatomic size of the aneurysm (60.9 +/- 13.7% versus 33.6 +/- 7.6% of the left ventricular endocardial area, respectively; p less than 0.001). In addition, the AN zone had a smaller curvature and a higher stress index than the RN zone. CONCLUSIONS. LVs with fibrous aneurysms are characterized by a relatively large region of nonfunction that encompasses the thin aneurysmal area and its transitional border zone, a normally functioning remote zone, and an intermediate region of normal wall thickness but with reduced function, which may be attributed to its low curvature and high stress index. 
Delayed postanoxic encephalopathy after strangulation. Serial neuroradiological and neurochemical studies. A 13-year-old boy was the victim of attempted strangulation. His condition had returned to normal by the sixth day after the assault; however, from the seventh day, choreoathetosis, dystonia, and marked pseudobulbar paralysis developed in the boy. The computed tomographic scans and T2-weighted magnetic resonance images that were obtained at this time revealed low-density and high-signal intensities in the region of the bilateral putamen and caudate nucleus. These symptoms and the changes in his computed tomographic scans and magnetic resonance images subsided gradually during a 2-month period. Sequential analysis of the cerebrospinal fluid for gamma-aminobutyric acid and dopamine concentrations during his illness revealed reciprocal changes with normal recovery. Because of the delayed onset of neurological changes and the cerebrospinal fluid showing reversible symptoms, the delayed encephalopathy after strangulation had been related to the biochemical alterations that followed anoxia in the vulnerable basal ganglia. 
The relationship between intelligence and memory following minor or mild closed head injury: greater impairment in memory than intelligence. This study investigated the performance of patients with minor or mild closed head injury and age/education-matched normal controls on the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale-Revised (WAIS-R) and the Wechsler Memory Scale-Revised (WMS-R). The results demonstrated that the control group had significantly higher scores than the patients with closed head injury on all WAIS-R and WMS-R index scores. Further analysis revealed that the patients with closed head injury showed a greater impairment in delayed memory when directly compared to intellectual performance that was not seen in the control group. These results are discussed in relation to findings in patients with more severe closed head injury, the construction of the WAIS-R and the WMS-R, and the performance patterns of the two groups. 
Correction of non-24-hour sleep/wake cycle by melatonin in a blind retarded boy. A 9-year-old, blind boy with severe mental retardation with a chronic sleep/wake disturbance had a circadian rhythm of 24.75 hours and an internal desynchronization of the endogenous rhythms. Treatment with oral melatonin given at 6 PM induced a regular sleep/wake pattern. Melatonin, in this patient, convincingly entrained the endogenous rhythm to the appropriate chronological 24-hour day. 
Escherichia coli bacteremia in children. A review of 91 cases in 10 years. We reviewed 91 cases of pediatric Escherichia coli bacteremia during a 10-year period. Thirty one patients were afebrile; a significantly greater proportion of these patients were aged less than 1 month, had ampicillin-resistant E coli isolates, or had persistent bacteremia 24 hours after initiating antibiotic therapy. Infection was community acquired in 65 cases; associated urinary tract infection was six times more common in this setting than in nosocomially acquired infections. In 85 cases at least 1 underlying medical condition/focus of infection was identified at the time the positive blood culture was obtained, the most common were immune deficiency states (38 cases), urinary tract infection (29 cases), and lesions of the gastrointestinal tract (27 cases). Polymicrobial bacteremia occurred in five cases. Twelve patients died; significantly associated with death were hypotension requiring pressor therapy, presence of a central venous catheter, and neutropenia. 
Cocaine-related symptoms in patients presenting to an urban emergency department. STUDY OBJECTIVES: Cocaine abuse is a serious social problem that precipitates a significant number of emergency hospital encounters. To determine the nature of cocaine-related symptoms, we studied patients with cocaine use presenting to all adult services of an urban emergency department. DESIGN: Review of consecutive cases, with analysis of clinical features. SETTING: All adult EDs of an urban teaching hospital. TYPE OF PARTICIPANTS: Patients acknowledging recent use of cocaine (within 72 hours) and/or with cocaine detected on a toxicologic screen. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Psychiatric complaints accounted for 44 (30.6%) presentations, followed by neurologic (17.4%), cardiopulmonary (16%), trauma (11.8%), and addiction-related (11.1%) symptoms. Cardiopulmonary symptoms were more frequently associated with intranasal than with IV or smoked cocaine (P = .003). Suicidal intent was the most common psychiatric reason for presentation, occurring in 24 patients (16.6%). Seventeen presented with trauma, including three involved in motor vehicle accidents. CONCLUSION: Cardiopulmonary symptoms such as chest pain and palpitations may be significantly more frequent in patients who use intranasal cocaine; suicidal intent is common among patients presenting with psychiatric symptoms related to cocaine; and the range of cocaine-related symptoms is varied, including not only psychiatric and cardiopulmonary symptoms but also trauma. 
Surgical versus medical treatment for epilepsy. II. Outcome related to social areas. We conducted a retrospective parallel cohort study comparing surgical and medical treatment for epilepsy. The surgical group contained all 201 patients treated with resective surgery for epilepsy in Norway since the first operation in 1949 until January 1988. The 185 patients in the control group, medically treated only, were closely matched for year of treatment, age at treatment, sex, seizure type, and neurologic deficit before treatment. Between 75 and 95% of the survivors (median 17 years after treatment) completed two questionnaires on their social situation. Although surgical treatment improved the seizure situation (about one-fourth had some neurologic deficit), a considerably smaller long-range influence on different social aspects was observed. There were no significant differences between the two groups in educational status, social pensions, social status, marital status, fertility, dependency in residential situation, the need for aid in daily activities of living (ADL), or the need for being looked after, when we controlled for pretreatment status. In all, 25.3% of the surgically treated patients and 8.5% of the controls were not receiving anti-epileptic drugs (AEDs) at the time of investigation (Mann-Whitney U test, two-tailed p = 0.0011). A considerably higher proportion of the surgically treated (53.2%) than control patients (24.2%) claimed that the treatment had improved their "working ability" (Mann-Whitney U test, two-tailed p less than 0.0001), but this resulted in significant improvements in the actual working situation only for those in regular education or work before treatment (chi 2 = 6.514, p = 0.038). 
Iridium-192 brachytherapy in the treatment of cancer of the prostate. Aggressive radiotherapy was used in 170 patients with advanced localized carcinoma of the prostate. After pelvic lymphadenectomy, 192Ir brachytherapy was used to deliver 3500 cGy to the prostate within 2 days. External-beam therapy (4500 cGy) was then given to a total of 8000 cGy. Random biopsies 18 months afterward were negative for residual cancer in 62 of 83 patients (75%), and 37 of 45 patients (82%) with pathologically proved localized disease remain without evidence of disease. Morbidity was significantly reduced in the most recent 70 patients by improvements in technique. The authors believe such therapy should be considered for patients with advanced stage B2 or C disease in particular. 
Contributions of [Ca2+]i, [Pi]i, and pHi to altered diastolic myocyte tone during partial metabolic inhibition. Ischemia may cause increased or decreased distensibility of the left ventricle, but the cellular mechanisms involved have not been clarified. We examined the possible contributions of changes in intracellular inorganic phosphate, pH, and Ca2+ concentrations to altered diastolic function in cultured myocytes subjected to partial metabolic inhibition. Paced cultured embryonic chick and adult rabbit ventricular myocytes superfused with 20 mM 2-deoxyglucose (2DG) exhibited an increase in end-diastolic intracellular free calcium concentration ([Ca2+]i) and an upward shift in end-diastolic cell position. These results indicate that glycolytic blockade increases diastolic and systolic calcium in paced ventricular myocytes, and that this elevated diastolic calcium influences the extent of diastolic relaxation. In contrast, paced ventricular myocytes superfused with 1 mM cyanide (CN) exhibited a similar increase in end-diastolic [Ca2+]i but a decrease in end-diastolic cell position and amplitude of motion. Although changes in ATP contents were similar in both groups (2DG, -29.9%; CN, -40.1%), alterations of intracellular pH and inorganic phosphate concentrations were different. In 2DG-treated cells, pHi did not decrease significantly (7.18 +/- 0.04 to 7.12 +/- 0.11, n = 14) but in the CN group it decreased markedly within 6 min (7.18 +/- 0.04 to 6.76 +/- 0.11, n = 11, P less than 0.01). Intracellular inorganic phosphate decreased slightly in the 2DG group (-14.8%, NS) but increased in cells exposed to CN (45.7%, P less than 0.02). We conclude that while a prominent increase in diastolic [Ca2+]i occurs in rapidly paced ventricular myocytes exposed to either inhibitors of glycolysis or oxidative phosphorylation, the effects of this increase in [Ca2+]i on diastolic distensibility may be influenced by intracellular accumulation of metabolites that decrease the sensitivity of myofilament to [Ca2+]i. 
Basal temporal language area. Language interference was elicited by electrical stimulation of the dominant basal temporal region in 8 out of 22 cases and in none of 7 cases with subdural electrodes implanted over the nondominant temporal lobe. Language interference was elicited by stimulation of electrodes placed over the fusiform gyrus 3-7 cm from the tip of the temporal lobe. Electrical stimulation of the basal temporal language area produced a global receptive and expressive aphasia with speech arrest at high stimulus intensities. Other higher cortical function, for example copying complex designs or memory of nonverbal information was intact, in spite of the total inability to process verbal information. At lower stimulus intensities partial aphasias with a predominant receptive component occurred. Surgical resection of the basal temporal language area produces no lasting language deficit. 
Vaginal cuff closure at abdominal hysterectomy: comparing sutures with absorbable staples. To compare two methods of vaginal cuff closure during abdominal hysterectomy, 60 patients were randomized to one of two cuff-closure methods. The vaginal cuff was closed with three interrupted 0-Dexon sutures in 30 and with absorbable staples in 30. Both groups were similar with respect to age, gravidity, parity, preoperative indication, hemoglobin, and hematocrit. The operative technique and quantity of irrigation used was standardized. Operative blood loss was calculated by the weight method and an unactivated, medium flat Jackson-Pratt drain was left in place for collecting postoperative cuff cultures at 24 and 48 hours. The mean operative times in the suture group (97.4 minutes) and staple group (93.4 minutes) were not significantly different (P greater than .05). Cuff-closure time was more rapid (P = .0001) in the staple group (5.8 minutes) than in the suture group (9.3 minutes). Intraoperative cultures were positive in eight of 30 suture patients (26.7%) and eight of 30 staple patients (26.7%). Postoperative cultures at either 24 or 48 hours were positive in four women (13.3%) in the suture group and six (20%) in the staple group. Febrile morbidity occurred in six (20%) in each group. Three staple and two suture subjects developed a vaginal cuff abscess or hematoma, one of whom was readmitted to the hospital for intravenous antibiotics and draining of the vaginal cuff abscess. The presence of a positive vaginal cuff culture did not predict clinical outcome. Based on these observations and the increased cost of the stapling device, we conclude that there is no significant clinical advantage of surgical staples over traditional sutures for vaginal cuff closure at abdominal hysterectomy. 
Mechanism of cytolytic T lymphocyte killing of a low class I-expressing tumor. Many tumors have been shown to express minimal levels of class I MHC Ag, which makes them more resistant to recognition and lysis by cytolytic T lymphocytes. Line 1, a BALB/c spontaneous lung carcinoma, normally expresses very low levels of class I Ag, but expression can be increased 50-fold by treatment with agents such as DMSO or IFN-gamma. Because class I Ag serve as restricting elements for cytolytic T cell recognition of tumor Ag, we wished to determine if cytotoxic T lymphocytes could play a role in the immune response to this type of class I low, but inducible, tumor. After immunization in vivo and restimulation of splenic cells in vitro we were able to generate T cell clones that lysed line 1 cells induced to express high levels of class I, but did not lyse uninduced, low class I expressing line 1 cells in short term (6-h) 51Cr release assays. Paradoxically, incubation of the T cells with uninduced class I low line 1 cells for a few days resulted in complete destruction of the tumor cells. We demonstrate that the T cells, stimulated by the tumor cells, produce IFN-gamma, which in turn induces class I expression on the line 1 cells making them susceptible to lysis by the T cell clone. This suggests that a positive feedback reaction can occur in generating a response to this and perhaps other inducible tumor cell lines. 
Inguinal herniorrhaphy. Reduced morbidity by service standardization. To ascertain if service specialization and procedure standardization would improve the complication rate of inguinal herniorrhaphy, the results of all inguinal herniorrhaphies performed during a 3-year period by board-certified general surgeons who also performed a variety of other procedures common to the field of general surgery, assisted by general surgical residents (group B, 390 patients), were compared in the same institution with the results of inguinal herniorrhaphy when performed during 3 years under protocol by a Hernia Service directed by a senior faculty member assisted by junior surgical residents (group C, 442 patients). Group B patients had essentially no follow-up until they reappeared for care at the Hernia Service, whereas patients in group C achieved an 82% 7-year follow-up. The infection and recurrence rates of group C patients (0.45% and 0.9%, respectively) were significantly better than those of group B patients (5.9% and 4.6%, respectively). These results suggest that in our institution, the concentration of patients with hernias in a hernia service, manned by a specialized surgeon, produced better short- and long-term results than those obtained by general surgeons not dedicated to the field of hernia repair. Further studies will be necessary to confirm these findings. 
Haemodynamic effects and outcome analysis of hypotensive extradural anaesthesia in controlled hypertensive patients undergoing total hip arthroplasty. We have examined the safety of induced hypotension produced by extradural anaesthesia in patients with medically controlled hypertension. The haemodynamic response to induced hypotension was assessed in 38 non-hypertensive and 31 controlled hypertensive patients. All received extradural anaesthesia to T4 or above which decreased mean arterial pressure to 52 mm Hg and 55 mm Hg in normotensive and hypertensive patients, respectively. Cardiac output (thermodilution) was maintained by low dose i.v. infusions of adrenaline (1-5 micrograms min-1). No differences in the haemodynamic response to induced hypotension were observed in hypertensive patients. Data were collected also from 987 consecutive patients (353 hypertensive and 634 non-hypertensive) undergoing total hip replacement. Patients with hypertension were significantly older (68 vs 60 yr; P less than 0.001) and had greater ASA ratings (P less than 0.001). The smallest recorded systolic pressures were reduced more in patients with hypertension (57% vs 52%, respectively; P less than 0.001). The mean duration of maintained intraoperative hypotension (100 and 98 min) and estimated intraoperative blood loss (278 vs 281 ml) were similar in each group. After operation, two patients developed myocardial infarctions. None developed acute renal failure or stroke. There were three deaths; one of a patient who had hypertension. This suggests that induced hypotension with extradural anaesthesia is a safe technique for patients with medically controlled hypertension undergoing total hip arthroplasty. 
Electrophysiological findings in localized hypertrophic mononeuropathy. Localized hypertrophic mononeuropathy (LHM) is a rare foccal neuropathy associated with perineurial cell proliferation due to an undefined stimulus. We report a case of LHM involving the proximal ulnar nerve in a 13-year-old boy. Serial clinical and electrophysiological observations were done, including intraoperative recordings directly from the nerve on two occasions. The evolution of abnormalities, as documented by electrophysiological and immunohistochemical studies, is compatible with a process of progressive thinning of myelin sheaths, culminating in axonal degeneration in later stages. Intraoperative recording of nerve action potentials was used to guide surgical management of the lesion. Ultimately, there was a good clinical and electrophysiological response to resection of the lesion and sural nerve fascicular grafting. 
Severe sepsis following extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy. A patient with life-threatening sepsis following extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy (ESWL*) is described. The urosepsis was complicated by meningitis and diffuse metastatic endophthalmitis necessitating enucleation of the right eye. Retinal detachment occurred in the left eye following focal endophthalmitis and the operation yielded a poor functional result. The patient was discharged from the hospital 3 months after the ESWL therapy, free of urinary stones. The etiology, treatment and prophylaxis of this serious problem are discussed. 
A genetic study of idiopathic focal dystonias. A genetic study of idiopathic focal dystonias was undertaken by examining 153 first-degree relatives of 40 index patients with torticollis (14 patients), other focal cranial dystonias (16 patients), and writer's cramp (10 patients). Nine relatives with dystonia were identified in 6 families; 8 of these had symptoms such as clumsiness or tremor, but none were aware of any dystonia. A further 4 relatives, now decreased, were affected by history. Overall, 25% of index patients had relatives with dystonia. The results of segregation analysis suggested the presence of an autosomal dominant gene or genes with reduced penetrance as a common cause for focal dystonia. Segregation ratios were not significantly different from those ratios observed in generalized or segmental dystonia in the United Kingdom, and it is possible that a single autosomal dominant gene mutation is responsible for inherited dystonia in the majority of patients irrespective of distribution or severity. 
Aberrant MT2 positivity distinguishes follicular lymphoma from reactive follicular hyperplasia in B5- and formalin-fixed paraffin sections. Often, it is difficult to distinguish follicular lymphoma from reactive follicular hyperplasia histologically. Immunotypic evidence of monoclonality cannot be demonstrated routinely or reliably in routine paraffin-embedded sections. To determine whether a panel of monoclonal antibodies reactive with lymphoid cells in paraffin-embedded sections might be useful in distinguishing these confusing proliferations, the authors examined 45 follicular lymphomas and 30 follicular hyperplasia with the following antibodies; L26, B2, MT1, MT2, and UCHL-I. All sections were routine paraffin preparations from formalin- or B5-fixed tissue and were immunostained with the avidin-biotin immunoperoxidase technique. Ninety-two percent of the B5-fixed and 77% of the formalin-fixed lymphomas were MT2 positive. None of the reactive hyperplasias stained positively, and none of the other antibodies demonstrated consistent differences between these benign and malignant proliferations. MT2 marks interfollicular T cells and mantle-zone B cells in normal lymph nodes but does not mark normal germinal centers; this staining pattern is retained in reactive hyperplasia. However, paradoxically, in most follicular lymphomas the neoplastic germinal centers show aberrant MT2 positively. The authors conclude that MT2 may be useful in distinguishing follicular lymphoma from follicular hyperplasia in paraffin sections. 
Intracranial, intraaxial, space-occupying lesions in patients with intractable partial seizures: an anatomoclinical, neuropsychological, and surgical correlation. Fifty of approximately 250 patients evaluated for intractable partial seizures were shown to have a space-occupying lesion detected with radiographs and/or neuroimaging. Twenty-eight males and 22 females had a mean age at seizure onset of 13 years and a mean duration of seizures of 11 years. All patients had closed-circuit television with EEG monitoring and complete neurologic and neuropsychological assessment. Findings were correlated with lesion location and surgical data. Twenty-seven lesions (54%) were located in the temporal lobe. Thirty-five lesions (70%) were neoplastic. All patients with temporal lobe lesions had complex partial seizures, as did 74% of patients with extratemporal lesions. A good correlation between clinical seizure characteristics and lesion localization was found with the temporal, occipital, and frontal lesions but not with the parietal lesions. Sixty-six percent of patients had focal interictal EEG findings. Lateralization corresponded to the side of the lesion in 64% and was localized to the region of the lesion in 30%. Lateralized ictal EEGs occurred in 58% of patients, corresponding with the side of the lesion in all but one patient. Abnormal findings on neuropsychological testing were congruent with lesion lateralization in 56% of patients and were localized to the region in 26%. Thirty-nine of 47 patients who underwent a subtotal lobectomy to include the lesion are seizure-free after greater than or equal to 1 year of follow-up, and five others are markedly improved. 
Consequences of ileal pouch-anal anastomosis for Crohn's colitis. Patients with Crohn's colitis are generally not considered candidates for the ileal pouch-anal anastomosis (IPAA) procedure. We reviewed 362 consecutive patients undergoing IPAA and analyzed the outcome of this procedure on 25 patients with a preoperative diagnosis of mucosal ulcerative colitis who were subsequently proven to have Crohn's disease. The mean follow-up was 38.1 months. Sixteen patients have a functioning pouch, seven have required pouch excision, one is diverted, and one has died. Only one of nine patients in whom there was a preoperative clinical feature suggestive of Crohn's disease has a functioning pouch, with complications uniformly occurring within months of ileostomy closure. In contrast, 15 of 16 patients without preoperative features of Crohn's disease have maintained their pouch, generally with good results. These data suggest that patients in whom there is clinical and pathologic evidence of Crohn's disease do very poorly without meaningful symptom-free intervals. However, patients without any clinical features of Crohn's disease, despite a histopathologic diagnosis of Crohn's colitis, have had a good outcome with IPAA thus far. 
Humoral immunodeficiency in T-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia. An immunologic assessment. The humoral antibody immunodeficiency in two patients with T-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia (T-CLL) appeared to be the result of immunoregulatory abnormalities in the leukemic T-cell populations. Both patients had CD4+ CD45R+ "virgin" or suppressor-inducer T-CLL, but Patient 1 had hypogammaglobulinemia and Patient 2, immunoglobulin (Ig) M hypergammaglobulinemia. Although, CD25+ interleukin-2 (IL-2) receptors were present on leukemic T-cells of both patient, OKT9+ (CD71) transferrin receptors and OKT10 (CD38) activation antigens were found only on Patient 2's cells. Highly elevated amounts of IL-2 was secreted from phytohemagglutinin-stimulated and concanavalin A-stimulated T-cells in both patients. In Patient 1 with hypogammaglobulinemia, immune defects involve T-cells, first an intense suppressor activity on B-cell-induced IgM and IgG synthesis and, second, deficient production of B-cell growth factor (BCGF) and B-cell differentiation factor (BCDF). In Patient 2, highly elevated BCGF and IgM-specific BCDF was secreted by T-cells, a mechanism leading to IgM hypergammaglobulinemia in this patient. These studies stress the importance of BCGF and BCDF activity of leukemic T-cells in humoral antibody immunodeficiency disorders in T-CLL cases. 
Prospective study of the complications of endoscopic laryngeal surgery. Patients undergoing 204 endoscopic laryngeal operations were studied prospectively to determine the incidence of complications. Twelve patients were considered to be at high risk of postoperative airway obstruction. Two of these patients had an elective tracheostomy. One required temporary reintubation in the recovery room. No case of respiratory obstruction occurred in a patient not considered to be in the high risk group. Mucosal haemorrhage or oedema was seen on postoperative indirect laryngoscopy in 31 per cent of patients. The commonest abnormality found was mucosal haemorrhage in the oropharynx. 
Anterior innominate osteotomies for failure or late closure of bladder exstrophy. The bony pelvis was analyzed in 12 patients undergoing a further operation after initial bladder closure. Of the patients 5 had undergone a prior posterior osteotomy. All patients had wide diastasis of the pubis (average 5.5 cm.). In 9 of these patients late closure or reclosure of a failed initial bladder repair was done and 3 underwent a repeat bladder neck reconstruction. In all patients a new procedure, anterior iliac osteotomy with internal or external fixation, was performed. This procedure provides increased mobility of the pubis and increased correction. It avoids turning of the patient while under anesthesia for repeat preparation and in most cases postoperative traction is not needed. There were no instances of dehiscence, nonunion or infection. Three cases of transient femoral palsy were noted. All patients had a normal gait 4 months postoperatively. The mobility obtained after anterior osteotomy allows for excellent approximation. In view of evidence that approximation of the pubis improves closure and eventual continence results, we believe that osteotomies, even when repeated, are useful in revision surgery if there is bony diastasis. 
Chronic morphine therapy for cancer pain: plasma and cerebrospinal fluid morphine and morphine-6-glucuronide concentrations. Morphine-6-glucuronide (M-6-G) is an active metabolite that may contribute to the clinical effects produced by systemic administration of morphine. To help clarify the extent to which M-6-G may cross the blood-brain barrier and exert effects, we employed high-performance liquid chromatography with electrochemical detection to measure the concentrations of M-6-G and morphine in the plasma and either ventricular (three patients) or lumbar (eight patients) CSF of cancer patients receiving chronic morphine therapy. The mean ratio of morphine in ventricular CSF:morphine in plasma was 0.71; the same ratio for M-6-G was only 0.077. The average molar ratio of M-6-G: morphine in ventricular CSF was 0.207, and the average molar ratio in plasma was 1.89. Although sampling problems render the lumbar CSF results less reliable, they were very similar. Thus, plasma contained approximately twice as much M-6-G as morphine, whereas CSF contained only one-fifth to one-third as much. These data confirm that M-6-G in plasma is distributed into CSF, but to a far lesser extent than morphine. They help explain animal data demonstrating much higher potency of M-6-G on administration into CSF than systemic administration and indicate that the degree to which M-6-G contributes to morphine effects in humans remains an unresolved question. 
Identification and mapping to chromosome 1 of a susceptibility locus for periinsulitis in non-obese diabetic mice. Insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM) is a polygenic disease caused by autoimmune destruction of insulin-producing beta cells in the islets of Langerhans. Its onset is preceded by a long and variable period in which lymphoid cells infiltrate the pancreas but first remain outside the islets (peri-insulitis) before invading them (insulitis). Among susceptibility loci, only the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) has been clearly assigned. Genetic study of the nonobese diabetic (NOD) mouse model for insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus has revealed genetic linkage of insulitis and of early onset diabetes with two non-MHC loci mapping to chromosome 3 and 11 respectively. Here we report a close association of periinsulitis with a third non-MHC locus mapping to chromosome 1. Successive stages in the progression of diabetic disease thus appear to be controlled by distinct genes or sets of genes. 
Site-dependent postmortem changes in blood cocaine concentrations. When a forensic toxicologist interprets postmortem blood cocaine findings he usually must make assumptions regarding perimortem drug concentrations. In-vitro studies have shown that cocaine rapidly hydrolyzes in unpreserved blood, particularly at elevated temperatures. However, other studies have demonstrated site-dependent postmortem release of some drugs from tissue stores accompanied by increases in drug concentrations in the blood. This study was undertaken to investigate whether blood cocaine concentrations change in the body during the postmortem interval and, if so, to measure the direction and magnitude of the changes. In medical examiner cases in which scene investigation suggested that the decreased was a cocaine user, blood samples were collected as soon after death as possible. At autopsy, a second set of samples was collected. Analysis of paired samples by gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS) revealed dramatic differences in the cocaine concentration. The magnitude and direction of the change appears to be site dependent. Usually, but not invariably, cocaine concentration in subclavian vein blood decreases while that in heart, aorta, and femoral vein blood increases during the interval between death and autopsy. The findings emphasize the danger inherent in attempting to estimate the concentration of cocaine in blood at the time of death from postmortem data. 
Changes in the central ANF-system of renovascular hypertensive rats. The central atrial natriuretic peptides (ANF)-system was investigated in volume-dependent, one-kidney, one-clip (1K1C) and renin-dependent two-kidney, one-clip (2K1C) renovascular hypertensive rats by radioimmunological measurement of ANF concentration in 18 selected brain areas. Significant changes were found in nine brain areas of 1K1C and in eight brain areas of 2K1C hypertensive rats. Except undirectional changes in the organum vasculosum laminae terminalis and the supraoptic nucleus, ANF concentration was changed in the opposite direction in all other brain areas, with an activation of the central ANF system in 1K1C and an inhibition in 2K1C hypertension. The localization of the alterations (circumventricular organs, anteroventral third ventricle region, hypothalamo hypophyseal system, brain stem) implies major differences in the central regulation of blood pressure and electrolyte and fluid homeostasis between these two models. The activation of the central ANF system in 1K1C hypertension may be a compensatory mechanism to prevent further increments in blood pressure and plasma volume. In contrast, the depression of the central ANF system in 2K1C hypertension may promote the elevation of the blood pressure. 
Cystic adrenal masses in the neonate associated with hemihypertrophy and the relation to the Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome. We report 2 cases of unilateral, multilocular, cystic adrenal masses in neonates. Both patients demonstrated somatic hemihypertrophy, which is considered to have the same implications as the Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome in terms of tumor risk. Pathological examination showed multiple, adrenal cysts without evidence of tumor or routine adrenal hemorrhage. This finding appears to represent a previously unreported association between the spectrum of hemihypertrophy/Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome and benign cystic adrenal disease. 
Combined thoracic aortic dissection and abdominal aortic fusiform aneurysm. Certain clinical and autopsy findings are described in 13 patients who had both aortic dissection (AD) and fusiform abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA). All 13 patients had severe and extensive aortic atherosclerosis. The AAA was diagnosed clinically in 9 patients, and 5 had the AAA resected. The AD was diagnosed clinically in 5 patients, and 2 underwent attempted operative repair. Two patients who had the AAA resected because of suspected rupture were found later to have ruptured a more proximal AD. Thus, AD occurs occasionally in patients who have AAA. In older persons with suspected rupture of an AAA, a more proximal rupture of an AD should be ruled out. When both AAA and AD are present in the same patient, the AD is more likely the cause of cardiovascular collapse than is rupture of the AAA. 
Ureteral pseudodiverticula: frequent association with uroepithelial malignancy. Ureteral pseudodiverticula are tiny outpouchings usually seen as incidental findings on retrograde urography during routine work-up for common urinary tract disorders. We report 37 patients with ureteral pseudodiverticula, of whom 17 (46%) had associated uroepithelial malignancy. Ureteral pseudodiverticula were diagnosed in all patients on excretory or retrograde urography as an incidental finding during evaluation for a variety of urologic symptoms and signs. All patients were assessed with urinalysis, urine culture, cystoscopy, and when indicated, ureteroscopy. Diagnosis of transitional cell carcinoma was made by surgery or endoscopic biopsy in 16 patients and squamous cell carcinoma in one. In nine patients with radiographs showing ureteral pseudodiverticula and a urinary tract filling defect (usually in the bladder), 78% of the cases were proved malignant. In six patients with ureteral pseudodiverticula and a stricture in the ureter or renal collecting system, 67% of the cases were proved malignant. Of the patients with tumor, 53% had a single ureteral pseudodiverticulum. In two cases, the pseudodiverticula antedated the diagnosis of malignancy by 2 and 4 years, respectively. Our experience suggests that the association between ureteral pseudodiverticula and uroepithelial malignancy may be more common than previously assumed, approaching 50%. Even a single ureteral pseudodiverticulum should be regarded as a serious marker for potential malignancy, antedating cancer by 2-10 years, and such patients should be closely followed up. The coexistence of ureteral pseudodiverticula and a stricture or filling defect in the urinary tract is highly suggestive that a tumor is present. 
Pregnancy outcome in an active-duty population. The number of women in the military has grown since the initiation of the all-volunteer force. Pregnancy is no longer a justification for discharge from active service. Previously published reports have shown that active military service is associated with poor pregnancy outcomes. We compared a group of active-duty pregnant women (N = 331) matched for age and gravidity with a control group of dependent wives of active-duty personnel (N = 1218). Study variables examined were the incidences of cesarean and operative vaginal delivery, Apgar scores of less than 7 at 5 minutes, preterm complications (preterm labor and premature rupture of membranes) requiring transfer to a tertiary care center, pregnancy-induced hypertensive syndromes, intrauterine growth retardation (IUGR) (infant weight less than 2500 g), and pregnancy-related complications. In the active-duty group, the rates of primary cesarean (P less than .001), transfer for preterm complications (P less than .0001), pregnancy-induced hypertensive syndromes (P less than .01), and IUGR (P less than .05) were greater than in the control group. Active-duty servicewomen, despite defined limitations of work and ready access to health care, continue to represent a high-risk population. 
Variability of body weight and health outcomes in the Framingham population BACKGROUND. Fluctuation in body weight is a common phenomenon, due in part to the high prevalence of dieting. In this study we examined the associations between variability in body weight and health end points in subjects participating in the Framingham Heart Study, which involves follow-up examinations every two years after entry. METHODS. The degree of variability of body weight was expressed as the coefficient of variation of each subject's measured body-mass-index values at the first eight biennial examinations during the study and on their recalled weight at 25 years of age. Using the 32-year follow-up data, we analyzed total mortality, mortality from coronary heart disease, and morbidity due to coronary heart disease and cancer in relation to intraindividual variation in body weight, including only end points that occurred after the 10th biennial examination. We used age-adjusted proportional-hazards regression for the data analysis. RESULTS. Subjects with highly variable body weights had increased total mortality (P = 0.005 for men, P = 0.01 for women), mortality from coronary heart disease (P = 0.009 for men, P = 0.009 for women), and morbidity due to coronary heart disease (P = 0.0009 for men, P = 0.006 for women). Using a multivariate analysis that also controlled for obesity, trends in weight over time, and five indicators of cardiovascular risk, we found that the positive associations between fluctuations in body weight and end points related to mortality and coronary heart disease could not be attributed to these potential confounding factors. The relative risks of these end points in subjects whose weight varied substantially, as compared with those whose weight was relatively stable, ranged from 1.27 to 1.93. CONCLUSIONS. Fluctuations in body weight may have negative health consequences, independent of obesity and the trend of body weight over time. 
Effects of rapid volume expansion on the right filling pressures after prosthetic valve surgery. The effects of rapid intravascular volume expansion were studied in 12 patients, 4 to 14 years after single prosthetic heart valve replacement. The data observed showed a statistically significant mean difference before and after volume expansion of right atrial mean pressure and right ventricular end diastolic and pulmonary capillary pressures. However, right atrial and pulmonary capillary pressures equilibration was not detected. The right atrial pressure form showed abnormal variations during inspiration. Dip and plateau right ventricular diastolic pressure configuration was recorded in 6 patients after expansion, was absent in 2 and questionable in 4. A deep Y descent with an M-shaped right atrial pressure form was recorded in all 12 patients. The explanation for these phenomena is unclear. Thus, in the absence of pressure equilibration and clinical evidence of constriction, the abnormalities recorded during rapid volume expansion should be cautiously interpreted. 
Mycosis fungoides metastatic to the orbit. We report a case of mycosis fungoides metastatic to the anterior orbit in an 83-year-old woman. The patient had a history of several years' duration of well-controlled primary mycosis fungoides with localized dermatologic T-cell lymphomas, mainly on the lower extremities. She developed gradual proptosis, hyperophthalmos, and vertical diplopia. Computed tomography demonstrated a solid, extraconal mass in the right lower anterior orbit. Biopsy revealed a gristly, yellowish, infiltrating mass at the level of the inferior orbital septum. Pathologic examination revealed anaplastic T lymphocytes with multiloculated, cerebriform nuclei that matched those of the primary mycosis fungoides skin tumors. Mycosis fungoides rarely spreads to the ocular and periocular structures, and this case was unique in that it presented as a pure orbital lesion with sparing of the overlying lids and adnexal structures. 
Left main coronary artery and femoral artery vasospasm associated with cocaine use. A woman had diffuse vascular spasm related to cocaine use. She presented with evidence of an acute anterior myocardial infarction but had no rise in creatinine phosphokinase levels. Cardiac catheterization showed 90 percent proximal left main coronary artery narrowing. The catheterization was complicated by right femoral artery spasm. A repeat catheterization after treatment with nitroglycerin and diltiazem showed 30 percent proximal left main coronary artery narrowing. This catheterization was complicated by left femoral artery spasm. An exercise treadmill test was negative for ischemia. 
Adrenal cortical carcinoma: flow cytometric study of 22 cases, an ECOG study. Flow cytometric studies of archival material from 22 adrenal carcinomas demonstrated aneuploidy in 21 of 22 cases. Heterogeneity of nuclear DNA was found in 14 of the 22 cases. Eight of these showed distinct aneuploid and diploid populations, and 6 showed multiple aneuploid cell lines. The heterogeneity was detected because numerous paraffin-embedded samples of each tumor could be examined. No correlation was found between either aneuploidy or heterogeneous DNA content and patient survival, response to therapy, or hormone secretion. 
Tissue plasminogen activator for the treatment of thromboembolism in infants and children. We report our experience with the use of tissue plasminogen activator to treat 12 infants and children with various thromboembolic states after conventional thrombolytic agents had failed. The dosage range was between 0.1 to 0.5 mg/kg per hour. Complete clot dissolution occurred in seven cases after 2 hours to 3 days of therapy. Partial clot dissolution and clinical improvement were noted in another four patients. Bleeding complications were noted in 6 of the 12 patients and included bruising, oozing from various venipuncture sites, and bleeding; these complications were controlled by clinically available means. In all cases with bleeding the dose rate was in the higher range (0.46 to 0.50 mg/kg per hour). In one patient, restlessness, agitation, and screaming were noted during administration of tissue plasminogen activator and when it was reinstituted. We conclude that tissue plasminogen activator is effective in inducing clot lysis in children. Because the effective dose appears to overlap with those causing bleeding, we recommend that a dose of 0.1 mg/kg per hour be started and increased gradually if clot dissolution does not occur, with close monitoring for bleeding. 
Radiology of continent urinary diversion. The continent urinary diversions described in this article represent only a small number of the techniques that have been reported in the urologic literature. An attempt has been made to discuss diversions that are currently in common use or have been recently described and hold potential for becoming more widely accepted. The radiologist with a basic understanding of continent urinary diversions plays an important role in evaluating patients who have had these procedures. Complications can be detected and evaluated and occasionally treated with interventional techniques. As continent urinary diversions become more frequently performed, it is important that radiologists become aware of their construction techniques, radiographic appearance, function, and potential complications. 
A "twilight period" of coronary perfusion: the risk of intraoperative infarction in surgery for main left coronary obstruction. This study investigates the significance of an intraoperative period of low coronary perfusion pressure which may lead to ischemia, infarction, or both, in patients undergoing coronary bypass surgery for tight left main obstruction. "Twilight Period" (TP) was defined as the time interval from initiation of cardiopulmonary bypass to implementation of cold cardioplegia. Fifty-four patients with main left coronary obstruction (greater than 50%) were divided in three groups: Group I (20), TP less than 5 minutes; Group II (15), TP = 5-15 minutes; and Group III (19), TP greater than 15 minutes. Monitoring parameters included: systemic perfusion pressure during TP, perfusion flows, length of TP, time of ischemia, myocardial temperatures during ischemia, postoperative CK-MB level, EKG-detectable infarction, and postoperative therapeutic support requirements. Results: Intraoperative myocardial infarction by EKG was 0% in Group I, 7% in Group II, and 26.3% in Group III; mortality was 0%, 0%, and 15.7%, respectively. CK-MB values were 18 +/- 3.2 IU, Group I; 18.3 +/- 2.5 IU, Group II; and 49.4 +/- 10.3 IU, Group III. Group I vs. III: P 0.01. Levels of postoperative support: Level A, less than 12 hours; Level B, 12-36 hours; and Level C, greater than 36 hours. Intra-aortic balloon pump (IABP) was considered Level C. In Group I, 75% (15/20) fell in Level A; 15% (3/20) in Level B and 10% (2/20) in Level C. In Group II, 60% (9/15) fell in Level A; 26.7% (4/15) in Level B; and 13% (2/15) in Level C. In Group III, 36.8% (7/19) fell in Level A; 15.8% (3/19) in Level B; and 47.4% (9/19) in Level C. 
The gastropulmonary route of infection--fact or fiction? Published studies relating to whether medicinal stress-bleeding prophylaxis leading to an increase of gastric pH favors the development of bronchopulmonary infections are reviewed. Results from studies in healthy humans, patients with ulcer disease, and patients in the intensive care unit (ICU) clearly show that the risk of gastric bacterial colonization significantly increases relative to increasing gastric pH. Moreover, a drug-induced increase of gastric pH leads directly to gastric bacterial colonization also in patients in the ICU, above all with bacteria typical of the gastrointestinal tract. Comparing the different bacterial spectra of the oropharynx, stomach, and upper small intestine, it becomes clear that the stomach is a reservoir of bacteria independent of the oropharynx and also subject to retrograde colonization due to the duodenogastric reflux. Both by means of microbiological and in particular direct detection procedures, it can be demonstrated that in at least 30-40% of intubated patients a gastropulmonary route of colonization occurs. In patient groups without a medication-induced increase of gastric pH the number of bacteria detected in the tracheal secretion is about 33% less than in the case of conventional stress-bleeding prophylaxis. These findings make it understandable that a highly significant increase in the pneumonia rate is seen in patients receiving pH-increasing stress-bleeding prophylaxis versus control groups without therapy essentially influencing gastric pH. A risk score was developed that allows an easy description of those patients who are at an increased risk of pulmonary infections due to the gastropulmonary route of colonization. 
Acute idiopathic blind spot enlargement. A spectrum of disease. The authors present a report on their experience with 10 patients with acute idiopathic blind spot enlargement. All had enlarged steep-margined blind spots without accompanying changes in optic disc appearance, significantly diminished visual acuity or color vision. Fluorescein angiography was obtained in eight patients. Five patients had retinal appearance that was either normal or could not be attributed to a known disease entity. Three patients had the multiple evanescent white dot syndrome, one had acute macular neuroretinopathy, and at least one had presumed ocular histoplasmosis. It has been proposed that acute idiopathic blind spot enlargement is a subset of multiple evanescent white dot syndrome. The authors' findings suggest that multiple evanescent white dot syndrome and other retinal diseases, some not yet identified, are subsets of acute idiopathic blind spot enlargement. 
Avascular necrosis of bone in children undergoing allogeneic bone marrow transplantation. Avascular necrosis of bone (AVNB) is reported in two children after allogeneic bone marrow transplantation. Preparation therapy for transplantation included cyclophosphamide and total body irradiation. Corticosteroids, cyclosporine A, and methotrexate were used for graft-versus-host-disease prophylaxis. The possible role of combination therapy in development of AVNB is discussed, but a direct relationship with single agents was not found. However, an early diagnosis is important to institute conservative treatment and prevent irreversible damage to affected joints. Magnetic resonance imaging was found to be more sensitive than plain radiography in early detection of AVNB. 
Origin of so-called mesothelioma of the atrioventricular node. An immunohistochemical study. To determine the origin of a mesothelioma of the atrioventricular node, immunohistochemical studies that used various antibodies, including the antibody against mesothelial cells, were performed on a mesothelioma of the atrioventricular node in a case. The lining cells of the tubules that composed the tumor were negative when tested with anti-mesothelial cell antibodies. Carcinoembryonic antigen was negative, but the secretory component was positive. Serotonin and calcitonin were positive in a few cells. We concluded that a mesothelial origin was unlikely, and it was suggested that the tumor was of an entodermal origin.
