Fatty infiltration in the liver in medium chain acyl CoA dehydrogenase deficiency. Fatty infiltration of the liver at postmortem examination has been recommended as a criterion for selection of infants who have died suddenly and unexpectedly for further biochemical investigation for disorders of fatty acid oxidation. We describe a boy with medium chain acyl CoA dehydrogenase deficiency who died four months after diagnosis and in whom only minimal hepatic fatty infiltration was found. 
Nuclear DNA content, tumor cell aggregation, and metastatic events in patients with poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma of the stomach. Data on 100 patients who had undergone resection for poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma of the stomach with serosal invasion were examined to assess the prognostic significance of the DNA distribution pattern in relation to the histologic tumor cell aggregation pattern. DNA distribution patterns were classified into low and high ploidies and tumor cell aggregation patterns were classified into free-cell, small nest, and large nest types. The rates of high ploidy in the free-cell, small nest, and large nest types were 23.1%, 48.0%, and 66.7%, respectively, with a significant increase according to the degree of aggregation. The high ploidy group and large nest type had a higher incidence of lymphogenous and hematogenous metastasis than the low ploidy group and free-cell type, respectively. DNA ploidy had no prognostic value for the free-cell type of tumor, but differences in prognosis and the incidence of metastasis between the DNA ploidies were evident in the nest-forming type. Aneuploid tumors consisting of a poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma were those with nest formation, from the standpoint of histologic structure and metastatic behavior. The DNA analysis of poorly differentiated adenocarcinomas was of prognostic value, especially in the nest-forming type. 
Radio-immunoassay detection of interferon-gamma in urine after intravesical Evans BCG therapy Our previous studies suggested that interferon-gamma (IFN gamma) was produced in the local immune response to intravesical BCG. To confirm this we modified a commercially available radio-immunoassay for detection of this lymphokine in urine. The urinary levels of IFN gamma were compared in serial urine samples taken from six patients undergoing treatment with Evans strain BCG and seven patients receiving intravesical mitomycin C/epirubicin. IFN gamma was detected consistently in response to BCG with levels reaching a peak (mean 67.1 U/ml., range 7.9 to 155.9 U/ml.) four to six hours post-instillation whereas after other intravesical agents no IFN gamma was detectable after seven of 13 instillations. After the remaining six instillations lower levels were detected (mean 7.4 U/ml., range 0.6 to 22.4 U/ml.). The difference in peak levels between the two groups was statistically significant (p less than 0.001 Mann Whitney U test). These results are further evidence of specific cellular immune activity in response to intravesical BCG therapy and suggest anti-tumour mechanisms similar to allograft rejection and autoimmunity. 
Asymptomatic bacterascites: is it spontaneous bacterial peritonitis? Asymptomatic bacterascites is defined as the presence of bacteria in ascitic fluid without clinical features of peritonitis or increased ascitic fluid polymorphonuclear cells. Asymptomatic bacterascites is a controversial entity, and little information is available regarding its spontaneous evolution. Clinical features, bacteriological data and outcome in 22 cirrhotic patients with asymptomatic bacterascites are reported and are compared with those of a group of 36 cirrhotic patients with spontaneous bacterial peritonitis. Eleven patients had gram-negative bacteria and 11 had one gram-positive bacteria. Only in three patients (13.6%) did peritonitis develop. Twelve patients received no antibiotic therapy, and in none did peritonitis develop. At 1 month, 27% of patients with asymptomatic bacterascites had died. Patients with asymptomatic bacterascites had less-severe liver disease; they more frequently had gram-positive bacteria in ascitic fluid and had a lower 1-mo mortality rate than did patients with spontaneous bacterial peritonitis. We conclude that asymptomatic bacterascites is usually the transient residence of bacteria in ascitic fluid. Peritonitis rarely develops in patients with asymptomatic bacterascites and, in most of them, antibiotic therapy is not required. 
A randomized comparison of intravenous heparin with oral aspirin and dipyridamole 24 hours after recombinant tissue-type plasminogen activator for acute myocardial infarction. National Heart Foundation of Australia Coronary Thrombolysis Group. BACKGROUND. This study addressed the need for heparin administration to be continued for more than 24 hours after coronary thrombolysis with recombinant tissue-type plasminogen activator (rt-PA). METHODS AND RESULTS. A total of 241 patients with acute myocardial infarction were treated with 100 mg rt-PA and a bolus of 5,000 units i.v. heparin followed by 1,000 units/hr i.v. heparin for 24 hours. At 24 hours, 202 patients were randomized to continue intravenous heparin therapy (n = 99) in full dosage or to discontinue heparin therapy and begin an oral antiplatelet regimen of aspirin (300 mg/day) and dipyridamole (300 mg/day) (n = 103). On prospective recording, there were no differences in the pattern of chest pain, reinfarction, or bleeding complications. Coronary angiography on cardiac catheterization at 7-10 days showed no differences in patency of the infarct-related artery. The proportion of patients with total occlusion (TIMI grade 0-1) of the infarct-related artery was 18.9% in the heparin group and 19.8% in the aspirin and dipyridamole group. In the patients with an incompletely occluded infarct-related artery, the lumen was reduced by 69 +/- 2% of normal in the heparin group and 67 +/- 2% in the aspirin and dipyridamole group. Left ventricular function assessed on cardiac catheterization and radionuclide study at day 2 and at 1 month showed no differences between the two groups. Left ventricular ejection fraction on radionuclide ventriculography at 1 month was 52.4 +/- 1.2% in the heparin group and 51.9 +/- 1.2% in the aspirin and dipyridamole group. CONCLUSIONS. We conclude that heparin therapy can be discontinued 24 hours after rt-PA therapy and replaced with an oral antiplatelet regimen without any adverse effects on chest pain, reinfarction, coronary patency, or left ventricular function. 
Permanent urethral stents for detrusor sphincter dyssynergia. A series of 22 patients, most of whom had spinal injuries with detrusor sphincter dyssynergia, have had Medinvent Wallstents placed across the distal mechanism. All but 8 patients had undergone outflow surgery and 11 had had repeated unsuccessful sphincterotomies. The proximal end of the stent was placed over the verumontanum unless fertility was contemplated, when it was placed immediately below the verumontanum. Fifteen patients achieved complete voiding after placement of the first stent; 3 developed bladder neck obstruction after stenting, but in 1 of these cases resolution occurred after bladder neck incision. The 3 patients with artificial urinary sphincters failed to improve after stenting. Use of the urethral stent for patients with detrusor sphincter dyssynergia and failed sphincterotomy is a major advance. It should probably be the primary treatment in selected cases. Its effect on fertility is currently under assessment. 
Type I human T cell leukemia virus tax protein transforms rat fibroblasts through the cyclic adenosine monophosphate response element binding protein/activating transcription factor pathway. The Tax oncoprotein of the type I human T cell leukemia virus (HTLV-I) activates transcription of cellular and viral genes through at least two different transcription factor pathways. Tax activates transcription of the c-fos proto-oncogene by a mechanism that appears to involve members of the cAMP response element binding protein (CREB) and activating transcription factor (ATF) family of DNA-binding proteins. Tax also induces the nuclear expression of the NF-kappa B family of rel oncogene-related enhancer-binding proteins. We have investigated the potential role of these CREB/ATF and NF-kappa B/Rel transcription factors in Tax-mediated transformation by analyzing the oncogenic potential of Tax mutants that functionally segregate these two pathways of transactivation. Rat fibroblasts (Rat2) stably expressing either the wild-type Tax protein or a Tax mutant selectively deficient in the ability to induce NF-kappa B/Rel demonstrated marked changes in morphology and growth characteristics including the ability to form tumors in athymic mice. In contrast, Rat2 cells stably expressing a Tax mutant selectively deficient in the ability to activate transcription through CREB/ATF demonstrated no detectable changes in morphology or growth characteristics. These results suggest that transcriptional activation through the CREB/ATF pathway may play an important role in Tax-mediated cellular transformation. 
Drainage of a pancreatic pseudocyst: an unusual complication. A 34-year-old white woman had external drainage of a pancreatic pseudocyst. During sinography, contrast medium filled perigastric varices, causing septic shock. From this experience, we believe that although sinograms are helpful, they should be preceded by prophylactic administration of antibiotics and that contrast material should be sterile. The drainage catheter should be removed as soon as possible. 
Pulmonary dysfunction in advanced liver disease: frequent occurrence of an abnormal diffusing capacity. PURPOSE: Abnormalities in pulmonary function have been reported in association with chronic liver disease of varied etiology. The aim of this study was to better define the frequency and nature of these abnormalities in patients who were being evaluated for liver transplantation. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We performed a battery of pulmonary function tests and chest radiographs in 116 consecutive patients (50 men, 66 women; aged 19 to 70 years, mean 44.6 years) with severe advanced liver disease who were hospitalized specifically for evaluation for possible orthotopic liver transplantation and were able to perform technically satisfactory tests. In 17 patients, quantitative whole-body technetium-99m macroaggregated albumin perfusion scanning was also performed for assessment of possible right-to-left shunting through intrapulmonary vascular dilatations. RESULTS: The most commonly affected test of lung function was the single-breath diffusing capacity for carbon monoxide (DLCO), which was abnormal in 48%, 45%, and 71% of patients who never smoked, former smokers, and current smokers, respectively. Ventilatory restriction was noted in 25% of all patients, airflow obstruction (reduced ratio of forced expiratory volume in 1 second to forced vital expiratory volume in 1 second to forced vital capacity) in only 3%, and a widened alveolar-arterial oxygen gradient in 45%. Diffusion impairment was accompanied by a restrictive defect in only 35% of the patients and by an abnormally widened alveolar-arterial oxygen gradient in 60%. When diffusion impairment was accompanied by an oxygenation defect, it was also associated with a significantly increased right-to-left shunt fraction (mean 24.9%) assessed from quantitative whole-body perfusion imaging. On the other hand, isolated diffusion impairment unaccompanied by significant hypoxemia (noted in approximately a third of the patients with a reduced DLCO) was not associated with evidence of significant intrapulmonary shunting (mean right-to-left shunt fraction 6.7%). CONCLUSIONS: Most patients with advanced liver disease have one or more types of abnormality in lung function, a reduced DLCO being the single most common functional defect. Mechanisms accounting for the abnormality in gas transfer may include intrapulmonary vascular dilatations, diffuse interstitial lung disease, pulmonary vaso-occlusive disease, and/or ventilation-perfusion imbalance. 
Comparison of a single layer continuous hand-sewn method and circular stapling in 580 oesophageal anastomoses. A total of 611 patients with carcinoma of the oesophagus or gastric cardia were operated on between July 1982 and December 1989. Resection was performed in 491 patients (one-stage, 483; two-stage, eight), bypass operation in 97, and 23 had exploration alone. The anastomoses of 580 patients with one-stage resection and bypass operations were evaluated. Hand-sewn anastomosis using a single layer of continuous absorbable monofilament suture was performed in 304 patients (221 resections and 83 bypasses). A stapled anastomosis was performed on 276 patients (262 resections and 14 bypasses). Following resection, there were 11 (5 per cent) anastomotic leaks in the hand-sewn group and ten (3.8 per cent) in the stapled anastomosis group (P = 0.69). Excluding anastomotic leaks, hospital mortality and anastomotic recurrence, stricture occurred in 18 of 172 hand-sewn anastomoses (10.5 per cent) and in 57 of 195 stapled anastomoses (29.2 per cent) (P less than 0.001). In patients who had bypass operations there were 12 anastomotic leaks, ten in the hand-sewn group (12.0 per cent) and two in the stapled anastomosis group (14.3 per cent). Only two of the discharged patients with bypass developed anastomotic strictures, a low incidence probably because of short survival. In addition, there were 245 subsidiary anastomoses made in the abdomen by the hand-sewn method as part of the reconstructive procedure, and there was one leak. The results of this non-randomized study suggest that hand-sewn anastomosis using a single layer continuous technique for the oesophagus is as safe as the use of circular staplers; hand-sewn anastomosis is less likely to become stenotic. 
Depression and chronic fatigue in cancer patients. Fatigue is a very common symptom among cancer patients. It is crucial to diagnose those patients for whom the fatigue is a symptom of depression, and to treat them appropriately. The key to providing complete and satisfying care is to identify and address the psychologic, social, and medical vulnerabilities of each cancer patient. No one is in a better position to accomplish that than the primary physician. 
Azathioprine induced liver disease: nodular regenerative hyperplasia of the liver and perivenous fibrosis in a patient treated for multiple sclerosis. Azathioprine hepatotoxicity has been described mainly in renal transplant recipients. Most reported cases are related to lesions of the venous system of the liver: peliosis hepatis, veno-occlusive disease of the liver, perisinusoidal fibrosis, and nodular regenerative hyperplasia of the liver. The most common clinical manifestation of these hepatic vascular lesions is portal hypertension. We present a case of nodular regenerative hyperplasia and perivenous fibrosis in a patient receiving azathioprine for multiple sclerosis. Histological abnormalities were similar to those described in renal transplant patients, and azathioprine was the only potential hepatotoxic agent present. 
The immunogenicity and safety of intradermal hepatitis B vaccine. BACKGROUND. One of the chief barriers to a greater use of hepatitis B vaccine is the high cost of the vaccine itself. A number of small research trials have shown that an adequate immune response can be induced at a much lower cost by administering one tenth of the vaccine using an intradermal technique. The purpose of this study was to ascertain whether these results could be replicated in a larger clinical trial. METHODS. Vaccine recipients included health care providers, police officers, and firefighters. Recipients were given 0.1 mL of plasma-derived hepatitis B vaccine intradermally on days 1, 30, and 180. Antibody response was measured on day 210, with seroconversion defined as a sample-to-negative (S/N) ratio of greater than or equal to 10. Any local and systemic side effects were documented. RESULTS. Six hundred sixteen individuals completed the vaccination series, and seroconversion occurred in 534 (86.7%). The rate of seroconversion in those younger than 40 years was 91.2% and in those 40 years and older was 75.1%. The mean S/N ratio was 154.9 (range 0 to 620) and decreased with increasing age (r = -.25, P = .0001). Side effects were largely limited to local reactions. CONCLUSIONS. The results support the use of the intradermal technique as a cost-effective alternative to the intramuscular route in individuals younger than 40 years. The intradermal technique may be used in older individuals if titers are obtained to assure seroconversion. Because of the restricted availability of the plasma-derived vaccine used in this study, similar trials with recombinant vaccine should be undertaken. 
Temporal changes in the occurrence of hemorrhoids in the United States and England. Although numerous etiologic risk factors have been proposed, the pathogenesis of hemorrhoids remains unknown. The present investigation assesses the temporal distribution of hemorrhoids as depicted by physician visits, hospital discharges, and surgical procedures to provide further insight into potential etiologic risk factors. The analysis was based on five data sources: from the United States, the National Disease and Therapeutic Index (NDTI), the National Hospital Discharge Survey (NHDS), and the Commission on Professional Hospital Activities (CPHA); from England and Wales, the Morbidity Statistics from General Practice (MSGP) and the Hospital In-patient Enquiry (HIPE). Results demonstrated a consistent decline in all data sources from the United States. The decrease occurred in males and females similarly and was most striking in those aged 45-64 years. Physician visits and hospital discharges for hemorrhoids in England and Wales likewise declined although the decrease was not as dramatic. The consistency of the temporal distributions among the two countries, as well as among the different sources, suggests that the observed decline may, in fact, reflect an overall decrease in the occurrence of hemorrhoidal disease. 
Aortoiliac surgery in renal transplant patients. Fifteen patients who had undergone renal transplantation 3 months to 25 years earlier were operated on for treatment of complicated aortoiliac atherosclerosis; eight had aneurysms and seven had stenotic or obstructive lesions. Except for the first patient, operated on in 1973, in whom the kidney was protected by general hypothermia, no special measure was used to protect the kidneys. A transient increase in creatinemia occurred in 11 patients during the postoperative period, whereas creatinine values remained unchanged in the other four. All patients had regained renal function identical to the + preoperative state in less than 10 days; three of them had significant improvement as a result of correction of a lesion that was impairing renal blood flow. Results obtained in this series show that protection of the transplant during aortic surgery is not necessary, provided an adequate surgical technique is used. This technique avoids the complex methods employed in the majority of previously reported cases and appears to be a safe procedure. 
Experimental arterial thrombosis in nonhuman primates. The baboon offers many advantages as an experimental animal to study vascular disease, thrombus formation and dissolution, effects of mediating variables, and the relative efficacy of therapeutic interventions. Each specific application for testing therapeutic agents may require testing in somewhat different model systems. For example, although the arteriovenous vascular graft model is efficient, cost effective, and well adapted to study of interventions for acute arterial thrombosis, surgical endarterectomy extends the evaluation to include interactions with the injured vascular wall. As the antithrombotic products of genetic engineering and molecular biology emerge, it will be increasingly important to have relevant, reproducible, and quantitative approaches to evaluate their effects in vivo. 
Cloning and in vitro expression of a melanoma-associated antigen immunogenic in patients with melanoma. The purpose of this study was to identify human melanoma-associated Ag (MAA) that are immunogenic in patients, because these molecules may be useful immunogens to implement active specific immunotherapy. To this end, an expression cDNA library constructed from the human melanoma cell line A375 was screened with sera from patients with melanoma. A 1029-bp cDNA (designated D-1) was isolated. Its nucleotide sequence showed no significant homology with viral and mammalian sequences stored in GE-NETYX. cDNA D-1 hybridized to a 2.0-kb mRNA species from human melanoma, neuroblastoma, erythroleukemia, B lymphoid, and T lymphoid cell lines but not from a renal carcinoma cell line, PBL, and cultured skin fibroblasts. The D-1 clone produced a fusion protein that displayed a significantly higher reactivity with sera from patients with melanoma than from healthy controls. Furthermore, D-1 fusion protein induced in mice antibodies that immunoprecipitated a 50-kDa component from cultured human melanoma cells. The structural properties of D-1 MAA are different from those of previously described MAA. These results suggest that the approach we have applied may be useful to identify novel MAA expressed by melanoma cells. Furthermore, the immunogenicity of recombinant D-1 protein suggests that it may be a valuable immunogen to implement active specific immunotherapy in patients with melanoma, if additional experiments show that it has the appropriate tissue distribution. 
A randomized clinical trial to compare two different approaches in women with chronic pelvic pain. One hundred six patients with chronic pelvic pain were randomly allocated to one of two treatment groups. In the standard-approach group, organic causes of pelvic pain were excluded first and diagnostic laparoscopy was routinely performed. If no somatic cause could be found, attention was given to other causes such as psychological disturbances. In the second group an integrated approach was chosen. From the beginning equal attention was devoted to somatic, psychological, dietary, environmental, and physiotherapeutic factors. In this group, laparoscopy was not routinely performed. Both groups were similar with respect to clinical characteristics of the patients and the severity of their pain as assessed by various pain parameters. Postcoital pain was reported by 27% of the patients. Twenty percent of the patients had had negative sexual experiences such as childhood sexual abuse or rape. Evaluation of the pain 1 year after the institution of treatment revealed that the integrated approach improved pelvic pain significantly more often than the standard approach for three out of four pain parameters (P less than .01). Laparoscopy played no important role in the treatment of pelvic pain. It is concluded that equal attention to both organic and other causative factors from the beginning of therapy is more likely to result in a reduction of pelvic pain than is a standard approach. 
Multivessel coronary artery disease: a key predictor of short-term prognosis after reperfusion therapy for acute myocardial infarction. Thrombolysis and Angioplasty in Myocardial Infarction (TAMI) Study Group. Results of recent studies have suggested that routine cardiac catheterization may be unnecessary after reperfusion therapy for acute myocardial infarction. Therefore to better define the short-term prognostic value of early coronary angiography, and specifically the prognostic significance of multivessel coronary artery disease, the angiographic findings of 855 patients consecutively enrolled in five phases of the TAMI study were correlated with their in-hospital outcome. All patients received intravenous thrombolytic therapy (tissue plasminogen activator, urokinase, or both agents) and underwent cardiac catheterization within 90 minutes of the initiation of therapy. Multivessel disease, defined as the presence of greater than or equal to 75% luminal diameter stenosis in two or more major epicardial arteries, was documented in 236 patients. When compared with the group of patients without multivessel disease, this group had a higher prevalence of coronary risk factors and more frequently had a history of antecedent ischemic chest pain. Although the severity of the infarct zone dysfunction was similar in the two groups (-2.77 +/- 1.00 vs -2.50 +/- 1.09 SD/chord, p = NS), global left ventricular ejection fraction was lower in the group with multivessel disease (48.6 +/- 12.4% vs 51.8 +/- 10.6%, p less than 0.01). This was associated with a significant difference in the function of the noninfarct zone. Whereas this region was hyperkinetic in the group with minimal or single-vessel disease, it was hypocontractile or dyskinetic in those with multivessel disease (+0.66 +/- 1.53 vs -0.52 +/- 1.73 SD/chord, p = 0.0001). 
Impact of magnetic resonance imaging on the management of diabetic foot infections. This combined retrospective/prospective study evaluated the value of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in 18 diabetic patients with apparent foot infections. The goal was to define the impact of MRI on directing the expedient and accurate surgical intervention so important in achieving optimal preservation of limb tissue and function. We found that MRI provides a rapid and reliable means of "viewing" the diabetic foot. Unsuspected or poorly localized abscess cavities can be pinpointed for thorough drainage with minimal exploration. An abscess can be differentiated from cellulitis or osteomyelitis. Moreover, persistent fever following drainage of a foot abscess can be reliably evaluated via MRI, obviating the need for empiric surgical reexploration. This exciting noninvasive imaging technique leads to the most accurate surgical drainage of foot abscesses and, at the same time, can prevent unnecessary surgical exploration of the tenuous diabetic foot. 
Regulation of gene expression in renal compensatory growth. Compensatory renal hypertrophy is characterized by an increase in cell protein content. There are a number of different cellular mechanisms by which such an increase could be mediated. The relative contributions of transcriptional and posttranscriptional regulation of gene expression to the increase in constitutively expressed cellular proteins were examined in mouse kidneys undergoing compensatory growth following unilateral nephrectomy (UNI-NX). Over the 14-day study period, total protein per kidney increased by up to 37%. Northern blot analysis of the expression of the mRNAs for a number of genes associated with cell growth indicated that there was no significant increase in steady-state levels of these selected genes in nephrectomized compared with sham-operated animals. In vitro assays to measure transcriptional regulation of the same set of genes in compensatory growth showed no increase in the rate of transcription. However, transcription of the 18S ribosomal RNA gene was increased 24 hours after nephrectomy. Immunoblots of two representative proteins showed that the concentration of these proteins in total kidney protein remained constant in the different experimental groups. Since total protein increased, the concentration of these proteins in the hypertrophied kidney must have increased. Taken together, these data suggest that posttranscriptional mechanisms may account for the increase in at least some constitutively expressed proteins in cells undergoing compensatory growth. 
Concurrent hydralazine administration prevents nitroglycerin-induced hemodynamic tolerance in experimental heart failure. BACKGROUND. Organic nitrates such as nitroglycerin and isosorbide dinitrate are useful in the treatment of congestive heart failure (CHF), but tolerance develops rapidly during continuous administration. Because combination therapy of nitrate and hydralazine has been shown to provide both short- and long-term benefit but nitrate alone produces hemodynamic tolerance, we questioned whether hydralazine can preserve the favorable preload effects of nitroglycerin. METHODS AND RESULTS. Using an in vivo model of nitroglycerin tolerance in the CHF rat, we examined the effects of hydralazine bolus dosing during continuous nitroglycerin infusion. Continuous infusion of nitroglycerin alone (10 micrograms/min) produced initial reductions in left ventricular end-diastolic pressure of 40-50%, which returned to baseline by 8 hours (tolerance development). Coadministration of hydralazine (2 x 0.1 mg) maintained the effects of nitroglycerin infusion on left ventricular end-diastolic pressure (45% reduction at 10 hours). This hydralazine dose alone reduced left ventricular peak systolic pressure by approximately 12 +/- 3% but had no effect on left ventricular end-diastolic pressure. Hydralazine dosing did not affect steady-state plasma concentrations of nitroglycerin or metabolites, and hydralazine was unable to prevent nitroglycerin tolerance induced in vitro. CONCLUSIONS. The beneficial interaction of hydralazine on the preload effects of nitroglycerin may explain the long-term clinical efficacy of hydralazine/nitrate combination in CHF. Our results also suggest that the mechanism of in vivo nitrate tolerance in CHF may be systemic rather than vascular in origin. 
Clonidine inhibits vesico-sphincter reflexes in patients with chronic spinal lesions. When administered systemically to spinalized animals, clonidine, the prototypic alpha 2 adrenergic receptor agonist, purportedly acts at spinal sites to suppress motor responses related to painful peripheral and vesical stimulation and spasticity, and to improve vesicourethral coordination. Hence, the action of clonidine (400 micrograms in three divided doses in a 16-hour span) on spinal vesical and somatic reflexes was examined in five patients with suprasacral spinal cord lesions by assessing volume-induced micturition reflexes and limb motor discharges that occurred spontaneously or were elicited by noxious and nonnoxious cutaneous stimulation. Clonidine caused a significant reduction in (1) blood pressure, (2) amplitude of detrusor contraction, and (3) vesical external urethral sphincter dyssynergia. Limb motor electromyography discharges were not markedly attenuated, although spatiotemporal changes (eg, irradiation, after-discharges) were observed in some of the patients. The results are ascribed to binding to spinal cord alpha 2 adrenergic receptors located on segmental and intersegmental (propriospinal) interneurons, released from descending inhibition, with greater motor system specificity on striated sphincter innervation. Clonidine may be clinically effective in the treatment of hyperactive micturition reflexes in patients with chronic spinal lesions. 
The effect of caffeine on postprandial hypotension in the elderly In a double-blind, randomized trial the effects of caffeinated and decaffeinated drinks on postprandial hemodynamic and neurohumoral changes were studied in seven fit, elderly subjects after a standard 2.4MJ meal. There was a significant difference in supine postprandial systolic blood pressure between the placebo and caffeine phases (P less than 0.01); at 60 minutes, supine systolic blood pressure had fallen 14 mmHg [95% confidence interval (CI)-7 to-21 mmHg, p less than 0.01) after placebo, but was unchanged after caffeine (+9 mmHg, CI 0 to 18 mmHg, NS]. Similar differences between placebo and caffeine were seen in erect systolic and diastolic blood pressure (P less than 0.01), although orthostatic tolerance was maintained throughout each study period. Postprandial plasma noradrenaline levels were higher (P less than 0.02) and the increase greater (P less than 0.02) after caffeine than after placebo. Caffeine administered at the end of a standard test meal prevents the postprandial fall in blood pressure in fit, elderly subjects. The clinical relevance of this finding has yet to be determined, but it may offer a simple remedy for patients with symptomatic postprandial hypotension. 
Advances in the understanding and treatment of urinary tract infections in young women. Despite relative ease of management, the high rate of urinary tract infections (UTI) among young women presents substantial problems for the health care community. Although the majority of UTIs in young women are simple and uncomplicated, the rate of recurrence is substantial. Each treatment of UTI recurrence brings greater antibiotic resistance, requiring the use of broader spectrum and more expensive antibiotic therapy. Moreover, infection in patients with underlying urinary tract or systemic diseases can lead to serious medical and financial consequences. A better understanding of antibiotic resistance, particularly in regard to beta-lactamase-producing pathogens, has allowed us to develop more appropriate criteria for selecting antibiotics as well as the duration of therapy. The overall cost for treating UTIs in young women is a substantial health care expenditure, and requires an ongoing examination of new information concerning pathogenesis and available antibiotic therapies. 
Staged repair of interrupted aortic arch and ventricular septal defect in infancy. Staged repair of interrupted aortic arch and ventricular septal defect was carried out in 20 infants from 1979 through 1990. Among the important associated cardiac defects were transposition of the great arteries, truncus arteriosus, and anomalous origin of the right pulmonary artery. The first stage, usually consisting of the placement of an 8- or 10-mm polytetrafluoroethylene graft, pulmonary artery banding, and ligation of the patent ductus arteriosus, resulted in 20 survivors (100%) There were two interim deaths (10%) before the second stage of ventricular septal defect closure and pulmonary artery band removal, which had 15 survivors (83%, 15/18). Because the major morbidity and mortality early in this experience could be traced to leaving the pulmonary artery band on too long, early removal (within 2 to 3 months) was begun. Since 1985, 8 (100%) of 8 infants have survived both stages and are now doing well. Because of the relatively large polytetrafluoroethylene graft, only 1 child (aged 9 years) has experienced substantial late aortic arch obstruction and undergone placement of an 18-mm Dacron graft without difficulty. Of interest is the finding that in only 1 (5%) of the 20 patients has major (greater than or equal to 40-mm Hg gradient) left ventricular outflow tract obstruction developed. In summary, the staged repair of interrupted aortic arch with ventricular septal defect has become very reliable despite the condition of the infant or major associated cardiac anomalies and can be recommended for infants at high risk for primary repair. More long-term information will be needed to determine which approach will be the best choice for the majority of infants. 
Colorectal cancer patients with high risk of hematogenous metastasis: correlation with CEA levels in peripheral and draining venous blood during the period of operation. Correlations between carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) levels of peripheral (p) and draining (d) venous blood during the period of operation, and pre- and post-operatively detected hematogenous metastases were examined in 78 patients with colorectal cancer. The metastases were found in 28 patients (HM group), but not found in the other 50 patients (non-HM group). The mean values (43 and 198 ng/ml) and positive rates (61 and 96%) greater than 5 ng/ml of p- and d-CEA levels in the HM group were significantly higher than those (6 and 14 ng/ml, and 22 and 48%, respectively) in the non-HM group. The differences (mean 184 ng/ml and positive rate 49%) of d-CEA levels between both groups were more significant than those (39 ng/ml and 30%) of p-CEA levels. The mean value (155 ng/ml) and positive rate (82%) greater than 5 ng/ml of the gradient between d- and p-CEA levels (d-p CEA gradient) in the HM group were significantly higher than those (8 ng/ml and 34%) in the non-HM group. These results suggest that patients with a high risk of hematogenous metastases are more effectively checked by the determination of d-CEA levels and d-p CEA gradient than of p-CEA levels, and that they are patients with positive d-CEA and d-p CEA gradient levels. 
Contemporary management of neurofibromatosis. The neurofibromatoses are two distinct entities with different genetic origins. The phenotypic expressions and required treatments are different. The devastating nature of neurofibromatosis-2 may be more effectively controlled through the application of advanced imaging techniques and contemporary neurotologic procedures. The most common manifestation of neurofibromatosis-2 is that of bilateral acoustic neuromas. The eventual total bilateral sensorineural deafness associated with this condition can be obviated in selected cases if the diagnosis is established early. Follow-up data are reported for three patients in whom hearing was preserved in at least one ear. When removal with hearing preservation is not possible, subtotal tumor removal with decompression of the internal auditory canals may delay progression of hearing loss. A new approach to tumors of the pterygomaxillary fossa that have extended to the middle cranial fossa has been successfully applied and is described. 
The effects of chronic endoscopic variceal sclerotherapy on portal pressure in cirrhotics. The effect of obliterating esophageal varices by endoscopic sclerotherapy on portal pressure was prospectively studied in 11 cirrhotic patients with variceal hemorrhage. Portal venous pressure gradient, determined as the difference between transhepatic portal and hepatic vein pressure, increased by a mean of 31.1% +/- 14.5% in 8 (73%) and decreased by a mean of 30.1% +/- 11.7% in 3 (27%) patients, with no statistically significant change overall (P = 0.1). These changes in portal venous pressure gradient occurred despite an improvement in the laboratory and clinical parameters of hepatic function. Deep abdominal sonography with color flow imaging at variceal obliteration showed patent paraumbilical veins in 6 (55%) patients, 3 of whom had decreases in portal venous pressure gradient (29%, 19%, 42.5%) at variceal obliteration. In 5 (45%) patients without patent paraumbilical veins, a statistically significant increase in portal venous pressure gradient between initial endoscopic variceal sclerotherapy and variceal obliteration was noted (P = 0.008). Rebleeding (single episode in all 4 patients, before obliteration in 3 patients) occurred in those with an increase in portal venous pressure gradient; all patients with portal venous pressure gradient decreases were nonbleeders. No correlation between changes in portal venous pressure gradient and time to variceal obliteration, number of sclerotherapy treatments, or rebleeding episodes was observed. Thus, an increase in portal venous pressure gradient was noted in the majority of patients at variceal obliteration. Although the portal venous pressure gradient decrease may be explained by a patent paraumbilical vein, the mechanism of portal venous pressure gradient increase is not clear. It is speculated that this portal venous pressure gradient increase may be caused by an increase in collateral resistance or flow or a combination of both, resulting from obliteration of esophageal varices by endoscopic sclerotherapy. 
Role of emergency medical services. For thrombolytic therapy to be effective in the treatment of acute myocardial infarction, the patient must enter the health care center delivery system in an efficient manner. Some entry delays are due to patient decisions and interactions with others. In the United States, prehospital care is delivered by a variety of different systems, varying from public service types such as fire-department based to private types of service. These personnel vary in level of training from paramedics with a high level of training to Emergency Medical Technicians-Ambulance with basic training (first aid), even less in some areas. The training should be upgraded so that training as an emergency medical technician with the ability to defibrillate would be the minimum level for emergency ambulance personnel; wherever economically and logistically feasible, ambulance personnel should be paramedics. Although the 911 emergency telephone system exists in some areas, there is no centralized, universal system for access, causing confusion and delays in obtaining care in critical situations such as cardiac arrest. There is a need for a national emergency number--911--with the ability to identify the calling number and address. Since dispatchers have little medical dispatch training, needed instructions are not given to the caller, which can reduce the patient's chance of survival. Trained dispatchers are needed to dispatch resources efficiently and to offer assistance until trained rescuers arrive. Ambulances are inefficiently located in some areas of the United States, slowing response to the patient. 
Effort thrombosis of the axillosubclavian vein: a disabling vascular disorder. In the natural history of this disorder, resumption of normal activity after a period of recuperation (following an episode of thrombosis) frequently leads to symptoms of upper extremity venous hypertension exacerbated by using the arms in the overhead position. This position can be demonstrated venographically to further occlude collateral vessels in thoracic outlet. A number of patients develop more extensive symptoms of neurogenic thoracic outlet syndrome. Anticoagulation may protect the collateral vessels and interrupt the period of active clot propagation resulting in a better functional result than would be expected from the natural history of the thrombotic event. In our experience, local Urokinase was the most effective means for reestablishing venous patency. With clot dissolution the underlying compression of the vein at the thoracic outlet can be demonstrated. Balloon angioplasty should not be undertaken in the acute setting nor prior to relieving the tendinous compression. The acute phlebitic process should resolve under the protection of Coumadin for three months. At that time it can be determined more effectively which patients require additional therapy. Removal of the first rib will decompress the axillosubclavian vein and the thoracic outlet collaterals permitting the vein to regain its normal configuration particularly in younger patients with more acute onset of compression. In those patients with more chronic compression the vein becomes stenotic. Improvement of the luminal configuration has been accomplished with transvenous balloon angioplasty without the necessity for venous reconstructive procedures in this series. Patients with Paget-Schroetter syndrome have a symptom complex which often reflects more extensive neurovascular compression at the thoracic outlet than that which might result from venous hypertension alone. Although thrombolytic therapy can restore patency of the axillosubclavian vein, first rib resection is necessary to relieve the external compression. This procedure was very effective in patients who had restoration of subclavian vein patency, and to a lesser degree in those with residual occlusion. 
Paul Broca and the first craniotomy based on cerebral localization. Paul Broca (1824-1880) was a well-known French surgeon-anthropologist-neurologist. Best known for his work on cerebral cortical localization and speech mechanisms, Broca also carefully worked out skull and scalp localization for underlying cortical regions. In 1871, Broca treated a man who had sustained a scalp laceration from a blow to the head without loss of consciousness or skull fracture. The patient exhibited a nonfluent aphasia about 1 month after injury and became progressively obtunded and eventually comatose. Suspecting an intracranial abscess, Broca trephined at the region of the left third frontal convolution and drained an epidural abscess. The patient improved transiently but died a few days later. Autopsy showed a left-sided, predominantly frontal purulent meningoencephalitis. Broca's other neurosurgical contributions included various surgical cases, methods for scalp localization of the cerebral convolutions, extensive studies of skull and brain abnormalities, thermoencephalography, and the stimulation of younger surgical colleagues and neurologists to make practical use of cerebral localization. 
HLA class I antigen expression as a measure of response to antiviral therapy of chronic hepatitis B. HLA class I antigen expression on peripheral blood mononuclear cells was evaluated by flow cytometry in 21 HBeAg-positive patients with chronic hepatitis B. Measurements were made before, during or after treatment with recombinant interferon-alpha-2b, either given alone or after a 6 wk course of prednisone. Immunohistochemical staining for human leukocyte class I antigen was also evaluated in 28 percutaneous liver biopsy specimens either obtained before or after therapy (N = 27) and during therapy in one instance. The amount of HLA class I antigen on peripheral blood mononuclear cells varied markedly among individual patients, but the overall results indicated that the level of inducible antigen did not correlate with increments of ALT during therapy or with a virological response to therapy. Hepatocyte staining for HLA class I antigen was observed in a minority of biopsy specimens (29%) and also did not appear to predict a response or correlate with the severity of histological disease. These data do not support current theories concerning pathogenetic mechanisms in chronic hepatitis B nor do they suggest that spontaneous display of HLA class I antigen on hepatocytes or interferon-induced expression of these antigens on peripheral blood mononuclear cells is a critical determinant for a response to therapy. 
Dispersion of ventricular repolarization in the long QT syndrome. To identify markers of dispersion of the ventricular repolarization in the idiopathic long QT syndrome, body surface potential maps were analyzed in 40 such patients (mean age +/- standard deviation 21 +/- 11 years) and in 30 healthy control subjects (mean age 24 +/- 7 years). In each subject, 117 chest leads were recorded and maps of the integral values of the QRST interval were calculated. A multipolar distribution of the values, a marker of gross electrical inequalities of repolarization, was found only in 4 patients. To detect minor regional disparities of ventricular recovery, all the ST-T waveforms were analyzed in each subject. The ST-T waves were represented by a discrete series of potential values. The "similarity index" was computed by applying a principal component analysis, which represents (in percent) to what extent 1 fundamental pattern of ST-T reproduces all the recorded waveforms. The mean value of the similarity index was significantly lower in patients with long QT syndrome than in control subjects (49 +/- 10 vs 77 +/- 8%, p less than 0.0001). A value less than 61% (corresponding to 2 standard deviations below the mean value for controls) was found in 35 of 40 patients and in only 1 control subject (sensitivity 87%, specificity 96%). Thus, the similarity index is a more sensitive marker than the multipolar distribution of QRST integral maps in revealing electrical disparities of the ventricular recovery times. 
Spatial misregistration of vascular flow during MR imaging of the CNS: cause and clinical significance. Spatial misregistration of signal recovered from flowing spins within vascular structures is a common phenomenon seen in MR imaging of the CNS. The condition is displayed as a bright line or dot offset from the true anatomic location of the lumen of the imaged vessel. Its origin is the time delay between application of the phase- and frequency-encoding gradients used to locate spins within the plane of section. The principal condition necessary for the production of spatial misregistration is flow oblique to the axis of the phase-encoding gradient. Flow-related enhancement (entry slice phenomenon), even-echo rephasing, and gradient-moment nulling contribute to the production of the bright signal of spatial misregistration. Familiarity with the typical appearance of flow-dependent spatial misregistration permits confirmation of a vessel's patency; identification of the direction of flow; estimation of the velocity of flow; and differentiation of this flow artifact from atheromas, dissection, intraluminal clot, and artifacts such as chemical shift. 
Trends in the operative management of invasive squamous carcinoma of the vulva at Indiana University, 1974 to 1988. From January 1974 to March 1988, 150 patients with primary invasive squamous cell carcinoma of the vulva underwent surgery at Indiana University. There has been a trend toward more conservative surgical management of this disease. To determine the impact of this trend on clinical outcome, cases were divided into three groups according to date of operation: group I, 1974 to 1978; group II, 1979 to 1983; and group III, 1984 to 1988. Overall, 80 patients had en bloc radical vulvectomy and groin dissection, 20 had modified radical vulvectomy and bilateral groin dissection through three separate incisions, and 36 had modified radical vulvectomy and unilateral superficial groin dissection. Fourteen patients had other operations. Forty-two patients (27.3%) had radiotherapy in addition to surgery. Among the three groups, there were no differences when mean age, International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics stage distribution (1988 system), mean lesion size, mean depth of invasion, or grade distribution were compared. A significant trend toward more conservative surgical therapy was observed. En bloc radical vulvectomy was performed in 77.4% of group I patients, 71.1% of group II patients, and 35.8% of group III patients (p less than 0.001). Mean days of hospitalization were also reduced significantly. Group I had a mean stay of 30 days, group II had a mean stay of 23 days, and group III had a mean stay of 11 days (p less than 0.001). Mean operative blood loss (group I, 754.8 ml; group II, 620.0 ml; group III, 393.6 ml; p = 0.03), mean units of blood transfused (group I, 1.4 units; group II, 1.3 units; group III, 0.4 units; p less than 0.01), and mean hours of operating time (group I, 3.7 hours; group II, 3.7 hours; group III, 3.2 hours; p = 0.02) were also reduced. 
Detubularisation in cystoplasty: clinical review. Cystoplasty using a detubularised bowel segment is preferable to using a tubularised length of intestine. This has been shown experimentally to result in a reduction in the contractility of the neobladder, although contractions are not completely abolished. Incontinence, especially nocturnal, may still be a problem. Assessment of renal function has shown a marked incidence of upper tract dysfunction despite detubularisation. All patients remain at risk of upper tract obstruction following cystoplasty. Because bowel contraction waves are brought on by distension, it may be possible either to postpone or to prevent the onset of contractions by avoiding an excessive build-up of bladder volume. Clean intermittent self-catheterisation is an efficient means of emptying the bladder, although sphincter rebalancing may also be required. 
Altered gallbladder contractility after extracorporeal shock-wave cholecystolithotripsy. Change in gallbladder contractility after biliary extracorporeal shock-wave lithotripsy (ESWL) may significantly influence the clearance of fragments after successful gallstone fragmentation. We assessed changes in gallbladder contractility in response to an oral fatty meal in 50 patients 1 month after biliary ESWL (all fragments were smaller than 3 mm) and also in a separate group of 10 patients 3 months after complete clearance of fragments. The prevalence of persistent lumen-obliterating contraction of the gallbladder after biliary ESWL also was analyzed in 325 patients. Gallbladder contractility remained unchanged in 30, increased in nine, and decreased in 11 of the 50 patients. The average reduction in the fasting gallbladder volume after lithotripsy was 28% (p less than .001). Gallbladder contractility remained unchanged 3 months after complete clearance of fragments in six of 10 patients studied separately. A decrease (n = 2) or increase (n = 2) in contractility was seen in the remaining patients. No significant difference occurred in the average ejection fraction of the gallbladder before lithotripsy and after complete clearance of the fragments. Thirty-four of the 325 patients who have so far undergone biliary ESWL had a completely contracted gallbladder with no lumen visible on sonography. The gallbladder returned to a relaxed state in half of these patients within 1-9 months. Thus, biliary ESWL did not significantly alter gallbladder contractility in 60% of patients. A significant reduction in the volume of the fasting gallbladder occurred after lithotripsy. Successful clearance of fragments did not improve the contractility of stonebearing gallbladders in the majority of patients. 
The modified transcochlear approach to the cerebellopontine angle. We have modified the transcochlear approach to improve exposure of the anterior petrous apex, clivus, anterior cerebellopontine angle, and the prepontine region. These changes include resection of the external auditory canal, middle ear, glenoid fossa, and posterior zygomatic arch. This approach provides improved exposure of the petrous carotid artery, jugular bulb, and clivus. It offers the largest and most lateral access to the anterior cerebellopontine and prepontine region. The results of this approach in 11 patients are discussed. 
Comparison of catheter ablation using radiofrequency versus direct current energy: biophysical, electrophysiologic and pathologic observations. The effects of catheter ablation with radiofrequency versus direct current energy were compared in 18 dogs assigned to two groups (of 9 dogs each). Each dog underwent a single ablation at two sites in the left ventricle at energy levels of 100, 200 or 300 J delivered in unipolar configuration to six dogs each. A transient decrease in left ventricular systolic pressure (from 121.3 +/- 24.5 to 94.2 +/- 18.7 mm Hg, p less than 0.01) and wall motion abnormality were noted in dogs with direct current shock. The left ventricular ejection fraction decreased (from 50 +/- 2% to 34 +/- 3%, p less than 0.001) shortly after direct current ablation but improved 4 weeks later to 43 +/- 3%. There were no significant changes in left ventricular pressure, wall motion or ejection fraction in dogs in the radiofrequency ablation group. Sustained ventricular tachycardia (greater than or equal to 30 s) was seen immediately after direct current shock in all dogs, and one dog died of intractable ventricular fibrillation. A 24-h ambulatory electrocardiographic (ECG) monitor obtained immediately after the procedure showed multiple runs of ventricular tachycardia in all dogs exposed to direct current ablation but in only three dogs that underwent radiofrequency ablation. No differences were found in peak creatine kinase, complete blood count with smear and B-beta 15-42 fibrinopeptide levels. Pathologically, direct current-induced lesions were larger (mean length x width x depth 10.9 x 7.5 x 5.2 vs. 4.8 x 4.6 x 4.3 mm) and were poorly circumscribed with inhomogeneous margins of necrosis. 
The influence of intraoperative hypotension and perioperative blood transfusion on disease-free survival in patients with complete resection of colorectal liver metastases. An increased interest in surgical treatment of liver metastases from colorectal origin has evolved recently. However not all patients benefit from this approach, with early recurrence and death still being encountered. To evaluate clinical as well as perioperative factors that might significantly affect the outcome of patients with completely resected colorectal liver metastases, we examined 116 patients who underwent resection between September 1987 and August 1989. Median follow-up time was 13.2 months (0.6 to 31.4 months). The overall survival rate was 91% at 1 year and 75% at 2 years. Median survival was not reached. Median disease-free survival time was 11.5 months, with 49.4% and 21.2% of the patients being free of disease at 1 and 2 years, respectively. By univariate analysis, site of primary colorectal cancer, preoperative carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) level, size of metastases, number of metastases, length of operation time, percentage mean arterial pressure, number of hypotensive episodes, duration of hypotensive episodes, and whole blood transfusion significantly affected recurrence rate following resection. However only site of primary tumor, CEA, number of metastases, and number of hypotensive episodes remained significant in the multivariate analysis. The most significant single factor that affected recurrence rate was the number of hypotensive episodes during the operative procedure. It is concluded that hypotensive episodes, even when well controlled, should be avoided during operation to maximize the chances of cure and prolong disease-free survival of patients with colorectal liver metastases. 
Failure of physicians to recognize acetaminophen hepatotoxicity in chronic alcoholics. We encountered six alcoholic patients with severe acetaminophen hepatotoxicity during a 2-year period. All patients had marked elevations of aminotransferases and sometimes remarkably high prothrombin times at, or shortly after, presentation. In five of six cases the diagnosis was missed by the physicians initially caring for the patient. The apparent reasons for the missed diagnosis were insufficient history regarding the use of acetaminophen, an inappropriate reliance on blood acetaminophen levels, and lack of knowledge regarding typical aminotransferase elevations in alcoholic hepatitis vs acetaminophen toxicity. The initial clinical presentation of acetaminophen hepatotoxicity in chronic alcoholics is easily recognized clinically and is distinct from acetaminophen hepatotoxicity in suicide ingestions and from alcoholic hepatitis. Internists and other physicians should be aware of this entity and rely on the clinical picture and the history of acetaminophen use to confirm the diagnosis. 
An alternative explanation for the genesis of closed-lock symptoms in the internal derangement process. Clinical and surgical data on 194 operated joints (135 patients) were used to substantiate a new concept challenging the presumed natural history of temporomandibular internal derangement (ID). A number of findings were incompatible with the traditional depiction of a progressive process based on gradual changes in disc position and shape. These findings were a lack or correlation between increasing age and the stages of the process; the percentage of patients in the third stage (closed lock) with limited opening (less than 25 mm) too severe to be caused solely by a nonreducible, displaced disc; the unexpectedly high incidence (greater than 50%) of normally shaped discs in the third stage of the process. A specific condition of severe and stubborn limited maximal mouth opening caused by total cessation of gliding, liable to occur at any age and unrelated to disc shape or position, which responds successfully to simple treatment by lavage and lysis, pressured injection, or arthrocentesis, was discerned. Lack of gliding was attributed to adherence of the disc to the fossa by a reversible effect such as a vacuum and/or decreased volume of synovial fluid of high viscosity. This condition was deemed worthy of an independent identity, dissociated from disc displacement, as a causative factor in the second and third stages of ID, and particularly as an aid to accurate diagnosis and treatment. 
Intracanalicular acoustic neurinomas. The cases of 16 patients with acoustic neurinomas confined to the intracanalicular area are presented. These represent 2.7% of the 600 patients with acoustic neurinomas consecutively operated upon at the Neurosurgical Clinic at Nordstadt Hospital during the last 8 years. The comparatively earlier onset of vestibular symptoms and signs was characteristic of this group and precipitated diagnosis. The diagnostic reliability of magnetic resonance imaging was at least equivalent to that of air computed tomographic cisternography. Complete tumor removal was accomplished via the suboccipital approach in all patients, with 100% preservation of facial nerve and facial function; the cochlear nerve was preserved anatomically in 100% of the patients and functionally in 57%. No recurrence has occurred during follow-up periods of up to 8 years in all 16 patients. A broad spectrum of the current literature is considered, and purely intracanalicular acoustic neurinomas are discussed with regard to clinical characteristics, diagnostic steps-including neuroradiological and neurophysiological approaches-and surgical treatment and results. 
Acute gall bladder perforation--a dilemma in early diagnosis. Gall bladder perforation is a rare complication of cholecystitis. A definitive diagnosis is uncommon before surgery and the morbidity and mortality associated with this condition are high. We report six patients with gall bladder perforation to show the difficulty of making an early diagnosis. The history and the clinical findings of these patients are reviewed to highlight diagnostic pitfalls. 
Genital human papillomavirus infection in men. Diagnosis and treatment with a laser and 5-fluorouracil. One hundred twenty-eight consecutive men, sexual partners (for more than six months) of women treated for genital condylomata acuminata, were evaluated with colposcopy to assess the percentage of infected men among the couples. Ninety-three (73%) of the men were found to have a genital human papillomavirus infection on colposcopically directed biopsies. All but one patient were treated with outpatient colposcopically guided laser vaporization under local anesthesia (one patient with extensive condylomata required general anesthesia). Two weeks after laser surgery, 5% 5-fluorouracil cream, used in the genital area, was initiated on a weekly basis for two months and every other week for two more months. Patients were followed in the clinic with colposcopy performed every eight weeks for six months to evaluate the regimen's results. Thirty-seven (40%) of the 93 men had "clinically" apparent genital HPV infection, and 56 (60%) of the 93 had "subclinical" disease (as determined with colposcopy). The majority of the patients (87 of 93, or 94%) responded to one laser treatment followed by 5-fluorouracil cream and had no visible lesions at six months. Colposcopic evaluation of the male partners of infected women and laser surgery followed by topical 5-fluorouracil therapy appear to be safe and effective in controlling genital HPV infection. 
3DFT MR angiography of the carotid bifurcation: potential and limitations as a screening examination. The authors compared the three-dimensional Fourier transform (3DFT) time-of-flight magnetic resonance (MR) angiograms in 38 patients initially studied with selective intraarterial digital subtraction angiography (DSA) for suspected arteriosclerotic disease of the carotid bifurcation. MR angiograms were successfully obtained in 65 of the 75 carotid arteries (87%) visualized with DSA. DSA and MR angiographic studies were assessed for percentage area stenosis by two independent observers on two occasions. Statistical tests indicated consistency in interpretation for each observer as well as between observers. No significant difference was found between the two modalities in ability to depict changes in percentage area stenosis. For the 32 right carotid arteries in the comparison, the median for the difference between MR angiography and intraarterial DSA was 1.83% (range, -22.38% to 55.60%); for the 33 visualized left carotid arteries, it was 0.00% (range, -20.55% to 49.95%). Receiver operating characteristic analysis indicated that technically adequate MR angiography may be a sensitive screening examination for stenoses. 
Pericardial haemorrhage causing right atrial compression after cardiac surgery: role of transoesophageal echocardiography. After cardiac surgery transoesophageal echocardiography showed a large thrombus compressing the right atrium in three hypotensive patients. No satisfactory images were obtained by transthoracic imaging, which is often difficult in ventilated patients after cardiac surgery. Transoesophageal echocardiography, however, provided rapid diagnostic information and permitted prompt surgical intervention. 
Plasmapheresis in a case of eosinophilia-myalgia syndrome with ascending polyneuropathy. Eosinophilia-myalgia syndrome complicated by ascending polyneuropathy in a 40-year-old woman is described. High-dose intravenous steroids had no beneficial effect on the clinical course. Dramatic and rapid clinical improvement occurred with the use of plasmapheresis. The use of this therapeutic modality should be considered in patients with a similar clinical presentation. 
The interpretation of dysprosody in patients with Parkinson's disease. Prosodic features in the speech production of 21 patients with idiopathic Parkinson's disease were tested. The appreciation of vocal and facial expression was also examined in the same patients. Significant intergroup differences were found in the prosody production tasks but, in contrast to previous results, not in the receptive tasks on the recognition and appreciation of prosody and of facial expression. The discrepancy between the production and recognition of prosodic features does not support the suggestion that dysprosody in Parkinson's disease is necessarily a disorder of processing emotional information that could be misinterpreted as a dysarthria. 
Phase I/II trial of recombinant human granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor following allogeneic bone marrow transplantation. Forty-seven patients with hematologic neoplasia received recombinant human granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (rhGM-CSF) by daily 2-hour infusion following allogeneic bone marrow transplantation from HLA-identical sibling donors in a phase I-II dose-escalation trial. Dose levels ranged from 30 to 500 micrograms/m2/d. At doses at or below 250 micrograms/m2/d, toxicity felt to be caused by rhGM-CSF was negligible. However, three of five patients treated with 500 micrograms/m2/d had unacceptable side effects caused by rhGM-CSF. Two different graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) prophylactic regimens were administered. Twenty-seven evaluable patients were administered regimens that did not contain methotrexate (MTX) (Group I) and reached an absolute neutrophil count of 1,000/microL by a median of day 14. In contrast, 18 patients who received GVHD prophylactic regimens containing MTX (Group II) reached an absolute neutrophil count of 1,000/microL on a median of day 20. Patients in Group I had fewer febrile days and, of those discharged, had shorter initial hospitalizations than patients in Group II. The overall incidence of severe acute GVHD (grade 2 or greater) in the rhGM-CSF-treated patients was 28% and was similar to that in historical "good risk" patients who did not receive rhGM-CSF. These preliminary data suggest rhGM-CSF is unlikely to exacerbate GVHD in HLA-identical sibling donor transplants and indicate the need for randomized trials of rhGM-CSF in allogeneic marrow transplant patients. 
Rhabdomyolysis in children: a 3-year retrospective study. The case reports of 4 pediatric patients illustrate the complex clinical scenarios in which childhood rhabdomyolysis/myoglobinuria occurs. Children ranged in age from 8-18 years. Presumed etiologies of rhabdomyolysis/myoglobinuria included Neisseria sepsis, exertion-related episodes, dialysis disequilibrium, and diabetic ketoacidosis. No child developed respiratory or renal failure. all children were discharged with normal muscle power, indicating the benign nature of this disease and the importance of aggressive management. 
Renal artery stenosis: preliminary results of treatment with the Strecker stent. Use of the Strecker flexible balloon-expandable tantalum stent for treatment of renal artery stenosis after failed angioplasty or transaortic thromboendarterectomy was evaluated in 10 patients (nine hypertensive, one normotensive). Left (n = 3) and right (n = 5) renal arteries were involved; renal artery stenosis in two patients had developed after kidney transplantation. Indications for stent placement were inadequate immediate postangioplasty response (n = 7), development of considerable restenosis after angioplasty (n = 1), and obstructing intimal flaps following transaortic endarterectomy (n = 2). Stent placement was technically successful (less than 20% residual stenosis) and patency was preserved in eight patients. Of the seven hypertensive patients with successful implantation, two were cured, three had improvement, and two had no change at latest follow-up evaluation (mean, 10.6 months; range, 6-12 months). The Strecker stent may be helpful in treating restenosis after failed revascularization procedures, although the precise indication, true safety, and long-term efficacy of stent placement in renal arteries will not be known until trials with more subjects and longer follow-up periods are completed. 
Rest-injected thallium-201 imaging for assessing viability of severe asynergic regions. To evaluate the utility of rest-injected 201Tl initial and delayed images for assessing the viability of severe asynergic regions, we studied 17 patients with apparently prior infarcted myocardium in combination with 99mTc ventriculography before and after revascularization. In 51 regions with severe asynergy, the percent 201Tl uptake was calculated as the ratio of counts on the segment with asynergy to the maximum counts on the normal segment. Eleven of 14 regions with resting 201Tl redistribution (Group 1) had improved wall motion after revascularization. However, 14 of 37 regions without redistribution also improved (Group 2). Twenty-three regions without redistribution or improved wall motion after revascularization (Group 3) had lower regional 201Tl uptake on their delayed images than those in Groups 1 and 2. Moreover, the initial regional uptake of Group 2 was higher than that of Group 3. These results suggest that redistribution on rest-injected 201Tl scans indicates reversibility of severely asynergic myocardium and that high 201Tl uptake in regions without redistribution may predict improvement in wall motion after revascularization. We conclude that 201Tl uptake may be useful as a marker of viability of severe asynergic regions before revascularization. 
Failure of ursodeoxycholic acid to prevent a cholestatic episode in a patient with benign recurrent intrahepatic cholestasis: a study of bile acid metabolism. Ursodeoxycholic acid was administered to a patient with benign recurrent intrahepatic cholestasis to prevent cholestatic episodes. A detailed study of bile acid metabolism in this patient was carried out in the anicteric and icteric phases before and after ursodeoxycholic acid (750 mg/day) administration. Urinary, biliary and serum bile acids were measured by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry and by high-performance liquid chromatography techniques. During the anicteric phase the daily urinary excretion and serum concentrations of bile acids were within normal ranges, indicating normal hepatic uptake and secretion of bile acids during the cholestasis-free period. Only slight qualitative differences from normal individuals were observed; the relative proportions of deoxycholic acid in the bile and serum were higher, and 12-oxo-lithocholic acid was the predominant urinary bile acid. During the icteric phase a marked increase in the urinary excretion of primary bile acids and C-1, C-2, C-4 and C-6 hydroxylated metabolites was found. Serum bile acid concentrations increased before the rise in bilirubin, suggesting an acute disturbance in bile acid transport at the onset of the cholestatic attack. After ursodeoxycholic acid administration in the anicteric phase, bile became enriched with the exogenous bile acid, but little qualitative change was found in the other metabolites present in the urine, serum or bile during the anicteric or icteric phases. Prolonged administration of ursodeoxycholic acid failed to prevent recurrence of a cholestatic episode, suggesting that in benign recurrent intrahepatic cholestasis, oral ursodeoxycholic acid may be of little benefit in the treatment or prevention of cholestasis despite marked enrichment of the bile acid pool with this hydrophilic bile acid. 
Physical and emotional stress associated with components of the infertility investigation: perspectives of professionals and patients. OBJECTIVE: The present study examined patients', nurses', and physicians' perceptions of the physical and emotional difficulty of infertility treatment. DESIGN: A mail survey method was used. PATIENTS, PARTICIPANTS: Participants included 26 patients, 76 nurses, and 71 physicians from infertility clinics in the United States and Canada. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: A rating scale measured the physical and emotional difficulty level of 36 components from the infertility investigation. RESULTS: Nurses rated the emotional and physical distress of patients higher than did patients and physicians, whereas patients rated their distress higher than did physicians. Older nurses and physicians inferred lower levels of physical and emotional distress than did their younger counterparts. A greater breadth of experience with infertility treatments was associated with higher ratings of emotional distress by nurses and lower ratings by physicians. CONCLUSIONS: Patients, nurses, and physicians perceive infertility treatment from unique vantage points creating differences in perceptions that have implications for patient care. Factors including era of professional training, stage of life, and changes resulting from advancing technology are viewed as influencing health care professionals' perceptions of infertility distress. 
Renal hemodynamics and the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system in normotensive subjects with hypertensive and normotensive parents. BACKGROUND AND METHODS. The kidney is important in blood-pressure regulation, but its role in the development of essential hypertension is still subject to debate. We compared renal hemodynamics, measured in terms of the clearance of para-aminohippuric acid and inulin, and the characteristics of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system in three groups of normotensive subjects at different degrees of risk for hypertension: 41 subjects with two normotensive parents, 52 with one normotensive and one hypertensive parent, and 61 with two hypertensive parents. The subjects ranged in age from 7 to 32 years. RESULTS. The mean renal blood flow was lower in the subjects with two hypertensive parents than in those with two normotensive parents (mean difference [+/- SE], 198 +/- 61 ml per minute per 1.73 m2 of body-surface area; P = 0.002). Moreover, both the filtration fraction and renal vascular resistance were higher in the subjects with two hypertensive parents (filtration fraction: mean difference, 3.0 +/- 1.1 percentage points; P = 0.006; renal vascular resistance: mean difference, 2.7 +/- 0.8 mm Hg per deciliter per minute per 1.73 m2; P = 0.006). The subjects with two hypertensive parents had lower plasma concentrations of renin (mean difference, 3.3 +/- 1.6 mU per liter; P = 0.03) and aldosterone (mean difference, 111 +/- 36 pmol per liter; P = 0.003) than those with two normotensive parents. The differences could not be explained by the small differences in blood pressure between the groups. The values in the subjects with one hypertensive and one normotensive parent fell between those for the other two groups. CONCLUSIONS. Renal vasoconstriction is increased and renin and aldosterone secretion is decreased in young persons at risk for hypertension. These findings support the hypothesis that alterations in renal hemodynamics occur at an early stage in the development of familial hypertension. 
Acute pulmonary embolism in pediatric patients awaiting heart transplantation. Acute pulmonary embolism with infarction can delay urgently needed heart transplantation and increase the postoperative pulmonary complications. Few data are available concerning pulmonary embolization in the pediatric patient with end-stage congestive heart failure. Sixty-two consecutive pediatric patients awaiting heart transplantation were monitored for evidence of acute pulmonary embolism. Acute pulmonary infarction was documented by ventilation-perfusion scan, pulmonary angiography or pathologic examination in six patients. The prevalence differed by diagnosis; 5 of 36 patients with dilated cardiomyopathy and 1 of 20 patients with congenital heart disease developed acute pulmonary embolism with infarction. No significant difference in age at the time of transplantation evaluation, duration of congestive heart failure, presence of cardiac arrhythmias or degree of cardiac dysfunction was seen between patients with and without pulmonary embolism. Two-dimensional echocardiography failed to detect the presence of an intracardiac thrombus in four of the six patients. Two patients who developed acute pulmonary infarction are alive after successful heart transplantation. The remaining four patients died within 6 weeks of initiation of anticoagulant therapy before transplantation could safely be performed. In summary, pediatric patients with end-stage congestive heart failure are at risk for acute pulmonary embolism. No specific clinical factor identified those patients who developed acute pulmonary infarction. Anticoagulant therapy is strongly recommended in the pediatric patient with poor ventricular function awaiting heart transplantation. 
The role of chronic viral hepatitis in hepatocellular carcinoma in the United States. Although hepatocellular carcinoma is a relatively uncommon tumor in the United States, it is quite common in sub-Saharan Africa and the Far East, where most cases are associated with infection with the hepatitis B virus. We have studied 99 American patients with hepatocellular carcinoma for evidence of hepatitis B or hepatitis C viral infection and compared these findings to those in a group of matched controls with other cancers. The two groups differed in proportion, with hepatitis B surface antigen in serum being significantly higher in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (7% vs. 0%, p = 0.009). Antibody to hepatitis C virus was also found more frequently in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (13% vs. 2%, p = 0.002). The relative risk for hepatocellular carcinoma in hepatitis B surface antigen-positive patients was calculated to be 17.3 and for antibody to hepatitis C virus to be 7.3. The attributable fraction of cases related to the hepatitis B surface antigen carrier state was 6.7% and for patients infected with the hepatitis C virus was 11.4%. Approximately three quarters of cases of hepatocellular carcinoma did not have evidence of either hepatitis C or hepatitis B virus infection. These findings provide strong evidence that hepatitis C virus infection is associated with the development of hepatocellular carcinoma, and in the United States may even play a more important role than the hepatitis B virus. 
Compartment syndrome complicating prolonged use of the lithotomy position. Two patients with three postoperative calf compartment syndromes, which followed prolonged lithotomy positioning, will be presented. Potential physiologic mechanisms are described, and a review of current cases in literature are summated. 
Chest pain: an evaluation of the initial diagnosis made by 25 Flemish general practitioners. Twenty-five general practitioners collected information on 318 contacts of patients with a new episode of chest pain, discomfort or tightness. A list of complaints, signs and symptoms were checked, together with the initial diagnosis, made by the GP immediately after the physical examination. The initial diagnosis was compared to a follow-up diagnosis. The gain in certainty was also compared. The GP made a correct initial diagnosis in 82% of patients. In 8% there was a clinically important difference, and seven of 17 episodes of oesophageal disease were missed. For their initial diagnosis, the GP scored 74% certain, 20% uncertain and no diagnosis in 6%. For the final diagnosis, these figures were 88%, 8% and 4%. 
Effects of nonionic versus ionic contrast media on complications of percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty. To evaluate the effect of contrast agents on percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA) complications, 913 patients undergoing 1,058 separate PTCA procedures were prospectively randomized to receive either nonionic iopamidol (Isovue-370) [n = 507 PTCA procedures] or ionic contrast media, meglumine sodium diatrizoate (Renografin-76) [n = 551 PTCA procedures]. Angioplasty operators, technicians, nurses and patients were blinded to the agent used. All patients were pretreated with 0.6 mg of atropine sulfate intravenously before any contrast injections. Hypotension (mean arterial pressure less than 65 mm Hg associated with contrast injections) occurred during 8.5% of PTCA procedures in which the patients were receiving iopamidol and during 9.5% of the procedures in which the patients were given diatrizoate (difference not significant). Bradycardia (heart rate of less than 40 beats/min associated with contrast injections) developed during 5.7% of procedures when patients were given iopamidol and during 5.1% of procedures when patients were given diatrizoate (difference not significant). The need for additional atropine or temporary pacing during the procedure was similar for patients given iopamidol and diatrizoate. The overall incidence of ventricular tachycardia or fibrillation, or both, during the procedure occurred less frequently when iopamidol was used compared with diatrizoate (1 vs 2.5%, p = 0.045). These serious ventricular arrhythmias were attributable to contrast injections in 0.6% of the PTCA procedures when iopamidol was given and in 2.0% of the cases in which diatrizoate was the contrast agent (p = 0.09). Only 1 patient had an allergic reaction to the contrast agent, and this was in a patient who received iopamidol. 
Monocrotaline-induced angiogenesis. Differences in the bronchial and pulmonary vasculature. Vascular corrosion casting was used to search for angiogenesis in the blood vessels of the lungs of rats given monocrotaline. Animals treated with monocrotaline had new well-differentiated arteries and veins on their pleural surfaces. Animals not treated had no large vessel on their pleural surfaces. Animals receiving monocrotaline had capillaries around major arteries that were more dense, widened, and less tubular than normal. These capillaries occasionally occurred in sheets and had blind endings. The control animals had delicate, uniform, tubular capillaries. Alveolar capillaries in both groups showed no evidence of increase in size or number or change in shape. Light microscopy confirmed the finding of new vessels found with the casts. The finding of angiogenesis on the pleural surface and in the bronchovascular bundle, but not in the alveolar capillaries, suggests a basic difference in how these capillary beds respond to angiogenic stimuli. If alveolar capillaries are unable to undergo angiogenesis, concepts of lung development and tumor growth may be significantly altered. The lung may be a unique organ to study angiogenesis because of the different angiogenic potential of its two circulations. Study of these differences may lead to better understanding of inhibition of angiogenesis. 
Pancreaticobronchial fistula causing lung abscess: case report and brief discussion of the literature. A case report of a patient with an abscess of the lung caused by a pancreaticobronchial fistula is presented. The patient was treated by pulmonary resection and distal pancreatectomy-splenectomy. 
Valproate-induced coma with ketosis and carnitine insufficiency. We observed two patients who developed coma following administration of valproate in dosages of 32 to 40 mg/kg per day. Valproate levels were within the therapeutic range, and results of liver function studies were normal. Both patients had ketosis and adipic aciduria. Plasma free carnitine levels were decreased during coma and after recovery. One patient excreted ethylmalonic acid, butyrylcarnitine, and glutarylcarnitine during and after resolution of coma, suggesting a multiple acyl coenzyme A dehydrogenation defect. Low serum carnitine levels may predispose patients to development of altered consciousness when treated with valproate. 
The kissing balloon technique with two over-the-wire balloon catheters through a single 8-French guiding catheter. Some of the newer over-the-wire coronary angioplasty catheters have shaft sizes of 3.0 French (F) or less. The inner diameter of modern 8-F guiding catheters is large enough to accommodate two of such balloon catheters. We report a kissing balloon procedure with two over-the-wire catheters through a single 8-F guiding catheter. 
Autotransplantation of dispersed pancreatic islet tissue combined with total or near-total pancreatectomy for treatment of chronic pancreatitis. Chronic pancreatitis is difficult to treat in patients with a nondilated duct. Patients experiencing intractable pain unresponsive to or judged untreatable by lesser procedures must decide between total pancreatectomy and resultant diabetes or a continuation of their pancreatitis. From 1977 through 1990, 26 patients underwent extensive pancreatectomy and dispersed pancreatic islet tissue autotransplantation for treatment of chronic pancreatitis pain and prophylaxis of surgical diabetes. Of these 26 patients, total (Whipple) or near-total (greater than 95%) pancreatectomy was performed in 24 patients. Of these 24 patients, pain relief could be assessed in 21 patients at 5 to 155 months (mean, 5.7 years), and 19 patients (90%) reported partial or complete remission. Of the patients who underwent total or near-total pancreatectomy, islets were injected intraportally in 22 patients and into the renal subcapsule in two patients. The latter two patients have required insulin since surgery. Of the other 22, one patient died from a complication of the pancreatectomy. Nine of the 21 evaluable recipients of intraportal islet autografts were insulin independent for at least several months after surgery. Five patients are currently insulin independent at 6 years, 4 years, 1.5 years, 9 months, and 5 months after surgery. Of the other four patients, one patient died insulin independent at 6 years, and three patients required insulin beginning 8 to 18 months after surgery. Insulin independence correlated with the number of islets recovered, which in turn correlated inversely with the degree of pancreatic fibrosis. Of our four most recent patients, three patients had mildly to moderately fibrotic glands, and higher numbers of islets were obtained. After total (Whipple) pancreatectomy, these three patients are insulin independent. A liver biopsy was performed in one patient 8 months after total pancreatectomy and islet autotransplantation; numerous clusters of islet cells staining strongly for insulin and glucagon were detected within portal triads on both wedge and needle biopsy specimens. Morbidity related to the intraportal-dispersed pancreatic islet tissue transplantation was low (no disseminated intravascular coagulation, significant portal hypertension, or hepatic dysfunction). Islet autotransplantation can be an effective and safe adjunct to extensive pancreatic resection for those patients who risk surgical diabetes for relief of their chronic pancreatitis pain. 
Recombinant tissue-type plasminogen activator followed by heparin compared with heparin alone for refractory unstable angina pectoris. Patients with unstable angina pectoris who remain symptomatic despite medical treatment are at high risk of death and myocardial infarction. The incidence of refractory unstable angina was examined in a consecutive series of 103 patients who received conventional medical treatment with nitrates, beta blockers, calcium antagonists and aspirin. During 48 hours of continuous electrocardiographic monitoring, 24 patients had greater than or equal to 1 anginal attack, 5 of whom had both painful and painless ischemic episodes. In these 24 patients with unstable angina refractory to conventional medical treatment, the short-term efficacy of recombinant tissue-type plasminogen activator (rt-PA) followed by heparin was assessed and compared with heparin alone in a randomized double-blind trial. Recurrences of ischemic attacks during a 72-hour follow-up period were documented in 9 of the 12 patients given heparin alone. All patients experienced at least 1 symptomatic ischemic episode and 1 patient had both painful and painless ischemia. No patient given rt-PA plus heparin had either symptomatic or asymptomatic ischemic attacks during follow-up. Kaplan-Meier curves analysis demonstrated a significantly higher probability of being ischemia free in the group of patients treated with rt-PA followed by heparin than in the group treated with heparin alone (p less than 0.01). Quantitative coronary arteriography failed to reveal any significant changes of ischemia-related lesions before and after each treatment. This study demonstrates that the combination of rt-PA and heparin has a greater protective effect than heparin alone in treating recurrent ischemic episodes in patients with refractory unstable angina. 
Preoperative high-dose leucovorin/5-fluorouracil and radiation therapy for unresectable rectal cancer. Twenty patients with primary or recurrent unresectable rectal cancer limited to the pelvis were entered on a Phase I trial of preoperative pelvic radiation therapy (RT) (5040 cGy) and two cycles of combined high-dose leucovorin (LV) and 5-fluorouracil (5-FU), followed by surgery and ten cycles of postoperative LV/5-FU (sequential). Maximum tolerated doses (MTD) were determined for preoperative combined LV/5-FU and RT and for postoperative sequential LV/5-FU. 5-FU was escalated 50 mg/m2 while the LV remained constant at 200 mg/m2. The initial doses of 5-FU were combined LV/5-FU and RT (200 mg/m2) and sequential LV/5-FU (325 mg/m2). The median follow-up time was 14 months. The resectability rate was 89%, and the pathologic complete response rate was 21%. The MTD for combined LV/5-FU and RT was 300 mg/m2; therefore, the recommended dose of 5-FU is 250 mg/m2. The recommended dose of 5-FU for sequential LV/5-FU is 375 mg/m2. The dose-limiting toxicities in this trial were diarrhea, tenesmus, increased bowel movements, dysuria, and myelosuppression. For the six patients who received 5-FU at the recommended dose level, the median low counts were leukocyte count, 3.7/microliters (range, 2.4 to 4.9/microliters); hemoglobin, 9.0 g/dl (range, 8.2 to 11.9 g/dl); and platelet count (X1000), 146/microliters (range, 89 to 182/microliters). The incidence rate of any Grade 3 toxicity was 17% (diarrhea and frequent bowel movements). The recommended doses of 5-FU used in this protocol were well tolerated. Because there was a long delay before optimal doses of 5-FU could be delivered, the authors do not recommend that high-dose LV be used in conjunction with combined 5-FU and RT with the treatment regimen as currently designed. However, because the resectability and complete response rates were higher than those previously reported for preoperative RT alone, the authors are encouraged by the combined technique approach. New trials are currently being undertaken to determine if the use of a low-dose LV regimen is more tolerable. 
Siriraj stroke score and validation study to distinguish supratentorial intracerebral haemorrhage from infarction. OBJECTIVES--To develop a simple, reliable, and safe diagnostic tool for acute stroke syndromes in a setting where computerised brain scanning was not readily available and to validate its accuracy with regard to pathological types of stroke. DESIGN--13 clinical variables that potentially might differentiate supratentorial cerebral haemorrhage from infarction were recorded and tested by multivariate analysis in a prospective study of 174 patients with acute stroke. In developing the Siriraj stroke score stepwise discriminant analysis of the variables was followed by a linear discriminant equation to differentiate between supratentorial haemorrhage and infarction. The score obtained was validated against scores in 206 other patients with stroke, computerised brain scans being used for definitive diagnosis. SETTING--Siriraj Hospital Medical School, Mahidol University, Bangkok. SUBJECTS--Prospective study: 174 consecutive patients with acute supratentorial stroke syndrome (not subarachnoid haemorrhage) admitted to Siriraj Hospital during 1984-5; validation study: 206 patients admitted to Siriraj Hospital or another hospital for supratentorial intracerebral haemorrhage or infarction. RESULTS--The Siriraj stroke score was developed and calculated as (2.5 x level of consciousness) + (2 x vomiting) + (2 x headache) + (0.1 x diastolic blood pressure) - (3 x atheroma markers) - 12. A score above 1 indicates supratentorial intracerebral haemorrhage, while a score below -1 indicates infarction. The score between 1 and -1 represents an equivocal result needing a computerised brain scan or probability curve to verify the diagnosis. In the validation study of the Siriraj stroke score the diagnostic sensitivities of the score for cerebral haemorrhage and cerebral infarction were 89.3% and 93.2% respectively, with an overall predictive accuracy of 90.3%. CONCLUSION--The Siriraj stroke score is widely accepted and applied in hospitals throughout Thailand as a simple and reliable bedside method for diagnosing acute stroke. 
Differential modulation by the stress axis of ethanol withdrawal seizure expression in WSP and WSR mice. Withdrawal from both acute and chronic ethanol (EtOH) exposure is associated with increased neural excitability and increased activity of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis. There is some evidence that glucocorticoids are necessary for EtOH withdrawal seizure expression. Lines of mice that were selected for severe (WSP) and minimal (WSR) EtOH withdrawal (as estimated from handling-induced convulsion scores) have been shown to differ in their stress response following an acute dose of EtOH. In this study we provide evidence that these lines of mice also differ in their sensitivity to the excitatory effects of glucocorticoids. EtOH withdrawal seizures of WSP mice were significantly increased by chronic and acute corticosterone treatment, whereas those of the WSR mice were unaffected. Neural excitability was decreased in the WSP mice when aminoglutethimide, a glucocorticoid synthesis blocker, was administered. Thus, it appears that genetic differences in EtOH withdrawal seizure severity may be due, in part, to differences in sensitivity to the excitatory effects of glucocorticoids. 
Treatment of critically ill patients with sepsis of unknown cause: value of percutaneous cholecystostomy. Because of the difficulty in diagnosing acute cholecystitis in critically ill patients with severe intercurrent illness by clinical and imaging methods or percutaneous aspiration of the gallbladder, a trial of percutaneous cholecystostomy was performed in 24 patients in the intensive-care unit with persistent, unexplained sepsis after a complete clinical, laboratory, and radiologic search showed no alternative source of infection. Persistent high fevers, despite antibiotic therapy, were present in all patients, with elevated WBC count in 18 patients, vague abdominal tenderness in 11, and septic shock requiring vasopressors in 15. Sonographically, all patients had distended, spherical gallbladders, six had gallstones, eight had wall thickening, three had pericholecystic fluid, and four had Murphy's sign. All patients were seen by a senior abdominal surgeon, who agreed to a trial of percutaneous cholecystostomy. Fourteen patients (58%) responded to percutaneous cholecystostomy, as evidenced by a decrease in WBC count, defervescence, and the ability to be weaned off vasopressors. Bile cultures were positive in four patients. Ten patients (42%) did not respond to percutaneous cholecystostomy; five eventually died of unrelated causes. A respiratory source of infection was eventually found in three of these 10 patients, with no proved source of infection in the remainder. No complications related to catheter insertion occurred in this group of patients. Bile leaks occurred in two patients when the percutaneous cholecystostomy catheter was removed, but without serious consequence. Our experience suggests that a lower threshold for performing percutaneous cholecystostomy in this difficult clinical subset of patients is worthwhile. 
Impaired formation of the ternary insulin-like growth factor-binding protein complex in patients with hypoglycemia due to nonislet cell tumors. In some subjects with hypoglycemia associated with tumors of mesenchymal origin, high insulin-like growth factor-II (IGF-II) levels have been described in serum and in the tumors. Tumor IGF-II of 10-15 kDa circulates in a 60-kDa complex, in contrast to the ternary 150-kDa complex in which serum IGFs normally circulate together with the IGF-binding subunit (IGFBP-3) and the acid-labile subunit (alpha-subunit). This study examines the molecular distribution and complex-forming activity of the components of the ternary complex in the serum of subjects with mesenchymal tumor hypoglycemia. Total serum IGFBP-3 levels were 60% of normal in tumor patients and appeared at 60 kDa on gel chromatography, shifting after tumor removal to 150 kDa. Total alpha-subunit levels were 40% of normal in patients with tumors, increasing after tumor removal to 70% of normal and changing in elution profile from a peak typical of uncomplexed alpha-subunit to the normal broad peak representing both complexed and uncomplexed alpha-subunit. Although low by RIA, alpha-subunit activity in a ternary complex formation assay was normal, indicating that the ability of free alpha-subunit in the patients' circulation to combine with exogenous IGFBP-3 plus IGF-I was not impaired. In contrast, in an assay that tested the ability of IGF-IGFBP complexes in the patients' circulation to combine with pure alpha-subunit, complex formation activity was 75-85% below normal in preoperative sera, despite low normal IGFBP-3 levels. Therefore, the cause of hypoglycemia in these patients may be the inability of complexes between the abnormal tumor IGF-II and IGFBP-3 to be sequestered in the biologically inactive ternary complex. 
The significance of portal vein thrombosis after distal splenorenal shunt. The aims of this study were to determine the incidence of portal vein thrombosis after the distal splenorenal shunt, to identify any predictive factors, and to assess the clinical significance of this complication. Preoperative and postoperative angiograms and clinical evaluation were reviewed in 124 patients who underwent distal splenorenal shunts. Total and partial portal vein thrombosis were seen on 13 (10.5%) and 22 (17.7%) postoperative angiograms, respectively. The only preoperative variable correlating with development of portal vein thrombosis was portal venous perfusion, which was significantly lower in patients with than in those without portal vein thrombosis. In six of 10 patients with postoperative pancreatitis, portal vein thrombosis developed. The frequency of early postoperative complications was significantly greater in patients with total portal vein thrombosis than in those with partial or no thrombosis. Long-term follow-up has shown no significant effects of portal vein thrombosis on late ascites, encephalopathy, or survival. 
Iatrogenic epidermoid cyst of the parotid region following ear surgery. Iatrogenic implantation of squamous epithelium may result in formation of an epidermoid cyst. These cysts have been described in various sites around the head and neck following otological procedures. A case of iatrogenic epidermal cyst in the parotid region following repeated myringoplasty is reported. The clinical features and differential diagnosis are discussed. 
Fatal and other major complications of endoscopic sinus surgery. Endoscopic sinus surgery has become an acceptable technique for the treatment of chronic sinus disease. This report analyzes five complications which came to my attention. Two cases were orbital:1 bilateral blindness due to damage of the optic nerves, and 1 damage of medial rectus muscle. The other 3 cases were intracranial:two cribriform plate damage with frontal lobe injury and hematoma, and 1 damage of the anterior cerebral artery, resulting in death. This rather novel technique, especially when used by less-experienced surgeons, has major complications similar to what has been reported with the traditional intranasal sphenoethmoidectomy. Knowledge of anatomy, good training, and meticulous surgical technique are very important. Endoscopic sinus surgery in patients with extensive pathology should be used with caution, especially if general anesthesia is selected or if excessive bleeding occurs. It would be beneficial to otolaryngologists to have previous experience in the traditional technique before adopting endoscopic sinus surgery to their armamentarium. Even then, major complications may occur in the hands of very experienced surgeons. Early recognition and proper management of these complications are of utmost importance in order to minimize disability or prevent death. 
Brachial plexus anesthesia for outpatient surgical procedures on an upper extremity We retrospectively reviewed 543 brachial plexus blocks performed on 526 outpatients. Most (98%) of the blocks were performed by means of the axillary approach. Various techniques were used, including paresthesia, transarterial fixation, nerve stimulation, or a combination of techniques; a high success rate was achieved with each of them. Only 7% of the blocks were incomplete and thus necessitated either general anesthesia or block supplementation with thiopental sodium and nitrous oxide. No persistent neurologic deficit was ascribed to the anesthetic technique. This review indicates that brachial plexus block, especially with use of the axillary approach, is a safe and effective option for outpatient surgical procedures on an upper extremity. 
Valproate-induced coma with ketosis and carnitine insufficiency. We observed two patients who developed coma following administration of valproate in dosages of 32 to 40 mg/kg per day. Valproate levels were within the therapeutic range, and results of liver function studies were normal. Both patients had ketosis and adipic aciduria. Plasma free carnitine levels were decreased during coma and after recovery. One patient excreted ethylmalonic acid, butyrylcarnitine, and glutarylcarnitine during and after resolution of coma, suggesting a multiple acyl coenzyme A dehydrogenation defect. Low serum carnitine levels may predispose patients to development of altered consciousness when treated with valproate. 
Flecainide acetate treatment of paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia and paroxysmal atrial fibrillation: dose-response studies. The Flecainide Supraventricular Tachycardia Study Group. The dose-response relations for efficacy and tolerance of the antiarrhythmic drug flecainide acetate were studied in 28 patients with paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia (Group 1) and 45 patients with paroxysmal atrial fibrillation or flutter (Group 2). Recurrent symptomatic tachycardia was documented with use of transtelephonic electrocardiographic recording. Patients received flecainide in doses of 25, 50, 100 and 150 mg twice daily and placebo for 1 month treatment periods. Among 14 patients in Group 1 who qualified for efficacy analysis, 4 (29%) had no tachycardia while taking placebo. The number with no tachycardia increased with progressively larger flecainide doses; with the 150 mg twice daily dose, 12 (86%) of 14 patients had no tachycardia (p less than 0.01 for overall differences among all treatments). Among 28 patients in Group 2, 2 (7%) had no tachycardia while taking placebo. The number with no tachycardia also increased with progressively larger flecainide doses; with the 150 mg twice daily dose, 17 (61%) of 28 patients had no tachycardia (p less than 0.01 for overall differences among all treatments). Noncardiac adverse experiences were the leading cause of premature study discontinuation during flecainide treatment periods (five patients in Group 1 and six patients in Group 2). 
Effects of H1-antihistamine drug regimen on histamine release by nonlesional skin mast cells of patients with chronic urticaria. Profiles of compound 48/80-induced histamine release (HR) from mast cells of uninvolved skin from patients with chronic urticaria (CU) and from a normal control (NC) group were compared, and the effects of anti-H1 medications were assessed versus placebo. Then, patients with CU (15) and NC subjects (10) were randomly assigned to take either hydroxyzine (100 mg/day), terfenadine (120 mg/day), or placebo for 28 days. The effects of such treatment on the clinical response and on the profile of compound 48/80-induced HR during a 4-hour period were analyzed. Treatment with hydroxyzine in patients with CU improved the clinical symptoms and modified the profile of HR; more histamine was recovered at 1 hour (p less than 0.05) and 2 hours (p less than 0.05), as compared with baseline. Terfenadine and placebo had no effect on the clinical response or on the profiles of HR. In the NC group, the amounts of histamine recovered at 1 hour after challenge with compound 48/80 were lower than amounts of the pretherapy values (p less than 0.01). It could be concluded that (1) the profile of HR in patients with CU is reproducible during a period of 28 days, (2) only hydroxyzine modifies both the clinical response and the profile of HR, and (3) anti-H1 compounds decrease the HR in the NC group. 
Lysis of intraventricular hematoma with tissue plasminogen activator. Case report. A 42-year-old woman suffered a severe intracerebral and intraventricular hemorrhage from a ruptured anterior cerebral artery aneurysm. Evacuation of the frontal hematoma and clipping of the aneurysm was performed but the intraventricular blood clot persisted, causing ventricular dilatation and high intracranial pressure (ICP) 24 hours after surgery despite external ventricular drainage. Over this period of time the patient's clinical condition improved from Grade V to Grade IVb (World Federation of Neurological Surgeons classification). The intraventricular hematoma was lysed with a total of 8 mg recombinant tissue plasminogen activator injected directly into the ventricles on the 1st and 2nd postoperative days, resulting in rapid normalization of ventricular size and ICP. The patient has since made a substantial recovery and has been able to return home. 
Neurophysiological observations on the effects of botulinum toxin treatment in patients with dystonic blepharospasm. Botulinum toxin treatment improves dystonic blepharospasm by inducing transient paresis of the orbicularis oculi muscle. It is not known if it also reduces the enhanced brainstem neuronal excitability found in this disorder. We have performed conventional electromyography (EMG) and blink reflex excitability studies on fifteen patients with blepharospasm before and after botulinum toxin treatment. Denervation signs were found with needle EMG in all treated muscles. Amplitude of the facial compound muscle action potential (CMAP) and R1 response was reduced after botulinum toxin injections. In blink reflex excitability studies, the recovery of R2 response was enhanced after treatment even when patients were tested at the time of maximal benefit from botulinum toxin injections. The results suggest that there is little influence of botulinum toxin treatment upon the enhanced excitability of brainstem interneurons in patients with blepharospasm. 
Quadrilateral space syndrome: diagnosis and operative decompression technique. We present a series of five patients with quadrilateral space syndrome. All patients had the diagnosis made on the basis of (1) tenderness over the quadrilateral space, (2) paresthesia over the lateral shoulder and upper posterior arm, and (3) deltoid weakness associated with decreased shoulder abduction. A history of trauma was present in each patient. The operative technique described utilizes a cosmetically acceptable incision and is without the need to divide the deltoid from its origin on the scapular spine. The technique minimizes postoperative bleeding and facilities rehabilitation. Arteriography of the posterior circumflex humeral artery was not found necessary to make the diagnosis of axillary nerve entrapment in the quadrilateral space. 
Comparative efficacy and safety of intravenous and oral administration of a TRH analogue (RX77368) in motor neuron disease. Ten consecutive patients with motor neuron disease (MND) who had bulbar symptoms received one or two intravenous doses followed by increasing oral doses of a TRH analogue (RX77368). Similar improvements in speech, swallowing and in tongue and jaw movements were seen after iv and oral administration in nine, five and eight patients respectively. The initial time course of improvement correlated with increasing plasma levels of the drug, but most clinical effects persisted when the levels decreased and became undetectable after 24 hours. The oral solution was tasteless and had no, or minimal, side effects. 
Chagas' cardioneuropathy: effect of ganglioside treatment in chronic dysautonomic patients--a randomized, double-blind, parallel, placebo-controlled study. To date, there is no effective pharmacologic treatment for Chagas' cardioneuropathy, one of the most common causes of congestive heart failure and sudden death in the world. Fifty-eight adults with positive serology for Chagas' disease and abnormal autonomic nervous system tests participated in this placebo-controlled clinical trial with Cronassial (mixed gangliosides), 40 mg daily intramuscular injection for 4 or 8 weeks. We measured postural response (heart rate, systolic and diastolic arterial blood pressure changes in response to standing); heart rate changes induced by cough and hyperventilation reflex tests; dizziness on standing; number of stress-induced arrhythmias; and periodic acid-Schiff (PAS)-positive T-lymphocyte percentage in blood samples. Cronassial is safe and significantly improves systolic blood pressure (p = 0.050) and double product responses to postural stress (p = 0.028), hyperventilation heart rate response (p = 0.007), frequency of dizziness episodes (p less than 0.001), number of arrhythmias (p = 0.033), and percentage of PAS-positive T-lymphocyte counts (p less than 0.001) compared with placebo. 
Midline craniectomy for sagittal suture synostosis: comparative efficacy of two barriers to calvarial reclosure. This report quantitatively compares long-term head remolding achieved by two methods for retarding bone reunion after midline craniectomy for sagittal suture synostosis. In one group of six children the adjacent bone edges were overlayed with 1.0-cm-wide U-channel silicone strips, and in the other group, composed of seven patients, a considerably larger extent of the adjacent cranium was covered with silicone sheets. Mean percent change in the cephalic indices of the former group 18 months postoperatively was 9.1% +/- S.D. = 6.7, and of the latter group 23.7% +/- S.D. = 6.0 (p congruent to 0.01). These results indicate that the use of large silicone sheets lead to a significantly greater normalization of cranial proportions. 
Hiccups (singultus): review and approach to management. Hiccups are a common, and fortunately usually transient, benign malady. Occasionally, however, hiccups fail to resolve spontaneously, resulting in patient fatigue and incapacitation and the need for the affected individual to seek medical care for resolution of the problem. The approach to the management of these patients consists of the identification and treatment of serious underlying causes of the episode as well as therapeutic interventions to achieve hiccup resolution. 
The localization and distribution of corticotropin-releasing hormone in the human placenta and fetal membranes throughout gestation. Using immunohistochemical techniques, we have determined the localization and distribution of CRH immunoreactivity (CRH-IR) in the human placenta, fetal membranes, decidua, and umbilical cord. Tissues were obtained at 6-8 weeks of pregnancy, at term, in association with premature birth, and from patients with pregnancy-induced hypertension or diabetes mellitus. A polyclonal antibody to the epithelial cell marker cytokeratin was used to identify trophoblast cells. CRH-IR was not detected in placenta or decidua at 6-8 weeks gestation. In tissues obtained after idiopathic premature delivery after 21 weeks gestation, positive CRH staining was found in placenta in syncytiotrophoblast and intermediate trophoblast, but not cytotrophoblast. CRH-IR was present in intermediate trophoblast cells that had invaded maternal blood vessels in decidua basalis. In the fetal membranes, CRH-IR was localized in the epithelium and subepithelial cells of amnion, in the trophoblast layer, in some cells of the reticular and cellular layers of chorion, and in some stromal cells and invasive trophoblast cells of decidua. CRH-IR was found in the amniotic epithelium of the umbilical cord and in the musculature of the umbilical vessels. This pattern of distribution of CRH-IR was found in tissues from 21 weeks gestation to term and postterm, and was similar in tissues examined from patients with pregnancy-induced hypertension and diabetes mellitus. These results show clearly that in placenta and membranes, CRH is localized primarily to syncytiotrophoblast and intermediate trophoblast, but not to cytotrophoblast cells. We suggest that the localization of CRH-IR is consistent with CRH affecting paracrine/autocrine interactions within the placenta, fetal membranes, and decidua that may be involved in the maturation of the fetal hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis and in the stimulus and maintainance of labor. 
The relationship among canine brain temperature, metabolism, and function during hypothermia. Cerebral protection by hypothermia is commonly attributed to cerebral metabolic suppression. However, at temperatures below 28 degrees C, the relationship of temperature to cerebral metabolic rate of oxygen consumption (CMRO2) has not been well characterized. Accordingly, the relationship between brain temperature and CMRO2 was determined in eight dogs during cooling from 37 to 14 degrees C while the EEG was continuously monitored. Cardiopulmonary bypass was initiated and control measurements were made at 37 degrees C during anesthesia with nitrous oxide 50-60% inspired and morphine sulfate 2 mg.kg-1 intravenously (iv). Upon cooling to 27 degrees C, the nitrous oxide was discontinued and the morphine was antagonized with naloxone 2 mg iv. Measurements were repeated at 27, 22, 18, and 14 degrees C and in four dogs again at 37 degrees C after nitrous oxide 50-60% had been reestablished at 27 degrees C along with administration of morphine sulfate 2 mg.kg-1. For each temperature interval, the temperature coefficient (Q10) for CMRO2 was calculated (Q10 = CMRO2 at x degrees C divided by CMRO2 at [x - 10] degrees C). Between 37 and 27 degrees C the Q10 was 2.23, but between 27 and 14 degrees C the mean Q10 was doubled to 4.53. With rewarming to 37 degrees C, CBF and CMRO2 returned to control levels, and brain biopsies revealed a normal brain energy state. During cooling, the EEG developed burst suppression at or below 22 degrees C. With further cooling, the periods of suppression increased; however, burst activity continued in seven of eight dogs even at 14 degrees C. 
Prognostic factors for local recurrence in the conservatively treated breast cancer patient: a cautious interpretation of the data. Between 1962 and 1984, a total of 433 patients were treated at Yale-New Haven Hospital with conservative surgery and radiation therapy (CS + RT) to the intact breast. As of January 1990, with a minimum assessable follow-up of 5 years and a median follow-up of 8.21 years, there have been a total of 50 breast recurrences resulting in a 5-year actuarial breast recurrence rate of 8%. Of all clinical factors tested, young age was the most significant prognostic factor for local recurrence (P less than .03). In addition, patients with pathologically involved lymph nodes were noted to have a lower local recurrence rate than patients with pathologically negative axillae (P less than .05). These findings were especially notable given the fact that the node-positive group had a higher percentage of T2 tumors and a higher percentage of patients in the young age group. These paradoxical findings, however, may be explained by the fact that 88% of the node-positive patients underwent adjuvant systemic therapy in the form of either systemic chemotherapy or hormonal therapy, while only 8% of node-negative patients underwent any adjuvant systemic therapy. When analyzed as a function of adjuvant therapy, those patients receiving adjuvant therapy had a lower local recurrence rate than those patients not receiving adjuvant therapy (P less than .08). We conclude that adjuvant systemic therapy impacts on the ipsilateral breast recurrence rate in patients treated with CS + RT. The implications of this study in light of the widespread use of adjuvant systemic therapy are discussed. 
Pathophysiology of sciatica. The exact pathophysiologic mechanisms behind sciatica are incompletely known; however, compression of spinal nerve roots is known to be correlated to both pain and neural dysfunction in a segmental distribution of that specific nerve root. Compression per se may impair the transport of nutrients to the nerve tissue in such a way that affects the nerve root function. There also might be a local affect on nerve roots or root sleeves by substances leaking from the degenerated intervertebral discs. 
Surgical management of extracranial vertebral artery occlusive disease. Thirty-seven consecutive patients underwent vertebral artery (VA) reconstruction over a 6 years period (1983-1989). Detailed neurologic, medical, and angiographic information was obtained for all patients. Indications for surgery were as follows: (1) stenosis of VA with symptoms of vertebrobasilar insufficiency; (2) very tight stenosis (greater than 75%) of the dominant VA with stenosis or occlusion of the contralateral VA; (3) very tight stenosis of VA with bilateral occlusion of the internal carotid artery (ICA); (4) very tight stenosis of VA with homolateral ICA lesion eligible for simultaneous repair; (5) very tight stenosis of VA and very tight stenosis of the homo or contralateral carotid siphon. There were 15 isolated vertebral lesions (group I), and 22 were VA lesions associated with lesions of the supraaortic trunks which were simultaneously treated (group II). The reconstructions of the first portion of the VA were 30 (12 of group I and 18 of group II) and reimplantation of the VA into the common carotid artery was the procedure of choice. There were 7 revascularizations of the third portion of the VA at C1-C2 level (3 of group I and 4 of group II): carotid-vertebral bypass, using an autogenous vein graft, was the procedure of choice. Three patients in group II died in the immediate postoperative period from myocardial infarction but no patient presented immediate postoperative neurologic deficits. All symptomatic patients but one were relieved of their symptoms in a median follow-up of 31 months. No postoperative complications were observed. Long-term results were satisfactory in all the 28 patients at their last follow-up visit. 
Transesophageal color Doppler echocardiography of the normal St. Jude Medical mitral valve prosthesis. Transesophageal color flow Doppler findings are reported in 36 patients with a St. Jude Medical mechanical mitral valve prosthesis who had no auscultatory evidence for prosthetic valve dysfunction. Multiple jets consistent with mitral regurgitation originating from the central and lateral portion of the prosthesis were found in all patients. Maximum jet length ranged from 11 to 51 mm (mean 21 +/- 9 mm). Maximum jet area ranged from 0.2 to 4.1 cm3 (mean 1.2 +/- 0.9 cm2). The color M-mode Doppler interrogation showed two distinct components of the regurgitant jet: brief early systolic flow consistent with valve closure followed by holosystolic regurgitant flow consistent with transvalvular leakage. Four patients (11%) had a maximum regurgitant jet length exceeding 30 mm and absence of early systolic closure regurgitant flow by M-mode color imaging, suggesting clinically silent paravalvular leakage. Two pin-sized paravalvular suture line defects were confirmed in one patient at cardiac transplantation. We conclude that transesophageal echocardiography is a highly sensitive method for detection of mitral regurgitation in the St. Jude Medical mitral prosthesis. Clinically silent paravalvular leakage should be suspected if the maximum jet length exceeds 30 mm and color M-mode interrogation fails to demonstrate an early systolic closure regurgitant flow component. 
Factors in recent reductions in liver cirrhosis deaths. Since the mid-1970s, there have been substantial declines in liver cirrhosis deaths in many Western countries following a long period of increases. There is variability in the pattern of changes observed: in a sample of 29 countries between 1974 and 1982-83, seven countries showed a significant linear decline, three revealed a curvilinear pattern, increases were observed in six and the rest (13) showed no notable changes. Although reductions in per capita consumption of alcohol may be a contributing factor, these reductions do not seem to account for all of the decreases in cirrhosis deaths that have been observed. Among other factors that might contribute, changes or increases in treatment for alcohol abuse and AA membership have been most strongly linked to these declines; changes in patterns of consumption, dietary habits, prevention efforts and reduced exposure to predisposing factors may also be involved. In view of the importance of these declines for the understanding and prevention of alcohol problems, further research on this issue, perhaps involving international collaborative studies, is needed. 
Ultrastructural study of glandular epithelium in adenomyosis in comparison with those of proliferative endometrium and well-differentiated endometrial cancer. Adenomyotic glandular tissue from five patients underwent electron microscopic investigation to observe its ultrastructural characteristics. The adenomyotic epithelium was compared with that of proliferative normal epithelium (two patients) and well-differentiated endometrial adenocarcinoma (two patients). The results revealed that morphologically the adenomyotic glandular epithelium is somewhat less differentiated than proliferative endometrium and that its cytoplasmic organelles have some similarities with those of endometrial cancer. Whether these similarities predispose the adenomyotic glandular tissue to malignant degeneration remains to be elucidated. 
Initial clinical experience with a 48 by 48 element biplane transesophageal probe. Recent technologic advances in ultrasound have resulted in the capability of transesophageal echocardiographic imaging in both transverse and longitudinal planes. Previous biplane probes suffered from inferior images because of reduced scan elements. We evaluated the utility of a prototype 48 X 48 element biplane transesophageal probe in 23 consecutive patients. Examinations were well tolerated with no side effects. In comparison to the single transverse plane, imaging with the longitudinal plane gave superior information on prosthetic valve pathology, atrial septal abnormalities, and pathoanatomy of the ascending aorta and mitral valve. Complementary information was provided by the longitudinal plane in patients with endocarditis and vegetations and in mitral protheses. Images obtained with this 48 X 48 element biplane probe along with color and spectral Doppler information were not perceptibly inferior to those obtained by single-plane probes. In conclusion, biplane transesophageal echocardiography with a 48 X 48 element probe indicates a great potential for enhanced three-dimensional understanding of cardiac pathology and diagnostic yield in specific pathologies. 
Klippel-Trenaunay syndrome: the risks and benefits of vascular interventions. Our experience with Klippel-Trenaunay syndrome (KTS), a rare congenital malformation, has increased considerably in recent years and now includes 144 patients (65 male and 79 female patients). Hemangioma was present in 137 patients (95.1%), varicosity in 110 (76.4%), and hypertrophy of the soft tissues or bones in 134 (93.1%). In most patients (71.5%) the disease involved one lower extremity. Diagnostic workup included roentgenogram to document limb length discrepancy, noninvasive arterial and venous evaluation, contrast venography, and nuclear magnetic resonance imaging. Most patients did well without treatment or with elastic compression only. Surgical treatment for the vascular malformation in KTS is rarely needed and it continues to be controversial. To evaluate the risks and benefits of vascular interventions, we examined in detail the clinical histories of nine patients who in the last decade underwent operation for a vascular malformation of the lower extremity. In seven patients we removed varicose veins or resected hemangioma of the lower extremity. Although none was cured, all five who underwent resection of varicose veins and one of the two patients who underwent resection of a hemangioma improved. Two additional patients, however, who underwent resection of varicose veins in another institution had worsening of the symptoms. In one patient we performed deep venous reconstruction for atresia of the superficial femoral vein, using the contralateral saphenous vein. Such operation in KTS has not been reported previously. The patient has a patent graft with a competent valve and clinical improvement 6 months after the operation. Although patients with severe chronic venous insufficiency, disturbing cosmetic appearance, or complications of hemangioma may benefit from surgical treatment, detailed preoperative imaging of the extremity and pelvis with magnetic resonance imaging and contrast venography is needed to decrease complications. Rarely, reconstruction for atresia or hypoplasia of the deep veins may be needed. 
Role of platelet function in symptomatic cerebral vasospasm following aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage. To evaluate the role of platelet function in the pathogenesis of cerebral vasospasm, we compared sequential changes of platelet aggregability and beta-thromboglobulin and thromboxane B2 concentrations in blood samples from the internal jugular and peripheral vein of 13 patients with aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage. Platelet function in blood from the internal jugular vein tended to be enhanced during days 0-1 but recovered to the normal range during days 2-4. After day 5, platelet function showed various patterns depending on the presence of symptomatic vasospasm. In patients without symptomatic vasospasm, sequential changes were relatively minor, with normal or slightly high values. Patients with symptomatic vasospasm already showed high platelet aggregability during the early stage of vasospasm. The concentration of beta-thromboglobulin increased several days after the onset of vasospasm, reaching 80 ng/ml or more in patients with a poor prognosis. Two of the five patients with symptomatic vasospasm showed markedly high concentrations of thromboxane B2 after day 8. These results suggest that vasospasm activates platelets and promotes aggregability and that the resulting increased tendency for thrombus formation may affect the patient's prognosis during the advanced stage. 
The use of releasable sutures in Molteno glaucoma implant procedures to reduce postoperative hypotony. We used releasable sutures to minimize immediate postoperative hypotony and flat anterior chamber in 19 cases of refractory glaucoma requiring insertion of a single-plate Molteno implant in a one-stage procedure. A slip knot using 7-0 nylon suture was fashioned around the Molteno tube under a lamellar scleral flap. In 18 of the 19 eyes, anterior chamber depth was normal immediately after surgery. 
Prevention of vasospasm by clot removal and intrathecal bolus injection of tissue-type plasminogen activator: preliminary report. In this study, we evaluated the efficacy of postoperative intrathecal injections of tissue-type plasminogen activator (tPA) in preventing cerebral vasospasm in cases with a diffuse severe subarachnoid hemorrhage. All 10 cases were graded Group 3 according to the classification of Fisher and associates, and the CT number (Hounsfield number) of the subarachnoid clot was over 75. After clipping the aneurysm and removing the clot, three cisternal drainage catheters were inserted into both sylvian cisterns and the prepontine cistern, and continuous ventricular drainage was performed routinely. Postoperatively, tPA (0.5 mg/2.5 ml) was infused as a bolus into both basal cisterns and the lateral ventricle twice daily for about 6 days. Angiography and cerebral blood flow studies using single photon emission computed tomography were performed on Day 4 or 5 and between Days 7 and 10 after onset of the hemorrhage. To date, there have been no cases that have shown angiographic vasospasm or delayed ischemic neurological deficits. This preliminary study indicates that the intrathecal bolus injection of tPA produces a marked effect on vasospasm. 
Assessment of current International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics staging of vulvar carcinoma relative to prognostic factors for survival (a Gynecologic Oncology Group study). Analysis of 588 patients with vulvar carcinoma delineated four risk groups by the proportional hazards model. Groin node status (laterality and number positive) and lesion diameter were the only two important independent prognostic factors. The 5-year relative survival rates were 98%, 87%, 75%, and 29% for the risk group categories of minimal (negative groin nodes and lesion diameter less than or equal to 2 cm), low (one positive groin node and lesion diameter less than or equal to 2 cm or negative groin nodes and fewer than two lesions less than or equal to 8 cm diameter), intermediate (negative groin nodes and lesion diameter greater than 8 cm diameter, one positive groin node and lesion diameter greater than 2 cm, or two unilaterally positive groin nodes and lesion diameter less than or equal to 8 cm), and high (three or more positive groin nodes or two bilaterally positive groin nodes), respectively. Applying the International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics staging (1988) to these data discriminated risk of death (caused by recurrent vulvar cancer); the 5-year rates were 98%, 85%, 74%, and 31% for stages I, II, III, and IV, respectively. However, within International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics stage III there were 47 low-, 95 intermediate-, and 28 high-risk patients with relative survivals of 95%, 74%, and 34%, respectively. Overall, this assessment validates current International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics vulvar carcinoma staging, but further refinements are warranted in stage III. 
Ictal 99mTc-HMPAO SPECT in alternating hemiplegia. 99mTc-hexamethylpropylenamine oxime (99mTc-HMPAO) single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) was performed in a patient with alternating hemiplegia during 2 episodes of the disease. The regional cerebral blood flow patterns correlated with the clinical manifestations during both episodes. Hyperperfusion of the contralateral hemisphere was suggested by asymmetric 99mTc-HMPAO uptake, whereas symmetric 123I-N-isopropyl-p-iodoamphetamine uptake was detected during the interictal period. The results suggested that alternating hemiplegia in infants represents an atypical manifestation of epilepsy, despite the lack of paroxysmal electroencephalographic abnormalities during the episodes. 99mTc-HMPAO SPECT appears to be a useful method for detecting transient regional cerebral blood flow alterations during paroxysmal events because the tracer is rapidly available for emergencies and retains a fixed distribution for 5-8 hours, sufficient time to allow for SPECT acquisition. 
Native valve Staphylococcus epidermidis endocarditis: report of seven cases and review of the literature. This report describes seven patients from three university hospitals whose native valve infective endocarditis was caused by Staphylococcus epidermidis. The literature on endocarditis caused by S. epidermidis is also reviewed and the clinical features of patients with native valve endocarditis due to this organism are compared with those of patients from a general series of infective endocarditis cases. Compared with infective endocarditis caused by other organisms, S. epidermidis endocarditis tends to occur more frequently in male patients. Patients with S. epidermidis endocarditis exhibit fewer embolic complications and skin manifestations. The frequency of congestive heart failure is lower in this group. The relative indolent course and apparent rarity of native valve S. epidermidis endocarditis necessitate a high index of suspicion for early diagnosis. 
Preservation of skeletal muscle in tissue transfers using rat hindlimbs. Replantation of major extremities after long periods of ischemia can lead to viable replants in many cases, but functional restoration is often poor owing to fibrosis of the muscle. In this study, maximum hypothermic time in tissue transfers containing skeletal muscle using hindlimbs of Lewis rats preserved in 4 degrees C Euro-Collins solution was investigated. After preserving midthigh amputated legs in this solution for 6, 9, and 12 hours, the legs were transplanted to other inbred rats using microsurgical technique, and 1 week later, gastrocnemii were obtained to analyze ATP, ADP, and AMP using high-performance liquid chromatography. The values were compared with those for healthy legs, nonischemic operated control legs, and legs preserved in the same manner for 6, 9, and 12 hours. Histologic and serologic examinations were conducted. ATP values of the 9-hour preservation group resumed those of the nonischemic operated control group, with the values of the 12-hour preservation group remaining at 61 percent. Histologically, focal necrosis, hyaline degeneration, and regeneration processes were the most characteristic manifestations in the muscles transplanted after cold ischemia of 12 hours. It was concluded that skeletal muscle could be preserved for 9 hours in 4 degrees C Euro-Collins solution. 
Surgical evaluation of Henoch-Schonlein purpura. Experience with 110 children. Henoch-Schonlein purpura is a disorder of unknown origin that is probably related to an autoimmune phenomenon. This report concerns 110 children (mean age, 6.2 years; range, 6 months to 14 years) with Henoch-Schonlein purpura. Seventy-two (65%) had abdominal pain associated with nausea and vomiting, bloody stool, and upper gastrointestinal bleeding. Sixty patients with abdominal pain were evaluated and treated conservatively. However, 12 patients underwent laparotomy. Six underwent unnecessary appendectomy for wrongly diagnosed appendicitis. Bowel resection was performed in one patient for an obstructive ileal lesion. Six additional patients had intussusception; surgery was required in three, while barium enema reduction was successfully accomplished in three others. Massive gastric hemorrhage required ligation, vagotomy, and pyloroplasty in two instances. One child with severe scrotal pain, hemorrhage, and swelling underwent unnecessary scrotal exploration. Four additional patients with similar symptoms avoided operation after a testicular scintiscan demonstrated good blood flow. A high index of suspicion and early diagnosis of Henoch-Schonlein purpura based on clinical, roentgenographic, and laboratory findings may avoid unnecessary operations in most cases. However, life-threatening complications (hemorrhage, obstruction, and intussusception) may occur and require operative intervention. All of the patients survived. 
Effects of atrial natriuretic factor in chronic hypoxic spontaneously hypertensive rats. The present study was designed first to investigate the pulmonary hypertensive effects of chronic hypoxia in spontaneously hypertensive rats and second to compare the cardiovascular effects of atrial natriuretic factor on rats exposed to hypoxia and on control rats kept at sea level. Catheters were placed in the femoral and pulmonary arteries for measurement of mean systemic arterial pressure and mean pulmonary arterial pressure. The cardiac output was measured by thermodilution method. It was found that 4 weeks of simulated 18,000-foot hypoxia led to polycythemia, right ventricular hypertrophy, and pulmonary hypertension, which resulted from an increased pulmonary vascular resistance. However, systemic arterial pressure was not significantly different between the two groups of rats. Atrial natriuretic factor administration decreased systemic arterial pressure and pulmonary arterial pressure to a lesser extent in the hypoxic group compared with the sea level control group. It is concluded that these animals showed an impaired response to atrial natriuretic factor after long-term exposure to hypoxia. 
Disappearance of thalamic pain after parietal subcortical stroke. A hypertensive man had a long standing history of contumacious hyperpathia in the right upper extremity, resistant to medical therapy, secondary to a lacunar infarct in the left thalamus. A second cerebrovascular accident caused a small lesion in the left corona radiata, interrupting the thalamoparietal interconnections, and terminated the pain instantly. Interruption of the subcortical parietal white matter may more effectively control pain than cortical lesions. A few surgeons have successfully treated rebellious chronic pain with stereotaxic operations in the corona radiata, resulting in lesions very similar to our patient's. This overlooked and nearly forgotten technique may still have value in treating selected cases. 
Hepatitis C virus antibodies in subjects with and without liver disease in the United Kingdom. The prevalence of antibody to hepatitis C virus, evidence of previous or current infection with this agent of parenterally transmitted non-A, non-B hepatitis, was determined in 340 subjects residing in the United Kingdom. The antibody was detected in 3 per cent of unselected blood donors and in 60 per cent of patients with chronic post-transfusion non-A, non-B hepatitis. Evidence for infection was also found in 30 per cent of intravenous drug abusers, and in 75 per cent of haemophiliacs receiving commercial factor VIII concentrate. The infection is uncommon in renal units and amongst sexually promiscuous groups attending sexually-transmitted disease clinics. Although the seropositivity rate in primary biliary cirrhosis and chronic B and delta hepatitis was very low (0-2 per cent), in patients with autoimmune and alcoholic liver disease it was 14-16 per cent which, although lower than that quoted in studies from Spain and Italy, is considerably higher than would be expected by chance. The reason for the high incidence of non-A, non-B hepatitis in this latter group of patients is unclear. 
Severe hypertension with segmental renal infarction following surgical removal of a retroperitoneal malignant hemangiopericytoma: a case report. Severe hypertension developed in a fifty-five year-old woman after surgical removal of a retroperitoneal tumor, when the renal artery was injured. Renal arteriography after the surgery demonstrated a segmental infarction of the right kidney. A close relationship between activation of the renin-angiotensin system and the development of severe hypertension was observed. Satisfactory control of blood pressure concomitant with reduction of plasma renin activity was achieved by a combination of an angiotensin-converting anzyme inhibitor, beta-blocking agent, and calcium-entry blocker. The mechanism of activation of the renin-angiotensin system in renal infarction is discussed. 
Atrial natriuretic peptide in dialysis patients under various conditions of volume homeostasis. Atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) and plasma renin activity (PRA) were studied in 19 patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) under haemodialysis (HD). On the basis of clinical findings, patients were divided into three groups: group A, 6 patients, of mean age 41 +/- 15 years, without heart failure and in need of ultrafiltration (658 +/- 282 ml h-1); group B, 6 patients, of mean age 54 +/- 15 years, without heart failure under isovolaemic HD; group C, 7 patients, of mean age 60 +/- 3 years, with heart failure (NYHA III-IV) and in need of ultrafiltration (607 +/- 120 ml h-1). The highest predialysis ANP levels were found in group C (1534 +/- 471 pg ml-1) followed by group A (476 +/- 168 pg ml-1) and group B (236 +/- 138 pg ml-1) (normal range 62 +/- 27 pg ml-1). Systolic and diastolic blood pressure and heart rate did not correlate with ANP levels in either of the groups. However, iso-osmotic reduction of the body weight by ultrafiltration was correlated with decreasing ANP levels during HD (for groups A and C, r = 0.88 and 0.98, respectively). Isovolaemic HD did not alter ANP concentrations (group B). All patients received a volume bolus at the end of HD, and they responded with an instant increase in ANP concentration, which was most pronounced in patients with concomitant heart failure. PRA was not significantly correlated with ANP levels during HD. In conclusion, the results of this study indicate that there is a sensitive response of ANP levels to changes in body fluid status in ESRD. 
Effects of aspirin treatment on diabetic retinopathy. ETDRS report number 8. Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study Research Group. Aspirin treatment did not alter the course of diabetic retinopathy in patients enrolled in the Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study (ETDRS). In this randomized clinical trial supported by the National Eye Institute, 3711 patients with mild-to-severe nonproliferative or early proliferative diabetic retinopathy were assigned randomly to either aspirin (650 mg per day) or placebo. Aspirin did not prevent the development of high-risk proliferative retinopathy and did not reduce the risk of visual loss, nor did it increase the risk of vitreous hemorrhage. This was true both for eyes assigned randomly to deferral of photocoagulation and for eyes assigned randomly to early argon laser photocoagulation. The ETDRS results indicate that for patients with mild-to-severe non-proliferative or early proliferative diabetic retinopathy, it is likely that aspirin has no clinically important beneficial effects on the progression of retinopathy. The data also show that aspirin 650 mg per day had no clinically important harmful effects for diabetic patients with retinopathy. These findings suggest there are no ocular contraindications to aspirin when required for cardiovascular disease or other medical indications. 
Medical Research Council European trial of chorion villus sampling. MRC working party on the evaluation of chorion villus sampling. First-trimester chorion villus sampling has the advantage over second-trimester amniocentesis of allowing earlier prenatal diagnosis of various genetic and cytogenetic disorders in the fetus (and therefore earlier termination in affected pregnancies) but the relative safety and diagnostic accuracy remain unclear. Between 1985 and 1989, 3248 women seeking prenatal diagnosis, principally because of their age, were recruited to an international, multicentre, randomised comparison of the safety and diagnostic accuracy of the two techniques--5% of women allocated chorion villus sampling and 8% of those allocated amniocentesis were not tested, usually because of spontaneous miscarriage. 6% and 2% were retested, in most because of sampling failure. The endpoint of a liveborn infant who survived was achieved by 86% of women allocated chorion villus sampling and 91% of those allocated amniocentesis; statistical analysis, after appropriate weighting for a centre's contribution, showed that the typical difference between the groups was 4.6% (95% confidence interval 1.6-7.5%; p less than 0.01). This difference reflected more spontaneous fetal deaths before 28 weeks' gestation (2.9% [0.6-5.3%]); more terminations of pregnancy for chromosomal anomalies (1.0% [0.0-2.1%]); and more neonatal deaths (0.3% [-0.1 to 0.7%]). The difference in neonatal deaths was due to a preponderance of very immature liveborn infants in the chorion villus sampling group, and this factor also explained that group's longer mean stay in hospital. More abnormal diagnoses followed chorion villus than amniotic fluid analyses (5.6% vs 3.9%). This difference was largely due to diagnoses of trisomy 18 and of (usually mosaic) abnormalities known to be confined to the placenta. 3 terminated pregnancies were false positives, 1 tested by chorion villus sampling and 2 by amniocentesis, and 2 other mosaic cases diagnosed by chorion villus sampling may have been false positives. There was 1 false-negative result in the chorion villus sampling group. The possibility of earlier exclusion or diagnosis of some fetal disorders afforded by first-trimester chorion villus sampling must be set against its clinical risks. 
Children with chronic illness: family and parent demographic characteristics and psychosocial adjustment. This paper presents the results of an epidemiologic study that compares and contrasts psychosocial characteristics of parents and family units of children with chronic illness or physical disability (chronic health problems) with those of healthy children. Data were derived from the Ontario Child Health Study of 1869 randomly selected families, with 3294 children aged 4 to 16 years. In the absence of significant differences between parents and families of children with chronic illness alone and those with physical disability, these groups were combined for analysis, for which odds ratios (OR) or t tests were used. Significant positive findings included increased rates of parental treatment for "nerves" (mothers' OR = 2.1, fathers' OR = 1.9) and increased maternal negative affect scores (Bradburn Affect Balance Scale) (P less than .001) among parents of children with chronic health problems. Important negative findings (95% confidence interval of the OR included 1) included no increase in single-parent families (OR = 1.2), social isolation (OR = 1.0), or alcohol problems (OR = 1.2) among parents of children with chronic health problems. Categorically defined family dysfunction did not differ between the two groups (OR = 1.1). These data contrast with several clinic-based studies and suggest that, in a widely generalizable population survey, families of children with chronic health problems including physical disability do not suffer a marked excess of dysfunction, although some indicators of individual parent psychosocial problems were modestly elevated. 
In vivo molecular analysis of lymphokines involved in the murine immune response during Schistosoma mansoni infection. I. IL-4 mRNA, not IL-2 mRNA, is abundant in the granulomatous livers, mesenteric lymph nodes, and spleens of infected mice. Using Northern Blot analysis, the endogenous levels of IL-4 and IL-2 mRNA in the spleens, mesenteric lymph nodes, and granulomatous livers of male CBA/J mice in the acute phase of infection with Schistosoma mansoni have been quantified. High levels of IL-4 mRNA were detected in all three tissues from infected mice, whereas none was detected in tissues from normal, uninfected, age-matched mice. Isolation of the granulomas from the livers of infected mice and subsequent extraction of total RNA from these lesions resulted in a 70-fold enrichment of IL-4 message compared with the whole, unseparated granulomatous liver tissue. Hence, the predominant source of the IL-4 mRNA detected in livers from infected mice appears to be the schistosome egg-induced granulomas within these livers. In contrast, IL-2 mRNA was never detected in any of these tissues from either infected or normal mice. Control experiments were performed that ruled out the possibility that this inability to detect IL-2 mRNA was due to a difference in the efficacy of the IL-4 and IL-2 probes or due to a selective lability of IL-2 message. These data imply that IL-4-producing, Th2 lymphocytes are active in and possibly integral to the granulomatous, delayed-type hypersensitivity response characteristic of this infection, and directly challenges the current hypothesis that delayed-type hypersensitivity responses are exclusively mediated by Th1 lymphocytes. 
Cardiac disturbances during the administration of taxol. The clinical development of taxol, a new antimicrotubule agent with a unique mechanism of cytotoxic action, has proceeded slowly due to serious hypersensitivity reactions (HSRs) and shortages in its supply. Nevertheless, large-scale phase II trials have been initiated as taxol has recently demonstrated impressive activity in advanced and cisplatin-refractory ovarian carcinoma. Furthermore, the incidence of HSRs has been reduced substantially with premedications and modifications in the administration schedule. However, various manifestations of potential cardiotoxicity have been observed in several patients who participated in four phase I and II studies of taxol. Asymptomatic bradycardia has occurred in a high proportion of patients, including 29% of ovarian cancer patients who were treated with maximally tolerated doses of taxol in a phase II study. More profound cardiac disturbances, including a range of atrioventricular conduction blocks, left bundle branch block, ventricular tachycardia (VT), and manifestations of cardiac ischemia, have been observed in seven of 140 patients (5%) who received taxol. Descriptions of these events are presented in this report to alert investigators to the potential for these adverse effects. Although these disturbances did not result in serious sequelae in most patients, investigators should continue to maintain a high degree of caution until precise risk factors, frequency, and clinical significance of these adverse cardiac effects are determined. 
Mycotic (Aspergillus) arteritis resulting in fatal subarachnoid hemorrhage: a case report. A seventy-one year-old Japanese man suffering from carcinoma of the common bile duct died from subarachnoid hemorrhage secondary in intracranial mycotic arteritis (MA). Repeated cultures of the discharge from the draining tubes, the tip of intravenous hyperalimentation catheters, blood, sputum, and urine failed to grow any fungus. Autopsy disclosed MA due to Aspergillus at the terminal portion of the right internal carotid artery close to the posterior communicating artery. 
Evaluation of salvage surgery in heavily irradiated cancer of the buccal mucosa. This report describes the authors' experience with salvage surgery in 78 patients with carcinoma of the buccal mucosa who failed after high-dose radical radiation therapy at Regional Cancer Centre, Trivandrum, India. Forty-four patients (56%) required a hemimandibulectomy for adequate tumor clearance. Fifty-four patients (69%) required a primary reconstructive procedure for wound closure. Follow-up periods ranged from 28 months to 63 months (median follow-up, 41 months). Thirteen patients (17%) developed nonfatal postoperative complications. Thirty-one patients recurred after surgery, five of whom were again salvaged by further surgery. Overall, the recurrence rate was 36%. Most of the recurrences (26/31) were at the primary site. The overall 5-year actuarial disease-free survival after salvage surgery was 59.7%. T stage of the recurrent tumor and its skin infiltration emerged as factors which significantly influenced disease-free survival (P less than 0.05). 
Intra-arterial thrombolytic therapy in the management of acute and chronic limb ischaemia. A group of 54 patients with acute or chronic limb ischaemia were initially treated with low dose intra-arterial thrombolytic therapy using streptokinase (10,000 units h-1) or plasminogen activator (0.5 mg h-1). Complete thrombolysis was obtained in 90 per cent of patients with symptoms of less than 1 week duration, and in 50 per cent with symptoms of greater than 1 week (P less than 0.05). Successful lysis in 36 patients was followed by successful bypass surgery in seven, percutaneous angioplasty in 13, no further treatment in 13, repeat thrombolysis in two and amputation in one. Failed therapy was associated with major amputation in 40 per cent. One patient died of haemorrhage and another of stroke as a direct result of thrombolytic treatment. The most common complication was haematoma at the site of cannulation of the vessel. Intra-arterial thrombolytic therapy can be very useful for the management of acute and chronic limb ischaemia, but complications do occur and patients should be carefully selected. 
Single operator cardiopulmonary resuscitation in ambulances. Which ventilation device? Cardiopulmonary resuscitation en route to hospital is performed by a single-handed operator in many British ambulances. In this study, three emergency ventilation devices, and mouth-to-mouth breathing, were compared for effectiveness in unintubated patients. Seventeen paramedics used each method on a Laerdal manikin in a randomised order, under identical conditions. Three experienced cardiopulmonary resuscitation instructors repeated the tests in a moving ambulance. There were significant differences in minute volume (p less than 0.01) and number of effective chest compressions (p less than 0.05); mouth-to-mouth breathing produced the best overall results and the simplest device was a close second. The value of automatic ventilators for single-operator cardiopulmonary resuscitation in unintubated patients is questioned. 
HTLV-1 associated T cell lymphoma in South East Asia: case report and family study. Geographic clustering of human T cell lymphoma/leukaemia virus type 1 (HTLV-1) infection is well recognised, particularly in south western Japan, parts of West and Central Africa, the south eastern United States and the Caribbean islands. Sporadic cases have been reported in many other parts of the world. The first case of HTLV-1 associated leukaemia/lymphoma (ATLL) in South East Asia is reported. Contact tracing showed a high incidence of carriers among the relatives. 
An inherited defect of neutrophil motility and microfilamentous cytoskeleton associated with abnormalities in 47-Kd and 89-Kd proteins. A 2-month-old male Tongan infant presented with fever, severe skin and mucosal infections, hepatosplenomegaly, thrombocytopenia, and normal neutrophil counts. While polymorphonuclear neutrophil (PMN) morphology was normal, several neutrophil motile functions were found to be altered in the patient. Furthermore, two siblings had died in infancy with a similar clinical picture, raising the possibility of an inherited neutrophil defect. Random migration and chemotaxis, assessed by the under agarose method, were profoundly impaired. Actin polymerization, as measured by flow cytometry of N-(7-nitrobenz-2-oxa-1,3-diazol-4-yl)phallacidin (NBD-phallacidin)-stained PMNs, showed lower basal F-actin and a 1.75-fold increase in response to 10(-7) mol/L formyl-methionyl-leucyl-phenylalanine (FMLP) compared with a 4.51-fold increase in control. Microscopic examination of NBD-phallacidin-stained PMN spread on glass showed decreased area of spreading and F-actin-rich filamentous projections distinct from control. The early phase of FMLP-induced right angle light scattering was absent, similar to the effect caused by cytochalasin-B (CB), an inhibitor of actin polymerization. Accordingly, FMLP induced secretion of elastase without the addition of CB. Staphylococcus aureus killing was 50% of control whereas superoxide production response to FMLP and surface expression of CD11b were greater than twice normal. Partial defects in actin polymerization and scatter were seen in the parents and release of elastase, in the absence of CB, was also increased in both parents. Sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide electrophoresis of whole cell proteins from the patient showed a marked decrease in an 89-Kd protein (8% of control) and a marked increase in a 47-Kd protein (4.2-fold). Both mother and father had decreased 89-Kd (77% and 42% of control) and increased 47-Kd proteins (2- and 3.4-fold), although neither had recurrent infections or chemotactic defects. These studies describe a new inherited actin dysfunction syndrome associated with severe propensity to fungal infection and draw attention to the proteins of apparent molecular weights of 89 Kd and 47 Kd, which may be of great importance in the regulation of actin polymerization in human PMNs. 
Usefulness of early versus late programmed ventricular stimulation in acute myocardial infarction. To determine the influence of timing on the prognostic value of programmed ventricular stimulation after acute myocardial infarction (AMI), 32 patients were studied on day 19 (early study) and again on day 36 (late study) after AMI using up to 3 extrastimuli. At the early study, sustained monomorphic ventricular tachycardia (VT) was induced in 12 patients (38%), sustained polymorphic VT in 8 (25%), nonsustained monomorphic VT in 1 (3%), nonsustained polymorphic VT in 1 (3%) and no inducible arrhythmia in 10 (31%). At the late study, sustained monomorphic VT, nonsustained monomorphic VT and nonsustained polymorphic VT were induced in 8 patients (25%) each, and no inducible arrhythmia in 8 (25%). Of the 12 patients who had inducible sustained monomorphic VT at the early study, 7 had noninducibility of sustained monomorphic VT at the late study. Of the 20 patients who had noninducibility of sustained monomorphic VT at the early study, 3 had inducible sustained monomorphic VT at the late study. During the follow-up period (mean +/- standard deviation 21 +/- 8 months), there were 2 sudden cardiac deaths and 3 occurrences of sustained VT. Univariate analysis revealed both inducibilities of sustained monomorphic VT at the early study (p = 0.045) and at the late study (p less than 0.001) to be predictive of sudden cardiac death or clinical occurrence of sustained VT. However, inducibility of sustained monomorphic VT at the late study had a higher sensitivity (100%), specificity (89%), positive predictive value (63%) and negative predictive value (100%) than at the early study (80, 70, 33 and 95%, respectively). 
Allochiria vs allesthesia. Is there a misperception? Allochiria is the mislocation of sensory stimuli to the corresponding opposite half of the body or space. Obersteiner (1882) introduced the term allochiria (Greek allos = other + chiria = hand), and more than 20 authors employed it in this context over the next 25 years. Stewart (1894) described a related phenomenon in which stimuli are displaced to a different point on the same extremity. He noted that the displacements were different than allochiria and coined the term allachaesthesia (ie, allesthesia) (Greek allache = elsewhere + aisthesis = perception). Despite this historical background, Jones (1907) redefined both terms in an attempt to increase diagnostic specificity and attributed allochiria to hysteria. Jones' reinterpretation does not appear to be justified historically, etymologically, or scientifically and has resulted in contradictory definitions of allochiria and allesthesia in present-day medical dictionaries and neurologic textbooks. We advocate a return to usage consistent with the original descriptions and word derivations. 
Autologous fat injection for vocal cord medialization in the canine larynx. This study examined the use of autologous fat as an alternative to Teflon and collagen as the implantable material in vocal cord medialization. Five animals underwent left recurrent laryngeal nerve sections with subsequent fat harvest and implantation into the left true vocal cords. Three animals were killed after 48 hours and 2 after 3 weeks; their larynges were examined with light microscopy. The results of the 48-hour samples show mode-rate acute inflammation and few areas of focal necrosis. The 3-week samples show no necrotic foci, minimal foreign-body reaction, and maintenance of structure and volume of the injected fat. Autologous fat may prove to be a valuable alternative to nonautologous injectable material in vocal cord augmentation. 
Performance of age-matched controls on a battery of visuo-spatial neglect tests. Examination of 47 independent elderly subjects, matched with a population of patients with acute stroke, found that 55% made at least one omission on a battery of neglect tests. Up to 43% made omissions on any one test. Increasing age and other evidence of cognitive impairment were associated with impaired performance on the battery. Omissions were attributed to an age-related decline in visuo-spatial function. Cut-off points are provided to distinguish between such age-related impairment and visuospatial neglect. The importance of age-matched control studies in developing tests of cognitive impairment in stroke research is highlighted. 
Hepatoid adenocarcinoma of the renal pelvis producing alpha-fetoprotein of hepatic type and bile pigment. A right renal pelvic mass in a 72-year-old man was resected. The histologic appearance of the tumor was a mixture of tubular adenocarcinoma cells and hepatoid neoplastic cells, and there was a resemblance to hepatoid adenocarcinoma. The intraoperative level of serum alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) was calculated to be 2246 ng/ml, and the postoperative level ranges from 183.6 to 285.6 ng/ml. Lectin binding assays showed that the serum AFP was the hepatic carcinoma type. In a hepatoid portion, an iron-negative, brown to green pigment was positive for bile. Alpha-fetoprotein was immunohistochemically evident in the neoplastic cells. In addition to the hepatic differentiation, the tumor had differentiated into intestinal absorptive or pancreatobiliary tract cells, as deduced from the frequent presence of spicular bodies, a unique light microscopic feature equivalent to microvilli with an actin core. The hepatoid adenocarcinoma is a distinct type of AFP-producing carcinoma present in the organs with epithelium of endodermal origin. Hepatoid adenocarcinoma in the renal pelvis may arise from a metaplasia of neoplastic mesonephric cells into endodermal cells. 
Oral magnesium successfully relieves premenstrual mood changes. Reduced magnesium (Mg) levels have been reported in women affected by premenstrual syndrome (PMS). To evaluate the effects of an oral Mg preparation on premenstrual symptoms, we studied, by a double-blind, randomized design, 32 women (24-39 years old) with PMS confirmed by the Moos Menstrual Distress Questionnaire. After 2 months of baseline recording, the subjects were randomly assigned to placebo or Mg for two cycles. In the next two cycles, both groups received Mg. Magnesium pyrrolidone carboxylic acid (360 mg Mg) or placebo was administered three times a day, from the 15th day of the menstrual cycle to the onset of menstrual flow. Blood samples for Mg measurement were drawn premenstrually, during the baseline period, and in the second and fourth months of treatment. The Menstrual Distress Questionnaire score of the cluster "pain" was significantly reduced during the second month in both groups, whereas Mg treatment significantly affected both the total Menstrual Distress Questionnaire score and the cluster "negative affect." In the second month, the women assigned to treatment showed a significant increase in Mg in lymphocytes and polymorphonuclear cells, whereas no changes were observed in plasma and erythrocytes. These data indicate that Mg supplementation could represent an effective treatment of premenstrual symptoms related to mood changes. 
Quality of life in long-term survivors of CNS tumors of childhood and adolescence. Clinical reports of small numbers of pediatric brain tumor patients observed for brief periods suggest that long-term survivors continue to have major handicaps into adulthood. To quantify these late effects we interviewed 342 adults (or their proxies) who had CNS tumors diagnosed before the age of 20 between 1945 and 1974, survived at least 5 years, and reached 21 years of age. Survivors were 32 years old on average at follow-up. When compared with 479 matched siblings as controls. CNS tumor survivors were more likely to have died or to have become mentally incompetent sometime during the follow-up period. They were more likely to be at risk for such adverse outcomes as unemployment (odds ratio [OR], 10.8; 95% confidence interval [CI], 4.6 to 25.7], to have a health condition that affected their ability to work (OR, 5.9; CI, 3.7 to 9.4), to be unable to drive (OR, 28.8; CI, 6.9 to 119.9), or to describe their current health as poor (OR, 7.8; CI, 1.7 to 35.7). Unfavorable outcomes were more frequent in male survivors than in females, in those with supratentorial tumors compared with infratentorial ones, and in those who received radiation therapy. As clinicians consider improving therapies, they should anticipate late effects, such as those we observed, and attempt to target subgroups for interventions that may improve subsequent quality of life. 
Dog bites in urban children. As a result of a perceived increase in pit bull injuries, all children who presented to The Children's Hospital of Philadelphia during 1989 for evaluation of dog bite injuries were prospectively studied. Epidemiologic information was collected from parents, either at the time of visit or by phone on the following day. A total of 168 children were enrolled; the mean age was 8 years. Males outnumbered females 1.5:1. Most (61%) injuries occurred in or around the home and involved dogs known to the patient (77%). Types of injuries included abrasions (33%), punctures (29%), and lacerations (38%). Thirteen bites had associated complications; nine developed infection. Twelve (7%) children required admission to the hospital. More than 12 different purebreeds or cross-breeds were identified as perpetrators, including German shepherds (n = 35), pit bulls (n = 33), rottweilers (n = 9), and Dobermans (n = 7). Most (54%) animals were contained (ie, leashed, fenced, in-house) at the time of injury. Fewer (46%) were provoked prior to biting. Significantly more pit bull injuries (94% vs 43%, P less than .001) were the consequence of unprovoked attacks and involved freely roaming animals (67% vs 41%, P less than .01). Children aged 5 or younger were more likely to provoke animals prior to injury than were older children (69% vs 36%, P less than .001). It is recommended that families with young children be the target of pet safety education and that measures be sought that would lead to early identification of a potentially dangerous dog and restrict ownership. 
Megaduodenum due to hollow visceral myopathy successfully managed by duodenoplasty and feeding jejunostomy. A 29 year old man with a history of childhood polymyositis developed insulin dependent diabetes and was found coincidentally to have chronic intestinal pseudo-obstruction due to visceral myopathy. Multiple full thickness biopsy specimens showed severe disease in the duodenum and the proximal jejunum only, with less involvement distally. Total parenteral nutrition has been avoided for more than a year by enteral feeding through a fine bore jejunostomy catheter positioned with its tip in the distal jejunum. 
Patient-controlled on-demand epidural fentanyl. A comparison of patient-controlled on-demand fentanyl delivered epidurally or intravenously. A prospective, open, clinical trial is described in which 20 patients having upper abdominal surgery were randomly allocated to receive fentanyl for postoperative analgesia by patient-controlled demand analgesic computer by either the epidural or intravenous route. Hourly pain, sedation and nausea scores were very similar in the two groups during the first 24 hours after surgery. What few differences there were favoured the epidural group. There was a highly significant difference in fentanyl consumption between the two groups, with the intravenous group demanding consistently more than twice as much as the epidural group. 
Etiology of acute respiratory infections in children in tropical southern India. Nasopharyngeal secretions and throat-swab specimens from 809 children less than 6 years old with acute respiratory infection were examined by culture and indirect immunofluorescence for the presence of virus or viral antigen. Blood was cultured for the presence of bacteria in selected cases of lower respiratory infection (LRI); pleural fluid also was cultured in cases of empyema. Viruses were detected in 163 (49%) of 331 children with LRI. Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) was the commonest agent isolated (106 children). Other viruses isolated included parainfluenza viruses (36 children), adenoviruses (12), and influenza viruses (five). Outbreaks of infection due to RSV occurred during August through October. Pneumonia was the commonest LRI encountered (178 children). Among children with pneumonia, viruses were detected in 65 (37%) of 178 children, and bacteria were isolated from 27 (18%) of the 147 children for whom blood cultures were done. Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, and Staphylococcus aureus were the common bacterial pathogens isolated. In cases of empyema and pyopneumothorax, S. aureus was the commonest organism isolated. There were 116 children with bronchiolitis, 83 (72%) of whom had viral infections; the majority of these children (81%) had RSV infection. Croup was uncommon (eight cases) and was caused mainly by parainfluenza viruses. 
Paracentesis with intravenous infusion of albumin as compared with peritoneovenous shunting in cirrhosis with refractory ascites. BACKGROUND. There is no satisfactory treatment for refractory ascites in patients with cirrhosis. Both peritoneovenous shunts and paracentesis have been used, but there is uncertainty about their relative merits. METHODS. We studied 89 patients with cirrhosis and refractory ascites who were randomly assigned to receive either repeated large-volume paracentesis plus intravenous albumin or a LeVeen peritoneovenous shunt. Patients in the paracentesis group in whom recurrent tense ascites developed during follow-up were treated with paracentesis, and those in the peritoneovenous-shunt group with diuretic agents or by the insertion of a new shunt if there was shunt obstruction. RESULTS. During the first hospitalization, ascites was removed in all 41 patients in the paracentesis group and in 44 of the 48 patients in the peritoneovenous-shunt group. The mean (+/- SD) duration of hospitalization in the two groups was 11 +/- 5 and 19 +/- 9 days, respectively (P less than 0.01). There were no significant differences in the number of patients who had complications or died. During follow-up, 37 patients in each group were hospitalized again. In the paracentesis group, the number of rehospitalizations for any reason (174 vs. 97 in the peritoneovenous-shunt group) or for ascites (125 vs. 38) was significantly higher, and the median time to a first readmission for any reason (1 +/- 1 vs. 2 +/- 2 months) or for ascites (2 +/- 2 vs. 8 +/- 17 months) was significantly shorter than in the peritoneovenous-shunt group. The total times in the hospital during follow-up, however, were similar in the two groups (48 +/- 49 and 44 +/- 39 days, respectively). Three patients had obstructions of their peritoneovenous shunts during their first hospitalizations, and 15 patients had a total of 20 obstructions during follow-up. Survival was similar in both groups. CONCLUSIONS. The LeVeen shunt and paracentesis are equally effective in relieving refractory ascites. The former may provide better long-term control of ascites, but shunt occlusion is common and survival is not improved. 
Dietary fish oil blocks the microcirculatory manifestations of ischemia-reperfusion injury in striated muscle in hamsters. Epidemiologic observations and experimental studies have demonstrated a protective effect of dietary fish oil on the clinical manifestations of ischemia-reperfusion injury. To investigate the underlying mechanisms, we used the dorsal skinfold chamber model for intravital fluorescence microscopy of the microcirculation in striated muscle of awake hamsters. In control hamsters (n = 7), reperfusion after a 4-hr pressure-induced ischemia to the muscle tissue elicited the adhesion of fluorescently stained leukocytes to the endothelium of postcapillary venules, capillary obstruction, and the break-down of endothelial integrity. These microvascular manifestations of ischemia-reperfusion injury were significantly attenuated in animals (n = 7) when fed with a fish oil-enriched diet for 4 weeks prior to the experiments. In leukocyte total lipids, the fish oil diet resulted in a substantial displacement of arachidonic acid, the precursor of the potent adhesion-promoting leukotriene (LT) B4, by fish oil-derived eicosapentaenoic acid, the precursor of biologically less potent LTB5, emphasizing the mediator role of LTB4 in ischemia-reperfusion injury. These results suggest that the preservation of microvascular perfusion by dietary fish oil contributes to its protective effects on the clinical manifestations of ischemia-reperfusion injury. 
External anal sphincter function in spinal patients. Electromyographic and manometric study. Six patients with complete transection of the spinal cord and six healthy volunteers were examined by using anorectal manometry together with electromyographic (EMG) recording of the external anal sphincter composed of striated muscle. Anal pressure and EMG activity of the external anal sphincter were continuously recorded at rest and during gradual rectal distention (10, 20, 30, 40, and 50 ml) by means of an air-filled balloon eliciting a rectoanal inhibitory reflex (RAIR) at the upper part, and an inflation reflex (IR) at the lower part of the anal canal. All patients and controls had a RAIR for each rectal distention volume. A relationship between the duration of the RAIR and the rectal distention volume was present in controls only. In controls the IR was present for each rectal distention volume, whereas it was present in only one patient for a 40-ml volume. During the resting period, all controls showed continuous tonic EMG activity of the external anal sphincter, but after 30 minutes all the patients showed a decrease and ultimately in five cases a disappearance of the tonic EMG activity of the external anal sphincter. In spinal patients, the presence or absence of EMG activity of the external anal sphincter did not modify the anal canal pressure. These results indicate that: 1) the tonic EMG activity of the external anal sphincter seems to be under the control of supraspinal structures, because in spinal patients it disappears in the absence of sensitive inputs toward the spinal cord; 2) the absence of EMG activity at rest indicates that the external anal sphincter is not implicated in the RAIR disturbances observed in spinal patients; 3) the IR is not a spinal reflex but is under voluntary control, because it is not present in spinal humans; 4) in spinal humans the tonic EMG activity of the external anal sphincter does not play a role in the maintenance of the anal pressure at rest. 
ABO(H) antigens and beta-2 microglobulin in transitional cell carcinoma. Predictors of response to intravesical bacillus Calmette-Guerin. The response of patients with superficial transitional cell carcinoma of the bladder (STCB) to intravesical chemotherapy is variable; some patients enjoy a long period without recurrence, whereas others have recurrence of tumor within 2 years of removal of the primary lesion. Previously, others have demonstrated that the loss of normal cell surface antigens, such as ABO(H) blood group antigens or beta-2 microglobulin (B2M) has been correlated with more aggressive behavior by tumor. In this study, using immunohistochemical techniques, the authors evaluated the initial pretreatment biopsy specimen of bladder tumors for the presence of ABO(H) antigens and B2M. Data from this sample patient population, all with biopsy-proven STCB, indicate that expression of these two markers is predictive of a therapeutic response to prophylactic intravesical bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG) (Tice strain) after resection, and that expression of the two markers is of greater predictive value than expression of either antigen alone. 
Modulation of catecholamine cardiomyopathy by allopurinol. It has been suggested that cardiac injury by catecholamines may be the result of coronary constriction leading to ischemic damage. Allopurinol (ALLO) has been shown to reduce the extent of myocardial necrosis in various systems. Hence the possibility that ALLO might limit norepinephrine (NE) injury was tested. Rabbit hearts were infused with NE (3 micrograms/min/kg) for 90 minutes, with or without ALLO (50 micrograms/min/kg). Control specimens infused with saline solution plus ALLO were also prepared. Hearts were excised 48 hours later and studied as isovolumic isolated heart preparations. Peak systolic pressure, coronary flow, and myocardial oxygen consumption were significantly reduced in the hearts infused with NE but not in the NE + ALLO hearts. Myocardial adenosine triphosphate and glycogen concentrations were 29% and 26% lower in the NE hearts compared with control hearts. These reductions were absent in the NE + ALLO group. Moreover, rates of creatine phosphokinase and lactic dehydrogenase release were sharply elevated in the NE hearts but not in those also given ALLO. These findings are consistent with the changes observed histologically. The amount of myocardial damage was less in the ALLO + NE group compared with the NE group (p less than 0.02). This appears to be the first report to demonstrate that ALLO reduces myocyte damage by NE. Possible mechanisms include decreased free radical production, scavenging of free radicals, and preservation of the adenine nucleotide pool. Because xanthine oxidase activity is absent in the rabbit, the latter two mechanisms are more likely explanations for the findings. 
A case of autoerotic asphyxia associated with multiplex paraphilia. During the past 20 years, the sensational aspects of autoerotic fatalities have captured the attention of medical examiners, psychiatrists, law enforcement agents, and the public, as well as the individuals themselves who engage in these dangerous practices. Reports of deaths related to sexual asphyxia have been presented numerous times at national and international meetings and have been the topic of discussion on television talk shows and in the press. Autoerotic fatalities and all the sexual curiosities related to these activities have prompted death scene investigators to publish case reports, and even textbooks, on the subject. The case presented herein is one of a multicomponent paraphilia in which self-asphyxiation (autoasphyxiophilia) led to a fatal autoerotic event. 
Paroxysmal tremor and orofacial dyskinesia secondary to a biopterin synthesis defect. We report a child with a systemic biopterin synthesis defect due to an absence of 6-pyruvoyl-tetrahydropterin synthase who had an unusual presentation, with three episodes of coarse "rubral-like" tremor in arms and legs orofacial dyskinesia between the ages of 3 and 6 months. Response to levodopa therapy and CSF neurotransmitter metabolite concentrations before and after therapy suggests that his clinical syndrome resulted from a secondary dopamine deficiency. 
Metabolic and work efficiencies during exercise in Andean natives. Maximum O2 and CO2 fluxes during exercise were less perturbed by hypoxia in Quechua natives from the Andes than in lowlanders. In exploring how this was achieved, we found that, for a given work rate, Quechua highlanders at 4,200 m accumulated substantially less lactate than lowlanders at sea level normoxia (approximately 5-7 vs. 10-14 mM) despite hypobaric hypoxia. This phenomenon, known as the lactate paradox, was entirely refractory to normoxia-hypoxia transitions. In lowlanders, the lactate paradox is an acclimation; however, in Quechuas, the lactate paradox is an expression of metabolic organization that did not deacclimate, at least over the 6-wk period of our study. Thus it was concluded that this metabolic organization is a developmentally or genetically fixed characteristic selected because of the efficiency advantage of aerobic metabolism (high ATP yield per mol of substrate metabolized) compared with anaerobic glycolysis. Measurements of respiratory quotient indicated preferential use of carbohydrate as fuel for muscle work, which is also advantageous in hypoxia because it maximizes the yield of ATP per mol of O2 consumed. Finally, minimizing the cost of muscle work was also reflected in energetic efficiency as classically defined (power output per metabolic power input); this was evident at all work rates but was most pronounced at submaximal work rates (efficiency approximately 1.5 times higher than in lowlander athletes). Because plots of power output vs. metabolic power input did not extrapolate to the origin, it was concluded 1) that exercise in both groups sustained a significant ATP expenditure not convertible to mechanical work but 2) that this expenditure was downregulated in Andean natives by thus far unexplained mechanisms. 
Abnormal vasomotor changes early after coronary angioplasty. A quantitative arteriographic study of their time course. BACKGROUND. To study the impact of percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA) on coronary vasomotion, we prospectively analyzed spontaneous changes in coronary diameter and the response to the cold pressor test and intracoronary nitroglycerin in 11 patients subjected to successful single-vessel PTCA. METHODS AND RESULTS. All antianginal medications were stopped 48 hours before each study. The minimum diameter of the PTCA segment and the diameter of a distal segment in the angioplastied vessel and of a segment in a control vessel not manipulated by the balloon catheter or guide wire were measured by computerized edge detection immediately before PTCA and 5 minutes after, 4 hours after, and 8 days after PTCA. At 4 hours, PTCA and distal segments were constricted by 38 +/- 9% and 16 +/- 5%, respectively, compared with the values at 5 minutes (p less than 0.01). Before angioplasty, the cold pressor test caused vasoconstriction of PTCA and distal segments by 23 +/- 6% (p less than 0.0001) and 15 +/- 4% (p less than 0.008), respectively, but no constrictor response was elicited at 5 minutes or 4 hours after angioplasty. Eight days after PTCA, the basal coronary diameters were similar to those observed 5 minutes after PTCA and the response to the cold pressor test was similar to that observed before PTCA. All segments dilated significantly with nitroglycerin at all times, and no vasoconstriction changes were found in the control segments. CONCLUSIONS. Four hours after PTCA, transient spontaneous vasoconstriction of the PTCA and distal segments occurs, which is so intense that the cold pressor test does not cause any further constriction. These abnormalities resolve within 8 days of PTCA. 
The histologic reliability of laser cone biopsy of the cervix. Laser conization of the cervix has been advocated as the technique of choice for the treatment of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) in preference to ablative techniques, because it provides a specimen for histologic diagnosis while retaining the advantages of an outpatient procedure with minimal short- and long-term morbidity. To determine whether specimens so obtained are adequate for reliable histologic diagnosis, we reviewed 77 laser conizations performed for lesions confirmed to contain CIN in a colposcopically directed biopsy and satisfying the criteria for local ablation and scored the cones for the presence of epithelial denudation and laser coagulation artifact that interfered with the diagnosis of CIN or the assessment of the margins of excision. Thirty specimens (39%) were negative for CIN. Twenty-eight (36%) showed extensive epithelial denudation, ten (13%) contained coagulation artifact that made recognition of CIN extremely difficult or impossible, and in 11 (14%), assessment of margins was extremely difficult or impossible because of laser coagulation artifact. We conclude that these difficulties with the histologic interpretation of laser cone specimens make it an unsuitable excisional technique when reliable histologic diagnosis of cervical lesions is required. 
Alpha 1 antitrypsin phenotypes and alcoholic pancreatitis. Altered frequencies of alpha 1 antitrypsin phenotypes have been reported in patients with chronic pancreatitis, suggesting a possible genetic basis for individual susceptibility to this disease. Alpha 1 antitrypsin phenotypes, with particular regard to alcoholic pancreatitis, were studied. Patients with alcoholic pancreatitis were compared with alcoholic control subjects with no history of pancreatic disease. Serum alpha 1 antitrypsin concentrations were raised in pancreatitis patients sampled within one month of an acute attack of pancreatitis, but otherwise values were similar to those of control subjects. There were no significant differences in alpha 1 antitrypsin phenotypes between alcoholics with pancreatitis and alcoholic control subjects. This study of alpha 1 antitrypsin phenotypes provides no evidence of an inherited susceptibility to alcoholic pancreatitis. 
Avoidance of cancellation of potential hyperstimulation cycles by conversion to in vitro fertilization-embryo transfer. OBJECTIVE: The study was undertaken to minimize the rate of ovarian hyperstimulation and to avoid cancellation of human treatment cycles in women treated with human menopausal gonadotropin (hMG) for induction of ovulation. SETTING: Patients were treated in the fertility clinic and in vitro fertilization unit of our institution, which is a government, university-affiliated hospital. PATIENTS: Ninety anovulatory patients were treated with hMG. Of these, 12 were at high risk for ovarian hyperstimulation. The criteria for potential ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome were rising excessive 17 beta-estradiol levels of greater than 1,500 pg/mL in the presence of multiple follicles with a mean diameter greater than 15 mm. These patients were transferred for continuation of treatment to our in vitro fertilization-embryo transfer (IVF-ET) unit. INTERVENTIONS: The patients underwent ova retrieval by the ultrasonically guided transvaginal approach. RESULTS: Of the 12 patients, 5 conceived (41.6%). Two patients had a mild ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome, and 1 had a moderate syndrome and was hospitalized for observation for 48 hours. CONCLUSION: In view of the results, we suggest that IVF-ET should be considered in cases in which ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome is imminent, rather than withhold human chorionic gonadotropin and cancelling the treatment cycle. 
Plasma and saliva levels of PGI2 and TXA2 in the headache-free period of classical migraine patients. The effects of nicardipine. The levels of Prostacyclin (PGI2) and Thromboxane A2 (TXA2) were assayed simultaneously (RIA) in the plasma and saliva of 9 patients suffering from classical migraine attacks. The assays were done during an attack-free period. In relation to the control group we observed a significant decrease in the plasma levels of PGI2 together with a sharp increase in TXA2 in saliva. When the patients were treated with nicardipine, a calcium antagonist, the TXA2 increase in saliva did not occur. These results suggest both a systemic and local effect in the classical migraine attacks. We explain and discuss our results by referring to the PGI2: TXA2 equilibrium system. Nicardipine action might be related to its ability to reduce the calcium entry into the cell induced by thromboxane. 
Unusual intramandibular neural tumor. Neural tumors within the jaw bones are exceptional. We present the histologic observation of a central mandibular tumor of neural origin. Immunohistochemistry confirmed the neural nature of the tumor, which had features of a schwannoma (neurilemmoma) together with ganglion cells as seen in ganglioneuroma. Moreover, the association with an intracranial tumor, possibly a meningioma, is emphasized. 
Simultaneous esophageal pH monitoring and scintigraphy during the postprandial period in patients with severe reflux esophagitis. To compare reflux events detected by intraesophageal pH monitoring with that of scintigraphy, we simultaneously performed both techniques along with esophageal manometry in nine patients with severe reflux esophagitis. Two hundred eighteen reflux events were detected in the recumbent posture after a meal during a 40-min interval. Both techniques simultaneously detected only 23% of all reflux events. Scintigraphy alone detected 61% of all reflux events as opposed to 16% for pH monitoring. Of those reflux events diagnosed only by scintigraphy, more occurred while the intraesophageal pH was less than 4 (ie, during an acid-clearing interval) than while the intraesophageal pH was greater than 4 (ie, when intragastric contents were neutralized by the meal). Most reflux events occurred during periods of stable, but low LES pressure. While reflux events diagnosed by scintigraphy significantly decreased during the second of two 20-min postprandial intervals, those by pH monitoring tended to increase. That simultaneous scintigraphy and pH monitoring agreed on less than 1/3 of all reflux events not only underscores the fact that both techniques measured different physical components of the esophageal refluxate (ie, volume vs acid concentration, respectively), but also were influenced by different physiologic events such as the ingestion of a meal, gastric emptying, and esophageal acid clearance. 
Pain centers--organization and outcome. Pain treatment centers have evolved at a rapid rate, but they differ in their complexity and services provided. Patients, as well as primary care physicians, have difficulty in identifying the appropriate center for a specific problem. Guidelines for pain centers have recently been proposed by the International Association for the Study of Pain, along with an attempt at their accreditation. Outcome studies from pain centers have proliferated, with a wide range of treatment programs being reported. Comprehensive multidisciplinary pain centers using the rehabilitation medicine approach are effective in decreasing disability and increasing the productivity of patients with chronic, disabling pain. 
Quantitation of axon loss and conduction block in peroneal nerve palsies. We compared conduction in motor fibers supplying the extensor digitorum brevis (EDB) and anterior lateral compartment (AL) muscles. The object was to determine whether there were any differences in the relative proportions of degenerated and blocked nerve fibers between the longer EDB and shorter AL fibers. In almost every case the percentage of motor fibers undergoing axonal degeneration was greatest in EDB fibers. Conversely, the percentage of conduction block was greatest in the AL motor fibers. As clinical recovery is dependent on AL muscles rather than EDB, electrophysiological study of the relative proportions of degenerated and blocked fibers in the former should provide a more reliable measure of outcome than similar studies of EDB. Conduction velocity distal to the fibular head was not slowed despite the large loss of EDB motor fibers. Evidence for selective involvement of the larger myelinated fibers is, therefore, lacking. The location of the major conduction abnormalities was in almost every case between the mid-fibular head and popliteal fossa. 
Depression and chronic fatigue in the patient with chronic pain. Chronic benign pain is commonly associated with chronic fatigue and depression. Depression and chronic fatigue syndrome are also associated with each other and often include pain. Psychologic factors are prominent in these conditions, and they may share neurobiologic factors as well. Management requires separately addressing each component of patients' distress and usually includes physical rehabilitation, education, administration of nonhabituating medications and often counseling. Depression may be a favorable prognostic sign, as it suggests a treatable condition and provides incentive for recovery. 
Demethylation of CpG islands in embryonic cells. DNA in differentiated somatic cells has a fixed pattern of methylation, which is faithfully copied after replication. By contrast, the methylation patterns of many tissue-specific and some housekeeping genes are altered during normal development. This modification of DNA methylation in the embryo has also been observed in transgenic mice and in transfection experiments. Here we report the fate in mice of an in vitro-methylated adenine phosphoribosyltransferase transgene. The entire 5' CpG island region became demethylated, whereas the 3' end of the gene remained modified and was even methylated de novo at additional sites. Transfection experiments in vitro show that the demethylation is rapid, is specific for embryonic cell-types and affects a variety of different CpG island sequences. This suggests that gene sequences can be recognized in the early embryo and imprinted with the correct methylation pattern through a combination of demethylation and de novo methylation. 
Neisseria lactamica meningitis following skull trauma. A woman developed meningitis due to Neisseria lactamica in association with a cribriform plate fracture. Cerebrospinal fluid antigen tests for Neisseria meningitidis were negative. The patient recovered with intravenous penicillin therapy. N. lactamica can be rapidly distinguished from N. meningitidis by the hydrolysis of ONPG (o-nitrophenyl-beta-D-galactopyranoside). In contrast to N. meningitidis and Neisseria gonorrhoeae, N. lactamica lacks virulence properties. As 100% of N. lactamica strains are susceptible to penicillin and all three previously described patients with N. lactamica meningitis have recovered with penicillin treatment, the reason for distinguishing the organisms in this context is primarily to prevent unnecessary anxiety and prophylaxis among contacts. 
Potential impact of exclusion criteria on results of hypertension trials. Recent trials of antihypertensive therapy, including the Veterans Administration trials, the Hypertension Detection and Follow-up Program, the Multiple Risk Factor Intervention Trial, the Australian Mild Hypertension Trial, and the British Medical Research Council Trial, are reviewed with a particular emphasis on the criteria leading to the exclusion of potentially eligible participants. The observation of all-cause and cause-specific mortality rates in the group ultimately selected to participate in the trial is suggested as an index to the general applicability of trial results. Because end-point rates are fundamental for determining sample size, substantial reduction in these end-point rates by patient exclusion should be taken into account by the trial design. Some recent trials may have generated end-point-event rates so low that the power of the trial to detect reasonable treatment effects was substantially reduced. Future trials should attempt to take this important factor into account at the design stage. 
Seminal vesicle cysts: association with adult polycystic kidney disease. Adult polycystic kidney disease (APKD) is associated with cyst formation in the kidney, liver, pancreas, esophagus, ovary, uterus, and brain. Four patients with APKD (aged 45-65 years) with computed tomographic evidence of seminal vesicle cysts are described. All seminal vesicles contained cystic masses with attenuation values of 0-30 HU. Seminal vesicle thickness was 3-4 cm (normal, 1.5 cm). High-attenuation walls separated the cysts, which were 3-35 mm in diameter. All patients had typical renal stigmata of APKD. None had cysts elsewhere, except one patient with hepatic cysts. Postmortem examination in one patient confirmed the seminal vesicle cysts as well as APKD. It is likely that a basement membrane defect allows cyst formation in multiple organs, presumably including the seminal vesicles. Because of the association of seminal vesicle cysts with ipsilateral urogenital anomalies, and because only 60% of patients with APKD have a relevant familial history, the kidneys of patients with cross-sectional imaging evidence of seminal vesicle cysts should also be studied. 
Penetrating atherosclerotic aortic ulcer with dissecting hematoma: control of bleeding with percutaneous embolization. A case is presented in which left subpleural hematoma and hemothorax resulted from a penetrating atherosclerotic aortic ulcer with an aortic pseudoaneurysm and intramedial hematoma. Percutaneous transfemoral embolization of the ulcer with use of coils and thrombin resulted in stabilization of the patient's hemodynamic status. The patient died 6 days later of pneumonia. In certain clinical situations, treatment of bleeding from penetrating aortic ulcers with percutaneous embolization may stabilize the patient's condition, allowing elective surgical intervention. 
Effect of hypoxic exercise on atrial natriuretic factor and aldosterone regulation. To evaluate the possible physiologic role of atrial natriuretic factor (ANF) in the observed dissociation of aldosterone secretion from the renin-angiotensin system during hypoxic exercise, 12 untrained men, ages 18 to 24, were studied on two separate days for 30 min during hypoxic (16% O2) and normoxic (room air) exercise on a bicycle ergometer. Workloads were adjusted to produce individual heart rates that remained within 70 to 75% of their previously measured maximum. Hemoglobin saturation decreased during hypoxia from 98 +/- 0.1% to 90 +/- 0.4% (P less than .01). Plasma aldosterone levels increased significantly (P less than .01) under both breathing conditions, yet were on average 36% lower during hypoxia than during normoxia (P less than .001). Plasma ANF levels increased during exercise under both conditions (P less than .01), yet levels were 45% greater during hypoxia than during normoxia (P less than .001). Plasma renin activity, adrenocorticotropic hormone, cortisol, potassium, and systolic blood pressure increased during exercise on both study days (P less than .01, compared to basal level), and showed no difference between normoxic and hypoxic conditions. Plasma pH was slightly higher during hypoxic exercise (P less than .05, compared to normoxia). We conclude that acute hypoxemia is a potent enhancing stimulus for ANF release during dynamic exercise and that ANF is probably a contributing factor in the dissociation of aldosterone secretion from the renin-angiotensin system under these conditions. 
Use of technetium-HMPAO to demonstrate changes in cerebral blood flow reserve following carotid endarterectomy. Cerebral perfusion through stenosed internal carotid arteries is usually maintained by autoregulation. However, flow reserve may be reduced, suggesting hemodynamically significant stenosis, and such reduction should be improved by carotid endarterectomy. This concept was studied in 20 subjects with unilateral internal carotid artery stenosis (major stenosis greater than or equal to 70%, minor stenosis less than or equal to 50%). Thirteen had experienced recent transient ischemic attacks and seven had no definite focal symptoms. Subjects underwent Tc-HMPAO cerebral SPECT during acetazolamide dysautoregulation before and after internal carotid endarterectomy. Nine (45%) had perfusion defects that improved after surgery, suggesting surgery had improved cerebral flow reserve. Seven had defects that did not improve after surgery. Four had worsened or new defects after surgery, suggesting perioperative infarcts. The relatively large proportion of patients with improved cerebral blood flow reserve after surgery suggests that this technique may have a significant role to play in assessing which patients might benefit from carotid endarterectomy. 
A comparison of treatment outcomes for black patients and white patients with metastatic breast cancer. The Piedmont Oncology Association experience. Prior studies have shown that black patients with breast cancer have poorer survival times compared with white patients even when adjusted for stage. Seventy-four black patients treated on six Piedmont Oncology Association (POA) protocols were compared with 74 randomly selected white patients treated with the same protocols to determine if race had any independent effect on response, time to progression, or survival time. Patients were evenly matched for pretreatment characteristics with the exception that white patients had a significantly higher percentage of bone metastases and significantly less skin involvement. Response rates and median time to progression were similar for black patients and white patients at 31% and 25%, and 9.3 and 9.1 months, respectively. Black patients had poorer survival times even when adjusting for covariables; median survival time was 14.3 months for black patients and 20.3 months for white patients (P less than 0.05). The reason for this survival difference in Stage IV patients is unclear, but is unlikely to be related to treatment. Additional research in this area will be necessary to resolve this issue. 
Exercise-induced muscle soreness after concentric and eccentric isokinetic contractions. The purpose of this two-part study was to determine whether the amount of exercise-induced muscle soreness differs between subjects who perform concentric and eccentric isokinetic contractions of their quadriceps femoris muscles. In experiment 1, subjects were randomly assigned to either an eccentric or a concentric exercise group and both groups exercised at the same power level. In experiment 2, subjects were randomly assigned to either an eccentric or a concentric exercise group and both groups exercised with maximal effort. Muscle soreness ratings, obtained by using a visual analogue scale, were taken immediately before exercise and at 24 and 48 hours postexercise. Changes in muscle soreness ratings between exercise groups from preexercise to postexercise periods were compared in both experiments, using a one-way between-subjects analysis of variance. There was no difference in the change in muscle soreness from preexercise to post-exercise periods between groups exercising at equal power levels. Subjects who exercised using eccentric contractions with maximal effort demonstrated greater increases in muscle soreness than those who performed concentric contractions. The results suggest that exercise intensity, rather than contraction type, may be the dependent factor in producing exercise-induced muscle soreness. 
Differentiation between hemangiomas and metastases of the liver with ultrafast MR imaging: preliminary results with T2 calculations. We studied the efficacy of T2 measurements at high field strength in distinguishing between liver hemangiomas and hepatic metastases when an ultrafast (single-excitation) MR imaging technique is used. Fourteen patients with known liver tumors were imaged in a 2.0-T prototype ultrafast MR scanner with a spin-echo (infinite TR and TE of 30-340 msec) pulse sequence. Each image was obtained with a total data acquisition time of 20 msec. T2 calculations for hepatic metastases (n = 6) showed a mean of 79.3 +/- 13.5 msec, whereas hemangiomas (n = 8) showed a T2 of 139.8 +/- 18.8 msec (p less than .0001). T2 values of lesions had a smaller relative standard deviation than previously reported, and the range of T2 values of hemangiomas (119-181 msec) and metastases (68-103 msec) did not overlap. Our preliminary results suggest that T2 calculations with ultrafast MR imaging may be useful for differentiating hemangiomas from metastases. We hypothesize that T2 values obtained from ultrafast MR images are more reliable than those obtained from conventional MR images, primarily because of the elimination of T1 information and effects of motion on image signal intensity. 
Thrombolysis in unstable angina: results of clinical studies. Ample evidence exists to support the major role of intracoronary thrombosis superimposed on a disrupted plaque in unstable angina. Consequently, thrombolytic treatment, already established to be highly beneficial in patients with acute myocardial infarction, might also be indicated in patients with unstable angina. The clinical response to thrombolytic treatment has been evaluated in several small-sized studies with inconsistent and somewhat deceiving results. Thus, the role of thrombolysis in the treatment of unstable angina is still controversial. Two ongoing large-scale, randomized, controlled trials, the Third Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction (TIMI III) in the United States testing recombinant tissue-type plasminogen activator and UNASEM in Europe testing anisoylated plasminogen-streptokinase activator complex will, it is hoped, solve the debate. At present, early thrombolysis might be considered for the treatment of the subset of patients with severe rest angina associated with transient ST-T ischemic changes. 
Does oximetry contribute to the detection of apneic events? Mathematical processing of the SaO2 signal. The purpose of this study was to assess the ability of continuous nocturnal oximetry to detect sleep apnea syndrome (SAS) and to recognize nonapneic oxyhemoglobin desaturations. Oxygen saturation oscillations, related to successive apneas in SAS or to apneic episodes in COPD or restrictive patients, were quantified using a new index: delta = 1/n sigma 1 n magnitude of delta(SaO2)/delta(t)(12-s intervals) Twenty-six patients (15 SAS, 8 COPD, and 3 restrictive patients) were included in a prospective study comparing nocturnal oximetry and polysomnography over 34 nights. In apneic patients, we found a strong correlation (r2 = 0.73, p less than 0.01) between time spent in apnea and the delta index. In COPD, the number of apneas was also correlated to the delta index (r2 = 0.92, p less than 0.01). A lower threshold for delta of 1.5 is accurate enough to detect apneas if initial SaO2 is greater than 93 percent. If initial SaO2 is greater than 93 percent, the delta threshold should be 0.8 (sensitivity 95 percent). Such a method could contribute to the accurate selection of patients for polysomnography. 
Effect of antibiotics on food intake and absorption of nutrients for children with diarrhea due to Shigella. The effect of antibiotic therapy on intake of food and absorption of nutrients for 19 male children aged 1-5 years with suspected shigella infection was studied. The children were admitted to the hospital with acute diarrhea, high fever, abdominal pain, and greater than or equal to 25 red blood cells and white blood cells per high-power field in the stool. Microbiologic diagnosis was made within 48 hours of admission. On the basis of clinical and microbiologic criteria, children were classified as having mild or severe infection. Ten children with mild infection did not receive antibiotics, whereas nine children with severe infection were treated with ampicillin. After the children were rehydrated, a 72-hour balance study was carried out during the acute stage of infection with Shigella and was repeated 2 weeks after recovery. The levels of consumption of food and absorption of nutrients were estimated. During the acute stage of infection, such levels were higher for the children treated with antibiotics than for the untreated group. During the recovery phase, the levels of intake of food and absorption of nutrients were equal for both groups. Thus, children who are treated with appropriate antibiotics not only may recover from infection with Shigella more rapidly, but they also may be able to absorb nutrients more efficiently. 
Flexible bronchoscopy via the laryngeal mask: a new technique. Malignant tracheal tumours often cause airway obstruction and this may be aggravated by vocal cord paralysis due to invasion of the recurrent laryngeal nerve. Conventional endoscopic techniques performed under general anaesthesia do not give a simultaneous view of vocal cord function and the distal airways. The technique of bronchoscopy via the laryngeal mask allowed full assessment of the cause of stridor in a patient with a malignant tracheal tumour that was causing airways obstruction and vocal cord paralysis. 
On the pathogenesis of diabetic retinopathy. A 1990 update. Although most investigators now agree that chronic hyperglycemia is the basis for diabetic retinopathy, this has not been proven definitively. Even if chronic hyperglycemia is the initial common pathway leading to retinopathy and other complications of diabetes, it appears to act by different mechanisms in different tissues. The enzyme, aldose reductase, may play a major role in the development of diabetic retinopathy, but contradictory evidence exists. At the present time, results of the only study of aldose reductase inhibition and diabetic retinopathy reported in humans were negative. Another mechanism worthy of consideration is nonenzymatic glycation (glycosylation) of proteins, but there is no direct evidence of a causal role in diabetic retinopathy. Several growth factors have been identified in the retina that may promote neovascularization, and at least two inhibitors may prevent the process. There is evidence to support a role for basic and, perhaps, acidic fibroblast growth factors in retinal vasoproliferation. Transforming growth-factor beta, a peptide produced by capillary pericytes and smooth muscle cells and activated by the interaction of these cells with vascular endothelial cells, appears to be an important inhibitor of neovascularization, as is the vascular basement membrane. 
Female urethra: MR imaging. The potential of magnetic resonance (MR) imaging in the evaluation of the female urethra was studied in 64 patients. Spin-echo T1- and T2-weighted images were obtained in all 64 patients, and contrast-enhanced T1-weighted images were also obtained in 27 patients. Urethral pathologic conditions, established with urethroscopy or histologic examination, or both, included urethral diverticula, inflammatory granuloma, and primary and metastatic neoplasms. On T2-weighted images, all normal urethras demonstrated a characteristic targetlike appearance with differentiation among the outer ring of low signal intensity, the middle zone of higher signal intensity, and the center of low signal intensity. After injection of gadopentetate dimeglumine, the targetlike appearance of the normal urethra was seen on the T1-weighted images. Urethral diverticula were detected with MR imaging in all nine patients with that diagnosis, and in each, MR imaging demonstrated urethral expansion, distortion of the zonal anatomy, and presence of fluid in the middle zone. Primary or metastatic urethral neoplasms were also detected with MR imaging in every patient with the diagnosis, but differentiation between benign and malignant disease was not possible. Local staging of primary or metastatic malignant disease was correct in eight of the 11 patients. In three patients, the inflammatory changes could not be differentiated from tumor invasion, resulting in overestimation of tumor extent. 
Purpura fulminans and adrenal hemorrhage due to group Y meningococcemia in an elderly woman. A 70-year-old previously healthy woman was admitted with a 1-day history of malaise, sore throat, nausea, vomiting, rigors, and confusion. She was found to be in septic shock with purpura fulminans and disseminated intravascular coagulation. She died within 36 hours of admission. Blood cultures grew Neisseria meningitidis group Y. Necropsy revealed evidence of shock and bilateral adrenal hemorrhage. 
Intracardiac mobile thrombus and D-dimer fragment of fibrin in patients with mitral stenosis. OBJECTIVE--To investigate the relation between intracardiac thrombus and blood coagulability in patients with mitral stenosis. DESIGN--Prospective study. Cross sectional echocardiography and plasma concentrations of the D-dimer fragment of fibrin were used concurrently to detect intracardiac thrombus in patients with mitral stenosis. SETTING--Department of Medicine, National Cardiovascular Centre, Osaka, Japan. PATIENTS--63 patients with mitral stenosis. None of them had been receiving any anticoagulants or antiplatelet agents. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES--Plasma concentrations of D-dimer in patients with a mobile intracardiac thrombus, those in patients with a non-mobile intracardiac thrombus, and those in patients without an intracardiac thrombus. RESULTS--A mobile intracardiac thrombus was found in 10 patients and a non-mobile thrombus in eight. The remaining 45 patients had no intracardiac thrombi. Plasma concentrations of D-dimer in the 10 patients with a mobile thrombus were all greater than 300 ng/ml (mean 983.3, 95% confidence interval 498.9 to 1467.7 ng/ml) and they were significantly higher than those in the patients with a non-mobile thrombus (226.2, 33.6 to 418.8 ng/ml) and the patients without an intracardiac thrombus (147.2, 110.4 to 184 ng/ml). CONCLUSIONS--A high plasma concentration of D-dimer seemed to reflect a hypercoagulable intracardiac state and may be a helpful indicator of the possible presence of mobile intracardiac thrombus in patients with mitral stenosis. 
Prospective clinical and manometric study comparing pneumatic dilatation and sublingual nifedipine in the treatment of oesophageal achalasia. A study was carried out in 30 patients affected by a mild or moderate degree of oesophageal achalasia to compare the clinical and manometric effects of sublingual nifedipine and pneumatic dilatation. Sixteen patients were dilated twice with Rider-Moeller dilators and 14 were treated with sublingual nifedipine 10-20 mg 30 minutes before meals. A manometric evaluation was performed before and six months after starting treatment. The clinical evaluation (according to Vantrappen's criteria) was performed every three months for a mean follow up of 21 months. In both groups of patients a significant (p less than 0.001) fall in lower oesophageal sphincter pressure was observed after treatment and excellent or good clinical results were observed in 75% of dilated patients and in 77% of patients treated with nifedipine. One patient could not tolerate nifedipine. No complications were observed after dilatation. It is concluded that longterm treatment with sublingual nifedipine and pneumatic dilatation are equally effective in the treatment of oesophageal achalasia of mild or moderate degree. 
Mutations of the p53 gene in lymphoid leukemia. p53 is currently considered to be a tumor suppressor gene product, and its alterations are suggested to be involved in several human malignancies. Here we show evidence of the possible involvement of p53 gene mutations in lymphoid leukemias studied by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction, single strand conformation polymorphism analysis, and nucleotide sequencing. Fourteen patients with various leukemias were examined and two with acute lymphoblastic leukemia and one with Waldenstrom's macroglobulinemia were identified to have mutations in the coding region of the p53 gene. These mutations included point mutation, triplet deletion, and single nucleotide insertion. Furthermore, expression of the wild-type p53 mRNA was not detected in the samples from these three patients. In one of them, chromosome 17p was deleted, suggesting the absence of the nonmutated p53 gene, whereas in the other two patients, chromosome 17p seemed to be intact by cytogenetic analysis. Our results suggest that alterations of the p53 gene may have a role in the genesis of some leukemias. 
Changes in quantitative SPECT thallium-201 results associated with the use of energy-weighted acquisition. The effect of utilizing energy-weighted acquisition on quantitative analysis of SPECT thallium-201 images was evaluated by simultaneously acquiring energy-weighted and windowed projection images in ten patients. The paired image sets were processed identically and evaluated by probability analysis of defect magnitude as indicated by a commercially available software analysis package. It was predicted that defect magnitude would increase as a result of improved image contrast. This was confirmed experimentally. One should be cautious in relying on strict quantitative criteria in cardiac studies with thallium-201, especially when major changes in the imaging system or technique are introduced. 
Lymphomatous presentation of childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia. A subgroup at high risk of early treatment failure. Multivariate analyses of the clinical course of 1537 children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) identified a subgroup which experienced short remission duration and a high incidence of extramedullary relapse. The patients differed from other ALL patients by the presence at diagnosis of two or more of a constellation of clinical and laboratory features: organomegaly or mass disease, E-rosette positivity, hemoglobin level greater than 10 g/dl, leukocyte count greater than 50,000/microliters, male predominance, and older age. This type of presentation of ALL is referred to as the "lymphoma syndrome" (LS) since such patients exhibit a pattern of several clinical and laboratory features which were observed repeatedly but in differing combinations, and some of which clinically resemble lymphoma. A subsequent database from 2231 patients was analyzed. Patients with a mediastinal mass, massive splenomegaly, or massive adenopathy, alone or in combination, had a worse outcome when the patient also had either leukocytosis, E-rosette-positive lymphoblasts, or a normal or near normal hemoglobin (Hb) level at diagnosis. Similarly, the above three laboratory features alone or in combination did not predict less than 40% disease-free survival (DFS) unless they were accompanied by at least one of the clinical features of mass disease. When at least one clinical feature and at least one laboratory feature were present, the overall DFS was 36% 6 years after diagnosis versus 64% for all other patients. The association of these features with poor prognosis remained significant after adjusting for the level of leukocyte count at diagnosis, age at diagnosis, and sex of the patients. Patients with this recurrent syndrome of features do not represent a homogeneous biologic entity but they constitute a subgroup of patients with ALL having a high risk of treatment failure using current therapies, including failure to achieve remission, early relapse, and increased frequency of relapse in extramedullary sites. They deserve early recognition at diagnosis and selection of treatment strategies appropriate for very high risk ALL. 
Chronic xerostomia increases esophageal acid exposure and is associated with esophageal injury. OBJECTIVE: To assess the effects of chronic xerostomia on parameters of gastroesophageal reflux and esophagitis. DESIGN: Observational study of a cohort of male patients with xerostomia and age-matched control subjects. SETTING: Tertiary-care Veterans Affairs Medical Center. SUBJECTS: Sixteen male patients with chronic xerostomia secondary to radiation for head and neck cancers or medications. Nineteen age-matched male control subjects with comparable alcohol and smoking histories. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Esophageal motility was similar in patients with xerostomia and controls. Clearance of acid from the esophagus and 24-hour intraesophageal pH were markedly abnormal in patients with xerostomia. Symptoms and signs of esophagitis were significantly more frequent in subjects with xerostomia. CONCLUSIONS: Chronic xerostomia may predispose to esophageal injury, at least in part, by decreasing the clearance of acid from the esophagus and altering 24-hour intraesophageal pH. Esophageal injury is a previously unreported complication of long-term salivary deficiency. 
Insulin and glucagon therapy of acute hepatic failure. When insulin and glucagon are administered to rats with severe liver injury, survival is enhanced with an attenuation of the liver injury compared to that of untreated controls. In rats with acute liver injury both hormones produce a rapid normalization of hepatic protein content following initiation of DNA synthesis. When rats receive both hormones after partial hepatectomy, the first burst of DNA synthesis reaches a maximum earlier than that seen in controls. Both hormones enhance the increment of hepatic putrescine essential for DNA synthesis through activation of ornithine decaroxylase and/or spermidine-N1-acetyltransferase. The enhancement of putrescine content by each hormone is additive. Putrescine supplementation promotes hepatic DNA synthesis after hepatectomy. Based on these data, we conclude that a combination of insulin and glucagon is effective in the therapy of acute hepatic failure in rats. The restoration of liver function as well as the stimulation of liver cell proliferation via putrescine production may contribute to this effect. 
Obesity, a disorder of nutrient partitioning: the MONA LISA hypothesis. The mechanisms underlying different types of obesity have been gradually clarified. Animal models with hypothalamic, genetic or dietary obesity have been examined with a feedback model. Four common final pathways are involved in this model. One of these final common pathways is the sympathetic nervous system. Most Obesities kNown Are Low In Sympathetic Activity states the MONA LISA Hypothesis. A second common pathway is the endocrine system involving adrenal glucocorticosteroids. The third common pathway is hyperphagia. Although not essential for most obesities, hyperphagia may be essential in animals with injury to the hypothalamic paraventricular nucleus. The final pathway is reduced physical activity. The tonic activity of these systems and their response to changes in the diet affect nutrient partitioning between fat and protein. This framework has been used to review genetic obesity, hypothalamic obesity and dietary obesity. 
A double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of topical PUVA in persistent palmoplantar pustulosis. The effect of topical PUVA was investigated in the treatment of patients with persistent palmoplantar pustulosis (PPP). In this double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of 27 patients with PPP there was an overall improvement of the hands and feet in both the active and placebo-treated areas and little difference between them. 
Initial two-year results of the Oregon Liver Transplantation Program. During the first 24 months of the Oregon Liver Transplantation Program, which began in October 1988, 94 patients were formally evaluated and 47 adults underwent 54 liver transplantations. Thirty-four percent of patients were veterans. The recipient operation lasted a mean of 7.4 hours (range: 4 to 16 hours). Veno-venous bypass was used routinely at first but selectively later (7 of the last 26 cases), resulting in reduced operating time. Hepatic artery reconstruction was end-to-end anastomosis in 52 cases and iliac conduit in 2. No arterial thrombosis occurred. Biliary reconstruction was choledochocholedochostomy in 83% and choledochojejunostomy in 17%. Biliary complications occurred in 28%. Operative mortality was 2%, and 1-year actual survival was 80%. Patients with hepatitis B fared worse, with four of six dying at a mean of 7.6 months. Overall, the median hospital stay was 30 days. Patients surviving more than 3 months had a mean Karnofsky score of 82%. No significant difference in outcome was noted in patients receiving prophylactic OKT3 monoclonal antibody (used in 45%) versus conventional immunosuppressive therapy. Overall, allograft rejection occurred in 55% of patients. Retransplantation was required in seven patients, three for primary graft nonfunction, two for uncontrolled rejection during induction therapy with OKT3, and two for graft failure secondary to recurrent hepatitis B. 
Evidence for a pathogenic linkage between glomerular hypertrophy and sclerosis. Primary renal disease of immunologic or nonimmunologic mechanisms induces loss of substantial nephron population. It is presumed that the initial loss of functioning nephrons causes alterations of function and metabolism in remnant nephrons, which per se are self-inflictive, leading to further loss of nephrons. The ultimate outcome of this vicious cycle is the end-stage kidney. The potential role of various pathophysiologic mechanisms has been explored. These studies have shown a tight link between glomerular hypertrophy and sclerosis. Analysis of individual glomeruli show a biphasic pattern of these two parameters. Early development of glomerular sclerosis takes place along with the hypertrophy of the glomerulus, and further advancement of sclerosis occurs with shrinkage in glomerular size. Thus, we propose that, after initial nephron loss, the remnant glomeruli are exposed to increased growth-promoting factors, which are self-inflictive in nature due to their capacity to produce excessive amounts of extracellular matrix in the mesangial area. When the excessive matrix obliterates the glomerular capillary lumen, a typical sclerotic lesion appears. This is a vicious and accelerating process, since sclerosis induces further reduction in the nephron population, thereby imposing greater influence of growth-promoting factors even on glomeruli that are initially resistant. 
Endorectal sonography in the evaluation of rectal and perirectal disease. Endorectal sonography initially was developed for evaluation of the prostate and now has been adapted for evaluation of rectal and perirectal disease. We used endorectal sonography to evaluate a spectrum of diseases, including primary and recurrent rectal carcinoma, metastases, villous adenoma, leiomyosarcoma, endometriosis, sacrococcygeal teratoma, chordoma, retroperitoneal cystic hamartoma, pelvic lipomatosis, diverticulitis, and perirectal abscess. The technique has been useful in localization of perirectal abscesses and in sonographically guided biopsy of perirectal masses. Knowledge of normal sonographic anatomy of the rectum is essential in the evaluation of rectal and perirectal disease. In this essay, we describe the technique of endorectal sonography and illustrate the sonographic findings in a variety of diseases. 
Electrophysiologic analysis of early Parkinson's disease. We have been interested in the application of quantitative measures of motor performance as a possible means of early detection of Parkinson's disease. To assess motor function, we have measured movement time (the physiologic correlate of bradykinesia) and reaction time (simple and directional choice) with an upper limb motor task, and tremor with accelerometry and electromyographic recordings. In this report we describe preliminary data from a Parkinson's disease patient group with symptoms of fewer than 2 years' average duration (compared with an age- and gender-matched normal control group) which indicate that precise, quantitative tests of motor function can detect the slight deviations from normal that are present in early Parkinson's disease. It appears that tests of bradykinesia are most sensitive, and detection of rest tremor is most specific. These tests may be applicable in screening individuals who are suspected of having or are "at risk for" Parkinson's disease and other related disorders. 
Total replacement for post-traumatic arthritis of the elbow. Fifty-three of 55 consecutive elbow replacements for post-traumatic arthritis were followed for a minimum of two years (mean 6.3, range 2 to 14.4). The patients presented difficult management problems, having undergone an average of two previous operations per joint; 22 joints had suffered prior complications; 18 had less than 50 degrees of flexion and six were flail. One of three versions of the Coonrad prosthesis was employed in all. During the follow-up period, 10 patients underwent 14 revision procedures for aseptic loosening; 38 elbows are currently without progressive radiolucent lines. In two patients an elbow had to be resected, one for deep infection and the other for bone resorption following a foreign-body reaction to titanium. The current design of the Coonrad prosthesis offers a reliable option for the treatment of post-traumatic arthritis but should be used only in carefully selected patients over the age of 60 years. 
Total excision and extra-anatomic bypass for aortic graft infection. Reports of high mortality and amputation rates following total excision and extra-anatomic bypass for aortic graft infection have prompted the use of alternate approaches including local antibiotics, partial resection, in situ revascularization, and graft excision without revascularization. Experience with aortic graft infection was reviewed to establish current morbidity and mortality rates and evaluate our bias in favor of total excision and extra-anatomic bypass. Aortic graft infection was identified in 32 patients, 8 with aortoenteric fistulas. The mean interval between graft placement and infection was 34 months. History of groin exposure (75%) or multiple prior vascular surgery (50%) was common. Clinical signs included fever and/or leukocytosis (23 patients), false aneurysm (9 patients), graft thrombosis (6 patients), groin infection (11 patients), and gastrointestinal hemorrhage (6 patients). Microbiologic data, available in 26 patients, demonstrated gram-positive organisms in 15 patients and gram-negative in 9. Multiple organisms were seen in 11 patients. Patients were treated by partial removal with (8 patients) or without (4 patients) revascularization or total removal with (18 patients) or without (2 patients) revascularization. Revascularization was by an extra-anatomic route, either simultaneous or staged. Overall morbidity/mortality was less in the revascularized groups (p = 0.01), while late complications were seen only after partial removal (p less than 0.01). The best results were found after total excision with revascularization. No patient in this group experienced late infection or amputation during a mean follow-up of 34 months (range: 1 to 168 months). Complications after total excision and extra-anatomic bypass for aortic graft infection are lower than generally appreciated. This approach should remain the standard to which other approaches are compared. 
Primary squamous cell carcinoma of a gastric remnant. A 77-yr-old male developed primary gastric squamous cell carcinoma 33 yr after gastric resection for peptic ulcer disease. At the time of diagnosis, he was being endoscopically followed for large irregular stomal polyps. Infiltrating squamous cell carcinoma with focal keratinization and stomal polypoid hypertrophic gastritis was found. Previous reports describe adenocarcinoma and adenosquamous carcinoma in gastric remnants. There are various theories as to how such a tumor may arise in this setting. 
Acoustic neuroma: a cost-effective approach. A cost-effective approach to the diagnosis and treatment of acoustic neuromas continues to evolve as diagnostic methods improve. In the past 7 months, since gadolinium-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has become available in our practice, our screening and presurgical workup has changed. The purpose of this article is to outline the current philosophy of the senior authors in relation to acoustic neuroma management on the basis of 72 patients diagnosed from July 1988 to February 1989. With more sensitive diagnostic means, older less sensitive studies may be eliminated from the routine workup, thus maintaining cost-effectiveness while preserving the highest standard of patient care. The body of this article will review our current use of the many available diagnostic options and emphasize a cost-effective approach. 
Aortic valve replacement with omniscience and omnicarbon valves. Clinical results achieved in 100 cases of aortic valve replacement with the Omniscience (O-S) valve during the period from 1980 to 1985 as well as 100 cases of aortic valve replacement with the Omnicarbon (O-C) valve during the period from 1985 to 1989 were studied. Concomitant surgical procedures including mitral valve replacement were performed in 63 patients in the O-S group and 67 patients in the O-C group. Cumulative follow-up in the two groups was carried out for a total of 559 and 273 patient-years, respectively. The overall 4-year actuarial survival rate was 82% +/- 3.8% in the O-S group and 89.5% +/- 3.2% in the O-C group, the corresponding rates for patients undergoing isolated aortic valve replacement being 82.9% +/- 4.2% in the O-S group and 91.9% +/- 3.5% in the O-C group. The overall 4-year actuarial event-free rate with respect to thromboembolic complications was 88.8% +/- 3.3% in the O-S group and 94.4% +/- 2.8% in the O-C group, as compared with the corresponding rates of 89.2% +/- 3.6% in the O-S group and 95.9% +/- 2.8% in the O-C group for patients undergoing isolated aortic valve replacement. The overall rate of valve-related complications, including thromboembolism, anticoagulant-related hemorrhage, perivalvular leak, infection, and structural failure, was 78.8% +/- 4.2% in the O-S group and 89.3% +/- 3.5% in the O-C group (p less than 0.05), and for isolated aortic valve replacement, 79.7% +/- 4.5% in the O-S group and 89.6% +/- 4.1% in the O-C group. 
Results of a multicenter study of the modified hook-titanium Greenfield filter. Initial efforts to modify the stainless steel Greenfield filter for percutaneous insertion led to development of a titanium Greenfield filter, which could be inserted by use of a 12F carrier. This device functioned well as a filter but had an unacceptable 30% rate of migration, tilting, and penetration. Therefore a titanium Greenfield filter with modified hooks was developed and has been tested in 186 patients at 10 institutions. Successful placement occurred in 181 (97%); placement of the remainder was precluded by unfavorable anatomy. A contraindication to anticoagulation was the most frequent indication for insertion (75%). All but two were inserted percutaneously, predominantly via the right femoral vein (70%). Initial incomplete opening was seen in four patients (2%), which was corrected by guide wire manipulation and asymmetry of the legs in 10 (5.4%). Insertion site hematoma occurred in one patient, and apical penetration of the cava during insertion occurred in a second patient. Both events were without sequelae. Follow-up examinations were performed at 30 days at which time 35 deaths had occurred. Recurrent embolism was suspected in six patients (3%) and two of three deaths were confirmed by autopsy. Filter movement greater than 9 mm was seen in 13 patients, (11%) and increase in base diameter greater than or equal to 5 mm was seen in 17 patients (14%). CT scanning showed evidence of caval penetration in only one patient (0.8%). Insertion site venous thrombosis was seen in 4/46 (8.7%) patients screened. The modified hook titanium Greenfield filter is inserted percutaneously or operatively through a sheath, eliminating concern for misplacement from premature discharge. 
Colonic complications after toxic tribal enemas. Tribal enemas obtained from traditional healers are used widely in Southern Africa for a variety of indications. Inclusion of injurious substances such as potassium dichromate may cause serious colonic and renal complications. Nine such patients, in seven of whom chromate use was confirmed, presented after a mean delay of 7.3 days. All patients had bloody diarrhoea and vomiting and three underwent major colonic resection, requiring a total of ten procedures. One patient suffered mechanical perforation of the rectum, with subsequent necrotizing fasciitis, necessitating rectal excision. Eight patients had acute renal failure and seven required dialysis. One patient died. At follow-up one patient has chronic renal failure and only three are completely well. Although local medical practitioners are aware of the problem, the challenge of preventing harmful cultural practices remains. 
Intradermal hepatitis B vaccination. The availability of vaccine since 1982 for immunization against hepatitis B virus (HBV) has had minimal impact on the disease; mass immunization has been suggested. Intradermal vaccination, which has precedent in prophylaxis of other infectious diseases, has been investigated as a low-cost alternative to traditional intramuscular HBV vaccination. Results of open and comparative trials indicate similar seroconversion rates for intradermal and intramuscular HBV vaccination routes in healthy adults. However, antibody titers and, presumably, duration of antibody protection appear to be decreased with intradermal HBV vaccination. Limited data suggest that demographic factors such as age and gender may affect vaccine responsiveness to intradermal HBV vaccine. Adverse skin reactions are common but do not represent a deterrent to continued intradermal HBV vaccination. There is a need for large-scale prospective comparative trials to substantiate the value of intradermal HBV vaccination. Nevertheless, the potential economic and epidemiologic benefit of intradermal vaccination justifies continued investigation for prevention of HBV infection. 
Meckel cave lesions: percutaneous fine-needle-aspiration biopsy cytology. The authors describe the novel combination of two traditional methods to facilitate diagnosis of Meckel cave lesions, which may otherwise require craniotomy to obtain adequate tissue samples. Fine-needle-aspiration biopsy cytology was performed on tissue obtained with a percutaneous approach via the foramen ovale with use of fluoroscopic guidance and intravenous analgesia during an outpatient procedure. This new application of fine-needle-aspiration biopsy cytology results in decreased patient morbidity and significant cost reduction. 
Audit of outpatients: entering the loop. OBJECTIVE--To develop and test a method for routine data collection to observe current practice in outpatient pain clinics. DESIGN--Prospective questionnaire survey completed by consultants on each patient seen during October 1989 to May 1990. SETTING--Outpatient pain clinics of five teaching and five district general hospitals in Scotland and northern England. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES--Number of new referrals and their source, and characteristics of pain at presentation. RESULTS--4354 forms were completed by 21 consultants over 29 weeks, corresponding to 2241 patients, of whom 981 were new referrals. The proportion of consultations at which new referrals were seen varied among the 10 clinics from 15% to 34%. The difference could not be accounted for by type of hospital. Sources of new referrals varied widely between the clinics (for example, range 22% to 78% for general practitioner referrals), as did new referrals by the type of pain (range 10.8% to 55.2% for low back pain, 10.5% to 32.5% for pain associated with surgery). However, these differences in types of patients seen could not be accounted for by variations in referral patterns among clinics. Problems identified in performing an audit of outpatients included the difficulty of obtaining firm diagnoses, the need for a method to link successive patient contacts, and the complexity of the presenting problem in many patients. CONCLUSIONS--It is possible to collect data for audit routinely in outpatient clinics. Observation of current practice in the clinics suggested possible unmet need or inappropriate management, which may require changes in practice. 
Indications and limitations of aortic valve reconstruction. To elucidate the value of conservative operation for aortic regurgitation, all consecutive patients operated on between July 1988 and July 1990 were reviewed. Of 251 patients with aortic regurgitation, 107 (42.6%) had nonprosthetic operation. The mean age was 23 years, and 90 patients (84.1%) were rheumatic. Two techniques were used: repair (annular and leaflet plasties, 69 cases) and cusp extension with glutaraldehyde-treated pericardium (25 bovine, 13 autologous). There were two hospital deaths (1.8%), both in the repair group, and no late deaths or embolic events. Only 5 patients (4.7%) were anticoagulated. In the repair group there were 12 reoperations, four (5.9%) due to aortic and eight to mitral dysfunction. In the cusp extension group there were two reoperations due to mitral dysfunction. Echocardiographic follow-up showed better results with cusp extension. In conclusion, conservative operation for aortic regurgitation is possible in a high percentage of young rheumatic patients and does not require anticoagulation. Cusp extension is more reliable than repair in terms of early results, although its long-term durability is not yet known. 
Influence of human immunodeficiency virus infection on cell-mediated immunity in chronic D hepatitis. To determine whether the abnormalities of cell-mediated immunity described in chronic D hepatitis are associated with hepatitis D virus (HDV) infection or concomitant human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection, serologic and tissue hepatitis B virus (HBV) and HDV markers and T lymphocyte subsets were studied in serum samples from 38 patients with chronic D hepatitis, 26 of whom had HIV infection. Patients with chronic D hepatitis and HIV infection had significantly lower peripheral blood T4:T8 ratios resulting from a significant increase in T8+ (suppressor/cytotoxic) cells, while numbers of T lymphocyte subsets were normal in cases with chronic D hepatitis only. HIV+ patients showed an increase in HBV replication (identified by hepatitis B core antigen in liver and hepatitis B e antigen and HBV DNA in serum) and in HDV replication (tissue D antigen and HDV RNA) without evidence of more active liver disease. Probably the immunologic disturbances detected in chronic D hepatitis are secondary to HIV infection, do not contribute to the pathogenesis of liver injury, and are associated with increased viral B and D replication. 
Differential diagnosis of head and neck lesions based on their space of origin. 2. The infrahyoid portion of the neck. The infrahyoid portion of the neck can be considered as a series of contiguous fascial planes and intervening spaces that lend themselves well to axial imaging. These spaces can serve as a basis on which to formulate differential diagnoses for diseases in this region. This pictorial essay describes the fascia and fascial spaces of the infrahyoid portion of the neck. The contents of each space, the common abnormalities affecting the space, and the characteristic displacements produced by disease in each space are reviewed. 
Congestive heart failure symptoms in patients with preserved left ventricular systolic function: analysis of the CASS registry. The clinical characteristics and long-term survival of 284 patients from the Coronary Artery Surgery Study (CASS) registry data base who had moderate to severe congestive heart failure symptoms and a left ventricular ejection fraction greater than or equal to 0.45 were studied. A control group consisting of registry patients with an ejection fraction greater than or equal to 0.45 who did not have heart failure was used for comparison. Patients who had heart failure were older and more likely to be female and to have a higher incidence of hypertension, diabetes and chronic lung disease than registry patients who did not have heart failure. As a group, patients with heart failure had more severe angina and were more likely to have had a prior myocardial infarction than were registry patients without heart failure. At 6 year follow-up, 82% of patients in the heart failure group survived compared with 91% of patients in the control group (p less than 0.0001). Multivariate analysis using the Cox proportional hazards model identified the following independent predictors of mortality: regional ventricular systolic dysfunction, number of diseased coronary arteries, advanced age, hypertension, lung disease, diabetes, increased left ventricular end-diastolic pressure and heart failure symptoms. Among patients with heart failure, the 6-year survival rate of those who had three-vessel coronary artery disease was 68% compared with 92% for the group without coronary artery disease. However, the 6-year survival rate for patients with heart failure who underwent surgical revascularization of diseased coronary arteries was not significantly improved compared with that of patients treated medically. 
Carcinoid tumour of the gastrointestinal tract: prognostic factors and disease outcome. This study represents retrospective analysis of 87 patients with a carcinoid tumour of the gastrointestinal tract seen and followed in the British Columbia Cancer Agency (BCCA) from 1960 to 1986. In 49 cases, the primary site was the small bowel. The rest of the cases were distributed as follows: 11 appendix, 10 rectum, 5 stomach, and 7 undetermined. We extrapolated the Dukes' and modified Astler-Coller surgicopathological classifications used for colorectal cancer for use in our cases of carcinoid tumour of the gastrointestinal tract. A strong correlation was found, using this staging, with disease-specific survival. Other prognostic factors included histologic differentiation, the presence of macroscopic residual disease after initial surgery, and level of 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid (5-HIAA) in urine. Among 51 patients with surgically grossly removed disease, there was a tendency for the development of distant and distant/locoregional recurrence more often than locoregional recurrence alone. The liver was the commonest site of distant recurrence. Analysis of the effect of radiotherapy or chemotherapy on carcinoid tumour of the gastrointestinal tract proved unsuccessful because only a small portion of the patients had this treatment, and it was used mainly for palliation. 
Contemporary management of neurofibromatosis. The neurofibromatoses are two distinct entities with different genetic origins. The phenotypic expressions and required treatments are different. The devastating nature of neurofibromatosis-2 may be more effectively controlled through the application of advanced imaging techniques and contemporary neurotologic procedures. The most common manifestation of neurofibromatosis-2 is that of bilateral acoustic neuromas. The eventual total bilateral sensorineural deafness associated with this condition can be obviated in selected cases if the diagnosis is established early. Follow-up data are reported for three patients in whom hearing was preserved in at least one ear. When removal with hearing preservation is not possible, subtotal tumor removal with decompression of the internal auditory canals may delay progression of hearing loss. A new approach to tumors of the pterygomaxillary fossa that have extended to the middle cranial fossa has been successfully applied and is described. 
Growth hormone deficiency following radiation therapy of primary brain tumors in children. The medical records of 123 patients treated for brain tumors at Children's Hospital and Medical Center, Seattle, Washington, between 1985 and 1987 were reviewed. The endocrinological complications of radiation therapy and the effectiveness of growth hormone (GH) replacement therapy were assessed. These were the first 2 years after synthetic GH became available. The disease pathology was confirmed at craniotomy or biopsy in 108 patients. Ninety-five children completed radiation therapy and 65 of these were alive at the time of review; these 65 children represent the study population. The most common tumor types were medulloblastoma, craniopharyngioma, and ependymoma. Endocrine evaluation was initiated with changes in the patients' growth velocity. Patient workup included skeletal x-ray films for determination of bone and analysis of thyroxin, thyroid-stimulating hormone, and somatomedin-C levels. Following 1-dopa and clonidine stimulation, provocative studies of GH levels were performed. Growth hormone failure and short stature were observed in 26 children, most commonly in the 2nd year after tumor treatment. Eight patients with GH failure were also hypothyroid. Hormone replacement therapy was initiated with recombinant GH, 0.05 mg/kg/day, and all children so treated showed an increase in height, with eight patients experiencing catch-up growth. There were no complications of therapy or tumor recurrence. Studies of baseline bone age and somatomedin-C levels on completion of radiation therapy are recommended. Comprehensive endocrine studies should follow changes in the patients' growth velocity. With early GH replacement, catch-up growth is possible and normal adult heights may be achieved. 
Subarachnoid hemorrhage in sickle-cell disease. The neurological complications of sickle-cell disease include cerebral intracerebral hemorrhage; subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) has been infrequently reported. Among 325 patients with sickle-cell disease followed at the University of Illinois between 1975 and 1989, 11 cases of SAH were identified. Aneurysms were found in 10 of these patients, three of whom had multiple aneurysms. All of the patients had some degree of anemia and nine underwent craniotomy without hematological or neurological complications. From this review it appears that SAH is not uncommon in sickle-cell disease patients and tends to occur at a younger age and with smaller aneurysm size than in the general population. With proper perioperative management, including exchange transfusions to reduce the proportion of hemoglobin S to less than 30%, these patients can undergo angiography and craniotomy without an increased incidence of complications. The techniques used in managing sickle-cell disease patients with SAH are discussed. 
Selective expression of CD45 isoforms defines CALLA+ monoclonal B-lineage cells in peripheral blood from myeloma patients as late stage B cells. The peripheral blood lymphocytes from 42 patients with multiple myeloma (MM) and 13 patients with monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS) were studied by three-color immunofluorescence (IF) using antibodies directed to a broad range of B-cell markers (CD19, CD20, CD21, CD24), CALLA (CD10), PCA-1 (a plasma cell marker), and to the high and low molecular weight isoforms of the leukocyte common antigen, CD45RA (p205/220) and CD45RO (p 180). CD45RA is expressed on pre-B and B cells, and a transition from CD45RA to CD45RO defines differentiation towards plasma cells. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) from patients with myeloma included a large subset of B-lineage cells (mean of 39% to 45%) that were CALLA+ and PCA-1+ in all patients studied, including newly diagnosed patients and patients undergoing chemotherapy. Southern blot analysis indicated the presence of monoclonal Ig rearrangements in PBMC and a substantial reduction in the germ-line bands consistent with the presence of a large monoclonal B-cell subset. Avoidance of purification methods involving depletion of adherent cells was essential for detection of the abnormal B cells. Phenotypically, this abnormal B-cell population corresponded to late B or early pre-plasma cells (20% to 80% of PBMC), as defined by the concomitant expression of low densities of CD19 and CD20, moderate densities of CALLA and PCA-1, and strong expression of CD45RO on all B cells, with weakly coexpressed CD45RA on a small proportion. Heterogeneity in the expression of CD45RA and CD45RO within the abnormal B-cell population from any given patient suggested multiple differentiation stages. Abnormal B cells similar to those in MM were also detected in MGUS, although as a lower proportion of PBMC (26%). Abnormal B cells from patients with MGUS expressed predominantly the CD45RO isoform, but had a lower proportion of CALLA+ and PCA-1+ cells than were found on B cells from MM. This work indicates that the large subset of circulating monoclonal B lymphocytes from myeloma patients are at a late stage in B-cell differentiation, continuously progressing towards the plasma cell stage. 
Preventing heel ulcers: a comparison of prophylactic body-support systems. Five commercially available body-support systems used in the prevention of decubitus heel ulcers were objectively compared for their capacity to dissipate or decrease pressure concentration at the most prominent posterior aspect of the heel in bedridden, insensate patients. The Foot Drop Stop, a foam heel suspender, completely eliminated contact between the heel and the bed, and it was the most successful in decreasing pressure concentration. The space boot and foam heel protectors were far more successful than sheepskin rugs or polyester heel protectors, which provided little protection to the prominent heel. 
Unilateral hydrocephalus: prenatal sonographic diagnosis. We studied six cases of unilateral hydrocephalus detected prenatally to analyze the sonographic features of the abnormality and to determine the cause and clinical outcome. In all cases, third-trimester sonograms showed marked unilateral lateral ventriculomegaly (mean atrial width, 4.4 cm) and normal contralateral lateral, third, and fourth ventricles. Five of the six cases had marked thinning of the cortical mantle on the affected side and shift of midline structures to the contralateral side. The causes of unilateral hydrocephalus were agenesis or stenosis of the foramen of Monro in three cases, transient obstruction of the foramen in one fetus with an intraventricular hematoma, underlying brain dysplasia in one fetus with a variant of holoprosencephaly, and undetermined in one case. All six neonates had placement of a ventriculoperitoneal shunt catheter; four of these have had normal cognitive development at follow-up. The remaining two infants have moderate to severe developmental impairment. Unilateral hydrocephalus is a rare anomaly that can be recognized by prenatal sonography. Even though unilateral ventriculomegaly may be marked, early diagnosis and treatment may result in a favorable clinical outcome. 
An overview of ankle arthrodesis. Arthrodesis of the ankle can result in a painless, normal walking gait. However, complications in ankle arthrodesis can be major, and can occur when anatomy, deformity, or bony deficiency is not properly addressed. Nonoperative treatment should always be considered first, and, if possible, an open or arthroscopic ankle debridement can provide significant pain relief. Arthrodesis should be considered after conservative treatment fails. Infections, deformity, sensory deficiencies, and bony defects require special consideration. The use of bone graft and internal or external compression will enhance the likelihood of a successful arthrodesis. 
Glandular odontogenic cyst: clinicopathologic analysis of three cases. The glandular odontogenic cyst is a rare cyst of odontogenic origin, first described in 1988 by Gardner et al. Three previously unreported glandular odontogenic cysts are presented; none recurred after the initial surgical treatment, and one example was associated with a squamous odontogenic tumor-like proliferation in the wall. Ten similar cases were found in the literature, and their clinical and roentgenographic features, and follow-up, have been compared with the present cases. 
Progression of scleral disease. The clinical features of 290 patients with scleral inflammation were reviewed to determine whether a classification based on the anatomical site and clinical appearance of the disease at presentation reflected its natural history. The authors' results confirm that the majority of patients remain in the same clinical category throughout the course of their disease. Of the 104 (35.9%) patients who experienced a recurrence of their disease, only 12 had progressed from diffuse to nodular disease, and 10 patients who originally had nodular disease developed scleral necrosis. Patients with necrotizing scleritis were older than patients in the other groups and more frequently had an associated systemic disease than patients with either diffuse or nodular disease; necrotizing scleritis was the most difficult disease to treat. Diffuse anterior scleritis had a lower incidence of visual loss (9%) than either nodular scleritis (26%) or necrotizing disease (74%), and, therefore, the authors consider nodular scleritis a disease of intermediate severity between diffuse scleritis and necrotizing disease. In this series, 12% of patients presented with posterior scleritis, and visual loss was most frequent in this group (84%). 
Antihypertensive drug treatment. Potential, expected, and observed effects on stroke and on coronary heart disease. The effects of prolonged differences in diastolic blood pressure (DBP) on the risks of stroke and of coronary heart disease (CHD) were estimated from nine major prospective observational studies involving about 420,000 men and women who were followed up for intervals of 6-25 years. The results indicate that a prolonged difference of about 6 mm Hg in DBP was associated with approximately 37% fewer strokes and 23% fewer CHD deaths and nonfatal myocardial infarctions. The effects of equivalent reductions in DBP produced by antihypertensive drug treatment but maintained for only a few years have been estimated in several overviews of randomized trials involving a total of 30,000-40,000 patients. The results of the overviews indicate that treatment reduced the risk of stroke by about 40%, suggesting that most or all the long-term potential benefits for stroke due to lower DBP were achieved within about 3 years of beginning treatment. The risks of nonfatal myocardial infarction and CHD death may have been reduced by about 10% among patients allocated to active treatment; the 95% confidence limits for the difference ranged from about zero to about 20%. Whatever the true effect of treatment on CHD, it would appear somewhat less than the difference in risk estimated from the observational studies for a prolonged difference in DBP of the same size. This apparent shortfall in benefit may reflect a long time-course for changes in DBP to have their full effects on CHD, possible adverse side effects of the principal trial treatments, or both. 
Effect of ventilation with soluble and diffusible gases on the size of air emboli. Pulmonary hypertension resulting from venous air embolism is known to increase after ventilation with highly soluble and diffusible gases. Exacerbation of the hypertension could be due to further blockage of the circulation if the bubbles enlarge as a result of ingress of gas by diffusion. This mechanism has been frequently cited but lacks direct proof. To determine directly whether intravascular air bubbles actually enlarge when highly soluble and diffusible gases are inspired, we used microscopy to measure the size of gas emboli in vivo. When air bubbles were injected into the right atrium, the bubbles that appeared in pulmonary arterioles were larger during ventilation with helium or nitrous oxide than with air. Air bubbles injected into the pulmonary artery enlarged when the inspired gas was changed to helium or nitrous oxide. The direction, magnitude, and timing of changes in bubble size were consistent with a net diffusion of gas into the bubbles. These data support the idea that venous air emboli enlarge during ventilation with soluble and diffusible gases and thereby cause further vascular obstruction. 
Platelet activation in the pathogenesis of unstable angina: importance in determining the response to plasminogen activators. Unstable angina is a clinical syndrome of recurrent myocardial ischemia. In some cases, this reflects episodic platelet activation and coronary thrombosis. Thus, the biosynthesis of thromboxane A2, which is largely derived from activated platelets, is increased, often coincident with chest pain. The major role of platelets in unstable angina may influence the response to plasminogen activators. Platelets increase the resistance of thrombi to lysis, by inducing clot retraction and cross-linking and by releasing inhibitors. Thus, coronary thrombi in unstable angina may be resistant to lysis. Furthermore, both t-PA and streptokinase cause platelet activation and thrombin formation in vivo, possibly via plasmin. Plasmin can activate platelets and factor V directly. These prothrombotic effects of plasminogen activators may limit their activity in unstable angina. At the very least, their therapeutic efficacy may be highly dependent on the coadministration of potent antiplatelet agents and anticoagulants. 
Viral hepatitis. The new ABC's. Hepatitis may be caused by hepatitis A virus, hepatitis B virus, hepatitis C virus (classic non-A non-B viral hepatitis), hepatitis D virus (delta agent), and hepatitis E virus (epidemic non-A non-B viral hepatitis). Cytomegalovirus, Epstein-Barr virus, and herpes simplex virus may also occasionally cause hepatitis. Some forms of hepatitis carry the risks of chronic infection, cirrhosis, or hepatocellular carcinoma. Treatment options for viral hepatitis are limited and, in many cases, still under investigation. Prophylaxis is available for many forms of hepatitis and should be offered to those at risk. 
Reversal of protein-bound vitamin B12 malabsorption with antibiotics in atrophic gastritis. The role of bacteria in the bioavailability of protein-bound vitamin B12 was examined in eight elderly subjects who had atrophic gastritis and in eight normal controls. On separate days and in random order, vitamin B12 absorption tests were performed using either radiolabeled crystalline or protein-bound vitamin B12. At the same time, bacterial samples were collected from the upper gastrointestinal tract. The tests and gastrointestinal aspirates were performed before and during tetracycline therapy. Crystalline vitamin B12 was absorbed to the same extent in the two study groups. Atrophic gastritis subjects absorbed significantly less protein-bound vitamin B12 than normal controls (mean +/- SEM, 0.7% +/- 0.2% vs. 1.9% +/- 0.5%, respectively). However, protein-bound vitamin B12 absorption in these subjects normalized after antibiotic therapy. These results suggest that the small amounts of vitamin B12 released from the protein binders is readily absorbed (as shown in vitro) and/or metabolized by bacteria. 
Telangiectatic osteosarcoma. Telangiectatic osteosarcoma is a rare variant of osteosarcoma. In the original report from the authors' institution, a poor prognosis was noted. The authors have updated their experience with this entity. The prognosis for patients with telangiectatic osteosarcoma has improved remarkably. The prognosis in the present series seems to be the same as that for conventional osteosarcoma. Adjuvant chemotherapy seems to help in salvaging patients with metastatic disease. However, in this small series, survival of patients without metastasis is apparently not influenced by whether they received chemotherapy. 
Large vessel occlusion with vasculitis in systemic lupus erythematosus. Patients with SLE may have acute large vessel occlusion due to vasculitis and/or circulating antiphospholipid antibodies, as illustrated by the case we have reported. Unfortunately, delayed medical attention led to gangrene of the foot and amputation. Early recognition and appropriate treatment may significantly decrease morbidity and mortality. Medical treatment may include corticosteroids, thrombolysis, anticoagulation, or immunosuppression. 
Angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors. Present and future. The angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE)-inhibiting agents have emerged with the diuretic agents, beta-adrenergic receptor-blocking agents, and calcium antagonists as therapeutic options for major consideration during the initial treatment of hypertensive patients. These compounds antagonize a potent pressor mechanism underlying hypertensive disease. The ACE inhibitors curtail the generation of the potent octapeptide angiotensin II; in addition, degradation of the potent vasodilator bradykinin is inhibited. Hemodynamically, ACE inhibitors reduce arterial pressure through a decreased total peripheral resistance that is unassociated with reflex stimulation of the heart or expansion of intravascular volume. The arteriolar dilation accounting for the decreased vascular resistance seems to occur in each target organ of the disease. Unlike the direct-acting smooth muscle vasodilators or adrenergic inhibitors, ACE inhibitors dilate the efferent as well as the afferent glomerular arterioles and thereby reduce glomerular hydrostatic pressure and renal filtration fraction, even though renal blood flow and glomerular filtration rate are preserved. The ACE-inhibiting compounds not only reduce left ventricular afterload in hypertension but also diminish cardiac mass and wall thicknesses. The mechanism(s) for some of these actions have not yet been defined precisely, but they undoubtedly involve the autocrine/paracrine actions of the renopressor system and their effects in the cellular biologic events of vascular smooth muscle and the cardiac myocyte. It seems plausible and exciting that the "more local" renin-angiotensin systems will be exploited by those ACE inhibitors yet to be synthesized, which will result in new applications for this class of pharmacological agents. 
Use of Valsalva maneuver to unmask left ventricular diastolic function abnormalities by Doppler echocardiography in patients with coronary artery disease or systemic hypertension. It has been suggested that changes in left atrial pressure may mask or mimic left ventricular diastolic function abnormalities detected by Doppler echocardiography. The effect of the Valsalva maneuver on the transmitral flow velocity profile was therefore studied in 28 patients without evidence of coronary artery disease (group 1, mean age +/- standard deviation 50 +/- 8 years) and in 94 patients with evidence of coronary artery disease or systemic hypertension (group 2, mean age 54 +/- 10 years). At baseline, group 2 patients had higher peak late diastolic filling velocity (A), lower peak early (E) to late diastolic filling velocity (E/A) ratio and longer isovolumic relaxation time than group 1, whereas heart rate, E velocity and E deceleration time were similar in both groups. During Valsalva, both groups had similar increases in heart rate and similar decreases in E velocity but E/A ratio decreased significantly only in group 2 because of a lesser decrease in A velocity. The E/A ratio was greater than or equal to 1.0 both before and during Valsalva in all but 1 patient in group 1, whereas in group 2, 32 patients had E/A greater than or equal to 1.0 at rest and during Valsalva, 33 patients had E/A greater than or equal to 1.0 at rest but less than 1.0 both at rest and during Valsalva. Using group 1 as controls, prevalence, specificity and positive predictive value of E/A less than 1.0 in group 2 were 31, 100 and 100% at rest and 66, 96 and 98% during Valsalva. 
Membrane cerebral lipids in Rett syndrome. The lipid membrane composition of cerebral tissue from 5 patients with classic Rett syndrome, ages 12-30 years, and from 14 age-matched controls was studied. The results demonstrated a selective loss of myelin-associated lipids and an enrichment of gangliosides in temporal white matter. The ganglioside pattern revealed an increase of astroglial cell-associated gangliosides and reduced proportions of gangliosides GD1a and GT1b. This latter finding may be crucial in synaptic function. The fatty acid compositions of ethanolamine phosphoglyceride, choline phosphoglyceride, and galactosylceramide were normal. 
Effect of respiratory muscle fatigue on subsequent exercise performance. The purpose of this study was to determine whether induction of inspiratory muscle fatigue might impair subsequent exercise performance. Ten healthy subjects cycled to volitional exhaustion at 90% of their maximal capacity. Oxygen consumption, breathing pattern, and a visual analogue scale for respiratory effort were measured. Exercise was performed on three separate occasions, once immediately after induction of fatigue, whereas the other two episodes served as controls. Fatigue was achieved by having the subjects breathe against an inspiratory threshold load while generating 80% of their predetermined maximal mouth pressure until they could no longer reach the target pressure. After induction of fatigue, exercise time was reduced compared with control, 238 +/- 69 vs. 311 +/- 96 (SD) s (P less than 0.001). During the last minute of exercise, oxygen consumption and heart rate were lower after induction of fatigue than during control, 2,234 +/- 472 vs. 2,533 +/- 548 ml/min (P less than 0.002) and 167 +/- 15 vs. 177 +/- 12 beats/min (P less than 0.002). At exercise isotime, minutes ventilation and the visual analogue scale for respiratory effort were larger after induction of fatigue than during control. In addition, at exercise isotime, relative tachypnea was observed after induction of fatigue. We conclude that induction of inspiratory muscle fatigue can impair subsequent performance of high-intensity exercise and alter the pattern of breathing during such exercise. 
Effect of temporary occlusion of hypogastric arteries on blood loss during radical retropubic prostatectomy. We report on a prospective, partially randomized study of 130 patients, examining the effect of temporary occlusion of the hypogastric arteries on intraoperative blood loss, perioperative blood replacement and change in preoperative to postoperative hematocrit. We observed no significant difference in any of these parameters when comparing patients who did and did not undergo intraoperative occlusion of the hypogastric arteries. These findings suggest that temporary occlusion of the hypogastric arteries during radical prostatectomy does not have a major effect on the blood loss associated with this operation. Extensive collateral circulation to the prostate and a substantial venous component of blood loss may explain these findings. Banking of 3 units of autologous blood preoperatively would have decreased the need for homologous transfusions in the majority of patients. 
Cross-resistance patterns in ACNU-resistant glioma sublines in culture. Three ACNU-resistant clones (R1, R3, and R12) were isolated from 9L rat glioma cells under selection pressure of ACNU in vitro. The authors have investigated the mechanisms of resistance and characteristics of these clones at the cellular level by studying cross-resistance patterns to chemical and physical agents. Although these resistant sublines showed complete cross-resistance to methyl-chloroethylnitrosourea (MCNU), no cross-resistance was observed for other alkylating agents, while each of the resistant sublines showed partial cross-resistance to structurally dissimilar toxic agents (vinblastine, Adriamycin, and VP-16). No difference in ACNU uptake was observed between 9L and R3 cells, and resistance patterns among alkylating agents suggested that the mechanism of ACNU resistance was specific to bifunctional nitrosoureas. Based on a transport study, this multidrug resistance could be explained by reduced intracellular uptake of these drugs, but there seemed little possibility that membrane P-glycoprotein, which usually is observed in typical multidrug-resistant cells, was expressed in these ACNU-resistant cells because enhanced drug efflux was not found in ACNU-resistant sublines. Significant collateral sensitivity to L-asparaginase indicated that ACNU might disturb the asparagine synthetic pathways by its mutagenic action. The increased level of total glutathione in the resistant sublines may be one mechanism of radiation or ACNU resistance. 
Cervicofacial cystic hygroma. Patterns of recurrence and management of the difficult case. Cystic hygromas usually present in infancy or early childhood as compressible masses that may rapidly and intermittently enlarge. While they may arise in any anatomic location, hygromas of the head and neck are especially difficult to manage since enlargement may cause serious sequela such as airway obstruction, feeding difficulties, and speech pathology. Complete extirpation of these lesions is often impossible, and recurrence rates are accordingly high. We reviewed our 10-year experience in treating cervicofacial cystic hygromas. Of 34 patients, 21 had lesions cephalad to the hyoid and 13 had lesions caudal to the hyoid. While none of the 13 children with infrahyoid lesions demonstrated feeding or respiratory difficulties, eight of 21 children with suprahyoid involvement presented with dysphagia or airway compromise. The recurrence rates for infrahyoid and suprahyoid lesions were 15% and 81%, respectively. Those children with suprahyoid hygromas also experienced an increased operative complication rate compared with patients with infrahyoid involvement. Principles of management for suprahyoid and infrahyoid lesions are described, including the specific management of lingual, submandibular, parotid, and parotofacial hygromas. 
Can essential hypertension be subclassified with respect to mechanism? Hypertension may result from a variety of abnormalities. The rise in blood pressure may trigger other secondary events that further influence cardiovascular homeostasis. The ability to measure some markers associated with hypertension or the responsiveness of blood pressure to nutritional interventions or to specific therapeutic agents may also have pathogenetic implications. The ultimate goal of further knowledge in this area should be to understand the fundamental abnormalities responsible for hypertension. Such insight would permit more effective treatment and, perhaps, primary prevention of this ubiquitous and multifaceted disorder. 
Effectiveness of imazodan for treatment of chronic congestive heart failure. The Imazodan Research Group. A 12-week, multicenter, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial of imazodan, a type III phosphodiesterase inhibitor, was conducted in 147 patients with congestive heart failure to determine clinical efficacy and safety. Patients were randomized to placebo or 2, 5 or 10 mg of imazodan administered twice daily. Patients were maintained on their standard therapy including diuretics, digoxin and an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor. The mean ejection fraction was 23 +/- 10%. Exercise time increased from baseline in all 4 groups. There was no significant difference observed between the placebo group and any of the treated groups with regard to exercise time, ejection fraction, frequency of ventricular premature complexes or ventricular tachycardia. When analyzed by intent to treat, the placebo mortality was 7% (3 of 44) and the imazodan mortality was 8% (8 of 103) (p = not significant). This study failed to demonstrate that imazodan provided any benefit in exercise performance when compared with placebo. 
The anal continence plug: a disposable device for patients with anorectal incontinence. Anorectal incontinence is most commonly found in the elderly, but colorectal surgeons now see an increasing number of younger patients with this condition. Although medical and surgical treatments are available, a proportion of patients remain refractory to therapy. We investigated the efficacy of three designs of anal continence plug. 8 women and 2 men (mean age, 52 years) who were incontinent to both liquid and solid stool tested each plug for three consecutive weeks. 1 patients withdrew from the study. The median weartime for the optimum plug design was 12 h, and there were no episodes of incontinence in 82% of the periods during which the plug was in place. Patients required a median of eleven plugs per week, and in 82% of cases insertion was as easy as with a suppository. Plugs may have a place in the management of patients with anorectal incontinence. 
A review of californium-252 neutron brachytherapy for cervical cancer. Since 1976 a clinical trial has been conducted to test the feasibility, the potential, and to develop methods for using the neutron-emitting radioactive isotope, californium-252 (Cf-252), for the treatment of cervical cancer. A total of 218 patients were treated in the initial study period from 1976 until 1983. The trials initially treated advanced (Stages III and IV) cervical cancer patients using different doses and schedules; they were extended to include unfavorable presentations of Stages I and II because of favorable results in the initial trials. The authors began to treat patients with Stage IB bulky or barrel-shaped tumors and the majority were treated with both radiation and hysterectomy. Actuarial survival was determined for Stage IB disease and was 87% at 5 years and 82% at 10 years. For those tested with preoperative radiation it was 92% at 5 and 87% at 10 years. For Stage II, it was 62% 5 years and 61% at 10. Survival 5 years after combined radiation and surgical therapy for Stage II disease was 68%. For Stage III, it was 33% at 5 years and 25% at 10. However, 5-year survival using the early neutron implant was 46% versus approximately 19% for delayed Cf-252 or cesium 137. Different schedules and sequences of neutrons and photons greatly altered outcome. Neutron treatment before external photon therapy was better for all stages of disease. Only about 5% of all patients developed complications after neutron therapy. No hematologic or mesenchymal second tumors were observed. Neutron brachytherapy was found to be very effective for producing rapid response and greatly improved local control of bulky, barrel, or advanced cervical cancers. The clinical trial identified and evolved schedules, doses, doses per session, and developed methods different from standard photon therapy but highly effective for local control and cure of cervical cancers of all stages. Clinical and radiobiologic understanding for the use of neutron therapy was greatly advanced by this trial. Future trials will focus on patients with advanced disease and will require evaluation of adjuvant chemotherapy studies and neutron-enhancing chemicals. 
Comparison of polyamide and polypropylene membranes for plasma separation. Plasma separation experiments were made with polyamide experimental prototype hollow-fiber plasma filters with surface areas between 0.025 m2 and 0.1090 m2 using bovine blood collected in acid citrate dextrose (ACD). The maximum filtration velocity rose with the wall shear rate gamma w as gamma w 0.72 +/- 0.02 and decreased with the length of fiber L as L-0.41 with a correlation coefficient of 0.97 +/- 0.02. The results were similar to those with polypropylene fibers. We also investigated the occurrence of hemolysis as a function of shear rate and transmembrane pressure. The free hemoglobin concentration of filtered plasma was checked using a U.V. spectrophotometer. It was concluded that polyamide membrane filters can be safely used for plasma separation from blood. 
The relationship of chemotherapeutic and endocrine intervention on natural killer cell activity in human breast cancer. Peripheral blood natural killer (NK) activity against K562 target tumor cells was monitored in patients with breast cancer receiving no treatment, combination chemotherapy, and/or endocrine therapy. NK activity in untreated Stage I patients with no evidence of disease (ned) was significantly higher than in healthy controls. NK activity was shown to decline in individuals with cytotoxic drug therapy (P equals 0.036). There also were reduction in lymphocyte recoveries concomitant with chemotherapeutic intervention (P less than 0.001). Lymphocyte counts were incorporated in a calculation of absolute NK activity that more accurately reflected the significant reduction in NK activity that occurred in patients with localized and systemic disease on chemotherapy. Different chemotherapeutic agents were found to selectively affect NK activity. Stage II patients on phenylalanine mustard (P)/5-fluorouracil (F) (PF) and cyclophosphamide (C)/methotrexate (M)/5-fluorouracil (F) (CMF) protocols showed significant reductions in overall NK activity relative to healthy controls and Stage I patients with ned. Patients on P/doxorubicin (A)/F/tamoxifen (Tx) (PAFT) protocols showed reduced NK activity relative to Stage I patients. Patients on the short-dose C/A (CA) protocol showed normal levels of overall NK activity. High-risk Stage I patients on methotrexate (M)/F (MF)with sequential leucovorin rescue and patients with metastatic disease on endocrine therapy, i.e., Tx or megestrol acetate (Meg) showed overall NK activities in the range of healthy controls. Patients with systemic disease on CMF, CMF/vincristine/prednisone (CMFVP), vinblastine/A/thiotepa/fluoxymesterone (VATH), mitomycin/mitoxantrone (MtMx), and A regimens showed overall levels of absolute NK that were significantly less than either healthy controls or metastatic patients undergoing endocrine therapy. NK cytolytic data, monitored at multiple effector to target ratios, were subjected to exponential regression analysis. The elevation of NK cell responses in Stage I patients with ned and the decline of NK cell responses with cytotoxic chemotherapy were due to alterations in the maximal plateau levels of NK cell cytotoxicity represented by the A (asymptote) values. The k values obtained on regression analysis and indices of the relative killing capacities of individual NK cells remained unaltered in all populations. These results suggest that the cytolytic lymphocyte NK pool, elevated in Stage I patients with cancer, selectively declines as a result of cytotoxic therapy. 
The atrial natriuretic factor hormonal system in the regulation of sodium excretion in dogs with experimental heart failure. In response to a meat meal containing 125 mEq of sodium, conscious dogs (n = 5) with an arteriovenous (AV) fistula and chronic compensated heart failure exhibited temporally related increases in postprandial plasma immunoreactive atrial natriuretic factor (iANF), right atrial pressure, and sodium excretion. In separate experiments, two weeks of dietary sodium restriction produced similar marked stimulation of renin and aldosterone both in normal dogs (n = 5), and in AV fistula dogs (n = 5) with chronic high circulating levels of ANF. Plasma iANF did not change (P greater than .05) in either group. These results suggest that the ANF system is involved in the postprandial regulation of sodium excretion in the AV fistula dogs with compensated heart failure. In the postabsorptive state, however, the activity of the renin-aldosterone axis is closely related to dietary sodium intake and appears to function independently of the ANF system for the prevention of sodium loss. 
Malignant blue nevus. To elucidate the histologic features and biologic behavior of malignant blue nevus (MBN), 12 cases were analyzed in which the tumor showed no junctional activity and arose in a blue nevus background. Seven patients were men and five were women; their mean age was 48.8 years. Eight lesions were on the scalp, and no patient had a family history of melanoma. The histologic appearance of most lesions was a nodule or nodules of malignant cells in a blue nevus. Mitoses were present in all lesions with atypical forms in eight; however the mitotic rate exceeded two per ten high-power fields in only one lesion. Four lesions had necrosis, and four had a heavily pigmented malignant component. Four patients had recurrences; ten patients had metastases, and eight died of their disease. Therefore MBN is an aggressive neoplasm. 
Pheochromocytoma with pyrexia and marked inflammatory signs: a paraneoplastic syndrome with possible relation to interleukin-6 production. Pheochromocytoma can cause several paraneoplastic syndromes. We report a patient with pheochromocytoma who exhibited pyrexia and marked inflammatory signs along with an elevated serum interleukin-6 (IL-6) level. All of these abnormalities disappeared and serum IL-6 became undetectable by removal of the tumor. In addition, immunohistochemical analysis revealed the presence of IL-6 in the tumor cells. It is suggested that pyrexia and the elevation of acute phase proteins can be a paraneoplastic syndrome with pheochromocytoma, and that the elaboration of IL-6 from pheochromocytoma may play an important role in the development of the syndrome. 
Steps towards cost-benefit analysis of regional neurosurgical care OBJECTIVE--To determine the cost of averting death or severe disability by neurosurgical intervention. DESIGN--Retrospective analysis of one year's admissions for neurosurgery; comparison of outcome with expected outcome in the absence of neurosurgical intervention and with the cost of neurosurgery. SETTING--Wessex Neurological Centre. PATIENTS--1026 Patients were admitted to the neurosurgical service in 1984. Of 1185 admissions, 978 case records were available and outcome was known in 919. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES--Outcome was assessed with the Glasgow outcome scale, modified as necessary, from the case notes, or by letter follow up to the general practitioner. Expected outcomes for each of the 54 diagnoses were derived from both published reports where available and an expert panel of 18 consultant neurosurgeons. The cost of the neurosurgical service for 1983-4 was known from a separate study and the cost per patient was calculated using the length of stay. RESULTS--The cost of neurosurgery in 1983-4 was 1.8 million pounds. In all, 243 deaths or severe disabilities were estimated to have been averted at an average cost of 7325 pounds (range 5000 pounds to 70,000 pounds). The overall cost per quality adjusted life year (QALY) was 350 pounds (range 34 pounds to greater than 400,000 pounds). The cost of long term care for severely disabled survivors is at least 18-fold greater than the cost of neurosurgical intervention to avert such disability. CONCLUSIONS--In Britain neurosurgery is not expensive in comparison with the costs and benefits of other areas of medicine, and the cost per QALY is unexpectedly low except for severe diffuse head injury, malignant brain tumors, and cerebral metastases. The neurosurgical budget should be assessed in the context of managing a patient in hospital and subsequently in the community. 
HLA class I antigen expression as a measure of response to antiviral therapy of chronic hepatitis B. HLA class I antigen expression on peripheral blood mononuclear cells was evaluated by flow cytometry in 21 HBeAg-positive patients with chronic hepatitis B. Measurements were made before, during or after treatment with recombinant interferon-alpha-2b, either given alone or after a 6 wk course of prednisone. Immunohistochemical staining for human leukocyte class I antigen was also evaluated in 28 percutaneous liver biopsy specimens either obtained before or after therapy (N = 27) and during therapy in one instance. The amount of HLA class I antigen on peripheral blood mononuclear cells varied markedly among individual patients, but the overall results indicated that the level of inducible antigen did not correlate with increments of ALT during therapy or with a virological response to therapy. Hepatocyte staining for HLA class I antigen was observed in a minority of biopsy specimens (29%) and also did not appear to predict a response or correlate with the severity of histological disease. These data do not support current theories concerning pathogenetic mechanisms in chronic hepatitis B nor do they suggest that spontaneous display of HLA class I antigen on hepatocytes or interferon-induced expression of these antigens on peripheral blood mononuclear cells is a critical determinant for a response to therapy. 
Malaria in an urban emergency department: epidemiology and diagnostic features of 25 cases. This article presents a retrospective study of 25 patients diagnosed with malaria in an urban emergency department (ED) between June 1986 and June 1989. The mean annual case rate of malaria in this study group was more than three times the national rate. This may be ascribed to the notable ethnic diversity of the population. A history of travel to an area endemic for malaria was eventually elicited from all patients. The most common chief complaint was fever (56%) followed by abdominal pain (12%). Temperatures were elevated in 70% of the patients, with a mean temperature of 102.9 degrees F (39 degrees C). Gender was found to play a role in delaying diagnosis, with women accounting for 83% of a group of patients requiring multiple ED visits before diagnosis. The authors conclude that malaria must be considered when diagnosing patients in ethnically diverse populations. Gender may be associated with a delay in diagnosis. A careful travel history and a peripheral smear are aids in rapid diagnosis. 
Hepatic interferon-alpha gene transcripts and products in liver specimens from acute and chronic hepatitis B virus infection. In this study we have examined the localization of interferon-alpha in liver tissue from acute and chronic hepatitis B virus carriers to establish whether the defect in interferon-alpha production reported in chronic hepatitis B virus infection is at a pretranscriptional or posttranscriptional level using in situ hybridization and immunohistochemical techniques. Interferon-alpha messenger RNA transcripts and the immunoreactive protein were abundant in liver tissue and in particular in hepatocytes from patients with acute hepatitis B virus infection who subsequently recovered. In contrast interferon-alpha polypeptide was present in a significantly lower number of sinusoidal cells, mononuclear cells and hepatocytes in chronic hepatitis B virus carriers. Although a high proportion of patients with chronic hepatitis B virus infection had cells that expressed interferon-alpha messenger RNA transcripts, the number of such cells was significantly less than in acute hepatitis B virus infection, indicating that the defect in the hepatic interferon-alpha synthesis is at the level of gene activation. Furthermore, using double immunohistochemical staining, the number of hepatocytes containing HBcAg correlated inversely with the proportion of neighboring sinusoidal cells expressing interferon-alpha. These data support previous observations that interferon-alpha production is reduced in chronic hepatitis B virus infection and are consistent with the view that this cytokine is important in the clearance of the virus. 
Death by embolization of prosthetic aortic valve. This report describes a case in which a young woman died from embolization of her prosthetic aortic valve. The discussion includes the embolization's association with chronic intravenous narcotism, recurrent bacterial endocarditis, and acute cocaine toxicity. 
Flunarizine in migraine: a minireview. Flunarizine is a non-selective calcium antagonist. It distributes preferentially in the adipose tissue and passes the blood brain barrier. Numerous controlled clinical studies have established that flunarizine is efficacious in migraine prophylaxis, including double-blind studies in which the drug was compared with placebo or other antimigraine drugs. To avoid side effects a special schedule or administration is necessary. Flunarizine has no myogenic effect on smooth muscle cells of the vessles. It is said to be the only calcium antagonist able to protect brain cells against hypoxic damage. In addition, the considerable body of information which shows flunarizine capable of directly influencing the central nervous system, suggests that the drug's anti-migraine action may depend on its ability to influence central phenomena. 
A single-blind comparison of intravenous ondansetron, a selective serotonin antagonist, with intravenous metoclopramide in the prevention of nausea and vomiting associated with high-dose cisplatin chemotherapy Ondansetron (GR 38032F), a selective antagonist of serotonin subtype 3 receptors, is effective in the prevention of emesis associated with cisplatin as well as other chemotherapeutic agents. In this randomized, single-blind, multicenter, parallel group study, we compared the efficacy and safety of intravenous (IV) ondansetron with IV metoclopramide in the prevention of nausea and vomiting associated with high-dose (greater than or equal to 100 mg/m2) cisplatin chemotherapy. Three hundred seven patients receiving their first dose of cisplatin, either alone or in combination with other antineoplastic agents, were randomized to receive ondansetron 0.15 mg/kg IV every 4 hours for three doses or metoclopramide 2 mg/kg IV every 2 hours for three doses, then every 3 hours for three additional doses. The study prohibited the concurrent administration of other antiemetics or dexamethasone. Patients receiving ondansetron had a higher rate of complete protection from emesis (40% v 30%, P = .07), a higher complete plus major response rate (65% v 51%, P = .016), a lower rate of failure (21% v 36%, P = .007), and a lower median number of emetic episodes (one v two, P = .005) than did those receiving metoclopramide. The median time to the first emetic episode was longer on ondansetron (20.5 v 4.3 hours, P less than .001). Adverse events occurred in 48% of patients receiving ondansetron and 69% of those receiving metoclopramide (P less than .001). Akathisia and acute dystonic reactions occurred only on metoclopramide; headache (controlled with acetaminophen) was significantly more frequent with ondansetron. Ondansetron is more effective, produces fewer adverse events, and is easier to administer than metoclopramide for the prevention of emesis associated with high-dose cisplatin chemotherapy. 
Thrombosis and thrombolysis in unstable angina. Pathophysiology of unstable angina involves spasm, plaque rupture, activation of platelets, and coagulation. The incidence and frequency of intracoronary thrombus formation are presently under active assessment in order to establish the potential benefit of thrombolytic therapy. A preliminary study was conducted in patients admitted in our coronary care unit for unstable angina with typical clinical and electrocardiographic criteria and with early coronary angiogram. After exclusion of 4 patients with left main coronary stenosis or contraindications for thrombolysis, 16 patients received thrombolytic infusion and 14 underwent a second coronary angiogram. Seven patients had an intracoronary thrombus (6 nonocclusive, 1 occlusive) and at the second angiogram only 3 nonocclusive thrombi were modified (1 disappeared, 2 were reduced). Moreover, the quantitative Coronary Angiography Analysis System (CAAS) in the 11 cases suitable for analysis did not show any significant changes, especially in the Ambrose type IIB lesions. In-hospital clinical outcome was not influenced by thrombolytic therapy (5 ischemic recurrences, 1 fatal myocardial infarction, 4 emergency and 4 elective revascularization procedures). This short series is in agreement with the literature data. Only one third of patients with active unstable angina remains refractory to conventional therapy. The transient benefit of thrombolysis is limited to patients with demonstrated intracoronary thrombi. Clinical or angiographic improvement are not always in correlation and until now do not seem able to prevent short-term recurrences or the need for revascularization procedures. 
Hypertension in obesity and NIDDM. Role of insulin and sympathetic nervous system. An important link exists between obesity, noninsulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM), and hypertension. Most patients with NIDDM are obese; the incidence of hypertension in obesity and NIDDM is substantial, approaching 50% in some studies. Furthermore, hypertension is known to contribute to the increased cardiovascular morbidity and mortality in patients with obesity and NIDDM. Despite the obvious clinical importance, the pathogenesis of hypertension in obesity and NIDDM remains poorly understood. Recent studies have identified hyperinsulinemia and insulin resistance as important threads that tie hypertension, obesity, and NIDDM together. The hypothesis is developed that insulin-mediated sympathetic stimulation contributes to blood pressure elevation in both obesity and NIDDM. Recruited as a mechanism to limit weight gain and restore energy balance, insulin resistance and sympathetic stimulation increase blood pressure by enhancing renal Na+ reabsorption and stimulating the cardiovascular system. In this article, we review the evidence on which this hypothesis is based. 
Intracranial arteriovenous fistula manifesting as progressive neurological deterioration in an infant: case report. This 1-year-old male infant had been diagnosed with cerebral degenerative disease because he developed psychomotor regression, and brain atrophy was demonstrated on computed tomography. He underwent magnetic resonance imaging, which suggested a cerebrovascular malformation. Cerebral angiography disclosed an arteriovenous fistula, fed by an anterior cerebral artery and directly draining into a cortical vein. The occlusion of the feeding artery was followed by a satisfactory recovery. The mechanism of the neurological symptoms in this patient is thought to be caused by a steal phenomenon and compression of the brain stem by venous engorgement in the posterior fossa. 
Low power laser biostimulation of chronic oro-facial pain. A double-blind placebo controlled cross-over study in 40 patients. The efficacy of low power laser stimulation in the treatment of chronic oro-facial pain conditions was investigated in a double-blind placebo controlled modified cross-over study in 40 patients. The laser was an invisible infrared (IR) diode laser with an emission at 904 nanometer (nm). Treatment effect was evaluated by means of VAS-scales and global assessment of pain. Outcome of treatment was correlated to changes in urinary excretion of 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid (5-HIAA). The clinical impression was that placebo was superior to laser stimulation. No statistically significant difference between the analgesic effect of the laser and placebo irradiation was found on VAS-scales. A significant (P = 0.05) increase in 5-HIAA excretion was found in the placebo group. It is concluded that the possibility of a substantial placebo response should be taken into consideration using 904 nm (IR) lasers for pain treatment in patients with this type of chronic oro-facial pain. 
Colonic epithelial dysplasia or carcinoma in a regional group of patients with ulcerative colitis of more than 15 years duration. Colonoscopic screening for neoplasia was performed in a regional group of ulcerative colitis patients with a disease duration of greater than or equal to 15 years. A total of 121 patients, aged less than 80 years, were invited to participate, of whom 100 (83%) accepted colonoscopy, including biopsies in 15 standard locations of the entire colon, plus additional biopsies from all visible lesions. Unequivocal dysplasia was found in one patient with extensive colitis and a disease duration of 31 years. A polyp with highly differentiated adenocarcinoma was found in the sigmoid colon of a patient with intermittent rectum involvement, 37 years after the ulcerative colitis diagnosis had been made. Biopsy specimens from the remaining 98 patients showed no signs of dysplasia or cancer. Thus the frequency of pre-malignant or malignant changes is very low compared with the results of similar studies, and the rationale for general colonoscopic surveillance programmes for such patients is open to question. 
Important melanocytic lesions in childhood and adolescence. Melanocytic nevi are common in children and adolescents, and the preponderance of these lesions are benign. Congenital melanocytic nevi, dysplastic nevi, and large numbers of common acquired nevi, however, may indicate an increased risk of malignant melanoma. With the exception, possibly, of giant congenital nevi, melanoma associated with these lesions generally occurs in adulthood. Nonetheless, some patients can be identified as being at increased risk for the development of melanoma during childhood. The poor prognosis associated with advanced melanoma and the curability of early lesions underscore the importance of prompt recognition of melanoma when it does occur in children. Furthermore, physicians who care for children are in a key position to decrease risk of melanoma throughout the lifespan by encouraging avoidance of excessive sun exposure during childhood. 
Subcutaneous metoclopramide in the treatment of symptomatic gastroparesis: clinical efficacy and pharmacokinetics. We investigated the safety and efficacy of short-term s.c. administration of metoclopramide in the treatment of symptomatic gastric stasis. Ten patients with gastroparesis, documented by abnormal solid phase radionuclide gastric emptying study, were treated with 10 mg (2 ml) of s.c. metoclopramide every 6 hr for 3 days. Patients gave themselves the injections as outpatients. Questionnaires were then completed concerning symptom relief, local side effects and adverse reactions. A repeat gastric emptying study was obtained immediately after the last dose of metoclopramide. Serum metoclopramide concentrations were obtained at trough, 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5 hr postadministration and serum prolactin levels at trough, 1 and 3 hr. Pharmacokinetic analysis showed mean peak metoclopramide concentration at 30 min of 99.7 +/- 47.1 ng/ml with measured levels of 93.9 +/- 106.83 ng/ml at 60 min and return to trough values by 4 hr; trough prolactins remained elevated above normal values. Gastric stasis improved from a base-line retention of 78.7% of radioisotope at 2 hr to 72.5% after 3 days of therapy (P = .65). Eight patients reported significant improvement in symptomology and two patients reported lessening of symptoms such as nausea, vomiting, bloating, abdominal pain, heartburn and vomiting. The side effects were minimal and did not interfere with completion of the protocol. We demonstrated that s.c. administration of metoclopramide was well accepted by patients and resulted in subjective and objective improvement of gastric stasis. In addition, serum metoclopramide concentrations were comparable with other parenteral routes of administration. Furthermore, serum prolactin levels may provide both a bioassay of efficacy and a marker for monitoring compliance. 
Differential enhancement of interferon-gamma-induced MHC class II expression of HEp-2 cells by 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3. Interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) induces the expression of MHC class II antigens on non-lymphoid cells. In this study we investigated the effect of 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 (1,25(OH)2D3), the most active metabolite of vitamin D3, on the IFN-gamma-induced expression of MHC class II antigens on HEp-2 cells. We found that 1,25(OH)2D3 enhanced the IFN-gamma-induced expression of HLA-DR on these cells. Differential effects on the MHC class II antigens HLA-DR, -DQ and -DP were also observed. 
Reoperations for late complications following abdominal aortic operation. Fifty patients were identified who, following abdominal aortic operation, developed late complications affecting the vascular graft or endarterectomy and who underwent their first reoperation between 1979 and 1989. Thrombosis was the commonest complication affecting 28 (56 per cent) patients, followed by false aneurysm in 11 (22 per cent), enteric fistula in nine (18 per cent) and graft infection in two (4 per cent). The 30-day mortality rate for reoperation was 8 per cent; longer follow-up revealed mortality rates of 22, 50 and 63 per cent at 1, 3 and 5 years respectively. Thirty-four complications required reoperation within 5 years of the original surgery. Reoperation was needed for 35 patients whose original pathology was occlusive disease and for 15 whose original pathology was aneurysm. The nature of the complication was related to initial pathology; thrombosis was far commoner in those with occlusive disease, and enteric fistula and false aneurysm were commoner in those with aneurysmal disease. 
Serial antiarrhythmic drug treatment to maintain sinus rhythm after electrical cardioversion for chronic atrial fibrillation or atrial flutter. The sequential use of different types of antiarrhythmic drugs may improve arrhythmia prognosis in chronic atrial fibrillation or flutter after successful electrical cardioversion. The rationale for serial treatment is that the arrhythmogenic mechanism may vary between patients, leading to different responses to 1 specific drug. To investigate this issue prospectively, 127 patients having chronic fibrillation or flutter exclusively, underwent serial drug treatment with flecainide (stage I) followed by sotalol or, if contraindicated, quinidine (stage II) and eventually amiodarone (stage III). Stages II and III were entered after electrical recardioversion for a recurrence during stages I or II, respectively. Calculated on an actuarial basis, the 2-year cumulative percentage of patients free of the arrhythmia increased from 31% after stage I to 63% at the end of serial treatment. To reach this result, a mean of 1.8 +/- 0.8 cardioversions per patient were needed, with 53 patients progressing to stage II and 34 to stage III. Sixteen patients stopped serial treatment prematurely and 15 patients were considered to have intractable atrial fibrillation at the end of stage III. Incidence of proarrhythmia was low. Multivariate analysis disclosed that an older age, in combination with a large number of previous episodes of arrhythmia, a long previous duration of arrhythmia and presence of mitral valve disease, were predictive for medical refractoriness during serial treatment. It is concluded that serial treatment may improve arrhythmia prognosis in atrial fibrillation or flutter, with an acceptable incidence of proarrhythmic events. 
Correlation between molecular and clinical events in the evolution of chronic myelocytic leukemia to blast crisis. A patient with typical Philadelphia chromosome (Ph1)-positive chronic myelocytic leukemia (CML) was studied during sequential phases of disease: (1) initial chronic phase; (2) myeloid blast crisis; (3) second chronic phase; and (4) accelerated disease. A point mutation in the coding sequence of the p53 gene first appeared concomitantly with the blast crisis and then disappeared with the re-establishment of a second chronic phase. The chromosomal concomitant of the molecular alteration was a deletion of 17p. These observations suggest that abnormalities of the p53 anti-oncogene are temporally related to the clinical progression of some cases of CML and are probably responsible for the development of blast crisis in these cases. 
Correlation of radiologic assessment of lumbar spine fusions with surgical exploration. Although inspection of posterolateral lumbar fusion is the best method of determining its solidity, routine exploration of the fusion is somewhat impractical because of the morbidity and expense involved. Removal of internal fixation devices or implantable batteries or reoperation for failed back surgery enabled the exploration and assessment of lumbar spine fusions in 214 operations on 175 patients. The preoperative radiologic assessment (plain roentgenographs, polytomography, bending films, and computed tomographic scans) were correlated with surgical findings. This study indicated a significant percentage of inaccuracy of all radiologic modalities used. Noncorrelations were present in 36% of plain roentgenographs, 41% of polytomograms, 38% of bending films, and 43% of computed tomographic scans. Radiologic inaccuracy was manifest on both the positive and negative sides. Computed tomographic scanning presented the lowest percentage of inaccuracy (22%) and bending films the highest percentage (27%). Based on these findings, there exists the need for more accurate noninvasive methods to determine the solidity of spine fusions. 
Cervicocranial arterial dissection. Dissection of the cervicocranial arteries is becoming more frequently recognized as a cause of neurological disorders. Typical clinical features seen with dissection include unilateral headache, oculosympathetic palsy, amaurosis fugax, and symptoms of focal brain ischemia. The diagnosis of carotid or intracranial dissection is usually best confirmed by angiography, although magnetic resonance imaging and computed tomography have been shown to visualize intimal dissection. The prognosis in cases of spontaneous dissection is generally benign unless the initial manifestation involves infarction with substantial deficit. The best approach to treatment appears to be the administration of the anticoagulant, heparin, followed by warfarin or antiplatelet therapy. Surgical intervention is reserved for cases of progressive or recurrent ischemic complication that occurs despite the administration of adequate doses of anticoagulants. 
Cholelithiasis after treatment for childhood cancer. The authors evaluated the risk of development of cholelithiasis in 6050 patients treated at a single hospital for various childhood cancers with different therapeutic modalities, including chemotherapy, surgery, radiation therapy, and bone marrow transplantation, from 1963 to 1989. Patients with underlying chronic hemolytic anemia or preexisting gallstones were excluded. Nine female and seven male patients with a median age of 12.4 years (range, 1.2 to 22.8 years) at diagnosis of primary cancer had gallstones develop 3 months to 17.3 years (median, 3.1 years) after therapy was initiated. Cumulative risks of 0.42% at 10 years and 1.03% at 18 years after diagnosis substantially exceed those reported for the general population of this age group. Treatment-related factors significantly associated with an increased risk of cholelithiasis were ileal conduit, parenteral nutrition, abdominal surgery, and abdominal radiation therapy (relative risks and 95% confidence intervals = 61.6 [27.9-135.9], 23.0 [9.8-54.1], 15.1 [7.1-32.2], and 7.4 [3.2-17.0], respectively). There was no correlation with the type of cancer, nor was the frequency of conventional predisposing features (e.g., family history, obesity, use of oral contraceptives, and pregnancy) any higher among the affected patients in this study than in the general population. Patients with cancer who have risk factors identified here should be monitored for the development of gallstones. 
Comparison between anal endosonography and digital examination in the evaluation of anal fistulae. A prospective trial was performed comparing the accuracy of digital examination and anal endosonography in defining the anatomy of anal fistulae. Before operation 38 consecutive patients were assessed by the consultant in charge of the case, by a research fellow and by anal endosonography involving two radiologists. These findings were compared with the operative findings. Consultants correctly identified 26 of 33 internal openings, 29 of 34 primary tracks and 15 of 21 secondary tracks. The research fellow correctly identified 26 internal openings, 24 primary tracks and 10 secondary tracks. There was no significant difference between the accuracy of consultants and the research fellow. Anal endosonography identified 10 internal openings based on initial criteria. This rose to 24 when revised ultrasonographic criteria were applied. There was no statistical difference between consultant assessment and anal ultrasonography in correctly identifying intersphincteric and transphincteric tracks. Ultrasonography is unable to assess primary superficial, suprasphincteric and extrasphincteric tracks or secondary supralevator and infralevator tracks. Consultant assessment of secondary supralevator and infralevator tracks was correct in 78 per cent of cases. 
Towards a less costly but accurate test of gastric emptying and small bowel transit. Our aim is to develop a less costly but accurate test of stomach emptying and small bowel transit by utilizing selected scintigraphic observations 1-6 hr after ingestion of a radiolabeled solid meal. These selected data were compared with more detailed analyses that require multiple scans and labor-intensive technical support. A logistic discriminant analysis was used to estimate the sensitivity and specificity of selected summaries of scintigraphic transit measurements. We studied 14 patients with motility disorders (eight neuropathic and six myopathic, confirmed by standard gastrointestinal manometry) and 37 healthy subjects. The patient group had abnormal gastric emptying (GE) and small bowel transit time (SBTT). The proportion of radiolabel retained in the stomach from 2 to 4 hr (GE 2 hr, GE 3 hr, GE 4 hr), as well as the proportion filling the colon at 4 and 6 hr (CF 4 hr, CF 6 hr) were individually able to differentiate health from disease (P less than 0.05 for each). From the logistic discriminant model, an estimated sensitivity of 93% resulted in similar specificities for detailed and selected transit parameters for gastric emptying (range: 62-70%). Similarly, combining selected observations, such as GE 4 hr with CF 6 hr, had a specificity of 76%, which was similar to the specificity of combinations of more detailed analyses. Based on the present studies and future confirmation in a larger number of patients, including those with less severe motility disorders, the 2-, 4-, and 6-hr scans with quantitation of proportions of counts in stomach and colon should provide a useful, relatively inexpensive strategy to identify and monitor motility disorders in clinical and epidemiologic studies. 
Medulloblastoma: freedom from relapse longer than 8 years--a therapeutic cure? Seventy-seven patients presenting with medulloblastoma between 1958 and 1986 were treated at Stanford University Medical Center and studied retrospectively. Multimodality therapy utilized surgical extirpation followed by megavoltage irradiation. In 15 cases chemotherapy was used as adjunctive treatment. The 10- and 15-year actuarial survival rates were both 41% with an 18-year maximum follow-up period (median 4.75 years). There were no treatment failures after 8 years of tumor-free survival. Gross total removal of tumor was achieved in 22 patients (32%); the surgical mortality rate was 3.9%. No significant difference was noted in the incidence of metastatic disease between shunted and nonshunted patients. The classical form of medulloblastoma was present in 67% of cases while the desmoplastic subtype was found in 16%. Survival rates were best for patients presenting after 1970, for those with desmoplastic tumors, and for patients receiving high-dose irradiation (greater than or equal to 5000 cGy) to the posterior fossa. Although early data on freedom from relapse suggested a possible beneficial effect from chemotherapy, long-term follow-up results showed no advantage from this modality of treatment. The patterns of relapse and survival were examined; 64% of relapses occurred within the central nervous system, and Collins' rule was applicable in 83% of cases beyond the period of risk. Although patients treated for recurrent disease could be palliated, none were long-term survivors. The study data indicate that freedom from relapse beyond 8 years from diagnosis can be considered as a cure in this disease. Long-term follow-up monitoring is essential to determine efficacy of treatment and to assess survival patterns accurately. 
Locally advanced paranasal sinus and nasopharynx tumors treated with hyperfractionated radiation and concomitant infusion cisplatin. Fourteen patients with paranasal sinus complex and nasopharynx tumors were treated at State University of New York Health Science Center at Brooklyn (Brooklyn, NY) with a regimen of split-course hyperfractionated radiation (120 cGy/fraction) and concomitant cisplatin infusion (5 to 7 mg/m2/24 hours). All of the patients had T4 tumors or massively recurrent disease with base of skull or facial bone involvement. Twelve patients were treated with curative intent receiving total doses of 6000 to 6960 cGy (modal 6750 cGy), whereas two patients were treated with less than 5000 cGy as palliation. Eleven of the 12 patients (92%) achieved a complete response, and 7 of 12 (58%) are alive at 35 to 72 months (mean, 47 months). Five patients are alive with no evidence of disease, and two with a local recurrence. Three patients died of distant disease, and two died from a local recurrence. When the response to treatment was analyzed based on tumor volume and radiation dose, only two of nine lesions measuring between 4 to 10 cm failed locally. The two palliative patients had almost complete local clearance of the disease but died at 2 and 8 months, respectively. In nine patients, the eye or optic nerve was included in the treatment field and received between 2000 to 6960 cGy. Only one of these nine patients had ophthalmic complication and this was confined to the cornea. 
Iloprost attenuates the increased permeability in skeletal muscle after ischemia and reperfusion. Increased vascular permeability is an early and sensitive indicator of ischemic muscle injury, occurring before significant histologic or radionuclide changes are evident. We investigated the effect of iloprost, a stable prostacyclin analog, on microvascular permeability in a rat striated muscle model. In six control and six experimental animals the cremaster muscle was dissected, placed in a closed-flow acrylic chamber, and suffused with a bicarbonate buffer solution. Dextran labeled with fluorescein was injected intravenously as a macromolecular tracer, and microvascular permeability was determined on the basis of clearance of the fluorescent tracer. Two hours of ischemia were followed by 2 hours of reperfusion. In the experimental group iloprost (0.5 microgram/kg/min) was given in a continuous intravenous infusion. Microvascular permeability increased significantly during reperfusion in both control and experimental animals (p less than 0.0001). Treatment with iloprost, however, significantly attenuated this response compared to the control group, 4.8 +/- 0.3 versus 7.3 +/- 0.5 microliters/gm/min, respectively (p less than 0.0001). Iloprost decreases the rise in vascular permeability after ischemia and reperfusion. Experimental clinical use of iloprost under controlled conditions in the treatment of patients with acute skeletal muscle ischemia appears justified. 
Exercise training and coronary collateral circulation. This review examines the potential for an exercise-induced increase in coronary collateral circulation, with specific reference to the role and functional significance of collateral vessels, highlighting animal and human studies in particular, and their inherent methodological limitations. Exercise training may enhance myocardial oxygen supply by promoting transient periods of myocardial ischemia, a potent trigger of collateral growth. Some human studies have shown that moderate-to-high intensity training can result in a higher double product at the onset of angina and/or ischemic ST-segment depression, suggesting that myocardial oxygen supply has increased. Attempts to use thallium-201 exercise scintigraphy to assess myocardial perfusion before and after a physical training program have produced conflicting data, whereas angiographic studies in group trials have, without exception, yielded disappointing results. Thus, direct evidence that exercise stimulates collateralization in humans is lacking. 
Detection of human papillomavirus DNA in cancer of the urinary bladder by in situ hybridisation. The association of the human papillomavirus (HPV) with cancer of the urinary bladder was assessed by in situ hybridisation using probes selective for HPV types 6/11 and 16/18 DNA. No hybridisation signal was detected with the type 6/11 probe on 100 formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded bladder tumours sampled. However, when the same samples were hybridised with the HPV type 16/18 DNA probe, 11 of 66 (16.6%) papillary and 1 of 10 (10%) solid transitional cell carcinomas gave positive signals. These results suggest the involvement of HPV in cancer of the bladder, although the frequency of multiple HPV types in these tumours is uncertain. 
Erythroleukemia in a child associated with monosomy 7. A case of erythroleukemia (EL) associated with monosomy 7 is reported. The EL was diagnosed 20 months after the initial diagnosis of monosomy 7 was made. An immunologic study of the blast cells using a monoclonal antibody was positive for glycophorin A, which suggested that they were of erythroid origin; this was confirmed by electron microscopy. Chemotherapy was started with low dose cytarabine. However, the patient had severe bone marrow suppression and died of pneumonia. Our case shows that monosomy 7 is an abnormality of the pluripotential stem cells, including erythroid cells, that resulted in a true erythroid neoplasm. 
Hypertension associated with increased renin concentrations in nephroblastoma. An infant with severe hypertension who had a nephroblastoma which was secreting active renin is described. Nephroblastoma must be included in the differential diagnosis of hypertension associated with increased renin concentrations, even in the absence of an abdominal mass. 
Differential hemodynamic effects and tolerance properties of nitroglycerin and an S-nitrosothiol in experimental heart failure. S-nitrosothiols are potent in vitro vasodilators, but little is known about their in vivo action. In this study, we compared the effects of S-nitroso N-acetyl penicillamine (SNAP) and nitroglycerin (NTG) on left ventricular (LV) hemodynamics in congestive heart failure rats. By using a twoday crossover design, stepwise i.v. infusions of SNAP or NTG at 3, 5 and 8 micrograms/min were administered for 30 min each, followed by a dose of 10 micrograms/min over the next 10 h. LV end-diastolic and peak-systolic pressures (LVEDP and LVPSP, respectively) were measured at selected intervals. SNAP and NTG produced maximal LVEDP reductions of 46 and 44%, respectively, at the highest infusion rate. However, at the lower doses, greater reductions of LVEDP were seen with SNAP. NTG had a smaller effect on LVPSP (maximum 6% reduction) than SNAP (maximum reduction of 15%). During the 10-h infusion of NTG, LVEDP gradually returned to base-line values, indicating the development of tolerance, despite relatively constant plasma levels of NTG over the infusion period. Tolerance in LVEDP effects was not observed during the 10-h infusion of SNAP. In the presence of NTG tolerance, rats were still responsive to SNAP (mean reduction of LVEDP 24%), suggesting the absence of cross-tolerance between these two nitrovasodilators. These results suggest that SNAP is a more potent in vivo vasodilator than NTG, has more arterial action than NTG and is less prone to produce LV hemodynamic tolerance. 
Pattern of arterial involvement of the head, neck, and eyes in giant cell arteritis: three case reports. The findings of two post-mortem examinations and one CT scan of patients with biopsy proved giant cell arteritis (GCA) are presented. The presence or absence of intracranial involvement in GCA is discussed. 
Coronary artery aneurysms--a case study and literature review. Coronary artery aneurysms are detected with increasing frequency owing to the advent of coronary angiographies. Although most patients with coronary artery aneurysms are asymptomatic, manifestations of myocardial ischemia may occur. The case described herein serves as a basis for a discussion of the pathogenesis, clinical manifestations, detection, and treatment of coronary artery aneurysms. 
Hypercalcemia of advanced malignancy: decision making and the quality of death. Hypercalcemia is a common complication of certain advanced malignancies and although not therapeutically difficult, its presence raises complex ethical issues. Treatment of this condition is most easily justified when the patient is not terminal, the benefits are tangible, and the patient agrees with therapy. Withholding treatment is defensible medically, legally, and morally when a terminal situation is present, when drawbacks exceed the benefits, and when an informed patient declines therapy. Hypercalcemia is one of a number of conditions of dying that can be controlled by the physician. The physician's decision to treat such a condition, in part, depends upon his or her view of a good death. Further study is needed to clarify and avoid those situations of dying which involve suffering. Physicians must begin this difficult analysis and dialogue if they are to fulfill their obligation to minimize suffering in all patients. 
Persistent neurotoxicity of systemically administered interferon-alpha. Fourteen cancer patients had evidence of persistent neurotoxicity of interferon-alpha therapy long after their treatment was discontinued. Although most of the cognitive symptoms were mild to moderate in severity, they were incapacitating to these individuals in their usual work. The neuropsychological test abnormalities were not attributable to subsequent therapy, disease status, or other medical problems. The pattern of deficits was consistent with frontal-subcortical dysfunction. Of the four patients who had follow-up assessment, two had improved and two had deteriorated. These findings suggest that in some cases interferon neurotoxicity is not reversible. 
'Medial maxillectomy' for lateral nasal wall neoplasms. Lateral rhinotomy and "medial maxillectomy," an en bloc resection of the medial maxillary sinus, ethmoid sinus with the lamina papyracea, medial orbital floor, and lacrimal fossa-duct, have been advocated for lateral nasal wall neoplasma. Experience with 35 (of 41) patients followed up at least 30 months (median, 57 months) postoperatively is reported. There was a 9% recurrence for benign tumors and 15% for malignant neoplasms, the latter only in the patients with nonmelanoma malignant neoplasms not receiving postoperative radiotherapy. The most frequent complications were cavity crusting, epicanthal scarring, and epiphora. 
Dementia: case ascertainment in a community survey. The three-stage East Baltimore Mental Health Survey, conducted in 1981 as part of the Epidemiological Catchment Area Program, provided an opportunity to assess the prevalence of dementia and specific dementing disorders in a community-based, cross-sectional sample of the population. From the 3,841 households originally sampled, 810 individuals were selected for clinical psychiatric evaluation. Forty-one individuals were given a provisional diagnosis and referred to Stage 3 for differential diagnosis, with 32 individuals completing this evaluation. Thorough clinical evaluation of these cases resulted in an overall prevalence of dementia of 4.5% in those 65 years of age and older. The prevalence of specific dementing disorders was Alzheimer's disease (AD) (2.0%), Multi-Infarct Dementia (MID) (2.0%) and Mixed Dementia (MD) (0.5%). Prevalence increased with age for all dementias: Non-Whites had higher rates of dementia than Whites; females had higher rates of AD while males had higher rates of MID; and the prevalence of AD increased with increasing education, whereas the prevalence of MID decreased with increased education. Although this study includes only a small number of cases, necessitating some caution in interpreting the results, these figures do represent an estimate of the prevalence of severe dementing disorders and provide a basis for further community study. 
Papular mucinosis in L-tryptophan-induced eosinophilia-myalgia syndrome. Five patients with the L-tryptophan-related eosinophilia-myalgia syndrome had a generalized eruption of flesh-colored papules. In all patients, histologic examination revealed a focal accumulation of mucin in the upper mid dermis, associated with increased dermal cellularity. The mucin was composed predominantly of hyaluronic acid, with small amounts of sulfated acid mucopolysaccharides. The cells within the lesion were fibroblasts. The lesions slowly regressed after L-tryptophan was discontinued. Proposed explanations for the L-tryptophan-related eosinophilia-myalgia syndrome have centered on contaminants, chemically related to L-tryptophan, introduced in the manufacturing process. Tryptophan metabolites have been linked with sclerotic cutaneous diseases but have not been previously implicated in cutaneous mucinoses. 
Fludarabine: a review. The new fluorinated adenine analog, fludarabine, has been tested for efficacy in many tumor types over the past ten years. Two other similar nucleoside analogs are currently available for commercial use. Cytarabine is used principally as an antileukemic agent, and vidarabine as an antiviral. Unlike vidarabine, fludarabine is resistant to deactivation by adenosine deaminase. Data from Phase I and II trials suggest that fludarabine is potentially effective in a number of leukemias, including acute lymphocytic leukemia, acute nonlymphocytic leukemia, and chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). Unfortunately, the doses required to achieve adequate response in the acute leukemias (greater than 75 mg/m2) were above the maximum tolerated dose, resulting in intolerable granulocytopenia, thrombocytopenia, and a life-threatening neurotoxic syndrome. In CLL: however, the dose required to achieve a satisfactory response is well within tolerated limits. Long-term survival statistics are not yet available, but historical perspective strongly correlates response to other agents with increased survival times. Toxicities seen at dose regimens of 15-40 mg/m2/d for five consecutive days include somnolence, metabolic acidosis, confusion, fatigue, nausea, vomiting, increase in serum creatinine and aminotransferase concentrations, and pulmonary and hepatic abnormalities. Mild to severe hematologic toxicity has been observed at all dose levels. 
Endovascular treatment of intracerebral arteriovenous malformations: experience in 49 cases. The authors report the results of treatment in 49 consecutive patients with brain arteriovenous malformations (AVM's) who underwent therapeutic embolization with liquid adhesive agents between 1984 and 1988 at the Toronto Western Hospital. Thirty-three patients had no other treatment and were followed up with angiography at 2 years and clinically from 2 to 6 years. Of the other 16 patients, 10 had adjunctive radiosurgery and six underwent surgical resection following embolization. Seven (14%) of the 49 patients had a morphological cure effected by embolization as evidenced on their 2-year follow-up angiograms: these have remained clinically stable. Twelve patients developed neurological deficits after embolization; eight (16% of the series) were transient and four (8%) were permanent. Two patients (4%) had a delayed hemorrhage after incomplete obliteration of their malformations. Endovascular treatment resulted in clinical improvement in 15 (33%) of the other 46 patients. None of the patients who initially presented with hemorrhage had a rebleed following embolization. It is concluded that endovascular treatment with liquid embolic material can be an integral part of the multidisciplinary treatment protocol for patients with brain AVM's. 
Upper gastrointestinal lesions in elderly patients presenting for endoscopy: relevance of NSAID usage. The occurrence of upper gastrointestinal disease and the relevance of nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drug (NSAID) usage were documented in 511 consecutive patients (321 women, 190 men) over 70 yr old, referred for upper gastrointestinal endoscopy in a district general hospital. The findings were benign esophageal disease (43%), normal (15%), gastric ulcer (11.5%), and duodenal ulcer (11%). Gastric ulcers were more common in women taking NSAIDs (25%) than in NSAID abstainers (7%) p less than 0.001 and male NSAID users (8%) p less than 0.001. Esophagitis and esophageal stricture were not influenced by NSAID usage, but gastric erosions were more common (10% vs. 3%) p less than 0.01. Of 142 patients receiving NSAIDs, 41% presented with hemorrhage, compared with 20.5% of NSAID abstainers (p less than 0.001). Hemorrhage was as common in aspirin takers (15 of 33, 45%) as in standard-dose NANSAID takers (43 of 109, 39%), even though 86% were taking 300 mg of aspirin per day or less. In elderly patients, esophageal disease is common. NSAID use, even low-dose aspirin, is associated with an increased risk of hemorrhage. In females, NSAID usage is associated with gastric ulcer. 
Comparison of restorative proctocolectomy with and without covering ileostomy in ulcerative colitis. The experience of restorative proctocolectomy for ulcerative colitis is reported in 16 consecutive patients with no covering ileostomy (group 2) in comparison with 15 patients with a covering stoma (group 1); in each group a J pouch was constructed. All patients had pre- and postoperative clinical and manometric evaluations of the functional result up to 12 months. There were no deaths or permanent failures. The number of early complications was four in each group. Re-ileostomy was needed in one patient of group 1, and an ileostomy was constructed in three patients of group 2. At 1 year after operation the functional results did not differ between groups 1 and 2 in terms of daily frequency of defaecation (mean 5.6 and 5.4 in 24 h respectively), or in terms of anal basal or maximal squeeze pressures. There was a significant (P less than 0.01) saving in total hospital stay (median 11 days) and in operating theatre time (mean 41 min) in patients with no covering ileostomy. It is concluded that a covering ileostomy may be unnecessary in restorative proctocolectomy, at least in suitable cases with no technical difficulty at the time of operation. 
Characterization of severely and profoundly hearing impaired adults attending an audiology clinic. Despite the fact that around 12 per cent of adult patients attending an audiology department will be severely hearing impaired (pure tone averages of 0.5, 1, 2 and 4 kHz of 70 dB HL or worse in the better hearing ear), their clinical and audiometric characteristics have not been well documented. These characteristics were collected prospectively in 132 adult patients attending a Severe Impairment Clinic, set up to manage their specific problems. The inability to provide sufficient masking makes audiometric assessment of the severity of the impairment uncertain in the poorer hearing ear in 52 per cent of these patients. In addition, the limited bone conduction output makes it almost invariably impossible to assess the masked bone conduction thresholds and hence the air-bone gap in the poorer ear. Hence, accurate characterization is only practical of the better hearing ear in such patients. In 67 per cent of the better hearing ears, there was a mixed hearing impairment, the air-bone gap being 20 dB or greater. The aetiology of the conductive component was almost equally otosclerosis and chronic otitis media. In only 19 per cent was the impairment of a pure sensorineural type, broken down as 6 per cent congenitally acquired, 5 per cent due to meningitis and 9 per cent being adult in onset. In the remaining 14 per cent of patients the type of impairment could not be classified as the bone conductive thresholds were off scale. Having had experience of managing these patients at a special clinic and knowing the workload involved, it is argued that consideration be given to setting up such clinics in most departments. 
Agglutination of blood cardioplegia by cold-reacting autoantibodies. Cold-reacting autoantibodies occasionally occur in patients requiring cardiac operations. This report describes the clinical course of 1 patient with cold-reacting autoantibodies and intracoronary agglutination of the blood cardioplegia solution. Observations made in vivo and in vitro are considered in discussing recommendations for the management of extracorporeal circulation and cardioplegic arrest in patients with clinically silent cold-reacting autoantibodies. 
Toward an integrated understanding of fibromyalgia syndrome. I. Medical and pathophysiological aspects. Fibromyalgia syndrome (FS) is a chronic pain disorder characterized by diffuse musculoskeletal soreness, stiffness, non-restorative sleep and psychological disturbance. At present, much about the etiology, pathological mechanisms and course of FS are unknown. Indeed, standardized diagnostic criteria have only been recently agreed upon. The present paper is the first of a two-part series which reviews the extant empirical literature concerning FS, with a view to arriving at an integrated understanding of the syndrome. The present paper describes the clinical presentation of FS and historical conceptualizations of the disorder. Available research on pathophysiological mechanisms in FS is then presented. In this section we have included literature concerning histology of muscle, sleep architecture, neurotransmitter anomalies and neuropeptide involvement in FS symptomatology. 
Peripheral ameloblastoma: a clinical and histologic study of 11 cases. Peripheral ameloblastoma (PA) is a rare odontogenic tumor. Previously, only 39 cases of PA had been reported in the English literature. In this article 11 additional cases of PA are presented. Concordance with previous cases was evident with regard to race, clinical appearance, and site of predilection. However, differences were observed with regard to age, sex distribution, and predominant histologic pattern. The average age in the current cases is younger, there is no male bias, and the most common histologic pattern is plexiform rather than follicular or acanthomatous. Recurrence following simple excision is rare, but has been reported. Long-term postoperative follow-up is recommended. 
Primary breast lymphoma. Primary breast lymphoma (PBL) is a rare tumor of the breast. Three cases of PBL are being described. All three cases achieved remission following biopsy, chemotherapy, and/or radiotherapy. The literature is extensively reviewed with emphasis on true incidence of PBL and survival rates. 
High-attenuation mediastinal masses on unenhanced CT. On unenhanced CT scans, a variety of mediastinal masses contain areas with attenuation values higher than the attenuation value of the chest wall musculature. The increased attenuation may be diffuse or focal and may be a result of calcium deposition, high iodine content, or areas of acute hemorrhage. This report illustrates the gamut of high-attenuation mediastinal masses seen on unenhanced CT. Masses that are of high attenuation only on IV contrast-enhanced images (e.g., aberrant vessels) are not included. 
Subeschar tissue fluid: a source of cell-mediated immune suppression in victims of severe thermal injury. Thermal injury results in pronounced physiologic alterations in microcirculation at the site of tissue damage. The consequence of these changes is an increase in microvascular permeability, leading to the accumulation of tissue edema, or subeschar tissue fluid (STF). One of the adverse properties of edema is its capacity in vitro to inhibit cell-mediated immune function. Since previous studies evaluated STF collected 5 to 7 days after thermal injury, the present study was designed to determine the time frame during which STF demonstrates its immune suppressive nature. Seven patients with severe thermal injury (30% to 100% total body surface area) were entered into the study. STF was collected in serial fashion, beginning as early as 9 hours after injury and continuing until fascial excision or patient death (maximum of 139 hours after injury). The addition of STF to cultures of lymphocytes obtained from healthy donors resulted in complete inhibition of mitogen-induced lymphocyte proliferation (MILP). Serum collected concomitantly from this group of patients was also capable of inhibiting MILP. From its inception, STF possesses the ability to inhibit MILP; this suppressive nature is stable, persisting for prolonged periods of time. The gradual absorption of STF likely contributes to the serologic evidence of cell-mediated immune suppression documented in victims of severe thermal injury. 
Protooncogenes and growth factors associated with normal and abnormal liver growth. Hepatocyte replication during liver regeneration depends on extrinsic (circulating) and intrinsic (intrahepatic) factors. Two important growth factors produced in the regenerating liver are discussed, TGF alpha, an autocrine, stimulatory growth factor, and TGF beta, a paracrine inhibitory factor. The balance between the activities of these factors is likely to play an important role in regulating hepatocyte proliferation. The expression of some protooncogenes occurs sequentially during the first few hours after partial hepatectomy and is a marker for the entry of hepatocytes into the cell cycle (proliferative competence). As hepatocytes become competent to proliferate, they respond to TGF alpha and other growth factors and enter a proliferative phase. It is possible that TGF beta 1 serves as a stop signal for liver regeneration but the mechanisms by which TGF beta inhibits hepatocyte DNA synthesis are still unknown. 
Relation of psychopathology in general medical inpatients to use and cost of services. The authors investigated the relation between psychopathology in medically ill inpatients and use and cost of medical care services. Of 455 medical inpatients, the Medical Inpatient Screening Test identified 27.9% as very depressed, 27.5% as very anxious, 20.2% as having cognitive dysfunction, and 8.6% as having high pain levels. Overall, the test identified 51% of the patients as having high levels of psychopathology or pain. These subjects had a 40% longer median length of hospital stay and 35% greater mean hospital costs than those with low levels of psychopathology or pain. Patients with greater psychopathology also had higher hospital charges, more procedures during hospitalization, and more discharge diagnoses but did not differ from the other patients in sex, race, age, diagnosis-related group (DRG) major diagnostic category, or DRG weight. 
Enhancement of pulsed-dye laser ablation of arterial tissues with blood medium: effects of laser-induced shock waves. The influence of blood medium on tissue ablation by a pulsed dye laser and its selectivity for atheroma were investigated. The role of shock waves on tissue ablation was also evaluated. Normal and atherosclerotic human aortas were irradiated by a 480 nm pulsed dye laser activated at 5 Hz. The laser was coupled with a single 0.2 mm fiber (Uni-guide) (40 mjoules/pulse) or a multifiber catheter (14 x 150 microns) (100 mjoules/pulse). Shock waves were measured using a fluid-filled catheter connected to a strain gauge manometer. With the Uni-guide, pulse-dye lasing resulted in greater ablation of atheroma in blood (11.6 x 10(-3) mm3/joule, p less than 0.001 versus atheroma measured in saline and normal tissue in blood) followed by normal tissue in blood (2.5 x 10(-3)mm3/joule), atheroma in saline (1.71 x 10(-3)mm3/joule, p less than 0.05 versus normal tissue in saline), and normal tissue in saline (0.54 x 10(-3) mm3/joule). With the multifiber catheter, laser ablation was the greatest in atheroma in blood (0.55 +/- 0.26 mm3/joule p less than 0.001 versus atheroma in saline and normal tissue in blood), followed by normal tissue in blood (0.27 +/- 0.12 mm3/joule), atheroma in saline (0.14 +/- 0.15 mm3/joule, p less than 0.001 versus normal tissue in saline), and normal tissue in saline (0 mm3/joule). The ablation efficiency of the multifiber catheter was greater than that of the Uni-guide (p less than 0.0001). 
Isolated incisional metastases after intraperitoneal radioactive chromic phosphate therapy for ovarian carcinoma. Two women developed apparently isolated recurrences of ovarian carcinoma involving prior incisions after receiving intraperitoneal radioactive chromic phosphate (P-32) adjuvant therapy for early epithelial ovarian carcinoma. Both are alive without evidence of disease at second-look laparotomy after surgical resection of the abdominal wall metastases and cisplatin-based combination chemotherapy. Mechanisms of cutaneous and incisional implantation metastases are discussed. Adjuvant therapy with intraperitoneal P-32 is unable to provide systemic therapy for occult metastatic disease. The favorable outcome in these cases probably reflects limited tumor burden at the time of recurrence and stands in stark contrast to other cases of soft tissue recurrences of ovarian carcinoma reported previously. 
Blockade of the ATP-sensitive potassium channel modulates reactive hyperemia in the canine coronary circulation. The mechanism of reactive hyperemia remains unknown. We hypothesized that reactive hyperemia was related to the opening of ATP-sensitive potassium channels during coronary occlusion. The resulting hyperpolarization of the smooth muscle cell plasma membrane might reduce calcium influx through voltage-dependent calcium channels and result in relaxation of smooth muscle tone and vasodilation. In eight open-chest, anesthetized dogs, 30-second coronary occlusions resulted in an average flow debt repayment of 200 +/- 41%. After low-dose (0.8 mumol/min) and high-dose (3.7 mumol/min) infusion of intracoronary glibenclamide, flow debt repayment fell to 76 +/- 14% and 50 +/- 8%, respectively (p less than 0.05 compared with control for both). The decline in flow debt repayment was due to a significant reduction both in maximum coronary conductance during reactive hyperemia and in its duration. In addition, there was a significant decline in the sensitivity of the coronary circulation to adenosine-induced vasodilation after glibenclamide. While more variable, there was no overall change in the sensitivity of the coronary vasculature to acetylcholine-induced vasodilation after glibenclamide. We conclude that reactive hyperemia is determined in a large part by the ATP-sensitive potassium channel, probably through its effect on membrane potential and voltage-sensitive calcium channels. Because reactive hyperemia was never fully abolished at the highest doses of glibenclamide tested, it is possible that additional mechanisms are involved in the genesis of this complex phenomenon. 
Volume tests for chronic venous insufficiency: an appraisal. Chronic venous disease is increasingly treated surgically with a variety of experimental procedures. Noninvasive volume tests are commonly used before surgery to select patients and after surgery to assess results. Rapid volume changes are considered to indicate regurgitation. Rigorous statistical validation of tests and the confounding nature of unmeasured arterial inflow are seldom considered. Volume changes were measured in 29 control limbs and 35 limbs with venous disease, with mercury-in-silicone rubber strain gauges, for both exercise and elevation. Normalization for arterial flow permitted calculation of the regurgitation rate. Normal (95% confidence) limits for measured and calculated parameters were determined. Specificity was shown by the percent of normal parameter values for control limbs and sensitivity by the percent of abnormal values for extremities with venous disease. Arterial flow significantly altered volume curves. Normalization increased specificity and sensitivity significantly. Calf exercise tests, even normalized, were too insensitive to be reliable. Elevation tests were significantly more sensitive for determining regurgitation. However, exercise tests were useful and supplied important information about the calf muscle pump. We conclude that, as currently used, many limb volume test procedures are unsuitable but could be improved significantly by normalization to reduce the confounding effect of regional arterial flow and use of an elevation test to measure regurgitation. 
Identification of a mutation in porcine ryanodine receptor associated with malignant hyperthermia. Malignant hyperthermia (MH) causes neurological, liver, and kidney damage and death in humans and major economic losses in the swine industry. A single point mutation in the porcine gene for the skeletal muscle ryanodine receptor (ryr1) was found to be correlated with MH in five major breeds of lean, heavily muscled swine. Haplotyping suggests that the mutation in all five breeds has a common origin. Assuming that this is the causal mutation for MH, the development of a noninvasive diagnostic test will provide the basis for elimination of the MH gene or its controlled inclusion in swine breeding programs. 
Severe oral phenytoin overdose does not cause cardiovascular morbidity. STUDY OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the potential for cardiovascular toxicity from severe oral phenytoin overdose. STUDY POPULATION: Fifty-seven patients admitted during a two-year period to an inner-city hospital for severe oral phenytoin overdose, which is defined as a peak level of 40 micrograms/mL or more. METHODS: Case records were reviewed retrospectively for symptoms and signs of phenytoin toxicity, especially circulatory effects. Baseline and toxic 12-lead ECGs, when available, were reviewed in detail. Continuous variables were compared using either paired or unpaired t tests, as appropriate. Significance was taken as P less than or equal to .05. RESULTS: Mean peak phenytoin level was 49.4 +/- 7.7 micrograms/mL. Continuous single-lead ECG monitoring in 36 patients (63%) for a mean of 26.5 +/- 21.6 hours revealed no incidents of dysrhythmia requiring treatment. ECGs recorded during toxicity in 52 cases (91%) revealed no clinically significant abnormalities attributable to phenytoin. ECGs during toxic and baseline states were available for detailed analysis in 15 cases. Ten patients exhibited an increase in PR interval (mean, 19 +/- 10 ms) when toxic, whereas five had a decrease (mean, 18 +/- 11 ms) compared with nontoxic records. No change in heart rate, QRS duration, or corrected QT interval was observed. There were no circulatory complications and no deaths. CONCLUSION: Cardiovascular toxicity is rarely a manifestation of oral phenytoin overdose. Routine management of stable patients with severe phenytoin overdose in a monitored setting is not mandatory. 
Neurotoxicity of intraventricularly administered alpha-interferon for leptomeningeal disease. Nine patients with leptomeningeal disease are reported who were treated with intraventricular alpha-interferon (alpha-IFN). In seven of these patients, a progressive vegetative state developed during treatment. The patients became unresponsive to verbal commands but opened their eyes with auditory or tactile stimulation. It took an average of 3 weeks for these patients to become verbally responsive after treatment was discontinued. Electroencephalographic findings showed evidence of irritative involvement of the deep midline nuclei in 80% of patients. Periventricular white matter changes developed during treatment in three of six patients who underwent computed tomographic scans. All patients with this severe neurotoxicity received whole-brain irradiation before treatment. Possible mechanisms for the development of this neurotoxic syndrome are discussed. The neurotoxicity of alpha-IFN and brain irradiation may be additive, suggesting a cautious approach when using this combination for treatment. 
Effects of positive end-expiratory pressure on splanchnic circulation and function in experimental peritonitis. Splanchnic and central hemodynamic effects of positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) were studied in anesthetized pigs using mechanical ventilatory assistance, with or without sepsis (fecal peritonitis). One hour after sepsis, PEEP (10 cm H2O) was applied (n = 6). Another group (n = 6) had sepsis without PEEP. In one group (n = 6) without sepsis, PEEP was applied after 1 hour, while a fourth group (n = 5), without sepsis or PEEP, served as a control. The group with PEEP and sepsis had reduced cardiac index, portal venous blood flow, and liver surface blood flow. The group with PEEP alone had reduced splanchnic circulation by increasing gastrointestinal vascular resistance, while the group with sepsis alone had increased portal vascular resistance. In a separate series with sepsis, intermittent PEEP, and vigorous fluid resuscitation, it was demonstrated that avoiding hypovolemia did not seem to protect from the PEEP effects on the splanchnic circulation. The combination of sepsis and PEEP was not additive on portal blood flow reduction but reduced bile production. 
Factors affecting survival of patients with ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm in a West Virginia community. The hospital records for patients treated for ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysms in southern West Virginia during a recent five year period were reviewed. The over-all mortality rate was 62 per cent. Patients with intraperitoneal rupture had a higher mortality rate (97 per cent) than patients with retroperitoneal rupture (25 per cent). Patients at increased risk were more than 80 years of age, presented with syncope, experienced a short duration of symptoms before seeking medical attention, had preoperative systolic blood pressure levels of less than 90 millimeters of mercury and had a preoperative hemoglobin level of less than 8. Other factors associated with death were a delay in beginning surgical treatment, a larger total blood loss and amount of blood transfused. The results of multivariate analysis demonstrated that preoperative blood pressure, preoperative hemoglobin, presence of syncope and the amount of blood loss were, in large part, reflections of the type of rupture and had only slight independent relationship to mortality. The most effective method of preventing fatal outcome is elective resection of the aneurysms before rupture occurs. 
Anticonvulsant profiles of the potent and orally active GABA uptake inhibitors SK&F 89976-A and SK&F 100330-A and four prototype antiepileptic drugs in mice and rats. The anticonvulsant profiles of two potent and orally active gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) uptake inhibitors, 1-(4,4-diphenyl-3-butenyl)-3-piperidine-carboxylic acid hydrochloride (SK&F 89976-A) and 1-(4,4-diphenyl-3-butenyl)-1,2,5,6-tetrahydro-3-pyridine-carboxylic acid hydrochloride (SK&F 100330-A), were determined with a battery of well-standardized tests in mice and rats and compared with the profiles of phenytoin (PHT), carbamazepine (CBZ), valproate (VPA) and clonazepam (CZP) when subjected to the same tests. ED50 values were calculated and compared with TD50 values for minimal motor impairment to provide protective indexes (PI = TD50/ED50). The anticonvulsant profiles of SK&F 89976-A and SK&F 100330-A were similar and suggest that these compounds raise the threshold for seizure initiation rather than inhibit seizure spread. Like intraperitoneal (i.p.) PHT, CBZ, VPA, and CZP, SK&F 89976-A and SK&F 100330-A inhibited seizures in corneally kindled rats. The profiles of SK&F 89976-A and SK&F 100330-A were most similar to that of CZP and virtually opposite to that of PHT. Intraperitoneal SK&F 100330-A provided complete protection against pentylenetetrazol-induced seizures [subcutaneous (s.c.) PTZ] in mice but was ineffective against seizures induced by maximal electroshock (MES) at doses slightly greater than its TD50. SK&F 100330-A provided complete protection against picrotoxin-induced seizures (s.c. Pic) and against both clonus and forelimb tonic extension induced by NMDA N-methyl-D-aspartate [intracerebral ventricular (i.c.v.)-NMDA] in mice; however, SK&F 100330-A was ineffective against seizures induced by bicuculline (s.c. Bic) and strychnine (s.c. Strych) at doses slightly greater than its TD50. SK&F 89976-A was similar but provided partial protection against NMDA-induced clonus.
