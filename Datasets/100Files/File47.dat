2	Adjuvant antibiotic therapy in duodenal ulcers treated with colloidal bismuth subcitrate. Persistence of Helicobacter pylori after duodenal ulcer healing is associated with high rates of ulcer relapse. We compared colloidal bismuth subcitrate alone with CBS combined with one of four antibiotic regimens in the treatment of duodenal ulcers. Endoscopy and antral biopsies were performed before treatment and four weeks afterwards. Biopsy specimens were examined for histological evidence of gastritis and by Gram stain and culture for H pylori infection. Altogether 141 patients were allocated to one of five treatment groups. Giving CBS and metronidazole (400 mg tid for 7 days) with and without amoxycillin (500 mg tid) achieved higher clearance rates of H pylori than treatment with CBS alone (p less than 0.01). These two combinations also achieved higher rates of antral gastritis healing than CBS alone (p less than 0.01 and p less than 0.05 respectively). Susceptibility to metronidazole was tested in 29 isolates before and in seven isolates after treatment with metronidazole by disc diffusion test and minimum inhibitory concentration assay. Twenty seven (93%) of the isolates were sensitive before treatment while six of seven (86%) were resistant afterwards. Four of the six resistant strains had acquired resistance during treatment and one of these had acquired metronidazole resistance despite concomitant treatment with amoxycillin, to which it remained sensitive. CBS with adjuvant metronidazole at a dose of 400 mg tid for seven days significantly improves the eradication of H pylori compared with CBS alone. Acquired metronidazole resistance, however, seems to be an important cause of failure to eradicate H pylori. 
5	Trial of brief intermittent neuroleptic prophylaxis for selected schizophrenic outpatients: clinical and social outcome at two years. OBJECTIVE--To evaluate a novel approach to the prophylaxis of schizophrenic relapse characterised by administration of brief courses of neuroleptic for the earliest non-psychotic signs of relapse (prodromal symptoms). DESIGN--Two year follow up of subjects randomised, double blind, to receive either active (control group) or placebo (intermittent group) depot neuroleptic medication. Both groups received brief courses of oral neuroleptic when prodromal symptoms or relapse occurred. SETTING--Psychiatric outpatient department, Charing Cross Hospital, London. SUBJECTS--54 Stable patients in remission who met the American Psychiatric Association's DSM-III criteria for schizophrenia on the basis of case notes. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES--Survival without relapse, survival without hospitalisation, point prevalence of extrapyramidal side effects and tardive dyskinesia, structured assessment of social functioning (social adjustment scale II), and frequency of prodromal symptoms. RESULTS--Of 19 relapses recorded over two years, 10 (53%) were preceded by non-psychotic prodromal signs. Survival rates for both relapse and hospitalisation were worse with intermittent treatment than continuous treatment over the two year follow up: 92% of controls and only 54% of patients given intermittent treatment survived the two year period without hospitalisation. Prolonged or frequent relapses as well as episodes of prodromal symptoms were more frequent with intermittent treatment. Lower scores for extrapyramidal side effects were recorded in the intermittent treatment group, but periodic assessments of social functioning failed to show any social advantages from this. CONCLUSION--The findings are at variance with a previous report of one year follow up in this cohort and attest to the superiority of continuous depot neuroleptic prophylaxis in preventing both psychotic and neurotic or dysphoric morbidity in schizophrenia. 
4	Hypersensitivity reactions to epipodophyllotoxins in children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia. The incidence, clinical characteristics, and outcome of hypersensitivity reactions to teniposide (VM-26), etoposide (VP-16), or both were determined in 108 children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) treated with a contemporary regimen of intensive multiagent chemotherapy. Fifty (46%) of the 108 patients had one or more hypersensitivity reactions. The risk of any child having an initial reaction over the cumulative dose range studied was 52% (95% confidence limits, 41% and 63%) for VM-26, compared with 34% (95% confidence limits, 24% and 44%) for VP-16. The risk of having an initial reaction to VM-26 or VP-16 was clearly related to the cumulative dose. This risk peaked at 1500 to 2000 mg/m2 for VM-26 and at 2000-3000 mg/m2 for VP-16. All reactions were Type 1 reactions according to the Gell and Coombs classification, characterized by urticaria, angioedema, flushing, rashes, or hypotension, and 86% of reactions were of Grade 1 or 2 severity according to standard criteria. There was no evidence of increasing clinical severity on repeated rechallenge with premedication, and no deaths occurred. The findings suggested that hypersensitivity reactions to epipodophyllotoxins in children with ALL are more common than previously reported, but only rarely constitute dose-limiting toxicity. 
5	Why do lean hypertensives have higher mortality rates than other hypertensives? Findings of the Hypertension Detection and Follow-up Program. Specific causes of death were analyzed for 10,908 participants in the Hypertension Detection and Follow-up Program, to explore possible explanations for the observed excess 8.3-year mortality from all causes in hypertensives with low body mass. Although the cardiovascular mortality rate among men in the lowest decile of body mass (body mass index 21.96 or less) was 50% higher than that of men in the median class (body mass index 26.4-28.8), death rate for noncardiovascular deaths was more than 2 1/2 times higher in men with lean versus median body mass. The pattern was similar among women. Among noncardiovascular causes, striking differences in mortality rates between lean hypertensives and those of average body mass were observed for cirrhotic death (relative risk of 12+ in men and 11+ in women), for nonmalignant respiratory disease in men (relative risk of 7+), for violent death (both sexes), and for malignant neoplasms in men. Prevalence of smoking was almost twice as high in the lowest compared with the median body mass group; among the lean, excess deaths, particularly noncardiovascular deaths, were concentrated among smokers. Thus, male smokers in the lowest decile of body mass constituted only 3% of the study population, but contributed 8% of all deaths, 11% of all noncardiovascular deaths, and 22% of all cirrhotic deaths. A larger proportion of deaths occurred early in follow-up in the lean versus other hypertensives, suggesting occult disease among the lean at baseline. There was no evidence that more severe or treatment-resistant hypertension was present in or could explain excess mortality among the hypertensives with low body mass. The inference from the findings is not that overweight is protective for hypertensives nor that excess risk is due to leanness per se. Rather, a reasonable hypothesis, particularly from findings on specific causes of death, is that excess mortality in lean hypertensives is due to deleterious lifestyles, particularly smoking and excess alcohol intake, contributing to both leanness and risk of death. 
2	The relationship of headache symptoms with severity and duration of attacks. Efforts to develop clinically useful headache classification schemes have generally focused on linking specific symptom groupings with specific headache subtypes. An alternative conceptual approach, the "severity model" of headache, considers a continuum of headache ranging from mild to severe forms with specific headache subtypes distinguished by level of severity rather than unique constellations of symptoms. A population-based telephone interview was carried out among 10,169 subjects aged 12-29 to estimate the prevalence of serious headaches and better characterize symptoms that accompany headache attacks. In an analysis of frequency of occurrence, pain and duration of recent (within 4 weeks prior to interview) headache attacks, the data revealed that common symptoms (such as forehead pain and pain in the back of the head, neck and shoulders) were reported frequently, but headaches with these symptoms were generally characterized by low levels of pain and short duration. Although not an original study objective, the data were analyzed to determine whether distinct symptom constellations could be identified or whether symptoms overlapped between headache types. Symptoms of migraine were frequently experienced concomitant with tension-type symptoms; the resultant headaches were usually characterized as moderate in intensity. In contrast, symptoms usually associated with migraine in the absence of concomitant tension-type symptoms were infrequently experienced, but resulted in headaches causing the greatest disability. The data provide some support for the severity model of headache. 
1	A multicentre follow-up study of 1152 patients with myasthenia gravis in Italy. A multicentre retrospective study was carried out on the characteristics and course of myasthenia gravis (MG) in Italy. Data from 1152 patients, fairly representative of the myasthenic population seeking medical advice, were analysed for diagnostic criteria, clinical aspects and therapeutic approaches. Mean follow-up was 4.9 years. The disease was correctly diagnosed within 2 years of the onset in 80% of cases. Onset of symptoms peaked in the second and third decade in females and fell between 20 and 59 years in males. At first observation 87% of the patients had generalized MG. Maximal worsening was observed within 3 years in 77% of patients. At the last follow-up, 35% of cases were symptom-free (pharmacological remission 24%, remission without treatment 11%). The more severe the disease at the first observation and at the maximal worsening of symptoms, the lower was the proportion of remissions. Steroids were given in 54% and immunosuppressants in 18%. Thymectomy was performed in 72%, mostly in women, younger than age 40, and with generalized MG. Thymectomy seemed to improve the course of the disease, mostly in patients operated on shortly after diagnosis and those with generalized mild-to-moderate disease and with a normally involuted thymus. MG was lethal in 4% of patients, principally men, older than 40, in grade 3 or worse at first observation, with a short history of disease, and with thymona. 
2	Pathogenesis of gallstones. The many developments in nonoperative methods for the treatment of gallstone disease underscore the importance of understanding the pathogenesis of these stones. Elucidation of the factors responsible for nucleation of crystals and the mechanism by which it occurs would appear to be the challenge if we are to define the cascade of events that results in gallstone formation. 
2	Recurrent peritonitis: evidence for possible viral etiology. A 45-year-old woman who was treated with continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD) developed recurrent peritonitis characterized by cloudy effluents, elevated white blood cell (WBC) counts (predominantly lymphocytes), and negative culture results. This case report suggests that she may have had viral peritonitis as indicated by a positive viral culture, the presence of viral antibodies in serum and peritoneal dialysis effluent (PDE), hematological findings, and cell surface receptor studies. The possibility of a viral cause should be considered in patients with culture-negative peritonitis, especially if they do not respond to antibiotics. 
5	An intracranial mass lesion in systemic xanthogranulomatosis: case report. The authors describe a 42-year-old woman with systemic xanthogranulomatosis and bilateral intraorbital tumors, who subsequently developed multiple lesions of the intracranial dura mater, spinal cord, retroperitoneum, pericardium, and mediastinum. Systemic xanthogranulomatosis is histologically similar to systemic Weber-Christian disease, except for the absence of subcutaneous panniculitis. Immunohistochemical studies suggest that this clinical entity can be differentiated from histiocytosis X, because foamy cells in systemic xanthogranulomatosis demonstrate macrophages but not T-zone histiocyte markers. Differentiation of this disease from other intracranial xanthogranulomas and treatment are discussed. 
5	The ectopic ovary. A case report and review of the literature. We describe an ectopic ovary in a stillborn female. To our knowledge, this is the first report of an extra ovary in an infant. This case prompted a review of ectopic ovarian tissue, which is known by a variety of terms, the most common being accessory ovary and supernumerary ovary. We suggest that (1) many of the past cases should be classified as ovarian implants rather than true embryologically derived ectopic tissue; and (2) the terms accessory ovary and supernumerary ovary are imprecise and should be modified. 
1	Insulin-like growth factors are mitogenic for human keratinocytes and a squamous cell carcinoma. Normal adult human keratinocytes in monolayer culture and SCL-1, a skin-derived squamous-cell carcinoma cell line, were investigated for the expression of receptors for insulin-like growth factors (IGF) and insulin. As demonstrated by affinity crosslinking, radiolabeled IGF-1, IGF-2, and insulin bound specifically to both cell types. Each cell expressed type I IGF receptors, with affinity for IGF-1 greater than IGF-2 much greater than insulin. Insulin receptors, with highest affinity for insulin, were also present on both cells. However, keratinocytes and SCL-1 cells differed in 125I-IGF-2 binding. 125I-IGF-2-bound to both type I and type II IGF receptors in normal keratinocytes, but bound predominantly to membrane-associated IGF binding proteins in SCL-1. IGF-1 was slightly more potent than IGF-2 in stimulating growth of both keratinocytes and SCL-1 cells. In keratinocytes, concentrations of IGF-1 ranging from 5-100 ng/ml, and of IGF-2 from 50-100 ng/ml, resulted in a significant increase in cell number. At the maximum dose of 100 ng/ml, either IGF-1 or IGF-2 caused a 2.3-times increase in cell number. In SCL-1 cells, IGF-1 was more potent than IGF-2 or insulin at lower concentrations, but either IGF-1 or IGF-2 at the maximal concentration of 333 ng/ml stimulated a 4.7-times increase in thymidine incorporation. The stimulatory effect of insulin in SCL-1 was 10-50 times less potent than that of the IGF. The effect of either IGF on SCL-1 was completely inhibited by the type I IGF receptor antibody alpha IR-3, suggesting that both IGFs are mitogenic through the type I IGF receptor. Insulin action was partially blocked by alpha IR-3, suggesting that insulin can act through both the insulin and type I IGF receptors. It thus appears that IGF-1 and IGF-2 are mitogens for normal and transformed human keratinocytes and that their actions are primarily mediated through the type I IGF receptor, whereas insulin is a mitogen through both the IGF-1 receptor and the insulin receptor. 
5	Renal artery stenosis: in vivo perfusion MR imaging. The intravoxel incoherent motion (IVIM) model of perfusion and diffusion imaging was applied to an in vivo canine model of unilateral renal artery stenosis and was compared with relative renal blood flow determination with radioactive microspheres. The percentage relative renal blood flow as determined with radioactive microspheres correlated closely with the percentage apparent diffusion coefficient. If this method can be adapted to human imaging, it may provide a noninvasive means for detecting renal artery stenosis. 
1	The role of adjuvant chemotherapy following cystectomy for invasive bladder cancer: a prospective comparative trial. We assigned 91 patients with deeply invasive, pathological stage P3, P4 or N+ and Mo transitional cell carcinoma of the bladder (with or without squamous or glandular differentiation) to adjuvant chemotherapy or to observation after radical cystectomy and pelvic lymph node dissection. For most patients chemotherapy was planned as 4 courses at 28-day intervals of 100 mg./M.2 cisplatin, 60 mg./M.2 doxorubicin and 600 mg./M.2 cyclophosphamide. A significant delay was shown in the time to progression (p = 0.0010) with 70% of the patients assigned to chemotherapy free of disease at 3 years compared to 46% in the observation group. Median survival time for patients in the chemotherapy group was 4.3 years compared to 2.4 years in the observation group (p = 0.0062). In addition to treatment groups, important prognostic factors included age, gender and lymph node status. The number of involved lymph nodes was the single most important variable. We recommend adjuvant chemotherapy for patients with invasive transitional cell carcinoma after definitive surgical resection. 
1	Bronchogenic carcinoma in situ on the carina eradicated by endobronchial biopsy. Squamous cell carcinoma in situ of the bronchus is a rare disorder in an isolated clinical setting. We present a case of carcinoma in situ located on the carina with excisional biopsy via a fiberoptic bronchoscope and no recurrence after five years. To our knowledge, this represents the only case of carcinoma in situ treated solely with excisional biopsy. This case further emphasizes the importance of securing biopsy specimens for all mucosal abnormalities and raises the possibility of limited excision as sole therapy for carcinoma in situ. 
1	Extracranial metastases of medulloblastoma in adults: literature review. A consecutive series of 30 cases of extracranial medulloblastoma metastases in adults is analysed. The majority of the patients were males with a 3:1 male/female ratio. Bone was the most frequent site of metastases in adults (77%) and children (78%), followed by lymph nodes (33%) in both children and adults. Lung metastases were more common in adults (17%), but liver metastases occurred more frequently in children (15%). Possible routes of spread and development of metastases are discussed, with special emphasis on the role of shunts in tumour seeding. Distant extracranial metastatic spread of medulloblastoma occurs at the rate of 7.1%. Mean interval between operation of the primary tumour and the discovery of metastases was shorter in children (20 months) than in adults (36 months). Survival after the discovery of metastases was also shorter in children (5 months) than in adults (9.5 months). Shunts were associated with an earlier appearance of metastases and with a poorer prognosis. A detailed review of the literature of 119 cases of medulloblastoma with extracranial metastases is provided. 
5	Arterial protection: a neglected but crucial therapeutic goal. Hypertension is accompanied by 2 major types of arterial pathologic conditions: smooth muscle hypertrophy of arteriolar resistance vessels and atherosclerosis, primarily involving the larger arteries. Smooth muscle hypertrophy may develop either as a secondary defense against elevated intravascular pressure or as a primary defect responsible for the increased pressure. Insulin and a number of other trophic stimuli may play a pathogenetic role in vascular hypertrophy. Reducing blood pressure and trophic stimuli may cause hypertrophy to be reversed. Because atherosclerosis may be markedly accelerated by hypertension, especially in the presence of concomitant risk factors, such as hypercholesterolemia, cigarette smoking and diabetes mellitus, antihypertensive treatment may attenuate or even reverse the extent of atherosclerosis, but only when the causative factors are also corrected. Some commonly used antihypertensive agents, e.g., diuretics and beta blockers without intrinsic sympathomimetic activity, often aggravate hypercholesterolemia and glucose intolerance, thereby diminishing their potential protective value. Other types of drug therapy, such as alpha blockers, beta blockers with intrinsic sympathomimetic activity or other vasodilator activity, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and calcium entry blockers that may not induce biochemical changes, should provide better control of multiple risks and thereby better protection against atherosclerosis. With a better understanding of how hypertension induces arterial damage, clinicians will be able to provide more appropriate treatment and, it is hoped, alleviate such damage. 
5	Detection of vascular complications in renal allografts with color Doppler flow imaging. One hundred ninety-five color Doppler flow (CDF) examinations were performed in 146 renal allografts to assess the capabilities of this technique in detecting intra- or extrarenal vascular complications. Conventional angiography was also performed in 44 transplants. In the group of transplants with angiographic correlation, CDF sonography enabled correct identification of 30 of 34 vascular complications. CDF showed 10 of 11 significant stenoses of the renal artery or of one of its main branches. There were two false-positive renal artery stenoses (one normal artery and one 40% stenosis). Nine of nine renal artery thromboses and the single pseudoaneurysm were also identified. Within the parenchyma, CDF sonography demonstrated five of five segmental infarcts, two of two postbiopsy arteriovenous fistulas, and three of six segmental or interlobar artery stenoses. Measurement of peak systolic velocity showed a significant difference (P less than .05) between a group (n = 8) with significant stenosis of the renal artery or one of its main branches (mean, 215.2 cm/sec +/- 32) and a group (n = 14) without stenosis (mean, 99.2 cm/sec +/- 19). 
2	Cyclic pelvic pain. Cyclic pelvic pain is a common gynecologic problem caused by relatively few diseases, which usually can be diagnosed and remedied quickly. Some complaints reflect normal physiologic aspects of the menstrual cycle (mittelschmerz, menstrual awareness). Premenstrual syndrome can be diagnosed, but an effective and convenient treatment is lacking. Dysmenorrhea is the commonest source of cyclic pain, diagnosed by its characteristic history and rapid relief on administration of antiprostaglandin agents. Endometriosis is diagnosed surgically and best treated either surgically then, or medically by danazol or GnRH agonists. In contrast, adenomyosis is a problem commonly encountered in later life, and hysterectomy is usually needed for both definitive diagnosis and treatment. 
4	The antihypertensive efficacy of hydrochlorothiazide is not prostacyclin dependent. We tested the hypothesis that vascular prostacyclin synthesis is stimulated by hydrochlorothiazide and could account for some of the drug's antihypertensive effect. We studied 13 patients with mild essential hypertension in a randomized, double-blind design to assess the effects of indomethacin on hydrochlorothiazide's ability to lower blood pressure, alter body weight, stimulate plasma renin activity, and modulate vascular prostacyclin biosynthesis as assessed by the urinary excretion of the major enzymatically produced metabolite of prostacyclin, 2,3-dinor-6-keto-prostaglandin F1 alpha (PGF1 alpha), measured by GC/MS. Administration of hydrochlorothiazide, 50 mg daily for 2 weeks, was associated with a significant decrease in both systolic and diastolic blood pressure in both supine (systolic, 148 +/- 3 to 136 +/- 3 mm Hg; diastolic, 97 +/- 2 to 94 +/- 3 mm Hg) and upright (systolic, 151 +/- 4 to 131 +/- 2 mm Hg; diastolic, 103 +/- 2 to 97 +/- 3 mm Hg) positions. Hydrochlorothiazide administration resulted in a 1 kg weight loss and stimulation of plasma renin activity from 1.7 +/- 0.4 to 5.3 +/- 1.1 ng angiotensin I/ml/hr. However, the urinary excretion of 2,3-dinor-6-keto-PGF1 alpha was unchanged after administration of hydrochlorothiazide (86 +/- 13/ng/gm creatinine during placebo, 74 +/- 13 ng/gm during week 1 of hydrochlorothiazide, and 70 +/- 9 ng/gm during week 2 of the drug). Administration of indomethacin, 50 mg twice a day, resulted in greater than 60% inhibition of 2,3-dinor-6-keto-PGF1 alpha excretion but did not affect the antihypertensive response to hydrochlorothiazide. Indomethacin did not oppose the diuretic effect of hydrochlorothiazide as assessed by weight loss but did attenuate the rise in plasma renin activity. Our data demonstrate that the blood pressure-lowering effect of a thiazide diuretic does not require enhanced prostacyclin synthesis and the cyclooxygenase inhibitor indomethacin does not antagonize the antihypertensive efficacy of hydrochlorothiazide. 
5	Noninvasive diagnosis of right-sided extracardiac conduit obstruction by combined magnetic resonance imaging and continuous-wave Doppler echocardiography. Right-sided extracardiac conduits are frequently complicated by obstruction over time. We compared the utility of two-dimensional and Doppler echocardiography and magnetic resonance imaging in the diagnosis of postoperative right-sided obstruction with cardiac catheterization and angiography in 10 patients with xenograft or homograft conduits. Correlation (r = 0.95) between continuous-wave Doppler estimates and catheter pullback pressure gradients across the conduits was excellent. Echocardiography could only visualize five of 10 conduits in their entirety. Magnetic resonance imaging visualized all conduits and showed statistically significant (kappa = 0.58) agreement with angiography in the localization and estimation of severity of a variety of right-sided obstructions in these patients. However, flow voids created by the metallic ring around xenograft valves led to a false negative diagnosis of valvular stenosis in four patients when magnetic resonance imaging was used alone. Doppler studies correctly indicated obstruction in these patients. The combination of magnetic resonance imaging studies and continuous-wave Doppler echocardiography can be useful to noninvasively evaluate right-sided obstruction in postoperative patients with right-sided extracardiac conduits. 
1	Capillary hemangioma of the right main bronchus treated by sleeve resection in infancy. Respiratory distress developed in a 5-month-old female infant with roentgenographic evidence of hyperinflation of the right lung. Bronchoscopy revealed a vascular tumor extending from the medial wall of the right main bronchus leading to a check-valve mechanism. Radionuclide lung scans showed ventilation and perfusion of the right side reduced to 36 and 11% of the total lung ventilation and perfusion, respectively. At the age of 7 months a sleeve of the right main bronchus was resected and a reanastomosis performed. The operation specimen contained a capillary hemangioma measuring 1.2 X 0.6 cm. The postoperative course was uneventful. Perfusion of the right lung had markedly improved 6 months after the operation, and at the age of 2 yr and 9 months it was completely normal. Capillary hemangiomas must be considered a cause of bronchial obstruction in infancy, and surgery can be performed successfully. 
5	Functional results of facial nerve suture after removal of acoustic neurinoma: analysis of 25 cases. The facial nerve is sometimes severed during the removal of acoustic neurinomas, either intentionally to ensure complete removal, or unintentionally because of difficulties in identification. In such cases we have, if possible, sutured the nerve stumps microsurgically, either end to end or by use of an intervening nerve graft. We analyzed the outcome of 25 instances of facial nerve suturing in a series of 219 patients operated on for acoustic neurinoma from 1979 to 1987. The first signs of recovery appeared at an average of 12 months, and there was continued improvement for several years. Recovery was graded from 1 to 6. The anastomosis was successful in 24 of the 25 sutured nerves, in that at least some facial movement and tone were restored (Grade 5 or higher). In 11 of the 25 cases, facial appearance at rest and with movement was moderately good (Grade 2 or 3). A Grade 1 result, with no perceivable facial dysfunction, was never achieved. Typically, oral muscles showed the most improvement and frontal muscles the least. Facial appearance was better at rest than with movement, which was always complicated by some degree of synkinesis. Closure of the eye was so good in 13 of the 25 cases that neither tarsorrhaphy nor an eyelid spring was necessary. When the facial nerve is severed, intraoperative suture is recommended, because it provides a chance for moderately good restoration of facial appearance. 
5	Effects of preoperative radiotherapy on rectal cancer. Preliminary report on combining radiation with intratumor injections of peplomycin and bromodeoxyuridine. Between 1976 and 1983, 61 patients with advanced rectal cancer underwent Miles' operation at the authors' institution. All lesions were located 10 cm or less from the anal verge. Of these patients, 25 were treated by surgery alone and 36 were given preoperative radiotherapy. The total dose was 42.6 Gy, (30.6 Gy [1.8 Gy/fr x 5/week]) delivered to the entire pelvis plus an additional 12 Gy (3.0 Gy/fr x 4/week) delivered to the primary tumor. Of 36 patients, 21 were administered intratumor injections of peplomycin and bromodeoxyuridine at the time of boost radiation and 15 were treated without intratumor injections. During the follow-up period (3 to 9 years), in the groups of patients who underwent radiation, there was only one local failure (2.8 percent). In contrast, in the group of patients treated by surgery alone, eight local failures occurred (32 percent). The intratumor injection significantly enhanced the effect of radiation on tumor regression. The incidence of positive lymph nodes was higher in patients in the surgery alone group than it was in the groups treated with radiation. There was no difference in the rate of distant metastasis among the three treatment groups. The five-year survival rate for the radiation with intratumor injection group, radiation alone group, and surgery alone group, was 77.8, 69.2, and 56.0 percent, respectively. No severe complication was experienced. 
1	Glycolysis as primary energy source in tumor cell chemotaxis. The energy requirements via glycolytic pathways were directly measured in migrating tumor cells. Motility in the metastatic human melanoma cell line A2058, stimulated by insulinlike growth factor I (IGF-I), depends on glycolysis in the presence of glucose as its principal source of energy. Motility in glucose-free medium was 75% reduced and utilized mitochondrial respiration (inhibited by oligomycin). With increasing (physiologic) glucose concentrations, there was a dramatic shift to anaerobic glycolysis as the energy source and 93% elimination of the oligomycin inhibition of motility. Oxamate, an inhibitor of glycolysis, inhibited motility at all glucose concentrations. CO2 production from glycolysis and from the hexose monophosphate shunt was measured in migrating tumor cells. The time course and glucose-dose dependence of glycolytic CO2 production correlated directly with motility. In contrast, mitochondrial CO2 production was inversely related to glucose concentration. A monoclonal antibody for the IGF-I receptor inhibited both motility and glycolytic CO2 production, indicating that both processes are receptor mediated. 
5	Immunohistochemical study of cytokeratin expression in normal and pathologic middle ear mucosa of the rat. The expression of cytokeratins in the epithelium of the middle ear and external auditory meatus of the rat was studied on cryosections of ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid-decalcified specimens by use of a panel of monoclonal antibodies. The normal middle ear epithelium revealed a complex cytokeratin profile, including regional differences. The induction of sterile middle ear effusions resulted in increased cytokeratin expression. Infective effusions were accompanied by both quantitative and qualitative changes in the cytokeratin expression patterns. The differences observed between the cytokeratin profiles of external meatal skin and those of middle ear epithelium may form a useful tool for research into cholesteatoma development. 
1	Localization of trophoblastic disease with vaginal ultrasonography. A report of two cases. Two patients had elevated beta-human chorionic gonadotropin levels and normal abdominal ultrasound examinations. In both instances transvaginal ultrasonography demonstrated a persistent nodule of trophoblastic disease confirmed at the time of hysterectomy. This new imaging modality can assist in the diagnosis of persistent trophoblastic disease in the uterus. 
1	Neodymium:YAG laser treatment of bladder hemangiomas. We present 3 cases of bladder hemangiomas, one single and two multiple, with a long-term history of recurrent hematuria, treated with endoscopic neodymium:YAG (yttrium, aluminum, garnet) laser photocoagulation, and obtaining good results. 
3	Spontaneous decompression of syringomyelia: magnetic resonance imaging findings. Case report. The case of a 30-year-old woman with Chiari I malformation and a cervicothoracic syrinx is presented. The patient was followed clinically over a 2 1/2-year period. Spontaneous and complete resolution of the syrinx, as documented by serial magnetic resonance studies, was accompanied by only a minimal change in objective symptomatology. 
5	Perturbation of differentiated functions during viral infection in vivo. In vivo relationship of host genes and lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus to growth hormone deficiency. Retarded growth and disordered glucose metabolism secondary to growth hormone (GH) deficiency are associated with persistent lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV) infection of GH-producing cells in the anterior lobe of the pituitary gland. Infected C3H/ST mice, which are H-2k haplotype, become GH deficient, and LCMV replicates in most (more than 90%) of their GH-producing cells. In contrast, BALB/WEHI and SWR/J mice, which are H-2d and H-2q, respectively, do not develop this GH deficiency, and less than 20% of their GH-producing cells are infected by virus. Yet all three strains infected at birth with LCMV strain Armstrong (ARM) carry equivalent amounts of virus in their blood, brain, heart, kidney, liver, spleen, and thymus throughout life. Of five additional H-2k murine strains tested, C3H/HEJ and CBA/N mice develop this GH-like disorder, whereas neither AKR/J, B10/BR, nor BALB/KAE mice do, indicating that the H-2K haplotype does not control the GH susceptibility. Furthermore C3H/SW mice, which have the H-2b haplotype on the C3H background, develop the disease, again negating any correlation with H-2k but inferring that the C3H background is responsible. One half of the hybrid offspring produced by crossing the C3H/ST GH-deficient strain with BALB/WEHI-resistant mice develop the disease, but the trait is not sex linked. F1 hybrid backcrosses with the susceptible C3H/ST parental strain or resistant BALB/WEHI strain indicate the involvement of more than two genes. Hence the development of a GH deficiency by LCMV-infected C3H/ST mice is not linked to the MHC haplotype, is not sex linked, and is not due to a dominant gene. Multiple genes are involved and these are related to C3H background. 
5	Acute and chronic bacterial prostatitis: a review of treatment approaches. Some authors describe acute bacterial prostatitis as a self-limiting disease, and as with any other acute septic condition, parenteral broad-spectrum antibiotic therapy is indicated. Chronic bacterial prostatitis, however, is associated with a causative organism persisting unaltered in prostatic fluid and leading to relapsing urinary tract infections. In the 1970s, several workers produced a classification system and bacteriologic localization cultures for establishing the diagnosis of prostatitis. Krieger and Crawford point to an important factor that is omitted in many clinical trials with episodes of chronic bacterial prostatitis in men. If localization studies of the prostate infection are attempted in the presence of bacteriuria, the urine must be sterilized with nitrofurantoin or penicillin G. Urine cultures obtained from first-voided urine, bladder urine, and urine voided after prostatic massage should show no growth, and the expressed prostatic secretion can then be examined for evidence of prostatic infection. This procedure reduces the contamination of the expressed prostatic secretion by the organism from the urinary tract infection. This is important, because antibiotic treatment is determined by the sensitivity of the organism isolated from the prostate as well as by the ability of the antibiotics to penetrate the prostate. Meares outlines the pharmacokinetic features needed for drug diffusion into prostatic fluid and provides detailed information on the physical characteristics of the prostate during acute and chronic bacterial prostatitis. Unfortunately, the choice of an ideal drug cannot be extrapolated from this information because pharmacodynamic principles cannot predict clinical efficacy. Some authors find that sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim has the best cure rate in the treatment of chronic bacterial prostatitis. 
5	Pars plana vitrectomy for acute retinal detachment in penetrating ocular injuries. We studied 41 eyes with acute retinal detachment after penetrating ocular trauma in a retrospective cohort analysis. Pars plana vitrectomy was performed in 28 eyes, while the remaining 13 eyes had only primary repair and closure of the wound. The two groups differed in the type of trauma (more gunshot wounds in the vitrectomy group and more blunt injuries in the nonvitrectomized group). Visual success (visual acuity of 5/200 or better) was observed in 10 (37%) of the eyes treated by vitrectomy compared with one (8%) of the eyes in the nonvitrectomy group. Anatomic success was achieved in 21 (75%) of the eyes in the vitrectomy group but in only one (8%) of those in the nonvitrectomy group. Enucleation or phthisis was observed in seven (54%) of the eyes in the nonvitrectomy group compared with only five (18%) in the vitrectomy group. Significant prognostic factors for anatomic outcome in the vitrectomy group were the location of the laceration and the presence of the lens. 
1	A case of multiple pilar tumors and pilar cysts involving the scalp and back. The case of a patient with multiple proliferating trichilemmal tumors and trichilemmal cysts of the scalp and back is discussed. The multicentric presentation of this tumor is unusual and, to our knowledge, has not been described previously. The appearance of trichilemmal cysts in association with multiple proliferating trichilemmal tumors suggests a common histogenesis of these two neoplasms. The typical presenting features, histologic description, and recommended treatment for these tumors are reviewed. 
4	High NaCl diet enhances arterial baroreceptor reflex in NaCl-sensitive spontaneously hypertensive rats. Previous studies from our laboratory have shown that arterial baroreceptor reflex control of lumbar sympathetic nerve activity is blunted in the NaCl-sensitive spontaneously hypertensive rat (SHR-S) compared with either the NaCl-resistant spontaneously hypertensive rat (SHR-R) or the normotensive Wistar-Kyoto (WKY) rat. In the current study, the effect of dietary NaCl supplementation on arterial baroreceptor reflex control of lumbar sympathetic nerve activity and heart rate was assessed in SHR-S and control SHR-R and WKY rats. Male SHR-S, SHR-R, and WKY rats were fed diets containing either 1% or 8% NaCl beginning at 7 weeks of age and were studied at age 9-10 weeks. Arterial baroreceptor reflex-mediated changes in lumbar sympathetic nerve activity and heart rate were recorded in conscious, unrestrained rats during phenylephrine-induced (15-40 micrograms/kg/min) and nitroprusside-induced (15-300 micrograms/kg/min) changes in mean arterial pressure. SHR-S maintained on a 1% NaCl diet had blunted baroreceptor reflex control of lumbar sympathetic nerve activity during acute increases in MAP compared with SHR-R and WKY rats (p less than 0.05). After ingestion of the 8% NaCl diet, this blunting was absent, indicating enhancement of baroreceptor reflex control of lumbar sympathetic nerve activity. SHR-S maintained on a 1% NaCl diet also had blunted arterial baroreceptor control of lumbar sympathetic nerve activity during nitroprusside-induced decreases in mean arterial pressure compared with WKY rats, but this was not significantly altered during ingestion of the 8% NaCl diet. 
4	Hyponatraemia secondary to an inappropriately high release of antidiuretic hormone in cardiac tamponade. A spontaneous intrapericardial haemorrhage caused cardiac tamponade in a 29 year old paraplegic man who was being treated with warfarin. The associated persistent hyponatraemia, which was believed to be caused by an inappropriately high release of antidiuretic hormone, rapidly resolved after pericardiocentesis. 
4	Valve replacement in patients with endocarditis and cerebral septic emboli. Cerebral septic emboli complicate the cases in 20% to 40% of patients with left-sided endocarditis but the management of these patients who require a valvar operation remains unclear. From 1980 to 1988, the incidence of cerebral septic embolus was 42% (n = 45) among 106 patients with endocarditis who underwent valve replacement at the University of Illinois Hospital in Chicago. Of these 45 patients, 69% (n = 31) had symptomatic cerebral septic infarctions and 31% (n = 14) were asymptomatic. Findings on cerebral computed tomographic scans included ischemic infarcts (n = 36, 80%), hemorrhagic infarcts (n = 5, 11%), normal studies (n = 2, 4%), and unknown (n = 2, 4%). Neurological complications after valve replacement included postoperative strokes (n = 6, 6%), cerebral abscesses (n = 2, 2%), and seizure (n = 1, 1%). The presence of a hemorrhagic infarct preoperatively predisposed to a perioperative stroke (p less than 0.05). In conclusion, cerebral septic infarctions, both symptomatic and asymptomatic, are common among patients with endocarditis referred for valvar operation. In the absence of a hemorrhagic infarct, valve replacement can be performed with minimal risk of a perioperative stroke. 
2	Percutaneous rotational contact biliary lithotripsy: initial clinical results with the Kensey Nash lithotrite. The percutaneous rotary lithotrite introduces a new concept to fragmentation and percutaneous removal of gallstones. A fluid vortex is generated, pulling calculi into a high-speed blade that fragments stones to predominantly under 500 microns. The results of treating the first 10 patients with this instrument reveal that large stone burdens as well as small stones (2-3 mm) of any composition can be removed if the gallbladder is of sufficient size to accommodate the six-pronged basket. Rotation times of 7-39 minutes were required. Nine of 10 procedures were completed; access was lost in one case. One major complication occurred. At repeat oral cholecystography, the gallbladder was visualized after 3-6 weeks in eight of the nine patients. Ursodeoxycholic acid was administered from 3 to 12 months to five patients with either residual stones or aggregates. The hospital stay ranged from 48 to 72 hours. All patients (except the patient who underwent surgery) resumed light activity in 3-4 days and strenuous activity and full diet within 3 weeks. 
2	Pancreatic ischaemia in experimental acute pancreatitis: mechanism, significance and therapy. Much clinical and experimental evidence suggests that pancreatic ischaemia in the early phase of acute pancreatitis is important in the development of pancreatic necrosis. While depletion of intravascular volume has often been assumed to be the main circulatory defect, an additional disturbance of pancreatic microcirculation has been demonstrated experimentally. Possible contributory mechanisms include chemical-induced vasoconstriction, direct injury of vessel wall, intravascular coagulation and increased endothelial permeability resulting in pancreatic oedema, haemoconcentration and impaired venous drainage. Pancreatic ischaemia as a consequence of these local effects seems to be responsible for the transition of mild pancreatitis to parenchymal necrosis. In experimental models the beneficial effect of various drugs and of sympathetic blockade has been ascribed to an improvement in pancreatic perfusion. Although effective volume therapy is generally accepted as the mainstay of conservative treatment in acute pancreatitis, the efficacy of different fluid preparations is still controversial, and simple fluid resuscitation has not been shown to prevent the development of parenchymal necrosis. The specific impairment of pancreatic microcirculation cannot be prevented merely by replenishment of intravascular volume with crystalloids, albumin or plasma despite normalization of macrohaemodynamics. In contrast, partial replacement of blood by dextran preparations has been shown to increase pancreatic perfusion by improving blood fluidity. Isovolaemic haemodilution in conjunction with conventional fluid therapy may provide a new and effective means of protecting the pancreas from secondary injury due to the early ischaemic phase of acute pancreatitis. 
4	Management of mycotic rupture of the ascending aorta after heart-lung transplantation. A 19-year-old woman underwent heart-lung transplantation for obstructive bronchiolitis. Eleven days later mycotic rupture of the ascending aorta occurred. Emergency cardiopulmonary bypass was instituted via the femoral vessels and the chest was reopened under cardiac massage. Perforation of the aorta at the site of insertion of the cardioplegic cannula in the donor aorta was seen. Under circulatory arrest the infected area was excised, a pericardial patch plasty was performed, and the region was covered with a muscle flap. Postoperatively, Candida albicans was found in the excised specimen of the aorta, in drainage fluid, and in the bronchoalveolar lavage. High doses of antimycotics were administered intravenously and for irrigation of the mediastinum, which resulted in an eradication of fungi in all cultures 7 days later. Six weeks after reoperation the patient was discharged home, and she remains well 9 months postoperatively. 
1	Syringomyelia as a postoperative sequela of the resection of a chordoma of the clivus: case report. Syringomyelia has been described frequently in association with various abnormalities of the skull base but rarely with tumors of the skull base. Syringomyelia as a postoperative sequela of surgery of the skull base has not been reported. The authors describe a case of cervical syringomyelia developing after the partial resection of a chordoma and combined conventional and proton beam irradiation. The possible mechanisms causing this abnormality are discussed. 
4	The addition of doxazosin to the treatment regimen of patients with hypertension not adequately controlled by beta-blockers. When doxazosin was given to patients with hypertension not adequately controlled by beta-blockade, blood pressure was normalized in 94% of the 34 patients (blood pressure less than or equal to 140/85 mm Hg). This reduction in blood pressure was obtained with doxazosin in combination with metoprolol or oxprenolol at a mean final daily dose of 1.3 mg or pindolol or atenolol at 2.0 mg/day. Exercise-induced increase in systolic and diastolic blood pressure was also lower with combined beta-blocker and doxazosin therapy than with beta-blocker alone. After 12 weeks of treatment, the combination of doxazosin and beta-blocker significantly reduced total serum cholesterol and triglyceride levels. All side effects were mild and only one patient was withdrawn from therapy. 
4	The yield of cholesterol screening in an urban black community. BACKGROUND: While the distribution of cholesterol levels have been well studied in the general population, little is known about cholesterol and other cardiovascular disease risk factors in screenings held in an urban Black community. This study was designed to determine the yield of cholesterol screening in this community. METHODS: Screening took place in eight community sites. Serum total cholesterol was measured using a rapid capillary technique. Blood pressure was taken according to national guidelines and the average of two to three measurements were used. Standard interviews were used to determine the presence of cardiovascular risk factors by history. RESULTS: Of the 562 individuals screened, 44.9 percent had cholesterol levels requiring referral for follow-up care. Of those with total cholesterol greater than or equal to 6.21 mmol/L, 66.4 percent were previously undetected and more than half also had blood pressure levels greater than or equal to 140/90 mmHg on screening; 45 percent of all participants had blood pressure greater than or equal to 140/90 on screenings. Of those with a history of elevated total cholesterol levels, none had levels below 5.17 mmol/L at the time of screening. CONCLUSIONS: Multiple risk factors are highly prevalent in the urban Black community during cholesterol screening programs. Findings suggest the need for cholesterol programs incorporating blood pressure screening in the urban Black community. 
2	Reevaluation of manometric criteria for vigorous achalasia. Is this a distinct clinical disorder? Clinical and manometric data from 97 consecutive patients with idiopathic achalasia were analyzed to see if a distinct subset with vigorous achalasia could be identified. Statistical analyses failed to detect a unique group of subjects based on the distribution of contraction wave amplitudes alone. Because of this, patients falling above the 95th percentile (N = 4, mean wave amplitude greater than 100 mm Hg for each) were compared with those having mean amplitudes above the conventional threshold for the diagnosis of vigorous achalasia (mean amplitude 60-100 mm Hg, N = 4), and with the remainder (N = 89, mean amplitude less than 60 mm Hg). Subjects with mean amplitudes less than 60 mm Hg and with mean amplitudes 60-100 mm Hg closely resembled each other in all measured clinical features, whereas subjects with mean amplitudes greater than 100 mm Hg were all male, were older (67 +/- 4 years vs 47 +/- 2 years; P less than 0.01), and appeared to have somewhat longer duration of symptoms when compared with the remainder (82 +/- 41 vs 44 +/- 10 months; P = 0.4). Chest pain and other esophageal symptoms, basal and residual lower sphincter pressures, and response to first treatment did not differ among the three groups. These data indicate that high-fidelity manometry techniques identify a rare subset of achalasia patients with mean contraction amplitudes exceeding 100 mm Hg that, although older and possibly with greater duration of symptoms, presents similarly to others with idiopathic achalasia. Outcome from conventional treatment is also similar for the "vigorous" and "nonvigorous" patients, making the distinction of questionable value. 
5	Dysgerminoma of the ovary: review of 27 cases. Twenty-seven patients with pure dysgerminoma were seen at the Tata Memorial Hospital, Bombay, between January 1980 and December 1984. Of the 10 patients in stage I, 2 patients underwent a unilateral salpingoophorectomy (USO) and were kept under observation without any adjuvant therapy, while the remaining patients received adjuvant treatment following surgery. All of the 6 patients in stage II and 4 of 7 in stage III had total abdominal hysterectomy and bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy (TAHBSO) followed by postoperative radiotherapy. One patient presented in stage IV and 3 patients presented with recurrence after previous definitive treatment undertaken at other institutions. The disease free, as well as the overall survival, at 108 months, for the 24 cases primarily treated at this institution, is 81% and 88% respectively, and, for patients in stages I and II, 100% (Kaplan-Meier estimation). The need for controlled clinical trials to devise optimal therapy in the early clinical stages and use of chemotherapy for advanced stages of this highly curable entity are stressed. 
3	Effects of repeated temporary clipping of the middle cerebral artery on pial arterial diameter, regional cerebral blood flow, and brain structure in cats. Temporary clipping of the major arterial trunk is an important maneuver to control excessive unexpected bleeding in neurosurgical operations; however, repeated temporary clipping can give rise to severe neurological deficits after surgery. The present study was performed to confirm and explain these clinical findings. Initially, a single 20-minute or 1-hour occlusion of the middle cerebral artery was performed in each of 5 cats. Pial arterial diameter was determined by video imaging, regional cerebral blood flow was measured by autoradiography, and cerebral edema and infarction were observed. In the 20-minute occlusion group, no abnormal changes were found 5 hours after recirculation. In the 1-hour occlusion group, pial arteries were dilated by 45%, and regional cerebral blood flow increased to more than twice the resting cortical values. The extent of cerebral edema was 41.2 +/- 7.5% (SE) and infarction was 34.5 +/- 9.5% (SE) of the hemisphere. In the second experiment, three 20-minute occlusions of the middle cerebral artery in a 1-hour interval were performed in 20 cats. In 10 of them, thiopental (40 mg/kg) was used to protect the brain. In the group without barbiturate treatment, pial arteries were dilated by 40% at the end of experiment, regional cerebral blood flow decreased to about 70% compared with single 20-minute occlusion, cerebral edema was 19.5 +/- 8.1% (SE), and infarction was 8.1 +/- 3.7% (SE) of the hemisphere. In the treated group, these were only trivial changes. The effect of repeated clipping may cumulatively cause brain damage, and barbiturates should be used whenever repeated clipping is necessary. 
2	Heterotopic liver transplantation for fulminant Wilson's disease. Wilson's disease may present with severe acute hepatocellular failure. The only effective treatment for fulminant Wilson's disease is liver transplantation, which may lead to reversal of the underlying disease. Some patients with cirrhosis who are too ill to undergo orthotopic liver transplantation have been treated with heterotopic liver transplantation. However, use of heterotopic liver transplantation for fulminant hepatocellular failure has not been successful. This case study involves a patient in whom a heterotopic liver transplant was successfully used for treatment of Wilson's disease presenting with fulminant hepatocellular failure. 
1	Introduction of nerve growth factor (NGF) receptors into a medulloblastoma cell line results in expression of high- and low-affinity NGF receptors but not NGF-mediated differentiation. Expression of the cloned human nerve growth factor receptor (NGFR) cDNA in cell lines can generate both high- and low-affinity binding sites. Since the inability to respond appropriately to differentiation factors such as NGF may contribute to determining the malignant phenotype of neuroblastomas, we sought to determine whether the same is true of medulloblastomas. To generate a human central nervous system neuronal cell line that would respond to NGF, we infected the medulloblastoma cell line D283 MED with a defective retrovirus carrying the cDNA coding for the human NGFR. The resultant cells (MED-NGFR) expressed abundant low- and high-affinity NGFRs, and NGF treatment induced a rapid transient increase of c-fos mRNA in the NGFR-expressing cells but not in the parent line or in cells infected with virus lacking the cDNA insert. However, the MED-NGFR cells did not internalize the NGFR at high efficiency, nor did they differentiate in response to NGF. Three important conclusions emerge from this study: (i) internalization of NGFRs is not necessary for some early rapid transcriptional effects of NGF; (ii) an unknown factor(s) that cooperates with the cloned NGFR in allowing high-affinity NGF binding is found in a primitive central nervous system cell line; and (iii) NGFRs introduced into and expressed by D283 MED (i.e., MED-NGFR) cells are partially functional but are unable to induce differentiation in these primitive neuron-like tumor cells, implying that high-efficiency receptor-mediated endocytosis of NGF and its receptor may be a necessary step in the cascade of events leading to NGF-mediated differentiation. 
1	Association of germ cell tumors and Hodgkin's disease. Two patients presented with synchronous Hodgkin's disease and testicular germ cell neoplasms. Both patients are in complete remission following treatment with multidrug chemotherapy and radiation therapy. Despite epidemiologic similarities between Hodgkin's disease and testicular cancer, only 13 cases of their association in the same patient have been reported in the literature, and in all those instances the tumors occurred metachronously. However, the very rare occurrence of synchronous presentation suggests a possible common pathogenetic factor in our 2 patients. 
1	Neurinoma in the cavernous sinus: report of two cases. Two cases of trigeminal neurinoma located solely in the cavernous sinus are reported. Preoperatively, magnetic resonance imaging provided the accurate localization of the lesions, allowing precise planning of the surgical approach, that is, a subtemporal lateral approach and a pterional superior approach, respectively. The neurinomas inside the cavernous sinus were removed successfully, and the patients developed no new neurological deficits except for anesthesia in the 1st division of the trigeminal nerve. The characteristic magnetic resonance imaging findings of trigeminal neurinoma in the cavernous sinus are presented, and the different surgical approaches are discussed. 
1	The cytobrush for evaluating routine cervicovaginal-endocervical smears. While the conventional wooden spatula/cotton-tipped applicator has remained the method of obtaining Papanicolaou smears for most clinicians at the University of California at Los Angeles, the Student Health Service (SHS) adopted the Zelsmyr cytobrush as its sole method of obtaining cervical samples in late 1986. A study was done to define changes in both the adequacy of sampling and the detection rate for both squamous and glandular epithelial abnormalities with the cytobrush. To accomplish this goal, 1,000 cytobrush and 244 conventionally obtained smears were analyzed prospectively, and 3,864 SHS samples obtained in 1986 prior to the change in method were reviewed retrospectively. As compared to cervical samples obtained by conventional methods, the cytobrush smears contained significantly more endocervical cells and had fewer drying artifacts. Both methods obtained equivalent squamous samples and had similar final class distributions. No case of endocervical adenocarcinoma carcinoma in situ or invasive adenocarcinoma was detected. SHS patients who had initial "no endocervical cells" samples but whose repeat sample did contain endocervical cells retained the same class in more than 75% of cases. This study confirmed that the cytobrush technique produces Papanicolaou smears with improved sampling of the squamocolumnar junction but questioned whether that results in an increased detection rate for cervical pathology. 
2	Restoration of liver function in Gunn rats without immunosuppression using transplanted microencapsulated hepatocytes. Microencapsulation of cells within synthetic semipermeable membranes is a novel technique that enables the transplantation of cell cultures without the need for immunosuppression. We have previously shown that transplanted isolated encapsulated hepatocytes can provide sufficient short-term metabolic support to improve the survival of animals with galactosamine-induced fulminant hepatic failure. Here we have demonstrated the feasibility of isolated encapsulated hepatocyte transplantation in providing long-term metabolic liver support in Gunn rats. Gunn rats have a congenital inability to conjugate bilirubin and thus exhibit lifelong hyperbilirubinemia. We studied the feasibility of isolated encapsulated hepatocyte transplantation in restoring this specific liver function. Free hepatocytes, isolated from male Wistar rats, were microencapsulated with collagen within a trilayered sodium alginate-poly-L-lysine-sodium alginate membrane using techniques developed in our laboratory. A total of 45 Gunn rats underwent intraperitoneal transplantation with free hepatocytes (5 x 10(7], isolated encapsulated hepatocytes (5 x 10(7], control (empty) microcapsules or no transplant (untreated controls). Serum bilirubin levels were monitored daily for 10 days after transplantation, and subsequent weekly samples were obtained for up to 1 mo. Microcapsules were studied by light and electron microscopy 1 mo after transplantation. During the first week after transplantation, the mean maximum reduction in serum bilirubin levels for the isolated encapsulated hepatocytes, free hepatocytes and control microcapsule transplanted groups was 45.7%, 18.6% and 14.3%, respectively. For up to 1 mo thereafter the mean reduction in serum bilirubin levels in these respective groups was 34.8%, 13.5% and 3.3%. 
5	"Prokinetic" treatment of constipation-predominant irritable bowel syndrome: a placebo-controlled study of cisapride. The effects of prokinetic treatment with cisapride in patients with constipation-predominant irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) were evaluated in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study. Sixty-nine IBS patients were assigned to a 12-week treatment with either 5 mg cisapride or placebo t.i.d.; this dosage could be changed if necessary. The mean weekly number of days on which a stool was passed in the cisapride and placebo group increased to 5.3 and 4.4 (p less than 0.05) during weeks 8-12 of treatment, and the number of days with stools of normal consistency increased to 3.5 and 1.9 (p less than 0.05), respectively. At week 12, the reduction in severity and frequency scores for abdominal pain was significantly greater (p less than or equal to 0.05) in the cisapride group (60 and 61%) than in the placebo group (40 and 32%), as it was for abdominal distension (p less than 0.05). Cisapride tended to be better than placebo in diminishing flatulence. In 71% versus 39% of the patients the overall rating for the response to treatment was good or excellent at week 12. Cisapride was well tolerated. These results suggest that the drug will be useful for the management of constipation-predominant IBS. 
1	Evaluation of argon laser surgery in children under 13 years of age. Argon laser surgery is an effective treatment for ectasias and congenital port-wine stains; however, its use in children under the age of 13 is controversial. This paper reviews 202 children under the age of 13 who underwent argon laser treatments for congenital port-wine stains, spider angiomas, epidermal nevi, and lentigines. The clinical characteristics of port-wine stains in 170 children are discussed. Good to excellent results (moderate to complete clearing) in port-wine stains were obtained in 60 percent of patients and seemed to correlate best with lack of blanchability on pressure. Hypertrophic scarring was seen in only 7 children, all of whom had undressed wounds; no significant scarring has been seen in any subsequent child who had maintained a dressed wound postoperatively. 
4	Vascular flow capacity of hindlimb skeletal muscles in spontaneously hypertensive rats. Total and regional skeletal muscle flows (radiolabeled microspheres) were determined in isolated maximally vasodilated hindquarters of spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) and age-matched (11-12 mo) normotensive Wistar-Kyoto rats (WKY) to assess the vascular flow capacity of the skeletal muscle vascular beds. Vascular flow capacity was estimated by measuring total hindquarters and regional muscle blood flows (under conditions of maximal vasodilation with papaverine or papaverine plus isoproterenol) over a wide range of perfusion pressures in WKY and SHR. Capillary exchange capacity was estimated by determining the capillary filtration coefficient. Isogravimetric capillary pressures and segmental vascular resistances were determined in each hindquarter. Isogravimetric flows and capillary pressures were not different between WKY and SHR. However, total and precapillary vascular resistances were significantly elevated in SHR, and postcapillary resistances were not different compared with WKY. Maximal capillary filtration coefficient values for the SHR group averaged 20% lower than WKY values, suggesting that hypertension was associated with a reduction in the microvascular surface area available for fluid exchange and, therefore, the capillary exchange capacity. Over the perfusion pressures studied, total hindquarters flows averaged 60% lower in SHR than in WKY. Flows to individual skeletal muscles averaged 76% lower in SHR than in WKY regardless of the muscle fiber type. Thus, modifications exist in the hindlimb skeletal muscle vasculature of SHR that reduces the capillary exchange capacity and limit the capacity of deliver flow at a given perfusion pressure gradient. 
5	The effect of prolonged hypothermia on cardiac function in a young patient with accidental hypothermia. A 20-year-old man had accidental, prolonged, and severe hypothermia. Serial radionuclide ventriculography disclosed reduced myocardial contractility during hypothermia that resolved after warming. The effects of hypothermia on cardiac function are discussed. 
5	Efficacy of nimodipine in cerebral ischemia or hemorrhage. Our studies showed that in an appropriate dose, nimodipine increased local cerebral blood flow with no corresponding increase in local metabolism. Nimodipine treatment given before experimental ischemic insult, resulting from either vascular occlusion or intracranial hemorrhage or after subarachnoid hemorrhage, maintained or improved blood flow and minimized the severity of subsequent brain damage. Lack of benefit from nimodipine treatment after the insult may occur because the inexorable progression of events leading to ischemic neuronal damage, once initiated, cannot be arrested. On the other hand, pharmacokinetic factors may be important, and post-treatment efficacy may depend on administration protocols that achieve an adequate concentration in ischemic tissue sufficiently soon after an insult. Our findings are compatible with the benefit of nimodipine being due to an improvement in blood flow that reduces the severity of ischemia. However, they do not exclude the possibility that treatment may minimize the accumulation of calcium in damaged cells as a result of "cytoprotective" effects. 
1	Recurrence of acoustic neurilemoma as a malignant spindle-cell neoplasm. Case report. A 75-year-old man presented with a right cerebellopontine angle tumor 11 months after complete macroscopic resection of a right acoustic neurilemoma. Histological examination of the recurrent tumor showed a malignant spindle-cell neoplasm with positive staining for S-100 protein. The patient had no stigmata of von Recklinghausen's disease. It is proposed that this recurrence represents progression from a benign to a malignant acoustic nerve-sheath tumor, an event that is extremely rare outside the clinicopathological context of neurofibromatosis. 
3	Cerebral atrophy in habitual cocaine abusers: a planimetric CT study. We compared cranial CTs of 35 habitual cocaine abusers, 16 self-reported 1st-time users, and 54 headache patients using linear planimetric measures. All patients met the following criteria: age 20 to 40 years, no polydrug abuse (including alcohol), HIV seronegativity, normal albumin level, and no history of any other neurologic disease. The sex ratios and ages were not significantly different in the 3 groups. The planimetric measurements and calculated indices of cerebral atrophy were significantly different in the habitual cocaine abusers compared with the 2 other groups of patients. There were no differences between 1st-time cocaine users and controls. Among the habitual cocaine abusers there was a positive correlation between the approximate duration of cocaine abuse and the calculated atrophy indices. The findings suggest that cerebral atrophy develops in chronic cocaine abusers, and the severity correlates with the duration of abuse. 
2	Pneumococcal pneumonia in a rat model of cirrhosis: effects of cirrhosis on pulmonary defense mechanisms against Streptococcus pneumoniae. To study alterations in host defense mechanisms that enhance pneumococcal virulence, a model of Streptococcus pneumoniae pneumonia was developed in cirrhotic rats. Cirrhosis, with or without ascites, was produced in rats by intragastric administration of carbon tetrachloride (CCl4). Histopathologic and laboratory studies demonstrated that CCl4-induced cirrhosis was similar to alcoholic cirrhosis in humans. Cirrhotic rats were more susceptible to type 3 pneumococcal pneumonia induced by intratracheal challenge than controls, and the presence of ascites was associated with the lowest LD50. More cirrhotic rats with ascites had bacteremia and elevated levels of circulating capsular antigen after challenge compared with cirrhotic rats without ascites or controls. Pulmonary clearance of pneumococci was markedly reduced in rats with cirrhosis and ascites and was associated with reduced serum complement levels. This model may be useful in further studies of the pathogenesis and therapy of pneumococcal infections in the compromised host. 
1	Effect of microwave and ionizing radiation in patients with recurrent laryngeal carcinoma. This study describes the treatment and survival of 54 patients with gross recurrent laryngeal carcinoma after radiotherapy. Twenty-six patients were treated with local ultra-high frequency hyperthermia in combination with radiotherapy and chemotherapy (HRCH). Twenty-eight control patients were treated with radiotherapy and chemotherapy (RCh). Eight patients (33 per cent) in HRCh showed a three year survival but no patient in the RCh group. At two years 18 patients (75 per cent) in HRCh and two (7 per cent) in RCh survived. 
3	An epithelial cyst in the cerebellopontine angle. Case report. A case of a benign epithelial cyst in the posterior cranial fossa is described. It had the unique histological feature of a double-layered cuboidal epithelial lining. Detailed immunohistochemical and electron microscopic studies supported an endodermal origin. The differential diagnosis and the histogenesis of epithelial cysts in the central nervous system are discussed. 
5	A randomized controlled trial of allopurinol in coronary bypass surgery. A plethora of experimental evidence indicates that allopurinol reduces the formation of cytotoxic free radicals during myocardial ischemia and reperfusion. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effect of allopurinol on cardiac performance and early mortality after coronary bypass surgery. Allopurinol (n = 89) or placebo (n = 80) was administered to 169 patients before surgery. Randomization produced groups evenly matched for surgical risk factors. Hospital mortality rate in the placebo group was 14 of 80 (18%) in the allopurinol group 4 of 89 (4%), p = 0.014. Cardiac performance, scored by cardiac index and the need for ionotropic or mechanical support, was significantly better in the allopurinol group. More nonfatal complications occurred in the allopurinol group. When either a complication or death is termed an event, the proportion of events was equal in the two groups. No side effects were identified. We now administer allopurinol to all patients who are undergoing bypass surgery unless specifically contraindicated. 
4	Correction of subclavian artery stenosis by percutaneous angioplasty. Subclavian artery stenosis is an infrequently recognized cause of left-sided chest and arm pain that can mimic the signs and symptoms of angina pectoris. In addition, more proximal subclavian artery stenoses can be associated with cerebrovascular symptoms in the "subclavian steal syndrome." This article reviews the clinical experience in four patients who presented with different manifestations of subclavian artery stenosis and who were all successfully treated by percutaneous angioplasty. Their clinical presentation, angiographic findings, and post-angioplasty results are documented. In conclusion, it is felt that nonsurgical correction of critical subclavian artery stenosis, using current angioplasty techniques, is the preferred method of treatment. 
5	Endogenous insulin-like growth factor (IGF) binding proteins cause IGF-1 resistance in cultured fibroblasts from a patient with short stature. The ED50 of insulin-like growth factor (IGF)-I-stimulated alpha-aminoisobutyric acid (AIB) uptake (mean +/- SD) in cultured fibroblasts from a child with short stature that we have reported (1.40 +/- 0.24 nM), is significantly higher than the ED50 of IGF-I-stimulated AIB uptake in fibroblasts from 11 normal subjects (0.42 +/- 0.12 nM) and from 127 short children (0.35 +/- 0.11 nM). Similarly, the ED50 of IGF-I-stimulated thymidine incorporation in fibroblasts from this child is 2.8 times higher than that in fibroblasts from four normal subjects. To minimize potential modulation of IGF-I action by endogenous IGF binding proteins in these assays, fibroblast responsiveness to [Q3,A4,Y15,L16]IGF-I, an IGF-I variant that has a 600-fold reduced affinity for serum IGF binding proteins, has been examined. The biological activity of this variant is comparable in the patient's and normal fibroblasts, suggesting that the resistance to IGF-I action cannot be attributed to a defective IGF-I receptor. To investigate directly the possibility that IGF-I sensitivity in the patient's fibroblasts is reduced by endogenous IGF binding proteins (IGFBP), binding proteins that are secreted into AIB assay buffer during a 3-h collection and that are cell-associated at the end of the collection have been analyzed. Ligand blot analysis of conditioned AIB assay buffer demonstrates that fibroblasts from the patient secrete 1.3-2.2 times more of Mr 46,400/42,900, 32,000, and 26,800 binding proteins than normal fibroblasts. The major difference between fibroblasts from the patient and from normal subjects is a striking 10-fold increase in the amount of a cell surface Mr 32,000 binding protein in the patient's fibroblasts. The Mr 32,000 binding protein is similar in size to IGFB-1 and different from IGFBP-2 and IGFBP-3, but it does not cross-react with an antibody against IGFBP-1. We conclude that the resistance to IGF-I action in the patient's fibroblasts is caused by an abnormal production and/or cell association of IGF binding proteins. 
3	The Hastings bipolar hemiarthroplasty for subcapital fractures of the femoral neck. A 10-year prospective study. In a 10-year prospective study, 561 displaced subcapital fractures of the femoral neck in 546 patients were treated with the Hastings bipolar hemiarthroplasty. Within six months of their operations, 148 patients had died. In 322 hips followed up, 243 with adequate serial radiographs separated by more than one year, only 14 (5.6%) showed acetabular erosion. A group of 91 had been reviewed for between three and nine years (mean, 4 years 10 months) and of these, 95% had no pain or slight pain only. Comparison with an earlier series of conventional hemiarthroplasties reported from this institution showed that the clinical results were similar, but that the erosion rate had been halved. 
1	Shortcut method to calculate the sample size in trials of screening for chronic disease. One of the first questions arising in the planning of a randomized trial to evaluate mortality reduction by screening concerns the sample size of the trial required to detect an expected mortality reduction in the study group for given significance level alpha, and power 1 - beta. If estimates exist of the underlying average annual incidence rate of the disease ra and the annual mortality rate delta a or survival data for patients in the population under consideration before screening started, then a simple formula for the probability of dying from the disease within T years after entry into the trial can be given for the control group. Standard formulas may then be used for sample size calculations in randomized trials, which compare the risk of death from the disease in the control and the study group accrued at T years after entry. A simple correction for loss of follow-up, due to mortality from other causes or, for instance, migration is possible. 
5	Sudden death from acute cocaine intoxication in Virginia in 1988. A review of medical examiners' autopsy records revealed that in 1988, 33 residents of Virginia died of acute cocaine intoxication. The subjects were 19 to 45 years old; most were men, used cocaine intravenously, and used other toxic substances with the lethal dose of cocaine. 
3	Help for the hurting elderly. Safe use of drugs to relieve pain. Pharmacologic management of pain in elderly patients is a common and difficult clinical problem. Because of altered drug metabolism and pharmacodynamics in the elderly, the drugs of choice are different than in younger patients and side effects occur more often. However, with judicious use and monitoring for toxicity, oral medications given as part of a multimodality approach can achieve adequate analgesia in most elderly patients. 
5	Acute urinary retention in a child with appendiceal abscess: diagnostic dilemma. Rarely do children with appendiceal abscess present with acute urinary retention as the only sign or symptom. This presentation may delay diagnosis and definitive therapy, thereby causing additional morbidity and possible mortality. We report the eighth case of acute urinary retention in a child associated with an appendiceal abscess. 
1	Primary cysts and tumors of the mediastinum. A retrospective analysis was performed on 230 patients with primary cysts and tumors of the mediastinum seen at our institution from January 1944 to April 1989. We divided these patients into two groups. Group 1 was seen before 1970 and group 2 was seen from January 1970 to April 1989. There was a significant increase in the prevalence of malignancy in group 2 (47.2% versus 17.1%; p less than 0.0001) due to an increase in the number of lymphomas (22.6% versus 3.5%; p less than 0.001) and malignant neurogenic tumors (6.8% versus 1.1%; p = 0.0528). There was a significant increase in the number of malignant tumors in the anterior (59.5% versus 30.9%; p = 0.0022) and paravertebral (28.5% versus 2.8%; p = 0.0027) compartments in group 2. More patients with these tumors were symptomatic in group 2 (63.6% versus 5%; p = 0.0422). There was an increase of ancillary diagnostic studies performed to evaluate these tumors (76.0% versus 34.5%; p = 0.0422). Logistic regression analysis identified date of presentation (p less than 0.005), symptoms (p less than 0.01), size (p less than 0.005), and the anterior mediastinal compartment (p less than 0.005) as preoperative predictors of malignancy. The surgical approach to these tumors included more median sternotomy (30.1% versus 10.7%; p = 0.0008), anterior mediastinotomy, and cervical mediastinoscopy in group 2 (1.1% versus 17.5%; p = 0.0002). Long-term results support surgical resection in benign lesions and an aggressive multimodality approach to malignant lesions. 
4	Sudden death and sleeping history among Finnish men. An autopsy was performed in 460 consecutive cases of sudden death among 35- to 76-year-old men. The closest cohabiting individual known to each decreased subject was interviewed. Snoring history was obtained in 321 of the 371 interviews. In 86 cases there was a history of 'habitual' (almost always or always) snoring, and 88 men snored 'often'. The mean age of subjects was 55.4 years. The mean body mass index (BMI) was 26.3 kg m-2. Among the obese snorers (n = 82), apnoeas had been observed 'occasionally', 'often', or 'habitually' in 49 cases. Death was classified as cardiovascular in 186 (40.4%) cases. Cardiovascular cause of death was more common among those who snored habitually or often than among those who snored occasionally or never (P less than 0.05). 'Habitual' snorers died more often while sleeping (P less than 0.05). Habitual snoring was found to be a risk factor for morning death (P less than 0.01). The possibility of obstructive sleep apnoea as a cause of sudden death should at least be considered if the decreased is known to have been a habitual snorer. 
4	False aneurysm of the internal mammary artery. Iatrogenic false aneurysm of a branch of the internal mammary artery after sternal wire closure is a very rare occurrence. We describe a case which appeared in a 62 year old woman operated upon for mitral valve replacement and diagnosed after Digital Subtraction Angiography. 
5	Spinal cord injury after subclavian flap aortoplasty. An experimental study in piglets. Paraplegia is a rare but much feared complication of corrective surgery for coarctation of the aorta. The problem was studied in 31 newborn pigs submitted to subclavian flap aortoplasty. The aortic cross-clamping time ranged from 9-25 min. Twenty-three piglets with clamping times 9-18 min were neurologically intact, whereas eight with aortic clamping for 18-25 min became paraplegic. The clinical implications for newborn children with symptomatic aortic coarctation are discussed with regard to these experimental findings. 
4	Use of a guiding catheter for contralateral femoral artery angioplasty. We describe a unique method employing a transseptal sheath as a "guiding catheter" that allows contralateral retrograde femoral artery access to perform balloon angioplasty of proximal superficial femoral artery lesions. This technique simplifies arterial access, provides support for crossing lesions, and allows angiographic visualization of target lesions during the procedure. 
5	Neurologic complications of the tryptophan-associated eosinophilia-myalgia syndrome. A case of tryptophan-associated eosinophilia, central nervous system complications, and multiple white matter lesions by magnetic resonance imaging is presented. Eosinophilia regardless of its cause should be included within the differential of patients exhibiting periventricular white matter lesions. 
5	Medical management of acute traumatic rupture of the aorta. Surgical reconstruction is the treatment for acute traumatic aortic rupture and should be accomplished immediately in most patients. In patients in whom concomitant injuries or the development of life-threatening complications preclude safe and successful aortic reconstruction, pharmacological intervention to reduce the risk of free aortic rupture may be considered. Surgical reconstruction can then be more safely performed under controlled elective circumstances. 
4	Improved morphologic characterization of atrial septal aneurysm by transesophageal echocardiography: relation to cerebrovascular events. Transthoracic and transesophageal echocardiography was performed in 23 consecutive adult patients with an atrial septal aneurysm. In three patients with a cerebrovascular event the diagnosis was established by the transesophageal approach only. Interatrial shunting on transthoracic imaging with use of echocardiographic contrast imaging or Doppler color mapping, or both, was detected in 7 (41%) of 17 patients. On performing contrast imaging in combination with color flow mapping during transesophageal echocardiography, positive shunting was demonstrated in 15 (83%) of 18 patients. Echocardiographic identification of multiple fenestrations (n = 4) and thrombus within the aneurysm (n = 2) could be achieved for the first time by transesophageal ultrasound application. Cerebrovascular events occurred in 12 (52%) of 23 patients and were regarded as being definitely thromboembolic in 10 (43%); 8 (67%) of the 12 patients had repeated cerebral events. Except for mitral valve prolapse in one patient, no other potential cardiac source of embolism could be identified despite the use of transesophageal echocardiography. A thickening of the aneurysmal membrane greater than or equal to 5 mm was found in 9 (75%) of 12 patients with versus 3 (27%) of 11 patients without a cerebrovascular event (p less than 0.05); this proved to be the only significant difference between the two patient groups. The mechanism of embolization may be both primary thrombus formation within the aneurysm and paradoxic embolization through an interatrial communication as demonstrated by the findings in two patients. It is concluded that atrial septal aneurysm is a cardiac abnormality with thromboembolic potential. In patients with this lesion and a history of an embolic event, long-term anticoagulant therapy is indicated. 
3	A randomized, controlled trial of the use of music during laceration repair. STUDY OBJECTIVES: To determine whether music significantly reduces the pain and anxiety associated with laceration repair in the emergency department. PARTICIPANTS AND SETTING: Adult patients presenting to the ED at an urban teaching hospital for laceration repair. Exclusion criteria included patients less than 18 years old, having received analgesics, with suspected alcohol or substance intoxication, and in whom laceration repair was complicated by treatment of a more serious medical condition. DESIGN AND INTERVENTIONS: This was a randomized, controlled trial. After giving informed consent, patients were randomly assigned to receive standard laceration repair without music (control) or standard laceration repair with music. Patients assigned to the music group chose an audio tape from 50 available styles and artists. Patients received the music through a headset, and they controlled the volume. Intradermal lidocaine was used in all patients. Data were collected on heart rate, blood pressure, and respirations just before and immediately after wound repair. Psychological variables included the state subscale of the Spielberger State Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI), a visual analog pain scale rating, and a brief questionnaire. STAI and pain scale ratings were analyzed with Wilcoxon's rank-sum test with an alpha error of .05. RESULTS: Thirty-eight patients (19 per group) completed the protocol. Pain scores were significantly (P less than .05) lower in the music group (mean, 2.09) than in controls (mean, 3.31). Anxiety after the procedure was reduced in both groups, but STAI reduction scores were not significantly different between groups (music, 17.7; control, 18.5). Seventeen of 19 patients (89%) rated music "very beneficial," and 100% said they would use music again. CONCLUSION: Music provides a safe, inexpensive, and effective adjunct for the management of pain in the ED but does not significantly affect anxiety. 
5	Ototoxicity of cis-platinum and its relationship to eye colour. The following hypothesis is presented: that the susceptibility of an individual patient to hearing loss as a result of cis-platinum administration can be predicted on the basis of eye colour. The rationale is that the melanin content of the inner ears is related to that of the eyes; dark eyes contain more melanin than light-coloured eyes; and melanin causes the accumulation of the ototoxic drug within the inner ear. Hence those with dark eyes will suffer greater damage to the hearing than those with pale eyes. An investigation that confirmed this hypothesis is reported. In addition to cochlear damage there is a significant likelihood of damage to the auditory nerve as a result of the treatment. 
4	Coronary dynamics and mental arithmetic stress in humans. Incidence and mechanisms of psychological stress-induced myocardial ischemia were investigated in a population of 63 patients using mental arithmetic. Fifty subjects (group 1) were selected as a consecutive population of ischemic patients with electrocardiographic documentation of ischemia at rest, on effort, or both. Mental arithmetic induced increases in heart rate, blood pressure, and rate-pressure product in all patients. Transient ischemic electrocardiographic changes occurred in 22 patients (44%; positive mental arithmetic), the majority of whom had both resting and exercise angina. In negative mental arithmetic tests, peak rate-pressure product was always lower than that achieved during exercise (mean +/- SD, 11.9 +/- 3 versus 21.3 +/- 5, p less than 0.01). Of the 22 patients with positive mental arithmetic tests, ischemia occurred in only six, at a rate-pressure product equal to or more than the one achieved during exercise (21.1 +/- 5 versus 19.4 +/- 4, p less than 0.01), suggesting an increase in myocardial O2 demand exceeding the limited increase in flow; in the remaining 16 patients, rate-pressure product values were significantly lower (14.8 +/- 3 versus 22.7 +/- 6, p less than 0.01), suggesting a primary reduction in coronary blood flow that is probably related to an increase in coronary tone. To assess the possible site of such a vasoconstriction, the effect of mental arithmetic on large coronary artery diameter was tested in 13 additional unselected patients (group 2) undergoing coronary angiography for a chest pain syndrome. 
5	A pilot study of suramin in the treatment of metastatic renal cell carcinoma. Suramin sodium is an aromatic polysulfonated compound that was originally introduced as an antiparasitic agent in the 1920s. Recently, in view of its ability to bind and disrupt the function of multiple growth factors and cellular enzyme systems, the authors have been evaluating the role of suramin as an antitumor agent. In this study, 12 patients with metastatic renal cell carcinoma received parenteral suramin by continuous infusion to a peak plasma suramin level greater than 200 micrograms/ml. No objective radiographic responses were observed, although greater than 90% necrosis of multiple tumor sites was documented at autopsy in one patient and normalization of tumor-related hypercalcemia occurred in another patient. Two patients had stable disease of 10 and 28 weeks' duration, respectively. Significant toxicities included hypotension related to sepsis and resulting in renal insufficiency (one patient), development of liver function abnormalities (one patient) marked thrombocytopenia (one patient), prothrombin time prolongation (all patients), vortex keratopathy (two patients), and Grade 1 sensory neuropathy (two patients). On the basis of the current results, suramin does not appear to be an active single agent against metastatic renal cell carcinoma when administered by this dosing schedule. 
1	Prediagnostic serum levels of carotenoids and vitamin E as related to subsequent cancer in Washington County, Maryland. In 1974 and 1975, serum specimens were collected from 25,802 volunteers in Washington County, Maryland. The serum was kept frozen at -73 degrees C until the time of assay. Prediagnostic samples from 436 cancer cases and 765 matched control subjects have been assayed. Nine sites have been studied: colon, rectum, pancreas, lung, melanoma, basal cell of skin, breast, prostate, and bladder. Serum beta-carotene levels showed a strong protective association with lung cancer, suggestive protective associations with melanoma and bladder cancer, and a suggestive but nonprotective association with rectal cancer. Serum vitamin E levels had a protective association with lung cancer; none of the other sites showed impressive associations. Low levels of serum lycopene were strongly associated with pancreatic cancer and less strongly associated with cancer of the bladder and rectum. 
3	An implantable neurocybernetic prosthesis system. The neurocybernetic prosthesis (Cyberonics, Inc.) is an implantable, multiprogrammable pulse generator that delivers constant current electrical signals to the vagus nerve for the purpose of reducing the frequency and/or severity of epileptic seizures. The device is implanted in a subcutaneous chest pocket just below the clavicle, similar to cardiac pacemaker placement. The stimulation signal is transmitted from the prosthesis to the vagus nerve through a stimulation lead. The prosthesis can be programmed using any IBM-compatible personal computer with programming software and a programming wand. The electrodes used in the first group of patients were found to break at an unacceptable rate. Design modifications appear to have resolved this problem. 
1	The transoral approach for the management of intradural lesions at the craniovertebral junction: review of 7 cases. The main difficulty in dealing with intradural lesions located ventrally in the region of the craniovertebral junction (CVJ) is related to their relative inaccessibility. Posterolateral approaches involve some manipulation of the brain stem and provide limited access because of the necessity of working between the cranial nerves. Even then, the view of the ventral midline and across is limited. The transoral approach, which has been widely used for the management of extradural lesions in this area, is also useful for the treatment of intradural lesions. It provides an unimpeded although somewhat restricted, view of the ventral aspect of the CVJ without the need for brain retraction. The cranial nerves and vertebral arteries are not interposed between the surgeon and the lesion. The risks of cerebrospinal fluid leakage and infection are greatly diminished by the use of fibrin adhesive and prolonged diversion of the cerebrospinal fluid. The use of this approach, together with its technical difficulties and results, in the management of seven purely intradural lesions located ventrally at the CVJ, is discussed. 
1	When is a prognostic factor useful? A guide for the perplexed. Traditionally, a number of variables have been used to predict outcome in patients with early-stage breast cancer. These tests are simple to perform and relatively inexpensive. Recently, a number of new factors, eg, tumor proliferative index, nuclear DNA content, and amplification or overexpression of growth-promoting genes or oncogenes have been identified as potential predictors of outcome in patients with breast cancer. There is now increasing pressure to introduce such tests into routine clinical practice. How does a clinical practitioner identify which test, or group of tests, best predicts adverse outcome and whether any more clinically useful information is provided than with the use of more traditional factors alone? The aim of a prognostic test in breast cancer is to predict which patients are destined to develop a recurrence of cancer and those who are not. The prognostic usefulness of a test can be expressed in terms of relative risk (RR), which is the ratio of the risk of breast cancer recurrence in patients who test positive to the risk in those who test negative. Methodologic guidelines that should be satisfied by a study evaluating the predictive ability of a test include the following: (1) Was an inception cohort assembled? (2) Was the referral pattern described? (3) Were laboratory and clinical outcomes assessed in a blinded fashion? (4) Was complete follow-up achieved? (5) Was adjustment for extraneous prognostic factors carried out? (6) Were appropriate statistical methods used? An approach is suggested to help the clinician choose the test, or combination of tests, likely to discriminate between "high-" and "low-risk" patients in his/her own practice. The decision regarding what particular threshold value (risk) defined by a prognostic test (or series of tests) warrants adjuvant therapy for an individual patient is a complex one but should be based on a clear presentation of the risks and benefits to the patient. 
4	Voltage criteria of left ventricular hypertrophy in sudden and nonsudden coronary artery disease mortality: the Italian section of the Seven Countries Study. It is unclear whether sudden or nonsudden death can be predicted independently from other risk factors for coronary artery disease (CAD). Therefore, this investigation was undertaken to measure 12-lead QRS voltage sum, a recently proposed (Am J Cardiol 1985;55:485-494) index of left ventricular (LV) hypertrophy, and its ability to predict either subsequent sudden (less than 2 hours) or nonsudden CAD death during 20 to 23 years of follow-up in 1,588 middle aged men (40 to 61 years old) from 2 cohorts of the Italian section of the Seven Countries Study who were free of demonstrable CAD (at entry examination in 1962). The Sokolow-Lyon and the modified Sokolow-Lyon indexes, 2 standard electrocardiographic methods to detect LV hypertrophy were also measured and compared. During follow-up, 67 patients died suddenly and 87 died a nonsudden CAD death. In the Cox proportional-hazards model, age, mean blood pressure, heart rate, body mass index, cholesterol, physical activity, smoking habit, ST-T alterations (Minnesota codes 4.1 to 4.3 together with 5.1 to 5.3) and the 3 electrocardiographic indexes, all measured at the time of enrollment into the study, were included. The 12-lead QRS voltage sum retained significant and independent relation to sudden death (t = 2.00); Sokolow-Lyon index entered the Cox solution for nonsudden CAD death but the association was inverse (t = -2.10). ST-T alterations were significantly associated only with nonsudden CAD death (t = 2.19). Thus, in addition to several known risk factors, measurement of 12-lead QRS voltage sum in middle-aged men without clinical evidence of heart disease may help identify subjects at an increased risk of sudden death; nonsudden CAD death is predicted by Sokolow-Lyon index and by ST-T alterations. The usefulness of these indexes needs to be tested in different populations. 
5	Left recurrent laryngeal nerve paralysis: an unusual presentation of histoplasmosis. A case of histoplasmosis seen as left recurrent laryngeal nerve paralysis in a 49-year-old man is described. The patient had roentgenographic findings of a solitary, noncalcified left upper lobe mass and mediastinal adenopathy. Tissue diagnosis of histoplasmosis was obtained using a thoracotomy, allowing institution of appropriate treatment. 
1	Interferon activation of latent natural killer cells and alteration in kinetics of target cell lysis: clinical implications for oral precancerous lesions. Reduced natural killer cell activity was observed in patients with oral leukoplakia and submucous fibrosis compared with normal control subjects. However, the number of target binding lymphocytes was found to be normal in these precancers. Treatment of effector cells with interferon-alpha resulted in highly elevated active killer cell activity, although no change was observed in target binding lymphocyte counts. This finding could imply that precytotoxic cells that are activated by interferon exist in peripheral blood or that direct recruitment of a new cell population takes place. In addition, altered target lysis kinetics was observed, with interferon-activated killer cells demonstrating a tremendous lytic activation that is completed so quickly that a statistical kinetic analysis could not be accurately done. Because natural killer cell activity is an important effector system in immunosurveillance against tumors, its modulation with interferon may be an exciting clinical possibility in the control of malignant transformation or oral precancers. 
5	Benign thyroid hyperplasia presenting as bilateral vocal cord paralysis. Complete remission following surgery. A 52-year-old woman developed respiratory arrest on two separate occasions that required mechanical ventilation. Fiberoptic bronchoscopy demonstrated bilateral vocal cord paralysis, and a CT scan of the neck demonstrated a right neck mass. On surgical exploration, the mass was found extending from the thyroid gland and was identified as benign thyroid tissue. Thyroid hyperplasia should be considered in the differential diagnosis of bilateral vocal cord paralysis. 
4	Diagnosing Staphylococcus aureus endocarditis by detecting antibodies against S. aureus capsular polysaccharide types 5 and 8. Consecutive serum samples from patients with Staphylococcus aureus endocarditis or septicemia or non-S. aureus endocarditis and febrile nonsepticemic controls were tested for antibodies against S. aureus capsular polysaccharide (CP) types 5 and 8 by ELISA. The upper normal antibody levels were defined as the upper 99.5% confidence limits of the values from the febrile controls. All available patient isolates were tested for the presence of CP type 5 or 8 (85% of the isolates expressed either serotype), and all five patients with S. aureus endocarditis had positive antibody levels against the corresponding serotype within the first 10 days of infection. Three other endocarditis patients lacked isolates for CP testing but two of these were positive. Positive antibody levels were found in 0 of 28 septicemia patients, in 1 of 12 non-S. aureus endocarditis patients, and in 3 of 37 febrile controls. Thus, testing for anti-CP 5 or 8 antibodies, especially together with CP serotyping of the patient's isolate, seems to provide important information in the differential diagnosis of endocarditis in patients with S. aureus septicemia. 
3	The VER as a diagnostic marker for childhood abdominal migraine. Abdominal migraine is a common childhood migraine equivalent, for which diagnostic criteria have not been defined. As in other children with migraine equivalents this leads to difficulties in diagnosis and determination of prevalence. By recording the fast wave activity (beta rhythmn) in the visual evoked response (VER) to red and white flash, the pattern stimulation, 27 out of 28 children with clinically diagnosed abdominal migraine revealed significant differences compared with normal controls, outside the attack phase. Comparisons with children diagnosed as migraine with or without aura revealed, from the VER findings of higher amplitude fast wave activity and the presence of paroxysmal sharp wave activity, that abdominal migraine appears to be a specific form of childhood migraine. We found that both clinically and electrophysiologically, abdominal migraine changes with age; older children exhibiting a shorter duration of abdominal pain during attacks, and less evidence of sharp wave activity in the VER. 
4	Acute aortic valvular incompetence following blunt thoracic deceleration injury: case report. Blunt trauma leading to aortic valvular incompetence is rarely encountered, with 27 cases reported to date. All cusps and commissures are involved to a similar degree. Treatment includes either reattachment of cusps to the annulus (80% recurrence of incompetence) or valvular replacement (no recurrence). Valve replacement is the treatment of choice for these patients. 
5	Levels of disability among U.S. adults with arthritis. This article studies the excess levels of disability experienced by persons with arthritis, compared to persons without the disease. The data set is the Supplement on Aging (1984 National Health Interview Survey); it has information for a national probability sample of community-dwelling persons ages 55 + (N = 16,148). (1) Arthritis people have more difficulty in physical functions, personal care, and household care than do nonarthritis persons. The excess disability is greatest for physical functions (walking, reaching, stooping, etc.). Disabled arthritis people have especially high degrees of difficulty in physical activities that require endurance and strength. (2) Various models are tested for walking, grasping, shopping, and light housework to show how comorbidity propels disability for arthritis people and to show arthritis' own contribution to disability in the presence of other chronic conditions. Difficulties escalate for arthritis people when they have other concurrent conditions. These models affirm that arthritis has a pronounced effect on physical dysfunctions, but these are not readily translated into personal and household care problems. Apparently, arthritis people often make successful accommodations so their roles and daily activities are not seriously affected by the disease. 
4	Critical ischemia times and survival patterns of experimental pig flaps. Previous work on critical ischemia time suggested (1) a greater susceptibility of myocutaneous flaps over skin flaps to the ischemia reperfusion injury and (2) that duration of ischemia may affect the survival area of a flap. Using a pig model, 55 animals were operated on and the critical ischemia times and survival patterns of the buttock skin (n = 85) and latissimus dorsi myocutaneous (n = 88) island flaps were determined after being submitted to 0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, and 16 hours of normothermic ischemia. The average critical ischemia times (CIT50) were determined to be 9 and 10 hours for the buttock skin and latissimus dorsi myocutaneous flaps, respectively. Percentage of total area surviving (%TAS) in those flaps which did survive was adversely affected by increases in the ischemic interval in both flap models. A statistically significant decrease in percentage of total area surviving was found after 6 and 8 hours of ischemia for the buttock skin and latissimus dorsi myocutaneous flaps, respectively. 
1	Benign and malignant nodules in cirrhotic livers: distinction based on blood supply. The blood supplies of nodular lesions associated with liver cirrhosis were analyzed in vivo with various imaging modalities. The portal blood supply was evaluated with computed tomography (CT) during arterial portography (CTAP); the arterial blood supply was evaluated with hepatic angiography, CT angiography, CT following intraarterial injection of iodized oil, or ultrasound following intraarterial injection of carbon dioxide microbubbles. A total of 84 surgically confirmed hepatocellular carcinomas (HCCs) (less than or equal to 3 cm) and 25 areas of adenomatous hyperplasia (AH) were included in the study. At CTAP, a portal blood supply was seen in 96% of cases of AH and only 6% of HCCs (chi 2, P less than .005). In contrast, an arterial supply greater than that of the surrounding liver was verified in 94% of the HCCs and only 4% of the cases of AH (chi 2, P less than .005). The blood supply of areas of AH with atypical hepatocytes and the blood supply of well-differentiated HCCs (Edmondson grade 1) tended to be intermediate between that of AH without atypia and that of HCC that was Edmondson and Steiner grade 2 or greater. Evaluation of the blood supply of the nodular lesions associated with liver cirrhosis is considered to be useful in the differential diagnosis and treatment of early-stage HCC. 
5	Percutaneous transperineal prostate cryosurgery using transrectal ultrasound guidance: animal model. Cryosurgery has previously been used successfully to treat prostatic carcinoma. Inability to monitor the freezing led to local complications that limited the use of this modality. Recent studies have shown that monitoring of the freezing process can be accomplished using real-time ultrasound. In this study, transrectal ultrasound guidance was used to guide a cryoprobe percutaneously, using a transperineal approach, into the prostate. The extent of freezing was then monitored using ultrasound, taking care not to freeze the urethra or the rectum. Six dogs had the procedure without any complications. This study demonstrates the feasibility of a noninvasive treatment for prostatic carcinoma. 
4	Cor triatriatum: clinical presentation and surgical results in 12 patients. Twelve patients with cor triatriatum have been seen at our institution since 1979. The clinical presentation, diagnostic evaluation, and surgical results are outlined in this retrospective review. Operation is the treatment of choice for this rare congenital cardiac defect. One patient died 1 day before scheduled operation, and 2 patients died postoperatively, yielding a surgical mortality rate of 17% and an overall mortality rate of 25%. Resection of the obstructing atrial membrane was performed using hypothermic cardiopulmonary bypass in all cases. Left atriotomy was performed in 6 patients, and right atriotomy was performed in 7. The two postoperative deaths occurred in patients who had serious associated cardiac defects. Associated anomalies include atrial septal defect, persistent left superior vena cava, and partial anomalous pulmonary venous return. The postoperative course has been excellent in all 9 surviving patients; all remain asymptomatic. Cor triatriatum is amenable to surgical repair with excellent results when diagnosed early and when not complicated by other severe cardiac anomalies. 
1	Ovarian granulosa-stromal cell tumors are characterized by trisomy 12. Eleven ovarian granulosa-stromal cell tumors including 1 thecoma, 2 fibromas, 6 fibrothecomas, and 2 granulosa cell tumors, were karyotyped after direct harvest and/or short-term tissue culture. Bilateral fibrothecomas from one patient appeared to lack cytogenetic aberrations: the remaining nine tumors were characterized by trisomy for chromosome 12. Cytogenetic aberrations in the two granulosa cell tumors were much less complex than those described previously in undifferentiated carcinomas; accordingly cytogenetic analyses might be useful in distinguishing these categories. The consistent occurrence of trisomy 12 in different varieties of granulosa-stromal cell tumors suggests a common mechanism of oncogenesis within this diverse group of neoplasms. That mechanism probably involves promotion of low-grade, orderly cell proliferation. 
2	Annular pancreas as a cause of extrahepatic biliary obstruction. Annular pancreas is a rare congenital abnormality that is increasingly diagnosed by endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) in the adult. In this population, it can present with duodenal or gastric ulceration, duodenal obstruction, pancreatitis, and, rarely, with associated congenital abnormalities. Although it has been suggested that biliary obstruction may result from associated pancreatitis, such cases have not been reported; primary extrahepatic biliary obstruction from a constricting annulus also has not been reported. We report such a case, and describe resolution of symptoms and a return to normal biochemical tests in a patient. The literature and embryology of annular pancreas are reviewed. We suggest that this entity be added to the differential diagnosis of extrahepatic biliary obstruction. 
3	Lumbar puncture frequency and cerebrospinal fluid analysis in the neonate. A prospective study was performed to assess the frequency and diagnostic utility of lumbar punctures in neonates both during their first week of life and thereafter. During the two 6-month periods from January 1, 1985 to June 30, 1985, and February 1, 1986 to July 31, 1986, 712 neonates underwent 728 lumbar punctures during their first week of life primarily as part of the evaluation for suspected infection, either congenital or postnatal. There were eight patients with positive spinal fluid cultures in the first week of life, but only one patient simultaneously had a positive blood culture and a clinical course consistent with meningitis. In contrast, a considerably higher yield, approximating five times that of the first week of life, was obtained in patients undergoing a lumbar puncture after the first week of life. 
3	Experiential phenomena of temporal lobe epilepsy. Facts and hypotheses. Experiential phenomena that occur in temporal lobe seizures and can be reproduced by electrical stimulation of temporal lobe structures typically encompass perceptual, mnemonic and affective features, either in combination or in isolation, which commonly relate to the patient's individual past experience. These phenomena raise interesting questions concerning brain mechanisms involved in human psychophysiology. The anatomical substrates for the evocation of these phenomena are widely distributed within the temporal lobe and include temporal isocortex and limbic structures (amygdala, hippocampus and parahippocampal gyrus). Arguments are presented which indicate that experiential phenomena are positive expressions of temporal lobe and limbic function and do not result from its ictal paralysis. Recent concepts of parallel distributed processing (Rumelhart and McClelland, 1986) and the importance of parallel distributed cortical networks for higher cognitive functions (Goldman-Rakic, 1988a, b) provide a theoretical framework on which a hypothesis explaining experiential phenomena can be based. In conformity with these concepts the hypothesis assumes that temporal lobe epileptic discharge or electrical stimulation of temporal lobe structures can induce the elaboration of patterns of excitation and inhibition in widely distributed neuronal networks, some of which are capable of forming a specific matrix representing the substrate of a given experience. Neuronal networks engaged in parallel distributed processing (1) have the capacity to recreate the totality of a given experience when only a fragment of the network is activated, and (2) they tolerate a great deal of degradation by random inactivation of its components or by interference through random noise without serious loss of information content. These features are compatible with the assumption that localized epileptic neuronal discharge or electrical stimulation involving some temporal lobe structures could create a matrix representing features of individual experience of the kind activated in the course of temporal lobe seizures. Such an experience could, up to a certain limit, resist the degrading influence of mounting noise which inevitably must attend seizure discharge. 
4	Relation of left ventricular mass and geometry to morbidity and mortality in uncomplicated essential hypertension. OBJECTIVE: To assess the prognostic significance of left ventricular mass and geometry in initially healthy persons with essential hypertension. DESIGN: An observational study of a prospectively identified cohort. SETTING: University medical center. PATIENTS: Two hundred and eighty patients with essential hypertension and no pre-existing cardiac disease were evaluated using echocardiography between 1976 and 1981. Two hundred and fifty-three subjects or their family members (90%) were contacted for a follow-up interview an average of 10.2 years after the initial echocardiogram was obtained; the survival status of 27 patients lost to follow-up was ascertained using National Death Index data. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Left ventricular mass exceeded 125 g/m2 in 69 of 253 patients (27%). Cardiovascular events occurred in a higher proportion of patients with than without left ventricular hypertrophy (26% compared with 12%; P = 0.006). Patients with increased ventricular mass were also at higher risk for cardiovascular death (14% compared with 0.5%; P less than 0.001) and all-cause mortality (16% compared with 2%; P = 0.001). Electrocardiographic left ventricular hypertrophy did not predict risk. Patients with normal left ventricular geometry had the fewest adverse outcomes (no cardiac deaths; morbid events in 11%), and those with concentric hypertrophy had the most (death in 21%; morbid events in 31%). In a multivariate analysis, only age and left ventricular mass--but not gender, blood pressure, or serum cholesterol level--independently predicted all three outcome measures. CONCLUSIONS: Echocardiographically determined left ventricular mass and geometry stratify risk in patients with essential hypertension independently of and more strongly than blood pressure or other potentially reversible risk factors and may help to stratify the need for intensive treatment. 
5	Acute subdural hematoma: morbidity, mortality, and operative timing. Traumatic acute subdural hematoma remains one of the most lethal of all head injuries. Since 1981, it has been strongly held that the critical factor in overall outcome from acute subdural hematoma is timing of operative intervention for clot removal; those operated on within 4 hours of injury may have mortality rates as low as 30% with functional survival rates as high as 65%. Data were reviewed for 1150 severely head-injured patients (Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) scores 3 to 7) treated at a Level 1 trauma center between 1982 and 1987; 101 of these patients had acute subdural hematoma. Standard treatment protocol included aggressive prehospital resuscitation measures, rapid operative intervention, and aggressive postoperative control of intracranial pressure (ICP). The overall mortality rate was 66%, and 19% had functional recovery. The following variables statistically correlated (p less than 0.05) with outcome; motorcycle accident as a mechanism of injury, age over 65 years, admission GCS score of 3 or 4, and postoperative ICP greater than 45 mm Hg. The time from injury to operative evacuation of the acute subdural hematoma in regard to outcome morbidity and mortality was not statistically significant even when examined at hourly intervals although there were trends indicating that earlier surgery improved outcome. The findings of this study support the pathophysiological evidence that, in acute subdural hematoma, the extent of primary underlying brain injury is more important than the subdural clot itself in dictating outcome; therefore, the ability to control ICP is more critical to outcome than the absolute timing of subdural blood removal. 
5	Persistent lower respiratory tract inflammation associated with interstitial lung disease in patients with tropical pulmonary eosinophilia following conventional treatment with diethylcarbamazine. Tropical pulmonary eosinophilia (TPE) presents as an acute syndrome with dyspnea, fluffy infiltrates, and rounded opacities on the chest radiograph, reduced lung function, marked eosinophilia in the blood and lower respiratory tract, and high titers of specific IgE and IgG antifilarial antibodies. The standard therapy for TPE is a 3-wk course of diethylcarbamazine (DEC) following which there is almost always a marked improvement in all parameters. However, clinical observations suggest that the disease can persist despite DEC therapy and lead to chronic dyspnea with restrictive lung impairment. To evaluate the concept that DEC therapy is not completely "curative" for TPE, but rather leaves most individuals with a mild, chronic form of TPE defined by persistent inflammation of the lower respiratory tract, we evaluated 23 individuals an average of 12 +/- 2 months following a standard 3-wk course of diethylcarbamazine for acute TPE. In the majority there were mild, persistent symptoms referrable to the lung, chest X-ray abnormalities, blood eosinophilia, and elevated serum IgE and filarial specific IgG. On the average, lung function was consistent with the presence of chronic, mild interstitial lung disease. When the inflammatory cells from the lower respiratory tract were examined, there was a persistent eosinophilic alveolitis (TPE/post-DEC 1769 +/- 376 eosinophils/microliters epithelial lining fluid; normal subjects 256 +/- 38, p less than 0.02). Evaluation of the lower respiratory tract inflammatory cells recovered from the TPE/post-DEC-treated individuals demonstrated spontaneous release of exaggerated amounts of O2-. and H2O2 compared to normal subjects (p less than 0.05, both comparisons). 
5	Genetics and biology of human ovarian teratomas. I. Cytogenetic analysis and mechanism of origin. One hundred and two benign, mature ovarian teratomas and two immature, malignant teratomas were karyotyped and scored for centromeric heteromorphisms as part of an ongoing project to determine the chromosomal karyotype and the genetic origin of ovarian teratomas and to assess their utility for gene-centromere mapping. Karyotypic analysis of the benign cases revealed 95 46,XX teratomas and 7 chromosomally abnormal teratomas (47,XXX, 47,XX,+8 [two cases], 47,XX,+15, 48,XX,+7,+12 91,XXXX,-13 [mosaic], 47,XX,-15,+21,+mar). Our study reports on the first cases of tetraploidy and structural rearrangement in benign ovarian teratomas. The two immature cases had modal chromosome numbers of 78 and 49. Centromeric heteromorphisms that were heterozygous in the host were homozygous in 65.2% (n = 58) of the benign teratomas and heterozygous in the remaining 34.8% (n = 31). Chromosome 13 heteromorphisms were the most informative, with 72.7% heterozygosity in hosts. The cytogenetic data indicate that 65% of teratomas are derived from a single germ cell after meiosis I and failure of meiosis II (type II) or endoreduplication of a mature ovum (type III); 35% arise by failure of meiosis I (type I) or mitotic division of premeiotic germ cells (type IV). 
5	Transplant coronary artery disease: histopathologic correlations with angiographic morphology. Accelerated coronary artery disease is a major cause of morbidity and mortality among cardiac transplant recipients. Ten patients who died or underwent retransplantation within 2 months of coronary angiography had direct correlation of angiographic (normal discrete lesions, diffuse concentric narrowing) with histologic appearance of coronary arteries. Of the 26 angiographically normal segments, 73% showed mild to moderate fibrous intimal thickening by light microscopy. The remainder had intermediate lesions or atheromatous plaques. Discrete stenoses usually corresponded to lipid-rich intermediate or atheromatous disease. In contrast, angiographically diffuse, concentrically narrowed lesions usually were areas of severe fibrous intimal thickening. Fresh or organizing thrombus was most often associated with discrete lesions and accounted for all complete occlusions. Histologic and angiographic comparisons of the degree of luminal narrowing showed generally good correlation for high grade stenoses. Lesions graded as having less than 25% diameter narrowing were often underestimated angiographically as compared with histologic determinations. Transplant coronary artery disease has a heterogeneous histologic and angiographic appearance, with angiographic underestimation of disease in some patients. 
5	Serial CA 125 levels during chemotherapy for metastatic or recurrent endometrial cancer. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the role of serial CA 125 in monitoring disease status during chemotherapy in women with metastatic or recurrent endometrial cancer. CA 125 was measured in 21 women receiving cisplatin, etoposide, and Adriamycin for a total of 275 courses of chemotherapy (median eight). Eight of ten patients had elevated pre-therapy CA 125 levels (median 233 U/mL). CA 125 became and/or remained negative in all 20 women with responding or stable disease and was elevated in all nine patients who relapsed. The median level at the time of relapse was 56 U/mL. Levels were elevated before clinical relapse in five of nine patients (56%). Serial CA 125 may aid in the management of women receiving chemotherapy for advanced or recurrent endometrial cancer. 
5	Femoral saphenous vein bypass in a newborn. This is believed to be the youngest patient to undergo a saphenous vein bypass for iatrogenic trauma of the right superficial femoral artery. The infant had emergency right heart catheterisation and Rashkind septostomy for severe desaturation due to transposition of the great arteries. During the exposure of the saphenous vein, the superficial femoral artery was accidentally severed at it's origin. An attempt to restore the circulation by end-to-end anastomosis failed and resulted in persistent limb ischemia for over 4 hours. The baby was reoperated upon, the damaged part of the superficial femoral artery was resected and a saphenous vein graft interposed between the common and the distal superficial femoral artery. 
5	Selective pulmonary vasodilation with ATP-MgCl2 during pulmonary hypertension in lambs. We investigated the effects of infusions of ATP-MgCl2 on the circulation in 11 spontaneously breathing newborn lambs during pulmonary hypertension induced either by the infusion of U-46619, a thromboxane A2 mimetic, or by hypoxia. During pulmonary hypertension induced by U-46619, ATP-MgCl2 (0.01-1.0 mg.kg-1.min-1) caused a significant dose-dependent decrease in pulmonary arterial pressure (12.4-40.7%, P less than 0.05), while systemic arterial pressure decreased only at the highest doses (P less than 0.05). Left atrial infusions of ATP-MgCl2 caused systemic hypotension without decreasing pulmonary arterial pressure. During hypoxia-induced pulmonary hypertension, ATP-MgCl2 caused a similar significant dose-dependent decrease in pulmonary arterial pressure (12.0-41.1%, P less than 0.05), while systemic arterial pressure decreased only at high doses (P less than 0.05). Regression analysis showed selectivity of the vasodilating effects of ATP-MgCl2 for the pulmonary circulation during pulmonary hypertension induced either by U-46619 or hypoxia. ATP-MgCl2 is a potent vasodilator with a rapid metabolism that allows for selective vasodilation of the vascular bed first encountered (pulmonary or systemic). We conclude that infusions of ATP-MgCl2 may be clinically useful in the treatment of children with pulmonary hypertension. 
2	Absorption and motility of the bypassed human ileum. The authors assessed absorption and motility of the human ileum after a prolonged period of disuse. In eight patients with ulcerative colitis, a manometric-catheter assembly was placed via the ileostomy into the unused portion of distal ileum two months after ileal pouch-anal anastomosis and temporary diverting loop ileostomy. The distal ileum was perfused at 5 ml/min with an isosmotic solution of either sodium chloride or ileal chyme diluted with sodium chloride for three hours before and three hours after a meal on two consecutive days. Absorption was measured, single and clustered pressure waves were identified and quantitated with the aid of a computer program, and a motility index was calculated. Mean absorption +/- S.E.M. of both perfusates was poor on day 1 (-10 +/- 2 ml/25 cm x 30 min), and the meal induced no ileal motor response. By day 2, however, absorption of both perfusates was much improved (-1 +/- 2 ml/25 cm x 30 min; P less than 0.05), and the number of discrete clustered contractions and the motility index now clearly increased after the meal (2.6 +/- 0.6 vs. 7.2 +/- 1.0 clustered waves/hr; 7.5 +/- 0.5 vs. 9.7 +/- 0.2 motility units/30 min; P less than 0.05). The conclusion was that absorption and motility of the human ileum were impaired after two months of disuse, but that ileal absorption and motility improved one day after the introduction of isosmotic ileal perfusates. 
5	Phase I study of interleukin-2 and interferon alfa-2a as outpatient therapy for patients with advanced malignancy. Twenty-six patients were treated in this phase I study with the combination of interleukin-2 (IL2) administered as a continuous infusion and interferon alfa-2a (IFN alpha-2a) administered intramuscularly to patients in an outpatient setting. The maximum-tolerated dose of both agents given as outpatient therapy was 2 x 10(6) U/m2 days 1 to 5 of IL2 and 9 x 10(6) U/m2 days 1, 3, and 5 of IFN alpha-2a for 4 consecutive weeks. A 2- to 4-week rest period was permitted after each 4 weeks of treatment. Fatigue was the treatment-limiting toxicity, and serious clinical or laboratory abnormalities occurred infrequently during this study. Patients with colon cancer metastatic to the liver tolerated treatment worse than patients with other tumors. Twelve of the 15 patients with renal cell cancer were assessable for response determinations. Of these 12 patients, three exhibited complete tumor regression, three have had partial objective regression, and three patients experienced stabilization of rapidly progressive disease. This therapy appears to be well tolerated in an outpatient treatment setting and shows significant activity against advanced renal cell cancer. 
4	Increased erythrocyte sodium-lithium countertransport activity in essential hypertension is due to an increased affinity for extracellular sodium. 1. Sodium-lithium countertransport activity in a standard assay, its sodium affinity constant and maximum velocity were measured in erythrocytes from normal subjects and from essential hypertensive patients with and without a family history of hypertension. 2. In normal subjects the sodium concentration used in the standard assay was similar to the sodium affinity constant so that the activity measured in this assay was less than the maximum velocity. 3. In patients with essential hypertension and a positive family history, 33% had a sodium-lithium countertransport activity greater than the upper limit of the normal control range (0.4 mmol of Li+ h-1 l-1 of cells). 4. The reason for the raised sodium-lithium countertransport activity was an increased sodium affinity (lower sodium affinity constant) at the outside ion-binding site. 5. Of the patients with essential hypertension and a positive family history but sodium-lithium countertransport activity within the normal range in the standard assay, 30% also had a low sodium affinity constant. 6. A low sodium affinity constant at the outside site of the sodium-lithium countertransporter may be a more specific indicator for a group of patients with inherited hypertension than the standard sodium-lithium countertransport activity assay. 
1	Subscapular elastofibroma in a young pitcher. A case report. Subscapular elastofibromas and scapulothoracic bursitis can cause symptomatic masses in baseball pitchers. Both processes appear to represent reactive soft tissue responses to repetitive stress at the inferior border of the scapula. It is assumed that most masses in the subscapular area represent scapulothoracic bursitis rather than an elastofibroma. However, it is possible that some of the masses treated conservatively as scapulothoracic bursitis may be elastofibromas. A study is currently under way to evaluate the incidence of subscapular masses in college and professional pitchers in the United States. A follow-up report is anticipated when the study has been completed. The author requests information concerning any confirmed cases of elastofibroma in baseball pitchers. 
5	Radical prostatectomy after definitive radiation therapy for prostate cancer. Radical prostatectomy was performed in 14 patients following local failure of radiation therapy for adenocarcinoma of the prostate. Ten patients were treated with external beam and 4 with interstitial radiation. The interval from beginning radiation therapy to biopsy-proved residual or recurrent disease was twenty-four to one hundred fourteen months (mean 61 months). Ten patients had significant anterior and lateral fibrosis. Five patients had loss of tissue planes between the prostate and rectum, however, no rectal injuries occurred. Estimated blood loss was 300-8,000 cc (median 1,000 cc). Operative time was one hundred ten to three hundred seventy-five minutes (median 185 minutes). Significant late complications are impotence (100%) and incontinence (55%). Tumor volume was 1.1-27.2 cc (mean 11.1 cc). Seven patients had seminal vesicle involvement, 9 had level III capsule penetration, and 6 had positive surgical margins. Follow-up ranges from one to fifty-two months (median 18 months). Currently, 6 patients are clinically without disease and have serum prostate-specific antigen (PSA) of 0.0 ng/mL. Four patients have no clinical evidence of disease but do have detectable serum PSA, and 4 patients have evidence of metastatic bone disease on bone scan with elevated serum PSA levels. Radical prostatectomy following radiation therapy has no greater immediate morbidity or mortality compared with radical prostatectomy without prior irradiation and takes only slightly longer to perform. However, there is a marked increased risk of impotence and incontinence. More patients followed for a longer time are needed to assess the benefit of radical prostatectomy on survival of patients who fail radiation therapy. 
5	Aggressive therapeutic amniocentesis for treatment of twin-twin transfusion syndrome. Acute severe twin-twin transfusion syndrome occurs in about 1% of monochorionic twin gestations. In the most severe form, acute hydramnios develops in the recipient twin's sac and fetal hydrops may be present. The donor twin is anemic and oligohydramnios is present, so that the donor appears "stuck" in a cocoon made by its adherent amnion. In this report, aggressive therapeutic amniocentesis restored amniotic fluid volume to normal in both sacs in all pregnancies. Fetal hydrops resolved in three of five (60%) of the fetuses affected. Pregnancy was extended a mean 80 +/- 33 days (+/- 2 SD) and perinatal survival was 79%. These findings contrast dramatically with the virtual 100% mortality reported in the literature with no therapy. Repeated aggressive amniocentesis effectively reversed the physiology of twin-twin transfusion syndrome and should be the treatment of choice for acute hydramnios, which previously had no recommended therapy. 
1	Improved flow cytometric determination of proliferative activity (S-phase fraction) from paraffin-embedded tissue. Recent studies suggest that proliferative activity (S-phase fraction [SPF]) may have greater prognostic significance than total nuclear DNA content; however, relatively few studies have examined SPF from paraffin-embedded tissue because of significant contamination of histograms with debris. In this study, cell cycle analysis was performed on 124 matched tissue specimens. Fresh tissue was divided into two equal portions; one portion was frozen, whereas the other portion was processed and embedded in paraffin. S-phase could be determined for both frozen and paraffin-embedded tissue in 81 cases. Correlation between SPF from frozen and paraffin-embedded tissue was demonstrated (r = 0.80) when debris was subtracted from histograms with the use of two new subtraction algorithms referred to as multicut and singlecut. Unlike other debris-subtraction algorithms, the quantity and distribution of debris calculated by these algorithms are dependent on the magnitude and position of histogram peaks. A lesser degree of correlation was demonstrated with the use of a standard exponential debris subtraction algorithm (r = 0.67). Correlation of SPF for aneuploid cases was greater when SPF was calculated as a percentage of the aneuploid cell population rather than as a percentage of the entire cell population. This was attributed to the observation that the proportion of aneuploid cells from paraffin-embedded tissue was less than that from frozen tissue. The results of this study indicate that SPF can be calculated from paraffin-embedded tissue with values comparable to those obtained from frozen tissue. The ability to calculate SPF reliably from paraffin-embedded tissue should allow additional evaluation of this parameter as a prognostic indicator. 
2	Appraisal of gut lavage in the study of intestinal humoral immunity. Direct investigation of intestinal humoral immunity requires collection of intestinal secretions or mucosal biopsy specimens, or both. A non-invasive technique of gut lavage, with a polyethyleneglycol electrolyte lavage solution as a means of collecting intestinal secretions for immunoglobulin and antibody studies, was evaluated. Fifty patients were studied--25 immunologically normal patients or volunteers, 15 patients with untreated coeliac disease, and 10 patients with active Crohn's disease. Protease inhibitors were added promptly to samples to prevent proteolysis of immunoglobulin content. Treated lavage samples were assayed by enzyme linked immunosorbent assay for immunoglobulin and antibody content. Studies of serial lavage specimens showed that early, faecally contaminated specimens contained negligible quantities of immunoglobulin, but once the specimens became clear a steady state was reached, with little variation in immunoglobulin content between serial specimens and with a uniform dilution (around 20%) of the ingested polyethyleneglycol. Gut lavage fluid IgA was predominantly secretory, comprising 92%, 81.6%, and 76.7% respectively of the total IgA gut lavage fluid content in the control, coeliac, and Crohn's groups. High values of total IgM and IgA and IgM antigliadin antibodies were detected in the coeliac group, and high values of IgG in the Crohn's disease group. This method of gut lavage is not only an effective bowel cleanser, but also a noninvasive means of obtaining intestinal secretions for the study of humoral immunity in gastrointestinal disease. 
5	Protective role of vitamin E in biological systems. Vitamin E is well accepted as nature's most effective lipid-soluble, chain-breaking antioxidant, protecting cell membranes from peroxidative damage. Free-radical-mediated pathology has been implicated in the development over time of degenerative diseases and conditions. This paper reviews the current research on the protective role and requirements for vitamin E and the other antioxidants in preventing or minimizing free-radical damage associated with specific diseases and lifestyle patterns and processes, including cancer, aging, circulatory conditions, arthritis, cataract, pollution, and strenuous exercise. While awaiting results of further human studies, research evidence suggests that an adequate intake of vitamin E and the other antioxidants can provide protection from the increasingly high free-radical concentrations caused by air pollutants and current lifestyle patterns. 
3	Cervical muscle myoelectric response to acute experimental sternocleidomastoid pain. A method is presented for investigating the response of passive and active muscle to experimentally induced deep muscle pain. Ten healthy adult males performed multiple, submaximal isometric neck flexion tasks before and after pain had been induced in the sternocleidomastoid (SCM) muscle by injecting 5 ml of a hypertonic (5%) saline solution. A similar volume of isotonic saline was injected into the contralateral muscle as a control. Cervical myoelectric signal (MES) root-mean-square (RMS) response to each injection was recorded from eight neck muscles over 8 minutes. The subject rated perceived pain at regular intervals using a visual analog scale (VAS). Sternocleidomastoid pain, which reached a mean of 36 mm on the 100-mm VAS 2 minutes after the injection, resulted in significantly increased (1-2 microV, P less than 0.05) RMS MES in the otherwise relaxed SCM muscle during the first 2 minutes. This was followed by a gradual return to control values after 5 minutes. A similar trend in MES was found for the active SCM muscle during a 10% maximum voluntary contraction (MVC) isometric neck flexion effort. Thus, acute deep muscle pain caused subtle, yet systematic, changes in motor output in both the relaxed and active painful muscle, and its synergists and antagonists. 
1	Growth factor-dependent differentiation along the myeloid and lymphoid lineages in an immature acute T lymphocytic leukemia. Bone marrow cells from a child with an immature (CD2+, CD5+, CD7+) acute T lymphocytic leukemia (T-ALL) were cultured in the presence and absence of human rIL-2, IL-3, or granulocyte-macrophage (GM)-CSF. Cells cultured without growth factors failed to divide and those initiated in the presence of IL-2 or GM-CSF underwent maturation and terminal T lymphoid or myelomonocytic differentiation, respectively. In contrast, a permanent growth factor-dependent cell line, designated TALL-103/3, was established upon culture in IL-3. The TALL-103/3 cells gradually lost the T cell-specific markers and acquired a myeloid phenotype (CD15+, CD33+). Switching of the IL-3-dependent cells at an early passage to medium containing only human rIL-2 resulted in the establishment of a subline, named TALL-103/2, with a T lymphoid phenotype (CD3+, CD8+, TCR-gamma delta +, CD7+). The TALL-103/2 cells strictly require IL-2 for growth, are irreversibly committed to the lymphoid lineage, and cannot survive in the presence of any other hemopoietic growth factor tested so far. In contrast, the IL-3-dependent TALL-103/3 cells could be adapted to grow in synthetic (serum-free) medium also in the presence of either GM-CSF or IL-5, in which they retain a myeloid phenotype. Interestingly, after 18 mo in culture in IL-3, the TALL-103/3 cells can still be phenotypically converted to the lymphoid lineage upon addition of IL-2, thus maintaining its bipotentiality. Despite the marked phenotypic differences, the TALL-103/2 and TALL-103/3 cell lines show the same karyotypes with multiple abnormalities present in the primary malignant clone and have identical rearrangements of the TCR-gamma and -delta loci, thus confirming their derivation from a common precursor cell. Together, these findings indicate that the phenotype of immature T-ALL cells can be drastically modified by the presence of specific hemopoietic growth factors in the environment, leading to either lymphoid or myeloid lineage commitment while leaving their karyotype and genotype intact. 
4	Thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura related to ticlopidine 4 patients had typical features of thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP) after 3 to 8 weeks of ticlopidine therapy. In 2 ticlopidine was the only medication taken before TTP; in another, rechallenge with drugs other than ticlopidine that the patient had been taking did not produce relapse. In all patients the delay between start of ticlopidine and TTP was in the same range as the latent period before ticlopidine-induced neutropenia. No relapse occurred in the 4 to 43 months of follow-up in the 3 surviving patients. 
3	Occlusive arterial disease as a form of presentation of homocystinuria. Homocystinuria was first described in 1962. The disease affects several systems including the eyes, skeletal and nervous and vascular systems. We present the case of a 28-year old woman who presented with a severe occlusive arteriopathy. Screening for the most usual causes of arterial disease in young patients was negative, but a study of aminoaciduria and column chromatography confirmed the diagnosis of B6-responsive homocystinuria. Although it was necessary to amputate her left leg, the patient remains asymptomatic 16 months after B6 therapy was started. 
4	Acute complications of percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty for total occlusion. The incidence of major complications after percutaneous coronary angioplasty (PTCA) of a totally occluded artery was assessed retrospectively. A total of 1649 PTCA procedures were analyzed. After exclusion of procedures for acute myocardial infarction or total occlusion that resulted from restenosis, 90 patients were selected. Forty-four patients (49%) had stable angina and 46 (51%) had unstable angina. The estimated duration of occlusion was 87 +/- 78 days in patients with stable angina, as compared with 10 +/- 8 days in patients with unstable angina (p less than 0.001). Abrupt vessel closure during PTCA occurred only in patients with unstable angina (0% versus 17%, p less than 0.05). The major complication rate was 2.5% in the stable angina group, and 20% in unstable angina group (p less than 0.01). This rate was also significantly higher than the complication rate of 8% observed in 442 procedures that were performed during the same period in patients with the unstable angina and nonocclusive stenosis (p less than 0.01). Patients with unstable angina who undergo PTCA of a totally occluded artery represent a subset of high risk for major complications. 
4	Late potentials and inducible ventricular tachycardia in surgically repaired congenital heart disease. We compared signal-averaged electrocardiography with invasive electrophysiological study in patients after surgical repair of congenital heart disease to determine if potentially useful correlations exist between the two methods for assessment of risk for ventricular tachycardia. Thirty-one patients (age, 1-49 years; mean, 10.6 years) with congenital heart disease repaired with right ventriculotomy or postrepair right bundle branch block (77% postoperative tetralogy of Fallot) who had electrophysiological study were studied with signal-averaged electrocardiography. Patients were classified by electrophysiological study results as having no inducible ventricular tachycardia, nonsustained ventricular tachycardia, or sustained ventricular tachycardia. Signal-averaged electrocardiograms were examined for the duration of low-amplitude (less than or equal to 40 microV) QRS signal, duration of total QRS, and root-mean-square voltage of the terminal 40 msec of the QRS. Low-amplitude terminal root-mean-square voltage of 100 microV or less had 91% sensitivity and 70% specificity for ventricular tachycardia inducible by electrophysiological study. Similar sensitivity but less specificity were seen using the criterion of 20 msec or more total low-amplitude QRS signal (initial plus terminal) or using total QRS duration of 128 msec or more. There was a weaker association between terminal low-amplitude QRS signal of 15 msec or more and inducible ventricular tachycardia. 
5	Vaginal infections in adult women. Often trivialized by the medical profession, vaginitis in adult women is not only extremely common but is the source of considerable distress and often results in marked suffering. Epidemiologic studies described in this article indicate the high prevalence of vaginitis and the large number of causes. Although the majority of infections in women are due to bacterial vaginosis, VVC, and trichomoniasis, it is clear that many other causes exist, and we have yet to discover the etiology of many clinical syndromes. Considerable progress has been made in understanding the pathogenesis of the three common vaginitides. Although excellent progress has been made by the pharmaceutical industry in providing new drugs for vaginitis, any further progress will require a better understanding of etiology and pathogenesis. Vaginitis causes major symptoms and is more than a nuisance problem. Clinicians owe it to their patients to attempt to make an accurate diagnosis and not to rely on empiric therapy. 
5	Rehabilitation of three patients after treatment for herpes encephalitis. Patients with Herpes simplex encephalitis often are considered to be poor rehabilitation candidates because of their multiple deficits and grave prognosis. This report presents case reports on three patients with biopsy-proven Herpes simplex encephalitis, all of whom were treated with acyclovir in acute care and then admitted to an inpatient rehabilitation program. All had multiple brain lesions with minimal motor findings but cognitive and communication deficits. One patient, two weeks after admission, slipped into a coma and was transferred to an acute care hospital where he subsequently expired. The other two made useful functional gains and were discharged home in two weeks and 10 weeks, suggesting that a trial of rehabilitation may be warranted after Herpes simplex encephalitis. 
5	Electrocardiographic J waves after resuscitation from cardiac arrest. A patient was monitored prior to, during, and after cardiac arrest with a Holter monitor and an electrocardiograph. The arrest occurred without any premonitory signs on the ECG. At the onset of the arrest, torsades de pointes ventricular tachycardia occurred, which quickly degenerated into ventricular fibrillation. After a successful second defibrillation, the patient developed Osborn waves, which subsided within a few minutes. 
4	Superior hypophyseal artery aneurysm. Report of two cases. Two cases of saccular intracranial aneurysms arising from the superior hypophyseal artery take-off from the internal carotid artery are presented. The angiographic findings and technical details of the operative approach are discussed. Particular attention is focused on the use of fenestrated angled clips. 
3	Cardiac arrhythmias from a malpositioned Greenfield filter in a traumatic quadriplegic. A case study is presented of premature Greenfield filter discharge with intracardiac migration and resulting life-threatening arrhythmias. These arrhythmias also interfered with the patient's transition from ventilatory support via orotracheal intubation to noninvasive positive airway pressure ventilatory support methods. The patient's arrhythmias were controlled by a demand cardiac pacemaker and cardiac glycoside therapy. No anticoagulants were used. She had no further filter migration nor significant complications for 16 months after hospital discharge. 
1	The importance of cytogenetic studies in adult acute lymphocytic leukemia. PURPOSE: The prognostic importance of pretreatment bone marrow cytogenetic studies in adults with acute lymphocytic leukemia treated at a single institution, with an identical treatment program, is described. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A total of 105 patients with a documented morphologic diagnosis of acute lymphocytic leukemia were reviewed for the purpose of this analysis. All patients had an extensive workup at presentation, and cytogenetic analysis was performed in 103 patients, using the Giemsa banding technique with trypsin pretreatment on 24-hour cultured cells. RESULTS: The specific cytogenetic classification in the 103 patients who had the karyotypic analysis was as follows: diploid 27%; Philadelphia chromosome-positive 13%; hyperdiploid 12%; B-cell karyotype 6%; 6q- and 14q+ abnormalities 4%; pseudodiploid 8%; hypodiploid 2%; and insufficient metaphases 28%. B-cell, 6q- or 14q+, and Philadelphia chromosome-positive karyotypes tended to correlate with other known negative prognostic factors. Patients with diploid, hyperdiploid, pseudodiploid, and hypodiploid karyotypes or with insufficient metaphases could be combined into one group with a favorable prognosis. In this group, the remission rate with induction chemotherapy was 89%, the median complete remission duration was 26 months, and the median survival was 25 months, with a 3-year survival rate of 45%. Patients with Philadelphia chromosome-positive, B-cell, and 6q- or 14q+ abnormalities collectively had an unfavorable prognosis. Their response rate to induction chemotherapy was 65%, the median response duration was 7 months, and the median survival was 8 months, with a 3-year survival rate of less than 10%. CONCLUSION: We conclude that the pretreatment bone marrow karyotype is an important part of the evaluation of adults with acute lymphocytic leukemia and provides significant prognostic information. 
4	Capabilities of supine exercise electrocardiography versus exercise radionuclide angiography in predicting coronary events. The ability of supine exercise electrocardiography and exercise radionuclide angiography to predict time to subsequent cardiac events (cardiac death, nonfatal myocardial infarction or late coronary bypass grafting or angioplasty) were compared in 265 patients with normal resting electrocardiograms who were not taking digoxin. All patients had undergone coronary catheterization and were initially treated medically. Follow-up study was performed at a median of 51 months. Separate logistic regression models, which had been previously developed to predict 3-vessel or left main coronary artery disease (CAD), were compared using a Cox regression analysis to predict time to a subsequent cardiac event. The exercise electrocardiography model, consisting of the magnitude of ST depression, exercise heart rate and patient gender, was a powerful predictor (chi-square = 30.8, p less than 0.0001) of subsequent events. The exercise radionuclide angiography model, which included the exercise response of the pressure-volume ratio in addition to the exercise electrocardiography variables, had similar prognostic power (chi-square = 31.8, p less than 0.0001). In a separate analysis considering only cardiac death and nonfatal myocardial infarction, the exercise electrocardiography model remained a significant predictor of events (chi-square = 12.2, p less than 0.001). None of the radionuclide angiography variables added significantly to the prognostic power of the exercise electrocardiography model. Thus, in patients with a normal resting electrocardiogram who are not taking digoxin, the supine exercise electrocardiography model that predicts 3-vessel or left main CAD also predicts future cardiac events. Exercise radionuclide angiography does not provide any additional prognostic information in such patients. 
5	Reproducibility of growth hormone testing procedures: a comparison between 24-hour integrated concentration and pharmacological stimulation. The purpose of this study was to compare the reproducibility of two approaches to the evaluation of GH secretion: the integrated concentration of GH (IC-GH), a physiological test of GH secretion, and pharmacological stimulation tests. IC-GH was determined in 40 poorly growing children twice within 4 weeks. The first and second IC-GH were highly correlated r = 0.859, P less than 0.001. One hundred and thirteen poorly growing children underwent pharmacological GH stimulation tests twice within 6 weeks. A moderate correlation was found between the first and second pharmacological test r = 0.524, P less than 0.01. Among the three pharmacological stimuli studied, clonidine (n = 81) had the highest reproducibility followed by arginine (n = 20), and insulin (n = 12). We conclude that IC-GH is more consistently reproducible than the GH response to repeated pharmacological stimulation. 
4	Intraoperative anaphylaxis: an association with latex sensitivity. Latex products have recently been identified as the cause of severe intraoperative anaphylactic reactions. We have identified a group of pediatric patients who appear to be at increased risk for such reactions. Fifteen patients with either spina bifida or congenital urologic abnormalities experienced 19 intraoperative anaphylactic reactions. All patients had frequent previous exposures to rubber materials since infancy as part of their management and/or investigative procedures. Seven of 15 patients had a previous history of local skin reactions to rubber. Only four patients were atopic. All patients had undergone multiple (two of 26) operative procedures before their reactions, the onset of which ranged from 40 to 290 minutes after induction of anesthesia. The reactions varied in intensity from urticaria to severe cardiorespiratory collapse. All these patients subsequently had positive allergy skin tests and positive RAST to latex antigen. We conclude that this group is at risk when they are exposed to latex intraoperatively as a result of frequent past exposure to these materials. Allergic evaluation for latex allergy may assist in the preoperative evaluation of similar patients. In sensitized patients, appropriate prophylactic measures, particularly the avoidance of latex, is required. 
2	Clinical observation on the association of gallstones and colorectal cancer. A possible association between gallstones, colorectal cancer, and gastric cancer was investigated. The age distribution and mean age of the two cancer groups were identical. The incidence of gallstones in 378 colorectal cancer cases and 869 gastric cancer cases was 7.1% and 5.5%, respectively. Of colorectal cancer cases, 33 cases with multiple carcinomas had a significantly higher gallstone incidence than cases with a solitary carcinoma--24.2% and 5.5%, respectively. The mean age was 5 years older in gallstone cases than in those without gallstones in both cancer groups, and it was 4 years older in multiple-carcinoma cases than in solitary-carcinoma cases in the colorectal cancer group. These results suggest that the higher levels of same causative factors (i.e., dietary fat) are associated with a longer duration of gallstone formation and colorectal cancer development as demonstrated by multiple colorectal-carcinoma cases. 
5	Apparent reduction in the size of one side of the face associated with a small retrosplenial haemorrhage. A 68 year old Japanese female with unilateral metamorphopsia of the face that developed after a small haemorrhage in the contralateral retrosplenial region, is described. The patient claimed that the right side of a face, that is, the left side when looked at by the patient, appeared smaller than the left. In addition, her drawings of the face showed some distortions. Objects other than the face were perceived normally. Cranial CT scan revealed a small high density area in the right retrosplenial region. The face appears to have a special representation in the posterior hemisphere. 
3	Effect of emitted power on waveform intensity in transcranial Doppler This study assesses the problem of transcranial Doppler recording failure and seeks to determine the extent to which this can be ameliorated by increased emitted power. We hypothesized that waveform intensity is directly related to the rate and quality of successful recording and may be compared quantitatively among groups of patients. Among a large group of patients recorded at 800 mW/cm2 emitted power, intensity was strongest in white men, weakest in black women, and intermediate in black men and white women. It declined with age in women of either race, but not in men of either race. Analysis of the effect of emitted power on intensity predicted that significant numbers of waveforms recorded at 800 mW/cm2 could not be recorded at the current clinical standards of 100 mW/cm2, the difference being most pronounced in elderly black women. Temporal bone window thickness measured in a series of adult cadaver skulls was least in white men, greatest in black women, and intermediate in black men and white women. The findings of this study support the hypothesis that temporal bone window thickness is an important determinant of recording difficulty and suggest that increased emitted power can significantly increase successful recording, particularly in black and elderly patients. Increased power alone, however, cannot completely solve the recording problem within safe limits. 
5	Conjugates of ursodeoxycholate protect against cholestasis and hepatocellular necrosis caused by more hydrophobic bile salts. In vivo studies in the rat. The protective effect of ursodeoxycholate conjugates against bile salt hepatotoxicity was studied in chronic bile fistula rats. Taurochenodeoxycholate or taurodeoxycholate, infused intraduodenally at 24 or 16 mumols/100 g rat per hour, respectively, caused cholestasis and severe hepatocellular necrosis within 8 hours. In contrast, tauroursodeoxycholate or taurocholate at 48 mumols/100 g rat per hour were choleretic. Tauroursodeoxycholate was not hepatotoxic, whereas taurocholate produced moderate hepatocellular necrosis. Simultaneous infusion of tauroursodeoxycholate to rats receiving taurochenoxycholate or taurodeoxycholate preserved bile flow and ameliorated hepatic injury in a dose-dependent manner. Tauroursodeoxycholate protected equally by intravenous and intraduodenal routes. Intravenous glycoursodeoxycholate also was protective. The hydrophobicity index of infused bile salts correlated well with their toxicity. Concurrent administration of ursodeoxycholate conjugates did not reduce biliary recovery of intraduodenally infused [24-14C]-taurocholate. Biliary alkaline phosphatase secretion was stimulated by infusion of taurocholate, taurodeoxycholate, or taurochenodeoxycholate; simultaneous infusion of ursodeoxycholate conjugates failed to prevent this increase. We conclude that ursodeoxycholate counteracts hepatoxicity of more hydrophobic bile salts via a direct effect at the level of the liver. 
4	Subaortic obstruction: intraoperative echocardiography as an adjunct to operation. Fourteen patients undergoing operation for subaortic obstruction (membranous obstruction in 11 patients, tunnel obstruction in 2 patients, obstruction due to reduplicated mitral valve tissue in 1 patient) were evaluated by intraoperative epicardial echocardiography. In all 9 patients with "discrete" obstruction who underwent prebypass epicardial echocardiography, the septal and lateral attachments of the lesion were correctly demonstrated. The precise extent of tunnel stenosis was seen in both patients. The lateral attachment of the membrane in 4 patients and multiple extensions in another 2 were identified by the epicardial study (having been missed on precordial echocardiography). The discrete membrane was enucleated in 10 of the 11 patients and was partially resected in 1. One tunnel obstruction was completely relieved; the other was partially relieved. Reduplicated mitral valve tissue in the remaining patient was completely resected. Epicardial imaging after bypass showed remnants of the membrane in 2 patients. Intraoperative Doppler echocardiography and color flow imaging confirmed the absence of clinically significant residual gradients (less than 20 mm Hg) in all but 1 patient with tunnel obstruction. Epicardial imaging provided excellent morphological information about obstructive lesions of the left ventricular outflow tract and enabled immediate assessment of surgical repair. 
1	Cerebral tumor staging in patients with bronchial carcinoma by computed tomography. Computerized tomographic (CT) scans of 271 patients with histologically proven bronchial carcinoma accomplished for initial tumor staging were retrospectively evaluated for signs of cerebral metastasis. The results for the histologic subtypes were quite different. In 13.8% of patients with small cell carcinoma and limited disease the authors found signs of brain metastasis. However, routine cerebral staging in these patients did not seem to be useful because of lack of therapeutic consequences. On the other hand, no patient with non-small cell carcinoma (N-SCC) and tumor Stage I or II had brain metastases. All patients with brain metastasis from N-SCC had been classified as tumor Stage III before cerebral imaging. Among these patients, however, the authors found brain metastasis in 17.5% of those without known distant metastatic disease (III/M0), especially in large cell carcinoma and in adenocarcinoma. Stage III/M0 patients should undergo routine cerebral imaging if their tumor is surgically resectable and thoracotomy is planned. 
1	Inverted papilloma of renal pelvis: flexible ureteroscopic diagnosis and treatment. A case is reported of inverted papilloma of the renal pelvis in a patient with previous transitional cell carcinoma of the bladder. The renal pelvic lesion was diagnosed and treated with a flexible ureteropyeloscope. Although nephroureterectomy was avoided, the patient must be carefully followed endoscopically and radiographically for recurrence of lesions throughout the urinary tract. This case represents the first report of the endoscopic diagnosis and treatment of an inverted papilloma of the renal pelvis. It demonstrates the vast potential for endoscopic diagnosis, treatment, and surveillance throughout the urinary tract. 
3	The influence of dialysate sodium and variable ultrafiltration on fluid balance during hemodialysis. An important factor in the development of hypotension during hemodialysis (HD) is a decrease in blood volume, due to ultrafiltration (UF) and an insufficient refill of the intravascular compartment. This insufficient refill might be caused by a transcellular fluid shift from the extracellular to the intracellular compartment. We studied the influence of dialysate sodium concentration and UF rate on the refill rate, blood volume, intracellular (ICV) and extracellular fluid volume (ECV). Three different HD strategies were studied in 15 patients: (A) conventional HD (dialysate sodium 140 mmol/L); (B) HD with a sodium profile (140-148 mmol/L); and (C) HD with a sodium profile and a variable UF rate (high-low UF rate). ICV and ECV were measured by non-invasive conductivity measurements, blood volume was calculated from erythrocyte counts before and after treatment. Blood volume decrease was most pronounced during conventional HD, due to insufficient refilling without a detectable transcellular fluid shift. The sum of the decrease in ICV and EVC was less than during (B) and (C). The insufficient refill led to a higher prevalence of hypotension and cramps. The strategies (B) and (C) led to an significant and comparable transcellular fluid shift to the extracellular compartment. Thus, the use of a sodium profile led to a better intravascular refill and clinical tolerance of HD. Addition of a UF profile did not improve this any further. 
4	Causes and consequences of blood pressure alterations in obstructive sleep apnea. The obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) syndrome has been considered to be a cause of both transient blood pressure elevations during sleep and sustained hypertension during the awake state. The purpose of this review was to examine critically the existing literature regarding (1) the blood pressure alterations associated with OSA, (2) causal mechanisms relating specific blood pressure alterations to OSA, and (3) potential consequences of the systemic circulatory abnormalities associated with OSA. Particular attention was directed at studies that assessed the prevalence of OSA in patients with hypertension and that examined the effects on blood pressure of treatment of OSA. We conclude that patients with OSA have abnormal sleep blood pressure patterns, manifested most frequently by apnea-associated blood pressure elevations. Confounding factors such as obesity and antihypertensive drug therapy, and conflicting evidence regarding changes in daytime blood pressure after therapy for OSA, make it premature to conclude that OSA and daytime hypertension are directly associated. Circumstantial evidence suggests that the blood pressure alterations that occur during sleep could contribute to the high cardiovascular morbidity in patients with OSA. Further research into the relationship between OSA and hypertension should improve the future care of patients with these conditions and enhance our understanding of cardiopulmonary pathophysiology. 
5	Treatment of ventricular tachycardia induced cardiogenic shock by percoronary chemical ablation. Incessant ventricular arrhythmias pose an especially challenging therapeutic dilemma. We describe the successful treatment and follow-up of a patient with refractory ventricular tachycardia-induced cardiogenic shock with percoronary chemical ablation. After endocardial mapping was used to identify the "tachycardia-related" coronary artery, temporary termination of the arrhythmia with balloon occlusion and subselective intracoronary installation of iced saline as previously advocated was unsuccessful. This was probably due to a dual arterial blood supply to the arrhythmogenic focus. However, infusion of 2 cc ethanol (99%) permanently terminated the arrhythmia. Contrary to previous experience, ethanol-induced arrhythmia termination did not result in arterial occlusion, further supporting a direct toxic effect on the myocardium as its mode of action. Use of standard angioplasty balloon inflation prevents "backwash" of distally infused ethanol and more generalized cell death. The only complication of this procedure was temporary third-degree AV block, requiring permanent pacemaker implantation. 
3	Three-dimensional reconstructed MR imaging of the inner ear. The three-dimensional Fourier transform fast imaging with steady precession (FISP) technique was used to obtain high-resolution magnetic resonance (MR) images of the temporal bone region and to generate three-dimensional reconstructed images of the inner ear. The three-dimensional reconstructed images of the inner ear were directly synthesized from two-dimensional images of the temporal bone region by means of an external processing computer. With use of three-dimensional reconstructed images and stereoscopic observations, structures inside the temporal bone region and the positional relationship among them were easily recognized. These structures are difficult to demonstrate with two-dimensional images. This three-dimensional method was also shown to be useful for recognition of disease and anatomic malformations in the temporal bone region. 
4	Morphometry of the subepithelial circulation in sheep airways. Effect of vascular congestion. In order to quantitate the subepithelial microvascular volume and its relation to the airway lumen, we conducted a morphometric analysis of the vascular compartment in the wall of the trachea (within a 55-microns depth from the epithelial basement membrane) and of 1.0 and 0.5-mm bronchioles of sheep. The lungs were fixed by bronchial and pulmonary artery perfusion with glutaraldehyde under three experimental conditions: (1) bronchial artery pressure, 100 mm Hg pulmonary artery pressure, 20 mm Hg (control); (2) bronchial artery pressure, 100 mm Hg, pulmonary artery pressure, 40 mm Hg (pulmonary hypertension, PH); (3) bronchial artery pressure, 100 mm Hg, pulmonary artery pressure, 40 mm Hg (pharmacologic vasodilation with sodium nitroprusside, PH + V). Venous pressures were atmospheric. Under control conditions, the microvascular volume fraction comprised 12, 16, and 15% of the subepithelial tissue in the trachea and 1-mm and 0.5-mm bronchioles, respectively. PH increased the microvascular volume fraction in the bronchioles (p less than 0.05), but it had no effect on the microvasculature in the trachea. PH + V approximately doubled the microvascular volume fraction in the trachea and the bronchioles. PH increased the mean wall thickness, and PH and PH + V decreased the airway cross-sectional area in the 1-mm bronchioles. These observations demonstrate that the microvasculature constitutes a considerable volume fraction of the subepithelial airway tissue and that vascular congestion can narrow the bronchiolar lumen. 
2	Alcoholics and liver transplantation. The Ethics and Social Impact Committee of the Transplant and Health Policy Center. Two arguments underlie a widespread unwillingness to consider patients with alcoholic cirrhosis of the liver as candidates for transplantation. First, alcoholics are morally blameworthy, their condition the result of their own misconduct; such blameworthiness disqualifies alcoholics in unavoidable competition for organs with others who are equally sick but blameless. Second, because of their habits, alcoholics will not exhibit satisfactory rates of survival after transplantation; good stewardship of a scarce lifesaving resource therefore requires that alcoholics not be considered for liver transplantation. These arguments are carefully analyzed and shown to be defective. There is not good moral or medical reason for categorically precluding alcoholics as candidates for liver transplantation. It would, in addition, be unjust to implement such a preclusion simply because others might respond negatively if we do not. 
5	Thrombectomy for late graft limb occlusion: our experience in 182 consecutive cases. Late occlusion of an aortofemoral bypass graft is usually caused by fibrointimal hyperplasia or progressive atherosclerosis. Several surgical approaches have been advocated in order to minimize the operative risk, to correct the impaired inflow and to provide a satisfactory outflow. In the last 16 years, in the Institute of Vascular Surgery and Angiology of the University of Milan, we have operated upon 182 consecutive thrombosed grafts. Inflow was restored by performing a graft limb thrombectomy using a Fogarty balloon catheter and simultaneously employing an endarterectomy ring stripper to dislodge tenaciously adherent fibrinous material and thrombotic plug. As the superficial femoral artery was generally occluded, usually a good outflow was achieved by profundaplasty in 101 cases (55.5%) or direct bypass (interposition graft), to a more distal segment of the profunda femoris artery in 55 cases (30.2%). Concomitant popliteal or tibial revascularization was done in the remaining 26 cases (14.3%) when pre-operative or intra-operative findings suggested an inadequate collateral network through the profunda femoris artery. Early re-occlusion, which occurred in 14 cases (7.6%), generally due to insufficient outflow, was corrected by additional intervention in 7 cases (3.8%), while 7 legs were amputated for extensive atherosclerotic disease. Six patients died giving a mortality rate of 3.3%. This low rate in a high risk population is probably related to our policy of operating under loco-regional anaesthesia. Long term results, with a patency rate of 62.0% at 3 years and 60.2% at 5 years (life table method), prove that this operation is a durable procedure for correction of graft limb thrombosis. 
4	Diet, smoking, and alcohol: influence on coronary heart disease risk. The Framingham study on coronary heart disease (CHD) has shown that life-style, particularly diet, smoking, and alcohol consumption, has a great impact on the incidence of CHD. Blood lipoproteins, rather than total blood cholesterol, have been found to be more accurate predictors of CHD risk. Blood triglyceride, previously considered to have little bearing on CHD risk, was found to have a negative impact in many cases. A population subgroup with high triglyceride greater than or equal to 1.7 mmol/L (greater than or equal to 150 mg/dL), low high-density lipoprotein less than or equal to 1.04 mmol/L (less than or equal to 40 mg/dL), increased insulin resistance, and a higher incidence of diabetes mellitus has been found to be at increased risk for CHD. Diet intervention trials have shown that a reduction in total cholesterol and saturated fat consumption produced reduction in CHD incidence proportionate to the fall in cholesterol. Cigarette smoking increased CHD risk moderately; those who smoked one pack per day had twice the risk of nonsmokers. Alcohol consumption actually lowered CHD incidence in the Framingham study; however, when alcohol consumption was greater than two drinks per day, a rise in mortality from cancer and stroke was observed. 
1	Multimodality therapy for advanced and recurrent vulvar squamous cell carcinoma. A pilot project. From 1985 to 1989 eight women with advanced or recurrent vulvar carcinoma were treated at the Women's Cancer Center of the University of Minnesota Hospital and Clinic. Each received a combination of 5-fluorouracil, mitomycin C and cisplatin during radiotherapy. Five of the eight women who underwent posttreatment radical vulvectomy had acceptable operative morbidity. Six patients experienced a complete clinical response. Of them, one had microscopic residual disease in the surgical specimen. One patient with recurrent vulvar carcinoma experienced progression of disease on therapy. One death was attributable to chemotherapy toxicity, and two patients died of intercurrent disease. The overall survival rate at 27 months was 33%. This multimodality approach to the treatment of advanced vulvar carcinoma should be considered when designing a therapeutic approach to treating extensive or resistant vulvar carcinoma. 
5	Selective impairment of memory and visual perception in splenial tumours. The neuropsychological abnormalities found in 9 patients with tumours involving the splenium of the corpus callosum are described. The outstanding features of their cognitive deficits were a severe memory deficit and visual perception impairment in the presence of relatively intact intellect. It is argued that (1) the amnesia is due to damage to the fornix where that structure is closely applied to the splenium and that it is the result of a disconnection between the frontal and temporal lobes, although the possibility that damage to more than one structure, for example, retrosplenial cortex and fornix, cannot be excluded; (2) there is a dual pathway for visual object recognition, one of which passes directly to the dominant hemisphere for semantic analysis and the other via the nondominant hemisphere for prior perceptual analysis. Further, it is postulated that there is a subcortical as well as a callosal route between the hemispheres that is important for visual object recognition. 
4	Nifedipine protects the heart from the acute deleterious effects of cocaine if administered before but not after cocaine. BACKGROUND. We tested the hypothesis that nifedipine, a calcium channel blocker, could ameliorate the toxic effects of cocaine on the myocardium. METHODS AND RESULTS. In an initial protocol, anesthetized dogs were pretreated with nifedipine or saline and then administered cocaine (10 mg/kg, i.v. bolus). Coronary blood flow, heart rate, mean arterial pressure, and the first derivation of left ventricular pressure (dP/dt) were measured at baseline, 2 minutes, and 15 minutes after cocaine administration. Nifedipine pretreatment prevented the early cocaine-induced decrease in coronary blood flow and improved left ventricular dP/dt compared with untreated control animals. After cocaine, ejection fraction fell in the saline group to 37 +/- 3% but increased in the nifedipine group to 59 +/- 4% (p less than 0.05). In a second protocol, vehicle or intravenous nifedipine was administered after an infusion of cocaine (10 mg/kg). In contrast to pretreatment, there was no significant improvement in left ventricular function or coronary blood flow in nifedipine-treated versus control animals. Data from the study also suggested that cocaine acts directly on the myocardium. Within seconds of cocaine bolus administration, coronary blood flow in control animals increased to a peak level 59 +/- 14% higher than before cocaine and left ventricular dP/dt decreased by 23 +/- 5%, providing evidence that cocaine causes direct depression of myocardial function independent of a decrease in myocardial blood flow. CONCLUSIONS. We conclude that nifedipine administered as a pretreatment protects against the depression of myocardial function and decrease in coronary blood flow caused by acute cocaine administration. However, when nifedipine is given after cocaine, no improvement is seen. Cocaine has a direct negative inotropic effect on the heart that is independent of a decrease in coronary blood flow. 
1	Retrovirus from human T-cell leukemia virus type I-associated myelopathy is the same strain as a prototype human T-cell leukemia virus type I. A retrovirus was isolated from a T-cell line that was established from lymphocytes in the cerebrospinal fluid of a patient with human T-cell leukemia virus type I-associated myelopathy (HAM), and its genome was sequenced. The nucleotide sequence of the 3' half of the total genome was identical in 99.5% of the nucleotides to that of the prototype human T-cell leukemia virus type I that was derived from a patient with adult T-cell leukemia. These results indicate that the same retrovirus human T-cell leukemia virus type I is associated with both a neurological disease, HAM, and a lymphoproliferative disease, adult T-cell leukemia. 
1	Prospective follow-up for malignant melanoma in patients with atypical-mole (dysplastic-nevus) syndrome. A total of 357 white patients who had melanocytic nevi that fulfilled the clinical criteria for the "classic" atypical-mole (dysplastic-nevus) syndrome (100 or more melanocytic nevi; one or more melanocytic nevi 8 mm or larger in diameter; and, one or more melanocytic nevi with atypical features) were followed for the development of cutaneous malignant melanomas. Seventeen patients (4.8%) developed malignant melanomas during an average follow-up period of 49 months. One patient developed two malignant melanomas. Eight of the malignant melanomas detected were in situ and ten were invasive melanomas (less than 0.86 mm in Breslow thickness), implying an excellent prognosis. The number of malignant melanomas detected in these patients exceeded significantly the number expected to occur in age- and sex-matched white controls. All groups were shown to have an increased risk for the development of malignant melanomas. Total-body photographs were helpful in detecting changes in size, shape, and color that led to the diagnosis of malignant melanoma. These data support the concept that patients with this readily regionalized clinical presentation of classic atypical-mole syndrome are at an increased risk for malignant melanomas and, therefore, should be examined regularly. 
1	The pharmacokinetics of plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 in the rabbit. The pharmacokinetics of the activated and latent forms of plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1) isolated from HT1080 fibrosarcoma cells (HT1080 PAI-1) and a nonglycosylated form of human PAI-1 isolated from a yeast expression system (rPAI-1) were followed in the rabbit. As assessed by an immunologic assay specific for human PAI-1, guanidine HCI activated HT1080 PAI-1 and rPAI-1 entered the total plasma volume following intravenous bolus administration and exhibited a biphasic clearance pattern. The t1/2s of HT1080 PAI-1 for the initial and beta phases equalled 6.0 and 24.8 minutes, respectively. The t1/2s of rPAI-1 for the initial and beta phases equalled 8.8 and 34.0 minutes, respectively. Similar results were obtained by measuring PAI-1 activity in plasma and with trace amounts of 125I-rPAI-1, suggesting that the above pharmacokinetic behavior could also apply to endogenous PAI-1. The liver was the main site of rPAI-1 clearance. Unactivated, latent PAI-1 exhibited a very different pharmacokinetic profile. Over 80% of latent rPAI-1 cleared from the circulation within 10 minutes (t1/2 = 1.7 minutes). The difference in clearance behavior between activated and latent PAI-1 may be related to the ability of activated PAI-1, but not latent PAI-1, to rapidly form high-molecular-weight complexes with plasma binding factors which were observed in vitro and in vivo. Because PAI-1 could potentially tilt the fibrinolytic balance toward a prothrombotic state, its rapid clearance may represent an important control mechanism governing the circulating levels of this key component of the fibrinolytic pathway. 
1	The interplay of local and distant control in the cure of cervical cancer. From 1978 to 1986, 183 women with cervical cancer received definitive radiation therapy after extraperitoneal surgical staging. Relapse-free rates were strong functions of pelvic lymph node metastases and cervical size. The recurrence distribution consisted of 4% isolated local, 13% isolated distant, and 17% combined local and distant failures. With the assumption of independent local and distant failure probabilities, Suit et al.'s method was extended to assess potential improvement in cure attainable with perfect local and distant control, yielding local (LSA) and distant (DSA) survival advantages of 17% and 28%. Various subsets of clinical stage, cervical size, pelvic node metastases, periaortic metastases, and peritoneal metastases had LSA from 12% to 27% and DSA from 12% to 71%. For any prognostic group, LSA never exceeded DSA, showing that effective systemic therapy would have a greater impact on improving survival than would advances in local and regional tumor control. Therapeutic implications and limitations of the extended LSA-DSA model are discussed. This form of analysis can be used to guide the intensity of local and distant treatment to maximize the cure of the patient with cancer. 
5	Desensitization in the management of vancomycin hypersensitivity. Vancomycin is the preferred antimicrobial agent in the treatment of methicillin-resistant staphylococcal infections. One of the well-known hypersensitivity reactions to this agent is the "red-man syndrome," which is believed to involve drug-induced histamine release in certain individuals. Although rate and/or dose reductions may be effective in some cases, some hypersensitivity reactions necessitate the discontinuation of vancomycin. In this article one patient is described who developed vancomycin-associated reactions consistent with the red-man syndrome despite having tolerated vancomycin administration previously. This case was managed by sequential increments in vancomycin administration over several days that allowed for therapeutic doses of the drug to be administered. Prior to desensitization, vancomycin administration at a lowered rate and dose was unsuccessfully attempted, despite the presence of combination antihistamine therapy. A loss of skin prick test reactivity to vancomycin was demonstrated after successful desensitization. This desensitization method may be useful in managing certain refractory cases of vancomycin hypersensitivity. 
2	Air in the fissure for the ligamentum teres: new sign of intraperitoneal air on plain radiographs. In each of four patients in whom an acute spontaneous pneumoperitoneum developed, a vertically directed area of hyperlucency in the right upper quadrant was seen on radiographs of the abdomen obtained with the patient supine. This finding, which appeared in the absence of other characteristic signs of free air on plain radiographs and which, to the authors' knowledge, has not been previously recognized, represented intraperitoneal gas confined to the fissure for the ligamentum teres (FLT). The location of the hyperlucent area was confirmed with computed tomography or laparotomy in each patient. The distinctive configuration of air in the FLT is a subtle but reliable indicator of pneumoperitoneum. 
3	Nasal midline masses in infants and children. Dermoids, encephaloceles, and gliomas. Nasal dermoids, gliomas, and encephaloceles are uncommon congenital lesions that result from aberrant embryologic development. We have treated 46 children with these nasal lesions. In view of the potential intracranial connection, patients are at risk for intracranial infection, and early surgical correction is thus imperative. Neuroimaging studies may help to predict intracranial involvement. 
4	Efficacy of ibopamine in the treatment of heart failure. Loss of myocardial contractility, reflexly enhanced vasoconstriction, and neuroendocrine excitation are the pathophysiologic hallmarks of low-output heart failure. Drugs that counter both consequences afford considerable therapeutic potential in retarding and perhaps even in staying the consequences of the syndrome. Ibopamine possesses such potential through its unique ability to stimulate both dopaminergic- and beta-adrenoreceptors in the heart and circulatory system. Stimulation of dopaminergic- receptors and beta 2-adrenoreceptors results in vasodilatation in all regional vascular territories. beta 2-Adrenoreceptor agonist activity also affords mild positive inotropic activity in the heart, whereas stimulation of presynaptic dopaminergic- receptors (DA2) attenuates the increased sympathetic neural outflow. The drug also suppresses the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system in addition to having a direct natriuretic activity. The pharmacodynamic effects of ibopamine, exerted through its metabolite epinine, are translated into measurable therapeutic benefits in patients with chronic heart failure. The increase in peripheral blood flow induced in all regional vascular territories, including the kidneys, is associated with increased cardiac output and stroke volume and reduction in left ventricular pressure work, wall stress, and myocardial oxygen consumption. Plasma norepinephrine, angiotensin, and aldosterone are also reduced, and renal sodium excretion is enhanced. These hemodynamic and neuroendocrine activities, which are not subject to tolerance during sustained administration of the drug, are accompanied by clinically significant improvement in symptoms, exercise tolerance, and the New York Heart Association classification of disability. More important, no proarrhythmic effects have been observed during sustained treatment, and the minimal side effects observed during long-term treatment enhance the safety profile of the drug. 
1	Dietary fats and cancer. Evidence relating dietary fat to cancer at sites such as the breast and colon is provided by experiments showing that animals fed high-fat diets develop cancer at these sites more readily than do animals fed low-fat diets and by epidemiological data from different countries showing strong positive correlations between cancer incidence and mortality, and level of dietary fat. Experiments on animals have indicated that polyunsaturated vegetable oils promote cancer more effectively than do saturated fats or polyunsaturated fish oils, whereas in the epidemiological data, total dietary fat correlates with cancer incidence and mortality at least as well as does any particular type of fat. Case-control and cohort studies have not shown strong indications of a relationship between dietary fat and cancer, perhaps because of methodological difficulties inherent in such studies. The weight of evidence continues to indicate that long-term adherence to a low-fat diet can reduce the risk of some common types of cancer. 
5	Peripheral arterial vasodilation hypothesis of sodium and water retention in pregnancy: implications for pathogenesis of preeclampsia-eclampsia. Primary peripheral arterial vasodilation with relative underfilling of the arterial circulation occurs in early pregnancy and leads to several consequences, including decreased systolic and diastolic blood pressures, enhanced cardiac output secondary to afterload reduction, stimulation of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone axis, nonosmotic stimulation of thirst and vasopressin release, and renal sodium and water retention with expansion of the extracellular fluid and plasma volume compartments. These are events known to occur in all states of arterial vasodilation. Pregnancy has, however, several unique features. Primary arterial vasodilation generally is associated with no change or a decrease in renal blood flow and glomerular filtration rate and failure to escape from the sodium-retaining effects of aldosterone. In early pregnancy, renal blood flow and glomerular filtration rate increase by 30-50% in parallel with the peripheral arterial vasodilation but before plasma volume expansion. No known vasodilator exhibits such a profound effect on renal hemodynamics. Vasodilating prostaglandins may contribute to, but cannot explain, this remarkable enhancement of renal hemodynamics in early pregnancy. Therefore, a highly potent, as yet undefined, systemic and renal vasodilator must be unique to pregnancy. The increased glomerular filtration rate and filtered sodium load with enhanced distal tubular sodium delivery allows escape from aldosterone, an effect not observed in other states of arterial underfilling. This vasodilator may also account, at least in part, for the vascular resistance to angiotensin known to occur in normal pregnancy. This hypothesis for the normal physiology of pregnancy sets the stage for understanding the pathogenesis of preeclampsia-eclampsia. 
5	Results of primary angioplasty for acute myocardial infarction in patients with multivessel coronary artery disease. The influence of multivessel coronary artery disease on the outcome of reperfusion therapy for myocardial infarction has not been fully characterized. Direct coronary angioplasty without antecedent thrombolytic therapy was performed during evolving myocardial infarction in 285 patients with multivessel coronary artery disease at 5.2 +/- 4.2 h after the onset of chest pain. Two vessel disease was present in 163 patients (57%) and three vessel disease in 122 (43%). An anterior infarct was present in 123 patients (43%), cardiogenic shock in 33 (12%) and age greater than or equal to 70 years in 59 (21%). Angioplasty of the infarct-related vessel was successful in 256 patients (90%), including 92% with two vessel and 88% with three vessel disease (p = NS). Emergency bypass surgery was needed in six patients (2%). In-hospital death occurred in 33 patients (12%), including 13 with two vessel and 20 with three vessel disease (p less than 0.05). The mortality rate was only 4% in the subgroup of 101 patients who met entry criteria for thrombolytic trials. The in-hospital mortality rate was 45% in patients in shock and 7% in patients not in shock (p less than 0.01). Logistic regression analysis identified shock and age greater than or equal to 70 years as independently associated with in-hospital death. In 135 patients who underwent predischarge left ventriculography, global ejection fraction increased from 50% to 57% (p less than 0.001) and regional wall motion in the infarct zone improved in 59% of patients. Follow-up data were available in 251 patients (99%) at a mean of 35 +/- 19 months. 
4	Echocardiographic left ventricular mass and electrolyte intake predict arterial hypertension. OBJECTIVE: To identify predictors of arterial hypertension. PATIENTS: One hundred thirty-two normotensive adults from a large employed population. METHODS: Echocardiography, standard blood tests, and 24-hour urine collection, at baseline and after an interval of 3 to 6 years (mean, 4.7 +/- 0.8 years). RESULTS: At follow-up, 15 subjects (11%; 7 men, 8 women) had a systolic blood pressure greater than 140 mm Hg or a diastolic blood pressure greater than 90 mm Hg or both (mean, 143 +/- 7 and 87 +/- 6 mm Hg, respectively). At baseline, subjects who developed hypertension had a greater left ventricular mass index than those who did not (92 +/- 25 compared with 77 +/- 19 g/m2 body surface area; P less than 0.005) and higher 24-hour urinary sodium/potassium excretion ratio (3.6 +/- 1.7 compared with 2.6 +/- 1.4; P less than 0.04); there were no differences in race, initial age, systolic or diastolic blood pressure, coronary risk factors, or plasma renin activity. The likelihood of developing hypertension rose from 3% in the lowest quartile of sex-adjusted left ventricular mass index to 24% in the highest quartile (P less than 0.005); a parallel trend was less regular for quartiles of the sodium/potassium excretion ratio (P less than 0.04). In multivariate analyses, follow-up systolic pressures in all subjects and in the 117 who remained normotensive were predicted by initial age, systolic blood pressure, black race, and sex-adjusted left ventricular mass index; final diastolic blood pressure was predicted by its initial value, plasma triglyceride levels, urinary sodium/potassium ratio, low renin activity, black race, and plasma glucose level. CONCLUSIONS: Echocardiographic left ventricular mass in normotensive adults is directly related to the risk for developing subsequent hypertension. Left ventricular mass improves prediction of future systolic pressure, whereas diastolic pressure is more related to initial metabolic status. Black race is also an independent determinant of higher subsequent blood pressure. 
3	Lidocaine potentiation of cocaine toxicity. STUDY HYPOTHESIS: The toxic effects of cocaine are enhanced in the presence of lidocaine. STUDY POPULATION: Male Sprague-Dawley rats weighing 200 to 300 g. METHODS: Animals received intraperitoneal injections of cocaine (10, 20, 35, or 50 mg/kg), lidocaine (30 or 40 mg/kg), or a combination of all doses of cocaine given simultaneously with 30 or 40 mg/kg lidocaine. The incidence and time to seizure and death were recorded in these groups and compared by chi 2 and analysis of variance analyses, respectively. RESULTS: At doses of 30 or 40 mg/kg, lidocaine does not induce seizures or death. The effect of simultaneous injection of both cocaine and lidocaine was to dramatically increase the incidence of both seizures and death over that of cocaine alone. The incidence of seizures in animals receiving 35 mg/kg cocaine alone was 10%; this increased to 50% and 80% with the addition of 30 and 40 mg/kg lidocaine, respectively (P less than or equal to .05; P less than or equal to .01). Death did not occur in animals receiving 35 mg/kg cocaine alone; the addition of 30 and 40 mg/kg lidocaine resulted in death in 30% and 60% of animals, respectively (P less than or equal to .01 each group). Similarly, in rats receiving 50 mg/kg cocaine, the incidence of death increased from 0% to 60% and 80% with 30 and 40 mg/kg lidocaine, respectively (P less than or equal to .01). CONCLUSION: In the rat, overall toxicity of cocaine is significantly increased with simultaneous exposure to lidocaine. 
1	Mucin production by human colonic carcinoma cells correlates with their metastatic potential in animal models of colon cancer metastasis. Patients with mucinous colorectal cancers characteristically present with advanced disease, however, the relationship between mucin production by colon cancer cells and their metastatic potential remains unclear. We therefore sought to define the relationship between mucin production by human colon cancer cells and metastatic ability by employing animal models of colon cancer metastasis. LS LiM 6, a colon carcinoma cell line with high liver metastasizing ability during cecal growth in nude mice produced twofold more metabolically labeled intracellular mucin and secreted four- to fivefold more mucin into the culture medium compared to poorly metastatic parental line LS174T. This was accompanied by a similar elevation in poly(A)+ RNA detected by blot hybridization with a human intestinal mucin cDNA probe, and increases in mucin core carbohydrate antigens determined immunohistochemically. Variants of LS174T selected for high (HM 7) or low (LM 12) mucin synthesizing capacity also yielded metastases after cecal growth and colonized the liver after splenic-portal injection in proportion to their ability to produce mucin. Inhibition of mucin glycosylation by the arylglycoside benzyl-alpha-N-acetyl-galactosamine greatly reduced liver colonization after splenic-portal injection of the tumor cells. These data suggest that mucin production by human colon cancer cells correlates with their metastatic potential and affects their ability to colonize the liver in experimental model systems. 
5	Varicella with delayed hemiplegia. We report 4 children who developed acute hemiplegia 7 weeks to 4 months after varicella infection. In 2 patients, carotid angiography demonstrated segmental narrowing and occlusion of the middle cerebral artery. Their clinical and angiographic features were similar to those associated with contralateral hemiplegia after herpes zoster ophthalmicus, the pathogenesis of which comprises cerebral angiitis due to varicella zoster viral infection. We believe that our patients had the same pathogenesis. In a survey of infectious diseases in our region, the frequency of varicella with delayed hemiparesis was roughly 1:6,500 varicella patients. 
1	Analysis of prognostic factors and clinicopathological staging of thymoma The prognostic value of four clinical variables (age and sex of patients, association with myasthenia gravis, and clinical stage) and histological type was analyzed in 83 consecutive patients with thymoma, histologically classified as cortical, medullary, and mixed. Age, sex, and association with myasthenia gravis did not prove to represent significant prognostic factors; clinical stage and histological type, on the contrary, had a highly significant prognostic value (p less than 0.001). A model of clinicopathological staging, based on both clinical stage and histological type, in which three major prognostic groups are considered is proposed. The degree of significance of this model is higher (p less than 0.0001) than that of clinical stage and histological type considered individually; its validity is further supported by the results of multivariate analysis according to the Cox regression model (p = 0.0001). We think it represents a prognostically valuable approach to the problem of management of thymoma. 
3	Location of port-wine stains and the likelihood of ophthalmic and/or central nervous system complications. Of 310 patients with port-wine stains, 68% had more than one dermatome involved; 85% had unilateral and 15% had a bilateral distribution of their port-wine stain. At the time of examination, 8% of all patients with trigeminal port-wine stains had evidence of eye and/or central nervous system (CNS) involvement. Extensive involvement, with port-wine stain over the trunk and extremities as well as the head and neck, was observed in 12%. Patients who did not have port-wine stains on the areas served by branches V1 and V2 of the trigeminal nerve had no signs or symptoms of eye and/or CNS involvement. Port-wine stains of the eyelids, bilateral distribution of the birthmark, and unilateral port-wine stains involving all three branches of the trigeminal nerve were associated with a significantly higher likelihood of having eye and/or CNS complications. Twenty-four percent of those with bilateral trigeminal nerve port-wine stains had eye and/or CNS involvement compared with 6% of those with unilateral lesions. All those who had eye and/or CNS complications had port-wine stain involvement of the eyelids; in 91% both upper and lower eyelids were involved, whereas in 9% only the lower eyelid was involved. None of those with upper eyelid port-wine stains alone had eye and/or CNS complications. In addition, 3 (75%) of the 4 subjects with seizures alone had bilateral port-wine stain involvement. A third group, these with unilateral V1, V2, and V3 port-wine stains, had eye and/or CNS complications in 3 (19%) of 16 subjects. 
5	Warm heart surgery. Hypothermia is widely acknowledged to be the fundamental component of myocardial protection during cardiac operations. Although it prolongs the period of ischemic arrest by reducing oxygen demands, hypothermia is associated with a number of major disadvantages, including its detrimental effects on enzymatic function, energy generation, and cellular integrity. We hypothesized that the ideal protected state of the heart would be electromechanically arrested and perfused with blood, that is, aerobic arrest. Under these conditions the fundamental need for hypothermia becomes questionable. We have developed a novel approach to myocardial protection during cardiac operations based on these concepts, in which the chemically arrested heart is perfused continuously with blood and maintained at 37 degrees C. In 121 consecutive coronary bypass procedures we have compared this approach with a historical cohort of 133 consecutive patients treated with hypothermic cardioplegia. Perioperative myocardial infarction was significantly less prevalent (1.7% versus 6.8%; p less than 0.05) in the warm cardioplegic group, as was the use of the intraaortic balloon pump (0.9% versus 9.0%; p less than 0.005) and the prevalence of low output syndrome (13.5% versus 3.3%; p less than 0.005). Cardiac output immediately after bypass was significantly higher than before bypass (3.1 +/- 0.9 versus 4.9 +/- 1.0 L/min; p less than 0.001) only in the warm cardioplegia group. Furthermore, the heartbeat in 99.2% of patients treated with continuous warm cardioplegia converted to normal sinus rhythm spontaneously after removal of the aortic crossclamp compared with only 10.5% of the hypothermic group. The time from removal of the aortic crossclamp to discontinuation of cardiopulmonary bypass (i.e., reperfusion time) was significantly shorter in the warm cardioplegia group (11 +/- 4.3 versus 27 +/- 5.6 minutes; p less than 0.001). Our results suggest that continuous normothermic blood cardioplegia is safe and effective. Conceptually, this represents a new approach to the problem of maintaining excellent myocardial preservation during cardiac operations. 
4	Effect of drug and diet treatment of mild hypertension on diastolic blood pressure. The TAIM Research Group. The Trial of Antihypertensive Interventions and Management is a multicenter randomized trial designed to examine the diastolic blood pressure response of various combinations of pharmacological and dietary interventions in the treatment of mild hypertension (diastolic blood pressure 90-100 mm Hg). Eight hundred and seventy-eight participants at 110-160% of ideal weight were randomly allocated to nine drug/diet treatment groups receiving either a placebo, chlorthalidone (25 mg), or atenolol (50 mg), combined with a usual, a weight loss, or a low sodium/high potassium diet. The primary outcome was diastolic blood pressure change from baseline to 6 months. Seven hundred and eighty-seven participants had follow-up data. The mean baseline diastolic blood pressure was 93.8 mm Hg; 55.9% of the participants were male, and the weight loss diet group lost an average of 4.7 kg. Multiple comparisons were accounted for in the analysis. A significantly greater lowering of diastolic blood pressure (12.4 mm Hg) was achieved in the atenolol group compared with either the low sodium/high potassium diet group (7.9 mm Hg, p = 0.001) or weight loss group (8.8 mm Hg, p = 0.006). Adding weight loss to chlorthalidone significantly enhanced blood pressure lowering (15.1 mm Hg) when compared with the diuretic alone (10.8 mm Hg, p = 0.002), but adding a low sodium/high potassium diet (12.2 mm Hg, p = 0.029) did not. In the short-term treatment of mild hypertension where diastolic blood pressure is the sole consideration, drugs outperform diet, and weight loss is beneficial, especially with diuretics. 
5	Inflammatory myofibroblastic tumor (plasma cell granuloma). Clinicopathologic study of 20 cases with immunohistochemical and ultrastructural observations. Twenty cases of inflammatory myofibroblastic tumor (IMT) were studied; 19 involved the lung and 1 the esophagus only. The patients' ages ranged from 3 to 72 years. There were 9 males and 11 females. Involvement of a bronchus was seen in one case and of mediastinal structures in four. Chest pain and dyspnea were common symptoms; eight patients were asymptomatic. Seven patients underwent lobectomy, 12 local excision, and 1 biopsy alone. The lesions were nonencapsulated and ranged from 1.2 to 15 cm. Various proportions of plasma cells, histiocytes, and spindle cells were observed; the latter corresponded ultrastructurally to fibroblasts and myofibroblasts, were immunoreactive for vimentin and actin and focally for desmin, and were negative for epithelial markers. Plasma cells were polyclonal for light chains. One patient had two recurrences, and in one case a large pleural IMT was found eight years after the excision of a similar lesion in the lung. All patients with follow-up (ten) were well as long as ten years after the diagnosis (average, 3.7 years). 
4	Indications for distal arterial reconstruction in the presence of palpable pedal pulses. Eight patients with severe pedal ischemia in the presence of palpable foot pulses are described. All had atherosclerosis, and seven patients also had diabetes. There were two anatomic patterns of disease, including supramalleolar obstruction with reconstitution of pulsatile flow in three patients and segmental occlusion of the pedal vessels in five. All patients underwent arterial reconstructive surgery. Patency was sustained in six patients, with limb salvage in five and below-knee amputation in one patient for persistent necrosis and infection of an open amputation. Of the two eventual bypass failures, a transmetatarsal amputation continued to heal in one patient, and the other required amputation below the knee. Palpable pedal pulses and satisfactory ankle/brachial indexes did not rule out the presence of surgically correctable distal arterial occlusive disease. Therefore arteriography is indicated in any patient with persistent forefoot ischemia that fails to respond to conservative measures. The safety and patency of the distal reconstructive procedures performed in this series suggest that salvage of weight-bearing tissue and rapid healing, as well as limb salvage, are legitimate indications for revascularization. 
3	Treatment of leptomeningeal carcinomatosis with continuous intraventricular infusion of recombinant interleukin-2. A 42-year-old man developed leptomeningeal carcinomatosis 6 years after treatment of a malignant melanoma. He was treated with two courses of recombinant interleukin-2, administered as a continuous intraventricular infusion (6 X 10E5 U/24 h) during 5 days. During the first day of the first course he also received 5 X 10E9 lymphokine-activated killer cells intraventricularly. This gave rise to a severe elevation of intracranial pressure, with headaches and meningismus. During the second course no LAK cells were administered. This course was tolerated much better. The neurological status did not change during the treatment. Recombinant interleukin-2 levels were maintained at about 300 U/mL during both courses. 
4	Palliative repair of aortic atresia associated with tricuspid atresia and transposition of the great arteries. Successful palliative repair of aortic atresia and hypoplastic aortic arch associated with tricuspid atresia in a neonate is described. The repair consisted of reconstruction of the hypoplastic aortic arch with an equine pericardial patch, division of the patient ductus arteriosus, connection of the pulmonary artery to the aorta, implantation of the proximal part of the ascending aorta into the main pulmonary artery, and anastomosis of a polytetrafluoroethylene graft 5 mm in diameter between the right ventricular outflow tract and the central pulmonary artery, which was transferred anteriorly to the main pulmonary artery. 
3	Progressing cerebral infarction in relation to plasma glucose in gerbils. We studied neurologic morbidity and its evolution during hyperglycemia induced immediately after permanent unilateral common carotid artery ligation in Mongolian gerbils. A total of 60 animals were divided into five groups: one experiencing severe hyperglycemia for 1 hour after the onset of ischemia (brief hyperglycemia group, n = 13), a normoglycemic control group for the brief hyperglycemia group (n = 12), a group with severe hyperglycemia for 4 hours after the onset of ischemia (prolonged hyperglycemia group, n = 11), a normoglycemic control group for the prolonged hyperglycemia group (n = 13), and a hyperosmolar normoglycemic control group for the prolonged hyperglycemia group (n = 11). Neurologic morbidity and mortality were higher in the two hyperglycemic groups than in the three normoglycemic control groups. The neurologic deficit progressed according to the duration of severe hyperglycemia. In the three normoglycemic control groups neurologic status stabilized 120 minutes after the onset of ischemia, in the brief hyperglycemia group stabilization occurred at 210 minutes, and in the prolonged hyperglycemia group neurologic deficit progressed for approximately 360 minutes, coinciding with the death of all but one gerbil, in which the neurologic deficit remained stable until death 23 hours after ischemia. We suggest that hyperglycemia is another cause of progressing cerebral infarction. 
5	Acute myeloid leukemia and background radiation in an expanded case-referent study. A case-referent study that investigated possible associations between environmental and occupational exposures and acute myeloid leukemia was performed on 86 cases and 172 referents, all of whom were living. Exposure information was obtained through a questionnaire mailed to each subject. An association was found between time spent in concrete buildings at home and work and leukemia morbidity. In addition, extensive x-ray examinations that occurred more than 5 y prior to diagnosis were more common among cases than referents. 
5	Progression of native coronary artery disease at 10 years: insights from a randomized study of medical versus surgical therapy for angina. Repeat coronary angiography was performed in 42 patients 10 years after randomization to medical (n = 21) or surgical (n = 21) therapy for chronic angina. The native coronary arteries were classified into 15 angiographic segments and 3 arterial trunks for analysis of progression of coronary artery disease. The incidence rate of disease progression in coronary segments was 24% and 28% in medically and surgically treated patients, respectively (p = NS). Grafted segments showed a 38% rate of disease progression, which was higher than the 18% rate of for nongrafted segments (p less than 0.001) and the overall rate of 24% for medically treated patients (p less than 0.01). Similarly, 29 (94%) of 31 grafted arteries exhibited disease progression compared with 19 (59%) of 32 nongrafted arteries (p less than 0.01) and 42 (67%) of 63 arteries in medically treated patients (p less than 0.01). In grafted vessels, disease progression occurred more often in arteries proximal (84%) to the anastomosis than in arteries distal (16%) to graft insertion (p less than 0.001). Progression occurred in 46% of proximal segments compared with 23% of distal segments (p less than 0.02). Progression was seen in 23 (55%) of 43 segments with an occluded graft compared with 30 (31%) of 96 segments with a patent graft (p less than 0.02). Ten years after randomization, medically and surgically treated patients showed a comparable rate of disease progression in coronary segments. However, surgical therapy appeared to significantly accelerate atherosclerotic progression in the grafted vessels, especially in the proximal portions. Occluded grafts also correlated with an adverse effect on disease progression. 
5	The natural history of ultraviolet radiation-induced herpes simplex labialis and response to therapy with peroral and topical formulations of acyclovir. The lips of 196 patients with a history of sun-induced herpes labialis were exposed to experimental ultraviolet radiation (UVR) and treated with acyclovir (ACV) or placebo at different times and by different routes. Of 98 placebo recipients, 39 (40%) developed 43 lesions inside or within 10 mm of the irradiated zone. The temporal distribution of lesions was bimodal. 11 (26%) occurring within 48 h (immediate) and 32 (72%) 2-7 days after UVR exposure (delayed). Prophylactic peroral ACV begun 7 days before or 5 min after UVR prevented the development of the delayed but not the immediate lesions (P less than .001). When peroral ACV was started 48 h after UVR, delayed lesions developed but were less severe (P = .01-.05). Prophylactic topical ACV begun 5 min after UVR did not reduce lesion frequency or severity. ACV therapy can be efficacious, but some rapidly developing lesions are unresponsive to treatment. This suggests that more than one process may contribute to the pathogenesis of herpes labialis. 
3	Health locus of control, gender differences and adjustment to persistent pain. Locus of control (LOC) beliefs, long thought important in adjustment to persistent pain, were studied among 160 subjects (67 males and 93 females) referred to a comprehensive pain rehabilitation program. The subscale structure of the Multidimensional Health Locus of Control (MHLC) was factorially replicated in our sample. Three unique MHLC profile clusters were identified for both males and females. Among men, cluster assignment was related to age only. The younger male patients reported a stronger internal attributional style. Older male patients relied more heavily on both chance and powerful other factors. Among women, cluster assignment was related to the use of coping strategies. For example, patients with high internal scores only, reflecting a strong internal orientation towards self-management of health care needs, were more likely to utilize Information-Seeking, Self-Blame, and Threat Minimization coping strategies than patients with high scores on both the Internal and Powerful Other factors. It appears that the presence of both Internal and Powerful Other health attributional styles is associated with less frequent use of cognitive self-management techniques. In understanding the LOC scores it is important to rely on pattern analysis of scores. Implications for clinical treatment are discussed. 
4	Metabolic and health complications of obesity. Overnutrition manifested by obesity has emerged as a major health problem in affluent countries. In spite of increased interest in fitness, obesity is on the increase in the United States. This is particularly so among children and adolescents. Although obesity is associated with many risk factors for diseases, the mechanisms whereby it enhances disease risk are not fully understood. Such an understanding is needed to develop strategies for management of these conditions. In this report we suggest that overnutrition produces clinical diseases only in individuals who already possess a metabolic weakness or "defect" in a given system. In the absence of such underlying defects, overnutrition, or obesity, is well tolerated. One of the most common consequences of obesity is dyslipidemia, that is, elevations of very low-density lipoprotein (VLDL) triglycerides and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol and low concentrations of high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol. The major effect of overnutrition on lipoprotein metabolism is to stimulate the production of VLDL. For patients who have an underlying defect in lypolysis of VLDL triglycerides, hypertriglyceridemia will develop in the obese state. For those who have defective clearance of LDL, obesity will accentuate hypercholesterolemia. Both of these effects can be explained by overproduction of VLDL, due to obesity, combined with a genetic defect in clearance of VLDL or LDL. The mechanism whereby obesity causes a lowering of HDL cholesterol is uncertain, although it could enhance removal of HDL by an excess of adipose tissue. Another disease associated with obesity is cholesterol gallstones. The presence of obesity more than doubles the risk for gallstones. Two underlying factors increase the danger for gallstones: a deficiency of hepatic secretion of bile acids and a tendency for formation of cholesterol crystals in bile. Overnutrition promotes the synthesis of whole-body cholesterol, and the only route for excretion of this excess cholesterol is through the biliary tree.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS). 
5	Psychometric and descriptive perspectives of illness impact over the life span. This article describes the development of an instrument that quantifies illness over the course of life. The sample was comprised of 308 women, aged 50 to 70, who were alumnae of a master's program in nursing. Each submitted information concerning illness experienced during each decade of life. Each time period was then rated multidimensionally (Duration, Discomfort, Interference, Threat to Life) to reflect the impact of the various conditions and the means by decade (Decade Impact) were computed. In general, after the first two decades, magnitude of ratings increased with age, indicating greater disease impact. Interrater reliability and internal consistency reliability of the scale were high. Evidence for construct validity included substantial differences between those with and without specific illness conditions, as well as correlations with hospitalization history and health self-ratings. In cluster analysis of patterns across decades, five distinct patterns emerged into which subjects were grouped. 
4	Pharmacologic irreversible narrowing in chronic cerebrovasospasm in rabbits is associated with functional damage. We studied isolated basilar artery segments from a rabbit model of chronic cerebrovasospasm. Autologous blood placed around the basilar artery of rabbits killed 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, or 9 days later caused narrowing of the segments with a biphasic time course. The first (immediate) phase was reversed by intra-arterial papaverine; the second phase exhibited an increasing component of narrowing that was papaverine-insensitive. Based on the passive force/length curves, basilar artery segments became increasingly stiff over 9 days. By contrast, the segments' contractility decreased. Responses of the basilar artery segments were greater over the first few days, but then became less than that of saline-injected controls. Contractions in response to norepinephrine and potassium were reduced. Endothelium-based acetylcholine-induced vasodilation progressively diminished, as did the response to sympathetic nerve stimulation. There was a negative correlation between artery wall stiffness and contractility. The papaverine-insensitive component of angiographic narrowing correlated directly with loss of contractility and with artery wall stiffness. These results are consistent with the conclusion that increased artery wall stiffness is a primary determining factor in the arterial narrowing of chronic cerebrovasospasm. 
2	Extracorporeal piezoelectric lithotripsy for complicated bile duct stones. Today, common bile duct stones are extracted endoscopically. After endoscopic sphincterotomy, nearly 90% of all stones can be removed with a Dormia basket or a mechanical lithotripter. Problems are encountered if there are larger stones or a duct stenosis. New conservative therapies do serve as an alternative to surgical intervention for those few patients in whom endoscopic measures have failed. Stone fragmentation can be achieved by extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy, and remaining fragments can be removed endoscopically. So far, authors of most reports on the successful disintegration of common bile duct stones used the Dornier lithotripter. Stone localization is thus achieved with x-rays, and the shock waves are generated by an underwater spark discharge. We report on our experiences and results with extracorporeal piezoelectric shock wave lithotripsy (EPL) in 19 patients with complicated bile duct stones. With this lithotripter, stones are visualized by ultrasound, and shock waves are produced by a piezoelectric acoustic generator. Fragmentation was achieved in 84.2%, and complete stone removal in 78.9%. These results show that piezoelectric lithotripsy is also a useful method for the treatment of complicated bile duct stones, as has already been proved for the electrohydraulic- and electromagnetic-generated shock waves systems. However, the renunciation of general anesthesia and the need for analgesia or sedation in only 25% of the treatments render this lithotripter system attractive, especially for elderly and frail patients. 
1	Incidence of prominent corneal nerves in multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2A. We studied the increased visibility of corneal nerves inside an 8-mm diameter central corneal area in 14 patients with multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2A, one patient with multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2B, five patients with nonhereditary medullary thyroid carcinoma, ten patients with anterior keratoconus, and ten normal subjects. We used a grading system (grade 0 through grade 4) for nerve visibility based on slit-lamp biomicroscopic examination and photographic documentation. All 20 normal eyes showed either grade 0 or grade 1, which indicated no pathologic thickening of corneal nerves. Sixteen of the 28 eyes (57%) with multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2A, however, were evaluated as grade 2 or higher, which indicated thickened corneal nerves. The incidence of high nerve visibility in eyes with multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2A was significantly greater compared to normal eyes (P less than .0001), anterior keratoconus (P less than .0001), and nonhereditary medullary thyroid carcinoma (P = .0012). Furthermore, eight of the 28 eyes (29%) with multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2A showed markedly prominent corneal nerves (grade 3 and 4), a prominence similar to those seen in eyes with multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2B. There was no definite relationship among prominent nerve, age of the patient, and occurrence of pheochromocytoma. These findings suggest that over half of all patients with multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2A show corneal nerves pathologically thickened to different degrees. 
1	Mechanical ventilation in medical and neurological diseases: 11 years of experience. Mechanical ventilation (MV) is imperative in many forms of acute respiratory failure (ARF). The aim of this work was to review all episodes of MV in a Medical Intensive Care Unit (MICU) during the 11-year period 1976-1986. Four per cent (n = 1008) of 24,899 admissions to the MICU were treated with MV. The mean age of ventilator-treated patients was 53 +/- 18 years, and obviously it increased during the period of study. The average duration of MV was 4.7 d. MICU mortality, hospital mortality and 2-year mortality rates for patients subjected to MV were 33%, 38% and 46%, respectively. The mortality rate did not change during the study period. Cerebrovascular and malignant diseases carried the highest mortality rates, 75 and 79%, respectively, whereas mortality in patients ventilated because of drug overdose (n = 313) was only 2%. The results of this study confirm previously published findings concerning the outcome of MV, and we conclude that the effects of MV remain discouraging in medical and neurological patients. Improved quality of ventilator therapy and monitoring, as well as continued research directed at the causes of ARF, are equally important in reducing the mortality in ARF. 
2	Piroxicam decreases postirradiation colonic neoplasia in the rat. This study evaluated the effects of the nonsteroidal antiinflammatory agent piroxicam on chronic radiation proctitis in the rat. Forty female Wistar rats received a 2250-cGy dose of irradiation to the distal 2 cm of the colon. Twenty received piroxicam 8.0 mg/kg orally 30 minutes before exposure and 24 hours after exposure; 20 rats served as irradiated controls. All animals were evaluated by colonoscopy 1 and 3 weeks postexposure and every third week until death or killing at 1 year. At killing, colons were removed for light microscopic examination. One year postirradiation results showed no differences in mortality, vascular changes, acute inflammation, colitis cystica profunda, or rectal stricture between the control and piroxicam-treated groups. However, at 1 year postirradiation the control group demonstrated neoplasia in 15 of 19 animals compared with eight of 20 animals in the piroxicam-treated group. The first endoscopic appearance of colonic neoplasm occurred at 15 weeks postirradiation in one control irradiated rat whereas the first evidence of endoscopic neoplasm in the piroxicam-treated group did not occur until 36 weeks postirradiation. Histologic examination documented a tendency toward a greater presence of adenocarcinomas in the control group compared with the piroxicam-treated group. The authors conclude that piroxicam treatment significantly decreased the incidence of colonic neoplasia in general as well as delayed the endoscopic appearance of colonic neoplasia in rats after pelvic irradiation. 
3	Meningiomas involving the clivus: a six-year experience with 41 patients. A series of 41 meningiomas involving the clivus operated on from July 1983 to January 1990 is reported. The presenting symptoms and signs of these patients were similar to those reported previously. All the patients were evaluated by pre- and postoperative thin-section, high-resolution computed tomography using soft tissue and bone algorithms. Most of the patients also underwent magnetic resonance imaging. The regions of the clivus involved by tumor were divided into upper, middle, or lower regions on the basis of anatomical landmarks. The diameter of the tumor was measured in three axes, and a tumor volume and a tumor equivalent diameter were computed to categorize tumors as small, medium, large, or giant types. There were 9 medium, 27 large, and 5 giant tumors in this series. Some simple and some complex operative approaches were employed to effect tumor removal. Large and giant tumors often required more than one operative approach to remove the tumor. Intraoperative technical difficulties included tumor consistency, vascularity, dissection from the brain stem, and vascular and cranial nerve encasement. Postoperative computed tomographic scans documented total excision in 32 patients (78%). Residual tumor remained in the clival or cavernous sinus areas. These patients were either being observed, or were treated with gamma knife radiosurgery. There was one operative death due to pneumonia (2%), and three patients (7%) suffered permanent major neurological changes, presumably due to vascular occlusions in the posterior circulation. In the follow-up period, which ranged from 3 to 76 months, 2 patients (6%) with tumors that had appeared to be totally excised experienced recurrence. These patients were treated by a second operation, alone or in combination with radiation therapy. Two patients who had subtotal excisions (25%) had evidence of regrowth. In 2 patients, tumor growth continued despite gamma knife radiosurgery or external beam radiotherapy. 
2	Acute gastroenteritis in infants under 6 months old. Sixty two babies under the age of 6 months who were admitted with gastroenteritis completed a study of gradual refeeding compared with abrupt refeeding after a period of rehydration. There was no difference in the incidence of recurrence of diarrhoea due to lactose intolerance, effect on weight, or duration of hospital stay. Twenty six babies (42%) had recurrence of diarrhoea after refeeding, all of whom settled with the introduction of a lactose free soya based formula. Well nourished babies under 6 months of age with mild to moderately severe gastroenteritis can be fed immediately with full strength milk feeds after rehydration. The introduction of a lactose free soya based preparation may provide an alternative to repeated attempts at regrading with cows' milk feeds in those patients with lactose intolerance. 
5	GI symptoms, function, and psychophysiological arousal in dysmenorrheic women. In a previous study, gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms and stool characteristics were found to be influenced by menstrual cycle phase. The current study was designed to replicate initial work regarding GI symptoms and stool characteristics and to explore the relationships between GI symptoms, stool characteristics, ovarian hormone levels, and indicators of psychophysiological arousal. Fifty women (dysmenorrheic, N = 22; nondysmenorrheic, N = 28) maintained a daily dairy for recording stool characteristics, GI symptoms, and daily anxiety level. First morning void urine specimens for catecholamine assays and serum samples for ovarian hormone and cortisol determinations were obtained at menses, follicular, and luteal phases. Results showed menstrual cycle-related differences in stool characteristics and report of GI symptoms, with the greatest changes occurring at menses in the total sample. Dysmenorrheic women reported higher levels of all GI symptoms at menses as compared to nondysmenorrheic women. In addition, cycle-related differences in serum cortisol, urine catecholamines, and report of anxiety were also noted, particularly in dysmenorrheic women. However, looser stools and GI symptoms at menses were not correlated with absolute levels of ovarian hormones or indicators of psychophysiological arousal. 
5	Unusual variants of adrenal pseudocysts with intracystic fat, myelolipomatous metaplasia, and metastatic carcinoma. Five previously unreported cases of adrenal pseudocysts are described that demonstrate a wider range of histologic appearances than has been previously recognized in these lesions. One pseudocyst removed from an asymptomatic 59-year-old female contained intracystic nests of cytologically malignant cells of unknown origin. Workup revealed a left breast mass, which on biopsy showed an infiltrating ductal carcinoma with neoplastic cells that were cytologically similar to those found within the cyst contents. Four other pseudocysts are described with variable numbers of intracystic vascular structures and benign adrenal cortical cells. In addition, intracystic mature adipose tissue was observed in all four cases, with myelolipomatous metaplasia found in one. Awareness of the wide histologic variability of these lesions should improve diagnostic accuracy and allow distinction from adrenocortical neoplasia and myelolipoma. 
2	Fatty liver hepatitis (steatohepatitis) and obesity: an autopsy study with analysis of risk factors. Steatohepatitis (fatty liver hepatitis), histologically identical to alcoholic disease, occurs in some obese patients after jejunoileal bypass. A similar lesion occurs rarely in obese patients without bypass surgery, but the risk factors are poorly understood. Hepatic steatosis, steatohepatitis and fibrosis were sought in 351 apparently nonalcoholic patients at autopsy and various risk factors were evaluated. Incidence of steatosis and steatohepatitis correlated with the degree of obesity. Steatohepatitis was found in 18.5% of markedly obese patients and 2.7% of lean patients. Additional risk factors for steatohepatitis were type II diabetes, weight loss in the preterminal period shortly before death and intravenous glucose therapy in the last week of life. Severe fibrosis was found in 13.8% of markedly obese patients and in 6.6% of lean patients; this difference was largely explained by the higher prevalence of diabetes in obese groups. The risk factors defined in this study are known to be associated with abnormalities of free fatty acid metabolism. Obesity, type II diabetes and intravenous glucose therapy are associated with hyperinsulinemia, which may inhibit fatty acid oxidation. Obesity and weight loss increase the presentation of fatty acids to the liver. Similar metabolic changes may occur in obese patients after jejunoileal bypass surgery. Thus this study supports the hypothesis that fatty acids have a role in the hepatocellular necrosis found in some obese individuals. 
5	Benign thyroid adenoma causing recurrent laryngeal nerve palsy in a child. The standard teaching is that only malignant thyroid masses produce recurrent laryngeal nerve palsy. An unusual exception to this rule is reported. 
5	HMPAO-SPECT imaging resembling Alzheimer-type dementia in mitochondrial encephalomyopathy with lactic acidosis and stroke-like episodes (MELAS). Single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) of the brain using hexamethyl propylene amine oxime (HMPAO) was performed in a 37-year-old patient suffering from mitochondrial encephalomyopathy with lactic acidosis and stroke-like episodes (MELAS). Reduced blood flow was observed bilaterally in the parieto-occipital regions (resembling Alzheimer type dementia) and in the right parietal lobe. 
1	New insights into the causes of cancer. Recent advances in molecular biologic analysis have led to major new insights concerning the genetic mechanisms underlying the development of cancer. This article examines the current state of our understanding of the genetic basis underlying the possible mechanisms of carcinogenesis and metastasis. The nature of the genetic lesions found in some cancer-causing genes, cancer-inhibiting genes, growth factor genes, and metastasis genes is discussed, as is the impact that these may have on clinical oncology. 
4	Regeneration of myocardial phosphocreatine in pigs despite continued moderate ischemia. The effects of 1 hour of mild and moderate reductions in coronary blood flow on myocardial high-energy phosphate levels were evaluated. Thirty anesthetized pigs were instrumented with left anterior descending arterial and venous catheters, crystals for instantaneous wall thickness, and a fluid-filled occluder. Measurement of myocardial blood flow was performed with microspheres, and a series of myocardial biopsies also was performed. In 10 pigs, overall coronary blood flow was lowered by 22%, with a fall in subendocardial-to-subepicardial flow ratio from 1.11 to 0.54 and in wall thickening from 33% to 15%. Subendocardial flow fell 48%. Coronary blood flow and thickening were constant during 1 hour of ischemia. Phosphocreatine (mumol/g wet wt) in the subendocardial third of the ischemic zone fell from 7.6 to 3.8 at 5 minutes of ischemia (p less than 0.005 versus control) and returned to normal (7.9) at 60 minutes (p = NS), despite ongoing ischemia. Subendocardial ATP (mumol/g wet wt) fell slowly from 4.3 and leveled off at 2.1 at 60 minutes of ischemia (p less than 0.001 versus control). Similar regeneration of phosphocreatine was found in seven additional pigs, with a 43% transmural reduction in coronary blood flow and a 66% reduction in subendocardial flow. No significant changes in ATP and phosphocreatine were noted in two different control groups (n = 13 pigs). The regeneration of phosphocreatine despite ongoing ischemia and low ATP levels was not related to changes in myocardial oxygen demand or consumption, or in regional function during the period of ischemia. This may reflect 1) a successful downregulation of the energy needs of the ischemic myocardium to maintain cell viability, or 2) a metabolic abnormality in the ability of the cells to produce ATP primarily or by use of phosphocreatine. 
5	Home treatment for acute psychiatric illness OBJECTIVE--To determine the factors influencing the successful outcome of community treatment for severe acute psychiatric illnesses that are traditionally treated in hospital. DESIGN--All patients from a single electoral ward who were either admitted to hospital or treated at home over a two year period (1 October 1987 to 30 September 1989) were included in the study and their case notes audited. The second year of the study is reported. SETTING--Electoral ward of Sparkbrook, Birmingham. SUBJECTS--99 Patients aged 16-65 with severe acute psychiatric illness. RESULTS--65 Patients were managed by home treatment alone; 34 required admission to hospital. The location of treatment was significantly (all p less than 0.05) influenced by social characteristics of the patients (marital state, age (in men), ethnicity, and living alone) and by characteristics of the referral (occurring out of hours; assessment taking place at hospital or police station). DSM-III-R diagnosis was more weakly associated with outcome. Violence during the episode was significantly related to admission, although deliberate self harm was not. CONCLUSIONS--Home treatment is feasible for most patients with acute psychiatric illness. A 24 hour on call assessment service increases the likelihood of success because admission is determined more strongly by social characteristics of the patient and the referral than by illness factors. Admission will still be required for some patients. A locally based mental health resource centre, a 24 hour on call service, an open referral system, and an active follow up policy increase the effectiveness of a home treatment service. 
3	Clonal origin of pituitary adenomas. As the pathogenesis of pituitary adenomas remains unclear, the tumor clonal composition of these common neoplasms was studied. Clonality was determined in female patients by analysis of restriction fragment length polymorphisms of the X-chromosome genes hypoxanthine phosphoribosyl transferase and phosphoglycerate kinase in conjunction with their respective methylation patterns. Peripheral lymphocyte DNA was screened from 62 female patients undergoing transsphenoidal surgery for pituitary adenoma. Eleven patients were heterozygous for the BglI site on PGK, 4 for the BamHI site on HPRT, and 1 patient for both sites. Of these 16 patients, 3 had acromegaly, 4 had Cushing's disease, 7 had hyperprolactinemia, and 2 were clinically nonfunctional. After surgery, morphological study, including immunohistochemistry and electron microscopy of the pathological specimens, allowed a direct comparison between clonality and tumor cell type. Control fresh normal pituitary tissue was found to be polyclonal. The following tumors were monoclonal: all 3 somatotroph adenomas, 4 of 4 lactotroph tumors, 3 of 4 corticotroph cell adenomas, a gonadotroph adenoma, and a nonsecretory adenoma. A mixed plurihormonal adenoma was polyclonal, as were 2 tumors consisting of adenomatous lactotrophs interspersed with nontumorous adenohypophyseal pituitary tissue and one corticotroph adenoma mixed with normal pituitary tissue. Functional pituitary adenomas derived from somatotrophs, corticotrophs, or lactotrophs and nonsecretory tumors are monoclonal in nature, suggesting that somatic cell mutations precede clonal expansion of these cells and play a major role in pituitary tumorigenesis. 
1	Modulation of N-nitrosomethylurea-induced mammary tumor promotion by dietary fiber and fat. A test of the anticancer effects of dietary fiber was conducted using the N-nitrosomethylurea (NMU)-induced rat mammary tumor model. Starting 3 days after NMU treatment, four different groups of F344 rats (30 rats in each group) were fed as follows: Group 1 received a high-fat diet; group 2, a high-fat plus fiber diet (soft white wheat bran, 10% wt/wt); group 3, a low-fat diet; and group 4, a low-fat plus fiber diet. The rats remained on these diets for 15 weeks. Tumor incidence in group 1 was 90% compared with 66% in group 2 (P less than .001). Tumor incidence in group 3 was 63% compared with 47% in group 4 (P greater than .4). These results show that supplemental dietary fiber exerts an inhibitory effect on the promotional phase of NMU-induced mammary carcinogenesis in rats when fed a high-fat but not a low-fat diet. To test whether fiber may exert its antipromoting effect by reducing circulating estrogens, serum 17 beta-estradiol was assayed. No changes were observed in serum 17 beta-estradiol levels among the four groups, suggesting that the protective effect of fiber in this animal model is not mediated by a fiber-induced reduction of circulating 17 beta-estradiol. 
1	Congenital dilatation of the bile duct in 100 instances and its relationship with anomalous junction [published erratum appears in Surg Gynecol Obstet 1991 Mar;172(3):246] Congenital dilatation of the bile duct (CDBD) or choledochal cyst has been demonstrated to be associated with an anomalous junction of the pancreaticobiliary ductal system. Multifarious clinical signs and symptoms of CDBD have been shown to be closely related with the presence of this anomalous junction. In the present study, 100 instances of CDBD treated surgically at our institutions during a 30 year period were classified into two types according to the morphologic features of dilatation of the bile duct; there were 77 instances of the cystic type and 23 of the cylindric type. Morphologic features of the lesion, clinical signs and symptoms and laboratory findings in these 100 instances were clinically analyzed. In almost all of the patients who were less than one year of age, the disease was of the cystic type and patients presented with either a palpable mass or jaundice as the main symptom. In patients more than one year of age, the disease was of either the cystic or cylindric type. A history of episodes of characteristic abdominal pain accompanied by elevated levels of serum amylase was present in 70 of the patients with the cystic type of disease and in all of the patients with the cylindric type. Histologic sections from the patients showed glandular formation with chronic inflammation, possibly a result of refluxed activated pancreatic juice; in contrast, histologic sections from the remaining patients of all ages showed only thickening of the fibrous layer. Thus, such variable morphologic features and clinical signs and symptoms in CDBD are highly dependent on two factors--the age at onset and the reflux of pancreatic juice into the bile duct through the common channel. 
5	Chordoma: a 20-year clinicopathologic review of the experience at Groote Schuur Hospital, Cape Town. Eighteen chordomas (11 females and 7 males) were seen over a 20-year period; 61% of the tumors occurred in the sphenoid region. The youngest patient was 3 years old and had a family history of chordoma. Histologically, the tumors were divided into classical (epithelial) and chondroid variants, which in this series, had no effect on outcome. Follow-up on 12 patients ranged from 3 to 170 months, and they were treated with various combinations of surgery and radiotherapy. One patient was administered the neutron beam and died after 94 months. The mean survival of this series is 73.4 months, with a survival rate of 50% (6 out of 12 patients alive). Surgical resection offers the best chance of survival, but chordomas have a propensity to metastasize, hence have a poor prognosis. 
5	Status epilepticus in infancy and childhood. Status epilepticus implies a prolonged seizure or recurrent seizures with persistent decreased consciousness, lasting at least 30 minutes. Both convulsive and nonconvulsive forms exist, either of which may lead to death or additional neurologic deficit. Therapy involves careful supportive care plus some combination of benzodiazepines, phenytoin, or phenobarbital. The outcome depends first on the etiology and second on the rapidity with which seizures are controlled. 
2	Therapy for acute infectious diarrhea in children. This article reviews current recommendations of therapy with antidiarrheal compounds and antimicrobial agents for acute infectious diarrhea in children. In most infants and children with acute infectious diarrhea, treatment with antidiarrheal compounds is not indicated. Many of these compounds interfere with identification of enteropathogens in stool specimens, and the antimotility class has an overdose potential. Antimicrobial therapy is given to reduce symptoms and to prevent the spread of infection by decreasing fecal shedding of organisms. Although effective therapy is not available for patients with enteric viruses, Cryptosporidium, and Microsporidium, therapy is useful for children with amebiasis, antimicrobial-associated colitis, cholera, giardiasis, various forms of Escherichia coli diarrhea and Salmonella disease, isosporiasis, shigellosis, and strongyloidiasis. For several other conditions, antimicrobial therapy is of questionable benefit (infection with Campylobacter jejuni or Yersinia enterocolitica, intestinal salmonellosis and enterohemorrhagic E. coli infection). Compounds such as the fluoroquinolones, which are effective in the treatment of acute infectious diarrhea in adults, are not approved for use in children because of potential side effects. Many bacterial, viral, and parasitic organisms cause acute infectious diarrhea; appropriate antimicrobial therapy requires the accurate, rapid identification of the offending enteropathogen. In children with an underlying illness such as acquired immunodeficiency syndrome, manifestations may be prolonged, severe, and recurrent despite appropriate therapy. 
4	Passive smoking and heart disease. Epidemiology, physiology, and biochemistry. The evidence that ETS increases risk of death from heart disease is similar to that which existed in 1986 when the US Surgeon General concluded that ETS caused lung cancer in healthy nonsmokers. There are 10 epidemiological studies, conducted in a variety of locations, that reflect about a 30% increase in risk of death from ischemic heart disease or myocardial infarction among nonsmokers living with smokers. The larger studies also demonstrate a significant dose-response effect, with greater exposure to ETS associated with greater risk of death from heart disease. These epidemiological studies are complemented by a variety of physiological and biochemical data that show that ETS adversely affects platelet function and damages arterial endothelium in a way that increases the risk of heart disease. Moreover, ETS, in realistic exposures, also exerts significant adverse effects on exercise capability of both healthy people and those with heart disease by reducing the body's ability to deliver and utilize oxygen. In animal experiments, ETS also depresses cellular respiration at the level of mitochondria. The polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons in ETS also accelerate, and may initiate, the development of atherosclerotic plaque. Of note, the cardiovascular effects of ETS appear to be different in nonsmokers and smokers. Nonsmokers appear to be more sensitive to ETS than do smokers, perhaps because some of the affected physiological systems are sensitive to low doses of the compounds in ETS, then saturate, and also perhaps because of physiological adaptions smokers undergo as a result of long-term exposure to the toxins in cigarette smoke. In any event, these findings indicate that, for cardiovascular disease, it is incorrect to compute "cigarette equivalents" for passive exposure to ETS and then to extrapolate the effects of this exposure on nonsmokers from the effects of direct smoking on smokers. These results suggest that heart disease is an important consequence of exposure to ETS. The combination of epidemiological studies with demonstration of physiological changes with exposure to ETS, together with biochemical evidence that elements of ETS have significant adverse effects on the cardiovascular system, leads to the conclusion that ETS causes heart disease. This increase in risk translates into about 10 times as many deaths from ETS-induced heart disease as lung cancer; these deaths contribute greatly to the estimated 53,000 deaths annually from passive smoking. This toll makes passive smoking the third leading preventable cause of death in the United States today, behind active smoking and alcohol. 
5	Potentially lethal ventricular arrhythmias. Minimizing the danger. Patients with potentially lethal ventricular arrhythmias are at an increased risk of sudden death. Antiarrhythmic drugs, with the exception of beta blockers and possibly amiodarone, have not been particularly effective in reducing mortality. Beta blockers have been used successfully to treat survivors of myocardial infarction, including patients with significant impairment of ventricular function. Evidence to date suggests that use of low-dose amiodarone may be appropriate for selected patients with chronic heart failure and potentially lethal ventricular arrhythmias. 
3	Diagnostic value of anti-neuronal antibodies for paraneoplastic disorders of the nervous system. The diagnostic value of the presence of anti-neuronal antibodies in serum was examined in 21 patients suspected of paraneoplastic disorders of the nervous system (NS) (group 1) and was compared to three control groups; group 2: 25 patients with a neurological disease, without cancer and no sign of paraneoplastic disorder; group 3: 27 patients with neurological disease and cancer and no signs of a paraneoplastic disorder; group 4: 94 patients with cancer and without neurological disease. In group 1, anti-neuronal nuclear antibodies were detected in eight patients (38%), in titres from 1:1000 to 1:32,000. A small cell lung cancer was present in six patients, ovarian cancer in one patient and in one patient no tumour could be detected. The neurological symptoms preceded a diagnosis of cancer in five out of eight patients. Anti-neuronal antibodies were found in the serum of two out of 94 patients (2%) from control group 3 but not in serum from any of the other control groups. These data indicate a moderate sensitivity of 38%, but a high specificity of 98.6% (95% confidence interval 95.5-99.8%) for the presence of anti-neuronal nuclear antibodies if a paraneoplastic NS disorder is suspected. 
2	Parathyroid hormone secretion and target organ response in experimental acute pancreatitis. To determine changes in parathyroid hormone secretion and target organ response caused by acute pancreatitis before the development of systemic toxic conditions, experimental acute pancreatitis was induced in rats with a choline-deficient, ethionine-supplemented diet. After 7 days, the rats were weighed and bled, and one kidney was assayed for 25-hydroxyvitamin D1 hydroxylase activity. Several manifestations of pancreatitis were observed in rats given the diet: weight loss (from 29.6 to 26.3 g vs that for control rats, from 29 to 52.8 g) and lower dietary intake (15.5 vs 47 g per rat per 7 days). Serum amylase levels fell from 1794 to 350 U/L in rats given the choline-deficient, ethionine-supplemented diet compared with levels of 1800 to 2100 U/L in control rats. The pancreases of rats given the choline-deficient, ethionine-supplemented diet showed degeneration, necrosis, and hemorrhaging. Serum levels of calcium, phosphorus, chloride, and parathyroid hormone did not change significantly throughout the experiment. Renal 25-hydroxyvitamin D1 hydroxylase activity was higher than in control rats (8.9 +/- 0.8 vs 7.6 +/- 0.6 fmol/mg of kidney per minute). Acute pancreatitis in this experimental animal model does not alter serum levels of calcium and parathyroid hormone or reduce target organ responsiveness to the hormone. 
4	Aortobronchial fistula after an aortic operation. A 71-year-old man with a postoperative aortobronchial fistula was successfully treated. The fistula occurred between the left lower lobe and the descending thoracic aorta, to which a distal anastomosis of a temporary bypass graft had been placed during thoracic aortic aneurysmectomy 3 years before. For saving patients with this complication, early surgical treatment during episodes of intermittent hemoptysis is important. The use of an omentum pedicle flap for the isolation of the suture line is a important adjunct. 
1	Trabecular or Merkel's cell carcinoma. Two cases of trabecular cell carcinoma of the skin are presented. The clinical presentation and behavior, and the histologic findings, of the tumor are described. Surgical excision of the primary lesion with regional lymph node dissection, if indicated, is the treatment of choice. Distant metastasis is treated by local irradiation. 
5	Geriatric diabetic nephropathy: an analysis of renal referral in patients age 60 or older. We report a series of 33 consecutive hospitalized geriatric diabetic patients who were referred for evaluation of diabetic nephropathy, defined as proteinuria greater than or equal to 1 g/d (1,000 mg/24 h) or a serum creatinine concentration greater than or equal to 177 mumol/d (greater than or equal to 2 mg/dL). The study population was 60 years old or older (mean age, 68 +/- 6 years), was comprised mainly of women (24 of 33, 72.7%), and was predominantly black (25 of 33, 75.8%). All patients had type II diabetes. A family history of diabetes in parent or sibling was elicited in 24 (72.7%) patients. There were eight patients undergoing maintenance hemodialysis and 25 with less severe nephropathy (mean proteinuria, 2.7 g/d [2,700 mg/24 h]; mean creatinine clearance, 0.57 mL-s [34 mL/min]). Cardiac disorders were noted in the majority of patients: congestive failure in 20 (60.6%), myocardial infarction in eight (24.2%), and active angina in five (15.2%). Other comorbid diseases were present in both hemodialysis patients and the subset of nondialyzed azotemic-proteinuric patients, and consisted of peripheral neuropathy in 31 (93.9%), gastroparesis in 16 (48.5%), retinopathy in 28 (84.8%), and legal blindness in 11 (33%). We conclude that geriatric diabetic nephropathy in type II diabetes is similar in presentation and severity of comorbid extrarenal complications to the syndrome described in younger adults. This inference must be tempered by both the small size and the limitation imposed by the demographics of the study population, which is predominantly composed of black patients receiving treatment at inner city hospitals. 
1	A clonal CD4-positive T-cell line established from the blood of a patient with Sezary syndrome. The reported inability to establish long-term T-cell lines from the blood of cutaneous T-cell lymphoma patients with circulating neoplastic T cells has hindered the development of an in vitro system to investigate Sezary syndrome. We have established a rapidly proliferating T-cell line from the peripheral blood of a patient with Sezary syndrome, which expresses a mature helper T-cell phenotype and contains cytogenetic abnormalities and T-cell receptor gene rearrangements identical to those in the patient's blood. The method of establishment and characteristics of this line are described. 
3	High risk of recurrent stroke after discontinuance of five to twelve years of transfusion therapy in patients with sickle cell disease. Although long-term transfusion therapy is at least 90% effective in preventing recurrent strokes after an initial cerebrovascular accident in patients with sickle cell disease, it is unknown how long transfusion therapy should be continued. To address this question, we prospectively discontinued transfusions in 10 patients with sickle cell disease whose median duration of transfusion therapy after an initial stroke was 9 1/2 years (range 5 to 12 years). Before the transfusions were discontinued, patients were examined by cerebral angiography, magnetic resonance imaging of the head, neuropsychologic testing, electroencephalography, and a complete neurologic examination. Within 12 months after transfusion therapy was stopped, 5 of 10 patients had had an ischemic event. Three events caused relatively mild deficits in the same areas as those originally affected. Two were associated with massive intracranial hemorrhage, including one on the contralateral side of original involvement. An additional patient died suddenly of unknown causes. Of the four remaining patients, three declined to resume transfusion and are relatively well at greater than or equal to 18 months after therapy was stopped. The studies performed before transfusions were stopped were not predictive of recurrent stroke. The risk of recurrent cerebrovascular accident in this group was significantly greater than the estimated risk of 10% in patients who are receiving long-term transfusion therapy (p = 0.002). This adverse outcome suggests that patients with sickle cell disease who have had a stroke must receive long-term transfusion indefinitely or a suitable therapeutic alternative must be devised. 
4	Influence of clinical and hemodynamic variables on risk of supraventricular tachycardia after coronary artery bypass. The influence of 45 variables on risk of postoperative supraventricular tachycardia was evaluated by univariate and multivariate analysis of data from 800 consecutive patients who underwent isolated coronary artery bypass during a 6-year interval. Postoperative supraventricular arrhythmias occurred in 186 patients (23%) but did not contribute to any of the six early deaths (30-day mortality rate, 0.8%). Mean (+/- standard deviation) length of hospital stay was longer (9.8 +/- 5.7 versus 8.3 +/- 3.5 days; p less than 0.0001) and mean age was older (65 versus 60 years; p less than 0.002) in patients with postoperative supraventricular tachycardia than in those with regular rhythm. Risk of supraventricular tachycardia was increased in patients with a history of atrial arrhythmias (45% versus 22%; p less than 0.002) or premature atrial contractions on the preoperative electrocardiogram (48% versus 22%; p less than 0.002). Multiple logistic regression analysis identified age 65 years or more, history of atrial arrhythmia or preoperative premature atrial contractions, and preoperative left ventricular end-diastolic pressure 20 mm Hg or more as independent predictors of postoperative supraventricular tachycardia. Six percent of patients converted to sinus rhythm spontaneously; 82% of patients converted within 1.1 +/- 1.9 days after onset of supraventricular tachycardia on treatment with digoxin or beta-adrenergic blocking drugs or both. Only 10% of patients with supraventricular tachycardia required electrical cardioversion. We conclude that the risk of supraventricular tachycardia after coronary artery bypass is influenced by patient-related variables and is effectively managed by conventional therapy. Prophylactic treatment should be reserved for elderly patients, especially those who have atrial arrhythmias or have preoperative left ventricular end-diastolic pressure 20 mm Hg or more. 
2	Valproate metabolism during hepatotoxicity associated with the drug. Plasma concentrations of valproate and certain of its metabolites and their patterns of excretion in urine are described in three adults who developed hepatotoxicity during treatment of epilepsy with sodium valproate. One patient also developed a degree of reversible renal insufficiency, whilst another may have had associated infectious mononucleosis. All three cases showed evidence of impaired mitochondrial beta-oxidation of valproate. In one the impairment was at the stage catalysed by fatty acyl-CoA dehydrogenase, in another at the stage catalysed by 3-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase and in the third at the stage catalysed by enoyl-CoA hydratase and possibly also at the next stage catalysed by 3-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase. The impaired beta-oxidation meant that valproate metabolism was diverted into various alternative pathways. Plasma concentrations of the suspected hepatotoxic metabolite 4-en-valproate were normal for the valproate-treated population in all cases. By analogy with certain spontaneous and acquired human disorders of branched chain amino acid metabolism, it is suggested that valproate-associated hepatotoxicity may represent the consequences of a valproate overload on a limited mitochondrial beta-oxidation capacity, causing accumulation of a toxic product of endogenous branched chain amino acid metabolism. 
5	Longitudinal study of diagnoses in children of women with unipolar and bipolar affective disorder. School-age children of unipolar depressed, bipolar, chronically medically ill, or normal women were diagnosed every 6 months for up to 3 years. Offspring of unipolar women had the highest rates of disorder at all evaluations, but children of bipolar and medically ill mothers also experienced significant rates of disorder. Observing diagnoses from both past lifetime and prospective follow-up assessments, it appeared that most children who had diagnoses had onsets in preadolescence and continued a chronic or intermittent course of disorder. Thus, risk to offspring of ill mothers is not transitory and indicates a pernicious course that commonly includes effective disorders alone or in combination with behavior and anxiety disorders. 
5	Recurrent anterior dislocation of the ulnar nerve at the cubital tunnel. Recurrent anterior dislocation of the ulnar nerve at the cubital tunnel is reported in two patients. This was due to traumatic attenuation of the flexor carpi ulnaris retinaculum. The mechanism of injury in both patients was a fall with the shoulder abducted and the elbow acutely flexed. Both patients had relief of their neurologic symptoms following anterior submuscular transposition of the ulnar nerve. 
5	Tracheoesophageal anastomosis for intractable aspiration pneumonia. Permanent tracheostomy and tracheoesophageal anastomosis were performed as a means of surgical intervention for the treatment of intractable aspiration pneumonia. Conventional methods of tracheoesophageal anastomosis have entailed various problems. The improved method devised by us uses the special histological features and enables safe and reliable anastomosis. By this method, the tracheal perichondrium is retained and the strength of the anastomosed portion of the trachea is maintained, the failure of sutures due to tension on the anastomotic site being prevented. Also, reanastomosis can be performed after the cure of primary disease. 
3	Extrapyramidal features in advanced Down's syndrome: clinical evaluation and family history. Extrapyramidal, frontal release, and other neurological signs were studied in 54 demented and non-demented patients with Down's syndrome (DS). Fourteen patients were demented and five showed extrapyramidal signs, mainly of the rigid-hypokinetic spectrum and similar to Parkinsonian features in advanced Alzheimer's disease (AD). None of the non-demented patients had Parkinsonian signs. The mean age of the demented DS patients with extrapyramidal signs was significantly higher than that of the patients without. Frontal release signs were present in demented and non-demented patients. A questionnaire showed no increase in either the proportion of early- or senile-onset dementia or Parkinsonism among first- and second-degree relatives of DS patients. Parkinsonian signs appear to be present at a lower frequency in DS than in advanced AD. A speculative hypothesis about a gene dosage effect of Cu/Zn-superoxide dismutase in preventing toxic radical formation in the substantia nigra of DS patients is presented. 
5	Epidermal dendritic S100 positive cells in necrobiosis lipoidica and granuloma annulare. Using an antibody to S100 protein, the number of dendritic cells above the basal layer in the epidermis was assessed in necrobiosis lipoidica and granuloma annulare. A statistically significantly higher number of these cells was found within the epidermis in necrobiosis lipoidica compared with granuloma annulare and normal skin. The numbers were similar to those seen in sarcoidosis and tuberculous reactions in the skin, which raises the possibility of an immune pathogenesis for necrobiosis lipoidica. 
5	Left ventricular aneurysm secondary to Behcet's disease. A 16-year-old boy with Behcet's disease who was seen with thrombophlebitis of the leg was found to have coronary artery occlusion with postinfarction left ventricular aneurysm. Recurrent femoral artery aneurysms and orogenital ulceration developed in him. The diagnostic features together with successful treatment of this patient and a discussion of Behcet's syndrome are presented. 
5	Vaginitis emphysematosa. A report of four cases. It has been hypothesized that vaginitis emphysematosa is a manifestation of trichomonal or Gardnerella infection. In support of this etiologic concept, four cases of the disorder are described showing the apparent curative effect of treating the associated infection. The linkage of these and other reported cases with conditions of impaired immunity suggests that immunologic factors are involved in the pathogenesis. 
5	Dislocation after primary arthroplasty for subcapital fracture of the hip. Wide range of movement is a risk factor. Dislocation is the most frequent serious complication following total hip replacement for subcapital femoral fracture. We report a prospective study, using matched groups, which compared the range of hip movement following hip replacement for arthritis and for fracture. The range of movement was significantly greater in the fracture group. We suggest that this is a predisposing factor for dislocation. 
5	The importance of cytogenetic studies in adult acute lymphocytic leukemia. PURPOSE: The prognostic importance of pretreatment bone marrow cytogenetic studies in adults with acute lymphocytic leukemia treated at a single institution, with an identical treatment program, is described. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A total of 105 patients with a documented morphologic diagnosis of acute lymphocytic leukemia were reviewed for the purpose of this analysis. All patients had an extensive workup at presentation, and cytogenetic analysis was performed in 103 patients, using the Giemsa banding technique with trypsin pretreatment on 24-hour cultured cells. RESULTS: The specific cytogenetic classification in the 103 patients who had the karyotypic analysis was as follows: diploid 27%; Philadelphia chromosome-positive 13%; hyperdiploid 12%; B-cell karyotype 6%; 6q- and 14q+ abnormalities 4%; pseudodiploid 8%; hypodiploid 2%; and insufficient metaphases 28%. B-cell, 6q- or 14q+, and Philadelphia chromosome-positive karyotypes tended to correlate with other known negative prognostic factors. Patients with diploid, hyperdiploid, pseudodiploid, and hypodiploid karyotypes or with insufficient metaphases could be combined into one group with a favorable prognosis. In this group, the remission rate with induction chemotherapy was 89%, the median complete remission duration was 26 months, and the median survival was 25 months, with a 3-year survival rate of 45%. Patients with Philadelphia chromosome-positive, B-cell, and 6q- or 14q+ abnormalities collectively had an unfavorable prognosis. Their response rate to induction chemotherapy was 65%, the median response duration was 7 months, and the median survival was 8 months, with a 3-year survival rate of less than 10%. CONCLUSION: We conclude that the pretreatment bone marrow karyotype is an important part of the evaluation of adults with acute lymphocytic leukemia and provides significant prognostic information. 
5	Cytomegalovirus in a macerated second trimester fetus: persistent viral inclusions on light and electron microscopy. The macerated stillborn fetus represents at least one third of all perinatal deaths. Microscopic examination of these specimens is often unrewarding. We have reported a clinically unsuspected cytomegalovirus infection in a second trimester macerated fetus. Cells suggestive of CMV inclusions were identified by light microscopy, but electron microscopy confirmed the presence of viral infection and proved valuable in making the diagnosis even though necrosis was severe. 
5	The origin of epidermal melanocytes. Implications for the histogenesis of nevi and melanomas. Among the most venerable concepts in dermatopathology is Unna's 19th century notion of Abtropfung, ie, that melanocytes drop off from the epidermis to the dermis during the histogenesis of melanocytic tumors. Paradoxically, however, Unna's basic premise of an epidermal origin for melanocytes has been seriously questioned for over 40 years, based on experimental evidence favoring a neural crest origin for melanocytes. Recent work has strengthened the evidence for a neural crest origin of epidermal melanocytes, and it has been suggested that the concept of Abtropfung be replaced by the concept of Hochsteigerung. The concept of Hochsteigerung holds that melanocytes migrate up from the dermis into the epidermis-not only in normal development, but also during normal tissue maintenance. It now seems likely that the precursor of melanocytes, in both normal and abnormal differentiation, may not be a melanoblast (a primitive cell committed to melanocytic differentiation) but rather a pluripotential cell. Although axon-investing Schwann cells have been the traditional focus as the closest relative of the epidermal melanocyte, recent studies suggest that another nerve sheath cell, the perineural cell, might be a better candidate. These concepts have profound implications for the histogenesis of melanocytic nevi and melanomas. 
4	Hyaluronan in pleural effusions and in serum. It has been suggested that a high level of hyaluronan (hyaluronic acid, HYA) in pleural fluid is an indicator of malignant mesothelioma. In 78 consecutive patients with pleural effusion of various causes the HYA concentration was measured in pleural fluid samples and in serum. Nine patients had malignant pleural mesothelioma, and in three of them the HYA level in pleural fluid was 100 mg/l or more. In 42 patients with effusions due to metastatic malignancy, the mean HYA in the pleural fluid was 75 mg/l, and in five the HYA level was above 100 mg/l. Cardiac insufficiency caused the effusion in 11 patients, of whom two had a level above 100 mg/l in pleural fluid. Four patients had a serologically confirmed viral infection and had HYA levels in pleural fluid of 8, 157, 335, and 554 mg/l, respectively. One patient had postinfectious effusion with an HYA level in pleural exudate of 748 mg/l, the highest in this investigation. Two patients had benign asbestos pleural effusions, and both had high pleural HYA levels (256 and 490 mg/l, respectively). The serum HYA values were much lower than in the pleural fluid, namely from 15 to 480 micrograms/l; the levels were independent of the levels in the pleural fluid. Thus, a high level of HYA in pleural fluid is not specific for mesothelioma but can occur in other malignant or benign diseases, and a low level does not exclude mesothelioma. 
5	Proximity of the home to a cooling tower and risk of non-outbreak Legionnaires' disease. OBJECTIVE--To study the source of non-outbreak legionnaires' disease, particularly the role of cooling towers, by comparing the locations of patients' homes in relation to the location of cooling towers. DESIGN--Retrospective, descriptive study of a case series of patients with legionnaires' disease ill between 1978 and 1986 and, for comparison, a case series of patients with lung cancer. A prospectively developed register and interview based survey provided data on the location of cooling towers. SETTING--The city of Glasgow. PATIENTS--134 patients aged 14-84 with legionnaires' disease during 1978-86 and 10,159 patients with lung cancer during the same period. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES--The locations of patients' homes and cooling towers as defined by postcodes, which provided map grid references accurate to 10 m; numbers of expected and observed cases of legionnaires' disease in census enumeration districts; and distance of enumeration districts from the nearest cooling tower as defined by five distance categories. RESULTS--Most cooling towers were in or near the city centre or close to the River Clyde, as were the places of residence of patients with community acquired, non-travel, non-outbreak legionnaires' disease (n = 107). There was an inverse association between the distance of residence from any cooling tower and the risk of infection, the population living within 0.5 km of any tower having a relative risk of infection over three times that of people living more than 1 km away. There was no such association with respect to travel related legionnaires' disease, and for lung cancer the association was weak (relative risk less than or equal to 1.2 in any distance group). CONCLUSION--In Glasgow cooling towers have been a source of infection in two outbreaks of legionnaires' disease and, apparently, a source of non-outbreak infection also. Better maintenance of cooling towers should help prevent non-outbreak cases. This method of inquiry should be applied elsewhere to study the source of this and other environmentally acquired disease. 
3	Patient perception of tics and other movement disorders. To determine the subjective perception patients have of abnormal movements, 170 patients with various hyperkinesias were interviewed with questions directed at the "voluntary" or intentional versus "involuntary" aspects of their symptoms. One hundred and two of 110 patients with non-tic disorders thought that the abnormal movements were entirely involuntary. Forty-one of 60 tic disorder patients stated that all their motor and phonic tics were intentionally produced. Fifteen others had both voluntary and involuntary components, usually with the former predominating. A "voluntary" response could be used to predict the correct diagnostic category (tic versus non-tic) in 8 of 9 patients for whom the referral category was incorrect. These results suggest that a large proportion of the motor and phonic symptoms experienced by tic patients are irresistibly but purposefully executed, more akin to compulsions than to the other "involuntary" hyperkinesias with which they are commonly discussed. 
3	Recovery profile after desflurane-nitrous oxide versus isoflurane-nitrous oxide in outpatients. Thirty-eight healthy outpatients undergoing elective surgical procedures lasting 1-3 h were randomly assigned to receive either desflurane 3% (approximately 0.5 MAC) or isoflurane 0.6% (approximately 0.5 MAC) for maintenance of general anesthesia with nitrous oxide 60% in oxygen after a standardized induction sequence consisting of fentanyl 3 micrograms.kg-1, thiopental 4 mg.kg-1, and succinylcholine 1-1.5 mg.kg-1, intravenously. Although anesthetic conditions were similar during operations in the two treatment groups, significant differences were noted in the recovery profiles as measured by elimination kinetics, psychometric testing, and visual analog scales (to assess subjective feelings). The time required for the end-tidal concentration to decrease by 50% was 2.5 +/- 0.8 min for desflurane vs. 9.5 +/- 3.4 min for isoflurane (mean +/- standard deviation [SD]). Times to awakening and ability to follow simple commands were significantly shorter after desflurane than after isoflurane (5.1 +/- 2.4 vs. 10.2 +/- 7.7 min 6.5 +/- 2.3 min vs. 11.1 +/- 7.9 min, respectively). Postoperatively, patients who received desflurane exhibited less impairment of cognitive function (as measured using the Digit-Symbol Substitution Test) than did those who received isoflurane. Furthermore, visual analog scores indicated that patients receiving desflurane experienced significantly less discomfort (pain), drowsiness, fatigue, clumsiness, and confusion in the early postoperative period. We conclude that desflurane may offer clinical advantages over isoflurane when used for maintenance of anesthesia during outpatient surgical procedures. 
1	Pregnancy associated with Gorlin's syndrome. A pregnant woman with Gorlin's syndrome presented for the removal of malignant ovarian tumours. The main problem encountered by the anaesthetists was an unexpected increase in arterial blood pressure. This was most probably associated with surgical manipulation of the ovaries with an increase in prorenin/renin production. 
1	Imaging of tumor in patients with indium-111-labeled biotin and streptavidin-conjugated antibodies: preliminary communication Tumor localization in patients has been achieved through the in vivo use of streptavidin and biotin. In these preliminary studies, the monoclonal antibody HMFG1 was conjugated with streptavidin and 1 mg was administered intravenously to each of 10 patients with documented squamous cell carcinoma of the lung. Two to 3 days later, 111In-labeled biotin was also administered intravenously. No evidence of toxicity was observed. Background radioactivity levels were reduced in liver (1% ID at 24 hr) and kidneys (2%) and in all other normal tissues and blood. Images of lung tumor were obtained in as little as 2 hr following administration of labeled biotin. In eight patients, tumor was detected with labeled biotin alone without the previous administration of streptavidin-conjugated antibody but in three of these patients, the images were improved with the prior administration of conjugated antibody. These results suggest that this approach may improve the tumor-to-normal tissue radioactivity ratios in radioimmunotargeting. 
5	Idiopathic sclerosing peritonitis in a man. Idiopathic sclerosing peritonitis is a rare disease described in young adolescent women, characterized by fibrosis and adhesions of the peritoneum to loops of the small bowel. Here we describe a 35-year-old man who underwent exploratory laparotomy for repeated small bowel obstruction. Only partial resection of the terminal ileum was possible because of adhesions; recurrent abdominal infections and leakage from anastomosis required further resection, which ultimately resulted in short bowel syndrome and malabsorption. The clinical and pathological findings were characteristic for idiopathic sclerosing peritonitis. We review the relevant literature, to confirm, to the best of our knowledge, that this is the first report of a male patient who has developed this rare disease. 
1	Exaggerated venous mural hypertrophy in association with metastatic adenocarcinoma of the prostate. A 61-year-old black man presented with metastases to the right groin 5 years after 125iodine treatment for a well differentiated primary prostatic adenocarcinoma. Medium sized veins within and immediately adjacent to the neoplasm showed marked mural thickening due to hypertrophy and hyperplasia of the inner circular and outer longitudinal muscles. There was no histological evidence of radiation effect in the stroma or in the tumor cells. We could find no report in the literature of such changes associated with metastatic carcinoma. 
3	Cerebral venous oxygen content as a measure of brain energy metabolism with increased intracranial pressure and hyperventilation. In order to test the hypothesis that the cerebral arteriovenous oxygen difference (AVDO2) and venous oxygen content (VO2) could be used to monitor brain energy metabolism in the setting of increased intracranial pressure (ICP). 12 cats were studied with 31P-magnetic resonance spectroscopy. six cats were subjected to intracranial hypertension by cisternal infusion of saline. Energy failure occurred at an average AVDO2 of 8.4 +/- 3.2 vol% (+/- standard deviation) (range 4.7 to 14.7 vol%). The VO2 at the point of metabolic failure averaged 1.45 +/- 0.6 vol% and extended over a narrower range (1.0 to 2.9 vol%). In an additional six cats, ICP was raised to the threshold of metabolic failure and hyperventilation was then instituted (pCO2 10 to 18 torr). Five of the six cats experienced a drop in VO2 with hyperventilation. In two of these animals, hyperventilation resulted in a VO2 of 1.1 vol% or less and in metabolic failure as evidenced by a fall in phosphocreatine. It is concluded that a VO2 of less than 2 vol% is correlated with brain ischemia and that the safety of hyperventilation in the setting of increased ICP can be monitored by the use of VO2. 
5	Evidence for tumor necrosis factor-induced pulmonary microvascular injury after intestinal ischemia-reperfusion injury. Acute lung injury characterized by increased microvascular permeability is one feature of multiple-organ system failure and the adult respiratory distress syndrome. Intestinal ischemia-reperfusion injury has been linked to this type of acute lung injury. The purpose of these experiments was to examine the pathogenic mediators that link the two processes, with particular emphasis on the roles of endotoxin and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF alpha). Previously described characteristics of the acute lung injury in this rat model of intestinal ischemia-reperfusion include pulmonary neutrophil sequestration, depletion of lung tissue ATP, alveolar endothelial cell disruption, and increased microvascular permeability. Plasma levels of TNF in the systemic circulation of sham-operated animals and those with intestinal ischemic injury less than 60 minutes in duration were very low or undetectable. Intestinal ischemia for 120 minutes was associated with TNF elevation to 1.19 +/- 0.50 U/mL. Reperfusion for periods of 15 and 30 minutes generated 5- to 10-fold increases in circulating TNF levels (6.61 +/- 3.11 U/mL, p greater than 0.05 and 10.41 +/- 5.41 U/mL, p = 0.004 compared to sham); however this increase in circulating TNF was transient and largely cleared within 60 minutes after initiating reperfusion. Portal vein endotoxin levels were found to increase significantly before the appearance of TNF in systemic plasma, suggesting that gut-derived endotoxin may induce TNF release from hepatic macrophages into the systemic circulation. Anti-TNF antibody attenuated the increase in pulmonary microvascular permeability in this preparation but did not prevent pulmonary neutrophil sequestration. These observations suggest that endotoxin and TNF have pathogenic roles in this acute lung injury, but that mechanisms of adherence of neutrophils to endothelial cells independent of TNF may be involved. The accumulation of neutrophils in the lung but the prevention of a vascular permeability increase in the presence of antibody to TNF may imply an in vivo role for TNF in the process of neutrophil activation. These studies provide additional evidence of the importance of the endogenous inflammatory mediators in the development of systemic injury in response to local tissue injury. 
3	Polyglucosan body disease. Adult polyglucosan disease has been described in 15 cases. All had signs of peripheral neuropathy, upper motor neuron signs, and 12 of the 15 had sphincter problems. Dementia was prominent in 8 of 15 cases. We reported 2 cases that contained these clinical features. Electrophysiological studies showed axonal neuropathy. Somatosensory evoked potentials on the second patient were abnormal. Sural nerve biopsy showed clusters of polyglucosan bodies. Although the presence of polyglucosan bodies in biopsy is nonspecific, the number as well as the clinical features are necessary to make the diagnosis. Branching enzyme activity in muscle extracts of the muscles were normal. Hence, a specific enzyme abnormality is not yet known. 
5	Hemiparesis and ischemic changes of the white matter after intrathecal therapy for children with acute lymphocytic leukemia. Three children with acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL) developed delayed-onset transient hemiparesis and facial palsy after intrathecal (IT) administration of methotrexate (MTX) alone or as part of triple intrathecal chemotherapy for central nervous system (CNS) prophylaxis. The hemiparesis developed 10 to 14 days after IT therapy. Two of three children also experienced transient, profound expressive dysarthria. These episodes occurred during maintenance treatment after multiple IT administrations and without previous CNS toxicity. Two of three children received intermediate-dose MTX, 1 g/m2, not less than 5 weeks before events. These patients had not received cranial irradiation and had no evidence of CNS leukemia before or after these episodes. Ischemic changes on computerized tomographic scan or magnetic resonance imaging studies were documented in all three cases. Such changes are unusual manifestations of neurotoxicity in children after intrathecal therapy. 
5	Experience with Duraphase penile prosthesis: its use as replacement device. The Duraphase Penile Prosthesis is a new, articulating type of semirigid prosthesis which appears to have several advantages over other semirigid penile prostheses. This series describes the experience with this prosthesis in 12 patients and highlights the experience in 4 patients who underwent removal of other types of prostheses due to mechanical or functional problems and replacement with the Duraphase prosthesis. The device has been mechanically reliable during short follow-up, and there has been excellent patient satisfaction. 
3	Postictal psychosis after partial complex seizures: a multiple case study. Bouts of unusually frequent partial complex seizures originating in the temporal lobe, that sometimes became secondarily generalized, induced psychotic episodes in 9 patients. In 7, the increase in seizures occurred at a time when antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) were being reduced during intensive EEG monitoring with a view to surgical treatment of intractable epilepsy. According to DSM-III-R criteria, the postictal psychosis resembled an organic delusional syndrome which was paranoid in 7 and schizophreniform in 1 and an organic mood syndrome in 1. A high incidence of ictal fear, of bilateral independent epileptogenic discharge, and of small foreign tissue lesion were unexpected findings and appeared to represent risk factors, especially in patients otherwise handicapped by an epileptic personality disorder. Recognition of postictal psychosis in this setting and in others is important both prognostically and therapeutically. Postictal psychosis does not constitute a contraindication to surgical treatment of epilepsy. 
5	Safe use of codeine in the recovering alcoholic or addict. The effect that codeine has on the process of addiction and recovery is unclear. Confusion about definitions, study endpoints, and a lack of well-controlled clinical studies has led to this uncertainty. Codeine addiction is uncommon in people who do not have existing vulnerability to addiction, including alcoholism. Codeine use can sustain addiction or increase the risk of relapse in patients afflicted with addiction. The risk of relapse must be considered when treating conditions such as pain or cough in a person recovering from addiction. Codeine use may be circumvented with the appropriate use of alternative treatments for pain or cough. If codeine use becomes necessary, cautious prescribing and reliance on the patient's recovery support network become imperative. 
4	Spinal cord arteriovenous malformation with an associated lymphatic anomaly. Case report. Spinal cord arteriovenous malformations (AVM's), like other vascular anomalies of the central nervous system, can be associated with similar vascular lesions of the skin and viscera. A 7-year-old girl, who presented with rapidly progressing paraplegia, was found to have a spinal cord AVM, cutaneous angioma, and a chylous malformation of the lymphatic system. She had previously undergone treatment for a posterior thoracic cutaneous angioma. At surgery, upon incision of the paravertebral muscle fascia, viscous pale fluid was encountered emanating from a foramen in the thoracic lamina. The spinal AVM was resected in spite of concern that the abnormality represented spinal osteomyelitis. Postoperatively, there was full return of function in the lower extremities, along with recurrent episodes of chylothorax, which slowly came under control with dietary manipulation. A review of the anatomy of the thoracic duct and nontraumatic causes of chylothorax is presented, and the association of cutaneous and central angiomas is discussed. Finally, the treatment of chylothorax is delineated. 
5	A valved hepatic portoduodenal intestinal conduit for biliary atresia. Forty-six consecutive patients with biliary atresia were operated on at our institution during the 11-year period between 1978 and 1989. Their ages at operation ranged from 18 to 153 days (mean, 59 days). After dissecting the porta hepatis structures by Kasai operation, a biliointestinal anastomosis was constructed with a valved hepatic portoduodenal intestinal conduit in all cases. The intestinal valve is an intussuscepted muscular valve. Valvular function was examined radiologically. The upper gastrointestinal series demonstrated no reflux of contrast material into the conduit proximal to the valve and liver scintigraphy demonstrated that radioactive isotope drained readily into the duodenum through the valve. Thirty-nine of the forty-six patients (85%) had bile drainage after initial operation. At present 30 patients (65%) are alive without jaundice, 6 (13%) are alive with jaundice, and 10 (22%) are dead. The 5-year jaundice-free survival rate was 64%. Cholangitis occurred in 9 of 39 patients (23%) who had obtained apparent bile drainage: 5 had tractable cholangitis and 4 had refractory cholangitis. Reoperation restored bile flow in 2 of 8 patients who abruptly ceased to have bile drainage without cholangitis. In conclusion, with a valved hepatic portoduodenal intestinal conduit, the incidence of cholangitis was decreased, its medical control became easier, and the survival rate was improved. 
1	Alternating hepatic intra-arterial floxuridine and fluorouracil: a less toxic regimen for treatment of liver metastases from colorectal cancer. Hepatic intra-arterial (HIA) infusion of floxuridine (FUDR) via an implanted pump has shown promise in the treatment of colorectal cancer metastasized to the liver. However, the potential benefit of this therapy may be offset by the high incidence of treatment-limiting biliary toxicity. Although weekly HIA bolus of fluorouracil (5-FU) is effective against metastatic colorectal cancer to the liver with no biliary toxicity, it is limited by systemic side effects. In December 1986, we began a phase II trial of alternating HIA FUDR and 5-FU via the implanted pump in an attempt to extend the duration of treatment by obviating the limiting biliary (FUDR) and systemic (5-FU) drug toxic effects. Patients received continuous HIA FUDR at 0.1 mg/kg of body weight per day on days 1 through 8 followed by an HIA bolus of 5-FU at 15 mg/kg given via the pump sideport on days 15, 22, and 29, with the cycle repeated every 35 days. Sixty-eight patients were enrolled in this trial, and 64 were fully evaluable. Of the 64 patients, 30 (47%) previously had received chemotherapy. Major response (complete response plus partial response) was observed in 32 (50%) of 64 patients, and the median survival from pump implantation in all patients was 22.4 months. In contrast to the experience with the single-agent HIA FUDR regimen, no patient had treatment terminated because of drug toxicity. Alternating HIA FUDR and 5-FU has efficacy similar to that of HIA FUDR given alone, but when closely monitored and adjusted appropriately, is not associated with toxic effects requiring treatment termination. 
5	Renovascular disease and renal complications of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor therapy Renal complications of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor therapy are widely recognized, but few authors have documented the incidence or spectrum of these conditions. In a retrospective study of 530 consecutive patients presenting to our unit as acute uraemic emergencies over a six-year period, 85 (16 per cent) had renovascular disease that was considered to be responsible for their loss of renal function. Twenty-one (4 per cent) patients had uraemia which could be clearly attributable to ACE inhibitor treatment; 18 of these cases were shown to have significant renovascular pathology. Following withdrawal of the ACE inhibitor the renal failure reversed in the majority of patients. We also examined 400 consecutive hypertensive patients referred over a similar period and, although vascular imaging was performed only when it was considered to be clinically indicated, 58 (14.5 per cent) of these patients were shown to have renovascular pathology. A further five patients with stable chronic renal disease were seen to have a deterioration in their glomerular filtration rate coincident with commencement of ACE inhibitor therapy; this reversed when the agents were withdrawn. These observations indicate that significant renovascular disease may be more common than has been hitherto recognized and that injudicious use of ACE inhibitors may result in serious complications. Methods which may minimize such iatrogenic disease are suggested. 
4	Percutaneous transaortic closure of postinfarctional ventricular septal rupture. We report a case of successful closure of a postinfarctional ventricular septal defect by means of the transaortic approach with a balloon catheter. This method brought about substantial improvement in cardiopulmonary function before an elective operation and made it possible to successfully perform the operation on the patient, an 81-year-old woman, on the 22nd day of admission. 
2	Hypertrophic pyloric stenosis: volumetric measurement of nasogastric aspirate to determine the imaging modality The authors postulated that volumetric measurement of residual gastric aspirate in neonates and infants with nonbilious projectile vomiting could enable differentiation between patients with hypertrophic pyloric stenosis (HPS) and those with gastroesophageal reflux (GER) and help to determine whether ultrasound (US) or fluoroscopy of the upper gastrointestinal tract would best confirm the diagnosis. In the 38 patients (all but two of whom had been fasting for 3-4 hours), 10 mL or more of nasogastric aspirate was considered indicative of obstruction. HPS occurred in 91.7% of patients with 10 mL of aspirate or more, whereas GER occurred in 85.7% of patients with less than 10 mL. The differences between the two groups were statistically significant. Solely on the basis of residual volume (greater than or equal to 10 mL), the cause of vomiting could be differentiated, prior to standard radiologic studies, 89.4% of the time. It is concluded that patients with projectile vomiting who have 10 mL or more of residual aspirate in the stomach should undergo US for confirmation of HPS; those with less than 10 mL should undergo fluoroscopy for confirmation of GER. 
1	The effect of chemotherapy on growth in the skeletally immature individual. One hundred twenty-two children with nonmetastatic osteogenic or Ewing's sarcoma were studied to assess the effect of multiagent adjuvant chemotherapy on skeletal growth and final stature. No deviations from the height distributions of a normal population were noted at diagnosis. There was a marked retardation of linear growth during the year of intensive chemotherapy. Only 15% of the patients grew at the expected rate during that year. The distribution of nutritional status scores was significantly different at the end of the first year than at baseline. The distribution of ultimate height scores was significantly different than the baseline distribution. The overall final distribution was also significantly different from the normal population expectation. Any absolute difference in height, however, is likely to be small. The subgroups that were observed to full adult stature showed mean heights of 162 cm for girls and 176 cm for boys. 
5	Central visual field changes after panretinal photocoagulation in proliferative diabetic retinopathy. This study comprises 53 eyes, divided into two groups A and B, with proliferative diabetic retinopathy which were treated with panretinal photocoagulation (PRP). Its purpose is to investigate the alterations in the central 15 degrees and 30 degrees of the visual field and in each quadrant separately. In both groups A and B, PRP covered the periphery and mid-periphery. In group A, it stopped 2 disc diameters (DD) from the upper temporal and lower margin of the fovea including the papillomacular bundle, while in group B, PRP stopped 3 DD from the upper temporal and lower margin of the fovea and 1 DD of the nasal margin of the optic disc. The investigation revealed, in group B after PRP, an improvement of the retinal sensitivity in the central 15 degrees of the visual field (p less than 0.01). In the 30 degrees of the visual field a deterioration after PRP was noted in both groups A and B, the deterioration being however much more prominent in group A. Comparing the results between groups B and A after PRP, a difference in the retinal sensitivity in favour of group B at 15 degrees and 30 degrees of the visual field was found. As regards regression of neovascularization and visual acuity, no statistically significant difference has been observed between the two groups. 
2	Risk for colon adenomas in patients with rectosigmoid hyperplastic polyps OBJECTIVE: To determine whether hyperplastic polyps found in the rectosigmoid area of the colon are associated with proximal adenomas, and to judge whether patients with distal hyperplastic polyps found during sigmoidoscopy might benefit from full colonoscopy. DESIGN: Data on patients having colonoscopy collected prospectively according to a set protocol. The size and location of all polyps were noted, and all polyps were biopsied. SETTING: Two university hospitals. PATIENTS: One thousand eight hundred and thirty-six consecutive patients referred for colonoscopy between 31 December 1987 and 31 August 1989. RESULTS: Of the 970 patients who met eligibility requirements, 274 (28.3%) had adenomas and 108 (11.1%) had hyperplastic polyps. The proportion of patients with distal hyperplastic polyps and proximal adenomas (31.9%) was similar to the proportion of those without distal hyperplastic polyps (23.0%) (crude odds ratio, 1.57; 95% CI, 0.77 to 3.06). After adjusting for age and sex, the results were unchanged (adjusted odds ratio, 1.53; CI, 0.82 to 2.88). Patients with distal adenomas, on the other hand, were three times more likely to have proximal adenomas than those without distal adenomas (adjusted odds ratio, 3.42; CI, 1.99 to 5.88). CONCLUSIONS: Distal hyperplastic polyps are not strong predictors of risk for proximal adenomas. Based on the magnitude of the risk difference, we do not believe that finding a hyperplastic polyp during sigmoidoscopy justifies doing a full colonoscopy to search for proximal adenomas. Because rectosigmoid adenomas are associated with proximal adenomas, however, small polyps seen during sigmoidoscopy should be biopsied to determine their type. Colonoscopy should be reserved for patients who are proved to have adenomas. 
3	Respiratory failure and unilateral caudal brainstem infarction. We report clinicotopographic correlations in 2 patients with central hypoventilation and unilateral infarct in the caudal brainstem. One patient had nearly complete loss of ventilation involving both automatic and voluntary components. He showed no ventilator response during a CO2 retention test (PaCO2 62 mm Hg, PaO2 82 mm Hg), while consciousness was preserved until death. The infarct involved the reticular formation, nucleus tractus solitarius, nucleus ambiguus, and nucleus retroambiguus on the right but spared the dorsal motor nucleus of the tenth cranial nerve, and sensory and corticospinal tracts. The second patient showed hypoventilation more selectively involving automatic responses (Ondine's curse). The infarct involved the medullary reticular formation and nucleus ambiguus but spared the nucleus tractus solitarius. We suggest that unilateral involvement of pontomedullary reticular formation and nucleus ambiguus is sufficient for generating loss of automatic respiration, while associated lesion of the nucleus tractus solitarius may lead to more severe respiratory failure involving both automatic and voluntary responses. 
5	Current status of organ preservation with University of Wisconsin solution. A retrospective analysis of all organs that were preserved with University of Wisconsin solution was undertaken to assess the impact of this solution on early allograft function. From May 1987 until June 1990, 181 livers, 92 pancreata, and 92 kidneys were preserved with University of Wisconsin solution for extended periods of time. The mean (+/- SD) preservation times were as follows: liver, 12.6 +/- 4.5 hours; pancreas, 16.7 +/- 4.4 hours; and kidney, 18.3 +/- 4.3 hours. The overall rate of primary nonfunction and hepatic artery thrombosis were 6.1% and 3.9%, respectively. No differences in the rates of primary nonfunction and hepatic artery thrombosis were noted for combined liver-pancreas procurement vs isolated liver retrievals or when reduced-size liver transplants were compared with nonreduced liver transplants. Likewise, no difference in primary nonfunction or hepatic artery thrombosis was seen in livers that were preserved for less than 6, 6 to 12, and greater than 12 hours. However, serum aminotransferase levels and prothrombin times were lower on the first postoperative day in livers that were preserved for less than 6 hours when compared with 6 to 12 or greater than 12 hours. Early pancreatic allograft function was also excellent for up to 24 hours of cold-storage preservation. All patients were immediately insulin independent, and there were no cases of initial nonfunction or graft pancreatitis. There were only two cases (2.2%) of pancreatic vascular thrombosis in this series. No difference in pancreatic function was noted for organs that were preserved for less than 6, 6 to 12, or greater than 12 hours. Likewise, renal allograft function was excellent, with only two patients (2.2%) requiring postoperative hemodialysis. The actuarial 1-month patient survival for liver and pancreas-kidney transplant recipients was 91.5% and 98.9%, respectively. Actuarial 1-month allograft survival for liver, pancreas, and kidney transplants was 83.0%, 96.7%, and 97.8%, respectively. In conclusion, University of Wisconsin solution represents a significant advancement in cold-storage organ preservation and is ideally suited as a universal intra-abdominal aortic-flush and cold-storage solution. 
5	Relapse of infant botulism. We report on 3 infants who had relapse of infant botulism after apparent resolution of clinical symptoms. This group represented 5% of the infants with confirmed infant botulism who were treated at our institution since 1976. The exact cause for these relapses was unclear, but three potential mechanisms are examined. There were no historical, clinical, or electrophysiological predictors of relapse. Although at the time of writing recovery from relapse appeared complete, close follow-up of patients recovering from a bout of infant botulism is necessary. 
3	Early-onset autosomal dominant retinitis pigmentosa with severe hyperopia. We studied a four-generation family with early-onset autosomal dominant retinitis pigmentosa, severe hyperopia, and axial eye lengths of less than 20 mm. The affected members had decreased vision, night blindness, typical peripheral retinal pigmentary changes, and electroretinographic abnormalities characteristic of retinitis pigmentosa. This pedigree suggests there is another variant of retinitis pigmentosa associated with hyperopia besides Leber's congenital amaurosis and preserved para-arteriole retinal pigment epithelium. 
4	Calcitropic hormones, platelet calcium, and blood pressure in essential hypertension. Plasma ionized calcium, platelet cytosolic calcium (using the fura-2 method in gel-filtered platelets), parathyroid hormone (both the intact hormone and a midmolecule portion), calcitriol, and calcidiol were measured in 19 untreated male patients with essential hypertension and 19 age-matched normotensive male research subjects. Mean levels of platelet cytosolic calcium, parathyroid hormone, calcitriol, and calcidiol were all significantly higher, whereas plasma ionized calcium was significantly lower, in the hypertensive group compared with the normotensive group. Both platelet cytosolic calcium and intact parathyroid hormone were positively correlated with mean arterial pressure (r = 0.58, p less than 0.001; r = 0.54, p less than 0.001, respectively), whereas plasma ionized calcium was inversely correlated with mean arterial pressure (r = -0.60, p less than 0.001) in the combined group of all study subjects. All three of these correlations were significant in the hypertensive group alone but not in the normotensive group alone. When analyzed with plasma ionized calcium, body mass index, serum calcitriol, and calcidiol in a multivariable regression model, the significance of the partial regressions of platelet cytosolic calcium and parathyroid hormone with mean arterial pressure persisted. Intact parathyroid hormone was positively correlated to platelet cytosolic calcium (r = 0.43, p less than 0.01) and plasma ionized calcium was inversely correlated to platelet cytosolic calcium (r = -0.44, p less than 0.01). These results confirm previous reports of disturbances of calcium metabolism in essential hypertension and suggest that the elevated platelet cytosolic calcium observed in essential hypertension may be linked to one or more of these alterations of calcium metabolism. 
4	Relevance of focal cerebral ischemia models. Experience with fibrinolytic agents. Despite the limitations of individual ischemia models, experience with fibrinolytic agents suggests that 1) early intervention with rt-PA may result in rapid thrombolysis, functional recovery, and decreased mortality in small animal stroke thromboembolism models, 2) rt-PA has no general effect on clinical recovery following MCA occlusion and reperfusion in the nonhuman primate at dose rates capable of producing very high circulating rt-PA levels, while u-PA has an apparently salutary effect, and 3) intravenous infusion of rt-PA or u-PA early after ischemia/infarction in several model systems is not associated with significant intracerebral hemorrhage. The true clinical relevance of these general impressions must await the completion of human studies and studies in well-conceived models designed to define the vascular consequences to be expected from reperfusion achievable with thrombolytic agents. 
5	Esophageal motility, heartburn, and gastroesophageal reflux: variations in clinical presentation of esophageal dysphagia. Dysphagia is a potentially important symptom, often leading to the finding of an anatomical or motility disorder of the esophagus. Dysphagia and heartburn represent two of the most common symptoms associated with esophageal motility disorders. To explore the relationship of symptomatic esophageal dysphagia and heartburn and their association with primary esophageal motor disorders, we have performed a retrospective assessment of 1035 patient evaluations performed at our gastrointestinal laboratory. A clear statistical association of symptomatic dysphagia and heartburn was established; however, no pattern diagnostic of a specific motility disorder was discernible. A sizable fraction of our patient population with dysphagia demonstrated normal esophageal motility. A significant portion of dyspeptic patients exhibited both normal motility and acid exposure. The differences observed between the incidence of subjective symptoms and objective dysfunction may be explained in part by an altered or increased esophageal sensitivity of these patients. 
1	Parathyroid hormone-like peptide in normal and neoplastic mesothelial cells. Mesothelioma has not been commonly reported as a cause of hypercalcemia of malignancy. We have studied a patient with malignant mesothelioma and hypercalcemia in association with elevated plasma concentrations of parathyroid hormone-like peptide (PLP). Immunohistochemical analysis of the tumor and seven of eight other mesotheliomas that were not associated with hypercalcemia revealed the presence of PLP cytoplasmic immunopositivity. PLP immunopositivity was also detected in normal and reactive mesothelial cells. The results of these studies suggest that PLP immunoreactivity is common in normal and neoplastic mesothelial cells and raises the possibility that PLP production may play a role in the pathogenesis of hypercalcemia associated with mesothelioma. 
1	Genetic analysis as an aid in diagnosis for patients with midline carcinomas of uncertain histologies The tumors of nine patients with carcinomas of uncertain histogenesis (eight with poorly differentiated carcinomas involving primarily midline structures and one with a diagnosis of seminoma and atypical clinical features) were studied by cytogenetic and Southern blot analyses. Four of the eight patients with poorly differentiated carcinomas had abnormalities of chromosome 12 consistent with a diagnosis of germ cell tumor. These abnormalities comprised an i(12p) in two patients and a del(12q) in a third patient detected by cytogenetic analysis and multiple copies of 12p detected by Southern blot analysis in a fourth patient. Three of these four patients with a diagnosis of germ cell tumor established by genetic analysis achieved a complete response to cisplatin-based chemotherapy. The tumor biopsy of one patient showed a t(11;22) (q24;q12), and this patient had chemotherapy directed to neuroepithelioma. Cytogenetic analysis was unsuccessful for the tumors of three patients; these tumors did not have multiple copies of 12p detected by Southern blot analysis. These patients did not respond to cisplatin-based chemotherapy. One patient with a diagnosis of extragonadal seminoma failed to respond to cisplatin-based chemotherapy and had a second tumor biopsy performed that demonstrated a t(8;14) (q24;q32). This patient's diagnosis was changed to a non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. Thus, genetic analysis provided a diagnosis in six of nine patients. Cytogenetic and molecular analyses are useful clinical tools for the determination of histogenesis in some patients with poorly differentiated carcinomas of uncertain histology. 
5	Amputation or limb-lengthening for partial or total absence of the fibula. Thirty-two patients who had ablation of the foot by the Syme or Boyd technique for partial or total absence of the fibula, with subsequent fitting of a prosthesis, were compared with eleven patients who had lengthening of the lower limb by the Wagner method, to assess the long-term results of each procedure. The final results were evaluated on the basis of pain, limp, limb-length discrepancy, level of physical activity, and satisfaction of the patient. Of the thirty-two patients who had an amputation, twenty-eight (88 per cent) had a satisfactory result, compared with only six (55 per cent) of the eleven patients who had limb-lengthening. The amount of inequality between the lower limbs was classified as follows: Group I--the foot of the shorter extremity was at the distal third of the contralateral, normal limb, and the percentage of shortening was 15 per cent or less; Group II--the foot of the shorter extremity was at the level of the middle third of the contralateral, normal limb, and the percentage of shortening was between 16 and 25 per cent; and Group III--the foot of the shorter extremity was at the level of the proximal third of the contralateral, normal limb, and the percentage of shortening was greater than 26 per cent. Lengthening was best suited for patients in Group I who had stable hips, knees, and ankles and a plantigrade foot. Patients in Groups II and III were best served by ablation of the foot and fitting of a prosthesis. 
4	Circumflex artery ventricular fistula and pseudoaneurysm after mitral reoperation. Prosthetic mitral valve reoperation complicated by atrioventricular groove pseudoaneurysm and circumflex ventricular fistula is presented. Ligation of the circumflex artery during mitral valve replacement is implicated after review of a previous cardiac angiogram. 
5	Postoperative hypertension: a prospective, placebo-controlled, randomized, double-blind trial, with intravenous nicardipine hydrochloride. Nicardipine hydrochloride, a new calcium channel blocker for intravenous use, has been compared with placebo in a prospective, randomized, double-blind trial on postoperative hypertension. Of 175 patients who signed preoperative consent, 24 (13.7%) met entry criteria. Hypertension was significantly better controlled in nicardipine-treated patients compared with those receiving placebo (93% versus 30%, p less than 0.05). All the placebo failures were subsequently successfully treated with nicardipine. There were no significant complications in either group. The authors conclude that nicardipine HC1 is an effective, safe therapy for postoperative hypertension. Further studies are now indicated comparing it with other drugs currently used to treat this condition. 
1	Decreased local toxicity with subcutaneous diamorphine (heroin): a preliminary report. We report the cases of 5 patients who developed severe local toxicity during the subcutaneous administration of morphine sulphate and hydromorphone hydrochloride. All patients required site changes more frequently than once every 24 h due to redness, swelling, or pain while receiving morphine or hydromorphone. All patients showed prolongation in the duration of sites of infusion once an equianalgesic dose of diamorphine hydrochloride (heroin) was started. No change in pain control or systemic toxicity was detected with diamorphine. These findings suggest that diamorphine could be a useful alternative for patients who develop severe toxicity to subcutaneous morphine or hydromorphone. 
5	Inflammatory nodular reactions after hepatitis B vaccination due to aluminium sensitization. In 2 patients, pruritic nodules appeared after revaccination against hepatitis B. Aluminium was found to be responsible for this side effect: contact allergy to aluminium was present in both patients, whereas controls were negative. 
1	Congenital cystic disease of the seminal vesicle. Thirteen cases of congenital seminal vesicle cysts with pathologic correlation were diagnosed between 1970 and 1988. Twelve of the 13 patients had ipsilateral renal anomalies. Intravenous urography, performed in 11 of the 13 patients, demonstrated associated renal anomalies. Computed tomography, performed in nine of the 13 patients, demonstrated associated renal anomalies and displayed the cystic seminal vesicles. Transabdominal or endorectal ultrasonography, performed in eight patients, allowed characterization of the seminal vesicle masses as cystic. Magnetic resonance imaging, performed in three of the 13 patients, accurately demonstrated dilated ejaculatory ducts into which ectopic ureters inserted. The fluid in the seminal vesicle cysts had an increased signal intensity on T1- and T2-weighted sequences. Seminal vesiculographic study demonstrated anomalous communications with the seminal tract. Cystic disease of the seminal vesicles can be either congenital or acquired; congenital cysts are associated with anomalies of the ipsilateral mesonephric duct. 
3	Bacterial or viral meningitis? Measuring lactate in CSF can help you know quickly. Measurement of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) lactate is a useful test when properly applied to the appropriate clinical situation and can offer information other CSF parameters cannot provide. Except for Gram's stain of CSF, lactate level is the most important CSF parameter in the early differentiation of viral (aseptic) and bacterial purulent meningitis. 
3	Ischemic brain damage: reduction by sodium-calcium ion channel modulator RS-87476. A novel sodium-calcium ion channel modulator, RS-87476, reduced cerebral infarct size in cats subjected to permanent unilateral occlusion of the middle cerebral artery. Cerebral injury was assessed in vivo with a combination of magnetic resonance (MR) imaging and spectroscopy for 5-12 hours after occlusion and was compared with the area of histochemically ischemic brain tissue. Compared with infarcts in placebo-treated animals, infarcts in cats given RS-87476 were reduced by an average of 70% at the lowest dose, 75% at the intermediate dose, and 88% at the highest dose. Tissue edema, observed as areas of signal hyperintensity on diffusion- and T2-weighted spin-echo images, was confined to small regions of the parietal cortex and basal ganglia in drug-treated animals. Mean plasma levels of RS-87476 at the lowest dose were 13 ng/mL initially, falling to maintenance levels of 3-5 ng/mL; at the intermediate and highest doses, plasma levels of drug were approximately five- and 20-fold greater. The drug was only slightly hypotensive. At least part of the potent cerebroprotective effects of RS-87476 result from its ability to stabilize metabolic energy reserves, reduce lactate formation in ischemic tissues, and attenuate intracerebral edema. 
3	Valgus deformities of the feet and characteristics of gait in patients who have rheumatoid arthritis. To investigate the cause of valgus deformity of the hindfoot in patients who have rheumatoid arthritis and to characterize the effects of the deformity on gait, two groups of patients were evaluated clinically, radiographically, and with gait analysis in the laboratory. Group 1 consisted of seven patients who had seropositive rheumatoid arthritis and normal alignment of the feet and Group 2, of ten patients who had rheumatoid arthritis and valgus deformity of the hindfoot. In Group 2, the disease was of longer duration and the feet were more painful than in Group 1. There was no evidence of muscular imbalance, equinus contracture, valgus deformity of the tibiotalar joint, or isolated deficiency of the tibialis posterior (such as weakness, tenosynovitis, or rupture of the tendon) that could have contributed to the development of the valgus deformity. In the patients who had valgus deformity, quantitated electromyography demonstrated that the intensity and duration of activity of the tibialis posterior was significantly increased, apparently in an effort to support the collapsing longitudinal arch of the foot. Gait studies revealed decreases in velocity, stride length, and single-limb-support time, as well as delayed heel-rise in both groups, but the decreases were more marked in the patients who had valgus deformity. The results of this study suggest that valgus deformity of the hindfoot in rheumatoid patients results from exaggerated pronation forces on the weakened and inflamed subtalar joint. These forces are caused by alterations in gait secondary to symmetrical muscular weakness and the effort of the patient to minimize pain in the feet. Radiographs also suggested an association between the valgus deformity of the feet and valgus deformity of the knees in patients who have rheumatoid arthritis. 
1	Unusual malignant neoplasms of the esophagus. Oat cell carcinoma, melanoma, and sarcoma. Primary noncarcinomatous malignant neoplasms of the esophagus are uncommon and data concerning treatment and results are sparse. To evaluate the results of therapy in this group, we reviewed the records of 32 patients with primary esophageal malignant tumors of unusual histologic type. Thirteen patients (41%) had sarcoma, eight (25%) melanoma, and 11 (34%) had oat cell carcinoma. Dysphagia was present in 78% (25/32) of the patients for a median of 13 weeks before diagnosis. Location of the esophageal primary tumor was upper third in four patients (12%), middle third in 12 (38%), and lower third in 16 (50%). Treatment consisted of esophagectomy in 10 of 13 patients with sarcoma (77%), seven of eight with melanoma (88%), and three of 11 with oat cell carcinoma (27%). Patients not undergoing resection received chemotherapy or radiation therapy, or both. The 3- and 5-year survival rates were 46% and 23% for sarcoma (median 20 months), 13% and 0% for melanoma (median 5 months), and 0% and 0% for oat cell carcinoma (median 5 months), respectively. Distant disease was the initial form of recurrence in 73% (11/15) of patients undergoing curative therapy. Surgical resection appears indicated for localized primary esophageal sarcoma. Optimum treatment of primary esophageal melanoma is less clear, but surgical resection may be of benefit in selected patients. Esophageal oat cell carcinoma is a systemic disease necessitating systemic therapy with local therapy reserved for palliation of dysphagia. 
3	Toxoplasmosis of the conus medullaris in a patient with hemophilia A-associated AIDS. Case report. Toxoplasma gondii has been reported to be the most common cause of focal brain lesions in patients with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS). A case of intramedullary toxoplasmosis of the conus medullaris is reported in a patient with hemophilia A-associated AIDS. The diagnosis is discussed, with particular emphasis on the magnetic resonance imaging appearance. 
5	Clinicopathologic features and long-term results of alpha-fetoprotein-producing gastric cancer. During a 10-yr-period, 24 cases of alpha-fetoprotein-producing gastric cancer were experienced in our department. The mean age was 62.5 yr, and the sex ratio of males to females was 3:1. Borrmann II and III types of gastric cancer were predominant (83.3%). The prognosis was dismal. Most of the patients, including three radically operated cases of early gastric cancer, died from liver metastasis within 2 yr. The 1-, 3-, and 6-yr survival rates were 37.5%, 8.3%, and 8.3%, respectively, for all cases and 75.0%, 25.0%, and 25.0% for radically operated cases. The incidences of synchronous and metachronous liver metastasis were 31.8% and 40.9%, significantly higher than the incidences of AFP-negative gastric cancer (p less than 0.91). Despite radical gastrectomy, metachronous liver metastasis occurred in 75.0% of the cases. Two radical hepatic resections, including extended right lobectomy, were performed in one patient with early gastric cancer who had repeated metachronous liver metastasis. However, the tumor recurred immediately. Apparently, radical gastrectomy or hepatic resection alone may not suffice for this particular type of cancer. The methods of treatment and follow-up considered should be different from that for other types of gastric cancer. 
5	Angiographic arterial embolization and computed tomography-directed drainage for the management of hemorrhage and infection with abdominal pregnancy. Hemorrhage during or after surgery, pelvic abscess, bowel obstruction, and prolonged febrile morbidity can complicate the puerperal course of the gravida after removal of an extrauterine fetus with nondisturbance of the extrauterine placenta. In this report we describe the successful angiographic arterial gelfoam embolization of the placental vascular bed to control heavy postoperative hemorrhage in a mother suffering adult respiratory distress syndrome after removal of the fetal portion of her abdominal pregnancy. Six weeks later, computed tomography (CT)-directed drainage by catheter of a placental abscess was performed. Selective angiographic transcatheter embolization with gelfoam is a useful tool for the control of hemorrhage in the gravida who is an unfavorable operative candidate or who may present technical hemostasis problems peculiar to the placenta with abdominal pregnancy. Later use of CT-directed catheter drainage of the infected residual placental mass provided a nonoperative means of treatment. 
5	Blood loss reduced during hip arthroplasty by lumbar plexus block. We measured the blood loss during and after hip replacement in two groups of women, each consisting of 10 patients. In one group the lumbar plexus was infiltrated with bupivacaine, in the other it was not. The group in whom the plexus was blocked had significantly less blood loss. 
4	Cardiac conducting tissue. A simplified technique for examination of the SA and AV nodes. We describe a modified method for examination of the atrioventricular and sinoatrial nodes that displays the major elements of the cardiac conducting system, yet is not time-consuming for the technician. We examined 31 cases in three categories: cases with previous cardiac history, sudden deaths from no known cause, and cases where death was sudden and accidental. All cases showed histologic abnormalities in the cardiac tissue. We contend that our method would permit such examination to be routinely used in the pathology laboratory. 
4	Percutaneous mitral valvuloplasty in surgical high risk patients. Among 126 consecutive patients undergoing percutaneous mitral valvuloplasty, 34 were judged to be at high risk for surgery on the basis of age greater than 70 years (n = 13), New York Heart Association functional class IV (n = 11), ejection fraction less than or equal to 35% (n = 3), severe pulmonary hypertension (n = 7), need for associated coronary bypass (n = 4) or additional valve surgery (n = 20) or severe pulmonary disease (n = 3). Baseline features of the high risk group were substantially worse than those of the other patients: age (65 +/- 11 versus 49 +/- 12 years; p = 0.0001) and echocardiographic score (9.4 +/- 1.8 versus 8.2 +/- 1.5; p = 0.005) were higher, whereas cardiac output (2.9 +/- 0.9 versus 4.1 +/- 1.2 liters/min; p = 0.0001) and mitral valve area (0.9 +/- 0.4 versus 1.1 +/- 0.3 mm2; p = 0.002) were lower. Three high risk patients experienced technical failures and three others had major complications. Among the remaining 28 patients, 18 (65%) had a complete hemodynamic success, 4 (14%) an incomplete success and 6 (21%) hemodynamic failure. Stepwise logistic regression analysis retained echocardiographic score as the only factor independently predictive of success. The percent increase in mitral valve area also correlated with echocardiographic score (r = 0.51, p less than 0.01). 
3	Stereotactic radiosurgery of meningiomas. Stereotactic radiosurgery has an expanding role in the management of selected intracranial tumors. In an initial 30-month experience using the 201-source cobalt-60 gamma knife at the University of Pittsburgh, 50 patients with meningiomas were treated. The most frequent site of origin was the skull base. Previously, 36 patients (72%) had undergone at least one craniotomy and four patients (8%) had received fractionated external beam radiation therapy. Stereotactic radiosurgery was the primary treatment modality in 16 patients (32%) with symptomatic tumors demonstrated by neuroimaging. Computer imaging-generated isodose plans (with one to five irradiation isocenters) for single-treatment irradiation gave optimal (greater than or equal to 50% isodose line) coverage in 44 patients (88%). The proximity of cranial nerves or vascular, pituitary, and brain-stem structures to the often convoluted tumor mass was crucial to dose selection. Serial imaging studies were evaluated in all 50 patients. Twenty-four patients were examined between 12 and 36 months after treatment; 13 (54%) showed a reduction in tumor volume while nine (38%) showed no change. Of 26 patients evaluated between 6 and 12 months after treatment, four showed a decrease in tumor size while 22 showed no change. Two patients (both with large tumors that received suboptimal irradiation) had delayed tumor growth outside the radiosurgical treatment volume. The actuarial 2-year tumor growth control rate was 96%. Between 3 and 12 months after radiosurgery, three patients developed delayed neurological deficits that gradually improved, compatible with delayed radiation injury. Although extended follow-up monitoring over many years will be necessary to fully evaluate treatment, to date stereotactic radiosurgery has proved to be a relatively safe and effective therapy for selected patients with symptomatic meningiomas, including those who failed surgical resection. Radiosurgery was an effective primary treatment alternative for those patients whose advanced age, medical condition, or high-risk tumor location mitigated against surgical resection. 
2	Rectal prolapse in infants and children. Rectal prolapse that is intractable to the usual medical therapy was successfully managed without significant complications in 10 patients by simple subcutaneous encirclement of the anus with a heavy nonabsorbable suture, which was in place until the suture was removed or broke after 4 to 6 months. Four patients required two sutures and one needed a third insertion. Since this procedure is simple, has no serious complications, and controls rectal prolapse, it is recommended as the preferred initial surgical treatment of this condition. 
4	Clinical efficacy of flosequinan in heart failure. The effects of the new arterial and venous vasodilator flosequinan have been evaluated in a variety of ways in different groups of patients with chronic heart failure. Flosequinan improved the central hemodynamic effects of heart failure in one group, with benefits still apparent up to 24 hours after a single oral dose. In another group it also improved calf blood flow and, therefore, blood flow to skeletal muscle. Also, using a number of different tests, it improved the exercise performance of the patients. In a further group the improvement in exercise tolerance produced was similar to that of captopril. Flosequinan has the necessary properties of a drug that is likely to be of benefit in the treatment of patients with chronic heart failure. 
4	Regional changes in creatine kinase and myocyte size in hypertensive and nonhypertensive cardiac hypertrophy. Several intracellular enzymes have been shown to have altered total activity or isoenzyme composition in cardiac hypertrophy. This study tests the hypothesis that the accumulation of the fetal-type (BB + MB) creatine kinase (CK) isoenzymes in hypertrophied adult myocardium is related to an increase in blood pressure. Consideration was made for the location, size, and hemodynamic load of the myocytes. By using the two-kidney, one-clip (2K1C) rat model of renal hypertension with and without hydralazine treatment, CK (total and isoenzyme), lactate dehydrogenase, and citrate synthase activities and myocyte size were measured. An increased heart weight/body weight ratio occurred in both untreated 2K1C rats (4.15 +/- 0.09) and hydralazine-treated 2K1C rats (4.12 +/- 0.13) as compared with control rats (3.25 +/- 0.10). Blood pressure was high only in untreated 2K1C rats (196 +/- 9 mm Hg), as compared with hydralazine-treated 2K1C rats (142 +/- 6 mm Hg) and control rats (135 +/- 3 mm Hg). Myocytes were isolated from five ventricular regions: left ventricular epicardial and endocardial free wall, left and right halves of the interventricular septum, and right ventricular free wall. Regional differences in normal and hypertrophied myocardium were demonstrated for morphological and biochemical parameters, with the greatest changes occurring in left ventricular endocardium. The shift in CK isoenzyme expression toward accumulating more BB + MB was greater in "hypertensive hypertrophy" (untreated 2K1C rats) than in "nonhypertensive hypertrophy" (hydralazine-treated 2K1C rats). Calculations incorporating isolated myocyte volume showed that the cellular content of total CK remained the same during the hypertrophic process, accounting for a decrease in the tissue activity. Measurement of lactate dehydrogenase and citrate synthase activities suggests that hypertrophied myocardium has relatively higher glycolytic capacity and that this effect is exacerbated in the presence of high blood pressure. We conclude that increased blood pressure is more closely linked to the fetal CK isoenzyme shift than is hypertrophy alone. 
4	Low-dose aspirin. II. Relationship of angiotensin II pressor responses, circulating eicosanoids, and pregnancy outcome. Forty pregnant women (28 to 32 weeks' gestation) were given low-dose aspirin therapy (81 mg/day) from the time of enrollment until delivery; circulating eicosanoid levels and angiotensin II pressor responses were measured before and after 1 week of aspirin therapy. Subsequent clinical outcome was correlated with these results. All women had significant reductions in serum and plasma thromboxane B2 levels with aspirin treatment (p less than 0.01). Eleven women who remained sensitive to the pressor effects of angiotensin II (effective pressor dose less than 10 ng/kg/min) after 1 week of low-dose aspirin treatment exhibited significant decreases (p less than 0.05) in plasma 6-keto-prostaglandin F1 alpha (264 +/- 119 vs 161 +/- 31 pg/ml, mean +/- SD) and prostaglandin E2 (476 +/- 174 vs 351 +/- 112 pg/ml) levels. In contrast, patients who were either nonsensitive (refractory) to angiotensin II (n = 18; greater than or equal to 10 ng/kg/min) before aspirin or became nonsensitive after aspirin administration (n = 11) had no change in either plasma 6-keto-prostaglandin F1 alpha or prostaglandin E2 concentrations. The occurrence of pregnancy-induced hypertension was 100% in the women who remained angiotensin II sensitive during aspirin therapy as compared with 36% and 39% in the other two groups (x2 = 16.14; p less than 0.001). Thus during low-dose aspirin therapy a failure to develop refractoriness to infused angiotensin II is associated with a nonselective inhibition of eicosanoids and the almost certain development of pregnancy-induced hypertension. These observations may reflect a basic defect in vascular adaptation to pregnancy. 
1	Cytotoxic T cell clones isolated from ovarian tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes recognize multiple antigenic epitopes on autologous tumor cells. CTL clones were developed from tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (TIL) from the ascites of a patient with ovarian carcinoma by coculture of TIL with autologous tumor cells and subsequent cloning in the presence of autologous tumor cells. These CTL clones expressed preferential cytolytic activity against autologous tumor cells but not against allogeneic ovarian tumor cells and the NK-sensitive cell line K562. The cytolytic activity of these CTL against autologous tumors was inhibited by anti-TCR (WT31 mAb), anti-HLA class I, and anti-CD3 mAb but not by the NK function antibody Leu 11b. Cloning of the autologous tumor cells in vitro revealed that the CTL clones of the ovarian TIL expressed differential abilities to lyse autologous tumor cell clones. The specificity analysis of these autologous tumor specific CTL suggested that they recognize several antigenic determinants present on the ovarian tumor cells. Our results indicate the presence of at least three antigenic epitopes on the tumor cells (designated OVA-1A, OVA-1B, and OVA-1C), one of which (OVA-1C) is unstable. These determinants are present either simultaneously or separately, and six types of ovarian clones can be distinguished on the basis of their expression. These results indicate that CTL of the TIL detect intratumor antigenic heterogeneity. The novel heterogeneity identified within the ovarian tumor cells in this report may be of significance for understanding cellular immunity in ovarian cancer and developing adoptive specific immunotherapeutic approaches in ovarian cancer. 
2	Experimental obliterative cholangitis. A model for the study of biliary atresia. Noninfectious obliterative cholangitis results from biliary tract inflammation in clinical conditions such as biliary atresia and sclerosing cholangitis. The purpose of this study was to develop an animal model of noninfectious biliary tract inflammation and fibrosis. An implantable osmotic pump was connected to a catheter placed into the gallbladder of hamsters. Phorbol myristate acetate (PMA) was infused into the biliary tract for periods of 6 hours to 28 days. After 7 days the animals developed neutrophil infiltration, cellular necrosis, and edema of the biliary ducts. After 14 days, the animals demonstrated intrahepatic cholestasis with bile duct fibrosis and acute and chronic inflammatory cell infiltration. By 28 days pronounced portal fibrosis was present, some of which created an early bridging cirrhosis pattern. In addition there was evidence of neocholangiogenesis. We conclude that long-term PMA infusion into the biliary tract generates an inflammatory response characterized by obliterative cholangitis and fibrosis, sharing many of the histologic features of human biliary atresia. This model may provide a relatively simple technique for investigating the process of nonpyogenic biliary tract inflammation. 
1	Chest CT combined with artificial pneumothorax: value in determining origin and extent of tumor. To determine the presence of chest wall and mediastinal invasion by lung cancer and to establish the origin of chest tumors, we studied 12 patients with intrathoracic tumors by using chest CT combined with artificial pneumothorax. Six patients had primary lung cancer, two had metastases, and one each had neurofibroma, pericardial cyst, chondroma of the rib, and malignant mesothelioma. All 12 tumors abutted the chest wall or mediastinum and could not be separated by conventional CT. Between 400 and 800 ml of air was injected into the pleural space before a second CT scan was obtained. No invasion was found at surgery in cancers that were separated from chest wall or mediastinum on CT scans. Surgery revealed chest wall invasion in three patients in whom the CT scans showed that the tumor was not separated from the chest wall. Only one patient with a tumor that was not separated from the mediastinum on CT did not have mediastinal invasion: in this case, only adhesions were found at surgery. Thus, in the eight patients with primary lung cancer and metastasis, sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy were 100%, 80%, and 88%, respectively. In four patients with mediastinal or pleural tumor, CT combined with pneumothorax was useful for establishing the origin of tumors. In all, 11 of the 12 patients were correctly evaluated by using this method. No complications occurred, except for mild chest discomfort in one patient. This study suggests that chest CT combined with artificial pneumothorax is useful for the evaluation of the extension of lung cancer into the chest wall and mediastinum and for the diagnosis of the site of origin of intrathoracic tumors. 
5	'Two-stage turbinectomy': sequestration of the inferior turbinate following submucosal diathermy. Submucous diathermy of the inferior turbinates is a widely practised procedure. Three cases are presented in which surgery was complicated by avascular necrosis of the turbinate bone. Each patient required a debridement procedure before healing and recovery of normal mucociliary function could take place. 
5	Hemodynamic basis of stasis ulceration--a hypothesis. Approximately 25% of patients with stasis ulceration have normal or below normal ambulatory venous pressures. A reflux index was calculated by multiplying postexercise pressures by Valsalva-induced foot venous pressure elevation. In patients with stasis ulceration, reflux index was found to have an excellent negative predictive value with a clear discriminant line between normal limbs and those with ulcers. Increasing incidence of stasis ulceration was demonstrated with increasing reflux index value. Even when ambulatory venous pressure was within the normal range, the index was found to be abnormal in ulcerated limbs because Valsalva-induced foot venous pressure was elevated in these limbs. Conversely, some patients with stasis ulceration and normal Valsalva foot venous pressure elevation were found to have abnormal ambulatory venous pressure values, yielding an elevated reflux index. Preliminary analysis indicates that reflux index may be a better predictor of surgical outcome after valve reconstruction procedures than either ambulatory venous pressure or Valsalva-induced foot venous pressure elevation. The concept of reflux index is a hypothesis that attempts to explain inconsistencies observed in implicating ambulatory venous hypertension as the sole determinant of venous reflux. 
5	The role of bacteria in pigment gallstone disease. One hundred ten of nine hundred sixty consecutive patients who underwent surgery for gallstones (GS) had pigment stones (PS) (11.45%). Fifty brown PSs contained calcium bilirubinate, small amounts of cholesterol, and always calcium palmitate, were usually found in the common duct (96%), and were almost always associated with bile infection (98%) and diffuse erosion of the biliary mucosa. Fifty-one black PSs contained bilirubin polymers, calcium carbonate, and/or phosphate, seldom cholesterol, and never evident amounts of calcium palmitate, were mostly found in the gallbladder, and were associated with hemolysis or liver damage and with hyperplastic cholecystosis. Bile infection was found in 19.6% of cases, but bacteria were never found in the center of black PSs by scanning electron microscopy. Nine additional patients (8.2% of PSs, 0.9% of GSs) had concomitant black and brown PSs that were mostly found in the common duct and were always associated with bile infection. It is suggested that, even if PSs with concomitant black and brown material can be found, black and brown PSs greatly differ not only in pathogenesis but also in clinical behavior and treatment. In particular bacterial infection is important only in the pathogenesis of brown PSs while it plays no role in the initial formation of cholesterol, mixed or black GSs. 
2	Spontaneous reactivation in chronic hepatitis B: patterns and natural history. We identified spontaneous reactivation of hepatitis B virus (HBV) retrospectively by utilizing serum alanine aminotransferase and HBV DNA in 19 men (79% homosexual), with an estimated annual incidence of 7.3%. In 11 patients, spontaneous reactivation occurred as a single episode and in eight patients, reactivation was recurrent, with two to five episodes each. The mean serum alanine aminotransferase level was elevated over 10-fold at the peak of reactivation. Serum anti-HBc IgM was detected during 73% of the reactivation episodes. Actuarial analysis revealed that reactivation was long lasting with 45% and nearly 20% of episodes continued after 6 and 24 months, respectively. The course of 24 chronic HBV carriers with a negative serum HBV DNA test and normal alanine aminotransferase levels at initial appearance was unremarkable. We could not identify clinical features predictive of reactivation or its resolution. Severe reactivation hepatitis occurred in three patients (10%), with two deaths (6%). None of the patients lost HBsAg. Spontaneous reactivation in chronic hepatitis B can appear variably, persist long term, recur, and be fatal. Therefore, accurate classification of chronic HBV infection requires prolonged observation, and spontaneous reactivation should be considered a variable in therapeutic trials for chronic hepatitis B. 
3	Acupuncture and chronic pain: a criteria-based meta-analysis. A literature search revealed 51 controlled clinical studies on the effectiveness of acupuncture in chronic pain. These studies were reviewed using a list of 18 predefined methodological criteria. A maximum of 100 points for study design could be earned in four main categories: (a) comparability of prognosis, (b) adequate intervention, (c) adequate effect measurement and (d) data presentation. The quality of even the better studies proved to be mediocre. No study earned more than 62% of the maximum score. The results from the better studies (greater than or equal to 50% of the maximum score) are highly contradictory. The efficacy of acupuncture in the treatment of chronic pain remains doubtful. 
2	A field study of the safety and efficacy of two candidate rotavirus vaccines in a Native American population. A double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial was conducted to evaluate the safety and efficacy of a rhesus rotavirus vaccine and RIT 4237, a bovine rotavirus vaccine, in a Navajo population. Infants aged 2-5 months were randomized to receive one dose of either 10(4) pfu of the rhesus rotavirus vaccine or 10(8) pfu of the RIT 4237 vaccine or placebo. Eleven (10.2%) of 108 infants in the rhesus vaccine group, 11 (10.4%) of 106 in the RIT 4237 group, and 9 (8.4%) of 107 in the placebo group experienced rotavirus diarrhea during the follow-up period of 17 months. Thus, in this population, neither vaccine was efficacious in preventing rotavirus diarrhea. 
4	Reduction in infarct size by the phospholipase inhibitor quinacrine in dogs with coronary artery occlusion. It has been suggested that activation of tissue phospholipases may contribute to the development of ischemic cell injury. In the present study we sought to assess whether administration of the phospholipase inhibitor quinacrine would reduce the extent of myocardial necrosis after coronary artery occlusion. In open-chest, anesthetized dogs the left anterior descending coronary artery was ligated, and technetium-99-labeled albumin microspheres were injected into the left atrium to measure the area at risk. The animals were then randomly divided into a control group (n = 8) and a group receiving quinacrine (5 mg/kg intravenous bolus followed by a 40 micrograms/kg/min infusion for 6 hours; n = 9). The animals were killed 6 hours after occlusion, and the infarcted area was delineated by triphenyltetrazolium chloride staining. The extent of the risk region was similar in the two groups (32.3 +/- 2.1% of the left ventricle in control dogs and 34.2 +/- 3.4% in quinacrine-treated dogs). Infarct size was 86.4 +/- 8.8% of the risk region in control animals, whereas in treated dogs it averaged 62.3 +/- 6.4% of the risk region (p = 0.05). No differences were found in heart rate, arterial pressure, and rate-pressure product between the two groups. Thus administration of the phospholipase inhibitor quinacrine reduced the extent of myocardial necrosis in a model of fixed coronary artery occlusion. Preservation of membrane phospholipids, reduced formation of lipoxygenase metabolites, or both may mediate this phenomenon. 
4	Electrocardiographic subset analysis of diltiazem administration on long-term outcome after acute myocardial infarction. The Multicenter Diltiazem Post-Infarction Trial Research Group. The effect of diltiazem on long-term outcome after acute myocardial infarction (AMI) was assessed in 2,377 patients enrolled in the Multicenter Diltiazem Post-Infarction Trial and subsequently followed for 25 +/- 8 months. The study population included 855 patients (36%) with at least 1 prior AMI before the index infarction and 1,522 patients (64%) with a first AMI, of whom 409 (27%) had a first non-Q-wave AMI, 664 (44%) a first inferior Q-wave AMI, and 449 (30%) a first anterior Q-wave AMI. This post hoc analysis revealed that, among patients with first non-Q-wave and first inferior Q-wave AMI, there were fewer cardiac events during follow-up in the diltiazem than in the placebo group, and that the reverse was true for patients with first anterior Q-wave AMI or prior infarction. The diltiazem:placebo Cox hazard ratio (95% confidence limits) for the trial primary end point (cardiac death or nonfatal reinfarction, whichever occurred first) was: first non-Q-wave AMI-0.48 (0.26, 0.89); first inferior Q-wave AMI-0.66 (0.40, 1.09); first anterior Q-wave AMI-0.82 (0.51, 1.31); and prior AMI-1.11 (0.85, 1.44). Use of cardiac death alone as an end point gave an even more sharply focused treatment difference: first non-Q-wave AMI-0.46 (0.18, 1.21); first inferior Q-wave AMI-0.53 (0.27, 1.06); first anterior Q-wave AMI-1.28 (0.68, 2.40); prior infarction-1.26 (0.90, 1.77). Further analysis revealed that these differences in the effect of diltiazem in large part reflected the different status of the 4 electrocardiographically defined subsets in terms of left ventricular function.
