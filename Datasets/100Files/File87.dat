Role of thromboxane and serotonin as mediators in the development of spontaneous alterations in coronary blood flow and neointimal proliferation in canine models with chronic coronary artery stenoses and endothelial injury. Platelet-mediated obstruction of stenotic and endothelium-injured coronary arteries may be important in the abrupt progression from chronic stable to unstable coronary heart disease syndromes in patients. Transcardiac accumulation of thromboxane A2 and serotonin has been demonstrated in patients as chronic stable angina is converted to unstable angina. In this study in anesthetized open chest dogs with coronary artery stenosis and endothelial injury, thromboxane A2 and serotonin were shown to be important mediators of intermittent coronary obstruction caused by platelet aggregation and dynamic vasoconstriction. Furthermore, thromboxane A2 synthesis inhibitors and receptor antagonists and serotonin receptor antagonists, singly and together, provided substantial protection against repetitive platelet aggregation and dislodgment in canine models with coronary artery stenosis and endothelial injury even when systemic catecholamine concentrations were markedly elevated. These same observations apply in chronically instrumented, awake, unsedated dogs with coronary artery stenosis and endothelial injury in which recurrent platelet attachment and dislodgment cause cyclic flow alterations that may be prevented by thromboxane A2 synthesis inhibitors and receptor antagonists and serotonin receptor antagonists. Chronically instrumented dogs with coronary stenosis and endothelial injury in which recurrent platelet attachment and dislodgment occurred also developed neointimal proliferation of varying severity within 10 days to 3 weeks; the morphologic appearance of the neointimal proliferation was identical to that found in patients who develop restenosis after coronary angioplasty. 
Neurologic aspects of cobalamin deficiency. We reviewed 153 episodes of cobalamin deficiency involving the nervous system that occurred in 143 patients seen over a recent 17-year period at 2 New York City hospitals. Pernicious anemia was the most common underlying cause of the deficiency. Neurologic complaints, most commonly paresthesias or ataxia, were the first symptoms of Cbl deficiency in most episodes. The median duration of symptoms before diagnosis and treatment with vitamin B12 was 4 months, although long delays in diagnosis occurred in some patients. Diminished vibratory sensation and proprioception in the lower extremities were the most common objective findings. A wide variety of neurologic symptoms and signs were encountered, however, including ataxia, loss of cutaneous sensation, muscle weakness, diminished or hyperactive reflexes, spasticity, urinary or fecal incontinence, orthostatic hypotension, loss of vision, dementia, psychoses, and disturbances of mood. Multiple neurologic syndromes were often seen in a single patient. In 42 (27.4%) of the 153 episodes, the hematocrit was normal, and in 31 (23.0%), the mean corpuscular volume was normal. Neutropenia and thrombocytopenia were unusual even in anemic patients. In nonanemic patients in whom diagnosis was delayed, neurologic progression frequently occurred although the hematocrit remained normal. In 27 episodes, the serum cobalamin concentration was only moderately decreased (in the range of 100-200 pg/ml) and in 2 the serum level was normal. Neurologic impairment, as assessed by a quantitative severity score, was judged to be mild in 99 episodes, moderate in 39 and severe in 15. Severity of neurologic dysfunction before treatment was clearly related to the duration of symptoms prior to diagnosis. In addition, the hematocrit correlated significantly with severity, independent of the longer duration of symptoms in nonanemic patients. Four patients experienced transient neurologic exacerbations soon after beginning treatment with cyanocobalamin, with subsequent recovery. Followup evaluation was adequate to assess the neurologic response to vitamin B12 therapy in 121 episodes. All patients responded, and in 57 (47.1%), recovery was complete, with no remaining symptoms or findings on examination. The severity score was reduced by 50% or greater after treatment in 91% of the episodes. Residual long-term moderate or severe neurologic disability was noted following only 7 (6.3%) episodes. The extent of neurologic involvement after treatment was strongly related to that before therapy as well as to the duration of symptoms. The percent improvement over baseline neurologic status after treatment was inversely related to duration of symptoms and hematocrit. Some evidence of response was always seen during the first 3 months of treatment.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS). 
Hepatic failure and coma after liver resection is reversed by manipulation of gut contents: the role of endotoxin. Despite significant improvements in the surgical care of patients, hepatic failure after extensive liver resection continues to be associated with a high morbidity and death. We postulated that hepatic failure after liver resection was related to gut-derived endotoxemia. Rats were randomized to receive oral gavage twice daily with one of the following preparations: (1) 0.9% saline; (2) neomycin sulfate and cefazolin; (3) cholestyramine; (4) lactulose. After 7 days of gavage, animals underwent either a two-thirds partial hepatectomy or sham operation. At time 0 (preresection), 10, 20, and 30 hours after resection, aortic blood was obtained for determination of ammonia, glutamine, and endotoxin levels. In selected animals, portal vein or inferior caval blood was obtained simultaneously with the aortic sample to evaluate the glutamine and ammonia exchange across the intestine and hind limb. Germ-free rats also underwent a partial hepatectomy or sham operation, and blood was obtained for glutamine and ammonia exchange at 0 and 20 hours after resection. Hepatectomy in the saline-pretreated rats resulted in a sixfold increase in plasma glutamine, increased uptake of glutamine and release of ammonia by the gut, increased release of glutamine by the hind-limb, and a high mortality rate. Pretreatment with agents that altered gut contents reduced the endotoxemia, maintained normal glutamine and ammonia levels, and reduced the mortality rate. Germ-free rats had a similar response to that seen in treated animals. Altering the gut contents in this model reduced the level of endotoxemia, blunted the catabolic response, and enhanced survival. 
Entire ABL gene is joined with 5'-BCR in some patients with Philadelphia-positive leukemia. In four patients, the chromosome 9 breakpoint of the t(9; 22)(q34;q11) had occurred at different sites within an 8.25-kilobase (kb) region situated 5' of ABL exon 1B. Chromosome in situ hybridization and field inversion gel electrophoresis (FIGE) studies showed that ABL exons 1A and 1B were present on the Ph chromosome. Yet this large fusion gene produced an mRNA conventional for chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML). Splicing from BCR exon 3 to ABL exon 2 crossed more than 200 kb and deleted exons 1A and 1B. This breakpoint site may occur in about 10% of all CML patients. Three of our patients have pronounced thrombocytosis, and two had been diagnosed as having Ph-positive essential thrombocythemia. The platelet count of the other patient was not available. 
Ulcerative tracheobronchitis after lung transplantation. A new form of invasive aspergillosis. Invasive aspergillosis is frequently a fatal disease in the setting of immunosuppression, including organ transplant recipients. The fungus usually affects lung parenchyma and may disseminate from there. We have recently noted tracheobronchitis in six patients with heart-lung and lung transplants, three of whom had deep mucosal ulceration and histologic evidence of invasive aspergillosis. This apparently new form of invasive disease is initially limited to the anastomosis site and large airways. Ulceration, necrosis, cartilage invasion, and formation of a pseudomembrane are the pathologic features. In two patients subsequent disseminated aspergillosis occurred with a fatal outcome. In the two single-lung recipients, disease was limited to the transplanted side emphasizing the importance of abnormal local defense mechanisms in the airways of lung transplant recipients. Routine bronchoscopic examination of the airways is important in early detection of this complication. Oral therapy with the new, antifungal agent itraconazole was successful in five of the six patients, with fatal relapse in one. A classification of the various forms of saprophytic, allergic, and invasive forms of aspergillus tracheobronchitis, to include this new entity, is proposed. 
Concomitant benefit of preoperative irradiation in preventing pancreas fistula formation after pancreatoduodenectomy. Preoperative irradiation improves both the resectability and curability of carcinoma of the pancreas head area and should improve patient survival. We retrospectively investigated the value of preoperative irradiation in preventing pancreatic fistula formation. Of 76 consecutive patients who underwent pancreaticojejunostomy by mucosa-to-mucosa anastomosis with a stent catheter after pancreatoduodenectomy, 22 had received preoperative irradiation. The irradiation field included the anastomotic site. In two patients, accidental dislocation of the stent catheter was the apparent cause of fistula formation, but the other 21 patients in the irradiated group developed no fistula. In contrast, nine (17%) of 53 patients in the nonirradiated group developed fistulas. In the irradiated group, preoperative selenomethionine Se 75 scintigraphy revealed a cold area corresponding to the pancreas body, which was included in the irradiation field. Thus, a putative decrease in exocrine function at the pancreatic anastomotic site could explain why fistula formation was prevented by preoperative irradiation. 
Fulminant pulmonary aspergillus infection occluding the aortic arch after high-dose antileukemic chemotherapy. After antileukemic chemotherapy a granulocytopenic patient experienced a rapidly progressive left-sided pneumonia with pleuritic pain. After 1 week, a sudden occlusion of all aortic branches was followed by death. At postmortem, a huge thrombus in the aortic arch caused by Aspergillus invasion from the left lung was found. 
Pulsed-spray thrombolysis of arterial and bypass graft occlusions. Pulsed-spray thrombolysis is accomplished through forceful injection of a spray of highly concentrated urokinase into clot by using catheters with multiple side holes. We previously reported the immediate technical efficacy of the method in eight arterial and 10 bypass graft occlusions. We now describe the clinical efficacy of the method in a second, larger series of 23 native artery occlusions and 25 bypass graft occlusions. Transluminal angioplasty was performed after thrombolysis in 21 of the arteries and 24 of the bypass grafts. Initial thrombolysis was observed in all artery occlusions and all but one bypass graft occlusion with an average time for pulsed-spray lysis of 65 +/- 28 min in native arteries and 93 +/- 38 min in bypass grafts. Recanalization with improvement in symptoms or distal pulses after thrombolysis and angioplasty was achieved in 74% of treated arterial occlusions and 92% of treated graft occlusions. Of the 15 arteries that were recanalized and did not require adjunctive surgery, seven remained patent at 3-28 months follow-up. Nine of 23 recanalized bypass grafts required early adjunctive surgery. Of the nine synthetic and five saphenous vein grafts successfully recanalized and not requiring surgical revision, the mean patency was 4.3 +/- 3.1 months and 3.0 +/- 2.2 months, respectively. Minor complications were seen in 23% of cases. The two major complications (4%) involved one groin hematoma requiring surgery and one episode of gastrointestinal hemorrhage. We conclude that combined pulsed-spray thrombolysis and angioplasty achieve rapid and consistent arterial and graft recanalization with minimal risk. The method offers a favorable alternative to standard thrombolytic therapy of arterial occlusions. In occluded synthetic and vein bypass grafts, the technique is sometimes beneficial, either alone or combined with surgical revision. 
The personality pattern of duodenal ulcer patients in relation to spontaneous ulcer healing and relapse. One hundred consecutive out-patients with duodenal ulceration from a hospital and a gastroenterological clinic were tested with the Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory (MMPI). This was carried out in order to investigate whether neuroticism or other personality disorders were characteristics of duodenal ulcer patients, and whether the presence of such possible personality disorders might influence the prognosis of the disease. Neuroticism occurred in 53% of the patients, but only in 5% of controls (P less than 0.0001). Overall, personality disorders were present in 69% of the patients compared with 30% of the controls (P less than 0.0001). Neuroticism was connected with a high frequency of relapse (P less than 0.05) whereas failure of spontaneous ulcer healing had no certain relation to personality disorders. Patients with non-neurotic personality disorders had more frequently suffered stressful life events before entrance to the study (P less than 0.05) and, like the neurotic patients, they had lower ego-strength to cope with such events (P less than 0.05). The results indicate that personality assessments make it possible to distinguish between subgroups of duodenal ulcer patients with different course of the disease. 
Performance of age-matched controls on a battery of visuo-spatial neglect tests. Examination of 47 independent elderly subjects, matched with a population of patients with acute stroke, found that 55% made at least one omission on a battery of neglect tests. Up to 43% made omissions on any one test. Increasing age and other evidence of cognitive impairment were associated with impaired performance on the battery. Omissions were attributed to an age-related decline in visuo-spatial function. Cut-off points are provided to distinguish between such age-related impairment and visuospatial neglect. The importance of age-matched control studies in developing tests of cognitive impairment in stroke research is highlighted. 
Effect of intervention on development of hip posture in very preterm babies. Preterm babies are physiologically hypotonic, which causes their posture to be flattened when lying in the prone position. This flattened posture may persist beyond term. In a prospective, randomised, controlled, double blind trial of postural support carried out on 45 babies born at less than 33 weeks of gestation, we showed that infants positioned with specific hip support during the period of intensive care had significantly fewer features of flattened posture at the age equivalent to term. 
IIB osteosarcoma. Current management, local control, and survival statistics--the Australian experience. Current management of osteosarcoma at the authors' institution involves intraarterial induction chemotherapy using intermittent cycles of cisplatin and doxorubicin (Adriamycin), surgical resection with limb-sparing wherever possible, and adjuvant systemic chemotherapy (high-dose methotrexate with retrieval and doxorubicin). Twenty cases treated in this way between May 1983 and May 1989 are reviewed. There were 18 Stage IIB osteosarcomas and two Stage IIB malignant fibrous histiocytomas. Chemotherapeutic effect was evaluated in the resected tumors. There was little correlation between the clinical response to the induction chemotherapy and cell necrosis present in the resected tumor mass. Wide resection margins were achieved in 17 cases, a minimal margin in two, and a contaminated margin in one. Radiotherapy was used in these three cases where resection margin was in doubt. There were two local recurrences in these three cases. Four patients have died of their disease, and there was one treatment-related death. Overall probability of survival in this group of 20 patients has been expressed by the Kaplan-Meier method as 58%. 
Thoracic traction on the trachea: mechanisms and magnitude. Both inspiratory increases and tonic thoracic traction (pull of the thorax) on the trachea [Ttx(tr)] have been shown to improve patency of the upper airway. To evaluate the origins and magnitude of Ttx(tr), we studied 15 anesthetized tracheotomized dogs. We divided the midcervical trachea and attached the thoracic stub to a strain gauge. Ttx(tr), esophageal pressure, and carinal displacement were observed during various conditions. These included unobstructed and obstructed spontaneous breathing, mechanical ventilation at various levels of positive end-expiratory pressure, and progressive hypercapnic stimulation. Observations during spontaneous breathing were performed before and after vagotomy. We found that inspiratory increases in Ttx(tr) were substantial, averaging 81 +/- 8 g force and increasing to 174 +/- 22 g force at an end-expiratory CO2 concentration of 10%. Ttx(tr) did not result simply from the pull of mediastinal and pulmonary structures transmitted through the carina. Changes in intrathoracic pressure acted independently to either draw the trachea into or push the trachea out of the thorax. Thus Ttx(tr) could be explained as the sum of mediastinal traction and force generated by changes in intrathoracic pressure. 
Mixed cryoglobulinemia associated with chronic Q-fever. A 41-year-old woman who presented with purpura, glomerulonephritis and mixed cryoglobulinemia was found subsequently to have developed chronic Q-fever. Since Q-fever is a frequent cause of culture negative endocarditis in some endemic areas, the diagnosis of Q-fever endocarditis should be considered in patients presenting with mixed cryoglobulinemia of unknown cause. 
Inhibition of cyclooxygenase metabolite production attenuates ischemia-reperfusion lung injury. We investigated if cyclooxygenase metabolites of arachidonic acid were involved in ischemia-reperfusion lung injury by determining if inhibition of their production attenuated the injury. Isolated rat lungs were perfused with physiologic salt solution osmotically stabilized with Ficoll until circulating blood elements were not detected in lung effluent. Ischemia was induced by stopping ventilation and perfusion for 90 min. Lung ventilation and perfusion were then resumed. Ischemia-reperfusion resulted in the production of prostacyclin and thromboxane assessed by lung effluent and tissue measurements of their respective stable metabolites, 6-keto-PGF1 alpha thromboxane B2 (TxB2). In contrast, prostaglandin F2 alpha did not increase. Ischemia-reperfusion also caused lung injury as assessed by increased lung 125I-BSA accumulation compared with nonischemic control lungs. Addition of the cyclooxygenase inhibitors, indomethacin, or flubiprofen to the lung perfusate before and after ischemia inhibited lung injury as well as the production of 6-keto-PGF1 alpha and TxB2. Addition of a thromboxane synthetase inhibitor (U 63557A) reduced lung injury as well as TxB2 formation without affecting the production of 6-keto-PGF1 alpha. The attenuation of lung injury was not explained by direct H2O2 removal by indomethacin, flubiprofen, or U 63557A because the concentrations of the inhibitors used in the isolated lung experiments did not remove exogenously added H2O2 from buffer in vitro. We conclude that cyclooxygenase metabolites of arachidonic acid are involved in ischemia-reperfusion injury to isolated rat lungs. 
Hypoxemia is associated with mitochondrial DNA damage and gene induction. Implications for cardiac disease OBJECTIVE.--Oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) deficiency due to hypoxemia or other causes was hypothesized to increase oxygen radical generation, damage mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA), and reduce adenosine triphosphate synthesis, resulting in compensatory OXPHOS gene induction. Therefore, we investigated the levels of mtDNA damage and OXPHOS transcripts in normal and ischemic hearts, and then in other forms of heart disease. DESIGN.--DNA was extracted from the heart and the levels of the common 4977 base pair mtDNA deletion were quantitated as an index for mtDNA damage. Total RNA was extracted from hearts and analyzed for OXPHOS transcript levels. RESULTS.--In control hearts, the 4977 base pair mtDNA deletion appeared at age 40 years and reached a maximum deletion of 0.0035%. Much higher levels were found in ischemic hearts (0.02% to 0.85%), as well as in three of 10 cases with other types of heart disease (0.017% to 0.16%). The OXPHOS transcripts were increased in all diseased hearts. CONCLUSION.--Ischemic hearts have increased mtDNA damage and OXPHOS gene expression, suggesting that mtDNA damage is associated with OXPHOS deficiency. Oxidative phosphorylation defects may also play a role in some other forms of cardiac disease. 
Azygos vein laceration due to blunt trauma. The azygos vein ascends along the thoracic spine through the mediastinum and drains into the superior vena cava at the level of the fourth thoracic vertebra. Fracture-dislocation of the mid-thoracic spine, as a result of blunt thoracic trauma, can tear the azygos vein. Four such fatal cases (three motor vehicle accidents and one fall) were studied, only one of which was recognized prior to death. The vein can also be torn, in the absence of skeletal injuries, by horizontal acceleration/deceleration forces. The pathologist must consider azygos vein laceration as a possible cause of either hemothorax or hemomediastinum or both in a victim of a blunt chest trauma, if that individual had persistent hypotension during the few hours before death and no identifiable source of hemorrhage can be found postmortem in sites such as the heart, great vessels, lung, and chest wall. A fracture-dislocation of the thoracic spine may not necessarily be present. Azygos vein laceration seems to be an uncommon cause of hemothorax and hemomediastinum; however, this injury is probably more frequent than is implied by the few cases described in the medical literature. 
Cardiopulmonary arrest following an infusion of calcium 2-amino ethanol phosphate. The intravenous infusion of calcium 2-amino ethanol phosphate was coincidental with cardiopulmonary arrest in a 53-year-old woman with a history of multiple sclerosis. Resuscitation was followed by massive hemolysis, renal failure, adult respiratory distress syndrome, shock liver, and disseminated intravascular coagulation. This agent, in use by at least one practitioner in West Germany for the treatment of inflammatory and autoimmune disorders is not FDA approved for use in the United States, nor is clinical investigation underway. It is currently thought to be in use by about 200 practitioners throughout this country as treatment for multiple sclerosis. It is apparently obtained in West Germany and brought illegally into the United States. This is the first known report of an adverse drug reaction associated with the use of this product. 
Thrombolytic treatment in acute myocardial infarction: neutrophil activation, peripheral leucocyte responses, and myocardial injury. OBJECTIVE--To examine early leucocyte responses and neutrophil activation in acute myocardial infarction treated by streptokinase and to relate the findings to coronary recanalisation and indices of myocardial damage in order to provide further information about the role of neutrophils in the evolution of injury. DESIGN--Group analysis of paired blood samples, obtained before streptokinase treatment and one hour after it, and of three indirect measures of myocardial injury: left ventricular ejection fraction, QRS score, and peak creatine kinase. SETTING--The coronary care unit of a district general hospital. PATIENTS--39 patients with acute myocardial infarction who underwent paired blood sampling (before streptokinase and one hour after streptokinase) and cardiac catheterisation 5 (3-8) days later. END POINTS--Changes in peripheral white cell and neutrophil counts and plasma elastase one hour after streptokinase infusion. Comparison of these variables in patients with and without patency of the infarct related coronary artery. Correlations between these variables and indirect measures of myocardial injury. RESULTS--Neutrophil activation, as reflected by plasma elastase, increased sharply one hour after streptokinase. Total white cell and neutrophil counts also increased. Changes tended to be more pronounced in patients with patency of the infarct related artery, though the trend was not statistically significant. Neutrophil activation before streptokinase was unrelated to indirect indices of myocardial injury but only one hour after streptokinase a weak negative correlation with left ventricular ejection fraction had developed. Peripheral neutrophil responses showed a similar relation to ejection fraction and also correlated with peak creatine kinase and QRS score. CONCLUSIONS--Thrombolytic treatment in acute myocardial infarction is associated with an abrupt reactive neutrophil response which provides an early measure of injury. It is also associated with neutrophil activation, probably in response to coronary recanalisation and myocardial reperfusion. Activated neutrophils are recognised as mediators of reperfusion injury in experimental infarction and the data in the present study provide preliminary evidence of a similar pathogenic role in the clinical setting. 
Expression of androgen receptor mRNA in human hepatocellular carcinomas and hepatoma cell lines. The expression of androgen receptor messenger RNA in hepatocellular carcinomas and hepatoma cell lines was studied using Northern-blot analysis and the complementary DNA-polymerase chain reaction method. Androgen receptor messenger RNAs were detected (although in low levels) in both hepatocellular carcinoma tissues and noncancerous tissues of the liver in all eight cases we studied, except for the tumor sample of one case. None of the hepatoma cell lines studied, however, expressed detectable levels of androgen receptor messenger RNA except for the SK-HEP-1 hepatoma cell line. 
Depression and chronic fatigue in the patient with heart disease. Depression and chronic fatigue are frequently associated with heart disease. They may precede the onset of myocardial infarction, singly or together, and increase the morbidity and mortality of patients with a history of MI. Virtually all such patients have a transient depression, usually accompanied by anxiety, with onset soon after hospitalization. Although this depression is transient and usually abates spontaneously, it frequently warrants therapeutic intervention. Psychosocial and personality factors play a significant role in the recovery of a patient with a cardiac condition. The clinician must be alert for the effects of changing roles within the family and behaviors that may lead to chronic invalidism. Anxiety disorders, often combined with depression, may mimic cardiac disease and may result from it, leading to chronic fatigue and weakness. Proper diagnosis usually leads to considerable improvement. Cardiac drugs, in addition to many others, may produce depression and fatigue that may be misdiagnosed. Often, discontinuing or changing a medication will lead to marked diminution of such symptoms. Observational and listening skills are key ingredients of the "art" of medicine; they can lead to interventions that are not only therapeutic, but which improve the "quality" of life. 
Pulmonary angiitis and granulomatosis. The presentation of a patient with multiple pulmonary nodules with or without cavitation and often with signs of a multisystemic vasculitis should suggest one of the pulmonary angiitis and granulomatosis syndromes. The five conditions traditionally considered together in the category of pulmonary angiitis and granulomatosis differ widely in their cause and pathogenesis and are more appropriately considered as variants or relatives of other processes. The radiologic features of this group of diseases, however, are similar, and it is useful to still consider them together. Table 1 summarizes the radiologic features of these conditions. 
The prevention of the maternal manifestations of pre-eclampsia by intensive antihypertensive treatment. The purpose of the study was to determine if reduction of pregnancy hypertension to normal prevented the clinical maternal manifestations of pre-eclampsia. Thirty-six women with hypertension, but without proteinuria, were allotted at random to a test group of 17 who received intensive treatment, and a control group of 19 who were managed according to routine methods by hospital staff unconnected with the study. The development of proteinuria was chosen as an indicator of pre-eclampsia. Proteinuria developed significantly more often in the control group (in six of the 19 women) than in the test group (in one of the 17 women). 
Percutaneous iliac artery stent: angiographic long-term follow-up. The authors conducted a prospective study of 49 consecutive patients with 53 lesions in 52 iliac arteries. All were treated between October 1987 and April 1990 with percutaneous transluminal angioplasty (PTA) and insertion of either a self-expandable or balloon-expandable stent. Lesions included total occlusion (28%), dissection (42%), post-PTA restenosis (21%), and unsatisfactory PTA (9%). Complications included one aortic protrusion, one acute thrombosis of the stent (resolved with urokinase), and three distal embolizations (5.7%) (resolved with urokinase and aspiration). During 15 months of follow-up, two patients died (one after occlusion). Three other occlusions occurred; one of these was resolved with local thrombolysis. Hyperplasia occurred in seven cases (13.5%), and stenosis occurred at the end of the stent because of incomplete covering of the lesion in three (5.8%); a complementary procedure was performed in six of these cases. Primary patency was 85.3% at 12 months and 80.9% at 18 months; secondary patency rate was 96.1% at 12 and at 18 months. At the end of the study, excluding data for the two patients who died, 27 limbs (54%) were asymptomatic and improvement was achieved in 19 (38%); the clinical success rate was 92%. No amputations were required. 
Abdominal abscess due to Cardiobacterium hominis and Clostridium bifermentans. A case of abdominal abscess and bacteremia due to Cardiobacterium hominis and Clostridium bifermentans was successfully treated with surgical drainage and ampicillin-penicillin. This case represents the rare occurrence of C. hominis infection without apparent endocarditis. 
Testicular torsion: a surgical emergency. Testicular torsion is caused by twisting of the spermatic cord, which results in compromised testicular blood flow. The degree of ischemic injury is determined by the severity of arterial compression and the interval between the onset of symptoms and surgical intervention. Torsion usually occurs at puberty, and an anatomic defect known as "bell-clapper" deformity is usually present. Typical symptoms include acute scrotal pain with associated nausea and vomiting. Up to one-half of patients report previous similar episodes. On examination, the testis is high-riding, tender, swollen and firm. Testicular scan or Doppler ultrasound examination can be helpful in distinguishing torsion from acute epididymitis. Prompt surgical treatment is indicated to reduce the torsion, and bilateral orchiopexy is performed to prevent recurrence. Exocrine function, as determined by semen analysis, is often abnormal after unilateral torsion. 
Delayed visual loss due to trauma of the internal carotid artery. The group of six patients in this study experienced delayed visual loss following head trauma. Visual loss occurred from 1 day to 13 years after the initial injury. All patients suffered indirect trauma to the internal carotid artery resulting in formation of either an aneurysm or pseudoaneurysm or a carotid-cavernous fistula. Review of the radiologic and clinical findings was performed in six patients. The diagnosis was established by computed tomography, magnetic resonance imaging, and angiography. All patients had follow-up clinical evaluation and imaging studies. Treatment by neurosurgical or interventional neuroradiologic procedures resulted in significant visual improvement in five patients. Different pathophysiologic mechanisms could be correlated with the delayed visual loss produced by the two types of lesions. The pathologic changes associated with the aneurysms/pseudoaneurysms included direct compression of optic nerves and/or chiasm and intracranial hematoma. A carotid-cavernous fistula caused delayed visual loss by either hematoma at the orbital apex or compression of the chiasm and/or optic nerves by saccular dilatation of the cavernous sinus. The delayed onset of decreased vision following head trauma should alert the physician to the possibility of a traumatic aneurysm/pseudoaneurysm or a carotid-cavernous fistula. Different neuro-ophthalmologic symptoms can usually be correlated with the pathologic changes demonstrated by neuroimaging procedures. 
Right-sided aortic arch presenting as refractory intraoperative and postoperative wheezing. A 29-year-old woman presented with severe refractory intraoperative wheezing and airflow limitation that resolved spontaneously. Contrast-enhanced computed tomographic (CT) scan of the thorax confirmed a right-sided aortic arch. Variable intrathoracic large airway obstruction that worsened markedly when the patient was in a supine position and slightly more following intravascular volume expansion was shown on flow-volume studies. We postulate the right-sided aortic arch caused airflow obstruction that worsened intraoperatively because of position and intravenous fluids. 
First place--Resident Clinical Science Award 1990. Suppression of lymphokine-activated killer cell cytotoxicity by a soluble factor produced by squamous tumors of the head and neck. Incubation of human peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBL) in the presence of interleukin-2 results in the generation of lymphokine-activated killer (LAK) cells that are highly cytotoxic to a variety of autologous and allogenic tumor targets. We have identified a noncytotoxic, soluble factor, produced by human squamous cell cancers of the head and neck, that profoundly inhibits the generation of LAK cytotoxicity. Inhibition of the generation of cytotoxicity was demonstrated with coculture of PBL and freshly disaggregated tumor cells in a Transwell two-chamber system. Alternatively, inhibition occurred when LAK cells were generated in the presence of tumor-conditioned supernatants alone. These effects were not observed with conditioned supernatants from autologous or allogenic lymphocytes, human fibroblasts, or the erythroleukemia cell line K562. The presence of this inhibitory factor(s) was not required during the entire period of LAK generation. Suppression of cytotoxicity, measured after 4 days of LAK generation, could also be demonstrated when the conditioned tumor supernatant was present in only the last 24 hours of incubation. Suppression is mediated by a heat-labile factor with a molecular weight of greater than 75 kd. These results suggest that LAK cytotoxicity may be significantly impaired by soluble immunoregulatory factors present within the tumor milieu of squamous cell carcinomas of the head and neck. Further characterization of these factors may lead to the development of more rational and effective forms of immunotherapy. 
Adenylate cyclase activity in various components of the sarcoplasmic reticulum: a cytochemical study of ventricular biopsies from diseased human hearts. Localization of adenylate cyclase (ACLase) activity was studied in biopsies of diseased human myocardium by means of electron microscopic cytochemistry. Five right and seven left ventricular biopsy specimens were obtained from patients with idiopathic dilated (3 cases) and hypertrophic (3 cases) cardiomyopathies, various acquired (3 cases) and congenital (1 case) heart diseases, and other heart diseases (2 cases). Catecholamine-stimulated ACLase activity was assessed relative to the fine structure of cardiocytes. The most intense ACLase activity was found in the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR), but activity was also present in the sarcolemma. The enzyme activity was present in a wide morphologic spectrum of components of the SR, including junctional SR of internal and peripheral coupling (12 cases), free SR in association with myofibrils (6 cases), and free SR in association with mitochondria (5 cases). ACLase activity in junctional SR in the human myocardium resembles the findings in hearts of other mammalian species. The enzyme activity in human myocardial SR may represent a local regulatory function of the ACLase-cyclic AMP-phosphodiestrerase system in the SR components. 
Effect of a taurine-supplemented diet on conjugated bile acids in biliary surgical patients. The effect of a taurine-supplemented diet on the level of conjugated bile acids in postoperative patients was investigated during two consecutive 5-day period. Eighteen hepatobiliary patients with choledochostomies and a specific T-tube insertion were collected and divided randomly into two groups. In group 1, an ordinary postoperative soft diet was prescribed for the first 5 postoperative days and then followed with a taurine-supplemented soft diet (40 mumol/kg per day) for 5 consecutive days. In group 2, the taurine-supplemented diet was prescribed in reverse. At the end of the two periods, on days 5 and 10, bile was collected via a T-tube with an inflatable balloon and low-pressure motor suction. Analysis of conjugated bile acids was done by high-performance liquid chromatography. The results showed that a taurine-supplemented diet increased the concentration of taurocholic acid, glycocholic acid, taurochenodeoxycholic acid, glycochenodeoxycholic acid, and total bile acid from 0.5, 1.9, 0.3, 1.4, and 4.7 mg/mL (on day 5) to 1.1, 3.5, 1.0, 2.6, and 8.9 mg/mL, respectively, on day 10 in group 1. Similar findings were noted in group 2. These results indicate that a taurine-supplemented diet may enhance the conjugation and secretion of bile acid in hepatobiliary patients. 
Failure of right-sided coloanal anastomosis for treatment of left-sided ulcerative colitis. Report of a case. A patient with ulcerative colitis limited to the rectum and distal colon underwent a left hemicolectomy, a mucosal proctectomy, and a coloanal sleeve anastomosis using the normal proximal colon. She experienced macroscopic recurrence of her disease within 2 months of the operation and eventually required excision of the remaining colon and an end ileostomy. Our experience and that of others would indicate that a right-sided coloanal operation is unsuitable for the treatment of left-sided ulcerative colitis. 
Activated T-cell subsets in benign lymphoid hyperplasias and B-cell non-Hodgkin's lymphomas. Activated tumor-infiltrating T lymphocytes (TIL-T) were quantitated prospectively in excisional biopsy specimens of 49 B-cell non-Hodgkin's lymphomas (NHL) of various grades and compared with eight benign lymphoid hyperplasias (BLH) to identify any potential difference in host T-cell response. Immunotyping of tissue-cell suspensions was done by three-color flow cytometry, which was complemented by immunocytology by using cytocentrifuged preparations. Two activated T-cell subsets were studied: acutely activated TIL-T (CD3+ CD25+ HLADr-) and chronically activated TIL-T (CD3+ CD25- HLADr+). Results showed an association of the more aggressive intermediate/high-grade B-cell NHL with a higher percentage of late-phase activated TIL-T and a progressive increase with the grade of malignancy: 10.29%, 23.25%, 33.87%, and 47.78% (means) for BLH and for low-, intermediate- and high-grade B-cell NHL, respectively. Differences for this subset were significant (P less than 0.050) for the following comparisons: hyperplasia versus intermediate-grade NHL (P less than 0.0012), hyperplasia versus high-grade NHL (P less than 0.0002), and low versus high-grade NHL (P less than 0.0080). The percentage of acutely activated TIL-T cells did not show a statistically significant difference between the groups. The results suggest a host T-cell response to proliferating neoplastic cells in B-cell NHL. Paradoxically, the response does not appear to be protective for the host since the intensity is directly proportional to the grade of malignancy. However, the recognition of this response may have clinical applications since its amplification with biological response modifiers may result in effective adoptive immunotherapy of B-cell NHL. Further clarification of the specificity and biologic significance of host T-cell activation in B-cell NHL will require functional studies of isolated lymphocytic subpopulations from neoplastic tissue. 
Trends in the operative management of invasive squamous carcinoma of the vulva at Indiana University, 1974 to 1988. From January 1974 to March 1988, 150 patients with primary invasive squamous cell carcinoma of the vulva underwent surgery at Indiana University. There has been a trend toward more conservative surgical management of this disease. To determine the impact of this trend on clinical outcome, cases were divided into three groups according to date of operation: group I, 1974 to 1978; group II, 1979 to 1983; and group III, 1984 to 1988. Overall, 80 patients had en bloc radical vulvectomy and groin dissection, 20 had modified radical vulvectomy and bilateral groin dissection through three separate incisions, and 36 had modified radical vulvectomy and unilateral superficial groin dissection. Fourteen patients had other operations. Forty-two patients (27.3%) had radiotherapy in addition to surgery. Among the three groups, there were no differences when mean age, International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics stage distribution (1988 system), mean lesion size, mean depth of invasion, or grade distribution were compared. A significant trend toward more conservative surgical therapy was observed. En bloc radical vulvectomy was performed in 77.4% of group I patients, 71.1% of group II patients, and 35.8% of group III patients (p less than 0.001). Mean days of hospitalization were also reduced significantly. Group I had a mean stay of 30 days, group II had a mean stay of 23 days, and group III had a mean stay of 11 days (p less than 0.001). Mean operative blood loss (group I, 754.8 ml; group II, 620.0 ml; group III, 393.6 ml; p = 0.03), mean units of blood transfused (group I, 1.4 units; group II, 1.3 units; group III, 0.4 units; p less than 0.01), and mean hours of operating time (group I, 3.7 hours; group II, 3.7 hours; group III, 3.2 hours; p = 0.02) were also reduced. 
Incidence of gallstones in liver cirrhosis. We conducted a longitudinal follow-up of 72 patients with liver cirrhosis (LC) in order to assess gallstone (GS) incidence. The period of survey was 24.5 +/- 12.2 months. Patients were divided into two groups: group I--26 patients with ascites at the start or appearing during follow-up, and Group II--46 patients with compensated LC (no ascites) throughout the survey. During follow-up, 12 of 72 (16.6%) patients developed GS. The global cumulative incidence of GS was 5.5 cases/100 people/year. Age and sex had no influence on the incidence of GS in LC; neither had etiology or cirrhosis. On the contrary, the study revealed a significant increase in the incidence of GS in decompensated cirrhosis. In group I patients, GS appeared more frequently (34.6%) than in group II patients (6.5%) (chi 2 9.479; p less than 0.002). The cumulative incidence of GS was five times higher in decompensated versus compensated LC. 
Radionuclide angiographic evaluation of left ventricular diastolic function. Left ventricular diastolic function is altered in the majority of patients with cardiac diseases, especially those characterized by myocardial ischemia or hypertrophy. In many circumstances, such abnormalities related to impaired relaxation or reduced distensibility may precede evidence of left ventricular systolic dysfunction. Radionuclide angiography may be adapted to study the rapid filling phase of diastole, the duration of the isovolumic relaxation phase, the relative contributions of rapid filling and atrial systole to left ventricular stroke volume, and the relation between regional nonuniformity of left ventricular function and global filling properties. Technical aspects of data acquisition that must be considered for such studies include the effects of cardiac cycle length fluctuations, temporal resolution, temporal smoothing, and normalization parameters. As noninvasive radionuclide methods (and any other analyses using purely noninvasive techniques) do not permit assessment of the left atrial-left ventricular pressure gradient or the simultaneous evaluation of changes in left ventricular pressure and volume during relaxation and filling, complete clinical interpretation of "abnormal" left ventricular filling indexes, or changes in these indexes after interventions, is not possible. Despite the inherent limitations of noninvasive assessment of left ventricular diastolic function, radionuclide evaluation of left ventricular filling may provide clinically useful insights, especially in patients with congestive heart failure symptoms and normal left ventricular systolic function. 
Safety and efficacy of alfentanil and halothane in paediatric surgical patients. Alfentanil, a congener of the opioid fentanyl, possesses properties that make it an attractive choice for use during short operative procedures. Since the pharmacodynamic aspects of alfentanil have not been well documented in children, this study was undertaken to evaluate the safety, efficacy, and dose requirements of alfentanil when used with nitrous oxide or halothane in paediatric patients. Eighty unpremedicated patients, ASA physical status I or II and aged 2-12 yr were studied. Patients were randomly assigned to one of four groups. After induction of anaesthesia with nitrous oxide, oxygen, and halothane, the groups were treated as follows. In Group 1 (n = 19), after halothane was discontinued, alfentanil 50 micrograms.kg-1 was infused over 30 sec. In Group 2 (n = 20), the end-tidal halothan was maintained at 0.5% and alfentanil 25 micrograms.kg-1 was infused. In Group 3 (n = 20), the end-tidal halothane concentration was maintained at 1% and alfentanil 12.5 micrograms.kg-1 was infused. In Group 4 (n = 21), the end-tidal halothane concentration was maintained at 1.5% and no alfentanil was administered. Patients in Groups 1, 2, and 3 received bolus doses of alfentanil 12.5 micrograms.kg-1 as needed to maintain haemodynamic stability. After alfentanil administration, there were transient decreases in systolic blood pressure in Groups 1 and 2, and in heart rate in Group 2. With surgical stimulation, haemodynamic stability was well maintained except in patients in Group 1, who had an increase in systolic blood pressure. Children Group 1 were alert sooner and their tracheas were extubated earlier than those in Groups 2, 3, and 4. 
Pulse oximetry in acute asthma. The predictive value of pulse oximetry was evaluated in 100 patients who attended the emergency department with acute asthma. Oximetry after treatment with a cut off point of less than 91% had a sensitivity of 42% and specificity of 78% for unfavourable outcome, and oximetry before treatment had a sensitivity of 36% and a specificity of 57%. Despite its low sensitivity, oximetry after treatment does seem to have a role in minimising diagnostic errors in the emergency department, but only when used in conjunction with clinical assessment. 
Carcinoma of the larynx. Changing incidence in women. Laryngeal carcinoma has classically been considered a disease of men with a history of tobacco and alcohol abuse. Substantial increases in the incidence of laryngeal carcinoma have occurred among both men and women from 1947 through 1984. In men, the incidence has increased from 5.6 to 9.0 per 100,000 population and in women, from 0.5 to 1.5 per 100,000 population. We recently encountered three consecutive cases of laryngeal carcinoma in women at the Ben Taub General Hospital, Houston, Tex, diagnosed and treated over a 3-month period. Each woman had a long history of cigarette smoking, and two also had a history of alcohol abuse. These consecutive presentations of laryngeal carcinomas in women prompted us to examine our Cancer Registry Files from 1959 through 1973 and 1974 through 1988. Over these two 15-year periods, the male-to-female ratio declined from 5.6:1 to 4.5:1, reflecting a greater incidence among women. 
Mesenteric infarction secondary to tumor emboli from primary aortic sarcoma. Guidelines for diagnosis and management. Primary aortic tumors are rare, difficult to diagnose, and often fatal. This case and a review of the literature identified aortic tumors as a potential source of emboli leading to acute mesenteric insufficiency. The case showed the efficacy of magnetic resonance imaging in diagnosing and determining the extent and location of an aortic tumor. 
Interaction between dactinomycin and tumor necrosis factor in mesothelioma. Cachexia without oncolysis. There is no effective therapy for human malignant mesothelioma, and its susceptibility to recombinant cytokines has not been studied extensively. Recombinant human tumor necrosis factor alpha (rHuTNF alpha) was evaluated for its in vitro and in vivo antitumor activity using a human malignant mesothelioma cell line [DeH128(m)], both in culture and heterotransplanted in nude mice. In vitro, rHuTNF alone had no direct antimesothelioma activity assessed using the 3-[4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl]-2,5-diphenyl-tetrazolium bromide assay, but in combination with the transcription inhibitor, dactinomycin (AD), mesothelioma cell metabolic activity was inhibited (80% of control). The effects of this combination of agents were studied on DeH128(m) cells heterotransplanted as subcutaneous tumors in nude mice. In vivo there was no significant inhibition of tumor growth by combined rHuTNF alpha and AD therapy, but the combination produced marked cachexia in doses at which each component (rHuTNF alone or AD alone) was well tolerated. The authors conclude that the well-described in vitro interaction between AD and rHuTNF also operates in vivo to produce cachexia and that the combination of these two agents is likely to have a low therapeutic index in malignant mesothelioma. 
Induced bone development in transplants of fresh human pseudomalignant heterotopic ossification tissue in athymic nude mice. Biopsy specimens of mature trabecular bone from tumors of two typical cases of pseudomalignant heterotopic ossification (PHO; myositis ossificans circumscripta) were transplanted into athymic nude mice. Specimens of normal metaphyseal bone in adjacent areas were also transplanted in the contralateral hindquarter muscles for controls. By seven days, control bone transplants were necrotic and enveloped in granulation tissues whereas PHO transplants were surrounded by proliferating connective tissue derived from the host-bed muscle tissues. In the intervals from 14 and 21 days, the PHO transplants showed vascular and hypertrophied connective-tissue proliferation with appositional deposits of new bone. The microscopic features of the new bone suggested that it was of mouse host-bed origin because the new bone from Case 1, a female, showed nuclei without sex chromatin. The quantities of new bone were measured by correlated histomorphometric and computer image analysis of microradiographs. Little or no cartilage development was noted at any stage. The normal control trabecular bone tissue was slowly resorbed by macrophages and mononuclear phagocytes; multinucleated giant cells were few and relatively small. Except in one questionably small area of one transplant, nontumorous undemineralized normal human bone failed to induce bone formation within the 28-day period of observation. The quantity of new bone formed in athymic mice in response to implants of PHO, estimated from equivalent quantities of bone developed from implants of lyophilized matrix-free bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) was about 1 microgram/g of wet PHO tumor weight. Although circumstantial evidence implicates BMP in the pathogenesis of heterotopic ossification, more research should be directed toward regional and systemic factors inhibiting bone development in normal and abnormal conditions, including malignant bone tumors. 
Nonrandom distribution of N-myc oncogene genotypes in neuroblastoma. The distributions of Pvu II and Sph I alleles of the N-myc oncogene (also known as MYCN) were studied in a series of normal individuals and pediatric patients with solid tumors. In the case of Pvu II, where the polymorphic site is located 3' of the gene, the frequencies of the allele were 0.27 (11-kilobase fragment) and 0.73 (8-kilobase fragment) in 43 unrelated normal Caucasians. The frequencies of the allele were similar in 40 non-N-myc-amplified neuroblastomas, 47 Wilms' tumors, and 31 other pediatric tumors. In these cases, the genotypes were in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium. In 18 N-myc-amplified neuroblastomas, however, the observed genotype frequencies deviated from Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (P less than .005). Similar observations were made with an Sph I restriction fragment length polymorphism where the polymorphic site is located in intron 2. The differences between amplified and nonamplified neuroblastomas suggest a possible involvement of sequences at or near N-myc in the progression of tumors where the N-myc gene is amplified. 
Self-efficacy and outcome expectancies: relationship to chronic pain coping strategies and adjustment. Recent studies suggest that coping strategies play an important role in adjustment to chronic pain. Identification of factors that influence coping could potentially help clinicians facilitate the use of adaptive coping strategies by pain patients. According to social learning theory, self-efficacy beliefs (judgments regarding one's capabilities) and outcome expectancies (judgments regarding the consequences of behaviors) are significant determinants of coping behavior. This study tested hypotheses derived from social learning theory by examining the contributions of these beliefs to the prediction of coping behavior in chronic pain patients. One hundred and fourteen chronic pain patients completed measures of health-related dysfunction, pain severity, use of 8 coping strategies, and outcome and self-efficacy expectancies regarding these coping strategies. In support of social learning theory, and consistent with research in other areas, the patients' beliefs regarding their capabilities were strongly related to reported coping efforts. Beliefs about the consequences of coping efforts and their interaction with beliefs about capabilities were generally unrelated to coping. These results suggest that treatment should emphasize the actual practice and use of adaptive coping strategies over education about their outcome. 
Ebstein's anomaly appearing in the neonate. A new surgical approach. Ebstein's anomaly appearing during the neonatal period carries a high mortality rate. These infants exhibit cyanosis, acidosis, and congestive heart failure. The pathophysiologic characteristics consist of severe tricuspid regurgitation and functional pulmonary atresia. As a result of the inability of the right ventricle to generate forward flow through the pulmonary arteries, these infants remain dependent on ductal patency. Since May 1988, five newborn infants with severe Ebstein's anomaly have been admitted for treatment at our institution. At initial examination, they weighed 3.6 +/- 1.8 kg and had a mean oxygen tension of 29.6 +/- 2.3 mm Hg and a mean pH of 7.20 +/- 0.05. Chest roentgenography demonstrated a mean cardiothoracic ratio of 0.81 +/- 0.02. As determined by echocardiography, the right atria were massively enlarged, severe tricuspid regurgitation was present in all patients, and the pulmonary valves were not opening. All infants were dependent on prostaglandin E1 and attempts to wean them from this drug were unsuccessful. Palliative treatment consisted of tricuspid closure with autologous pericardium and an aortopulmonary shunt of 4 mm polytetrafluoroethylene tubing. There were no operative or late deaths. At discharge, mean oxygen tension was 42.2 +/- 0.85 mm Hg and mean systemic oxygen saturation was 83.2% +/- 1.94%. Infants have grown satisfactorily during the follow-up period. Three infants have since returned for further surgical intervention. One infant, at 11 months of age, underwent a Glenn anastomosis for progressive oxygen desaturation. Two infants have returned, at ages 23 and 22 months, for Fontan procedures, which represent their definitive operative management. We believe this new procedure offers excellent palliative treatment for Ebstein's anomaly in critically ill neonates. Feasibility of later definitive correction is demonstrated by the good results obtained with the Fontan procedure in two infants. 
Foscarnet in the treatment of cytomegalovirus infection of the esophagus and colon in patients with the acquired immune deficiency syndrome. Foscarnet, administered via a central line, was used for the treatment of 18 episodes of cytomegalovirus (CMV) esophageal ulceration in 15 patients, and in the treatment of 27 episodes of CMV colitis in 22 patients. In 15 of the 18 episodes of the esophageal disease, there was complete loss of symptoms within 2 wk. Only three of the 15 patients responding to foscarnet therapy had a relapse of their esophageal disease. Two of these patients were successfully retreated with foscarnet. Of the 22 patients receiving foscarnet for CMV colitis, four died during foscarnet therapy. Of the 18 patients completing the course of treatment with foscarnet for first-episode CMV colitis, 11 remitted completely and six had a partial remission. All patients with partial remission had a second pathogen responsible for the continuation of their diarrhea. Only one patient completing a course of foscarnet failed to respond microscopically to treatment. Three patients experienced relapse of their CMV colitis, two of whom responded to further courses of foscarnet. Foscarnet is an effective therapy for CMV disease of the gastrointestinal tract, with rapid resolution of clinical symptoms, long-term remission of esophageal disease, and shorter disease-free periods for CMV colitis. 
Delayed hearing loss after surgery for acoustic neurinomas: clinical and electrophysiological observations. In a series of 26 patients with medium-sized and large acoustic neurinomas and documented hearing before surgery, 7 patients had preservation of hearing initially after the procedure but then developed delayed hearing loss. The most prominent intraoperative electrophysiological finding in these cases was a gradual deterioration of brain stem auditory evoked potentials (BAEP), especially of Wave V. Four additional patients with a similar gradual intraoperative loss of BAEP and severe postoperative hearing deterioration received vasoactive treatment after surgery (low-molecular weight dextran). In all 4 patients, including 1 patient with documented total deafness after surgery, hearing was preserved. Initial preservation of cochlear nerve function after the removal of an acoustic neurinoma does not guarantee postoperative hearing. Intraoperative BAEP help to identify patients at risk for delayed postoperative hearing loss. The pathophysiological mechanism can be attributed to disturbances of the microcirculation in endoneurial vasa nervorum caused by the mechanical manipulation of the cochlear nerve. 
Poststenotic dilatation. Partial narrowing of arteries produces poststenotic dilatation. This appears as a dilation of the vessel wall 1 to 3 centimeters distal to the area of a partial stenosis. When a stenotic band is placed in dogs, poststenotic dilatation develops rapidly, often within eight to ten days. Moderate stenoses that produce a bruit and thrill are effective in eliciting poststenotic dilatation, whereas very tight and very mild stenoses usually are ineffective. Thus, development of poststenotic dilatation requires the presence of flow disturbances sufficient to produce an audible bruit and a palpable thrill. Although the exact flow disturbance is uncertain, statis, increased lateral pressure, cavitation, abnormal shear stresses and turbulence all have been postulated to be the cause of poststenotic dilatation. Of these, experimental studies support abnormal shear stresses and turbulence as the most likely causes. Whatever the flow disturbance, it must make the wall vibrate to produce poststenotic dilatation. Vibrations are thought to produce alterations in wall elastin and possibly in vascular smooth muscle tone. This leads to dilatation of the vessel. If the dilatation is slight, removal of the stenosis may cause reversal of poststenotic dilatation with recovery beginning within hours of correction of the stenosis. If the dilated area is enlarged to twice normal diameter, it may exhibit permanent aneurysmal changes and, therefore, requires resections with reanastomosis. Arteries that are dilated to as little as one-third more than normal size may contain areas of ulceration with overlying thrombus. These vessels also may require resection with reanastomosis. 
Relationship between glucose tolerance and quantitative changes of islet cells in chronic obstructive pancreatitis due to pancreatoduodenal cancer. This study was conducted to clarify the relationship between indicators of preoperative glucose tolerance and quantitative changes of endocrine cells in the islet of Langerhans in patients with chronic obstructive pancreatitis due to pancreatoduodenal cancer. Twenty-one specimens of pancreatic tissue obtained from patients who underwent pancreatoduodenectomy or total pancreatectomy for pancreatoduodenal cancer were divided into four groups according to the degree of fibrosis (Grades 0-III). Islet cells in serial sections were stained immunohistochemically to determine the proportions of B-, A-, D-, and PP-cells in the islets of Langerhans. In patients with pancreatic tissue with the most severe fibrosis, of several preoperative glucose metabolism indices measured, it was found that the ratio of integrated value of change in serum insulin to that of serum glucose (sigma delta IRI:sigma delta BS) was significantly decreased. There was a significant positive correlation between proportion of B-cells, and both the ratio of change in insulin to that of glucose (delta IRI:delta BS) and sigma delta IRI:sigma delta BS. On the other hand, there was a significant negative correlation between proportion of A-cells and sigma delta IRI:sigma delta BS. The present data strongly suggest that it is possible to estimate the degree of fibrosis and to quantify changes of the islet cells prior to surgery in patients with obstructive pancreatitis due to pancreatoduodenal cancer by calculating these glucose metabolism indices, and that sigma delta IRI:sigma delta BS is a particularly useful index. 
Cavoatrial tumor thrombectomy using cardiopulmonary bypass without circulatory arrest. Of 29 patients with inferior vena caval tumor thrombus, 14 with supradiaphragmatic extension were deemed suitable for operation. Patients (age, 7.5 to 70 years) had renal cell carcinoma (n = 8), Wilms' tumor (n = 2), transitional cell carcinoma (n = 1), and adrenal carcinoma (n = 3). Seven patients had stage III disease, and 7 patients had stage IV disease. Two patients (group A) had unresectable disease at exploratory celiotomy, 4 patients (group B) underwent tumor thrombectomy without cardiopulmonary bypass, and cardiopulmonary bypass was employed in 8 patients (group C). Three of 8 group C patients had Budd-Chiari syndrome at diagnosis. Cardiopulmonary bypass with moderate hypothermia, and inferior vena caval interruption (clip or filter), was employed in all patients. There were no perioperative deaths. Transient neurological impairment was observed postoperatively in 2 patients. Coagulopathy developed in 1 patient who had hepatic encephalopathy and Budd-Chiari syndrome preoperatively and in another patient in whom protamine could not be administered. No patient had acute renal failure requiring hemodialysis. Median survival is 41 and 17 months in groups B and C, respectively. Some authors have advocated profound hypothermia and circulatory arrest in these patients. We find that satisfactory visualization and excision can be performed with cardiopulmonary bypass and moderate hypothermia, avoiding potential renal, hepatic, neurological, and septic complications associated with circulatory arrest. 
Serum cholesterol concentration and coronary heart disease in population with low cholesterol concentrations. OBJECTIVE--To examine the relation between serum cholesterol concentration and mortality (from coronary heart disease and from other causes) below the range of cholesterol values generally seen in Western populations. DESIGN--Prospective observational study based on 8-13 years of follow up of subjects in a population with low cholesterol concentrations. SETTING--Urban Shanghai, China. SUBJECTS--9021 Chinese men and women aged 35-64 at baseline. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE--Death from coronary heart disease and other causes. RESULTS--The average serum cholesterol concentration was 4.2 mmol/l at baseline examination, and only 43 (7%) of the deaths that occurred during 8-13 years of follow up were attributed to coronary heart disease. There was a strongly positive, and apparently independent, relation between serum cholesterol concentration and death from coronary heart disease (z = 3.47, p less than 0.001), and within the range of usual serum cholesterol concentration studied (3.8-4.7 mmol/l) there was no evidence of any threshold. After appropriate adjustment for the regression dilution bias, a 4 (SD 1)% difference in usual cholesterol concentration was associated with a 21 (SD 6)% (95% confidence interval 9% to 35%) difference in mortality from coronary heart disease. There was no significant relation between serum cholesterol concentration and death from stroke or all types of cancer. The 79 deaths due to liver cancer or other chronic liver disease were inversely related to cholesterol concentration at baseline. CONCLUSION--Blood cholesterol concentration was directly related to mortality from coronary heart disease even in those with what was, by Western standards, a "low" cholesterol concentration. There was no good evidence of an adverse effect of cholesterol on other causes of death. 
Enucleation after plaque radiotherapy for posterior uveal melanoma. Histopathologic findings. A review of 1019 patients with posterior uveal melanomas, who were treated with episcleral plaque radiotherapy between April 1976 and December 1987, showed that 59 (6%) of these patients have thus far required enucleation of the affected eye. The most common clinical reasons for enucleation were tumor regrowth (51%) and neovascular glaucoma (31%). These irradiated melanomas were of mixed cell type in 40 cases (68%), spindle in 10 cases (17%), totally necrotic in 7 cases (12%), and epithelioid in 2 cases (3%). Some degree of tumor necrosis was seen in all cases. Overall, the median number of mitoses per 40 high-power fields in these irradiated tumors was 0. Most (64%) of the tumors had no identifiable mitosis in 40 high-power fields. A three-way simultaneous comparison of the following groups was made: irradiated eyes enucleated for tumor regrowth, irradiated eyes enucleated for neovascular glaucoma, and a matched group of nonirradiated posterior uveal melanomas. This comparison showed that the largest tumor dimension was significantly greater in the irradiated eyes enucleated for tumor regrowth than in the other two groups. Mitotic activity was significantly higher in the irradiated tumor regrowth and nonirradiated groups than in the irradiated neovascular group. There was no significant difference among the three groups in an analysis of height. The results suggested that mitotic activity may exist after plaque radiotherapy, especially when there is clinical evidence of tumor regrowth. 
Thromboembolism in patients with advanced mitral valve prolapse Thromboembolism in mitral valve prolapse (MVP) has been suggested to occur in relation to valvular cul-de-sac recesses and endothelial wear-and-tear denudations. Such pathology would be suspected to be prominent in advanced cases of MVP necessitating open-heart operation. We therefore analysed the prevalence of perivalvular thrombi and episodes of systemic arterial embolism (SE) prior to operation in 21 consecutive patients with MVP and severe valve regurgitation. No perivalvular or left atrial thrombi were found during open-heart surgery, but three of the patients (14%, 3-36% with 95% confidence limits) experienced SE, in one case despite long-term anticoagulation. All cases of SE took place less than 3 months before operation. The results indicate that persistent thrombi are rare in MVP and severe valve regurgitation. However, such patients run a substantial risk of SE when they reach a clinical and haemodynamic stage that makes valve surgery mandatory. 
A mathematical computer stimulation model for the development of colonic polyps and colon cancer. Currently known information about the development and progression of colon polyps and cancer is summarized and organized into a mathematical computer simulation model that successfully predicts the natural history of colon polyp and cancer development for an average patient with (1) familial polyposis coli (2) genetic susceptibility as measured by a positive family history, and (3) negative family history with a high fat diet. The mathematical model uses four distinct types of cells (normal, transformed, polypoid, and cancerous) and two kinetic processes (mutation and promotion). Arachidonic acid metabolites play a role in the model in the promotion of cancer from polyps, and account for that promotion through: (1) their effect on encouraging more polypoid cells in mitosis to move toward cancer; and (2) their immunosuppressive effect over time. The model also shows that one defect in allowing more cells to mutate to the transformed state is sufficient to account for the chain of events leading to the clinical sequelae of familial polyposis coli. A second genetic effect at another point in the process is unnecessary. The mechanism of action of Sulindac on colon polyps is explained by the model through inhibition of production of arachidonic acid metabolites, most notably prostaglandin E. 
Sepsis. What it is and how to recognize it. Sepsis, shock, and resuscitation may result in various degrees of ischemia-perfusion injury that may produce widespread organ dysfunction through complex interactions and activation of host immunoinflammatory processes. As the pathophysiologic mechanisms of the inflammatory response are better defined, we may be able to modulate the generalized inflammatory state we know as sepsis and prevent the development of multiple organ failure syndrome. At present, however, the mainstay of therapy remains prompt resuscitation to eliminate regions of hypoperfusion and to limit as much as possible those factors that predispose to further organ injury while the source of inflammatory stimulation is being identified and controlled. 
Membrane cerebral lipids in Rett syndrome. The lipid membrane composition of cerebral tissue from 5 patients with classic Rett syndrome, ages 12-30 years, and from 14 age-matched controls was studied. The results demonstrated a selective loss of myelin-associated lipids and an enrichment of gangliosides in temporal white matter. The ganglioside pattern revealed an increase of astroglial cell-associated gangliosides and reduced proportions of gangliosides GD1a and GT1b. This latter finding may be crucial in synaptic function. The fatty acid compositions of ethanolamine phosphoglyceride, choline phosphoglyceride, and galactosylceramide were normal. 
Thyroid adenocarcinomas secondary to tissue-specific expression of simian virus-40 large T-antigen in transgenic mice. A hybrid gene comprising the bovine thyroglobulin gene promoter and the coding region for the simian virus-40 large T- and small t-antigens was used to generate 30 transgenic mice by microinjection into the pronuclei of single cell embryos. All animals except three developed, as single primitive pathology, a dramatic enlargement of the thyroid gland. Compression of trachea and esophagus, accompanied by dyspnea, inspiratory stridor, and dysphagia, led to a progressive cachexia and premature death attributed to respiratory failure. Despite the large thyroid volume, T4 levels were abnormally low, and the progression of the syndrome could be delayed by a substitutive treatment with thyroid hormones. The rapid evolution of the disease, leading to the death of most founder transgenic animals before the breeding age, prevented transmission of the transgene to their offspring. Only two transgenic lines are presently surviving. Immunohistochemical analysis of the tissues revealed a specific expression of the simian virus-40 antigens in the thyroid cells. Hyperplasia was already obvious at birth. Older animals displayed moderately to poorly differentiated thyroid adenocarcinomas. Electron microscopy revealed, however, the persistence of cell polarity and the presence of microfollicles between the densely packed cells. Cell lines derived from these large T-expressing thyroids were shown to have lost expression of both thyroglobulin and thyroperoxidase, while expressing low levels of TSH receptors. These transgenic mice could constitute an interesting model of aggressive adenocarcinoma, sharing phenotypical similarities with the anaplastic type of human thyroid tumors. 
A phase I trial of high-dose diaziquone and autologous bone marrow transplantation: an Illinois Cancer Council study. Diaziquone (AZQ), a synthetic quinone with demonstrated activity against acute nonlymphocytic leukemia (ANLL), primary CNS tumors, and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL), is virtually devoid of nonhematopoietic toxicity at conventional doses. As a prelude to its inclusion into bone marrow transplant (BMT) preparative regimens, a phase I study of high-dose AZQ with autologous BMT (ABMT) was performed. Patients with refractory solid tumors and lymphomas were treated with a single 24-hour infusion of AZQ at 50 to 355 mg/m2 in dose escalations of 20%. Fifty-six patients received 69 courses. Those receiving greater than 60 mg/m2 had nadir granulocyte and platelet counts less than 500/microL and 20,000/microL, respectively. Nausea, vomiting, stomatitis, and diarrhea were mild, transient, and not dose-related. Transient minimal elevations of liver function tests were seen in five patients and were also not dose-related. The maximally tolerated dose (MTD) of high-dose AZQ was found to be 245 mg/m2, with nephrotoxicity being dose-limiting. Significant azotemia was seen in four of 12 patients treated at 295 and 355 mg/m2, including fatal anuric renal failure in three of these patients. Reversible proteinuria also occurred in 24 of 26 courses above 150 mg/m2, including nephrotic range proteinuria in eight courses, all at doses of 205 to 355 mg/m2. The proteinuria was also associated with multiple proximal tubular defects including generalized aminoaciduria and proximal renal tubular acidosis. There were six early deaths including two of early renal failure (295 and 355 mg/m2), two of sepsis (205 and 245 mg/m2), one of a pulmonary embolus (85 mg/m2), and one of progressive disease (60 mg/m2). Of 50 patients who were assessable for response, there were seven responses including two of 10 with primary CNS tumors, one of 12 with malignant melanoma, one of five with non-small-cell lung carcinoma, two of two with breast carcinoma, and one of one with ovarian carcinoma. Because of its activity in ANLL and NHL and its unique toxicity spectrum, high-dose AZQ may improve the efficacy of current BMT preparative regimens without significantly increasing their nonhematopoietic toxicity. 
Use of purified streptokinase in empyema and hemothorax. Enzymatic debridement of the pleural cavity for retained hemothorax or empyema is a frequently overlooked option. Thirteen of fourteen patients (93%) with retained pleural collections underwent successful enzymatic debridement and tube drainage with purified streptokinase injections. The average increase in chest tube output following streptokinase injections was 158%. No significant adverse reactions occurred. One patient required thoracotomy when streptokinase therapy failed. Two others had successful resolution of their pleural collections but required thoracotomy for other indications. There were two deaths (14%), which were unrelated to the use of streptokinase or residual empyema. Intrapleural streptokinase is a safe, effective means of removing retained proteinaceous collections in the pleural space. It is a useful adjunct to chest tube drainage and may obviate the need for more invasive procedures. 
Sexual function and testosterone levels in men with nonalcoholic liver disease. The effects of nonalcoholic liver disease on sexual desire, arousal, activity, orgasmic function and satisfaction and serum testosterone levels were studied in 75 men with nonalcoholic liver disease. Each man was interviewed about his sexual behavior and problems and was asked to comment on whether he felt liver disease affected his sexual function. The average age of the patients was 49 yr, and a wide variety of liver diseases was represented. Child-Pugh grading was A in 51 patients, B in 18 and C in 6; the mean duration of liver disease was 8 yr. Sexual desire, arousal and activity of patients with grade A disease were within the ranges observed in studies of healthy men of comparable age. Diminished sexual desire was reported by 2% of grade A patients and 35% of grade B and C patients (p less than 0.005). Arousal problems were noted by 16% of grade A patients, 60% of grade B patients and 67% of C patients (p less than 0.005). Loss of erection and inability to regain erection were noted by 7%, 40% and 67% of grade A, B and C patients, respectively (p less than 0.01). Premature and retarded ejaculation were more frequent in patients classed in Child-Pugh grades B and C. Frequency of coitus and orgasm were significantly higher in grade A patients than in grade B and C patients. Total and free testosterone levels were (in nanograms per milliliter) A, 677/1.78; B, 416/1.06; and C, 178/0.43 (p less than 0.002). We concluded that Child-Pugh grade A nonalcoholic liver disease in men does not affect sexual desire, function or performance. Men with disease grades B and C have significant sexual dysfunction and significant reduction of both total and free testosterone levels. 
Lymphography--current role in oncology. A review of the use of lymphography at this hospital, a major oncology centre, is presented. The advent of computed tomography has brought a dramatic reduction in the number of lymphograms currently performed for diseases such as lymphoma, testicular tumours and gynaecological malignancies. This study analyses the reasons for this decline, and concludes that valuable information can still be obtained from lymphography in certain selected groups of patients. 
CT of the pancreas in children. CT has become a frequently used imaging method for evaluating suspected pancreatic disease in children. Although the spectrum of CT findings in pancreatic disease is well documented in adults, there is a paucity of such information in children. Familiarity with CT patterns of pancreatic disease in childhood is important for diagnosis. In this essay, we illustrate the CT findings of pancreatic lesions in children. 
Spontaneous hepatic copper accumulation in Long-Evans Cinnamon rats with hereditary hepatitis. A model of Wilson's disease. Long-Evans Cinnamon (LEC) rats, an inbred strain of a mutant rat isolated from Long-Evans rats, develop hereditary hepatitis. To elucidate the role of copper metabolism in the development of the hepatitis in LEC rats, we examined the copper concentration in the tissues and serum levels of copper and ceruloplasmin. Copper concentration in the liver of LEC rats was over 40 times that of normal Long-Evans Agouti (LEA) rats, while the serum ceruloplasmin and copper concentrations in LEC rats decreased significantly. The hepatocytes of LEC rats show steatosis in cytoplasm and pleomorphism of mitochondria, resembling the histologic features of the liver in Wilson's disease. These findings suggest that the hereditary hepatitis in LEC rats is closely associated with copper toxicity, and may be dealing with a rat form of Wilson's disease. Thus the LEC rats will provide a unique and useful animal model for clarifying the mechanism and for developing treatment strategies for Wilson's disease and other abnormal copper metabolism in humans. 
Comparison of continuous epidural bupivacaine infusion plus either continuous epidural infusion or patient-controlled epidural injection of fentanyl for postoperative analgesia. We compared the postoperative epidural analgesia provided by the continuous epidural infusion of bupivacaine supplemented with patient-controlled injection (PCA) of epidural fentanyl with that provided by a continuous infusion of bupivacaine supplemented with a continuous epidural infusion of fentanyl. Our patient population comprised 16 ASA physical status I or II patients undergoing laparotomy with a midline incision under general anesthesia combined with bupivacaine epidural analgesia. Post-operatively, a continuous epidural infusion of bupivacaine (0.1 mg.kg-1.h-1) was combined with epidural fentanyl given by either (a) PCA (15-micrograms bolus with a lockout interval of 12 min, n = 8) or (b) continuous infusion (1 microgram.kg-1.h-1, n = 8). In the case of inadequate pain relief in the latter group, the fentanyl infusion rate was increased by 10 micrograms/h. Analgesia evaluated by a visual analogue pain score and by a verbal pain score was similarly effective in both groups. The sedation score was also similar in both groups. The total dose of epidural fentanyl administered during the first 24 h was significantly lower in the PCA group than in the continuous infusion group (405 +/- 110 micrograms vs 1600 +/- 245 micrograms, P less than 0.001). The dose of fentanyl given during each 4-h interval ranged between 40 and 160 micrograms in the PCA group and 251 and 292 micrograms in the continuous infusion group. Clinically detectable respiratory depression was not observed in either group. In conclusion, epidural administration of 0.1 mg.kg-1.h-1 bupivacaine combined with fentanyl provides effective postoperative analgesia with a total dose of fentanyl required that is lower when fentanyl is administered by epidural PCA rather than by continuous epidural infusion. 
Staging relationships and outcome in early stage testicular cancer: a report from the Testicular Cancer Intergroup Study. The Testicular Cancer Center Intergroup Study entered surgically staged patients with nonseminomatous tumor and metastases limited to the regional lymph nodes into a previously reported cooperative trial of immediate versus delayed therapy for positive retroperitoneal node disease. Patients with negative nodes (stage I) were placed in an observation registry with specified treatment strategy upon relapse. Of 264 stage I cancer patients 27 (10.2%) had recurrence: 5 of these 27 patients died after recurrence of the testicular malignancies, while 4 other nontumor-related deaths have occurred. Pre-lymphadenectomy staging characteristics observed to predict significantly node positivity are the results of radiological examinations, presence of tumor invasion, vascular invasion and tumor histology. In a multiple logistic regression analysis with these variables, misclassification still occurs in more than a fourth of the patients. Future refinements in diagnosis may allow for better prediction of these patients at risk to have positive lymph nodes and ultimately recurrence. Presently, if assessment of nodal involvement is the objective, noninvasive procedures are not an adequate substitute for surgical staging with modified lymphadenectomy. 
The detection of hepatitis B virus (HBV) in HBsAG negative individuals with primary liver cancer. The importance of chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection in the development of primary liver cancer has been established by epidemiological studies. However, the evidence for a direct role of the virus in liver carcinogenesis is still tentative. In addition, the findings of HBV DNA sequences in HBsAg-negative subjects with liver cancer has been reported, although it is controversial. Here we report the use of the polymerase chain reaction to detect HBV DNA in the serum and liver of HBsAg-negative patients. This technique allows both for the detection and cloning of HBV variants. In addition, the demonstration of HBV DNA and RNA molecules in HCC of HBsAg-negative individuals as determined by standard techniques reinforces the role of HBV in the pathogenesis of this tumor. 
Results of fundoplication in a UK paediatric centre. Of 55 children (age 3 months to 16 years) who had fundoplication, major complications occurred in nine (16 per cent): paraoesophageal hernia (five cases), prolonged ileus (two cases), recurrent gastro-oesophageal reflux (one case), and accidental perforation (one case). The single most important factor resulting in complications was the omission of crural repair; of seven patients without crural repair, five developed paraoesophageal hernia/recurrence. Four patients required repeat fundoplication for severe recurrent symptoms and one of these developed the unusual complication of pericardiogastric fistula. Thirteen patients had strictures before operation from reflux oesophagitis, six (46 per cent) resolved after fundoplication alone, six responded to dilatation (mean five sessions), and one required colon interposition. Our preliminary experience with balloon dilatation was encouraging: three of three patients responded after one dilatation only. These results confirmed the efficacy of surgery in controlling reflux: 100 per cent in the short-term and 89 per cent on a 1-6 year follow-up. Major complications might well be reduced by routine crural repair. 
Prevention of postoperative nausea and vomiting using ondansetron, a new, selective, 5-HT3 receptor antagonist. The effect of ondansetron, a 5-HT3 antagonist, in preventing postoperative nausea and vomiting was investigated in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study of 84 patients undergoing gynecologic operation and receiving the same general anesthetic. The patients received premedication with either 16 mg oral ondansetron, or a matching placebo. The same medication was given postoperatively 8 h after the first dose. During the first hour after recovery from anesthesia, the frequencies of nausea and vomiting were 52% and 40%, respectively, in patients given placebos. In the ondansetron group nausea and vomiting developed in 17% and 12%, respectively, values significantly different from those with placebos (P less than 0.005). Similar differences were observed throughout the entire 24-h period after recovery, the incidence of nausea and vomiting being 67% and 60%, respectively, in the placebo group and 29% and 26% in the ondansetron treatment group. Ondansetron appears to be a promising antiemetic for the prevention of postoperative nausea and vomiting. 
Method for auditing turnround time in histopathology related to user requirements. Histopathology audit schemes have concentrated on the accuracy of diagnosis or the standard of technical work. The most appropriate measure of specimen report time for histopathology was assessed. The simplest method is to calculate the mean or median number of days from receipt of specimens to issue of report, but this takes no account of clinical practice. An alternative approach is to compare the laboratory's performance with the clinicians' requirements. Clinicians were invited to complete a questionnaire specifying the reporting times they required subdivided by tissue type, clinical suspicion of malignancy, and bed occupancy of the patient. The questionnaire showed that there were distinct differences in clinicians' requirements. The turnround time for each category of specimen was calculated and expressed in three ways. The traditional method of quoting a median value showed very few differences among the categories. A comparison of the department's performance with the clinicians' requirements, using an arbitrary cut-off point of satisfying at least 80% of the clinicians' most stringent requirements or an achievement index, however, provided useful information for refining laboratory priorities. 
Histological grading of squamous cell carcinoma of the penis: a new scoring system. A system of histological grading based on retrospective analysis of 239 patients with squamous cell carcinoma of the penis is presented. A new scoring system with 4 histological grades was used. The results of this study confirm previous reports that penile cancer is usually a highly (50%) or moderately (29%) differentiated squamous cell carcinoma. Poorly differentiated carcinomas and cancers of other types are very rare. The new grading system was found to be practical and a correlation between histological grade, clinical findings and prognosis was established. Patients with grade 1 tumours had an exceptionally favourable prognosis, with more than 80% being long-term survivors; for these patients, treatment with delayed side effects should be avoided and new forms of treatment should be explored. 
Incidence and treatment of rejection episodes in primary orthotopic liver transplantation under FK 506. FK 506 therapy with low doses of steroids was adequate to control rejection in most liver recipients. Rejection episodes were readily reversed with single IV doses of methylprednisone or hydrocortisone. Short courses of OKT3 (3 to 5 days 5-10 mL) controlled severe rejections. The rate of retransplantation directly due to rejection was low (1.6%). There was a limited need for steroids either early or out to 6 to 12 months. 
Evaluating genetic association among ovarian, breast, and endometrial cancer: evidence for a breast/ovarian cancer relationship. The possibility of a genetic relationship between ovarian, breast, and endometrial cancer was investigated in data from a large multicenter, population-based, case-control study, the Cancer and Steroid Hormone Study conducted by the Centers for Disease Control (CDC). Age-adjusted relative risks (RRs) for mothers and sisters of 493 ovarian cancer cases, 895 breast cancer cases, and 143 endometrial cancer cases versus 4,754 controls were calculated. Significantly elevated age-adjusted RRs were found for ovarian cancer (RR = 2.8; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.6-4.9) and breast cancer (RR = 1.6; 95% CI = 1.1-2.1) among relatives of ovarian cancer probands and for breast cancer (RR = 2.1; 95% CI = 1.7-2.5) and ovarian cancer (RR = 1.7; 95% CI = 1.0-2.0) among relatives of breast cancer probands. Relatives of endometrial cancer probands had an elevated RR for endometrial cancer only (RR = 2.7; 95% CI = 1.6-4.8). The genetic relationship between ovarian, breast, and endometrial cancer was tested using a multivariate polygenic threshold model developed by Smith (1976), which was modified to accommodate three classes of probands. Estimates of heritability for ovarian, breast, and endometrial cancer were 40%, 56%, and 52%, respectively. There was a significant genetic correlation between ovarian and breast cancer (R12 = .484). Evidence for significant genetic overlap between endometrial cancer and either ovarian or breast cancer was not found. These results suggest the existence of a familial breast/ovarian cancer syndrome. Endometrial cancer, while heritable, appears to be genetically unrelated. 
Concomitant whole-abdominal radiation and intraperitoneal chemotherapy in advanced ovarian carcinoma. A pilot study. Because the use of cisplatin-based chemotherapy for ovarian carcinoma has not significantly improved 5-year survival rates compared with either whole-abdominal radiation (WAR) or single-agent chemotherapy, a pilot study was begun to assess the feasibility of concomitant radiation and chemotherapy. Eleven previously untreated patients with Stages III and IV ovarian carcinoma were treated concomitantly with 2000 cGy of WAR and intraperitoneal (IP) cisplatin followed by additional IP cisplatin after debulking surgery. Toxicity was moderate to severe. Sixty-four percent of patients had Grades 3 to 4 hematologic toxicity, and 36% required hospitalization for sepsis during WAR/IP cisplatin. Hematologic toxicity was less pronounced during IP cisplatin alone. All patients experienced moderate gastrointestinal toxicity. The average percentage of total body weight lost was 13.5%. Fifty-five percent of all patients demonstrated a complete clinical response to therapy, and patients with minimal postoperative residual disease fared better. One patient with persistent disease had acute nonlymphocytic leukemia (ANLL) 24 months after initial diagnosis. No patients with residual disease greater than 20 mm survived, while 50% of patients with less than 20 mm are clinically free of disease. Toxicity appears to be additive with the combination of WAR and IP cisplatin. Therapeutic efficacy was comparable with standard chemotherapy regimens, but no therapeutic or survival advantages were demonstrated with the use of this treatment protocol. 
Chagas' heart disease in the United States. BACKGROUND AND METHODS. Chagas' heart disease is believed to be rare in the United States, although many persons from countries where the disease is endemic reside here. We performed a retrospective case review and prospective follow-up of 25 patients with Chagas' heart disease and no obstructive coronary artery disease on angiography. RESULTS. The patients mainly presented with symptomatic atrioventricular block, congestive heart failure, anginal chest pain, sudden death averted by resuscitation, or sustained ventricular tachycardia. Of the 25 patients, 18 had been treated for coronary artery disease or idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy for up to 108 months before the diagnosis of Chagas' disease was considered. The electrocardiograms frequently suggested coronary artery disease. Six of the seven patients who had exercise thallium-perfusion scans had abnormalities suggesting ischemia or infarction. A left ventricular aneurysm was found in 14 of the 25 patients, segmental akinesia or hypokinesia in 5, and diffuse hypokinesia in 3. Programmed ventricular stimulation performed in 13 patients induced sustained ventricular tachycardia in 9 and nonsustained ventricular tachycardia in 2. Actuarial survival (mean +/- SE) after four years for the entire group was 56 +/- 12 percent; it was 32 +/- 16 percent among those with global left ventricular dysfunction, and 78 +/- 14 percent among those without such dysfunction (P = 0.03). Only patients with left ventricular dysfunction or an aneurysm died (four-year survival, 45 +/- 14 percent, as compared with 100 percent for the remaining patients; P = 0.0002). Heart failure and left ventricular aneurysm or dysfunction were the only independent predictors of death. Nine patients required permanent pacemakers. CONCLUSIONS. In the United States, Chagas' heart disease commonly mimics coronary artery disease or idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy. The prognosis is poor for patients with heart failure or left ventricular aneurysm or dysfunction. The disease may be underdiagnosed in the United States. 
Effect of thrombolysis on the evolution of late potentials within 10 days of infarction. Patients with late potentials in the signal averaged electrocardiogram are more at risk of lethal arrhythmias in the period after acute myocardial infarction. To test the effects of thrombolysis on the incidence and evolution of late potentials, 158 consecutive patients were prospectively studied during the first 10 days after acute myocardial infarction. The study population consisted of two groups: 93 control patients treated conservatively and 65 patients treated with intravenous thrombolysis. Recordings of signal averaged electrocardiogram were obtained within two days and 7-10 days after infarction. The incidence of late potentials in the first two days after infarction was not significantly different in the thrombolytic and control groups (14% v 11.8%). By 7-10 days the incidence of late potentials among patients who underwent thrombolysis remained unchanged (14%); however, it increased significantly in the control group (11.8% to 22.5%). Thus thrombolysis seems to reduce the evolution of late potentials within 10 days of infarction. Because the risk of fatal arrhythmias is higher in patients with late potentials this study may partly explain the reduced mortality after thrombolysis. 
The persistence of symptoms in patients with globus pharyngis. A follow-up study of 104 patients with globus sensation was performed by postal questionnaire. All were asked to complete the Eysenck Personality Questionnaire (EPQ) and a 12-item Throat Symptom Questionnaire. Seventy-two of these patients were sent a follow-up General Health Questionnaire (GHQ). Replies were received from 89 patients (86%), 68 females and 21 males, a mean of 31 months after initial presentation. The feeling of something stuck in the throat had disappeared completely in 27% of patients, but only 4% were never aware of the throat. Throat symptoms showed a reduction with increasing age, but not with increasing interval since presentation. The 15 patients initially treated with antacid therapy had significantly greater dyspepsia scores at review than untreated patients, but no other difference was found between the two groups. GHQ scores showed a small but significant reduction over time. Of EPQ parameters, only the lower lie score in female patients showed any significant difference on repeat testing. Those with persistently high throat scores had significantly lower EPQ lie scores and a trend towards higher GHQ scores at follow-up. None of the psychological parameters measured at the first interview was found to be of prognostic significance. We conclude that, although there is a reduction in occult psychiatric morbidity in patients with the globus sensation over time, underlying personality traits remain stable and that there is a remarkable persistence of pharyngeal symptoms. 
Risks associated with an elevated maternal serum alpha-fetoprotein level. Among 58,187 women tested, 1002 had a maternal serum alpha-fetoprotein measuring greater than or equal to 2.5 multiples of the median after correction for race, weight, and insulin-dependent diabetes. They were stratified into three groups: group 1, 2.5 to 2.9; group 2, 3.0 to 5.0; group 3, greater than or equal to 5.0 multiples of the median. The initial risk of a serious abnormality detected by ultrasonography or amniocentesis was 17% (5%, 12% and 65% in groups 1, 2, and 3, respectively). After correction for twins and dates, this risk became 23% (7%, 18%, and 71% in groups, 1, 2, and 3, respectively). Among the women with high maternal serum alpha-fetoprotein levels, 556 (77%) had normal ultrasonographic and amniocentesis studies, and the risk of adverse pregnancy outcome ws 27% (19%, 29%, and 70% in groups 1, 2, and 3, respectively). There was a statistically significant increase in late fetal and perinatal death, prematurity and growth retardation, oligohydramnios, abruptio placentae, preeclampsia, and congenital abnormalities. The overall risk for abnormality or adverse outcome was 24% in group 1, 41% in group 2, and 91% in group 3. 
Epidemiologic correlates of sporadic amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. We evaluated 74 selected patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and 201 matched controls for risk factors for ALS by a case-control design and a sequential questionnaire/interview technique to quantitate biographic data. We analyzed occupational and recreational data only for 47 male patients and 47 corresponding patient controls; data for women were insufficient. We used nonparametric analyses to evaluate five primary comparisons of ALS patients with controls: (1) more hard physical labor, p not significant (NS); (2) greater frequency of neurodegenerative disease in family members, p NS; (3) greater exposure to lead, p less than 0.05; (4) more years lived in a rural community, p NS; and (5) more trauma or major surgery, p NS. Men with ALS had worked more frequently at blue-collar jobs (although not a statistically significant difference, p = 0.10) and at welding or soldering (p less than 0.01). These results suggest that there may be an association between ALS in men and exposure to lead vapor. The limited nature of the association favors a multifactorial etiologic mechanism of ALS. 
Catechol metabolites in the cerebrospinal fluid as possible markers in the early diagnosis of Parkinson's disease. This paper is a preliminary report of work aiming to elucidate the possible use of 5-S-cysteinyl metabolites of catechols in the cerebrospinal fluid as markers in the early diagnosis of Parkinson's disease (PD). The rationale for this approach is the hypothesis that this disorder is caused by a failure of antioxidative mechanisms to prevent the excessive autoxidation of dopamine and other catechols that yields highly reactive and cytotoxic semiquinones and quinones. 5-S-cysteinyl adducts of these quinones have been detected in human brains, analyzed postmortem, and appear to be formed at an increased rate in elderly individuals, who show an increased loss of dopaminergic neurons. 
Shortlasting, unilateral, neuralgiform headache attacks with conjunctival injection, tearing, and subclinical forehead sweating ("Sunct" syndrome): II. Changes in heart rate and arterial blood pressure during pain paroxysms. The recently described "Sunct" syndrome is a rare picture of unilateral, shortlasting headache attacks accompanied by autonomic phenomena (conjunctival injection, tearing, etc.) on the symptomatic side. Heart rate and blood pressure were monitored in two elderly "Sunct" patients during and outside headache attacks. An ultrasound Doppler servo method was used for the non-invasive, continuous, beat-to-beat determination of instantaneous arterial blood pressure. In a third patient, systolic and diastolic blood pressure, both outside and during pain paroxysms, were assessed using the standard Korotkoff method. Heart rate was found to be significantly decreased during pain paroxysms. Systolic blood pressure was observed to be significantly increased during attacks, when compared with the inter-attack period, while a less consistent pattern was observed for diastolic blood pressure. Some of the changes in the cardiovascular system seemed to start prior to pain onset. Therefore, it seems unlikely that these changes were caused by pain activation of the sympathetic nervous system or the oculocardiac reflex. 
Dementia presenting with aphasia: clinical characteristics. Dementia, a disorder of multiple cognitive functions, may atypically present as an aphasia. The clinical characteristics are reported of 13 patients with up to 14 years of progressive language impairment before developing dementia. In reviewing the literature, it was found that these patients were similar to those reported with progressive aphasia. It is concluded that dementia may present with an anomic, dysfluent language disorder due to the focal left sylvian onset of several dementing illnesses. 
Hypertrophy of nodules of Arantius and aortic insufficiency: pathophysiology and repair. Aortic insufficiency (AI) due to fibrosis and thickening of the nodules of Arantius in the otherwise normal aortic valve was found in 11 adults (age range, 41 to 65 years) between 1976 and 1988. Nine had concomitant mitral stenosis; 2 had coronary artery disease. In 6 patients AI was graded 3+ or greater; in 5 it was less than 3+. Correction of AI and restoration of cuspid flexibility and apposition by shaving the hypertrophied nodules was accomplished in all, with postrepair AI graded as 1+ or less. There was one hospital death, a patient who had prior mitral operation. Mean follow-up was 68 +/- 56 months. Only 1 patient had late (6 years) recurrent serious (3+) AI. Nine continued to have 1+ or less AI, based on echocardiography or catheterization (n = 6) or on physical examination performed at a mean of 74 months. We conclude that thickening of the nodules of Arantius may cause AI. Long-term correction can be accomplished by sculpturing of the involved cusps. 
Seasonal variations in fibrinogen concentrations among elderly people. Mortality and morbidity in elderly people are higher in winter than in summer months, with seasonal variations in rates of both fatal and non-fatal myocardial infarction and stroke. To identify factors that might contribute to the excess winter frequency of cardiovascular disease in the elderly, we studied 100 subjects aged 75 and over who lived in either their own homes or in sheltered or residential accommodation. Each person was visited each month for one year, body and environmental temperatures were noted, and cardiovascular risk factors were measured. 32 subjects withdrew from the study. Significant seasonal effects were found for fibrinogen, plasma viscosity, and HDL cholesterol (p less than 0.003, Bonferroni adjustment). Plasma fibrinogen concentrations showed the greatest seasonal change and were 23% higher in the coldest six months compared with summer months. Fibrinogen was significantly (p less than 0.05) and negatively related to core body temperature and all measures of environmental temperature. Those living in institutions had greater changes in plasma fibrinogen than those living in the community. The seasonal variation in plasma fibrinogen concentration is large enough to increase the risk of both myocardial infarction and stroke in winter. 
Role of neurohumoral systems for pressure induced left ventricular hypertrophy in experimental supravalvular aortic stenosis in rats. We studied the role of the sympathetic nervous system and the renin angiotensin system for pressure induced left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) in 135 rats with experimental supravalvular aortic stenosis (AS). We induced this condition by a silver clip on the ascending aorta, when body weight (BW) was 90 to 100 g. Sympathectomy by 6-OH-dopamine reduced LV norepinephrine content to less than 5%. The renin-angiotensin system was blocked by quinapril, which reduced serum angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) activity to less than 5%. Aortic stenosis (LV peak systolic pressure 212 +/- 10 mm Hg) induced significant LVH with an increase of LV weight from 198 +/- 3 (sham) to 266 +/- 6 after 6 weeks and to 303 +/- 13 mg/100 g body weight after 12 weeks. Sympathectomy did not reduce LVH 6 weeks after induction of AS (260 +/- 6 mg/100 g body weight). Angiotensin converting enzyme inhibition initiated immediately after induction of AS did not alter the increase of LV mass after 6 weeks (250 +/- 7 mg/100 g body weight). Removing the silver clip 6 weeks after induction of AS resulted in a 90% regression of LVH after 6 more weeks. When ACE-inhibition was started after 6 weeks--ie, once LVH had developed--and maintained for another 6 weeks, an 80% regression of LVH was observed despite the persistent afterload elevation. Our findings of an afterload independent regression of LVH by ACE-inhibition emphasize an important role of the renin angiotensin system for the maintenance of pressure induced LVH. 
Acute non-A, non-B hepatitis in a hospital population in Warsaw, Poland: clinical and epidemiological aspects. In the years 1986-1988, 530 consecutive cases of acute viral hepatitis were admitted to an infectious disease hospital in Warsaw. Hepatitis A was diagnosed in 34 cases (6.4%), hepatitis B in 436 (82.3%), CMV infection in five (0.9%), and 55 cases (10.4%) were classified as hepatitis non-A, non-B. In 47 cases (85%) of non-A, non-B hepatitis, there was evidence of parenteral transmission, whereas in eight (15%), the source of infection was unknown. Chronic liver disease developed in 50% of patients with parenteral exposure, but there were no cases with known exposure. Seroconversion to anti-HCV was observed only in patients with parenteral exposure, and 60% of followed up cases developed antibodies within 6 months. 
Abdominal abscess due to Cardiobacterium hominis and Clostridium bifermentans. A case of abdominal abscess and bacteremia due to Cardiobacterium hominis and Clostridium bifermentans was successfully treated with surgical drainage and ampicillin-penicillin. This case represents the rare occurrence of C. hominis infection without apparent endocarditis. 
9-[(2RS)-3-fluoro-2-phosphonylmethoxypropyl] derivatives of purines: a class of highly selective antiretroviral agents in vitro and in vivo. A new class of compounds, 9-[(2RS)-3-fluoro-2-phosphonylmethoxypropyl] [(RS)-FPMP] derivatives of purines, is described that has selective activity against a broad spectrum of retroviruses [including human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) and type 2 (HIV-2)] but not other RNA or DNA viruses. This activity spectrum is completely different from that of the parental compounds, 9-[(2S)-3-hydroxy-2-phosphonylmethoxypropyl] [(S)-HPMP] derivatives of purines, which are active against a broad range of DNA viruses. The racemic (RS)-FPMP derivatives of adenine and 2,6-diaminopurine, termed (RS)-FPMPA and (RS)-FPMPDAP, respectively, are markedly more selective as in vitro antiretroviral agents than their 9-(2-phosphonylmethoxyethyl) (PME) counterparts, PMEA and PMEDAP. Also, (RS)-FPMPA and (RS)-FPMPDAP have a substantially higher therapeutic index in mice in inhibiting Moloney murine sarcoma virus-induced tumor formation and associated death and are markedly less inhibitory to human bone marrow cells than PMEA and PMEDAP. The diphosphate derivative of (RS)-FPMPA [(RS)-FPMPApp] is a potent and selective inhibitor of HIV-1 reverse transcriptase but not of HSV-1 DNA polymerase or DNA polymerase alpha. (RS)-FPMPApp, akin to PMEA diphosphate (PMEApp), acts as a DNA chain terminator. The DNA chain-terminating properties of PMEApp and (RS)-FPMPApp seem to be a prerequisite for acyclic nucleoside phosphonates to exhibit antiretrovirus (i.e., anti-HIV) activity. 
The contribution of salvage surgery to the management of childhood osteosarcoma. Between January 1970 and December 1988, 174 consecutive patients under the age of 20 years with curatively resected primary osteosarcoma were treated at our institute; 72 in the years of 1970 to 1981 and 102 in the years 1982 to 1988. In the latter period, adjuvant chemotherapy was replaced by neoadjuvant programs, and new criteria were adopted for the management of lung metastases, consisting in early bilateral surgical staging and lung resection through median sternotomy for all patients with purely intrathoracic relapse. Follow-up was updated in December 1989. During the last period, the overall 5-year survival improved significantly from 35% to 58% (P less than .001). The disease-free survival rose from 38% to 45% at 5 years, with median values of 15 months versus 33 months, while the frequency of isolated lung metastases dropped from 58% to the actuarial 48%. The proportion of patients who underwent complete resections of their pulmonary metastases rose from 17% (seven of 42) to 55% (27 of 49), without operative mortality. Due to such a high proportion of patients eligible for salvage surgery, the overall survival from detection of lung metastases improved from 0% to 28% at 5 years (P less than .001). Contralateral occult metastases were resected in three of 15 subjects with monolateral clinical lesions, and five patients underwent subsequent lung resections. These data indicate that systematic bilateral pulmonary resection plays an important role in improving the final cure rate of childhood osteosarcoma, beyond the benefit resulting from neoadjuvant chemotherapy. 
Antiperistaltic and isoperistaltic intussusception associated with abnormal motility after Roux-en-Y gastric bypass: a case report. Antiperistaltic and recurrent intussusceptions are extremely rare in the adult. We report a patient with both. The patient developed an antiperistaltic intussusception distal to her Roux enteroenterostomy years after a Roux-en-Y gastric bypass for morbid obesity. The diagnosis was made preoperatively with gastrointestinal contrast radiography and ultrasonography. At surgery, the intussusception was reduced, and 12 inches of nonviable bowel was resected, with a functional end-to-end anastomosis. An isoperistaltic intussusception occurred in the early postoperative period just distal to the anastomosis. Manometric evaluation of the Roux limb after the second operation showed altered gastrointestinal motility, consisting of orad-propagated and aboard-propagated migrating motor complexes, minimal phase 2 activity, and lack of conversion to the fed pattern with a liquid meal. Although manometry was not performed before the development of the intussusception, our findings are consistent with the hypothesis that altered intestinal motility may contribute to the development of intussusception. 
Controlled clinical trials of drug treatment for hypertension. A review. We reviewed the designs and major results of 17 large-scale, controlled, clinical trials that reported the effects of drug treatment for hypertension on morbidity or mortality. Seven trials conducted in study populations with more-severe hypertension (diastolic blood pressures 100-120 mm Hg or higher), including the more-severe stratum of the Veterans Administration Trial, showed large reductions in stroke, other "hypertensive" events, and, in one trial, total mortality. Of 11 trials in populations with less-severe hypertension (diastolic blood pressures predominantly below 105 mm Hg), including the less-severe stratum of the Veterans Administration Trial, nine met the criteria for pooling of results. Among the aggregate 43,000 patients in the nine trials who were followed up for an average of 5.6 years, mean diastolic blood pressure reduction was 5.8 mm Hg, and a significant 11% reduction in total mortality was observed. This benefit was largely attributable to a 38% reduction in fatal strokes; nonfatal strokes were similarly reduced. Coronary heart disease mortality was 8% lower in drug treatment than in control groups, but this difference was not significant. A similar result was observed for combined coronary mortality and nonfatal myocardial infarction. A possible explanation for the inconclusive result regarding coronary end points was an adverse trend, observed in several trials, in a subgroup with baseline resting electrocardiographic abnormalities. Because all the trials except the propranolol arm of the Medical Research Council trial used drug regimens based on thiazide-like diuretic agents, and because there are now several new drug classes proposed as initial therapy, additional large-scale clinical trials may need to be considered. 
Risk factors for febrile seizures in the People's Republic of China: a case control study. A case control study was conducted to investigate the association of family history of febrile seizures (FS) and history of maternal, pregnancy and delivery, and postnatal factors with FS. Information was gathered by door-to-door survey in six major cities in the People's Republic of China. Factors present before the date of onset of FS were assessed in 182 subjects and in an equal number of controls matched for age, sex, and geographic area. The odds ratio for risk of FS in children with a family history of FS in a first-degree relative was 10.0 (confidence interval 2.7-58.6), confirming other observations that familial factors are an important predisposing characteristic for FS. Maternal acute respiratory infection during the first trimester of pregnancy was slightly more frequent in children with FS (odds ratio, 1.9 confidence interval 1.0-3.9). None of the other examined pregnancy or delivery factors was associated with an increased risk, suggesting that birth history is not an important factor predisposing to FS. 
Risks associated with an elevated maternal serum alpha-fetoprotein level. Among 58,187 women tested, 1002 had a maternal serum alpha-fetoprotein measuring greater than or equal to 2.5 multiples of the median after correction for race, weight, and insulin-dependent diabetes. They were stratified into three groups: group 1, 2.5 to 2.9; group 2, 3.0 to 5.0; group 3, greater than or equal to 5.0 multiples of the median. The initial risk of a serious abnormality detected by ultrasonography or amniocentesis was 17% (5%, 12% and 65% in groups 1, 2, and 3, respectively). After correction for twins and dates, this risk became 23% (7%, 18%, and 71% in groups, 1, 2, and 3, respectively). Among the women with high maternal serum alpha-fetoprotein levels, 556 (77%) had normal ultrasonographic and amniocentesis studies, and the risk of adverse pregnancy outcome ws 27% (19%, 29%, and 70% in groups 1, 2, and 3, respectively). There was a statistically significant increase in late fetal and perinatal death, prematurity and growth retardation, oligohydramnios, abruptio placentae, preeclampsia, and congenital abnormalities. The overall risk for abnormality or adverse outcome was 24% in group 1, 41% in group 2, and 91% in group 3. 
Mentally retarded individuals--a population at risk? When comparing the aging process of mentally retarded (MR) persons with the nondisabled population, researchers have established an earlier lower limit for the onset of old age for MR persons and a higher mortality rate. The reason for early senescence has not been successfully resolved, but the finding that cardiovascular disorders are the most prevalent form of disease among elderly MR persons suggests a relationship between lifestyles and higher mortality rate. Indeed, studies that evaluated the cardiovascular fitness (CVF) of MR individuals demonstrated substandard levels of fitness. The results of these studies, however, are not conclusive due to variation in test methodologies, motivational factors, and issues of test validity and reliability. Training studies which have purported to determine trainability of this population have also shown confusing results, perhaps attributed to the same protocol inconsistencies. Therefore, the purposes of this article are 1) to review previous methods of evaluating CVF of MR adults and determine whether testing methodologies invalidate the results of these studies, 2) to review training studies involving adult MR individuals and determine whether this population is capable of improving their CVF, and 3) to identify areas where further research is needed to fully describe the functional cardiovascular characteristics of MR adults. 
Accordion effect in tortuous right coronary arteries during percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty. Coronary spasm and intimal dissection are well-known complications of coronary angioplasty with potentially serious consequences. Their treatments are different and need to be instituted quickly to prevent vessel closure. We report two cases of mechanical deformation caused by the angioplasty hardware masquerading as dissection or spasm during coronary angioplasty of tortuous native right coronary arteries. 
A technique to accurately construct a contact dressing. We describe a technique to rapidly and accurately construct the contact layer of a composite dressing. This technique is simple to perform and is suitable for any open wound. It is especially useful for moderately sized wounds created during extirpation of tumors by Mohs micrographic surgery. 
Preperitoneal approach for hernia repair: clinical application in pediatric urology. The preperitoneal approach for inguinal hernia repair rarely is indicated in children. However, we report on its clinical usefulness for children in whom the perivesical space must be exposed, such as during surgical repair of bladder exstrophy, ureterocele and ureteral reimplantation. This approach allows for a true high ligation of the hernia sac, and the repair is safe, fast and effective. 
Colon perforation during colonoscopy: surgical versus conservative management. A survey of endoscopy units in the West Midlands, UK, was undertaken to ascertain the management of colonic perforation during colonoscopy. Fifteen perforations were reported from a total of 17,500 colonoscopies performed in 14 units (a rate of 0.09 per cent). In seven patients the diagnosis was suspected or diagnosed immediately and in the remaining eight 2-72 h later. Four patients with associated pathology (carcinoma, Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis and a polyp) had resection and primary anastomosis. Seven patients had a simple oversew, four of these having had a delayed diagnosis. In four cases the site of perforation was not identified, but only one patient had conservative treatment. Three patients had drainage and a defunctioning colostomy. There was no significant morbidity following treatment. It is recommended that patients who have had a good bowel preparation should be treated conservatively unless there is a large perforation or an underlying carcinoma. 
Pathologic correlates of survival in 378 lymph node-negative infiltrating ductal breast carcinomas. Mitotic count is the best single predictor. Pathologic features of 378 breast carcinomas without axillary lymph node metastases were correlated with long-term prognosis. Mitotic count, the feature best predicting prognosis, was most useful at lower mitotic count levels than usually studied. Cases with less than 4.5 mitotic figures per ten high-power fields had a 20-year tumor-related survival of 73% versus 48% for those with higher mitotic counts. Low and high mitotic count groups had significantly different prognoses for T1c, T2, and T3 tumors. Multivariate analysis showed that the best combination of features predicting tumor-related death were high mitotic count (relative risk, x 2.8), large tumor size (relative risk, x 1.7), lymphatic invasion (relative risk, x 1.7), and skin or subjacent muscle or chest wall invasion (relative risk, x 2.5). Nuclear grade, Bloom-Richardson grade, modified Scarff-Bloom-Richardson grade, Fisher's grade, and necrosis correlated well with survival but had no significant additional predictive value when adjusted for the mitotic count. 
Isolation of group 2 aerotolerant Campylobacter species from Thai children with diarrhea. Campylobacter species were isolated from 93 (15%) of 631 Thai children with diarrhea using the membrane filter technique on nonselective blood agar incubated at 37 degrees C. Campylobacter jejuni was isolated from 62 (10%), Campylobacter coli from 14 (2%), and atypical campylobacters from 17 (3%). The 17 atypical strains were first characterized biochemically and by dot blot DNA hybridization. Catalase-negative strains also were characterized by DNA hybridization and ribotype pattern. One strain was a catalase-negative "Campylobacter upsaliensis" and another was a nitrate-negative Campylobacter jejuni doylei. Fifteen isolates were aerotolerant strains most closely resembling Campylobacter cryaerophila or "C. upsaliensis" by dot hybridization. These aerotolerant strains, designated group 2 ("Campylobacter butzleri"), had ribotypes distinct from C. cryaerophila and have previously been shown to be related by DNA hybridization at the species level to the group 2 aerotolerant Campylobacter type strain (D2686). Group 2 aerotolerant Campylobacter were the atypical Campylobacter species most frequently isolated from Thai children with diarrhea. 
Limb vascular responsiveness to beta-adrenergic receptor stimulation in patients with congestive heart failure. BACKGROUND. In patients with congestive heart failure, the chronotropic and inotropic responses to beta-adrenergic agonists are reduced. It is not known whether desensitization of peripheral beta-adrenoceptors accounts for impaired limb vasodilation in these patients. Accordingly, we studied 14 normal subjects and 13 age-matched patients with congestive heart failure. METHODS AND RESULTS. To distinguish vasodilation mediated by beta-adrenoceptors and adenylate cyclase from that mediated by stimulation of guanylate cyclase, each subject received intrabrachial artery infusions of isoproterenol (1-100 ng/min) and sodium nitroprusside (0.3-10 micrograms/min), respectively. Forearm blood flow was determined by venous occlusion plethysmography. Maximal vasodilative potential, determined during reactive hyperemia, was reduced in the patients with congestive heart failure. The maximal forearm blood flow response to isoproterenol was comparable in patients with heart failure and in normal subjects (8.0 +/- 1.1 versus 9.2 +/- 1.2 ml/100 ml of tissue/min, respectively, p = NS). Furthermore, the dose-response relation to isoproterenol was similar in both groups. Likewise, the forearm vasodilative response to sodium nitroprusside was preserved in the heart failure group. Plasma concentration of norepinephrine was higher in the patients with heart failure (436 +/- 34 versus 201 +/- 74 pg/ml, p less than 0.01). When both groups were considered, there was no correlation between norepinephrine levels and the maximal forearm blood flow response to isoproterenol (r = 0.10, p = NS). CONCLUSIONS. We conclude that beta-adrenoceptor desensitization does not occur in the limb vessels of patients with congestive heart failure. 
Induction of transformational changes in normal endothelial cells by cultured human astrocytoma cells. Endothelial cell proliferation is a significant biological feature of malignant astrocytomas. The ability of the cells of these tumors to elaborate mitogenic angiogenesis factors has been well documented. However, less is known about the transformational effects that neoplastic astrocytes may have on the endothelial cells within malignant astrocytomas. In this study, the hypothesis that humoral factors elaborated by cells derived from malignant astrocytomas induce transformational changes in normal endothelial cells in vitro is investigated. Conditioned medium (CM) was prepared from exponentially growing cultures of a human glioblastoma cell line (UW18) and from two rat brain-tumor cell lines: an anaplastic astrocytoma (R175A) and a glioblastoma with sarcomatous elements (9L). Subconfluent target bovine aortic arch endothelial cells (BAEC's) were exposed for 48 hours to varying concentrations of CM prepared from each of these tumors, and then evaluated for transformational changes. Different molecular weight (MW) fractions of UW18 CM were prepared by molecular ultrafiltration, and each fraction was tested for transforming activity. Transformation endpoints included changes in cellular deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) and ribonucleic acid (RNA) content and distribution (measured by differential flow cytometry) and changes in de novo DNA synthesis determined by 3H-thymidine incorporation. Significant changes in the amount and distribution of DNA and RNA were observed in the BAEC's treated with UW18 CM compared to untreated BAEC's. At 10% concentrations of UW18 CM, changes in the RNA profile of target BAEC's were evident, and at 30% concentrations of UW18 CM, an irregular bimodal distribution was well established. Patterns of DNA were also altered in a concentration-dependent manner, with significant aneuploidy developing at UW18 CM concentrations of 20%. The DNA synthesis in BAEC's increased with increasing CM concentrations, up to a maximum of about 250% of control values at 30% concentrations of UW18 CM. The transformational changes induced after exposure of BAEC's to CM prepared from R175A and 9L were significantly less than those observed with UW18 CM. Molecular ultrafiltration was used to prepare UW18 CM fractions with MW cutoffs of less than 10 kD, 10 to 30 kD, and greater than 30 kD. Transformational activity was significant only in CM's with an MW of 10 to 30 kD. It is concluded that the UW18 human glioblastoma cell line elaborates a soluble factor, or group of factors, with an MW in the 10- to 30-kD range, capable of inducing transformational alterations in target normal endothelial cells, and that such transformation may account for some of the abnormal endothelial cell changes associated with malignant astrocytomas. 
Malignant peritoneal mesothelioma in childhood with long-term survival. A diffuse, well-differentiated, malignant peritoneal mesothelioma (MPM) developed in a nine-year-old girl. She received limited chemotherapy and radiation therapy and is alive and well without clinical evidence of disease 109 months after diagnosis. The neoplastic cells stained immunohistochemically for cytokeratin and epithelial membrane antigen but were unreactive with B72.3, anti-carcinoembryonic antigen, and anti-Leu-M1. Ultrastructurally, the tumor cells had abundant desmosomes, numerous tonofilament bundles, and variable-length microvilli. These findings confirm the mesothelial nature of the cells. Features consistent with malignancy included DNA aneuploidy by flow cytometric analysis and diffuse peritoneal involvement. The three previously described survivors with MPM were also premenarchal girls. Some MPMs in premenarchal girls have an indolent biologic behavior similar to that of low-grade peritoneal serous neoplasia or well-differentiated papillary mesothelioma in adult women. 
t-PA, PAI, and protein C before and after vascular occlusion of the upper limb in patients with Raynaud's phenomenon. Tissue plasminogen activator (t-PA) and its inhibitor (PAI) were assessed in venous blood drawn before and after venous occlusion (bvo, avo) for 33 patients with Raynaud's phenomenon (RP), 14 with primary RP (PRP), 9 with suspected secondary RP (SSRP), and 10 with definite collagen disease and secondary RP (SRP). There were significant differences in PAI values avo between PRP (and controls), SSRP, and SRP. PAI activity decreased significantly avo only in controls and in PRP, and there was significant t-PA antigen elevation avo in the same groups. In addition, since PAI is neutralized by activated protein C (PC), both PC antigen and PC activity were assessed avo and bvo. PC Ag remained unchanged in all groups, with PC activity significantly lower than controls in SRP and SSRP. Finally the authors looked for interference of anticardiolipin antibodies (ACA) and lupus-like anticoagulant (LAC) with the PC system in collagen disease-associated RP. Specific IgG ACA were found in only 1 patient with SRP. In conclusion, there is an endothelial derangement, involving t-PA release and PAI, in SSRP and SRP patients. The reduced PC activity in these latter groups appears to be due to increased PAI influence rather than to ACA/LAC. 
Blood and bone marrow eosinophilia in malignant tumors. Role and nature of blood and tissue eosinophil colony-stimulating factor(s) in two patients. Eosinophilia of the blood and bone marrow may be encountered in patients with disseminated malignancies. It is unrelated to the histologic type of the tumor but usually reflects its aggressiveness and prognostic outlook. Its pathogenesis is controversial. The presence of eosinophil colony-stimulating factor(s) in serum and malignant tissue extracts was evaluated in two cases of malignancies accompanied by marked blood and bone marrow eosinophilia. When compared with controls, serum and tumor tissue extracts stimulated the growth of G, M, and Eo colonies in semisolid cultures of human bone marrow. Such stimulating effect was inhibited by the addition of antibodies to granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) and interleukin-3. Thus, the colony-stimulating factor(s) play a role in the pathogenesis of the eosinophilia associated with some malignant tumors, and these factors appear to include GM-CSF, interleukin-3, and probably others. 
Determination of postmortem interval by arthropod succession: a case study from the Hawaiian Islands. A postmortem interval of 34 to 36 days was established for remains recovered on the island of Oahu, Hawaii, based on interpretations of patterns of arthropod succession on the remains. This interval was primarily based on the presence of adult specimens of Philonthus longicornis (family Staphylinidae), mature larvae of Piophila casei (family Piophilidae), and empty puparial cases of Chrysomya rufifacies (family Calliphoridae). Species and developmental stages of two additional Coleoptera species and three additional Diptera species were also present, which was consistent with the estimated interval, although not definitive. 
Patients admitted to the emergency room with symptoms indicative of acute myocardial infarction. All 7157 patients (55% men) admitted to the emergency room with chest pain or other symptoms indicative of acute myocardial infarction during a period of 21 months were registered consecutively. Chest pain was reported by 93% of the patients. On the basis of history, clinical examination, and electrocardiogram in the emergency room, all patients were prospectively classified in one of four categories: (i) obvious infarction (4% of all patients); (ii) strongly suspected infarction (20%); (iii) vague suspicion of infarction (35%); and (iv) no suspected infarction (41%). In patients with no suspected infarction (n = 2910), musculoskeletal (26%), obscure (21%) and psychogenic origins (16%) of the symptoms occurred most frequently. We conclude that few of the patients had an obvious infarction on admission, and that a musculoskeletal origin of the symptoms occurred most frequently in patients with no suspected infarction. 
Enteroscopic diagnosis of small bowel ulceration in patients receiving non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs 15 patients with rheumatoid arthritis who were receiving non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and who had chronic occult gastrointestinal bleeding underwent extended small bowel examination with a Sonde enteroscope. 7 patients (47%) were found to have jejunal or ileal ulceration. Small bowel enteroscopy may be a valuable technique for the investigation of undiagnosed gastrointestinal bleeding. 
Chromosomal origin of small ring marker chromosomes in man: characterization by molecular genetics [published erratum appears in Am J Hum Genet 1991 Aug;49(2):503] Ten cases of small ring chromosomes which did not stain with distamycinA/DAPI and did not possess satellite regions associated with nucleolus-organizing regions are described. In situ hybridization with a battery of biotinylated pericentric repeat probes specific either for individual chromosomes or for groups of chromosomes allowed the identification of the chromosomal origin of these marker chromosomes. There was one example of a marker derived from each of chromosomes 1, 3, 6, 14, 16, 18, 20, 13 or 21, and the X, and there were two examples of markers derived from chromosome 12. One case possessed two markers, one derived from chromosome 6, and one derived from the X. The mechanism of generation of ring marker chromosomes is discussed. Five of seven cases who could be phenotypically assessed were abnormal. Three of these--the first with a ring chromosome derived from chromosome 1; the second with two markers, one derived from chromosome 6 and the other from the X chromosome; and the third with a ring chromosome derived from chromosome 20--each possessed distinctive facies. Additional cases with identified rings may allow the delineation of new chromosomal syndromes. 
Ependymoma: internal correlations among pathological signs: the anaplastic variant. In a series of 298 cases of ependymoma, survival analysis identified some prognostic histological factors but failed to demonstrate a worse survival for the anaplastic variant diagnosed with the common criteria used for assessing anaplasia in primitive brain tumors. This finding suggests that either anaplastic ependymoma does not exist, or that the established criteria are not useful in its identification. To solve these problems, the association of histological, immunohistochemical, and ultrastructural signs in 173 intracranial cases was investigated and analyzed by means of contingency tables. Many signs had only focal distribution. Some signs, meaningful for anaplasia, such as very high cell density and number of mitoses, were found to be associated, whereas other signs usually considered indicative of anaplasia, such as endothelial hyperplasia, glomeruli, and necrosers, were not. In addition, pseudorosettes, mesodermic areas, and incomplete formation of perivascular pseudorosettes were signs associated with very high cell density and number of mitoses. Distribution of glial fibrillary acidic protein and vimentin, as well as other immunohistochemical and ultrastructural features, were not helpful, with the exception of microsettes found by electron microscopy. Our conclusion is that the anaplastic variant of ependymoma is recognizable only when some histological prognostic factors, such as cell density and number of mitoses, are maximally expressed. 
Longitudinal study of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system in hypertensive pregnant women: deviations related to the development of superimposed preeclampsia. A prospective longitudinal study of 25 pregnant women (30 pregnancies) with chronic hypertension, a group prone to development of preeclampsia, was conducted to explore the relationship between the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system and the development of superimposed preeclampsia. In women with chronic hypertension in whom preeclampsia did not develop (17 pregnancies), blood pressure decreased and the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system was stimulated, beginning in the first trimester and continuing throughout pregnancy as found previously in normotensive pregnant women (n = 58). Plasma estradiol and progesterone levels also increased progressively. In women with chronic hypertension in whom preeclampsia developed (13 pregnancies), blood pressure decreased and the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system was stimulated in the first trimester as in the other groups. However, later in pregnancy significant differences were observed. Blood pressure began to rise in the second trimester. Initially the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system remained stimulated, but in the early third trimester, when preeclampsia was diagnosed, plasma renin activity and urine aldosterone excretion decreased, and atrial natriuretic factor increased. These data provide information that may be useful in the recognition of superimposed preeclampsia, and in the investigation of its pathogenesis. 
Hypalgesic efficacy of acupuncture on experimental pain in man. Comparison of laser acupuncture and needle acupuncture. The analgesic effect of acupuncture on cutaneous heat stimuli of 43 degrees C has been evaluated in a controlled experimental study with healthy, informed volunteers. Laser acupuncture was administered to 39 probationers using a helium-neon laser under double-blind conditions. The point Hegu (L.I.4) and Jianqian (Extra.) on both sides were each irradiated for 1 min. Forty probationers were needled with stainless steel needles in the point Hegu (L.I.4) on both sides under single-blind conditions. Pain threshold was measured in terms of the time (in msec) that the probationers needed to perceive the cutaneous heat stimulus of 43 degrees C. The painful stimulus was generated by a computer-controlled standardized procedure. The Wilcoxon test was used for the statistical evaluation. Laser acupuncture did not change the pain threshold. Needle acupuncture did, however, increase the pain threshold compared with the initial value (alpha = 0.1%). The difference compared with the control group, where a placebo point was needled, was also significant (alpha = 5%). This controlled experimental study proves the analgesic effect of needle acupuncture on painful heat stimuli. Laser acupuncture had no effect on pain threshold in this study. 
Malignant biliary obstruction complicated by ascites: transjugular insertion of an expandable metallic endoprosthesis. Although the transjugular approach has long been used to provide safe access to the liver, it has not been used for placement of stents in biliary obstruction. The recent development of an expandable metallic endoprosthesis now makes this method more feasible. The case of a patient with malignant biliary obstruction complicated by ascites is presented herein. Palliation was achieved with an expandable biliary endoprosthesis placed by the transjugular-hepatic vein approach. 
Comparison of efficacy of automatic implantable cardioverter defibrillator in patients older and younger than 65 years of age. PURPOSE: The efficacy of the automatic implantable cardioverter defibrillator (AICD) was compared in elderly patients and younger patients with life-threatening ventricular tachyarrhythmias. Clinical characteristics, surgical complications, and long-term survival rates were compared between the two age groups. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A retrospective study was conducted of 54 elderly patients (greater than 65 years) and 79 younger patients (less than 65 years) who had had AICDs implanted for recurrent symptomatic ventricular tachycardia and/or ventricular fibrillation. RESULTS: In 85% of elderly patients and 78% of younger patients, coronary artery disease was the underlying disease (NS). The mean left ventricular ejection fraction was 31.4 +/- 14.3% in the elderly patients and 35.7 +/- 17.6% in the younger patients (NS). Concomitant myocardial revascularization was performed in 37% of elderly patients and 29% of younger patients (NS); however, only 4% of elderly patients had concomitant left ventricular resection or cryoablation, compared with 15% of younger patients (p less than 0.001). Two patients in each age group died perioperatively (4% versus 3%, NS), and no significant difference in surgical morbidity or length of hospital stay following AICD implantation was noted between the age groups. In conjunction with AICD, elderly patients more commonly received antiarrhythmic drugs, with 54% of elderly patients taking amiodarone at the time of hospital discharge compared with 29% of the younger patients (p less than 0.008). In contrast, beta-blockers were more commonly used in younger patients (16% versus 2%, p less than 0.03). At a mean follow-up of 25 months, 11 (20%) elderly patients and 16 (20%) younger patients had died. Six deaths in elderly patients and five deaths in younger patients were classified as arrhythmic deaths (NS); however, only one younger patient and three elderly patients died suddenly (NS). Calculated survival curves demonstrated similar survival rates in the two age groups with approximately 90%, 87%, and 80% of the patients alive at 1, 2, and 3 years, respectively. Theoretic survival curves calculated from appropriate AICD shocks demonstrated significantly lower survival compared with actual survival. CONCLUSION: It is concluded that AICD is a very effective treatment for life-threatening ventricular tachyarrhythmias, and this benefit applies to elderly patients as well as younger patients. 
Helicobacter pylori: aggressor or innocent bystander? Helicobacter pylori seeks gastric mucosa, whether found in the stomach, duodenum, or Barrett's esophagus. Definitive diagnosis can be secured by appropriate stains of mucosal biopsies and culture, but the rapid urease test, breath isotope studies, and serologic testing are also useful. The frequency of colonization increases with advancing age, but infection occurs earlier in underdeveloped countries. Although the reservoir is uncertain, water or food transmission seems likely. There is sufficient evidence to assign an etiologic role to the bacteria in the causation of type B antral gastritis. H. pylori is found in areas of gastric metaplasia within the duodenum and is associated with duodenitis. Although acute infection leads to hypochlorhydria, chronic colonization has little effect on acid secretion. Studies have thus far failed to establish a convincing relationship between H. pylori and nonulcer dyspepsia, although the bacteria may play a role in selected patients. H. pylori is found in association with most idiopathic gastric and duodenal ulcers, but it is unclear as to whether the bacteria plays a causative or permissive role. The organism has a predilection for intercellular spaces and the mucous layer, thus affording relative isolation from luminally active antibiotics. Monotherapy with bismuth preparations transiently eliminates the bacteria, but recolonization is rapid, probably due to regrowth of sequestered organisms. A combination of metronidazole, bismuth, and tetracycline (or amoxicillin) affords the best eradication rate, but the potential side effects of this program should be considered. The present therapy of duodenal ulcer disease is effective and without significant risk. Treatment of H. pylori should be reserved for those patients who relapse on adequate maintenance therapy. If a safe and effective antibiotic becomes available, more frequent testing and earlier treatment intervention may become more attractive. H. pylori is probably an "innocent bystander" for most patients, but the bacteria may sufficiently impair the defenses of the antral and duodenal mucosa to facilitate the development and relapse of ulcer disease in subsets of patients. 
Wound infiltration of local anaesthetic after lower segment caesarean section. The analgesic efficacy of subcutaneous wound infiltration with 20 ml of 0.5% bupivacaine after elective lower segment section Caesarean section was studied in 28 patients in a double-blind randomised controlled manner using a patient-controlled analgesia system. The mean 24-hour morphine consumption of the placebo group and the bupivacaine group was similar (76 mg and 68 mg respectively). Analysis of the cumulative hourly morphine consumption failed to show any statistically significant differences between the groups. However, on a weight-adjusted basis statistically significant differences in morphine consumption were demonstrated, although these may not be clinically important. Subjective experiences of pain, nausea and drowsiness assessed by linear analogue scoring were similar in both groups. 
Temporal bone findings in a family with branchio-oto-renal syndrome (BOR). A family group with confirmed branchio-oto-renal (BOR) syndrome was investigated in this study. Computerized tomography of the temporal bones has demonstrated that the malformations of the inner ear consist of hypoplastic structural changes within the cochlea with reduced vertical diameters, and absent or hypoplastic semicircular canals and normal endolymphatic ducts. It is concluded that in the present cases, the Mondini malformation of the cochlea is not associated with the BOR syndrome. 
Mycosis fungoides and the Sezary syndrome: a review of pathogenesis, diagnosis, and therapy. Mycosis fungoides (MF) and the Sezary syndrome (SS) are non-Hodgkin's lymphomas with a T-cell phenotype, which have cutaneous involvement as their predominant feature. These disorders are becoming more common, and the patients are frequently being referred to medical oncologists for assistance in management. The development of advanced laboratory techniques, such as molecular genetics and cell-surface phenotyping, has greatly enhanced our understanding of their pathogenesis and may lead to identification of responsible etiologic factors. A myriad of treatment options have been investigated including topical approaches, systemic chemotherapy, and external radiation. Currently, extensive trials are underway examining the potential benefits of agents such as the interferons, interleukin-2, monoclonal antibodies, the retinoids, 2-chlorodeoxyadenosine, and other novel biologic response modifiers or chemotherapeutics. Although all these therapies have benefit in phase II trials, few randomized comparative trials have been performed to identify optimal therapies. Performance of such trials should now become a priority. 
Impact of impinging wall jet on color Doppler quantification of mitral regurgitation. BACKGROUND. In clinical color Doppler examinations, mitral regurgitant jets are often observed to impinge on the left atrial wall immediately beyond the mitral valve. In accordance with fluid dynamics theory, we hypothesized that a jet impinging on a wall would lose momentum more rapidly, undergo spatial distortion, and thus have a different observed jet area from that of a free jet with an identical flow rate. METHODS AND RESULTS. To test this hypothesis in vivo, we studied 44 patients with mitral regurgitation--30 with centrally directed free jets and 14 with eccentrically directed impinging wall jets. Maximal color jet areas (cm2) (with and without correction for left atrial size) were correlated with mitral regurgitant volumes, flow rates, and fractions derived from pulsed Doppler mitral and aortic forward flows. The groups were compared by analysis of covariance. Mean +/- SD mitral regurgitant fraction, regurgitant volume, and mean flow rate averaged 37 +/- 17%, 3.06 +/- 2.65 l/min, and 147 +/- 118 ml/sec, respectively. The maximal jet area from color Doppler imaging correlated relatively well with the mitral regurgitant fraction in the patients with free mitral regurgitant jets (r = 0.74, p less than 0.0001) but poorly in the patients with impinging wall jets (r = 0.42, p = NS). Although the mitral regurgitant fraction was larger (p less than 0.05) in patients with wall jets (44 +/- 20%) than in those with free jets (33 +/- 15%), the maximal jet area was significantly smaller (4.78 +/- 2.87 cm2 for wall jets versus 9.17 +/- 6.45 cm2 for free jets, p less than 0.01). For the same regurgitant fraction, wall jets were only approximately 40% of the size of a corresponding free jet, a difference confirmed by analysis of covariance (p less than 0.0001). CONCLUSIONS. Patients with mitral regurgitation frequently have jets that impinge on the left atrial wall close to the mitral valve. Such impinging wall jets are less predictable and usually have much smaller color Doppler areas in conventional echocardiographic views than do free jets of similar regurgitant severity. Jet morphology should be considered in the semiquantitative interpretation of mitral regurgitation by Doppler color flow mapping. Future studies of the three-dimensional morphology of wall jets may aid in their assessment. 
Malignant biliary obstruction: percutaneous use of self-expandable stents A total of 83 self-expandable metallic stents were placed percutaneously in 69 patients for palliation of malignant biliary obstruction. Stent diameter was 1 cm; length, 3.5-10.5 cm. Of the 41 patients with common bile duct obstruction, 27 died 0.2-12 months (median, 3.2 months) after stent insertion. Two patients developed recurrent jaundice and cholangitis after 6 and 12 months, respectively. One patient underwent reintervention. Fourteen patients were alive without jaundice 1-8 months (median, 6.3 months) after stent placement. Of the 28 patients with hilar lesions, 13 died 0.7-7.6 months (median, 4.3 months) after stent placement. Fifteen were alive 1-15.5 months (median, 8.1 months) afterward. Recurrent jaundice and cholangitis were seen in eight of the 28 patients (28%) after 1-6 months (median, 3.6 months). The cause of malfunction of the stent(s) was tumor ingrowth in one patient, tumor overgrowth at the proximal end in five patients, and overgrowth at the distal end in two patients. Reintervention was performed in five patients (18%). Stent-related complications were seen in four patients. 
Aneurysms of the intracavernous carotid artery: a multidisciplinary approach to treatment. Of 43 cavernous sinus aneurysms diagnosed over 6 1/2 years, 23 fulfilled indications for treatment; of these 19 were treated, eight surgically and 11 with interventional radiological techniques. Six small and two giant aneurysms were treated surgically: four were clipped, two were repaired primarily, and two were trapped with placement of a saphenous-vein bypass graft. Seven large and four giant aneurysms were treated with interventional radiological techniques: in five cases the proximal internal carotid artery (ICA) was sacrificed; one aneurysm was trapped with detachable balloons; and five were embolized with preservation of the ICA lumen. The mean follow-up period was 25 months. At follow-up examination, three patients in the surgical group were asymptomatic, two had improved, and three had worsened. Three of these patients had asymptomatic infarctions apparent on computerized tomography (CT) scans. At follow-up examination, four radiologically treated patients were asymptomatic, five had improved, two were unchanged, and none had worsened. One patient had asymptomatic and one minimally symptomatic infarction apparent on CT scans; both lesions were embolic foci after aneurysm embolization with preservation of the ICA. It is concluded that treatment risk depends more on the adequacy of collateral circulation than on the size of the aneurysm. A multidisciplinary treatment protocol for these aneurysms is described, dividing patients into high-, moderate-, and low-risk groups based on pretreatment evaluation of the risk of temporary or permanent ICA occlusion using a clinical balloon test occlusion coupled with an ICA-occluded stable xenon/CT cerebral blood flow study. Radiological techniques are suggested for most low-risk patients, while direct surgical techniques are proposed for most moderate- and high-risk patients. 
Lumbar disc surgery: results of the Prospective Lumbar Discectomy Study of the Joint Section on Disorders of the Spine and Peripheral Nerves of the American Association of Neurological Surgeons and the Congress of Neurological Surgeons. The Prospective Lumbar Discectomy Study enrolled 740 patients in a multiphysician, multicenter, consecutive patient protocol to evaluate the indications and efficacy of lumbar discectomy. Five hundred and thirteen patients could be evaluated at 3 months after surgery. Stepwise logistic regression showed that the factors of fraction of pain referred to the back, work-related injury, absence of back pain on straight leg-raise examination, correspondence of leg pain to typical radicular patterns, leg pain on straight leg-raise examination, and reflex asymmetry were independently predictive of good outcome from surgery. Univariate analysis of the case with different numbers of predictive factors present showed that use of the operating microscope, sensory deficit, central disc bulge, and free disc fragment were correlated with outcome only in subgroups. An analysis of unsatisfactory outcomes showed two patterns: one of failure as a result of mechanical back pain and one of failure as a result of radiculopathy. Factors predictive of outcome did not influence the type of failure. In a stepwise logistic regression analysis, facetectomy and preoperative sensory deficit were associated with increased likelihood of mechanical back pain failure, while preoperative motor deficit was associated with an increased likelihood of radicular failure. The results support several intuitively derived and commonly believed principles of lumbar disc surgery. 
Umbilical cord occlusion stimulates breathing independent of blood gases and pH. The role of umbilical cord occlusion in the initiation of breathing at birth was investigated by use of 16 unanesthetized fetal sheep near full term. Artificial ventilation with high-frequency oscillation was used to control fetal arterial blood gas tensions. At baseline, PCO2 was maintained at control fetal values and PO2 was elevated to between 25 and 50 Torr. In the first study on six intact and four vagotomized fetuses, arterial PCO2 and PO2 were maintained constant during two 30-min periods of umbilical cord occlusion. Nevertheless, the mean fetal breathing rate increased significantly when the umbilical cord was occluded. In the second study on six intact fetuses, hypercapnia (68 Torr) was imposed by adding CO2 to the ventilation gas. When the umbilical cord was occluded, there was a significantly greater stimulation of breathing (rate, incidence, and amplitude) in response to hypercapnia than in response to hypercapnia alone. During cord occlusion, plasma prostaglandin E2 concentration decreased significantly. Results indicate that cord occlusion stimulates breathing possibly by causing the removal of a placentally produced respiratory inhibitor such as prostaglandin E2 from the circulation. 
v-abl causes hematopoietic disease distinct from that caused by bcr-abl. v-abl, the oncogene transduced by Abelson murine leukemia virus, was first characterized by its ability to transform lymphoid cells. bcr-abl, the oncogene formed by a t(9;22) translocation thought to occur in human hematopoietic stem cells, is detectable in almost all cases of chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML), a malignancy of granulocytic cells. bcr-abl also causes a CML-like syndrome in mice whose bone-marrow cells are infected with a retrovirus transducing the gene. More recent reports have suggested that v-abl can, however, cause a disease similar to CML. We demonstrate here that v-abl, when transduced in a helper virus-containing system, causes disease similar to, but distinct from, the CML-like syndrome induced by bcr-abl. Animals whose bone marrow has been infected by v-abl virus develop modest splenomegaly, marked granulocytosis, and malignant disease of several hematopoietic cell types. Unlike animals with CML-like disease resulting from bcr-abl, the polymorphonuclear leukocytes from animals infected with a v-abl construct do not contain the v-abl provirus at a significant frequency. Histopathologic analysis also shows significant differences between the diseases caused by v-abl and bcr-abl. 
Loss of transforming growth factor beta 1 receptors and its effects on the growth of EBV-transformed human B cells. Transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) is a potent negative regulator of normal human B cell growth mediated by exogenous signals, including IL-2 and low m.w. B cell growth factor 12 kDa (BCGF-12 kDa). In the present study, we investigated the regulatory linkage between viral or nonviral transformation of human B cells and the growth inhibitory effects of TGF-beta 1. A panel of EBV+ and EBV- B cell lines, derived either by in vitro EBV B cell transformation, or from cases of lymphoma was used to quantitate the negative growth effects of TGF-beta 1. The proliferative response of three EBV- B cell lines to rBCGF-12 kDa or serum was inhibited by low concentrations of TGF-beta 1 (0.2-0.5 ng/ml for 50% maximal effect), as measured by tritiated thymidine uptake and viable cellular recovery. In contrast, rBCGF-12 kDa or serum mediated proliferation of three EBV+ B cell lines was refractory to the growth inhibitory effects of TGF-beta 1. In an attempt to understand the mechanism(s) for this differential growth control in EBV+ and EBV- B cells, we studied the expression of TGF-beta 1, c-myc, and TGF-beta 1 receptors. No correlation was observed between the expression of TGF-beta 1 or c-myc gene and growth inhibition by TGF-beta 1 in the cell lines studied. Our results indicate that sensitivity or resistance to TGF-beta 1 correlated with the presence or absence (loss) of high affinity receptors for TGF-beta 1. EBV- B cell lines expressed levels of high affinity receptors similar to those found on activated normal B or T cells. In contrast, EBV+ B cell lines showed no detectable high affinity receptors. Chemical cross-linking studies with a bifunctional reagent, dissuccinimidyl suberate revealed a normal expression of type I (65-70 kDa), type II (85-90 kDa), and type III (280-300 kDa) TGF-beta 1 high affinity receptors on EBV- B cell lines. In contrast, EBV+ B cell lines did not express type I and type II receptors, whereas type III receptors were expressed but could not be inhibited by unlabeled TGF-beta 1.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS). 
Elevated serum levels of tumor necrosis factor-alpha after bronchoscopy and bronchoalveolar lavage. Fiberoptic bronchoscopy and bronchoalveolar lavage are often followed by the development of fever and other influenza-like symptoms. We report the onset of these symptoms in a healthy volunteer following bronchoscopy and bronchoalveolar lavage; the symptoms were temporally associated with the dramatic elevation of serum levels of tumor necrosis factor. Our observations suggest that tumor necrosis factor may be involved in mediating fever and other influenza-like symptoms occurring after bronchoscopy. 
Purpura fulminans and adrenal hemorrhage due to group Y meningococcemia in an elderly woman. A 70-year-old previously healthy woman was admitted with a 1-day history of malaise, sore throat, nausea, vomiting, rigors, and confusion. She was found to be in septic shock with purpura fulminans and disseminated intravascular coagulation. She died within 36 hours of admission. Blood cultures grew Neisseria meningitidis group Y. Necropsy revealed evidence of shock and bilateral adrenal hemorrhage. 
Effect of a bulk-forming cathartic on diarrhea in tube-fed patients. Diarrhea is a significant complication for the patient being tube-fed. The purpose of this study was to observe whether giving a bulk-forming cathartic to patients receiving enteral nutrition via nasogastric or nasoduodenal tube would result in firmer stools for these patients. Forty-nine patients in a large medical center were randomly assigned to either a control or an experimental group. During the 6-day study period 1 teaspoon (5 ml) of psyllium preparation was administered through the feeding tube three times a day. Data were analyzed by using the Mann-Whitney U test for nonparametric data. The hypothesis that giving a bulk-forming cathartic would lead to firmer stools was supported at an alpha level of less than 0.01. The results of this study suggest that use of a bulk-forming cathartic in tube-fed patients will significantly reduce the diarrhea associated with this type of feeding. 
Radical hysterectomy versus radiation therapy for stage IB squamous cell cancer of the cervix. Three hundred forty-five patients with Stage IB squamous cell carcinoma of the cervix were treated at the University of Michigan Medical Center from 1970 to 1985. The overall cumulative 5-year survival rate was 89% and the mean age was 44.6 years. In 213 patients undergoing radical hysterectomy the cumulative 5-year survival rate was 92%; 14 patients were explored for radical hysterectomy that was not performed due to high risk features and their survival rate was 50%. Ninety-seven patients underwent radiation therapy as initial treatment and had a 5-year survival rate of 86%. There was no significant difference when radiation therapy was compared with radical hysterectomy (P = 0.098). The survival rates for lesions 3 cm or smaller were 94% for radical hysterectomy and 88% for radiation therapy. When the lesion was larger than 3 cm, the survival rates were 82% with radical surgery and 73% with radiation therapy. Metastatic disease to lymph nodes was present in 26 of the 213 patients undergoing radical hysterectomy. When 1 to 3 nodes were involved 16 of 19 patients survived and when 4 to 10 nodes were involved 3 of 7 patients survived. The addition of radiation therapy did not influence survival. Complications were similar in both treatment groups. Fistulas occurred in 4 of 213 patients undergoing radical hysterectomy and 1 of 111 undergoing radiation. Second surgery for a complication was required in 6 of 213 patients undergoing radical hysterectomy and 7 of 111 undergoing radiation. Survival and complication rates in early stage squamous cell carcinoma of the cervix are equal with either radical surgery or radiation therapy. 
Chemotherapy update. The administration of chemotherapy is one of the major forms of cancer treatment. Recent progress in the use of chemotherapeutic agents has evolved from an understanding of the basic mechanisms of tumor cell kinetics and the molecular and biochemical basis for individual and multidrug resistance patterns. These advances have led to the development of novel approaches to the administration of cancer chemotherapeutic agents. Nurses must remain knowledgeable about these concepts to understand the mechanisms underlying the administration of various combinations of cancer chemotherapy. 
Application of estrogen receptor immunocytochemical assay to aspirates from mammographically guided fine needle biopsy of nonpalpable breast lesions. The importance of hormone receptors in the management and prognosis of breast cancer is well established, but difficult to apply to the growing numbers of very small breast cancers being detected. To assess the feasibility of applying estrogen receptor immunocytochemical assay (ER-ICA) to cytologic specimens, we prospectively studied 100 patients who had fine needle aspiration biopsy (FNAB) of mammographically detected nonpalpable breast lesions. All 100 patients also had surgical excision of these nonpalpable lesions immediately after cytologic aspiration. Twenty malignancies were ultimately diagnosed by histology; 17 of them had been cytologically diagnosed. Using specific monoclonal antibody for estrogen receptor, we applied ER-ICA to cytologic preparation of 15 malignant neoplasms with sufficient cellular material available for the assay. Positive immunostaining was demonstrated in nine cases. No ER expression was seen in six cases. Immunocytochemical assay was also done on frozen tissue of the corresponding surgically removed tumors, with 86.6% concordance between the two results. This study is the first to demonstrate that ER-ICA can be effective in assessing hormone receptor content of mammographically directed cytologic aspirates. 
Clinical implications of pathophysiologic changes in the midlife hypertensive patient. Both aging and hypertension decrease cardiac output through a lower stroke volume and a diminished beta-adrenergic responsiveness. In parallel, the vascular resistance increases because of vascular hypertrophy. In addition, in hypertension the alpha-adrenergic responsiveness is enhanced. Aging and hypertension are also associated with an increase in plasma cholesterol and insulin values. These alterations in cholesterol and insulin levels become particularly pronounced in middle-aged patients with hypertension. alpha-Adrenergic-blocking agents have a positive effect on lipids and insulin resistance. The shift toward enhanced alpha-adrenergic responsiveness, and the fact that vasodilators do not diminish exercise performance favor the use of alpha-blockers as a first drug in middle-aged patients with hypertension. Blood pressure lowering still remains the paramount goal, and these compounds should be used only if proved to be efficacious in a given individual patient. 
An approach to the evaluation and treatment of microscopic hematuria. Persistent microscopic hematuria in children is most often benign or untreatable. The evaluation of microscopic hematuria in an otherwise healthy child need not require invasive and costly laboratory studies. The initial evaluation must look for signs of life-threatening causes of hematuria, i.e., hypertension, edema, oliguria, or significant proteinuria. If these are absent, a stepwise evaluation is suggested, which includes microscopic examination of the urine for red blood cell casts, a test for proteinuria, serum creatinine, and serial follow-up. Renal biopsy may establish a diagnosis but rarely changes the treatment in a child with asymptomatic isolated microscopic hematuria. 
Infantile meningitis in England and Wales: a two year study. A two year prospective study identified 1922 cases of meningitis in children under 1 year of age. A further 201 cases were identified from other sources. The annual incidence of meningitis during the first year of life was 1.6/1000; during the first 28 days of life it was 0.32/1000, and among postneonatal infants it was 1.22/1000. The male:female ratio was 1.4:1. The overall case fatality rate was 19.8% for neonates and 5.4% for postneonatal infants. Two thirds of deaths identified in the study, 50% of all deaths, were not attributed to meningitis by the Office of Population Censuses and Surveys. Group B beta haemolytic streptococci (28%), Escherichia coli (18%), and Listeria monocytogenes (5%) were most frequently isolated from neonates and Neisseria meningitidis (31%), Haemophilus influenzae (30%), and Streptococcus pneumoniae (10%) from postneonatal infants. At 2-6 months of age N meningitidis meningitis was most common, and at 7-12 months H influenzae predominated. Meningitis caused by group B beta haemolytic streptococci occurred up to 6 months of age and had a consistent mortality of 25%. Neonatal meningitis due to Gram negative enteric rods had a mortality of 32%. Low birth weight was a significant predisposing factor for both neonates and postneonatal infants. In both groups mortality was significantly higher among children admitted in coma. There was no seasonal variation in incidence in either group. Neonates were treated with either group. Neonates were treated with either chloramphenicol (50%) or gentamicin (48%) usually in combination with a penicillin; 40% received a third generation cephalosporin. Of the 1472 postneonatal infants treated 84% received chloramphenicol with a penicillin and 10% received a third generation cephalosporin. 
Interleukin-2 and lymphokine-activated killer cells in 15 children with advanced metastatic neuroblastoma. A phase II trial using interleukin-2 (IL2) and lymphokine-activated killer (LAK) cells was carried out in an attempt to treat children with end-stage neuroblastoma. Fifteen patients (median age, 7 years) were enrolled in the study. Twelve were in relapse after massive chemotherapy and autologous bone marrow transplantation (ABMT), and three had a primary refractory disease after conventional chemotherapy. IL2 was administered as an 18 x 10(6) IU/m2/d continuous infusion. One course consisted of a double 5-day treatment period separated by a 6-day break. Cytapheresis to harvest LAK progenitor cells was performed during the rest period. After a 4-day in vitro culture, LAK cells were reinjected during the second cycle of therapy. A phenotypic and functional analysis of immunologic parameters was conducted along with the therapeutic protocol. Toxicity was significant with two toxic deaths (cardiotoxicity and respiratory distress). The reinfusion of large amounts of LAK cells was clearly involved in one case, but this particularly severe toxicity has to be related to the patient's status (ie, heavy pretreatment). No significant clinical response was seen. The immunologic monitoring showed phenotypic and functional modifications in these patients before initiation of treatment and an unexpected absence of evolution of these parameters during IL2 therapy. Although the origin of these immune dysfunctions is not clear, they could be involved in the failure of IL2 therapy. Future studies of IL2 therapy in neuroblastoma should be undertaken earlier in the course of the disease. 
Unexplained weight loss in the ambulatory elderly. Significant unexplained and unintentional weight loss was found in 45 elderly patients who were identified by computer search of the diagnostic files of seven family practice centers. We performed a case series chart review study which revealed that 24% of the 45 cases had no definitive etiology for the weight loss after two years of extensive clinical investigation. Depression was found to be the most common diagnosis made (18%) followed by cancer (16%). Only four patients died during the study period and all had cancer. The most prevalent diagnosis in this group of ambulatory elderly patients did not prove to be cancer, as often though, but rather "unexplained weight loss." CT scans were not found to be helpful as screening tests in the evaluation of weight loss. Using the data from this study, the diagnostic evaluations of elderly patients with unexplained weight loss may be more efficiently directed. 
Irrationality in the management of breast cancer. I. The staging system. The historic development of breast cancer staging began early in the 20th century with the simple concept of early localized disease, spread to regional nodes, and the presence of distant metastases. This last group often was divided into patients with advanced but perhaps still curable locoregional disease and incurable patients with distant metastases. As increasing numbers of prognostic factors were recognized, efforts were made to incorporate them into the staging systems to combine patients with similar prognosis into the same stages. These attempts resulted in the development of four classifications, namely, the Columbia, Manchester, International, and American tumor-node-metastasis (TNM) staging systems. Although many benefits of staging were reported, the most important was that of permitting valid comparisons between different treatments and different institutions. Many success-limiting factors were noticed during the developmental years, and even though the TNM system has been accepted, numerous speakers and authors present their staged data in a confusing and ambiguous manner. Recommendations are made that would permit clarification of presentations to general medical audiences along with recognizable statistical validity. 
Biliary bile acid profiles in familial adenomatous polyposis. Patients with familial adenomatous polyposis have an excess risk for adenomas and cancers of the upper and lower gastrointestinal tract. In the upper intestine these lesions occur mainly around the ampulla of Vater and they parallel mucosal exposure to bile. In view of this finding and of evidence that bile acids play a role in colorectal carcinogenesis, biliary bile acid profiles were determined in 29 patients with familial adenomatous polyposis (12 before colectomy, 17 after colectomy) and in 28 patients without familial adenomatous polyposis (all with colons in situ). Patients with familial adenomatous polyposis had a higher total biliary bile acid concentration than the others. The bile of patients with polyposis had a greater proportion of chenodeoxycholic acid and a lower proportion of deoxycholic acid than did the bile of patients without polyposis. The ratio of chenodeoxycholic acid and its metabolite lithocholic acid to cholic acid and its metabolite deoxycholic acid, which is related to subsequent bile acid profiles in the colon, was higher in patients with polyposis. Because bile acids influence cellular proliferation, these findings may be of importance with respect to intestinal adenoma and cancer growth. 
Quantitative analysis of inflammatory cell influx, procollagen type I synthesis, and collagen cross-linking in incisional wounds: influence of PDGF-BB and TGF-beta 1 therapy. Platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF-BB homodimer) and transforming growth factor-beta 1 (TGF-beta 1) are potent wound-healing hormones that accelerate incisional repair. To identify more precisely and quantitatively the stage(s) of wound healing influenced by growth-factor therapy, we investigated the three sequential tissue repair processes--inflammatory cell influx, intracellular procollagen type I (PC-I) synthesis, and collagen cross-linking--in recombinant growth factor--treated wounds. Using newly developed automated, quantitative image-analysis techniques, we observed that PDGF-BB markedly augmented the directed migration of macrophages into wounds during the first week after wounding and triggered and earlier and more sustained influx of PC-I--containing fibroblasts into the wound when compared with results in TGF-beta 1-treated or control wounds (p = 0.015 at day 2; p = 0.007 at day 21). In contrast, automated image analysis revealed TGF-beta 1-treated wound fibroblasts had a nearly twofold increase in intracellular levels of PC-I protein when compared with PDGF-BB-treated or control wound fibroblasts (p = 0.004 at day 4). However, the influence of TGF-beta 1 was transient, and the longer duration of PDGF-BB activity suggested a later influence, perhaps on the collagen remodeling phase, which is ultimately required for increased wound strength. To address this possibility, collagen cross-linking in growth factor-treated wounds was inhibited by beta-aminoproprionitrile (BAPN) treatment, and wound breaking strength was analyzed. Both PDGF-BB and TGF-beta 1 continued to enhance repair in BAPN-treated rats, indicating that they do not function primarily at the level of collagen cross-linking. Thus, PDGF-BB appears to enhance the inflammatory phase of wound healing to indirectly trigger PC-I synthesis, whereas TGF-beta 1 quantitatively enhances PC-I synthesis directly, accounting for their differing duration of activities within healing wounds. 
Dideoxyinosine in children with symptomatic human immunodeficiency virus infection. BACKGROUND. 2',3'-Dideoxyinosine (ddl) is a dideoxynucleoside with potent activity in vitro against the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). In initial clinical trials in adults, ddl showed evidence of antiretroviral activity with little hematologic toxicity. METHODS. We conducted a phase I-II study in 43 children with symptomatic (CDC class P-2) HIV infection. Of these children, 16 (median age, 10 years) had previously received zidovudine, and 27 (median age, 2.6 years) had not. ddl was administered orally in three divided doses totalling 60, 120, 180, 360, or 540 mg per square meter of body-surface area per day for 24 weeks. Eight of the 43 patients did not complete 24 weeks of ddl: 6 died, 1 was withdrawn because of progressive disease, and the other because of toxicity. RESULTS. After oral administration, ddl was rapidly absorbed, although its bioavailability varied greatly among patients. Pancreatitis developed in two children, one receiving ddl at each of the two highest doses. The median CD4 cell count in 38 patients with paired counts increased from 0.218 x 10(9) per liter (218 per cubic millimeter) at base line to 0.327 x 10(9) per liter (327 per cubic millimeter) after 20 to 24 weeks (P = 0.001). Those with CD4 cell counts above 0.1 x 10(9) per liter (100 per cubic millimeter) at base line were significantly more likely to improve in this respect. The median levels of p24 antigen (in 27 patients with detectable levels at entry) declined from 272 pg per milliliter at base line to 77 pg per milliliter at 20 to 24 weeks (P = 0.005). The plasma concentration of ddl correlated significantly with both the degree of decline in the p24 antigen and the degree of improvement in IQ score. Improvement in clinical and immunologic measures occurred in both the previously untreated patients and in those who had been treated with zidovudine. CONCLUSIONS. Dideoxyinosine was well tolerated and showed promising antiretroviral activity in HIV-infected children. The correlation between the clinical response and the plasma concentration of ddl indicates that bioavailability is an important consideration in the use of ddl to treat HIV infection and that individualized pharmacokinetic monitoring and dose adjustment may be important for optimal activity. 
Use of graded exercise to evaluate physiological hyperreactivity to mental stress. Physiological hyperreactivity (i.e., response in excess of metabolic requirements) to mental stress has been implicated in the etiology of coronary heart disease. This study evaluated potential hyperreactivity of cardiovascular, pulmonary, and biochemical variables to mental stress. Thirty healthy males, 19-36 yr, performed a mental arithmetic task and cycle ergometry at three powerloads. Linear regressions were calculated for each of 17 dependent variables during exercise, with oxygen uptake (VO2) serving as the independent variable. Ten variables were significantly correlated (P less than 0.003) with VO2 during exercise and, therefore, were predicted at the VO2 observed during the arithmetic task. The actual level of each variable observed during the arithmetic task was compared with the level predicted from the exercise by paired t-tests. Heart rate, systolic and diastolic blood pressure, rate-pressure product, minute ventilation, respiratory frequency, and respiratory exchange ratio were significantly greater (7-32%, P less than 0.005) during the arithmetic task than predicted from the exercise at an equivalent VO2. Plasma cortisol and serum lipid variables were not useful for evaluating hyperreactivity. Results demonstrated that graded aerobic exercise can serve as a reference for evaluating physiological hyperreactivity to mental stress for a group of ten variables which were significantly correlated with VO2 during graded exercise. 
Recurrent parotitis and sialectasis in childhood. Clinical, radiologic, immunologic, bacteriologic, and histologic study. Twenty children with juvenile recurrent parotitis, between 3 months and 16 years of age at onset, were followed up over a period of 7 to 22 years. Radiologic, histopathologic, cytologic, immunologic, and bacteriologic studies were performed to investigate the cause of sialectasis, commonly found in juvenile recurrent parotitis, and the pathogenesis of the disease. It was considered that a combination of a congenital malformation of portions of the salivary ducts and infections ascending from the mouth following dehydration of the children are contributory to the pathogenesis of the disease. The results of the investigations into the cause of the disease appear to exclude an auto-immunologic response or an allergic condition, an immature immune response, mumps, a sensitivity to upper respiratory tract infection, and familial factors. 
Efficacy of a postoperative regimen of enoxaparin in deep vein thrombosis prophylaxis. Venous thromboembolism is a common complication in patients undergoing elective hip replacement, in whom the incidence of calf vein thrombosis is 40% to 60%; proximal vein thrombosis, 20%; and fatal pulmonary embolism, 1% to 2% when prophylaxis is not used. A double-blind, randomized trial comparing low-molecular-weight heparin (enoxaparin) with placebo for the prevention of venous thrombosis in patients undergoing elective hip surgery was carried out. Prophylactic treatment with a fixed dose was begun postoperatively and continued for 14 days. Fifty patients in each treatment group underwent surveillance with 125I-fibrinogen leg scanning and impedance plethysmography. In the first 24 patients, venography was performed only if their surveillance test was positive. Venography was requested in the remaining 76 patients even if the screening tests were negative; in this latter group, venous thrombosis occurred in 4 patients (10.8%) given enoxaparin and 20 patients (51.3%) given placebo (p = 0.0002). The corresponding rates for proximal vein thrombosis were 5.4% and 23.1%, respectively (p = 0.029). In the entire group of 100 patients, venous thrombosis occurred in 12% of those given enoxaparin and 42% of those given placebo (p = 0.0007). The corresponding rates for proximal vein thrombi were 4% and 20%, respectively (p = 0.014). The observed hemorrhagic rate was 5% in each treatment group. The results of this study show that prophylaxis with fixed-dose enoxaparin is effective and safe for patients undergoing elective hip replacement. 
Engagement of interleukin-7 receptor stimulates tyrosine phosphorylation, phosphoinositide turnover, and clonal proliferation of human T-lineage acute lymphoblastic leukemia cells. The purposes of this study were to examine the biologic effects of the engagement of the interleukin-7 receptor (IL-7R) with recombinant human interleukin-7 (rhIL-7) in immunophenotypically distinct T-lineage acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) blasts and to elucidate the biochemical nature of the IL-7R-linked transmembrane signal in rhIL-7-responsive T-lineage ALL blast populations. In the absence of costimulants, rhIL-7 stimulated the in vitro proliferation and colony formation of freshly isolated leukemic blasts from six to eight T-lineage ALL patients with a mean plating efficiency of 196 +/- 53 (background subtracted) colonies/10(5) blasts plated. Stimulation of T-lineage ALL blasts with rhIL-7 resulted in markedly enhanced tyrosine phosphorylation of six distinct phosphoproteins with molecular weights of 57, 72, 98, 123, 150, and 190 Kd, and induced a rapid increase in the production of inositol-1,4,5-trisphosphate (Ins-1,4,5-P3), which was inhibitable by the tyrosine-specific protein kinase inhibitor genistein, but not by the serine/threonine-specific protein kinase C inhibitor H7. Similarly, rhIL-7 stimulated Ins-1,4,5-P3 production in CEM-1.3 T-lineage ALL cells and this stimulation was inhibitable by the tyrosine-specific protein kinase inhibitors genistein and herbimycin A, but not by H-7. Thus, the transmembrane signal triggered by engagement of the IL-7R is intimately linked to a functional tyrosine-specific protein kinase pathway and stimulates the phosphoinositide (PI) turnover and proliferation of T-lineage ALL blasts. The presented data confirm and extend previous studies on the expression of functional IL-7R on T-lineage ALL blasts and support the hypothesis that IL-7 may play an important regulatory role in the biology of T-lineage ALL. 
Late recurrent Candida endocarditis. Late recurrent Candida endocarditis (LRCE) developed on a prosthetic mitral valve 22 months after treatment for primary native mitral valve endocarditis. The LRCE was difficult to diagnose; results of two dimensional echocardiography and repeated blood cultures were negative. Only transesophageal echocardiography revealed a vegetation and only lysis centrifugation blood cultures demonstrated candidemia. Postmortem examination revealed a large Candida vegetation on the prosthetic valve and Candida in the mitral valve ring. This case and a review of the literature indicate that Candida endocarditis treated with amphotericin B and prosthetic valve replacement may recur months after treatment, and that LRCE, which is difficult to diagnose and treat, may be best prevented by lifelong antifungal suppressive therapy. 
Successful excision of a juvenile-type spinal arteriovenous malformation following intraoperative embolization. Case report. The case of a 57-year-old woman with a 14-year history of progressive paraparesis is presented. Selective spinal angiography revealed a juvenile-type spinal arteriovenous malformation (AVM) with a typical large size and rapid flow. The AVM was located primarily in the retromedullary space at the cervicothoracic junction. The AVM was successfully obliterated by intraoperative embolization using isobutyl-2-cyanoacrylate and surgical excision. 
Spontaneous and corticotropin-releasing factor-induced cytosolic calcium transients in corticotrophs. Spontaneous and CRF-stimulated changes in the cytosolic free calcium concentration ([Ca2+]i) were studied in two types of corticotrophs: 1) cultured human ACTH-secreting pituitary adenoma cells (hACTH cells), and 2) identified small ovoid corticotrophs cultured from normal rat pituitaries. [Ca2+]i was monitored in individual corticotrophs by dual emission microspectrofluorimetry using indo-1 as the intracellular fluorescent Ca2+ probe. In hACTH cells, [Ca2+]i measurements were carried out in combination with electrophysiological recordings obtained using whole cell patch-clamp techniques. It was shown that a single spontaneous Ca(2+)-dependent action potential led to a marked transient increase in [Ca2+]i in human tumoral corticotrophs. Spontaneous fluctuations in [Ca2+]i were also observed in unpatched corticotrophs whether derived from human pituitary tumors or normal rat tissue. Based on their striking kinetic features and their sensitivity to external Ca2+, we suggest that these spontaneous [Ca2+]i transients were the consequence of action potential firing. Under separate voltage-clamp (patch-clamp) conditions, tumor corticotrophs showed two Ca2+ current components: a low threshold, rapidly inactivating (T-type) current, and a higher threshold, slowly inactivating (L-type) current. The dihydropyridine Ca2+ channel blocker PN 200-110 (100 nM) abolished the L-type current without affecting the T-type current, while the inorganic Ca2+ channel blocker Cd2+ (200 microM) suppressed both Ca2+ currents. The Na+ channel blocker tetrodotoxin (5 microM) did not affect inward currents in tumor corticotrophs. Both L- and T-type voltage-gated Ca2+ channels were involved in controlling [Ca2+]i transients in both tumor and normal corticotrophs, inasmuch as Cd2+ (200 microM) abolished [Ca2+]i) transients, while PN 200-110 (100 nM) greatly diminished, but did not completely abolish, [Ca2+]i transients. The latter did not appear to depend on a voltage-dependent Na+ influx, since they were unaffected by tetrodotoxin (5 microM). Corticotrophs generate [Ca2+]i transients in response to the hypothalamic secretagogue CRF by acting on their membrane excitability. Indeed, we demonstrated in combined fluorescent and electrophysiological experiments that CRF (100 nM) had a coordinate action on human tumoral corticotrophs comprised of a modest depolarization and an increase in the frequency of both action potentials and subsequent [Ca2+]i transients. A coincident increase in the peak amplitude of the [Ca2+]i transient and after hyperpolarization was also observed in some CRF-stimulated cells. CRF (100 nM) evoked qualitatively similar [Ca2+]i patterns in human tumoral and normal rat corticotrophs not subjected to patch-clamping.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS). 
Detection of human papillomavirus DNA by in situ DNA hybridization and polymerase chain reaction in premalignant and malignant oral lesions. The sensitivity of detection of human papillomavirus (HPV) DNA in premalignant and malignant oral lesions by in situ hybridization (ISH) and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) were compared. With both methods HPV DNA was found in 4 of 24 cases of epithelial dysplasia, 4 of 14 cases of verrucous hyperplasia, and 1 of 10 cases of squamous cell carcinoma. The 10 cases of smokeless tobacco keratoses and 3 cases of verrucous carcinoma that we examined were all negative for HPV DNA. The PCR for the E6 open reading frame of HPV-16 correctly identified all cases that were positive by ISH. Only a single case that was positive by PCR was negative by ISH for HPV DNA. However, the PCR demonstrated the presence of HPV-16 infection in one case, which had hybridized most intensely with the probe for types 31/33/35 in the ISH. This discrepancy probably is due to the high degree of cross-hybridization in the ISH assay. PCR appears to be an effective technique for identifying HPV-16 DNA sequences in biopsy material from premalignant and malignant oral lesions. 
Neurogenic and nonneurogenic pain and inflammatory mediators. Pain is not a simple perception. Although millions of people suffer because of it and billions of dollars are spent trying to eradicate it, we are only in our infancy of understanding the very complex interactions necessary to perceive or distort our feelings of pain. We must continue to seek a better understanding of not only our patients' macroscopic impression of pain, but we must look microscopically at each cell involved in the whole of the pain process. A time will come when our molecular understanding will provide us with the means to unlock the secrets of pain. We have come a long way since the time of Descartes in our understanding of the neurophysiology and anatomy of pain, but we have a great deal more work to do if we are going to provide our patients with better remedies in the future. 
Sleep apnea and systemic hypertension: a causal association review. OBJECTIVE: To critically examine the causal association between sleep apnea syndrome and hypertension. METHODS: A retrospective systematic critique of five epidemiologic studies published in the English literature during 1978 to 1989 identified on Medline and manual literature searches. The evidence was evaluated using the standard observational criteria for causation: strength of association, consistency, dose-response relationship, temporal sequence, specificity, and biologic plausibility. RESULTS: We found evidence to support a causal association between sleep apnea syndrome and hypertension in consistency and specificity and some evidence to suggest a dose-response relationship. Review of the data dealing with the mechanisms important in the pathogenesis of sleep apnea and hypertension allowed us to advance several theories to provide support for biologic plausibility. CONCLUSION: We concluded that there is a positive association--relative risk estimate between 1.3 and 40--for sleep apnea syndrome and hypertension, but the risk association is unstable. Thus, we believe that there is insufficient data to justify doing polysomnography as part of the routine diagnostic work-up for patients with hypertension. 
Blunt abdominal trauma resulting in intestinal obstruction: when to operate? The overall approach to blunt abdominal trauma resulting in hematoma and intestinal obstruction has been variable and controversial. Recent reports recommend conservative nonoperative management. We reviewed six cases of duodenal and jejunal hematomas resulting from blunt trauma of which five resolved with nasogastric decompression and parenteral nutrition. The average hospital stay was 16 days (10-23 days), and total parenteral nutrition days were 9 days (4-16 days). Upper gastrointestinal series (UGI) demonstrated partial bowel obstruction in all five cases. In contrast, the sixth case was a restrained passenger who had evidence of complete bowel obstruction on UGI series, which failed to resolve after 18 days of conservative management. Laparotomy revealed jejunal and colonic strictures with fibrosis, which were successfully resected. We recommend that based on radiologic documentation of persistent high-grade obstruction, as well as the clinical course, patients whose obstructions do not resolve by 10 to 14 days ought to be further investigated and operative intervention considered. This approach may facilitate an earlier diagnosis of complications, reduce length of hospitalization and days on parenteral nutrition, as well as to expedite the proper management. 
Computed tomographic scan confirmation of paraprosthetic enteric fistula. Aortoenteric anastomotic fistulae and paraprosthetic graft infections are rare but devastating complications following aortic graft surgery. Although the incidence of these complications is reported to be less than 2%, the difficulty in diagnosis and management has led to high mortality rates and extensive morbidity. The majority of patients present with either groin infection or significant gastrointestinal tract bleeding. There is, however, a subset of patients with nonspecific clinical findings in whom routine studies are not diagnostic. Computed tomography was a useful adjunct to the diagnosis of retroperitoneal infection in these patients by demonstrating small collections of periaortic gas or "black dots." The presence of periaortic gas in each instance proved to be a specific sign of a paraprosthetic-enteric fistula, as opposed to a graft infection without intestinal communication. 
The controversy of heparin therapy as an adjunct to thrombolysis in acute myocardial infarction. Heparin is used routinely in the US as adjunct therapy for prevention of reocclusion after thrombolysis during acute myocardial infarction. A review of the literature shows controversy over the efficacy of heparin following thrombolysis. Both beneficial and a lack of beneficial effects have been reported with heparin. From a pathophysiologic viewpoint, there appears to be a need for full heparinization in the postlytic period because the residual stenosis is highly thrombogenic. However, optimal dose, time, and mode of heparin therapy has not been defined. Despite a lack of definitive data, it seems reasonable to administer intravenous heparin immediately after thrombolytic therapy to achieve a partial thromboplastin time 1.5-2.0 times control that is concurrent with an antiplatelet agent such as aspirin. These recommendations are consistent with the consensus opinion of the American College of Cardiology and the American Heart Association. 
Immunohistochemical analysis of amylase isoenzymes in thyroid cancer. The expression of amylase in various histological types of thyroid cancer was studied by an immunohistochemical technique, using a polyclonal antiamylase antiserum and two monoclonal antibodies specific for salivary and pancreatic-type amylases, respectively. Amylase was expressed in 21 of 24 (88%) thyroid cancers by polyclonal antiserum analysis. Analysis by monoclonal antibodies, however, showed that only 13 (54%) cases and three (13%) cases contained salivary-type and pancreatic-type amylases, respectively. Moreover, immunoreactivity for pancreatic-type amylase was detected only in medullary carcinoma; other histological types were positive for salivary-type amylase. These results show that thyroid cancer frequently expresses amylase, and suggest that the differences between amylase isoenzymes in thyroid cancer may correlate with those found between cellular origin of tumour. 
Lipid deposition and intimal stress and strain. A study in rats with aortic stenosis. These experiments were designed to study the topography of lipid deposition in the stenotic aorta of hypercholesterolemic rats, and to correlate it with flow conditions and intimal stresses and strains studied in a scale biophysical model and in a computer model. A 69% +/- 5% stenosis was produced with a U-shaped metal clip. One month to 8 months later, the aorta was studied en face by light microscopy after fixation and lipid staining. The intima in the throat of the stenosis was almost completely free of lipid, whereas symmetric lipid deposits occurred as bands just above and especially just below the stenosis; elsewhere lipid deposits appeared to be random. The flow data obtained from the scale model showed that the intima in the throat of the stenosis was subjected to an increase of as much as 20 times in shear stress, whereas the lipid deposits just above and just below the stenosis were associated with asymmetric flow conditions: the proximal area corresponded to a region of rapidly increasing shear stress, the distal area to a region of low to normal shear stress and separated flow. A finite element computer model based on the aortic deformations indicated that the endothelium at the inlet and outlet of the stenosis is subjected to a symmetric pattern of elevated stresses and strains. These results indicate that 1) the pattern of lipid deposition can not be adequately explained by a hypothesis based solely on flow conditions, and 2) lipid deposits can develop in areas of increased fluid shear stress, decreased fluid shear stress, and increased intimal strains. 
Angioplasty of long or tandem coronary artery lesions using a new longer balloon dilatation catheter: a comparative study. To determine whether or not a new 3 cm long angioplasty balloon was more effective in treatment of long (15-25 mm) or tandem (less than 25 mm overall length) coronary lesions, 44 consecutive patients with suitable lesions were alternately assigned to treatment with shorter, standard, 2 cm length, or long, 3 cm balloons. Primary success of PTCA was achieved in 95%. Those treated with long balloons required fewer inflations (3.3 +/- 1.5 vs. 5.7 +/- 2.1, P = .0001) and showed fewer moderate or severe intimal dissections of the lesions (4/22 vs. 12/22, p = .028). The use of 3 cm PTCA balloons in long or tandem lesions appears to be efficacious and less likely to cause dissections than shorter, 2 cm length devices. 
Invited review: electrodiagnostic assessment and monitoring of motor unit changes in disease. The motor unit characteristics change dynamically with disease. This is the basis for the use of neurophysiologic methods for diagnostic purposes and for long-term monitoring. A great variety of nerve conduction and EMG parameters are available to study the motor unit. They reflect different aspects of motor unit function. Therefore, the electromyographer must choose his technique and optimal parameters depending on the situation, type of condition, whether the purpose is diagnosis or monitoring, and so on. In this presentation the relationship between EMG parameters and physiologic and morphologic counterparts in some pathologic conditions will be discussed. 
Recurrent mild abruptio placentae occurring immediately after repeated electroconvulsive therapy in pregnancy. We present a case in which electroconvulsive therapy was performed repeatedly in pregnancy because of severe depression with psychotic features and failure of chemical treatment. Each electroconvulsive treatment was immediately followed by uterine contractions and active uterine bleeding, possibly representing recurrent abruptio placentae occurring in association with the treatment. Transient acute episodes of maternal hypertension between 180/90 and 190/100 mm Hg, documented within minutes after application of each electroconvulsive treatment, might explain the abruptio placentae manifested by active uterine bleeding and uterine hyperstimulation. 
Myocardial biochemical and hemodynamic adaptations to chronic tachycardia. The purpose was to determine the biochemical and hemodynamic adaptations of the myocardium to chronic tachycardia. Cardiac pacemakers were implanted in Yorkshire pigs and set at a rate of 180 beats/min for a period of 35-42 days. Animals were then anesthetized with pentobarbital sodium. Myocardial blood flow and hemodynamics were determined at three different heart rates (i.e., 120, 180, and 220 beats/min). Tissue samples were then taken for microsphere and biochemical analyses. Chronically paced hearts maintained better cardiac function and had consistently higher left ventricular blood flow with a higher endocardial-to-epicardial ratio. The activities of citrate synthase and 3-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase were 23 and 45% greater in the paced hearts, respectively. The sarcoplasmic reticulum adenosinetriphosphatase activity was 55% greater in the paced hearts, whereas the myosin adenosinetriphosphatase was the same as in the control hearts. Polyacrylamide gels of the ventricular myosin isoforms showed only the V3 type to be present in both the control and paced hearts. These findings show that the heart of a large mammal adapts to chronic tachycardia (i.e., 180 beats/min) by elevating the aerobic and calcium-sequestering capacities without altering its myosin type. 
Infantile Pompe's disease, lipid storage, and partial carnitine deficiency. A diagnosis of infantile Pompe's disease (glycogenosis type II) was made by muscle biopsy on a 6-month-old infant boy seen with hypotonia, weakness, and developmental regression. Histochemistry and electron microscopy revealed a vacuolar myopathy with massive glycoge accumulation associated with increased neutral lipid as demonstrated on Oil Red O reactions. Pleomorphic, hypertrophic mitochondria with distortion of cristae and electron-dense deposits within the matrix were identified. Acid alpha-1,4-glucosidase activity was absent but associated with increased neutral maltase activity and a variable compensatory rise in activity of other lysosomal enzymes. Biochemical studies demonstrated low free carnitine, normal acylcarnitine, increased activity of carnitine palmityl and acyl transferases, and other enzymes of beta-oxidation with the notable exception of low normal beta-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase activity. The explanation for the lipid accumulation is uncertain but is likely related to the combination of low carnitine concentration in muscle, low beta-hydroxyacyl CoA dehydrogenase, representing a rate limiting enzyme of beta-oxidation, and nonspecific defective mitochondrial function. 
Magnetic resonance images of brain stem infarct in periarteritis nodosa. A 35-year-old woman displayed unusual symptoms of progressive bulbar dysfunction. At necropsy, systemic necrotizing vasculitis and small pontine infarcts were demonstrated. The angiographic and magnetic resonance imaging findings are described. The latter investigation is a sensitive method for detecting such pontine lesions. To our knowledge, this case is the first report of magnetic resonance imaging findings of brain stem infarct in a patient with periarteritis nodosa. 
Double-blind study of Gabapentin in the treatment of partial seizures. Forty-three patients completed a double-blind, placebo-controlled study of Gabapentin (GBP) as add-on therapy in partial and secondarily generalized seizures. All patients were followed for an initial 3-month baseline period, after which they were randomly allocated to receive either a placebo or 900 or 1,200 mg/day GBP for 3 months. A statistically significant difference in seizure frequency from the baseline to the treatment phase was noted between patients receiving placebo and GBP 1,200 mg, in whom seizure frequency decreased 57%. The GBP dosage of 900 mg appeared to be ineffective. A close relationship was observed between the serum GBP concentrations and the GBP dosage based on the seizure frequency. Serum GBP concentrations greater than 2 micrograms/ml resulted in a lower frequency of seizures. The adverse effects were minor and consisted mainly of transient drowsiness. GBP appears to be effective in the treatment of partial epileptic seizures in a dosage-related manner. 
Conventional MR neuroangiography. MR angiography of the brain plays an important role in the diagnosis of vessel thrombosis and dissection, giant aneurysms, and occult vascular malformations. This essay highlights some of the features of the intra- and extracranial circulation that make conventional MR neuroangiography valuable in the demonstration of vascular anatomy and vascular disease. 
Effects of magnesium sulfate on pentylenetetrazol-induced status epilepticus. The use of magnesium sulfate (MgSO4) as an anticonvulsant is controversial. Status epilepticus was induced in 0.5% halothane-anesthetized Wistar rats with a threshold (90 mg/kg) or suprathreshold (200 mg/kg) dose of intravenous (i.v.) pentylenetetrazol (PTZ) under stereotactic hippocampal depth electrode monitoring. Fifteen minutes after seizure induction, the maximum hemodynamically tolerated dose of MgSO4 (10 mg/kg/min in 22 min) was administered i.v. MgSO4 was ineffective in altering seizure discharge. A subgroup of nine animals received hypertonic mannitol before MgSO4 to open the blood-brain barrier (BBB) to facilitate Mg2+ CNS penetration. Again MgSO4 was ineffective in attenuating epileptic activity. These results support the contention that MgSO4 is not an effective treatment for status epilepticus. We hypothesize that because Mg2+ blocks Ca2+ influx into the neuron through the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor-operated calcium channel in a voltage-dependent manner it would be ineffective in neurons that are continuously depolarizing as in status epilepticus. 
The neuropsychological sequelae of attempted hanging. Only one report on the neuropsychological sequelae of attempted hanging exists in the English language. Two cases of attempted hanging with subsequent isolated memory deficits are reported. Possible mechanisms for induction of this amnesia are discussed. In these two cases it is most likely that circulatory disturbance produced by the ligatures caused ischaemic hippocampal damage, which in turn led to amnesia. 
Valve extension with glutaraldehyde-preserved autologous pericardium. Results in mitral valve repair. Preliminary experimental studies in our laboratory have shown that autologous pericardium treated with glutaraldehyde prevents late deterioration and calcification of the tissue. For this reason, glutaraldehyde-treated autologous pericardium has been used in a series of 64 patients who underwent operations for leaflet extension of the mitral valve between 1980 and 1989. Ages ranged from 2.5 to 60 years (mean 19 +/- 15). The causes of mitral valve insufficiency were rheumatic fever (69%), bacterial endocarditis (17%), congenital (8%), endomyocardial fibrosis (4.5%), and trauma (1.5%). The autologous tissue was fixed in a 0.62% glutaraldehyde solution for 15 minutes and rinsed in saline for an additional 15 minutes. Patching techniques varied depending on the site and the extent of the lesion. Associated mitral valve repair techniques (Carpentier's techniques) were mandatory in all patients. The period of follow-up extended from 6 months to 9 years (mean 3.1 +/- 2.5 years). There were no operative deaths in this series, and there was one late death (2%). In the six patients (12%) who underwent reoperation, there has been no case of calcification of the pericardial patch. Postoperative mitral valve function was assessed by bidimensional color Doppler echocardiographic techniques. Mitral valve insufficiency was trivial or absent in 80% of the patients. This experience permits us to conclude that leaflet extension is a simple and safe technique in valve reconstruction, allowing repair of mitral valves that otherwise would need to be replaced. It permits use of an adult-size prosthetic ring in children. Glutaraldehyde-treated autologous pericardium is the material of choice for this type of repair. 
Unresectable pancreatic cancer: what is the optimal procedure? We retrospectively reviewed cases of pancreatic cancer to determine the benefit of various methods of biliary decompression and the role of prophylactic gastroenterostomy (GE) in management. Twenty-seven patients had only biliary bypass, and 26 had biliary bypass and GE. Operative mortality was similar for both groups (22% and 19%, respectively). The complication rates were almost identical (37% and 35%). Differences in operative mortality, incidence of cholangitis, and recurrence of jaundice were not statistically significant between patients having biliary decompression via the common bile duct or the gallbladder. Operative mortality associated with choledochoenterostomy was 33% versus 17% for cholecystoenterostomy. Gastric outlet obstruction developed in 5% of patients who did not have GE. We conclude that cholecystojejunostomy is an effective method of biliary bypass. Because its addition did not seem to increase operative morbidity or mortality, we advocate GE at the initial exploration to prevent gastric outlet obstruction. 
Two-dimensional echocardiographic assessment of intracardiac masses in infants and children. We studied six infants and children with intracardiac masses of different causes. The diagnosis was made noninvasively using two-dimensional echocardiography in all six patients. In five patients, surgical excision of the mass was undertaken with good results. Two-dimensional echocardiography is an excellent noninvasive diagnostic tool that allows the clinician to determine the size and location of intracardiac masses in infants and children. 
Changes in sizes of cortical and lower motor neurons in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. It has been suggested that the degeneration of lower motor neurons in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a transneuronal event, secondary to the loss of corticospinal and corticobulbar neurons. In an attempt to test this hypothesis, the cross-sectional areas of pyramidal cells in layer 5 of the foot and tongue areas of the precentral gyri were measured in 12 cases of the classical sporadic form of ALS, and in 10 control subjects. The areas of motor neurons in the hypoglossal nuclei and in the ventral horns of segment L4 of the spinal cord were also measured. The number of neurons per 20 microns section of ventral horn or hypoglossal nucleus provided a more reliable index of severity of lower motor neuron loss at the time of death than did a semiquantitative score derived from clinical observations. Cortical neurons and lower motor neurons were significantly smaller in the cases of ALS than in the controls. In the cortex this change included, but was not confined to, the largest neurons. These observations indicate that shrinkage precedes neuronal death. There was no correlation, positive or negative, between the numbers of surviving lower motor neurons and the mean sizes of pyramidal cells in layer 5 of the corresponding areas of the precentral gyri. The absence of such a correlation indicates that functionally related cortical and lower motor neurons probably degenerate independently, and not from a transsynaptic effect. Neuronal shrinkage has been observed in other diseases in which interconnected systems of neurons degenerate. The possible association of shrinkage with cytoskeletal degradation is discussed. 
Gastroesophageal reflux disease. Gastroesophageal reflux disease, usually manifested by frequent heartburn, occurs in approximately 10% of our adult population. The presence of a hiatal hernia is usually associated with, but does not necessarily cause, LES dysfunction, allowing acid reflux to produce esophageal and aerodigestive symptoms. The mucosa can be extensively damaged and, ultimately, a columnar lining, termed Barrett's esophagus, a premalignant condition, can develop. Treatment with H2-antagonists has been nirvana to some patients, but has proved only partially helpful to others. Adjunctive agents may increase relief and may help heal erosive esophagitis in some patients, but side effects and cost limit their use. Maintenance therapy with full doses is required, as the relapse rate for this chronic condition is high. Omeprazole temporarily heals almost everyone with otherwise resistant GERD, but it is currently used only on a short-term basis unless surgery, eminently successful in well-selected patients, is contraindicated. 
Multifocal independent epileptiform discharges in children: ictal correlates and surgical therapy. We obtained continuous EEG/video recordings on four children who had the interictal EEG pattern of multifocal independent epileptiform discharges (MIED). The prominent feature of their evaluation was the evidence that their clinical seizures appeared to be of focal origin; 42/44 seizures were manifested by "fencing postures." Three patients subsequently underwent epilepsy surgery: one focal resection of superior frontal-parietal cortex and two hemidecorticectomies. Seizure control improved in all three patients, and one patient is now seizure-free. Our patients differ from those previously reported in that they had a predominance of tonic seizures and had no history of infantile spasms or Lennox-Gastaut syndrome. Some patients, such as ours, with MIED may have clinical seizures of more focal origin than might be expected from their interictal EEG and, therefore, may benefit from resective epilepsy surgery. 
Reflex sympathetic dystrophy syndrome of the hand after placement of an arteriovenous graft for hemodialysis. Reflex sympathetic dystrophy syndrome (RSDS), a complex clinical syndrome characterized by pain and swelling of an affected extremity, is most commonly seen after trauma. We report the case of a woman with diabetes mellitus and chronic renal failure who presented with RSDS 5 months after placement of an arteriovenous (AV) graft for hemodialysis. The temporal relationship between RSDS and the vascular surgery suggests AV graft placement as the precipitating event for the development of RSDS. Treatment with systemic corticosteroids successfully relieved the patient's symptoms. We believe that RSDS should be included in the differential diagnosis of unexplained limb pain and swelling after AV graft placement. 
Pleomorphic melanoma mimicking sarcoma. Malignant melanoma may display a wide variety of unusual morphologic patterns that simulate unrelated neoplasms. The diagnostic approach to such complex and morphologically divergent lesions requires thorough and extensive scrutiny not only by routine light microscopy, but also by immunohistochemical and ultrastructural evaluation. We have reported the case of a patient with a mass on the heel exhibiting complex morphology that illustrates the value of such a systematic approach. 
Case of penetrating orbitocranial injury caused by wood. A case of retained intraorbital and intracerebral wooden foreign body following an orbitocranial penetrating injury through the lower lid of an adult is described. Initial failure to recognise the true nature of the injury led to intracerebral abscess formation and monocular blindness. Diagnosis and management of such cases are discussed. 
Percutaneous coronary excimer laser-assisted angioplasty: initial multicenter experience in 141 patients. Initial multicenter clinical experience with percutaneous coronary excimer laser-assisted angioplasty is described for 158 lesions in 141 patients. Using a xenon chloride (308 nm) excimer laser generator and 1.5 to 1.75 mm catheters, excimer laser angioplasty was attempted at 135 ns pulse width, 25 to 40 Hz repetition rate, 2 to 5 s laser delivery time and 30 to 60 mJ/mm2 energy fluence. Laser success (greater than 20% improvement in luminal diameter) was achieved in 138 (87%) of 158 lesions, with a reduction to less than 50% stenosis noted in 77 lesions (49%). Overall, laser-assisted balloon angioplasty success (less than 50% residual stenosis without major complication) was observed in 129 (91%) of 141 patients. Procedural complications (abrupt closure 1.3%, side branch occlusion 1.9%, intimal dissection 6.3%, embolization 1.3%, filling defect 1.3%, perforation 1.9% and spasm 1.3% and major complications (non-Q wave myocardial infarction 4.8%, emergency coronary bypass surgery 3.5% and death 0%) were infrequent and predominantly related to subsequent balloon angioplasty. In the early follow-up period (range 1 to 10 months, mean 7), 111 (79%) of the 141 patients remain asymptomatic, whereas symptoms have recurred in 27 (19%) and 3 patients (2.1%) have died. Thus, percutaneous coronary excimer laser angioplasty appears to be a feasible and safe procedure. Assessment of the impact of this technology on the acute complications of and restenosis rates after angioplasty awaits further follow-up analysis. 
Transient porphyrinemia in a liver transplant recipient. We report a case of acquired porphyrinemia in a liver transplant recipient. Thrombosis of the portal vein and hepatic artery led to massive necrosis of the patient's first donor liver, necessitating its removal. After an 18-hour anhepatic period, a second donor liver was transplanted. During this interval, the patient was warmed with an infrared heat lamp that emitted bright visible light. Following the anhepatic period, a photodistributed cutaneous erythema was noted. The level of total serum porphyrins during the anhepatic period was significantly elevated at 1.548 mumol/L (normal, less than 0.018 mumol/L). Fractionation showed that the levels of the hydrophobic porphyrins, coproporphyrin and protoporphyrin, were elevated, while the levels of the hydrophilic porphyrins remained normal. Following the successful second liver transplantation, the patient's porphyrin levels declined. This is the first reported case of acquired porphyrinemia in a liver transplant recipient. 
The bottom end. Handling of the perineal wound after abdominoperineal resection. There are a number of options for handling the perineal wound following abdominoperineal resection, including open packing or primary closure with suction drainage. Open packing has not been widely accepted, fearing that it may delay perineal wound healing. The purpose of this paper, therefore, was to retrospectively evaluate, the experience at Ferguson Hospital with abdominoperineal resection from 1977 through 1986. The study population consisted of 288 patients undergoing abdominoperineal resection for rectal adenocarcinoma. Forty-six patients had the perineal wound closed primarily and 242 had the perineal wound packed open. Ninety-four patients had the pelvic peritoneum left open and 194 underwent closure of the pelvic peritoneum. Overall operative mortality was 2.1 per cent, and there was no significant difference between primary closure and open packing of the perineal wound with respect to hospital stay, operating time, operative blood loss, perioperative mortality, incidence of postoperative bowel obstruction, incidence of postoperative complications, or average time for perineal wound healing. Therefore, it would appear that packing the perineal wound following abdominoperineal resection is a viable means of handling the bottom end. 
Chylothorax complicating right upper lobectomy. Chylothorax after pleuropulmonary surgery is unusual. We have described the case of a patient in whom this complication followed a right upper lobectomy. Early recognition is important to avoid potential morbidity and mortality. 
Syndrome of severe skin disease, eosinophilia, and dermatopathic lymphadenopathy in patients with HTLV-II complicating human immunodeficiency virus infection. Two intravenous drug users dually infected with human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) and human T-cell leukemia virus type II (HTLV-II) developed an unusual severe dermatitis characterized by progressive brawny induration, fissuring, and ulceration of the skin, with an associated CD8 cell infiltration in one patient. Both patients had persistent eosinophilia. Lymph node biopsy revealed dermatopathic lymphadenopathy, an unusual pathologic finding in HIV-1 infection but one seen in association with mycosis fungoides and other skin disorders. Two new isolates of HTLV-II virus were established from these patients and were identified as HTLV-II by Southern blotting. This type of skin disease and lymph node pathology has not been found in other intravenous drug users who have been infected with HIV-1 alone or in patients in other risk groups for HIV-1 infection. HTLV-II may play a role in this unique new disease pattern in patients infected with HIV-1. 
Hypoglossal-facial nerve interpositional-jump graft for facial reanimation without tongue atrophy. The hemitongue paralysis that occurs as a result of a classic hypoglossal-facial nerve crossover procedure can result in profound functional deficits in speech, mastication, and swallowing. The procedure is not an option in patients with bilateral facial paralysis or those at risk for combined cranial nerve deficits. To address some of the drawbacks and limitations of this classic procedure, we developed the hypoglossal-facial nerve interpositional jump graft (12-7 jump graft) procedure. This procedure involves interposing a nerve graft between a partially severed but functionally intact twelfth cranial nerve and the degenerated seventh cranial nerve, and is often combined with other reanimation procedures. To date, we have performed 33 12-7 jump graft procedures in 30 patients (three were treated for bilateral facial paralysis); this report describes the procedure and its indications, and details the results of 23 procedures performed in 20 patients for whom 24-month follow-up data are available. Twelfth nerve deficits occurred in only three patients in this report. Recovery of facial function began between 3 and 24 months postoperatively. Facial tone and symmetry were achieved in every patient, no patient had significant mass movement, and 13 patients (two of whom were treated for bilateral facial paralysis) had excellent and three had superb restoration of facial movement. These results show the 12-7 jump graft to be a valuable adjunct for facial reanimation in selected patients. 
Traumatic rupture of the stomach after Heimlich maneuver. Fatal complications following the performance of the Heimlich maneuver have been reported. A 76-year-old woman presented to the emergency department with signs of respiratory distress, abdominal pain and distension one day after airway obstruction and subsequent resuscitation. Despite successful immediate laparotomy and repair of a ruptured stomach, she later succumbed to the sequelae of aspiration of gastric contents and dehiscence of the gastric tear. This is the 4th case of stomach rupture and the 7th reported fatal complication following the Heimlich maneuver. It is recommended that persons who undergo the Heimlich maneuver be examined and observed by a physician, as soon as possible, to rule out complications. 
A new mouse mutant with progressive motor neuronopathy. A new autosomal-recessive mouse mutant with progressive motor neuronopathy (pmn) is described. Homozygotes develop paralysis of the hindlimbs during the third week of life. Soon thereafter the forelimbs also become weak, and all mice die six to seven weeks after birth. Heterozygotes are normal. Skeletal muscles show neurogenic atrophy without histological signs of reinnervation. Axonal degeneration apparently starts at the endplates and is prominent in the sciatic nerve and its branches and the phrenic nerve. Axonal sprouts are abundant. There is no evidence of demyelination, and unaffected nerve fibers are normally myelinated. Sensory axons are spared. Almost all distal motor axons have disappeared in four to five weeks after birth. Ventral nerve roots show a reduced diameter of the largest fibers but no fiber deficits. The ventral horn cells show slight chromatolysis. The corticospinal tract is normal, but in terminally ill animals the fasciculus gracilis, the rubrospinal tract and possibly also reticulospinal fibers degenerate. The brain is histologically normal. The disease manifests itself in a dying-back fashion in the distal portion of the motor neurons and may represent an animal model of hereditary motor neuron diseases in man. 
Salmonella myonecrosis in a patient with diabetes mellitus. Bacterial myonecrosis is a medical and surgical emergency and prompt surgical intervention is critically important. A variety of microorganisms have been isolated from patients with necrotizing soft-tissue infections. These infections are frequently polymicrobial in etiology, but occasionally a single microorganism is isolated. This report describes a case of crepitant myonecrosis from infection with Salmonella serogroup B. 
Retinal thickness analysis for quantitative assessment of diabetic macular edema. Diabetic macular edema is a major cause of vision loss and is evaluated with qualitative or semiquantitative techniques. A new quantitative method for assessment of macular edema using retinal thickness analysis was applied to 19 patients with diabetic macular edema. Foveal thickening was frequently coupled with poor visual acuity. Slit-lamp biomicroscopy and stereophotography detected 80% and 78% of local areas of thickening, respectively, but failed to detect locations with average thicknesses of 1.5 and 1.6 times normal, respectively. Fluorescein leakage on angiography was generally associated with retinal thickening, but locations with similar degrees of leakage had widely varying retinal thickening. Fluorescein leakage in the posterior vitreous correlated poorly with the degree of foveal thickening. These results indicate that quantitative measurement of retinal thickness may become useful in the management of diabetic patients with macular edema. 
Treatment of acute migraine with subcutaneous sumatriptan. Sumatriptan succinate, a 5-HT1D receptor agonist, constricts human cranial arteries. Two parallel-group trials for treatment of acute migraines were conducted in the United States. Adult patients were randomized and given either 6 mg of sumatriptan succinate subcutaneously (n = 734) or placebo (n = 370). At 1 hour, sumatriptan was significantly more effective than placebo in reducing moderate or severe headache pain to mild or no pain (70% vs 22%), in completely relieving headaches (49% vs 9%), and in improving clinical disability (76% vs 34%). Sumatriptan also reduced nausea and photophobia significantly better than placebo. Patients with residual migraines received another injection; those who had originally received sumatriptan received either a second active injection (n = 187) or placebo (n = 178), while those who had received placebo received a second placebo injection (n = 335). Statistical evidence for benefit of second sumatriptan injection is absent. Adverse events associated with sumatriptan were tingling, dizziness, warm-hot sensations, and injection-site reactions. Sumatriptan is effective and well tolerated in patients with acute migraine. 
The clinical and endocrine outcome to trans-sphenoidal microsurgery of nonsecreting pituitary adenomas. From 1962 to 1987, 126 patients underwent trans-sphenoidal surgery for primary treatment of pituitary adenomas unassociated with clinical or biochemical evidence of hormonal overproduction. There were 73 male and 53 female patients (mean age, 50 +/- 12 years). Before surgery, 56% of the patients (70 of 124) had headaches, 74% (94 of 126) had deterioration of vision, and 12% (15 of 126) had ophthalmoplegia. Endocrine evaluation revealed the presence of hypogonadism in 75% (87 of 115), adrenal insufficiency in 36% (46 of 126), and hypothyroidism in 18% (21 of 122). Plasma prolactin was increased in 65% (56 of 86) with a mean level of 39 +/- 14 micrograms/l (normal, 3 to 20 micrograms/l). Radiologic enlargement of the sella turcica was documented in all cases: 67% (84 of 126) had enclosed and 33% (42 of 126) had invasive adenomas. After surgery, vision was normalized or improved in 75% (71 of 94) of the patients. Thyroid, adrenal, and gonadal functions were improved in 14% (three of 22), 41% (19 of 46), 11% (ten of 87), were unchanged in 82% (100 of 122), 77% (97 of 126), 89% (102 of 115), and worsened in 15% (19 of 22), 8% (ten of 126), 3% (102 of 115), respectively. Permanent diabetes insipidus occurred in 5% (seven of 126). Two patients died during the immediate postoperative period. The recurrence rate in patients with a mean follow-up of 6.4 +/- 4.2 years was 21% (15 of 71). These data indicate that trans-sphenoidal microsurgery is an effective and safe initial treatment for patients with nonsecreting pituitary adenoma and may reverse hypopituitarism. 
Otologic sequelae after pneumococcal meningitis: a survey of 164 consecutive cases with a follow-up of 94 survivors. As part of a comprehensive study on sequelae after pneumococcal meningitis, 94 of 111 consecutive survivors were re-examined 4 to 16 years after discharge. Twenty-three patients had otological sequelae after pneumococcal meningitis. In these patients, 17 had hearing losses, 7 had tinnitus, 9 had vertigo, 13 had vestibular areflexia, 4 had loss of smell, and 3 had loss of taste. Among the patients with hearing loss, 4 were bilaterally deaf, 6 were unilaterally deaf, and 2 had mild and 5 had slight hearing losses. From correlations with extensive data from the medical records, preadmission antibiotic treatment appeared to protect from acousticovestibular damage. Purulent otitis media and otosurgical intervention did not correlate to the fatality rate or the development of sequelae. Acute purulent otitis media appeared as a concomitant manifestation, rather than the focus of pneumococcal meningitis. 
Fibrocystic disease of the breast in premenopausal women: histohormonal correlation and response to luteinizing hormone releasing hormone analog treatment. Sixty-six patients with fibrocystic mastopathy were enrolled in the trial after being selected according to clinical, radioultrasonographic, and histologic criteria. No characteristic hormonal profile was noted in most patients (52%). Estrogen receptors or progesterone receptors, or both, were found in 57% of patients. Hormone receptor levels were correlated with atypical proliferative mastopathy (87.5%). Mastopathy was associated with a uterine fibroma or a fibromatous uterus in 73% of cases. All patients received intramuscular injections of a sustained delivery system (microcapsules) of luteinizing hormone releasing hormone agonist [D-Trp6]-LHRH, Ipsen-Biotech, Paris) for 3 to 6 months. In case of partial response at 3 months, an antiestrogen (tamoxifen, 40 mg/day, for estrogen receptor-predominant lesions) or a progestin (cyproterone acetate, 50 mg/day, for progesterone receptor-predominant lesions) was added to the luteinizing hormone releasing hormone agonist. A complete response was observed in more than half of the patients (n = 35, 53%) treated by [D-Trp6]-LHRH alone (n = 29) or associated with tamoxifen (n = 4) or cyproterone acetate (n = 2). A significant partial response was observed in 30 other patients (45%). Additionally, half of them received inhibitory drugs. The best responses were seen with cyst reformation (complete response, 100%) and fibrous block. Clinical responses to treatment with [D-Trp6]-LHRH alone were independent of hormone receptor status, but synergistic effects occurred with concomitant use of the corresponding inhibitory drugs. We conclude that chronic mastopathy, particularly when associated with uterine fibroma, can be successfully treated by luteinizing hormone releasing hormone analogs in premenopausal women. 
Median lip fissure: etiology and suggested treatment. In a prospective study of 20 patients with median lip fissure, pedigrees were obtained. A hereditary predisposition for weakness in the first branchial arch fusion seems to exist. In some persons, more often in males than in females, this weakness eventually leads to development of a median lip fissure. The fissure becomes symptomatic when it is infected. In 10 patients the fissure was excised; in the other 10 patients excision was done in combination with a Z-plasty of the center of the lesion. The prognosis with the latter operation was superior to that with the former. 
Patient selection for mechanical circulatory support as a bridge to cardiac transplantation. Between 7/87 and 9/90 thirty-four patients underwent total artificial heart (Berlin Heart) (n = 2) or biventricular assist device (Berlin Heart) (n = 32) implantation as a bridge to cardiac transplantation. The time of mechanical support ranged from 2 to 60 days, for a mean of 19.2 days. Twenty-three patients received heart transplants, with 74% 30-day survival and 52% long-term survival. Implantation of a mechanical support system became indicated in those patients whose hemodynamic and clinical condition deteriorated despite treatment with enoximone in addition to maximal sympathomimetic medication. The strategy to administer enoximone routinely was the result of a prospective study on 24 pretransplant patients in whom enoximone therapy reduced the need for mechanical assistance by 62%. At the time of device implantation shock-related organ impairment such as cerebral, renal, hepatic, and respiratory dysfunction was present in 62% of patients. In addition, 7 patients had pneumonia. During mechanical support complete recovery of end-organ failure and resolution of pneumonia was observed in the majority of patients. The results indicate that end-organ dysfunction per se should not be considered a contraindication to mechanical circulatory support as a bridge to cardiac transplantation. However, further clinical investigations are needed to identify predictive indicators of irreversible organ damage. 
Tissue plasminogen activator-associated lingual artery hemorrhage. Reported is the case of a patient with vertebrobasilar artery ischemia who received tissue plasminogen activator with resulting hemorrhage into the tongue and nearly exsanguinating hemorrhage from a branch of the lingual artery. Suggestions for immediate management of the hemorrhage as well as prevention are presented. As the use of thrombolytic agents increases and the list of their indications expands, unusual life-threatening hemorrhagic problems other than gastrointestinal or intracranial bleeding will be seen, and management decisions may be life saving. 
A practical approach to laparoscopic cholecystectomy. A prospective study of 500 consecutive cholecystectomies was initiated with the introduction of laparoscopic cholecystectomy. Laparoscopic cholecystectomy was attempted in 96% of patients presenting with primary gallbladder disease and was completed in 95%. There were no deaths or bile duct injuries. Two patients undergoing laparoscopic cholecystectomy were transfused for postoperative bleeding, and only one patient required reoperation for any reason. A prospective study showed reduced operating time (20 minutes) and patient charges ($546) using electrosurgical dissection compared with laser. Reusable trocars were used without any associated injury or morbidity. An effective strategy for selective cholangiography was developed based on patient history, liver enzymes, and common duct diameter. In conclusion, laparoscopic cholecystectomy appears to be a safe operation. The cost-effectiveness of laparoscopic cholecystectomy can be enhanced ($1,271) with no loss of patient benefit using the combination of electrosurgery, reusable trocars, and selective cholangiograms in low-risk patients. 
Mammographically detected breast cancer. Results with conservative surgery and radiation therapy. At Yale-New Haven Hospital (New Haven, CT) treatment of early stage breast cancer with conservative surgery and radiation therapy (CS & RT) has been utilized with increasing frequency since the 1960s. The authors have reviewed their experience with specific reference to the outcome of those patients whose breast cancer was detected on routine screening mammography. To achieve adequate follow-up, only patients treated before December 1984 are included in this analysis. Of 438 patients treated with CS & RT before December 1984, a total of 41 patients (9%) had nonpalpable lesions detected on routine screening mammography and were treated with CS & RT to the intact breast. Only two patients received adjuvant hormonal therapy and no patients received adjuvant systemic therapy. There has been only one breast failure and one death due to cancer in this group of patients resulting in actuarial survival and breast recurrence-free rates of 100% at 5 years and 92% at 10 years. These results stress the importance of routine screening mammography and raise questions regarding the role of adjuvant systemic therapy in this selected group of patients. 
Inhibition of Moloney murine leukemia virus-induced leukemia in transgenic mice expressing antisense RNA complementary to the retroviral packaging sequences. Recombinant plasmids pLP psi as and pCP psi as were constructed by positioning the Moloney murine leukemia virus (M-MuLV) proviral packaging (psi) sequences in reverse orientation under the transcriptional regulation of lymphotropic promoter/regulatory elements from the M-MuLV long terminal repeat or the cytomegalovirus immediate-early region. Linear fragments containing the antisense psi and the appropriate transcriptional regulatory sequences from these plasmids were introduced into the mouse germ line by zygote microinjection. The chromosomal integration, germ-line transmission, and lymphocyte-directed expression of the antisense psi RNA were confirmed. Control (nontransgenic) and transgenic mice containing either the pLP psi as or the pCP psi as sequences were infected with M-MuLV on the day of birth and assayed for signs of leukemia between 12 and 14 weeks of age with standard assay procedures. While 31% (11 of 36) of the control, nontransgenic, mice developed leukemia, none of the antisense psi transgenic mice developed any symptoms of leukemia. The pCP psi as sequences were also introduced into mouse NIH 3T3 cells and stably transformed cell lines were isolated. When infected with M-MuLV these cells were shown to produce virus devoid of packaged viral RNA. 
Mass screening in Japan increased the detection of infants with neuroblastoma without a decrease in cases in older children. Analysis of data from the Kanto-Ko-Shin-Etsu Branch of the Japan Children's Cancer Registry revealed that mass screening for neuroblastoma increased the detection of cases in infants younger than 1 year from about 25% before screening to about 50%, and the percentage of neuroblastomas among all pediatric cancers almost doubled, from approximately 10% to 19.3%. However, when the cases found on screening were subtracted, the numbers after the onset of mass screening were similar to those before screening. It is likely that neuroblastoma mass screening has identified a unique type of tumor, which may not be recognized without mass screening, rather than that it has contributed to the earlier diagnosis of tumors in older children. 
Usefulness of flecainide for prevention of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation and flutter. Danish-Norwegian Flecainide Multicenter Study Group. To evaluate the efficacy of flecainide acetate in the prevention of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation and flutter, 43 patients (23 men) (mean age 53 years) were randomized blindly to receive either placebo or 150 mg of flecainide twice per day for consecutive periods of 3 months. Attacks were verified by a minielectrocardiogram event recorder. If intolerable symptoms developed, the protocol allowed patients to cross over between treatments before the end of the first 3-month period. Four patients crossed over prematurely, between 1 week and 1 month, and 15 between 1 month and 3 months. The remaining 24 patients completed both 3-month periods. In all 3 treatment intervals, there was a significant reduction in the number of attacks during flecainide treatment (p less than 0.002). Complete suppression was seen in 15 of 43 patients (35%) treated with flecainide for 1 week, in 18 of 39 (46%) treated for 1 month and in 12 of 24 (50%) completing all 3 months in each period. Adverse effects were reported in 32 of the 43 patients (74%) treated with flecainide, but only 2 were withdrawals. One patient died suddenly. In comparison, 3 of 43 patients (7%) reported adverse effects in the placebo group. In conclusion, flecainide significantly suppressed the number of attacks of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation and flutter. Adverse effects were frequent but were mostly tolerable. 
Plasma renin activity in renal transplant patients with hypertension. Chronic renal allograft rejection (CR) is the major cause of graft loss after 1 year following transplantation. Hypertension (HTN) and proteinuria (Up) are the hallmarks of this immunologic allograft response. Over 1 year, 23 patients posttransplantation and with HTN (diastolic greater than 95 mm Hg) were examined. Serial serum creatinine (Scr), Up, urine creatinine (Ucr), and resting and enalapril challenged (EC) plasma renin activity (PRA) were all determined. Renal artery stenosis was excluded by noninvasive imaging. Of the 23 patients, eight eventually lost their renal allografts, while 15 maintained satisfactory renal function (Scr less than 2.5). Results of this study show that: 1) worsening renal function (RF) increases EC reactivity; 2) the presence of proteinuria is not itself related to increase in EC activity; 3) renin before and after EC was higher (P = .06) in the allograft loss group. In this study, patients with high PRA represent the highest EC responses. Therefore, they display not macrovascular lesions, but microvascular intrarenal disease; this defect is most likely secondary to chronic immunologic insult. 
Gastrointestinal complications in 4473 patients who underwent cardiopulmonary bypass surgery. Thirty-nine gastrointestinal complications occurred in 35 of 4473 patients (0.78 per cent) who underwent surgery involving cardiopulmonary bypass during an 8-year period. The mortality rate when one of these complications occurred was 22 (63 per cent) representing 11.5 per cent of the 191 deaths from all causes in the series. The relative risk of developing a gastrointestinal complication was 1:249 when the heart was not opened, 1:66 when it was and 1:5 after cardiac transplantation. Gastrointestinal bleeding (n = 20) was the most common complication of whom nine (45 per cent) died, followed by intestinal infarction (n = 12) with eight (67 per cent) deaths and acute pancreatitis (n = 6) all of whom died. There was one death after surgery for gastrointestinal bleeding (n = 7). No patient survived bowel infarction without operation but resection was possible in five of the eight who underwent surgery, four of whom survived. The results demonstrate that surgical intervention is not associated with undue mortality but inappropriate conservative therapy is poorly tolerated in this high-risk group. 
Second operation after the failure of previous resection for epilepsy. We present our surgical experience with second operations in 15 patients with recurrent intractable partial seizures after resection for epilepsy. The interval from the first operation until the first recurrence of seizures ranged from 1 day to 7 months (mean, 62 days). The interval between the first and second operations ranged from 3 months to 12 years (mean, 38 months). Detailed video-electroencephalographic interictal and ictal recording was performed in all patients (invasive electrodes were used in 11 patients). Ictal onset was shown to be remote from the zone of previous resection in 3 of 15 cases (all 3 extratemporal and in the ipsilateral hemisphere). Recurrent seizures arose from the area of previous extratemporal resection in 2 of 15 patients, and from the area of previous temporal resection in 10 of 15 patients. Both cases of extratemporal recurrences and 3 of the 10 cases of temporal lobe recurrences in the area of previous resection were associated with residual unresected structural lesion. Of the 10 patients with local temporal recurrence, 6 had proven epileptogenicity in the residual mesial structures, and 4 had residual epileptogenicity in the unresected lateral temporal lobe. The patients have been monitored for 8 to 82 months (mean, 18 months) after the second operation: 7 patients (47%) have remained seizure-free and another 5 (33%) have achieved a reduction in seizure frequency of more than 90%. There was no mortality or significant morbidity in this series. We conclude that the extent and distribution of residual epileptogenicity after failed epilepsy surgery are highly variable. 
Low-back pain and disk degeneration in children: a case-control MR imaging study. Thirty-nine 15-year-old children with low-back pain (LBP) and 39 asymptomatic control children were selected from a population of 1,503 children of the same age for a magnetic resonance imaging study of the lumbar spine. Subjects with LBP were matched with control subjects by age, sex, and school class. Disk degeneration (DD) was present in 15 (38%) of the children with LBP and in 10 (26%) of the control subjects. Lumbar degeneration was most frequently associated with disk protrusion and Scheuermann-type changes. Of assessed structural abnormalities (disk protrusion, Scheuermann-type changes, transitional vertebra, and disk space narrowing), only disk protrusion was more common in children of the LBP group than in control subjects. The authors conclude that DD is a frequent finding among children with LBP at the age of 15 years. Asymptomatic (possibly physiologic) DD also is frequently found in children of this age. Whether DD associated with structural changes predisposes to low-back disorders can be confirmed only by means of a longitudinal follow-up study. 
In vivo phosphorus-31 magnetic resonance spectroscopy of normal and pathological breast tissues. In vivo phosphorus-31 magnetic resonance spectroscopy, at 1.5 T, in addition to magnetic resonance imaging and mammography, was performed on the breast tissue of 59 subjects, using a 40 mm or 80 mm surface coil for spectral localization. The patients were divided into three groups: Group 1, 46 control subjects; Group 2, nine patients with breast carcinoma; Group 3, four patients with benign breast disease. The relationship of age, menopausal status, breast size and pattern, use of contraceptive pill and history of breast disease to spectral characteristics of breast tissue was examined for the control group. In multivariate analysis, only menopausal status and age were found to be significantly related to tissue biochemistry. Pre-menopausal women had reduced phosphocreatine (PCr) (%) (p = 0.02), and increased phosphomonoesters (PMEs) and beta-nucleotide triphosphate (beta-NTP) (%) (p = 0.05), while the fat-to-water ratio was higher in older women (p = 0.02). No significant differences were identified between the control subjects and the patients with benign breast disease. When spectra from patients with breast carcinoma were compared with an age-matched volunteer group, alpha- and gamma-NTP (%) were found to be higher in the cancer tissue (p less than 0.01 and p = 0.01, respectively), while PCr (%) was reduced (p less than 0.01). The ratio beta-NTP:PCr was higher in the carcinoma group of patients (p less than 0.05). In vivo phosphorus-31 magnetic resonance spectroscopy is a non-invasive examination which may prove useful in the early differentiation of malignant breast disease from normal and benign conditions. 
Preservation of urine voiding and sexual function after rectal cancer surgery In order to decrease the urinary and sexual morbidity which follows radical pelvic lymphadenectomy for rectal cancer, we began selective preservation of the pelvic autonomic nerves. Between 1985 and 1987, 134 patients with rectal cancer underwent a curative resection (52 abdominoperineal resections, 82 sphincter-saving resections) with extended pelvic lymphadenectomy and selective pelvic autonomic nerve preservation (PANP). PANP was classified into five degrees depending on the extent of pelvic dissection. First-degree PANP indicates complete preservation of the nerves; second-degree PANP indicates destruction of the hypogastric plexus: third-degree PANP indicates partial preservation of the pelvic autonomic plexus; fourth-degree PANP indicates bilateral or unilateral preservation of only the fourth pelvic parasympathetic nerve; and fifth-degree PANP indicates complete destruction of the pelvic autonomic nerves. Most patients with first-degree PANP were able to spontaneously void 7-10 days following the operation. However, 78 percent (28/36) of patients with fifth-degree PANP had not regained bladder sensation by the third postoperative week and were discharged with an indwelling catheter; 58 percent (21/36) had not regained bladder sensation by the 60th postoperative day. The cystometric data indicate a progressive decline in bladder sensation and function with increasingly extensive pelvic dissection. However, preservation of only the fourth parasympathetic nerve (fourth-degree PANP) resulted in partial sparing of bladder sensation and voiding function. Evaluation of sexual function in males under 60 years of age revealed that only 31 percent (12/39) recovered erectile function and only 19 percent (6/39) recovered normal ejaculatory function in the first postoperative year. Most of these patients had complete preservation of their pelvic autonomic plexus (i.e., first-degree PANP). Four patients with partial PANP have recovered erectile function. Complete PANP is the best way to prevent urinary and sexual morbidity after rectal resection. The opposing goals of maximizing the chance for cure and minimizing morbidity must be individualized and balanced in each patient. Our data demonstrate that it is now possible to perform radical pelvic lymphadenectomy in the majority of patients with advanced rectal cancer with a minimum of voiding dysfunction. Preservation of sexual function in males is more difficult and depends on complete PANP and, as such, should be restricted to the group of patients with Dukes' A and B carcinomas. 
Expression of perforin in infiltrating cells in murine hearts with acute myocarditis caused by coxsackievirus B3. BACKGROUND. Cell-mediated autoimmunity has been strongly implicated in the pathogenesis of viral myocarditis. METHODS AND RESULTS. Using a murine model of acute myocarditis caused by coxsackievirus B3, we analyzed the phenotypes and morphology of the infiltrating cells in the hearts by immunofluorescence and electron microscopy. We also examined the expression of a cytolytic factor, perforin, in the infiltrating cells by immunoperoxidase and in situ hybridization. We found that the dominant population of the infiltrating cells were asialo GM1 positive, were negative for T-cell markers, and had electron-dense cytoplasmic granules, which is consistent with a morphology of large granular lymphocytes. Perforin was found in the cytoplasmic granules of the infiltrating cells expressing perforin messenger RNA. These findings provide for the first time the direct evidence that the first wave of cell infiltration in hearts mainly consists of killer cells and strongly suggests that perforin plays, in part, an important role in myocardial cell damage involved in acute viral myocarditis. T-helper cells and cytotoxic T lymphocytes made up the second wave of cell infiltration. CONCLUSIONS. As we previously reported, the expression of major histocompatibility complex class I antigen on cardiac myocytes induced by the infiltrating cells, such as killer cells, may facilitate the interaction between cardiac myocytes and cytotoxic T lymphocytes, and may lead to further myocardial cell damage in a later phase. 
Management of foreskin problems. One hundred consecutive cases of boys with foreskin problems referred to local paediatric surgeons in the Edinburgh area were studied. Fifty five underwent circumcision and the remainder were managed more conservatively with or without the use of local or general anaesthetic. Although sometimes avoiding general anaesthetic, the more conservative methods involved more frequent visits to the clinic, a larger number of complications, and a longer follow up period. Despite the vogue for conservatism, circumcision still has an important part to play in the management of troublesome foreskins in children. 
Metabolic markers of stress-induced myocardial ischemia. The human heart in the fasting state extracts free fatty acids (FFA), glucose, lactate, pyruvate, and ketones from circulating blood. The utilization of FFA accounts for most of the oxygen consumed and energy produced at rest. Patients with angiographically demonstrable coronary artery disease and stable angina pectoris have a resting myocardial metabolism similar to that of normal individuals. During atrial pacing in normal persons, there is a significant enhancement of glucose uptake but that of FFA is unchanged, and the oxidation of carbohydrates accounts for more than 60% of the energy produced. In patients with stable angina, myocardial perfusion becomes regionally inadequate during stress. Despite the increase of myocardial glucose utilization, carbohydrate oxidation is negligible. Pyruvate will not be oxidized but in the presence of increased amounts of reduced coenzymes will be reduced to lactate. In addition, a greater amount of alanine will be released by the myocardium through the transamination of pyruvate, with a concomitantly greater uptake of glutamate that serves as the NH2 donor. In addition, glutamate may be used as an anaerobic fuel through conversion to succinate coupled with GTP formation. Although coronary hemodynamics, including myocardial perfusion, return to baseline within a few minutes after stress, a longer time course is needed for myocardial metabolism to become normal. In particular, myocardial utilization of exogenous glucose remains higher well after the normalization of hemodynamic parameters. This is more pronounced in postischemic myocardium, but it also occurs in nonischemic muscle, and glucose is presumably used for rebuilding glycogen stores that were depleted during ischemia. 
Risk factors in relation to postoperative complications and mortality after total gastrectomy in aged patients. To clarify the risk factors contributing to postoperative complications in elderly patients undergoing total gastrectomy, 84 patients with primary gastric cancer were evaluated. Twenty-seven patients were older than 65 years of age; they had much more preoperative cardiac (P = 0.00003), respiratory (P = 0.0008), and multiorgan impairment (P = 0.009) than did the control group (age less than 65 yrs). Although overall morbidities (44.4% vs. 19.2%; P = 0.01) and overall septic complication rates (33.3% vs. 12.2%; P = 0.02) were higher in aged patients, no significant differences between the two groups were found in the incidence of major surgical complications (18.5% in aged patients vs. 10.5% in control groups; P = NS), serious septic (sepsis score greater than 10) complications (18.5% vs. 7.0%; P = NS) and hospital mortalities (11.1% vs. 3.5%; P = NS). In older patients the occurrence of multiorgan impairment and malnutrition was significantly related to postoperative complication rates. These results suggest that the degree of organ impairment rather than age is predictive of postoperative difficulty and should be used in assessing preoperative risk. 
Total occlusion of the circumflex artery with collateral supply from the conus artery. The conus artery has long been recognized as an important source of collateral blood supply to a significantly diseased left anterior descending artery. This artery which arises 50% of the time from a separate orifice in the right sinus of Valsalva may also provide collateral circulation to a diseased right coronary artery. To date, there have been no reported instances of the conus artery supplying collateral flow to a totally occluded circumflex artery. In this report we describe such a case in a patient with severe three vessel disease. The implications of such a finding in patient management are also discussed. 
Common bile duct distensibility after cholecystectomy. To assess the possibility of common bile duct distensibility after cholecystectomy, we made a retrospective study of patients who had ultrasonography and endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP). The study comprised 52 patients without extrahepatic biliary obstruction; 19 had had cholecystectomy, 18 of whom complained of biliary colic similar to that they had had originally. The other 33 patients had intact, well visualized gallbladders; 15 of these patients had pain in the right upper quadrant or epigastrium, but none had chronic pancreatitis. The average diameter of the common bile duct at its widest point by ultrasonography was 4.8 mm (range, 4.0 to 9.0 mm) in the 33 patients with intact gallbladders, and 5.7 mm (range, 4.0 to 8.0 mm) in the 19 patients who had had cholecystectomy. The diameter by ERCP was 4.4 mm (range, 2.9 to 6.3 mm) in the patients with intact gallbladders, and 11.17 mm (range, 6.9 to 14.7 mm) in the patients who had had cholecystectomy. In each patient who had had cholecystectomy the diameter as measured by ERCP was larger than it appeared by ultrasonography. The results suggest that the common bile duct is distensible, and that this distensibility may be related to the postcholecystectomy syndrome. 
Can colon cancer incidence and death rates be reduced with calcium and vitamin D? It was proposed in 1980 that vitamin D and calcium could reduce the risk of colon cancer. This assertion was based on the decreasing gradient of mortality rates from north to south, suggesting a mechanism related to a favorable influence of ultraviolet-induced vitamin D metabolites on metabolism of calcium. A 19-y prospective study of 1954 Chicago men found that a dietary intake of greater than 3.75 micrograms vitamin D/d was associated with a 50% reduction in the incidence of colorectal cancer, whereas an intake of greater than or equal to 1200 mg Ca/d was associated with a 75% reduction. Clinical and laboratory studies further support these findings. A nested case-control study based on serum drawn from a cohort of 25,620 individuals reported that moderately elevated concentrations of 25-hydroxyvitamin D, in the range 65-100 nmol/L, were associated with large reductions (P less than 0.05) in the incidence of colorectal cancer. 
Selective contraindications based on multivariate analysis for operative cholangiography in biliary lithiasis. This study was done to select patients with a low risk of common bile duct (CBD) stones in whom operative cholangiography could be avoided. Operative cholangiography was performed upon 511 patients. Two different groups of patients were identified--patients with CBD stones visualized by CBD exploration (n = 90) and patients with no CBD stones at the time of operative cholangiography (n = 421). Multivariate analysis (stepwise logistic regression) showed that five variables were correlated with the presence of CBD stones--size of CBD equal to or greater than 12 millimeters, gallstones equal to or less than 10 millimeters, advanced age, chronic or acute cholecystitis and past history of biliary colic. Using a scoring system, a group of patients with a low risk (less than 2 percent) of CBD stones could be easily determined. In this group of patients, operative cholangiography may be avoided. 
A case for early surgery in native left-sided endocarditis complicated by heart failure: results in 203 patients From January 1982 to December 1988, 203 consecutive patients were selected for early valve replacement (mean 10 days from time of admission) if they had clinical evidence of native valve endocarditis with 1) vegetations on echocardiography, 2) severe valvular lesions, and 3) heart failure. Surgery was performed within 7 days of admission in 56% of patients and was done urgently because of hemodynamic deterioration in 108 (53%). All vegetations were identified by echocardiography and confirmed macroscopically at surgery. One hundred ten patients had isolated aortic valve infection, 50 had isolated mitral valve infection (p less than 0.05 for aortic vs. mitral) and 43 had double-valve infection. Mean aortic cross-clamp time was 57, 38 and 67 min, respectively. Sixty-four patients (32%) had extensive infection involving the anulus or adjacent tissues, or both; such infection more frequently involved the aortic than the mitral valve (p less than 0.05). Thirty-eight patients (35%) with aortic valve infection had abscess formation compared with 1 patient (2%) with mitral valve infection (p less than 0.05). Only eight patients (4%) died in the hospital. There were seven patients (3%) with a periprosthetic leak and five patients (3%) with early prosthetic valve endocarditis. Long-term follow-up, available in 174 hospital survivors (89%), revealed 10 deaths and two new ring leaks at 38 +/- 22 months. In conclusion, among patients with endocarditis who need surgery for heart failure, aortic valve infection is more prevalent than mitral valve infection and is more often associated with extensive infection, including abscess formation. 
Hemopericardium: a late complication after repair of pectus excavatum. Hemopericardium and tamponade occurred in a 12 year old boy with Marfan's syndrome, two years after surgical repair of pectus excavatum. This life-threatening complication resulted from penetration of a fractured metal plate through the pericardium into the right atrium. The clinical details are reported and discussed. 
Loss of transforming growth factor beta 1 receptors and its effects on the growth of EBV-transformed human B cells. Transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) is a potent negative regulator of normal human B cell growth mediated by exogenous signals, including IL-2 and low m.w. B cell growth factor 12 kDa (BCGF-12 kDa). In the present study, we investigated the regulatory linkage between viral or nonviral transformation of human B cells and the growth inhibitory effects of TGF-beta 1. A panel of EBV+ and EBV- B cell lines, derived either by in vitro EBV B cell transformation, or from cases of lymphoma was used to quantitate the negative growth effects of TGF-beta 1. The proliferative response of three EBV- B cell lines to rBCGF-12 kDa or serum was inhibited by low concentrations of TGF-beta 1 (0.2-0.5 ng/ml for 50% maximal effect), as measured by tritiated thymidine uptake and viable cellular recovery. In contrast, rBCGF-12 kDa or serum mediated proliferation of three EBV+ B cell lines was refractory to the growth inhibitory effects of TGF-beta 1. In an attempt to understand the mechanism(s) for this differential growth control in EBV+ and EBV- B cells, we studied the expression of TGF-beta 1, c-myc, and TGF-beta 1 receptors. No correlation was observed between the expression of TGF-beta 1 or c-myc gene and growth inhibition by TGF-beta 1 in the cell lines studied. Our results indicate that sensitivity or resistance to TGF-beta 1 correlated with the presence or absence (loss) of high affinity receptors for TGF-beta 1. EBV- B cell lines expressed levels of high affinity receptors similar to those found on activated normal B or T cells. In contrast, EBV+ B cell lines showed no detectable high affinity receptors. Chemical cross-linking studies with a bifunctional reagent, dissuccinimidyl suberate revealed a normal expression of type I (65-70 kDa), type II (85-90 kDa), and type III (280-300 kDa) TGF-beta 1 high affinity receptors on EBV- B cell lines. In contrast, EBV+ B cell lines did not express type I and type II receptors, whereas type III receptors were expressed but could not be inhibited by unlabeled TGF-beta 1.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS). 
Rare choroidal tumour simulating a malignant melanoma. A 15-year-old boy had been treated for a central chorioretinitis of his right eye. The other eye had always been normal. Two years later he presented a relapse with deterioration of central visual acuity. All clinical tests, including fluorescein angiography, suggested an inflammatory process this time again. Thereafter, the patient did not show up for 6 years. Then he came to hospital because of strong pains in his right eye. Now, a blind and inflamed eye was found with a huge tumour from the optic nerve extending to the temporal periphery. All clinical investigations, amongst others ultrasonography, computerized tomography and magnetic resonance tomography, suggested a choroidal melanoma with extrabulbar extension. An enucleation with partial exenteration was performed. A demonstration and discussion of the clinical findings and the rare and complicated histological diagnosis of a very unusual ectopic meningioma-like lesion are given. 
Cost-effective treatment of constipation in the elderly: a randomized double-blind comparison of sorbitol and lactulose. PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to evaluate the use of sorbitol as an inexpensive alternative to lactulose for treating constipation in the elderly. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Thirty men aged 65 to 86 with chronic constipation were studied in a randomized, double-blind, cross-over trial in which lactulose and 70% sorbitol (0 to 60 mL daily) were each given for 4 weeks preceded by a 2-week washout period. RESULTS: The average number of bowel movements per week was 6.71 with sorbitol and 7.02 with lactulose (95% confidence interval of the difference: -0.43 to 1.06), and the average number of days per week with bowel movements was 5.23 with sorbitol and 5.31 with lactulose (95% confidence interval of the difference: -0.32 to 0.48). Eleven patients stated a preference for sorbitol, 12 for lactulose, and seven had no preference. On a visual analogue scale measuring severity of constipation (0 to 100 mm), the average score for sorbitol was 35.6 mm versus 37.1 mm for lactulose (95% confidence interval of the difference: -6.4 to 9.3). The sorbitol and lactulose treatment periods were also similar in percent of bowel movements recorded as "normal," frequency and severity of symptoms such as bloating, cramping, and excessive flatulence, and overall health status as assessed by a previously validated five-category questionnaire. There were no significant differences between sorbitol and lactulose in any outcome measured except nausea, which was increased with lactulose (p less than 0.05). CONCLUSION: These results support the hypothesis that sorbitol and lactulose have no clinically significant differences in laxative effect. Sorbitol can be recommended as a cost-effective alternative to lactulose for the treatment of constipation in the elderly. 
The role of two-dimensional echocardiography in the diagnosis of ineffective endocarditis. Two-dimensional echocardiography has had a significant impact on and is considered the technique of choice for the diagnosis and management of infective endocarditis. Over a thirty-six month period, 106 patients were evaluated by echocardiography for the possibility of endocarditis. The diagnosis of endocarditis was determined by strict clinical and laboratory criteria. All clinical histories, blood cultures, echocardiograms, and autopsy results were reviewed. Five echocardiograms were technically inadequate, resulting in a study population of 101 patients. The age of the patients ranged from forty-five days to eighty-eight years (mean fifty-seven years). The clinical manifestations of endocarditis included fever (83%), chills (60%), congestive heart failure (25%), and splenomegaly (18%). Twelve patients had preexisting valvular or congenital heart disease. Gram-positive cocci were the most common microorganisms. Complications included mitral regurgitation, subarachnoid hemorrhage, renal infarction, stroke, and a pulmonary embolus. The patients were divided into two groups: Group I consisted of 36 patients with definite vegetations by echocardiography, and Group II had 65 patients with no vegetations. In Group I, acute infective endocarditis was present in 35 patients, whereas only 4 patients had endocarditis in Group II. The sensitivity of two-dimensional echocardiography for detecting endocarditis was 90%. The specificity was 98%. The predictive accuracy for a positive test was 97%, and the predictive accuracy for a negative test was 94%. Thus, two-dimensional echocardiography appears to have a high sensitivity, specificity, and predictive value in the evaluation of patients with suspected endocarditis. 
Unilateral erythromelanosis follicularis faciei et colli in a young girl. Erythromelanosis follicularis faciei et colli is uncommon. Fewer than 20 cases have been reported. Except for one case in a woman and one case of unilateral distribution, all other reported cases have been bilateral in young male patients. We report the first case of unilateral distribution in a white girl. 
Root of the superior mesenteric artery in pancreatitis and pancreatic carcinoma: evaluation with CT To determine if changes involving the root of the superior mesenteric artery are specific for neoplasm, the authors retrospectively reviewed 173 computed tomographic (CT) examinations of patients with proved pancreatitis (103 examinations) and pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (70 examinations). Streaky infiltration of the fat surrounding the root was seen in 27 of 56 examinations of acute pancreatitis, in four of 24 examinations of chronic pancreatitis, in 12 of 23 examinations of pancreatitis complicated by abscess, and in 25 of 70 examinations of pancreatic carcinoma. Periarterial lymph nodes were visible in 14 with acute pancreatitis, in three with chronic pancreatitis, in six with pancreatic abscess, and in 11 with pancreatic carcinoma. A focal mass extended to within 1 cm of the root in 10 with acute pancreatitis, in two with chronic pancreatitis, in four with pancreatic abscess, and in 24 with pancreatic carcinoma; the mass obliterated the periarterial fat in seven with acute pancreatitis, in one with pancreatic abscess, and in 18 with pancreatic carcinoma. Circumferential encasement occurred in one with chronic pancreatitis, in four with pancreatic abscess, in 14 with pancreatic carcinoma, and in none with acute pancreatitis; nearly all cases of encasement revealed loss of periarterial fat. Thus, these indicators are not specific for neoplasm. 
Hyperglycemia-induced cholestasis in the isolated perfused rat liver. In a previous report we showed that cholestasis in diabetic rats is due in part to hyperglycemia. To gain information about the mechanism responsible for this phenomenon, bile flow was studied in isolated perfused rat livers. The perfusion media were modified erythrocyte-free Krebs-Henseleit solutions. Under these experimental conditions, no cholestasis was observed in isolated rat livers obtained from rats treated with streptozotocin (6 mg/100 gm body wt) 6 days before the experiments. We then proceeded to use normal animals. The composition of the perfusion media was modified to maintain the osmolality even after increasing D-glucose concentrations from 0 to 35 mmol/L. Bile flow was not affected with doses up to 15 mmol/L D-glucose. Beyond a threshold value for plasma D-glucose concentrations between 15 and 20 mmol/L, cholestasis was observed. Using D-glucose analogs such as L-glucose and 3-O-methyl-D-glucose, bile flow was also reduced (by 0.54 and 0.53 microliters/min/gm liver, respectively). Isosmotic sucrose-containing perfusion media were also observed to impair bile flow (by 0.66 microliters/min/gm liver). However, i-erythritol and D-mannitol failed to inhibit bile formation. The study of bile/plasma concentration ratios determined using tracer amounts of radioactive sugars indicated that this value was much lower for cholestatic sucrose (0.11) and L-glucose (0.31) than for noncholestatic i-erythritol (0.99) and D-mannitol (0.98). Cholestasis was partly reversed after induction by 35 mmol/L D-glucose if perfusion media were replaced by sugar-free ones, but also by media containing 25 mmol/L D-glucose. Insulin given during the perfusion with sugar-free media was observed to have no effect on bile flow. 
Needle biopsy associated tumor tracking of adenocarcinoma of the prostate. We reviewed 350 previously biopsied completely submitted clinical stage B radical prostatectomy specimens resected between January 1, 1987 and December 31, 1988 in an attempt to identify the incidence of needle biopsy associated tumor tracking into periprostatic soft tissue. We identified 7 cases (2.0%) of needle biopsy associated tumor tracking, 3 in which the only tumor penetration in the gland was limited to the needle track. The maximal soft tissue extension from the biopsy site ranged from 0.1 to 1.2 cm. and approached the nearest soft tissue margin to within 0.5 mm. in 4 cases. In contrast to prior reports showing clinically evident tracking only with transperineal biopsies from high grade tumors, 6 of our 7 cases were of intermediate grade (in the glandular and tracking components) and 6 had transrectal biopsies. Needle biopsy associated tumor tracking occurred with core (14 gauge) and biopsy gun needles (18 gauge). An additional 13 cases (3.7%) showed some features of needle biopsy associated tumor tracking but they were equivocal. These findings have significant implications in light of recent proposals advocating serial mapping of prostate cancer using the biopsy gun with potential conservative observation of smaller tumors. 
Bilateral eyelid myxomas in Carney's complex. A 21-year-old man with a history of an excised soft tissue mass of the groin and spotty cutaneous pigmentation underwent excision of nodules of the right lower and left upper eyelids. The patient subsequently had a cutaneous mass of the left ear removed. All excised lesions were classified as myxomas. A diagnosis of multiple myxoma, spotty pigmentation, and endocrine overactivity (Carney's) complex was made. 
Treatment of postoperative nausea and vomiting with ondansetron: a randomized, double-blind comparison with placebo. Postoperative nausea and vomiting are common after recovery from general anesthesia. The antiemetic effect and safety of ondansetron, a selective serotonin type 3 (5-HT3) receptor antagonist, was determined in 36 patients suffering from nausea or vomiting during recovery from intravenous anesthesia by giving either a single intravenous dose of ondansetron (8 mg, n = 18) or placebo (n = 18) over 2-5 min in a randomized, double-blind manner. A "rescue" antiemetic was provided in case of continued vomiting or at the patient's request. Antiemetic efficacy was defined as no request for rescue antiemetic and/or no vomiting episode during the next 4 h. There was no significant difference in the demographic data between the groups. Administration of ondansetron or placebo had no significant effect on vital signs. Ondansetron was an effective antiemetic in 78% (14/18) and placebo was effective in 28% (5/18) of the patients. Laboratory studies 24 h later showed no signs of hematologic, hepatic, or renal alterations. Ondansetron at a dose of 8 mg administered intravenously over 2-5 min appears to be a safe and effective antiemetic for the treatment of nausea and/or vomiting after intravenous anesthesia. 
Copper deficiency in a genetically hypertensive cardiomyopathic rat: electrocardiogram, functional and ultrastructural aspects. The effect of copper deficiency on cardiac function and structure was studied in a strain of rats (SHHS/Mcc-cp) known to develop cardiac failure as adults. Restriction of dietary copper (less than or equal to 1 mg/kg vs. 6 mg/kg in adequate diets) at weaning in both sexes for a 6-wk period produced cardiac hypertrophy. Male rats developed more severe copper-deficiency symptoms than their female counterparts. In both sexes of copper-deficient rats, there was an increase in cardiac length, width, free ventricular wall thickness and septum thickness. Electrocardiographic tracings revealed greater QRS height among male copper-deficient rats. Heart rate also was substantially reduced in this group. The increased volume of myocardium occupied by mitochondria in the copper-deficient male rats might result in increased electrical resistance that would increase the QRS height; hypertrophy or anemia also could be contributory. Some male copper-deficient rats had prolongation of the QRS in a bundle branch block pattern. Maximal rates of rise and fall for left ventricular pressure were reduced in male copper-deficient rats. The gross histology indicated that this type of heart failure was more concentric than eccentric. The copper-deficient male rat may serve as a useful model for studying the concentric cardiac hypertrophy that occurs in humans. 
Giant, human immunodeficiency virus-related ulcers in the esophagus. Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection of the esophagus has recently been implicated as a cause of giant esophageal ulcers in HIV-positive patients with odynophagia. The authors examined four patients in whom esophagograms (one single-contrast and three double-contrast studies) revealed giant, HIV-related ulcers indistinguishable from those of cytomegalovirus (CMV) esophagitis. All four patients had severe odynophagia, one had an associated maculopapular rash, and two became HIV-positive at approximately the time of clinical presentation. In all patients, biopsy samples, brushings, and cultures obtained with endoscopy were negative for CMV or herpes simplex. One patient had positive brushings for candidiasis, but this may have resulted from fungal superinfection of the ulcer. Two patients were treated with orally administered steroids, and all four had swift clinical improvement; symptoms disappeared during an average period of 8.3 days from presentation. HIV-related esophageal ulcers should be distinguished from CMV ulcers, so that appropriate treatment can be initiated in these patients. 
Longer relapse-free period after sucralfate than after H2-blocker treatment of duodenal and gastric ulcers. In a prospective investigation of 2,045 patients with recurrent peptic ulcer disease, the relapse-free period after acute treatment with sucralfate was evaluated over 1 year. This remission period was compared retrospectively with that achieved by previous treatment with a histamine-H2-blocker in the same patients. Only patients who had a symptomatic relapse within 1 year after H2-blocker therapy were included. Patients with no relapses within 1 year after sucralfate were assumed to have a relapse on day 366, in order to compare the two periods. In 73% of the evaluable 2,045 patients, remission after sucralfate was longer than after H2-blocker, and 23% of these patients had no symptomatic relapse at all within 1 year after sucralfate. The average relapse-free period after sucralfate was 212 days, as compared with 132 days after H2-blockers (difference = 80 days; p less than 0.0001). Elderly and nonsmoking patients and those experiencing their first recurrence, or who had a duodenal ulcer, benefited especially from acute treatment with sucralfate. It can be concluded that peptic ulcer patients with a relapse after treatment with an H2-blocker are suitable candidates for sucralfate therapy. There is a high probability that the relapse-free period after sucralfate is longer than after H2-blocker treatment in both gastric and duodenal ulcer patients. 
Tensile properties of the human femur-anterior cruciate ligament-tibia complex. The effects of specimen age and orientation. The structural properties of 27 pairs of human cadaver knees were evaluated. Specimens were equally divided into three groups of nine pairs each based on age: younger (22 to 35 years), middle (40 to 50 years), and older (60 to 97 years). Anterior-posterior displacement tests with the intact knee at 30 degrees and 90 degrees of flexion revealed a significant effect of knee flexion angle, but not of specimen age. Tensile tests of the femur-ACL-tibia complex were performed at 30 degrees of knee flexion with the ACL aligned vertically along the direction of applied tensile load. One knee from each pair was oriented anatomically (anatomical orientation), and the contralateral knee was oriented with the tibia aligned vertically (tibial orientation). Structural properties of the femur-ACL-tibia complex, as represented by the linear stiffness, ultimate load, and energy absorbed, were found to decrease significantly with specimen age and were also found to have higher values in specimens tested in the anatomical orientation. In the younger specimens, linear stiffness (242 +/- 28 N/mm) and ultimate load (2160 +/- 157 N) values found when the femur-ACL-tibia complex was tested in the anatomical orientation were higher than those reported previously in the literature. These values provide new baseline data for the design and selection of grafts for ACL replacement in an attempt to reproduce normal knee kinematics. 
Stage IIB osteogenic sarcoma. Two hundred seventy-one consecutive patients treated from 1976 through 1986 were reviewed to estimate long-term survival. Disease-free survival for the entire cohort was 77% at five years and 74% at ten years. Humeral lesions had the best probability of survival (84% at ten years), followed by tibial lesions (81%) and femoral lesions (67%). Histologic response to preoperative chemotherapy was the strongest predictor of outcome. Those with little response had a survival estimate of 54% at ten years as compared to 68% for partial responders and approximately 90% for complete responders. Local recurrence was seen in 6.6% and was associated with an adverse effect on survival. Only two of the 18 patients with local recurrence have been rendered long-term disease-free survivors. 
Liver diseases unique to pregnancy. Severe liver diseases occur in less than 0.1% of pregnancies. Accurate diagnosis and appropriate therapy are essential to the health and survival of both the mother and fetus. Because of their low incidence and the fact that most pregnant women are cared for primarily by their obstetricians, gastroenterologists only infrequently encounter these diseases. This review is intended to update the practicing gastroenterologist on the complex spectrum of liver diseases unique to pregnancy. 
A comparison of the analgesic and respiratory effects of epidural nalbuphine or morphine in postthoracotomy patients. This randomized, double-blind study compared the analgesic and respiratory effects of lumbar epidural morphine 5 mg, nalbuphine 10 mg, and nalbuphine 20 mg in repeated doses in patients after thoracotomy; the first dose was administered intraoperatively. Pre-and postoperative monitoring included continuous pulse oximetry, respiratory inductance plethysmography, and repeated arterial blood gas analysis. Postoperatively, visual analogue pain scores, somnolence scores, respiratory rate, and arterial blood gases were determined for 16 h. Preoperatively, episodes of apnea were common during sleep but were not associated with low hemoglobin oxygen saturation or increased arterial carbon dioxide tension (PaCO2). During sleep, some otherwise normal patients had increased PaCO2, and 2 of 15 patients had episodes of hemoglobin oxygen saturation of less than 90%. Postoperatively, 1 and 2 h after arrival in the recovery room, patients who received morphine had lower pain scores than did those who received nalbuphine 10 or 20 mg (P less than 0.05). All 6 patients who received morphine had satisfactory analgesia. Two of 4 patients who received nalbuphine 10 mg and all 5 who received nalbuphine 20 mg were withdrawn from the study because of inadequate analgesia (morphine vs. nalbuphine 10 mg, not significant; morphine vs. nalbuphine 20 mg, P less than 0.01). Two patients who received morphine had persistently increased PaCO2 postoperatively. Two patients who received morphine had episodes of apnea and slow respiratory rate, which were most frequent 6 h after arrival in the recovery room. We conclude that lumbar epidural nalbuphine does not provide adequate analgesia after thoracotomy. 
Dipeptidyl aminopeptidase IV staining of cytologic preparations to distinguish benign from malignant thyroid diseases. Staining for dipeptidyl aminopeptidase IV (DAP IV [EC: 3.4.14.5]) activity was applied to aspiration biopsy specimens or imprint preparations of surgical biopsy specimens from thyroid tumors. Material was obtained from 55 patients with histologically proven thyroid diseases: 9 with papillary carcinoma, 5 with follicular carcinoma, 11 with follicular adenoma, 13 with adenomatous goiter, 8 with Hashimoto's thyroiditis, and 9 with other benign conditions. Most tumor cells, follicular lumina in cell clusters, and intranuclear inclusions were strongly positive for DAP IV in all examples of papillary or follicular carcinoma. In contrast, only a few epithelial cells were labeled for DAP IV in follicular adenoma and adenomatous goiter. Some Hurthle cells in Hashimoto's thyroiditis also were positive for DAP IV. When a DAP IV scoring system based on the percentage of positive cells and staining intensity was used, all benign tissues except one (from a follicular adenoma) were found to have extremely low scores. These results indicate that staining for DAP IV activity is a simple but useful tool to aid in distinguishing benign from malignant thyroid neoplasms. 
The performance of two tympanic thermometers in a pediatric emergency department. In a prospective, unblinded, controlled study, 303 children underwent comparison of rectal (RT) and right-sided tympanic membrane (TMT) temperatures. Digital electronic thermometers were used for RT, while two different infrared detection devices assessed TMT. The performance of TMT devices were compared using correlation with RT, fever detection, and ease of use. Correlation between RT and the two devices was good, r = 0.70 and r = 0.69, with little influence of patient age on performance. Using receiver operating characteristics curves to assess fever screening. Thermoscan performed somewhat better than First Temp. Staff rated the Thermoscan as significantly easier to use. 
Gene mapping in the idiopathic generalized epilepsies: juvenile myoclonic epilepsy, childhood absence epilepsy, epilepsy with grand mal seizures, and early childhood myoclonic epilepsy. Idiopathic generalized epilepsies, i.e., juvenile myoclonic epilepsy (JME), childhood absence epilepsy, and epilepsy with grand mal [generalized tonic-clonic seizures (GTCS)], are the most common genetic epilepsies. Linkage studies using Bf, HLA serologic, and DNA markers by three independent investigators, one from Los Angeles and two from Berlin, have localized the JME locus to the short arm of chromosome 6 (6p). Because members of the same JME family have the same JME phenotype of childhood absence epilepsy, epilepsy with grand mal (GTCS) seizures, or early childhood myoclonic epilepsy (ECME), our observations give evidence for a single-locus etiology in 6p for JME and for at least some of the childhood absence seizures, epilepsy with grand mal (GTCS) seizures, and ECME. Studies should now address whether locus heterogeneity exists within childhood absence epilepsy, epilepsy with grand mal (GTCS) seizures, or ECME. Markers linked to JME (Bf, HLA serologic, and DNA markers in the DQ region) can be used to resolve etiologic heterogeneity. Using such markers, both linked and unlinked forms of phenotypes that are clinically indistinguishable may be detected and provide evidence for etiologic heterogeneity. Studies should also concentrate on narrowing the JME locus to 2 to 3 cm by screening families with recombinant events using RFLPs, candidate genes, and new expressed sequences on chromosome 6. 
An open label study of oral transmucosal fentanyl citrate (OTFC) for the treatment of breakthrough cancer pain. Ten patients with advanced cancer and breakthrough pain between the ages of 39 and 78 received oral transmucosal fentanyl citrate (10-15 micrograms/kg) 4 or 5 times each over 2 days (42 total administrations) in an open study. Baseline vital sign and rating scale results did not vary over administrations, except for heart rate which showed an 8 beats/min decrease over 4 administrations. Heart rate and oxygen saturation did not vary significantly over 120 min of evaluation, and minimal changes in blood pressure and respiration rate were found. Significant reduction in pain scores as measured by a pain descriptive scale, the McGill-Melzack scale, and a numeric (VAS) scale were seen at all evaluations from 5 to 120 min. Average time to onset of pain relief was 9.5 min after administration. Wellbeing was significantly increased at all evaluations. Activity level as recorded by the investigator was significantly reduced from 10 to 30 min after administration, however, activity level as reported by the patient was significantly increased at 5 min and from 60 to 120 min after OTFC administration. There were no significant adverse effects. 
Protection against infarction afforded by preconditioning is mediated by A1 adenosine receptors in rabbit heart. BACKGROUND. Preconditioning (5 minutes of ischemia followed by 10 minutes of recovery) renders the heart very resistant to infarction from subsequent ischemia. This study tests whether adenosine receptors might mediate preconditioning protection. METHODS AND RESULTS. We examined the effect on infarct size of pretreatment with either of two adenosine receptor antagonists in both control and preconditioned in situ rabbit hearts. Hearts underwent 30 minutes of regional ischemia plus 3 hours of reperfusion, and infarct size was measured with tetrazolium. Infarct size averaged 39% of the zone at risk in controls but only 8% in preconditioned hearts. Preconditioned and nonpreconditioned hearts receiving either blocker had infarcts not different in size from the controls. A 5-minute intracoronary infusion of adenosine was as effective as 5 minutes of ischemia in protecting parabiotically perfused isolated hearts against infarction from a 45-minute ischemic insult. Similarly, intracoronary infusion of N6-1-(phenyl-2R-isopropyl)adenosine, an A1-selective adenosine receptor agonist, at a dose that delayed conduction but did not dilate the coronary vessels, also limited infarct size. The protection disappeared when we reduced the coronary concentration of drug by intravenous infusion of adenosine, indicating that cardiac rather than peripheral receptors were involved in the protection. CONCLUSIONS. We conclude that adenosine released during the preconditioning occlusion stimulates cardiac A1 receptors, which leaves the heart protected against infarction even after the adenosine has been withdrawn. 
A CD18 monoclonal antibody increases the incidence and severity of subcutaneous abscess formation after high-dose Staphylococcus aureus injection in rabbits. Monoclonal antibody (MAb) 60.3 blocks CD18-dependent polymorphonuclear neutrophil adherence to endothelium and has been shown to be of benefit in preventing tissue injury in a variety of inflammatory conditions. However, concern exists that interference with normal polymorphonuclear neutrophil host-defense functions may increase susceptibility to bacterial infection. We compared the development of subcutaneous Staphylococcus aureus abscesses in rabbits pretreated with MAb 60.3 to those pretreated with saline placebo. Bacterial inoculation with 10(6) or 10(7) colony-forming units (CFU) did not result in abscess formation in either control or antibody-treated groups. However, inoculation with 10(8) CFU resulted in more frequent and larger abscesses in antibody-treated rabbits than in controls. Abscess incidence was similar for inoculation with 10(9) CFU, although antibody-treated rabbits developed larger abscesses than did controls. The difference in abscess development is due to delayed leukocyte migration into inoculated tissue. The results of these experiments suggest that subjects treated with MAb 60.3 and exposed to massive S. aureus inocula may be at serious risk of infection. However, despite inhibited leukocyte adhesion, inocula of up to 10(7) CFU were well tolerated in this model. Whether these findings are clinically important remains to be determined, although exposure to bacterial concentrations of 10(8) CFU or greater occurs only rarely in clinical practice. 
The frequency and significance of ECG changes after transurethral prostate resection. Although many clinicians routinely recommend a base-line preoperative electrocardiogram (ECG) and obtain frequent postoperative ECGs to screen for myocardial infarction or ischemia, the diagnostic utility of screening perioperative ECGs is unknown. The present analysis evaluates the sensitivity and specificity of the perioperative ECG and examines its value as a predictor of early postoperative cardiac events and outcomes during the postoperative year. ECGs obtained preoperatively and on the first 3 postoperative days in 206 men undergoing transurethral prostate resection were analyzed using the Minnesota Code. The occurrence of cardiac events during the operative stay was assessed by measurement of the cardiospecific MB creatine kinase isoenzyme on the first 3 postoperative days and review of the entire clinical course. Twenty-one percent of patients developed postoperative ECG changes, mostly involving the T wave; none had cardiac symptoms or sustained creatine kinase MB elevation. Changes were not significantly more common in men known to have coronary disease. The single patient who had a perioperative myocardial infarction confirmed by enzymes had no codable ECG changes. The specificity of any ECG change for perioperative infarction was 78%; of ST segment changes only, 95%. Only one of the patients (2%) who had postoperative ECG changes had a cardiac event in the year after surgery. Routine perioperative ECGs is of little diagnostic/predictive utility in situations in which the incidence of perioperative myocardial infarction is low. 
MR imaging of synovial sarcoma. The MR imaging findings in 12 cases of synovial sarcoma are illustrated. The MR appearance most indicative of the tumor is an inhomogeneous septated mass with infiltrative margins located close to a joint, a tendon, or bursae, especially if soft-tissue calcification can be seen on CT scans or plain radiographs. 
Hormone replacement therapy and coronary heart disease. Proper use of postmenopausal hormone replacement has been the subject of debate for decades. Prevailing medical opinion has swung between enthusiastic endorsement and extreme caution. The wave of optimism over estrogen's beneficial effects on menopausal symptoms and skeletal health was temporarily set back by the evidence that linked estrogen to endometrial cancer. Once studies showed that progestogen cotherapy could protect against this adverse effect, physicians were again encouraged to prescribe hormone replacement. Since 1980, increasing epidemiologic and experimental evidence has suggested a hitherto unappreciated and immense CHD health benefit from use of postmenopausal estrogen therapy. Although addition of progestogen may offset the cardiovascular benefits of estrogen slightly, its use is reasonable and practical. No woman need be subjected to unopposed estrogen's carcinogenic effects on her endometrium. Based on available evidence, hormone replacement therapy, appropriately administered, is both safe and beneficial. Unfortunately, there is no single way to prescribe it. The treating physician must make a series of best judgments. Practically speaking, this entails, in each case, finding the form of therapy that is acceptable to the patient and that provides the greatest health benefits with the least likelihood of adverse affects. Our prescribing habits have evolved in the last 15 to 20 years. We have better discrimination of the woman most likely to benefit; improved therapy through use of newer formulations, dosages, routes, and schedules; and more appropriate implementation of monitoring procedures. Although questions remain, we should not let our imperfect knowledge dissuade us from more widespread prescribing of hormone replacement therapy. 
Mechanism of the increased ventilatory response to exercise in patients with chronic heart failure. Minute ventilation, respiratory rate, and metabolic gas exchange were measured continuously during maximal symptom limited treadmill exercise in 30 patients with stable chronic heart failure. The ventilatory response to exercise was assessed by calculation of the slope of the relation between minute ventilation and rate of carbon dioxide production. There was a close correlation between the severity of heart failure, determined as the maximal rate of oxygen consumption, and the ventilatory response to exercise. Reanalysis of the data after correction for ventilation of anatomical dead space did not significantly weaken the correlation but reduced the slope of the relation by approximately one third. These results show that the increased ventilatory response to exercise in patients with chronic heart failure is largely caused by mechanisms other than increased ventilation of anatomical dead space. This finding supports the concept that a significant pulmonary ventilation/perfusion mismatch develops in patients with chronic heart failure and suggests that the magnitude of this abnormality is directly related to the severity of chronic heart failure. 
Endoscopic balloon dilatation as a therapeutic option in the management of intestinal strictures resulting from Crohn's disease. Endoscopic balloon dilatation was undertaken in seven patients who presented with obstructive symptoms resulting from Crohn's disease. Five patients had strictures from recurrent disease at the site of an ileotransverse anastomosis, one had duodenal stenosis and one a colonic stricture. The procedures were performed under intravenous sedation on one to four occasions (median 2) and were uncomplicated. Sustained improvement over an 18-24-month follow-up period was achieved in five patients, but dilatation was unsuccessful in two cases. Endoscopic balloon dilatation is a safe and effective option in selected patients with intestinal strictures resulting from Crohn's disease and may overcome the need for surgery. 
Adrenergic hypersensitivity after beta-blocker withdrawal in hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. Withdrawal of beta-blocker therapy has been associated with the development of adrenergic hypersensitivity and adverse clinical effects in patients with coronary artery disease and hypertension. The aim of this study was to establish the occurrence and clinical significance of adrenergic hypersensitivity after abrupt withdrawal of long-term beta blockade in hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. Beta-adrenergic sensitivity was measured using the isoprenaline chronotropic dose25. Symptom assessment chronotropic dose25 calculation, bicycle exercise, echocardiography and Holter monitoring were performed while the patient received beta-blocker therapy and repeated on days 2, 4, 6, 8 (acute withdrawal period) and on day 21 after abrupt withdrawal. The study was terminated after 7 patients had been studied because all patients experienced a marked deterioration in symptoms and several clinical events had occurred. The chronotropic dose25 (mean +/- standard deviation) demonstrated beta 1-adrenergic hypersensitivity with a minimal value of 1.6 +/- 0.8 micrograms during the acute withdrawal period compared with 3.8 +/- 1.7 micrograms on day 21 (p = 0.003). Heart rates during rest and exercise showed an overshoot increase during the acute withdrawal period. The maximal 24-hour ventricular ectopic count was higher during the acute withdrawal period than during day 21 (p = 0.04). Of 3 patients with inducible outflow tract gradients, 2 developed resting gradients greater than 30 mm Hg during the acute withdrawal period. There was an increase in peak late filling velocity of mitral inflow after beta-blocker withdrawal. In conclusion, transient beta-adrenergic hypersensitivity occurs after beta-blocker withdrawal in hypertrophic cardiomyopathy and is associated with significant physiologic changes and adverse clinical consequences. 
Pediatric fine-needle aspiration biopsy. A total of 135 fine-needle aspiration (FNA) biopsies from varying sites were performed in 123 children (mean, 10.5 years; range, one day to 18 years) over a five-year period. One hundred thirty (96.3%) biopsy specimens were satisfactory for evaluation. Seventy-nine cases were nonneoplastic (60.8%); among these cases, a specific diagnosis of infectious disease was made in 17 (13.1%). A diagnosis of neoplastic disease was made in 50 (38.5%) cases, of which 14 (10.8%) were benign, 28 (21.5%) were malignant, and 8 (6.2%) were neoplasms of uncertain biologic potential. The sensitivity of pediatric FNA biopsies was 90.6%, specificity 100%, positive predictive value 100%, negative predictive value 94.7%, and efficiency of the test 96.5%. There were no false-positive diagnoses and there were four false-negative diagnoses, three of which involved aspirates of the central nervous system (CNS). Ancillary studies, including immunocytochemistry (20 cases), electron microscopic examination (18 cases), microbiologic culture (8 cases), cytogenetic studies (7 cases), and flow cytometry (3 cases), were performed on the aspirated material, enabling a more specific diagnosis or supplying additional information in many cases. Definitive diagnosis by FNA biopsy enabled radiation therapy and/or chemotherapy to be administered for unresectable malignant neoplasms, provided material for culture of infectious lesions, identified benign lesions not needing surgery, and aided the surgeon in planning the extent of surgery in resectable malignant neoplasms. These results support the greater use of FNA biopsy in the pediatric population. 
Effects of interferon on intrahepatic human leukocyte antigens and lymphocyte subsets in patients with chronic hepatitis B and C. We investigated the effects of interferon therapy on hepatocyte human leukocyte antigen class I and class II antigen expression and intrahepatic lymphocyte subsets in patients with chronic viral hepatitis B (n = 11) and C (n = 10). Interferon-alpha was administered intramuscularly in doses ranging from 3 to 18 million international units daily for 4 wk. Liver biopsy specimens were obtained just before and immediately after treatment, and the specimens were stained by the indirect immunoperoxidase method for evaluation of human leukocyte antigen expression and lymphocyte subsets. Before therapy, no significant difference was noted between hepatitis B and C in human leukocyte antigen class I antigen expression on hepatocytes or in the lymphocyte subsets in the intralobular and portal areas. After interferon-alpha treatment, hepatocyte expression of human leukocyte antigen class I antigens and serum beta 2-microglobulin levels were virtually unchanged in chronic viral hepatitis C patients, but both were increased in chronic viral hepatitis B patients. Human leukocyte antigen class II antigens were not expressed during treatment. The mean number of intralobular CD3+ and CD8+ cells and the mean serum ALT level decreased significantly in chronic viral hepatitis C patients (p less than 0.05) but not in chronic viral hepatitis B patients. The mean number of intralobular CD4+ cells was unaffected by interferon therapy in both groups. In all 21 patients, the changes in CD8+ cell numbers paralleled the changes in serum ALT levels. Our findings suggest that T-cell cytotoxicity may play an important role in hepatocyte damage in both chronic viral hepatitis C and chronic viral hepatitis B and that the response to interferon-alpha differs in these two types of hepatitis. 
Anti-MY9-blocked-ricin: an immunotoxin for selective targeting of acute myeloid leukemia cells. The use of immunotoxins (IT) to selectively destroy acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cells in vivo or in vitro is complicated by both the antigenic similarity of AML cells to normal progenitor cells and the difficulty of producing a sufficiently toxic conjugate. The monoclonal antibody (MoAb) anti-MY9 is potentially ideal for selective recognition of AML cells because it reacts with an antigen (CD33) found on clonogenic AML cells from greater than 80% of cases and does not react with normal pluripotent stem cells. In this study, we describe an immunotoxin that is selectively active against CD33+ AML cells: Anti-MY9-blocked-Ricin (Anti-MY9-bR), comprised of anti-MY9 conjugated to a modified whole ricin that has its nonspecific binding eliminated by chemical blockage of the galactose binding domains of the B-chain. A limiting dilution assay was used to measure elimination of HL-60 leukemic cells from a 20-fold excess of normal bone marrow cells. Depletion of CD33+ HL-60 cells was found to be dependent on the concentration of Anti-MY9-bR and on the duration of incubation with IT at 37 degrees C. More than 4 logs of these leukemic cells were specifically depleted following short exposure to high concentrations (10(-8) mol/L) of Anti-MY9-bR. Incubation with much lower concentrations of Anti-MY9-bR (10(-10) mol/L), as compatible with in vivo administration, resulted in 2 logs of depletion of HL-60 cells, but 48 to 72 hours of continuous exposure were required. Anti-MY9-bR was also shown to be toxic to primary AML cells, with depletion of greater than 2 logs of clonogenic cells following incubation with Anti-MY9-bR 10(-8) mol/L at 37 degrees C for 5 hours. Activity of Anti-MY9-bR could be blocked by unconjugated Anti-MY9 but not by galactose. As expected, Anti-MY9-bR was toxic to normal colony-forming unit granulocyte-monocyte (CFU-GM), which expresses CD33, in a concentration- and time-dependent manner, and also to burst-forming unit-erythroid and CFU-granulocyte, erythroid, monocyte, megakaryocyte, although to a lesser extent. When compared with anti-MY9 and complement (C'), Anti-MY9-bR could be used in conditions that provided more effective depletion of AML cells with substantially less depletion of normal CFU-GM. Therefore, Anti-MY9-bR may have clinical utility for in vitro purging of AML cells from autologous marrow when used at high IT concentrations for short incubation periods. Much lower concentrations of Anti-MY9-bR that can be maintained for longer periods may be useful for elimination of AML cells in vivo. 
Nerve growth and expression of receptors for nerve growth factor in tumors of melanocyte origin. Nerve growth factor (NGF) stimulates growth and differentiation of sensory and sympathetic neurons. It is not known what role NGF plays in melanoma development, but nevus and malignant melanoma cells express NGF-receptor (NGF-R). We counted nerve fibers within melanocytic nevi, primary cutaneous melanomas, and cutaneous melanoma metastases using a monoclonal antibody (MoAb) as marker against a 200-kD glycoprotein that is expressed on human nerves. The expression of NGF-R was studied in serial cryostat sections using a MoAb against the NGF-R. Compared to normal skin, increased numbers of nerve fibers were found in 72 melanocytic nevi. In congenital nevi their number significantly increased with age. In 47 primary cutaneous melanomas the number of nerve fibers decreased in proportion to tumor thickness. In 33 cutaneous melanoma metastases no accumulation of nerve fibers was found. NGF-R was not expressed in normal skin melanocytes and in the majority of nevus cells in melanocytic nevi. Considerable numbers of NGF-R-positive nervus cells were found only in some congenital nevi and few acquired nevi with dysplastic features. By contrast, in primary and metastatic melanomas higher expression of NGF-R was observed. The increased number of nerve fibers in melanocytic nevi suggests that neurite-promoting factors are produced in situ. Production of such factors appears to be lost in malignant melanoma cells. The finding of an inverse correlation between an abundance of nerve fibers in NGF-R-poor nevi and a high expression of NGF-R in melanomas that show no evidence of nerve growth suggest a role of NGF and its receptor in malignant melanocytic tumors. 
Linear nevus sebaceous syndrome: megalencephaly and heterotopic gray matter. A 3-month-old white male with linear nevus sebaceous syndrome (LNSS), facial deformities, brain malformations, and cortical blindness is presented. Facial deformities included left ear hypertrophy and a left-sided hamartomatous neck mass. Magnetic resonance imaging suggested that a central nervous system (CNS) abnormality, involving gray and white matter, should be linked with LNSS. Magnetic resonance imaging was more useful than computed tomography in demonstrating the full spectrum of CNS anomalies, including unilateral lissencephaly, a paucity of white matter, excessive and heterotopic gray matter, apparent left schizencephaly, and unilateral left colpocephaly (dilation of atrium and posterior horn of lateral ventricle). Postmortem examination revealed left hemisphere megalencephaly with a dilated posterior horn of the lateral ventricle. The impressive gray matter heterotopias likely were the source of the patient's seizures and perhaps the ultimate cause of death. Megalencephaly and other deviations of neuronal migration should be considered as a dramatic component of LNSS. 
The neurology of aging: normal versus pathologic change. Mild changes in neurologic function occur with aging but generally do not substantially interfere with everyday activities unless disease intervenes. Not infrequently, older adults experience minor impairment in memory, speed of cognitive processing, sleep, vision and hearing, vibratory sense in the lower extremities, and gait and posture. In general, these changes correspond with age-associated neuroanatomic changes (eg, diminished brain weight), but there is wide variability in the extent to which these changes occur. Often, "normal" neurologic changes are difficult to distinguish from impairment associated with disease. 
In vivo and ex vivo magnetic resonance imaging evaluation of early disc degeneration with histopathologic correlation. The in vivo and ex vivo microanatomic appearance of early disc degeneration were identified by magnetic resonance imaging and correlated with their respective histopathologic findings. Five cadaver spines (18 discs) and 25 patient studies (122 discs) all imaged at 1.5 Tesla were studied. Two signs of early degenerative disc disease were found: infolding and the central dot. Infolding of the central fibers of the outer annulus coalesced into a central dot of low signal intensity that was seen on both the ex vivo and in vivo images. Infolding was seen 29 of 122 times, and the central dot was observed 15 to 122 times on the in vivo images. A later form of degenerative disc disease was identified as a separation of the nucleus pulposus from the hyaline cartilage end-plate. This separation was seen as a linear area of either low or high signal intensity on the ex vivo images but only as a band of high signal intensity on the in vivo spin-echo 2,500-msec/80-msec images. Only 7 of 122 in vivo discs showed this separation. Internal herniation of nucleus pulposus into the outer annulus was seen only on the ex vivo images. Early degenerative disc disease may exist before there is loss of disc height or signal intensity on the long time-to-repetition (TR)/time-to-echo (TE) magnetic resonance images. 
Neoplastic disease of the spine. In summary, MR imaging has become the single most effective modality for the evaluation of spinal neoplasms by virtue of its ability to image the spinal cord directly and noninvasively. In this fashion, one can localize mass lesions relative to the spinal cord; in conjunction with the patient's clinical history, it is thus possible to provide a brief yet accurate differential diagnosis. Intravenous paramagnetic contrast enhancement also may prove extremely useful in further delineating such lesions. In addition, it has demonstrated a high sensitivity to primary and secondary tumors of the bony spine through its ability to detect subtle T1 signal changes in the vertebral marrow space. 
Identification of p53 gene mutations in bladder cancers and urine samples. Although bladder cancers are very common, little is known about their molecular pathogenesis. In this study, invasive bladder cancers were evaluated for the presence of gene mutations in the p53 suppressor gene. Of 18 tumors evaluated, 11 (61 percent) were found to have genetic alterations of p53. The alterations included ten point mutations resulting in single amino acid substitutions, and one 24-base pair deletion. In all but one case, the mutations were associated with chromosome 17p allelic deletions, leaving the cells with only mutant forms of the p53 gene products. Through the use of the polymerase chain reaction and oligomer-specific hybridization, p53 mutations were identified in 1 to 7 percent of the cells within the urine sediment of each of three patients tested. The p53 mutations are the first genetic alterations demonstrated to occur in a high proportion of primary invasive bladder cancers. Detection of such mutations ex vivo has clinical implications for monitoring individuals whose tumor cells are shed extracorporeally. 
Comorbidity of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder with conduct, depressive, anxiety, and other disorders. OBJECTIVE: Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder is a heterogeneous disorder of unknown etiology. Little is known about the comorbidity of this disorder with disorders other than conduct. Therefore, the authors made a systematic search of the psychiatric and psychological literature for empirical studies dealing with the comorbidity of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder with other disorders. DATA COLLECTION: The search terms included hyperactivity, hyperkinesis, attention deficit disorder, and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, cross-referenced with antisocial disorder (aggression, conduct disorder, antisocial disorder), depression (depression, mania, depressive disorder, bipolar), anxiety (anxiety disorder, anxiety), learning problems (learning, learning disability, academic achievement), substance abuse (alcoholism, drug abuse), mental retardation, and Tourette's disorder. FINDINGS: The literature supports considerable comorbidity of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder with conduct disorder, oppositional defiant disorder, mood disorders, anxiety disorders, learning disabilities, and other disorders, such as mental retardation, Tourette's syndrome, and borderline personality disorder. CONCLUSIONS: Subgroups of children with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder might be delineated on the basis of the disorder's comorbidity with other disorders. These subgroups may have differing risk factors, clinical courses, and pharmacological responses. Thus, their proper identification may lead to refinements in preventive and treatment strategies. Investigation of these issues should help to clarify the etiology, course, and outcome of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder. 
Evaluation of combination thrombolytic therapy and timing of cardiac catheterization in acute myocardial infarction. Results of thrombolysis and angioplasty in myocardial infarction--phase 5 randomized trial. TAMI Study Group Recent trials of myocardial reperfusion using single-agent thrombolytic therapy and sequential cardiac catheterization have supported a conservative approach to the patient with acute myocardial infarction. To evaluate combination thrombolytic therapy and the role of a previously untested strategy for the aggressive use of cardiac catheterization, we performed a multicenter clinical trial with a 3 x 2 factorial design in which 575 patients were randomly allocated to one of three drug regimens--tissue-type plasminogen activator (t-PA) (n = 191), urokinase (n = 190), or both (n = 194) - and one of two catheterization strategies--immediate catheterization with angioplasty for failed thrombolysis (n = 287) or deferred predischarge catheterization on days 5-10 (n = 288). Patients with contraindications to thrombolytic therapy, cardiogenic shock, or age of more than 75 years were excluded. Global left ventricular ejection fraction was well preserved and almost identical at predischarge catheterization (54%), regardless of the catheterization or thrombolytic strategy used (p = 0.98). Combination thrombolytic therapy was associated with a less complicated clinical course, most clearly documented by a lower rate of reocclusion (2%) compared with urokinase (7%) and t-PA (12%) (p = 0.04) and a lower rate of recurrent ischemia (25%) compared with urokinase (35%) and t-PA (31%). When a composite clinical end point (e.g., death, stroke, reinfarction, reocclusion, heart failure, or recurrent ischemia) was examined, combination thrombolytic therapy was associated with greater freedom from any adverse event (68%) compared with either single agent (urokinase, 55%; t-PA, 60%) (p = 0.04) and with a less complicated clinical course when the composite clinical end points were ranked according to clinical severity (p = 0.024). Early patency rates were greater with combination therapy, although predischarge patency rates after considering interventions to maintain patency were similar among drug regimens. No difference in bleeding complication rates was observed with any thrombolytic regimen. The aggressive catheterization strategy led to an overall early patency rate of 96% and a predischarge patency rate of 94% compared with a 90% predischarge patency in the conservative strategy (p = 0.065). The aggressive strategy improved regional wall motion in the infarct region (-2.16 SDs/chord) compared with deferred catheterization (-2.49 SDs/chord) (p = 0.004). More patients treated with the aggressive strategy were free from adverse outcomes (67% versus 55% in the conservative strategy, p = 0.004), and the clinical course was less complicated when the adverse outcomes were ranked according to severity (p = 0.016). No significant increase in use of blood products resulted from the aggressive strategy.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS). 
Retained bile duct stones in a patient with Billroth II gastrectomy: extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy and papillary dilatation via T tube. A postoperative T tube cholangiogram after cholecystectomy in a 62 year old patient showed two retained calculi of 14 mm diameter each. Endoscopic sphincterotomy was not possible because of previous Billroth II gastrectomy. The stones were disintegrated by electromagnetically generated extracorporeal shock waves. The T tube was replaced by a balloon catheter and the papilla of Vater was dilatated allowing passage of stone fragments. We conclude that retained bile duct stones can be removed without sphincterotomy or percutaneous extraction by extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy and papillary dilatation. This method should be considered especially in patients with Billroth II gastrectomy. 
Failure of ursodeoxycholic acid to prevent a cholestatic episode in a patient with benign recurrent intrahepatic cholestasis: a study of bile acid metabolism. Ursodeoxycholic acid was administered to a patient with benign recurrent intrahepatic cholestasis to prevent cholestatic episodes. A detailed study of bile acid metabolism in this patient was carried out in the anicteric and icteric phases before and after ursodeoxycholic acid (750 mg/day) administration. Urinary, biliary and serum bile acids were measured by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry and by high-performance liquid chromatography techniques. During the anicteric phase the daily urinary excretion and serum concentrations of bile acids were within normal ranges, indicating normal hepatic uptake and secretion of bile acids during the cholestasis-free period. Only slight qualitative differences from normal individuals were observed; the relative proportions of deoxycholic acid in the bile and serum were higher, and 12-oxo-lithocholic acid was the predominant urinary bile acid. During the icteric phase a marked increase in the urinary excretion of primary bile acids and C-1, C-2, C-4 and C-6 hydroxylated metabolites was found. Serum bile acid concentrations increased before the rise in bilirubin, suggesting an acute disturbance in bile acid transport at the onset of the cholestatic attack. After ursodeoxycholic acid administration in the anicteric phase, bile became enriched with the exogenous bile acid, but little qualitative change was found in the other metabolites present in the urine, serum or bile during the anicteric or icteric phases. Prolonged administration of ursodeoxycholic acid failed to prevent recurrence of a cholestatic episode, suggesting that in benign recurrent intrahepatic cholestasis, oral ursodeoxycholic acid may be of little benefit in the treatment or prevention of cholestasis despite marked enrichment of the bile acid pool with this hydrophilic bile acid. 
False aneurysm of the right internal mammary artery. False aneurysm of the internal mammary artery is an uncommon complication of median sternotomy. Clinical and radiological findings of 2 such cases are presented. At operative exploration neither was directly related to the presence of a sternal wire. 
Sudden asphyxial death due to a prolapsed esophageal fibrolipoma. Fibrolipomas of the esophagus are extremely uncommon benign tumors. Accurate diagnosis and resection are essential, due to their tendency to become impacted and obstruct the airway. The case is presented of a 56-year-old man who died suddenly of asphyxia because of upper airway obstruction by a prolapsed fibrolipoma of the esophagus. 
Granulocyte colony-stimulating factor in cerebrospinal fluid from patients with meningitis. Granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) in the cerebrospinal fluid from patients with meningitis was measured by our modified enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay for G-CSF. The minimal detection level was 20 pg/mL G-CSF. In patients with bacterial meningitis, the G-CSF levels in the cerebrospinal fluid were extremely elevated, showing a mean value of approximately 1,500 pg/mL. On the other hand, G-CSF levels in the cerebrospinal fluid from 67% patients with aseptic meningitis were moderately increased, showing a mean value of about 80 pg/mL, whereas G-CSF levels in 33% samples remained undetectable. The G-CSF levels and neutrophil counts in the cerebrospinal fluid were proven to be related by Spearman's rank correlation coefficient analysis (r = .724). These elevations of G-CSF levels at inflammation sites associated with bacterial meningitis may indicate that G-CSF plays an important role in the combat of bacterial infections. 
Choosing initial therapy for hypertension. A personal view. With numerous safe and effective antihypertensive drugs now available, the clinician should no longer choose only diuretic agents or beta-adrenergic receptor blockers (beta-blockers) as initial therapy. Five classes of agents, including angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors, beta-blockers, calcium entry blockers, peripheral alpha 1-adrenergic receptor blockers, and thiazide diuretic agents, are all appropriate monotherapy in properly selected patients. The choice depends on efficacy, side effects, demography, comorbidity, dosage schedule, cost, mechanism of drug action, and the pathophysiology of the patient's hypertension. Extensive data are now available that will assist the clinician in choosing an agent that has the greatest probability of success without the need for extensive biochemical or hemodynamic evaluation. 
Variations in acromial ossification simulating infant abuse in victims of sudden infant death syndrome. A variation in ossification of the acromial process of the scapula is described. Postmortem radiographs, obtained in 78 infants who died of sudden infant death syndrome, showed an ossific opacity adjacent to the acromial process in 10 infants (13%). This finding was noted bilaterally in six patients and unilaterally in four patients. No two ossicles were identical. Histologically, no growth plate cartilage was evident between the bony structure and the acromion proper; therefore, this appeared to represent a "pseudoepiphysis." Superficially, this normal variation may appear similar to an acromial fracture resulting from infant abuse. However, a careful analysis of the findings of this normal variation should help prevent any confusion with inflicted injury. 
Risk factors for pancreatic cellular injury after cardiopulmonary bypass BACKGROUND. Pancreatitis is a known complication of cardiac surgery with cardiopulmonary bypass. Although ischemia is believed to be a factor, the cause of pancreatitis after cardiopulmonary bypass remains unknown. METHODS. We prospectively studied 300 consecutive patients undergoing cardiac surgery with cardiopulmonary bypass. Serum amylase, pancreatic isoamylase, and serum lipase were measured on postoperative days 1,2,3,7, and 10. Pancreatic cellular injury was defined as the presence of hyperamylasemia (greater than 123 U per liter) with an increase in either the serum level of lipase (greater than 24 U per liter) or the peak level of pancreatic isoamylase. Trypsinogen-activation peptides, which indicate intrapancreatic enzyme activation, were measured in the urine of the last 101 patients studied. RESULTS. Evidence of pancreatic cellular injury was detected in 80 patients (27 percent), of whom 23 had associated abdominal signs or symptoms and 3 had severe pancreatitis (2 with pancreatic abscess and 1 with necrotizing hemorrhagic pancreatitis). Two of 19 postoperative deaths were secondary to pancreatitis. In multivariate analyses, the development of pancreatic cellular injury was significantly associated with preoperative renal insufficiency, valve surgery, postoperative hypotension, and perioperative administration of calcium chloride. The administration of more than 800 mg of calcium chloride per square meter of body-surface area was an independent predictor of pancreatic cellular injury, and the increase in risk was dose-related. No differences were found in the level of trypsinogen-activation peptides between patients who had pancreatic cellular injury and those who did not. CONCLUSIONS. Pancreatic cellular injury, as indicated by hyperamylasemia of pancreatic origin, is common after cardiac surgery. The administration of large doses of calcium chloride is an independent predictor of pancreatic cellular injury and may be a cause of it. 
Results of treatment and lessons learned from pathologically staged T4 non-small cell lung cancer. Depending on the local extension of primary non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and invaded T4 structure(s), 49 patients underwent complete (CR, n = 14) or palliative (PR, n = 13) resection of exploratory thoracotomy (ET, n = 22) between January 1982 and June 1988. Thoracic radiotherapy (TR) was given to all patients receiving PR (median dose, 43 Gy) and ET (median dose, 53 Gy). With a median follow-up of 44 months, overall 2- and 5-year survival was 25 and 5%, respectively. Patients undergoing ET plus TR had a significantly worse survival than those treated by CR (P = 0.041) and PR plus TR (P = 0.046). Only completely resected patients became long-term survivors (5-year survival, 29%) and significant predictors of their survival were previous weight loss, hemoglobin, and creatinine level, in univariate analysis, and previous weight loss in multivariate analysis. The site of initial treatment failure was mainly local for PR plus TR (85%) and systemic for CR (71%) and ET plus TR (86%). Presented results suggest that surgery might play a role for selected patients with T4 NSCLC, but advances in systemic and local therapy are necessary. 
Nutritional support in Crohn's disease: which route? Nutritional and clinical responses to three nutritional regimens were retrospectively evaluated in 81 Crohn's patients with active disease. Group 1 (n = 42) received a low residue oral diet, group 2 (n = 15) received chemically defined diets, and group 3 (n = 24), parenteral nutrition (PN). Weight gain was observed in a similar percentage of patients, whereas serum albumin increase was significant only in group 3: 3.15 +/- 0.66 versus 3.54 +/- 0.61 g/100 ml (p less than 0.05). Mean activity index decreased significantly in all groups (p less than 0.001), and length of stay in hospital was similar. Patients with intestinal obstruction had a better immediate response when submitted to PN: clinical remission was achieved in 75% of those in group 3, but in only 50% in groups 1 and 2 (p less than 0.05). Otherwise, short- and long-term outcome was similar. 
Electrothrombosis of saccular aneurysms via endovascular approach. Part 2: Preliminary clinical experience. Fifteen patients with high-risk intracranial saccular aneurysms were treated using electrolytically detachable coils introduced via an endovascular approach. The patients ranged in age from 21 to 69 years. The most frequent clinical presentation was subarachnoid hemorrhage (eight cases). Considerable thrombosis of the aneurysm (70% to 100%) was achieved in all 15 patients, and preservation of the parent artery was obtained in 14. Although temporary neurological deterioration due to the technique was recorded in one patient, no permanent neurological deficit was observed in this series and there were no deaths. It is believed that this new technology is a viable alternative in the management of patients with high-risk intracranial saccular aneurysms. It may also play an important role in the occlusion of aneurysms in the acute phase of subarachnoid hemorrhage. 
Cardiovascular risk factors in young snuff-users and cigarette smokers. We studied cardiovascular risk factors in 21 young men who were habitual snuff-users, and compared them with the same risk factors in 18 non-tobacco-users and 19 cigarette smokers of the same age and body mass index. Both snuff-users and smokers showed increased levels of alcohol and coffee consumption and a decreased level of physical exercise compared to non-users. Both groups of tobacco-users showed increased serum insulin levels compared to the control group at similar blood glucose concentrations. In contrast to the smokers, snuff-users showed no significant elevation of diastolic blood pressure, haemoglobin concentrations, white cell count, serum cholesterol or triglyceride levels. Snuff users had higher plasma fibrinogen levels than non-users (P = 0.07). The use of snuff by young men appears to have less impact than smoking on cardiovascular risk factors, with the possible exception of elevated serum insulin and plasma fibrinogen levels. 
Cold cerebroplegia. A new technique of cerebral protection during operations on the transverse aortic arch. Profound hypothermia associated with circulatory arrest is the commonest method of cerebral protection during operations on the aortic arch. This technique allows a limited time to perform the aortic repair, however. It also necessitates prolonged cardiopulmonary bypass to rewarm the patient. This may be the cause of coagulation disorders or infection. Selective perfusion of the carotid arteries can also be used. When the perfusion is derived from the main arterial line, however, the repair of the aorta requires that the vessel be crossclamped, and cannot be performed in an "open, bloodless" manner. To avoid the disadvantages of both techniques, we have developed a new technique of cerebral protection. After a regular cardiopulmonary bypass has been established, the carotid arteries are cannulated and perfused with blood cooled at 6 degrees to 12 degrees C, through a separate heat exchanger, while the core temperature is maintained at moderate hypothermia (25 degrees to 28 degrees C, rectal). To perform the "open" distal repair, the cardiopulmonary bypass is discontinued while the carotid perfusion is maintained (250 to 350 ml/min). When the distal repair is completed, cardiopulmonary bypass is resumed and the carotid perfusion is discontinued. Between 1984 and June 1989, 54 patients (mean age 55 years) were operated on with this method (45 elective operations, 9 emergency procedures). Mean duration of cardiopulmonary bypass was 121 minutes (65 to 248), and mean duration of circulatory arrest was 22 minutes (10 to 51). The electroencephalogram, routinely recorded, showed return of the cerebral activity after a mean time of 12 minutes and normal activity after a mean time of 66 minutes. There was no intraoperative death. Hospital mortality rate was 13% (7/54). One death was related to neurologic disorders. All patients but one awakened normally within 8 hours after operation. Two patients (4.3%) experienced a transient neurologic episode (lateral hemianopia) 9 and 11 days postoperatively. There was no hemorrhagic complication (24-hour average blood loss: 840 +/- 540 ml). In our experience the technique of "cold cerebroplegia" has been demonstrated to provide excellent cerebral protection. It requires no prolonged cardiopulmonary bypass and does not limit the time necessary to perform the aortic repair. It may be considered as a safe alternative to profound hypothermia associated with circulatory arrest. 
The long QT syndrome. Prospective longitudinal study of 328 families. BACKGROUND. The Long QT Syndrome (LQTS) is an infrequently occurring familial disorder in which affected individuals have electrocardiographic QT interval prolongation and a propensity to ventricular tachyarrhythmic syncope and sudden death. We prospectively investigated the clinical characteristics and the long-term course of 3,343 individuals from 328 families in which one or more members were identified as affected with LQTS (QTc greater than 0.44 sec1/2). METHODS AND RESULTS. The first member of a family to be identified with LQTS, the proband, was usually brought to medical attention because of a syncopal episode during childhood or teenage years. Probands (n = 328) were younger at first contact (age 21 +/- 15 years), more likely to be female (69%), and had a higher frequency of preenrollment syncope or cardiac arrest with resuscitation (80%), congenital deafness (7%), a resting heart rate less than 60 beats/min (31%), QTc greater than or equal to 0.50 sec1/2 (52%), and a history of ventricular tachyarrhythmia (47%) than other affected (n = 688) and unaffected (n = 1,004) family members. Arrhythmogenic syncope often occurred in association with acute physical, emotional, or auditory arousal. The syncopal episodes were frequently misinterpreted as a seizure disorder. By age 12 years, 50% of the probands had experienced at least one syncopal episode or death. The rates of postenrollment syncope (one or more episodes) and probable LQTS-related death (before age 50 years) for probands (n = 235; average follow-up 54 months per patient) were 5.0% per year and 0.9% per year, respectively; these event rates were considerably higher than those observed among affected and unaffected family members. CONCLUSIONS. Among 232 probands and 1,264 family members with prospective follow-up, three factors made significant independent contributions to the risk of subsequent syncope or probable LQTS-related death before age 50 years, whichever occurred first (Cox hazard ratio; 95% confidence limits): 1) QTc (1.052; 1.017, 1.088), 2) history of cardiac event (3.1; 1.3, 7.2), and 3) heart rate (1.017; 1.004, 1.031). The findings from this prospective longitudinal study highlight the clinical features, risk factors, and course of LQTS. 
Relationship between foot transcutaneous oxygen tension and ankle systolic blood pressure at rest and following exercise. To determine whether foot transcutaneous oxygen tension (TcPO2) and ankle systolic blood pressure (SBP) measure similar aspects of peripheral vascular occlusive disease (PVOD), the authors examined their relationship at rest and following treadmill exercise. Thirty-seven PVOD patients (mean age 69.2 +/- 0.8 years) rested supine for twenty minutes, followed by a progressive treadmill walking test at a constant speed of 2 mph. The initial grade was 0%; this increased 2% every two minutes until maximal claudication pain (n = 19) or until the occurrence of such limiting symptoms as volitional fatigue (n = 6), ST segment depression (n = 4), dyspnea (n = 3), multiple premature ventricular contractions (n = 2), and angina (n = 2). Patients then rested supine for fifteen minutes. Foot TcPO2 was recorded before, during, and after exercise, whereas ankle SBP was measured before and after exercise. At rest, a curvilinear relationship was found between foot TcPO2 and ankle SBP (foot TcPO2 = 41.89 + 0.22(ankle SBP) + 0.0005 (ankle SBP2); SEE = 9.2, R = 0.64, R2 = 0.41, p less than 0.001). In contrast, the relationship was stronger and more linear during recovery, particularly at the sixth minute (foot TcPO2) = 8.33 + 0.35 (ankle SBP); SEE = 13.6, R = 0.86, R2 = 0.73, p less than 0.001). At rest, foot TcPO2 and ankle SBP characterized different aspects of PVOD because they shared only 41% common variance. During recovery, they provided similar information because up to 73% of the variance was shared. It is concluded that foot TcPO2 should also be used to assess PVOD patients because unique information is obtained at rest and values can be recorded during exercise. 
Long-term effectiveness of nonpharmacological treatment of hypertension. Various nonpharmacological therapies reduce the blood pressure of a significant portion of both patients with established hypertension and people who are considered to be at high risk for the development of hypertension; that is, they are secondary and primary preventions. Of the various therapies, weight reduction, sodium restriction, moderation of alcohol intake, and regular aerobic exercise have been shown to be most effective, whereas the effectiveness of other practices has been less uniform or smaller in degree. Changes in lifestyle, mainly involving diet and physical activity, should be widely used to treat and, hopefully, to prevent hypertension. 
Nonspecific findings on MR imaging. The importance of correlative studies and clinical information. Although magnetic resonance (MR) imaging is highly sensitive for the detection of abnormalities of the musculoskeletal system, changes in marrow and soft-tissue signal intensity are often nonspecific, and benign conditions may be mistaken for malignancy. In an effort to identify the cause of this type of misdiagnosis in MR examinations, the MR scans were reviewed of 30 patients whose images manifested bone and/or soft-tissue changes that were initially believed to be consistent with malignancy but were later found to represent benign conditions. Of the 30 patients, MR abnormalities were attributable to trauma in 11, benign tumors and tumorlike conditions in ten, infection in seven, and prior radiotherapy in two. In 24 cases, correlative imaging studies (14 patients), appropriate clinical history (six patients), and/or physical and laboratory examinations (four patients) would have avoided these misdiagnoses. 
Ureteral catheter tip separation: potential risk using the open-end Flexi-Tip ureteral catheter. Ureteral catheters are a vital part of the urological armamentarium. We report 2 cases in which the flexible tip portion of an open-end Flexi-Tip ureteral catheter became disjointed from the shaft within the renal collecting system during endourological procedures. The etiology, prevention and management of this complication are discussed. 
The effect of quadriceps excision on functional results after distal femoral resection and prosthetic replacement of bone tumors. Although resection and reconstruction with a prosthesis is an accepted form of treatment for tumors of the distal femur, minimal effort has been made to correlate the functional result with the degree of adjacent muscle excision. From 1983 to 1986, 65 patients had distal femoral resection and prosthetic reconstruction. Ten patients had only the vastus intermedius excised (Group A), 30 patients had excision of the vastus intermedius plus either the vastus medialis or lateralis (Group B), nine patients had only the rectus femoris spared (Group C), and 16 patients had the entire quadriceps excised or conversion of the previous arthrodesis (Group D). Based on the rating system of the Musculoskeletal Tumor Society, satisfactory results were obtained in 70% of Group A patients (30% excellent and 40% good), with no poor results. In group B, 80% had good or excellent results and 7% poor results. In Group C, 78% of the patients had good results but no excellent results, whereas Group D had only 50% satisfactory results. The parameters that most often led to functional impairment were restricted motion and inadequate extensor powers. Muscle transfers, however, (flexors to extensors) were effective only in Group C patients. With proper technique and prosthetic design, satisfactory results can be achieved after distal femoral resection and prosthetic reconstruction, even after extensive quadriceps excision. 
Surgical repair of rectovaginal fistulas in patients with Crohn's disease: transvaginal approach. The surgical management of rectovaginal fistulas complicating Crohn's disease has been associated with unacceptably high failure rates. We sought to modify the available surgical techniques to provide a solution to this challenging problem. Between December 1983 and January 1990, 14 patients with Crohn's disease underwent repair of a rectovaginal fistula. A modified transvaginal approach was employed by the authors. A diverting loop ileostomy was performed on all patients, either as the initial step in the staged management of intractable perianal disease or concurrent with the repair of the rectovaginal fistula. The fistula was completely eradicated in 13 of the 14 women and did not recur during the mean follow-up period of 55.0 months (range, 3-77 months). Intestinal continuity was reestablished in these 13 patients within 6 months after the initial fistula repair. One patient with a very low-lying fistula constituted our only failure. We have found the transvaginal method preferable to the transanal approach because of the relative ease in raising the vaginal flap as compared with a flap of fibrotic and inflamed anorectal mucosa. On the basis of this study, we conclude that a modified transvaginal approach is an effective method for repair of rectovaginal fistulas secondary to Crohn's disease. 
Malignant neoplasia of the paranasal sinuses associated with mucocele. Paranasal sinus mucoceles are histologically benign and typically cause ophthalmic morbidity only after significant orbital extension. The authors describe seven patients who had both a mucocele and a malignant tumor in the same paranasal sinus and in whom the neoplasm was discovered incidentally during operation for mucocele. Although malignancy coexistent with paranasal sinus mucocele is uncommon, the association should be considered and appropriate biopsy specimens obtained if operation for mucocele is required. 
Detection of micrometastatic tumor cells in bone marrow of breast carcinoma patients. To determine the incidence and clinical significance of micrometastases in the bone marrow of breast carcinoma patients, we performed an immunoalkaline phosphatase assay using anticytokeratin (AE1, AE3, MAK-6) and antiepithelial (113F1, 260F9, 317G5) antibodies on the bone marrow aspirates of 71 stage IV disease patients with either recurrent regional or distant metastases. Although we detected tumor cells within the bone marrow of 38% of these patients with this assay, no significant correlation was seen with patient's age, menopausal status, bone scan, bone marrow core histology, response to induction chemotherapy, number of metastatic sites, dominant site of metastasis, or subsequent clinical outcome. The clinical parameters that were associated with improved survival were one dominant site of metastatic disease and regional soft tissue recurrence without distant disease. 
Echocardiography and Doppler ultrasound in the evaluation of pericardial disease. Echocardiography and Doppler ultrasound are useful in evaluating a variety of pathological conditions affecting the pericardium. Cardiac tamponade results in right atrial collapse and right ventricular diastolic collapse detectable by echocardiography. These echocardiographic signs have a high degree of sensitivity and specificity. False-negative echocardiographic studies may be seen in patients with pulmonary hypertension, and false-positive studies for cardiac tamponade may occur in severe hypovolemia. Although cardiac tamponade is usually caused by pericardial effusion, less commonly intrapericardial clot may result in hemodynamic compromise. Pericardial clot may be echogenic, and hence the diagnosis potentially can be missed. If the intrapericardial clot is localized, the classic echocardiographic signs of pericardial effusion may be absent, and a localized mass may be seen on the echocardiogram. Increased respiratory variation in transvalvular blood flow velocities detectable by Doppler ultrasound is found in cardiac tamponade. Doppler ultrasound studies may be particularly useful in those patients in whom the characteristic echocardiographic abnormalities are absent. Both M-mode and two-dimensional echocardiography may be useful in diagnosing pericardial thickening. Constrictive pericarditis results in a variety of echocardiographic abnormalities including pericardial thickening; biatrial enlargement with good left ventricular function; a diastolic septal bounce; and a dilated inferior vena cava without significant respiratory variation. Doppler echocardiographic abnormalities are commonly found in constrictive pericarditis. Echocardiography is also useful as a guide to performing pericardiocentesis and in the detection of pericardial adhesions and pericardial metastases. 
Pericardial actinomycosis: case report and review. Pericardial actinomycosis is rare and frequently goes unrecognized during life, a circumstance due in part to a paucity of clinical manifestations and to a low rate of positivity in cultures. We present a case report of pericardial actinomycosis and a review of 18 other cases reported in the literature since 1950. Possible risk factors include aspiration pneumonia, alcohol abuse, and periodontal disease. Actinomyces may cause purulent pericarditis that evolves into cardiac tamponade or constrictive pericarditis. Clues to the identity of the causative organism (e.g., draining sinus tracts and the presence of sulfur granules) are frequently absent, and cultures often fail to yield the organism. Histologic examination of material obtained by biopsy is often necessary to make the diagnosis. Most cases originate from a thoracopulmonary site of actinomycosis and spread directly to the pericardium. Widespread dissemination to extrathoracic organs is uncommon. Treatment consists of high-dose, long-term antimicrobial therapy as well as drainage of the pericardial space. 
Left ventricular hypertrophy in hypertension. Major advances in left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) and hypertension have occurred in recent years. The ability to diagnose LVH has been improved by echocardiography, and with this technique it has been shown that evidence of LVH is an important independent risk factor for cardiovascular disease. The major cause of death in patients with hypertension and LVH is coronary artery disease. Therefore an understanding of the interrelationships between these two disorders is fundamental, and it is now clear that the hypertrophied ventricle is vulnerable to myocardial ischemia. Appreciation of the mechanisms of sudden death has also increased, although the exact situation in patients with LVH remains to be clarified. Regression of LVH is known to occur with the use of several different antihypertensive drugs. Recent studies indicate that the calcium blocking agent nicardipine, in addition to beta-blocking drugs and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, brings about LVH regression without any deterioration of left ventricular function. However, further studies are needed to assess the long-term benefits of this regression. 
Erythropoietin deficiency after coronary artery bypass procedures. Erythropoietin is the primary regulator of erythropoiesis. Erythropoietin has been shown to increase exponentially in response to linear decreases in hematocrit in normal, unstressed animals. However, the effect of operation, with its attendant stress, on erythropoietin levels is unknown. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effect of surgical stress on erythropoietin. Twenty otherwise healthy patients scheduled for elective surgical procedures were studied. The cholecystectomy group included 10 patients who underwent cholecystectomy for documented stone disease. Ten patients who underwent coronary artery bypass procedures constituted the coronary artery bypass grafting group. Patients were studied preoperatively as well as on the first and second postoperative days. The hematocrit and erythropoietin levels were similar in both groups preoperatively. The hematocrit in the coronary artery bypass grafting group was lower than that of the cholecystectomy group on postoperative day 1 (0.31 versus 0.36; p less than 0.003) and postoperative day 2 (0.30 versus 0.36; p less than 0.001). During the first two postoperative days the erythropoietin levels were similar between groups. The data show that postoperative erythropoietin levels are similar after coronary artery bypass grafting, despite more severe anemia, when compared with cholecystectomy. This suggests that after coronary artery bypass grafting there is a relative deficiency of erythropoietin. Administration of recombinant human erythropoietin to patients undergoing surgical procedures could correct the erythropoietin deficiency and accelerate postoperative erythropoiesis. 
Ruling out acute myocardial infarction. A prospective multicenter validation of a 12-hour strategy for patients at low risk BACKGROUND. Although previous investigations have suggested that 24 hours is required to exclude acute myocardial infarction in patients who are admitted to a coronary care unit for the evaluation of acute chest pain, we hypothesized that a 12-hour period might be adequate for patients with a low probability of infarction at the time of admission. METHODS. Using a Bayesian model, we developed a strategy to identify candidates for a shorter period of observation from an analysis of a derivation set of 976 patients with acute chest pain who were admitted to three teaching and four community hospitals. In the derivation set, patients whose clinical characteristics in the emergency room predicted a low (less than or equal to 7 percent) probability of myocardial infarction had only a 0.4 percent risk of infarction if they had neither abnormal levels of cardiac enzymes nor recurrent ischemic pain during the first 12 hours of hospitalization. In an independent testing set of 2684 patients from the seven hospitals, 957 admitted patients (36 percent) were classified as candidates for this 12-hour period of observation according to a previously published multivariate algorithm. Few of these patients were actually transferred from a monitored setting at 12 hours. RESULTS. Of the 771 candidates for a 12-hour period of observation who did not have enzyme abnormalities or recurrent pain during the first 12 hours, 4 (0.5 percent) were subsequently found to have acute myocardial infarction, and only 3 (0.4 percent) died after primary cardiac arrests, all of which occurred three to five days after admission. Rates of other major cardiovascular complications were low in the patients who might have been transferred from the coronary care unit after 12 hours with this strategy. In patients with a higher initial risk of infarction, the standard strategy of 24-hour observation identified all but 11 of 739 acute myocardial infarctions (1 percent). CONCLUSIONS. Emergency room clinical data can be used to identify a large subgroup of patients for whom a 12-hour period of observation is normally sufficient to exclude acute myocardial infarction. Patient-specific evaluation and treatment can then proceed without the restrictions imposed by "rule-out" protocols for myocardial infarction. 
Cholesterol screening management of Florida's pediatric population. The current cholesterol screening and management of Florida's pediatric population is evaluated utilizing a questionnaire mailed to 1,534 pediatric health care providers. Twenty percent of the physicians responded. Of the respondents, 65% do not routinely screen for the presence of hypercholesterolemia. Only 28% of the respondents obtain serum total cholesterol measurements in accordance with the American Academy of Pediatrics Committee on Nutrition recommendations. The serum total cholesterol concentration prompting treatment was 240 mg/dL (6.2 mM). Dietary counseling alone, or in combination with exercise, was the initial treatment approach recommended by 98% of the responding physicians. Dietary education for the hypercholesterolemic patient was provided by both dieticians (46%) and physicians (42%). If the initial dietary intervention was unsuccessful, 48% of the physicians would begin medical therapy. The most commonly prescribed medication was a bile acid sequestrant (70%), with the majority (52%) referring their patient to a subspecialist for evaluation and care. 
Flashlamp-pumped pulsed dye laser for port-wine stains in infancy: earlier versus later treatment. Twelve children, 6 to 30 weeks of age (average 14.9 weeks), with port-wine stains of the head and neck were treated with the flashlamp-pumped pulsed dye laser at 585 nm and 450 microsecond pulse duration. Ten of 12 patients (83%) showed more than 50% lightening of their port-wine stains after 2.9 treatment sessions (2.9 +/- 1.4 [+/- standard deviation]). Forty-five percent of the patients demonstrated 75% or more lightening of their lesions after a mean of 3.8 treatments (+/- 1.6). No lesions in this group cleared completely after a mean of 2.8 treatments. Treated skin was identical in texture to normal skin in all patients. There was no evidence of depressed scars, atrophy, hyperpigmentation, or hypopigmentation in the treated areas. These results indicate that pulsed dye laser treatment of port-wine stains can be undertaken safely in infancy. 
Diffuse melanosis in metastatic malignant melanoma. The skin of a patient with diffuse melanosis as a result of malignant melanoma was examined by light microscopy, immunohistochemistry, and electron microscopy. Our findings indicate that the slate-blue discoloration in this patient was due to pigment deposition in dermal macrophages and endothelial cells. Multiple attempts to identify disseminated metastatic melanoma cells were unsuccessful. 
Intraoperative electron beam radiation therapy for primary locally advanced rectal and rectosigmoid carcinoma. To improve local control and survival in patients with primary locally advanced rectal and rectosigmoid carcinoma, intraoperative electron beam radiation therapy (IORT) has been used with a combination of moderate- to high-dose preoperative radiation therapy and surgical resection. Sixty-five patients underwent resection with the intention of using IORT if areas at high risk for local recurrence were apparent at surgery. For 20 patients undergoing complete resection with IORT, the 5-year actuarial local control and disease-free survival (DFS) was 88% and 53%, respectively. The results for 22 patients with pathologically documented residual carcinoma were less satisfactory with a 5-year actuarial local control and DFS of 60% and 32%, respectively. In this latter group, local control and DFS correlated with the extent of residual disease: patients with only microscopic disease had a 5-year actuarial local control and DFS of 69% and 47%, respectively, whereas for patients with macroscopic disease, these figures were 50% and 17%, respectively. For 18 patients undergoing complete resection without IORT or additional postoperative radiation therapy, the 5-year actuarial local control and DFS was 67% and 53%, respectively. Because local failure will occur in at least 30% of patients undergoing partial resection with or without IORT as well as patients undergoing complete resection of advanced tumors without IORT, additional postoperative radiation therapy should be considered. 
Parameters for and safety of contact Nd:YAG laser irradiation of early gastric cancer: an in vitro study. Early gastric cancers have been treated by endoscopic contact Nd:YAG laser irradiation. The extent of thermal damage produced by this laser system has been inadequately investigated. In an in vitro study we have shown that contact laser probes produce consistent and reproducible thermal lesions in the human stomach wall. Contact laser energies of 40 to 60 joules are optimal for the ablation of early gastric cancer. Energies greater than 90 joules are associated with a high incidence of gastric perforation. Contact laser probes may have advantages over non-contact laser techniques for the endoscopic treatment of early gastric cancer in patients who are unfit for major surgery. 
Toxicity and immunomodulatory effects of interleukin-2 after autologous bone marrow transplantation for hematologic malignancies. Autologous bone marrow transplantation (ABMT) for advanced hematologic malignancies is associated with high relapse rates. Interleukin-2 (IL-2) and lymphokine-activated killer (LAK) cells represent a potentially non-cross-resistant therapeutic modality that might prevent or delay relapses if used early after ABMT at a time when the tumor burden is minimal. However, high-dose chemoradiotherapy and ABMT might increase patients' susceptibility to IL-2 toxicity, and might interfere with immunologic responses to IL-2 in vivo. Therefore, to determine safety, tolerance, and immunomodulatory effects of IL-2 therapy early after ABMT, IL-2 was administered by continuous intravenous infusion to 16 patients 14 to 91 days (median, 33) after ABMT for acute leukemia, lymphoma, or multiple myeloma. Patients were sequentially assigned to escalating IL-2 "induction" doses (0.3 to 4.5 x 10(6) U/m2/d, days 1 to 5), and all patients received a nonescalating IL-2 "maintenance" dose (0.3 x 10(6) U/m2/d, days 12 to 21). Most patients exhibited mild to moderate fever, nausea, diarrhea, and/or skin rash with IL-2 infusions. The maximum tolerated "induction" dose was 3.0 x 10(6) U/m2/d; dose-limiting toxicities were hypotension and thrombocytopenia. All toxicities reversed on stopping the IL-2 infusions, and all patients completed "maintenance." Postinfusion lymphocytosis was exhibited by patients at all IL-2 dose levels. With the higher IL-2 doses, increased percentages of patients' PBMC expressed CD16 and CD56, with augmented lysis of K562 and Daudi, reflecting the induction of natural killer and circulating LAK effector activities. Increased LAK precursor activity was exhibited by patients at all IL-2 dose levels. Thus, the IL-2 therapy regimen was safely tolerated after ABMT, and pronounced immunomodulatory effects were observed with the higher IL-2 doses. These studies support the planned use of IL-2 and LAK cells after ABMT in an attempt to reduce relapses of advanced hematologic malignancies. 
The pathogenesis of hypertension: black-white differences. In summary, for reasons that are not clear, some persons seem to be extremely good at retaining sodium on a high-sodium diet or poor at excreting sodium on a high-sodium intake. This is more frequent in Western hemisphere blacks than in whites in the West or in blacks in Africa. These geographic/ethnic differences in sodium handling ability may be related to environmental factors or, more likely, to inherited differences in the ability to conserve sodium based on the evolutionary principle of survival fo the fittest for the ability to conserve sodium. The frequency of this salt-conserving (thrifty) genotype in Western hemisphere blacks may have been further increased as a consequence of severe selection pressures for survival based on the ability to conserve sodium during the slavery period of history in the West. One characteristic of the blood pressure control systems of Western hemisphere blacks is suppression of plasma renin activity without suppression of aldosterone production. In addition there is greater nephrosclerosis in blacks than whites and a more rapid decline in creatinine clearance with age. When more sodium is ingested than the kidneys are able to handle (excrete), there is a (transient) slight positive sodium balance; as a result sodium, chloride, and water are retained, resulting in an expansion of plasma volume (Fig. 7-3). The initial physiologic responses include (increased) secretion of atrial natriuretic peptides and the digitalis-like substance (natriuretic hormone), and inhibition of vasopressin and aldosterone secretion. The net effect is directly enhanced natriuresis and diuresis, and a reduction in plasma volume, with no significant effect on blood pressure. However, if there is a continuing tendency to sodium retention and volume expansion, the capacity of the aforementioned mechanisms to control plasma volume will be exceeded; then, the chronically elevated level of the digitalis-like substance will inhibit the sodium pumps in the arterial and venous smooth muscle cells and in the sympathetic neurons. The increased venous tone will help to reduce plasma volume directly by reducing central venous volume. Arterial tone will be increased by direct action of the digitalis-like substance on the arterial smooth muscle and, indirectly, via the hormone's action on the sympathetic neurons. Initially, of course, blood pressure will be maintained in the normal range (but will be labile) because of the compensating cardiovascular reflexes. Once the capacity of these reflexes to control blood pressure is exceeded, however, the blood pressure will begin to rise; this will induce a pressure natriuresis to help restore plasma volume to normal.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS). 
Complications of transurethral electro-incision of posterior urethral valves. The development of dense urethral strictures following transurethral resection of posterior urethral valves is a well known complication, especially in the neonate. In 85 boys with posterior urethral valves no strictures were found during follow-up. Urinary incontinence associated with transurethral incision occurred in 3 patients and a small urethral diverticulum was found in 1. The complication rate associated with the transurethral incision itself was 5%. Our technique for transurethral incision of posterior urethral valves is described. 
Intraaortic balloon pumping as the postangioplasty strategy in acute myocardial infarction. To assess the usefulness of intraaortic balloon pumping (IABP) in acute myocardial infarction (AMI), 114 patients with anterior AMI undergoing emergency percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA) for total occlusion of the left anterior descending artery were studied. After successful PTCA 66 patients were treated with conventional therapy (group I), and 48 patients were treated with IABP for 25 +/- 8 hours (group II). The reocclusion rate was significantly lower in group II (2.4% vs 17.7% p less than 0.05). An increase in ejection fraction in group II compared with group I was marginally significant (4.5 +/- 12.2% vs 9.2 +/- 13.0%, p = 0.08). Vascular complications occurred in two patients, but there were no deaths from IABP. These results suggest that after successful PTCA for acute myocardial infarction, IABP prevents reocclusion and may add strength to reperfusion in the improvement of left ventricular function. 
Is adjuvant chemotherapy necessary for patients with stage B1 testicular cancer? Controversy exists concerning the role of adjunctive chemotherapy in patients with regional nodal involvement. A randomized study reported a 48% relapse rate for patients with positive nodes (stage B1 or stage B2), all of whom were salvaged by full-dose platinum-based chemotherapy. In a series of patients with positive nodes who received two cycles of adjunctive chemotherapy postoperatively, the relapse rate was only 2%. In order to evaluate the effect of retroperitoneal lymph node dissection on relapse rates in patients with stage B1 testicular cancer, a retrospective review of a series of 39 patients was performed. Criteria for inclusion included pathologic stage B1 (less than six positive nodes, located in the primary landing site, with no node greater than 2 cm in diameter and no extracapsular lymph node extension). Patients who fulfilled the criteria along with normalization of tumor markers were followed-up expectantly after retroperitoneal lymph node dissection. Thirty-nine patients were followed from 1 to 10 years with the median duration of follow-up of 3.5 years. Ten of the 39 patients had modified retroperitoneal lymph node dissections with preservation of antegrade ejaculation. The other 29 had full retroperitoneal lymph node dissections. Three relapses were seen, one patient with retrocrural and pulmonary metastases and two patients with pulmonary metastases only for a relapse rate of 8% (three of 39). Patients with stage B2 disease received adjunctive chemotherapy with two or three cycles of platinum-based chemotherapy. We conclude that retroperitoneal lymph node dissection alone is adequate treatment for the majority of patients with pathologic stage B1 testicular cancer. In that subset of patients, adjunctive chemotherapy should be reserved for relapse.
