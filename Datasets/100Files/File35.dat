2	Increased cholecystectomy rates in Saudi Arabia Gallstones have become increasingly prevalent in Saudi Arabia, where cholecystectomy is now one of the commonest major abdominal operations. 2854 people underwent cholecystectomy in the 14 hospitals of the country's Eastern Province in the years 1977 to 1986. During this period the overall frequency of cholecystectomy increased by 978%, a finding not explained by the 67% increase in population or the 87% increase in other operations. Simultaneously, the average daily individual consumption of total calories, fat, and sugar increased by 81%, 197%, and 164%, respectively, and consumption of high-fibre grain fell by 75%. This striking increase in the frequency of cholecystectomy, which presumably reflects the incidence of gallstones, cannot be explained by demographic changes and seems more closely linked to the concomitant changes in dietary habits. 
5	Perianal abscess and fistula-in-ano in children. The authors present a retrospective review of 40 pediatric patients with perianal abscess and/or fistula-in-ano. The total patient population could be divided clinically into 2 broad groups. The first group consisted of 22 infants younger than 2 years of age, all of whom were males, and 10 of whom presented with recurrences after previous incision and drainage. Of the 14 infants presenting with an abscess, in 12 (85.7 percent), a fistula-in-ano was discovered at surgery. In contrast, in the group of 18 children older than 2 years of age, there were 7 females and 11 males, and fistulas were identified in only 7 of 13 patients (54.8 percent) who presented with abscesses. Surgical treatment consisted of examination under anesthesia and a diligent search for a fistulous tract. Abscesses were primarily saucerized and fistulotomy and cryptotomy of the confluent crypt was performed if a fistulous tract was identified. The only recurrences with this form of treatment occurred in the two immunocompromised patients. 
1	Incidence of polymyositis-dermatomyositis: a 20-year study of hospital diagnosed cases in Allegheny County, PA 1963-1982. The incidence of hospital diagnosed polymyositis-dermatomyositis (PM-DM) among residents of Pittsburgh and Allegheny County, PA was determined from 1963 to 1982. Medical records of all Allegheny County hospitals were searched for patients diagnosed PM-DM, and each accepted case was reviewed and verified by a physician, according to specified criteria. Direct age adjusted incidence rates were computed for race and sex, as new cases/million population/year, with the 1970 Allegheny County population as the standard. One hundred seventy-seven cases were identified during this 20-year survey for a total annual incidence of 5.5/million population. Incidence more than tripled during 1973-1982 compared to the first decade of study, with the greatest increase occurring in black women. Overall, the female to male incidence ratio was 2.2:1, but during the childbearing years (ages 15-44) this ratio increased to greater than 5:1 in both races. Detection of PM-DM is increasing, as shown by temporal trends. Although our series has significantly more adult PM and less DM and overlap cases than other published studies, annual incidence is similar to that reported in other locales. 
4	Intraoperative coronary artery endarterectomy with excimer laser. Compared with continuous-wave lasers, excimer lasers exhibit several in vitro advantages: nonthermal ablation process and linear relation between the number of pulses and the depth of the crater. A 308 nm, 20 nsec pulse duration, 1 to 5 repetition rate laser was specifically designed for clinical application. At the time of cardiopulmonary bypass in 10 symptomatic patients, before bypass grafting, a 1 mm diameter core specifically ultraviolet-tipped fiberoptic scope was introduced via the coronary arteriotomy and placed upstream (seven patients) and downstream (three patients) in contact with the stenosis. Laser power was increasingly delivered up to the clearing of the stenosis or occlusion. Quality of angioplasty was controlled by calibration of the neolumen, cardioplegic solution output through the laser-treated segment, and an eighth day or sixth month coronary arteriogram. In the first three patients studied on the eighth day, all laser-treated coronary artery segments showed an early parallel-linked patent neolumen despite competitive bypass graft flow. In the patients studied after 6 months, all recanalized segments were patent except one; in one patient the venous graft was occluded, but the upstream laser angioplasty was patent. The main limitation of the method lies in the fact that laser coronary recanalization is confined to the fiber core diameter. We conclude that (1) excimer laser angioplasty may be safe and efficient during surgical procedure and (2) as catheter flexibility remains the most critical problem, we are now assuming an appropriate tool with a multifiber system that is suitable for intraoperative as well as percutaneous routes. 
4	Calcium entry blockade and adrenergic vascular reactivity in hypertensives: differences between nicardipine and diltiazem. The interference of nicardipine and diltiazem infused into the brachial artery at systemically ineffective rates, with the forearm vascular response to graded exogenous norepinephrine, was evaluated in hypertensive patients. Nicardipine (1 and 3 micrograms/dl forearm tissue/min in both absence and presence of propranolol) increased forearm blood flow (venous plethysmography) and antagonized dose dependently the vasoconstrictor effect of norepinephrine, suggesting that functional alpha-antagonism may participate in the vasodilating and possibly the antihypertensive effect of the drug. On the contrary, no antagonism but rather potentiation of the responses to norepinephrine occurred after diltiazem (0.5 and 1 microgram/dl forearm tissue/min). Because intra-arterial propranolol abolished that potentiating action of the drug, whereas the local vasodilation to isoproterenol was clearly reduced, diltiazem probably interfered with beta-adrenergic receptor-mediated vasorelaxing mechanisms in human forearm arterioles. The data further stress the heterogeneity of calcium entry blockers in humans. 
2	Impact of active immunisation against enteritis necroticans in Papua New Guinea. Enteritis necroticans, known locally as pigbel, has been a major cause of illness and death among children in the highlands of Papua New Guinea. After a successful trial of active immunisation against the beta toxin of the causative organism, Clostridium perfringens type C, immunisation of children was begun in 1980. The effects of the immunisation programme on pigbel admissions in 3 of the 5 major highland hospitals were assessed. In each of the centres studied the proportion of admissions due to enteritis necroticans dropped significantly after immunisation was introduced (p less than 0.001) and hospital admissions for pigbel in 1984-86, when immunisation was well established, were less than one fifth of previous figures. 
5	Intrarectal ultrasonography in rectal cancer staging and in the evaluation of pelvic disease. Clinical uses of intrarectal ultrasound. Accurate preoperative staging of a rectal cancer patient may impact heavily on subsequent management. This study attempts to evaluate the accuracy of intrarectal ultrasonography (IRUS) in staging rectal cancers compared to clinical and pathologic examination. In addition the accuracy of IRUS was assessed in a group of patients with uncertain pelvic-perirectal disease after a negative physical examination. In a prospective manner, 52 cancer patients were staged with digital exam and IRUS. Accuracy rates were 48% and 83%, respectively, compared to pathologic evaluation in assessing wall penetration, and IRUS identified positive lymph nodes in 12 of 17 cases. In patients with pelvic disease, IRUS corresponded with pathologic diagnosis in 15 of 17 cases and revealed new information in 6 patients. Intrarectal ultrasonography appears to be the most accurate imaging technique for staging rectal cancers and demonstrates promise in the evaluation of perirectal-pelvic disease. 
3	Phenotypic variability in glutaric aciduria type I: Report of fourteen cases in five Canadian Indian kindreds. We describe 14 patients with glutaric aciduria type 1 in five Canadian Indian kindreds living in Manitoba and northwest Ontario. The patients had marked clinical variability of the disease, even within families. Eight followed the typical clinical course of normal early growth and development until the onset of neurologic abnormalities, often precipitated by infection, between 6 weeks and 7 1/2 months of age. Five patients had early developmental delay; one was thought to be normal until 8 years of age. Three patients died, seven are severely mentally and physically handicapped, and four have only mild mental retardation or incoordination. Six patients had macrocephaly in the neonatal period. Computed tomography was done for 12 patients, and findings were abnormal in 11. Glutaric acid and 3-hydroxyglutaric acid were detected in increased amounts in the urine of all patients, but the concentrations were much lower than those in most other reported patients. Glutaryl coenzyme A dehydrogenase activity in skin fibroblasts, interleukin-2-dependent lymphocytes, or both, ranged from 0% to 13% of control values. There was no correlation between clinical severity and urine glutaric acid concentration or level of residual enzyme activity. We recommend that organic acid analysis of the urine be done in patients with unexplained cerebral palsy-like disorders, especially if the computed tomographic scan is abnormal. If there is suspicion of glutaric aciduria, glutaryl-coenzyme A dehydrogenase should be measured in fibroblasts or lymphocytes even if glutaric acid is not increased in the urine. 
5	Acceleration of luteinizing hormone pulse frequency in functional hypothalamic amenorrhea by dopaminergic blockade. A constellation of neuroendocrine secretory aberrations, including reduced LH pulse frequency and PRL concentrations, has been documented in women with functional hypothalamic amenorrhea (FHA). As pituitary function was preserved, these aberrations were attributed to an alteration in hypothalamic neuromodulation. To investigate the participation of the dopaminergic system in the genesis of the reduced LH pulse frequency and suppressed PRL levels in FHA, we studied six women with FHA and six cyclic women in the early follicular phase by obtaining blood samples at 15-min intervals for 48 h during sequential 24-h infusions of saline and a dopamine receptor blocker, metoclopramide (MCP). A hypothalamic vs. pituitary site of action was inferred from the pulsatility characteristics. MCP consistently elicited an increase in the LH pulse frequency in the women with FHA [7.3 +/- 1.2 (+/- SE) to 10.5 +/- 1.3 pulses/24 h; P less than 0.005]. In contrast, the eumenorrheic women did not show a significant change in LH pulse frequency in response to MCP (15.2 +/- 1.0 to 14.3 +/- 0.9 pulses/24 h). While the PRL concentrations were significantly lower in the FHA group during the infusion of saline (P less than 0.001) and MCP (P less than 0.005), the relative increases in PRL during MCP were similar in both groups. The acceleration of LH pulse frequency by blockade of dopamine receptors implies that there is increased hypothalamic dopaminergic inhibition of GnRH pulse frequency in women with FHA. 
4	Clustering of atherogenic behaviors in coffee drinkers. We studied the clustering of coffee consumption and selected atherogenic behaviors in older adults living in a southern California community. Men were somewhat more likely to drink caffeinated coffee while women were more likely to drink decaffeinated coffee. In men, but not women, caffeinated coffee drinking decreased with age and decaffeinated coffee drinking increased. Caffeinated coffee drinkers drank more alcohol, consumed more dietary saturated fats and cholesterol, were more likely to be current smokers and less likely to be current exercisers than were non-coffee drinkers. Smoking and exercise also showed a dose-response relationship to the amount of caffeinated coffee consumed. Risk factor levels among drinkers of decaffeinated coffee were more like those of caffeinated coffee than non-drinkers. These data illustrate the clustering of atherogenic behaviors with coffee drinking and highlight their potential importance in interpreting the growing body of literature about coffee and health. 
1	Congenital abnormalities of the lymphatic system: a new clinical classification. The numerous clinical presentations of congenital abnormalities of the lymphatic system in children and the confusing terminology used to describe their pathologic diagnoses impede the physician's understanding of the condition. The clinical classification based on the actual symptoms of the congenital problems we have presented here should help the physician identify the specific abnormality and a potential treatment. Future research should concentrate on the specific causes and the treatment of these congenital abnormalities. 
3	The neuroradiology of visual disturbances. The neuroradiology of visual deficits has advanced dramatically in recent years. Plain film evaluation of the orbit and face remains useful in the emergency room for the evaluation of trauma. High-resolution coronal CT remains the method of choice in the assessment of serious injury to the orbit and in cases of penetrating metallic foreign body. The contrast-enhanced orbital CT provides useful information in cases of tumor and infection and when the bones of the face or skull are involved. MRI has largely replaced CT in the search for brain infarct, brain tumor, and cerebral inflammatory and demyelinating processes. MRI is the study of choice in all cases of sellar and parasellar disease. It offers high-resolution images in any plane. GTPA enhancement has provided additional information from MRI without significant risk. The final selection of an imaging modality should be based upon the clinical presentation and any physical limitations of the patient. 
3	Alterations in brain phosphate metabolite concentrations in patients with human immunodeficiency virus infection. Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected individuals often demonstrate neuropsychiatric impairment; however, it is unclear how brain metabolism may be altered in such patients. We used in vivo phosphorus 31 magnetic resonance spectroscopy to noninvasively assess brain energy and phospholipid metabolism by measuring brain concentrations of adenosine triphosphate (ATP), phosphocreatine (PCr), and inorganic phosphate (Pi), as well as phospholipid compounds and intracellular pH. In study 1, 17 HIV-seropositive men with varying degrees of neuropsychiatric impairment and six control subjects were studied. Localized spectra were obtained from a heterogeneous 5 x 5 x 5-cm volume of interest (VOI). Patients with HIV infection had a significantly lower ATP/Pi ratio and a trend for a lower PCr/Pi ratio than did the control group. In addition, the ATP/Pi and PCr/Pi ratios were both significantly negatively correlated with overall severity of neuropsychiatric impairment. In study 2, three HIV-seropositive men with neuropsychiatric impairment were compared with 11 HIV-seronegative men. Localized phosphorus 31 magnetic resonance spectra were obtained from two relatively homogeneous VOIs: (1) a predominantly white matter VOI, and (2) a predominantly subcortical gray matter VOI. The three HIV-infected patients demonstrated significantly decreased ATP and PCr concentrations in the white matter VOI. These results suggest that HIV infection of the brain may impair brain cellular oxidative metabolism and that the degree of metabolic compromise may be related to the severity of neuropsychiatric impairment. 
5	Management of aortic insufficiency in chronic aortic dissection. From January 1980 to December 1988, 44 patients with chronic aortic dissection and aortic insufficiency underwent operation. This group of patients was analyzed to evaluate the outcome of those in whom the aortic valve was preserved compared with those having valve replacement. The overall preoperative characteristics of the two groups were similar except for the incidence of Marfan's syndrome. Valve replacement was the elected procedure in patients with valve degeneration or annuloaortic ectasia. In patients with leaflet prolapse with or without an enlarged annulus, a plastic procedure was used. In 48% of the patients, it was possible to preserve the valve. There were five hospital deaths (11%): three were due to low-output syndrome, one was due to bleeding, and one was due to neurological complications. There were two late deaths (5%). Follow-up of the 37 surviving patients ranged from 2 to 108 months (mean follow-up, 18 months). Seventy-eight percent of the survivors were in functional class I and the others were in class II. Two patients in whom the aortic valve was preserved had mild aortic insufficiency. Three patients with bioprostheses underwent reoperation because of prosthetic valve dysfunction. One patient who had aortoplasty and an aortic valve plastic procedure was seen with redissection and aortic insufficiency after 60 months and was reoperated on using the Bentall technique. The actuarial survival curves showed that patients who underwent valvoplasty had higher, but not significantly higher, survival rates than the valve replacement patients. 
1	Enhanced expression of c-myc and H-ras oncogenes in Letterer-Siwe disease. A sequential study using colorimetric in situ hybridization. Tissues from two patients with disseminated histiocytosis X (Letterer-Siwe disease) in which histiocytosis X cells exhibited histologic and cytologic features of malignancy were evaluated by in situ hybridization with the use of biotinylated nucleic acid probes to c-myc and H-ras oncogenes. Enhanced expression of these oncogenes was observed in mononucleated and multinucleated cells of histiocytosis X in the terminal proliferative phase but not in the early quiescent phase of Letterer-Siwe disease in both patients. Our findings indicate that deregulation of c-myc and H-ras in histiocytosis X are late events that likely confer a selective growth advantage to histiocytosis X cells. 
1	Myxomatous cyst of the brachial plexus. Case report. The case of a myxomatous cyst of the brachial plexus is presented. The clinical course is reported, and the frequency of the lesion, diagnostic workup, histopathology, and surgical therapy are discussed. 
5	Interventional radiologic alternatives to cholecystectomy. It has been estimated that 20 million people in the United States have gallstone disease. The choice of the optimal management strategy for a patient with symptomatic gallstones in the 1990s will take into account the clinical status of the patient, the characteristics of the gallstones, and the patient's preference. Only patients whose doctors understand the advantages and disadvantages of the newer methods can make properly informed choices. When interventional radiologic alternatives to cholecystectomy are being contemplated, one approach is to first consider the patient's clinical presentation (acute or nonacute) and then their risk of death after cholecystectomy (low or high). Figure 5 shows an algorithmic approach to the management of gallbladder stones based on this concept. This algorithm also can be used as a framework for discussion of treatment options with any individual patient. 
3	Vagal schwannoma associated with syncopal attacks and postural hypotension: a case report. A case of vagal schwannoma in the cerebellomedullary angle is reported. Preoperatively, the patient had paroxysmal episodes of postural hypotension with syncope. After total removal of the vagal tumor, her systemic blood pressure returned to normal. 
5	Effects of vasopressin on portal pressure during hemorrhage from esophageal varices. Vasopressin is often used to treat variceal hemorrhage. However, its efficacy is uncertain, and its portal hemodynamic effects in this setting are unknown. Eleven patients with alcoholic liver disease and bleeding varices were given vasopressin (0.2 U/min for the first hour, then 0.4 U/min for 24 hours). Portal pressure was monitored using an indwelling hepatic vein balloon catheter. Seventeen patients with variceal bleeding who remained stable over 26 hours of initial treatment with crystalloid and blood products served as a comparison group. Vasopressin infusion (0.2 U/min) produced a significant decrease in wedged hepatic venous pressure, hepatic venous pressure gradient (wedged minus free hepatic venous pressure), and heart rate. Increases in the rate of infusion did not produce further decreases in the parameters measured, but the changes were sustained over the course of the infusion. Hemodynamics remained stable in the control group. Portal pressure did not increase when vasopressin was abruptly discontinued in the 3 patients in whom postinfusion measurements were made. Vasopressin retains its portal hypotensive effects in the setting of variceal hemorrhage. Tachyphylaxis does not develop over 26 hours, and a "rebound" increase in portal pressure probably does not occur when the infusion is discontinued. 
2	Polyglucosan body disease. Adult polyglucosan disease has been described in 15 cases. All had signs of peripheral neuropathy, upper motor neuron signs, and 12 of the 15 had sphincter problems. Dementia was prominent in 8 of 15 cases. We reported 2 cases that contained these clinical features. Electrophysiological studies showed axonal neuropathy. Somatosensory evoked potentials on the second patient were abnormal. Sural nerve biopsy showed clusters of polyglucosan bodies. Although the presence of polyglucosan bodies in biopsy is nonspecific, the number as well as the clinical features are necessary to make the diagnosis. Branching enzyme activity in muscle extracts of the muscles were normal. Hence, a specific enzyme abnormality is not yet known. 
5	Surgical aspects of sclerosing encapsulating peritonitis. Sclerosing encapsulating peritonitis (SEP) is associated with the administration of beta-blocking agents as well as continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis. The predisposing factors in the latter group are recurrent peritonitis, presence of acetate in the dialysate, and antiseptics used during bag exchanges. We report a case of SEP following chronic ambulatory peritoneal dialysis and review the literature on this benign yet potentially lethal condition. Sclerosing encapsulating peritonitis frequently leads to intestinal obstruction, small-bowel necrosis, enterocutaneous fistulas, and malnutrition. There is a high incidence of anastomotic failure when a resection and primary intestinal anastomosis is performed in patients with SEP. Although SEP is not commonly reported in the surgical literature, its importance to surgeons is indicated by the fact that the overall mortality rate is close to 60% in patients with SEP who develop surgical complications. 
5	Development of language in six hemispherectomized patients. The development of language skills in the isolated right hemisphere was investigated by comparing the performance of 3 left hemispherectomized with that of the 3 right hemispherectomized patients and three groups of control subjects on baseline clinical measures of language and on production and judgement of morphological markers. The initial brain insult in the hemispherectomy patients of each group had occurred either during early, middle or late childhood. The left hemispherectomy patients were severely impaired in language processing across all three stages of language development. The consequences of a right hemisphere insult on language development were more restricted, with deleterious effects being apparent only in the case in which the lesion was acquired during early childhood. 
1	Chondrosarcoma complicating total hip arthroplasty in Maffucci's syndrome. A 70-year-old woman who was followed for 60 years for Maffucci's syndrome required a total hip arthroplasty (THA) of the right hip for degenerative arthritis. This did not relieve pain. Three years later, chondrosarcoma of the femur developed around the femoral component and was fatal. The roentgenographic changes after the THA were incorrectly interpreted as being caused by infection. 
5	Amenorrhea. Amenorrhea, the lack of menstruation, is a gynecologic disorder that may arise from a variety of causes. If a logical and orderly schema is followed, the correct diagnosis and appropriate management plan can be formulated. 
4	Hypertension as a risk factor for epilepsy after aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage and surgery. A prospective, consecutive series of 307 patients with aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage ranging from Grades 1 to V according to the classification of Hunt and Hess on admission were evaluated to determine the incidence of epilepsy 1 to 3 years (mean, 1.4 years) after aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) and surgery. Sixty-three patients had died and one patient was lost to follow-up. Twenty-nine patients developed epileptic seizures after the SAH and surgery. The mean time from the SAH to epileptic seizure varied from 0 days (day of the SAH) to 2 years (mean, 6.7 months). The seizures were classified as focal in 9 patients (31%) and as generalized in 20 patients (69%). All patients received anticonvulsant medication after more than one seizure. The risk factors for development of posthemorrhagic/postoperative epilepsy were, in order of importance: a history of hypertension; an infarct on late computed tomographic scan; and the duration of coma after the ictus. Of the 85 patients with histories of hypertension, 17 (20.0%) developed epilepsy. Only 12 (5.4%) of the 222 nonhypertensive patients developed epileptic seizures. The difference between the groups was significant (P = 0.0001). Computed tomographic scans were undertaken in 237 patients 1 to 3 years (mean, 1.4 years) after the SAH and surgery. Postoperative epilepsy was significantly associated with infarcts visualized on computed tomographic scan (P = 0.0005). 
4	Vascular renin and hypertension. Uptake versus synthesis. Conventional radioimmunoassay techniques demonstrated in the aortic wall a renin-like activity which is derived from plasma but has a longer half-life than plasma renin. Blood pressure elevation after renin injection into nephrectomized rats correlates better with aortic renin than with plasma renin. Vascular and other extrarenal tissue can also synthesize renin. Using a ribonuclease protection technique for the detection of renin messenger RNA we have been able to demonstrate that a wide variety of extrarenal tissues contain the renin message. In at least two of these, the brain and the liver, renin messenger RNA levels are unaffected by changes in dietary salt or by changes in systemic blood pressure. Functional studies using isolated human resistance vessels also demonstrate the presence of renin-like activity by a contractile response to added renin substrate. It is suggested that extrarenal tissues therefore contain renin-like activity derived both from uptake and from local synthesis. These systems may be regulated in different ways and may carry out different functions. 
1	Malignant rhabdoid tumor of the liver. A distinct clinicopathologic entity. A malignant rhabdoid tumor occurring as a primary hepatic neoplasm in a six-month-old white infant is reported. It was treated by an attempt at total resection involving right hepatic lobectomy and by chemotherapy with cis-platinum, VP-16, and Adriamycin. Despite this, recurrence of the tumor resulted in the girl's death within three months. The neoplasm showed typical light microscopic features of malignant rhabdoid tumor as well as filamentous cytoplasmic inclusions by electron microscopic examination and staining for both cytokeratin and vimentin by immunohistochemistry. The classic clinicopathologic features of this tumor support the concept that malignant rhabdoid tumors similar to those of the kidney may occur in extrarenal sites. 
4	Do we need another antihypertensive agent? The factors to be considered in selecting antihypertensive agents have traditionally centered around balancing efficacy against adverse side effects. The former can be achieved by a variety of agents alone or in combination. The latter not only involves safety but is also concerned with whether an otherwise safe agent is tolerated by the patient so compliance with the treatment regimen can be achieved. A relatively new consideration is how antihypertensive agents affect other disease states that may or may not be associated with hypertension. For example, how a drug may affect diabetes, gout, myocardial hypertrophy, atherosclerosis, and coronary events must be evaluated. These concerns taken together answer the question of why yet another antihypertensive agent may be needed in the pharmacologic armamentarium. 
3	Intraocular pressure and the rate of visual field loss in chronic open-angle glaucoma. We measured the rate of change of visual field threshold values over time (mean follow-up, 44.9 +/- 17.4 months) by trend analysis in 40 eyes of 40 patients with chronic open-angle glaucoma. Twenty-eight eyes had stable visual fields, and two eyes had significant visual field improvement. Ten eyes had significant visual field deterioration and showed a correlation between indices of intraocular pressure (standard error of the mean, P = .02; standard deviation, P = .04; and range, P = .05) and the rate of visual field loss in the superonasal region of the visual field, such that the greater the variation of intraocular pressure the greater the rate of loss. The group losing visual fields had a higher mean visual field threshold value and significantly less optic disk pallor and cupping at the start of the study than the stable visual field group. Thus, a significant rate of visual field loss occurred at an earlier stage of the disease and showed a correlation with intraocular pressure in this stage. 
4	Surgical treatment of active native valve endocarditis. A report is presented of 24 patients (23 male), mean age 38 years, who underwent surgery for active native valve endocarditis of the left heart in 1975-1988. The aortic valve was affected in all patients, and also the mitral valve in five. Pre-existing aortic valve disorder was present in 17 cases (13 congenitally bicuspid 4 rheumatic affection). There were five hospital deaths (20.8%). Staphylococci as causal organism and extensive infection predicted the highest mortality and morbidity. The mean follow-up time was 39.7 (range 2-114) months. Two reoperations because of prosthetic valve dehiscence revealed endocarditis of the implanted valve. Strong correlation was found between favourable postoperative course and rapid normalization of C-reactive protein levels, which did not fall in patients with persistent infection. Early surgery is recommended if the course of bacterial endocarditis is severely complicated. 
5	Isolation of a complementary DNA clone encoding an autoantigen recognized by an anti-neuronal cell antibody from a patient with paraneoplastic cerebellar degeneration. We isolated a complementary DNA clone encoding a 52-kd protein recognized by an anti-neuronal cell antibody in serum from a patient with paraneoplastic cerebellar degeneration associated with uterine carcinoma. The recombinant protein expressed in prokaryotic cells was specifically recognized by the anti-neuronal cell antibody from the patient, and its molecular weight was identical to that of antigenic proteins in the cerebellum. The deduced protein consisted of 450 amino acids dominated by hydrophilic residues, the calculated relative molecular mass was 51,238, and the predicted value of the isoelectric point was 4.99. This complementary DNA sequence and the deduced protein sequence have not been reported previously, and the sequences showed no homologies with the complimentary DNA or the amino acid sequences in the GenBank, EMBL, or NBRF databases, including the complementary DNA for a 34-kd cerebellar protein (CDR34) that is recognized by an anti-Purkinje cell antibody. Unexpectedly, the transcript of this gene was detected not only in the cerebellum and the brain stem but also in an extraneural tissue, the intestine. 
1	Continuous infusion carboplatin on a 21-day schedule: a phase I and pharmacokinetic study. A phase I study with continuous infusion carboplatin for 21 days every 6 weeks using a venous access port and portable pump was performed over a dose range of 12 to 32 mg/m2/d, with increments of 2 mg/m2/d. Forty-four patients received 107 courses (median, two; range, one to nine). World Health Organization (WHO) grade III/IV leukopenia and thrombocytopenia occurred in one of seven patients at 30 mg/m2/d, and in two of six and four of six patients at 32 mg/m2/d. Cumulative platelet depression was found at dose levels of 28 mg/m2/d or more. Median glomerular filtration rate (GFR) and effective renal plasma flow, monitored by radioisotope clearances at doses greater than or equal to 20 mg/m2/d, decreased 8.2% (P less than .05) and 10.9% (P less than .01) after two courses. There was a relationship (r = .50, P less than .0002) between the percentage of platelet depression and GFR. No other toxicity was observed. Of the 17 patients who were evaluable, one complete response and four partial responses were observed. In addition, six patients had stable disease. Pharmacokinetic analysis of total and ultrafiltrable platinum (UFPt) was performed by atomic absorption spectrophotometry. Steady-state plasma levels for UFPt were reached after 8 hours. These levels could be detected from the 20 mg/m2/d dose. During steady state, carboplatin dose and UFPt plasma levels were not correlated, but steady-state UFPt and GFR (r = -.27, P less than .05) were. Twenty-four percent of total platinum (Pt) was present as UFPt during steady state (x = 160 +/- 10 micrograms/L). Total body clearance of UFPt exceeded GFR 2.2 times. Mean area under the curve (AUC) for UFPt during continuous infusion was 4,921.8 +/- 301.72 mg.min/L. For total Pt, steady-state plasma levels were not reached; total Pt plasma levels increased between day 7 and day 21 (P less than .0001). There was a significant relation between total Pt serum levels day 7, 14, and 21 and the drug dose administered. Immunohistochemical analysis of DNA-bound Pt in leukocytes showed a linear increase from day 7 to day 14 to day 21 (r = .97) between DNA-bound Pt and duration of infusion in individual patients. The maximum-tolerable dose of carboplatin is 30 mg/m2/d for 21 days (total dose 630 mg/m2) and is recommended for phase II studies. 
5	Vasopressin and oxytocin responses to illusory self-motion and nausea in man. Vasopressin and oxytocin are nonapeptides secreted from the neurohypophysis; increases in vasopressin are associated with nausea and vomiting in some, but not all, species. Our aim was to determine whether plasma vasopressin and oxytocin levels were altered in healthy volunteers who did or did not develop nausea during vection, an optokinetic stimulus which produces the illusion of self-motion. Vection was produced by rotating a drum with an inner surface of black and white vertical stripes around the seated stationary subject. Gastric myoelectrical activity was recorded continuously throughout the experiment with electrodes positioned on the abdominal surface. Plasma samples were obtained before vection and after drum rotation stopped when nausea and tachygastria were present. Vasopressin and oxytocin were extracted from plasma and quantified by RIA. During vection six subjects reported nausea and developed gastric dysrhythmias; six other subjects had no nausea and remained in normal 3-cpm myoelectrical rhythms. Vasopressin and oxytocin values before vection were similar in each group of subjects. One minute after vection stopped, plasma vasopressin levels were significantly greater (P less than 0.05) in subjects experiencing nausea and tachygastrias (35.4 +/- 26.7 pmol/L) than in those without symptoms (2.7 +/- 0.47 pmol/L). Oxytocin levels were unchanged by either vection or nausea. It is concluded that 1) vasopressin, not oxytocin, neurons in the magnocellular-neurohypophyseal system are activated during vection-induced nausea and gastric dysrhythmias; and 2) illusory self-motion may be used safely to study the neuroendocrine responses to brain-gut interactions and nausea in man. 
2	Gallstone lithotripsy: relevant physical principles and technical issues. A basic understanding of shock wave generation is essential for the radiologist who performs gallstone lithotripsy. Shock waves differ from ordinary acoustic waves in that they have a rapid rise time, a positive pressure component that gives rise to compressive forces approaching 1,000 atm, and a low-amplitude sustained negative pressure (rarefactive) component. Shock waves are created by means of three different types of shock wave generators: spark-gap, electromagnetic, and piezoelectric. The authors describe and compare these three types of shock wave generators with regard to equipment selection. Regardless of how shock waves are generated, they share common interactions with tissue. These interactions are reviewed along with the proposed mechanisms of stone fragmentation. 
4	Changes in left ventricular diastolic performance after aortic balloon valvuloplasty: acute and late effects To evaluate acute and follow-up changes in left ventricular diastolic performance, simultaneous digital left ventriculography and micromanometry were performed in 49 patients undergoing aortic balloon valvuloplasty. All patients improved symptomatically after valvuloplasty, and 26 returned 6.3 +/- 1.5 months later for follow-up catheterization. Immediately after valvuloplasty, aortic valve area increased (before 0.5 +/- 0.2 versus after 0.8 +/- 0.2 cm2, p less than 0.01), cardiac output (before 4.3 +/- 1.2 versus after 4.4 +/- 1.3 liters/min) and ejection fraction (before 51 +/- 18% versus after 52 +/- 17%) did not change and diastolic indexes worsened, signified by a decrease in peak filling rate (before 247 +/- 80 versus after 226 +/- 78 ml/s, p less than 0.01) and increase in the time constant of isovolumetric relaxation (tau) (before 78 +/- 29 versus after 96 +/- 40 ms, p less than 0.01) and the modulus of chamber stiffness (before 0.107 +/- 0.071 versus after 0.141 +/- 0.083, p less than 0.01). At follow-up catheterization, 16 patients continued to have symptomatic improvement (group 1) and 10 had recurrence of symptoms (group 2). Aortic valve area, cardiac output and ejection fraction at follow-up catheterization in both groups were similar and unchanged from values before valvuloplasty. 
5	Pituitary hemorrhage into a Rathke's cleft cyst This report describes a case of symptomatic pituitary hemorrhage into a Rathke's cleft cyst in a 25-year-old woman. The literature on pituitary hemorrhage in nonadenomatous sellar tumors is reviewed. 
4	Coronary lesion morphology in acute myocardial infarction: demonstration of early remodeling after streptokinase treatment Coronary lesion morphology was analyzed in 72 patients 1 to 8 days after streptokinase treatment for acute myocardial infarction and compared with lesion morphology in a control group of 24 patients with stable angina. In the streptokinase group the infarct-related artery was patent in 55 patients (76%). Compared with stenoses in the stable angina group, there were no differences in the stenosis length, severity, calcification or in the proportion located at an acute bend or at a branch point. However, lesions in the streptokinase group were more often irregular (p less than 0.005) and eccentric (p less than 0.01), had a shoulder (p less than 0.0001), globular filling defects (p less than 0.01), linear filling defects (p less than 0.00005) and contrast staining (p less than 0.05). Plaque ulceration index was higher in the streptokinase than in the stable angina group (6.2 +/- 7.9 versus 3.5 +/- 3.4, p less than 0.001). Of the 72 streptokinase-treated patients, 35 were maintained on heparin infusion until angioplasty 2 to 10 days later. At repeat angiography before angioplasty, globular lesion filling defects seen in eight patients had disappeared, whereas linear filling defects persisted in 7 of 14 cases. Fewer lesions were irregular (p less than 0.0001) and the ulceration index decreased from 7.4 +/- 10.4 to 3.0 +/- 1.6 (p less than 0.001). These data show that the lesion in the infarct-related artery after streptokinase treatment is irregular and often associated with filling defects, perhaps corresponding to plaque fissuring and intraluminal thrombosis. 
3	Ultrastructural evidence of a merocrine secretion in the human endolymphatic sac. The results of a light and transmission electron microscopic analysis of an endolymphatic sac (ES) from a patient suffering from episodic vertigo, tinnitus, and hearing loss are presented. A biopsy of the intraosseous portion of the ES was obtained during a translabyrinthine approach to section the vestibular nerve in the internal acoustic meatus. The material consisted mainly of tubular epithelial structures filled with heavily stained material. Pathologically dilated and degranulated rough endoplasmic reticuli and disaggregation of polyribosomes with accumulation of solitary ribosomes in the cytosol and endoplasmic reticulum suggested a disturbed epithelial cell protein synthesis. Ultrastructural evidence of an increased merocrine secretion of glycoprotein conjugates into the ES was noted. This made it possible to analyze the presumed intracellular secretory pathways. An increased number of intraepithelial lymphocytes and monocytes was observed. Since the inner ear had been subjected to surgical intervention before the vestibular nerve section, no conclusions can be drawn as to whether the patient's symptoms were related to the disturbed protein metabolism and hypersecretion of glycoprotein conjugates into the ES. The findings support earlier experimental results that indicate that the ES has not only a resorptive function but also a secretory one. 
4	Simultaneous measurement of myocardial perfusion and ventricular function during exercise from a single injection of technetium-99m sestamibi in coronary artery disease. New radiopharmaceuticals permit simultaneous assessment of myocardial perfusion and left ventricular function using a single tracer injection. The purpose of this study was to quantitate the relation between myocardial perfusion and function at rest and during exercise in patients with documented coronary artery disease (CAD). A rest first-pass radionuclide angiocardiogram (RNA) was recorded in 51 patients with CAD during injection of 10 mCi of technetium-99m (Tc-99m) sestamibi, and tomographic perfusion images were obtained 60 minutes later. A treadmill test was then performed, and on attainment of an exercise end point a second first-pass RNA was recorded with 30 mCi of Tc-99m sestamibi. Tomographic images reflecting myocardial perfusion during exercise were obtained 1 hour later. Tomographic perfusion defect size, quantified using modifications of the Cedars-Sinai program, correlated directly with end-systolic volume and inversely with ejection fraction at rest and during exercise. However, perfusion defect size often varied widely in patients with similar left ventricular function. This independence between measurements of perfusion and function suggests that simultaneous assessment of the 2 physiologic variables could improve the diagnostic and prognostic information of radionuclide tests. 
5	Susceptibility to Coxsackievirus B3-induced chronic myocarditis maps near the murine Tcr alpha and Myhc alpha loci on chromosome 14. This study was undertaken to determine the genetic control of host susceptibility to coxsackievirus B3 (CVB3)-induced chronic myocarditis in a mouse model. An autosomal recessive autoimmune myocardial disease (amd) gene (possibly more than one gene), which determined susceptibility to CVB3-induced chronic myocarditis in the A/J and DBA/2J inbred mouse strains, was mapped to a segment of chromosome 14. Data from both the AXB/BXA recombinant inbred (RI) strains and the B10.D2(57N) H-8b congenic mice supported this linkage relationship. Analysis of the AXB/BXA RI strain distribution patterns suggested that amd maps distal to the Np-2, Tcr alpha, and Myhc alpha loci. 
5	Soft tissue sarcoma with additional anaplastic components. A clinicopathologic and immunohistochemical study of 27 cases. This clinicopathologic study concerns 27 cases of "dedifferentiated" soft tissue sarcoma (DSTS), including 14 liposarcomas, six leiomyosarcomas, five chondrosarcomas, and two rhabdomyosarcomas. In addition, the authors conducted an immunohistochemical survey of 23 cases and an electron microscopic examination of three. The findings were compared with observations of 32 cases of de novo malignant fibrous histiocytoma (MFH). All tumors contained additional distinct anaplastic portions indistinguishable from MFH under conventional light microscopy, ultrastructurally, and in cases of immunoreactivity for alpha-1-antichymotrypsin and alpha-1-antitrypsin and on lectin histochemical findings for ricinus communis agglutinin and concanavalin agglutinin. The desmin reactivity present in anaplastic portions of 14 DSTS and in eight de novo MFH is taken to mean that myofibroblasts are present in these tumors. The anaplastic components of DSTS are presumed to represent the proliferation of another clone of undifferentiated mesenchymal cells that fail to differentiate along any specific lineage other than fibroblast-like cells, histiocyte-like cells, and myofibroblasts. Nineteen patients died of tumor and four are alive and well 1.6, 1.7, 2.1, and 5.2 years after the initial treatment, respectively. 
4	Recognition of hypertension and abnormal blood pressure burden with ambulatory blood pressure recordings in type I diabetes mellitus. Ambulatory blood pressure (AMBP) measurements were obtained at 20-min intervals for 24 h in 25 subjects with insulin-dependent (type I) diabetes mellitus and 21 control subjects. The diabetic patients had normal kidney function (glomerular filtration rate 112.1 +/- 7.2 ml.min-1.1.73 m-2, renal plasma flow 459.0 +/- 23.4 ml.min-1.1.73 m-2) and were normotensive according to standard sphygmomanometer examinations. Mean +/- SE AMBP (systolic/diastolic in mmHg) measurements in diabetic patients (24 h, 131.7/77.2 +/- 2.9/1.8; 0600-2200, 132.3/78.4 +/- 2.9/3.4; 2200-0600, 125.1/75.7 +/- 3.9/3.4) significantly exceeded control values during all times (24 h, 121.8/70.3 +/- 2.9/1.9; 0600-2200, 120.7/71.8 +/- 2.6/2.0; 2200-0600, 108.2/61.5 +/- 6.6/2.7). Mean 24-h AMBP exceeded 135/85 mmHg in 49% of diabetic patients. The same threshold of 135/85 mmHg was used to determine the prevalence of abnormal measurements per time period (pressure burden). Pressure burden was increased twofold in diabetic patients compared with control subjects. Mean AMBP was significantly reduced at night in control subjects but not in diabetic patients. Changes in blood pressure were not related to kidney function in diabetic patients. AMBP recordings uncovered an increased prevalence of abnormal mean blood pressure, increased pressure burden, and a lack of diurnal variation of blood pressure in subjects with type I diabetes mellitus. These findings have important implications for early intervention strategies in diabetes mellitus because AMBP recordings correlate well with end-organ damage. 
4	Improved cannulation method for extracorporeal membrane oxygenation. Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation has been shown to be useful for patients in reversible cardiogenic shock. Effective arterial cannulation techniques for infants have been developed that are simple to use and require minimal subsequent vascular repair or reconstruction after removal. Groin cannulation in adults frequently requires bidirectional arterial cannulation to ensure adequate distal perfusion as well as frequent complex arterial repairs after discontinuation. We describe a simple arterial cannulation technique using a single right-angle, high-flow arterial cannula. With this technique adequate bidirectional arterial perfusion is maintained with a single arterial cannula while the need for vascular repairs or reconstruction is minimized. 
5	Nuclear sclerotic cataract after vitrectomy for idiopathic epiretinal membranes causing macular pucker. We evaluated the occurrence or progression of nuclear sclerosis of the crystalline lens in 100 eyes after vitrectomy for removal of idiopathic epiretinal membranes causing macular pucker. The follow-up period ranged from six to 99 months (average, 29 months). Visually significant nuclear sclerosis was present preoperatively in three of the operated on eyes and four of the fellow eyes. The rate of occurrence or progression of visually significant nuclear sclerosis was far greater in the operated on eyes (P less than .0001). Of 100 patients, 80 operated on eyes and 24 fellow eyes had visually significant nuclear sclerosis or had undergone previous cataract extraction at the conclusion of the study. Different concentrations of glucose in the intraocular irrigating solution did not affect occurrence of later nuclear sclerosis. Patients older than 50 years of age had a far greater incidence of later nuclear sclerosis than patients younger than 50 years of age (P = .0003). Nuclear sclerosis may be caused by altered lens metabolism after removal of part of the vitreous gel, since nuclear sclerosis also occurs in other conditions associated with vitreous liquefaction. 
3	Electroencephalography should not be routine in the evaluation of syncope in adults We reviewed the reports of all electroencephalograms obtained at the Nashville (Tenn) Veterans Administration Hospital from September 1987 to August 1989. Seventy-three patients were referred for evaluation of syncope or near syncope. Of these 73 patients, 10 (13.7%) had abnormal findings. Twenty-six patients were referred for other complaints similar to syncope (ie, blackouts, loss of consciousness, falling out, passing out, and fainting). Of these 26 patients, five (19.2%) had abnormal findings. We reviewed the medical records of the patients with abnormal findings and found that the final diagnosis or treatment of the syncope was affected by electroencephalogram in only one patient. These findings suggest that routine electroencephalography is not of significant value in the evaluation of syncope in adults. 
5	Recurrence of resected esophagogastric adenocarcinoma: results of re-resection. Isolated local recurrence following potentially curative resection for carcinoma of the esophagus or esophagogastric junction does not necessarily imply pending systemic disease and early demise. While radiation alone or in combination with chemotherapy is standard treatment for such patients, resection is another available option. Resection may also be a consideration should localized disease persist after non-operative therapy in the absence of metastases. A 5 year retrospective review was performed examining 204 resections performed prior to 1989. Only 5 patients underwent resection of locally recurrent esophagogastric (EG) adenocarcinoma during this period. No squamous carcinoma recurrences were resected. One patient is well 15 months later while another died at 18 months of other causes without recurrence. Recurrence after re-resection occurred at 8, 11, and 24 months in the 3 other patients. Although there were no postoperative deaths, major complications occurred in 4 patients. All 5 patients swallowed normally after operation. 
3	Idiopathic intracranial hypertension. Although the cause of IIH remains obscure, loss of visual function is common, and patients may progress to blindness. Diagnosis should adhere to the modified Dandy criteria. Recent case-control studies cast doubt on the validity of many frequently cited conditions associated with IIH. Valid associations include obesity, recent weight gain, female sex, vitamin A intoxication, and steroid withdrawal. Management should include serial perimetry using a sensitive disease-specific strategy so the proper therapy can be selected and visual loss prevented or reversed. 
4	Interaction of sodium sensitivity and stress in young adults. The interaction of sodium sensitivity and stress-induced cardiovascular reactivity was studied in white and black young adults aged 18-23 years. The cardiovascular response to difficult mental arithmetic was measured before and after 14 days of oral sodium loading (10 g NaCl/day added to the usual diet). A sodium-sensitive blood pressure response occurred in 18.4% of whites and 37.3% of blacks. A significant correlation between blood pressure change and sodium excretion occurred in the sodium-sensitive group (r = - 0.28, p less than 0.01). High sodium intake did not augment blood pressure or heart rate response to the beta-adrenergic-mediated stimulus of mental arithmetic in the population, which was grouped by blood pressure, race, or sodium sensitivity. 
5	Nuclear techniques for the analysis of urinary calculi. Sections of urinary calculi were prepared and point-by-point analyses along a line-scan were carried out using the techniques of proton-induced X-ray emission (PIXE) and nuclear reaction analysis (NRA). Correlations between several pairs of elements (including trace elements) were noted and it was also clear that the composition of a stone varied markedly at different stages of development. 
4	Angiographic morphology in unstable angina and its relation to transient myocardial ischemia and hospital outcome. Complex stenosis morphology frequently occurs in patients with unstable angina pectoris. However, its relation to transient myocardial ischemia and hospital outcome has not been ascertained. To address this issue, 88 patients with significant (greater than or equal to 50%) coronary artery disease presenting with angina--new onset (n = 38), worsening (n = 20) or at rest (n = 30)-were studied. Patients with left main artery disease, normal coronary arteries or occlusion of the ischemia-related arteries were not included in the study. Continuous electrocardiographic recordings were obtained during the first 24 hours. Angiography was performed within 1 week from admission. Complex morphology was defined as any stenosis with irregular borders, overhanging edges or intracoronary thrombus. Only data referring to the in-hospital outcome were considered in this study. Adverse end points were sudden death, myocardial infarction and emergency revascularization. Analysis of the angiograms revealed a complex morphology in 58 patients (group 1). The remaining 30 patients served as control subjects (group 2). Thirty-two of the 58 group 1 patients had an unfavorable clinical outcome (positive predictive value, 55%). A similar outcome occurred in only 2 of the 30 group 2 patients (negative predictive value, 93%). Of the 32 group 1 patients who had an unfavorable clinical outcome, 29 had a cumulative duration of transient myocardial ischemia of greater than or equal to 60 minutes per 24 hours. A similar duration of ischemia, however, was observed in another 6 group 1 and in 8 group 2 patients. 
4	Effects of doxazosin on blood pressure, renin-angiotensin-aldosterone and urinary kallikrein. Doxazosin, a new quinazoline-derivative postsynaptic alpha 1-adrenoceptor antagonist, was studied in this randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled 12-week study. Its effects on blood pressure (BP), heart rate, metabolic functions and renal hormones were analyzed after administration of a single oral morning dose in a 3-phase fashion when administered to 17 patients (11 women, 6 men, 21 to 59 years) with mild to moderate uncomplicated essential hypertension. After titrating the antihypertensive effective dose biweekly from 1 to 8 mg/day and a mean end titration-point dose of 4.14 +/- 0.1 mg (mean +/- standard error of the mean) at week 8 of treatment, it was adjusted to maintain diastolic BP at levels less than or equal to 90 mm Hg for up to 12 weeks of treatment when, at a final mean dose of 4.35 +/- 0.2 mg/day, BP decreased in all patients by a mean 31 +/- 3/17 +/- 2 (supine) and 39 +/- 3/15 +/- 3 (standing) mm Hg (p less than 0.005) with no increase in heart rate and no "first-dose phenomenon." Neither the renin-aldosterone system nor electrolyte excretion was significantly affected. Renal function and metabolic parameters also remained unchanged. Urinary kallikrein excretion was augmented 2.47-fold (p less than 0.002). There was good tolerance; 1 patient discontinued the study because of dry nose. These results suggest that long-term monotherapy with doxazosin is an effective and safe antihypertensive agent for mild to moderate essential hypertension that stimulates urinary kallikrein excretion. 
1	Radiographic manifestations of congenital anomalies affecting the airway. Congenital anomalies of the airway are generally uncommon, but a vast array of possibilities exists. Some present life-threatening emergencies at birth, and others go undiagnosed for years. Clinical symptoms are often nonspecific, and radiographic evaluation is frequently requested to localize and characterize the lesion before endoscopy, surgery, or medical management. The most common intrinsic congenital anomalies causing airway compromise in infants include choanal atresia, mandibular hypoplasia, laryngomalacia, vocal cord paralysis, and congenital subglottic stenosis. The radiologist must be on the alert for unsuspected additional anomalies involving the airway, lungs, and esophagus, which occur with relative frequency. Numerous extrinsic congenital masses of the head, neck, and mediastinum may compromise the airway. Hemangiomas, lymphangiomas, and teratomas are more likely to be noted at birth, whereas branchial cleft cysts, thyroglossal duct anomalies, and dermoid cysts frequently present later. Mass location and radiographic characteristics usually allow accurate preoperative diagnosis. Intracranial involvement by nasal or nasopharyngeal masses, intrathoracic involvement by lower neck mass, and intraspinal involvement by posterior neck mass must always be sought for radiographically. Persistence of respiratory symptoms after removal of such masses is not uncommon because tracheal deformity and laxity may take months or years to resolve. Recent advances in cine CT and MR imaging promise to improve imaging of the airway in general and in the pediatric population in particular. Significant limitations in imaging of the pediatric larynx remain. As a result, endoscopy continues to be the primary diagnostic tool for airway anomalies of this region. 
5	Electrocardiographic ambulatory monitoring with a real-time analysis system. The analysis of records collected during long-term ambulatory electrocardiographic monitoring has traditionally involved the review of massive data, either manually or with the aid of interactive scanning computers. Many factors complicate this analysis, including the use of analog tape for storage of electrocardiographic waveforms, the need to analyze 100,000 waveforms from an average 24-hour study, and the need to deal with an interface that compresses 24 hours of data into as little as 6 minutes on a screen. Today, the computer incorporated in the monitor can scrutinize each cardiac cycle in real time. The system produces a statistical report based on every heart beat and also performs data reduction and storage of electrocardiograph samples. To assess real-time analysis we examined data collected from the Circadian CircaMed ambulatory electrocardiography system. We found that it could detect and quantify simple or complex ventricular ectopic beats, brady- or tachyarrhythmic events, and ST-segment deviation. One hundred fifty patients 21 to 85 years old with symptoms or clinical finding suggestive of ischemia, cardiac arrhythmia, or conductive defects were referred to our electrocardiography laboratory for ambulatory monitoring. The results demonstrate that this system can detect the full range of cardiac disease found with the traditional method. Of the 150 patients, ambulatory electrocardiographic tests were positive in 93 (62%). In addition, we developed a methodology for lead placement when using two bipolar leads, as is typical for ambulatory electrocardiography. We present a procedure for determining the optimum lead placement that is based on the patient's history and a 12-lead electrocardiogram. 
1	Invasive squamous cell carcinoma in a patient with epidermodysplasia verruciformis. A patient with epidermodysplasia verruciformis died of intracranial invasion by squamous cell carcinoma (SCC). A biopsy of clinically normal skin had revealed perineural invasion by malignant keratinocytes. Because SCCs arising in patients with epidermodysplasia verruciformis may be biologically aggressive, it is best to excise them with careful control of the surgical tissue margins. 
5	Retinal infarction during sleep and wakefulness. Brain and retinal infarctions during sleep have been attributed to focal hypoperfusion caused by systemic hypotension combined with underlying arterial stenosis, rather than to embolism. Because some retinal emboli may be visualized on ophthalmoscopy, we studied 24 consecutive patients (18 men and six women) aged 26-78 (mean 58) years with recent retinal infarction and determined whether the infarction had occurred during sleep or wakefulness. All patients underwent dilated ophthalmoscopy and a carotid artery study (arteriography in 20, duplex ultrasound in the remaining four), and 12 had echocardiography. Retinal infarction occurred during sleep at an unexpectedly rate (14 of 24 observed compared with eight of 24 expected, p = 0.02). Retinal cholesterol emboli were seen in one half of the patients regardless of whether the retinal infarction had occurred during sleep or wakefulness. Carotid artery disease was found in seven of the 14 patients in whom infarction had occurred during sleep and in eight of the 10 patients in whom infarction had occurred during wakefulness (p = 0.21). Cerebrovascular occlusive disease was not found in the five patients aged less than 50 years. Our findings suggest that embolism is a common mechanism of retinal infarction during sleep or wakefulness, that in patients aged greater than 50 years extracranial carotid artery disease is a common source of retinal emboli, and that the retina may be especially susceptible to infarction during sleep. 
1	The impact of physician compliance on screening mammography for older women. Screening mammography is underutilized, even for women older than 50 years for whom there is a general consensus that regular annual screening is appropriate and necessary. To evaluate reasons for this underutilization, we studied a random sample of 517 women in Los Angeles, Calif who were older than 50 years. All women were found to be underscreened, especially women older than 65 years. For example, approximately 35% of women 50 to 64 years old and 47% of women aged 65 years and older never had had even one mammogram. Analyses revealed that the most important factor that predicted whether a women ever had had a mammogram was whether her physician had talked to her about mammography. Women were between four and 12 times more likely, depending on their age group, to have had a mammogram at some time if their physicians discussed it with them. The discussions did not need to be lengthy or complex. These results indicate that physicians need to know that discussing screening mammography with their patients has a major impact on breast cancer screening behaviors. 
5	Gastric dysrhythmias following pylorus-preserving pancreaticoduodenectomy. Possible mechanism for early delayed gastric emptying. Transient delayed gastric emptying is reported as a frequent complication following pancreas-preserving pancreaticoduodenectomy (PPW). We placed serosal electrodes on the stomach of a patient undergoing PPW. Myoelectric recordings were obtained postoperatively and correlated with simultaneous radionuclide liquid gastric emptying studies. The patient developed early postoperative gastric atony, associated with frequent gastric dysrhythmias. These dysrhythmias may have been exacerbated by a perihepatic abscess. The gastric dysrhythmias correlated with alterations in liquid gastric emptying. Gastric dysrhythmias may be a mechanism for gastric dysfunction in the early postoperative period. 
4	Myocardial sulfhydryl pool alterations occur during reperfusion after brief and prolonged myocardial ischemia in vivo. Myocardial sulfhydryl (SH)-containing compounds, including reduced glutathione (GSH), are both defenses against and potential markers of reactive oxygen metabolite injury during ischemia and reperfusion. We examined the alterations in GSH and other myocardial SH pools during reperfusion in anesthetized dogs exposed to brief (15 minutes, n = 7) or prolonged (90 minutes, n = 6) regional ischemia caused by occlusion of the left anterior descending artery. Ninety minutes of ischemia followed by 5 hours of reperfusion, which resulted in myocardial necrosis of 43.9 +/- 4.0% of the area at risk, caused a 22% reduction in total myocardial SH groups (p less than 0.01), a 57% decrease in nonprotein myocardial SH groups (p less than 0.01), a 56% decrease in GSH (p less than 0.01), and a 62% decrease in non-GSH, nonprotein SH groups (p less than 0.02). However, protein SH groups were not significantly reduced (12% decrease, p = NS). Also, myocardial release of GSH and oxidized glutathione (GSSG) into the coronary venous effluent occurred during early reperfusion. In contrast, 15 minutes of ischemia, followed by 30 minutes of reperfusion, did not alter myocardial total SH groups, protein SH groups, or GSH (9% decrease, p = NS); nor was there reperfusion release of GSH or GSSG. However, even with brief ischemia, nonprotein SH groups decreased 23% (p less than 0.05), due mainly to a 59% decrease in the non-GSH, nonprotein SH pool (p less than 0.05). These changes after brief ischemia occurred without alterations in myocardial GSSG or the GSH/GSSG ratio. 
5	Risk of dementia in first-degree relatives of patients with Alzheimer's disease and related disorders. First-degree relatives of patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD) are at greater risk for dementia when compared with the relatives of their healthy peers, but not when compared with the relatives of patients with Parkinson's disease. This may indicate that the risk of dementia in these relatives is not specific to AD or that these studies are biased. We obtained a family history and vital status information on each first-degree relative of patients attending a clinic and in a group of recruited healthy elderly subjects. Patients formed two groups: probable AD and other forms of dementia or cognitive disorders without dementia. The odds of dementia in first-degree relatives did not differ between patient groups. The odds of dementia in relatives of patients with probable AD or other forms of dementia was six times that in the relatives of the healthy elderly subjects. The cumulative incidence of dementia increased with age in the first-degree relatives of all subjects. Approximately 50% of the first-degree relatives of patients with AD were demented by age 91 years, but almost the same number of the other patient group's relatives were demented as well. That figure was never reached in the healthy elderly subject's relatives. Because the risk of dementia in first-degree relatives of patients with AD was similar to that for patients with other disorders, we cannot exclude the possibility that this is the result of selection and information biases. Our investigation implies that the increased risk of dementia may not be specific to relatives of patients with AD; the risk may also be increased in first-degree relatives of patients with other neurologic disorders. 
5	Persistence of chronic constipation in children after biofeedback treatment. We investigated the efficacy of biofeedback treatment and evaluated anorectal factors that might be responsible for persistence of chronic constipation with or without encopresis in a group of 38 children with abnormal contraction of the pelvic floor during straining and persistence of chronic constipation with encopresis after conventional treatment. Nine children were unsuccessful in learning to relax the pelvic floor during straining with biofeedback treatment, and one patient had contraction of the pelvic floor on follow-up despite successful biofeedback treatment; none recovered. Twenty-eight children were able to relax the pelvic floor on follow-up; 14 recovered and 14 did not recover from chronic constipation. Nonrecovered patients who learned to relax the pelvic floor had significantly decreased rectal and anal responsiveness to rectal distension as compared to recovered patients during the initial and follow-up anorectal manometric study. Psychological factors such as social competence and behavior problems did not appear to be responsible for recovery or nonrecovery from chronic constipation and encopresis. 
3	Cognitive strategies during coincident timing tasks. Research findings suggest that experience and cognitive strategies contribute to successful performance during perceptual-motor tasks. This article critically reviews selected literature on the effects of information-processing skills, preferred movement time, experience, and task difficulty on performance during coincident timing tasks. Theoretical information and research findings are discussed, and their applications to clinical practice are considered. Clinical recommendations include assessment of coincident timing skills and use of functional activities that provide opportunities to explore and dynamically interact with the environment. 
1	Successful reinduction therapy with amsacrine and cyclocytidine in acute nonlymphoblastic leukemia in children. A report from the Childrens Cancer Study Group. Amsacrine (AMSA) and cyclocytidine were studied as retrieval therapy in 122 pediatric patients with acute nonlymphoblastic leukemia (ANLL). Patients either failed to achieve sustained initial remissions or were in relapse. Induction therapy consisted of intravenous (IV) AMSA (75 mg/m2) from days 1 to 5 and subcutaneous cyclocytidine (600 mg/m2) from days 1 to 7. Maintenance therapy consisted of IV etoposide (VP-16) (100 mg/m2) for 5 days and IV AMSA (100 mg/m2) on day 1. Of 122 patients, 109 were evaluable. There were 13 early deaths. Ninety-six patients received adequate therapy defined as completion of two courses of therapy. Of these 96 patients, 52 achieved complete remission. Fifteen of 33 patients who failed initial induction achieved complete remission. Eighteen of 39 patients who were resistant to anthracyclines had complete responses. There was no direct evidence of AMSA-induced cardiotoxicity. Remission duration was 28 days to 3 or more years (median, 98 days). AMSA and cyclocytidine were effective retrieval therapy for patients who were in relapse or unresponsive to frontline therapy. Duration of remission was short (median, 98 days). 
1	Lymphokine-activated killer (LAK) cells. V. 8-Mercaptoguanosine as an IL-2-sparing agent in LAK generation. Guanine ribonucleosides, substituted at the C8 position with either a bromine or a thiol group, have recently been shown to regulate several immunologic responses. We have previously shown that 8-mercaptoguanosine (8MG) can replace the requirement for cytokines in the generation of MHC-restricted CTL. In this paper, we examined the ability of 8MG to induce MHC-nonrestricted killer cells. We found that 8MG did not induce significant lytic activity from normal resting lymphocytes. However, 8MG was able to synergize with minimal amounts of IL-2 in inducing lytic activity similar to lymphokine-activated killers (LAK) in that both NK-sensitive and NK-resistant tumor cells were killed. Both the precursors and effectors of 8MG-LAK activity were similar to NK cells and were CD4- CD8- asialo-GM1+ NK1.1+. Similar to IL-2-induced LAK, 8MG-LAK were B220+. 8MG appeared to "stage" these precursor lymphocytes to become more responsive to IL-2 because optimal induction of 8MG-LAK required preincubation with 8MG before the addition of IL-2. This "staging" appeared to be due to the release of a "second signal" since it was readily inhibited by cyclosporine A. Anti-IFN-alpha beta was as efficient as cyclosporine A in inhibiting 8MG-LAK generation, whereas anti-IFN-gamma and anti-IL-1 did not exhibit significant inhibition. These findings suggest that 8MG can be of possible utility as an IL-2-sparing agent in LAK generation from NK cells. 
3	Effects of dietary calcium on nimodipine-sensitive calcium channel function in stroke-prone spontaneously hypertensive rats. We studied the effects of dietary Ca2+ on blood pressure, survival, and calcium channel function to investigate cardiovascular disease mechanisms in stroke-prone spontaneously hypertensive rats. Beginning at 3 weeks of age, rats were fed high sodium chloride diets (8.0%) in combination with either high (2.0%) or low (0.2%) Ca2+ diets for 8 weeks. At 12 weeks of age, survival was 90% in the high Ca2+ group and 30% in the low Ca2+ group. The higher blood pressure and lower survival in the low Ca2+ group suggest an intensification of altered vascular muscle cell mechanisms by a dietary Ca2+ deficit. Nimodipine (1-10 nM) effectively blocked L-type Ca2+ currents in isolated vascular muscle cells from both groups. Contraction of isolated cells that were not patch clamped to high potassium solutions were also blocked by 1 nM nimodipine. Disappearance of the L-type Ca2+ channel current was accelerated by holding at depolarizing potentials (positive to -50 mV) and by depolarizing steps to 0 mV. Nimodipine block of the L-type Ca2+ currents in vascular muscle is believed to contribute substantially to antihypertensive properties and stroke prevention, actions that may develop fully only in stroke-prone spontaneously hypertensive rats on a diet of at least normal Ca2+. 
5	Respiratory distress in a child in the office. We have reviewed respiratory distress from a pathophysiologic approach. Two specific disease entities, epiglottitis and asthma, which commonly present with respiratory distress, are reviewed. The office management of respiratory distress encompasses early recognition of disease to prevent symptoms from progressing. Referral should be considered in any difficult cases. 
4	Effects of renin inhibition in systemic hypertension. The effect of the direct renin inhibitor enalkiren (Abbott Laboratories) was examined in 8 healthy patients with essential hypertension. With an unrestricted sodium diet, plasma renin concentration was inhibited within 10 minutes by intravenous enalkiren and remained essentially undetectable for greater than or equal to 6 hours (11.9 +/- 4 to 1.0 +/- 0.6 ng angiotensin I/ml/hour, p less than 0.05). Mean arterial blood pressure declined gradually (108 +/- 5 to 84 +/- 4 mm Hg, p = 0.02), as did plasma aldosterone concentration (14.4 +/- 3.8 to 4.4 +/- 0.8 ng/dl, p = 0.03), whereas plasma immunoreactive active renin concentration increased progressively (35 +/- 14 to 160 +/- 60 pg/ml, p greater than 0.05). Urinary excretion of the stable metabolite of prostacyclin (6-keto-prostaglandin F1 alpha) decreased slightly, but not significantly (42 +/- 10 to 33 +/- 11 ng/g creatinine, p = 0.13). The addition of a diuretic decreased baseline blood pressure and increased baseline plasma renin and aldosterone values. Blood pressure responses to enalkiren were slightly (though not significantly) greater than those observed before diuretic administration. We conclude that enalkiren is effective in decreasing blood pressure and in inhibiting the renin system, without significantly altering urinary prostacyclin excretion, in patients with essential hypertension. These results suggest that the renin system contributes to the maintenance of elevated blood pressure in some patients with essential hypertension. 
5	New biological properties of pyrroloquinoline quinone and its related compounds: inhibition of chemiluminescence, lipid peroxidation and rat paw edema. Pyrroloquinoline quinone (PQQ) inhibited the chemiluminescence (CL) from mouse peritoneal cells initiated by zymosan, carrageenin and N-formyl-methionyl-leucyl-phenylalanine and CL generated by the xanthine-xanthine oxidase reaction and the lipid peroxidation in the rat brain homogenate. The inhibitory activity of PQQ was more potent than that of idebenone, alpha-tocopherol and ascorbic acid in all the three assay systems. In the xanthine-xanthine oxidase reaction, PQQ had no effect on the formation of uric acid at the concentration of CL inhibition. These results suggest that PQQ might have a radical scavenger-like activity. Structure-activity relationship of PQQ and its six related compounds showed that the 7- and 9-carboxyl groups of PQQ as well as the orthoquinone structure are responsible for the radical scavenger-like activity. In addition, the -NH group in the pyrrole ring of PQQ seemed to be essential for the antilipid peroxidative activity in the rat brain homogenate. When administered i.p., PQQ inhibited the development of 0.1% carrageenin-induced paw edema in rats. These results suggest that PQQ might have therapeutic effects on various diseases, of which development or exacerbation has been known to be associated with radical oxygens. 
2	Pancreatic pseudocysts. When to drain, when to wait. Acute pain in the upper abdomen in a patient recovering from pancreatitis or abdominal trauma may herald a pancreatic pseudocyst. Although small cysts resolve spontaneously, those larger than 6 cm across usually require treatment to prevent such complications as rupture into adjacent structures and infection. The authors describe operative and nonoperative treatment methods and the success reported with each. 
2	Evaluation of the magnitude of gastro-oesophageal reflux in Barrett's oesophagus. A manometric study to determine the role of gastro-oesophageal reflux in Barrett's oesophagus was performed on 20 patients with Barrett's oesophagus and 53 patients with reflux oesophagitis without Barrett's oesophagus (25 with mild oesophagitis and 28 with severe oesophagitis). For the same reason, the 20 patients with Barrett's oesophagus also underwent 24 hour continuous oesophageal pH monitoring, and the results obtained were compared with those of 20 oesophagitis patients without Barrett's oesophagus (10 with mild oesophagitis and 10 with severe oesophagitis). The manometric results show that the motor changes found in the Barrett's group are specific but similar to the motor dysfunction associated with reflux oesophagitis. Motor anomalies are probably related more to the inflammatory process in the oesophageal wall than to the metaplastic changes themselves. The pH monitoring results show that while reflux in the Barrett's oesophagus patients was greater overall than in the oesophagitis group without Barrett's oesophagus, the changes are similar when the results are compared with the severe oesophagitis group. In conclusion there are other factors besides gastro-oesophageal reflux involved in the pathogenesis of Barrett's oesophagus. 
4	Comparison of epicardial coronary artery tone and reactivity in Prinzmetal's variant angina and chronic stable angina pectoris It has been suggested that a generalized coronary vasomotion disorder is present in variant angina and that evaluation of baseline coronary artery tone may be useful for predicting the occurrence of coronary artery spasm. The vasomotor response of angiographically normal proximal and distal coronary artery segments was studied in 9 patients with atypical chest pain and normal coronary arteriograms (control group), 13 patients with active variant angina and 41 patients with chronic stable angina. Ergonovine (intravenous, 100 to 300 micrograms, or intracoronary, 8 to 20 micrograms, was administered to all 22 patients in the control and variant angina groups and to 11 of the 41 patients with chronic stable angina. All patients also received intracoronary isosorbide dinitrate (1 to 2 mg). Computerized coronary artery diameter measurement of angiographically normal segments was carried out before and after ergonovine and nitrate administration. Mean baseline intraluminal diameter of proximal and distal coronary segments was not significantly different in control patients and those with variant angina (nonspastic segments only) or coronary artery disease (proximal 2.89 +/- 0.15, 2.83 +/- 0.14 and 2.82 +/- 0.09 mm; distal 1.60 +/- 0.08, 1.63 +/- 0.07 and 1.62 +/- 0.06 mm, respectively). After ergonovine, proximal segments constricted by 10 +/- 2%, 15 +/- 3% and 11 +/- 4% and distal segments by 11 +/- 3%, 11 +/- 2% and 14 +/- 3% in control, variant angina and coronary artery disease groups, respectively (p = NS). 
1	Intraepithelial bodies in colorectal adenomas: Leuchtenberger bodies revisited. The presence of intraepithelial inclusion bodies (Leuchtenberger bodies) was recorded in rectal or colonic specimens from 130 patients. Large to moderate number of intraepithelial bodies were recorded in 81.8 percent of 55 colorectal adenomas from patients with familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP). Conversely, none of the 55 non-FAP adenomas or of the 20 specimens with ulcerative colitis (10 with dysplasia) had similar amounts of intraepithelial granules. Feulgen studies demonstrated that the granules contain DNA and are probably nuclear fragments of destroyed lymphocytes. Although the pathogenesis of this phenomenon remains obscure, it appears that the presence of large to moderate number of intraepithelial bodies in colorectal adenomas should strongly raise the suspicion of FAP. 
2	Propofol as an i.v. anaesthetic induction agent in variegate porphyria. The choice of an i.v. anaesthetic induction poses problems for the anaesthetist confronted with a patient with one of the acute porphyrias. We undertook a prospective clinical trial in 13 variegate porphyric subjects using propofol as an anaesthetic induction agent. Urinary porphyrin precursors and porphyrins were measured before operation and 1-5 days after operation. Stool and plasma porphyrin concentrations were measured over the same period. Comparison of these data in the porphyric patients and in 21 control subjects over the trial period revealed no significant change in porphyrin or porphyrin precursor output after operation. Urinary porphyrin precursor concentrations did not exceed the limits established for variegate porphyric patients in remission, and there were no changes in the stool and plasma porphyrin profiles or any symptoms of an acute porphyric attack. We conclude that propofol did not appear to be porphyrinogenic when used for the induction of anaesthesia in 13 patients with variegate porphyria. 
5	Long-term followup of asymptomatic microhematuria. We present a 10 to 20-year followup assessment of 191 patients with unexplained microhematuria (including persons with insignificant lesions). Genitourinary malignancies did not develop in any of the patients (128 alive and 27 dead) evaluated after the first diagnostic investigation. Patient and physician compliance with followup protocols was poor. We currently recommend renal ultrasound and cystoscopy for the first diagnostic survey, have abandoned routine periodic studies and advise diagnostic studies only for patients in whom symptoms develop. 
1	Primary undifferentiated small cell carcinoma of the esophagus: clinicopathological and flow cytometric evaluation of eight cases. We present a clinicopathological and flow cytometric evaluation of eight primary small cell carcinomas of the esophagus representing 1.5% of all esophageal malignancies diagnosed during a 22-year period (1965-1987) in the Tampere University Central Hospital. The mean age of the patients (four male and four female) was 67 years (range 55-75 years). Five cases had distant metastases at the time of diagnosis. Three patients were treated by esophageal resection, one by laser vaporisation, and four by chemotherapy. The median survival time was 4 months (range 9 days to 8 months). A complete local response to chemotherapy in serial esophagogramms was detected in one patient. All four patients given chemotherapy survived longer than those treated with esophageal resection only. Four (67%) of the six carcinomas analyzed by DNA flow cytometry contained DNA-aneuploid stemlines. The median S-phase fraction of these small cell carcinomas was high (16.3%), reflecting rapid cell proliferation rate, which may be related to their responsiveness to chemotherapy. 
4	Choice of drug treatment for elderly hypertensive patients. It is generally agreed that moderate and severe hypertension in the elderly should be treated, but it is not clear which drug or drugs are most appropriate. Thiazide diuretics are inexpensive and effective, but they are associated with metabolic side effects that are becoming less acceptable as newer agents become available. Beta blockers are effective, but can be associated with central nervous system side effects and are often contraindicated by coexisting disease. Recently, attention has been focused on the newer agents, including calcium antagonists and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors. The advantage of calcium antagonists is that they do not produce metabolic side effects. However, they are expensive and may cause vasodilatory side effects. The angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors are effective and relatively free of side effects and may be particularly useful for elderly hypertensive patients with congestive heart failure. 
5	Solitary, isolated metastasis from Ewing's sarcoma to the brain: case report. We report a case of a 30-year-old woman who developed an intraparenchymal cerebral metastasis from a Ewing's sarcoma of the chest wall diagnosed and treated 3 years earlier and in apparent remission at the time of the neurological presentation (seizures). The case was complicated by a spontaneous preoperative intratumoral hemorrhage that occurred the morning of the scheduled surgical resection and caused a left dense hemiparesis. The tumor and the hematoma were removed. The patient improved after surgical intervention and a postoperative course of cranial irradiation followed by systemic chemotherapy was given. Nineteen months after treatment the patient remains disease-free from the clinical and radiological standpoint. 
5	Maternal predictors of fetal demise in trauma during pregnancy. Trauma complicates 6 to 7 per cent of all pregnancies, but fetal demise secondary to maternal trauma occurs much less frequently. This study was done to analyze the incidence of fetal demise as a function of 21 maternal characteristics determined within the first 24 hours after trauma. Nine instances of fetal demise were identified from 73 pregnant patients with trauma admitted to four Level I trauma centers from a combined data base of 30,000 patients. Maternal factors examined by logistic regression were Injury Severity Score (ISS), Trauma Score (TS), Abbreviated Injury Scale (AIS), fluid requirements in the initial 24 hours, systolic blood pressure (SBP), heart rate (HR), hemoglobin, hematocrit and arterial blood gas analysis. Fetal demise was found to be associated with increasing ISS, increasing face and abdominal AIS, increasing fluid requirements, maternal acidosis and maternal hypoxia. Standard maternal laboratory and physiologic parameters, such as hemoglobin and hematocrit, oxygen and hemoglobin saturation, partial pressure of carbon dioxide, SBP and HR were not predictive. The TS was also found to be nonpredictive. 
1	Total bladder replacement using detubularized sigmoid colon: technique and results. We performed total bladder replacement with a detubularized segment of sigmoid colon in patients after cystoprostatectomy. The surgical technique and long-term results in 27 patients are reported. This neobladder configuration compared favorably with other neobladder types regarding ease of construction. The surgical complications were acceptable. Initial reservoir function was good but improved further with time. After 1 year the capacity averaged 600 cc, pressures during filling and at capacity were low (average 12 and 16 cm. water) and emptying was satisfactory (residual urine 4 to 80 cc). All patients were continent during the day and 67% were continent at night without excessive voiding habits. Nighttime incontinence was further resolved in 2 patients by using the AMS 800 artificial sphincter around the bulbous urethra. The detubularized sigmoid is an excellent neobladder configuration after cystoprostatectomy. 
4	Balloon rupture due to lesion morphology during coronary angioplasty. We report a case of coronary angioplasty of a left anterior descending artery lesion that was complicated by the rupture of three successive balloon catheters. Each rupture occurred as a pinhole jet of contrast into a diagonal side branch, causing subintimal staining. This case demonstrates that balloon rupture may result from lesion morphology. 
5	The efficacy of palliative and definitive percutaneous versus surgical drainage of pancreatic abscesses and pseudocysts: a prospective study of 85 patients. We compared the efficacy of percutaneous to surgical drainage in a prospective study in 85 patients with pancreatic abscesses and pseudocysts. Percutaneous drainage of pancreatic abscesses in 18 patients cured three and palliated 12 who were eventually cured by elective surgical ablation; three patients died. This compares well to our 15 surgical patients, of whom four were cured by surgery alone and six were palliated. All were subsequently cured by additional computerized tomography-guided or ultrasound-guided percutaneous drainage and medical management or surgery. Five of the 15 died. Percutaneous drainage cured 11 of 14 infected pseudocysts and palliated two, which were subsequently cured by surgery; one was palliated but the patient was lost to follow-up. Surgical drainage cured six of 12 infected pseudocysts and palliated the other six, of which four were cured by further surgery and the other two were cured by secondary percutaneous drainage. Nine of 12 noninfected pseudocysts were cured by percutaneous aspiration, and two were palliated and later cured. In one patient, disease progressed, and he was ultimately lost to follow-up. Thirteen of 14 noninfected pseudocysts were cured by surgical drainage. The other patient died of pulmonary embolus. In patients treated by percutaneous techniques, there were four major complications. Our study established distinct advantages of percutaneous drainage under computerized tomographic and ultrasonic guidance: (1) the procedures can be carried out under ultrasonic guidance in an intensive care unit on critically ill patients, (2) the technique proved highly effective for initial palliation, with defervescence and stabilization occurring in most critically ill patients within 48 hours, (3) findings from fine needle aspiration provided valuable information as to microorganisms and antibiotic sensitivities and differed in 29 of 85 patients from those of concomitant blood cultures, and (4) definitive eradication of the process (surgical ablation of residual necrotic material) can be elected after the patient's clinical condition stabilizes. 
1	The neuroradiology of visual disturbances. The neuroradiology of visual deficits has advanced dramatically in recent years. Plain film evaluation of the orbit and face remains useful in the emergency room for the evaluation of trauma. High-resolution coronal CT remains the method of choice in the assessment of serious injury to the orbit and in cases of penetrating metallic foreign body. The contrast-enhanced orbital CT provides useful information in cases of tumor and infection and when the bones of the face or skull are involved. MRI has largely replaced CT in the search for brain infarct, brain tumor, and cerebral inflammatory and demyelinating processes. MRI is the study of choice in all cases of sellar and parasellar disease. It offers high-resolution images in any plane. GTPA enhancement has provided additional information from MRI without significant risk. The final selection of an imaging modality should be based upon the clinical presentation and any physical limitations of the patient. 
4	Maternal and fetal effects of labetalol in pregnant ewes. Labetalol has been advocated to rapidly decrease blood pressure in preeclamptic women and to blunt the hemodynamic response to tracheal intubation. To assess labetalol's actions in a setting of uterine vasoconstriction, saline or labetalol (1 mg/kg) was infused into maternal venous catheters in 12 pregnant ewes receiving continuous maternal intravenous infusions of norepinephrine. Norepinephrine increased maternal mean arterial pressure (MAP) to 120 +/- 4% of control and decreased uterine blood flow to 45 +/- 6% of control. Labetalol, but not saline, altered these parameters: it decreased MAP to 101 +/- 3% and increased uterine blood flow to 70 +/- 7% of prenorepinephrine values. In the second protocol, to assess the degree of labetalol-induced fetal adrenergic blockade, 7 pregnant ewes received, on separate days, saline or labetalol (0.3, 1.0, 3.0 mg/kg) via a maternal venous catheter. Maternally administered labetalol produced minor (less than 12%) decreases in maternal and fetal MAP, without significantly altering heart rate (HR). At each labetalol dose, the degree of alpha- and beta-adrenergic blockade, determined by phenylephrine and isoproterenol challenge, was greater in the ewe than in the fetus. In the near-term pregnant ewe, intravenous (iv) bolus administration of labetalol ameliorated the effects of increased circulating norepinephrine on maternal MAP, uterine blood flow, and fetal pH and arterial O2 tension (PaO2), and produced less adrenergic blockade in the fetus than in the mother. 
5	Aminocaproic acid prophylaxis in traumatic hyphema. Oral aminocaproic acid has been shown to be effective in clot stabilization and in the reduction of secondary bleeding rates in cases of traumatic hyphema. In a retrospective study of 105 patients treated during a 1-year period, we found the incidence of rebleeding in patients with traumatic hyphema who received aminocaproic acid prophylaxis was 2%; the incidence in those who did not was 25%. 
5	Chronic posterior subluxation and dislocation of the radial head. The clinical and radiographic features of chronic posterior subluxation or dislocation of the radial head were studied in thirty-four elbows of twenty-seven patients. Three characteristic radiographic types were noted: Type I, subluxation; Type II, posterior dislocation with minimum displacement; and Type III, posterior dislocation with substantial proximal migration of the radius. Follow-up of eighteen patients (twenty-one elbows) revealed that posterior displacement did not usually cause serious functional impairment except for loss of rotation of the forearm. The least common presentation, Type-I subluxation, caused pain and clicking and was associated with late degenerative arthritis. Cosmetic deformity due to prominence of the radial head was also a cosmetic problem, particularly with Type-III dislocation. 
3	Surgical treatment of a rare congenital anomaly of the vertebral artery: case report and review of the literature. A case of an abnormal loop of the vertebral artery compressing both the cervicomedullary junction and the accessory nerve is reported. The embryological development of the vertebrobasilar system may explain this anatomical anomaly. The possibility of an abnormal location of the vertebral artery may complicate the lateral C1-C2 puncture for myelography. Only five similar cases have been reported previously, but none of them presented any clinical symptomatology, and surgical treatment was never required. The present patient was cured by microvascular decompression. The pathogenetic and surgical implications are discussed in light of the literature. 
1	Concurrent cisplatin, infusional fluorouracil, and conventionally fractionated radiation therapy in head and neck cancer: dose-limiting mucosal toxicity. After a preliminary dose-finding study involving 12 patients with advanced or locally recurrent head and neck cancer, 27 patients were treated on a phase II protocol, using fluorouracil 350 mg/m2/d by continuous intravenous (IV) infusion over 5 days, followed on the sixth day by a 2-hour IV infusion of cisplatin 50 mg/m2, administered during the first and fourth weeks of radiation therapy to total doses between 60 and 64 Gy, using 2 Gy daily fractions. Eight of these 27 patients had American Joint Committee on Cancer Staging (AJCC) stage III disease, and 12 had stage IV disease. Four had recurrent disease after surgery. Three-year follow-up is now available. Twenty-one (77.8%) remitted completely following treatment, and 11 remain free of local and regional relapse at 3 years. Four have developed systemic metastases. Following successful salvage treatment in two cases, estimated determinate survival at 3 years is 64%. Acute toxicity was manageable with this regime. Eleven instances of grade 3 Radiation Therapy Oncology Group/European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer (RTOG/EORTC) mucositis were observed, which caused interruptions to radiotherapy in only four cases. No late sequelae have so far been recorded. It is concluded that the protocol described is tolerable but probably did not cause a greater number of locoregional "cures" than would have been expected following conventional radiotherapy alone in this group of patients. The use of infusional fluorouracil with concurrent conventionally fractionated radiation therapy and cisplatin infusion results in mucositis that limits the dose of fluorouracil to levels that are probably subtherapeutic. 
1	Characterization of liver-associated natural killer cells in patients with liver tumors. The existence of a marginal lymphocyte population in rat liver sinusoids has already been demonstrated using the sinusoidal lavage method. We used the same technique to study the lymphocyte population in human liver obtained ex vivo after partial hepatectomy for benign or malignant tumors and compared it with peripheral and portal blood lymphocyte populations. Percentages of lymphocyte surface phenotypes were evaluated by flow cytometry. The lymphocyte population obtained from human liver is mainly made up of CD56+ (35%) cells. This percentage is three times greater than that found in peripheral and portal blood. Two-color flow cytometry analysis showed that within the CD56+ liver cell population, at least three distinct subsets could be found: (a) CD3+/CD56+/CD16-; (b) CD3-/CD56+/CD16-; and (c) CD3-/CD56+/CD16+. Although these subsets were also present in peripheral and portal blood, the percentage distribution was completely different because most CD56+ cells in peripheral and portal blood belonged to the CD3-/CD56+/CD16+ subset. These results show the existence of a heterogeneous natural killer cell population in human livers with tumors. The functional significance of this heterogeneity still needs to be explained. 
5	Local hypothermia to prolong safe tourniquet time. Local hypothermia was studied as a method to safely prolong tourniquet time for reconstructive procedures of the upper extremity. An ice blanket constructed of flannel cloth and cold gel packs was applied to the limb for 45 minutes preoperatively. Seventy-eight patients were evaluated for complications resulting from hypothermia and prolonged tourniquet application. The duration of continuous tourniquet ischemia averaged two hours and 25 minutes. Intraoperative muscle temperature recordings indicated that the iced limbs were an average of 12.9 degrees cooler than noniced limbs before tourniquet inflation. Electron microscopic studies of biopsied muscle showed no evidence of ischemic changes. There were no postoperative complications associated with prolonged tourniquet inflation or the hypothermia blanket technique. Local hypothermia appears to be a safe and effective method of decreasing the adverse effects of tourniquet ischemia and allowing continuous tourniquet inflation time to extend safely beyond the customary two-hour limit. 
3	Central nervous system tuberculosis in children: a review of 30 cases. The medical records of 30 children with central nervous system tuberculosis (CNS tuberculosis) who were treated between March, 1976, and February, 1989, were reviewed. All had cranial computerized tomography scans at presentation. The mean cerebrospinal fluid leukocyte count was 200/mm3, protein 239 mg/dl, glucose 25 mg/dl and CSF/serum glucose ratio 21%. Mantoux skin tests with 5 tuberculin units were greater than or equal to 10 mm induration in 50%, and chest radiographs were positive in 40% of patients. Hydrocephalus was demonstrated by cranial computerized tomography in all 30 patients (100%). Cranial computerized tomography scan demonstrating hydrocephalus is a sensitive radiographic nervous system tuberculosis and should be part of the early evaluation of children with suspected central nervous system tuberculosis. 
1	Pseudocyst of the auricle. Case report and world literature review We treated a patient with pseudocyst of the auricle and reviewed the 113 cases previously published in the world literature. Pseudocyst of the auricle is an asymptomatic, noninflammatory cystic swelling that involves the anthelix of the ear, results from an accumulation of fluid within an unlined intracartilaginous cavity, and occurs predominantly in men (93% of patients). Characteristically, only one ear is involved (87% of patients), and the lesion is usually located within the scaphoid or triangular fossa of the anthelix. Previous trauma to the involved ear is uncommon. The diagnosis may be suggested by the clinical features, and analysis of the aspirated cystic fluid and/or histologic examination of a lesional biopsy specimen will confirm the diagnosis. Therapeutic intervention that maintains the architecture of the patient's external ear should be used in the treatment of this benign condition. 
1	Prognostic factors for survival of patients with advanced urothelial tumors treated with methotrexate, vinblastine, doxorubicin, and cisplatin chemotherapy. Between February 1983 and February 1986, 132 patients with advanced urothelial tract tumors were treated with methotrexate, vinblastine, Adriamycin (doxorubicin), and cisplatin (M-VAC) chemotherapy. Analysis of prognostic factors for survival of the first 92 patients was undertaken using the Cox proportional hazards model. Normal alkaline phosphatase and high Karnofsky performance status (KPS) were predominant for long survival. Patients 60 years or older at initiation of therapy were likely to survive longer than younger patients, perhaps indicating physician selectivity of older patients for this therapy, and those with initial hemoglobin in the normal range were also likely to survive longer. The additional 40 patients' data were used to validate the model. Clinical implications of the prognostic factors are discussed. 
3	Movement disorders--limb movement and the basal ganglia. The primary concern of this article is to review experimental methods that may lead to a better understanding of the functional role of the basal ganglia in the control of movement. Two models of basal ganglia impairment are considered: Parkinson's disease and Huntington's disease. The review focuses primarily on akinesia and bradykinesia because they are key abnormalities of basal ganglia dysfunction. In general, through electromyography and kinematic analysis of movement, it may be possible to characterize specific movement disorders. Specifically, if damage sustained by the central nervous system is traced to a certain structure, it may provide insight on the extent of involvement and functional role of that structure in the control of movement. Much of the data reviewed suggests that the basal ganglia may play a specific role in the initiation and regulation of force control. 
5	Hyperammonemic encephalopathy in urinary diversion with urea-splitting urinary tract infection. We present two cases of hyperammonemic encephalopathy secondary to urea-splitting urinary tract infection with urinary diversion. One patient had a ureterosigmoidostomy, the other an ileal loop diversion. Neither patient had significant underlying liver disease, but both had considerable muscle atrophy that may have predisposed them to develop hyperammonemia. Medical therapy did not provide long-term control of symptoms. In both cases, hyperammonemic encephalopathy resolved after revision of their urinary diversions. The probable mechanism of the metabolic derangements produced by urea-splitting urinary tract infections is reviewed. We suggest that patients with urinary diversion who develop hyperammonemic encephalopathy secondary to a urea-splitting urinary tract infection be treated with surgical revision of the urinary system to improve drainage and decrease bowel contact time. 
3	Postischemic (S)-emopamil therapy ameliorates focal ischemic brain injury in rats. (S)-Emopamil is a calcium channel blocker of the phenylalkylamine class, having potent serotonin S2 antagonistic properties and high blood-brain barrier penetrability. Previous studies have documented cerebroprotective effect in animal models of both focal and global ischemia. The present study was undertaken to define the postischemic "window" of therapeutic efficacy for this agent. Sprague-Dawley rats were subjected to permanent proximal middle cerebral artery occlusion, combined with an initial 30-minute period of halothane-induced hypotension (50 mm Hg). (S)-Emopamil (20 mg/kg) was administered intraperitoneally either 20-30 minutes prior to middle cerebral artery occlusion or 1 hour, 2 hours, or 3 hours following occlusion. Treated groups received a second similar dose 2.5 hours later and twice daily for 2 days thereafter. Brains were perfusion-fixed on the third day. Planimetric analysis of hemotoxylin and eosin-stained coronal brain sections documented a cortical infarct averaging 72.9 +/- 33.3 mm3 (mean +/- SD) in untreated rats. Cortical infarct volume was reduced by 48% (to 37.6 +/- 27.6 mm3) when therapy was initiated 1 hour postischemia (p less than 0.05). When treatment was deferred to 2 hours postichemia, mean cortical infarct volume was reduced by 34%, but this difference did not attain statistical significance. Infarct volume in rats with treatment initiated at 3 hours postischemia was indistinguishable from that in controls. Striatal infarct volume was similar in all groups. These results document a postischemic therapeutic window of cerebroprotection for (S)-emopamil lying between 1 and 2 hours after middle cerebral artery occlusion. 
3	Recurrent transient ischemic attacks and stroke in association with an internal carotid artery web Fibromuscular dysplasia is a nonatherosclerotic vascular disease that most commonly affects cervical carotid arteries at the C1-C2 level when cephalic arteries are involved. Several histopathologic and angiographic subtypes of fibromuscular dysplasia exist; most have a benign natural history. We describe the third reported case of a pathologically proven, symptomatic proximal internal carotid artery web and suggest that patients with this lesion are at a higher risk for stroke. 
4	Occult vascular malformations of the optic chiasm: magnetic resonance imaging diagnosis and surgical laser resection. Angiographically occult vascular malformations of the optic nerve and chiasm are extremely rare. Before the advent of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), it was difficult to diagnose these lesions preoperatively. We report MRI scan findings of optic chiasm cavernous angiomas in two patients with chiasmal syndrome. MRI was useful in localizing the vascular malformation and delineating its characteristics, especially chronic hemorrhage. One patient underwent biopsy of the lesion. The other patient underwent complete microsurgical resection of the malformation with the carbon dioxide laser with preservation of vision. Occult vascular malformations of the optic nerve and chiasm may be a more common cause of visual deterioration than previously recognized. The MRI scan is the imaging modality of choice for diagnosing and following these lesions. In certain patients, these vascular malformations may be amenable to complete surgical removal with stabilization or improvement of visual function. 
5	Acute upper gastrointestinal bleeding in elderly persons [clinical conference] We have seen that UGI bleeding is a serious and apparently growing problem for seniors. Of special concern in the older patient are the frequency with which serious peptic disease presents silently, the limitation frequently imposed on adequate pain relief from NSAIDs, and the higher complication rates from most of the causes of UGI bleeding. Care of the elderly would be enhanced by research focused on defining those older patients most at risk of experiencing NSAID-induced peptic complications, improved methods for preventing or treating NSAID-induced ulceration that are well tolerated and cost-effective, and better regimens for preventing the recurrence of ulcers and UGI bleeding in these patients. In regard to the last, future investigation of the role of H. pylori, methods for successfully eliminating the organism, and the effect of eradication on patients' subsequent course may be particularly helpful. 
1	Cyclic-AMP binding proteins in the head and neck. Results are presented of a preliminary study in which cAMP binding activity was measured in 34 specimens from a variety of head and neck sites. A wide range of cAMP binding protein levels was detected in all tissues assessed. There appeared to be a subgroup of parotid adenomas with increased cAMP binding activity. The biological significance of these proteins remains to be determined and their relationship to tumour growth in the head and neck is likely to be complex. 
5	Metastatic small cell tumor of bone with 'true' rosettes and glial fibrillary acidic protein positivity. A 15-year-old black girl was admitted to St. Jude Children's Research Hospital with a lytic lesion involving the right fourth metacarpal bone with a solitary metastasis to the ipsilateral axillary lymph node. Histologic examination of both the primary lesion and metastasis revealed a primitive small round cell lesion. Abundant rosettes with central lumina were present in the metastasis. Immunohistochemical stains performed on sections of the metastasis were strongly positive for glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) and negative for neuron-specific enolase (NSE), S-100 protein, and Leu-7. Electron microscopic examination of the metastasis revealed lumen formation with apical microvilli and juxtaluminal junctional complexes. This tumor exhibits features that are suggestive, but not definitive, of primitive ependymal differentiation and further expands the morphologic and immunophenotypic range of small round cell tumors of bone. 
3	Total knee arthroplasty in rheumatoid arthritis. A comparison of the polycentric and total condylar prostheses. From 1971 to 1985, 393 total knee arthroplasties (TKAs) were performed in patients for rheumatoid arthritis. Of these, 112 used polycentric prostheses and 131 used total condylar prostheses. One hundred seven of the patients with polycentric prostheses and 102 of the patients with total condylar prostheses were followed for a minimum of two years (average, 61 and 55 months, respectively). At the time of the latest examination, nine knees with polycentric prostheses required revision surgery: six for tibial component loosening and instability and three for patellofemoral pain. Five knees with total condylar prostheses required revision: one for chronic instability, one for a late posttraumatic patellar fracture, and three for late hematogenous infections. The total condylar prostheses with patellar resurfacing had better scores for pain (8.5 points) than the polycentric prosthesis without patellofemoral resurfacing (7.0 points). The total condylar prosthesis appeared more durable in terms of fixation, with no evidence of aseptic loosening of femoral or tibial components noted in this series thus far. 
1	Effect of hyperthermia in vitro and in vivo on adenine and pyridine nucleotide pools in human peripheral lymphocytes. Hyperthermia has been shown in vitro and in vivo to potentiate the effects of ionizing irradiation. Previous studies found that hyperthermia alters the metabolism of adenosine diphosphate (ADP)-ribose polymers required for recovery from DNA damage and that poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase activity is very sensitive to cellular nicotinamide-adenine dinucleotide (NAD) levels. Thus, the effect of 41.8 degrees C hyperthermia in vitro and in vivo on NAD and adenosine triphosphate (ATP) levels was studied in human peripheral lymphocytes. In vitro studies showed significant decreases in oxidized NAD (NAD+) and ATP levels after heating that simulated a clinical whole-body hyperthermia (WBH) treatment. This nucleotide depletion could not be attributed to nucleotide leakage or increased enzymatic NAD+ consumption. As the reduction of NAD observed was sufficient to decrease poly(ADP-ribose)polymerase activity by 50%, the studies were extended to clinica cases. Cellular NAD+ and ATP were measured in previously stored lymphocytes obtained from four patients before and after WBH; a statistically significant decrease in NAD+ was observed after WBH which quantitatively agreed with the in vitro results. Based on these results a prospective study was done in three patients; NAD+ was extracted immediately on sample collection, and the kinetics of WBH-induced NAD depletion were studied. These data, which agree quantitatively with the laboratory results, are presented. 
5	National General Practice Study of Epilepsy: recurrence after a first seizure In the National General Practice Study of Epilepsy 564 patients classified as having definite seizures have been followed up for 2-4 years. 67% (95% confidence interval 63-71%) had a recurrence within 12 months of the first seizure, and 78% (74-81%) had a recurrence within 36 months. Seizures associated with a neurological deficit presumed present at birth had a high rate of recurrence (100% by 12 months), whereas seizures that occurred within 3 months of an acute insult to the brain, such as head injury or stroke, or in the context of an acute precipitant such as alcohol, carried a much lower risk of recurrence (40% [29-51%] by 12 months). Other factors affecting the risk of recurrence were age-the highest risk being for patients under the age of 16 (83% [77-89%] by 36 months) or over the age of 59 (83% [76-90%] by 36 months-and type of first seizure-the risk of recurrence being much higher for patients with simple partial or complex partial seizures (94% [90-99%] by 36 months) than for those with generalised tonic clonic seizures (72% [67-77%] by 36 months). 
4	Ventricular tachycardia and accelerated ventricular rhythm presenting in the first month of life. Fourteen infants aged less than 1 month presented to our institution during the last 22 years with ventricular tachycardia (VT) or accelerated ventricular rhythm and a structurally normal heart. In 2, VT was associated with long QT syndrome. Both are alive on beta-blocker therapy, 1 with an implanted pacemaker. Twelve infants had accelerated ventricular rhythm, and 2 of these died in the first 2 months of life of unrelated conditions. The other 10 are alive at a median age of 4 years (range 2 months to 11 years), and none were lost to follow-up. Hemodynamic compromise did not occur with accelerated ventricular rhythm. The ventricular rate was very close to the sinus rate in all 12, less than 12% above the sinus rate. The mean QRS duration during accelerated ventricular rhythm was 92.5 ms, and averaged twice the QRS duration during sinus rhythm. Fusion beats were seen in all 12, and there was atrioventricular dissociation with capture beats in 10. In 2, ventriculoatrial conduction was present. Treatment was attempted in 5 of the 10 survivors with accelerated ventricular rhythm, and was thought to be successful in 4. Treatment was later successfully withdrawn in all 5, so that all 10 survivors were free of accelerated ventricular rhythm and were not receiving antiarrhythmic medications at last follow-up. Because of the excellent long-term outcome and the lack of hemodynamic compromise during the rhythm, it seems reasonable to withhold antiarrhythmic therapy in infants with accelerated ventricular rhythm and await resolution of the rhythm. 
4	Enhanced utilization of exogenous glucose improves cardiac function in hypoxic rabbit ventricle without increasing total glycolytic flux. The effects of elevated glucose on cardiac function during hypoxia were investigated in isolated arterially perfused rabbit interventricular septa. Rest tension, developed tension, intracellular potential, 42K+ efflux, lactate production, exogenous glucose utilization, and tissue high-energy phosphate levels were measured during a 50-min period of hypoxia with 4, 5, or 50 mM glucose present (isosmotically balanced with sucrose) and during reoxygenation for 60 min with perfusate containing 5 mM glucose/45 mM sucrose. At physiologic (4 or 5 mM) and supraphysiologic glucose (50 mM), lactate production and high-energy phosphate levels during hypoxia were equally well maintained, yet cardiac dysfunction was markedly attenuated by 50 mM glucose. Despite identical rates of total glycolytic flux, exogenous glucose utilization was enhanced by 50 mM glucose so that tissue glycogen levels remained normal during hypoxia, whereas glycogen became depleted with 4 or 5 mM glucose present during hypoxia. Most of the beneficial effects of 50 mM glucose occurred during the first 25 min of hypoxia. Prior glycogen depletion had no deleterious effects during hypoxia with 50 mM glucose present, but exacerbated cardiac dysfunction during hypoxia with 5 mM glucose present. These findings indicate that enhanced utilization of exogenous glucose improved cardiac function during hypoxia without increasing total glycolytic flux or tissue high-energy phosphate levels, suggesting a novel cardioprotective mechanism. 
2	Successful liver transplantation in a patient with a thrombosed portomesenteric system after multiple failed shunts. Combined portal and mesenteric vein thrombosis preventing restoration of adequate portal venous flow has been considered a contraindication to liver transplantation. We report a patient with failed splenorenal (SR), portocaval (PC), and mesocaval (MC) shunts, who despite the absence of any obvious means for supplying portal venous inflow to a hepatic graft, successfully underwent orthotopic liver transplantation. A method of reconstruction of the portal vein with the use of vein grafts anastomosed to a large splanchnic venous collateral is described. This technique can be used in selected patients in whom orthotopic liver transplantation might otherwise be considered technically impossible. 
1	The importance of calcium regulation in toxic cell injury. Studies utilizing the technology of digital imaging fluorescence microscopy. The regulation of ions within the cell is of critical importance in both acute and chronic toxicology. Recently, new methods have been developed for measuring such changes in living cells and correlating them with studies of structure, function, and biochemistry. A major revolution has occurred from the linkage between the computer and the light microscope, which has resulted in the use of digital imaging fluorescence microscopy and video intensification microscopy coupled with image analysis. These methods have already yielded much additional information and it is anticipated that their further application by pathologists and toxicologists will continue to uncover the important role of ion deregulation and toxic cell injury. 
5	Mistaken diagnoses in continuous muscle fiber activity of peripheral nerve origin. The syndrome of continuous muscle fiber activity of peripheral nerve origin has manifestations that resemble those of many other more common neurologic disorders during childhood and infancy. This similarity often leads to misdiagnosis when an adequate index of suspicion is not entertained and a comprehensive electromyographic examination is not performed. Two affected patients from 1 family are reported to illustrate the type of diagnostic errors that were made before the establishment of the correct diagnosis. 
5	Studies on autoimmunity for initiation of beta-cell destruction. VI. Macrophages essential for development of beta-cell-specific cytotoxic effectors and insulitis in NOD mice. NOD mice were treated with silica (which is selectively toxic to macrophages) from 4 or 20.5 wk of age. Syngeneic neonatal pancreases were transplanted into the renal subcapsular space of the NOD mice at 21 wk of age. Silica treatment was continued until 24 wk of age, and then the mice were killed for examination of islet morphology. Neither the islets in transplanted pancreases nor the host pancreatic islets from the early long-term silica-treated animals revealed insulitis. In contrast, most of the islets in transplanted pancreases from the late short-term silica-treated animals showed severe insulitis and beta-cell necrosis, as did the host islets. A further experiment was performed to compare the effect of late short-term silica treatment with that of anti-L3T4-antibody treatment of the same time and duration. In contrast to the late short-term silica-treated animals, the transplanted pancreases in the anti-L3T4-antibody-treated animals revealed intact islets, although most of the host islets showed insulitis. The control group, which received no treatment but did receive neonatal pancreases, revealed severe insulitis and beta-cell necrosis of both transplanted and host islets. These results suggest that early macrophage depletion can abolish the development of beta-cell-specific immunologic effectors but that late macrophage depletion, after the development of insulitis, does not affect the destruction of beta-cells by preexisting effectors other than macrophages. We conclude that macrophages are essential for the development of beta-cell-specific cytotoxic effectors in the initial phase of insulitis in NOD mice. 
3	Intravenous immunoglobulin treatment in patients with chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy. Clinical and laboratory characteristics associated with improvement. Of 52 patients fulfilling the criteria of chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy, 20 (38%) did not improve after intravenous immunoglobulin treatment, two (4%) had a short-lasting improvement and subsequent infusions had no effect, nine (17%) reached a spontaneously or therapeutically induced complete remission, and 21 patients (40%) needed intermittent infusions to maintain improvement. All patients who improved initially had symptoms that significantly interfered with life-style. After treatment, 90% of these patients were independent in their daily activities. Significantly associated with improvement were disease duration of less than 1 year, progression of weakness until treatment, absence of discrepancy in weakness between arms and legs, areflexia of the arms, and slowed nerve conduction velocity of the motor median nerve. The probability of improvement if all these features are present in 93%. 
4	Panic disorder and cardiovascular/cerebrovascular problems: results from a community survey. Follow-up studies of psychiatric patients with panic disorder have shown an abnormally high mortality rate in men due to cardiovascular and cerebrovascular events. The authors report that in the New Haven portion of the Epidemiologic Catchment Area program the risk for stroke in persons with lifetime diagnoses of panic disorder was over twice that in persons with other psychiatric disorders or no psychiatric disorder. After adjustments for demographic differences between groups, the risk was even higher. While the results should be interpreted cautiously because of the small sample and absence of medical examinations, these findings are consistent with clinical studies showing an association between panic disorder and cardiovascular/cerebrovascular events. 
4	Diagnosing pulmonary embolism: new facts and strategies PURPOSE: To provide a clinical approach to the diagnosis of pulmonary embolism. DATA IDENTIFICATION: An English-language literature search using MEDLINE (1982 to 1990) and bibliographic reviews of textbooks and review articles. STUDY SELECTION: In addition to several reviews, studies that evaluated the diagnostic technology of pulmonary embolism were selected. Preference was given to studies with a prospective design, particularly those done within the past decade. DATA EXTRACTION: Studies were assessed independently by three unblinded observers. Data were chosen to describe the efficacy of diagnostic technology on the basis of disease prevalence, sensitivity and specificity, and predictive value. RESULTS OF DATA ANALYSIS: A normal lung scan or pulmonary angiogram rules out the diagnosis of clinically important pulmonary embolism with at least 95% certainty. Lung scan interpretations indicating high or low probability have approximately a 15% error in diagnosing or ruling out pulmonary embolism. The accuracy of either scan result improves when the clinical suspicion of pulmonary embolism matches the lung scan result. Serial impedance plethysmography of the lower extremities may exclude thromboembolism with 95% certainty in patients without high-probability lung scan results or cardiopulmonary disease. CONCLUSIONS: The combination of clinical suspicion and the results of the lung scan and impedance plethysmography appear to offer acceptable diagnostic accuracy in evaluating many patients suspected of having pulmonary embolism. The usefulness of this approach for patients with cardiopulmonary disease is still unknown. 
4	Oral contraceptives in women with diabetes. We evaluated the association of oral contraceptive use with the presence and severity of diabetic retinopathy, hypertension, and glycosylated hemoglobin in women of childbearing age who have diabetes. Neither current or past use nor number of years of use of oral contraceptives was associated with severity of retinopathy, hypertension, or current glycosylated hemoglobin. In conclusion, further study of various birth control methods in young women of childbearing age should be considered. 
4	Is banding of the pulmonary trunk obsolete for infants with tricuspid atresia and double inlet ventricle with a discordant ventriculoarterial connection? Role of aortic arch obstruction and subaortic stenosis Banding the pulmonary trunk may exacerbate or promote the development of subaortic stenosis in patients with double inlet ventricle or tricuspid atresia with a dominant left ventricle and discordant ventriculoarterial connection and, therefore, may be an inappropriate palliative procedure for such patients. To examine this possibility, 102 consecutive infants were studied who presented with this anatomy between 1972 and 1987. Obstruction of the aortic arch was present in 52 patients. In 28 patients (17 with aortic arch obstruction), subaortic stenosis was already apparent at presentation. Of the remaining 74 patients, 19 received no palliative surgery and 55 underwent banding of the pulmonary trunk either with (n = 22) or without (n = 33) aortic arch repair. Outcome was significantly worse in patients with associated aortic arch obstruction. All such patients either died or developed subaortic stenosis by 3 years of age (survival free of subaortic stenosis 0 of 22 versus 22 of 33 for patients with isolated banding of the pulmonary trunk, p less than 0.001). After isolated banding, there was a lower ratio of the ventricular septal defect to ascending aorta diameters at presentation in the patients who developed subaortic stenosis than in the patients who did not (0.60 +/- 0.08 versus 1.03 +/- 0.15, p less than 0.001). Of the latter, 18 (95%) of 19 patients fulfilled criteria for a Fontan procedure at recatheterization. Thus, the presence of aortic arch obstruction is associated with rapid development of subaortic stenosis after banding of the pulmonary trunk. Alternative initial surgery, even though high risk, may be indicated. In the absence of such obstruction, banding the pulmonary trunk can be performed at reasonable risk and, provided that the ventricular septal defect is of adequate size, satisfactorily prepares most patients for a later Fontan procedure. 
5	Treatment of scaphoid nonunion by radical curettage, trapezoidal iliac crest bone graft, and internal fixation with a Herbert screw. Ten adult male patients with scaphoid nonunions were treated by radical curettage, trapezoidal iliac crest bone grafting, and internal fixation with a Herbert screw. The mean patient age was 24.7 years, and the mean duration of the nonunion before surgery was 37.3 months. Mean follow-up time was 30.4 months. Nine of the ten nonunions healed, although one patient required a second bone-grafting procedure. The mean postoperative grip strength was 45.0 kg, and the mean postoperative pinch strength was 11.5 kg. The mean postoperative range of motion was volar flexion, 76.1 degrees; dorsiflexion, 74.2 degrees; radial deviation, 22.1 degrees; and ulnar deviation, 40.1 degrees. The scapholunate angle decreased from a mean of 72.8 degrees preoperatively to 60.6 degrees postoperatively (p less than 0.025). The mean carpal index was 0.57 postoperatively. Mean scaphoid length increased postoperatively and was within 0.2 mm of the opposite (normal) scaphoid in every patient except the single patient with a persistent nonunion (p less than 0.025). All patients returned to work (eight as laborers), and nine of ten wrists were subjectively rated as good or excellent. The results of the series suggests that treatment of displaced scaphoid nonunion by radical curettage, trapezoidal iliac crest bone grafting, and internal fixation with a Herbert screw is an effective method of treatment that reconstitutes scaphoid anatomy and promotes excellent wrist function. 
2	Proposal of a modified scintigraphic method to evaluate duodenogastroesophageal reflux. Hepatobiliary scintigraphy with 99mTc-HIDA offers a noninvasive method to detect duodenogastric reflux. Biliary reflux was graded using the persistence rather than the intensity of the radioactive refluxate: Grade 0 was considered the absence of reflux, minimal reflux, or reflux in the first 10-15 min; Grade 1 was repetitive reflux lasting less than 10 min; Grade 2 was persistent reflux; and Grade 3 was reflux up to the esophagus. Twenty-five patients with foregut symptoms were studied and results were compared to 24-hr gastric pH monitoring. Scintigraphy and pH monitoring agreed in 15 out of 25 patients (60%), but no correlation was found with the endoscopic findings. The rationale for this approach is based on pathophysiologic evidence that damage to gastric and/or esophageal mucosa is mainly related to the prolonged contact time with duodenal contents. This technique seems to allow a complete functional evaluation of the esophagogastroduodenal tract without causing adjunctive irradiation or discomfort to the patient. 
2	Plasma glucagon concentration in cirrhosis is related to liver function but not to portal-systemic shunting, systemic vascular resistance, or urinary sodium excretion. We tested the hypothesis that increased plasma glucagon concentration resulting from portal-systemic shunting or liver dysfunction causes arterial vasodilation and thereby stimulates sodium retention in cirrhosis. Twenty-seven studies were performed in patients with alcoholic liver disease, 11 of whom had ascites. Liver function was quantitated as the elimination rate of antipyrine, caffeine, and stable isotopes of cholic acid administered both orally (2,2,4,4-2H) and intravenously (24-13C). Portal-systemic shunt fraction was calculated as the ratio of the intravenous and oral clearances of the isotopes of cholic acid. Cardiac output was measured by using Doppler echocardiography. Plasma glucagon concentration was increased in patients with ascites when compared with that in patients without ascites (474 +/- 180 pg/ml vs 245 +/- 120 pg/ml, p = 0.0007) but was unrelated to urinary sodium excretion, heart rate, mean arterial pressure, cardiac output, and systemic vascular resistance (r = -0.48, 0.35, -0.13, 0.18, and 0.22, respectively). Plasma glucagon concentration correlated with the half-lives of all model compounds (r = 0.58, p = 0.002; r = 0.62, p = 0.0008; r = 0.62, p = 0.001; and r = 0.64, p = 0.0005; for caffeine, antipyrine, oral and intravenous cholic acid, respectively) but not with shunt fraction (r = 0.14). Increased plasma glucagon concentration in cirrhosis is probably a result of diminished hepatic clearance. However, increased plasma concentration of glucagon does not appear to cause a hyperdynamic circulatory state or sodium retention. 
5	Comparison of clinical and electrophysiologic features of preexcitation syndromes in patients presenting initially after age 50 years with those presenting at younger ages. Although patients may develop arrhythmias due to preexcitation syndromes at any time from the prenatal period to late adulthood, presentation in late adulthood is considered uncommon and has not been well studied. From June 1981 to June 1989, 73 patients were documented to have preexcitation syndromes on the basis of electrophysiologic studies. Those whose initial arrhythmias appeared at an age greater than 50 years (group 1, n = 13) were compared with the remaining 60 patients (group 2). All group 1 patients presented in the setting of acute medical or surgical diseases (n = 7), or chronic cardiac disease (n = 6) commonly associated with middle age and often with atrial arrhythmias; only 13 group 2 patients had underlying illnesses (p = 0.0001). Almost two-thirds of group 2 patients were evaluated because of narrow complex orthodromic tachycardia or palpitations and electrocardiographic evidence of preexcitation. Wide complex tachycardia was more often a reason for referral of older patients (7 of 13 vs 11 of 60, p less than 0.05), among whom atrial fibrillation/flutter also tended to be more frequent (4 of 13 vs 11 of 60, difference not significant). The PR and QRS intervals of group 1 patients were within the normal range and differed significantly from those of group 2 patients (PR, 0.15 +/- 0.04 vs 0.11 +/- 0.03 second, p less than 0.001; QRS, 0.09 +/- 0.01 vs 0.12 +/- 0.03 second, p less than 0.001), making electrocardiographic identification of preexcitation more difficult in group 1. Several factors likely contributed. 
4	UK-68,798: a novel, potent and highly selective class III antiarrhythmic agent which blocks potassium channels in cardiac cells. UK-68,798 increased the duration and effective refractory period of cardiac action potentials recorded in vitro from canine ventricular muscle and Purkinje fibers in a concentration dependent manner from 5 nM to 1 microM. The resting membrane potential, amplitude and maximum upstroke velocity of action potentials were unaffected by UK-68,798, indicating the selective class III antiarrhythmic properties of this agent. UK-68,798 (5 nM-1 microM) increased the effective refractory period of isolated guinea pig papillary muscles at stimulation frequencies of 1 Hz and 5 Hz without influencing the conduction velocity, further confirming that UK-68,798 is devoid of class I antiarrhythmic activity including block of the sodium channel. Studies using single voltage clamped guinea pig ventricular myocytes indicated that UK-68,798 at concentrations of 50 nM and 2 microM blocks a time-dependent K+ current, with no appreciable effects on the time-independent K+ current or the inward calcium current. UK-68,798 is therefore a highly selective K+ channel blocking agent with class III antiarrhythmic properties, a profile that holds considerable promise for the therapy of life-threatening cardiac arrhythmias. 
5	Rectourethral fistula caused by Kaposi's sarcoma. A 35-year-old man with the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome-related complex was evaluated for a persistent urethral discharge, pneumaturia and watery diarrhea. Radiographic and endoscopic procedures established the diagnosis of a rectourethral fistula. Perineal exploration and excision of the fistula revealed the pathological diagnosis of Kaposi's sarcoma. The differential diagnosis of an acquired rectourethral fistula and the significance of Kaposi's sarcoma are discussed. 
5	Cloning of a gene that is rearranged in patients with choroideraemia Choroideraemia (tapetochoroidal dystrophy, TCD), a common form of X-linked blindness, is characterized by progressive dystrophy of the choroid, retinal pigment epithelium and retina. Previous studies have assigned the TCD gene to a small segment of the Xq21 band. By making use of reverse genetics strategies we have isolated eight overlapping complementary DNA clones from the same chromosomal region. The corresponding gene is expressed in retina, choroid and retinal pigment epithelium. The cDNAs encompass an open reading frame of 948 base pairs that is structurally altered in eight TCD patients with deletions, and in a female patient with a balanced translocation involving Xq21. These findings provide strong evidence that we have cloned the gene underlying choroideraemia. Elucidation of its function should provide new insights into the molecular mechanisms responsible for this disorder and other hereditary retinopathies. 
5	Distribution of pulmonary capillary transit times in recruited networks. When pulmonary blood flow is elevated, hypoxemia can occur in the fastest-moving erythrocytes if their transit times through the capillaries fall below the minimum time for complete oxygenation. This desaturation is more likely to occur if the distribution of capillary transit times about the mean is large. Increasing cardiac output is known to decrease mean pulmonary capillary transit time, but the effect on the distribution of transit times has not been reported. We measured the mean and variance of transit times in single pulmonary capillary networks in the dependent lung of anesthetized dogs by in vivo videofluorescence microscopy of a fluorescein dye bolus passing from an arteriole to a venule. When cardiac output increased from 2.9 to 9.9 l/min, mean capillary transit time decreased from 2.0 to 0.8 s. Because transit time variance decreased proportionately (relative dispersion remained constant), increasing cardiac output did not alter the heterogeneity of local capillary transit times in the lower lung where the capillary bed was nearly fully recruited. 
5	Clinical characteristics and treatment of isolated inferior rectus paralysis. Isolated inferior rectus paralysis without mechanical restriction of the globe has received only scant attention in the literature. The authors report on 21 patients treated during the past 16 years. The etiology was congenital, traumatic, myasthenic, and vascular. Anomalous head posture, diplopia, or a disfiguring hypertropia were presenting symptoms. Diagnosis was made on the basis of the prism and cover test in the diagnostic positions and on examination of ductions and versions. The direction of the head tilt, the Bielschowsky head tilt test, and tests for cyclotropia are only of secondary diagnostic value since they may give paradoxical results. Surgery consisted of resection of the paralyzed muscle, combined with or without recession of its antagonist and/or recession of the contralateral superior oblique. After a mean follow-up of 17 months, 14 patients were cured, 6 had improved, and 1 remained unchanged. 
5	The natural history of lumbar intervertebral disc extrusions treated nonoperatively. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the natural history of morphologic changes within the lumbar spine in patients who sustained lumbar disc extrusions. All patients in this study were treated nonoperatively for radicular pain and neurologic loss. The following questions were addressed: 1) Does perithecal or perineural fibrosis result when extrusions are not removed surgically, and 2) Do disc extrusions spontaneously resolve, and, if so, how rapidly? The study population consisted of 11 patients with extrusions and radiculopathy. All patients were successfully treated nonoperatively. All had a primary complaint of leg pain and all had positive straight leg raising reproducing their leg pain at less than or equal to 60 degrees. Additionally, 87% had muscle weakness on a neurologic basis in a root level distribution corresponding to the site of disc pathology. Computed tomographic (CT) examinations were obtained on all patients at the inception of treatment. These studies were compared with follow-up MRI studies. The initial CT scans were evaluated for the following criteria: disc size and position, thecal sac effacement, nerve root enlargement or displacement, and evidence of central or intervertebral canal stenosis. In addition to the pathomorphology evaluated on the CT scans, follow-up MRI studies also evaluated disc hydration at the herniated and contiguous levels, and the presence of perithecal or perineural fibrosis. The following grading system was used to evaluate change in fragment size on the follow-up studies: Grade 1-0 to 50% decrease in size; Grade 2-50 to 75% decrease in size; Grade 3-75 to 100% decrease in size. 
2	Relationships of somatic symptoms to behavioral and emotional risk in young adolescents. Junior high students (n = 1508) from a midwestern community completed a health behavioral questionnaire that asked the frequency of headache and abdominal pain and of a number of behavioral and emotional risk indicators. Headache (24%) and abdominal pain (13%) were frequently reported among these young adolescents, particularly among girls. Those reporting frequent somatic complaints also reported significantly more behavioral and emotional symptoms indicative of risk (p less than 0.001). Further, the interaction between somatic complaint and gender significantly affected risk status (p less than 0.01). This interaction was greater with behavioral risk: boys with both abdominal pain and headaches reported higher behavioral risk than all other groups (p less than 0.0001). Somatic symptoms continued to account for a significant amount of variance in behavioral risk after the effects of emotional risk and age were removed. This suggests that behavioral risk and emotional risk are independently associated with somatic complaints. The evaluation of persistent somatic complaints in adolescents, particularly in boys with abdominal symptoms, should include careful examination of emotional risk factors and other health-endangering behaviors such as substance use, early sexual activity, and delinquency. 
4	Potentially lethal ventricular arrhythmias. Minimizing the danger. Patients with potentially lethal ventricular arrhythmias are at an increased risk of sudden death. Antiarrhythmic drugs, with the exception of beta blockers and possibly amiodarone, have not been particularly effective in reducing mortality. Beta blockers have been used successfully to treat survivors of myocardial infarction, including patients with significant impairment of ventricular function. Evidence to date suggests that use of low-dose amiodarone may be appropriate for selected patients with chronic heart failure and potentially lethal ventricular arrhythmias. 
5	Prehospital care: the future of emergency medical services. Most prehospital interventions, both pharmacologic and procedural, have been accepted without clear demonstrations of their abilities to impact patient outcomes or without clear indications that withholding or delaying the intervention pending arrival at a definitive emergency department will adversely affect the patient. Interventions that have the benefit of supportive research have been applied equally to urban and nonurban emergency medical services environments. In selecting interventions, inadequate consideration has been given to the differences in emergency medical services personnel training, frequencies of their exposure to patients, frequencies of skill use, and availabilities of effective continuing education programs in the urban and nonurban environments. These issues are discussed, and the necessary focus of the future of emergency medical services in urban, suburban, and rural environments is predicted. 
1	Endometrial cancer: biochemical and clinical correlates. Some endometrial cancers and endometrial adenocarcinoma cell lines show amplified expression of proto-oncogenes (fos, fms, myc, myb, neu, and erb-B) and augmented production of growth factors (colony-stimulating factor 1, epidermal growth factor, transforming growth factor-alpha, and transforming growth factor beta) and epidermal growth factor receptor. Oncogene expression, the presence of estrogen and progesterone receptors, and the fraction of cells in S phase are useful biochemical prognostic indicators of clinical outcome, and markers recognized by monoclonal antibodies are available for use in following the clinical course of the disease and responses to treatment. In vivo and in vitro studies on normal and neoplastic tissues are providing evidence of paracrine influences on epithelial cell proliferation. Long-term administration of tamoxifen as adjuvant therapy for breast cancer has recently been found to increase the risk for development of endometrial cancer. 
5	Prospective randomized comparison of esophageal variceal sclerotherapy agents: sodium tetradecyl sulfate versus sodium morrhuate. We designed a prospective randomized study to evaluate differences in efficacy and complication rate between the two most commonly used sclerosing agents, sodium tetradecyl sulfate (STD) and sodium morrhuate (MOR). Of 41 patients with acute index variceal bleeding initially evaluated, 21 were randomized to receive 0.75% STD and 20 to receive 1.6% MOR diluted with 50% dextrose. Overall mortality for the STD group was 38% and that for the MOR group was 25% (NS). Control of acute bleeding was achieved in 86% of the STD patients and 90% of the MOR patients (NS). Overall, obliteration was achieved in only 33% of the STD group and 25% of the MOR group; but in those patients who remained in the study over 3 months, obliteration was achieved in 87 and 83%, respectively (NS). There was a trend toward higher rebleeding in the STD group compared with the MOR group (81% vs. 51%) (p = 0.078), but there was no significant difference between the STD and MOR patients with regard to transfusion requirements (8.4 units/patient vs. 8.7 units/patient), ulceration (53% vs. 40%), or stricture formation (9.5% vs. 0.0%). The results of this study suggest that STD and MOR are clinically equivalent sclerosing solutions, and that bias favoring use of one agent over the other may be unfounded. 
3	Delayed facial nerve palsy after temporal lobectomy for epilepsy: report of four cases and discussion of possible mechanisms. Four cases of idiopathic peripheral facial nerve palsy were documented after 110 consecutive resections of the temporal lobe for intractable epilepsy. In 3 of the 4 cases, the palsy was ipsilateral to the side of the temporal lobectomy. The onset of facial weakness was delayed 7 to 13 days after surgery (mean, 9.7 days). One patient underwent facial electroneurography, which documented 17% of normal facial motor function at the height of his weakness and the absence of the acoustic stapedius reflex. All patients were treated with prednisone (60-80 mg per day by mouth for 10-14 days, tapering off throughout the subsequent week). Facial function recovered fully in all patients within 6 to 8 weeks. Possible mechanisms are discussed, including heat and/or mechanical trauma to the facial nerve near the geniculate ganglion during resection of mesial temporal lobe structures. 
1	Reduced psychological morbidity after breast conservation. Psychological morbidity was compared in 52 patients treated by mastectomy and 67 patients treated by lumpectomy for early breast cancer. An informal counselling service was provided for all patients. Morbidity was measured at 6, 9 and 12 months after surgery with two self-rating scales: the general health questionnaire and the Leeds depression and anxiety scales. There was a significant excess of severe depression in the mastectomy group. In contrast to the findings of previous research, this result suggests that breast conservation reduces psychological morbidity. 
4	Wives of coronary high-risk men--are they also at higher risk? The Tromso Heart Study. Blood lipids, blood pressure, body mass index (BMI), smoking, dietary and exercise habits were studied in 911 wives of men with high risk for coronary heart disease (CHD). Following the 1979/80 Tromso Survey, 1373 men, aged 30-54 years, were identified as having high risk for CHD (HDL-cholesterol/total cholesterol less than or equal to 17.6% and/or total cholesterol greater than or equal to 7.86 mmol l-1). Of the 1373 men, 911 individuals had wives who also attended the screening. These wives were compared to age-matched, married women in the general population. A significantly higher total cholesterol level (5.98 mmol l-1 vs. 5.78 mmol l-1), lower HDL-cholesterol/total cholesterol (30.01% vs. 31.58%), higher BMI and higher coronary risk score (4.55 vs. 3.82) was found among the wives of the high-risk men. Furthermore, a higher proportion of these individuals were daily cigarette smokers (47.3% vs. 42.1%), and had received fewer years of education. They also had more dietary habits associated with increased risk of CHD than other married women in the general population. Our findings support the hypothesis that members of the same household as a person with increased risk for CHD also have increased risk. This is most probably due to shared lifestyle. 
2	Involvement of thromboxane and neutrophils in multiple-system organ edema with interleukin-2. Interleukin-2 (IL-2) produces toxicity characterized by generalized edema within 24 hours. This study tests whether the rate of IL-2 administration modulates the onset of edema and examines thromboxane (Tx) and neutrophils as possible mediators of this event. Recombinant human IL-2, 10(5) U (n = 7), 10(6) U (n = 9), or vehicle (n = 8) were given to anesthetized rats intravenously during a period of 1 hour. At 6 hours edema, as measured by increase in wet to dry weight (w/d) ratio, was present in the heart, liver, and kidney, with 10(5) U IL-2 and in the lung, heart, liver and kidney, with 10(6) U IL-2, relative to values with vehicle-infused controls (all p less than 0.05). With a 1-hour infusion of 10(6) U IL-2, there was an increase in plasma thromboxane (Tx)B2 level to 1290 +/- 245 pg/mL, higher than 481 +/- 93 pg/mL in control rats (p less than 0.05); lung polymorphonuclear leukocyte (PMN) sequestration of 53 +/- 7 PMN/10 higher-power fields (HPF) relative to 23 +/- 2 PMN/10 HPF in controls (p less than 0.05); and increased bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid protein concentration of 1970 +/- 210 micrograms/mL relative to 460 micrograms/mL in controls (p less than 0.05). When 10(6) U IL-2 was given as a 1-minute intravenous bolus (n = 9), edema was not demonstrated, plasma TxB2 levels were similar to controls, there was no leukosequestration, and BAL protein levels were normal. These data indicate that a constant infusion but not the rapid bolus administration of IL-2 produces in rats multiple-system organ edema, increased plasma TxB2, sequestration of PMNs, and microvascular permeability. These findings may explain the early toxicity seen in patients given high-dose IL-2 in cancer treatment. 
4	Excess purine degradation caused by an imbalance in the supply of adenosine triphosphate in patients with congestive heart failure. To evaluate purine degradation in patients with congestive heart failure concentrations of serum hypoxanthine, lactate, and noradrenaline were measured before and after submaximal treadmill exercise in 12 patients with chronic congestive heart failure and nine healthy volunteers. In four patients the concentration of hypoxanthine was significantly higher than in the controls or in the remaining eight patients with congestive heart failure. Venous lactate and noradrenaline in the four patients with high concentrations of hypoxanthine were also significantly higher than those in the eight patients with normal concentrations of hypoxanthine. Patients who responded normally were also more likely to have been treated with vasodilators and angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors. Exercise induced arrhythmias were more common in the patients with high concentrations of hypoxanthine. These results suggest that the excess purine degradation in patients with congestive heart failure might be the result of a "relative" disturbance in the supply of adenosine triphosphate caused by the shift of cellular metabolism from aerobic glycolysis to anaerobic glycolysis during submaximal exercise and that hypoxanthine (a substrate for xanthine oxidase and a source of free radicals) was increased after submaximal exercise in some patients with congestive heart failure. 
1	Delayed subcapsular hematoma after percutaneous liver biopsy as a manifestation of warfarin toxicity. Guidelines for the management of patients receiving chronic anticoagulation therapy who require liver biopsy are not clearly defined. In patients with normal coagulation, liver biopsy is a relatively safe procedure with a morbidity of less than 0.1% and a mortality of less than 0.01%. We report a patient with a prosthetic aortic valve who developed a large subcapsular hematoma 12 days after a percutaneous liver biopsy as a consequence of warfarin toxicity. Based on the experience with this patient, reinstitution of anticoagulant therapy should be avoided for at least 72 h after a percutaneous liver biopsy. Intravenous heparin should be resumed first, and warfarin added if no bleeding has occurred after an additional 48-72 h. The prothrombin time should be maintained at 1.5 times the baseline. 
3	Long-term follow-up of patients operated on for recurrent carotid stenosis. We reviewed our experience with 29 operations for recurrent carotid stenosis in 27 patients who underwent both their primary carotid endarterectomy and their reoperations at our institution. These 27 patients represent 4% of the 667 patients who underwent primary carotid endarterectomies at our institution and who are included in our carotid follow-up registry. Reoperation was prompted by recurrent symptoms in 19/29 (65.5%) cases. Comparison of long-term stroke prevention in those patients who did (84% at 5 years, 78.6% at 10 years) and did not (90.3% at 5 years, 83.6% at 10 years) develop recurrent stenosis requiring reoperation revealed no statistically significant difference (p = 0.48) when measured from the time of primary operation. The perioperative stroke and death rates for reoperation (3.4% and 0%) were acceptable. We conclude that with our acceptably low perioperative stroke morbidity (3.4%), surgery for recurrent carotid stenosis in symptomatic patients or in asymptomatic patients with high-grade (greater than or equal to 75%) stenosis maintains the durable stroke prevention offered by primary carotid endarterectomy. 
1	Serum erythropoietin levels in the anaemia of chronic disorders. Serum erythropoietin (S-EPO) levels were measured in 50 patients with anaemia of chronic disorders (ACD), classified into three groups according to their aetiology: inflammatory (n = 20), infectious (n = 15) and neoplastic (n = 15). The inflammatory group showed a higher mean S-EPO level (mean value +/- SEM, 69 +/- 11 mU ml-1) than the neoplastic (43 +/- 5 mU ml-1; P less than 0.05) and infectious groups (27 +/- 4 mU ml-1; P less than 0.01). The S-EPO level in the inflammatory group also differed from that of 32 healthy controls (36 +/- 3 mU ml-1; P less than 0.05). Fourteen patients with added iron deficiency (12 subjects from the inflammatory group) showed the highest S-EPO concentration (72 +/- 17 mU ml-1). Conversely, S-EPO levels were lower in febrile subjects (12 patients with infection and five with malignancy) than in non-febrile patients (28 +/- 4 mU ml-1 vs. 55 +/- 7 mU ml-1; P less than 0.01). In the infectious group, the logarithm of S-EPO correlated directly with the haemoglobin and haematocrit values. We conclude that differences in S-EPO concentration in ACD may be further related to the patient's iron stores and temperature. A decrease in EPO production may contribute to the pathogenesis of ACD secondary to infection. 
5	Percutaneous nucleotomy. An anatomic study of the risks of root injury. Fifteen cadaveric dissections have been performed to determine the anatomic relationships of nucleotomy guide wires. All the 44 guide wires inserted were found to be in contact with at least one nerve root (eight transfixed a root). Guide wires passing anterior to the nerve roots always passed anterior to the center of the disc. Lateral displacement of the skin entry point made safe entry to the center of the disc impossible. Nerve root transfixion is likely to be a significant complication in percutaneous nucleotomy. Entry to the center of the disc avoiding the nerve roots is simplest if the skin entry is as near to the midline as possible. 
2	Blood contacts during surgical procedures Operating room personnel are at risk for infection with blood-borne pathogens through blood contact. To describe the nature and frequency of blood contact and its risk factors, trained observers monitored a sample of operations performed by six surgical services at Grady Memorial Hospital, Atlanta, Ga, for 6 months. In 62 (30.1%) of 206 operations, at least one blood contact was observed. Of 1828 operating room person-procedures observed, 96 (5.3%) had 147 blood contacts (133 skin contacts [90%], 10 percutaneous injuries [7%], and four eye splashes [3%]). The mean number of blood contacts per 100 person-procedures was highest for surgeons (18.6). The frequency of percutaneous injury was similar among surgeons and scrub staff (mean, 1.2 per 100 worker-procedures for each group). Risk factors for surgeons' blood contacts were (1) performing a trauma, burn, or orthopedic emergency procedure (odds ratio [OR], 4.1; 95% confidence interval [CI], 2.0 to 8.7); (2) patient blood loss exceeding 250mL (OR, 2.1; 95% CI, 1.2 to 3.7); and (3) being in the operating room longer than 1 hour (OR, 3.3; 95% CI, 1.6 to 7.1). Of 110 blood contacts among surgeons, 81 (74%) were potentially preventable by additional barrier precautions, such as face shields and fluid-resistant gowns. Twenty-one (84%) of 25 blood contacts among surgeons in procedures in which all three risk factors were present were potentially preventable by additional barriers. Of 29 blood contacts among anesthesia and circulating personnel, 20 (69%) would have been prevented by glove use. For surgical procedures in which operating room personnel are at increased risk of blood contact, reevaluation of surgical technique, use of appropriate barrier precautions, and development of puncture-resistant glove materials are indicated. 
2	Prognostic significance of the white nipple sign in variceal bleeding. The prognostic significance of the white nipple sign in variceal bleeding was evaluated prospectively in 203 separate admissions for bleeding esophageal varices in 145 cirrhotic patients. During all admissions a standardized protocol of management defined the failure of transfusion and vasoactive drugs (conservative measures) to stop bleeding and the occurrence of early rebleeding, at which time either emergency sclerotherapy or a staple transection of the esophagus was used. The finding of a white nipple in 18 admissions (9%) did not have predictive value as regards the failure of conservative measures to stop bleeding within 24 hours or rebleeding within 5 days, and there was no association with increased mortality. In one case, a white nipple was seen to occur after spontaneous cessation of a variceal venous spurt, suggesting it is a platelet-fibrin plug. The white nipple sign is diagnostic of a varix that has bled but has no adverse prognostic significance. 
4	Optimizing heparin utilization in angiographic flush solutions. Various concentrations of heparin in angiographic flush solutions are employed during angiography. In an effort to determine whether differences in outcome are seen when either high or low concentrations of heparin in angiographic flush solutions are utilized, two groups of patients were evaluated. There was no difference in outcome and a small systemic effect from heparin was seen in both groups. Use of a low concentration of heparin is suggested for routine angiography. 
2	Hepatic portal venous gas identified by computed tomography in a patient with blunt abdominal trauma: a case report. An abdominal computed tomographic (CT) scan in a middle-aged man injured in a high-speed motor vehicle accident demonstrated the presence of portal venous gas. Findings on initial peritoneal lavage were entirely negative. Exploratory celiotomy performed because of increasing abdominal pain and leukocytosis revealed gangrene of the cecum. This report illustrates the importance of the finding of portal venous gas on CT scan in patients with blunt abdominal trauma. 
1	Transhepatic portal vein catheterization for localization of insulinomas: a ten-year experience. One of the most important factors in the management of insulinomas is the ability to localize the tumor accurately either before or during surgery. We prospectively carried out transhepatic portal venous sampling (THPVS) for tumor localization in 35 of 40 patients with organic hyperinsulinism during a 10-year period. In 32 patients who underwent THPVS and in whom a single tumor was subsequently identified surgically, the maximal insulin gradient was located in the vicinity of the tumor in 100% of cases. Specific regionalization of the tumor on the basis of the site of the maximal insulin gradient to one of three regions (the tail, the body/neck region, and the head/uncinate region) gave a sensitivity of 81% and a specificity of 91%. In contrast, the use of specific cutoff levels for the insulin gradient as a guide to the presence of a tumor in one of these three regions did not increase the accuracy, leading instead to a significant loss of sensitivity with no comparable increase in specificity. There were no major complications from the procedure in any patient. The initial use of computed tomographic/ultrasound scanning and selective angiography localized only 46% of tumors, whereas subsequent THPVS led to the accurate preoperative localization of 100% of all tumors submitted to surgery. Although the surgeon would have identified 81% of the tumors correctly at operation, in 19% (n = 6) he would have failed. Four tumors were in the uncinate and two were in the head. It seems that in patients with proved or established organic hyperinsulinism, THPVS may continue to be of value, if only to regionalize the tumor, especially those in the pancreatic head and uncinate process so as to preclude noncurative operations on the body and tail of the pancreas. 
4	The clinical utility of carotid duplex scanning. We retrospectively compared the results of duplex scanning (DS) with contrast angiography (CAN) in the evaluation of 119 patients whose 238 carotid arteries were evaluated by both methods within a four-week period. The results of all patients were then categorized by two different definitions of severity of stenosis. Category A classified 1-29% stenosis as mild, 30-69% stenosis as moderate, and 70-99% diameter reduction as severe stenosis. Category B defined mild stenosis as 1-19% lumen diameter reduction, moderate as 20-49% stenosis, and severe as 50-99% stenosis. The findings by each classification were compared in 60 patients with hemispheric symptoms and in 59 patients with nonspecific symptoms. CAN was our "gold standard", and exhibited greater sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, and predictive values than DS. Carotid arteries with 70% stenosis were identified by DS with greater specificity, accuracy, and predictive values than were arteries with 50% stenoses. Only the sensitivity was comparable in categorizations A and B (80% and 83%). All parameters of measurement were superior in patients with hemispheric symptoms. DS alone cannot substitute for CAN in selecting patients for carotid endarterectomy because its error rate exceeded acceptable rates of complications for carotid artery surgery. The false positive rate of DS was 4%. DS failed to diagnose 7 of 19 carotid artery occlusions, 9 of 11 ulcerated plaques, 7 of 119 instances of aortic arch disease, and 13 cases of severe intracranial artery stenosis. 
3	The shoulder in multiple epiphyseal dysplasia. One hundred shoulders were assessed in 50 patients with multiple epiphyseal dysplasia, of which one-third were found to have bilateral symptoms. Two distinct clinical and radiological groups emerged. Those with minor epiphyseal abnormalities developed painful osteoarthritis in middle age, but retained shoulder movement until the secondary changes were advanced. Those with 'hatchet head' shoulders likewise became painful in the fifth and sixth decades but had minimal glenohumeral movement from an early stage. 
4	Aortico-left ventricular tunnel: long-term outcome after surgical repair. Over a 14 year period, four children (three male, one female) underwent surgical correction of an aortico-left ventricular tunnel. All presented in infancy (age range 5 days to 9 months). The presenting feature was a systolic and diastolic murmur in all, one of whom developed heart failure within 2 weeks of presentation. In the first two patients, the echocardiographic findings were inconclusive and the diagnosis was confirmed at cardiac catheterization (at 10 and 23 months of age, respectively); the other two were diagnosed echocardiographically by two-dimensional and Doppler color flow imaging. All four patients underwent surgery by patch closure of the aortic end of the tunnel (three patients) or direct suture closure (one patient) and there were no deaths. The mean age at operation was 11 months. During a mean follow-up period of 71 months (range 2 to 157), three patients have clinical and echocardiographic evidence of trivial aortic valve regurgitation, which was noted in the immediate postoperative period in one and at early (less than 6 months) follow-up study in the other two. All are symptom-free, are taking no medications and are growing and developing normally. Aortico-left ventricular tunnel can be accurately diagnosed by echocardiography. In patients presenting in infancy, echocardiography also provides the necessary morphologic information to enable surgical correction without angiography. Early operation is associated with an excellent outcome, whereas repair at a later age is associated with a high incidence of residual aortic regurgitation requiring further surgery. 
2	Abdominal sparganosis in Ecuador: a case report. Sparganosis, infection with plerocercoids of the pseudophyllidean tapeworm Spirometra, rarely has been described in Ecuador. We report the details of a human case of sparganosis identified serendipitously in the course of an abdominal hernia repair. The parasite was found moving freely upon the external oblique fascia adjacent to the site of a direct abdominal hernia. The organism was recovered intact, photographed while alive and preserved for subsequent detailed morphological studies. The presumed route of entry into this patient was percutaneous, after application of a poultice of snake flesh to the site of a painful abdominal hernia. The literature on sparganosis in South America is reviewed. This is the second case of human sparganosis reported from Ecuador. 
1	Undifferentiated carcinoma of the ovary. Thirty-five cases of ovarian carcinomas, which had as the predominant histologic component solid areas of epithelial cells without differentiation into mullerian carcinomas, were reviewed. The patients' ages ranged from 39 to 72 years (mean age, 54 years). Two patients had clinical stage I disease, one had stage II, 26 had stage III, and six had stage IV. Microscopically, the malignant cells formed large groups or sheets with desmoplastic stroma around them. Foci of papillary serous carcinoma, unclassified adenocarcinoma, or transitional cell carcinoma were seen in 26 tumors, foci of necrosis were seen in 30 tumors, and vascular invasion was seen in seven tumors. Six of 13 carcinomas tested expressed CA125 reactivity, and 12 of 13 carcinomas reacted to B72.3 monoclonal antibody. The primary tumors were treated by aggressive surgical reduction in 32 patients and by multiple biopsy procedures in three patients. After the first operation, 30 patients had residual disease, smaller than 2 cm in five patients and larger than 2 cm in 23 patients. After surgery, 33 patients received chemotherapy; three of these 33 also received radiotherapy. One patient was treated with postsurgical radiotherapy only, and one patient refused further treatment. Thirty-four patients (97%) died of disease between 8 and 108 months (mean, 27 months) after initial surgery, 29 patients died in less than 32 months. Four patients (11%) survived more than 5 years: two patients with stage I disease who died at 82 and 102 months, one patient with stage II who died at 72 months, and one patient with stage III who has no evidence of disease after 116 months. Five-year survival of patients with undifferentiated ovarian carcinoma is worse than the reported survival of patients with serous carcinoma or ovarian carcinoma with a pattern resembling transitional cell carcinoma. The distinction between these three carcinomas that have solid areas carries prognostic significance. 
1	Dilatation in the duplex kidney: 3 unusual cases. Dilatation in the upper limb of a duplex ureter is usually secondary to obstruction and may be associated with a ureterocele. By contrast, vesicoureteric reflux is the usual cause of a dilated lower moiety ureter. We report 3 cases in which unusual or complex causes of dilatation of 1 limb of a duplex ureter were demonstrated. 
5	The electrocardiographic manifestations of cyclic antidepressant therapy and overdose: a review. Cyclic antidepressants may cause changes in the electrocardiogram at therapeutic or toxic serum levels. The most serious complications of cyclic antidepressant toxicity are dysrhythmias, hypotension, and seizures. It is predominantly the cardiotoxic effects that cause mortality. Once cardiotoxicity is evident, the treatment of choice is serum alkalinization, preferably by sodium bicarbonate therapy. In order to predict which overdose patients are at high risk for complications, electrocardiographic criteria have been identified as reliable screens. For "first generation" tricyclic antidepressants, QRS prolongation (particularly greater than 100 msec) and a terminal 40-ms frontal plane axis greater than 120 degrees are the most sensitive. This article reviews antidepressant pharmacology, electrocardiographic manifestations of antidepressant cardiotoxicity, and approaches to treatment of antidepressant-induced conduction disturbances and dysrhythmias. 
3	The automatic implantable cardioverter-defibrillator: effect of patch polarity on defibrillation threshold. An automatic implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (AICD) was implanted in 40 patients with sudden cardiac arrest (n = 29), sustained monomorphic ventricular tachycardia (n = 10) or recurrent syncope (n = 1) who were unsuitable for direct ablative surgery or had had unsuccessful medical therapy. The effect of patch electrode polarity on the defibrillation threshold was prospectively evaluated. Two large epicardial patches were used. Initial polarity was selected at random. Ventricular fibrillation was induced by direct current and a preestablished defibrillation protocol employed to assess the minimal energy that would reproducibly defibrillate the heart. Nineteen patients had a lower defibrillation threshold with the inferior left ventricular patch as an anode and nine patients had a lower defibrillation threshold with this patch as a cathode. In general, the defibrillation threshold was lower when this patch was used as an anode than when it was used as a cathode (18 +/- 10 versus 22.6 +/- 12.2 J; p less than 0.01). No preoperative variable predicted optimal polarity. Therefore, the effect of patch polarity on defibrillation threshold should be assessed in each patient at the time of AICD implantation so that the safety margin for satisfactory device function can be maximized. 
5	Underdiagnosis and undertreatment of chronic sinusitis in children. A review of outpatients diagnosed with sinusitis during the previous year by the allergy services of Childrens Hospital of Los Angeles and Kaiser Permanente, Orange County, revealed 34 patients who had protracted discomforting and debilitating symptoms. The mean duration of symptoms was approximately six months (range 1-14 months). None had been previously diagnosed as having sinusitis or received appropriate treatment. Although all were referred for evaluation of allergic rhinitis and/or asthma, approximately 1/3 were found to have neither of these conditions. Among patients who had asthma, their asthmatic symptoms were aggravated by the sinusitis. All patients eventually responded favorably to appropriate antibiotic therapy. Earlier diagnosis and appropriate therapy would have foreshortened the course of this very discomforting condition. In recent years, we have observed a marked increase in the number of patients referred with the chief complaint of "worsening allergy" and who were subsequently found to have sinusitis. Most of the patients experienced significant incapacitation for protracted periods before a correct diagnosis was made and treatment instituted. In all but a few cases, prompt and sustained improvement followed appropriate therapy. The purpose of this report is to present a retrospective review of 34 illustrative cases. 
2	Correlation between laboratory findings and clinical outcome after restorative proctocolectomy: serial studies in 20 patients with end-to-end pouch-anal anastomosis. Clinical function and anorectal physiological function were assessed and correlated in 20 patients with ulcerative colitis before restorative proctocolectomy and 3, 7, and 12 months after operation. The entire anal sphincter was preserved by means of a stapled pouch-anal anastomosis. Before operation, the median resting anal pressure was 79 cmH2O (interquartile range 70-89 cmH2O), the rectoanal inhibitory reflex was present in all patients and anorectal 'sampling' was noted in 16 of 20 patients. Three months after operation, resting anal pressure was 68 cmH2O (range 50-87 cmH2O) (P less than 0.001), the reflex was present in only three patients (P less than 0.001) and sampling was observed in one patient. After 7 months, resting anal pressure was 76 cmH2O (range 64-89 cmH2O), the reflex was present in 11 patients and sampling was observed in nine patients. At 12 months, resting anal pressure was 84 cmH2O (range 66-94 cmH2O), the reflex was present in 19 patients and sampling was observed in 17 patients. The compliance and capacity of the reservoir increased significantly. Ability to discriminate flatus from faeces was associated with return of the rectoanal reflex and sampling. 
5	Continuous arteriovenous rewarming: experimental results and thermodynamic model simulation of treatment for hypothermia. We evaluated a technique for treating hypothermia that uses extracorporeal circulation but does not require heparin or pump assistance. Hypothermia to 29.5 degrees C was induced in eight anesthetized dogs, and thermistors placed in the pulmonary artery, liver, bladder, esophagus, rectum, muscle, and skin. Four experimental animals were rewarmed by creating a fistula which connected arterial and venous femoral lines to an interposed counter-current heat exchanger. External rewarming was used in four controls. Bleeding time (BT), coagulation profile (PT, PTT, TT), and cardiac output (CO) were measured during rewarming. Core temperature (T) rose significantly faster with CAVR (0.00001). Average time to rewarming was 45 min, vs. 4 hrs in controls. Haptoglobin, platelet, fibrinogen, and fibrin split product levels were unaffected. Continuous arteriovenous rewarming (CAVR) improved T, CO, BT, and coagulation profile faster than any method yet reported not requiring heparin or cardiac bypass. The application of CAVR in post-traumatic hypothermia warrants further investigation. 
5	Preventive therapy of first gastrointestinal bleeding in patients with cirrhosis: results of a controlled trial comparing propranolol, endoscopic sclerotherapy and placebo. Propranolol and endoscopic sclerosis of esophageal varices are the two approaches currently used in prophylaxis of the first gastrointestinal hemorrhage in the cirrhotic patient. One hundred twenty-six cirrhotic patients with esophageal varices and no histories of bleeding were included in the trial regardless of the gravity of the cirrhosis or the size of the esophageal varices. Patients with hepatocarcinomas or other cancers, clearly impossible follow-up, previous treatment for portal hypertension or contraindication to beta-blockers were excluded. After randomization, 43 patients received propranolol twice daily at a dose reducing the heart rate by 25%; 42 patients were treated with intravariceal and extravariceal injections of Polidocanol; 41 control patients received vitamin K orally as placebo. The patients were seen at 3-mo intervals for 2 yr. On entry to the trial the three groups were comparable in terms of clinical and biological parameters, including size of esophageal varices (grade I = 51, grade II = 54, grade III = 17), Child-Pugh classification (A = 29, B = 61, C = 32) and the origin of cirrhosis (alcoholic in 79% of cases). Twenty-four patients bled (two bled in the propranolol group, nine bled in the endoscopic sclerosis of esophageal varices group and 13 bled in the placebo group). Actuarial estimates (Kaplan-Meier) of the time of onset of first bleeding showed that the differences were significant between propranolol and placebo (p less than 0.004) and between propranolol and sclerotherapy (p less than 0.03) but not between sclerotherapy and placebo. 
5	Airflow obstruction after substance P aerosol: contribution of airway and pulmonary edema. We have studied the effects of aerosolized substance P (SP) in guinea pigs with reference to lung resistance and dynamic compliance changes and their recovery after hyperinflation. In addition, we have examined the concomitant formation of airway microvascular leakage and lung edema. Increasing breaths of SP (1.5 mg/ml, 1.1 mM), methacholine (0.15 mg/ml, 0.76 mM), or 0.9% saline were administered to tracheostomized and mechanically ventilated guinea pigs. Lung resistance (RL) increased dose dependently with a maximum effect of 963 +/- 85% of baseline values (mean +/- SE) after SP (60 breaths) and 1,388 +/- 357% after methacholine (60 breaths). After repeated hyperinflations, methacholine-treated animals returned to baseline, but after SP, mean RL was still raised (292 +/- 37%; P less than 0.005). Airway microvascular leakage, measured by extravasation of Evans Blue dye, occurred in the brain bronchi and intrapulmonary airways after SP but not after methacholine. There was a significant correlation between RL after hyperinflation and Evans Blue dye extravasation in intrapulmonary airways (distal: r = 0.89, P less than 0.005; proximal: r = 0.85, P less than 0.01). Examination of frozen sections for peribronchial and perivascular cuffs of edema and for alveolar flooding showed significant degrees of pulmonary edema for animals treated with SP compared with those treated with methacholine or saline. We conclude that the inability of hyperinflation to fully reverse changes in RL after SP may be due to the formation of both airway and pulmonary edema, which may also contribute to the deterioration in RL. 
1	The Patterns of Care Outcome Study for cancer of the uterine cervix. Results of the Second National Practice Survey. This report summarizes the outcome results of the Patterns of Care Study (PCS) of cancer of the uterine cervix from 565 patients treated in 1978. The 5-year survival with no evidence of disease was: Stage I, 74%; Stage II, 56%; and Stage III, 33%. The 5-year local in-field failure rate was: Stage I, 12%, Stage II, 27%; and Stage III, 51%. Extent of parametrial involvement, unilateral versus bilateral, may be important in determining survival and local failure. The four-year actuarial survival was 58% for unilateral involvement versus 47% for bilateral (P = 0.06), and the local failure rate was 32% for unilateral versus 45% for bilateral (P less than 0.05). When analyzed by stage, patients with Stage IIb disease with unilateral parametrial involvement showed a trend toward improved survival and decreased local failure compared with those with bilateral Stage IIb cancers (P = 0.1). The use of intracavitary irradiation significantly improved survival and reduced local failures. Furthermore, the number of intracavitary applications was important. When two or more intracavitary applications were used compared with one application, local in-field failure was significantly reduced, 29% versus 17% at 4 years (P less than 0.001), and four-year survival was improved, 60% versus 73% (P = 0.01). The four-year actuarial rate of major complications depended on the stage: Stage I, 8%; Stage II, 15%; and Stage III, 13%. There was a statistically significant increase in major complications in patients undergoing laparotomy for staging versus no laparotomy 23% versus 11% at 4 years (P less than or equal to 0.01) and a trend toward increased major complications in patients who were thin or had prior abdominal surgery. This study confirmed the stage-dependent outcome of treatment of cancer of the uterine cervix with radiation and indicated that further division of Stage IIb to indicate prognostic significance of unilateral or bilateral parametrial involvement may be warranted. This study also confirmed the importance of intracavitary radiation in optimizing control established by the 1973 PCS. It further suggests that where possible, two intracavitary insertions may yield better results than one insertion. 
5	Educational policies. It is vital that teachers, parents, and health professionals recognize the major educational problems that affect students with epilepsy. Children with epilepsy should be placed in the least restrictive schooling environment so that social, emotional, and educational requirements can be met in a setting best suited to the individual's present needs and future development. Personal assessment and monitoring of progress form an equally important part of a child's educational program in integrated schools, but there is a need to develop suitable instruments to assist teachers in their assessments and decision making. In Australia, the National Epilepsy Association has developed an "Alert Kit" based on the Epilepsy Foundation of Americas "School Alert Kit" to provide basic medical information on epilepsy to teachers and pupils. 
3	Rehabilitation in brain disorders. 4. Specific disorders. This self-directed learning module highlights important aspects of medical rehabilitation of patients with brain disorders. The specific disorders reviewed in this module are traumatic brain injury, stroke, multiple sclerosis, Parkinson's disease, and other degenerative disorders. This module is a section of the chapter on rehabilitation of brain disorders for the Self-Directed Medical Knowledge Program Study Guide for practitioners and trainees in physical medicine and rehabilitation. The chapter is composed of four articles, and each builds on principles established in the others. Emphasis is given in this section on key elements of current medical practice, including epidemiology, pathophysiology, prognosis, and outcome. Neurologic assessment and management is highlighted for coma, amnesia, cranial nerve and late intracranial complications, postacute management, and postconcussive syndromes. The learner is directed to articles 1, 2, and 3 in this chapter for supporting information. 
2	Update on the epidemiology of anorexia nervosa in a defined region of Switzerland. In this follow-up investigation, the authors studied all Swiss women in the canton of Zurich who developed anorexia nervosa between ages 12 and 25 years and who were hospitalized for the first time with this diagnosis between 1983 and 1985. Data were compared with those from an earlier study, which focused on the periods 1956-1958, 1963-1965, and 1973-1975. The incidence of anorexia nervosa did not increase significantly during 1983-1985 compared to 1973-1975, in contrast to the constant increase found between 1956 and 1975. However, the more frequent use of vomiting and abuse of laxatives in 1983-1985 may indicate an increase in cases with mixed features of anorexia nervosa and bulimia. 
5	Spontaneous splenic rupture following infectious mononucleosis. Four cases of spontaneous splenic rupture after infectious mononucleosis (IM) have been treated at this institution since 1978. The condition is rare, occurring in 0.1-0.5 per cent of patients with proven infectious mononucleosis. Splenectomy is considered the treatment of choice for these patients. However, because recent trends in the management of traumatic splenic rupture are moving towards nonoperative treatment with selected patients, a similar approach has been considered for the patient with spontaneous splenic rupture following IM. The major reason for avoiding splenectomy is the increased incidence of sepsis in splenectomized patients. Yet, splenic rupture is accompanied by hemorrhage and the risks associated with blood transfusion for ongoing hemorrhage are of similar magnitude as those of sepsis following splenectomy. In addition, the grossly abnormal spleens seen at operation tend to include large, contained hematomas that may also be prone to rupture. Therefore, operative management still appears to be the preferred treatment for spontaneous splenic rupture following IM. Splenectomy is curative, safe, and obviates the need for transfusion, extended hospitalization, and activity restriction. 
2	Barium meals in the elderly--a quality reassurance. The consecutive double contrast barium meal examinations of 100 elderly patients (aged over 65 years) and a group of 33 younger adult patients were analysed by two observers for technical quality and pathological abnormalities. Technical quality declined with patient age, especially in those over 75 years, but was sufficient to enable diagnosis of abnormalities in 60% of the elderly group. It is concluded that, in the majority of elderly patients, the technical quality of double contrast barium meal examinations is sufficiently high to offer considerable diagnostic utility. 
2	Gallstone disease in north India: clinical and ultrasound profile in a referral hospital. We studied the prevalence of gallstones in patients with upper abdominal pain, heaviness, or discomfort by ultrasound examination of the gallbladder. The actual ultrasound examination was performed by a clinical gastroenterologist blinded to the symptoms. Of 1,680 consecutive dyspeptic patients, 500 (29.8%) had gallstones. The gallbladder was contracted in 450 (91.2%), normal-size in 36 (7.2%), and distended in 8 (1.6%). Biliary colic was more frequently the presenting complaint in patients with a contracted gallbladder than in those with normal size gallbladder (p less than 0.001). Dyspepsia was more frequent in the presence of a normal size gallbladder than a contracted one (p less than 0.001). We conclude that ultrasonography of the gallbladder by the clinician has a high diagnostic yield, and the symptom complex has an excellent correlation with the sonographic appearance. 
4	Increased incidence of respiratory distress syndrome in babies of hypertensive mothers. There is controversy over the effect of hypertension in pregnancy on the incidence of neonatal respiratory distress syndrome. We investigated the association between maternal hypertension and the incidence of respiratory distress syndrome in 268 very low birthweight babies of less than 34 weeks' gestation. A lower incidence of respiratory distress syndrome was associated with growth retardation and membrane rupture greater than 24 hours. Maternal hypertension was associated with an increased incidence of respiratory distress syndrome. We used the multiple logistic regression model to control for confounding variables, as the maternal and neonatal factors associated with respiratory distress syndrome were not evenly distributed between the two groups. After adjustment for birth weight, gestational age, growth retardation, and membrane rupture greater than 24 hours, the risk of developing respiratory distress syndrome was significantly greater in babies of hypertensive mothers. Significance was lost when labour before delivery and mode of delivery were taken into account. The increased incidence of respiratory distress syndrome in babies of hypertensive mothers may be due to the absence of labour before delivery because of the greater likelihood of caesarean section. 
3	More than one mutant allele causes infantile Tay-Sachs disease in French-Canadians. Two Tay-Sachs disease (TSD) patients of French-Canadian origin were shown by Myerowitz and Hogikyan to be homozygous for a 7.6-kb deletion mutation at the 5' end of the hexosaminidase A alpha-subunit gene. In order to determine whether all French-Canadian TSD patients were homozygotes for the deletion allele and to assess the geographic origins of TSD in this population, we ascertained 12 TSD families of French-Canadian origin and screened for occurrence of mutations associated with infantile TSD. DNA samples were obtained from 12 French-Canadian TSD families. Samples were analyzed using polymerase-chain-reaction (PCR) amplification followed by hybridization to allele-specific oligonucleotides (ASO) or by restriction analysis of PCR products. In some cases Southern analysis of genomic DNA was performed. Eighteen of the 22 independently segregating mutant chromosomes in this sample carried the 7.6-kb deletion mutation at the 5' end of the gene. One chromosome carried the 4-nucleotide insertion in exon 11 (a "Jewish" mutation). In this population no individuals were detected who had the substitution at the splice junction of exon 12 previously identified in Ashkenazi Jews. One chromosome carried an undescribed B1 mutation; this allele came from a parent of non-French-Canadian origin. Patients in three families carried TSD alleles different from any of the above mutations. The 5' deletion mutation clusters in persons originating in southeastern Quebec (Gaspe) and adjacent counties of northern New Brunswick. 
3	Prolonged confusion following convulsions due to generalized nonconvulsive status epilepticus. Among patients with a prolonged confusional state after convulsive seizure, we diagnosed 8 cases as generalized nonconvulsive status epilepticus. Six had a history of seizures, and 2 had new onset. The convulsive seizures were generalized in 6 and focal in two. The postictal confusion lasted up to 36 hours in the most prolonged case, and a delayed response to anticonvulsant medications occurred in all cases. The clinical symptoms ranged from mild confusion to coma. Psychiatric manifestations or automatisms were rare. The presumed etiology was due to diverse causes, but a withdrawal state was the most common. EEG demonstrated continuous or nearly continuous generalized ictal discharges of variable morphology. These cases call attention to the fact that some prolonged confusional states following convulsive seizures are in fact due to persistent seizure activity that can be diagnosed by EEG. 
1	Interleukin-2: prospects for lymphocyte-mediated destruction of pediatric malignancies. Immunologic therapy of cancer was speculated on at the turn of the century. In animals, in vitro, and most recently in patients, irrefutable evidence has been obtained that lymphocyte responses can have a reproducible and beneficial antitumor effect. These results indicate that "biologic response modification" may truly become a fourth modality for cancer treatment, to be integrated into the standard approaches of radiation, chemotherapy, and surgery. To what extent these immune approaches may enable eradication of microscopic amounts of residual diseases in children who would otherwise have a recurrence of their malignancies remains the critical issue for testing over the next decade. Enthusiasm regarding this approach is abundant, but critical evaluation of all clinical trials is essential to best focus these mechanisms into effective therapy. 
5	Neuropathy caused by spontaneous intraneural hemorrhage: case report. A case of ulnar neuropathy at the elbow produced by spontaneous intraneural hemorrhage in a patient with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome and thrombocytopenia is reported. Intraneural hemorrhage in patients with bleeding disorders occurs infrequently. It consists of acute intrafascicular bleeding, presumably producing very high elevations of endoneurial fluid pressure. The clinical features and treatment of this condition are considered, the pertinent literature is reviewed, and the involved pathophysiological mechanisms are discussed. 
1	Association of bcl-1 rearrangements with lymphocytic lymphoma of intermediate differentiation. Previous studies using classical cytogenetics have demonstrated the presence of the t(11;14) (q13;q32) chromosomal translocation in some cases of lymphocytic lymphoma of intermediate differentiation (IDL), a distinct type of low grade B-cell lymphoma. This finding suggested that the bcl-1 region (located at band q13 of chromosome 11) might be involved in this neoplasm. Using a genomic probe from the major breakpoint area of the bcl-1 locus, we identified rearrangements of the bcl-1 region in 10 of 19 cases, 2 of which comigrated with a rearranged allele of the immunoglobulin heavy chain gene joining region. In contrast, bcl-1 rearrangements were not found in other types of low grade B-cell lymphoma, specifically in 36 cases of chronic lymphocytic leukemia/small lymphocytic lymphoma (CLL/SLL) and 27 cases of follicular lymphoma (FL). To further assess the molecular pathology of IDL, we analyzed these cases for rearrangements of the bcl-2 proto-oncogene, which is associated primarily with follicular lymphomas. None of the 19 cases of IDL had rearrangements. Furthermore, none of the 36 cases of CLL/SLL showed bcl-2 rearrangements, whereas, as expected, 21 of 27 cases of FL had rearrangements of the bcl-2 locus. Our findings demonstrate an association between a rearranged bcl-1 region with approximately 50% of IDLs and suggest that abnormalities of this locus may be important in the pathogenesis of IDL. 
3	Congenital mirror movements. Abnormal organization of motor pathways in two patients. We studied 2 patients with congenital mirror movements by means of various neurophysiological and metabolic techniques, including mapping of motor evoked potentials to transcranial electrical and magnetic stimulation, premovement and somatosensory evoked potentials, kinematics of voluntary movements, muscle reflexes, and positron emission tomography (PET). Abnormalities in maps of motor and premovement potentials and in PET scans were consistent with a bilateral representation of hand muscles in the motor cortex, the existence of physiologically active connections capable of conducting fast efferent volleys from the motor cortex to ipsilateral muscles, the presence of mirror EMG activity in either hand with intended voluntary movement of the other hand, the absence of mirrored EMG responses from wrist flexors and extensors to mechanical perturbation of the contralateral wrist, and normal scalp distribution of somatosensory evoked potentials to right and left median nerve stimulation. Our findings are consistent with aberrant organization of motor representation areas and corticospinal pathways with ipsilateral as well as contralateral control of voluntary movement. 
1	Photopheresis for the treatment of cutaneous T cell lymphoma. We investigated the use of extracorporeal chemotherapy (photopheresis) in eight patients with cutaneous T cell lymphoma. Initially described by Edelson et al. for the treatment of erythrodermic cutaneous T cell lymphoma, we have expanded the treatment to include patients with extensive patch/plaque disease as well as tumor-stage disease. Four of five patients with erythrodermic stage disease had either a complete or a partial clinical remission with photopheresis alone. One patient with extensive patch/plaque disease continued to have a partial clinical remission of 7 months' duration with photopheresis alone. Of the two patients with tumor-stage disease, one remained without evidence of clinical disease at 10 months with photopheresis alone, whereas the second patient had a partial clinical remission of 5 months with a combination of local radiation therapy followed by monthly photopheresis. The skin biopsy specimen obtained from the patient with tumor-stage disease in complete clinical remission did not show cutaneous T cell lymphoma. We conclude that photopheresis is an effective modality alone or in combination with adjunctive therapy for erythroderma, extensive patch/plaque disease, and some tumor-stage disease. 
4	Increased sensitivity to endotoxemia by tissue necrosis. In this study the interaction of endotoxemia and ischemic organ injury was investigated in a rat model. Animals received lipopolysaccharide to induce endotoxemia and were simultaneously subjected to renal ischemia. If only renal ischemia was induced, moderate azotemia occurred and all animals survived. Lipopolysaccharide treatment caused neither renal failure nor death. However, rats with both endotoxemia and renal ischemia showed severe azotemia, and 50% of the animals died within 48 hours. The observed mortality rate is unlikely related to renal failure since animals subjected to bilateral nephrectomy did not die within 48 hours after treatment with lipopolysaccharide. To further exclude the role of renal failure in the enhanced effect of endotoxemia, experiments were performed in which ischemic kidneys were excised from littermates and were placed in the abdomens of lipopolysaccharide-treated animals. A similar effect was observed: 50% of the animals died within 48 hours. Azotemia did not occur. Since tumor necrosis factor (TNF) is an important cytokine involved in endotoxemia-induced morbidity and death, we studied the role of TNF in our model. Plasma levels of TNF were increased during endotoxemia. Concomitant renal ischemic injury did not influence the concentration of TNF. When animals were treated with recombinant TNF and were subsequently subjected to renal ischemic injury, again a 50% mortality was observed, a rate similar to that in lipopolysaccharide-treated animals. We conclude that the sensitivity to endotoxemia is enhanced by tissue necrosis and may lead to death in the experimental model used in this study. 
5	Polyamines and ornithine decarboxylase during repair of duodenal mucosa after stress in rats. This investigation shows whether polyamines and ornithine decarboxylase have a role in duodenal mucosal repair following stress-induced microscopic damage. Rats were fasted for 22 hours, placed in restraint cages, and immersed in water to the xiphoid process for 6 hours. Animals were killed either immediately after the period of stress or at 2-hour intervals up to 24 hours thereafter. Duodenal mucosa was examined histologically, and ornithine decarboxylase and polyamine levels were measured. Ornithine decarboxylase activity was increased significantly up to 6 hours following stress, peaking at 4 hours at a level 10 times the prestress control. By 8 hours, enzyme activity had returned to near normal. Increases in mucosal putrescine, spermidine, and spermine content paralleled the changes in ornithine decarboxylase activity and peaked 4 hours after stress. Stress resulted in microscopic damage evidenced by a nearly complete absence of villi. Significant macroscopic lesions were not present following stress. Mucosal repair was evident 12 hours after stress and almost complete by 24 hours, although the restituted villi were short and blunted. The decreases in mucosal DNA, RNA, and protein content caused by stress were restored and reached near-normal levels 12 hours after the period of stress. In animals given the specific inhibitor of ornithine decarboxylase, alpha-difluoromethylornithine, increases in duodenal mucosal ornithine decarboxylase activity and polyamine levels were inhibited and mucosal repair was almost completely prevented following stress. alpha-Difluoromethylornithine also prevented the recovery of DNA, RNA, and protein content of the duodenal mucosa. These results indicate that duodenal mucosal damage following stress is repaired rapidly; the repair process is accompanied by significant increases in ornithine decarboxylase activity and polyamine levels; and the increases in ornithine decarboxylase and polyamines are absolutely required for the normal repair of the mucosa. 
5	The acute and insidious onset of pulmonary metastatic transitional cell carcinoma. Transitional cell carcinoma is a common urologic neoplasm. Although pulmonary metastases from this tumor are often not appreciated clinically, they are frequently documented in autopsy studies. Therefore, the clinical recognition of this condition can be problematic. To illustrate this point, we present three patients with progressive unexplained dyspnea and histories of transitional cell carcinoma. Since ineffective and possibly detrimental therapeutic approaches may be initiated, a high index of suspicion for pulmonary metastatic embolization must be maintained. Early histologic identification of these metastatic emboli and initiation of effective chemotherapy may prove beneficial for improved quality of life. 
5	Suicide in twins. Suicide appears to cluster in families, suggesting that genetic factors may play a role in this behavior. We studied 176 twin pairs in which one or both twins had committed suicide. Seven of the 62 monozygotic twin pairs were concordant for suicide compared with two of the 114 dizygotic twin pairs (11.3% vs 1.8%). The presence of psychiatric disorder in the twins and their families was examined in a subsample of 11 twin pairs, two of whom were concordant for suicide. Eleven of these 13 twin suicide victims had been treated for psychiatric disorder, as had eight of their nine surviving cotwins. In addition, twins in 10 pairs had other first- or second-degree relatives who had been treated for psychiatric disorder. Thus, these twin data suggest that genetic factors related to suicide may largely represent a genetic predisposition for the psychiatric disorders associated with suicide. However, they leave open the question of whether there may be an independent genetic component for suicide. 
5	Mean arterial blood pressure changes in premature infants and those at risk for intraventricular hemorrhage. Bedside microcomputer-derived, minute-to-minute mean arterial pressure (MAP) values during the first 48 hours of life were studied in 100 preterm babies with birth weight less than or equal to 1500 gm. In those babies (n = 72) with no periventricular-intraventricular hemorrhage (PV-IVH) or with grade 1 PV-IVH, the MAP values increased during the study period, with minute-to-minute variation and interval undulation. The MAP values in those with birth weight greater than 1000 gm were higher than in those of lower birth weight. Infants in whom grades 2 to 4 PV-IVH developed (n = 28) had consistently lower MAP values during the study period. Minute-to-minute variability, expressed as the average of the coefficients of variation at 15-minute intervals, did not differ between birth weight groups, nor did they differ between the PV-IVH group and their matched control subjects. However, those with PV-IVH spent a greater percentage of time, with a coefficient of variation greater than or equal to 13% or less than 3%, than their matched control subjects spent (p less than 0.005). This study provides reference data for MAP changes in premature babies. The observed MAP changes in those with PV-IVH lend support to a significant role for MAP alterations in the pathogenesis of PV-IVH. 
2	Preperitoneal herniorrhaphy for the acutely incarcerated groin hernia. Elective preperitoneal or posterior repair for recurrent groin hernias and primary femoral hernias has been shown to be a technically advantageous approach. In addition to the ease of inguinal floor and femoral canal assessment, scar tissue from prior anterior herniorrhaphy can be avoided. The emergency management of the acutely incarcerated or strangulated hernia of the groin using this approach has not been addressed. During a 30-month period, all patients with a diagnosis of acute incarceration of a groin hernia (n = 28) were surgically managed using either the anterior approach (AA) (n = 14) or the preperitoneal approach (PA) (n = 14). Two patients with strangulated intestine in the AA group required an additional midline incision for bowel evaluation and resection. Intestinal evaluation was easily accomplished through the same incision in four patients in the PA group. The preperitoneal approach also allowed proximal control of incarcerated or strangulated viscera, thus avoiding excessive manipulation of gangrenous or necrotic intestine, potential spillage of infected contents into the peritoneal cavity, and entry of bacteria, toxins, potassium, and the metabolic waste products of anaerobic metabolism into the systemic circulation during hernia reduction. There have been no recurrences in either group, and minor complications, such as wound infection and cellulitis, in the two groups are not statistically different. 
1	The genetics of retinoblastoma. Relevance to the patient. The understanding of the molecular biology of human cancer has advanced rapidly in the last decade, in part due to discoveries in the rare, pediatric ocular tumor, retinoblastoma. RB studies have led to recognition of a class of human genes, the tumor suppressor genes, that are critical in the initiation and progression of the malignant process. Mutations in the RB1 gene initiate RB and other specific tumors. They may also contribute to progressive stages of many other malignancies. The protein product of RB1 (p110RB1) is a basic regulator of the cell cycle. In the absence of normal protein, the cell proceeds to the next cell division without the potential to become quiescent. Understanding the genetics of RB has benefited the patients, as the precise identification of the RB1 mutations in families has led to accurate prediction of individuals at risk for RB tumors. It seems unlikely, in the foreseeable future, that direct genetic manipulation of mutant RB1 genes will play a role in therapy, but complete understanding of the function of p110RB1 may eventually allow exploitation of its powerful antiproliferative effect. Other molecular genetic events in addition to RB1 mutations are documented in RB tumors, and may play a critical role in the full malignant phenotype. The oncogene, N-myc, is amplified in some RB tumors and is expressed in normal fetal retina. The cytogenetic abnormality, i(6p), is almost unique to RB tumors. The molecular and tissue-specific roles of these abnormalities are not yet known. Many RB tumors also acquire excessive expression of the cell surface membrane glycoprotein, p170, linked to multidrug resistance, whether or not the RB tumor has been exposed to chemotherapy. We anticipate that ways to avoid or counteract the drug resistance of excessive p170 expression will be developed for other pediatric tumors and eventually will be applied to chemotherapy for RB patients. 
5	Electrocardiographic abnormalities in cerebrovascular accidents. The electrocardiographic abnormalities found in 100 patients with acute cerebrovascular disease and previously normal hearts are described. The abnormalities were more often seen in patients with intracerebral and subarachnoid hemorrhages. The most common changes were Q-Tc Prolongation and ST segment and T wave abnormalities. The mechanisms of these electrocardiographic abnormalities appear to be multiple. 
1	Who is being screened for melanoma/skin cancer? Characteristics of persons screened in Massachusetts. We conducted a survey of persons who voluntarily attended melanoma/skin cancer screenings in Massachusetts in 1987. Of 1219 persons asked to fill out a questionnaire, 1116 (92%) completed it. Our study demonstrates that persons attending the melanoma/skin cancer screening program were, for the most part, at risk for the disease and appropriately selected themselves to be screened. Most were women, well educated (with college or advanced degrees), and white. More than 86% had at least one risk factor for melanoma/skin cancer whereas 78% had at least two risk factors. Future studies are necessary to determine whether our experience can be verified. Additional efforts should try to attract those who are at risk but perhaps are less willing to attend screening programs--men and those of lower socioeconomic status. These efforts can help target screening to those at highest risk and maximize the yield of these public health efforts. 
4	A prospective randomized study of cerebrospinal fluid drainage to prevent paraplegia after high-risk surgery on the thoracoabdominal aorta. This article is concerned with the study of the effect of several variables, principally that of cerebrospinal fluid drainage, on the incidence of neurologic deficit in a prospective randomized series of patients with extensive aneurysms of the descending thoracic and abdominal aorta (thoracoabdominal type I and II). Forty-six patients had cerebrospinal fluid drainage, and 52 were controls, with a total of 98 available for study. Cerebrospinal fluid pressure was continuously monitored in the former group and pressure maintained less than or equal to 10 mm Hg in 20, less than or equal to 15 mm Hg in 20, and greater than 15 mm Hg in 6 patients during period of aortic clamping. The method of treatment including reattachment of intercostal and lumbar arteries (p = 0.2), temporary atriofemoral bypass during aortic occlusion (p = 0.3), and spinal fluid drainage (p = 0.8) were not statistically significant in reducing the incidence of neurologic deficits. Thus cerebrospinal fluid drainage as we used it, was not beneficial in preventing paraplegia. On appropriate statistical analysis we found that the only significant predictor of delayed deficits was postoperative hypotension (p = 0.006). 
4	Coronary bypass grafting with totally calcified or acutely dissected ascending aorta. From August 1984 through November 1988, 10 of 2,658 patients undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting had ascending aortic disease that was not amenable to proximal anastomoses for coronary bypass grafting. This was due to a calcified aorta in 6 and acute aortic dissection in 4. There were 5 male and 5 female patients with a mean age of 71 years. Cannulation site was the femoral artery in 5, ascending aorta in 3, and aortic arch in 2. Profound hypothermia and ventricular fibrillation, with no cross-clamp or cardioplegia, was used in 9 patients, and circulatory arrest in 1. In 8 patients a single internal mammary artery was used as the total inflow with a saphenous vein graft brought off the internal mammary artery to one or more distal left-sided coronary vessels. Bilateral internal mammary arteries were used in 2 other patients. Operative mortality was zero. There was one perioperative myocardial infarction and one transient stroke without sequelae. All patients have done well from 1 to 6 years postoperatively. These data support the use of internal mammary arteries as single or bilateral proximal conduits for other venoarterial bypass grafts when the aorta is extensively diseased either by calcification or dissection. 
1	Cardiac rhabdomyoma. Rare cause of fetal death. Two cases of nonimmune hydrops fetalis and fetal death associated with cardiac rhabdomyoma are reported. Case 1 presented with fetal supraventricular tachycardia, and cardiac rhabdomyoma was accurately diagnosed by fetal echocardiography. Autopsy revealed multiple rhabdomyomata involving the right atrial free wall, the sinoatrial node, and the left ventricle. The left circumflex coronary artery was extrinsically compressed by adjacent tumor tissue, causing left ventricular myocardial infarction. Case 2 had a unique, pedunculated, ball-like rhabdomyoma that almost totally occluded the mitral orifice. The causes of fetal death in patients with cardiac rhabdomyoma are analyzed and the possibility of fetal surgical management is proposed. 
4	Popliteal vascular trauma. A community experience. Preventing amputation continues to be a significant challenge when popliteal vascular injuries occur. A retrospective review of cases from the San Diego County (California) Trauma System identified 108 patients with 76 blunt and 32 penetrating arterial injuries. The limb preservation rate was 88%; there were 13 amputations. The fracture-dislocated knee injury and close-range shotgun blasts were particularly limb threatening. In general, the trauma system achieved rapid evaluation of injuries and early operative intervention. All 13 patients who underwent amputations presented with signs of severe ischemia. Concomitant injuries to the popliteal vein, tibial nerves, and soft tissue were significantly more frequent in patients who underwent amputations. The importance of complete fasciotomy for compartment hypertension, early reconstructive management of soft-tissue injuries, and expeditious arterial repair, frequently without preoperative roentgenographic suite arteriography, is emphasized. An aggressive, multidisciplinary approach is required to achieve a functional extremity when popliteal vascular trauma occurs. 
4	Reduced atrial contribution to left ventricular filling in patients with severe tricuspid regurgitation after tricuspid valvulectomy: a Doppler echocardiographic study. Patients undergoing valvulectomy for isolated tricuspid valve endocarditis offer the unique opportunity to study the effects of acquired right ventricular volume overload on left ventricular filling in persons free of pulmonary hypertension and preexisting left heart disease. Eleven patients who had undergone total or partial removal of the tricuspid valve were compared with 11 age-matched control subjects; Doppler echocardiographic techniques were used to quantify changes in left ventricular filling and to relate them to changes in left ventricular and left atrial geometry caused by right ventricular and right atrial distension. The late diastolic fractional transmitral flow velocity integral, a measure of the left atrial contribution to left ventricular filling, was significantly decreased in patients undergoing tricuspid valvulectomy compared with control subjects (0.22 +/- 0.11 versus 0.32 +/- 0.09; p less than 0.04). Severe tricuspid regurgitation in these patients resulted in marked right atrial distension, reversal of the normal interatrial septal curvature and compression of the left atrium such that left atrial area was significantly smaller than in control subjects (5.9 +/- 2.2 versus 8.6 +/- 1.2 cm2/m2; p less than 0.005). Acting as a receiving chamber, the left ventricle was maximally compressed by the volume-overloaded right ventricle in late diastole, coincident with the timing of atrial systole, resulting in a significant increase in the left ventricular eccentricity index compared with that in control subjects (1.35 +/- 0.14 versus 1.03 +/- 0.1; p less than 0.001). Thus, right ventricular volume overload due to severe tricuspid regurgitation results in left heart geometric alterations that decrease left atrial preload, impair left ventricular receiving chamber characteristics and reduce the atrial contribution to total left ventricular filling. 
1	Identification of transforming growth factor beta family members present in bone-inductive protein purified from bovine bone. Characterization of the polypeptides present in bone-inductive protein extracts from bovine bone has led to the cloning of seven regulatory molecules, six of which are distantly related to transforming growth factor beta. The three human bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs) we describe herein, BMP-5, BMP-6, and BMP-7, show extensive sequence similarity to BMP-2, a molecule that by itself is sufficient to induce de novo bone formation in vivo. The additive or synergistic contribution of these BMP-2-related molecules to the osteogenic activity associated with demineralized bone is strongly implicated by the presence of these growth factors in the most active fractions of highly purified bone extract. 
3	Panic disorder in seizure patients: a diagnostic pitfall. Panic disorder is a psychiatric diagnosis whose main feature is paroxysmal attacks of anxiety that strike suddenly without apparent provocation. Physicians explain the attacks as an ictal phenomenon in patients with known seizures because of their similarities to complex partial seizures. We report eight patients with seizures and panic disorder. Recognition of a second diagnostic entity resulted in a beneficial change in treatment in six of the eight. We did not find an increased incidence of panic disorder in our seizure clinic population as compared with the general population. 
5	Anterior perforations in lumbar discectomies. A report of four cases of vascular complications and a CT study of the prevertebral lumbar anatomy. Four cases of vascular complications to anterior perforations during discectomy prompted a CT study to measure lumbar disc diameters and to evaluate the prevertebral anatomy. Fifty young adults who had been referred for low-back pain and/or sciatica but had not undergone operation were included. In five additional patients, prone versus supine CT examinations were compared. Six typical configurations of the vascular anatomy could be classified to explain the type of vascular complications occurring at the L3-4 and L4-L5 disc levels. The sagittal diameter of the three lowest lumbar discs varied from 33 to 56 mm, indicating the importance of this parameter as an intraoperative guideline for the spine surgeon. Air-filled intestines were observed anterior to the L5-S1 disc predominantly in the prone position. The possible relationship between this finding and postoperative discitis is discussed. 
5	A syndrome characterized by nodular eosinophilic infiltration of the skin and immunoglobulin isotype imbalance. A 9-year-old boy had recurrent acute, plaquelike, nodular infiltrations with overlying vesicles and bullae of the face and right hand. Histologically, the lesions consisted of a perivascular and periadnexal lymphohistiocytic infiltrate with many eosinophils. The lesions responded to dapsone therapy. Laboratory studies revealed blood eosinophilia, hyperimmunoglobulinemias E and G4, and hypoimmunoglobulinemias M and G1-3, which normalized after treatment. The patient's immune deviation is consistent with a transient imbalance of lymphokine production in helper T cells. 
3	Continuous removal of middle molecules by hemofiltration in patients with acute liver failure. In patients with acute liver failure and hepatic coma, an increase in the abnormal "middle molecules" seen on the chromatograms of the sera is suspected of playing an etiologic role in the coma. A pilot study of continuous hemofiltration using a high-performance membrane was conducted in 16 such patients in an attempt to decrease the serum levels of the middle molecules. The procedure was used alternately with plasma exchange. High-performance liquid chromatography showed a notable removal of the substances in the filtrates and a sequential removal from the serum by hemofiltration. Eight (50%) of the 16 patients had amelioration in level of consciousness and were weaned successfully from hemofiltration. Although only three of the 16 patients survived the acute illness, 13 others lived an average of 15 days and five patients survived greater than 3 wk. While the continuous removal of middle molecules from the serum may not reverse liver failure, this procedure used in conjunction with plasma exchange may provide a means of life support, e.g., for patients awaiting a liver transplant. 
1	Pleuroperitoneal shunting for intractable pleural effusions. Pleuroperitoneal shunts were implanted in 17 patients with intractable pleural effusions, 15 of which were malignant and 2 benign. Complicating factors included 13 instances of severe trapped lung and 3 cases of synchronous ascites. There was one hospital death. Palliation of dyspnea at rest was achieved in all patients, although 3 required oxygen with exertion. Four shunts became occluded between 1 and 10 months after placement. Two of these were replaced. The remaining conduits continued to function to the present or until the patients' deaths between 1 and 28 months. Shunting allowed hospital discharge and provided symptomatic relief in a group of patients in whom other approaches had failed or were not applicable. 
2	Study of preneoplastic changes of liver cells by immunohistochemical and molecular hybridization techniques. The status of hepatitis B virus DNA was investigated by in situ hybridization in multifocal areas of a noncancerous hepatitis B virus-associated cirrhosis. This liver exhibited a marked degree of dysplasia and adenomatous hyperplasia. The results of these studies were correlated with the histopathology and immunohistochemical stains for hepatitis B core and surface antigens. There was clear evidence of a marked reduction to absence of hepatitis B viral DNA by in situ hybridization and absence of HBc and HBsAg in the foci of liver cell dysplasia and adenomatous hyperplasia. These results support the hypothesis that liver cell dysplasia and adenomatous hyperplasia are preneoplastic in nature. 
1	The epidemiology of ophthalmic malignancies in New York State. The epidemiologic characteristics of more than 1400 primary eye cancers (ICD-9, site 190) diagnosed among New York State (NYS) residents between 1975 and 1986 are described. Among NYS male residents, the average annual age-adjusted incidence rate was 7.5 per 1,000,000, and among NYS female residents, the rate was 5.4 per 1,000,000 (male:female rate ratio, 1.39). The majority of ophthalmic malignancies were included within three histologic groupings: melanomas (70.4%), retinoblastomas (9.8%), and squamous cell carcinomas (9.2%). The average annual incidence of retinoblastoma among persons in NYS who were less than 5 years of age was 9.5 per 1,000,000 for boys and 8.7 per 1,000,000 for girls (male:female rate ratio, 1.09). The average annual incidence (age-adjusted) of ocular melanomas was 4.9 per 1,000,000 among men and 3.7 per 1,000,000 among women in NYS (male:female rate ratio, 1.32). Expanded knowledge of the epidemiology of ophthalmic cancers can help to develop a foundation on which to monitor disease patterns and can serve to stimulate further etiologic research involving these rare malignancies. 
3	Chronic pain in primary care. Identification and management of psychosocial factors. Chronic pain is a problem of great public health importance that is frequently seen in the primary care setting. Pain chronicity shows a strong association with psychosocial factors. Assessment of these factors should be composed of two parts: (1) psychological factors and (2) psychiatric illness. Psychological factors include all those pain-associated alterations in the patient's environment that reinforce illness behavior. Psychiatric illness includes those syndromes that retard recovery from illness or injury, such as depression, anxiety, substance abuse, and dementia. Psychiatric and psychological interventions can be successfully introduced in the context of a comprehensive rehabilitation effort. Usually these interventions can be accomplished by the family physician in concert with a consultant psychiatrist or psychologist. In severely disabled or resistant patients, referral to a multidisciplinary pain clinic will be necessary. 
4	Surgical resection of intrinsic brain stem lesions: an overview. A major limitation to the effective treatment of intrinsic mass lesions of the brain stem has been the inability to clearly define the pathological anatomy radiographically. The improved soft tissue resolution offered by magnetic resonance imaging, as compared with axial computed tomography, now makes it possible not only to accurately distinguish anatomical relationships, but also to predict the pathological nature of the lesion. Accordingly, we have been encouraged to pursue a more aggressive approach to intrinsic lesions of the brain stem that appear well circumscribed on magnetic resonance imaging scan. The object of this paper is to report the successful treatment of four intrinsic lesions of the brain stem and to present an overview of the relevant published experience. 
1	Immunohistochemical studies on the main entrance-route of CA19-9 into the peripheral venous blood of gastric cancer patients. Correlation with CA19-9 levels in peripheral and portal blood. The correlation between CA19-9 levels of portal and peripheral venous blood, and immunohistochemical variables of cancer lesions was examined in 53 gastric cancer patients and eight patients with benign diseases. Immunohistochemically, CA19-9 was found in 33 (62.5%) of 53 primary lesions. The antigen was found in the cancer cells of invasive lymphatics and node metastases of every CA19-9 localized cancer, although the cancer cells in veins showed little or no CA19-9. There was little or no antigen in the cancer cells in veins, lymphatics, or metastases of 20 CA19-9 nonlocalized primary lesions. Patients with CA19-9 nonlocalized cancer or with benign diseases showed no elevation of the antigen levels in peripheral or portal blood. CA19-9 levels of portal blood (mean, 76.4 U/ml; positive rate, 33.3%) were not different from those of peripheral blood (mean, 91.5 U/ml; positive rate, 33.3%). Additionally, the antigen levels of the blood in patients with lymphatic invasion or node metastases were significantly higher than those in patients without the invasion or the metastases, and every patient without the invasion showed no elevation of the antigen. These results suggest that production of the antigen in cancer cells may be a premise of CA19-9 elevation in peripheral blood and that CA19-9 may be drained by the thoracic duct of the lymphatic system via node metastases or invasive lymphatics, but not by the hematogenous portal system. 
2	The value of push-type jejunal endoscopy in familial adenomatosis coli/Gardner's syndrome. Push-type jejunal endoscopy using a long forward-viewing duodenofiberscope was performed in 10 patients with familial adenomatosis coli/Gardner's syndrome. Jejunal polypoid lesions were detected in nine of the 10 patients (90%). The lesions appeared sessile, whitish, and measured 3 mm or less in diameter. Histologic findings of the biopsy specimens from these polypoid lesions revealed tubular adenoma in all nine patients. In addition, this method led to the detection of duodenal adenomas in one patient, in whom duodenofiberscopy with the side-viewing instrument revealed no polypoid lesions in the bulb and second portion of the duodenum. In view of these results, we recommend that push-type jejunal endoscopy, as well as side-viewing duodenofiberscopy, should be added to the usual preoperative examinations done in patients with this disease. 
5	Expression of X protein and hepatitis B virus replication in chronic hepatitis. The X protein can act on the enhancer of hepatitis B virus in an in vitro system and elevate the transcriptional level of hepatitis B virus. However, because no relationship had been reported between X protein expression and hepatitis B virus replication in patients with chronic hepatitis B, we focused on its expression in the liver in comparison with markers of hepatitis B virus replication. Liver biopsy samples and sera from 59 carriers with HBsAg were examined immunohistochemically for X protein using rabbit IgG against recombinant X protein. There was a significant difference in the serum hepatitis B virus DNA level between X protein-positive and -negative patients (p less than 0.001). Serum pre-S1 and pre-S2 antigens were also measured quantitatively by enzyme immunoassay using monoclonal antibodies specific against each antigen. The titers of pre-S1 antigen in patients positive for X protein were significantly higher (p less than 0.001) than those of the X protein-negative patients (3.02 +/- 0.99 vs. 2.00 +/- 0.59, respectively). Similarly, the titers of pre-S2 antigen were 2.98 +/- 0.91 vs. 1.94 +/- 0.54, respectively (p less than 0.001). The rate of positivity of the X protein was higher (38 of 49; 77.6%) in the replicative group (serum HBeAg, serum hepatitis B virus DNA or HBcAg in liver positive) compared with that observed in the nonreplicative group (3 of 10; 30%--serum HBeAg, serum hepatitis B virus DNA and HBcAg in liver negative) (p less than 0.01). 
3	Effect of ethanol on the efficacy of nasal continuous positive airway pressure as a treatment for obstructive sleep apnea. The effect of ethanol ingestion on the efficacy of nasal continuous positive airway pressure (nasal CPAP) as a treatment for the obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) syndrome was studied in ten obese male subjects undergoing this therapy. On the first night of polysomnography, the lowest level of CPAP that maintained airway patency was determined (critical level). On the second (control) night (C), subjects slept the entire night on this level of CPAP. On the third night (E), subjects ingested either 1.5 ml/kg (part A, N = 6) or 2.0 ml/kg (part B, N = 4) of 50 percent ethanol (100 proof vodka) over one half-hour starting 1 h before bedtime. A serum ethanol level was obtained at bedtime (part A: 63.7 +/- 17.3 mg/dl; part B: 108.6 +/- 20.6 mg/dl), and subjects were monitored on the critical level of CPAP. Comparison of nights C and E for parts A + B showed no difference in total sleep time (TST) or the amount of different sleep stages as an absolute time or a percentage of TST except that there was more stage 2 (as a percent of TST) on E nights. The apnea + hypopnea index and C and E nights did not differ and was quite low (3.6 +/- 3.7/h vs 1.9 +/- 2.7/h). Similarly, ethanol ingestion did not increase the number of desaturations to at or below 90 and 85 percent, or lower the mean arterial oxygen saturation in NREM or REM sleep. Analysis of parts A and B separately also showed no differences with respect to the apnea + hypopnea index or the number of desaturations on control and ethanol nights. We conclude that acute moderate ethanol ingestion does not decrease the efficacy of an optimum level of nasal CPAP. 
5	Modified technique of Pringle's maneuver in resection of the liver. Crushing of the hepatic parenchyma with hepatic clamps to minimize blood loss during resection of the liver leads to mechanical damage of hepatocytes. Pringle's maneuver may precipitate liver failure by hepatic warm ischemia as well. Therefore, we controlled bleeding from the surface of the resection by using light compression on the hepatic parenchyma with a band while applying a hepatic arterial clamp at the hepatic hilus. This vascular control method can be done because the portal pressure is about one-tenth of the hepatic artery pressure and provides an efficient and harmless transection of the liver. 
3	Transcranial Doppler ultrasonography: clinical applications in cerebrovascular disease. Transcranial Doppler ultrasonography was introduced in 1982 as a noninvasive procedure for assessment of the intracranial cerebral circulation. The lightweight and portable equipment used for transcranial Doppler examination facilitates its use in the bedside assessment of critically ill hospitalized patients and outpatients. Clinical applications include the diagnosis of vasospasm in patients with subarachnoid hemorrhage, assessment of intracranial collateral flow in patients with extracranial arterial occlusive disease, detection of intracranial arterial stenosis, identification of the feeding arteries of arteriovenous malformations and monitoring the hemodynamic effects of their treatment, confirmation of the clinical diagnosis of brain death, intensive-care unit monitoring of brain-injured patients, and intraoperative and postoperative monitoring of neurosurgical patients. Transcranial Doppler technology is also providing new insights into the pathophysiologic mechanisms of a variety of cerebrovascular conditions. Clinicians will find transcranial Doppler technology most helpful if they have a specific question about the status of the intracranial circulation. Further investigations may expand the clinical and research utility of this technology. 
2	Outpatient health care utilization of patients with inflammatory bowel disease. On the basis of the normal life expectancy of inflammatory bowel disease patients, the early onset of their disease, and the variety of symptoms, inflammatory bowel disease patients were anticipated to be frequent users of outpatients services. This study assesses (1) the characteristics, (2) outpatient health care utilization, and (3) the degree of satisfaction with health care of inflammatory bowel disease patients compared to patients with other gastrointestinal disease. The study method was a secondary analysis of data collected on 395 patients attending the University of Calgary Gastroenterology Outpatient Clinic in 1988. Inflammatory bowel disease patients were significantly younger (P less than 0.001) and better educated (P less than 0.05) than other patients. During the past year inflammatory bowel disease patients consulted significantly more often with their gastroenterologist (P less than 0.001) and spent more time in hospital (P less than 0.05) than other patients. Inflammatory bowel disease patients also consulted more frequently with herbalists and naturopaths. Lastly, inflammatory bowel disease patients were as satisfied with the health care they received as other patients. These results provide information useful for health care planners as well as for those dealing directly with inflammatory bowel disease patients. 
5	Total bladder replacement using detubularized sigmoid colon: technique and results. We performed total bladder replacement with a detubularized segment of sigmoid colon in patients after cystoprostatectomy. The surgical technique and long-term results in 27 patients are reported. This neobladder configuration compared favorably with other neobladder types regarding ease of construction. The surgical complications were acceptable. Initial reservoir function was good but improved further with time. After 1 year the capacity averaged 600 cc, pressures during filling and at capacity were low (average 12 and 16 cm. water) and emptying was satisfactory (residual urine 4 to 80 cc). All patients were continent during the day and 67% were continent at night without excessive voiding habits. Nighttime incontinence was further resolved in 2 patients by using the AMS 800 artificial sphincter around the bulbous urethra. The detubularized sigmoid is an excellent neobladder configuration after cystoprostatectomy. 
1	Relationship between histologic features, DNA flow cytometry, and clinical behavior of squamous cell carcinomas of the larynx. Flow cytometric analysis of DNA content was done on 133 primary squamous cell carcinomas of the larynx. Overall, 76 tumors (57.1%) were not diploid (aneuploid or tetraploid). The DNA index (DI) was calculated and grouped into three levels. Fifty-seven cases had a DI in a range of 1.85 to 2.15 (44 diploid and 13 tetraploid). The cases were grouped in relation to ploidy, proliferative index, and the tumor-node-metastasis (TNM) system. Every group was analyzed with respect to survival rate. Ploidy was related to histocytologic grade. In well-differentiated tumors (G1) survival rates at 48 months were 41.7% in diploid cases and 27.7% in nondiploid ones (relative risk [RR], 2.01; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.89, 4.52). In NO cases that underwent surgery, survival rates at 48 months were, respectively, 81.8% and 49.2% (RR, 5.07; 95% CI, 0.76, 33.93). These results suggest that ploidy may be a new independent parameter of prognosis in squamous cell carcinoma of the larynx. This is useful in clinical practice because it allows the clinician to recognize those cases with poorer prognosis among the early tumors at a stage where other prognostic parameters are not yet available. 
1	Automated immunohistochemical estrogen receptor in fixed embedded breast carcinomas. The authors immunohistochemically assessed the presence of estrogen receptor (ER) in formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue sections of 68 breast carcinomas by an automated method using Pronase (CalBiochem, La Jolla, CA) predigestion and alkaline phosphatase detection (Method 1). These results were compared with those obtained by an automated peroxidase-antiperoxidase method with DNAse pretreatment of fixed embedded sections (Method 2), with ER immunostain on frozen sections (Method 3), and with biochemical results (dextran-coated charcoal cytosolic [DCC] assay). Compared with the DCC assay, Methods 1, 2, and 3 gave sensitivities of 54%, 25%, and 89%, respectively. The sensitivity for Method 1 was increased to 74% in those cases with DCC results showing greater than 50 fmol/mg protein. These findings indicate that ER immunohistochemical studies on formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissues (as assayed by Method 1) provide useful clinical information when the results are positive. A negative result, especially if surrounding normal elements are not positive, may indicate no receptors, receptor levels less than 50 fmol/mg protein, or improper tissue preservation. In the absence of fresh tissue for ER assay by DCC assay or of frozen sections for immunostaining, and with an understanding of its limitations, this method may be useful. 
4	Interventricular coronary steal induced by stenosis of left anterior descending coronary artery in exercising pigs. BACKGROUND. In pigs and humans, the left anterior descending coronary artery (LAD) supplies the left ventricular anterior wall (LVAW), anterior septum, and paraseptal band of the right ventricular anterior wall (RVAW). The purposes of our study were 1) to study the LAD flow distribution in these walls during preexercise, exercise, and exercise with LAD stenosis and 2) to analyze regional wall motion under these conditions. METHODS AND RESULTS. Nine pigs were instrumented with sonomicrometers for measuring percent wall thickening (%WTh) in LVAW, RVAW, and lateral (control) walls of both ventricles, a hydraulic occluder at the LAD origin, an LV pressure transducer, and catheters for radioactive microsphere injection (left atrium) and blood withdrawal (aorta). One month later, regional %WTh and flows were measured during preexercise, exercise, and continuing exercise with LAD stenosis resulting in more than 50% reduction in systolic LVAW %WTh with regard to exercise. LAD stenosis caused a dramatic decrease in total mean +/- SD LVAW subendocardial flow with regard to exercise (28.7 +/- 8 to 9.1 +/- 3.2 ml.min-1, p less than 0.0001) but not significant changes in either LVAW subepicardial flow or RVAW flow. The transmural distribution of flows within the LAD bed (as percentages of the total LAD flow in each experimental condition) showed that LAD stenosis redistributed flows with regard to exercise such that the LVAW subendocardial flow decreased from 26.4 +/- 4.2% of the total LAD flow to 11.8 +/- 4.3% (p less than 0.0001), whereas LVAW subepicardial flow increased from 32.9 +/- 2.3% of the total LAD flow to 45.5 +/- 7.9% (p less than 0.0001) and RVAW increased from 12 +/- 4.9% of the total LAD flow to 18.7 +/- 7.2% (p less than 0.0005). With exercise plus LAD stenosis, LVAW %WTh decreased from 43.2 +/- 8.4% to 17.2 +/- 9.7% (p less than 0.0001), but RVAW %WTh did not change. CONCLUSIONS. In the LAD bed of exercising pigs, LAD stenosis induces, in addition to transmural steal, an interventricular steal favoring the RVAW at the expense of the LVAW subendocardium. This steal results in preserved RVAW thickening despite severe LVAW hypokinesia. 
5	Omeprazole 20 mg three days a week and 10 mg daily in prevention of duodenal ulcer relapse. Double-blind comparative trial. In a double-blind, parallel-group clinical trial of 195 patients with duodenal ulcers who after a short-term study had relief of pain and healed ulcers proved endoscopically, 65 were randomized to receive 20 mg omeprazole 3 days a week (once in the morning from Friday to Sunday), 64 to receive 10 mg omeprazole once daily in the morning, and 66 to receive placebo for up to 6 months. The patients underwent repeat endoscopy with biopsy of the gastric fundic mucosa (qualitative assessment of argyrophilic cell population), assessment of symptoms, and laboratory screening with measurement of basal serum gastrin concentrations at 3 and 6 months or more often if indicated by recurrence of symptoms. At 3 months, endoscopically proved ulcer relapse occurred in 16% receiving 20 mg omeprazole 3 days a week; 21% receiving 10 mg omeprazole daily; and 50% receiving placebo. At 6 months, corresponding rates were 23%, 27%, and 67% with 95% confidence intervals of difference between the placebo group and omeprazole groups of 28%-60% and 24%-56% (P less than 0.00001), respectively, and between omeprazole groups of -19%-11% (NS). No major clinical or laboratory side effects were noted. Thus both omeprazole regimens are effective and safe in preventing duodenal ulcer relapse. 
1	Neoadjuvant Cis-DDP in esophageal cancers: an experience at a regional cancer centre, India. We are analysing the results of 80 patients who underwent surgery during 1983-84 for esophageal cancer. Forty patients who received pre-operative single agent Cis-DDP were grouped under "A" and 40 patients who went for surgery directly were grouped under "B". Twenty-two patients (55%) of Group A showed tumor necrosis. Both groups underwent resection and hand-sewn anastamosis of the esophagus. There were 10 post-operative deaths among 80 resected cases, 9 of them being from anastomatic leak. Cis-DDP has induced negligible side effects. A comparatively high survival rate during early years in patients who responded to Cis-DDP suggests that neoadjuvant chemotherapy might be of value. 
2	Brush cytology in the diagnosis of colonic neoplasms. During a three-year period (1986-1988), 234 colonic brush specimens were received in the authors' laboratory. Nine samples (4%) were deemed unsatisfactory for evaluation because of inadequate cellularity and/or poor fixation. In 11 cases concomitant or follow-up histologic specimens were not available. The remaining 214 specimens included 82 malignant neoplasms, 88 neoplastic polyps (adenomas), and 44 nonneoplastic lesions. Sixty-seven (82%) of malignant neoplasms were correctly diagnosed by brush cytology. Three cases of adenoma with severe dysplasia or in situ carcinoma were diagnosed as adenocarcinoma by cytology. No false-positive diagnoses were made of nonneoplastic lesions. Brush cytology was found to be a more sensitive technique in the diagnosis of colon cancer than endoscopic biopsy (82% and 74% sensitivity, respectively). The combination of the two techniques increased the sensitivity to 90% and improved the overall accuracy of the test. Seventy-one (82%) of the colonic adenomas were correctly diagnosed by cytology. Brush cytology is a convenient, safe, and accurate technique which should be used concurrently with endoscopic biopsy or polypectomy. 
5	Freezing lesions of the developing rat brain: a model for cerebrocortical microgyria. Cerebrocortical microgyri were induced by placing a freezing probe on the skull of P0 and P1 rat pups. Freezing lesions resulted in laminar necrosis of the infragranular layers and the subsequent migration of supragranular neurons through the region of damage. The result was most often a region of four-layered microgyric cortex consisting of a molecular layer, a thickened layer ii, a lamina dissecans (corresponding to the necrotized layers IV, V, and VIa), and a neuronal layer iv which corresponded to layer VIb of the intact cortex. Immunocytochemical investigation of the microgyric cortex with antibodies to neurofilament, glial fibrillary acidic protein and glutamate showed more widespread disruption of neocortical architecture than could be seen from Nissl preparations. In contrast, vasoactive intestinal peptide-containing neuronal bodies appeared to be distributed normally in the microgyric region although their processes were sometimes distorted. These results are considered in the light of previous research on induced microgyria, and possible implications for the behavioral consequences of focal, developmental neuropathologic lesions are discussed. 
5	Pharyngeal shape and dimensions in healthy subjects, snorers, and patients with obstructive sleep apnoea. To characterise the relation between pharyngeal anatomy and sleep related disordered breathing, 17 men with complaints of snoring were studied by all night polysomnography. Ten of them had obstructive sleep apnoea (mean (SD) apnoea-hypopnoea index 56.3 (41.7), age 52 (10) years, body mass index 31.4 (5.3) kg/m2); whereas seven were simple snorers (apnoea-hypopnoea index 6.7 (4.6), age 40 (17) years, body mass index 25.9 (4.3) kg/m2). The pharynx was studied by magnetic resonance imaging in all patients and in a group of eight healthy subjects (age 27 (6) years, body mass index 21.8 (2.2) kg/m2, both significantly lower than in the patients; p less than 0.05). On the midsagittal section and six transverse sections equally spaced between the nasopharynx and the hypopharynx several anatomical measurements were performed. Results showed that there was no difference between groups in most magnetic resonance imaging measurements, but that on transverse sections the pharyngeal cross section had an elliptic shape with the long axis oriented in the coronal plane in normal subjects, whereas in apnoeic and snoring patients the pharynx was circular or had an elliptic shape but with the long axis oriented in the sagittal plane. It is suggested that the change in pharyngeal cross sectional shape, secondary to a reduction in pharyngeal transverse diameter, may be related to the risk of developing sleep related disordered breathing. 
5	Typhlitis due to Balantidium coli in captive lowland gorillas. Typhlitis caused by Balantidium coli and requiring surgical resection occurred in three captive lowland gorillas over a 30-month period. Not one of the other gorillas in the colony or their keepers was ill. B. coli is distributed widely geographically and widely among mammals. Asymptomatic commensalism predominates, but invasion of the colonic mucosa can produce diarrhea and dysentery and set the stage for local or systemic spread. 
5	Open reduction and fixation of proximal humeral fractures and fracture-dislocations. Open reduction and internal fixation was employed in the treatment of 25 severely displaced fractures and fracture-dislocations of the proximal humerus. Our aims were accurate reduction and stable fixation to allow early mobilisation and to achieve full functional recovery. In 15 fractures an AO T-plate was used and in 10 a bent semitubular plate was employed as a blade plate. Excellent or satisfactory results were obtained in all six patients with two-part fractures involving the surgical neck; in four of the five patients with three-part fractures involving the surgical neck and tuberosities; in nine of the 11 patients with fracture-dislocation; and in two of the three patients with split fractures of the humeral head. Overall results were good or satisfactory in 21 of the 25 cases. Unsatisfactory results were associated with rotator cuff damage. 
2	Castor bean intoxication. We report the cases of a child who ingested two or more castor beans and two adults who each ingested four beans. All three patients developed severe gastroenteritis and recovered without sequelae after receiving IV fluids. The literature contains reports of 424 cases of castor bean intoxication. Symptoms of intoxication include acute gastroenteritis, fluid and electrolyte depletion, gastrointestinal bleeding, hemolysis, and hypoglycemia. Delayed cytotoxicity has not been reported. Of the 424 patients, 14 died (mortality rates: 8.1% of untreated and 0.4% of treated). Deaths were due to hypovolemic shock. Recommended treatment for asymptomatic patients who have chewed one or more raw beans is emergency department evaluation, gastric decontamination, administration of activated charcoal, observation until four to six hours after ingestion, and discharge instructions to return if symptoms develop. After decontamination and activated charcoal, symptomatic patients require hospitalization for treatment with IV fluids, supportive care, and monitoring for hypoglycemia, hemolysis, and complications of hypovolemia. Monitoring for delayed cytotoxicity is unnecessary. Castor beans and their dust are highly allergenic and may cause anaphylaxis. 
5	Repetitive intraoperative mapping and cryotherapy improve the results of endocardial resection for ventricular tachycardia. Patients with recurrent ventricular tachycardia or a history of a sudden cardiac death episode and ventricular tachycardia inducible in the electrophysiology laboratory have a high incidence of recurrence and a high mortality despite medical therapy. Map-guided endocardial resection has improved treatment results, but is associated with a 10-30% failure rate. In our initial experience with endocardial resection (Group I) we incurred a 30% treatment failure rate. In the present study we have found the addition of sequential intraoperative mapping and routine use of cryotherapy (Group II) improved our results of ventricular tachycardia control without significant additional morbidity or mortality. 
2	Increasing prevalence of gallstones in male veterans with alcoholic cirrhosis. Cases of alcoholic cirrhosis identified at necropsy were studied for the prevalence and type of gallstones, compared with age- and race-matched autopsy controls. Data were examined from 1970-1977 and 1980-1987. In the early sample of 460 cirrhotic patients, 33% had gallstone disease, contrasted with 12% in the controls. In the 1980s, among 299 patients, 46% had gallstone disease, whereas it was present in 13% of the controls. The prevalence of stones was significantly greater in the patients than in the controls for both time periods and, among the patients, was significantly greater in the 1980s than in the 1970s (p less than 0.05). A comparison of cirrhotic patients with and without gallstones indicated a significantly higher incidence of ascites in the patients with gallstones. The gallstones in cirrhotics were more frequently pigmented than in the controls in both time periods. In 100 living patients with advanced cirrhosis studied by sonography during 1987 and 1989, the prevalence of gallstones was 43%, almost the same as the autopsy sample from 1980-1987. In these cirrhotics, ascites, encephalopathy, and varices were more prevalent in the patients with stones than those without. We conclude that pigmented gallstones are increasing in cirrhosis of the liver related to the severity of the liver disease. 
5	Congenital dilatation of the bile duct in 100 instances and its relationship with anomalous junction [published erratum appears in Surg Gynecol Obstet 1991 Mar;172(3):246] Congenital dilatation of the bile duct (CDBD) or choledochal cyst has been demonstrated to be associated with an anomalous junction of the pancreaticobiliary ductal system. Multifarious clinical signs and symptoms of CDBD have been shown to be closely related with the presence of this anomalous junction. In the present study, 100 instances of CDBD treated surgically at our institutions during a 30 year period were classified into two types according to the morphologic features of dilatation of the bile duct; there were 77 instances of the cystic type and 23 of the cylindric type. Morphologic features of the lesion, clinical signs and symptoms and laboratory findings in these 100 instances were clinically analyzed. In almost all of the patients who were less than one year of age, the disease was of the cystic type and patients presented with either a palpable mass or jaundice as the main symptom. In patients more than one year of age, the disease was of either the cystic or cylindric type. A history of episodes of characteristic abdominal pain accompanied by elevated levels of serum amylase was present in 70 of the patients with the cystic type of disease and in all of the patients with the cylindric type. Histologic sections from the patients showed glandular formation with chronic inflammation, possibly a result of refluxed activated pancreatic juice; in contrast, histologic sections from the remaining patients of all ages showed only thickening of the fibrous layer. Thus, such variable morphologic features and clinical signs and symptoms in CDBD are highly dependent on two factors--the age at onset and the reflux of pancreatic juice into the bile duct through the common channel. 
5	Striatonigral degeneration. A clinicopathological study. The clinical and pathological features of 10 cases of striatonigral degeneration are described: 5 were misdiagnosed in life as Parkinson's disease. Retrospectively, helpful early pointers to the diagnosis in these cases included unexplained falls, autonomic dysfunction, absence of rest tremor and failure to respond to L-dopa, but these were not always present. The pathological diagnosis could not be excluded on macroscopic examination of the striatum. Relative preservation of the putamen occurred in the 4 patients who benefited from L-dopa. The caudate nucleus was involved in all cases and there was no sparing of the large striatal neurons. In mild cases, involvement of the putamen was confined to its posterior two-thirds, dorsolaterally. With increasing severity this extended in a dorsal to ventral and posterior to anterior direction. Seven of the cases had evidence of olivopontocerebellar damage, but only 2 of these had clinical evidence of cerebellar disease. Correlation was found between the neuronal counts in caudate:putamen, striatum:nigra compacta, globus pallidus:nigra compacta, nigra compacta:locus coeruleus. The most severely involved part of the substantia nigra pars compacta was the ventrolateral zone, which projects to the dorsal putamen, the earliest site of striatal disease. 
2	Gastric emptying in infants and children: limited utility of 1-hour measurement. Gastric emptying measurements were performed in infants and children at 1 and 2 hours after a liquid feeding. The 1-hour measurements were predictive of only 58% of the variability in the 2-hour measurements, indicating that the 1-hour measurement was not a good predictor of the 2-hour measurement. Gastric emptying measurements in children should be continued until 2 hours after feeding unless rapid emptying is observed during the 1st hour of the study. 
5	Anxiety and depression in patients with chronic urticaria and generalized pruritus. Thirty-four dermatology out-patients with chronic idiopathic urticaria and 34 with idiopathic generalized pruritus were investigated using standardized self-assessment psychological questionnaires to determine the incidence of significant symptoms of depression and anxiety. These patients were compared with age- and sex-matched but otherwise unselected general dermatology out-patients. Using the Beck depression inventory, significantly more patients with generalized pruritus (32.4%) had depressive symptomatology (score greater than 14) than controls (13.2%, P less than 0.05). Although more patients with chronic urticaria had depressive symptomatology (14.7%) than controls (4.4%), the difference was not statistically significant. Using the Speilberger state-trait anxiety inventory there were no significant differences between the patients with pruritus or urticaria and their controls with respect to state or trait anxiety scores above the upper 90% probability limit for the general population. Thus, significant depression may be expected in a substantial proportion of patients with idiopathic generalized pruritus but in a relatively small proportion of those with chronic urticaria. 
1	Fungal brain abscesses (aspergillosis/mucormycosis) in two immunosuppressed patients. Although the mortality rate for fungal brain abscesses in immunosuppressed patients remains unacceptably high, this figure may be reduced if computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging scans are performed more promptly in susceptible individuals with seemingly mild intracranial complaints. Earlier presumptive amphotericin B treatment and more timely surgical debridement may minimize neurological injury and enhance survival. These assumptions were only tentatively supported by the clinical courses of two patients, one an alert patient with promyelocytic leukemia and an aspergillosis brain abscess who survived, and the other, a comatose intravenous drug abuser with mucormycosis who died. 
5	The VER as a diagnostic marker for childhood abdominal migraine. Abdominal migraine is a common childhood migraine equivalent, for which diagnostic criteria have not been defined. As in other children with migraine equivalents this leads to difficulties in diagnosis and determination of prevalence. By recording the fast wave activity (beta rhythmn) in the visual evoked response (VER) to red and white flash, the pattern stimulation, 27 out of 28 children with clinically diagnosed abdominal migraine revealed significant differences compared with normal controls, outside the attack phase. Comparisons with children diagnosed as migraine with or without aura revealed, from the VER findings of higher amplitude fast wave activity and the presence of paroxysmal sharp wave activity, that abdominal migraine appears to be a specific form of childhood migraine. We found that both clinically and electrophysiologically, abdominal migraine changes with age; older children exhibiting a shorter duration of abdominal pain during attacks, and less evidence of sharp wave activity in the VER. 
1	The use of molecular probes to distinguish new primary tumors from recurrent tumors in gynecologic malignancies. This is the first report using DNA molecular probe technology to distinguish between recurrent tumor and a second primary malignancy in a patient. Tumor DNA was extracted from squamous cell carcinoma of the cervix at the time of radical hysterectomy. Eighteen months later a squamous cell cancer was found in a vaginal apex biopsy from which DNA was extracted. Tumor DNA from both lesions was subjected to restriction enzyme digestion and DNA molecular hybridization with human papillomavirus (HPV) probes. Although both lesions were positive for HPV 16, their respective restriction enzyme patterns had different HPV genetic arrangements, thereby demonstrating their distinctness. 
5	Preoperative superselective arteriolar embolization: a new approach to enhance resectability of spinal tumors. The extent of surgical resection of spinal tumors is frequently limited by blood loss and technical difficulty associated with the vascularity of the tumors. We report here the use of superselective percutaneous arterial embolization to reduce the rate of blood loss at the time of surgical resection and enhance resectability. The types of tumors treated were metastatic renal carcinoma, metastatic thyroid carcinoma, metastatic melanoma, and giant cell tumor of the sacrum. Two of the patients required repeated embolization and surgery for recurrent symptoms. The estimated blood loss in seven of nine procedures performed on the six patients ranged from 300 to 800 ml, after which no transfusion was required. In two procedures, extensive resection of very large tumors resulted in larger losses of blood, and postoperative transfusion was necessary. No significant complications of embolization or surgery occurred. A key factor in our embolization technique is the use of microfibrillar collagen, which allows occlusion of tumor vessels as small as 20 microns and may prevent reconstitution of the embolized vessels by collateral flow. We conclude that preoperative arterial embolization enhances the resectability of a variety of spinal tumors by reducing intraoperative blood loss. This may provide an additional benefit by reducing the risk related to postoperative transfusion. By permitting a more aggressive surgical approach, the use of preoperative embolization also has the potential to improve outcome in patients with spinal tumors. 
1	Surgical approach to the retrocrural lymph nodes. Removal of retrocrural lymph nodes requires an approach other than the infradiaphragmatic retroperitoneal access generally used in the surgical management of testicular tumours. The transperitoneal route given access, at best, to the origin of the superior mesenteric artery, but advanced testicular tumours occasionally require retrocrural node dissection. We describe a useful surgical approach to these nodes and the underlying anatomy. 
3	Fulminant hepatitis B: induction by hepatitis B virus mutants defective in the precore region and incapable of encoding e antigen. Clones of hepatitis B virus were propagated from 10 cases of fulminant hepatitis B after amplification by polymerase chain reaction and their nucleotide sequences of the precore region were determined. All 113 clones from 9 cases had a point mutation from guanine to adenine at nucleotide 83 in the precore region, which converted codon 28 for tryptophan (TGG) to a stop codon (TAG) and prohibited the synthesis and secretion of hepatitis B e antigen. Precore-region defects were not detected in any of 23 clones from the remaining 1 case. By contrast, precore-region defects were not found in any of 180 clones from 8 cases of acute hepatitis B without hepatic failure serving as controls. The source of infection was traceable in 3 cases. The same precore-region defect, along with the sequence identity of 435 nucleotides, was observed in clones from the case of a baby and his grandmother, who carried the virus and was implicated in the transmission, and also in clones from two pediatricians and the carrier patients they attended. These findings support the hypothesis that precore-defective mutants have stronger activity to induce fulminant hepatitis than nondefective viruses. 
2	Abnormal cardiac sensitivity in patients with chest pain and normal coronary arteries. The causes of chest pain in patients found to have angiographically normal coronary arteries during cardiac catheterization remain controversial. Cardiac sensitivity to catheter manipulation, pacing at various stimulus intensities and intracoronary injection of contrast medium was examined in several groups of patients who underwent cardiac catheterization. Right heart (especially right ventricular) catheter manipulation and pacing and intracoronary contrast medium provoked chest pain typical of that previously experienced in 29 (81%) of 36 patients with chest pain and angiographically normal coronary arteries and 15 (46%) of 33 symptomatic patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. In contrast, only 2 (6%) of 33 symptomatic patients with coronary artery disease experienced their typical chest pain with these sensitivity tests (p less than 0.001). None of 10 patients with valvular heart disease but without a chest pain syndrome experienced any sensation with these tests. Cutaneous pain threshold testing demonstrated that patients with chest pain and normal coronary arteries had a higher pain threshold to thermal stimulation compared with patients who had coronary artery disease or hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. No relation existed between cardiac sensitivity and cutaneous sensitivity testing. Thus, patients who have chest pain despite angiographically normal coronary arteries may have abnormal cardiac sensitivity to a variety of stimuli. This increased sensitivity may be of causal importance to their chest pain syndrome or may contribute to their perception of ischemia-induced pain. The same phenomenon was also commonly seen in symptomatic patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. Whether this phenomenon represents abnormal activation of pain receptors within the heart or abnormal processing of visceral afferent neural impulses in the peripheral or central nervous system is unknown. 
5	Follow-up status of patients with angiographically normal coronary arteries and panic disorder. Cardiology patients with normal coronary angiography demonstrate continuing and substantial social, health, and work disability. We hypothesized that the diagnosis of panic disorder would mark those for whom continuing disability is most likely. We interviewed 72 such patients at the time of their normal angiogram, and then again an average of 38 months later. Those with panic disorder (n = 36) demonstrated significantly more disability at follow-up than did the other study patients. We conclude that those patients with normal angiograms who have panic disorder are more disabled than those who do not have panic disorder. Panic disorder in psychiatric samples has been shown to be highly treatable. Therefore, early identification and treatment of panic disorder in this group is likely to minimize the suffering associated with this condition. 
5	Cofactors in male-female sexual transmission of human immunodeficiency virus type 1. In a study of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1)-uninfected African prostitutes, 83 (67%) of 124 seroconverted to HIV-1. Oral contraceptive use (odds ratio [OR], 3.1; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.1-8.6; P less than .03), genital ulcers (mean annual episodes, 1.32 +/- 0.55 in seroconverting women vs. 0.48 +/- 0.21 in seronegative women; P less than .02) and Chlamydia trachomatis infections (OR, 3.6; CI, 1.3-11.0; P less than .02) were associated with increased risk of HIV-1 infection. Condom use reduced the risk of HIV-1 infection (OR, 0.11; CI, 0.05-0.27; P less than .0001). Stepwise logistic regression analysis confirmed independent associations between HIV-1 infection and oral contraceptive use, condom use, genital ulcers, and C. trachomatis. The presence of other sexually transmitted diseases may in part explain the heterosexual HIV-1 epidemic in Africa and may represent important targets for intervention to control HIV-1 infection. 
1	Effective ultraviolet irradiation of platelet concentrates in teflon bags. Several plastic materials used in blood storage were evaluated for their ability to transmit ultraviolet B (UVB) light. A plastic bag manufactured from sheets of transparent Teflon efficiently (78-86%) transmitted UVB light and was employed in subsequent functional studies of lymphocytes and platelets exposed to UVB light while contained in these bags. In vitro experiments showed a UVB dose-dependent abrogation of lymphocyte responder and stimulator functions, with concurrent preservation of platelet aggregation responses. In a phase I pilot study, UVB-treated platelet concentrates were administered to four bone marrow transplant recipients. Adverse effects attributable to the transfusions were not observed, and patients showed clinically effective transfusion responses. No patient developed lymphocytotoxic HLA or platelet antibodies. These studies suggest that platelets can be effectively irradiated with UVB light in a closed system. However, numerous variables, including container material, volume and composition of contents, steady exposure versus agitation, and exact UV wavelength, must be considered. 
5	Blue rubber bleb nevus syndrome with oral hemangiomas. A case of blue rubber bleb nevus syndrome with oral hemangiomas is reported. Attention is directed to this syndrome because, although rare, it is usually associated with oral lesions. The blue rubber bleb nevus syndrome should always be considered a possibility in patients with oral hemangiomas and bluish skin nodules. 
2	Esophageal motility in children with Hirschsprung's disease. Esophageal motility was studied in 12 children with Hirschsprung's disease to see if extracolonic motor dysfunction was present in this disorder. Manometric tracings were compared with those from eight children with idiopathic megacolon and from 10 children without esophageal disease or constipation. Amplitude of esophageal contraction waves was significantly higher in children with Hirschsprung's disease than in the other two groups. Swallows that were followed by simultaneous contractions or double-peaked waves were also more common in the group with Hirschsprung's disease (subjects with Hirschsprung's disease, subjects with megacolon, and controls; 57%, 10%, and 8%, respectively). Lower esophageal sphincter characteristics did not differ among the three groups. The increase in simultaneous contractions and double-peaked waves persisted in those children who were reexamined following surgery for Hirschsprung's disease, whereas wave amplitudes fell to a level similar to that observed in the other groups. These data suggest that gastrointestinal motor dysfunction in persons with Hirschsprung's disease is not restricted to the colon, and that some of the observed abnormalities in esophageal motility do not reflect nonspecific responses to megacolon or colonic obstruction. 
4	Late results of 200 repeat coronary artery bypass operations. To determine the clinical outcome and the long-term results of a second coronary artery bypass operation, we studied preoperative clinical status and catheterization data in 200 consecutive patients over a 9-year period (1979 to 1987) (mean follow up time 34 months, maximum 120). The study group included 169 men and 31 women (mean age 58.4 years [7% greater than 70 years]). Sixty-four percent of patients had severe angina (New York Heart Association class IV), 70% had 3-vessel coronary artery disease and 21% had poor left ventricular function. Reoperation was performed after a mean interval of 58 months after the first procedure. A mean of 3.3 distal anastomoses was placed. The operative mortality rate (30 days) was 7.5%, with additional cardiac morbidity (myocardial infarction, heart failure) in 11.5% of patients. Multivariate analysis showed an increased risk in women (risk ratio 3.6) and in patients with poor left ventricular function (risk ratio 3.1). The cumulative 5-year survival rate was estimated at 84%, with a rate of 77% for patients with poor left ventricular function (difference not significant). The probability of remaining free of a cardiac-related event (myocardial infarction, angioplasty, third operation, cardiac death) was 64% for 5 years. At the end of follow-up, 79% of the surviving patients were in New York Heart Association class I or II and nearly 50% of patients in the fifth year after the reoperation had good functional status. It is concluded that a reoperation is effective but carries an increased, immediate, operative risk. 
5	Crohn's disease of the lung Two years after developing colonic Crohn's disease, a 17 year old boy presented with focal pulmonary consolidation. A lung biopsy specimen showed areas of non-caseating epithelioid granuloma. Although some respiratory abnormalities appear to be associated with inflammatory bowel disease, granulomatous disease affecting the lung has not previously been reported in a child. 
1	Ki-67 immunostaining in human breast tumors and its relationship to prognosis. Ki-67 labeling was quantified in 37 nonmalignant breast tissues and in 63 breast carcinomas by counting ten random high-power fields each in three section planes (RC) or by evaluation of the area with the highest labeling density (HDC). Both procedures proved to be highly correlated (rs = 0.94). Ki-67-positive fractions of the nonmalignant tissues (mean, 2.1% for RC and 4.1% for HDC) were significantly lower as compared with the carcinomas (mean, 14.5% for RC and 17.5% for HDC). In carcinomas the Ki-67 labeling was significantly associated with pT stage, axillary lymph node status, and tumor grading and inversely related to progesterone receptor status. Using the medians of both counting methods (12% for RC and 17% for HDC) as cutoff points, significantly different curves for overall and disease-free survival (median follow-up, 37 months) were obtained. However, Cox multivariate analysis failed to demonstrate an independent effect of Ki-67 labeling. In contrast, Ki-67 reactivity seems to be of independent prognostic value if a higher cutoff level was selected. 
4	Involvement of thromboxane and neutrophils in multiple-system organ edema with interleukin-2. Interleukin-2 (IL-2) produces toxicity characterized by generalized edema within 24 hours. This study tests whether the rate of IL-2 administration modulates the onset of edema and examines thromboxane (Tx) and neutrophils as possible mediators of this event. Recombinant human IL-2, 10(5) U (n = 7), 10(6) U (n = 9), or vehicle (n = 8) were given to anesthetized rats intravenously during a period of 1 hour. At 6 hours edema, as measured by increase in wet to dry weight (w/d) ratio, was present in the heart, liver, and kidney, with 10(5) U IL-2 and in the lung, heart, liver and kidney, with 10(6) U IL-2, relative to values with vehicle-infused controls (all p less than 0.05). With a 1-hour infusion of 10(6) U IL-2, there was an increase in plasma thromboxane (Tx)B2 level to 1290 +/- 245 pg/mL, higher than 481 +/- 93 pg/mL in control rats (p less than 0.05); lung polymorphonuclear leukocyte (PMN) sequestration of 53 +/- 7 PMN/10 higher-power fields (HPF) relative to 23 +/- 2 PMN/10 HPF in controls (p less than 0.05); and increased bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid protein concentration of 1970 +/- 210 micrograms/mL relative to 460 micrograms/mL in controls (p less than 0.05). When 10(6) U IL-2 was given as a 1-minute intravenous bolus (n = 9), edema was not demonstrated, plasma TxB2 levels were similar to controls, there was no leukosequestration, and BAL protein levels were normal. These data indicate that a constant infusion but not the rapid bolus administration of IL-2 produces in rats multiple-system organ edema, increased plasma TxB2, sequestration of PMNs, and microvascular permeability. These findings may explain the early toxicity seen in patients given high-dose IL-2 in cancer treatment. 
4	Diagnosis and management of familial dyslipoproteinemia in children and adolescents. CAD results from atherosclerosis, a chronic disease process that has its origin in childhood. Children and adolescents can be at higher risk for CAD by virtue of being from families with premature CAD or familial dyslipoproteinemias. The plasma lipid and lipoprotein levels result from a number of complex metabolic processes that are under the control of genetic and environmental (e.g., diet) influences. The normal ranges of plasma lipids and lipoproteins in children are known, and children and adolescents with dyslipoproteinemia are ordinarily defined as those having levels of plasma total, LDL, or triglyceride above the 95th percentile or with a low HDL cholesterol below the 5th percentile. Children of a parent with documented dyslipoproteinemia or with family history of premature CAD may be screened in the fasting state any time after 2 years of age. Following the exclusion of secondary causes of dyslipoproteinemia, the diagnosis of primary dyslipoproteinemia can be made. Lipoprotein patterns are not diagnostic for a given genotype. Efforts to determine further the biochemical defects responsible for a given phenotype have led to the investigation of gene coding for the apolipoproteins, the key enzymes in the lipoproteins pathways (LPL, HDL, and LCAT) and the receptors that process lipoproteins, such as the LDL receptor and the chylomicron remnant receptor. From a practical standpoint, the diagnosis of the kind of dyslipoproteinemia in a child will depend upon the nature and severity of the dyslipoproteinemia, both in the child (or adolescent) and in parents and siblings. Marked increases in plasma total and LDL cholesterol in the child and in at least one of the parents often reflect the presence of familial hypercholesterolemia, an inherited dominant condition due to a defect in the LDL receptor gene. The triglyceride levels are often normal. If the child has a different dyslipoproteinemia pattern from siblings and parents, then the diagnosis of familial combined hyperlipidemia or hyperapobetalipoproteinemia should be considered. Most children with mild or borderline elevations in total and LDL cholesterol will have polygenic hypercholesterolemia. Triglyceride problems in children and adolescents are relatively uncommon, particularly the more severe hypertriglyceridemia such as that found in lipoprotein lipase and apoC-II deficiency, dysbetalipoproteinemia, and type V hyperlipoproteinemia. High levels of Lp(a) lipoprotein, in isolation or in combination with other dyslipoproteinemia, accelerate risk for CAD. Low levels of HDL cholesterol in the absence of other abnormalities suggest the diagnosis of hypoalphalipoproteinemia.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS). 
3	IgM deposits at nodes of Ranvier in a patient with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, anti-GM1 antibodies, and multifocal motor conduction block. We studied a patient with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, multifocal motor conduction block, and IgM anti-GM1 antibodies. A sural nerve biopsy demonstrated deposits of IgM at nodes of Ranvier by direct immunofluorescence. The deposits were granular and located in the nodal gap between adjacent myelin internodes, and in some instances, they extended along the surface of the paranodal myelin sheath. When injected into rat sciatic nerve, the serum IgM bound to the nodes of Ranvier, and the binding activity was removed by preincubation with GM1. These observations suggest that anti-GM1 antibodies may have caused motor dysfunction by binding to the nodal and paranodal regions of peripheral nerve. 
1	Patterns of growth and metastases of induced pancreatic cancer in relation to the prognosis and its clinical implications. To understand high malignancy of pancreatic cancer, the growth and metastatic patterns of pancreatic cancer induced in Syrian hamsters were examined. In this model, induced tumors resemble the human disease morphologically, clinically, biologically, and immunologically. In the current study, primary-induced cancer and transplants of pancreatic cancer cell line (PC-1) into the SC tissue or pancreas of homologous hosts were used. In the primary-induced pancreatic cancer, perineural invasion was the most common path (88%), followed by lymphogenic (31%) or vascular (2%) metastases. Inoculation of PC-1 cells into the pancreas resulted in 100% tumor take within 3 weeks. Of 19 intrapancreatic allografts, all showed peritoneal invasion, 5 (26%) liver metastases, 3 (16%) lymph node metastases, 17 (89%) perineural invasion, and none vascular invasion. Even microscopic tumors were found to metastasize primarily via perineural spaces. It was also demonstrated, for the first time, that cancer cells take this route to reach distant tissues, including the lymph nodes. Intraductal spreading occurred in both primary cancers and intrapancreatic allografts either continuously or discontinuously. The patterns of discontinuous intraductal tumor expansion imitated tumor multicentricity. Although perineural invasion was the most common feature of primary cancer and intrapancreatic allografts, lymphatic, hepatic, and vascular invasion and metastases usually occurred in advanced cases. Environmental factors seem to influence expansion and metastases, as evidenced by differences in growth and in metastatic patterns between SC and intrapancreatic allografts. 
4	Unusual aspects of aortovenous fistulas associated with ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysms. Three unusual cases of an abdominal aortic aneurysm spontaneously rupturing into the retroperitoneum and an adherent posterior vein are reported. No patient demonstrated signs or symptoms of an aortovenous fistula before surgery. Emergent surgery prevented extensive preoperative diagnostic testing. The three abdominal aortic aneurysms were very large and averaged 13 cm in diameter. One fistula involved an inflammatory aneurysm, which is the fifth such case reported. The aortic fistulas were to the inferior vena cava (158 other cases reported in the English-language literature), a left renal vein (16 other cases reported), and an iliac vein (7 other cases reported). Routine use of the cell-saver, oversewing of the fistula from within the aneurysm, and a heightened awareness that this unusual complication is more common in the presence of a very large, ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm should improve survival. 
5	Persistent rectal ulcer associated with human papillomavirus type 33 in a patient with AIDS: successful treatment with isotretinoin. Rectal dysplasia and carcinoma associated with human papillomavirus infection are increasing in prevalence among homosexual men, particularly those infected with the human immunodeficiency virus. We report a case involving a 39-year-old homosexual man with AIDS who developed a persistent rectal ulcer. A biopsy of the ulcer revealed severe squamous dysplasia, and human papillomavirus type 33 was detected in rectal tissue with use of in situ DNA hybridization. This genotype of virus has not been previously associated with anal or rectal dysplasia in homosexual men, including those infected with the human immunodeficiency virus. The rectal ulcer resolved after 2 months of oral therapy with 60 mg/d of isotretinoin, a retinoid. 
3	Paraesthesiae and tetany induced by voluntary hyperventilation. Increased excitability of human cutaneous and motor axons. Anxiety can induce hyperventilation, and the resultant hypocapnia and hypocalcaemia can lead to paraesthesiae and tetany. To define the nature of the disturbance created in peripheral nerve, the excitability of cutaneous and motor axons was monitored in 6 normal subjects requested to hyperventilate until paraesthesiae developed in the hands, face and trunk. This occurred when alveolar PCO2 (PACO2) had declined on average by 20 mmHg. Spontaneous EMG activity developed when PACO2 had declined by a further 4 mmHg. Changes in the excitability of cutaneous and motor axons were measured from changes in the compound action potentials evoked by stimulation of the median nerve at the wrist and recorded over the digital nerves of the index finger and over the thenar muscles, respectively. As PACO2 declined, the size of the compound sensory and muscle potentials evoked by a constant stimulus progressively increased, indicating an increase in axonal excitability. These changes occurred before paraesthesiae or tetany developed. In each subject there was a statistically significant inverse correlation between PACO2 and axonal excitability. Independent of this increase in axonal excitability, there was no significant change in the supernormal phase of the recovery cycle of cutaneous axons. Microneurographic recordings from the median nerve in 2 subjects revealed spontaneous bursting activity of cutaneous axons, perceived as paraesthesiae. It is concluded that the paraesthesiae and tetany induced by hyperventilation result solely from changes in the excitability of cutaneous and motor axons in the peripheral nerve, presumably due to an alteration in the electrical properties of the axonal membrane resulting from a reduced plasma [Ca2+]. The supernormal phase may entrain the ectopic discharge and thereby determine the maximal discharge frequency of impulses in ectopically generated trains, but does not otherwise contribute to the physiological disturbance. 
2	Gastric injury and invasion of parietal cells by spiral bacteria in rhesus monkeys. Are gastritis and hyperchlorhydria infectious diseases? The possibility of using the rhesus monkey as a model for studying gastric function in the presence of infection with spiral bacteria was studied. Endoscopic evaluation of the gastric mucosa was performed under general anesthesia in 29 colony-bred rhesus monkeys, and gastric pinch biopsy specimens were obtained from each animal. On a separate day, gastric emptying and acid output were determined using a 99mTc dilution technique. Biopsy samples were fixed for light microscopy (H&E, Gram, and Warthin-Starry stains) and for transmission electron microscopy. The presence of spiral bacteria and gastritis was assessed and rated on coded slides. In 8 of 29 monkeys, Helicobacter pylori-like organisms were observed in close proximity to the mucosal epithelial cells or in the lumen of the gastric pits. In 14 other monkeys, "Gastrospirillum hominis"-like organisms were observed in the mucus covering the surface of epithelial cells, in the lumina of the gastric glands, and overlying parietal cells. Gastritis was present in 8 of 8 animals positive for H. pylori-like organisms, in 2 of 14 animals positive for "G. hominis"-like organisms, and in none of the uninfected monkeys, and the mean gastritis index was significantly greater in animals positive for H. pylori-like organisms. Moreover, acid output was significantly higher in monkeys positive for "G. hominis"-like organisms than in controls or animals positive for H. pylori-like organisms. Gastric emptying was not significantly different in the three groups. In conclusion, (a) H. pylori-like, but not "G. hominis"-like, organisms cause gastritis while not modifying acid output; (b) "G. hominis"-like, but not H. pylori-like organisms, invade and on occasion damage parietal cells while apparently causing hyperchlorhydria; and (c) the rhesus monkey appears to be a good model for the study of gastric infection with spiral bacteria. 
5	Clinical efficacy of PTCA and identification of restenosis: evaluation by serial body surface potential mapping. We used serial body surface potential mapping (BSPM) with the departure map technique to evaluate the clinical efficacy of percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA) in various pathophysiologic stages of coronary artery disease, and to detect restenosis. The BSPM was performed prior to, 1 week after, and 1 month after PTCA. A follow-up coronary angiography was performed 3 to 6 months after PTCA, and BSPM was also performed at the same time. The results of BSPM were compared with those of thallium-201 single-photon emission computed tomography (Tl-201 SPECT) and radionuclide ventriculography. After PTCA, BSPM showed a significant reduction in the departure area, the Tl-201 SPECT also showed a significant reduction in the extent and severity scores, and the left ventricular ejection fraction improved significantly. In the cases with restenosis, the departure area, which had decreased in size after PTCA, showed an increase in size. After successful re-PTCA, the size of the departure area again became smaller. We concluded that BSPM, which is a simple, noninvasive, and inexpensive method, is useful in the evaluation of the clinical efficacy of PTCA and in the detection of restenosis after successful PTCA. 
4	Isolated pulmonary valvular regurgitation: current perspectives. IPVR is a rare clinical entity that was first diagnosed during life in 1955. In the past 35 years, only 69 patients have been reported. With increasing clinical awareness, as well as use of PDE, the confirmation of its clinical diagnosis has become easier and more accurate without having to take recourse to invasive cardiac studies as in the past. For this reason, it is becoming increasingly apparent that IPVR is not so rare as has been suggested in the past. IPVR is more common in men than in women, in whites than blacks, and in the young than the elderly. The mean age of IPVR patients is 27 years (range, 4 to 85). The majority of the patients are asymptomatic and the diagnosis is usually suspected upon the discovery of a crescendo-decrescendo, low-pitched, early to mid diastolic murmur in the second and third left intercostal space, which increases during inspiration, particularly in the presence of a hyperdynamic right ventricle and in the absence of peripheral circulatory phenomenon of aortic regurgitation. The ECG often shows right axis deviation, incomplete right bundle branch block, and rarely, right ventricular hypertrophy and strain. However, a normal ECG does not preclude its diagnosis. Approximately 30% of the IPVR patients have normal 12-lead ECGs. The diagnosis may be further suggested by the posteroanterior chest roentgenogram when dilated and large central pulmonary arteries are noted to pulsate vigorously (hilar dance) on chest fluoroscopy. 
1	Tumor of the atrioventricular nodal region. A clinical and immunohistochemical study. Autopsy specimens of 17 tumors of the atrioventricular nodal region were studied. Sudden death occurred in 14 children and adults; seven of these patients had a history of atrioventricular block or syncope. Three tumors were incidental findings in infants with other congenital anomalies; diaphragmatic agenesis, pulmonary hypoplasia, and Meckel's diverticulum in one patient; mitral atresia in one; and congenital hydrocephalus, ventricular septal defect, patent ductus arteriosus, coarctation of the aorta, and patent omphalovitelline duct in the third. Immunohistochemical stains demonstrated strong positivity for carcinoembryonic antigen in 13 of 13 cases, B72.3 antigen in 5 of 7 cases, and cytokeratin in 11 of 11 cases. Twenty control cases of mesothelioma and mesothelial hyperplasia were all negative for B72.3; one showed focal carcinoembryonic antigen staining. Ultrastructural analysis of one case demonstrated short rudimentary microvilli not characteristic of mesothelial cells. We conclude that so-called mesotheliomas of the atrioventricular nodal region are not of mesothelial origin, because of strong carcinoembryonic antigen positivity and occasional positivity with B72.3, as these antibodies react with glycoproteins found in endodermally derived tissue and generally not with mesothelial tissue. Conduction system tumors are most likely congenital rests of endodermal origin, can be associated with other congenital anomalies, and often cause symptoms of heart block and sudden death. 
3	Imaging the fetal brain in the second and third trimesters using transvaginal sonography. High-frequency transvaginal probes were used at 20-40 weeks' gestation to develop a systematic examination of the fetal brain. Modeling the procedure after the standard neonatal neurosonographic examination, we attempted to obtain three coronal sections (anterior, midline, posterior) and two sagittal sections (midsagittal, right or left parasagittal). In 70 normal patients, all planes were imaged with a similar frequency (74-76%) except for the posterior coronal plane, which was imaged 59% of the time. Among the first 35 cases, 17% had a complete study, compared with 71% of the second 35 cases. Transvaginal sonography established or changed the diagnosis in five of the 13 cases with central nervous system or other abnormalities. We recommend that a complete fetal neurosonographic examination include transvaginal sonography to complement and enhance the transabdominal examination, especially for cases in which a fetal abnormality is suspected. 
1	Efficacy and complications of radiotherapy of anterior visual pathway tumors. A progressive disturbance in visual acuity or visual field, along with an unexplained optic nerve atrophy, suggests the possibility of a tumor. Tumors that frequently affect the anterior visual pathway include primary optic nerve sheath meningiomas, intracranial meningiomas, optic gliomas, pituitary tumors, and craniopharyngiomas. The location of these tumors sometimes prohibits a complete surgical excision that might jeopardize the visual system. Radiation therapy, however, can be beneficial in these cases. This article reviews the indications for radiotherapy of tumors that involve the anterior visual pathway, along with the possible complications. Cases that present the effect of radiation therapy and radiation damage are presented. 
2	Features distinguishing secondary achalasia from primary achalasia. Eighteen patients with cancer-induced or secondary achalasia (SA) were compared to 421 patients with idiopathic or primary achalasia (PA). The aim of the study was to detect any differences in clinical presentation between the two groups. Mean age of patients with SA was 57.1 (range 15-78) and 47.1 (range 1-90) in patients with PA (p = 0.02). Three patients with SA were 15, 24, and 36 yr old, respectively. Symptom frequency was comparable in SA versus PA. Mean duration of symptoms in SA was 4.5 months, with 15 of the 18 patients experiencing symptoms for six months or less. Weight loss occurred in 88.2% of patients with SA and 57.3% of patients with PA (p less than 0.05). Cancer was at the gastroesophageal junction in 16 patients, duodenum in one, and breast in one. Endoscopy showed tumor in 12 (67%). The esophagram was suspicious for tumor in only 25%. We conclude that patients with SA are older, more likely to lose weight, and have a short duration of symptoms. However, SA may occur in younger patients, and endoscopy with biopsy is necessary in any newly diagnosed case of achalasia. 
4	Effects of mental exercise in patients with dilated cardiomyopathy and congestive heart failure. An echocardiographic Doppler study. To assess the effects of mental stress on left ventricular diastolic function in patients with congestive heart failure, nine patients aged 57 +/- 12 years with dilated cardiomyopathy (end-diastolic volume, more than 110 ml/m2; ejection fraction, less than 40%; mean, 28 +/- 8%) and congestive heart failure in New York Heart Association functional class II or III and 14 normal volunteers (mean age, 49 +/- 8 years) were studied during mental arithmetic lasting 10 minutes with echocardiographic Doppler monitoring of transmitral flow velocity. During mental arithmetic, the ratio of peak flow velocity in early versus late diastole (E/A) and deceleration time of early diastole did not change in normal controls. However, E/A increased significantly (from 1.6 +/- 1.5 to 1.9 +/- 1.7; p less than 0.01) and deceleration time markedly decreased (from 156 +/- 49 to 108 +/- 31 msec; p less than 0.001) in patients with congestive heart failure. In 16 postinfarct patients with ejection fraction of less than 40% studied during mental arithmetic with simultaneous hemodynamics and Doppler recordings, good correlations were found between pulmonary wedge pressure and Doppler parameters (wedge pressure versus E/A, r = 0.89; wedge pressure versus deceleration time, r = -0.87). During mental arithmetic, the pulmonary wedge pressure-E/A correlation was weaker (r = 0.67), whereas the correlation between pulmonary wedge pressure and deceleration time was stronger (r = 0.91). The value of 153 msec in deceleration time was the best cutoff point in predicting 12 mm Hg pulmonary wedge pressure, both at rest and during mental arithmetic: the higher the deceleration time, the lower the pulmonary wedge pressure, and vice versa. Among patients with congestive heart failure, five showed normal baseline deceleration time (195 +/- 21 msec; pattern 1), and the remaining four showed a short (less than 153 msec) deceleration time (108 +/- 13 msec; pattern 2). During mental arithmetic, deceleration time markedly decreased to as short as 119 +/- 20 msec in all patients except one with baseline pattern 1. Deceleration time further decreased to 75 +/- 6 msec in all patients with baseline pattern 2. Mental arithmetic induces changes in left ventricular diastolic function in patients with congestive heart failure. Transmitral echocardiographic Doppler provides a simple noninvasive method of estimating and monitoring pulmonary wedge pressure in patients with severe left ventricular dysfunction. 
1	Parotid gland and facial nerve trauma: a retrospective review. Included in this study are all patients with trauma to the parotid region seen at our center from 1979 to 1989. There was a total of five patients with injury to the parotid area: two patients with isolated facial nerve injury; one with isolated parotid duct injury; two with combined duct and nerve injury. There were four males and one female, with a mean age of 34 years (range, 16 to 62 years). The three patients with parotid duct injury required other procedures for associated trauma. A total of eight nerve branches were severed in four patients. Seven of the eight nerve branches (82.5%) were primarily repaired, with excellent functional results. Two of the three ductal injuries were repaired primarily over a stent, and one was ligated. No complications resulted from either treatment. Based on our clinical experience and review of the literature, we suggest that the treatment of parotid region injuries should include: 1) a complete initial assessment; 2) primary repair of parotid duct transection within 24 hours when possible; 3) primary repair of all facial nerve injuries, although delayed nerve repair remains a viable alternative; and 4) nonsurgical treatment of sialoceles and fistulae. 
5	A comparative study of terbinafine versus griseofulvin in 'dry-type' dermatophyte infections. We conducted a double-blind comparative study of terbinafine, 250 mg twice daily, versus griseofulvin, 500 mg twice daily, for 6 weeks in chronic dermatophyte infections of the feet or hands. All but three patients (total 31) had Trichophyton rubrum infection. At 12-week follow-up, 100% of the terbinafine-treated group were free from infection compared with 45% of those treated with griseofulvin. Therapy in 75% of the terbinafine-treated group and in 35% of those given griseofulvin was rated as effective overall at long-term follow-up, although these differences were not statistically significant. Six months after treatment all nine patients whose skin had cleared with terbinafine therapy remained in remission versus only one of seven patients treated with griseofulvin. None of the patients in either group experienced serious adverse effects. 
4	Serum cholesterol levels and survival in elderly hypertensive patients: analysis of data from the European Working Party on High Blood Pressure in the Elderly. The relation between serum cholesterol and mortality was investigated in 822 elderly hypertensive patients randomly assigned to treatment with diuretics, with or without methyldopa, or placebo. Cox's proportional hazards model showed that pretreatment serum total cholesterol levels were independently and inversely correlated with total mortality (p = 0.03), noncardiovascular mortality (p = 0.02), and cancer mortality (p = 0.04) during treatment. Total and noncardiovascular mortality were also negatively correlated with pretreatment hemoglobin levels and body weight. All factors being equal, an increase in total serum cholesterol of 2.3 mmol/L was associated with a one-year prolongation of survival. After adjustment for gender, age, pretreatment cardiovascular complications, and systolic pressure, the correlations between serum cholesterol and cardiovascular and cardiac mortality were not significant. 
2	Liver disease in alpha-1-antitrypsin deficiency: prognostic indicators. We reviewed the clinical presentation, subsequent course, and outcome of 98 patients with alpha 1-antitrypsin deficiency seen at our institution during the past 20 years to obtain answers to the following questions: (1) What prognostic factors aid in determining the course of liver disease in affected patients? (2) When is the appropriate time for referral to a liver transplant center? (3) Does breast-feeding prevent chronic liver disease? (4) What is the incidence of severe liver disease in family members? Our analysis revealed that the initial values of alanine aminotransferase, prothrombin time, and trypsin inhibitory capacity may have prognostic value. During clinical follow-up the recurrence or persistence of hyperbilirubinemia along with deteriorating results of coagulation studies indicated the need for liver transplantation because of imminent poor outcome. Girls had a worse prognosis than boys. Initial breast-feeding versus feeding of commercial formulas did not influence overall overcome. The incidence of significant liver disease among "at risk" siblings was 21% (3/14); if one assumes mendelian inheritance from heterozygous parents, the overall risk for siblings in our families was 5%. 
3	Telephone use to elicit voice or speech in brain injured subjects. The initiation of speech is often delayed in the early stages of recovery from a serious brain injury. We have found a high percentage of patients with both speech and swallowing problems. This makes bedside assessment of swallowing safety difficult because one cannot listen for the sound of aspirated material on the vocal cords when a patient is at high risk for silent aspiration and is often unable to cooperate with a videofluoroscopic study. The use of the telephone has been described several times for aphasia treatment, but not to elicit speech or assess swallowing safety early after brain injury. This study, therefore, recruited subjects who had brain injuries and (1) were referred early for swallowing and other evaluations, (2) were out of coma and able to follow some commands, and (3) did not initiate voice or speak when asked to. Subjects were asked three questions under two different conditions: face to face and after ringing the telephone from another room. The results were recorded on videotape and analyzed by another investigator for quantifiable differences. Six of the seven subjects responded better with the telephone stimulus than without. This technique may elicit voice or speech early after brain injury in some patients and may be useful in bedside assessment of swallowing safety. It may also serve as an example of appropriate stimulation of brain injured subjects coming out of coma. 
3	Traumatic intracranial aneurysms caused by missiles: their presentation and management. Only 30 cases of traumatic intracranial aneurysm (TICA) secondary to missile injury have been reported to date. To these we add 15 more cases. Missile TICAs are often seen on a secondary branch of the middle cerebral artery and are usually accompanied by a intracerebral hematoma (80%) or by an acute subdural hematoma (26%). Fourteen of our cases were secondary to shrapnel injuries and only one was secondary to a bullet. None of the injuries was through-and-through. TICAs may enlarge in time and, seemingly inoffensive, may rupture and lead to death. All seven TICAs studied histologically proved to be false aneurysms. TICAs are best treated through trapping and excision. The outcome depends on the patient's status and level of consciousness before surgery. Indications for angiography are discussed. 
5	Enlarged cisterna magna and the Dandy-Walker malformation: factors associated with chromosome abnormalities. Thirty-three fetuses with an enlarged cisterna magna (10 mm or more) were evaluated to determine factors that might be associated with an underlying chromosome abnormality. Eighteen fetuses (55%) proved to have a chromosome abnormality, including trisomy 18 or trisomy 18 variant (12), trisomy 13 (three), Turner syndrome (one), or other rearrangements (two). Among various risk factors analyzed, the absence of ventricular dilatation correlated most strongly with a chromosome abnormality. Chromosome abnormalities were found in 17 of 22 fetuses (77%) lacking ventricular dilatation, compared with only one of 11 fetuses (9%) with ventricular dilatation (P less than .001). Other factors statistically associated (P less than .01) with an underlying chromosome abnormality included mild enlargement of the cisterna magna (10-14 mm), concurrent anomalies detected sonographically, and fetal growth retardation. However, stepwise logistic regression showed that only the absence of ventricular dilatation and the presence of concurrent anomalies were significant when multiple factors were evaluated. These observations support the utility of evaluating the cisterna magna as part of a routine anatomical survey. 
5	Endometrial ablation for the treatment of menorrhagia: a comparison of patients with normal, enlarged, and fibroid uteri. One hundred sixty-one patients underwent endometrial ablation with the Nd:YAG laser for the treatment of refractory menorrhagia. Patients were divided into one of three groups: those with a normal-sized uterus; those with an enlarged uterus (greater than 10 cm); and those with uterine fibroids, which had been documented clinically, ultrasonographically, or by a combination of hysteroscopy and laparoscopy or by one or the other. All patients were considered candidates for hysterectomy. Both preoperatively and postoperatively, patients monitored their menstrual cycles and evaluated their flow according to predetermined categories of amenorrhea, light flow, normal flow, heavy flow, and severe flow. After treatment, 68% of patients with normal-sized uterus and 91% of patients with an enlarged uterus (greater than 10 cm) and 88% of patients with uterine fibroids became amenorrheic or had light flow. None of the patients in this last group have had to undergo hysterectomy. This study indicates that the patient with an enlarged or fibroid uterus may not have contraindications for endometrial ablation. Endometrial ablation may be effective in at least temporarily controlling bleeding in those patients with enlarged or myomatous uterus. 
5	Effects of diltiazem on complications and restenosis after coronary angioplasty. A randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blinded trial was performed to evaluate the usefulness of empiric therapy with a calcium antagonist in patients who undergo coronary angioplasty. A total of 201 patients were randomized to placebo or to high-dose diltiazem (mean dose, 329 mg/day). Treatment began 24 hours before angioplasty. Restenosis was assessed by percent area stenosis as determined by quantitative angiographic techniques before, immediately and 1 year after angioplasty. All patients also received aspirin and dipyridamole before angioplasty. Heparin and verapamil were administered intravenously during the procedure. The 2 groups were similar with respect to age, extent of coronary artery disease, smoking history, and baseline lipid levels. Procedural complications, including death (1 vs 1), Q-wave infarction (0 vs 3), acute occlusion (5 vs 5) and focal spasm (0 vs 0), were not significantly different in the diltiazem and placebo patients, respectively. Freedom from all acute complications was noted in 85% of patients in both groups. One-year angiographic follow-up was obtained in 60% of patients. Restenosis rates were similar: 36% in the diltiazem group and 32% in the placebo group (p = 0.30). The incidence of late cardiac events (death, Q-wave myocardial infarction, recurrent angina or coronary bypass graft surgery) was similar in the 2 groups. Thus, diltiazem did not influence the overall restenosis rate or prevent late events after coronary angioplasty. 
5	Use of recombinant human erythropoietin (r-HuEPO) in a Jehovah's Witness refusing transfusion of blood products: case report. Recombinant human erythropoietin (r-HuEPO) administration to a Jehovah's witness refusing blood transfusions increased her nadir packed cell volume from 13% to 37% and reticulocyte count from 2% to 17.7%. R-HuEPO may provide an alternative safe and effective therapy in life-threatening anemia when blood transfusions are unacceptable to the patient. 
2	High ethanol consumption as risk factor for intracerebral hemorrhage in young and middle-aged people. We examined the prevalence of high ethanol intake, hypertension, and other risk factors for intracerebral hemorrhage in a case-control study of 24 young and middle-aged patients with intracerebral hemorrhage. We recorded ethanol consumption, history of hypertension, liver disease, cigarette smoking, and mild or severe coagulation disorder in each case of intracerebral hemorrhage and in 48 control patients matched by sex and age. In univariate matched analyses, the frequencies of high ethanol intake (p = 0.009), hypertension (p = 0.05), and coagulation disorder (p = 0.05) were higher in the cases than in the controls. After controlling for possible confounding factors, we found that high ethanol intake and hypertension were the only independent risk factors for intracerebral hemorrhage (p = 0.02 and p = 0.05, respectively). The hemorrhagic lesion found in cases with a high ethanol intake tended to be located in the cerebral lobes (p = 0.01), contrasting with the typical basal ganglia location of hypertensive hematomas (p = 0.009). We conclude that chronic, high ethanol intake should be considered as an important risk factor for lobar hematomas in young and middle-aged people. 
4	Parental history is an independent risk factor for coronary artery disease: the Framingham Study. Family history of CAD, defined as parental death by CAD, was found to be a significant independent predictor of CAD in a logistic regression model controlling for standard risk factors and length of follow-up among the 5209 participants in the Framingham Study. Persons with a positive parental history have a 29% increased risk of CAD, and the strength of the association between parental history and CAD is similar to that found for other standard risk factors such as systolic blood pressure, cholesterol level, and cigarette smoking. No evidence was found that persons with a family history of CAD have a decreased capacity to cope with the deleterious effects of known risk factors; that is, no significant interaction was found between any of the risk factors and parental history of CAD. Among men with low risk for CAD by risk-factor profile (i.e., nonsmoking, thin, nonhypertensive persons), more than two thirds of those who experience CAD have a positive parental history. This study suggests that CAD among persons who are predicted to be at low risk by standard risk factors may have a substantial genetic component and that the risk associated with parental history may not be reduced by modification of these factors. Nevertheless, among persons with a positive family history, those with a favorable risk profile are at substantially less risk for CAD than those with an unfavorable risk profile. 
3	Use of neuroleptic-induced extrapyramidal symptoms to predict future vulnerability to side effects. OBJECTIVE: Susceptibility to neuroleptic-induced extrapyramidal syndromes varies widely, even within age and sex subgroups. Individual vulnerability to extrapyramidal syndromes has been assumed to explain this, but the utility of past history for predicting future occurrence of extrapyramidal syndromes has not been studied extensively. This investigation was undertaken to determine whether patients' previous histories of extrapyramidal syndromes predict future episodes of extrapyramidal syndromes and to compare the importance of this predictive factor with patient age, sex, neuroleptic dose, and anticholinergic dose as predictors of extrapyramidal syndromes. METHODS: The charts of 62 schizophrenic patients with multiple neuroleptic treatment episodes were reviewed. Extrapyramidal syndromes, neuroleptic drug doses, and anticholinergic drug doses during the first 21 days of each treatment episode were recorded. RESULTS: Previous extrapyramidal syndromes correctly predicted extrapyramidal syndromes in subsequent treatments for 84% of the patients. Variations in neuroleptic potency, neuroleptic dose, and anticholinergic dose partially explained incorrect predictions. CONCLUSIONS: These results support the hypothesis that patients with a history of extrapyramidal syndromes are at greater risk for future extrapyramidal syndromes. If confirmed, these results strongly support individual susceptibility as a major predictor of extrapyramidal syndromes and indicate that prophylaxis of extrapyramidal syndromes should be considered for patients who have previously suffered extrapyramidal syndromes from similarly prescribed neuroleptic therapy. 
5	A phase II study of combined methotrexate and teniposide infusions prior to reinduction therapy in relapsed childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia: a Pediatric Oncology Group study. Teniposide (VM-26) can increase intracellular methotrexate (MTX) and its polyglutamate derivatives in vitro and thus has the potential to improve the therapeutic index of regimens containing MTX. In this phase II study, children and adolescents with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) in first or second marrow relapse were randomly assigned to receive either simultaneous (n = 11) or sequential (n = 12) continuous infusions of MTX and VM-26 prior to reinduction. Infusions of VM-26 were begun 12 hours after completion of MTX infusion in the sequential group. Dosages were individually adjusted to maintain plasma concentration levels of 10 microns for MTX and 15 microns for VM-26; total infusion times were 24 and 72 hours, respectively. Significant toxicity in the first six patients who received the scheduled 72-hour VM-26 infusion (including one drug-related death) prompted a 50% reduction in infusion duration. The reduced dose was associated with similar but more manageable toxicity. Examination of bone marrow aspirates 10 days after therapy was begun showed one complete and two partial marrow remissions; a fourth patient who had an aplastic marrow on day 10 received no further chemotherapy and had a complete remission (CR) documented on day 31. There was no obvious clinical advantage associated with either infusion schedule, although small sample sizes preclude definitive conclusions. The 17% response rate to the MTX/VM-26 therapeutic window in patients with refractory disease suggests the need for further investigation to evaluate alternative schedules and concomitant therapy for this drug combination. 
4	Abdominal aortic aneurysm: results of a family study. Data pertaining to abdominal aortic aneurysm among first-degree relatives of 91 patients with abdominal aortic aneurysm are presented. The percentage of families with at least one affected first-degree relative of the proband (multiplex families) was 15.4%. In 21.4% of multiplex families parent-offspring transmission of abdominal aortic aneurysm was noted; in the remaining families only siblings were affected. The mean age at onset among probands was 67.3 years; that among all affected was 67.4 years. No statistically significant difference in the mean ages at onset between genders was noted. Among affected siblings of probands, the sex ratio, male:female, was 1.33:1, which is not significantly different from 1:1. The relative risk of developing an abdominal aortic aneurysm was 3.97 for fathers, 4.03 for mothers, 9.92 for brothers, and 22.93 for sisters. 
3	Bilateral homonymous visual field defects as initial manifestation of multiple sclerosis. Symptomatic suprageniculate lesions in multiple sclerosis expressed as a visual field defect are infrequent. The present case developed a bilateral homonymous defect as the initial and unique symptom of the disease. It was confirmed by nuclear magnetic resonance imaging, which disclosed extensive demyelinating areas in both optic nerve radiations. The mode of onset, perimetric findings, and unusual presentation of this condition are briefly discussed. 
2	A pilot study of suramin in the treatment of metastatic renal cell carcinoma. Suramin sodium is an aromatic polysulfonated compound that was originally introduced as an antiparasitic agent in the 1920s. Recently, in view of its ability to bind and disrupt the function of multiple growth factors and cellular enzyme systems, the authors have been evaluating the role of suramin as an antitumor agent. In this study, 12 patients with metastatic renal cell carcinoma received parenteral suramin by continuous infusion to a peak plasma suramin level greater than 200 micrograms/ml. No objective radiographic responses were observed, although greater than 90% necrosis of multiple tumor sites was documented at autopsy in one patient and normalization of tumor-related hypercalcemia occurred in another patient. Two patients had stable disease of 10 and 28 weeks' duration, respectively. Significant toxicities included hypotension related to sepsis and resulting in renal insufficiency (one patient), development of liver function abnormalities (one patient) marked thrombocytopenia (one patient), prothrombin time prolongation (all patients), vortex keratopathy (two patients), and Grade 1 sensory neuropathy (two patients). On the basis of the current results, suramin does not appear to be an active single agent against metastatic renal cell carcinoma when administered by this dosing schedule. 
3	The frequency, causes and timing of death within 30 days of a first stroke: the Oxfordshire Community Stroke Project. In a prospective, community-based study of 675 consecutive patients with a first-ever stroke, of whom over 90% had computed tomography (CT) and/or necropsy examinations, 129 deaths occurred within 30 days of the onset of symptoms, a case fatality rate (CFR) of 19%. The 30 day CFR for patients with cerebral infarction was 10% (57 of 545, for primary intracerebral haemorrhage 52% (34 of 66), for subarachnoid haemorrhage 45% (15 of 33) and for those of uncertain pathological type 74% (23 of 31). The CFR for patients who had been functionally dependent pre-stroke was 33% compared with 17% for those who had been independent pre-stroke. The age-adjusted relative risk of death for patients who had been functionally dependent pre-stroke was not significantly greater (1.8, 95% confidence interval 0 to 4.3). There was a significant trend for CFR to increase with age (Chi square for trend = 4.0, p less than 0.05). This relationship was found in those patients who had been functionally independent prestroke (Chi square for trend = 7.9, p less than 0.005) but not in those who had been dependent pre-stroke (Chi square for trend = 0.5, NS). The pattern of increasing CFR with increasing age amongst those who had been independent prestroke was seen particularly in patients with cerebral infarction (Chi square for trend = 8.6, p less than 0.005). The age-adjusted relative risk of death for patients with cerebral infarction who had been functionally dependent pre-stroke was 2.2 (95% confidence interval 1.2 to 4.1). Fifty three percent of all deaths within 30 days of stroke were due to the direct neurological sequelae of the stroke. 
5	Bacteriologic quality of intraoperative autotransfusion. Controversies remain about the bacteriologic aspects of intraoperative blood salvage despite the widespread use of this technique. In this prospective study, intraoperative salvaged blood was cultured in 401 patients, according to a direct plating technique. Bacterial growth was detected in 12.7% of cases. These results were compared with those obtained in control studies with sterile water and blood bank units under the same culture conditions. Most microorganisms were coagulase-negative staphylococci, followed by other skin and environmental contaminants. Quantitative estimates of contaminations showed low counts of colony-forming units (CFU/ml): 82% of positive cultures yielded 1 or 2 CFU/ml and 6% had 5 to 20 CFU/ml. Patients were followed up for a minimum of 3 months to detect septic complications. No statistically significant correlation could be found between bacteriologic results of autotransfused blood and infectious complications. This study suggests that bacteriologic monitoring of patients who have undergone autotransfusion may help in detecting surgical field contamination. It also confirms that intraoperative autotransfusion adds little septic risk to cardiac surgery. 
5	Genital herpes simplex virus infections. There has been a dramatic increase in patient visits to physicians for evaluation and treatment of genital herpes infections. This has resulted in part from an increase in genital herpes infections, particularly severe, first-episode genital herpes infections in adults without prior HSV-1 infection. Virus culture remains the most sensitive and specific method for diagnosis, and use of viral cultures is encouraged. Type-specific antibody tests have been employed in studies documenting the role of asymptomatic shedding of HSV in transmission of genital infections, the role of genital HSV in transmission of HIV, the predominance of asymptomatic and unrecognized infections in those infected with HSV-2, and the presence of past asymptomatic or unrecognized acquisition of HSV-2 in 25% of persons presenting with first-episode genital herpes. Unfortunately, commercially available serologic tests do not reliably differentiate between antibody to HSV-1 and HSV-2. Recent studies suggest that the annual risk of transmission from a sexual partner with genital herpes is about 10% in heterosexual couples. Currently, promotion of "safe sex" is the only available approach for prevention of transmission. However, ongoing research is focused on the development of an effective vaccine. Acyclovir should be used routinely in persons with first-episode genital herpes, but careful evaluation is needed in persons with recurrent genital herpes to determine whether episodic or suppressive treatment is indicated. Acyclovir should also be used routinely for episodic or suppressive treatment of HSV infections in persons with AIDS. Additional antiviral agents are needed for more effective suppressive therapy and for treatment of ACV-resistant HSV infections in the immunocompromised host. 
5	Premature alveolar bone loss in Erdheim-Chester disease. Erdheim-Chester disease is a rare histiocytosis also known as lipoid granulomatosis. Oral findings have not been reported previously to our knowledge. This case report documents evidence of oral sequelae of Erdheim-Chester disease. A patient whose course was followed for 10 years at the National Institutes of Health had premature alveolar bone resorption. He underwent full-mouth extraction at age 29 years because of severe periodontitis. Histopathologic evidence of Erdheim-Chester disease was demonstrated in the periodontal soft tissues. In the ensuring years, accelerated resorption of the residual ridges precluded the use of conventional dentures. We recommend early preventive dental management for patients with Erdheim-Chester disease. 
5	Five-year results of coronary bypass grafting for patients older than 70 years: role of internal mammary artery. Despite numerous references to the superiority of the internal mammary artery (IMA) over the saphenous vein for myocardial revascularization, its role in the elderly is still in question. From January 1984 through December 1988, 1,081 patients older than 70 years (mean age, 74.9 years) underwent bypass grafting, 354 (33%) receiving left IMA grafts based on the surgeon's preference and 727 (67%) receiving vein grafts only. Selection bias resulted in a higher incidence of known risk factors (such as cardiomegaly, arrhythmias, left ventricular failure, wall motion abnormalities, and preoperative combined New York Heart Association/Canadian Cardiovascular Association functional class IV) in patients in whom the IMA was not used. However, unstable angina, acute myocardial infarction, left ventricular dysfunction, and left main disease were not contraindications for using IMA grafts. The operative mortality rate was significantly lower in IMA patients (2.8% versus 7.6%). The actuarial 5-year survival rate (standard error) was higher in patients with IMA grafts, 89% (3%) versus 78% (2%), and postoperative functional class improved to a greater extent in IMA patients (87% of patients were in classes I and II). Arrhythmias and myocardial infarction were significant causes of late death only in patients with vein grafts. When patients are older than 70 years, patient selection factors clearly play an important role in the differential results between patients in whom the IMA is used and patients in whom vein grafts are used. As in younger patients, excellent results can be achieved in the elderly. 
1	Antibodies in anti-HBe-positive patient sera bind to an HBe protein expressed on the cell surface of human hepatoma cells: implications for virus clearance. The relevance of the recently described membrane-bound form of the HBe protein for the antiviral immune response was examined. The data show that antibodies in anti-HBe, but not in anti-HBc-positive human sera efficiently bind to the membrane expressed HBe. No evidence was obtained that the HBc can reach the cell surface in a form that can be detected with human antibodies. The findings suggest that the decline of virus titer that is usually observed after seroconversion from HBe to anti-HBe might be the result of an antibody-mediated elimination of infected cells. 
5	Nonhomologous chromatid exchange in hereditary and sporadic renal cell carcinomas. For the development of renal cell carcinomas, it has been suggested that a germ-line or somatic mutation occurs on one of the homologous chromosomes 3p, and subsequently the other 3p segment is lost. We have examined the karyotype and/or the allelic combination on chromosomes 3 and 5 by restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis in normal kidney and tumor samples from 28 renal cell carcinomas that developed in two patients with von Hippel-Lindau disease; we then compared the results to those of sporadic tumors. An unbalanced translocation between chromosome 3p and 5q or other chromosomes was found to be the most common aberration. We developed a model of nonhomologous chromatid exchange involving breakpoint clusters at chromosomes 3p13, 3p11.2, 5q22, and 8q11.2. Subsequent chromatid segregation may result in net loss of the 3p segment either (i) in one step or (ii) after a nondisjunctional loss of the derivative chromosome carrying the 3p segment. This general mechanism could also be implicated to explain genetic changes occurring in other types of solid tumors. 
4	Auto-PEEP during CPR. An "occult" cause of electromechanical dissociation? A 64-year-old man with severe COPD developed refractory nonperfusing sinus rhythm after intubation and positive-pressure ventilation. Fifteen minutes after resuscitative efforts were halted, the patient was noted to have spontaneous respirations and blood pressure, suggesting that dynamic hyperinflation was responsible for the observed electromechanical dissociation (EMD). We recommend a brief trial of apnea for patients with COPD and EMD when conventional measures are unsuccessful. 
1	Scoring system for the preoperative evaluation of metastatic spine tumor prognosis. An assessment system for the prognosis of metastatic spine tumors was evaluated for 64 cases who had undergone surgery. Six parameters were employed in the assessment system: 1) the general condition, 2) the number of extraspinal bone metastases, 3) the number of metastases in the vertebral body, 4) metastases to the major internal organs (lungs, liver, kidneys, and brain), 5) the primary site of the cancer, and 6) the severity of spinal cord palsy. Each parameter ranged from 0 to 2 points. The total score obtained for each patient can be correlated with the prognosis, while being valuable in predicting it. However, the prognosis could not be predicted from a single parameter. In conclusion, an excisional operation should be performed on those cases who scored above 9 points, while a palliative operation is indicated for those who scored under 5 points. 
3	Unusual cause of 'piriformis muscle syndrome'. The piriformis muscle syndrome is a controversial "clinical" syndrome primarily characterized by signs and symptoms of sciatic nerve compression at the region of the piriformis muscle as it passes through the greater sciatic notch. The syndrome is often referred to; however, cases are rarely reported, and it is generally an uncommon diagnosis. Of those cases reported, the incidence is six times more frequent in females than in males, and is typically temporally related to minor pelvic or buttock trauma. We describe a case of a 40-year-old woman presenting with signs and symptoms suggestive of piriformis muscle syndrome following a gynecologic procedure performed in the dorsal lithotomy position. Electromyographic findings were consistent with this clinical entity. Operative exploration, however, revealed the source of neural compression to be a pseudoaneurysm of the inferior gluteal artery adjacent to the piriformis muscle. The diagnostic features of this clinical syndrome are discussed. 
3	The role of carotid screening before coronary artery bypass. Five hundred thirty-nine patients with no symptoms of cerebral ischemia undergoing coronary artery bypass were preoperatively evaluated for presence of carotid stenosis by noninvasive methods (duplex scanning and ocular pneumoplethysmography-Gee). Overall prevalence of carotid stenosis greater than 75% was higher (8.7%) than that generally reported. Age greater than 60 years was significantly related to presence of carotid stenosis greater than 75% (11.3% vs 3.8%, p = 0.003). Risk factors such as hypercholesterolemia, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and smoking were not predictive for carotid stenosis, postoperative stroke, or death. Carotid stenosis greater than 75% (odds ratio 9.87, p less than 0.005) and coronary artery bypass redo (odds ratio 5.26, p less than 0.05) were both independent predictors of stroke risk. Patients were divided into four groups: group 1, minimal or mild degree of carotid stenosis (less than 50%), not submitted to prophylactic carotid endarterectomy (432 patients, 80.1%); group 2, moderate degree of stenosis (50% to 75%), no prophylactic carotid endarterectomy (60 patients, 11.2%); group 3, severe carotid stenosis; (greater than 75%), submitted to prophylactic carotid endarterectomy (19 patients, 3.5%), group 4, severe carotid stenosis (greater than 75%) no prophylactic carotid endarterectomy (28 patients, 5.2%). Patients in group 4 had significantly higher stroke rate (14.3%) compared to the other three groups (1.1%) (p = 0.0019). The finding of carotid stenosis greater than 75% in patients over 60 years of age was associated with occurrence of stroke in 15% of cases. Carotid screening is helpful to determine patients at increased risk of stroke and should be performed in patients greater than 60 years. 
5	Cardiac arrest after hypertonic citrate anticoagulation for chronic hemodialysis. The use of regional citrate anticoagulation as an alternative to standard therapy in hemodialysis patients at risk for bleeding complications has been well described. Recently, a method using hypertonic citrate has been reported as being safe and efficacious, and having several advantages over the usual techniques. Two patients who suffered cardiac arrests after dialysis using hypertonic citrate are discussed. Both received anticoagulation as described in the literature, although the citrate infusion rate was lower than recommended. Electrocardiograms obtained during the first such session showed no change in the Q-Tc interval with initiation of the infusion in either patient. Both were noted to have cardiac arrest within 5 minutes of discontinuation of dialysis, without warning symptoms, following the second and fifteenth treatments, respectively. The initial rhythm of ventricular fibrillation did not respond to standard advanced cardiac life support therapy, and the patients were not successfully resuscitated until they received intravenous calcium. The authors postulate that the loss of positive calcium flux from the dialysate, in conjunction with circulating unmetabolized citrate, caused an electrolyte imbalance leading to the potentially fatal arrhythmia. Caution is recommended in using this method of regional anticoagulation. 
4	The surprising kidney-fluid mechanism for pressure control--its infinite gain! In this short paper, I have tried to explain the elation that we felt when we first realized that the kidney-fluid mechanism for controlling the arterial pressure has an infinite feedback gain property. Because of this, all the other pressure control mechanisms, none of which has ever been shown to have a similar infinite gain property, must themselves alter the kidney-fluid mechanism if they are to succeed in causing long-term changes in the arterial pressure. We have not been able to refute this principle despite many experiments over the last 2 decades. For this reason, our first understanding of the infinite gain property of the kidney-fluid mechanism was like a light at the end of the tunnel. I hope that I can explain to the reader the excitement of those few seconds when we first recognized the principle in 1966. 
3	The acute aseptic meningitis syndrome. The acute aseptic meningitis syndrome is an entity that presents a diagnostic challenge to the clinician. Although many infectious and noninfectious etiologies exist for this syndrome, viruses, especially nonpolio enteroviruses, are the classic and most important agents encountered. The incidence of polio and mumps meningitis has declined dramatically in the vaccine era, but recently described pathogens, such as human immunodeficiency virus and Borrelia burgdorferi (Lyme disease agent) are now important considerations in the differential diagnosis. Specifically treatable entities (eg, mycobacterial or fungal meningitis, herpes simplex encephalitis, parameningeal infection) that may mimic aseptic meningitis in their initial presentations must not be overlooked. A careful approach to the patient and a rational use of laboratory studies are the basis for establishing a specific diagnosis and assuring a favorable outcome. 
1	Human central nervous system primitive neuroectodermal tumor expressing nerve growth factor receptors: CHP707m. A primitive neuroectodermal tumor (PNET) presented as a cerebral hemispheric mass in a 33-year-old man. Bone marrow metastases were discovered 11 months later. A cell line (CHP707m) was derived from these metastases. In culture, the cells showed features of neuronal differentiation, forming short neurites and synthesizing low-molecular-weight neurofilament protein. Northern blotting showed the tumor cells express nerve growth factor (NGF) receptor messenger RNA, and fluorescence-activated cell-sorting demonstrated NGF receptors on the cell surface. Western blotting showed CHP707m NGF receptors are truncated. The receptors are functional; they bind iodine 125-labeled mouse NGF with an affinity of 1.6 x 10(-9) M, and short-term treatment with NGF induces expression by the tumor cells of the proto-oncogene, c-fos. Although CHP707m is the first central nervous system PNET cell line proven to express NGF receptors, immunohistological survey of tissue sections prepared from human central nervous system PNETs showed that 13 of 35 contained NGF receptor-positive tumor cells. Thus, more than one-third of such tumors might be responsive to the effects of NGF. 
5	Cytoreductive hepatic surgery for neuroendocrine tumors. We retrospectively reviewed 37 patients who underwent hepatic resection between 1970 and 1989 to evaluate the role of cytoreductive hepatic surgery in patients with metastatic neuroendocrine tumors (carcinoid, 24; islet cell, 13). Seventeen resections were curative (no gross residual tumor); nine patients had symptomatic endocrinopathies and seven patients had symptoms caused by the primary tumor. Eight of nine patients with symptomatic endorcrinopathies obtained complete relief of symptoms; five are alive with no evidence of disease at 2 to 82 months (mean, 26 months). Six of seven patients with symptoms caused by the primary tumor obtained complete relief; five are alive with no evidence of disease at 5 to 28 months (mean, 14 months). One symptom-free patient underwent curative hepatic resection 5 years after abdominoperineal resection for a rectal carcinoid. Twenty resections were palliative (gross residual tumor); 16 patients had symptomatic endocrinopathies and 4 patients had symptoms caused by the primary tumor. Eight of 16 patients with symptomatic endocrinopathies obtained complete relief; five are alive at 2 to 30 months (mean, 11 months), with a mean duration of complete relief of 6 months (3 to 12 months). All four patients who underwent resection for symptoms caused by the primary tumor obtained complete relief; two are alive and symptom free at 10 and 101 months. Our experience suggests that curative surgery should be considered in all patients with completely resectable metastatic disease and that palliative surgery, despite the short duration of complete relief, should be considered in selected patients because it delays and may reduce the subsequent need for medical therapy. 
1	Phase II study of fluorouracil and recombinant interferon alfa-2a in previously untreated advanced colorectal carcinoma. We conducted a phase II clinical trial of fluorouracil (5FU) and recombinant interferon alfa-2a (rIFN alpha-2a) in 52 previously untreated patients with bidimensionally measurable metastatic colorectal cancer. During week 1, 5FU was administered as a continuous intravenous infusion, 750 mg/m2/d for 5 consecutive days. Intravenous bolus administration of 5FU 750 mg/m2 was given weekly for 7 weeks starting on day 12. rIFN alpha-2a (Roferon; Hoffman-LaRoche, Nutley, NJ), 9 x 10(6) U, was administered subcutaneously three times weekly during weeks 1 to 8. Patients were evaluated for response on week 9. Of 52 patients enrolled in the study, 51 were assessable for toxicity, and 45 were assessable for response. Fifteen patients experienced partial response, and one patient achieved a clinical complete response for an overall response rate of 35% (95% confidence interval [CI], 22%, 50%). Median duration of response is 7.5 months (range, 4 to 11 months). Seventy percent of patients entered on the study are alive with a median follow-up duration of 7 months. Twenty-five percent of patients developed grade 4 toxicity, and 82% developed grade 3 toxicity. One drug-related death in the presence of sepsis was reported, and two treatment-related seizures occurred. Our experience with this schedule produced a lower response rate with greater toxicity than previously reported. Current randomized trials comparing this schedule of 5FU with rIFN alpha-2a to 5FU plus folinic acid (leucovorin) or single-agent 5FU may determine its role in the treatment of advanced colorectal carcinomas. 
5	Early detection of acute myocardial infarction in patients presenting with chest pain and nondiagnostic ECGs: serial CK-MB sampling in the emergency department [published erratum appears in Ann Emerg Med 1991 Apr;20(4):420] STUDY OBJECTIVES: Patients presenting to the emergency department with chest discomfort are a difficult problem for emergency physicians. Nearly 50% of patients with acute myocardial infarction (AMI) will initially have nondiagnostic ECGs on ED presentation. The purpose of this study was to determine if patients with AMI having nondiagnostic ECGs could be identified using new immunochemical assays for serial CK-MB sampling in the ED. DESIGN: Chest pain patients, more than 30 years old, with pain not caused by trauma or explained by radiographic findings, were eligible for the study. Serial serum samples were drawn on ED presentation (zero hours) and three hours after presentation, then analyzed for CK-MB using four immunochemical methods and electrophoresis. Standard World Health Organization criteria were used to establish the diagnosis of AMI, including new Q-wave formation or elevation of standard in-hospital serum cardiac enzyme markers. SETTING: A tertiary cardiac care community hospital. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: The serum from 183 patients hospitalized for possible ischemic chest pain was collected and analyzed. Thirty-one of 183 patients (17%) were found to have AMI by standard in-hospital criteria. Sixteen of the 31 patients (52%) with AMI had nondiagnostic ECGs on presentation. Immunochemical determination of serial CK-MB levels provided a sensitive and specific method for detecting AMI in patients within three hours after ED presentation compared with standard electrophoresis. The four immunochemical methods demonstrated a range in sensitivity from 50% to 62.1% on ED presentation versus 92% to 96.7% three hours later. The immunochemical tests demonstrated specificities ranging from 83.0% to 96.4% at three hours, with three of the four tests having specificities of 92% or greater. Electrophoresis had a sensitivity of 34.5% on ED presentation, increasing to 76.9% at three hours, with a specificity of 98.6%. CONCLUSIONS: Immunochemical CK-MB methods allowed rapid, sensitive detection of AMI in the ED. Early detection of AMI offers many potential advantages to the emergency physician. Early detection of AMI, while the patient is in the ED, could direct disposition of this potentially unstable patient to an intensive care setting. Such information may prevent the ED discharge of patients with AMI having nondiagnostic ECGs. The diagnosis of AMI within a six-hour period after symptom onset may allow thrombolytic therapy to be given to patients with AMI not having diagnostic ECGs. This study served as a pilot trial for a multicenter study of the Emergency Medicine Cardiac Research Group, which is currently ongoing. 
5	Controlled trial of antimycobacterial therapy in Crohn's disease. Clofazimine versus placebo. In order to study the effect of clofazimine, a powerful antimycobacterial and antiinflammatory agent, 49 patients with active Crohn's disease were randomized to either corticosteroids plus clofazimine 100 mg daily (N = 25) or to steroids and matching placebo (N = 24). A total of 28 patients (58%) went into disease remission (clofazimine 16, placebo 12; P = NS) with a fall in disease activity score from 10.5 +/- 4.4 to 3.3 +/- 3.5. Patients were treated for a further eight months with clofazimine or placebo and 18 of 28 maintained their remission and completed the study (clofazimine 12, placebo 6; P = NS). Side effects were minor and consisted of skin rash and increased pigmentation. Clofazimine as a solitary antimycobacterial agent appears ineffective in inducing remission in Crohn's disease but may have a role in either disease maintenance or combination chemotherapy. 
2	Low diacylglycerol values in colonic adenomas and colorectal cancer. The biochemical events that make colonic epithelial cells proceed along the adenoma-carcinoma sequence are not well understood. The phosphoinositol signal transduction pathway is involved in the regulation of cell growth and differentiation. To determine its role in colonic neoplasias we performed mass measurements of its second messenger sn-1,2-diacylglycerol in biopsy specimens from normal mucosa and neoplasias of the colon. Normal colonic mucosa was also investigated in patients without colonic abnormalities (n = 10). Compared with pooled diacylglycerol values from five colonic sites (100%), values in patients with a normal colon were highest in the ascending colon (120 (5)%, p less than 0.05) and lowest in the rectum (81 (5)%, p less than 0.01). Absolute diacylglycerol values in patients with normal colons (2.62 (0.16) nmol/mg protein) were not significantly different from those found in the normal mucosa of patients with colorectal neoplasias (2.45 (0.17) nmol/mg protein). Both colonic adenomas (n = 15) and colorectal carcinomas (n = 14) showed significantly decreased diacylglycerol values compared with the adjacent normal mucosa of each patient (72 (4)%, p less than 0.001, and 71 (4)%, p less than 0.001 respectively). The appreciable decrease in mass diacylglycerol values clearly distinguishes adenomas and carcinomas of the colon from the surrounding normal mucosa. This finding suggests that profound metabolic changes of the phosphoinositol signal transduction pathway occur early in the adenoma-carcinoma sequence and may be important in colonic carcinogenesis. 
3	Scaphoid malunion. We reviewed 10 patients with symptomatic malunion of a carpal scaphoid fracture. All had displacement with dorsiflexed intercalated segment instability, and suffered from pain, restricted range of movement at the wrist and decreased grip strength. The restriction of flexion-extension and the decreased grip strength correlated with the severity of the DISI deformity. Seven patients had a corrective osteotomy, using an anterior wedge-shape bone graft with internal fixation by Herbert screw, and all had satisfactory results. We believe that symptoms associated with scaphoid malunion are related to consequent carpal deformity. 
2	Prevention of pancreatic fistula by modified pancreaticojejunal anastomosis. A major cause of morbidity after pancreatoduodenectomy is leakage from the pancreaticojejunal anastomosis. To prevent this complication, we have employed mucosal stripping from the proximal jejunum prior to end-to-end anastomosis in 19 patients with good results.
