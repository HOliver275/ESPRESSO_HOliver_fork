4	Thallium reinjection after stress-redistribution imaging. Does 24-hour delayed imaging after reinjection enhance detection of viable myocardium? BACKGROUND. Thallium reinjection immediately after conventional stress-redistribution imaging improves the detection of viable myocardium, as many myocardial regions with apparently "irreversible" thallium defects on standard 3-4-hour redistribution images manifest enhanced thallium uptake after reinjection. Because the 10-minute period between reinjection and imaging may be too short, the present study was designed to determine whether 24-hour imaging after thallium reinjection provides additional information regarding myocardial viability beyond that obtained by imaging shortly after reinjection. METHODS AND RESULTS. We studied 50 patients with chronic stable coronary artery disease undergoing exercise thallium tomography, radionuclide angiography, and coronary arteriography. Immediately after the 3-4-hour redistribution images were obtained, 1 mCi thallium was injected at rest, and images were reacquired at 10 minutes and 24 hours after reinjection. The stress, redistribution, reinjection, and 24-hour images were then analyzed qualitatively and quantitatively. Of the 127 abnormal myocardial regions on the stress images, 55 had persistent defects on redistribution images by qualitative analysis, of which 25 (45%) demonstrated improved thallium uptake after reinjection. At the 24-hour study, 23 of the 25 regions (92%) with previously improved thallium uptake by reinjection showed no further improvement. Similarly, of the 30 regions determined to have irreversible defects after reinjection, 29 (97%) remained irreversible on 24-hour images. These findings were confirmed by the quantitative analysis. The mean normalized thallium activity in regions with enhanced thallium activity after reinjection increased from 57 +/- 13% on redistribution studies to 70 +/- 14% after reinjection but did not change at 24 hours (71 +/- 14%). In regions with irreversible defects that were unaltered by reinjection, mean regional thallium activity did not differ from the reinjection to the 24-hour studies (57 +/- 17% and 58 +/- 17%, respectively). Twenty-four-hour imaging after reinjection showed improvement in only four of 35 irreversible regions (involving three of the 50 patients). CONCLUSIONS. These data indicate that thallium reinjection at rest after 3-4 hours of redistribution provides most of the clinically relevant information pertaining to myocardial viability in regions with apparently irreversible thallium defects. Hence, thallium reinjection may be used instead of 24-hour imaging in most patients in whom a persistent thallium defect is observed on conventional redistribution images. 
5	Laparoscopic guided cholecystectomy. Cholecystectomy remains the most effective form of therapy for patients with symptomatic cholelithiasis. An alternative method of gallbladder removal, laparoscopic guided cholecystectomy, was attempted in 100 patients. Five patients required conversion of the laparoscopic procedure to an open laparotomy for the following reasons: discovery of a pancreatic malignancy in one patient, extensive adhesions in one, presence of an aberrant accessory right hepatic duct in one, common hepatic duct injury in one, and avulsion of the cystic duct in one. Both ductal injuries occurred during the early phase of the clinical program. In those patients undergoing laparoscopic cholecystectomy, 93 were discharged within 24 hours of surgery and 94 returned to normal activity within 1 week. Laparoscopic guided cholecystectomy appears to offer a number of advantages in patient care as well as a significant reduction in health care expenses for gallbladder disease. Appropriate training in laparoscopic surgery is necessary in order to avoid operative complications. 
3	Neuroexcitatory plasma amino acids are elevated in migraine. To investigate the role of glutamic (Glu) and aspartic acid (Asp) in migraine, we measured the plasma amino acids in migraine patients with and without aura, between and during attacks, and compared the profiles with the plasma amino acid profiles of tension headache patients and healthy controls. Between attacks, migraineurs (notably with aura) had substantially higher plasma Glu and Asp levels than did controls and tension headache patients. In addition, patients with migraine without aura showed low plasma histidine levels. During migraine attacks, Glu (and to a lesser extent Asp) levels were even further increased. The results suggest a defective cellular reuptake mechanism for Glu and Asp in migraineurs, and we hypothesize a similar defect at the neuronal/glial cell level, predisposing the brain of migraineurs to develop spreading depression. 
5	Clinical, radiographic, and hemodynamic correlations in chronic congestive heart failure: conflicting results may lead to inappropriate care. PURPOSE: Clinical and radiographic examinations are commonly used for estimating severity and titrating therapy of chronic congestive heart failure. The purpose of this study was to establish the relationship between findings on history, physical examination, chest roentgenogram, and pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (PCWP). PATIENTS AND METHODS: Fifty-two consecutive patients with chronic congestive heart failure, referred for evaluation for heart transplantation, were studied; all patients underwent history, physical examination, upright chest roentgenogram, and cardiac catheterization. The mean left ventricular ejection fraction was 0.19 +/- 0.06. Patients were divided into three groups according to their PCWP: Group 1, normal PCWP (less than or equal to 15 mm Hg, n = 19); Group 2, mild to moderately elevated PCWP (16 to 29 mm Hg, n = 15); Group 3, markedly elevated PCWP (greater than or equal to 30 mm Hg, n = 18). RESULTS: Physical and radiographic signs of congestion were more common in the groups with higher PCWP, but they could not be used to reliably separate patients with different filling pressures. Physical findings (orthopnea, edema, rales, third heart sound, elevated jugular venous pressure) or radiographic signs (cardiomegaly, vascular redistribution, and interstitial and alveolar edema) had poor predictive value for identifying patients with PCWP values greater than or equal to 30 mm Hg. These findings had poor negative predictive value to exclude significantly elevated PCWP (greater than 20 mm Hg). Radiographic pulmonary congestion was absent in eight (53%) patients in Group 2 and seven (39%) in Group 3. In patients in Group 2 and 3, those without radiographic congestion were in a better New York Heart Association functional class (3.5 +/- 0.5 versus 2.8 +/- 0.6, p less than 0.01). There was good correlation between right atrial pressure and PCWP (r = 0.64, p less than 0.001). A normal right atrial pressure had no predictive value, but a pressure greater than 10 mm Hg was seen in all but one patient with a PCWP value greater than 20 mm Hg. CONCLUSION: Clinical, radiographic, and hemodynamic evaluations of chronic congestive heart failure yield conflicting results. Absence of radiographic or physical signs of congestion does not ensure normal PCWP values and may lead to inaccurate diagnosis and inadequate therapy. It is not known whether therapy aimed at normalizing PCWP is superior to relieving clinical and radiographic signs of congestion. 
5	Cross-linked hemoglobin solution as a resuscitative fluid after hemorrhage in the rat. Intramolecularly (alpha-alpha) cross-linked hemoglobin has been reported to have oxygen transport properties similar to those of whole blood. The present study evaluated the efficacy of diaspirin alpha-alpha cross-linked hemoglobin solution as a resuscitation fluid, with heart rate, mean arterial pressure, and transcutaneous oxygen tension as the study parameters. Rats were bled and approximately one third of their total blood volume (20 ml/kg) was removed while they were anesthetized; they were then resuscitated with 14% hemoglobin solution. Animals that received either 10 mg/kg (n = 10) or 20 mg/kg (n = 10) of hemoglobin solution responded quickly and positively to the infusions: mean arterial pressure (which had dropped to less than 40% of prehemorrhage levels) returned to baseline within 2 minutes of initiating infusion; by 4 minutes, the mean arterial pressures of the hemoglobin-infused groups were significantly higher (p less than or equal to 0.05) than those in both the autologous shed blood (n = 8) and lactated Ringer's (n = 10) groups. The heart rate and transcutaneous oxygen tension responses in both the half-volume and full-volume replacement hemoglobin groups matched the response to autologous shed blood throughout the hour of observation. The favorable hemodynamic response to infusion of cross-linked hemoglobin solution after hemorrhage suggests that this material is comparable to autologous shed blood and superior to lactated Ringer's solution as a resuscitative fluid as assessed in this model. 
2	The role of gastric resection in the management of multicentric argyrophil gastric carcinoids. A patient with pernicious anemia, atrophic non-antral gastritis, hypergastrinemia, and widespread hyperplasia of enterochromaffin-like cells and manifest enterochromaffin-like cell carcinoma was followed up during 39 months, including 15 months after gastric resection. In this case normalization of gastrin levels did not prevent the development of multiple gastric carcinoids in the fundic mucosa, suggesting that factors other than gastrin are of importance in the pathogenesis. 
3	The influence of warning signal timing and cognitive preparation on the aversiveness of electric shock. Many medical and dental procedures are noxious. Finding an optimal way of warning patients concerning the aversive procedures could help them to cope better. A model for the effective use of a warning signal in coping with pain posited that a person needs enough time to be able to react and should possess the skills necessary to utilize the time effectively. It was felt that a very short warning period, e.g., 5 sec, could not be long enough, while a 180 sec warning period would in and of itself become aversive. Reactions to electric shock were obtained from 36 paid, volunteer subjects who were each tested on a within-subject, counterbalanced order at 4 different warning periods: 5, 30, 60, and 180 sec. The subjects were divided into 3 groups: (1) the experimental group was provided with a pretested self-instructional booklet to learn a variety of pain control techniques; (2) the placebo group was provided with a self-instructional booklet on citizenship; (3) the control group waited quietly for 13 min. No significant results were obtained for the different pain-coping conditions. Significant differences, however, were obtained for the various warning periods. Maximum skin resistance changes, higher ratings of pain and of anxiety were obtained for the 60 and 180 compared to the 5 and 30 sec warning periods. Maximum heart rate was obtained for the 30 sec warning. Results were discussed in terms of the psychological meaning of the various measures as well as their clinical implications. 
5	Early diastolic clicks after the Fontan procedure for double inlet left ventricle: anatomical and physiological correlates. M mode echocardiograms and simultaneous phonocardiograms were recorded in four patients with early diastolic clicks on auscultation. All had double inlet left ventricle and had undergone the Fontan procedure with closure of the right atrioventricular valve orifice by an artificial patch. The phonocardiogram confirmed a high frequency sound occurring 60-90 ms after aortic valve closure and coinciding with the time of maximal excursion of the atrioventricular valve patch towards the ventricular mass. One patient had coexisting congenital complete heart block. The M mode echocardiogram showed "reversed" motion of the patch towards the right atrium during atrial contraction. Doppler flow studies showed that coincident with this motion there was forward flow in the pulmonary artery with augmentation when atrial contraction coincided with ventricular systole. The early diastolic click in these patients was explained by abrupt cessation of the motion of the atrioventricular valve patch towards the ventricular mass in early diastole. In one patient atrial contraction led to a reversal of this motion and was associated with forward flow in the pulmonary artery. 
1	SPECT imaging of pediatric brain tumor with hexakis (methoxyisobutylisonitrile) technetium (I). Technetium-99m-Hexamibi [Hexakis (methoxyisobutylisonitrile) technetium (i)] was developed as a myocardial perfusion agent with biologic properties similar to those of thallium-201 (201TI). As 201TI has recently been observed to be of value for the diagnosis of brain tumors when used in conjunction with single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) imaging technology, the possibility that the biologic similarity of the two radiopharmaceuticals extended to their affinity for tumors was tested. A 5-yr-old female patient with a brain stem astrocytoma showed marked focal uptake of 99mTc-Hexamibi at the site of tumor recurrence as defined by biopsy and prior 201TI/SPECT study. Tumor-to-normal cortex radioactivity ratios for the 99mTc-Hexamibi/SPECT study were 132:1 and the spatial resolution of the 99mTc-Hexamibi images was high. This observation suggests that 99mTc-Hexamibi merits further study as a potential agent for SPECT imaging of human brain tumors. 
3	The supraspinal anxiolytic effect of baclofen for spasticity reduction. Recent studies in the psychiatric literature indicate that baclofen has an anxiolytic action in certain psychopathologic conditions. Clinical observation has shown that manifestations of spasticity are increased in anxious individuals, implicating a supraspinal site of mediation for these responses. The purposes of this study were to determine if baclofen reduced anxiety in individuals with traumatic spinal cord lesions and whether that reduction was correlated with decreased spasticity from the baclofen. Five adult males with traumatic spinal cord injury were randomly assigned to the study protocol. A double-blind, repeated measures, multiple base-line, single-case research design was employed. The independent variable was dose of medication with the three levels being placebo, 40 mg/day of baclofen and 80 mg/day of baclofen, in four evenly divided doses. The dependent variable was the score obtained on the Beck Inventory-A anxiety scale (BIA). The subjects were administered the BIA twice per week for a nine-week period of time, during which they received the doses of medication as described. Quantitative measurements of spasticity were also taken at each session. Visual inspection analysis of the data showed that two subjects had no measurable anxiety of the BIA throughout the study. Three subjects had measurable anxiety on the BIA during the base-line/placebo phase. They showed a decreased level of their BIA scores with 40 mg/day of baclofen, and a further level reduction with 80 mg/day of baclofen. The reduction in BIA scores was statistically significant using the standard deviation band test in one of these subjects. These data indicate that BIA probably has an anxiolytic effect for individuals status post-traumatic spinal cord injury. 
5	Sixty consecutive breast reconstructions with the inflatable expander: a critical appraisal. Breast reconstruction using inflatable expanders has become an established and preferred technique. Although our knowledge of the biomechanical changes occurring in expanded skin has increased greatly, little information is available regarding average aesthetic results achieved with this technique. In order to eliminate the bias of best case selection reports, this study of 60 consecutive patients undergoing skin-expansion breast reconstruction was undertaken. Results of the study demonstrated a significant frequency and diversity of complications. In particular, immediate breast reconstruction with skin expanders was identified as a high-risk procedure because of its association with skin necrosis and delayed wound healing. Although two procedures--insertion and replacement--had been anticipated, patients from both the Boston and New York groups required approximately three operations to complete the expansion process. Average aesthetic results, often characterized by problems of symmetry, ptosis, and contour, need to be recognized and improved. 
4	Recurrent transient ischemic attacks and stroke in association with an internal carotid artery web Fibromuscular dysplasia is a nonatherosclerotic vascular disease that most commonly affects cervical carotid arteries at the C1-C2 level when cephalic arteries are involved. Several histopathologic and angiographic subtypes of fibromuscular dysplasia exist; most have a benign natural history. We describe the third reported case of a pathologically proven, symptomatic proximal internal carotid artery web and suggest that patients with this lesion are at a higher risk for stroke. 
4	Primary defect in alpha-adrenergic responsiveness in patients with varicose veins. Responsiveness of superficial hand veins to local infusions of noradrenaline was compared in patients with primary varicose veins and in healthy volunteers by use of the dorsal hand vein technique. Patients with varicose veins required significantly higher doses of noradrenaline for half-maximal venoconstriction than the dose required by control subjects (geometric mean, 11.6 ng/min in patients compared with 4.8 ng/min in control subjects; p = 0.006). Noradrenaline responsiveness in varicose veins was not significantly different from hand vein responsiveness in the same patients. Our findings indicate a constitutional decrease in venous alpha-adrenergic receptor responsiveness in patients with varicosities. Dilation of varicose veins does not further affect noradrenaline-induced venoconstriction. 
1	The Van Nes tibial rotationplasty. A functionally viable reconstructive procedure in children who have a tumor of the distal end of the femur. Twelve patients who had a malignant tumor of the distal end of the femur were treated with a Van Nes tibial rotationplasty. The survival rates were comparable with those for above-the-knee amputees and patients who had an endoprosthetic replacement. The results of functional testing showed that these patients performed as well as those who had endoprosthetic replacement and better than those who had above-the-knee amputation. Rotationplasty is therefore a favorable alternative to amputation or endoprosthetic replacement, either as a primary or as a salvage procedure. 
2	Disposition of 5-aminosalicylic acid by olsalazine and three mesalazine preparations in patients with ulcerative colitis: comparison of intraluminal colonic concentrations, serum values, and urinary excretion. To compare the disposition of 5-aminosalicylic acid (5-ASA) and its acetylated metabolite during treatment with olsalazine and mesalazine, 14 patients with inactive ulcerative colitis were randomly assigned to olsalazine (1 g twice daily) and the mesalazines, Asacol (800 + 400 + 800 mg daily), Pentasa (750 + 500 + 750 mg daily), and Salofalk (750 + 500 + 750 mg daily) in a crossover design trial so that all received each drug for seven days. Intraluminal colonic concentrations of 5-ASA were estimated after five days by the method of equilibrium in vivo dialysis of faeces. A predose serum sample and a 24 hour urine collection were obtained on day seven. The 5-ASA and acetyl-5-aminosalicylic acid (Ac-5-ASA) values were determined by high performance liquid chromatography. Olsalazine almost doubled the colonic concentrations (mean 23.7 (SEM) (1.9) mmol/l) of its therapeutically active ingredient (5-ASA) compared with equimolar doses of Pentasa (12.6 (2.2) mmol/l; p less than 0.0003) and Salofalk (15.0 (2.0) mmol/l; p less than 0.003). At the same time, olsalazine treatment was associated with lower serum concentrations and urinary excretions (p less than 0.05) of 5-ASA and Ac-5-ASA compared with the mesalazine preparations. The low systemic load of 5-ASA provided by olsalazine reduces the potential risk of nephrotoxicity during long term treatment. 
1	Treatment of angiomas with sclerosing injection of hydroxypolyethoxydodecan. The authors discuss the indications for hydroxypolyethoxydodecan in the sclerosing treatment of angiomas, with particular reference to cavernous, venous, and evolutive angiomas (ie, immature angiomas that fail to involute by eight to ten months). Moreover, the sclerosing agent may be employed, in connection with embolization and subsequent surgery, in arteriovenous angiomas with a relevant cutaneous-subcutaneous development. The authors have successfully used the "interstitial" sclerosing technique, according to Andrews' method. This technique involves interstitial injections to obtain the sclerosis of the thin threads of fibrous tissue stroma between the blood vessels. The sclerosing therapy may cause the complete regression of "low flow" angiomas or, at least, a partial reduction that simplifies the ensuing surgical excision. In the case of partial regression of the angioma obtained with the sclerosing therapy, the surgery of the remaining angioma causes a lesser degree of bleeding (especially in areas that do not particularly lend themselves to surgical exploration, ie, the oral cavity); an increased reliability in the radicality of the intervention (due also to the reduced size of the lesion); and better results from an aesthetic-functional point of view. 
4	Cystic medionecrosis of the coronary arteries and fatal coronary vasospasm. The histopathological basis of coronary vasospasm is not well defined. We report a patient with directly observed coronary artery spasm in whom cystic medionecrosis of the coronary arteries and great vessels and myxomatous degeneration of the mitral valve were evident. We suggest that myxoid connective tissue lesions of the heart may be linked to coronary vasospasm. 
3	Natural history of progressive ischemic stroke in a population treated with heparin Data on the acute natural history of progressive stroke with or without heparin treatment are limited. To define the acute course of patients treated with heparin for progressive stroke, we examined the charts of 69 such patients identified through the Cornell Neurology Database from October 1979 to June 1985. Analysis included determining whether further clinical deterioration or hemorrhagic complications were associated with readily identifiable clinical or laboratory variables. Twenty-five patients (36%) continued to deteriorate while receiving heparin, another two (3%) worsened due to intracerebral hemorrhage, and a total of 10 patients (14%) had bleeding complications. No clinical features or heparin dosing regimens distinguished the patients likely to benefit from heparin. Clinical progression or hemorrhage did not correlate with the level of anticoagulation as measured by the average heparin dose per day or the mean partial thromboplastin time. Without unequivocal evidence demonstrating heparin's ineffectiveness for progressive stroke, many clinicians managing such patients will continue to use heparin. Our results suggest that this decision should not be governed by such clinical features as a patient's age or sex or by the vascular distribution of the stroke. Furthermore, frequent measurement of and overzealous efforts to adjust the partial thromboplastin time may be unnecessary since it does not correlate with outcome. 
5	Nasal valve malfunction resulting from resection of cancer. Following cancer resection of the nasal unit, nasal valve malfunction is manifested by the symptoms of nasal stuffiness or difficulty getting air into the nostril. These symptoms occur in cases in which the resection is in the alar crease at the junction with the lateral sidewall of the nose. Wound scar contracture elevates the alar margin and causes the alar and lateral cartilages to move inward forming a visible and palpable shelf on the lateral wall of the nasal vestibule. This displacement of the alar and lateral cartilages and the rigid scar formed between these cartilages render the nasal valve immobile. Since it is easier to prevent nasal valve malfunction than to repair it later, wounds that bridge the alar crease or are located in either the alae or lateral sidewall and come within 1 mm of the alar crease with a total diameter of 1.0 cm should be repaired to prevent nasal valve malfunction. In the process of repairing deep defects, the overlapping region of the lateral crus of the alar cartilage and the lateral cartilage may be stabilized by a conchal cartilage graft. This cartilage graft may be used in combination with reconstruction of the nasal skin with a forehead flap and repair of the nasal lining. In the event that the nasal lining is intact, the cartilage graft may be used with a full-thickness skin graft. 
4	A blood-liquid interface for prolonged extracorporeal oxygenation with excellent antithrombogenicity. The authors verified the excellent antithrombogenicity of a blood-liquid interface (BLI) and introduced an oxygenator based on the principle of gas exchange across direct BLI. In a newly developed oxygenator, three layers of liquid flowed horizontally, contacting one another: O2 saturated silicone oil on the top, O2 saturated fluorcarbon at the bottom, and blood in the middle. Gas exchange was carried out across both direct BLIs. This system provided excellent antithrombogenicity as well as good gas exchange. The results indicate that this method will become a promising modality for prolonged extracorporeal oxygenation. 
1	Genetic mechanisms of tumor suppression by the human p53 gene. Mutations of the gene encoding p53, a 53-kilodalton cellular protein, are found frequently in human tumor cells, suggesting a crucial role for this gene in human oncogenesis. To model the stepwise mutation or loss of both p53 alleles during tumorigenesis, a human osteosarcoma cell line, Saos-2, was used that completely lacked endogenous p53. Single copies of exogenous p53 genes were then introduced by infecting cells with recombinant retroviruses containing either point-mutated or wild-type versions of the p53 cDNA sequence. Expression of wild-type p53 suppressed the neoplastic phenotype of Saos-2 cells, whereas expression of mutated p53 conferred a limited growth advantage to cells in the absence of wild-type p53. Wild-type p53 was phenotypically dominant to mutated p53 in a two-allele configuration. These results suggest that, as with the retinoblastoma gene, mutation of both alleles of the p53 gene is essential for its role in oncogenesis. 
5	The human immunodeficiency virus type 1 polyadenylylation signal: a 3' long terminal repeat element upstream of the AAUAAA necessary for efficient polyadenylylation. Several polyadenylylation (PA) signals containing elements upstream of the AAUAAA have recently been characterized. Similar to PA elements found downstream of the AAUAAA, the upstream elements function to increase efficiency of AAUAAA use as a signal for cleavage and PA. Using deletion and linker scanning mutations we show that the PA signal of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 contains upstream elements transcribed from the U3 region of the 3' long terminal repeat. The element that has the greatest effect on PA site use lies 77 to 94 nucleotides upstream of the AAUAAA, between the TATA element and the transcriptional initiation site. Mutations in the adjacent region, between 59 and 76 nucleotides upstream of the AAUAAA, have a smaller effect on PA efficiency. Mutations in a region further upstream, between 141 and 176 nucleotides upstream of the AAUAAA, also affected PA modestly. Functional similarity between upstream elements was indicated by the ability of the human immunodeficiency virus upstream region to replace the upstream region of the simian virus 40 late PA signal. The sequence of the major upstream element of human immunodeficiency virus is uracil-rich, analogous to many defined downstream PA elements. This fact may imply that upstream and downstream elements have similar mechanisms of action. 
4	Use of a computerized closed-loop sodium nitroprusside titration system for antihypertensive treatment after open heart surgery. This study evaluates the clinical applicability of administering sodium nitroprusside by a closed-loop titration system compared with a manually adjusted system. The mean arterial pressure (MAP) was registered every 10 and 30 sec during the first 150 min after open heart surgery in 20 patients (group 1: computer regulation) and in ten patients (group 2: manual regulation). The results (16,343 and 2,912 data points in groups 1 and 2, respectively), were then analyzed in four time frames and five pressure ranges to indicate clinical efficacy. Sixty percent of the measured MAP in both groups was within the desired +/- 10% during the first 10 min. Thereafter until the end of observation, the MAP was maintained within +/- 10% of the desired set-point 90% of the time in group 1 vs. 60% of the time in group 2. One percent and 11% of data points were +/- 20% from the set-point in groups 1 and 2, respectively (p less than .05, chi-square test). The computer-assisted therapy provided better control of MAP, was safe to use, and helped to reduce nursing demands. 
3	Fetal choroid plexus cysts: a prospective study and review of the literature. To determine the incidence and significance of fetal choroid plexus cysts, a prospective study was carried out at Queen's Medical Centre, Nottingham. The incidence of cysts was found to be 0.42% and the size of cysts varied from 3 to 13 mm with a mean diameter of 6.2 mm. Choroid plexus cysts were associated with other fetal abnormalities in three cases, two of which were subsequently found to have a chromosomal abnormality, one Trisomy 18 and one Trisomy 21. A review of the reported cases of choroid plexus cysts reveals an overall incidence of 5.8% for Trisomy 18. We therefore recommend that in patients with choroid plexus cysts a detailed scan should be carried out to look for the ultrasound markers of Trisomy 18. If there is an associated abnormality or cysts are large (13 mm or greater in diameter) and bilateral then a karyotyping should be carried out. 
5	Pyloric deformation from peptic disease. Radiographic evidence for incompetence rather than obstruction. We have used double-contrast radiographic techniques to clarify what changes in the configuration and movements of the gastroduodenal junction result when peptic lesions involve the distal gastric segment between the proximal (PPL) and the distal pyloric muscle loop (DPL). Among 50 cases of pyloric ulceration diagnosed during a four-year study period, 18 cases fulfilled all study criteria. Ulcers maintained a consistent location with regard to the muscular structures of the pylorus, and by affecting these structures, led to many strange deformations of the gastric outlet including permanent pseudodiverticula and reversal of pyloric angulation. The most common site for peptic lesions in the pyloric segment was the protuberance of the lesser curvature called the pyloric torus; many torus lesions extended into and destroyed the DPL. This led to widening of the gastric outlet and radiographic evidence of increased duodenogastric reflux. Pyloric closure was further impaired in this setting because the mucosa no longer prolapsed into the gastric outlet and did not occlude the pyloric lumen as it normally does. Less common lesions involved the greater curvature and the PPL. In one patient, scarring of the PPL led to an antral web and gastric hyperperistalsis. This was the only patient who required operation for chronic gastric outlet obstruction. One-third of the 18 patients had reflux esophagitis in addition to peptic pyloric disease. In most patients without additional ulcerogenic risk factors, treatment with antisecretory agents led to the healing of ulcer craters. We conclude that the morphologic and functional changes of the gastric outlet caused by peptic lesions depend, in part, on the effect the ulcer has on the underlying pyloric musculature. 
5	Scoliosis in trisomy 18. Patients with trisomy 18 typically present with multiple congenital anomalies and most die within the first year. However, long-term survivors are not uncommon. Seventeen patients with trisomy 18 were evaluated to study the development of scoliosis associated with this disorder. There were 13 females and 4 males with ages ranging from birth to 22 years. Twelve patients died by age 2. None developed scoliosis or had vertebral anomalies. The five patients who survived beyond age 2 developed scoliosis. Curve progression was demonstrated in the patients who returned for follow-up. Bracing was not well tolerated in two patients with curves of 48 degrees and 58 degrees. Both had poor motor control and sitting ability. One patient with a 30 degree curve was successfully managed by bracing. Another patient with a severe scoliosis was successfully fused with anterior and posterior instrumentation. Patients with trisomy 18 should be carefully evaluated for scoliosis. Scoliosis in the older child, surviving beyond age 2, may be progressive and difficult to manage. 
5	Single-stage laryngotracheal reconstruction. The mainstay for repairing subglottic and tracheal stenosis has been the rib graft with prolonged stenting. A refinement of this treatment was the use of the anterior cricoid decompression (split). We present single-stage reconstruction of the airway as an additional refinement of the laryngotracheoplasty. This article describes the experience of two institutions with single-stage reconstruction and offers some observations on the principles of the technique. 
4	Giant-cell arteritis of the uterus with associated temporal arteritis: a case report. Giant-cell arteritis involving the uterus was identified incidentally upon hysterectomy and anterior colporrhaphy for uterine prolapse. Subsequently, the patient was found to have giant-cell temporal arteritis presenting with fever of unknown origin. Fourteen previous cases involving the female genital tract have been reported. There appears to be an association between constitutional symptoms of fever, weight loss, malaise, headache, and polymyalgia rheumatica in elderly women with uterine prolapse and giant-cell arteritis of the genital tract. The rare presentation of giant-cell arteritis in the female genital tract does not support invasive costly evaluation in asymptomatic patients. However, a thorough investigation for involvement of other sites, including appropriate treatment for generalized disease, should be undertaken. 
4	The determinants and prognostic significance of serum uric acid in elderly patients of the European Working Party on High Blood Pressure in the Elderly trial. Determinants and risks associated with serum uric acid were investigated in 822 elderly hypertensive patients treated with hydrochlorothiazide and triamterene or placebo. Pretreatment serum uric acid levels were significantly higher in men than in women and had positive correlation with serum creatinine. After adjustment for serum creatinine, positive correlations of serum uric acid with body weight and fasting blood glucose in women and with serum cholesterol in men were significant. During follow-up, serum uric acid increased significantly in the treated patients, but remained unchanged in the placebo group. Total, cardiovascular, and noncardiovascular mortality were unrelated to initial serum uric acid levels. One placebo patient and seven treated patients developed gout. Of those seven, most were male patients and had significantly higher serum levels of uric acid and creatinine than the other patients. Gender and renal function were the major determinants of serum uric acid in elderly hypertensive patients. 
1	Primary de novo adenocarcinoma of the colon measuring 8 mm in diameter with lymph node metastases. Report of a case. Colonic adenocarcinomas measuring less than 10 mm are rare. Herein, we report a carcinoma measuring 8 mm in diameter associated with subserosal extension through a "locus minoris resistentiae" and metastases to lymph nodes, an association not previously reported. No residual adenomatous tissue was found, suggesting a de novo carcinoma. 
5	Extensive peripheral retinectomy combined with posterior 360 degrees retinotomy for retinal reattachment in advanced proliferative vitreoretinopathy cases. Posterior 360 degrees retinotomy in conjunction with extensive peripheral retinectomy was necessary for retinal reattachment in 18 eyes. A visual acuity of 20/400 or better was achieved in 22% of the patients; in patients with rubeosis, regression was found in 89%. Of the hypotonus eyes, preoperatively 78% were normotensive postoperatively after removal of anterior proliferative vitreoretinopathy (PVR) covering ciliary epithelium. The major intraoperative complication was hemorrhage, which could be readily controlled. Recurrent retinal detachment (RD) occurred in 39% and reproliferation in 50% of the patients. 
3	Early diagnosis and survival of ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysms. The hospital records of patients treated with ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm in a recent 5-year period were reviewed to collect data on factors which may be associated with mortality. Overall mortality was 62%. Patients with intraperitoneal rupture had a higher mortality (97%) than patients with retroperitoneal rupture (25%). Patients at increased risk were older than 80 years, presented with syncope, experienced a short duration of symptoms prior to emergency department (ED) arrival, had initial systolic blood pressure less than 90 mm Hg, and/or initial hemoglobin level less than eight on arrival at the ED and delay in beginning surgery. Multivariate analysis demonstrated preoperative blood pressure, preoperative hemoglobin, presence of syncope, and the amount of blood transfused were largely reflections of the type of rupture and had only slight independent relationship to mortality. The authors concluded that treating emergency physicians and surgeons have little control over the most important risk factors for mortality after aneurysm rupture, but may improve the prognosis by expediting diagnosis in the ED and surgical therapy. 
4	Embolization with particles in thoracic intramedullary arteriovenous malformations: long-term angiographic and clinical results. To evaluate the long-term results of endovascular treatment with particles in the management of thoracic intramedullary arteriovenous malformations (AVMs), the authors retrospectively reviewed the angiographic and clinical findings in 35 patients. Follow-up was 1-15 years (mean, 6 years) in 28 patients and 6-10 months (mean, 7 months) in seven. A total of 158 embolization procedures were performed in 35 patients. Revascularization occurred frequently, necessitating multiple endovascular sessions. Long-term clinical evaluation showed clinical improvement, compared with the initial status before treatment, in 63% of the patients. Clinical aggravation due to embolization was observed in seven patients (20%) after 12 of the 158 endovascular sessions (8%). These results are better than those reported after surgery and indicate that embolization with particles is an efficient and safe tool in the treatment of thoracic intramedullary AVMs. 
4	Quadricuspid aortic valve and aortic regurgitation diagnosed by Doppler echocardiography: report of two cases and review of the literature. Two cases of patients with quadricuspid aortic valve diagnosed by Doppler echocardiography are presented. Aortic regurgitation was detected by pulsed Doppler echocardiography in both patients. Because they were young patients, this aortic regurgitation indicated that aortic regurgitation is not necessarily a late-developing event, as has been thought previously. 
1	Mammographic measurements before and after augmentation mammaplasty. Thirty-five augmented women underwent mammography using both the standard implant-compression technique and, when possible, the implant-displacement technique; all had preaugmentation film-screen mammography available for evaluation. The area of mammographically visualized breast tissue before and after augmentation mammaplasty was measured using a transparent grid. Patients with subglandular implants had a mean decrease of 49 percent of measurable tissue area with compression mammography and a 39 percent decrease with displacement mammography. Patients with submuscular implants had a 28 percent decrease in measurable tissue area with compression mammography and a 9 percent decrease with displacement mammography. Anterior breast tissue was seen better with displacement mammography; posterior breast tissue, with compression mammography. Most patients had some degree of parenchymal scarring and lower image quality after augmentation. State-of-the-art mammography was not possible in most patients augmented with silicone-gel-filled implants. 
1	Use of leukocyte-depleted platelet concentrates for the prevention of refractoriness and primary HLA alloimmunization: a prospective, randomized trial. Compared with conventional transfusion regimes a strong reduction in HLA alloimmunization and refractoriness to platelet transfusions is obtained when both red blood cell concentrates (RBCs) and platelet concentrates (PCs) are depleted of leukocytes by filtration. Because most of the leukocyte contamination is introduced by transfusion of RBCs, filtration of RBCs appears rational, but uncertainty exists regarding the degree of leukocyte-depletion of PCs needed for the prevention of HLA alloimmunization and refractoriness. We conducted a prospective trial and randomized patients with acute leukemia to receive leukocyte-depleted PCs prepared either by centrifugation (mean leukocyte count 35 x 10(6)/PC of 6 U) or by filtration (mean leukocyte count less than 5 x 10(6)/PC of 6 U). Both groups received RBCs that were filtered after prior removal of the buffy coat. Clinical refractoriness occurred in 46% (12 of 26) of the evaluable patients that were transfused with centrifuged PCs and only in 11% (3 of 27) in the filtered group (P less than .005). De novo anti-HLA antibodies were detected in 42% (11 of 26) patients in the centrifuged group and only in 7% (2 of 27) of the patients receiving filtered PCs (P less than .004). In 8 of 11 alloimmunized patients in the centrifuged group antibodies were detected in the first 4 weeks of transfusion therapy while none of the patients in the filtered group became immunized against HLA antigens during that period. We conclude that for the prevention of HLA alloimmunization and refractoriness to platelet transfusions from random donors, both RBCs and PCs have to be leukocyte-depleted by filtration. 
2	Complications of Tenckhoff catheters post removal. Complications due to Tenckhoff catheters can occur at prolonged intervals after their removal. From January 1979 to October 1989, 431 patients at our center began continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD), 278 of whom subsequently transferred to another form of renal replacement therapy. We identified 12 patients (4.3% or 12/278) with post removal catheter complications. There were 14 post removal complications, two each in two patients, and one in each of 12 others. The mean time to complication was 541 +/- 143 days (27-2,040). In 71% (10/14) of the complications, an abscess was found at the site of the previously removed Tenckhoff catheter. In 29% (4/14) of the complications, foreign body material consistent with a retained cuff was recovered. Documentation at the time of Tenckhoff catheter removal should include a statement regarding the presence of the Tenckhoff catheter cuffs, and patients with retained cuffs should be monitored closely for the development of abscesses or other complications. Immunocompromised patients are at high risk for these complications. 
3	Fatal or severely disabling cerebral infarction during hospitalization for stroke or transient ischemic attack. Six (1%) of 578 patients admitted for cerebral infarction or transient ischemic attack (TIA) suffered a fatal or severely disabling in-hospital cerebral infarction following a period of stabilization or improvement lasting more than 1 day. These infarctions were characterized by the sudden onset of stupor or coma and subsequent development of transtentorial herniation due to carotid or middle cerebral artery territory infarction, or widespread brain-stem infarction due to basilar occlusion. Only one patient survived. Four patients had large-vessel disease documented by Doppler, angiography, or at autopsy. Each of these six infarcts occurred during the morning hours, 4-9 days after the initial event, 3-8 days after initiation of intravenous heparin, and within 4-8 h after intravenous heparin had been discontinued. No coagulation abnormalities were documented. We believe that these cases indicate that among patients admitted for cerebral infarction or TIA, fatal or severely disabling in-hospital cerebral infarction after a period of stabilization or improvement may occur in patients having an initially mild to moderate clinical deficit, that those suffering large artery disease may be at greater risk, and that there may be a relationship between heparin withdrawal and cerebral infarction in some patients. 

Excision of limbal dermoids. We reviewed the clinical files of 10 patients who had undergone excision of unilateral epibulbar limbal dermoids. Preoperatively, all of the affected eyes had worse visual acuity (P less than .02) and more astigmatism (P less than .01) than the contralateral eyes. Postoperatively, every patient was cosmetically improved. Of the eight patients for whom both preoperative and postoperative visual acuity measurements had been obtained, in six it had changed minimally (less than or equal to 1 line), and in two it had improved (less than or equal to 2 lines). Surgical complications included persistent epithelial defects (40%) and peripheral corneal vascularization and opacity (70%). These complications do not outweigh the cosmetic and visual benefits of dermoid excision in selected patients. 
Bell's palsy. A diagnosis of exclusion. In cases of acute unilateral facial weakness, a careful and systematic evaluation is necessary to identify the cause. Idiopathic facial paralysis (Bell's palsy) is a diagnosis of exclusion. It is also the most common cause of unilateral facial weakness seen by primary care physicians. The most important aspect of initial treatment is eye protection. Administration of systemic oral corticosteroids may lessen severity and duration of symptoms. 
Retained endobronchial foreign body removal facilitated by steroid therapy of an obstructing, inflammatory polyp. Oral and topical steroids were used to induce regression in an inflammatory, obstructing endobronchial polyp caused by a retained foreign body. The FB (a peanut half), which had been present for over six months, was then able to be easily and bloodlessly retrieved with fiberoptic bronchoscopy. 
Recurrent buccal space abscesses: a complication of Crohn's disease. A patient is described with generalized gastrointestinal involvement by Crohn's disease. Symptoms of recurrent ulceration and mucosal tags are well-described oral manifestations of Crohn's disease; however, in our patient recurrent facial abscesses, which required extraoral drainage, also developed. This complication has not previously been reported. 
Intracranial fibromatosis. Fibromatoses are uncommon infiltrative lesions affecting musculoaponeurotic structures, most often of the limbs and trunk. Lesions involving the cranial cavity are rare and require the same aggressive surgical management as elsewhere in the body. This case illustrates their clinical and neuroradiological features and underscores the necessity for aggressive resection to avoid recurrence. The literature is reviewed. 
The effect of intrathecal morphine on somatosensory evoked potentials in awake humans. Although the effect of systemic opioids on somatosensory evoked potentials has been well described, little is known about the interaction between intrathecally administered opioid analgesics and somatosensory evoked potentials. Accordingly, the influence of intrathecally administered morphine on posterior tibial nerve somatosensory cortical evoked potentials (PTSCEPs) was investigated in 22 unpremedicated, awake, neurologically normal patients scheduled to undergo elective abdominal or pelvic procedures. Patients were randomly assigned to receive either preservation-free intrathecal morphine sulfate (ITMS) or placebo. After baseline PTSCEP, heart rate and, mean blood pressure were recorded, ITMS (15 micrograms.kg-1) was injected via standard dural puncture with the patient in the lateral position. PTSCEPs, heart rate, and mean blood pressure were recorded again at 5, 10, 20, 30, 60, 90, and 120 min. Control patients were treated identically (including position, sterile preparation, and subcutaneous tissue infiltration with local anesthetic), except for lumbar puncture, and were unaware of their randomization. Before administration of ITMS, PTSCEP P1, N1, P2, N2, and P3 latencies were 39.4 +/- 3.2, 47.6 +/- 3.9, 59.2 +/- 3.2, 70.4 +/- 3.7, and 84.6 +/- 5.5 ms, (mean +/- standard deviation), respectively. The corresponding P1-N1, N1-P2, and P2-N2 amplitudes were 2.4 +/- 1.1, 2.4 +/- 1.1, and 2.3 +/- 0.9 microV, respectively. There were no significant changes over time between the control and ITMS groups. PTSCEPs resulting from left-sided stimulation were not different from those elicited by right-sided stimulation. All ITMS patients had intense postoperative analgesia for at least 24 h. It is concluded that ITMS does not affect PTSCEP waveforms in the 35-90 ms latency range during the awake state. 
The 29th Rovenstine lecture: clinical challenges for the anesthesiologist. In conclusion, I hope that my comments have reaffirmed your biases or, even more importantly, stimulated you to think in a different way about the information explosion in our specialty and medicine in general. I believe our specialty is in a golden era that will benefit from the past and be nourished by new discoveries and understanding. We as clinicians must accept the challenge of recognizing what new information deserves incorporation into our practice, what old information deserves to be sustained, and what merits new scrutiny and perhaps should be discarded. If I had one wish, it would be that anesthesiologists would never lose their zeal to be students--their thirst for new information--as the continuum of anesthesia education is indeed a life-long process. That wish, ladies and gentlemen, is my challenge to all anesthesiologists. 
Mortality in patients treated with flecainide and encainide for supraventricular arrhythmias. In a recent clinical trial, the class Ic antiarrhythmic drugs encainide and flecainide were found to be associated with an increased mortality risk in patients with new myocardial infarction and ventricular arrhythmias. The purpose of this study was to assess whether an increased mortality risk also accompanied the use of these drugs to treat patients with supraventricular arrhythmias. Data were obtained from the respective pharmaceutical sponsors on the mortality observed with each drug in United States and foreign protocols enrolling patients with supraventricular arrhythmias. Mortality in the encainide population (343 patients) and the flecainide population (236 patients) was compared with that in a research arrhythmia clinic, the Duke population (154 patients). Nine deaths occurred in the combined encainide-flecainide population and 10 deaths occurred in the Duke population; the follow-up periods averaged 488 days and 1,285 days, respectively. The 6-year survival functions of these 2 populations, estimated by the Kaplan-Meier technique, did not differ significantly (p = 0.62). The hazard ratio for the combined encainide-flecainide population relative to the Duke population was estimated to be 0.6 with a 95% confidence interval of 0.2, 1.7. These descriptive comparisons did not demonstrate any excess mortality when flecainide and encainide were used in patients with supraventricular arrhythmias. 
Approaches to immunotherapy of cancer: characterization of lymphokines as second signals for cytotoxic T-cell generation. Lymphokines, the soluble molecules produced by cells of the immune system, regulate cell-cell interactions and, consequently, the functional status of the immune system. Altering immunoregulatory pathways with lymphokines in vivo may provide a mechanism for controlling a variety of immunologic disorders. Although normally produced in vivo in very small quantities, the widespread availability of recombinant lymphokines has made it possible to study the molecular signals involved in production of lymphocyte effectors with activity against tumor. For example, interleukin-2-based cancer immunotherapy programs have, in certain clinical situations, suggested that immunologic intervention can influence the regression of metastatic cancer. Ultimately the successful application of these biologic agents requires an understanding of the interaction between the immune system and tumor on a molecular level. To induce a given biologic effect, it is necessary both to classify the required lymphokines and to identify the relevant effector cell populations. This review will examine the progress made in identifying the requirements for lymphokine-induced cytotoxic T-lymphocyte function. 
Retinal artery obstruction and atheromas associated with non-Hodgkin's large cell lymphoma (reticulum cell sarcoma). A 71-year-old woman developed branch retinal artery obstruction as the presenting manifestation of a large cell non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. Multifocal chorioretinal scars were present in the same eye. She experienced progressive visual loss accompanied by development of multiple yellow retinal arterial wall plaques, extension of retinal opacification into other quadrants, and increasing vitreous cellular infiltration. Clinical diagnoses included branch retinal arterial obstruction caused by toxoplasmosis retinitis, multifocal choroiditis and panuveitis simulating the presumed ocular histoplasmosis syndrome, vitiliginous chorioretinitis, and the acute retinal necrosis syndrome. Four months after onset, the right eye was blind and was enucleated. Histopathologic examination revealed extensive lymphomatous infiltration and necrosis of the retina and optic nerve. The retinal arteries were partly obstructed by lymphomatous infiltration and atheromas. Subsequently, the left eye and central nervous system were involved by lymphoma. 
The 'tonic' pain-related behaviour seen in mononeuropathic rats is modulated by morphine and naloxone. This study investigated the sensitivity to pharmacological manipulations of a rating method, adapted from the formalin test, to measure the tonic component of the pain-related behaviour induced by creating a peripheral mononeuropathy with 4 loose ligatures around the common sciatic nerve. Although the adequacy of opioid substances in alleviating neuropathic pain is highly controversial, the effects of morphine (1 mg/kg i.v.) and naloxone (1 mg/and 3 micrograms/kg i.v.) were tested 1-2 weeks after the nerve ligatures were established, when pain-related behaviours were well developed. Morphine (1 mg/kg i.v.) induced a potent and prolonged decrease in the pain-rating score at week 2 after surgery. Either at week 1 or week 2, naloxone elicited a bidirectional dose-dependent action: a further increase in the pain-rating score with the high dose (1 mg/kg i.v.), and a paradoxical decrease in the score with the low dose of 3 micrograms/kg i.v. These effects are comparable to those already described in several rat models of inflammatory pain and, in the same model of neuropathy, using a phasic nociceptive test, the measure of the vocalization to paw pressure. A few differences in the effects of naloxone on tonic and phasic pain are noted and discussed. 
Examination of cardiorespiratory changes during upper gastrointestinal endoscopy. Comparison of monitoring of arterial oxygen saturation, arterial pressure and the electrocardiogram. Critical events including hypoxaemia, arrhythmias and myocardial ischaemia may occur more frequently during endoscopic procedures than during anaesthesia. A study was undertaken to assess the cardiovascular changes and to evaluate suitable monitoring techniques to detect critical events during sedation and endoscopy. Twenty patients scheduled to undergo a prolonged endoscopic procedure which required deep sedation were studied. Continuous recordings of electrocardiogram, heart rate and arterial oxygen saturation were made and arterial pressure was recorded at one-minute intervals. The study commenced immediately before administration of sedatives, continued for the duration of the examination and for one hour following the examination. Oxygen saturation decreased in all patients during the examination to a mean of 82.9% (SD 11.9), and remained below baseline for the duration of the examination and into the recovery period. Statistically significant increases and reductions of systolic arterial pressure and rate-pressure product were found during the procedures compared with baseline values recorded before administration of sedatives. Sixteen of the 20 patients developed tachycardia during the examination. Ten patients developed ectopic foci which were supraventricular, ventricular or both in origin. Electrocardiogram changes resolved during the recovery period. Myocardial ischaemia was assessed by S-T segment depression and a significant correlation was found between S-T segment depression and hypoxaemia, although the magnitude of the S-T depression was small and may not have been detected clinically. No correlation was found between S-T segment depression and arterial pressure, heart rate or rate-pressure product. 
Hepatic transmethylation and blood alcohol levels. Golden Syrian hamsters that have elevated hepatic alcohol dehydrogenase activity were divided into four groups and group-fed on four different liquid diets for five weeks. Group I was fed a control diet formulated for hamsters. Group II was fed the control diet containing 20 micrograms of 4 methylpyrazole per litre. Group III was fed the hamster ethanol liquid diet (ethanol amounting to 36% of total calories). Group IV was fed the ethanol diet to which 4-methylpyrazole (20 micrograms/litre) was added. Groups I, II and III were group-fed the amount consumed by Group IV on a daily basis. Upon killing the animals, blood alcohol levels were found to be elevated in Group IV but not in Group III. Hepatic methionine synthetase (MS) was inhibited in Group IV. Betaine-homocysteine methyltransferase was induced in this group to compensate for the MS inhibition and liver betaine was lowered reflecting this induction. None of these changes were seen in Group III. Since none of the animals showed an aversion to their respective diets and gained weight normally, these data indicate that it was the elevated blood levels of ethanol rather than nutritional factors that were related to the changes in methionine metabolism. 
Memory T cells represent the predominant lymphocyte subset in acute and chronic liver inflammation. T cells can be divided into two main phenotypic subpopulations-i.e., the CD45RA-positive (2H4-positive) "naive" subset and the CD45RO-positive (UCHL1-positive) "memory" subset. In light of this recent functional reinterpretation of T-lymphocyte subpopulations, we reinvestigated the composition of the inflammatory infiltrate in liver biopsy specimens from patients with acute and chronic hepatitis. In normal liver, the few scattered mononuclear cells present in portal tracts and in the intralobular parenchyma consisted of both CD45RA-positive (2H4-positive) naive and CD45RO-positive (UCHL1-positive) memory T cells. In inflammatory liver diseases, portal tract and periportal and intralobular areas of inflammation consisted virtually only of CD45RO-positive (UCHL1-positive) memory T cells, which strongly expressed the CDw29 (4B4) antigen, and the adhesion molecules LFA-1, CD2, LFA-3, CD44 and VLA-4 and the activation marker human leukocyte antigen-DR. These results indicate that activated memory T cells represent the predominant subpopulation of lymphocytes in areas of liver inflammation. Memory T cells strongly express various homing receptors and adhesion molecules, which probably allow them to accumulate at inflammatory sites and to strengthen interaction with target cells. Furthermore, the increased number of memory T cells with enhanced interferon-gamma production in areas of liver inflammation may contribute to the maintenance and up-regulation of immune responses occurring in inflammatory liver diseases. 
Inflammatory properties of neutrophil-activating protein-1/interleukin 8 (NAP-1/IL-8) in human skin: a light- and electronmicroscopic study. Neutrophil-activating protein-1/interleukin 8 (NAP-1/IL-8), purified to homogeneity from lipopolysaccharide-stimulated human peripheral blood monocytes, was injected intracutaneously into human skin. Sequential biopsy specimens were taken in order to investigate the sequence of ultrastructural changes induced by the cytokine. Whereas intracutaneous injection of 100 ng of NAP-1/IL-8 per site caused no macroscopic changes, by histology infiltration with polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMN) and monocytes was present within 1 h and increased at 3 and 5 h. No lymphocyte infiltration was noted. The first ultrastructural changes (30 min) consisted of the presence of cytoplasmic 7-nm microfilament bundles, as well as numerous protrusions of the luminal plasma membrane of endothelial cells (EC). As a striking feature, multiple 100- to 160-nm electron lucent vesicles could be observed in the EC cytoplasm. These structures differed from plasmalemmal vesicles and suggest secretory activity. When PMN and monocytes appeared in the vascular lumen (1 h and later), the number of 100-160-nm electron-lucent vesicles had decreased significantly. In contrast to C5a-injected skin sites, mast cell degranulation was absent. 
Bronchogenic carcinoma with chest wall invasion. Bronchogenic carcinoma with chest wall involvement continues to present a major clinical challenge. We have treated 52 patients since 1973, excluding those with superior sulcus tumors. There were 37 male and 15 female patients with an average age of 62.9 years. Chest pain was an initial symptom in 37%. All patients had negative mediastinoscopy results. Squamous cell carcinoma was present in 53% and adenocarcinoma in 35%. The median number of ribs resected was two (range, one to six), and only 2 patients required chest wall reconstruction. Pathologic staging was T3 N0 M0 in 83% and T3 N1 M0 in 17%. Operative mortality was 3.8%. Absolute 5-year survival was 26.3%. Patients who had N1 disease had a 5-year survival of only 11%. Radiation therapy was employed in 46% for positive nodes or close margins. Bronchogenic carcinoma with chest wall invasion remains potentially curable if N2 nodes are not involved. The role of radiation therapy has not been clearly defined. Morbidity and mortality should be minimal. 
Electronic weaponry--a question of safety [published erratum appears in Ann Emerg Med 1991 Sep;20(9):1031] Electronic weapons represent a new class of weapon available to law enforcement and the lay public. Although these weapons have been available for several years, there is inadequate research to document their safety or efficacy. Two of the most common, the TASER and the stun gun, are reviewed. The electronic weapon was initially and still is approved by the US Consumer Product Safety Commission; its approval was based on theoretical calculations of the physical effects of damped sinusoidal pulses, not on the basis of animal or human studies. These devices are widely available and heavily promoted, despite limited research into their safety or efficiency and despite recent animal studies documenting their potential for lethality. 
Operative management of acoustic neuromas: the priority of neurologic function over complete resection. The objective of surgical management of acoustic tumors is to remove them entirely and preserve facial nerve function and hearing when possible. A dilemma arises when it is not possible to remove the entire tumor without incurring additional neurologic deficits. Twenty patients who underwent intentional incomplete surgical removal of an acoustic neuroma to avoid further neurologic deficit were retrospectively reviewed. They were divided into a subtotal group (resection of less than 95% of tumor) and a near-total group (resection of 95% or more of tumor) and were followed yearly with either computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging. The subtotal group was planned and consisted of elderly patients (mean age, 68.5 years) with large tumors (mean, 3.1 cm). The near-total group consisted of younger patients (mean age, 45.8 years) and smaller tumors (mean, 2.3 cm). The mean length of followup for all patients was 5.0 years. Ninety percent of patients had House grade I or II facial function post-operatively. Radiologically detectable tumor regrowth occurred in only one patient, who was in the subtotal resection group. Near-total resection of acoustic tumor was not associated with radiologic evidence of regrowth of tumor for the period of observation. Within the limits of the follow-up period of this study, subtotal resection of acoustic neuroma in elderly patients was not associated with clinically significant recurrence in most patients and produced highly satisfactory rates of facial preservation with low surgical morbidity. 
Torsades de pointes occurring in association with terfenadine use. Torsades de pointes is a form of polymorphic ventricular tachycardia that is associated with prolongation of the QT interval. Although found in many clinical settings, torsades de pointes is most often drug induced. This report describes the first association (exclusive of drug overdose) of symptomatic torsades de pointes occurring with the use of terfenadine in a patient who was taking the recommended prescribed dose of this drug in addition to cefaclor, ketoconazole, and medroxyprogesterone. Measured serum concentrations of terfenadine and its main metabolite showed excessive levels of parent terfenadine and proportionately reduced concentrations of metabolite, suggesting inhibition of terfenadine metabolism. We believe that a drug interaction between terfenadine and ketoconazole resulted in the elevated terfenadine levels in plasma and in the cardiotoxicity previously seen only in cases of terfenadine overdose. 
Asymptomatic celiac and superior mesenteric artery stenoses are more prevalent among patients with unsuspected renal artery stenoses. The prevalence of unsuspected renal artery stenosis among patients with peripheral vascular disease has been reported to be as high as 40%, but the prevalence of asymptomatic celiac and superior mesenteric artery stenoses in these patients is not known. The biplane aortograms of 205 male patients who were military veterans and had aneurysms or occlusive disease were independently reviewed, and medical records were studied to determine associated coronary disease, risk factors, and patient outcome. Fifty-six patients (27%) had a 50% or greater stenosis in the celiac or superior mesenteric artery, and seven patients (3.4%) had significant stenoses in both mesenteric arteries. Patients with celiac or superior mesenteric artery stenoses were older (p = 0.002) and had a higher prevalence of hypertension (p = 0.029) than those without significant mesenteric stenoses. Fifty of the 205 patients had significant renal artery stenoses, and 20 had advanced (greater than 75% diameter loss) renal stenoses. Ten of the 20 patients (50%) with advanced renal stenoses had a concomitant celiac artery stenosis, compared to 40 of the 185 patients (22%) who did not have advanced renal stenoses (p = 0.011). In the present study asymptomatic celiac or superior mesenteric artery stenoses were common among male veterans evaluated for peripheral vascular disease, but the prevalence of significant stenoses in both the celiac and superior mesenteric arteries was low. The prevalence of significant celiac stenosis was higher in patients with advanced (greater than 75%) renal artery stenoses who might be considered for prophylactic renal revascularization. Lateral aortography with evaluation of the celiac artery is always appropriate in these patients. 
Brain-stem auditory evoked responses in 56 patients with acoustic neurinoma. The brain-stem auditory evoked responses (BAER's) recorded from 56 patients with acoustic neurinomas were analyzed. Ten of the patients had intracanalicular tumors and 46 had extracanalicular tumors. It was possible to obtain BAER's following stimulation of the affected side in 28 patients and after stimulation of the unaffected side in all 56. Five patients (11%) had normal BAER's following stimulation of both sides; three of these patients had intracanalicular tumors. Among BAER's obtained following stimulation of the affected ear, the mean interpeak latency (IPL) for peaks I to III associated with extracanalicular tumors was significantly prolonged relative to controls (p less than 0.001), and linear regression analysis revealed a significant positive correlation between tumor size and IPL of peaks I to III (p less than 0.05). Analysis of the 56 BAER's recorded after stimulation of the unaffected side revealed a significant positive correlation between the IPL's of peaks III to V and tumor size (p less than 0.001). This correlation was not strengthened when accounting for the degree of brain-stem compression. Finally, evidence of preserved function within the auditory pathway, even in the presence of partial hearing loss, is presented. This finding suggests that more patients might benefit from surgical procedures that spare the eighth cranial nerve. 
First heterotransplantation of a human carcinoid tumor into nude mice. The first successful heterotransplantation of a human carcinoid tumor into nude mice is reported. CSH, a voluminous hepatic metastasis of a primary bronchial carcinoid tumor (CSB) was resected and transplanted into three irradiated nude (Swiss-nu/nu) mice both by subcutaneous (SC) and intramuscular (IM) routes; the success rate was five of six. Heterotransplanted tumors took 4 to 5 months to appear in the mice and 1 month to attain a width of 0.5 cm. Both human and mouse tumors (named CSH-SC and CSH-IM) were studied by light and electron microscopy. They were Grimelius-positive, neuron-specific enolase-positive, and bombesin-negative by immunocytochemistry. Furthermore, CSH-SC cells presented characteristic (pear-shaped, rod-shaped, or tadpole-shaped) neurosecretory granules. Although CSB and CSH were slightly serotonin positive by immunocytochemistry, only a few serotonin-positive cells were found in CSH-SC and none in CSH-IM, suggesting partial loss of differentiation or an increase in serotonin catabolism during transplantation. 
A prospective evaluation of the immediate reproducibility of the signal-averaged ECG. The purpose of this investigation was to prospectively evaluate the immediate reproducibility of the signal-averaged electrocardiogram (SAECG). A total of 114 patients undergoing evaluation for ventricular arrhythmias were enrolled in this protocol. Two consecutive SAECG's (40 Hz bidirectional high-pass filtering with a computer-automated system) were performed 10 minutes apart. Abnormal SAECG parameters were defined as (1) vector QRS duration more than 120 msec, (2) terminal root mean square (RMS) voltage less than 20 microV, and (3) low-amplitude signal (LAS) duration more than 40 msec. An SAECG was defined as abnormal if at least one vector parameter was abnormal. There was close correlation between vector parameters during the two SAECG observations: QRS duration had the highest reproducibility (r2 = 0.97, p less than 0.001) followed by terminal RMS voltage (r2 = 0.92, p less than 0.001), and LAS duration (r2 = 0.90, p less than 0.001). The mean (+/- SD) percentage of change between the two recordings was 2% +/- 2% of the QRS duration, 13% +/- 22% for terminal RMS voltage, and 7% +/- 11% for LAS duration. The reproducibility of an initially normal SAECG was 92% and of an initially abnormal SAECG, 96%. Seventeen patients (15%) had a change in one of the three vector parameters between the two recordings. There were no clinically significant differences between the 17 patients in whom the SAECG was nonreproducible and the 97 patients in whom the SAECG was reproducible. However, reproducibility was significantly higher in patients with an initially normal versus an initially abnormal SAECG (92% vs 76%, p = 0.03). 
Hypertension, lipoprotein(a), and apolipoprotein A-I as risk factors for stroke in the Chinese. We analyzed the serum concentrations of lipids and lipoproteins and the prevalence of other risk factors in a case-control study of 304 consecutive Chinese patients with acute stroke (classified as cerebral infarction, lacunar infarction, or intracerebral hemorrhage) and 304 age- and sex-matched controls. For all strokes we identified the following risk factors: a history of ischemic heart disease, diabetes mellitus, or hypertension; the presence of atrial fibrillation or left ventricular hypertrophy; a glycosylated hemoglobin A1 concentration of greater than 9.1%; a fasting plasma glucose concentration 3 months after stroke of greater than 6.0 mmol/l; a serum triglyceride concentration 3 months after stroke of greater than 2.1 mmol/l; and a serum lipoprotein(a) concentration of greater than 29.2 mg/dl. We found the following protective factors: a serum high density lipoprotein-cholesterol concentration of greater than 1.59 mmol/l and a serum apolipoprotein A-I concentration of greater than or equal to 106 mg/dl. The patterns of risk factors differed among the three stroke subtypes. When significant risk factors were entered into a multiple logistic regression model, we found a history of hypertension, a high serum lipoprotein(a) concentration, and a low apolipoprotein A-I concentration to be independent risk factors for all strokes. The attributable risk for hypertension was estimated to be 24% in patients aged greater than or equal to 60 years. In this population, in which cerebrovascular diseases are the third commonest cause of mortality, identification of risk factors will allow further studies in risk factor modification for the prevention of stroke. 
Prevalence of air bronchograms in small peripheral carcinomas of the lung on thin-section CT: comparison with benign tumors. Despite improved techniques--such as bronchoscopy and percutaneous needle biopsy--to evaluate pulmonary nodules, there are still many cases in which surgical resection is necessary before carcinoma can be differentiated from benign lesions. The present study was undertaken to determine if the presence of an air bronchogram or air bronchiologram (patent visible bronchus or bronchiole) is useful in distinguishing small lung cancers from benign nodules. Thin-section chest CT scans were obtained in patients with 20 peripheral lung cancers less than 2 cm in diameter (18 adenocarcinomas, one squamous cell carcinoma, and one large cell carcinoma) and 20 small benign nodules (eight hamartomas, seven tuberculomas, two foci of aspergillosis, one focus of cryptococcosis, one chronic focal interstitial pneumonitis, and one plasma cell granuloma). The images were compared with regard to the patency of any bronchus or bronchiole within the lesions. After surgical resection, the specimens were inflated with agar and sectioned transversely to correlate gross morphology and low-power histologic sections with the CT appearance. An air bronchogram or air bronchiologram was seen in the tumors on 65% of CT scans and 70% of histologic sections. Benign nodules had a patent bronchus or bronchiole on CT scans and histologic sections in only one case (5%). These findings suggest that the presence of an air bronchogram in a lung nodule is a useful finding to help differentiate adenocarcinomas from benign lesions. 
Long-term spinal administration of morphine in cancer and non-cancer pain: a retrospective study. Records of 313 patients who had been treated with spinal morphine via an implanted Port-A-Cath were reviewed. In 284 cases the Port-A-Cath was implanted for epidural delivery of morphine in patients with cancer-related pain. These patients were treated for a mean of 96 (range 1-1215) days. There was a wide variation in dose requirements, minimum daily dose ranging from 0.5 to 200 mg and maximum daily dose from 1 to 3072 mg. However, there was no clear trend to increasing dose as period of epidural morphine administration increased. The most frequent complications were pain on injection (12.0% incidence), occlusion of the portal system (10.9%), infection (8.1%) and leakage of administered morphine such that it did not all reach the epidural space (2.1%). In all but 1 case infections were limited to the area around the portal or along the catheter track. All infections resolved without sequelae following removal of the portal and/or administration of antibiotics. In 17 patients Port-A-Caths were implanted for the intrathecal delivery of morphine to control cancer-related pain. These patients also exhibited wide variations in morphine dose requirements. Port-A-Caths were also implanted for delivery of spinal morphine in 12 patients with chronic pain which was not related to cancer and which failed to respond to other therapies. These patients were treated for a mean of 155 (range 2-575) days. Port-A-Caths were removed from 7 of these patients, primarily due to infection (2 cases) and inadequate pain relief and pain on injection (2 cases). 
Real-time ultrasound for the detection of deep venous thrombosis. PURPOSE: Accurate diagnosis of deep venous thrombosis (DVT) is a clinical problem in emergency practice. A prospective trial was conducted comparing real-time ultrasound with contrast venography in the diagnosis of proximal DVT. METHODS: Seventy patients whose clinical presentations mandated diagnostic evaluation for DVT had real-time ultrasound of the involved leg followed by contrast venography. Initial readings of ultrasound and venography were compared with each other and with final readings to assess reliability of interpretation. RESULTS: Final ultrasound readings agreed with final venogram readings in all patients. Negative initial ultrasound readings agreed with final venogram readings in 56 of 56 patients (negative predictive value, 100%; 95% confidence interval, 94 to 100). Eighteen patients had positive initial ultrasound readings compared with 14 who had positive final venogram readings (positive predictive value, 78%; 95% confidence interval, 55 to 91). CONCLUSION: Negative real-time ultrasonography reliably excludes proximal DVT. Positive ultrasound reliably diagnoses proximal DVT only in experienced hands. 
Single- versus dual-chamber sensor-driven pacing: comparison of cardiac outputs. Previous studies have shown that single-chamber sensor-driven pacing improves exercise tolerance for patients with chronotropic incompetence. However, long-term single-chamber pacing has a number of inherent problems that limit its usefulness. Although sensor-driven dual-chamber pacing largely obviates the problems inherent with single-chamber sensor-driven pacing, the physiologic benefit of dual-chamber sensor-driven pacing has not yet been demonstrated. Accordingly, the purpose of this study was to compare exercise-induced cardiac output for patients with chronotropic incompetence, after programming their pacemakers to either a simulated sensor-driven single or simulated dual-chamber mode. Cardiac output was measured noninvasively at rest and peak exercise using standard Doppler-derived measurements, obtained in a blinded fashion. At rest the Doppler-derived resting VVI and DDD cardiac outputs were 4.49 +/- 0.3 L/min and 4.68 +/- 0.3 L/min, respectively. At peak exercise, the DDD cardiac output was 5.07 +/- 0.5 L/min, whereas the simulated activity VVI and DDD cardiac outputs were 6.33 +/- 0.6 L/min and 7.41 +/- 0.70 L/min, respectively. Analysis of variance showed that there was an overall significant difference in cardiac output from rest to peak exercise (p less than 0.001). However, only the simulated activity DDD cardiac output was significantly different from its respective control value (p less than 0.05). Thus this study shows for the first time that the addition of rate responsiveness to dual-chamber pacing results in a significant improvement in cardiac output for patients with chronotropic incompetence. 
FDP D-dimer induces the secretion of interleukin-1, urokinase-type plasminogen activator, and plasminogen activator inhibitor-2 in a human promonocytic leukemia cell line. We studied the effect of fibrinogen degradation products D, E, and D-dimer on a human promonocytic leukemia cell line, NOMO-1. After exposure to a 10(-5)-mol/L fragment D or D-dimer, the cells displayed macrophage-like characteristics, such as adherence to plastic surfaces, and showed approximately a twofold increase in response to the nitroblue tetrazolium reduction test. The secretion of interleukin-1 alpha (IL-1 alpha) into the medium was markedly stimulated by a 10(-5)-mol/L fragment D, E, and D-dimer, whereas a significant increase in IL-1 beta secretion was observed only in D-dimer-stimulated cells. In addition, D-dimer induced a rapid increase in urokinase-type plasminogen activator on day 1 (0.52 +/- 0.02 ng/mL v 0.07 +/- 0.01 ng/mL in the control culture) and a slow increase in plasminogen activator inhibitor-2 on day 5 (3.9 +/- 1.6 ng/mL v 1.2 +/- 0.2 ng/mL in the control culture). An increase in tissue factor (TF) was also demonstrated on the cell surface of NOMO-1 cells exposed to fragment D or D-dimer by indirect immunofluorescence using an anti-TF monoclonal antibody. Scatchard plot analysis showed that fragment D and D-dimer bound to the NOMO-1 cells with a kd of 3.3 nmol/L and 2.7 nmol/L, respectively. These results suggest that fragment D-dimer specifically stimulates cells of monocyte-macrophage lineage to secrete key substances that regulate blood coagulation, fibrinolysis, and inflammation. 
Stereotactic management of colloid cysts: factors predicting success. Stereotactic aspiration is a valuable surgical alternative for colloid cysts when used alone or in conjunction with microsurgical resection. Since 1981, the authors have performed computerized tomography (CT)-guided stereotactic aspiration as the initial procedure in 22 patients with colloid cysts; stereotactic aspiration alone was successful in 11 patients (50%). Of the 11 patients in whom aspiration failed, stereotactic endoscopic resection was attempted in three and was successful in one. Seven patients required a craniotomy and microsurgical removal of the cyst performed via a transcortical approach. The preoperative CT appearance in eight cases of a hypodense or isodense cyst correlated favorably with successful aspiration of the cyst in six patients. A hyperdense appearance on the preoperative CT scan in 14 cases was associated with subtotal aspiration in 13 patients; five required craniotomy for removal. Preoperative magnetic resonance (MR) imaging in eight patients provided excellent anatomical definition of the cyst and its relationship to other structures of the third ventricle, but it was not possible to correlate successful aspiration with cyst appearance on MR images with short or long relaxation time sequences. The authors' 9-year experience suggests that preoperative CT studies accurately determine size, predict viscosity, and help to define a group of colloid cyst patients for whom stereotactic cyst aspiration will likely be successful. Unsuccessful stereotactic aspiration was related to two features: the high viscosity of the intracystic colloid material (nine patients), or deviation of the cyst away from the aspiration needle due to small cyst volume (two patients). Because of its simplicity and low risk, stereotactic surgery can be offered to selected patients as the initial procedure of choice. Craniotomy can be reserved for those whose imaging studies predict failure or for those whose cyst cannot be aspirated. 
Cranial magnetic resonance imaging in chronic demyelinating polyneuropathy. Twenty one patients with chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyradiculoneuropathy (CIDP) and five patients with chronic demyelinating polyneuropathy associated with benign monoclonal paraproteinaemia none of whom had signs or symptoms of central nervous system disease, had cranial magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) on a 1.5 Tesla unit. Areas of increased white matter signal intensity were seen in one of 10 patients aged less than 50 years and in five of 16 patients aged more than 50 years. In only two of the patients (8%), neither of whom had paraproteinaemia, did the appearance strongly suggest demyelination. The only clinical variable that predicted MRI changes was age (p less than 0.01). 
Bleeding patterns during continuous combined estrogen-progestogen therapy. Bleeding and climacteric symptoms were recorded in two groups of postmenopausal women receiving either continuous combined estradiol and norethisterone acetate or estradiol and cyproterone acetate. Out of a sample of 99 postmenopausal women aged 45 to 54 years, 86 completed a 2-year, double-blind, placebo-controlled study. Comparison of the bleeding patterns in the two groups revealed a statistically significant difference: More women in the estradiol-cyproterone acetate group experienced bleeding and for a longer duration. Thirteen women in the estradiol-norethisterone acetate group were amenorrheic, compared with two in the other group. The Kupperman index score in both groups declined to about 30% to 40% of initial values (p less than 0.001). The hot flushes in both treatment groups decreased to a highly significant degree (p less than 0.001), to a value below 20% of baseline values. We conclude that a continuous combination of estrogen and progestogen can produce amenorrhea and symptomatic relief. However, the progestogen components seem to differ in their ability to control bleeding. 
Impaired hepatic handling and processing of lysophosphatidylcholine in rats with liver cirrhosis. Lysophosphatidylcholine is a major metabolic product in the plasma and cellular turnover of phospholipids, with well-known membrane-toxic and proinflammatory properties. Because the liver plays a key role in plasma lysophosphatidylcholine removal and biotransformation and because virtually nothing is known of these processes in a diseased organ, the hepatobiliary metabolism of lysophosphatidylcholine was investigated in rats with carbon tetrachloride-induced liver cirrhosis. Twelve adult male Wistar rats with histologically confirmed cirrhosis and 8 control animals were fitted with jugular and biliary catheters and allowed to recover. The animals were kept under constant IV infusion of taurocholate (1 mumol/min). Two microcuries of sn-1[14C]palmitoyl-lysophosphatidylcholine was administered as a single bolus. The fate of the injected radioactivity, including removal from plasma, uptake, and subcellular location in the liver and molecular and aggregative forms, was studied by combined chromatographic and radiochemical methods. Major findings were (a) that lysophosphatidylcholine has a prolonged permanence in plasma of cirrhotic rats, due both to decreased hepatic clearance and to depressed conversion into phosphatidylcholine; (b) that the rate of lysophosphatidylcholine acylation is much slower in the cirrhotic than in the normal liver, both at the microsomal and at the cytosolic level; (c) that cytosolic lysophosphatidylcholine in the cirrhotic liver, but not in the normal liver, is predominantly non-protein bound; (d) that the strict molecular selectivity of lysophosphatidylcholine acylation observed in controls is partially lost in cirrhosis; and (e) that a consistent fraction of lysophosphatidylcholine is converted into triacylglycerols in cirrhotics but not in controls. These findings show a profound derangment of lysophosphatidylcholine handling and processing in the cirrhotic liver, which is of potential pathogenetic significance. 
The value of single versus multiple sections for detection of lymph node metastasis. This study was undertaken to determine the value of serial sectioning of lymph nodes as an aid in optimally examining cervical specimens for metastasis. The presence or absence of lymph node metastasis in 802 lymph nodes obtained from 51 consecutive neck dissection specimens were initially determined by the routine method, examination of one section from each node. This examination revealed 40 lymph nodes with metastatic involvement. Further study of the 716 lymph nodes that were initially interpreted as free of tumor by serial sectioning added only two positive nodes. Thus, serial sectioning did not contribute significantly to the detection of lymph node metastasis. 
Cytotoxic activity in plasma from patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. The present study evaluates an assay of cytotoxic effect of plasma from patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. Plasma from 20 recently diagnosed ALS patients induced hemolysis of normal red blood cells with a significantly greater intensity than that of normal controls. After at least 1 month of treatment with prednisone and azathioprine, the hemolytic activity of ALS plasma was reduced but was still higher than that of control plasma. 
Multiple giant cell tumors and Paget disease of bone: radiographic and clinical correlations. The clinical and radiographic findings of four patients with multicentric giant cell tumor (GCT) of bone and Paget disease were retrospectively reviewed. Three patients underwent magnetic resonance (MR) imaging evaluation; all patients underwent computed tomography (CT). The MR characteristics of the bone component in pagetic GCT appeared to reflect the pagetic phase; a sclerotic pattern was largely represented by hypointense marrow signal intensity on images obtained with both long and short repetition times (TRs) and echo times (TEs). Conversely, a tumor appearing in a mixed pagetic phase demonstrated more heterogeneous signal intensity with all pulse sequences. Extensive soft-tissue components, noted in all cases, showed largely intermediate signal intensity on short TR/TE images and foci of increased signal intensity on longer TR/TE images. In most cases, dramatic reduction in tumor bulk was noted with the use of steroids alone. An awareness of this entity is important because the appearance of lytic lesions with soft-tissue extension in patients with Paget disease does not necessarily imply a grave prognosis. Serial CT or MR imaging is helpful in monitoring the remissions and exacerbations that reflect response to therapy in Paget disease and GCT. 
Magnetic resonance assessment of the postoperative spine. Degenerative disc disease. The magnetic resonance (MR) imaging findings in patients after surgery for degenerative disc disease in the lumbar and cervical spine are discussed. In the lumbar spine, changes seen in the immediate postoperative period, use of Gd-DTPA in distinguishing scar and disc and postoperative complications are reviewed. In the cervical spine, operative approaches and types, the appearance of bony stenosis, and disc herniations are demonstrated. 
Urethroplasty using the pedicled island flap technique in complicated urethral strictures. Many techniques have been described for the repair of recurrent urethral strictures. Experience with 1-stage correction of hypospadias and epispadias, using a vascularized island flap technique, has led to its increased application for complicated adult urethral strictures. The advantage of the vascularized island flap technique is that reconstruction can be completed with only 1 operation, and it provides good subjective and objective results. Analysis of 50 consecutive cases treated by this approach has proved its validity. Of the 50 cases fistulas occurred in 20%, of which 12% required surgical correction, and stricture recurred in 32%. The largest proportion of recurrence was noted in patients who were primarily treated with 3 or more urethrotomies within a short time. Therefore, we recommend open surgical repair when 1 or 2 internal urethrotomies fail to produce a good result. 
Bullous pemphigoid autoantibodies, HIV-1 infection and pruritic papular eruption. Bullous pemphigoid (BP)-type autoantibodies were found by Western blot (WB) analysis of epidermal extracts in the serum of 38% of HIV-seropositive patients compared with 21% of HIV-seronegative patients with chronic pruritus and 76% of patients with BP. They were further identified as BP autoantibodies (BPab) by immunoprecipitation and immunoelectron microscopy. Their incidence increased from 21% in HIV infection stage II to 37% and 43% in stages III and IV, respectively. Of the patients suffering from HIV-related chronic pruritic papulovesicular eruption. 75% showed circulating BPab as compared with 29% in those without skin problems (P = 0.0066) and, among them, 30% met the diagnostic criteria for BP when histology, WB, immunofluorescence and immunoelectron microscopy techniques were used. In conclusion, this study identifies an autoimmune skin reaction that may account for, or be related to, the distressing pruritic eruptions occurring in HIV-infected patients. 
Molecular characterization of a region of DNA associated with mutations at the agouti locus in the mouse. Molecular characterization of a radiation-induced agouti (a)-locus mutation has resulted in the isolation of a segment of DNA that maps at or near the a locus on chromosome 2 in the mouse. This region of DNA is deleted in several radiation- or chemical-induced homozygous-lethal a-locus mutations and is associated with specific DNA structural alterations in two viable a-locus mutations. We propose that DNA probes from this region of chromosome 2 will be useful for ultimately characterizing the individual gene or genes associated with a-locus function. 
Fatty acids in human platelets and plasma. Fish oils decrease sensitivity toward N2 microbubbles. Platelet aggregation induced by N2 microbubbles (simulating microbubbles developed during deep diving) was measured in seven volunteers before and after intake of ethyl-eicosapentaenoate (-EPA, 3.5 g/day) and ethyl-docosahexaenoate (-DHA, 2.5 g/day) for 2 wk. The relative content of arachidonic acid (AA) decreased in platelets from all individuals, whereas the content of EPA and DHA increased. The decrease of AA was almost identical with the increase of EPA plus DHA. In plasma the AA content was unchanged, while EPA and DHA increased. The N2 microbubble-induced aggregation showed a significant negative correlation with the DHA content both in platelets and in plasma. Less aggregation was also observed with high EPA content in platelets or plasma. A significant correlation between AA content in platelets and aggregation was seen. Intake of marine oils may be beneficial to divers under deep diving and to patients during extracorporeal circulation, because this may reduce the microbubble-induced aggregation. 
Midventricular obstruction associated with chronic systemic hypertension and severe left ventricular hypertrophy. Midventricular obstruction is an uncommon finding previously defined by catheterization and angiographic techniques in patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. This study describes the clinical and echocardiographic findings of 10 consecutive patients (mean age 73 years) with severe concentric left ventricular (LV) hypertrophy and the unusual finding of a dynamic systolic obstruction located in the midportion of the left ventricle. All patients were known to have chronic hypertension, and none had a history or family history of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. In each case, a well-defined, high velocity, turbulent jet was identified by Doppler color flow imaging and subsequently confirmed with conventional Doppler techniques. Septal and posterior wall thickness averaged 1.67 and 1.57 cm, respectively. Mean LV mass index was 199 g/m2 and ejection fraction averaged 78%. Peak systolic velocity obtained by continuous-wave Doppler averaged 2.7 m/s and appeared as either a "late-peaking" or a "spike and dome" configuration. Seven of 10 patients gave a history of syncope or severe presyncope at the time of echocardiographic examination. At a mean follow-up of 1 year, syncope or presyncope had resolved in 5 patients in whom medication was adjusted based on the ultrasound study, but persisted in 2 patients in whom diuretic therapy was continued. It is concluded that obstruction to systolic flow can occur at the mid-LV level in some patients with severe concentric LV hypertrophy and avoidance of medication known to lower LV volume may relieve symptoms of transient inadequate cardiac output. 
The impact of nonidentical ABO cadaveric renal transplantation on waiting times and graft survival. Blood type O recipients of cadaveric renal transplants have longer pretransplant waiting periods than blood type A, B, and AB recipients. To evaluate reasons for and consequences of this discrepancy, we studied both the frequency of various donor and recipient blood type combinations and their outcomes. Among 37,659 cadaveric renal transplants performed during 1983 through 1989, there were 2,625 transplants (7%) received by patients of compatible but nonidentical blood types. Of 18,575 type O donor organs, 16,784 were received by type O patients for a recipient to donor ratio of 0.9. The corresponding ratios were greater than 1.0 for all other blood types (1.02 for blood type A, 1.14 for type B, and 2.18 for type AB). This causes blood type O patients to have a lower access to transplantation and to have significantly longer waiting times than patients of all other blood types. This inequality of access diminished significantly (P less than 0.001) over the years, but did not resolve by 1989. Analysis of relative risk for first graft loss by multiple regression (Cox) showed that transplantation across compatible blood types had a 9.1% higher risk (P less than 0.1) than that of transplantation among identical blood types. Cadaveric renal transplantation within identical blood types optimizes access to transplantation and avoids further aggravating past disadvantages for blood type O recipients. 
Results of a recently instituted programme of thrombolytic therapy in acute lower limb ischaemia. Twenty-eight patients with acute lower limb ischaemia received low dose intra-arterial thrombolytic therapy over a 2-year period. Eighteen patients received streptokinase and ten patients received recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (rTPA). Indications included arterial thromboemboli and graft failures. Mean ischaemic times were similar in both groups. Treatment time to achieve lysis was significantly less with rTPA (P less than 0.01). Subsequent vascular procedures, including angioplasty or reconstruction, were undertaken in 36 per cent of patients. Arterial puncture site bleeding occurred in eight (29 per cent) patients. Three (11 per cent) patients suffered rethrombosis after initial successful lysis. All rethromboses were successfully lysed with rTPA. There were two major amputations. Five (18 per cent) patients died, all lytic failures in the streptokinase treatment group. There were no cerebral haemorrhagic events and no patient died as a result of thrombolytic therapy. Good clinical outcome was obtained in nine of 18 patients treated with streptokinase and in nine of ten patients treated with rTPA. Intra-arterial thrombolysis provides effective therapy with high rates of limb salvage and a low mortality rate. This study suggests that rTPA may be a more effective agent, causing less morbidity, than streptokinase. 
Metastatic melanoma to the heart presenting with ventricular tachycardia. Intraventricular tumors in adults are uncommon, and the association of these with ventricular tachycardia is even more rare. We report a case of an intracardiac metastatic melanoma in a woman who presented with syncope due to ventricular tachycardia. 
Risk stratification after myocardial infarction. Clinical overview. Many patients with an acute myocardial infarction can be stratified into subgroups that are at high risk for morbidity and mortality on the basis of clinical characteristics that indicate recurrent myocardial ischemia, persistent left ventricular dysfunction, and/or recurrent cardiac arrhythmias. In patients with uncomplicated myocardial infarction the assessment of symptoms, physical findings, and ECG changes during predischarge exercise testing often identifies patients at increased risk for further cardiac events. Because of the suboptimum sensitivity and specificity of the exercise ECG for detecting myocardial ischemia, myocardial perfusion imaging with 201Tl and/or assessment of global and segmental ventricular function by two-dimensional echocardiography or radionuclide cineangiography during or immediately after exercise are often added to the predischarge risk stratification. 
Recurrent pericarditis and cardiac tamponade in a patient with hypocomplementemic urticarial vasculitis syndrome. We describe a patient with hypocomplementemic urticarial vasculitis syndrome complicated by recurrent pericarditis and cardiac tamponade. The episodes of pericarditis were associated with urticarial vasculitis, hypocomplementemia, and circulating IgG antibodies to the collagen-like region of Clq. Histopathologic examination of the skin and pericardium demonstrated vasculitis associated with immunoglobulin and complement deposition suggesting an immune complex mediated etiology. Recurrent pericarditis should be included in the clinical spectrum of hypocomplementemic urticarial vasculitis syndrome. 
Symptomatic benefit of supplemental oxygen in hypoxemic patients with chronic lung disease. We have compared the symptomatic benefit of air and oxygen at rest in hypoxemic patients with chronic obstructive airway disease (COAD) or interstitial lung disease (ILD). A total of 12 severely disabled patients with COAD (mean +/- SEM, PaO2, 50.3 +/- 3.7 mm Hg) and 10 with ILD (PaO2, 48.0 +/- 3.1 mm Hg) received 28% oxygen and air by Venturi face mask, each gas on two occasions, in a double-blind randomized fashion. SaO2 increased (p less than 0.01) in both groups during oxygen breathing: COAD, 85.1 +/- 2.3% versus 93.1 +/- 1.4%; ILD, 85.5 +/- 1.7% versus 94.7 +/- 0.9%. The patients with COAD stated that air helped their breathing on 15 of 24 occasions and that oxygen helped on 22 of 24 occasions (p less than 0.05). In the patients with ILD the values were 6 of 20 and 13 of 20 occasions, respectively (p less than 0.05). In both groups of patients the severity of breathlessness recorded on a 100-mm visual analog scale was significantly (p less than 0.05) lower during oxygen breathing: COAD, 29.6 +/- 4.5 versus 45.6 +/- 6.0; ILD, 30.2 +/- 5.1 versus 48.1 +/- 4.4. Ventilation measured by magnetometers was significantly lower during oxygen breathing in the patients with COAD (8.2 +/- 1.0 versus 9.3 +/- 1.1 L/min; p less than 0.05), but the difference between oxygen and air in patients with ILD was not statistically significant (9.3 +/- 1.3 versus 11.2 +/- 1.6 L/min; p greater than 0.05). 
Mitomycin C as an adjuvant treatment to resected gastric cancer. A 10-year follow-up. Seventy consecutive patients were entered in a two-arm randomized trial after surgical resection for locally advanced gastric cancer. In the first arm, 37 patients were included as a control group, receiving no further treatment after surgery. In the second arm, 33 patients were treated with adjuvant chemotherapy consisting of mitomycin C (MMC), 20 mg/m2 administered intravenously once every 6 weeks for four consecutive cycles. All patients in both arms were followed in the same way for 5 years. At 5 years 23 of 37 patients in the control arm and 7 of 33 patients in the treatment arm were dead because of relapse. Actuarial survival curve was statistically significant in favor of patients given adjuvant MMC (p less than 0.001). After 10 years follow-up, 31 of 37 patients in the control arm and 16 out of 33 patients in the treatment arm were dead because of relapse, the statistical differences continuing in the actuarial survival curve in favor of treated patients (p less than 0.01). The best advantages of adjuvant treatment were observed in the T3N0M0 stage. The most frequent relapse site was the peritoneal cavity and the relapse pattern shows special decrease in liver metastases in treated patients. Toxicity was acute and mild. No delayed toxicity or second malignancies were observed. These data suggest that adjuvant MMC after resected surgery of gastric cancer is a successful treatment and its effects are still evident after 10 years of follow-up. 
Mucin-producing tumor of the pancreas. A new pancreatic tumor, called mucin-producing tumor, has received great attention in Japan. These tumors are found inside the pancreatic duct and produce large quantities of copious mucus. The authors examined 22 cases of these tumors histologically and histochemically. In 12 malignant cases, the tumors inside the ducts consisted of cancerous lesions over small areas along with papillary or atypical hyperplasia. Tumors in ten benign cases mainly consisted of papillary hyperplasia. Except for three patients with carcinoma in situ, cancerous tumors infiltrated the pancreatic parenchyma and, in some cases, were observed invading the bile duct or duodenum. A mucous histochemical study showed evidence of sialomucin in malignant cases; neutral mucin was dominant in benign cases. Characteristics of this disease were also compared with 13 cases of mucinous cystic neoplasm. From the results, it was concluded that these two diseases can be classified into the same conceptual category. 
A rat model of acute liver necrosis induced by a monoclonal antibody to liver-specific antigen and complement. Acute massive hepatic injury was induced in rats by a monoclonal antibody against a rat liver-specific membrane antigen, and its histological characteristics were investigated. A single intravenous injection of murine ascites containing a monoclonal antibody produced numerous hemorrhagic foci of degenerated and necrotic liver cells predominantly in zones 1 (the periportal area) and 2 (the area of transition between the periportal zone and the perivenular zone) of the liver lobule within 10 min. Massive hepatocellular necroses were observed 1 hr later, but no inflammatory cell infiltration occurred in and around the necrotic foci. Immunohistological study demonstrated marked deposition of the third component of the complement system in the necrotic area. Serum complement activity was sharply decreased immediately after the injection of the antibody, suggesting that the hepatic necrosis is ascribable to a complement-mediated immune attack on the liver cell membrane induced by the antigen-antibody reaction. The hepatic necrosis in response to monoclonal-antibody injection did not progress to a chronic disease and healed almost completely, changing to scar tissues within 2 wk. Although it is not clear whether this hepatic injury has any clinical relevance, this antibody/complement model may be useful for investigating the cause and therapy of hepatic diseases such as fulminant hepatitis. 
Preserved action of a rectus muscle after transection by an encircling solid silicone band. We present a case of anterior migration of a solid silicone band through a lateral rectus muscle. In this patient the action of the lateral rectus was preserved, and this is demonstrated photographically. The possible reasons for this rare complication and the possible mechanism by which lateral rectus activity remained intact are explained. 
Clinical features of Behcet's disease. Report of four cases. Behcet's disease is a multisystem inflammatory disorder of unknown etiology. The unifying histologic reaction pattern is a leukocytoclastic vasculitis that affects predominantly the skin, oral mucosa, and eyes. Many other sites of involvement have been reported but are inconsistently found in individual patients. Early recognition and treatment of Behcet's disease may help prevent devastating permanent sequelae such as blindness. Because oral involvement is often the first manifestation of this disorder, dental practitioners are in a unique position to help these patients. We report four cases of Behcet's disease in North American patients. Diagnostic criteria and treatment options are reviewed. 
Recombinant granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor after autologous bone marrow transplantation for lymphoid cancer. BACKGROUND. The period of neutropenia after autologous bone marrow transplantation results in substantial morbidity and mortality. The results of previous phase I-II clinical trials suggest that recombinant human granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (rhGM-CSF) may accelerate neutrophil recovery and thereby reduce complications in patients after autologous bone marrow transplantation. METHODS. We conducted a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial at three institutions. The study design and treatment schedules were identical, and the results were pooled for analysis. One hundred twenty-eight patients were enrolled. Sixty-five patients received rhGM-CSF in a two-hour intravenous infusion daily for 21 days, starting within four hours of the marrow infusion, and 63 patients received placebo. RESULTS. No toxic effects specifically ascribed to rhGM-CSF were observed. The patients given rhGM-CSF had a recovery of the neutrophil count to 500 x 10(6) per liter 7 days earlier than the patients who received placebo (19 vs. 26 days, P less than 0.001), had fewer infections, required 3 fewer days of antibiotic administration (24 vs. 27 days, P = 0.009), and required 6 fewer days of initial hospitalization (median, 27 vs. 33 days; P = 0.01). There was no difference in the survival rate at day 100. CONCLUSIONS. In patients undergoing autologous bone marrow transplantation for lymphoid neoplasia, rhGM-CSF significantly lessens morbidity. Further studies will be required to establish its optimal dosage and schedule of administration. 
Candida tropicalis and Candida albicans fungemia in children with leukemia. The records were reviewed for all patients hospitalized at a pediatric oncology center for complications of leukemia (n = 822) or lymphoma (n = 290) during an 8-year period. The results of surveillance cultures (throat, rectal, and urine) and blood cultures were analyzed to identify cases of Candida tropicalis and C. albicans colonization and/or fungemia. None of the patients with lymphoma who had positive surveillance cultures for C. albicans (n = 89) or C. tropicalis (n = 23) had fungemia. Among patients with leukemia, significant fungal infection was documented in 12 of 107 colonized with C. tropicalis (11.2%) versus 14 of 700 (2%) colonized with C. albicans (P less than 0.001). The two groups of children with fungemia were similar in primary diagnoses (predominantly acute lymphoblastic leukemia) and in the frequency of several known risk factors for infection, including the duration of neutropenia (absolute neutrophil counts, less than 500/microliters). Patients with C. tropicalis fungemia all had disseminated disease compared with nine of 14 patients with C. albicans fungemia. Also, subcutaneous abscesses were unique to patients with C. tropicalis in this series. Two patients in each group died of their infection; central nervous system involvement was present in both fatal cases of C. tropicalis fungemia. A high index of suspicion and the early institution of appropriate antifungal therapy are critical to the successful management of these infections in patients with leukemia. 
Prognostic importance of collateral flow and residual coronary stenosis of the myocardial infarct artery after anterior wall Q-wave acute myocardial infarction. Residual high-grade coronary stenosis and collateral flow are frequent findings in the chronic phase after a Q-wave acute myocardial infarction (AMI). The prognostic importance of a residual stenosis of the infarct artery and of collateral flow to the infarct area was analyzed in a group of 102 young patients (mean age 35 years, range 22 to 39) who had survived an anterior wall Q-wave AMI. Patients whose only significant lesion (greater than 50% luminal diameter reduction) was in the proximal portion of the left anterior descending artery were enrolled in the study. A 50 to 74% diameter stenosis was present in 33 of 102 patients (32%), 43 (42%) had a 75 to 99% stenosis and 26% had a total occlusion of the infarct vessel. Collateral vessels, which were evaluated by a scoring system, were present in 52 of 102 patients (51%). Four percent had only faint (score 1), 17 of 102 patients (17%) had moderate and 32 patients (31%) had good collateral flow (score greater than 4). The 8-year cumulative mortality was 15.2%--an eightfold increase compared with the age-matched general population. No patient with less than 75% stenosis died during follow-up, whereas the cumulative 8-year mortality was 23 and 17% in patients with a 75 to 99% stenosis or total occlusion, respectively (p less than 0.01). Patients with at least moderate collateral flow had a mortality rate of 21%, versus 8% for patients without or with faint collateral flow (p less than 0.05). 
Late bleeding after rhytidectomy from injury to the superficial temporal vessels. Five healthy, normotensive women, whose mean age was 49.8 years, developed expanding hematomas between 8 and 10 days (average 9 days) after rhytidectomy. In each patient, the bleeding vessel could be identified: In two, it was the parietal branch of the superficial temporal artery; in two, it was the parietal branch of the superficial temporal vein; and in one, it was the superficial temporal artery immediately before its branching. Contributing factors may have been sudden physical exertion in four of the five patients and in another salicylate ingestion. Several measures can help avoid late bleeding from the superficial temporal vessels or their branches; not using a too potent vasoconstrictive agent (epinephrine) in the local anesthetic so that the vessels will be easier to visualize; not injecting the local anesthetic too deeply or incising to deeply; dividing and ligating the superficial temporal vessel and its major branches if injured; using bipolar coagulation on small branches; and instructing patients repeatedly not to engage in strenuous activity or to ingest salicylates for at least 2 weeks after operation. 
Dietary fiber and bowel function in tube-fed patients. In tube-fed patients, dietary fiber is often used to manage constipation/diarrhea. Dietary fiber consists of water-soluble and insoluble plant compounds that are resistant to digestion by small-bowel enzymes but are fermented to varying degrees by colonic bacteria. Many physiologic effects of fiber may be related to the degree of fermentation. Few controlled studies of fiber-containing tube feedings have been performed. These studies have limitations and are nondefinitive as to whether fiber prevents or controls constipation/diarrhea. Constipation in tube-fed patients has not been shown to respond to mixed soluble/insoluble fiber in the few studies performed to date. Likewise, fiber may be of only limited benefit in controlling diarrhea in acute illness because of such factors as stress or medication. Fiber does play a role in maintaining gut integrity in all patients, whether they have diarrhea or not. Fiber may be recommended as part of a standard tube-feeding regimen to help assure gut mucosal integrity but not specifically to treat constipation/diarrhea. Further studies are necessary before the role of fiber in the management of constipation/diarrhea in tube-fed patients is determined. 
Hepatosplenic candidiasis: successful treatment with fluconazole. PURPOSE: To determine if fluconazole is effective treatment for hepatosplenic candidiasis that has not resolved with amphotericin B and flucytosine treatment. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Six patients (ages 3 to 44) with acute leukemia and hepatosplenic candidiasis who did not respond to prior antifungal therapy were treated with fluconazole. RESULTS: All six patients had fever and three had nausea and vomiting; computed tomographic (CT) scan showed lucencies in the liver in six, lucencies in the spleen in five, and lucencies in the kidneys in three. Prior therapy with 1.6 to 4 g of amphotericin B in the five adults and 526 mg of amphotericin B in the child (with the addition of flucytosine in four) failed to improve clinical symptoms or lucencies in the liver, spleen, and kidneys seen on CT scan. Fluconazole was given at a dose of 200 to 400 mg daily (70 to 100 mg in the child) for 2 to 14 months. All patients had resolution of fever and other symptoms in 2 to 8 weeks. Improvement of the lesions noted on CT scan was seen in 4 to 8 weeks in all patients. Total resolution of lesions noted on CT scan occurred by 4 weeks in two patients, but took 4 to 5 months for three patients and 13 months for one patient. Three patients had relapse of their acute leukemia and two died, presumably cured of their candidiasis. Two patients underwent successful bone marrow transplantation without relapse of their candidiasis. CONCLUSION: Fluconazole appears to be useful in the treatment of hepatosplenic candidiasis that has not resolved with amphotericin B and flucytosine therapy. 
Abnormal vascular responses to supine exercise in hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. BACKGROUND. Exercise hypotension has been documented in hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. It is not the result of an inability to augment cardiac output but instead relates to an inappropriate and exaggerated decrease in systemic vascular resistance at high work loads. METHODS AND RESULTS. To enable us to examine the behavior of the peripheral vasculature during exercise, 103 consecutive patients underwent maximal symptom-limited supine bicycle exercise with measurement of forearm blood flow. A minimum reduction of 12% from the basal value was defined as a normal response based on the study of 25 normal controls. In the patients, two patterns of forearm blood flow were observed. Sixty-four patients had an appropriate reduction in forearm blood flow of 40 +/- 16% from resting flow. In 39 patients, the forearm blood flow either failed to decrease or increased with exercise by 45 +/- 105% of the resting value. Patients with an abnormal forearm vasodilator response were younger (31 +/- 13 versus 46 +/- 14 years), and more of them had a family history of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy and sudden death than did those with a normal vasoconstrictor response (16 of 39 versus eight of 64). Left ventricular end-diastolic cavity dimensions were smaller in those with an abnormal forearm blood flow response, but other clinical, echocardiographic, and arrhythmic variables were similar. To assess the relation of abnormal peripheral vascular responses to erect exercise blood pressure response, patients underwent treadmill exercise testing with careful monitoring of systolic blood pressure response. Thirty-eight patients had significant exercise hypotension with failure of the systolic blood pressure to increase during progressive exercise (n = 6) or an abrupt decrease in systolic blood pressure (20-60 mm Hg) from the peak value (n = 32); 65 patients had a normal exercise blood pressure response, but 18 of these patients had an oscillation in systolic blood pressure of 10 mm Hg or more early in the recovery phase. Thirty-one of 39 patients with an abnormal forearm blood flow response demonstrated exercise hypotension during the erect exercise testing, and the remaining eight patients had a normal exercise blood pressure response; however, five of these eight had abnormal oscillations in blood pressure during recovery (r = 0.61, p less than 0.001). CONCLUSIONS. The relation of abnormal peripheral vascular responses to exercise hypotension confirms the observation of hemodynamic instability in patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. The finding of abnormal vascular responses in patients known to be at increased risk (young age and a family history of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy and sudden death) suggests that hemodynamic mechanisms may be important in the occurrence of sudden death in hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. 
Surgical intensive care unit resource use in a specialty referral hospital: I. Predictors of early death and cost implications. The rationing of medical care prioritizes the need for early predictors of death in the surgical intensive care unit (SICU). We prospectively studied 100 consecutive SICU admissions, looking for predictors of early death in the SICU and the cost implications of these findings. Serial APACHE II scores on days 1, 3, and 5 were subjected to multinomial logistic regression analysis to determine significant predictors of death in the SICU on day 1. Survivors had significantly lower (p less than 0.05) mean day-1 APACHE II scores than had nonsurvivors (13.6 vs 22.1). Half of the patients with scores greater than 18 died, and all patients with scores on day 1 of 25 or greater died. Significant predictors of death on SICU day 1 were APACHE II scores, Acute Physiology Score, Glasgow Coma Score, creatinine level, and Chronic Health Evaluation Score. Forty-one patients had been transferred from community hospitals as a results of acute illness; this population accounted for two thirds of the deaths in the SICU. Ten of 18 nonsurvivors were predicted on day 1, with these patients incurring a total cost of approximately $1 million. If therapy had been modified on days 5, 10, or 15, the potential cost savings would have been $340,000, $240,000, or $140,000, respectively. Integration of the results of this study into the management decision-making process and treatment guidelines may reduce the cost of care in the SICU. 
Aortoiliac dissection after percutaneous insertion of an intra-aortic balloon pump. Aortic or aortoiliac dissection may complicate percutaneous intra-aortic balloon pump insertion in various ways. Thrombosis can escape clinical recognition if no major obstruction develops. Death due to perforation after dissection is not uncommon. In this case study, aortoiliac dissection led to bilateral iliac artery stenosis, an unusual complication of percutaneous femoral cannulation for insertion of a balloon pump. 
Effects of heart rate and pulmonary artery pressure on Doppler pulmonary artery acceleration time in experimental acute pulmonary hypertension. Chronic pulmonary hypertension in humans is characterized by shortening of the pulmonary artery acceleration time as measured by Doppler echocardiography, such that the higher the pulmonary artery pressure, the shorter the pulmonary acceleration time. Increases in heart rate are also known to produce decreases in the pulmonary artery acceleration time. To explore the relationship between mean pulmonary artery pressure, heart rate, and Doppler pulmonary artery acceleration time, experimental acute pulmonary hypertension was created in nine Duroc swine, either by infusion of Sephadex beads with embolization of the pulmonary arterial circulation or by partially occluding the main pulmonary artery 8 to 10 cm distal to the pulmonic valve. Pulmonary artery Doppler flow velocity recordings and invasive pressure measurements were made at baseline and at paced atrial rates ranging from 60 to 160 beats per minute, in 20-beat increments. The results in this acute animal model reveal that increases in heart rate produced significant decreases in Doppler pulmonary artery acceleration time at mean pressures below 25 mm Hg. However, with mean pulmonary artery pressures greater than 25 mm Hg, both heart rate and increases in pulmonary artery pressure had no significant effect on acceleration time. 
Hypo-fibrinolysis in patients with hypertension and elevated cholesterol. To test the hypothesis that increased blood pressure and hyperlipidaemia result in changes in the fibrinolytic system, 84 subjects with both hypertension and elevated serum cholesterol levels (the high risk group) were compared with 55 controls matched with respect to age, sex and body mass index (BMI). Plasminogen activator inhibitor (PAI-1), and tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) antigen and activity were measured before and after venous occlusion. In the high risk group, tPA activity was significantly lower both before and after venous occlusion and PAI-1 levels were significantly higher. In a multivariate analysis the triglyceride levels, diastolic blood pressure and cholesterol levels were independently associated with the PAI-1 levels. Diastolic blood pressure was independently and inversely associated with resting tPA activity. We conclude that patients with hypertension and hyperlipidaemia have a reduced activity of the fibrinolytic system, an effect which is unrelated to differences in age, sex, smoking or BMI. 
Doppler ultrasound and the silent ductus arteriosus. A clinically undetectable, small ductus arteriosus was identified by Doppler ultrasonography in 21 individuals. Infants were excluded from the study and no patient had pulmonary hypertension. Persistence of the ductus arteriosus is likely to be more common than shown by less sensitive diagnostic methods. Some patients considered to have infective endocarditis with a normal heart may have a silent ductus arteriosus. Evidence of such an association would justify ligation or antibiotic cover as prophylactic measures. 
Tears of the retinal pigment epithelium: occurrence in association with choroidal effusion. Two patients developed large tears of the retinal pigment epithelium associated with choroidal effusion. One tear occurred after combined cataract/filtration surgery complicated by postoperative choroidal detachment; the second developed in a patient with idiopathic uveal effusion syndrome. Weakness of the junctions of the pigment epithelial cells secondary to the accumulation of fluid in the subretinal or suprachoroidal space may result in tearing of the retinal pigment epithelium as it is stretched. 
Cell kinetics of gastrointestinal tumors after different nutritional regimens. A preliminary report. Forty-four cases of different untreated gastrointestinal tumors were studied with regard to cell kinetic activity. As a pilot experiment, we also determined the 3H-TdR Labeling Index (LI) in 28 patients in basal conditions and after 15 days of nutritional manipulation with prevalently lipid-based or glucose-based feeding to ascertain whether selective nutritional regimens could affect tumor proliferation. Preliminary results from this study indicate that a kinetic perturbation is induced in tumor cells by nutritional manipulation. Lipid-based feeding seems to produce effects similar to those of chemical or physical anticancer agents, thus suggesting a possible supporting role of nutritional manipulation in cancer treatment strategy. 
HBV-DNA-related hepatocellular carcinoma occurring in childhood. Report of three cases. In a series of 325 HBV chronically infected children observed over an 18-year period, three developed HCC. These three children were born in southern Italy, a region characterized by a high endemic HBV infection rate; each had been infected perinatally, developed an acute hepatitis, and became a chronic carrier. Two of the three with cirrhosis were HBsAg positive at the time their HCC was detected. The remaining case had seroconverted to HBsAb but HBV-DNA integration could be demonstrated in the absence of cirrhosis; moreover HBV antigens were not expressed in the tissue of this case. The interval between HBV infection and HCC appearance in these three cases ranged from six to 11 years. A similarity between these three Italian cases and the majority of HCC arising in chronically infected children in the Far East is noted. 
Localized recurrent postoperative pernio associated with leukocytoclastic vasculitis. A patient with recurrent pernio of the right ankle for 21 years after surgery had a leukocytoclastic vasculitis localized in the area. We suggest that the various histologic descriptions of pernio in the literature and in this case represent different levels of severity of the disease. 
Intraoral reconstruction with a microvascular peritoneal flap. The microvascular peritoneal flap offers a new reconstructive option for closure of intraoral defects. The flap is easy to raise, and donor-site morbidity is low. Unlike fascial flaps, in which the raw surface may take weeks to "mucosalize," the peritoneal surface heals primarily. Finally, the rectus muscle effectively covers all forms of mandibular reconstruction, and the reliable skin paddle makes possible the closure of substantial cutaneous defects. 
Interrelation of analgesia and uterine activity in women with primary dysmenorrhea. A preliminary report. The interrelation between uterine activity and pain from primary dysmenorrhea has been of interest for many years. Objective studies of uterine activity during non-steroidal antiinflammatory drug therapy have supported the assertion that uterine activity causes pain and that reducing that activity leads to pain reduction. Unfortunately, those studies could not refute the counter-assertion that reductions in uterine activity come about because of reduced pain through central analgesia and not by direct pharmacologic action. In an effort to clarify this question, a small number of women were studied using intrauterine pressure recording and analysis to evaluate objective changes in uterine physiology during transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) therapy for dysmenorrhea. The preliminary studies indicated that despite successful subjective therapy with TENS, intrauterine pressure parameters remained steady or showed signs of worsening. These findings indicate that TENS provides pure analgesia by an alteration of the body's ability to receive or perceive the pain signal rather than by a direct uterine effect. It appears that the reduction in uterine activity seen in objective drug studies represents direct drug action rather than a change from reduced pain through central analgesic effects. 
Flow characteristics of enteral feeding with psyllium hydrophilic mucilloid added. One therapy for managing diarrhea in patients in intensive care units who are receiving enteral nutrition is administration of psyllium hydrophilic mucilloid (PHM). This laboratory study was conducted to determine whether the addition of PHM (Metamucil) to enteral feeding formula (Entrition) adversely affected the flow characteristics of the feeding formula through a small-bore feeding tube. Descriptive data were obtained from 72 trials of feeding formula with varied infusion rates, formula osmolality and temperature, and PHM concentrations. Two thirds (n = 48) of the trials were successful (PHM did not clog the tubing and obstruct flow). The remaining one third of the trials (n = 24) were unsuccessful. Successful formula infusion was influenced by formula temperature and osmolality but not by infusion rate, PHM concentration, or flow interruption. If formula with PHM was followed by formula without PHM, the infusion was successful regardless of infusion rate or formula osmolality. Thus, the data from this laboratory study indicate that when therapeutic doses of PHM are prescribed, it is feasible for PHM to be mixed in room-temperature feeding formula and infused without clogging the feeding tube. 
The role of growth hormone and insulin-like growth factor-I in experimental renal growth and scarring. Recent evidence suggests a causal link between early renal/glomerular hypertrophy and late kidney scarring and glomerular sclerosis. Insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I) is a growth-promoting peptide likely to play a role in the development of kidney growth. We observed an increased renal IGF-I content in two experimental models of accelerated kidney growth in the rat. By contrast, diabetic renal hypertrophy is abolished in the absence of growth hormone (GH). Dietary protein manipulations affect the expression of compensatory renal growth (CRG), as well as renal IGF-I content. The renotrophic effect of a high-protein diet on CRG seems GH-dependent and IGF-I-mediated. GH also appears to have a permissive role on the development of progressive renal scarring following extensive renal ablation in rats, as dwarf rats seem somewhat resistant to the development of accelerated scarring and renal failure. 
Prognosis in T2N0M0 stage I breast carcinoma: a 20-year follow-up study. In a study of prognosis in node-negative breast carcinoma, we investigated 293 T2N0M0 patients treated by mastectomy and axillary dissection with a median follow-up of 19.8 years. The probability of surviving 20 years considering all causes of death was 41.3% +/- 3.0%. Recurrence-free survival (Kaplan-Meier estimate) was 68.6% +/- 3% at 10 years and 63.2% +/- 3.1% at 20 years. The estimated probability of cure determined by the method of Brinkley and Haybittle was 63% (95% confidence interval [Cl], 55% to 72%). Prognosis was related to primary tumor size with the best separation (P = .06) when tumors from 2.1 to 3.0 cm (33% chance of recurrence at 20 years) and from 3.1 to 5.0 cm (44% chance of recurrence at 20 years) were compared. The histologic tumor type was prognostically important. Recurrence at 20 years was not significantly different for patients with invasive duct (34%) and lobular (42%) carcinoma. Women with special types (medullary, mucinous, papillary, etc) of carcinoma had a 25% chance of recurrence. Subsequent contralateral breast carcinoma was diagnosed in 29 patients, and four of these were fatal, accounting for only 4.6% of breast carcinoma deaths. Thirty-two patients (10.9%) developed a nonmammary malignant neoplasm (NMMN) after the ipsilateral breast carcinoma, and 69% of these lesions were fatal. Although the chances of recurrence at 20 years related to tumor size and type did not differ statistically in the series, there were trends that suggest that T2N0M0 patients can be stratified into recurrence risk groups based on tumor size and histologic type. These factors should be taken into consideration in the design and analysis of clinical adjuvant therapy trials. Measures for the early detection of common NMMNs should be included in the routine follow-up of T2N0M0 breast carcinoma patients. 
Serum endothelin-1 concentrations and cold provocation in primary Raynaud's phenomenon To determine whether the vasoconstriction in Raynaud's phenomenon is associated with raised concentrations of the endothelium-derived vasoconstrictor endothelin (ET-1), responses to cold pressor testing were examined in 7 subjects with primary Raynaud's phenomenon and in 7 control subjects. Baseline serum ET-1 levels (pg/ml), as measured by radioimmunoassay, were three times higher in Raynaud's subjects (5.3 [SEM 1.7] pg/ml) than in controls (1.7 [0.3]). With progressive local cooling digital arterial pulsatility, as measured by plethysmography, fell earlier and to a greater extent in Raynaud's subjects than in controls, with a half-maximum decrement in pulsatility occurring at 27 [2.6] degrees C and 18 [0.5] degrees C, respectively. Temperature reduction sufficient to cause loss of pulsatility in the Raynaud's subjects produced increases in ET-1 concentrations in both groups that were greater in Raynaud's (10.3 [4.4] pg/ml) than in control subjects (2.7 [0.9] pg/ml). Serum ET-1 in the contralateral arm rose in parallel to but to a lesser extent than that in the cold-challenged arm. Increases in ET-1 concentrations were temporally related to loss of pulsatility but followed the onset of symptoms. Thus the increased basal and stimulated serum endothelin concentrations in Raynaud's disease are associated with the enhanced, prolonged vasospasm of this disorder. 
Embolization of arteriovenous malformations with peripheral aneurysms using ethylene vinyl alcohol copolymer. Report of three cases. The authors report three cases of arteriovenous malformations (AVM's) with aneurysms arising from the feeding artery; all were successfully treated with a new nonadhesive liquid embolic material, ethylene vinyl alcohol copolymer (EVAL). In two patients the AVM's were totally removed without difficulty, and in one the AVM was managed conservatively after embolization. No new neurological deficits appeared during or after embolization. After road-mapping techniques, EVAL was injected slowly until the feeding artery and aneurysm were completely obliterated. This embolic agent is easy to handle and is considered safe compared with other adhesive liquid embolic agents, such as isobutyl-2-cyanoacrylate or n-butyl cyanoacrylate. It is concluded that EVAL is an excellent agent for embolizing an AVM with a peripheral aneurysm on the feeding artery. 
Duodenal obstruction by a nondeflating Foley catheter gastrostomy tube. We report the case of a 36-year-old mentally retarded man who presented to our emergency department after one day of vomiting and one episode of coffee-ground emesis. The Foley catheter used as his gastrostomy tube was found to be obstructing the duodenum, and the balloon could not be deflated. Removal was accomplished by rupturing the balloon by endoscopy. Our case illustrates one of many possible complications of feeding gastrostomy tubes. 
Soft tissue sarcomas of the chest wall. Results of surgical resection. Primary soft tissue sarcomas of the chest wall are uncommon, and data concerning treatment and results are sparse. Most studies have categorized these tumors as truncal sarcomas and inferred a poor prognosis. To assess the results of surgical treatment, we reviewed our 40-year experience. Methods: Records of 189 patients admitted to our institution from 1948 to 1988 were reviewed. Pathologic material was available for review in the 149 cases (79%) that comprise this report. Survival was calculated by the Kaplan-Meier method, with comparisons by log-rank analysis and significance defined as p less than 0.05. Results: Ages ranged from 3 weeks to 86 years (median, 38 years); the ratio of male to female patients was 2:1. The initial complaint was mass or pain in 97% of the cases. Ninety sarcomas (60%) were high grade and 59 (40%) were low grade. Histologic types were as follows: desmoid tumor (n = 32, 21%); liposarcoma (n = 23, 15%); rhabdomyosarcoma (n = 18, 12%); fibrosarcoma (n = 17, 11%); embryonal rhabdomyosarcoma (n = 14, 9%); malignant peripheral nerve tumor (n = 13, 9%); malignant fibrous histiocytoma (n = 11, 7%); spindle cell sarcoma (n = 4, 3%); tenosynovial sarcoma (n = 3, 3%); hemangiopericytoma (n = 3, 3%); alveolar soft part sarcoma (n = 3, 3%); and other types (n = 12, 9%). Resection was the primary treatment in 140 cases (94%). Local recurrence developed in 27%. Metastases occurred in 52 (35%) of the cases (metachronous in 42, synchronous in 10) and were more common in patients with high-grade disease (46/90, 51%) than in those with low-grade disease (6/59, 10%). Overall 5-year survival was 66%. Five-year survival rate for those with high-grade sarcomas (49%) was significantly lower than that for low-grade sarcomas (90%, p less than 0.0001). Tumor size and age of patient were not prognostic. Conclusions: Survival of patients with primary soft tissue sarcomas of the chest wall after resection is similar to that of patients with sarcomas of the extremities. Resection alone provides acceptable survival (90% at 5 years) for those with low-grade sarcomas, but adjuvant treatment should be considered for those with high-grade sarcomas. 
Cephalometric measurements in snorers, non-snorers, and patients with sleep apnoea. Cephalometry is often used to assess patients with sleep apnoea but whether these measurements differ from those in non-apnoeic snorers and how they are influenced by age is not clear. Cephalometric radiographs of patients with sleep apnoea were compared with those of snorers without sleep apnoea and those of non-snorers. Fifty two snorers with suspected sleep apnoea had a conventional sleep study and were divided into two groups: those with an apnoea-hypopnoea index greater than 10/h (n = 40, sleep apnoea group) and those whose apnoea-hypopnoea index was 10/h or less (n = 12, snorer group). The cephalometric measurements in these patients were compared with those of 34 non-snoring control subjects. Controls were subdivided into two groups: control group 1 included 17 subjects similar in age to the sleep apnoea and snorer groups (mean (SD) age 50.0 (10.9), 50.7 (9.4), and 50.6 (9.7) years); control group 2 included 15 young men (25.4 (2.6) years). The distance from the mandibular plane to the hyoid bone (MP-H) and the length of the soft palate were greater in the patients with sleep apnoea (28.7 (7.8) and 43.6 (5.0) mm) than in the snorers (23.7 (4.2) and 40.3 (4.9 mm). The MP-H was similar in snorers and age matched control subjects, but was significantly greater in the older than in the younger control subjects (22.1 (6.1) vs 17.0 (6.8]. The soft palate was longer in subjects who snored (both sleep apnoea patients and snorers) than in control subjects. The MP-H distance significantly correlated with age for all subjects (snorers and controls) and for the control subjects alone. This study shows that non-apnoeic snorers have cephalometric abnormalities that differ from those of patients with sleep apnoea and that cephalometric values are influenced by the subject's age. 
Intravascular stents in the management of superior vena cava syndrome. Superior vena cava syndrome can be effectively palliated with the use of intravascular stents. Adjunctive modalities which may be utilized prior to stent placement are thrombolytic therapy and balloon angioplasty. Six patients with an underlying malignancy were treated with these modalities. Complete resolution of symptoms occurred in five patients, and partial resolution occurred in the sixth. Two of the patients who had initial, complete resolution of symptoms had recurrences. One involved rethrombosis of the superior vena cava which occurred twice and required percutaneous thrombectomy, and the second involved restenosis requiring a percutaneous transluminal angioplasty of the SVC just distal to the stent. Both of these patients with second procedures, again, had complete resolution of symptoms. Intravascular stents are a valuable additional treatment of superior vena cava syndrome. 
Chemicals and environmentally caused diseases in developing countries. This chapter discusses international aspects of diseases resulting from exposure to chemical pollutants in the environment, with an emphasis on developing countries. These countries share many of the same problems of air, water, and pesticide pollution that face the more industrialized countries. In developing countries, however, the problems are compounded by a number of unique situations, viz., economic priorities, high burden of infectious diseases, impoverishment, and absence of a regulatory framework for the disposal of toxic chemicals. This discussion emphasizes the importance of interactions among toxicants, malnutrition, and infectious diseases for both urban and rural populations insofar as these interactions contribute to disease. Toxicants not only produce disease directly but also exacerbate diseases with other causes. Specific examples from developing countries demonstrate how human health effects from exposures to environmental chemicals can be assessed. While they do not strictly fall under the rubric of "developing countries," the public health consequences of inadequate control of environmental pollution in the East European countries should demonstrate the magnitude of the problem, except that in developing countries the public health consequence of environmental chemicals will be aggravated by the widespread malnutrition and high prevalence of infectious diseases. Much needs to be done before we can adequately quantify the contribution of environmental chemicals to morbidity and mortality in developing countries with the level of sophistication now evident in the charting of infectious diseases in these countries. 
Acute spinal cord injury: magnetic resonance imaging correlated with myelopathy. Thirty-one patients (29 males and two females, 13-87 years of age (mean, 46.7 years] with acute spinal cord injury were studied by MR (magnetic resonance) imaging and the results were correlated with neurological findings. Magnetic resonance images were obtained with a 0.5 T superconductive MR scanner (Phillips Gyroscan S5). Initial imaging was performed within 24 hours after trauma in 13 patients, 1-7 days in 13 patients and 7-14 days in five patients. Twenty-six patients underwent follow-up examinations with MR imaging. Cord abnormalities including cord compression (23 patients), cord swelling (seven patients), and abnormal signal intensities on either T1 or T2-weighted images (26 patients) were observed on initial examination. Multivariate analysis showed that cord compression and abnormal intensities on T1-weighted images were important prognostic indicators. Hyperintensity on T2-weighted images was non-specific but correlated well with clinical recovery. Magnetic resonance imaging is useful in predicting the prognosis and for planning treatment following spinal cord injuries. 
Can vitamin D deficiency produce an unusual pain syndrome? An unusual pain occurred in five patients in the presence of compromised vitamin D status and resolved 5 to 7 days after supplementation with vitamin D in the form of ergocalciferol. The pain had a hyperesthetic quality and did not respond to the use of analgesics, including opiate derivatives. Treatment with therapeutic levels of a tricyclic antidepressant did not bring relief of symptoms. In one case, months after treatment and subsequent improvement of vitamin D status and pain, the vitamin D status again declined and the pain recurred. The pain again resolved with vitamin D replacement and improvement of levels. There may be a pain syndrome associated with vitamin D depletion that appears as hyperesthesia worsened by light, superficial pressure or even small increments of movement. This pain restricts mobility and function and may lead to further complications, such as pressure sores. 
Operations for Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome. Forty-six patients with symptomatic tachycardia underwent operations to divide 55 atrioventricular accessory pathways. Mean age was 29 years (range 11 to 63). Ten patients (22%) had associated cardiac disease, including two with a congenital diverticulum of the coronary sinus and six (13%) who had concomitant surgical procedures. A bipolar hand-held electrode was used in 22 operations, and simultaneous multisite mapping in the last 24 operations. Ten patients (22%) had multiple accessory pathways. A modified endocardial approach was used. The overall patient success rate was 93% with 91% to 93% of accessory pathways successfully divided. The perioperative morbidity was 17%. There were two reoperations. There were no early or late deaths. Patients have been followed up for a mean of 16 months. There were five recurrences of preexcitation (two early, three late). Two of these patients (both with a congenital diverticulum of the coronary sinus) had reoperation. One patient had late recurrence of atrial fibrillation. Operation for the Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome has a high probability of success with a low operative risk. 
Oral contraceptives and coronary heart disease. In industrialized countries, coronary heart disease (CHD) is a major public health problem for both men and women. Preventive strategies for reducing the excessive mortality and morbidity associated with CHD involve the identification and modification of metabolic factors believed to be involved in the disease process. Three major areas of concern are lipid metabolism, carbohydrate metabolism and the hemostatic system. The steroid hormones contained in oral contraceptives (OCs) have been shown to interfere in all three areas. In many instances OCs have been shown to alter metabolic markers for CHD in directions associated with increased risk. Although evidence is lacking that such changes induce CHD in users of modern, low-dose OCs, it would be prudent to develop formulations with a minimal impact on metabolic risk markers. There is increasing evidence that many of the metabolic disturbances seen in CHD patients share a common origin, and the development of risk-free OCs is likely to require investigation into complex interrelationships. 
Demonstration of myocardial reperfusion injury in humans: results of a pilot study utilizing acute coronary angioplasty with perfluorochemical in anterior myocardial infarction. Reperfusion may limit the amount of potentially salvageable myocardium through the introduction of cellular elements into previously ischemic but viable myocardium (reperfusion injury). It has been demonstrated that intracoronary infusion of a 20% intravascular perfluorochemical emulsion (Fluosol) significantly reduces infarct size and results in improved left ventricular function in the canine model. This pilot study was performed to explore the existence of myocardial reperfusion injury in humans. Utilizing Fluosol as a probe in conjunction with emergency coronary angioplasty, 26 patients presenting within 4 h with a first anterior myocardial infarction were randomized to emergency angioplasty or angioplasty followed by a 30-min intracoronary infusion of Fluosol at 40 ml/min. Global and regional ventricular function were assessed immediately and a mean of 12 days after successful angioplasty with contrast ventriculography. Infarct size was semiquantitated with thallium-201 single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) images before discharge. Twelve patients (six undergoing angioplasty alone, six treated with angioplasty and Fluosol) had an occluded infarct-related vessel (Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction [TIMI] grade 0 to 1) at the time of emergency catheterization and were included in the final analysis. At 12 days after successful angioplasty, the improvement in regional ventricular function was greater in patients receiving adjunctive therapy with intracoronary Fluosol versus those undergoing angioplasty alone utilizing both the radial shortening and centerline method, respectively (23 +/- 3.1% vs. 8 +/- 2.3%, p less than 0.02; and -1.6 +/- 0.4 vs. -2.9 +/- 0.2 SD/chord, p less than 0.05). 
The rectus abdominis free flap in head and neck reconstruction. The rectus abdominis musculocutaneous free flap, based on the deep inferior epigastric artery and vein, has been used widely in reconstruction of the breast and extremities. The number of reports on its applications in the head and neck is limited. The rectus abdominis free flap is one of the most versatile soft-tissue flaps. The deep inferior epigastric artery and vein are long, large-diameter vessels that are ideal for microvascular anastomoses. The area of skin that can be transferred is probably the largest of all flaps presently in use. The versatility of this donor site is due to the ability to transfer large areas of skin with varying thicknesses and varying amounts of underlying muscle. We have successfully used this flap in 15 consecutive patients to reconstruct defects of the neck, face, mouth, pharynx, skull base, and scalp. No major complications involving either the recipient or donor sites occurred. The literature on the use of the rectus abdominis flap in head and neck reconstruction is reviewed in detail. The advantages and disadvantages of this soft-tissue free flap are thoroughly discussed in an effort to better define its proper place among the reconstructive options available to the head and neck surgeon. 
Effect of dietary proteins and lipids in patients with membranous nephropathy and nephrotic syndrome. Twenty-four patients with idiopathic membranous nephropathy, long-lasting nephrotic syndrome and serum creatinine less than 2 mg/dl ate sequentially, in a randomized cross-over design, a normal protein diet containing 1.1 +/- 0.3 g/kg/day of proteins and a low protein diet containing 0.7 +/- 0.1 g/kg/day of protein, each diet for a period of 3 months. Both diets were low in fat (less than 30% of total calories) and cholesterol (less than 200 mg/day) content and rich in polyunsaturated fatty acids and in linoleic acid (10% of energy). Random assignment to one of the two 3 month diet periods was done after a RUN-IN period of at least one month on the hypolipidic normal protein diet. Glomerular filtration rate (inulin clearance), 24 hour urinary protein loss and serum albumin concentration did not significantly differ at the end of the two diet periods, indicating that long-term restriction of protein intake does not modify GFR or urinary protein loss in nephrotic patients. Serum total and LDL-cholesterol and daily proteinuria were significantly lower at the end of both diet periods than at the beginning and at the end of the RUN-IN period. We suggest that these changes were a consequence of the manipulation of dietary fat intake. 
Ofloxacin versus parenteral therapy for chronic osteomyelitis. We conducted a randomized comparison of oral ofloxacin (400 mg twice a day) and parenteral agents (cefazolin, 1.0 g intravenously every 8 h, or ceftazidime, 2.0 g intravenously every 12 h) in biopsy-confirmed, nonprosthesis osteomyelitis. A total of 19 subjects received ofloxacin for an average of 8 weeks, and 14 received parenteral antibiotics for an average of 4 weeks; both therapies were well tolerated. Infections were due to Staphylococcus aureus (40%), Enterococcus spp. (3%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (15%), and other gram-negative organisms (42%). At the completion of therapy, one P. aeruginosa infection in the ofloxacin group persisted and the organism acquired resistance, accompanied by a resistant Acinetobacter superinfection. In the parenteral group, one S. aureus infection persisted, and there was a resolved superinfection due to S. aureus as well. Eighteen-month follow-up data have been obtained. Among those treated with ofloxacin, four subjects whose initial response to therapy was successful suffered relapses of infection, three due to S. aureus and one due to P. aeruginosa, while in the parenteral group, one subject with a P. aeruginosa infection relapsed. Long-term response to therapy was successful for 14 of 19 (74%) subjects who received ofloxacin and 12 of 14 (86%) who received parenteral antibiotics; the difference was not significant. Oral ofloxacin appears comparable to parenteral antibiotics in chronic osteomyelitis due to susceptible organisms, and oral ofloxacin offers advantages in economics and convenience. 
Auditory screening of infants. Within the last 20 years, infant hearing screening has progressed from a laudable goal to a state-mandated reality in many areas of the United States. The high risk register provides a means by which history and neonatal physical examination can be used to identify the infant at risk for hearing loss. Two procedures (crib-O-gram and auditory brainstem-evoked response) have been the most common methods of screening for hearing loss in the newborn or in intensive care nurseries. Evoked cochlear emissions reportedly are identifiable in 90 to 100% of normal-hearing infants. This observation has lead to the use of evoked otoacoustic emissions as a hearing screening procedure with infants. 
SWIFT trial of delayed elective intervention v conservative treatment after thrombolysis with anistreplase in acute myocardial infarction. SWIFT (Should We Intervene Following Thrombolysis?) Trial Study Group. OBJECTIVE--To see whether early elective angiography with a view to coronary angioplasty or bypass grafting of a stenosed infarct related vessel would improve outcome in acute myocardial infarction treated by thrombolysis with anistreplase. DESIGN--Randomised study of two treatment strategies with analysis of results over 12 months. SETTING--21 district hospitals and regional cardiac centres in Britain and Ireland. SUBJECTS--800 of 993 patients presenting with clinical and electrocardiographic features of acute myocardial infarction up to three hours after the onset of major symptoms. TREATMENT STRATEGIES--Intravenous anistreplase 30 units followed by a standard regimen of heparin, warfarin, and timolol and (in patients so randomised) early angiography plus appropriate intervention. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE--Death or reinfarction within 12 months. RESULTS--397 patients were randomised to receive early angiography plus appropriate intervention (coronary angioplasty in 169 cases, coronary grafting in 59) and 403 patients to receive conservative care (of these, 12 had angioplasty and seven bypass grafting during the initial admission). By 12 months mortality (5.8% (23 patients) in the intervention group v 5.0% (20) in the conservative care group; p = 0.6) and rates of reinfarction (15.1% (60 patients) v 12.9% (52); p = 0.4) were similar in the two groups. No significant differences in rates of angina or rest pain were found at 12 months. Left ventricular ejection fraction at three and 12 months was the same in both groups. Median hospital stay was longer in the intervention group (11 days v 10 days; p less than 0.0001). CONCLUSION--For most patients given thrombolytic treatment for acute myocardial infarction a strategy of angiography and intervention is appropriate only when required for clinical indications. 
Chondromyxoid fibroma: radiographic appearance in 38 cases and in a review of the literature [published erratum appears in Radiology 1991 Aug;180(2):586] Thirty-eight cases of histologically confirmed chondromyxoid fibroma were reviewed and their radiographic features recorded. These findings, coupled with a review of the English-language medical literature, suggest that this rare, benign bone tumor has a characteristic but not specific radiographic appearance and may often mimic more common tumors. Chondromyxoid fibroma may occur anywhere in the skeleton, but almost half of the cases occur around the knee. The possibility of chondromyxoid fibroma should always be considered when a focal bone lesion is evaluated that has geographic bone destruction, a sclerotic rim, lobulated margins, and septation. The diagnosis of chondromyxoid fibroma is most likely when the patient is in the 2nd decade of life. 
Role of bile acids in splanchnic hemodynamic response to chronic portal hypertension. Previous studies from our laboratory suggest that humoral factors, namely glucagon, can account for approximately 30% of the splanchnic vasodilation in rats with prehepatic portal hypertension. A reduced vascular sensitivity to norepinephrine, vasopressin, and angiotensin II may contribute to the splanchnic vasodilation. However, neither glucagon nor an altered vasoconstrictor sensitivity can fully account for the splanchnic vasodilation observed in portal hypertensive subjects. Therefore, the present study was designed to examine the role of bile acids in the splanchnic hyperemia of portal hypertension since (1) serum bile acids are elevated in portal hypertensive subjects and (2) bile acids are potent intestinal vasodilators. Prehepatic portal hypertension was induced in Sprague-Dawley rats by surgical constriction of the portal vein. Ten to 14 days after the induction of portal hypertension, the enterohepatic circulation of control and portal hypertensive rats was surgically interrupted. The animals were placed in Bollman restraint cages and allowed to recover. Eighteen to 24 hr later, the rats were anesthetized with sodium pentobarbital and regional blood flow measured with radiolabeled microspheres. Normal and portal hypertensive animals without bile fistula served as controls. Plasma bile acid levels measured by radioimmunoassay were approximately 3.8 times higher in portal hypertensive animals than in control. Bile duct cannulation effectively depleted both normal and portal hypertensive animals of their circulating bile acid pool and significantly reduced portal venous inflow in portal hypertensive but not in control rats. A role for bile acids as partial mediators of the splanchnic hyperemia of portal hypertension is suggested since bile acid depletion did not completely abolish the gastrointestinal hyperemia. 
Risk factors for injurious falls: a prospective study. We conducted a prospective study of the consequences of falls in 325 elderly community-dwelling persons, all of whom had fallen in the previous year. We contacted subjects every week for one year to ascertain falls and to determine the circumstances and consequences of falls. Only 6% of 539 falls resulted in a major injury (fracture, dislocation, or laceration requiring suture), but over half (55%) resulted in minor soft tissue injury. One in ten falls left the faller unable to get up for at least 5 minutes, and one in four falls caused subjects to limit their activities. The risk of injury per fall was about the same regardless of the number of falls a person had during follow-up. The risk of major injury was increased (age- and sex-adjusted odds ratio: 5.9, 95% confidence interval: 2.3-14.9) in falls associated with loss of consciousness compared to nonsyncopal falls. In multivariate analyses of nonsyncopal falls, the risk of major injury per fall was higher in persons having a previous fall with fracture (6.7; 2.1-21.5), a slower Trail Making B time (1.9; 1.1-3.2), and in Whites (18.4; 7.5-44.6). The risk that a nonsyncopal fall would result in minor injury (versus no injury) was increased in persons with a slower hand reaction time (1.8; 1.0-3.2) decreased grip strength (1.5; 1.0-2.3), in Whites (2.0; 1.0-3.7), in falls while using stairs and steps (2.2; 1.0-5.0), and turning around or reaching (3.5; 1.7-7.3). Our findings suggest that neuromuscular and cognitive impairment, as well as the circumstances of falls, affect the risk of injury when a fall occurs. 
The day-long antianginal effectiveness of nitroglycerin patches. A double-blind study using dose-titration. This study was designed to determine the day-long antianginal effectiveness of nitroglycerin patches in the nitrate-exposed patient, as well as the doses required. Eight men with chronic stable angina, a positive treadmill test, and demonstrated responsiveness to long-term oral isosorbide dinitrate were studied after they had been taking effective doses of isosorbide dinitrate three times a day for at least two weeks. Treadmill exercise bouts were performed every 1 to 2 hours over 1 day, after the 8 am application of active nitroglycerin patches in a previously titrated dose, and on another day after application of placebo patches. Mean necessary effective patch dose was 125 sq cm (60 to 220 sq cm). Mean exercise duration to angina rose from 271 to 480 s (p less than 0.001) 1 hour after active patches, while resting systolic blood pressure fell from 122 mm Hg to 100 mm Hg (p less than 0.001). (After placebo patches: +19 s and -2 mm Hg, respectively.) Active patches were superior to placebo throughout the day, but in declining degree (by 94 s at 7 pm, p less than 0.05). Thus, nitroglycerin patches can provide a significant day-long antianginal effect in the patient with long-term exposure to nitrate. However, the need for large doses and individual titration may make this therapy impractical. 
Laser cordectomy for T1 glottic carcinoma: a 10-year experience and videostroboscopic findings. Fifty-three patients underwent laser cordectomy for T1 glottic squamous cell carcinoma between January 1980 and December 1989--sixteen after having undergone unsuccessful radiation and thirty-seven who had no previous treatment. There was a 51% five-year cure rate in the irradiated group vs. 62% in the nonirradiated group. Extension of tumor to the anterior commissure resulted in a higher failure rate. Patients experienced an overall 5-year cure rate of 98% after surgical or radiation salvage of unsuccessful laser cordectomies. Six patients had preoperative and postoperative videostrobolaryngoscopy. The most common postoperative problem with voice was a breathiness that did not resolve in any of the patients. All patients had absent or moderately reduced amplitude and mucosal wave patterns and imcomplete glottic closure proportional to the amount of cordal tissue removed. Despite it seemingly poor results in carefully selected patients, laser cordectomy is still indicated without compromising the ultimate oncologic results. Advantages over radiation therapy or conservation laryngeal surgery include a short treatment time, requiring only an outpatient surgical procedure at the time of the initial diagnostic and/or staging laryngoscopy, and the avoidance of potential radiation side effects or surgical complications. However, patients should be advised the possibility of persistent postoperative breathy dysphonia, in addition to the possibility of further treatment to effect a long-term cure. 
Crossover ilioprofunda reconstruction: an expanded role for obturator foramen bypass. The standard obturator foramen bypass extends from the aorta or iliac artery to the ipsilateral superficial femoral or popliteal artery. This operation has been both effective and versatile as an indirect bypass procedure for circumventing difficult vascular problems in the femoral triangle. A case is presented of a patient whose limb was salvaged by an obturator foramen bypass from the contralateral iliac artery to the profunda femoris artery. This unique case is compared to other published cases to emphasize the potential advantages of the profunda femoris as the preferred graft outflow in selected cases of arterial reconstruction through the obturator foramen. 
Antibiotic treatment of bacterial gastroenteritis. Antibiotic treatment is important in certain etiologies of bacterial gastroenteritis, both for clinical improvement and for eradication of the causative organism from stools, which is important epidemiologically. The etiology, however, is seldom known at presentation in sporadic cases of diarrhea. Thus the decision to initiate antibiotic therapy and the choice of the specific antimicrobial agents should be made on a clinical basis, before culture results are available. 
Regulation of B cell antigen receptor signal transduction and phosphorylation by CD45. CD45 is a member of a family of membrane proteins that possess phosphotyrosine phosphatase activity, and is the source of much of the tyrosine phosphatase activity in lymphocytes. In view of its enzymatic activity and high copy number, it seems likely that CD45 functions in transmembrane signal transduction by lymphocyte receptors that are coupled to activation of tyrosine kinases. The B cell antigen receptor was found to transduce a Ca(2+)-mobilizing signal only if cells expressed CD45. Also, both membrane immunoglobulin M (mIgM) and CD45 were lost from the surface of cells treated with antibody to CD45, suggesting a physical interaction between these proteins. Finally, CD45 dephosphorylated a complex of mIg-associated proteins that appears to function in signal transduction by the antigen receptor. These data indicate that CD45 occurs as a component of a complex of proteins associated with the antigen receptor, and that CD45 may regulate signal transduction by modulating the phosphorylation state of the antigen receptor subunits. 
Multicenter evaluation of efficacy, tolerability and safety of a new first-line antihypertensive drug, isradipine, in a Latin-American population. Isradipine, a new antihypertensive dihydropyridine calcium antagonist, was evaluated for its efficacy, tolerability, and safety in 91 ambulatory patients who had mild-to-moderate hypertension. The design of the present study included a two-week wash-out period after confirmation of disease, followed by 12 weeks of active treatment with 2.5 mg isradipine twice daily. Patients were switched from other antihypertensive drugs, mainly diuretics and beta-blockers. The dose of isradipine remained virtually unchanged throughout the study and resulted in a mean decrease of 22 mm Hg in systolic blood pressure (SBP) (P less than .00001) and 19 mm Hg in diastolic blood pressure (DBP) (P less than .00001). Heart rate was unchanged (difference of -1 beats/min), as was the mean body weight of the study patients. Isradipine was generally well tolerated. Side effects were few and, when present, tended to diminish and eventually disappear during the treatment period. All of the clinical laboratory parameters tested and electrocardiograph intervals remained unchanged. In conclusion, these results indicate that isradipine is a novel drug which is highly effective and well tolerated in the treatment of mild to moderate hypertension in this group of patients. 
Diagnosis and management of chronic hypertension in pregnancy. Pregnancies complicated by chronic hypertension are at increased risk for the development of superimposed preeclampsia, abruptio placentae, and poor perinatal outcome. The frequency of these complications is particularly increased in patients with severe hypertension and those with preexisting cardiovascular and renal disease. Such women should receive appropriate antihypertensive therapy and frequent evaluations of maternal and fetal well-being. In contrast, in patients with mild essential chronic hypertension, the maternal and perinatal benefits from antihypertensive medications are highly controversial. A review of the literature revealed two placebo-controlled studies, four trials comparing treatment versus no medication, and three comparisons of methyldopa and oxprenolol. In only one of these studies were subjects randomized in the first trimester. No differences in pregnancy outcome were found with the use of antihypertensive drugs. Evaluation of the woman with chronic hypertension who is considering pregnancy should begin before conception to establish the cause and severity of the hypertension. Appropriate management should include frequent evaluation of maternal and fetal well-being; antihypertensive medications may be useful in patients with severe disease as well as in those with target organ involvement. 
Gastroesophageal reflux and upper airway diseases. GER can have important impacts on the upper airway passages, and in turn, upper airway obstruction can certainly aggravate reflux. This relationship should be considered in the newborn or young infant, faced with a sudden life-threatening event, and in the older child or adult presenting with chronic head and neck complaints, either unexplained or unresponsive to adequate medical therapy. A causal relationship may be difficult to establish, based first on clinical expertise as a guideline, on laboratory tests, among which pharyngeal pH monitoring could be promising, and on response to medical antireflux therapy. A better understanding of the significance of high levels of reflux and defective acid clearance, as well as a more precise knowledge of the maturation and functioning of upper airway protective mechanisms, would open the way to more accurate diagnostic procedures, to a more reliable definition of the abnormal, and to greater efficiency in the management of these patients. 
Emergency management of the nondeflating Foley catheter balloon. Inability to remove a self-retaining (Foley) catheter may result from failed attempts to deflate its balloon. In this article, the authors review the causes of inability to deflate Foley catheters as well as the various techniques for their removal. 
Post-prandial worsening of angina: all due to changes in cardiac output? BACKGROUND--The precise mechanism leading to the post-prandial worsening of angina has yet to be adequately defined. It has been attributed to an increase in double product but is perhaps more likely to be related to an increase in cardiac output after food. This study was designed to evaluate the effects of food on patients' exercise tolerance and compare these with changes in haemodynamic variables. METHODS--23 patients with chronic stable angina who had post-prandial worsening of their angina were studied. The patients were evaluated on two occasions and at each visit they underwent two symptom limited treadmill exercise tests. They remained fasting on the first visit and were given a 1400 kcal meal 60 minutes before the second exercise test on the second visit. Time to onset of 1 mm ST segment depression, heart rate, systemic arterial blood pressure, and cardiac output were measured at rest and during exercise. RESULTS--There were no differences in any of the variables during the two exercise tests on the day the patients remained fasting. After the meal exercise tolerance fell significantly by 136 seconds and the stage at which 1 mm ST segment depression was first seen was also significantly reduced. Resting cardiac output increased significantly by 0.86 1/min with the patients sitting and by 0.89 1/min standing. The exercise times after food were significantly related to cardiac output even when fasting times were taken into account. Resting heart rate increased significantly by 8.3 beats per minute sitting and 10.4 beats per minute standing. There was little change in blood pressure and no evidence that the double product predicted the post-prandial exercise time. CONCLUSIONS--Worsening of angina was related to the increase in cardiac output after a meal and successful treatment will depend upon the prevention of this increase. 
Headache spectrum in Arnold-Chiari malformation. Exertional headaches in patients with Arnold-Chiari malformation (ACM) are well described. We report four patients with Type I ACM and recurrent headaches. These patients presented, respectively, with low spinal fluid pressure headache, migraine without aura, migraine with aura, and migraine with prolonged aura. This report suggests the need for observing patients with recurrent headaches for any physical stigmata of craniovertebral junction anomalies, and the need to exclude ACM in such patients. Possible implications of the association between ACM and different types of headaches are discussed. 
Influence of type of prosthesis on late results after combined mitral-aortic valve replacement. The influence of type of prosthesis on the late outcome of patients with combined mitral-aortic valve replacement was analyzed by comparing, at a 14-year follow-up, patients receiving two biological prostheses (group 1; n = 135), two mechanical prostheses (group 2; n = 221), or a mechanical prosthesis in the aortic position and a bioprosthesis in the mitral position (group 3; n = 97). No difference was found among the three groups in terms of actuarial survival and incidence of and freedom from valve-related deaths, thromboemboli, and hemorrhages. Patients with biological prostheses had a significantly greater incidence of structural valve deterioration, reoperations, and overall complications when compared with patients with only mechanical prostheses. The results of an extended follow-up of patients with combined mitral-aortic valve replacement indicate that mechanical prostheses perform better in the long-term owing to their superior durability when compared with biological valves. The use of bioprostheses should be confined to old patients with limited life expectancy because of their cardiac disease, provided that anticoagulants are not used. Combination of mechanical and biological prostheses in the same patient should be avoided because the advantages of each type of prosthesis are lost. 
CT appearance of splenic injuries managed nonoperatively. This essay illustrates the appearance of the traumatized spleen on CT scans obtained during the course of conservative treatment. Although the CT appearance of acute rupture of the spleen has been adequately described, little has been reported about the appearance of the spleen as it heals after trauma. Examples of CT studies of splenic injuries illustrate the various changes in appearance over time in the traumatized spleen that is treated nonoperatively. 
Progress in cancer. Definite progress has been made against cancer since the National Cancer Act was passed in 1971. Physicians are giving increased attention to cancer prevention. The exciting changes in molecular biology provide increased knowledge about basic mechanisms in tumor growth and metastases. Detailed discussions of two common solid cancers--breast and colorectal--attest to continuing advances in cancer diagnosis and treatment. All of these augur well for further progress in oncology. Continued research, basic and clinical, is mandatory. 
Percutaneous posterolateral lumbar discectomy and decompression with a 6.9-millimeter cannula. Analysis of operative failures and complications. The operative failures and complications of percutaneous posterolateral lumbar discectomy were analyzed in 100 patients who had a herniated nucleus pulposus and were prospectively studied and treated with use of a 6.9-millimeter outer-diameter (4.9-millimeter inner-diameter) sheath and manual insertion of the instruments. Twelve operations were considered to have failed, regardless of the length of postoperative follow-up or the incidence of reinjury; eleven patients had a repeat operation at the index level, and one patient was a chronic drug-abuser. In eight of the eleven patients, subsequent laminectomy was successful. Two patients had a psoas hematoma and one had a transitory sensory and distal motor deficit; all of these complications resolved without sequelae. There were no major complications, including superficial or deep infection, and no patient had neurovascular compromise. 
Palliation of proximal malignant biliary obstruction by endoscopic endoprosthesis insertion. For four years up to December 1987, 190 patients (median age 73 years) with proximal malignant biliary obstruction were treated by endoscopic endoprosthesis insertion. Altogether 101 had cholangiocarcinoma, 21 gall bladder carcinoma, 20 local spread of pancreatic carcinoma, and 48 metastatic malignancy. Fifty eight patients had type I, 54 type II, and 78 type III proximal biliary strictures (Bismuth classification). All patients were either unfit or unsuitable for an attempt at curative surgical resection. A single endoprosthesis was placed initially, with a further stent being placed only if relief of cholestasis was insufficient or sepsis developed in undrained segments. The combined percutaneous-endoscopic technique was used to place the endoprosthesis when appropriate, after failed endoscopic endoprosthesis insertion or for second endoprosthesis placement. Full follow up was available in 97%.Thirteen patients were still alive at the time of review and all but one had been treated within the past six months. Initial endoprosthesis insertion succeeded technically at the first attempt in 127 patients, at the second in 30, and at a combined procedure in a further 13 (cumulative total success rate 89% - type I: 93%; type II: 94%; and type III: 84%). There was adequate biliary drainage after single endoprosthesis insertion in 152 of the 170 successful placements, giving an overall successful drainage rate of 80%. Three patients had a second stent placed by combined procedure because of insufficient drainage, giving an overall successful drainage rate of 82% (155 of 190). The final overall drainage success rates were type I: 91%; type II: 83%; and type III: 73%. The early complication rates were type I: 7%; type II: 14%; and type III: 31%. 
Complications after intravesical instillation of bacillus Calmette-Guerin: rhabdomyolysis and metastatic infection. Two cases of adverse reaction to bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG) bladder instillations are reported. In both cases transient fevers and systemic symptoms developed following the instillations. After an additional instillation 1 patient had high fevers, severe myalgias and profound weakness followed by rhabdomyolysis and anuric renal failure, which required 3 weeks of hemodialysis before recovery. Extensive evaluation revealed no cause other than the BCG instillations. In the other patient a firm subcutaneous nodule gradually developed on the chest wall, which contained nonviable acid fast bacilli. 
Recurrence of ectopic pregnancy: the role of salpingitis. We evaluated the role of salpingitis on the recurrence of ectopic pregnancy from a historical cohort of 2501 women who had undergone laparoscopic examination for acute salpingitis. We used pregnancy (N = 2899) as the unit of analysis and a modified conditional logistic regression to estimate a pairwise odds ratio as a measure of the recurrence of ectopic pregnancy. Among the second or higher order of pregnancy, the recurrence was 21.7%. For pregnancies with a prior uterine pregnancy, the ectopic pregnancy rate increased with prior salpingitis scores constructed from a combination of prior salpingitis episodes and severity (0 score, 2.7%; 1 to 2 scores, 4.8%; and greater than or equal to 3 scores, 12.1%). For those with a prior ectopic pregnancy, the rate did not increase with prior salpingitis scores (score 0, 20.0%; score 1 or 2, 19.2%; and score greater than or equal to 3, 26.9%). The adjusted pairwise odds ratio was 2.2 and was practically unchanged (2.1) after additional adjustment with prior salpingitis scores. These findings confirm salpingitis as a risk factor for first ectopic pregnancy, but once a woman had an ectopic pregnancy, previous salpingitis might not add any incremental risk. 
Effectiveness of nitrous oxide in a rural EMS system. Prehospital systems need a safe, effective analgesic agent for the treatment of patients suffering from pain. Recent studies have documented the efficacy of nitrous oxide in urban and rural settings. This study reviews the findings on 200 patients (157 trauma, 23 medical, 18 musculoskeletal problems) who received nitrous oxide during a 28-month period in a rural EMS system. Eighty-five percent of the patients reported pain relief. Only minor side effects were noted. Patient satisfaction was high, and there was no abuse noted among personnel. 
Iatrogenic epidermoid cyst of the parotid region following ear surgery. Iatrogenic implantation of squamous epithelium may result in formation of an epidermoid cyst. These cysts have been described in various sites around the head and neck following otological procedures. A case of iatrogenic epidermal cyst in the parotid region following repeated myringoplasty is reported. The clinical features and differential diagnosis are discussed. 
Epidural blood patch for treatment of subarachnoid fistula in children. A subarachnoid-cutaneous fistula developed in two children after the placement of a catheter in the subarachnoid space for drainage of cerebrospinal fluid. The management of this iatrogenic complication with epidural blood patch is described. 
The value of estrogen and progesterone receptor determinations in advanced breast cancer. Estrogen receptor level but not progesterone receptor level correlates with response to tamoxifen. Four hundred fifteen patients with metastatic breast cancer with known hormone receptor status received primary treatment with tamoxifen. Measured values for the estrogen receptor (ER, i.e., with estrogen binding) followed a continuous distribution (range, 3 to 1000 fmol/mg of protein). These values correlated positively with age. The response to treatment with tamoxifen correlated with the ER level, with response rates of approximately 80% when the ER level was greater than 30.1 fmol/mg of protein. Two hundred eighteen (218 of 415, 52%) patients had progesterone receptor (PR) values greater than 10 fmol/mg. The PR positivity correlated with the ER level. Patients with PR levels greater than 10 fmol/mg of protein (124 of 226, 55%) had a significantly higher response rate than those with values less than 10 fmol/mg of protein (45 of 189, 24%). However, in a multivariate analysis including both receptor levels, age, site, and number of metastases, only the ER level was significant in predicting the response to treatment with tamoxifen. A quantitative estimation of the ER level thus is the best predictor of response to hormonal treatment with tamoxifen for advanced breast cancer. 
Regional intravenous ketanserin and guanethidine therapy in Raynaud's phenomenon. The authors report the results of a study of 25 patients with Raynaud's phenomenon (primary, posttraumatic, and secondary to diffuse connective tissue diseases) treated with regional intravenous injections of guanethidine or ketanserin. These two drugs were chosen because of the different etiopathologic profiles of the conditions. All the patients showed a substantial clinical improvement with a remission of trophic lesions. Conditions secondary to connective tissue disorders did not demonstrate much improvement based on instrumental data alone, possibly because of the intrinsic limitations of the techniques used for evaluating peripheral blood flow. This specific type of pharmaceutical treatment appeared to be especially suitable for this disease owing to a combination of therapeutic efficacy and a substantial reduction in the total dosage for each patient. 
The axial load teardrop fracture. A biomechanical, clinical and roentgenographic analysis. The anteroinferior cervical vertebral body corner fracture was originally described by Schneider and Cann as the "teardrop" fracture. This report analyzes the biomechanical, clinical, and roentgenographic features of 55 such fractures obtained from the National Football Head and Neck Injury Registry. Teardrop fractures resulting from tackle football characteristically occurred in players attempting to make a tackle in which initial contact was made with the top or crown of the helmet. There were two fracture patterns associated with the anteroinferior corner (teardrop) fracture fragment: 1) the isolated fracture, which is usually not associated with permanent neurologic sequelae; and 2) the three-part, two-plane fracture in which there is an associated sagittal vertebral body fracture as well as fracture of the posterior neural arch. This latter pattern was almost always associated with permanent neurologic sequelae, specifically quadriplegia. Axial loading of the cervical spine was clearly identified as a mechanism of injury for both fracture patterns. Roentgenographic examination must include both anteroposterior and lateral views with computed tomography or tomography as necessary to determine the presence of the sagittal vertebral body fracture and the integrity of the posterior neural arch. 
Facial weakness. A comparison of clinical and photographic methods of observation. The search for an internationally acceptable facial grading system has resulted in an assessment of existing methods by several investigators. These studies were based on observations of video film taken of patients with varying degrees of facial malfunction. Although the grading systems were evaluated, the use of videotape has never been compared with clinical examination and its suitability for this type of work is, therefore, unknown. We used nine facial grading systems to compare the results of clinical observation with those of photographic methods of presentation. The latter included videotape, photographic slides, and a combination of the two. The correlation between clinical examination findings and findings of any of the photographic methods was poor, suggesting the need for a standard form of presentation when grading patients. The most consistent results were found with either clinical examination or photographic slides; videotape was the least reliable. 
Pattern of simulated snoring is different through mouth and nose. Cineradiography of the pharynx during simulated snoring was done in 6 healthy volunteers, and supraglottic pressure and flow rate were recorded in 12 others. We observed, immediately before snoring, a decrease in the sagittal diameter of the oropharynx followed, during snoring, by high-frequency oscillations of soft palate and pharyngeal walls. The pattern of soft palate oscillations was different while snoring through the nose or mouth. During inspiratory snoring through the nose, the soft palate remained in close contact with the back of the tongue and only the uvula presented high-frequency oscillations. Snoring through the mouth resulted in ample high-frequency oscillations of the whole soft palate. Frequency of airflow and supraglottic pressure oscillations was less (P less than 0.05) during mouth (28.2 +/- 7.5 Hz) than during nasal snoring (77.8 +/- 36.7 Hz). This difference may be related to the smaller oscillating mass (i.e., uvula) during nasal snoring. At variance with our previous data, which showed that snoring during sleep, in both heavy (nonapneic) snorers and obstructive sleep apnea patients, was systematically preceded by flow limitation, this was not true during simulated snoring. 
Defining the proper role for self-administered sublingual nitroglycerin. A survey of physicians and patients. Within a half-year period, we encountered six cases of patients harmed by the adverse effects of self-administered nitroglycerin--syncope, delayed definitive medical care, and the worsening of nonischemic symptoms. We therefore surveyed 112 patients after a remote myocardial infarction, and 121 cardiologists and internists, regarding the use of sublingual nitroglycerin. Of the physicians, 84 percent routinely prescribed nitroglycerin to patients after a myocardial infarction, and 79 percent of the patients had the tablets available (83 percent of these, at all times). Most patients used the tablets less than once per month, and 37 percent of the patients who always carried nitroglycerin had not used it at all during the preceding year. Although 89 percent of the patients claimed to know when to use the drug, 57 percent had used it or would use it for symptoms such as dizziness, rapid heartbeat, or presyncope. All patients having nitroglycerin claimed it relieved their symptoms, even if the relief was only partial, the time elapsed until relief could not be specified, and the symptoms were of a type unlikely to be relieved by the drug. We suggest that the practice of routinely prescribing nitroglycerin to patients after a myocardial infarction should be reassessed. 
Clinical course and roentgenographic changes of osteonecrosis in the femoral condyle under conservative treatment. The history of osteonecrosis in the femoral condyle of the knee was observed in 15 knees in 14 patients, averaging 62.8 years in age (range, 23-79 years). There were nine women and five men. The average follow-up period was 4.9 years (range, one to 12 years). Spontaneous osteonecrosis was found in 11 patients and steroid-induced osteonecrosis in three. The medial femoral condyles were involved in 13 knees and the lateral femoral condyles in two. The maximum width of the lesion was measured on anteroposterior roentgenograms and an osteonecrotic lesion less than 10 mm wide was rated as small. Cases of small osteonecrotic lesions displayed no remarkable changes with respect to stages and limb alignment. The average size of the steroid-induced osteonecrotic lesions was significantly larger than that of the spontaneous type. The size of the osteonecrotic lesions at the follow-up examination was compared to that observed at the initial diagnosis in 12 knees. Eight of these lesions displayed increases in dimension of more than 18% over the initial size at diagnosis. 
Safety and cost effectiveness of combined coronary angiography and angioplasty. If coronary angioplasty can be safely performed at the time of the initial diagnostic catheterization, it may result in shorter hospitalization stays and lower overall costs. Combined coronary angiography and angioplasty was performed electively on 733 patients between January 1, 1984, and September 1, 1988. These patients were divided into three major subgroups based upon their indications for angioplasty: 444 (61%) procedures were performed for restenosis; 190 (26%) procedures were performed in patients for unstable angina; and 99 (13%) procedures were performed in patients without unstable angina or previous angioplasty. A subset of 219 patients from this study who underwent elective combined coronary angiography and angioplasty during 1986 were compared with a matched population of 191 patients from the angiography and angioplasty as separate procedures). The success and complication rates were similar for both of these groups. Patients who underwent the combined procedure were hospitalized for a mean of 4.6 days with average total charges of $11,128, compared with 8.0 days and $13,160 for patients undergoing separate procedures (p less than 0.001). Significant savings were also realized with respect to total contrast dose, fluoroscopic time, and total procedural time. Thus in informed patients with suitable coronary anatomy, the strategy of combined angiography and angioplasty may present an opportunity for decreasing hospitalization stay, reducing total charges for revascularization, and reducing radiation exposure without compromising the safety or effectiveness of the procedure. 
Prospective study of porous-coated anatomic total hip arthroplasty. Seventy-five uncemented porous-coated total hip prostheses were implanted in 64 patients. The results were reviewed after a mean follow-up period of 47 months (range, 40-64 months). The mean preoperative rating was fair, and the mean postoperative rating was excellent. There were six dislocations. Ten patients had mild thigh pain at one year; by two years, the pain had resolved in six patients. Neither moderate nor severe limp nor significant loosening of beads was observed. Only one patient had progressive radiolucent lines. The high rate of dislocation may be related to a compromise of acetabular position to obtain bony fixation in acetabula early in the series. The clinical results were encouraging. 
Comparison of the effects of torasemide and furosemide in nonazotemic cirrhotic patients with ascites: a randomized, double-blind study. In a randomized double-blind trial we compared the effects of torasemide, a new loop diuretic, and furosemide in nonazotemic cirrhotic patients with ascites during a 3-day period in association with potassium canrenoate (200 mg/day) administration. Doses of loop diuretics administered in this trial (10 and 25 mg/day of torasemide and furosemide, respectively) had been shown to be equipotent in healthy subjects. Torasemide induced significantly greater natriuresis than furosemide (p less than 0.02), with a twofold greater percentage increase in basal values (day 1: 130% vs. 50%; day 2: 104% vs. 42%; and day 3: 65% vs. 26%, respectively). Body weight loss was significantly higher during torasemide (p less than 0.02) administration, and the overall decrease at the end of the treatment was twice as high for furosemide (2.5 +/- 0.6 kg vs. 1.3 +/- 0.4 kg, respectively). Diuresis was also higher during torasemide administration, but the difference was not significant (p = 0.08). The extent of kaliuresis observed during the two treatments was almost identical despite the striking differences in the natriuretic response. The effects of the two treatments on plasma electrolytes, creatinine clearance, blood urea nitrogen, mean arterial pressure, heart rate and plasma arginine vasopressin concentration were similar. Both drugs caused increases in plasma renin activity at the end of the treatment, whereas plasma aldosterone concentration slightly increased only after torasemide administration. Despite the presence of a trend toward a more pronounced effect on these parameters after torasemide administration, no significant difference between the two treatments was observed. 
Reduction in the frequency of ventricular late potentials after acute myocardial infarction by early thrombolytic therapy. Ventricular late potentials are strong predictors of arrhythmic events after acute myocardial infarction (AMI). To assess the effect of intravenous thrombolysis on the incidence of ventricular late potentials, 223 consecutive patients surviving a first AMI were included in the present study: 59 patients (53 men, 6 women, mean age +/- standard deviation 55 +/- 10 years) received intravenous recombinant tissue-type plasminogen activator (100 mg over 3 hours, group A) and 164 patients (123 men, 41 women, mean age 61 +/- 11 years) received conventional medical treatment (group B). A time-domain signal-averaged electrocardiogram and a high-resolution beat-to-beat recording (gain 10(6), filters 100 to 300 Hz) were performed at 10 +/- 3 days after AMI. There was no difference between group A and B patients in terms of AMI location (anterior in 28 of 59 vs 80 of 164, difference not significant [NS]), mean left ventricular ejection fraction (55 +/- 10 vs 55 +/- 13%, NS), or presence of heart failure (New York Heart Association class III or IV in 12 of 59 vs 40 of 164, NS). The incidence of ventricular late potentials was 10% (6 of 59) in group A and 24% (39 of 164) in group B (p less than 0.05). Among the 146 patients who underwent coronary arteriography, the incidence of ventricular late potentials was 13% (10 of 80) in patients with a patent infarct-related artery and 26% (17 of 66) in patients with an occluded infarct-related artery (p less than 0.05). 
Aztreonam monotherapy as prophylaxis in transurethral resection of the prostate: a multicenter study. The efficacy and safety of aztreonam in the prophylaxis of urinary tract infection following transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP) in patients with preoperatively sterile urine were studied in a multicenter trial including 300 patients at six Italian urology centers. The present report describes the first 192 patients enrolled in the protocol. Aztreonam or placebo was administered to each patient in three doses, which were given at the induction of anesthesia and 8 and 16 hours later. The development of bacteriuria was monitored by cultures of urine obtained before surgery, 3 days later, at removal of the bladder catheter, at discharge from the hospital, and at a follow-up visit 39-46 days after surgery. A febrile peak was observed for 6% of aztreonam-treated patients and for 20.9% of the placebo group (P less than .005), while bacteriuria was reported in 17.9% and 59.3% of these groups, respectively (P less than .001). From our data, TURP appears to be a clean-contaminated procedure requiring antibiotic prophylaxis, and aztreonam appears to reduce significantly the incidence of postoperative bacteriuria after this surgical procedure. 
Ocular findings in Turcot syndrome (glioma-polyposis). Turcot syndrome is a hereditary condition characterized by multiple, adenomatous gastrointestinal polyps associated with neuroepithelial tumors of the central nervous system. The authors examined a patient with Turcot syndrome who had multiple regions of congenital hypertrophy of the retinal pigment epithelium (CHRPE) with areas of surrounding hypopigmentation in the fundi of both eyes. Multiple, bilateral patches of CHRPE have been reported in patients with familial adenomatous polyposis and Gardner syndrome. This finding is thought to be a sensitive and specific clinical marker for these conditions and useful for predicting the presence and development of colorectal polyposis. Our findings provide further evidence that familial adenomatous polyposis, Gardner syndrome, and Turcot syndrome may be related conditions representing the variable phenotypic expression of a single, autosomal dominant genetic disorder. Children and young adults with multiple patches of CHRPE and a family history of adenomatous polyposis may be at increased risk for the development of central nervous system tumors as well as gastrointestinal polyps. 
Hemobilia due to vasculitis of the gall bladder in a patient with mixed connective tissue disease. A 30-year-old woman with mixed connective tissue disease presented with acute abdominal pain and signs of blood loss. At cholecystectomy she appeared to have lost a considerable amount of blood into the biliary tract due to bleeding of the gall bladder. Microscopic examination showed vasculitis of the gall bladder wall. Hemobilia has not been described before as a complication in mixed connective tissue disease. 
Use of a marshmallow bolus for evaluating lower esophageal mucosal rings. Sixty-three patients (35 women, 28 men; mean age 55 yr) with lower esophageal mucosal ring shown radiographically were examined with a semi-solid bolus consisting of a portion of a standard marshmallow. The most common symptom was dysphagia, present in 46 (73%) patients. Impaction of the marshmallow bolus by the ring occurred in 40 (63%) of the 63 patients, and produced symptoms in 27 (68%) of these 40 patients. Nine (14%) rings were detected radiographically only with a solid bolus; eight of these patients had dysphagia and seven rings were 20 mm or less in caliber. Impaction related to ring caliber, and was found in all 17 (100%) rings that were 13 mm or less in diameter, in 17/24 (71%) 14- to 19-mm rings, and in 6/22 (27%) rings 20 mm or more in caliber. Endoscopy in 23 patients detected 16 (70%) rings, and also depended on ring caliber: less than or equal to 13 mm, 6/6 (100%); 14-19 mm, 5/9 (56%); greater than or equal to 20 mm, 5/8 (63%). Marshmallow impaction occurred in 17 (74%) of 23 patients who had endoscopy; three of the 23 patients had normal endoscopy. In conclusion, radiographic examination supplemented by the use of a marshmallow bolus best detects lower esophageal mucosal ring. 
Role of duplex scanning for the detection of atherosclerotic renal artery disease. To assess the accuracy of renal artery duplex scanning for the purpose of diagnosing atherosclerotic renal artery stenosis, we compared the findings of renal arteriograms to the results of duplex scanning in 41 patients. Using an increase of renal artery peak systolic flow velocity of greater than 180 cm/sec, duplex scanning was able to discriminate normal from diseased renal arteries with a sensitivity of 95% and a specificity of 90%. Using the principle that blood flow velocity across a stenosis is roughly proportional to the degree of stenosis, it appeared that a ratio of the peak velocity in the renal artery to the aorta (RAR) of greater 3.5 predicted a greater than 60% diameter reduction of that renal artery, which is felt to be a significant stenosis. Forty-eight vessels were classified as having a greater than 60% diameter reduction by arteriography. Using the RAR of greater than 3.5, duplex scanning agreed in 44 renal arteries (sensitivity 92%). In the 26 renal arteries where arteriography showed a less than 60% diameter reduction, duplex scanning agreed in 16 vessels and correctly detected a focal narrowing in nine of the remaining ten vessels. Ten of 11 occluded renal arteries were correctly identified by duplex scanning. Duplex scanning determined the location of the renal artery lesion with an accuracy of 95% (kappa 0.74). Since duplex scanning can accurately demonstrate and locate focal renal artery stenosis, we believe it may become an accurate screening test for renovascular hypertension. 
Histopathological validation of high frequency epicardial echocardiography of the coronary arteries in vitro. The accuracy and reliability of measurement of coronary artery dimensions and detection of atherosclerotic lesions by high frequency epicardial echocardiography were compared with histopathological results. Ten pressure perfused human hearts were examined in vitro with a 10 MHz (Diasonics) transducer and a 7.5 MHz (Vingmed/Sonotron) transducer. There was close agreement between ultrasound and pathological measurements of coronary artery luminal diameter. Qualitative changes in wall structure such as diffuse wall thickening and calcification were readily identified; however, the resolution of the transducers was not high enough accurately to measure wall dimensions in normal coronary arteries. Coefficient of variation measurements for intra and inter observer variability (5.2% and 6.9% respectively) showed excellent reproducibility. The technique was accurate in identifying atherosclerotic lesions, imaging arteries distal to an occlusion, locating deeply sited arteries, and identifying complete obliteration of an artery. Intraoperative video playback and transducer miniaturisation may minimise problems caused by cardiac movement and restricted access. With these developments intraoperative assessment of coronary artery disease may become a real possibility. 
The natural history of diabetic femoral neuropathy Diabetic femoral neuropathy is an uncommon, unpleasant and sometimes disabling condition, on account of both pain and muscular atrophy, whose long-term prognosis has not previously been documented. We have reviewed a group of 27 patients up to 14 years (median 62 months) after diagnosis; 18 of these were re-examined after an average of nearly 4 years (median 45 months). The condition was more common in non-insulin-dependent diabetics (88 per cent), in men (59 per cent) and in older patients (median age at diagnosis 64 years). The neuropathy was bilateral (10 cases) or unilateral (17 cases); five patients with unilateral neuropathy developed femoral neuropathy on the opposite side, usually within a few weeks of the first episode. Recovery was apparent after 3 months and usually complete by 18 months; only two of the 27 patients had severe relapses. No patients remained disabled, although there were minor residual symptoms and signs in half of the patients (2 cm reduction in thigh circumference and diminished reflexes). The outlook for femoral neuropathy, even in its most severe form, is therefore very good: residual features are demonstrable but do not cause symptoms, and relapses after the first few weeks are very rare. 
Effects of a multidimensional cardiopulmonary rehabilitation program on psychosocial function. The effects of participation in a structured, outpatient cardiac rehabilitation program on psychosocial function after acute myocardial infarction or coronary artery bypass surgery, or both, were evaluated prospectively in 141 patients who were married or living with "a significant other" (89% men, mean [+/- standard deviation] age 63 +/- 9 years old). Forty-one patients who were participants in a 3-month cardiac rehabilitation program were compared with 100 patients who did not participate in a formal program. On average, patients in both groups were well educated, older Caucasians who had minimal cardiac dysfunction (New York Heart Association class I or II). Patients in the 2 groups were not different at baseline in sociodemographic or clinical characteristics or in any of the dependent measures of anxiety, depression, psychosocial adjustment to illness or marital adjustment. Six months after initial testing, patients who attended cardiac rehabilitation were significantly less anxious (F[1,139] = 5.09, p = 0.03), less depressed (F[1,139] = 8.39, p = 0.004), had better psychosocial adjustment (F[1,139] = 5.87, p = 0.02), and were more satisfied with their marriages (F[1,139] = 8.6, p = 0.004) than nonparticipants. The findings support the effectiveness of group cardiac rehabilitation for this subgroup of patients in facilitating their psychosocial recovery after an acute cardiac event. 
Plasma norepinephrine concentrations during resuscitation in the dog. The objective of this study was to evaluate whether the adrenal glands contribute to the increase in plasma norepinephrine concentrations during cardiopulmonary resuscitation, by releasing norepinephrine and/or by secreting epinephrine that facilitates the release of norepinephrine from sympathetic nerve endings via stimulation of presynaptic beta receptors. The experiments were performed in adrenalectomized and in sham-operated dogs. In adrenalectomized dogs the increase in plasma norepinephrine concentrations during cardiopulmonary arrest and basic life support (BLS) was markedly smaller than in sham-operated dogs. Intravenous infusion of physiologic doses of epinephrine during BLS in adrenalectomized animals did not influence the plasma norepinephrine concentrations. These data indicate that, as suggested by others, the marked increase in plasma norepinephrine concentrations during BLS in dogs is mainly of adrenomedullary origin. They also suggest that presynaptic facilitation of norepinephrine release by epinephrine is not important, but further experiments using higher doses of epinephrine are necessary. 
Defective lymphokine-activated killer cell generation and activity in acute leukemia patients with active disease. In 26 myeloid and lymphoid acute leukemia patients at presentation the capacity to generate interleukin-2 (IL-2)-induced lymphokine-activated killer (LAK) cells effective against the natural killer (NK)-resistant Raji cell line, as well as the susceptibility of the blasts to normal peripheral blood (PB) LAK cells and to autologous LAK effectors was analyzed. The overall PB LAK activity against Raji cells was significantly lower in acute leukemia patients compared with normal controls (mean, 1,473 +/- 971 SD LU/10(8) LAK effectors v 3,340 +/- 1,862; P less than .001). The sensitivity of the blasts to autologous LAK cells was also significantly lower than to normal LAK effectors (517 +/- 593 LU/10(8) LAK effectors v 1,304 +/- 1,066; P less than .01). When the data were analyzed independently, four patterns of behavior could be recognized. The relatively largest group (9 of 26) included patients in whom effective LAK cells could be generated against the Raji line, but in whom the blasts were resistant to autologous PB-LAK effectors while being susceptible to normal LAK cells (defective specific LAK activity). In 5 of 26 cases, an incapacity to generate LAK activity against both allogeneic and autologous target cells was observed (defective LAK generation). In six further cases, the blasts were resistant to both allogeneic and autologous LAK populations, though the latter were effective against the Raji line (resistant blasts). The same defects could also be shown with bone marrow-derived LAK cells. Only in six cases did the leukemic blasts appear susceptible to autologous and allogeneic LAK cells. In four patients the analysis could be repeated at remission, and in three a restoration of the LAK function against the primary blasts was recorded. In the 10 cases studied at relapse, the blasts were resistant to autologous LAK effectors in nine and to normal LAK in seven. These data demonstrate that in most acute leukemia patients with active disease, a defect of the LAK machinery, either a deficient generation of LAK cells or the resistance of the blasts to LAK effectors, may be documented, pointing therefore to a possible contributory role of the LAK system in the control of leukemic cell growth. In view of the frequent normalization of the autologous LAK activity at the time of remission, immunotherapy with IL-2/LAK cells should be primarily aimed to patients with minimal residual disease. 
Pharyngeal pouch carcinoma: two unusual cases. Two patients with carcinomata arising in pharyngeal pouches are reported. In one, the tumour was detected preoperatively by a contrast radiographic study. In the second the lesion was a carcinoma in situ. The English literature is reviewed with reference to these two unusual features. 
Middle ear inflammatory mediators and cochlear function. Sensorineural hearing loss (SNHL) has been documented in patients with otitis media. Despite a number of clinical and pathologic works dealing with this common problem, animal studies searching for possible relationships between the middle ear inflammation and cochlear function remain insufficient. Bacterial inoculation and ototoxins and inflammatory products in the middle ear cavity cause SNHL in rodents. Human serum albumin placed in the middle ear cavity in chinchillas also produces SNHL, owing to the effects of nonspecific inflammation in the middle ear cavity. Most of the middle ear inflammatory mediators enter the inner ear through the round window route, and alteration of the permeability of the round window membrane plays an important role in causing cochlear dysfunction. Although an immunologic response in the middle ear plays an important role in otitis media, the immunologic response in the inner ear as it relates to middle ear inflammatory mediators requires further study. 
Cerebrospinal fluid leaks and meningitis in acoustic neuroma surgery. Cerebrospinal fluid leaks and associated meningitis are the most common life-threatening complications of surgery for acoustic neuromas. This retrospective study reviews 319 patients who had surgery for 321 acoustic tumors at the Sunnybrook Health Sciences Center, University of Toronto, from April 1975 to March 1990. Cerebrospinal fluid leaks occurred after 13.4% of primary tumor operations. Surgical repair was required in 6.2% of all patients; 4.4% needed more than one operation. Meningitis occurred in 5.3% of all patients. These complications were more common in larger tumors and after the combined translabyrinthine middle fossa approach. Transnasopharyngeal eustachian tube obliteration was used to stop recurrent cerebrospinal fluid leaks in two patients. 
Progesterone receptor gene restriction fragment length polymorphisms in human breast tumors. We examined the progesterone receptor (PgR) gene in tissue from both primary human breast tumors and normal placentas, detecting restriction fragment length polymorphisms (RFLPs) with the restriction endonucleases Pst I/Sst I and HindIII. There was a general agreement of the Pst I and Sst I polymorphisms in any individual tumor, suggesting that they define two alleles in the human PgR locus, one being characterized by a deletion of about 300 base pairs with respect to the other. Both primary human breast tumor specimens (n = 36) and human term placentas (n = 48) displayed similar allele frequencies and typical mendelian distribution of these Pst I/Sst I alleles. The previously reported HindIII PgR RFLP was also investigated in 132 breast tumors. The HindIII PgR gene RFLP did not display typical mendelian distribution in the breast tumors; the factors affecting the HindIII allele frequencies are presently unknown. Neither the HindIII RFLP nor the deletion defined by Pst I and Sst I correlated with PgR expression as determined by a ligand-binding assay, suggesting that neither is related to the heterogeneity of PgR expression seen in breast tumors. 
Destructive lesions in demyelinating disease. Three cases are presented in which clinical and radiological features suggested the diagnosis of glioma but surgical biopsy revealed a demyelinating process, with tissue destruction and cyst formation in two. One patient had clinically definite multiple sclerosis. Two had probable acute disseminated encephalomyelitis. Treatment with high dose steroids is appropriate when there is clinical or investigative evidence to suggest the presence of demyelinating disease, before deciding on biopsy. 
Transmural distribution of myocardial edema by NMR relaxometry following myocardial ischemia and reperfusion. To determine the distribution and extent of myocardial edema resulting from ischemia and reperfusion, seven open-chest dogs underwent occlusion of the left circumflex coronary artery for 2 hours (group I), and 10 underwent occlusion for 2 hours and reperfusion for 2 hours (group II). Proton nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (T1 and T2 relaxation times) and percent water content were determined to quantitate the amount of edema. There was a transmural increase of the T1 relaxation time of the central ischemic zone in groups I and II, although this increase was significantly greater in group II in both the subendocardium (group I = 707.8 +/- 12.5 msec, group II = 813.2 +/- 36.2 msec; p less than 0.01) and subepicardium (group I = 641.7 +/- 20.5 msec, group II = 760.5 +/- 34.7 msec; p less than 0.01). These increases were also observed in the T2 weighted relaxation time in the subendocardium (group I = 54.7 +/- 0.8 msec, group II = 78.7 +/- 6.3 msec; p less than 0.005) and subepicardium (group I = 54.0 +/- 1.4 msec, group II = 73.1 +/- 4.0 msec; p less than 0.001). Transmural differences were evident between the myocardial layers with increased T1 relaxation times (p less than 0.01) in the subendocardium in both groups. Similar increases were noted in the percent water content of the myocardium. Thus T1 and T2 relaxation times lengthened with an increase in myocardial water content following occlusion, and these relaxation times were augmented by reperfusion. We conclude that ischemia-induced edema occurs in a transmural distribution from subendocardium to subepicardium following occlusion, and this edema is further enhanced by reperfusion. 
Tubal occlusion after inguinal hernia repair. A case report. Midtubal occlusion and infertility occurred subsequent to an inguinal hernia repair. Recognition of the traumatic etiology is important because other causes of midtubal obstruction, such as endometriosis, tuberculosis and adenomatoid tumor of the oviduct, may be considered contraindications to reconstructive surgery. Once recognized, the condition is highly amendable to microsurgical reconstruction. 
Role of fine catheter peritoneal cytology and laparoscopy in the management of acute abdominal pain. Laparoscopy and fine catheter peritoneal cytology (FCPC) have been advocated as aids in the assessment of acute abdominal pain. In all, 411 patients admitted to a district general hospital during a 10-month period were managed using a standard protocol incorporating these techniques. After initial assessment by a surgical registrar, 151 patients were excluded from further progress through the protocol (age less than 16 years, definite diagnosis made or contraindication to FCPC. The remaining 260 patients were placed in one of four management groups: (A) urgent operation (23 patients); (B) 'look and see' (40 patients); (C) 'wait and see' (59 patients); (D) urgent operation not indicated (138 patients). Eighty-eight of 99 patients (88 per cent) in groups B and C, where the need for operation was uncertain, underwent successful FCPC and 39 patients (39 per cent) underwent laparoscopy. In these patients the initial registrar management decision proved to be incorrect in 33 cases (33 per cent), but by following the protocol the number of management errors actually made was reduced to 13 (13 per cent, P less than 0.001). This would have been reduced to 8 per cent if the protocol had not been violated in five patients. This study demonstrates the effectiveness of a protocol using FCPC and laparoscopy to improve the management of patients with acute abdominal pain. 
Association between the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome and infection with Salmonella typhi or Salmonella paratyphi in an endemic typhoid area. Eight cases of typhoid and paratyphoid fever were identified during a 4-year period in a cohort of 117 patients who were positive for human immunodeficiency virus in Lima, Peru. Asymptomatic patients with human immunodeficiency virus infection and patients with the lymphadenopathy syndrome had a typical clinical presentation and response to therapy. Patients with the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome who were culture positive for Salmonella typhi or Salmonella paratyphi presented with fulminant diarrhea and/or colitis; the two patients for whom at least 2 months of follow-up were available relapsed. In our cohort there were 0.06 cases of typhoid or paratyphoid per patient year of observation; this rate is approximately 60 times that in the general population in Lima, and 25 times that in the 15- to 35-year-old age group. Our data indicate that patients who are positive for human immunodeficiency virus are at significantly increased risk for infection with S typhi and S paratyphi, and suggest that the clinical presentation of these diseases in patients with the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome differs from that seen immunocompetent hosts. 
The roles of extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy and percutaneous nephrostolithotomy in the management of pyelocaliceal diverticula. Various combinations of extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy (ESWL*) and percutaneous nephrostolithotomy were used in the treatment of 40 stone-containing caliceal diverticula in 39 patients (16 men and 23 women). Only 1 of 26 patients (4%) treated with ESWL as a single modality became stone-free, although 9 (36%) became asymptomatic. Ten patients undergoing ESWL primarily eventually required percutaneous nephrostolithotomy due to persistence of symptoms and all became stone-free. A total of 14 patients underwent a percutaneous approach as a single modality, and the diverticula in 13 of these patients became stone-free, although 2 patients did have residual parenchymal fragments. Therefore, 21 of 24 patients (87.5%) became completely free of stones using the percutaneous approach. All patients managed with percutaneous nephrostolithotomy became free of symptoms. The complex nature of access during percutaneous nephrostolithotomy favors a 1-stage approach with direct puncture into the stone-containing diverticulum. Simultaneous fulguration of the diverticulum at percutaneous nephrostolithotomy is favored, since all 17 patients in whom this technique was used had complete obliteration of the diverticulum on followup contrast studies. These data suggest that caliceal diverticula should be managed with percutaneous nephrostolithotomy, since ESWL monotherapy is unlikely to produce a stone-free or symptom-free status. 
Five-year survival for cisplatin-based chemotherapy versus single-agent melphalan in patients with advanced ovarian cancer and optimal debulking surgery. The purpose of this study was to evaluate 5-year survival and 5-year progression-free survival in previously untreated patients with advanced ovarian cancer treated with single-agent melphalan in which very few patients underwent optimal debulking surgery (less than 2 cm residual) as compared with the patients treated with Cisplatin-based chemotherapy in which most patients underwent optimal debulking surgery. Significant increases in 5-year survival and 5-year progression-free survival were noted as we changed from the melphalan trial, in which only 14% underwent optimal debulking surgery, to PAC-H, in which 57% and the PAC trial in which 90%, respectively, underwent optimal debulking surgery. However, for those patients whose tumors were optimally debulked in the three trials, there were no statistically significant differences in median survival, median progression-free survival, 5-year survival, or 5-year progression-free survival in those patients treated with melphalan, PAC-H, or PAC. Without optimal debulking surgery, Cisplatin-based multiagent chemotherapy offered a small survival advantage. These results are similar to that reported by Gruppo Interregionale Cooperativo Oncologico Ginecologia, in which survival curves were identical for all the subgroups of chemotherapy regimens for those patients with residual disease less than 2 cm at the onset of chemotherapy whether they received (1) cyclophosphamide; (2) cyclophosphamide and Adriamycin; (3) cyclophosphamide, Adriamycin, and Cisplatin; (4) cyclophosphamide, Adriamycin, and hexamethylmelamine; (5) Cisplatin and cyclophosphamide; (6) low-dose Cisplatin; (7) high-dose Cisplatin; or (8) carboplatin. 
Menstrual symptoms in women with pelvic endometriosis. OBJECTIVE--To investigate menstrual symptoms in relation to pelvic pathology. DESIGN--A prospective questionnaire-based study. SETTING--Aberdeen Royal Infirmary, Scotland. SUBJECTS--1250 questionnaires were sent out prior to planned admission and 1200 women (96%) brought the completed questionnaires. They comprised 598 women undergoing laparoscopic sterilization, 312 having laparoscopy because of infertility, 156 having laparoscopy because of chronic pelvic pain and 134 women undergoing abdominal hysterectomy for dysfunctional uterine bleeding. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES--The occurrence of dysmenorrhoea, menorrhagia, menstrual regularity, premenstrual spotting, deep dyspareunia and pelvic pain in women with either endometriosis and post infective pelvic adhesions or a normal pelvis. RESULTS--Menorrhagia, menstrual irregularity and premenstrual spotting occurred with equal frequency in all groups. Deep dyspareunia, pain after intercourse and recurrent pain unrelated to menstruation or coitus was more common in women with endometriosis and those with post infective pelvic adhesions than in those with a normal pelvis. Dysmenorrhoea appears to be more prevalent among women having endometriosis. CONCLUSIONS--Menstrual symptoms, while raising a high index of suspicion for endometriosis, are not entirely reliable as indicators of disease. Dysmenorrhoea is the most common reported symptom in endometriosis sufferers. Diagnostic laparoscopy should be considered before institution of treatment in women complaining of pelvic pain and menstrual symptoms. 
In vitro maturation of mononuclear phagocytes and susceptibility to HIV-1 infection. In the present report, we have studied the in vitro transition of normal blood monocytes to macrophages by changes in cell morphology, and the expression of surface antigens with a panel of monoclonal antibodies. The maturation process was accompanied by notable changes in cell-surface markers in a time-dependent manner. The percentage of cells expressing CD11c, ICAM-1, HLA-DR, and Fc receptor class III increased while the CD4 and CD35 expression was markedly decreased. After demonstrating that in vitro monocytes mature to macrophages in a recognizable manner, we studied the susceptibility to HIV-1 infection at time points representing different stages of cell maturation. The results show that monocyte/macrophages are susceptible to HIV-1 infection at all stages of differentiation. However, the kinetics of virus replication depends on the degree of maturation at the time of infection. Two major patterns of replication were observed: Infection of monocytes resulted in efficient virus production measurable by reverse transcriptase activity in culture supernatant, whereas infection of fully differentiated macrophages yielded low but sustained virus release only demonstrable by p24 antigen assay. We were not able to detect differences in the capacity of the virus to infect and replicate in monocyte/macrophages with respect to cellular origin of the virus isolate and whether the viruses were laboratory-adapted strains or low-passaged patient isolates. 
Strategy for management of distal ileal Crohn's disease. We have determined the outcome of a defined policy for the management of distal ileal Crohn's disease using a prospective computer-based analysis of 139 patients diagnosed between 1970 and 1988 with a mean follow-up of 10 years. The policy in outline consists of conservative treatment for acute obstructive episodes, resection or strictureplasty for recurrent obstructive episodes, surgical treatment for abscess and fistula formation and specific medical treatment (corticosteroids, immunosuppressive therapy or metronidazole) for symptomatic non-obstructive disease. Twenty-nine patients had a benign course without resection. The remainder were treated surgically at some time but only 28 of these patients had specific treatment before operation. Thirty-three needed more than one resection and five needed more than three surgical procedures. Immediate, early or delayed surgical treatment did not affect the reoperation rates or the long-term outcome. Eleven patients died, ten of causes unrelated to Crohn's disease. Of the 128 living patients, 114 are fit and well, and only two are currently taking specific medication. Fourteen are unwell of whom six either need or have refused further surgery which could restore them to good health. This management policy has achieved excellent long-term results in nearly all patients, and our findings suggest that the timing of surgery and its nature are more important in determining outcome than specific medical therapy. 
Diphenhydramine toxicity in three children with varicella-zoster infection. Diphenhydramine hydrochloride is an antihistamine with anticholinergic properties that is frequently used both orally and topically for the temporary relief of pruritus. Significant systemic absorption may occur following topical administration of diphenhydramine in patients with varicella-zoster lesions. We describe three children with varicella-zoster infection (VZI) who developed bizarre behavior as well as visual and auditory hallucinations following topical applications of large amounts of diphenhydramine to the majority of skin surfaces. In two cases, oral diphenhydramine was also administered. Serum diphenhydramine concentrations approximated or exceeded those previously reported. In each case, a complete resolution of mental status abnormalities occurred within 24 hours after discontinuation of all diphenhydramine-containing products. Pharmacists and other health professionals should be aware of the potential toxicity of topical diphenhydramine in patients with VZI. 
Symptomatic cerebral vasospasm following tumor resection: report of two cases. The authors report two cases of symptomatic cerebral vasospasm following resection of an acoustic neuroma and a left sphenoid wing meningioma. Vascular spasm was documented by transcranial Doppler and angiography studies. Both patients responded to hypervolemic therapy. Possible mechanisms contributing to this rare complication are discussed. 
Posterior cricoarytenoid activity in normal adults during involuntary and voluntary hyperventilation. The effect of isocapnic hypoxia and hyperoxic hypercapnia on the electrical activity of the posterior cricoarytenoid (PCA) muscle was determined in eight normal adult humans by use of standard rebreathing techniques and was compared with PCA activity during voluntary hyperventilation performed under isocapnic and hypocapnic conditions. PCA activity was recorded with intramuscular hooked-wire electrodes implanted through a fiberoptic nasopharyngoscope. During quiet breathing in all subjects, the PCA was phasically active on inspiration and tonically active throughout the respiratory cycle. At comparable increments in respiratory output, hypercapnia, hypoxia, and voluntary hyperventilation appeared to be associated with similar increases in phasic or tonic PCA activity. During quiet breathing, the onset of phasic PCA activity usually occurred before inspiratory airflow and extended beyond the start of expiratory airflow. The duration of phasic PCA preactivation and postinspiratory phasic PCA activity remained unchanged during progressive hypercapnia and progressive hypoxia. The results, in combination with recent findings for vocal cord adductors, suggest that vocal cord position throughout the respiratory cycle during hyperpnea is actively controlled by simultaneously acting and antagonistic intrinsic laryngeal muscles. 
Isolated cryptococcosis of the adrenal gland. A case of isolated adrenal cryptococcosis is reported. A patient with a history of diabetes mellitus had symptoms of left flank pain. Roentgenological and sonographic findings of the adrenal gland were indicative of a malignant tumour. Tissue obtained from surgery showed fungal granuloma and a poorly encapsulated cryptococcal organism was identified by special stains. A post-operative serum cryptococcal antigen test was positive, and the patient was successfully treated with surgery and a course of amphotericin B. After a 7-month follow-up period, there is no evidence of recurrence or dissemination. 
Dexamethasone therapy in neonatal chronic lung disease: an international placebo-controlled trial. Collaborative Dexamethasone Trial Group. In a multicenter trial of steroid therapy for chronic neonatal oxygen dependence, 287 neonates were randomly allocated from around 3 weeks of age, to dexamethasone or placebo. Active treatment significantly reduced the duration of further assisted ventilation among infants who were ventilator dependent at entry (median days for survivors, 11 vs 17.5). There were no statistically significant differences between the total groups of survivors in time receiving supplemental oxygen and length of stay in hospital, although the trend favored the dexamethasone group. Twenty-five infants in each group died prior to hospital discharge; most were ventilator dependent at trial entry. Open treatment with steroids was later given to 18% in the active group and to 43% in the placebo group. There was no evidence of serious side effects; in particular, infection rates were similar in the two groups. 
Hemodynamic consequences of desmopressin administration after cardiopulmonary bypass. Desmopressin acetate is used to reduce blood loss after cardiac surgery. However, there have been reports that hypotension can occur with infusion of desmopressin and that postoperative blood loss is not reduced. In this randomized, double-blinded study, we investigated the effects of desmopressin on hemodynamics, coagulation, and postoperative blood loss in patients undergoing primary elective coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG). After reversal of heparin effect, 20 patients received desmopressin 0.3 micrograms.kg-1, infused over 15 min, and 20 patients received a placebo. Desmopressin produced a small but significant decrease in diastolic blood pressure when compared with the placebo (50.8 mmHg vs. 57.6 mmHg for the desmopressin- and placebo-treated groups, respectively; P = 0.0372). A 20% or greater decrease in mean arterial pressure was observed in 7 of 20 patients receiving desmopressin, whereas only one patient in the placebo-treated group experienced a decrease of this magnitude (P = 0.0177). Reductions in arterial pressure were secondary to decreases in systemic vascular resistance (SVR) (mean SVR before and after the drug infusion, 1,006 and 766 dyn.s.cm-5, respectively, for the desmopressin-treated group; and 994 and 1,104 dyn.s.cm-5, respectively, for the placebo-treated group; P = 0.0078). 
Cutaneous metastasis from papillary carcinoma of the thyroid gland. Cutaneous metastases from carcinoma of the thyroid gland are rare. We present the clinical, histologic, and immunohistochemical features of a solitary metastasis from papillary carcinoma of the thyroid. Our results indicate that this tumor can produce epithelial mucin and, therefore, must be differentiated from other metastatic carcinomas and from primary apocrine tumors of the skin. Positive staining for thyroglobulin confirmed the diagnosis in this case. 
Fibrous lesions of the gingiva: a histopathologic analysis of 204 cases. Two hundred four cases of fibrous lesions of the gingiva were studied histologically for the presence of calcified tissue, the nature of the connective tissue, the type of keratinization, and the degree of epithelial thickness. Initially these lesions were subcategorized into four specific entities, namely fibrous epulis, fibroepithelial polyp, calcifying fibroblastic granuloma, and ossifying fibrous epulis. It was found that 46.5% of the lesions contained calcifications. The connective tissue was represented predominantly by either the collagenous type (50.5%) or the mixed (cellular and collagenous) type (44.6%). It was also found that 36% of the lesions were ulcerated, and, of these, 79.5% were associated with the cellular type of connective tissue and calcifications. In an attempt to subcategorize the fibrous lesions into specific entities, it was found that 32 cases (15.7%) had mixed features. This fact supports the suggestion that these lesions are stages in the spectrum of a single disease process and should collectively be termed fibroblastic gingival lesions. However, it is also suggested that the two terms, namely peripheral fibroma and fibrous epulis with and without ossification, should be retained whereas the usage of other terminologies should be avoided. 
Significance of ipsilateral breast tumour recurrence after lumpectomy. Breast cancer treatment trials from the US National Surgical Adjuvant Breast and Bowel Project have established breast-conserving operations as a replacement for radical mastectomy (NSABP B-04), and have shown that in terms of survival free from distant disease there was no significant difference between lumpectomy, lumpectomy plus breast irradiation, and total mastectomy (NSABP B-06). 9-year follow-up data from B-06 are used here to address the issue of ipsilateral breast tumour recurrence (IBTR) and the development of distant disease, a question with important clinical and biological implications. A Cox regression model on fixed co-variates (ie, features such as tumour type or size present at surgery and not subsequently alterable) and on IBTR, which is time dependent and not fixed, revealed that the risk of distant disease was 3.41 times greater after adjustment for co-variates in patients in whom an IBTR developed. IBTR proved to be a powerful independent predictor of distant disease. However, it is a marker of risk for, not a cause of, distant metastasis. While mastectomy or breast irradiation following lumpectomy prevent expression of the marker they do not lower the risk of distant disease. These findings further justify the use of lumpectomy. 
Prevalence of peripheral neuropathy in the Parsi community of Bombay. We carried out a door-to-door survey to screen for neurologic diseases, including peripheral neuropathy, in a community of 14,010 Parsis living in housing colonies in Bombay, India. The most common neurologic disorder was peripheral neuropathy with 334 cases (2,384 cases/100,000 population). The most common neuropathy was compressive, with diabetes the most common noncompressive etiology. There was no leprosy, and nutritional neuropathies were rare. 
A pilot study of neoadjuvant chemotherapy with 5-fluorouracil and cisplatin with surgical resection and postoperative radiation therapy and/or chemotherapy in adenocarcinoma of the esophagus. Fifteen patients with potentially resectable adenocarcinoma of the esophagus were treated with two cycles of preoperative chemotherapy with 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) and cisplatin (DDP). Response to chemotherapy was evaluated by comparative barium swallow, computerized chest tomography, esophagoscopy, and change in clinical symptomatology. Eleven patients (73%) were resected, two (13%) were explored and found inoperable, and two (13%) were not subjected to surgery (one because of death related to toxicity and one due to progressive disease). Ten of eleven patients (91%) had gross residual tumor. One patient (9%) had residual microscopic disease only. One patient (7%) had complete clinical responses (CCR), five (33%) had partial clinical response (PCR), and nine (60%) had no response (NR). Five of 15 patients (or 45% of resected patients) remain free of disease. Median survival time was 18.47 months for all patients and 23.83 months for resected patients. 
Duodenobronchial fistula. Duodenobronchial fistulas are an extremely rare subgroup of abdominobronchial fistulas, which include bronchobiliary, gastrobronchial, enterobronchial, colobronchial, and splenobronchial fistulas. Only one case of a duodenobronchial fistula has been previously reported. Duodenobronchial fistulas occur as a complication of a duodenal injury. The characteristic symptoms are a cough that produces copious bilious secretions, shortness of breath, and fever. The diagnosis is made by contrast gastrointestinal studies. Treatment requires an abdominal approach with interruption of the fistula at its duodenal origin and control of the inciting inflammatory process. With prompt diagnosis and treatment, thoracic drainage or pulmonary resection should not be needed. 
Peritoneopericardial diaphragmatic hernia discovered at coronary bypass operation. A 68-year-old man was discovered to have a large peritoneopericardial hernia when operated on for coronary artery bypass. Such hernias are very unusual. The pathogenesis, clinical presentation, and management of this problem are discussed. 
Acute necrotizing pancreatitis: management by planned, staged pancreatic necrosectomy/debridement and delayed primary wound closure over drains. We reviewed our recent experience with management of 23 consecutive patients with acute necrotizing pancreatitis. All patients had documented necrotizing pancreatitis with parenchymal or peripancreatic necrosis. Our method of treatment has evolved from our previous approach of controlled open lesser sac drainage (marsupialization) to staged necrosectomy/debridement with delayed primary closure over drains. With this latter approach, hospital mortality was 4 of 23 patients (17 per cent), but significant morbidity still occurred in 12 of 23 patients (52 per cent). However, recurrent intra-abdominal abscess before discharge occurred in only one patient. We believe that this operative approach toward the severely ill patient with acute necrotizing pancreatitis who requires operative intervention will minimize the occurrence of intra-abdominal sepsis. 
CT of the pancreas in children. CT has become a frequently used imaging method for evaluating suspected pancreatic disease in children. Although the spectrum of CT findings in pancreatic disease is well documented in adults, there is a paucity of such information in children. Familiarity with CT patterns of pancreatic disease in childhood is important for diagnosis. In this essay, we illustrate the CT findings of pancreatic lesions in children. 
Pectus excavatum: a 15-year perspective. Pectus excavatum is relatively uncommon. Our experience with 177 children during a 15-year period produced changes in our surgical technique, which now includes a small transverse incision, minimal subcutaneous flap elevation, a muscle-relaxing incision over the fifth costal cartilage, complete resection of involved cartilage, use of Adkins' strut, suspension of sternum to strut, taut reefing of intercostal muscle, no tubes or drains, epidural analgesia, a patient-controlled analgesia device postoperatively, and eventual strut removal. Use of the evolved technique gives excellent cosmetic results, good functional results with minimal discomfort, and a shorter convalescent period. 
False aneurysm of the right internal mammary artery. False aneurysm of the internal mammary artery is an uncommon complication of median sternotomy. Clinical and radiological findings of 2 such cases are presented. At operative exploration neither was directly related to the presence of a sternal wire. 
Hypercarbic acidosis reduces cardiac resuscitability. BACKGROUND AND METHODS: Marked increases in myocardial hypercarbia and acidosis accompany cardiac arrest and resuscitation. To investigate whether hypercarbic acidosis independent of oxygenation is of itself detrimental to cardiac resuscitation, three groups of six Sprague-Dawley rats were ventilated with gas mixtures containing concentrations of inspired CO2 (FICO2) of 0.0, 0.3, or 0.5, with oxygen fractions held constant at 0.5. After 4 mins of ventricular fibrillation, mechanical chest compressions were initiated with a pneumatic thumper; 2 mins later, transthoracic defibrillation was attempted. RESULTS: Each animal ventilated with FICO2 of 0.0 or 0.3 was successfully resuscitated. However, none of the animals ventilated with FICO2 of 0.5, in which aortic pH was less than 6.67 and aortic PCO2 was greater than 200 torr (greater than 26.7 kPa), was resuscitated (p less than .001). This finding contrasted with a second control group of seven identically treated animals which, in the absence of cardiac arrest, demonstrated no adverse effects after ventilation with an FICO2 of 0.5. CONCLUSIONS: Increases in FICO2 to levels of 0.5 under conditions of constant arterial oxygenation and controlled coronary perfusion pressure preclude successful resuscitation in this rodent model of CPR. 
Endoscopic balloon dilatation as a therapeutic option in the management of intestinal strictures resulting from Crohn's disease. Endoscopic balloon dilatation was undertaken in seven patients who presented with obstructive symptoms resulting from Crohn's disease. Five patients had strictures from recurrent disease at the site of an ileotransverse anastomosis, one had duodenal stenosis and one a colonic stricture. The procedures were performed under intravenous sedation on one to four occasions (median 2) and were uncomplicated. Sustained improvement over an 18-24-month follow-up period was achieved in five patients, but dilatation was unsuccessful in two cases. Endoscopic balloon dilatation is a safe and effective option in selected patients with intestinal strictures resulting from Crohn's disease and may overcome the need for surgery. 
Definitive diagnosis of breast implant rupture by ultrasonography. Silicone breast implantation is entering its fourth decade. Our ability to monitor the integrity of "old" prostheses is questioned. Clinical and mammographic examinations are reliable indicators of implant rupture only if there has been gel migration away from the implant pocket. Ultrasonography is presented as a reliable, sensitive method of evaluation of implant integrity. It should be considered the definitive study of prosthesis integrity. When sonography is added to mammographic and clinical examination, the preoperative evaluation of symptomatic augmented breasts is complete. Ultrasonography may be considered with mammography in the routine breast examination of all previously augmented patients. 
External fistulas arising from the digestive tract. External abdominal fistulas that arise from the digestive tract are associated with high mortality and prolonged morbidity in terms of infection, malnutrition, and skin excoriation. Such external fistulas most commonly follow anastomotic leak after gastrointestinal surgery. We identified 58 patients seen over a 5-year period at the University of Louisville Hospitals because of external abdominal fistulas that arose from the stomach (8), duodenum (4), small intestine (26), colon (14), biliary tract (9), and pancreas (7). Fifteen patients had multiple fistulas and 32 had high-output fistulas (greater than 200 mL/day). Closure was achieved in 48 patients, and eight of the 10 patients whose fistulas remained open died. Overall mortality was 19%. Principles of management include control of infection, correction of fluid and electrolyte imbalance, nutritional support, proper wound care, and often operative intervention. Multiple staged operations over many months were particularly important in managing complex wounds with large abdominal wall defects and multiple fistulas. Fistula closure is the ultimate goal, and patience is important to achieve it. 
Neurogenic pulmonary edema: treatment with dobutamine. In the case of a patient with complicating subarachnoid hemorrhage, an infusion of dobutamine was followed by a massive diuresis and regression of severe neurogenic pulmonary edema. It is suggested that the reduction in total peripheral vascular resistance and the increase in cardiac contractility accounts for the observed beneficial effect and indicate that dobutamine is a suitable drug for the treatment of neurogenic pulmonary edema. 
Rhabdomyolysis and cutaneous necrosis following intravenous vasopressin infusion. A continuous IV infusion of vasopressin was administrated to a patient with cirrhosis of the liver and acute gastrointestinal bleeding from esophageal varices. In the first 24 hours, the patient developed rhabdomyolysis and cutaneous necrosis. Stopping vasopressin infusion resulted in relief of these lesions. The rarity of these complications suggests an idiosyncratic reaction of susceptible individuals that may be related to previous vascular disease or a failure in baroreceptor regulation. 
Health benefits of aerobic exercise. Regular aerobic exercise has significant cardiovascular benefits, including a reduction in incidence of and mortality from coronary artery disease--probably because of positive effects on blood lipid levels and blood pressure. Aerobic exercise can also be an important adjunct to a weight-loss program. Many persons who continue an exercise program do so because of its positive mental benefits, including reduction in anxiety and depression and modulation of stress levels. Aerobic exercise has a place in the management of diabetes, pregnancy, and aging. The problems associated with aerobic exercise are minimal compared with its benefits. 
Low back pain: review of diagnosis and therapy. Low back pain is a patient complaint frequently encountered in the emergency department setting. The disease entity is often a diagnostic challenge with a subtle presentation, but can be accompanied by significant neurovascular complications. Current topics of controversy include the utility of radiologic evaluation, pharmacologic and holistic treatment strategies, as well as guidelines for urgent referral of patients with lumbar pain. 
Color Doppler imaging provides accurate assessment of orbital blood flow in occlusive carotid artery disease. Color Doppler imaging was used to evaluate the hemodynamics of the ophthalmic vasculature in a case of complete internal carotid artery occlusion. This procedure, which allows rapid, noninvasive imaging, showed a partial ophthalmic artery obstruction with absent flow in the central retinal artery, central retinal vein, and nasal posterior ciliary arteries. Although altered perfusion of the retinal vessels may be evaluated clinically, assessment of blood flow in the ophthalmic and ciliary arteries previously could be evaluated only indirectly by intravenous fluorescein angiography. The color Doppler imaging findings were confirmed by intravenous fluorescein angiography and carotid arteriography. Color Doppler imaging represents a noninvasive method to diagnose abnormal blood flow of the ophthalmic artery and its branches and to evaluate serial changes of the circulation in a noninvasive manner. 
Association of hypovolemia after subarachnoid hemorrhage with computed tomographic scan evidence of raised intracranial pressure. Hypovolemic patients are more likely to suffer delayed cerebral ischemia and infarction after a subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH). Prompt recognition and correction of hypovolemia may improve the outcome. We have identified computed tomographic (CT) scan findings that increase the probability of a patient presenting with hypovolemia soon after an SAH. The plasma volume (PV) of 25 patients admitted within 96 hours of an SAH was measured using radioiodinated serum albumin. The normal PVs were measured in an outpatient setting 6 months later or predicted from their total body water. Nine patients (36%) were found to be hypovolemic, defined as a fall in PV exceeding 10% of the normal PV (mean fall, 18 +/- 2%). Sixteen patients were normovolemic or hypervolemic (mean PV, +9 +/- 2%). The basal cisterns were compressed or obliterated on the CT scans of all hypovolemic patients compared with 12.5% of normovolemic patients (chi-square, 14.52; P less than 0.01). The probabilities of a patient being hypovolemic if the CT scan indicated raised intracranial pressure were high: hydrocephalus, P = 0.80; compression of the basal cisterns, P = 0.82; and compression of the basal cisterns associated with intracerebral hematoma or midline shift, P = 1.00. Patients with an SAH and radiological evidence of raised intracranial pressure should be considered at particular risk for systemic hypovolemia. 
Benign spinal nerve sheath tumors: their occurrence sporadically and in neurofibromatosis types 1 and 2. Benign spinal nerve sheath tumors (neurofibromas and schwannomas) often occur on dorsal nerve roots sporadically or in neurofibromatosis types 1 and 2. These are histologically benign tumors, and distinction between them is frequently not made by clinicians. To determine if there is a correlation between the histological pattern of benign spinal nerve sheath tumors and the type of neurofibromatosis, the clinical and pathological features of these tumors (86 surgical specimens and five autopsies) in 68 patients were reviewed. The patients were classified into one of four categories: neurofibromatosis type 1, neurofibromatosis type 2, uncertain, or sporadic. The diagnostic criteria used for neurofibromatosis types 1 and 2 were established by the National Institutes of Health. Patients who did not fulfill criteria for either neurofibromatosis type 1 or 2 but who had multiple nervous system tumors or other stigmata of neurofibromatosis were designated "uncertain." Spinal nerve sheath tumors were considered sporadic in 42 cases (40 schwannomas and two neurofibromas). In the 14 patients with neurofibromatosis type 1, all spinal nerve sheath tumors were neurofibromas. In six of the seven patients with neurofibromatosis type 2, all spinal nerve sheath tumors were schwannomas. One patient with neurofibromatosis type 2 had a spinal nerve sheath schwannoma and a tumor with features of both tumor types. The authors conclude that spinal nerve sheath tumors in patients with neurofibromatosis type 1 are neurofibromas. In contrast, spinal nerve sheath tumors occurring in neurofibromatosis type 2 or sporadically are most frequently schwannomas. The distinct histological features of these tumors may reflect different pathogenetic mechanisms even though they arise at identical sites in neurofibromatosis types 1 and 2. 
The effect of decompression on the natural course of spinal stenosis. A comparison of surgically treated and untreated patients. The clinical course of 19 untreated patients with spinal stenosis (mean age, 60 years) was compared with that of 44 patients treated surgically (mean age, 65 years). The time of follow-up was 31 and 53 months, respectively. About 80% of the patients had neurogenic intermittent claudication. In the follow-up, one third of the treated and one half of the untreated patients still had neurogenic claudication. By visual analogue-scale estimation, 60% of those treated surgically and 33% of the untreated patients felt better. Fifty-eight percent of the untreated patients were unchanged. Neurophysiologic changes showed progression in almost all cases; it was more pronounced in the treated patients. No proof of severe deterioration was found in the untreated patients, and observation for 2-3 years seems to be a good alternative to surgery. 
Continuous monitoring of cerebral oxygenation in acute brain injury: injection of mannitol during hyperventilation. Global cerebral oxygenation, perfusion pressure, and expired pCO2 were continuously monitored in 10 adults with acute severe closed head trauma. Cerebral oxygenation was monitored by fiberoptic catheter oximetry, which allowed simultaneous measurements of arterial and jugular bulb oxyhemoglobin saturation. Intracranial pressure levels over 20 mm Hg were recorded several times in all patients, in spite of sedation, muscle paralysis, and profound hyperventilation. Intracranial hypertension was frequently associated with oligemic cerebral hypoxia, identified as abnormally low jugular oxygen saturation in the presence of normal arterial oxygenation. Intracranial hypertension was then managed with intravenous administration of mannitol boluses, which yielded simultaneous decreases in intracranial pressure and increases in cerebral oxygenation to highly statistically significant levels. Monitoring cerebral oxygenation was clinically useful because it allowed identification of impaired cerebral oxygenation even when cerebral perfusion pressure was normal. It is therefore proposed as a new monitoring technique, to supplement conventional monitoring of cerebral perfusion pressure. 
Chronic central nervous system effects of acute organophosphate pesticide intoxication. The Pesticide Health Effects Study Group. Acute organophosphate pesticide poisonings cause substantial morbidity and mortality world wide; however, whether organophosphates cause chronic neurological sequelae has not been established. To see whether single episodes of acute unintentional organophosphate intoxication lead to chronic neuropsychological dysfunction, we carried out a retrospective study of agricultural workers in Nicaragua who had been admitted to hospital between July 1, 1986, and July 31, 1988, for occupationally related organophosphate intoxication. This "poisoned" group (36 men) was tested on average about two years after the episode of pesticide poisoning and compared with a matched control group. The poisoned group did much worse than the control group on all neuropsychological subtests, with significantly worse performance on five of six subtests of a World Health Organisation neuropsychological test battery and on 3 of 6 additional tests that assessed verbal and visual attention, visual memory, visuomotor speed, sequencing and problem solving, and motor steadiness and dexterity. Differences in neuropsychological performance could not be explained by other factors. The findings of a persistent decrease in neuropsychological performance among individuals with previous intoxication emphasise the importance of prevention of even single episodes of organophosphate poisoning. 
Preoperative and intraoperative fine needle aspiration cytology of pancreatic lesions. The aim of the present study was to describe our experience from 1976 through 1988 with fine needle aspiration (FNA) cytology of pancreatic lesions in 90 patients. Fine needle aspirations were performed preoperatively under ultrasound guidance (USG) in 46 patients, under computed tomographic guidance (CTG) in seven patients, and intraoperatively in 37 patients. Based on histologic, cytologic, and clinical findings, final diagnoses were reached in 80 patients, of whom 62 had malignant pancreatic disease (MPD) and 18 had benign pancreatic disease (BPD). The accuracy of cytologic diagnoses was verified by histologic, cytologic, and clinical findings. In 62 patients with MPD, the cytologic findings suggested malignancy in 54 patients, suspected malignancy in five, and did not reveal malignancy in three patients. Among 18 patients with BPD, all of the cytologic findings were reported as benign. The sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values, and diagnostic accuracy for intraoperative FNA cytologic results were 96%, 100%, 100%, 91%, and 97%, respectively, and for USG FNA cytologic results were 94%, 100%, 100%, 78%, and 95%, respectively. No complications followed the procedure. Conclusions: Both transabdominal percutaneous imaging-guided and intraoperative FNA cytology of pancreatic lesions are simple, safe, and highly accurate methods in differentiation of benign from malignant pancreatic lesions. 
Stress erosive gastritis. Bleeding from stress erosive gastritis continues to be a potential problem in critically ill and injured patients, but fortunately its incidence has decreased dramatically over the last decade. The explanation for this circumstance is probably multifactorial, but clearly relates to our increased knowledge of its pathophysiology. This understanding has led to the routine use of measures to reduce intragastric acidity (luminal acid being a prerequisite for stress ulcer to occur), coupled with improved techniques for the treatment of shock and the accompanying gastric mucosal hypoperfusion (another prerequisite for the formation of stress ulcers). A number of measures have been used to lower intragastric acidity with H2 receptor blockers emerging as the agents of choice to accomplish this goal. In the unlikely event that bleeding occurs despite these prophylactic measures, aggressive medical management will result in cessation of hemorrhage in over 80% of patients. In those few individuals requiring surgery to control bleeding, no operation has emerged as the recognized procedure of choice. Thus, we believe that a conservative operative approach is indicated in this setting and recommend vagotomy and pyloroplasty with oversewing of the bleeding erosions as appropriate therapy for most patients requiring surgical intervention. 
Autonomic function in Friedreich's ataxia. Autonomic function studies were performed on 15 patients with Friedreich's ataxia, and the results compared with those of 76 healthy subjects. There was an increase in resting supine heart rate, attributed to cardiac abnormalities. Other tests of sympathetic and parasympathetic function were normal. The normal autonomic function studies are consistent with the pathological findings of degeneration predominantly of large diameter myelinated fibres with sparing of small myelinated and unmyelinated fibres. 
Tracheostomal stenosis after immediate tracheoesophageal puncture. The incidence of tracheostomal stenosis in a group of patients after total laryngectomy with or without pharyngectomy plus immediate tracheoesophageal or tracheogastric puncture was compared with that of a control group without puncture. The stenosis rate of the puncture group was significantly higher than that of the control group (19% vs 6%). The other probable etiologic factors for stomal stricture were similar in both groups. Analysis of the risk factors in the puncture group suggested a higher tendency of stenosis in females (43% vs 16%) and in patients receiving postoperative radiotherapy (29% vs 14%), although the difference failed to reach statistical significance. 
Prevention of stroke by antihypertensive drug treatment in older persons with isolated systolic hypertension. Final results of the Systolic Hypertension in the Elderly Program (SHEP). SHEP Cooperative Research Group OBJECTIVE.--To assess the ability of antihypertensive drug treatment to reduce the risk of nonfatal and fatal (total) stroke in isolated systolic hypertension. DESIGN.--Multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled. SETTING.--Community-based ambulatory population in tertiary care centers. PARTICIPANTS.--4736 persons (1.06%) from 447,921 screenees aged 60 years and above were randomized (2365 to active treatment, 2371 to placebo). Systolic blood pressure ranged from 160 to 219 mm Hg and diastolic blood pressure was less than 90 mm Hg. Of the participants, 3161 were not receiving antihypertensive medication at initial contact, and 1575 were. The average systolic blood pressure was 170 mm Hg; average diastolic blood pressure, 77 mm Hg. The mean age was 72 years, 57% were women, and 14% were black. INTERVENTIONS.--Participants were stratified by clinical center and by antihypertensive medication status at initial contact. For step 1 of the trial, dose 1 was chlorthalidone, 12.5 mg/d, or matching placebo; dose 2 was 25 mg/d. For step 2, dose 1 was atenolol, 25 mg/d, or matching placebo; dose 2 was 50 mg/d. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES.--Primary.--Nonfatal and fatal (total) stroke. Secondary.--Cardiovascular and coronary morbidity and mortality, all-cause mortality, and quality of life measures. RESULTS.--Average follow-up was 4.5 years. The 5-year average systolic blood pressure was 155 mm Hg for the placebo group and 143 mm Hg for the active treatment group, and the 5-year average diastolic blood pressure was 72 and 68 mm Hg, respectively. The 5-year incidence of total stroke was 5.2 per 100 participants for active treatment and 8.2 per 100 for placebo. The relative risk by proportional hazards regression analysis was 0.64 (P = .0003). For the secondary end point of clinical nonfatal myocardial infarction plus coronary death, the relative risk was 0.73. Major cardiovascular events were reduced (relative risk, 0.68). For deaths from all causes, the relative risk was 0.87. CONCLUSION.--In persons aged 60 years and over with isolated systolic hypertension, antihypertensive stepped-care drug treatment with low-dose chlorthalidone as step 1 medication reduced the incidence of total stroke by 36%, with 5-year absolute benefit of 30 events per 1000 participants. Major cardiovascular events were reduced, with 5-year absolute benefit of 55 events per 1000. 
A randomized clinical trial of ampicillin, gentamicin and clindamycin versus cefotaxime and clindamycin in children with ruptured appendicitis. This prospective, randomized, double-blind study compares the efficacy, safety and cost-effectiveness of ampicillin, gentamicin and clindamycin (AGC) or cefotaxime and clindamycin (CC) for the treatment of children with complicated appendicitis. Ninety-seven children were randomized. Forty-seven were assigned to the AGC regimen and 50 received CC. Forty-two patients in the AGC group had an appropriate therapeutic outcome, whereas 48 of 50 children who received CC completed the trial successfully (p = NS). There were no differences between the groups with reference to the duration of antibiotic administration, fever, leukocytosis or length of hospitalization. Complications of therapy were uncommon and neither regimen demonstrated a significant advantage from an economic standpoint. We concluded that, in childhood, complicated appendicitis can be treated with either CC or AGC with equal efficacy. 
The clinical diagnosis of splenomegaly. Assessing for the presence of splenomegaly is an important component of the physical examination. Although several methods of palpation and percussion of the spleen have been described, until recently they have not been validated by noninvasive imaging techniques such as ultrasonography, radionuclide scanning, and computed tomography that offer objective means to assess splenomegaly. We review the literature comparing various physical examination techniques with noninvasive imaging modalities and conclude that palpation and percussion of the spleen are complementary but frequently insensitive and that further studies are needed to evaluate the efficacy of specific diagnostic methods. 
The failed ulnar nerve transposition. Etiology and treatment. Various procedures have been recommended for the treatment of cubital tunnel syndrome. Simple decompression in situ, medial epicondylectomy, subcutaneous transposition, intramuscular transposition, and submuscular transposition all have their advocates. The results of the surgical treatment for cubital tunnel syndrome are related to the severity of the compressive neuropathy at the time of diagnosis and to the adequate decompression of the nerve at all sites of potential compression at the time of surgical treatment. Fourteen patients who had previously undergone surgical treatment for cubital tunnel syndrome were evaluated because of persistent pain, paresthesia, numbness, and motor weakness. All patients had documented persistent compression of the ulnar nerve on clinical and electromyographic evaluation. The indication for repeat surgical exploration in all patients was unremitting pain despite nonoperative treatment. All patients had been treated by neurolysis and submuscular transposition of the ulnar nerve as described by Learmonth. The causes of continued pain after initial surgery included retention of the medial intermuscular septum, dense perineural fibrosis of the nerve after intramuscular and subcutaneous transposition, adhesions of the nerve to the medial epicondylectomy site, and recurrent subluxation of the nerve over the medial epicondyle after subcutaneous transposition. Revision surgery was found to be highly successful for relief of pain and paresthesias; however, the recovery of motor function and return of sensibility were variable and unpredictable. 
Role of calcium channel blockers in protection against experimental renal injury. The available evidence indicates that the first generation calcium channel blocker verapamil has a protective effect against both acute and chronic renal failure. At the cell membrane, verapamil helps minimize the effects of excess calcium influx after ischemic injury, evidenced by reduced uptake of 45Ca, thus lessening tubular injury from both calcium-activated phospholipases and mitochondrial calcium overload. In experimental chronic renal failure, the long-term administration of verapamil protects against renal dysfunction and damage, independent of any effect on systemic mean arterial pressure. Protective effects of verapamil are delineated in several models, supporting the presented hypothesis of the pathogenesis of renal failure. 
Clinical significance of small-intestinal microsporidiosis in HIV-1-infected individuals To assess the importance of microsporidiosis of the small intestine in the pathogenesis of chronic diarrhoea in HIV-1-infected individuals, duodenal biopsy samples from the following three patient groups were prospectively evaluated for bacterial, viral, and parasitic pathogens by standard methods, and for microsporidia by light microscopy: 55 consecutive HIV-1-antibody-positive subjects with unexplained diarrhoea of at least 3 weeks duration (group A); 38 HIV-1-seropositive subjects without diarrhoea (group B) who consecutively underwent upper gastrointestinal endoscopy for various reasons; and 7 patients without known risk factors for HIV infection with chronic unexplained diarrhoea (group C). In groups A and B most subjects had had previous AIDS-defining opportunistic infections and the median peripheral blood CD4 lymphocyte count was less than 0.1 x 10(9)/l. Microsporidia were detected as the single pathogen in 15 of the group A compared with 1 (in whom diarrhoea subsequently developed) of the group B patients (p = 0.001) and none of the group C patients. With the exception of 4 of the group A patients, no other intestinal pathogens were identified in any of the patients. The median peripheral blood CD4 count was significantly lower in patients with detectable microsporidia than in those without microsporidiosis (0.03 x 10(9)/l vs 0.06 x 10(9)/l; p = 0.03); in all patients with microsporidiosis, the CD4 count was equal to or less than 0.1 x 10(9)/l. 13 patients with microsporidiosis were treated with metronidazole, in 10 of whom treatment led to a substantial improvement or disappearance of diarrhoea within days of starting therapy, but did not result in eradication of the parasite in the 5 patients who underwent repeat biopsy. The findings suggest that small-intestinal microsporidiosis is an important cause of chronic unexplained diarrhoea in HIV-1-infected individuals with pronounced cellular immune deficiency. This infection should therefore be added to the list of AIDS-defining opportunistic infections. 
Differences in vascular reactivity in models of ischemic acute renal failure. To determine the mechanism of observed differences in vasoreactivity in norepinephrine-induced (NE) and renal artery clamp (RAC) models of ischemic acute renal failure (ARF), induction renal blood flow (RBF) was measured and vascular reactivity examined one week thereafter in NE- and RAC-ARF rat kidneys that had identical levels of renal dysfunction. Morphology also was compared at 48 hours and one week. In NE-ARF, RBF was 14% during 90 minutes of induction and by 60 minutes post-NE infusion was only 18% of baseline. In contrast, in RAC-ARF RBF was effectively 0 for 75 minutes but returned to 95% of baseline by 60 minutes after clamp release. At one week there was a paradoxical increase in renovascular resistance (RVR) to renal perfusion pressure (RPP) reduction in the autoregulatory range and an augmented vasoconstriction to renal nerve stimulation (RNS) in NE-ARF, but no change in RVR and minimal reduction in RBF to these same respective stimuli in RAC-ARF (both different at P less than 0.001). NE-ARF were more sensitive to intrarenal norepinephrine than RAC-ARF kidneys (P less than 0.001). Neither NE- nor RAC-ARF kidneys responded to endothelium-dependent acetylcholine (ACh). Vasodilation to endothelium-independent prostacyclin (PGI2) in NE- was similar to sham-ARF, but there was an attenuated response in RAC-ARF kidneys (P less than 0.001). Morphology at 48 hours showed smooth muscle necrosis in half of the resistance vessels in RAC- but in less than 10% of those in NE-ARF. Except for a slightly greater frequency of tubular casts at 48 hours in RAC-ARF, tubular injury was indistinguishable. It is concluded that NE-ARF has evidence of a predominant functional endothelial vascular injury while RAC-ARF has both morphologic and functional evidence of a predominant smooth muscle injury. Differences in vascular injury between the two models, at least in part, may be the consequence of differences in severity of initial ischemia and/or the rates of recovery of RBF; however, an additional or separate toxic effect of infused NE cannot be excluded. 
S100 protein-positive sustentacular cells in malignant and locally aggressive adrenal pheochromocytomas. The absence or presence of S100-positive sustentacular cells has been previously shown to be correlated with benign and malignant pheochromocytomas and paragangliomas. We evaluated a total of 17 malignant and recurrent or locally aggressive adrenal pheochromocytomas for their quantity of sustentacular cells. An absence of sustentacular cells was demonstrated in the majority of malignant cases, while the locally aggressive or recurrent group usually contained an abundance of these cells. However, in one malignant case a constant moderate number of sustentacular cells in the primary site and in two sequential metastases was found. We conclude that the absence of sustentacular cells in pheochromocytomas may indicate a lesion with a greater potential for metastasis and that sustentacular cells, when they are present in a malignant pheochromocytoma, are an integral part of the tumor. 
Nd-YAG laser hyaloidotomy for malignant glaucoma following one-piece 7 mm intraocular lens implantation. Three cases of malignant glaucoma following extracapsular cataract extraction with 7 mm one-piece posterior chamber intraocular lens implantation are presented. Nd-YAG laser hyaloidotomy was successfully performed in all eyes, but was difficult and required several sessions in two eyes. In the third eye, which had a sector iridectomy, laser hyaloidotomy applied over the edge of the lens optic through the iridectomy resulted in brisk deepening of the anterior chamber and reduction of intraocular pressure. We propose that the one-piece 7 mm optic posterior chamber intraocular lens may constitute an obstacle to successful hyaloidotomy, mainly owing to its large size, as it may block aqueous percolation from the vitreous into the anterior chamber. Eyes prone to develop malignant glaucoma after surgery should have a sector or large peripheral iridectomy to facilitate postoperative Nd-YAG laser hyaloidotomy if required. 
Emergency pulmonary resection for pneumonia. High morbidity and mortality. Emergency pulmonary resection was performed because of complicated pneumonia in eight patients (5 pneumonectomies, 2 lobectomies, 1 bilobectomy) over a 2-year period. The patients' age range was 5 months to 43 years. The indications were rapid aggravation of respiratory insufficiency in children with staphylococcal pneumonia and enlarging pneumatoceles, and massive hemoptysis in patients with chronic destructive pneumonia. Two patients died after pneumonectomy, one from contralateral aspiration and one from cardiogenic shock. Postoperative complications occurred in four cases--bronchopleural fistula and pyopneumothorax in three and thoracic empyema with massive chest-wall infection in one. Only two patients had an uneventful postoperative course. Complications of pulmonary necrosis in pneumonia may dictate urgent pulmonary resection, often pneumonectomy. Surgery will be life-saving in most cases, but high morbidity is to be expected. 
Myocardial rupture. Your patient's survival may depend on you. Myocardial rupture is the second leading cause of in-hospital death from acute myocardial infarction. It is most likely to occur in the elderly, women, and patients with transmural infarction and no previous history of angina. A high index of suspicion is critical to the diagnosis. Myocardial rupture should be suspected when recurrent chest pain or hemodynamic instability develops after myocardial infarction. Rapid intervention and appropriate infarct-limiting therapy may reduce the mortality rate of this catastrophic complication. 
Abdominal wall Actinomyces abscess associated with an intrauterine device. A case report. An abdominal wall Actinomyces abscess occurred in a woman with an intrauterine device. Contributing factors were local trauma, spread from surrounding colonized body sites and symbiotic growth of other anaerobes. The diagnosis was based on the histologic finding of the sulfur granule. Special studies may be needed to distinguish this condition from other, similar ones (Nocardia, botryomycosis). 
Radionuclide assessment of ventricular function and risk stratification after myocardial infarction. Prognosis after acute myocardial infarction is determined primarily by left ventricular function and by the extent to which additional coronary obstructions jeopardize viable myocardium. Radionuclide ventriculography is well suited for noninvasive assessments of resting and exercise ventricular function after acute myocardial infarction. The prognostic importance of resting left ventricular function after acute myocardial infarction is well established. Several studies have reported the prognostic utility of submaximal exercise radionuclide ventriculography at the time of hospital discharge. Patients with globally depressed left ventricular function after acute myocardial infarction are at increased risk for cardiac death, while patients with normal resting ventricular function but abnormal function during exercise appear to be at risk for nonfatal ischemic events. The development of gated tomographic techniques and new radiopharmaceuticals will make available more accurate and detailed assessments of ventricular function and combined assessments of function and perfusion. These new developments require further investigation but appear to be promising new techniques with the potential for providing improved assessments of prognosis after acute myocardial infarction. 
Intracerebral hemorrhage after lumbar myelography with iohexol: report of a case and review of the literature. Intracranial hemorrhage is an uncommon complication of dural puncture. In most instances, hematomas are subdural; they may be unilateral or bilateral. Rarely are intraparenchymal cerebral hemorrhages related to dural puncture. This report describes a delayed occurrence of bilateral intraparenchymal hemorrhages in a 38-year-old woman 7 days after lumbar myelography with iohexol. A review of the literature is presented. 
Is the serum cholesterol-coronary heart disease relationship modified by activity level in older persons? Although coronary heart disease remains a leading cause of death and disability in old age, the relationship of serum cholesterol level to risk of coronary heart disease in old age is controversial. Data for 2,388 white persons aged 65-74 who participated in the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) I Epidemiologic Follow-up Study (NHEFS) were examined to determine the relationship of serum cholesterol level to coronary heart disease incidence and whether activity level would modify this relationship. While there was no overall relationship between serum cholesterol level and coronary heart disease risk in either men or women, the relationship between serum cholesterol level and coronary heart disease differed within activity groups. For persons who were more active, serum cholesterol level was associated with a graded increase in risk of coronary heart disease, from 1.3 (95% CI 0.7, 2.3) in those with serum cholesterol level of 4.7-5.1 to 1.7 in those with serum cholesterol level of 6.2 mmol/L or more (95% CI 1.0, 2.7), when compared with those with serum cholesterol level below 4.7. For the least active persons, all levels of cholesterol were associated with a significant inverse relative risk, including cholesterol of 6.2 mmol/L or more (Relative risk = 0.4 (95% CI 0.2, 0.7]. These data suggest that factors such as activity level may modify the serum cholesterol-coronary heart disease association in old age. The serum cholesterol-coronary heart disease association in more active older persons resembles that seen in younger populations, whereas the association in less active persons is that of serum cholesterol level and risk of cancer or death. The modification of the serum cholesterol-coronary heart disease association by activity level may have implications for appropriate clinical management as well as appropriate design of research studies of this association. 
Elevated brain concentrations of 1,4-benzodiazepines in fulminant hepatic failure BACKGROUND. Increased gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) neurotransmission has been implicated in the pathogenesis of hepatic encephalopathy. The mechanism by which GABA-ergic activity is increased in hepatic failure is unclear, but recent studies in animals with encephalopathy due to fulminant hepatic failure suggest that GABA-ergic neurotransmission may be increased by the presence of elevated concentrations of benzodiazepine agonists such as diazepam and N-desmethyldiazepam. METHODS AND RESULTS. Samples of frontal cortex were obtained at autopsy from 11 patients with hepatic encephalopathy who died of acetaminophen-induced fulminant hepatic failure and 8 patients who died of cardiovascular disease or trauma. None of the 19 patients had received benzodiazepines while hospitalized. Chromatographic analyses of extracts of these samples revealed 4 to 19 peaks representing substances that inhibited the binding of a radiolabeled imidazobenzodiazepine ([3H]flumazenil) to its receptors. Several of these peaks had retention times corresponding to those of known 1,4-benzodiazepines. Ultraviolet- and mass-spectroscopic analysis confirmed that two of these peaks represented diazepam and N-desmethyldiazepam. The patients who died of fulminant hepatic failure could be divided into two groups: six who had had significantly elevated brain concentrations (2-fold to 10-fold higher than normal) of substances inhibiting the binding of [3H]flumazenil and five who had normal concentrations. CONCLUSIONS. Brain concentrations of substances inhibiting the binding of [3H]flumazenil to its receptors are increased in some patients with hepatic encephalopathy due to fulminant hepatic failure. The origin of these substances is unknown, but these findings provide a rational basis for trials of benzodiazepine-receptor antagonists in the management of this disorder. 
Detection of hepatitis B virus DNA in paraffin-embedded liver tissues in chronic hepatitis B or non-A, non-B, hepatitis using the polymerase chain reaction. We developed a polymerase chain reaction assay for the direct detection of hepatitis B virus in paraffin-embedded liver tissue and applied this assay to determine whether hepatitis B virus DNA exists in livers with chronic hepatitis non-A, non-B. Fifty five liver biopsy samples were studied: 11 from patients with HBeAg-positive chronic hepatitis (paraffin-embedded) and 44 from patients with chronic hepatitis non-A, non-B (21 paraffin-embedded; 25 fresh frozen). Thirty three (75%) of the non-A, non-B cases were positive for hepatitis C virus antibodies. Approximately 1 to 10 ng of DNA was extracted from the paraffin-embedded tissue and amplified using oligonucleotide (23-mer) primers specific for the S gene (positions 261 to 692). The beta-globin gene was used as an internal control for sensitivity because this is a single copy gene and allows for relative quantification. In each of the chronic hepatitis B livers, the expected 432-base-pair amplification product for hepatitis B virus DNA and beta-globin gene product were both detected. On the other hand, in the 21 paraffin-embedded chronic hepatitis non-A, non-B livers, no hepatitis B virus DNA was detected, although beta-globin gene was observed in all. Furthermore, in all 25 frozen non-A, non-B livers, beta-globin gene was observed, but no hepatitis B virus band was seen. The limit of detection of hepatitis B virus DNA by this method was estimated to be one genomic copy of hepatitis B virus DNA per cell. 
Ovulation induction by step-down administration of purified urinary follicle-stimulating hormone in patients with polycystic ovarian syndrome. The step-down method can be an alternative method of ovulation induction in women with PCOS. This protocol can induce ovulation with a smaller dose of FSH and with lower incidence of excessive ovarian enlargement in comparison with the traditional fixed-dose administration method. 
Fluoxetine in the treatment of borderline and schizotypal personality disorders. Twenty-two patients meeting the criteria for borderline or schizotypal personality disorder or both participated in a prospective, nonblind 12-week trial of fluoxetine. There were significant reductions in self-injury and in scores on the Hopkins Symptom Checklist regardless of diagnosis. The results suggest that controlled trials of fluoxetine and investigations of the serotonergic system in these disorders would be useful. 
Atypical polypoid dermatofibroma: report of two cases. Two cases of a hitherto undescribed special variant of dermatofibroma are reported. A man and a woman, aged 57 and 52 years, respectively, had slowly growing cutaneous tumors on the lower extremities. The tumors were exophytic and polypoid, 10 and 6 cm in maximal diameters, respectively; they were covered by rough nonulcerated skin and were joined by a short pedicle to an indurated base. Histologic examination showed some features of an otherwise conventional dermatofibroma, whereas the polypoid component was hypercellular and showed striking atypia and scattered mitotic figures. After 32 and 28 months' follow-up, the lesions did not recur after surgical excision. We suggest the term atypical polypoid dermatofibroma to summarize the special clinicopathologic features of these tumors. 
Pelvic fracture from major blunt trauma. Outcome is determined by associated injuries. Pelvic hemorrhage has been implicated as the cause of death in 50% of patients who die following pelvic fractures. To establish correlates of morbidity and mortality from pelvic fractures due to blunt trauma, we reviewed 236 patients treated during 4 years. The average age of the 144 men and 92 women was 31.5 years, the average Injury Severity Score was 21.3, the average blood requirement was 5 units, and the average hospital stay was 16.8 days. One hundred fifty-two patients (64.4%) were injured in motor vehicle accidents, 33 (14%) had motor vehicle-pedestrian accidents, 16 (6.8%) had crush injuries, 12 (5.1%) each had either motorcycle accidents or falls, and 11 (4.6%) had miscellaneous accidents. Eighteen patients (7.6%) died, with seven (38.9%) deaths due to hemorrhage. Only one death was caused by pelvic hemorrhage. Other deaths were due to hemorrhage from other sites (6), head injury (5), sepsis or multiple-organ failure (4), pulmonary injury (1), and pulmonary embolus (1). None of the septic deaths was related to a pelvic hematoma. Multivariate multiple regression analysis showed that the severity of injury was correlated with indices of severity of pelvic fractures such as fracture site (p less than 0.0001), fracture displacement (p less than 0.005), pelvic stability (p less than 0.0001), and vector of injury (p less than 0.01). However death could not be predicted on the basis of these indices of severity (p greater than 0.28). Of the nine patients who underwent pelvic arteriography, three required embolization of actively bleeding pelvic vessels, but seven had intra-abdominal hemorrhage that required laparotomy, and eight developed a coagulopathy. Massive bleeding from pelvic fractures was uncommon, and the major threat of hemorrhage was from nonpelvic sites. Furthermore, although injury severity was correlated with the severity of the pelvic fracture, hospital outcome was determined by associated injuries and not by the pelvic fracture. 
Risk assessment and control of waterborne giardiasis. BACKGROUND: Waterborne giardiasis has been increasing in the United States with 95 outbreaks reported over the last 25 years. The Safe Drinking Water Act has mandated control of this pathogen. METHODS: A risk assessment model was developed to estimate risk of infection after exposure to treated waters containing varying levels of Giardia cysts. The model was defined by a dose-response curve developed from human feeding studies for Giardia and assumed 2L of water consumption per day. Data on concentrations and distribution of the organism in source waters were used to assess exposure after varying reductions achieved through treatment. RESULTS: In surveys reporting prevalence and levels of Giardia cyst contamination, average levels of cysts in surface waters ranged from 0.33 to 104/100L; from pristine watersheds (protected from all human activity) 0.6 to 5/100L. Yearly risks were 4.8 x 10(-3) for systems using polluted waters and 1.3 x 10(-4) for pristine waters with a 10(-3) treatment reduction. CONCLUSION: Public Health officials will need to work with the water industry to ensure a risk of less than 1/10,000 for source waters with 0.7 to 70 cysts per 100 liters through treatment achieving reduction of 10(-3) to 10(-5), respectively, of Giardia cysts. 
Subarachnoid hemorrhage from multiple neurofibromas of the cauda equina: case report. The authors report a case of spinal subarachnoid hemorrhage caused by neurofibromas of the cauda equina. An examination of the literature revealing 13 similar cases and an analysis of this case showing three neurofibromas of the cauda equina prompted an hypothesis emphasizing the origin of bleeding and the difficulties associated with a correct diagnosis. 
Deletion of mitochondrial DNA in patients with combined features of Kearns-Sayre and MELAS syndromes. A 9-year-old girl and an 11-year-old boy had ptosis, progressive external ophthalmoplegia, pigmentary retinopathy, and sensorineural hearing loss. The girl had diabetes mellitus and the boy had hypoparathyroidism. Both children also developed recurrent vomiting and cerebral infarcts with lactic acidosis. Muscle biopsy specimens showed ragged-red fibers and Southern analysis demonstrated a distinct heteroplasmic deletion of muscle mitochondrial DNA in each patient but no evidence of the point mutation in the transfer RNALeu(UUR) gene recently identified in mitochondrial encephalomyopathy, lactic acidosis, and stroke-like episodes (MELAS). These 2 children had combined features of Kearns-Sayre syndrome and MELAS, suggesting that mitochondrial DNA deletions occasionally can have pleomorphic clinical expression. 
Prevalence, onset, and risk of psychiatric disorders in men with chronic low back pain: a controlled study. This study used structured diagnostic interviews and DSM-III criteria to assess lifetime prevalence and pre-morbid risk of psychiatric disorder in a sample of men with long-standing chronic back pain (CLPB) attending a primary care clinic. A control group of age and demographically matched men without history of back pain was also studied. Compared to controls, men with CLBP had significantly higher lifetime rates of major depression (32% vs. 16%), alcohol use disorder (64.9% vs. 38.8%), and a major anxiety disorder (30.9% vs. 14.3%). Almost all CLBP men ever experiencing a mood disorder reported recurrent, not single, episodes. The 6 month point prevalence of major depression, but not other disorders, was also significantly elevated for men with CLBP. In CLBP, the first episode of major depression generally (58.1%) followed pain onset. While the initial major depressive episode usually commenced within the first 2 years of established pain, late onset mood disorder was also common. By comparison in most cases (81%) onset of alcohol use disorders considerably preceded pain. When an age-matching procedure was used to gauge relative vulnerability to psychiatric illness in patients and controls, CLBP patients had significantly higher pre-pain rates of alcohol use disorder but not depression. After age of pain onset, CLBP subjects had over 9 times the risk of developing major depression, but had similar rates of developing alcoholism. We conclude that (1) alcohol use disorders rather than depression may increase risk of developing CLBP, and (2) risk of new onset and recurrent major depression remains high for men throughout their pain career. This suggests that psychological adaptation to long-standing pain may be less successful than previously thought, especially with regard to recurrent mood disorder. 
A 'unified theory' of prion propagation. There is now very persuasive evidence that the transmissible agent for spongiform encephalopathies such as scrapie, consists of a modified form of the normal host protein PrPc, devoid of any nucleic acid. On the other hand, because there are many different strains of scrapie agent with distinct phenotypes which can be propagated in animals homozygous for the PrPc gene, it has been suggested that a nucleic acid must be a component of the agent. Can the two views be reconciled?. 
Analysis of the enhancer element that controls expression of sevenless in the developing Drosophila eye. The sevenless gene encodes a protein-tyrosine kinase receptor expressed in a complex pattern during the development of the Drosophila melanogaster eye. We have previously shown that this pattern is regulated transcriptionally by an enhancer located in the body of the sevenless gene. Here we extend our analysis of the sevenless enhancer, defining a 475-base-pair fragment that contains elements necessary for the correct qualitative and quantitative expression of the sevenless gene. Within this fragment are sequence elements conserved in the sevenless gene of a distantly related Drosophila species and protected from DNase I digestion by nuclear extracts isolated from adult heads and imaginal discs. Partial deletions of the 475-base-pair fragment result in preferential loss of expression in different subsets of cells. These results suggest that the normal pattern of expression is generated by the combined action of separate cell-specific regulatory elements. 
Helicobacter pylori gastritis mimicking gastric carcinoma at CT evaluation. The abdominal computed tomographic (CT) scans from 61 patients with biopsy-proved Helicobacter (formerly Campylobacter) pylori gastritis were retrospectively reviewed. The CT scans were interpreted on the basis of the original report of the findings at CT examination and without knowledge of the results of biopsy. Of 19 patients (31%) with gastric abnormalities at CT, 14 (74%) had inflammatory changes initially reported as suspicious for gastric malignancy; malignancy was entertained as the primary diagnosis in four of those patients. In five of the 19 abnormal cases (26%), the diagnosis with CT was gastritis. The two major patterns of severe H pylori infection identified were (a) circumferential antral wall thickening and (b) thickening of the posterior gastric wall along the greater curvature, with or without evidence of ulceration. Thickening averaged 1.5-2.0 cm in cases suspicious for malignancy. The majority of abnormalities involved the gastric antrum (68%). No cases demonstrated significant adenopathy, obliteration of fat planes, or invasion of adjacent organs. 
Non-ominous micrometastases of gastric cancer. So-called R2 or wider meticulous node dissection was performed in 1368 patients with resected gastric cancer invading beyond the submucosa but without distant metastases. Survival rates were similar in subsets of patients with or without microscopic node metastases and macroscopically normal lymph nodes. The extent of node metastases has previously been shown to be one of the two most important prognostic factors in gastric cancer without distant metastases, and its lack of impact in these patient groups was not explained by the imbalance of other prognostic factors. The findings indicate that micrometastases of gastric cancer are curable by a wide node dissection made in the absence of palpable abnormality. They also offer the possibility that an extensive node dissection may yield good stage-specific survival rates, in part because of upstaging of patients. The findings should influence the recording of node metastases for evaluation of stage-specific treatment results and for research purposes. 
Excess mortality associated with diuretic therapy in diabetes mellitus OBJECTIVE. To determine whether the high mortality among diabetic patients receiving treatment for hypertension can be explained by associated risk factors or must be attributed to a deleterious effect of antihypertensive treatment. DESIGN. Cohort analytic study with a median follow-up of 4.5 years. SETTING. Outpatients with diabetes and severe retinopathy who were enrolled in a multicenter, randomized clinical trial of laser treatment to prevent blindness had ophthalmologic examinations every 4 months and annual medical examinations that included measurement of blood pressure and recording of anti-hypertensive treatment. Only 5.5% of the patients were unavailable for follow-up. When a patient died, the circumstances surrounding the death were reviewed and classified by a mortality review committee. PARTICIPANTS.--There were 759 participants in the study; they were white, were aged 35 to 69 years, and had normal serum creatinine levels at the baseline examination. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS.--Patients were classified into five groups according to information recorded at the baseline and first annual follow-up examinations: normotensive (diastolic blood pressure less than 90 mm Hg), untreated hypertensive, hypertensive treated by diuretics alone, hypertensive treated by other agents alone, and hypertensive treated by both agents. Cardiovascular mortality was higher in patients treated for hypertension than in patients with untreated hypertension. The excess was primarily found in patients treated with diuretics alone, although that group had the lowest blood pressure with treatment. After adjusting for differences in risk factors, cardiovascular mortality was 3.8 times higher in patients treated with diuretics alone than in patients with untreated hypertension (P less than .001). CONCLUSIONS.--In individuals with diabetes, intervention with diuretics to reduce hypertension is associated with excess mortality. Until there is a clinical trial showing a beneficial effect of diuretic treatment in diabetic patients, there is urgent need to reconsider its continued usage in this population. 
Radiation and pagetic osteogenic sarcomas. Radiation and pagetic osteogenic sarcomas should be distinguished from classical osteogenic sarcoma. Both occur in older patients with significantly greater comorbidity. Roentgenographically, radiation osteogenic sarcoma is typically sclerotic, whereas pagetic osteogenic sarcoma is lytic and associated with pathologic fracture. Radical resections give the best result, local control, and survival. Chemotherapy has not proven effective to date. Improvements in tumor imaging and more intensive chemotherapy regimens may permit limb-sparing surgery. Overall results remain poor, with approximately 15% five-year survival in each condition. 
Phase II trial of pentostatin in refractory lymphomas and cutaneous T-cell disease. Thirty-seven patients with refractory lymphoma or cutaneous T-cell lymphoma were treated with 2'-deoxycoformycin (pentostatin; dCF), 5 mg/m2 intravenous (IV) bolus for 3 consecutive days of every 3-week cycle in this Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) trial. Included were 25 with the diagnosis of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, three with Hodgkin's disease, eight with cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (CTCL), and one with unknown subtype, of whom 31 were considered eligible. The majority had failed at least two, but no more, conventional chemotherapy regimens. Ten (32%) of the eligible patients had a partial response (PR), including patients with nodular poorly differentiated lymphocytic (NPDL), nodular mixed (NM), diffuse poorly differentiated lymphocytic (DPDL), or diffuse histiocytic (DH), lymphoma mixed-cellularity (MC), Hodgkin's disease, and unknown subtype, and in four patients with CTCL. The overall median time to treatment failure (TTF) was only 1.3 months, but the range extended to 57.3 months. The overall response duration was 16.0 months, and the range extended to 53.4 months. Overall median survival was 2.7 months, with the range extending to 63.2 months. The majority of patients had no toxicity, but there were some instances of severe or life-threatening events. Four fatal toxicities occurred, in two patients with underlying pulmonary conditions and two with prior cardiac histories. From this study, we conclude that dCF is active in refractory lymphomas and CTCLs, should be avoided in patients with a history of serious pulmonary or cardiac diseases, and warrants consideration for incorporation of a low-dosage schedule into conventional combination chemotherapy regimens, including its use with biologic response modifiers. 
Causes of blindness and visual handicap in the Central African Republic. The causes of bilateral blindness (best visual acuity less than 3/60) in 1371 people in the Central African Republic seen between 1985 and 1989 who attended eye clinics in 10 out of the 16 prefectures across the country are given. The main causes of bilateral blindness were cataract (51%), glaucoma (12.7%), and onchocerciasis (8.1%). In 710 patients with unilateral blindness the main causes were cataract (38%), glaucoma (10%), iritis (7.5%), and trauma (6.3%). Bilateral blindness in children was rarely seen. The causes of visual impairment (vision between 6/18 and 3/60) in 424 patients were cataract, including aphakia (38%), maculopathy (14%), and onchocerciasis (7%). 
Mechanisms of gastroduodenal protection by sucralfate. Over the past 5-10 years, a number of studies have shown that topical sucralfate enhances a number of gastric and duodenal mechanisms, e.g., the "mucus-bicarbonate barrier," mucosal hydrophobicity, mucosal blood flow, cell viability, and local production of prostaglandins, as well as endogenous mediators of tissue injury and repair. It seems likely that the complex actions of sucralfate are in part related to direct interaction between the drug or its components (aluminum, sucrose, and sulfate) and gastric mucosal tissues, and in part related to effects of the drug on the various mucosal mediators of tissue injury and repair. Local actions may play a role in accelerating healing of ulcer-damaged mucosa, but this does not explain the protective actions of sucralfate on normal mucosa. Thus sucralfate appears to enhance the protective function of the "mucus-bicarbonate" barrier by actions on both components. This may depend in part on an interaction with the unstirred layer overlying gastric epithelium. Sucralfate has also been shown to increase the hydrophobicity of mucus gel. There is little doubt that sucralfate increases local production and release of protective prostaglandins (PGs), but the precise role played by these agents in mediating mucosal protection and in chronic ulcer healing remains uncertain. Currently, the mechanism of action of sucralfate on vascular integrity remains unknown and the role of PGs in this protective function is unclear. There is little evidence that epidermal growth factor plays any role in mediating mucosal protection by sucralfate, but it may be important in its ulcer-healing action. Sucralfate has been shown to be truly "cytoprotective" in that it protects isolated epithelial cells from damage by noxious agents. In animals treated with sucralfate, the surface epithelial cells were disrupted, but necrotic lesions in the deep proliferative zone were virtually absent. It seems likely that investigations of the actions of sucralfate and its components will move ever closer to defining the target cells, the intracellular events, and the mediators that bring about its protective and ulcer-healing activity. 
Histological grading and bromodeoxyuridine labeling index of astrocytomas. Comparative study in a series of 60 cases. The histological grade and the bromodeoxyuridine (BUdR) labeling index of 60 astrocytomas of "ordinary" cell types (fibrillary, protoplasmic, gemistocytic, and anaplastic astrocytomas and glioblastomas) were compared to determine whether the grading system reflects the proliferative potential of the tumors. The tumor grade was based on the presence or absence of four criteria (nuclear abnormalities, mitosis, necrosis, and vascular endothelial proliferation): Grade 1, no criterion, Grade 2, one criterion, Grade 3, two criteria; and Grade 4, three or four criteria. The BUdR labeling index, or percentage of S-phase cells, was calculated in paraffin-embedded tumor sections after in situ labeling by intraoperative intravenous infusion of BUdR, 200 mg/sq m. Exponential regression analyses showed a positive correlation between the histological grade and labeling index (r = 0.88, p less than 0.001) that was stronger than the correlations between log labeling index and age (r = 0.55, p less than 0.001) and between grade and age (r = 0.55, p less than 0.001). These results indicate that the histological grading system reflects the proliferative potential of "ordinary" astrocytomas. 
Acid perfusion test and 24-hour esophageal pH monitoring with symptom index. Comparison of tests for esophageal acid sensitivity. The acid perfusion (Bernstein) test and esophageal pH monitoring are the two most popular tests for identifying esophageal acid sensitivity in difficult cases of reflux disease. Therefore, we prospectively compared these test results in 75 consecutive noncardiac chest pain patients who had both an acid perfusion test and chest pain during 24-hr pH testing. A positive acid perfusion test was defined by the replication of the patient's typical chest pain twice by the acid infusion. Esophageal pH testing identified abnormal amounts of acid reflux and correlated symptoms with acid reflux--the "symptom index." Fifteen patients (20%) had a positive acid perfusion test while 45 patients (59%) had a positive symptom index (range 6-100%). Only 9/34 (26%) patients with abnormal reflux had a positive acid perfusion test. Although it had excellent specificity (83-94%), the acid perfusion test had poor sensitivity (32-46%) when compared to the symptom index regardless of the percent positive cutoff level. The best positive predictive value for the acid perfusion test was 87%, but this occurred when the test sensitivity was 32%. Modifying the end point of a positive acid perfusion test to include heartburn improves the sensitivity (52-67%) while markedly compromising specificity and positive predictive value. Thus, esophageal pH monitoring correlating symptoms with acid reflux is superior to the acid perfusion test for identifying an acid sensitive esophagus in patients with noncardiac chest pain. 
Acute infectious erythemas in children: a clinico-microbiological study. One-hundred children with an acute illness comprising fever and widespread erythematous rash were prospectively studied to determine whether clinical presentations are helpful in defining the causative agent and to identify the most appropriate microbiological specimens. An infectious agent was identified in 65 children; 72% were viruses, 20% were bacteria, 5% were Mycoplasma pneumoniae and in 3% both viruses and bacteria were detected. The most common infectious agents were picornaviruses, an atypical presentation of measles and Group A beta-haemolytic Streptococcus. Different patterns of rash occurred with each of these infections. The clinical presentation of a child with an acute febrile illness and rash was unhelpful in defining the causative agent. Routine management should include a throat swab for bacterial investigation and in selected cases a blood sample for IgM viral titres. 
Serum cholesterol concentration and coronary heart disease in population with low cholesterol concentrations. OBJECTIVE--To examine the relation between serum cholesterol concentration and mortality (from coronary heart disease and from other causes) below the range of cholesterol values generally seen in Western populations. DESIGN--Prospective observational study based on 8-13 years of follow up of subjects in a population with low cholesterol concentrations. SETTING--Urban Shanghai, China. SUBJECTS--9021 Chinese men and women aged 35-64 at baseline. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE--Death from coronary heart disease and other causes. RESULTS--The average serum cholesterol concentration was 4.2 mmol/l at baseline examination, and only 43 (7%) of the deaths that occurred during 8-13 years of follow up were attributed to coronary heart disease. There was a strongly positive, and apparently independent, relation between serum cholesterol concentration and death from coronary heart disease (z = 3.47, p less than 0.001), and within the range of usual serum cholesterol concentration studied (3.8-4.7 mmol/l) there was no evidence of any threshold. After appropriate adjustment for the regression dilution bias, a 4 (SD 1)% difference in usual cholesterol concentration was associated with a 21 (SD 6)% (95% confidence interval 9% to 35%) difference in mortality from coronary heart disease. There was no significant relation between serum cholesterol concentration and death from stroke or all types of cancer. The 79 deaths due to liver cancer or other chronic liver disease were inversely related to cholesterol concentration at baseline. CONCLUSION--Blood cholesterol concentration was directly related to mortality from coronary heart disease even in those with what was, by Western standards, a "low" cholesterol concentration. There was no good evidence of an adverse effect of cholesterol on other causes of death. 
The value of tests predicting renovascular hypertension in patients with renal artery stenosis treated by angioplasty. The aim of this study was to evaluate tests predicting renovascular hypertension. This was done by relating the results of renal vein renin tests, the captopril test, and renal scintigraphic tests to the blood pressure outcome 12 months after relief of renal artery stenosis by percutaneous transluminal renal angioplasty in 31 patients. Cure was seen in eight (26%). Improved blood pressure was obtained in 12 patients (39%), and in 11 patients (35%), the result for blood pressure was a failure. The accuracies of the two mathematical models used to analyze the renal vein renin assays were 44% and 60%. The captopril test showed a sensitivity of 36% and an accuracy of 43%. Renal captopril technetium Tc 99m-labeled pentetic acid scintigraphy gave a sensitivity of 60%. Stepwise logistic regression analysis of clinical variables in relation to blood pressure response revealed age as the only factor significantly related to blood pressure outcome. We conclude that the tests used are unfit for helping select patients for percutaneous transluminal renal angioplasty and that age may have an important influence on outcome. 
Surgical approaches to congenital atresia of the external auditory canal. During the past 4 years, 22 patients with congenital atresia of the external auditory canal underwent 24 initial operations by either an anterior or transmastoid approach. No attempt at randomization was made, but the two groups were similar in number and pathology (in 14 cases approach was anterior and in 10 cases approach was transmastoid). Followup ranged from 6 months to 4 years. Hearing results were similar in the two groups (71% with air-bone gap less than 30 dB). There were no instances of facial nerve injury or sensorineural hearing loss. Facial nerve monitoring was used. Complications of stenosis and drainage were more common with the transmastoid approach. In both groups, hearing results were accomplished with the patients' intact ossicles or prosthetic reconstructions. Meticulous soft-tissue technique, with split-thickness grafts covering all exposed bone, is the key to preventing stenosis. For the three cases of patients with thick, acellular atresia plates, a different approach was developed. Maintaining proper orientation during the medial dissection is more difficult in these cases. By opening the antrum primarily and identifying the lateral canal, ossicles, and facial nerve, an ear canal can then be created anteriorly with these landmarks in view. An intact canal wall-like procedure is carried out. Although hearing results are similar, the anterior approach, because of fewer postoperative complications, is now our procedure of choice. Proper orientation and soft-tissue technique are the keys to successful correction of the congenitally atretic ear canal. 
Hypoxic exposure and activation of the afterdischarge mechanism in conscious humans. After voluntary hyperventilation, normal humans do not develop a significant ventilatory depression despite low arterial CO2 tension, a phenomenon attributed to activation of a brain stem mechanism referred to as the "afterdischarge." Afterdischarge is one of the factors that promote ventilatory stability. It is not known whether physiological stimuli, such as hypoxia, are able to activate the afterdischarge in humans. To test this, breath-by-breath ventilation (VI) was measured in nine young adults during and immediately after a brief period (35-51 s) of acute hypoxia (end-tidal O2 tension 55 Torr). Hypoxia was terminated by switching to 100% O2 (end-tidal O2 tension of first posthypoxic breath greater than 100 Torr). Brief hypoxia increased VI and decreased end-tidal CO2 tension. In all subjects, termination of hypoxia was followed by a gradual ventilatory decay; hyperoxic VI remained higher than the normoxic baseline for several breaths and, despite the negative chemical stimulus of hyperoxia and hypocapnia, reached a new steady state without an apparent undershoot. We conclude that brief hypoxia is able to activate the afterdischarge mechanism in conscious humans. This contrasts sharply with the ventilatory undershoot that follows relief of sustained hypoxia, thereby suggesting that sustained hypoxia inactivates the afterdischarge mechanism. The present findings are of relevance to the pathogenesis of periodic breathing in a hypoxic environment. Furthermore, brief exposure to hypoxia might be useful for evaluation of the role of afterdischarge in other disorders associated with unstable breathing. 
Celiac axis and superior mesenteric artery injury associated with left radical nephrectomy for locally advanced renal cell carcinoma. The superior mesenteric artery and celiac axis were inadvertently ligated during left radical nephrectomy for a large upper pole renal carcinoma with massive perihilar and periaortic adenopathy. Computer-generated 3-dimensional illustrations created from the computerized tomography scan demonstrated the close proximity between these visceral branches and the adenopathy mass complex, and showed how this bulky disease may interfere with surgical anatomy. When left radical nephrectomy is performed for locally advanced and/or bulky node-positive renal neoplasms, surgeons must be cognizant of the location of the major visceral arterial branches and possible anatomical distortions. 
Effects of a minimally supervised exercise program for mentally retarded adults. Previous exercise studies that attempted to improve the cardiovascular fitness (CVF) of mentally retarded (MR) adults were flawed with methodological shortcomings that prevented conclusive results. At issue in these training studies were fitness test validity and reliability, exactness of duration and intensity of training, and an inordinate amount of supervision. Therefore, we sought to determine whether moderately MR adults (seven males, five females; IQ = 61 +/- 3, age = 25 +/- 3 yr) could improve their CVF through a minimally supervised 16-wk training program. Each subject repeated exercise tests twice on two different modes of exercise, the treadmill (TM) and Schwinn Air-Dyne ergometer (SAE), before training to ensure validity and reliability of initial CVF levels. Intensity and frequency of exercise were closely monitored. An observer was present during the training bouts, but, following initial instructions, no additional encouragement or instructions were given. Although the training program significantly increased peak VO2 (29.2 +/- 8 to 33.5 +/- 9 ml.kg-1.min-1) and peak ventilation (73 +/- 26 to 81 +/- 231.min-1) when assessed on the TM, significant changes in these same parameters were not seen when assessed on the SAE. The importance of these results was discussed. 
Cardiac surgery in the octogenarian: perioperative outcome and clinical follow-up The perioperative and follow-up results of cardiac operations employing extracorporeal circulation and cold cardioplegic arrest were examined in 191 consecutive patients greater than or equal to 80 years of age having surgery over a 5 year period (1982 to 1986). Most patients had severe preoperative symptoms with functional class III (39.8%) or IV (57.1%) limitation. The overall 30 day postoperative cardiac mortality rate was 15.7%. The total in-hospital mortality rate was 18.8%; the mean postoperative hospital stay was 16.4 +/- 13.3 days. The perioperative mortality rate for elective operations was as follows: coronary artery bypass (5.6%), aortic valve replacement (9.6%), aortic valve replacement with coronary bypass (17.9%) and mitral valve surgery with or without coronary bypass (21.4%). Urgent operations were performed in 39 patients (20.4%) with a total perioperative mortality rate of 35.9%; urgent coronary artery bypass was performed in 26 patients (67%) with an in-hospital mortality rate of 23.1%. Clinical evidence of left ventricular failure, functional class IV symptoms, left ventricular ejection fraction less than 50%, mitral valve repair or replacement for severe mitral regurgitation and urgent operation were associated with an increased perioperative mortality rate. Follow-up study in all 155 patients surviving postoperative hospitalization at 22.6 +/- 14.8 months showed significant improvement in symptom status in all surgical subgroups. There were 18 follow-up deaths (11.6%); 10 were noncardiac. The actuarial survival rate of the entire study group was significantly better than that in age- and gender-matched control subjects (p = 0.037). 
Interethnic differences in pain perception. While several investigators have reported relationships between ethnic background and expression of pain, such relationships are in fact highly problematical. Few studies of pain and ethnicity have used quantitative measures of pain combined with multivariate methods of data analysis. Most have focussed on populations which, unlike many in the United States today, are characterized by highly distinct ethnic groups. The study reported here interviewed 536 persons recently treated for forms of cancer known to cause significant pain. Pain was assessed using standard, well validated instruments, including Graphic Rating Scales anchored in several alternative time-frames and the McGill Pain Questionnaire. The study took place in an area with a low proportion of recent immigrants and only small concentrations of distinct ethnic minorities. No statistically significant relationships were observed between ethnic identity and measures of pain sensation. However, pain described in affective terms according to the McGill Pain Questionnaire did vary among ethnicities. This observation suggests that cultures associated with specific ethnic identities still condition individual expression of pain despite the high degree of assimilation that has occurred among ethnic groups in the United States. 
The role of platelet activating factor and its antagonists in shock, sepsis and multiple organ failure. PAF has been implicated as a mediator of shock, sepsis and MOF. The results of experimental data demonstrate that PAF induces changes characteristic of endotoxemia and sepsis, including systemic hypotension and diffuse microvascular leakage. These effects are prevented by PAF antagonists. PAF induces many of the characteristic changes of MOF, including functional impairment in the lung, kidney, gastrointestinal tract and heart. PAF antagonists will inhibit these adverse effects. PAF antagonists are now being manufactured by a number of pharmaceutical companies studying the beneficial effects of PAF antagonists in human disease. Data from these studies promise valuable information with significant clinical relevance to the practicing surgeon. 
A comparison of tocopherol and tocotrienol for the chemoprevention of chemically induced rat mammary tumors. Two forms of vitamin E, tocopherol and tocotrienol, were tested for chemopreventive activity in two chemically induced rat mammary-tumor models. When mammary tumors were induced by 7,12-dimethylbenz(a)anthracene (DMBA, 50 mg/kg), only the tocotrienol group had a statistically significant increase in tumor latency. There was no effect of either compound on tumor multiplicity. When tumors were induced by N-nitrosomethylurea (NMU, 30 mg/kg), neither analogue of vitamin E modified latency, whereas tocotrienol increased tumor multiplicity. In summary, neither vitamin analog had a major impact on mammary-tumor development after tumor induction with either DMBA or NMU. 
Increased negative inotropic effect of calcium-channel blockers in hypertrophied and failing rabbit heart. The effects on ventricular function of calcium channel blockers and isoproterenol were studied in isovolumically beating perfused control rabbit hearts and in hearts subjected to a double pressure plus volume overload studied at the early phase of heart failure. In control hearts, isoproterenol produced an increase of systolic ventricular function and relaxation that was maximal at 10(-7) M. In failing hearts, inotropic state increase in response to isoproterenol was significantly smaller (P less than .01) with no observed lusitropic effect. In control hearts, verapamil and diltiazem produced dose-dependent decreases of ventricular function which were larger with verapamil than with diltiazem (median drug concentration50 of developed pressure was, respectively, 1163 +/- 131 nM and 4524 +/- 451 nM, P less than .001). In failing hearts, contractility decrease was larger than in control hearts (median drug concentration50 of developed pressure was 604 +/- 69 nM and 2691 +/- 580 nM with verapamil and diltiazem, respectively). In contrast, Ro 40-5967, a new calcium-channel blocker, did not produce reductions of inotropic state with concentrations up to 10(-5) M. All three calcium-channel blockers produced a 2-fold increase of coronary flow at 10(-6) M. We conclude that the deleterious effect of verapamil and diltiazem in heart failure is due, at least in part, to a direct depressant effect of these drugs on contractility, which is larger than in control hearts. Additionally, the in vivo sympathetic compensation is probably reduced, as indicated by the decreased ventricular responsiveness to isoproterenol. 
Heart transplantation in children: an international survey. A survey of cardiac transplantation in children provided data from 381 transplantations in 362 patients from 32 centers in the United States and ten international centers. The number of transplantations continues to increase, in part because of transplantations in infants with hypoplastic left heart syndrome and patients with congenital defects. The immunosuppression regimens were more uniform than in the 1985 survey, and triple therapy was most common. Actuarial survival rates were 85% at 1 month, 72% at 1 year, 64% at 3 years, and 60% at 5 years. However, these improved rates are still not equal to the survival of the overall cardiac transplant population, in part because of lower survival rates in neonates. Ventricular dysfunction and rejection, rather than infection, were the leading causes of death. Rejection and infection were the most frequent complications. Also common were hypertension (39%) and seizures (25%), whereas coronary artery disease (8%) was unusual. Functional results were excellent in 85%, and only 7% were disabled. Questions concerning growth rates and many other aspects cannot yet be answered. However, it is apparent that cardiac transplantation in the pediatric population is a very worthwhile endeavor. 
Practical phlebology. Sclerotherapy of large veins. A practical, step-by-step guide for the sclerotherapy of large varicose veins is offered. First, an orientation regarding the place of sclerotherapy and surgery in the total treatment of varicose veins is given, with a practical clinical classification of varicose veins. This is followed by a detailed discussion of patient education before sclerotherapy, material to be used with recommended concentrations, injection technique, compression after sclerotherapy, instructions to the patient after injection, and procedures at subsequent visits. 
Nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy study of human brain after cardiac resuscitation. We used 31P nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy to study the cerebral metabolic function of eight patients with severe postischemic anoxic encephalopathy secondary to cardiac arrest. Spectroscopy was performed at 18 +/- 13 and 64 +/- 20 hours after resuscitation. Glasgow Coma Scale scores at the time of initial and repeat spectroscopy were 3.6 +/- 1.2 and 3.5 +/- 1.2, respectively. In those patients whose spectra were of adequate quality to monitor pH, all demonstrated tissue alkalosis in at least one brain region. The mean brain pH at initial spectroscopy was 7.14 +/- 0.09 and was significantly alkalotic when compared with age- and sex-matched normal controls (pH = 6.98 +/- 0.04, p less than 0.0001). Five of the eight patients showed at least one region of persistent alkalosis at repeat spectroscopy, whereas one patient demonstrated severe acidosis with a pH of 6.42. Spectra demonstrated marked metabolic heterogeneity, ranging from normal in appearance to complete obliteration of all high-energy phosphates with only inorganic phosphate remaining. 
Supraciliary hemangiopericytoma. A 10-year-old black girl complaining of pain and decreased vision in the left eye was found to have a smoothly elevated ciliochoroidal mass involving the superonasal quadrant of the left eye. The mass appeared circumscribed and uniformly dense by computed tomography. The tumor was hyperintense to vitreous and cerebral white matter on T1-weighted magnetic resonance imaging but was hypointense to vitreous and hyperintense to white matter on T2-weighted magnetic resonance imaging. Results of gross examination of the enucleated eye showed a sharply circumscribed, tan, intraocular mass arising equatorially. Results of histopathologic examination showed a well-vascularized spindle cell proliferation with a sinusoidal pattern characteristic of hemangiopericytoma. This is the third reported case of intraocular hemangiopericytoma and the first in a pediatric patient. 
Problems in the definition and treatment of early gastric cancer. Radical operation with extensive dissection of lymph nodes (R1, 48 patients; R2, 196 patients; R3, one patient) was performed in 245 out of 247 patients with early gastric cancer. The 5-year survival rate was only 73.2 per cent in the 34 patients with lymph node metastases (31.8 per cent). Analysis of factors influencing recurrence revealed that not only lymph node metastases but also the depth of cancer invasion could affect prognosis in early gastric cancer. This study suggests that radical operation with complete dissection of the first and second group of lymph nodes (R2 resection) is a safe and appropriate treatment even for early gastric cancer. We propose that the definition of early gastric cancer be modified to 'carcinoma with invasion confined to the mucosa or submucosa and without evidence of lymph node metastases'. 
Resection of residual mediastinal germ cell masses with the Cavitron ultrasonic surgical aspirator. Residual mediastinal masses after chemotherapy for germ cell tumors should be resected. Complete excision of bulky residual masses may sometimes be difficult because of problems with exposure in the region of the great vessels and important nerves. Two cases are presented in which the Cavitron ultrasonic surgical aspirator (Valleylab Inc., Surgical Systems Division, Stamford, Conn.) facilitated excision of large masses after intensive chemotherapy. We found that the collapsed pseudocapsule remaining after aspiration of tumor mass allowed early improved exposure and safer dissection from neighboring vessels and neural structures. Complete excisions were accomplished and no viable tumor was found, so that the patients were spared the immediate need for further therapy. Both had uneventful recoveries. 
Risk factors for stroke as predictors of platelet membrane fluidity in Alzheimer's disease. We have previously reported that increased platelet membrane fluidity identifies a subgroup of patients with Alzheimer's disease who have distinct clinical features including an earlier age of symptomatic onset, a more rapidly progressive cognitive decline, and a decreased prevalence of focal electroencephalographic findings. In the current study, these patients also exhibited a decreased prevalence of risk factors for stroke compared with patients who had normal platelet membrane fluidity. Our findings suggest that the platelet membrane abnormality describes a clinical subgroup of patients with Alzheimer's disease who are less likely to have coexisting cerebrovascular disease than the remaining patients who meet clinical consensus criteria for probable Alzheimer's disease. 
Results of total knee arthroplasty using the posterior stabilized condylar prosthesis. A report of 137 consecutive cases. One hundred thirty-seven consecutive posterior stabilized total knee arthroplasties (TKAs) were reviewed. Average age of the patient was 61.1 years and length of postoperative follow-up period was 29.2 months. Patients were evaluated using the Hospital for Special Surgery (HSS) knee rating scores. Average preoperative scores improved from 52 to 92, postoperatively. Ninety-eight percent of patients had no pain or mild occasional pain postoperatively compared with 99% of patients experiencing severe to disabling pain preoperatively. Complications included one myocardial infarction, two deep venous thrombosis, one urinary tract infection, one patellar dislocation, and four wound problems. There were two incidences of seroma, one hematoma, and one deep infection requiring revision after joint debridement and systemic antibiotics. Also noted was one incidence of ligamentous laxity and one patella fracture. 
Precordial ST segment depression predicts a worse prognosis in inferior infarction despite reperfusion therapy. The Thrombolysis and Angioplasty in Myocardial Infarction (TAMI) Study Group. The impact of associated precordial ST segment depression in inferior myocardial infarction on angiographic and clinical outcomes after thrombolytic therapy and selective coronary angioplasty was studied in 583 patients with acute myocardial infarction. Anterior infarction (Group I), inferior infarction with precordial ST segment depression (Group II) and inferior infarction without precordial ST segment depression (Group III) were present in 289, 135 and 159 patients, respectively. Precordial ST segment depression was more frequent in circumflex than right coronary infarct-related arteries (44 [71%] of 62 versus 91 [40%] of 230; p = 0.000). Although acute patency rates were not statistically different, there was a trend toward different patency rates at day 7 (Group I 88%, Group II 84%, Group III 80%; p = 0.089) partly because of insignificantly higher reocclusion rates in inferior infarction without precordial ST segment depression (Group I 11%, Group II 10%, Group III 18%, p = 0.104). Infarct zone regional wall motion (standard deviations/chord) in inferior infarction was lower with precordial ST segment depression, both acutely (Group I -2.8 +/- 0.9, Group II -2.5 +/- 1.2, Group III 2.0 +/- 1.1; p = 0.000) and at day 7 (Group I -2.2 +/- 1.1, Group II -2.3 +/- 1.1, Group III -1.9 +/- 1.3; p = 0.011). Precordial ST segment depression was associated with a lower ejection fraction in inferior infarction both acutely (Group I 47 +/- 11%, Group II 53 +/- 11%, Group III 58 +/- 9%; p = 0.000) and at day 7 (Group I 49 +/- 12%, Group II 53 +/- 10%, Group III 58 +/- 8%; p = 0.000). Complication rates tended to be higher in inferior infarction when precordial ST segment depression was present. Mortality rates for Groups I, II and III were 8%, 6% and 5%, respectively. These results suggest that precordial ST segment depression in inferior infarction predicts a worse ventriculographic and clinical outcome despite reperfusion therapy. 
Synergistic effect of intraperitoneally administered calcium channel blockade and recombinant tissue plasminogen activator to prevent adhesion formation in an animal model. Previous reports have shown the benefits of calcium channel blockers and recombinant tissue plasminogen activator to prevent postoperative adhesion formation in animal models. To assess the potential benefit of synergistic therapy for the prevention of postoperative adhesion formation, these agents were studied in a rabbit uterine horn model. Four groups of New Zealand White rabbits (n = 8 per group) had a bilateral devascularization injury to the uterine horns. Before closure saline solution, verapamil hydrochloride (2.5 mu/kg/hour), recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (4 mg total dose), or a combination of verapamil and recombinant tissue plasminogen activator at the stated doses were instilled by means of an Alzet osmotic pump x 200 hours. Adhesion scores were evaluated after this time period by estimating the total uterine horn surface involved in adhesions at a terminal laparotomy and by clinically grading the response to determine whether minimal adhesions formed. Results of the total uterine horn surface scores were (mean score +/- SE): saline solution, 44% +/- 3.7%; verapamil, 19% +/- 4.8%; recombinant tissue plasminogen activator, 11% +/- 3.6%; combined, 3% +/- 1% (p less than 0.01 to control and p less than 0.05 to single-drug therapy). Results of the number of animals per group with minimal adhesions were as follows: saline solution, 0; verapamil, 1; recombinant tissue plasminogen activator, 3; combined, 8 (P less than 0.01). These results show a synergistic benefit of verapamil and recombinant tissue plasminogen activator to prevent postsurgical adhesion formation when delivered via the intraperitoneal route. 
Myonecrosis and myofibrosis as complications of sickle cell anemia. Painful crises in sickle cell anemia are associated with infarction and subsequent fibrosis of many different organs. Myonecrosis secondary to muscle infarction during a crisis and subsequent fibrosis are often not recognized as complications of sickle cell anemia. We describe four patients, all of whom had recurrent episodes of symmetric proximal muscle pain and swelling as prominent features of their crises. Muscle biopsies showed acute myonecrosis with a minimal inflammatory reaction as well as myofibrosis with abundant collagen deposition. Chronic sequelae consisted of muscle induration, atrophy, and contractures. 
Effect of chronic ethanol feeding on high density lipoprotein subfractions in rats. We have reported previously that chronic alcohol consumption in the rat produced elevated total serum high density lipoprotein (HDL) fraction, but HDL particles of the alcohol-fed rat were deficient in apolipoprotein (apo) E. In that report, serum HDL particles were prepared by successive ultracentrifugation method and there were concerns that the apo E deficiency in HDL particles was artificially produced by centrifugal forces. In the present report, apo Al affinity column chromatography was used instead of successive ultracentrifugation and it likewise yielded HDL particles from alcohol-fed rats that exhibited lower apo E: apo Al ratio than HDL from control rats (0.185 +/- 0.016 vs. 0.303 +/- 0.017, respectively). When the total serum lipoprotein fraction (d less than 1.21) was analyzed by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), both HDL and VLDL peaks were higher in alcohol-fed rats than controls. The size of apo E deficient HDL particles from alcohol-fed rats determined by HPLC did not differ from that of normal HDL particles. When HDL (1.063 less than d less than 1.21) was subfractionated into HDL2 (1.063 less than d less than 1.125) and HDL3 (1.125 less than d less than 1.21), only HDL2 of alcohol-fed rats showed lowered apo E: apo Al ratio when compared with same HDL subfraction of control animals. Therefore, the molecular structure of only HDL2 (but not HDL3) was affected by alcohol-feeding. Another HDL subpopulation which is enriched with apo E, i.e. HDL1 (1.054 less than d less than 1.063), was also prepared. 
Use of echocardiography for patient management in chronic ischemic heart disease. Myocardial ischemia causes regional myocardial contractile and relaxation abnormalities. The extent of ischemia is determined by the distribution and severity of coronary artery stenoses. In coronary heart disease, two powerful predictors of prognosis are the coronary anatomy and ventricular function. Management in coronary heart disease is directed by accurate diagnosis and individualized objectives. Echocardiography at rest and exercise, combined with Doppler and color flow imaging, are properly applied to the differential diagnosis of common clinical syndromes in ischemic heart disease, the identification of the proximal coronary arteries, and the effects of ischemia and prior infarction. Subsequent use of coronary arteriography partially depends on the philosophy regarding the applicability of coronary surgery or angioplasty in an individual patient. Prediction of multivessel, left main, or proximal left anterior descending coronary artery disease by extensive wall motion abnormalities or an abnormal left ventricular ejection fraction may direct the clinician to coronary arteriography to select among coronary surgery, angioplasty, or medical management. 
Treatment of advanced-stage Hodgkin's disease: alternating noncrossresistant MOPP/CABS is not superior to MOPP. One hundred twenty-five assessable patients with advanced-stage Hodgkin's disease were randomized to receive mechlorethamine, vincristine, procarbazine, and prednisone (MOPP) or MOPP alternating with lomustine (CCNU), doxorubicin, bleomycin, and streptozocin (CABS). The median follow-up is 7.7 years. The complete response rate was 60 of 66 MOPP-treated patients (91%) and 54 of 59 MOPP/CABS-treated patients (92%) (difference not significant). The level of the disease-free survival curve at longest follow-up is 65% for MOPP-treated patients and 72% for MOPP/CABS-treated patients (difference not significant). The overall survival at 12 years is projected at 68% for MOPP-treated patients and 54% for MOPP/CABS-treated patients (difference not significant). Thus, there were no significant differences in efficacy between MOPP and MOPP/CABS. However, MOPP/CABS was more emetogenic than MOPP, and four MOPP/CABS-treated patients went on to develop secondary acute leukemia. No MOPP-treated patients developed leukemia. High initial erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) and high platelet counts adversely affected treatment outcome. MOPP-treated patients who received greater than 81% of the projected dose intensity of vincristine over the first three cycles had significantly improved disease-free survival rates over those receiving less than 81%. MOPP/CABS-treated patients who received greater than 82% of the projected dose intensity of vincristine had significantly better overall survival than those who received less than 82%. Disease-free survival on both arms was significantly better in patients who received greater than 84% of the projected dose intensity of all agents. The effect of dose intensity was particularly apparent in patients with poor prognostic factors where those who received greater than 84% of the projected dose intensity of all agents had significantly improved disease-free and overall survival. 
HLA-DR expression on the microvasculature of portal tracts in idiopathic portal hypertension. Immunohistochemical characteristics and relation to portal phlebosclerosis. We recently reported that HLA-DR antigen was expressed on the microvasculature of portal tracts more frequently in idiopathic portal hypertension (IPH) than in normal livers or in other hepatic diseases, and that this HLA-DR expression may be involved in the development of the portal venopathy characteristic of IPH. The present study was performed to evaluate the relationship between the HLA-DR expression and portal tract lesions, as well as to investigate the immunohistochemical characteristics of the HLA-DR-positive microvasculature using liver wedge biopsy specimens obtained from 32 patients with IPH. According to the degree of phlebosclerosis of the portal veins, the portal tracts were divided into three groups: mild, moderate, and severe. The microvasculature in portal tracts was positive for HLA-DR in 21 (66%) of the 32 specimens and in 133 (44%) of 302 portal tracts. In the 21 specimens, there was no significant difference in the prevalence of HLA-DR-positive microvasculature among the three groups: it occurred in 57 (66%) of 86 portal tracts in the mild group, 53 (61%) of 87 portal tracts in the moderate group, and 23 (49%) of 47 portal tracts in the severe group. The HLA-DR-positive microvasculature was positive for type IV collagen and receptors of Ulex europaeus lectin I, suggesting that HLA-DR-positive microvessels are blood vessels. These findings suggest that HLA-DR antigen is already expressed on portal microvessels in the incipient stage of IPH, and that HLA-DR expression persists during the progression of portal phlebosclerosis. The HLA-DR expression may be an initiating factor leading to immunologic assault on portal microvessels in IPH. 
A prospective comparison of thromboembolic stockings, external sequential pneumatic compression stockings and heparin sodium/dihydroergotamine mesylate for the prevention of thromboembolic complications in urological surgery. Deep venous thrombosis and pulmonary emboli are reported to occur in up to 66% of the patients undergoing a major urological operation. Thromboembolic stockings, external sequential pneumatic compression stockings and anticoagulant agents, such as heparin sodium plus dihydroergotamine mesylate, have been suggested to decrease the risk of deep venous thrombosis and pulmonary emboli. A total of 74 evaluable patients undergoing a major urological operation was randomized to receive either thromboembolic stockings, external sequential pneumatic compression stockings, or heparin plus dihydroergotamine as prophylaxis against deep venous thrombosis and pulmonary emboli. 111Indium-labeled platelet scans, performed preoperatively and on days 1, 3 and 6 postoperatively, were used to diagnose deep venous thrombosis and pulmonary emboli. Mean patient age was 63 years and all but 1 operation was performed for neoplastic disease. Deep venous thrombosis was detected in 5 of 25 patients (20%) with thromboembolic stockings, 3 of 24 (12.5%) with external sequential pneumatic compression stockings and 2 of 25 (8%) with heparin plus dihydroergotamine. There was no difference in blood loss or complications among the groups. Although statistical significance among the treatment groups was not reached in this study, the trend to a decrease in deep venous thrombosis and pulmonary emboli with external sequential pneumatic compression stockings and heparin plus dihydroergotamine, and an absence of an increase in morbidity in these groups supports the use of these modalities to decrease the morbidity and mortality of deep venous thrombosis and pulmonary emboli.
