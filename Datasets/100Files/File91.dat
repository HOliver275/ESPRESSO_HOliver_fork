Preoperative prostate-specific antigen in predicting pathologic stage and grade after radical prostatectomy. Preoperative serum prostate-specific antigen (PSA) was measured in 63 men who had clinically localized, previously untreated adenocarcinoma of the prostate and underwent subsequent radical prostatectomy and bilateral pelvic lymph node dissection. Pathologic stage and grade were correlated to the serum PSA value. Patients with organ-confined (P1, P2) and extracapsular (P3, P3N +) prostate cancer had elevated preoperative serum PSA levels (greater than 4 ng/mL) in 61 and 90 percent of cases, respectively. Patients with low-grade and high-grade tumor histology had elevated preoperative PSA levels in 62 and 80 percent of cases, respectively. In distinguishing between organ-confined and extracapsular disease with a preoperative serum PSA of 10 ng/mL as a cutoff value, the sensitivity was 68 percent, the specificity was 66 percent, the positive predictive value was 46 percent, and the negative predictive value was 83 percent. Although there was a trend of increasing preoperative serum PSA levels with higher pathologic stage or grade, there was no significant difference in preoperative serum PSA values with pathologic stage and/or grade considered as a group or in determining stage and/or grade preoperatively on an individual basis. 
A population-based study on the incidence and survival rates of 3857 glioma patients diagnosed from 1953 to 1984. Intracranial glioma was diagnosed during the patient's life and histologically verified in 3857 patients between 1953 and 1984 in Finland. Their survival up to the end of 1987 was analyzed, the follow-up being complete. The treatment was by operation in 1193 cases, radiation in 459 cases, both operation and radiation in 1486 cases, and neither operation nor radiation in 719 cases. The 1-year, 5-year, 10-year, and 15-year cumulative relative survival rates were 0.53, 0.29, 0.20, and 0.18, respectively. The newborn to 14-year-olds lost 56% of their life expectancy; the 15-year-olds to 44-year-olds, 71%; the 45-year-olds to 64-year-olds, 88%; and the 65-year-olds to 99-year-olds, 91%. According to the model with the best fit in regression analysis the prognosis was significantly better among young, recently diagnosed patients who had undergone both operation and radiation. 
Thermal effects and histologic changes from Nd:YAG laser irradiation on normal and diseased aortic tissue using a novel angioplasty catheter with a mobile optical fiber: an in vitro assessment. Although various laser angioplasty devices are currently being examined, thermal damage and perforation of the vessel wall remains the major acute complication of vascular laser recanalization. Consequently, the aim of this study was to investigate the thermal effects and histologic changes from laser irradiation (Nd:YAG, 1064 nm) on normal and diseased aortic tissue using a novel angioplasty device. During laser emission the coaxially guided optical fiber tip was positioned in reference to the end hole of the metallic capped probe as follows: (1) at the end hole (metal-cap position), (2) protruding 10 mm from that end hole (bare-fiber position), (3) withdrawn 5 mm into the metal cap's lumen (hot-tip position). In total, 96 laser impacts (25 joule: 5 W, 5 s, each) were produced on normal and atherosclerotic aorta in air through a 0.2-mm-core-diameter silica quartz fiber, with direct contact on the intimal surface of the target tissue by both the fiber and the metal cap and by either the fiber or the metal cap (n = 32 each). Tissue temperature was measured by means of special sensors positioned opposite the irradiated intimal spot in direct contact with the adventitial surface. Morphohistologic evaluation of lesions was performed and injury indexes were determined. 
Use of a chlorhexidine dressing to reduce microbial colonization of epidural catheters. We performed a prospective randomized controlled trial to assess the efficacy of a chlorhexidine dressing in reducing the microbial flora at the insertion site of epidural catheters. These catheters were used for acute pain management and were dressed either by a standardized method or with a CHX/urethane sponge composite. Microbial colonization of the catheter developed in 9 of 31 controls (29.0%) and 1 of 26 (3.8%) catheters with the CHX dressing (P less than 0.05%). The CHX dressing caused no adverse effects. The data suggest that delivery of antiseptic to the catheter wound site reduces catheter colonization with a possible reduction in the risk of epidural catheter-related infection. 
Development of human neural transplantation. The possibility of altering the course of Parkinson's disease by brain grafting is slowly becoming a reality through the efforts of many research groups worldwide. It has been shown that this procedure, as performed in high-level medical research centers, usually produces no permanent adverse effects and can effectively ameliorate parkinsonian signs in certain patients. This progress has served to reinforce our commitment to develop neural transplantation into an effective therapy to treat such a devastating neurodegenerative disease. We have summarized the most important events that have shaped the initial phase of this research. In the course of the last 4 years, considerable knowledge has been gained in the clinical neurosciences regarding the real potential of various brain grafting procedures in treating Parkinson's disease, their shortcomings, and their usefulness in carefully selected patients. There is still no consensus regarding the various fundamental aspects of human brain grafting in Parkinson's disease. Questions concerning surgical technique, candidate selection, the optimal brain regions for implantation, the optimal tissue for implantation, and the real usefulness of brain grafting must be addressed. The importance of the quality of adrenal medulla fragments for grafting, the requirement for immunosuppressors in fetal brain grafting, and the optimal fetal age and the amount of donor tissue for effective grafting are additional areas of concern. The potential of xenografting, preserved tissues, and genetically engineered cells for human brain grafting remain unanswered. The development of human neural transplantation is the responsibility and privilege of neurosurgery. 
Peritoneal endometriosis: endometrial tissue implantation as its primary etiologic mechanism. The mechanisms involved in primary implantation of pelvic endometriosis were investigated in women undergoing laparoscopy as part of an infertility evaluation. Among the women with a diagnosis of endometriosis, those with no observed lesions in the ovaries and no adhesions in the pelvic cavity were classified as being in stage I. These women were further subdivided into two groups: the stage Ia group in which implants were found in one area (25 women) and the stage Ib group in which implants were found in two or more areas (29 women). In both groups the most frequent site was the uterosacral ligaments followed by the posterior uterine serosa, the posterior cul-de-sac, and the posterior broad ligaments in that order. Regardless of the position of the uterus, endometriosis was found significantly more frequently in the posterior compartment. The finding that the most frequent implants on the uterosacral ligaments were near the tubal ostium and, in the stage Ia group, the absence of implants on the anterior uterine serosa but a 33% frequency on the posterior uterine serosa, which is more frequently exposed to menstrual blood, suggest that implantation of endometriosis is the result of retrograde menstruation. However, the possibility that metaplasia of the serosal epithelium is stimulated by menstrual blood cannot be ruled out, inasmuch as the process of implantation in the peritoneum has not yet been proved. 
Experimental hemorrhage and blunt trauma do not increase circulating tumor necrosis factor. Tumor necrosis factor (TNF) is a potent cytokine mediator of the shock states associated with sepsis and burn injury. This experimental study was done to determine whether circulating TNF plays a major role in the vasomotor collapse seen following experimental hemorrhage and blunt injury. Twenty anesthetized pigs were divided into two groups. Ten animals were bled 60% of their calculated blood volume in 15 minutes. Animals in Group IA (n = 5) had no treatment, and Group IB animals (n = 5) were given twice the shed volume as crystalloid 30 minutes after hemorrhage. The other animals, groups IIa and IIb (n = 5 each), were first subjected to a blunt injury to the thigh sufficient to cause a midshaft femur fracture, then bled and similarly treated. In both groups, mean arterial pressure (MAP), cardiac output (CO), and serum TNF activity by L929 bioassay were measured at 15-minute intervals for 120 minutes after hemorrhage or hemorrhage and blunt injury. An additional three animals were infused with 4 x 10(8)/kg heat-killed E. coli to validate the TNF assay. All bled animals sustained a fall in MAP and CO to a mean of 33% of baseline values, with or without fracture. Group IB and IIB animals responded to fluid resuscitation by restoration of MAP and CO to 85%-97% of the baseline values. Tumor necrosis factor was not detectable before injury and remained undetectable in all these animals during the 120 minutes of the experiment despite hemorrhage alone or combined hemorrhage and blunt trauma, with or without fluid resuscitation. The test animals receiving the E. coli responded with markedly elevated TNF levels, which peaked at 90 minutes after injection. 
Effect of disc degeneration at one level on the adjacent level in axial mode. Nonlinear three-dimensional finite element models of a ligamentous two motion segments spine specimen (L3-L4-L5) were developed to investigate the effects of disc degeneration, simulated at the L4-L5 level, on the biomechanical behavior of the adjacent intact L3-L4 motion segment. The disc degeneration was simulated by removing the hydrostatic capabilities of the nucleus and making the L4-L5 disc stiffer than a normal disc. The results of the degenerated model were compared with the predictions for a model in which the L4-L5 disc was left intact. The loads on the facets decreased, and intradiscal pressure in the intact L3-L4 disc increased as a result of disc degeneration compared with the intact model. The predicted increase in the intradiscal pressure and the associated increase in the disc bulge in the posterior region over time may trigger the degenerative process at the L3-L4 motion segment. This is in accordance with the Wolff's law; living tissue responds to chronic changes in stresses and strains. The limitations of the present two motion segments model and the potentials of multisegmental models are discussed. 
Immunological evidence for the co-existence of the Lambert-Eaton myasthenic syndrome and myasthenia gravis in two patients. Two patients are described in whom a clinical and electromyographic diagnosis of the Lambert-Eaton myasthenic syndrome (LEMS) was made. Serum antibodies to voltage-gated calcium channels (VGCCs), the antigenic target in LEMS and to acetylcholine receptors (AChRs), the antigen in myasthenia gravis, were detected at raised titres in both cases, using radioimmunoassays based on 125I-omega-Conotoxin labelled VGCCs and 125I-alpha-Bungarotoxin labelled AChRs. These data provide immunological evidence for the coexistence of the two disorders in these patients. 
Cancer risk among staff at two radiotherapy departments in Denmark. In comparison with the general Danish population, the relative risk (RR) for cancer among staff members employed in two radiotherapy departments in Denmark during 1954-1982 and alive on 1 April 1968 was assessed by linkage to the Danish Cancer Registry. All staff had been monitored with film dosimeters for exposure to radiation. The study cohort consisted of 4151 persons, accruing 49553 person-years at risk. The collective radiation dose was 76.54 manSv and the mean dose 18.4 mSv. A total of 163 cancer cases were observed with 152.3 expected. The risks for cancers usually considered to be radiogenic were not elevated. A significant excess of prostatic cancer was observed (five cases, relative risk, 6.02; 95% confidence interval, 1.94-14.06); this is likely to be a chance finding. No relation was observed between radiation dose or years of exposure and cancer risk, but a weak non-significant increase in risk with time since first exposure was seen. 
The economic implications of high-risk abdominal aortic aneurysms. Financial data of 102 patients undergoing elective and emergent abdominal aortic aneurysm repair over a 3-year period were evaluated in terms of postoperative length of stay, net revenue, total standard cost, and net margin. Cost reimbursement was based on diagnosis related group payments. Aneurysm repairs were classified as emergent, high-risk elective, or low-risk elective. A net loss of $409,459 was noted for the entire series. Emergent repairs, although only 12% of the population, accounted for 73% of total losses, with a mean loss of $24,655/patient. The mean net loss in the high-risk elective group was $3590/patient, and a net gain of $1132/patient was noted in the low-risk elective group. Length of stay outliers, defined as length of stay greater than 28 days, contributed to the bulk of the losses in the elective series and were predominant in the high-risk group. No preoperative comorbidity, other than high-risk classification, predicted outlier status. Length of stay correlated with total standard costs in all categories of aneurysm repair. Third party payment for length of stay outliers was inadequate; the diagnosis related group system warrants revision so that outlier reimbursement will be based on a tiered system derived from length of stay. 
Lateral parascapular extrapleural approach to the upper thoracic spine. The upper thoracic vertebrae are difficult to approach surgically because of the narrowing of the thoracic inlet, the proximity of the brachial plexus, and the parascapular shoulder musculature. A novel lateral parascapular extrapleural approach to the upper thoracic vertebrae is described. The parascapular shoulder musculature (trapezius, levator scapulae, and rhomboid muscles) is reflected off the spinous processes to the scapula as a musculocutaneous flap, preserving the neurovascular supply. The paraspinal musculature is mobilized and retracted, and the upper dorsal ribs are removed with caution to avoid injury to the C-8 and T-1 nerve roots. The rami communicantes are transected, and the sympathetic chain is displaced anterolaterally. The T2-4 vertebrae can be approached unobstructed. The T-1 nerve root obstructs posterolateral access to the T-1 vertebra, necessitating an inferolateral approach underneath the T-1 nerve root axilla. Four patients with compressive myelopathy from upper thoracic vertebral metastases underwent neural decompression, vertebral reconstruction, and posterior spinal fixation with this approach. Their postoperative neurological status was either unchanged or improved. Complications included radiographic pleural effusion and superficial wound dehiscence; one patient required posterior spinal reinstrumentation for progressive kyphosis. One patient developed pneumonia 7 days postoperatively which was unresponsive to appropriate treatment. It is believed that the anatomical limitations to this region have been overcome, and that excellent exposure of the T1-4 vertebrae for neural decompression and vertebral reconstruction can be performed safely. A major advantage is that posterior spinal fixation can be carried out simultaneously. 
Wound complications after modified radical mastectomy compared with tylectomy with axillary lymph node dissection. Tylectomy with axillary lymph node dissection and radiotherapy (TAD) has become an accepted treatment for early breast cancer and has been shown to result in equal 5- and 8-year survival when compared with modified radical mastectomy (MRM). In order to determine the safety of TAD with respect to wound complications and to identify potential risk factors, we reviewed the charts of 560 patients undergoing MRM (n = 387) and TAD (n = 173) at Virginia Mason Medical Center from 1983 through 1989. The incidence of infection, seroma, hematoma, and epidermolysis were compared, and obesity, age 60 years or older, smoking, antibiotics, and wound drainage were examined as possible risk factors. There were more wound complications in the MRM group versus the TAD group (49% versus 35%; p less than 0.01), specifically more seromas (29% versus 18%; p less than 0.01) and epidermolysis (18% versus 0%). In the MRM group, age 60 years or older was associated with seroma (p less than 0.01) and smoking was associated with epidermolysis (p less than 0.01). In the TAD group, obesity was associated with infection. In both groups, volume of drainage from closed suction wound drains greater than 30 mL in the 24 hours prior to removal of the last drain was associated with seroma (p less than 0.05). 
The NACI Registry: an instrument for the evaluation of new approaches to coronary intervention. The NACI Investigators. The New Approaches to Coronary Intervention (NACI) Registry was developed to collect in-depth data about patients whose coronary artery lesions are being treated with new interventional techniques such as atherectomy, stents, and laser devices. The NACI Registry database distinguishes among several possible "modes" for device use, such as preparatory, planned definitive, and bailout use. Common definitions are used for data collection across all devices, and device-specific forms are used to record procedural details. NACI's unique modular form design facilitates thorough data collection, even for the most complex treatment scenarios. The database structure allows for data analysis at the patient, procedure, lesion, and device levels, as required to perform in-depth analyses of the immediate and long-term success of new devices. Once adequate knowledge of basic device performance has been collected, the Registry structure can also allow expeditious planning and performance of randomized trials comparing a new device to conventional PTCA. 
Transgenic oncogene mice. Tumor phenotype predicts genotype. The hypothesis that oncogenes influence tumor phenotype was tested by examining slides from 607 mammary tumors from 407 transgenic mice bearing the ras, myc, and/or neu oncogenes. Most tumors (91%) had patterns (phenotypes) that could not be classified by Dunn's standard nomenclature. The nonstandard tumors were described as eosinophilic small cell (SC), basophilic large cell (LC), or pale intermediate cell (IC). The SC tumor was associated with ras, the LC was associated with myc, and the IC was associated with neu, with specificities more than .90 and sensitivities ranging from .99 to .48. Thus, the tumor phenotype could be used to predict which oncogene was present in the animal. The presence of myc in combination with either ras or neu resulted in the predominance of LC tumors and accelerated tumorigenesis. The combination of ras and neu resulted in a decreased tumor incidence. Thus, knowledge of the oncogenes that were present could be used to predict the natural history of the disease. 
Primary squamous cell carcinoma of the terminal ileum. A case of squamous cell carcinoma of the terminal ileum with no underlying duplication or inflammatory disorder is described. The neoplasm seemed to have originated from the surface epithelium, invading the wall and metastasising to the regional lymph nodes. The 65 year old patient was free of disease three years after having had the tumour removed. Previous reports of squamous carcinoma of the small intestine have been associated with intestinal duplication or metastatic disease from distant sites. 
Induction of hemoglobin synthesis by downregulation of MYB protein with an antisense oligodeoxynucleotide. Reduced expression of the proto-oncogene c-myb appears necessary for erythroid differentiation induced by chemical agents and by the natural regulator, erythropoietin (Epo). Treatment of Epo-responsive Rauscher erythroleukemia cells with an anti-sense oligodeoxynucleotide to c-myb in the absence of other inducers downregulated myb protein markedly and caused hemoglobinization of the cells within 48 hours. Epo treatment, which downregulates c-myb in these cells, induced hemoglobinization to the same degree. Epo also induced the appearance of anion transport protein on the plasma membrane, consistent with terminal differentiation. In contrast, antisense c-myb did not induce this erythroid marker. The results are consistent with a role for myb protein in the regulation of hemoglobin synthesis. 
Heterozygous protein C deficiency associated with multiple congenital hemangiomas--a case report. Congenital protein C deficiency is described as associated with recurrent thrombotic manifestations. The proband, a fourteen-year-old female, has a history of severe and frequent thrombotic disease, moreover, she presents congenital multiple hemangiomas. Family history was positive for protein C deficiency since the mother of the proposita is also affected and has manifested deep venous thrombophlebitis. Two additional relatives on the maternal side were not available for study but were reported to be symptomatic. None of the family members presented angiomatosis. This case report represents the first description of the association of protein C deficiency with multiple hemangiomas. 
Intratracheal injection of endotoxin and cytokines. II. Interleukin-6 and transforming growth factor beta inhibit acute inflammation. The nature of the endogenous mediators that down-regulate and curtail the exodus of neutrophils into local acute inflammatory sites is unknown. In the present report, interleukin-6 (IL-6) and transforming growth factor beta (TGF beta), members of a family of macrophage-derived proteins known as cytokines, are shown to inhibit significantly the acute neutrophilic exodus caused by an intratracheal injection of endotoxin (LPS), a proinflammatory component of the cell walls of gram-negative bacteria. Transforming growth factor beta (10 micrograms) and IL-6 (10 micrograms) coinjected intratracheally with LPS (10 micrograms) each inhibited the number of neutrophils in 6-hour bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) specimens by approximately 50%. The intratracheal coinjection of IL-6, TGF beta, and LPS inhibited the LPS-induced neutrophilic inflammatory exodus by nearly 75%. Interleukin-6 also is shown to be endogenously upregulated within the lung after intratracheal challenge with endotoxin, providing evidence that IL-6 may represent an endogenous negative feedback mechanism to inhibit endotoxin-initiated cytokine-mediated acute inflammation. Interleukin-6 and TGF beta both strongly inhibited the quantity of TNF-alpha recovered in the BAL fluid of LPS-challenged rats, suggesting that downregulation of LPS-induced TNF-alpha production within the lung represents one mechanism whereby IL-6 and TGF beta exert an antiinflammatory action. Interleukin-6 and TGF beta represent novel pharmacologic and, probably, endogenous inhibitors of acute inflammation. 
Multiple pilomatricomas and myotonic dystrophy. Multiple pilomatricomas are rare. However, among patients with myotonic dystrophy, the occurrence is higher. The authors report a patient, to their knowledge the 11th case of multiple pilomatricomas associated with myotonic dystrophy, to emphasize that these tumors may be associated with the disease. 
Problems encountered in leg shortening. We reviewed 46 leg-shortening operations (37 femoral and nine tibial), performed by different methods, to assess the incidence of complications and permanent disability. Shortening of as much as 7.5 cm in the femur and 5 cm in the tibia was achieved in men of normal height without any loss of function. Complications were seen with all surgical techniques despite the use of modern implants. Most problems arose from inadequate stabilisation of the osteotomy. The most reliable method of femoral shortening was open subtrochanteric osteotomy with preservation of the isthmus, and fixation with an intramedullary nail locked at its proximal end. In tibial shortening, bone excision should be at the level of the flare in the lower diaphysis in order to achieve reliable bone healing. Simple intramedullary nail fixation should be supplemented with a long-leg cast for six weeks or the nail should be locked at both ends to prevent postoperative distraction or rotation. 
Estrogen and progesterone receptors in lymphangioleiomyomatosis, epithelioid hemangioendothelioma, and sclerosing hemangioma of the lung. The therapeutic options in the treatment of lung neoplasia usually have not included hormonal therapy, unlike those for primary tumors of other sites (e.g., breast). However, two mesenchymal proliferations of lung, lymphangioleiomyomatosis and epithelioid hemangioendothelioma (EHE), and one epithelial tumor, sclerosing hemangioma (SH), have a significant female predilection and may benefit from such hormonal therapy. The authors investigated five cases each of EHE and lymphangioleiomyomatosis and four cases of SH for expression of estrogen and progesterone receptors and 17-beta estradiol in paraffin-embedded tissue. Only one case each of lymphangioleiomyomatosis and EHE expressed 17-beta estradiol. All of the other cases were negative. These findings are contrary to the viewpoint held in published literature, especially in case reports of lymphangioleiomyomatosis, describing patients with positive estrogen and progesterone receptor results. Consequently, a number of issues must be considered in the clinical and immunohistochemical evaluation of the estrogen and progesterone receptor status of these rare pulmonary neoplasms. 
Stapes surgery: complications and airway infection. From a group of 1,111 patients who had stapedectomy or stapedotomy performed in a 10-year period, a thorough investigation was made of 11 patients who had a total hearing loss and 8 patients who developed a partial sensorineural hearing loss after operation. The data obtained indicate that postoperative infection with influenza virus may be responsible for unexpected complications following stapedectomy. A close relation was found between the appearance of complications and periods of epidemics of influenza. 
Surgical management of perilymph fistulas. A new technique. A wide range of recurrence rates (21% to 47%) for perilymph fistula repairs have been reported in the otology literature. An improved surgical technique developed at the Portland (Ore) Good Samaritan Hospital and Medical Center Neurotology Department was used to repair perilymph fistulas in 58 patients from October 1986 to October 1988. Our recurrence rate was reduced from 27% in a 1982-1985 study to 8% in our study. At 1 year postoperatively, improvements in disequillibrium, dizziness, and vertigo were comparable with results of older surgical techniques. Functional outcomes were also good: 83% of patients returned to normal activities of daily living, and 71% also returned to school or resumed gainful employment outside the home. 
Serum testosterone:dihydrotestosterone ratio and CA 19-9 in the diagnosis of pancreatic cancer. The testosterone:dihydrotestosterone ratio (T:DHT) and the antigenic marker CA 19-9 were studied in the serum of 21 male patients with pancreatic cancer and 62 controls with other gastrointestinal malignancies or benign pancreatobiliary disease. Specificity of the T:DHT ratio was 98%, significantly better than the specificity of CA 19-9 at both a 37 U/ml cutoff level (61%) and at 100 U/ml (79%). Sensitivity of the T:DHT ratio was 67%, and that of CA 19-9, 71% and 90% at the upper and lower cutoff levels, respectively. False-negative results of the T:DHT ratio were found predominantly in cases of advanced pancreatic cancer, whereas all four stage I patients had an abnormal (less than 5) T:DHT ratio. These results suggest that the T:DHT ratio is a useful marker for pancreatic cancer in males. It can be used alone or in combination with CA 19-9, and should be further evaluated in the differential diagnosis of patients with the early stages of this disease. 
Unsuspected sphincter damage following childbirth revealed by anal endosonography. Anal endosonography was performed in 62 consecutive patients with incontinence of flatus or faeces following obstetric trauma, and in 18 parous controls. Of the incontinent group, 90% had defects in the external sphincter, 65% in the internal sphincter and 44% disruption of the perineal body, compared with none of the controls. This triad of lesions is pathognomonic of obstetric trauma. Anal endosonography revealed a higher prevalence of sphincter damage than expected from anorectal physiology tests, and therefore has a role in screening patients following complicated or difficult deliveries. 
Tuberculosis diagnosed at death in the United States. From 1985 through 1988, 5.1 percent of TB cases reported in the United States were diagnosed at death. Differences in the proportions diagnosed at death by race/ethnicity, sex, and place of birth (United States vs foreign-born) were relatively small. The proportion of cases diagnosed at death increased with age, from 0.7 percent in patients less than 5 years old to 18.6 percent among patients 85 years and older. Only 26.0 percent of cases diagnosed alive were among those 65 years and older, but 60.3 percent of those diagnosed at death were in this age group. Eighteen percent of cases with miliary, meningeal and peritoneal TB were diagnosed at death, compared with 4.8 percent among those with pulmonary TB. These data indicate that TB too often remains unrecognized and that, to prevent continuing deaths from this curable disease, a high index of suspicion of TB remains important, particularly among the elderly and among persons with extrapulmonary sites of disease. 
Potential for mosquito transmission of attenuated strains of Rift Valley fever virus. Studies were conducted to determine if two attenuated strains of Rift Valley fever (RVF) virus could be transmitted by Culex pipiens mosquitoes. Both strains (RVF MP 12 and T1) replicated in and were transmitted by female Cx. pipiens after intrathoracic inoculation. Mosquitoes also became infected with and transmitted the RVF MP12 strain after ingesting virus from a blood-soaked cotton pledget. However, because of the low viremias produced in infected animals, it is unlikely that mosquitoes would become infected by feeding on an animal inoculated with either of these viruses. Although both strains were transmitted by mosquitoes after intrathoracic inoculation, there was no evidence of reversion to a virulent virus. 
Fungal sinusitis in immunocompromised children with neoplasms. This paper reviews the treatment and diagnosis of immunocompromised patients with fungal sinusitis at St Jude Children's Research Hospital. Sinusitis of all types was found to be more common in patients with hematopoietic neoplasms than in patients with solid tumors; 42% of patients with leukemia had abnormal sinus radiographs. Eight cases of pathologically proven fungal sinusitis were identified. All patients were undergoing chemotherapy for either acute myeloblastic leukemia or acute lymphoblastic leukemia and had neutrophil counts less than 100 cells/mm3. The most common findings were fever, facial pain, and abnormal sinus radiographs. Surveillance cultures of the upper aerodigestive system did not reliably predict sinus pathogens. An aggressive treatment approach consisting of early administration of amphotericin B (intravenously and via catheter irrigations of the sinuses) and surgical drainage is advocated. There was an 80% survival rate in patients in remission who were undergoing maintenance chemotherapy. All patients undergoing chemotherapy for relapse died. 
Evolving experience with thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysm repair at a single institution. Fifty-seven patients underwent repair of atherosclerotic thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysms between 1978 and 1990. Five patients had urgent surgery for rupture. The 30-day operative mortality rate for the entire group was 18% (10 patients). Before July 1987, 19 patients (group 1) were operated on by use of a technique previously described. In these earlier patients the peritoneum was routinely entered, the diaphragm was divided radially, and no heparin was given. Among patients in group 1 there was a 30-day operative mortality rate of 42% (8 patients), and morbidity included myocardial infarction 4 (21%), respiratory failure 9 (47%), renal failure 12 (63%), bleeding requiring reoperation 4 (21%), and intestinal ischemia 3 (16%). Since July 1987 a standardized approach to all elective thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysms has been used in 38 patients (group 2). This method uses a left thoracoabdominal incision, circumferential division of the hemidiaphragm, retronephric totally extraperitoneal aortic exposure, single lung anesthesia, full heparinization, the graft inclusion technique, and liberal use of visceral endarterectomy. Patients in group 2 sustained a 30-day operative mortality rate of 5% (2 patients) and morbidity included myocardial infarction 2 (5%), respiratory failure 10 (26%), renal failure 11 (29%), bleeding requiring reoperation 1 (3%), paraplegia 6 (16%), and paraparesis 4 (11%). Modern surgery for repair of thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysm results in acceptably low operative mortality rates. Spinal cord ischemia remains an unresolved source of morbidity. 
Thoracic outlet syndrome caused by tumor of the first rib. We report a new case of thoracic outlet syndrome caused by a tumor of the first rib and review 11 other reports found in the literature. A 25-year-old man was admitted with thoracic outlet syndrome in the C8-T1 nerve roots. The first rib was removed through a supraclavicular approach with excision of the medial clavicle. All symptoms disappeared. On histologic examination fibrous dysplasia was found in the rib. Tumors of the first rib are uncommon and are rarely responsible for thoracic outlet syndrome. When the tumor is very large, as in our case, we recommend a supraclavicular approach associated with excision of the medial clavicle. During the liberation of the brachial plexus, great care should be exercised to avoid nerve injuries. Because malignancy of the tumor cannot be eliminated with certainty before or during the operation, wide excision of the entire rib is recommended. 
Small bowel tumours: yield of enteroscopy. A total of 258 patients with obscure gastrointestinal bleeding were referred for small bowel enteroscopy, a procedure which allows endoscopic evaluation of most of the small intestine. A small bowel tumour was found in 5% of patients. In 50% of patients no diagnosis could be made, but when the cause of obscure bleeding was discovered small bowel tumours were the single most common lesion in patients younger than 50 years. Small bowel tumours causing gastrointestinal bleeding may remain undetected despite extensive diagnostic evaluation. We conclude that small bowel tumours are the most common cause of obscure gastrointestinal bleeding in patients less than 50 years of age. Small bowel enteroscopy is diagnostic of small bowel tumours even when all previous diagnostic studies, including enteroclysis and angiography, are negative. 
The relationship between esophageal motility disorders and microvascular angina. Patients with unexplained chest pain have caused investigators in cardiology, gastroenterology, and psychiatry to find abnormalities with overlap among the three specialties. This article reviews the data concerning the potential interrelation of chest pain of cardiac or esophageal origin. 
Prevention of bacterial infection in neutropenic patients with hematologic malignancies. A randomized, multicenter trial comparing norfloxacin with ciprofloxacin. The GIMEMA Infection Program. Gruppo Italiano Malattie Ematologiche Maligne dell'Adulto. OBJECTIVE: To compare the efficacy of norfloxacin and ciprofloxacin in preventing bacterial infection in neutropenic patients. DESIGN: A randomized, controlled, multicenter trial. SETTING: Twenty-one hematologic units in tertiary care or university hospitals. PATIENTS: Eight hundred and one consecutive, afebrile, adult patients who had hematologic malignancies or who had bone marrow transplantation and chemotherapy-induced neutropenia (neutrophil count, less than 1000/mm3) expected to last more than 10 days. INTERVENTION: Patients were randomly assigned to receive orally every 12 hours norfloxacin, 400 mg, or ciprofloxacin, 500 mg. MEASUREMENTS: Efficacy analysis was done for 619 patients: 319 treated with norfloxacin and 300 treated with ciprofloxacin. MAIN RESULTS: More patients receiving ciprofloxacin did not develop fever during neutropenia and did not receive antibiotics (34%) compared with those receiving norfloxacin (25%) (P = 0.01). Patients receiving ciprofloxacin had a lower rate of microbiologically documented infection (17% compared with 24%; P = 0.058), particularly of infection from gram-negative bacilli (4% compared with 9%; P = 0.03). The interval to the first febrile episode was also longer in patients receiving ciprofloxacin (8.3 compared with 7.2 days; P = 0.055). The rates of clinically documented infection, fever of unknown origin, and mortality as well as compliance and tolerability were similar in the two groups. Patients who had neutropenia for less than 15 days, who had severe neutropenia for less than 7 days, and who received antifungal prophylaxis benefited most from ciprofloxacin therapy. CONCLUSION: Ciprofloxacin should be used to prevent the development of infection in neutropenic patients with hematologic malignancies. 
Liver glutathione and cytochrome P450 activity in experimental infection: study of the relative effects of infectious stress and malnutrition. OBJECTIVE: To study the effects of infection and malnutrition on liver glutathione and cytochrome P450 (P450) in rats. DESIGN: Controlled experimental groups (12 groups). ANIMALS: Adult male Sprague-Dawley rats. INTERVENTIONS: Experimental endocarditis, pyelonephritis, or peritonitis were caused. Controls included free-fed rats and sham-operated rats, pair-fed to infected animals. Infection was verified by tissue culture. Rats were killed 3 days (acute infection) or 10 days (chronic infection, except endocarditis) after the induction of infection. RESULTS: Sham rats had lower liver weights, liver/body weight, and liver glutathione values than controls. Infected rats had larger liver weights and liver/body weight ratios and liver glutathione content than shams, and larger liver/body weight ratios than controls (acute infection). Infected rats had lower P450 values than both shams and controls. CONCLUSION: The malnutrition associated with infection caused decreased liver weight and glutathione content. Infection increased the liver weight, and liver glutathione content, but caused severe reduction in liver P450. If the same finding is true in infected patients, it could have consequences for the management of such patients. 
Treatment of systemic vasculitis with pooled intravenous immunoglobulin. The therapeutic effect of a course of high-dose, pooled, intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg) on disease activity and circulating antineutrophil cytoplasm antibodies (ANCA) was investigated in 7 patients with systemic vasculitis. 5 had active disease despite conventional immunosuppression, and 2 had not received any treatment. All 7 had clinical improvement, which was sustained in 6 and transient in 1. The fall in ANCA concentrations to a mean of 51% of the pre-treatment values was maintained during follow-up. C-reactive protein concentration also dropped considerably. IVIg seemed to confer a useful therapeutic effect without adverse reaction. 
Malignant melanoma in transgenic mice. Ocular and cutaneous melanomas arose in new inbred lines of transgenic mice having an integrated recombinant gene comprised of the tyrosinase promoter, expressed in pigment cells, and the simian virus 40 early-region transforming sequences. The tumors were hypomelanotic and were histopathologically similar to corresponding human melanomas. Eye melanomas often originated at a young age, chiefly from the retinal pigment epithelium, also from the choroid, and rarely from the ciliary body. The eye tumors grew aggressively, were highly invasive, and metastasized to local and distant sites. The earliest formation of these tumors was associated with higher copy numbers of the transgene; mice of different single-copy lines varied greatly in age of onset and frequency of eye tumors. Coat pigmentation was reduced in almost all lines, to various extents. Primary skin melanomas arose later and less frequently than eye melanomas. Hence they were at early stages and of unknown long-range incidence in this investigation, in which autopsies covered the first half-year of life. For both ocular and cutaneous melanomas, the transgenic mice offer numerous possibilities for experimental study of mechanisms underlying formation and spread of melanomas. 
Crohn's disease associated with autoimmune neutropenia. We report a 29-year-old woman with a 20-year history of Crohn's disease and neutropenia. Because of repeated complications of Crohn's disease, she has undergone three intestinal resections and also has had recurrent skin abscesses, sinusitis, and pneumonia. Persistent neutropenia has been noted throughout the course of her disease, and antineutrophil antibodies have been detected in her serum and that of her younger brother, who also has Crohn's disease and neutropenia. We discuss autoimmune neutropenia in the context of other autoimmune manifestations of Crohn's disease and speculate as to its possible contributory role in the pathogenesis of Crohn's disease. 
Preferential DNA secondary structure mutagenesis in the lagging strand of replication in E. coli. When present in single-stranded DNA, palindromic or quasi-palindromic sequences have the potential to form complex secondary structures, including hairpins, which may facilitate interstrand misalignment of direct repeats and be responsible for diverse types of replication-based mutations, including deletions, additions, frameshifts and duplications. In regions of palindromic symmetry, specific deletion events may involve the formation of a hairpin or other DNA secondary structures which can stabilize the misalignment of direct repeats. One model suggests that these deletions occur during DNA replication by slippage of the template strand and misalignment with the progeny strand. The concurrent DNA replication model, involving an asymmetric dimeric DNA polymerase III complex which replicates the leading and lagging strands, has significant implications for mutagenesis. The intermittent looping of the lagging strand template, and the fact that the lagging strand template may contain a region of single-stranded DNA the length of an Okazaki fragment, provides an opportunity for DNA secondary-structure formation and misalignment. Here we report our design of a palindromic fragment to create an 'asymmetric palindromic insert' in the chloramphenicol acetyltransferase gene of plasmid pBR325. The frequency with which the insert was deleted in Escherichia coli depends on the orientation of the gene in the plasmid. Our results suggest that replication-dependent deletion between direct repeats may occur preferentially in the lagging strand. 
Endocrine response determines the clinical outcome of pulsatile gonadotropin-releasing hormone ovulation induction in different ovulatory disorders. To accrue systematic information in different ovulatory disorders on the precise relationship among endocrine response, clinical outcome, and the occurrence of complications, we treated 114 patients with pulsatile GnRH (2.5-5.0 micrograms, iv, every 60 min) for 187 cycles and compared them to 20 normal menstrual cycles. Thirty of these patients had primary hypogonadotropic amenorrhea (PHA; 40 cycles), 33 had other forms of hypogonadotropic hypogonadism (HH; 55 cycles), and 51 had polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS; 92 cycles). Daily blood samples were drawn for hormone determinations. In PCOS, 50 cycles were preceded by GnRH analog suppression. PHA treatment cycles were characterized by the reestablishment of a normal endocrine pattern, almost no dose-related endocrine differences, elevated ovulatory (93%) and conception rates (23%), and no multiple pregnancies. In the HH subjects the ovulatory (91%) and pregnancy rates (31%) were high; however, while the lower GnRH dose elicited a normal endocrine pattern, the 5-micrograms dose induced excessive folliculogenesis and high estradiol levels and was associated with most of the multiple pregnancies of this study (three of four). GnRH analog suppression was successfully used to avoid recurrence of ovarian over-stimulation in two HH subjects. Finally, GnRH analog suppression in PCOS permitted normalization of the follicular phase endocrine pattern, achievement of good ovulatory (76%) and pregnancy (28%) rates, and avoidance of multiple pregnancies; however, luteal phase steroid secretion was abnormal, and the abortion rate remained elevated (43%). Obesity was associated with a reduced ovulatory rate in PCOS, but not in hypogonadotropic, subjects. Thus, we can conclude that in pulsatile GnRH ovulation induction: 1) a profound hypogonadotropic condition, whether spontaneous as in PHA or induced with GnRH analogs as in other ovulatory disorders, is associated with optimal menstrual cycle restoration, high ovulatory and conception rates, and virtually absent risks of multiple pregnancy; 2) residual hypothalamic activity in HH may be responsible for supraphysiological pituitary-ovarian stimulation and result in multiple pregnancy unless a low GnRH dose (2.5 micrograms/bolus) or GnRH analog pretreatment is employed; 3) obesity does not affect treatment outcome in hypogonadotropic patients; and 4) the high spontaneous abortion rate in PCOS may be related to corpus luteum dysfunction. 
Symptomatic talocalcaneal coalition. Its clinical significance and treatment. The clinical significance of symptomatic talocalcaneal coalition was described subjectively, objectively, and identified roentgenographically after examining 67 feet of 42 patients between 1977 and 1987. Computed tomographic examinations, conducted on 29 of 42 patients, were useful in recognizing the extent of coalition, the condition of union, and the postoperative results. Tarsal tunnel syndrome was present in 23 feet with the coalition. Thirty-one feet (24 patients) were treated conservatively and 36 feet (29 patients) surgically. Of the surgically treated feet, the coalition was excised in 33 and talocalcaneal fusion was performed in three. Follow-up examinations were performed at an average of 5.3 years (range, 2.25-11.2 years). In the excision group, the results were excellent in 24 feet, good in seven, and fair in two. The results were good in three feet treated by arthrodesis. 
Gallstone formation after rapid weight loss: a prospective study in patients undergoing gastric bypass surgery for treatment of morbid obesity. The present study evaluated the incidence of gallstone formation in 105 morbidly obese patients undergoing rapid weight loss after proximal gastric bypass surgery. Intraoperative ultrasonography demonstrated gallstones in 20 (19%) and gallbladder sludge in four (4%) patients. Eighty-one patients had a normal gallbladder ultrasound. After bariatric surgery, these patients were followed prospectively with periodic gallbladder ultrasound examinations. At 6 months, gallstones had developed in 36% and gallbladder sludge in 13% of patients. These percentages remained relatively constant at 12 and 18 months. Body weight declined rapidly after surgery from a mean of 132.3 kg to 95.5, 87.0, and 84.0 kg at 6, 12, and 18 months, respectively. Gallstones developed significantly more often in the white race, and in women. No significant differences in age, body weight, percent ideal body weight, percent weight loss, or percent of excess body weight lost existed between patients who developed gallstones or sludge and those who did not. Patients who developed gallbladder sludge had less cholesterol and lower cholesterol saturation (1.25 +/- 0.42) in their gallbladder bile than persons who developed gallstones (2.00 +/- 0.79). Forty percent (13/32) of patients who developed gallstones became symptomatic; nine (28%) underwent elective cholecystectomy. An attempt to prevent gallstone formation during rapid weight loss appears warranted. 
HIV-1 propagates in human neuroblastoma cells. A major question in the pathogenesis of AIDS encephalopathy and dementia is whether HIV-1 directly infects cells of the central nervous system (CNS). The propagation of HIV was attempted in six cell lines: three related and three unrelated to the nervous system. HIV was able to propagate in two human neuroblastoma cell lines and a lymphocytic cell line control but did not result in infections of African green monkey kidney cells, human cervix carcinoma cells, and one human brain astrocytoma cell line. Neuroblastoma cell lines infected with HIV showed peaks of reverse transcriptase activity at 10-14 days postinfection. After prolonged growth in cell cultures, one of the neuroblastoma cell lines showed multiphasic virus production, additional high peaks of reverse transcriptase activity, 20-fold greater than the first, lasting from 36 to 74 days and 110 to 140 days postinfection. The presence of HIV was confirmed by p24 antigen capture. The neuroblastoma cell lines had weak but detectable levels of CD4 immunoreactivity by immunoperoxidase and flow immunocytometric analysis. Although no T4-specific RNA sequences were detected by hybridization of Northern blots of total and poly A-selected RNA extracted from the two neuroblastoma cell lines by using a T4 specific complimentary DNA probe, monoclonal antibodies to the CD4 receptor blocked HIV infection in both neuroblastoma cell lines. Thus, the infection of neuroblastoma cells by HIV occurs in part by a CD4-dependent mechanism. Passaging the neuroblastoma cell lines weekly and bimonthly resulted in similar cell cycle-DNA content patterns for the more permissive cell line and with significant numbers of cells in the S phase. HIV-infected neuroblastoma cell lines provide an in vitro model for the evaluation of virus-host cell interactions and may be useful in addressing the issue of the persistence of HIV in the human CNS. 
Patterns in visual interpretation of coronary arteriograms as detected by quantitative coronary arteriography. In part 1 of a three-part study, 14 novice readers and 6 experienced cardiologists interpreted phantom images of known stenosis severity. No difference between the interpretations of experienced and novice readers was detectable. Visual estimates of "moderately" severe stenosis were 30% higher than actual percent diameter stenosis. In part 2 of the study, visual interpretation of percent diameter stenosis from 212 stenoses on 241 arteriograms was compared with quantitative coronary arteriographic assessment. The visual analysis overestimated disease severity in arteries with greater than or equal to 50% diameter stenosis (except for right coronary lesions) and underestimated severity in all arteries with less than 50% diameter stenosis. Of the 241 arteriograms, 40 had quantitative and visual analysis of all three coronary arteries for assessment of significant disease. In only 62% of the cases did visual and quantitative methods agree on the presence of severe disease; visual estimates diagnosed significantly (p less than 0.05) more three-vessel disease. In part 3 of the study, comparison of percent diameter stenosis by visual estimate with quantitative coronary arteriographic assessment before and after balloon angioplasty of 38 stenoses showed that visual interpretation significantly (p less than 0.001) overestimated initial lesion severity and underestimated stenosis severity after angioplasty. 
Stress gastritis revisited. In current ICU populations, overt bleeding from stress gastritis occurs in 10% to 20% of patients. Bleeding rates may be reduced to about 3% in patients receiving prophylactic therapy. Although patients with bleeding have higher mortality rates than other critically ill patients, it is not clear that the mortality rate is improved with prophylactic therapy, as most patients die from their underlying disease. As new complications of prophylactic therapy are identified, better definitions of the population at risk to develop complications of stress gastritis will be necessary to select those patients who will benefit most from prophylactic therapy. 
Changing pattern of pulmonary metastases with adjuvant chemotherapy in patients with osteosarcoma: results from the multiinstitutional osteosarcoma study. The multiinstitutional osteosarcoma study (MIOS), a randomized trial of adjuvant therapy for osteosarcoma with a concurrent control group, registered 113 patients from June 1982 to August 1984. Preliminary analysis of the study indicated a significant event-free survival advantage favoring immediate adjuvant chemotherapy, (P less than .001). For patients treated with surgery alone or with surgery and adjuvant chemotherapy, the lungs were involved in more than 80% of the relapses. Patients relapsing after surgery alone tended to relapse earlier (P less than .01), had more pulmonary nodules (P less than .01), and had more frequent bilateral pulmonary involvement (P less than .01) than those treated with immediate postsurgical adjuvant chemotherapy. However, patients relapsing after treatment with surgery alone experienced a significantly longer interval to further disease progression (P less than .01) and improved survival after relapse (P = .01) when compared with patients who relapsed after treatment with immediate adjuvant chemotherapy. The only factor predictive of survival after relapse was if the patient could be made surgically disease-free after initial relapse (P = .03). 
Prediction of major cardiac events after peripheral vascular surgery using dipyridamole echocardiography. Patients undergoing peripheral vascular surgery are at increased risk of postoperative cardiac complications. To evaluate the role of dipyridamole echocardiography in predicting major cardiac events, 109 unselected patients undergoing elective peripheral vascular surgery were prospectively studied. Preoperative dipyridamole echocardiograms were interpreted by an echocardiographer unaware of all clinical data. Patients were followed up until hospital discharge by research physicians without knowledge of dipyridamole echocardiography results. Outcomes were classified using strict predefined criteria by reviewers unaware of other clinical and echocardiographic data. Of the 109 patients, 9 (8%) had positive studies defined as development of new regional wall motion abnormalities or worsening of preexistent wall motion abnormalities. Of these 9 patients, 7 had postoperative events, including 3 cardiac deaths, 1 nonfatal myocardial infarction, 2 with unstable angina, and 1 with pulmonary edema. Only 1 event occurred among the 100 patients with negative studies. The sensitivity and specificity of dipyridamole echocardiography for predicting cardiac events after vascular surgery were 88 and 98%, respectively; the positive and negative predictive values were 78 and 99%. The relative risk of having a cardiac event if dipyridamole echocardiography was abnormal was 78 (95% confidence interval, 11 to 564; p less than 0.0001). If these results are extended and confirmed by other investigators, preoperative dipyridamole echocardiography may be an important screening test for patients undergoing elective peripheral vascular surgery. 
Value of computed tomography of the lung in the management of primary spontaneous pneumothorax. The treatment of patients with primary spontaneous pneumothorax remains controversial, since recurrence and the ultimate need for thoracostomy cannot be predicted. In the current study, computed tomography (CT) of the lung was performed prospectively on 26 consecutive patients with primary spontaneous pneumothorax to determine whether the size and/or the number of apical blebs would correlate with recurrence and/or need for thoracostomy. Both the number of blebs and the bleb score (calculated by the number of blebs multiplied by a numeric value assigned a range of bleb sizes) of the affected lung was significantly greater in patients with a history of recurrent pneumothorax and/or ultimate need for thoracostomy as treatment. CT of the lung may be useful in predicting the natural history of pneumothorax. 
Intrahepatic recurrence after resection of hepatocellular carcinoma complicating cirrhosis. To determine whether a careful evaluation of tumor extension by preoperative computed tomography scan after intra-arterial injection of ultrafluid lipiodol and by intraoperative ultrasound examination reduced the recurrence rate of hepatocellular carcinoma after resection, a series of 47 cirrhotic patients with a single tumor operated on from 1984 was studied. Alphafetoprotein level was less than 100 ng/mL in 26 patients (55%), size of the tumor was less than 5 cm in 28 patients (59%), and capsule was present in 30 patients (63%). The resection was performed with free margin measuring 1 cm or more. The overall cumulative survival rates at 3 and 5 years were 35% and 17%, respectively. Intrahepatic recurrence was observed in 28 patients (60%), located less than 2 cm from the resection margin in only four patients. The cumulative intrahepatic recurrence rate at 3 years was 81% and was significantly higher in patients with tumor greater than or equal to 5 cm and in patients with preoperative alphafetoprotein level of greater than or equal to 100 ng/mL. In this series the cumulative intrahepatic recurrence rate at 5 years was 100%. This high recurrence rate after resection, even with careful evaluation of tumor extension, indicates that liver transplantation might be envisaged for the treatment of cirrhotic patients with resectable hepatocellular carcinoma. 
Preclinical Parkinson's disease: detection of motor and nonmotor manifestations. The advent of possible protective therapies for Parkinson's disease has created a need for methods of diagnosing the disease before the clinical features become fully evident. As a number of motor and nonmotor manifestations of the disease emerge months to years before a diagnosis can be made, a battery of clinical tests might be sufficient to identify individuals at an earlier stage than is currently possible using the standard history and physical examination. A list of questions regarding possible risk factors, specific symptoms, and observations of family members could be combined in a self-administered questionnaire that might identify individuals with a high probability of early, but otherwise undiagnosable, Parkinson's disease. Identification of subtle motor features is another possible screening method. For example, handwriting and speech are commonly affected prior to diagnosis; thus, automated analysis of these motor actions might also provide detection of incipient disease. 
Heart rate variability in patients with ventricular arrhythmias: effect of antiarrhythmic drugs. Antiarrhythmic Drug Evaluation Group (ADEG). The purpose of this study was to investigate whether heart rate variability could be reliably assessed in patients with ventricular arrhythmias and to evaluate whether it is affected by antiarrhythmic drugs. The study was based on an analysis of 239 ambulatory electrocardiographic (ECG) recordings obtained from 67 patients with frequent and complex ventricular arrhythmias enrolled in the Antiarrhythmic Drug Evaluation Group (ADEG) study. In each recording, after exclusion of premature ventricular complexes, the number of times during a 24 h period in which two consecutive sinus RR intervals differed by more than 50 ms was calculated. The total 24 h count from each recording was then used as an index of heart rate variability. This method is a reliable marker of cardiac parasympathetic activity. Recordings were analyzed at baseline (n = 56), during long-term treatment with amiodarone (n = 17), flecainide (n = 22) or propafenone (n = 17) and after washout in selected patients (n = 5). Despite the presence of a different number of arrhythmias, total 24 h counts in the same patient appeared reproducible over time (r = 0.83 between two different recordings, n = 49, p less than 0.0001). Baseline counts (median 1,698, range 26 to 13,648) were not correlated (r = 0.15) with the number of arrhythmias. The three antiarrhythmic drugs had a disparate effect on total 24 h counts: no change was observed in patients treated with amiodarone (median percent change [delta %]-8, p = NS), whereas a significant (p less than 0.025) decrease occurred in patients treated with flecainide (median delta % -56%) or propafenone (median delta % -64%). 
Blood transfusion and survival after laryngectomy for laryngeal carcinoma. Survival of patients with surgically treated malignancy may be adversely affected by blood transfusion. Immune suppression due to transfusion has been implicated but remains unproven. We conducted a study of 240 patients with squamous cell carcinoma of the larynx undergoing laryngectomy to assess the effect of per-operative blood transfusion on survival. 
Inclusion body myositis with cricopharyngeus muscle involvement and severe dysphagia. A patient with inclusion body myositis (IBM) is presented. Unusual aspects of this case include a myopathy of 36 years duration, severe dysphagia due to cricopharyngeus muscle dysfunction, improvement with cricopharyngeus myotomy, and a diagnostic cricopharyngeus muscle biopsy. 
Apnoea, bradycardia, and oxygen saturation in preterm infants. To analyse the effects of apnoea and bradycardia on the oxygen saturation (SaO2) of preterm infants and to make recommendations for apnoea alarm limits, polygraphic recordings were made on 89 occasions of 27 preterm infants; 1029 apnoeic episodes were analysed. Reduction in SaO2 was positively correlated with duration of apnoea, but the scatter of results was such that reductions in SaO2 of up to 40% occurred with apnoeas of less than 10 seconds duration. The median initial SaO2 was significantly lower in those episodes that resulted in bradycardia (92% compared with 95%), and there was also a significantly greater reduction in median SaO2 (9% compared with 5%). This study illustrates the difficulty of setting alarm limits for the detection of apnoea. We suggest that rather than simply detecting apnoea it is more appropriate to monitor heart rate and SaO2 in infants with recurrent apnoea. 
Visual field changes following hepatic transplantation in a patient with primary biliary cirrhosis. A case of severe visual field restriction complicating primary biliary cirrhosis is described. The clinical features demonstrated vitamin A deficiency which did not respond to oral supplements of vitamin A. Hepatic transplantation restored the visual fields to near normal. 
Repeat infusion of recombinant tissue-type plasminogen activator in patients with acute myocardial infarction and early recurrent myocardial ischemia. When conventional treatment of patients with early clinical reinfarction after thrombolytic therapy fails, mechanical revascularization may be attempted. An alternative strategy, repeat thrombolytic infusions, is reported. Fifty-two patients with acute myocardial infarction were treated with one or two additional thrombolytic infusions of recombinant tissue-type plasminogen activator (rt-PA) because of nonsustained ischemia after initial treatment with rt-PA or streptokinase. Thirty-five patients received the second infusion within 1 h of the first; 13 patients received the second infusion 1 to 72 h after the first and 4 patients received it later during their hospitalization. Bleeding complications occurred in 10 patients (19%); however, most of these were minor (no intracranial bleeding) and only 2 patients required blood transfusion. In 14 patients in whom the decrease in fibrinogen and plasminogen levels was measured after the first and second infusions, this decrease was only 25% and 63%, respectively--only slightly higher than the 22% and 53% decreases measured in 63 patients who had only one rt-PA infusion. In 44 patients (85%), the acute ischemia resolved completely within 1 h after initiation of the second infusion. In 23 patients (44%), pain and ST segment elevation did not recur and invasive coronary intervention was avoided. Thus, repeat rt-PA infusions can stabilize a substantial number of patients with acute reinfarction and, even when relief is temporary, repeat rt-PA infusions can minimize myocardial damage while patients await mechanical revascularization. 
Aortic sepsis: is there a role for in situ graft reconstruction? Conventional extraanatomic reconstruction for aortic sepsis is associated with a significant risk of operative death, as well as frequent late complications. We evaluated in situ aortic grafting in the treatment of primary or graft-related aortic infection. Eleven selected patients underwent in situ aortic graft reconstruction in the setting of mycotic aneurysm (n = 5), secondarily infected aortic aneurysm (n = 1), primary aortoenteric fistula (n = 1), and secondary aortoenteric fistula (n = 4). All patients survived: follow-up from 10 to 130 months reveals no evidence for graft thrombosis, pseudoaneurysm, new or recurrent aortoenteric fistula, or subsequent aortic operations in any patient. A literature review produced 110 cases of aortic sepsis managed by in situ aortic reconstruction during the last decade. Thirty-two patients (29%) either died in the operative period or suffered a lethal late complication associated with their aortic reconstruction. This mortality rate declined to 21% if patients undergoing incomplete removal of a contaminated graft were excluded, and to 19% with the addition of our 11 patients. Both our experience and that described in the literature suggest that, in properly-selected patients, in situ aortic graft replacement may be a rational treatment option for localized or circumscribed aortic sepsis. 
Cardiac tamponade early after thrombolysis for acute myocardial infarction: a rare but not reported hemorrhagic complication. Among 392 consecutive patients admitted for acute myocardial infarction and treated with thrombolytic drugs, 4 patients (1%) developed an early hemorrhagic pericardial effusion (without ventricular wall rupture) evolving within 24 h to cardiogenic shock consequent to cardiac tamponade. They all suffered from a large anterior myocardial infarction treated within 4 h after onset of symptoms with intravenous anisoylated plasminogen streptokinase activator complex (one case), recombinant tissue-type plasminogen activator (rt-PA) (two cases) or streptokinase (one case), anticoagulation with heparin (all cases) and aspirin (three cases). As soon as pericardial effusion was established by echocardiography, emergency percutaneous pericardiocentesis was performed at the bedside 20 +/- 6 h after thrombolytic therapy was started. This corrected immediately the clinical and hemodynamic status of each patient and a catheter was left in the pericardial space for 34 +/- 18 h. Thus, in the presence of unexplained clinical and hemodynamic deterioration occurring during the first 24 h after thrombolytic treatment of a large myocardial infarction, cardiac tamponade should be suspected. Immediate percutaneous pericardiocentesis followed by continuous drainage is a simple and definitive treatment for this complication. 
The GTPase superfamily: a conserved switch for diverse cell functions. Proteins that bind and hydrolyse GTP are being discovered at a rapidly increasing rate. Each of these many GTPases acts as a molecular switch whose 'on' and 'off' states are triggered by binding and hydrolysis of GTP. Conserved structure and mechanism in myriad versions of the switch--in bacteria, yeast, flies and vertebrates--suggest that all derive from a single primordial protein, repeatedly modified in the course of evolution to perform a dazzling variety of functions. 
Cavernosometry: methodology and reproducibility with and without pharmacological agents in the evaluation of venous impotence. Venous impotence can be evaluated by cavernosometry, although this is a controversial issue. We have evaluated various techniques for cavernosometry: with and without intracavernous papaverine, with different dosages and modalities, with different modes of induction flow and at various intracavernous pressures. A standardised technique was tested and retested in 32 impotent men. If pharmacocavernosometry is accepted as the most reliable test and a maintenance flow less than 20 ml/min indicates optimal venous occlusion, plain cavernosometry gave 6% false positive and 16% false negative results. Pharmacocavernosometry was found to be highly reproducible with regard to maintenance flow for patients thought to have optimal venous occlusion and for those with supposed leakage. The induction flow was of no diagnostic value. After injection of papaverine the maintenance flow became a reproducible parameter for quantifying venous outflow and could be measured with an intracavernous pressure equivalent to systolic blood pressure to minimise cavernous arterial inflow and increase reproducibility. 
Immediate postoperative aspirin improves vein graft patency early and late after coronary artery bypass graft surgery. A placebo-controlled, randomized study. BACKGROUND. The efficacy of aspirin for prevention of thrombotic graft occlusion after coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) depends both on the dosage and time window of administration. Early and late graft patency were therefore assessed in a prospective, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial of aspirin, 324 mg daily, given within 1 hour of CABG. METHODS AND RESULTS. Angiographic graft patency was determined at 1 week (231 patients) and 1 year (219 patients) after CABG. The early vein graft occlusion rate was 1.6% on aspirin and 6.2% on placebo (p = 0.004), and late graft occlusion rate was 5.8% on continued aspirin and 11.6% on placebo (p = 0.01). New graft occlusion between 1 week and 1 year was less common in patients on aspirin than on placebo (4.3% versus 7.4%, p = 0.013). The protective effect of aspirin against occlusion persisted in most subgroups of graft type, graft flow, diameter of recipient artery, location of grafted artery, and endarterectomy. Mean chest tube blood loss for the first 24 hours was 571 ml for the aspirin group and 563 ml for the placebo group. Red cell transfusion requirements were 902 ml in the aspirin group and 934 ml in the placebo group (p = NS). The reoperation rate was 4.8% in the aspirin group and 1% in the placebo group (p = 0.1). CONCLUSIONS. Immediate postoperative administration of aspirin (324 mg) improves early graft patency and, with continued usage, protects against further occlusion up to 1 year after CABG. Postoperative blood loss was similar in the two groups; however, aspirin was associated with a nonsignificant higher rate of reoperation. 
An autopsy study of the incidence of lacunes in relation to age, hypertension, and arteriosclerosis. We investigated selected features of lacunes in 1,086 necropsy cases. Lacunes were found in brains from patients above the age of 40 years and were most common in brains from persons in their sixties but decreased in number in brains from older persons. The most common site of lacunes was the frontal lobe white matter, followed by the putamen, pons, parietal lobe white matter, thalamus, and caudate nucleus in descending order of frequency. By dividing the 1,086 cases into three groups according to blood pressure, we found more lacunes in the hypertensive and borderline hypertensive groups than in the normotensive group; the average number of lacunes per brain in each group was 3.61, 2.77, and 1.15, respectively. Diastolic hypertension was more closely related to the number of lacunes than was systolic hypertension. The extent of arteriolosclerosis of the medullary arteries in the frontal lobe white matter was measured and compared with the number of lacunes. There was a close correlation between lacunes and arterioloslerosis in all age groups. 
Gonadotropin-secreting pineal teratoma causing precocious puberty. A case of precocious puberty in a 7-year-old boy with a tumor of the pineal region is reported. Human chorionic gonadotropin levels were elevated in the serum and cerebrospinal fluid. Endocrinological evaluation of the hypothalamic-pituitary axis demonstrated a normal prepubertal response. The tumor was resected and proved to be an immature teratoma. Human chorionic gonadotropin levels were markedly elevated in the tumor cyst fluid. Sexual precocity regressed and human chorionic gonadotropin levels in the serum and cerebrospinal fluid fell to normal after surgery, suggesting that the precocious puberty was secondary to ectopic human chorionic gonadotropin production by the pineal teratoma. 
Paroxysmal tremor and orofacial dyskinesia secondary to a biopterin synthesis defect. We report a child with a systemic biopterin synthesis defect due to an absence of 6-pyruvoyl-tetrahydropterin synthase who had an unusual presentation, with three episodes of coarse "rubral-like" tremor in arms and legs orofacial dyskinesia between the ages of 3 and 6 months. Response to levodopa therapy and CSF neurotransmitter metabolite concentrations before and after therapy suggests that his clinical syndrome resulted from a secondary dopamine deficiency. 
Stenoses of vascular anastomoses after hepatic transplantation: treatment with balloon angioplasty. Vascular complications after liver transplantation include occlusion or stenosis at the sites of anastomosis in the hepatic artery, portal vein, and vena cava. From our experience with more than 600 liver transplants, vascular stenoses have been identified in 10 patients and treated by balloon angioplasty in nine. Three patients with hepatic artery stenosis and deteriorating graft function were treated by balloon angioplasty with a coaxial technique. A specially designed catheter facilitated a successful femoral artery approach. Portal vein stenoses in three patients resulted in portal hypertension. These were treated by balloon dilatation via transhepatic catheterization of the portal vein. Stenoses of the suprahepatic caval anastomosis were dilated in three patients with severe lower limb edema. Technical success was achieved in all three cases of hepatic artery stenosis with improvement in graft function. Recurrent stenoses in two patients were successfully treated with repeated dilatations. Portal hypertension resolved in two of three patients after portal venoplasty. Dilatation of a caval stenosis resulted in the resolution of leg edema in all three cases. Repeated dilatation was required in one case. No reduction in the portal venous pressure gradient occurred after venoplasty in one case, and an ultimately fatal caval thrombosis developed in one patient with caval stenosis before venoplasty could be performed. Our experience suggests that balloon angioplasty of arterial and venous stenoses complicating hepatic transplantation carries little risk and is a useful procedure for the treatment of these problems. 
Superior vena caval obstruction in patients with gut failure receiving home parenteral nutrition. Clinical suspicion and venographic conformation were used to diagnose 15 cases of superior vena caval obstruction (SVCO) in 107 home parenteral nutrition (HPN) patients over 379 cumulative years of HPN (3.9 cases/100 patient-years). Patients with SVCO had been on HPN a mean of 51.5 months and had used 6.2 (range 1-50) central catheters, including short- and long-term, before SVCO was diagnosed. The frequency of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) with SVCO was approximately the same as that in our general HPN population. Positive blood cultures were present immediately preceding the diagnosis of SVCO in 40% (six of 15) of cases. Atypical line placements were noted in two cases. The most common management strategies employed were conversion to enteral feedings in five patients and placement of a new catheter directly into the right atrium by thoracotomy in another five patients. Two of the five with right atrial catheters experienced a postpericardiotomy syndrome (fever, pericardial rub, and pulmonary infiltrates) that responded promptly to indomethacin. The most significant long-term sequela of SVCO was the need for a left jugular vein to right atrial appendage bypass in one patient with chronic venous congestion from her SVCO. Once the SVCO is confirmed, systemic heparinization provides immediate antithrombotic effect and minimizes the risk of pulmonary embolism. The use of streptokinase may result in rapid thrombolysis. 
The spectrum of vertical gaze palsy following unilateral brainstem stroke. A single unilateral lesion, near the midline, may interrupt the pathways involved in vertical gaze just before and after they decussate, inducing an anatomically unilateral, but functionally bilateral, lesion. We report 11 patients with supranuclear vertical gaze palsies (two with conjugate upgaze palsy, four with combined up- and downgaze palsies, two with monocular elevation palsy, and three with vertical "one-and-a-half" syndrome) due to unilateral midbrain strokes. 
Lung asbestos fiber content and mesothelioma cell type, site, and survival. All ascertainable cases of malignant mesothelioma in Australia were notified to a national surveillance program in the period January 1, 1980 to December 31, 1985. There were 854 cases obtained and 823 confirmed on clinical (77) or histologic (746) ground. Tumor site was known in 759 cases (685 pleural and 74 peritoneal). Lung fiber content analyses by light microscopy and analytic transmission electron microscopy with energy-dispersive x-ray analysis were done on 226 cases in which postmortem material was available, using the method of Rogers. Cell type was determined by a five-member expert panel of pathologists appointed by the Royal College of Pathologists of Australasia. There was a statistically significant trend between lung fiber content (fibers/g dry lung) and cell type from epithelial (low fiber content) through mixed to sarcomatous (high fiber content). This trend was most apparent for total uncoated fibers (chi-square = 6.8, df = 1, P less than 0.01) and crocidolite (chi-square = 6.7, df = 1, P less than 0.01). Lung fiber content also was associated with tumor site; higher lung fiber content being associated with peritoneal tumors. This relationship was significant for all fiber content measures except chrysotile and was independent of the fiber content-cell type relationship (log-linear analysis). Survival from time of provisional diagnosis was significantly longer for epithelial (mean, 13 months; standard deviation [SD], 12.8) and mixed (mean, 10.2 months; SD, 8.7) types than sarcomatous cell types (mean, 5.8 months; SD, 6.5; P less than 0.0001, by analysis of variance on log10 survival time). Survival time was significantly greater for pleural tumors (mean, 11.4 months; SD, 13.4) than peritoneal tumors (mean, 8.6 months; SD, 12.5) (P less than 0.005, by Student's t test on log10 survival time). 
Rates of vertebral bone loss before and after liver transplantation in women with primary biliary cirrhosis. Atraumatic fractures caused by osteoporosis may be a serious complication of primary biliary cirrhosis. Mean (+/- S.D.) bone mineral density in the lumbar spine in 210 ambulatory women with primary biliary cirrhosis was 1.02 +/- 0.19 gm/cm2, 7% lower than that in 139 age-matched normal women (after adjustment for age and body weight) (p less than 0.001). Bone mineral density in the lumbar spine was inversely related to a risk score index of liver disease severity (r = -0.29, p less than 0.001). The mean rate of bone loss in 105 of these 210 women was 2%/yr +/- 4%/yr, twice as great as in the 139 normal women (p less than 0.02). In 20 women with primary biliary cirrhosis followed up after orthotopic liver transplantation, bone mineral density in the lumbar spine decreased at 3 mo (p less than 0.01), and this decrease may have resulted in atraumatic fractures in 13 of them. Bone mineral density in the lumbar spine then increased (p less than 0.01) so that by 12 mo the median bone mineral density in the lumbar spine was similar to that before transplantation and by 24 mo it was 5% above it. Therefore we conclude that the progressive bone loss observed in primary biliary cirrhosis (which is further accentuated immediately after transplantation) may be halted, and the bone mass may be restored toward normal within 2 to 3 yr after orthotopic liver transplantation. 
Association of leptomeningeal carcinomatosis in carcinoma of the breast with infiltrating lobular carcinoma. An autopsy study. We analyzed the autopsy records of 261 patients with breast carcinoma, who died at The Institute of Oncology, Ljubljana, Yugoslavia, for the presence of metastases to the central nervous system, particularly for the presence of leptomeningeal carcinomatosis. Metastases to the central nervous system were found in 41 (18.1%) of 226 patients who had metastatic cancer. In 24 cases (10.6%), metastases were seen in brain parenchyma; in 11 cases (4.9%), only dura mater was involved, and in six cases (2.6%), leptomeningeal carcinomatosis was found. All patients with leptomeningeal carcinomatosis showed some symptoms of central nervous system involvement while alive. The patients died between 2 weeks and 2 months after the onset of central nervous system symptoms. Four of six patients with such a complication presented with locally advanced or disseminated carcinoma on the first admission. With regard to histologic findings, three patients had infiltrating lobular carcinoma, two had infiltrating ductal carcinoma, and one had mixed infiltrating lobular and ductal carcinoma, with a metastasizing lobular component. Metastases to the brain parenchyma were found exclusively in infiltrating ductal carcinoma. We stress that infiltrating lobular carcinoma represents a distinctive type of breast cancer with an unusual propensity to disseminate into leptomeninges, as this occurred in almost 14% of all cases of infiltrating lobular carcinoma in our series in contrast to a 1% incidence in cases of infiltrating ductal carcinoma. 
Primary anetoderma associated with a wide spectrum of autoimmune abnormalities. Although the underlying pathologic mechanisms of primary anetoderma have not yet been identified, data suggest the participation of an immunologic mechanism in some cases. In a woman with clinical and histopathologic features of primary anetoderma (Jadassohn-Pellizzari type) of 30 years' duration, laboratory investigation disclosed positive antinuclear factor, hypocomplementemia, hypergammaglobulinemia, granular deposits of immunoreactants along the dermoepidermal junction, and fibrillar deposits in the papillary dermis. In addition, she was found to have autoimmune hemolysis and circulating lupus anticoagulant associated with recurrent deep-vein thrombosis and a history of Graves' disease (starting 5 years after onset of primary anetoderma). To our knowledge, none of the latter three autoimmune conditions has been previously associated with primary anetoderma. 
Value of ultrasound in differentiating causes of persistent vomiting in infants. A prospective study of abdominal ultrasound was undertaken in 100 consecutive infants who presented with a history of persistent vomiting aged 5 to 90 days. Each infant had a 'test feed' followed by an ultrasonographic scan of the pylorus at the cotside. On test feeding a palpable tumour was evident in 38 infants. On real time ultrasound using the criteria for diagnosing pyloric stenosis, these 38 infants as well as six others were documented as having pyloric stenosis. In the other 56 patients the vomiting settled in six and a barium examination was performed on the remaining 50. This confirmed gastro-oesophageal reflux in 46, two of whom had an associated hiatus hernia, one with a duodenal malrotation, and three were reported as normal. Ultrasound of the abdomen is an accurate, reliable, and rapid screening method to differentiate the causes of severe vomiting in infancy. 
Factors affecting the patency of stents in malignant biliary obstructive disease: univariate and multivariate analysis. To investigate the factors affecting the patency of biliary stents, we performed univariate and multivariate analyses in 370 straight stents with diameters of 10- to 12-French gauge which had been inserted singly as palliative treatment in 228 patients with malignant biliary obstructive disease. In the analysis of 226 first stents, advanced age of patients and higher serum bilirubin levels before insertion were found to be significant unfavorable factors limiting the duration of stent function. Overall, older age, male sex, no stent cleaning, and insertion on three or more occasions were significant unfavorable prognostic factors for patency. The risk of occlusion for stents inserted on three or more occasions was 2.32 times that of the first stent insertion. The median duration of patency of first, second, and subsequent stents was 177, 98, and 97 days, respectively. Diagnosis and the area of stenosis were unrelated to patency. No predictive significance of length or size of stent between 10- and 12-French gauge was found in our study. 
Biological significance of tissue plasminogen activator content in brain tumors. Fresh brain-tumor samples were obtained at operation and analyzed for their content of tissue type plasminogen activator (tPA) using an activity assay (gel chromatography zymogram) and an enzyme-linked immunospecific assay. The specimens were taken from 23 glioblastomas, 35 metastatic tumors, 42 meningiomas, 16 low-grade gliomas, and seven acoustic neurinomas; seven specimens were from normal brain. A strong correlation was found between the results of the two assays (r = 0.77, p less than 0.0001). There was a threefold difference in the tPA content of the benign tumors as compared to malignant tumors (p = 0.0006), the latter having less tPA. Histologically benign meningiomas contained higher tPA than malignant meningiomas (p = 0.01); however, the difference between low-grade gliomas and high-grade gliomas was less evident. Overall regression analysis data have shown an inverse relationship between the tissue content in tPA and the presence and degree of tumor necrosis and peritumoral brain edema (p = 0.004 and p = 0.0004, respectively). This finding was most consistent in the glioblastoma group where the correlation coefficient values were r = 0.53 and r = -0.55, respectively. There was no significant correlation between the tissue tPA content and the age and sex, steroid use, or plasma tPA of the patients or the duration of symptoms. In summary, this is the first demonstration of tPA in a large series of human brain tumors and in normal brain. The differences observed have clear biological significance and, although the source of tPA in tumor tissue is still unknown, a relative reduction in tPA in tumor tissue may play an integral role in the development of tissue necrosis and tissue edema. The lack of tPA in tumor necrosis was not due to tissue destruction and cell death since urokinase was readily detectable in that tissue. 
Does selective decontamination of the gastrointestinal tract prevent multiple organ failure? An experimental study. Gut bacteria have been incriminated as causing or contributing to generalized sepsis with multiple organ failure in severely ill patients, and selective decontamination of the gastrointestinal tract of Enterobacteriaceae has been claimed to decrease septic complications in these patients. We studied the effects of selective decontamination of the gastrointestinal tract on survival and organ function in an experimental model of sepsis with multiple organ failure. Wistar rats were inoculated intraperitoneally with zymosan and randomized into control or treatment groups (trimethoprim or streptomycin sulfate). Selective decontamination effectively prevented bacterial translocation of Enterobacteriaceae. However, only early mortality was decreased, and only so in the streptomycin-treated rats. Selective decontamination did not result in a significantly better condition of the surviving animals on day 12. 
Polycystic ovaries: do these represent a specific endocrinopathy? Serum pituitary gonadotrophins, oestradiol, testosterone and insulin pulse patterns were examined at 15-min intervals for 6 h in 40 women with a previous diagnosis of polycystic ovarian disease (PCO) based on clinical, endocrinological and ultrasound data. Age, duration of symptoms, body mass index (BMI) and ovarian volume showed no correlation with the 6-h mean value of any hormone and testosterone blood levels did not correlate with those of insulin. Some patients had high and others low LH pulse pattern components, and few had an inverted LH:FSH ratio. Morphological polycystic ovarian changes may be a reflection of various rather than a single pattern of gonadotrophin secretion. 
Autonomic nervous system dysregulation in human hypertension. An increased sympathetic drive combined with decreased parasympathetic inhibition is found in patients with borderline hypertension, who characteristically have rapid heart rates, high cardiac output and relatively normal vascular resistance (hyperkinetic state). In established hypertension, cardiac output is normal, vascular resistance is elevated and signs of increased sympathetic drive are absent. Apparently hemodynamics and sympathetic drive change during hypertension. The mechanism of the hemodynamic transition in the course of hypertension is well understood. Cardiac output returns from elevated to normal values as beta-adrenergic receptors down-regulate and stroke volume decreases (due to decreased cardiac compliance). The high blood pressure induces vascular hypertrophy, which in turn leads to increased vascular resistance. The mechanism of the change of sympathetic tone from elevated in borderline hypertension to apparently normal in established hypertension can best be explained within the conceptual framework of the "blood-pressure-seeking" properties of the brain. In hypertension, the central nervous system seeks to maintain systemic blood pressure at the higher level. As hypertension advances and vascular hypertrophy develops, arterioles become hyperresponsive to vasoconstriction. At this point, less sympathetic drive is needed to maintain pressure-elevating vasoconstriction, and the central sympathetic drive is down-regulated. The etiology of increased sympathetic drive in hypertension remains unresolved. Subjects with increased sympathetic drive are also usually overweight and have elevated levels of insulin, cholesterol and triglycerides, as well as decreased high-density lipoproteins. Future research must focus on the link between coronary risk factors and sympathetic overactivity in hypertension. 
Miller-Dieker syndrome with ring chromosome 17. A girl presented at 6 weeks of age with failure to thrive and arching of the back. She had various dysmorphic features, hepatosplenomegaly, and developmental delay. The electroencephalogram and cranial ultrasound were abnormal, and a computed tomogram showed lissencephaly and apparent agenesis of the corpus callosum. Because of frequent aspiration she became oxygen dependent. She later developed intractable convulsions and died at the age of 9 months. 
Cost-effectiveness analysis of paramedic emergency medical services in the treatment of prehospital cardiopulmonary arrest. STUDY OBJECTIVES: 1) Identification of marginal costs associated with prehospital resuscitation of cardiopulmonary arrest; 2) Determination of cost effectiveness for such resuscitation; and 3) Comparison of cost effectiveness of paramedic care with selected other medical interventions. DESIGN: Retrospective review of 190 cases of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest. SETTING: City limits of a midsized southwestern city. The events studied took place outside of medical facilities. TYPE OF PARTICIPANTS: Victims of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest for whom the EMS system was activated by a 911 telephone request for emergency medical assistance. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: The cost, including training, personnel, equipment, and response time maintenance, per year of life saved was found to be $8,886.00 for paramedic care. This result was compared with published cost-effectiveness figures for heart transplantation, liver transplantation, bone marrow transplantation, and chemotherapy for acute leukemia. Paramedic care was more cost effective, as measured by cost per year of life saved, than organ transplantation and chemotherapy for acute leukemia. CONCLUSION: Out-of-hospital treatment by paramedics of cardiopulmonary arrest is more cost effective than heart, liver, bone marrow transplantation, or curative chemotherapy for acute leukemia. 
The arrhythmogenicity of theophylline. A multivariate analysis of clinical determinants. OBJECTIVE: to determine the relation of serum theophylline concentrations (STC) to the occurrence of cardiac arrhythmias in a population of hospitalized patients. STUDY DESIGN: A cross-sectional study of 100 patients receiving theophylline who had electrocardiograms at the time STC had been obtained. Categorization was based on STC without knowledge of clinical status: group 1 (25) had STC less than 2.5 mg/L; group 2 (25), STC greater than or equal to 2.5 less than 10 (6.2 +/- 0.4) mg/L; group 3 (25), STC greater than or equal to 10 less than or equal to 20 (15.8 +/- 0.4) mg/L; and group 4 (25), STC greater than 20 (27.8 +/- 1.1) mg/L. SETTING: A university-affiliated teaching hospital. RESULTS: Two-thirds of the patients were receiving theophylline in an oral form, with a similar distribution found in all groups. Groups were not different with respect to age, clinical diagnoses, electrocardiographic patterns, arterial pH or gases, serum calcium, or treatment with beta-agonists. Although fewer patients in group 1 were receiving steroids than those in the other groups, and serum potassium was lower in group 3 than in group 1 (4.0 +/- 0.6 vs 4.5 +/- 0.5 mEq/L, p less than 0.05), on multivariate analysis, serum potassium was not an independent predictor of arrhythmia, and treatment with steroids or digoxin was, at most, only weakly associated with the presence of arrhythmia. Heart rate was directly related to STC (r = 0.64, p less than 0.01), and STC was the strongest independent predictor of arrhythmia in this population. Although only 20 percent of patients in group 1 or 2 had arrhythmias, 48 percent of group 3 (p less than 0.05) and 56 percent of group 4 (p less than 0.05) had this finding. Moreover, the odds ratio of group 3 having an arrhythmia compared with group 1 was 3.7, 1.5 to 11.7, p less than 0.01. Multifocal atrial tachycardia was found in 8 percent of the patients in group 3 and 16 percent in group 4 but in none of the patients in groups 1 or 2. Two patients with multifocal atrial tachycardia died suddenly within 24 hours of having their STC measurement; none had concomitant ventricular ectopy. CONCLUSION: Theophylline causes tachycardia and serious arrhythmias even at STC considered to be therapeutic. Multifocal atrial tachycardia, an arrhythmia associated with use of this drug, may herald sudden cardiac death. 
Fourth branchial pouch sinus: diagnosis and treatment. The fourth branchial pouch sinus (FBPS) is a rare translaryngeal anomaly with diverse manifestations, including neonatal stridor and recurrent deep neck infection. Review of the world literature reveals 23 reports of sinuses consistent with fourth pouch origin. We present two additional cases, including the only example of a right-sided FBPS. Retrograde excision, beginning at the piriform apex, ensures complete removal of the tract and protection of the recurrent nerve. The posterior border of the thyroid ala must be resected or retracted for adequate exposure. Failure to remove the translaryngeal portion of the tract almost guarantees recurrence. 
Suprascapular nerve entrapment. A series of 27 cases. Suprascapular nerve entrapment is an acquired neuropathy secondary to compression of the nerve in the bony suprascapular notch. A series of 27 cases, the largest reported to date, is presented and examined as to the best and most appropriate method of diagnosis and treatment. The entity is described in detail as to its origin, anatomy, and pathophysiology. 
Acute effects of ethanol on cultured myocardial cells: an ultrastructural study. Myocardial cells in monolayer culture were examined ultrastructurally at various times (5 min-24 hr) after addition of ethanol (12.5-500 mM). At 5 min, all concentrations of ethanol induced mitochondrial fusion and a remarkable increase in glycogen granules, and the mitochondrial outer membrane seemed more fragile. These initial ultrastructural changes then recovered with time. Glycogen granules were decreased, then returned to normal more rapidly as the ethanol concentration was increased. Mitochondrial fusion and fragile appearance of the outer membrane were hardly seen at 1 hr in the presence of 12.5 or 50 mM ethanol, but were still evident with higher ethanol concentrations (200 and 500 mM), though less frequently than at 5 and 30 min. Furthermore, 'giant mitochondria' (with at least a five-fold increase in sectional area) appeared in the presence of 200 and 500 mM ethanol with increasing time of exposure. These results are discussed in relation to the direct effects of ethanol. 
Effect of diphtheria-tetanus-pertussis immunization on prolonged apnea or bradycardia in siblings of sudden infant death syndrome victims. To determine whether the incidence of apnea or bradycardia increased after the first diphtheria-tetanus-pertussis (DTP) immunization in 100 subsequent siblings of victims of sudden infant death syndrome, we examined data obtained from floppy disk recordings attached to apnea-bradycardia monitors for episodes of apnea lasting 15 seconds or longer and episodes of bradycardia lasting 10 seconds or longer. The data were divided into three periods: (1) 10 days before the first DTP immunization was received (pre-DTP period), (2) 10 days immediately after the DTP (DTP period), and (3) 10 days after the DTP period (post-DTP period). Seventeen infants had at least one episode of prolonged apnea or prolonged bradycardia either before or after the 30-day study period (eight before only, eight after only, and one before and after). None of the infants had episodes of apnea lasting 15 seconds or more or bradycardia lasting 10 seconds or more during the pre-DTP or DTP period. One episode of apnea, 16 seconds long, and one episode of bradycardia lasting 11 seconds occurred in the post-DTP period. These results failed to confirm the clinical impression that DTP immunizations are associated with an increased frequency and severity of prolonged apnea. They also place in question the utility of assessing an infant's response to a DTP immunization to determine continued risk of apnea and bradycardia before home monitoring is discontinued. 
Kikuchi-Fujimoto syndrome during pregnancy. Necrotizing lymphadenitis of the Kikuchi-Fujimoto type developed in our patient during her first trimester of pregnancy, but she carried the infant to full term with no apparent adverse effect. Two subsequent pregnancies were not associated with reactivation of the disorder, nor with any recognizable adverse effect on the fetuses. A pregnancy should not be terminated because of Kikuchi-Fujimoto necrotizing lymphadenitis when it develops during the first trimester of pregnancy. 
Management of valvular heart disease: an illustrative cases approach. As indicated by the 22 illustrative cases included in this monograph, a stepwise approach to the assessment of valvular heart disease provides the information necessary to make good clinical decisions. The ECG and chest x-ray add useful information to the history and physical examination. Echocardiography, Doppler, and color flow Doppler techniques have an important role in defining the presence and severity of valvular stenosis and regurgitation. Nuclear techniques provide useful information about global biventricular systolic function, regional wall motion, and myocardial perfusion. Exercise testing is most valuable in confirming objectively the patient's functional status and exercise tolerance. Newer imaging techniques, such as cine CT and MRI, are capable of displaying and measuring cardiac chamber size and myocardial thickness; however, visualization of the cardiac valves and demonstration of flow abnormalities are difficult, limiting the current usefulness of these techniques in patients with valvular heart disease. 
Color Doppler ultrasound imaging in iatrogenic arterial injuries. Pulsatile masses following arterial puncture for diagnostic or therapeutic procedures may represent false aneurysms or noncommunicating periarterial hematomas with transmitted arterial pulsation. Color Doppler ultrasound imaging was used in 27 patients with pulsatile groin masses. Of these 27 patients, 23 were diagnosed as having pseudoaneurysms and 5 as having periarterial hematomas. The pseudoaneurysms were confirmed at surgical exploration, and the periarterial hematomas were all observed longitudinally with spontaneous resolution. With a sensitivity of 100% and a specificity of 100% in this clinical study, color Doppler ultrasound imaging appears to be the diagnostic modality of choice for detecting false aneurysms following transarterial procedures, obviating the need for additional invasive diagnostic procedures. 
Diagnostic problems in tissues previously sampled by fine-needle aspiration. Unusual tissue changes in needle tracts after fine-needle aspiration were studied in two specimens. One specimen, a 3.0 x 2.5 cm mesenteric nodule, was found six days after a nondiagnostic transabdominal fine-needle aspiration of a retroperitoneal mass. At frozen-section examination, the nodule had proliferating spindle-shaped cells interspersed with adipocytes that raised the possibility of well-differentiated liposarcoma. On permanent sections, however, there was fat necrosis and reactive spindle-shaped cells that immunohistochemically were consistent with myofibroblasts. In the second case, a needle tract was noted in breast tissue on which a biopsy was performed two days after a cytologic diagnosis of carcinoma. The 0.4-mm-wide tract contained neutrophils, foamy histiocytes, and clumps of intact, atypical epithelial cells without a desmoplastic or elastotic component. Aside from these epithelial cells, nothing in the biopsy specimen suggested invasive carcinoma. The cells were identical to those from a comedocarcinoma present in the biopsy and mastectomy specimens. These two cases provide examples of pitfalls that may arise during the examination of biopsy specimens obtained after fine-needle aspiration. 
Intestinal obstruction during shigellosis: incidence, clinical features, risk factors, and outcome. To determine the incidence and outcome of intestinal obstruction during shigellosis, the authors assessed 1211 consecutive patients with shigellosis admitted during a 15-month period to a diarrhea treatment center in Dhaka, Bangladesh. Obstruction was identified in 30 (2.5%) patients. Ten (33.3%) of these patients died, compared with 97 (8.2%) of the 1181 patients without obstructions (P less than 0.001; RR = 4.1). In a case-control study, patients with obstructions were compared with 30 control patients with shigellosis but without obstructions. Case and control patients were similar in age (median, 18 months vs. 24 months; NS). Before admission to the hospital, case patients had less often been breast-fed than control patients (33% vs. 85%; P = 0.006) and had more often received antimicrobial agents (53% vs. 13%; P = 0.001). Case patients more often had abdominal tenderness (73% vs. 13%; P less than 0.001), altered consciousness (50% vs. 17%; P = 0.006), and Shigella dysenteriae type 1 infection (73% vs. 27%, P = 0.001) and had a higher median blood leukocyte count (40 x 10(3)/microL vs. 14 x 10(3)/microL; P = 0.007) and serum potassium concentration (5.0 mmol/L vs. 4.3 mmol/L; P = 0.016), and lower median serum sodium (123 mmol/L vs. 131 mmol/L; P = 0.003) and total protein (52 g/L vs. 60 g/L; P = 0.025) concentrations than did control patients. Eight (27%) patients with obstructions developed the hemolytic-uremic syndrome, compared with none of the control patients (P = 0.003). It was concluded that obstruction is an ominous complication of shigellosis and that therapies in addition to provision of antimicrobial agents need to be evaluated. 
Reviewing oral leukoplakia: clinical concepts for the 1990s. Microscopic evidence of dysplasia is not necessary to diagnose leukoplakia. Rather leukoplakia is clinically diagnosed not so much by defining appearances as by excluding other lesions also appearing as oral white plaques. 
The dyad symmetry element is the molecular target for c-fos induction and inhibition during K 562 differentiation along mutually exclusive lineages. The c-fos proto-oncogene seems to play an important role during differentiation and activation of cells from the hematopoietic lineage. Therefore, it is of interest to investigate the mechanism underlying its transcriptional activation in these cells. To delineate the sequences and factors involved in c-fos transcriptional activation during the course of myeloid cell differentiation, we have used the K 562 chronic leukemic cell line as a model. K 562 cells were transfected with chloramphenicol transacetylase (CAT) reporter constructs, including various regions of the human c-fos promoter, and induced to differentiate by two distinct agents: 12-O-tetradecanoyl phorbol-13-acetate (TPA), which activates a differentiation program along the megakaryoblastic pathway; and hemin, which induces erythroid differentiation. We show here that TPA treatment of K 562 cells induces fos CAT reporter constructs activation, whereas treatment with hemin does not. Furthermore, predifferentiation of the cells with hemin blocks a subsequent induction by TPA, in correlation with the inhibition by hemin of megakaryoblastic differentiation markers appearance. Both the induction by TPA and the inhibition by hemin are mediated by a dyad symmetry element (DSE) located in the upstream regulatory region, between -318 and -296. These results suggest that the protein complex binding to the DSE regulatory element is the target for c-fos activation by TPA and inhibition by hemin in K 562 cells. However, no modulation of protein affinity for the DSE sequence was detected by gel shift assay during the course of induction or inhibition, suggesting that the structural change responsible for the transcriptional modulation is too unstable or too subtle to be detected by this method. 
Proliferation of endocrine cells in the rat stomach caused by drug-induced achlorhydria. Time-related changes of serum gastrin levels, gastrin cell, and enterochromaffinlike cell densities, and proliferation kinetics of these cells have been examined in rats during treatment with the substituted benzimidazole BY 308 over a period of 73 days. Serum gastrin levels increased very rapidly from 74 +/- 6 pg/mL (controls) to 438 +/- 31 pg/mL (day 1) and 727 +/- 68 pg/mL (day 4). Thereafter, a steady increase was observed until day 70 (2097 +/- 208 pg/mL). Enterochromaffinlike cell density was unchanged until day 10, but then increased progressively without reaching a plateau (144% above control on day 73). The labeling index of these cells was enhanced shortly after drug application and remained on a constant elevated level from day 14 to day 73 (about 10-fold to 12-fold above controls from day 14 to day 70). The number of gastrin cells increased rapidly within the first week and reached a plateau after 17 days (96% increase above controls). In contrast to enterochromaffinlike cells, the labeling index did not change immediately but increased on day 7 by 37% and returned beneath control values after day 28. The results suggest that in drug-induced achlorhydria, the progressive increase of enterochromaffinlike cells is explained by an enhanced mitosis, whereas other factors in addition to proliferation are responsible for the augmentation of gastrin cells. 
Thoracoabdominal aneurysm resection after previous infrarenal abdominal aortic aneurysmectomy. Thoracoabdominal aneurysms in 51 patients were repaired over 5 years ending in February 1991. Fourteen (27%, 14 of 51) patients had a prior infrarenal aneurysm resection (PRA); their data are analyzed separately. The average age of patients who had undergone PRA was 67 years (range: 56 to 86 years). The mean aneurysm diameter was 8.6 cm (range: 5 to 12 cm), and the mean time interval between initial aneurysm surgery and subsequent resection of the thoracoabdominal aneurysm was 8.5 years (range: 2 to 17 years). Three patients in the PRA group were operated on emergently, two because of clinical evidence of rupture; the other patients underwent elective repair. Early mortality (30 days) in the PRA group was significantly related to age (72 years or older versus younger than 72 years: 75% versus 10%, p = 0.04), proximal extent of aneurysm (above diaphragm versus below diaphragm: 50% versus 0%, p = 0.05), ruptured aneurysm (ruptured versus nonruptured: 100% versus 16%, p = 0.06), and a cardiac history of myocardial infarction (57% versus 0%, p = 0.03), congestive heart failure (66% versus 0%, p = 0.01), or arrhythmia (80% versus 0%, p = 0.005). Similar results were seen with the entire group of patients with thoracoabdominal aneurysms except that the proximal extent of the aneurysm was not related to mortality. These results demonstrate that thoracoabdominal aneurysm resection after prior infrarenal aneurysmectomy is not associated with increased mortality or morbidity. 
The pathogenic role of antineutrophil cytoplasmic autoantibodies. Antineutrophil cytoplasmic autoantibodies (ANCA) are found in the sera of patients with systemic necrotizing vasculitis and glomerulonephritis. Their role in the pathogenesis of these diseases is not clearly understood; however, there is a growing body of data that supports a pathogenic function for these antibodies. In vitro they can activate neutrophils and monocytes to produce reactive oxygen species (ROS), degranulate, and damage target cells. The antigens to which they are directed stimulate T lymphocytes from patients with these diseases. The ANCA directed against proteinase 3 (PR3) may also play a role in growth regulation of monocytes by inactivating the enzymatic function of its antigen. The proposed model of ANCA-induced disease takes into account both the in vitro data and the natural history of these diseases. 
Haemodynamic effects and outcome analysis of hypotensive extradural anaesthesia in controlled hypertensive patients undergoing total hip arthroplasty. We have examined the safety of induced hypotension produced by extradural anaesthesia in patients with medically controlled hypertension. The haemodynamic response to induced hypotension was assessed in 38 non-hypertensive and 31 controlled hypertensive patients. All received extradural anaesthesia to T4 or above which decreased mean arterial pressure to 52 mm Hg and 55 mm Hg in normotensive and hypertensive patients, respectively. Cardiac output (thermodilution) was maintained by low dose i.v. infusions of adrenaline (1-5 micrograms min-1). No differences in the haemodynamic response to induced hypotension were observed in hypertensive patients. Data were collected also from 987 consecutive patients (353 hypertensive and 634 non-hypertensive) undergoing total hip replacement. Patients with hypertension were significantly older (68 vs 60 yr; P less than 0.001) and had greater ASA ratings (P less than 0.001). The smallest recorded systolic pressures were reduced more in patients with hypertension (57% vs 52%, respectively; P less than 0.001). The mean duration of maintained intraoperative hypotension (100 and 98 min) and estimated intraoperative blood loss (278 vs 281 ml) were similar in each group. After operation, two patients developed myocardial infarctions. None developed acute renal failure or stroke. There were three deaths; one of a patient who had hypertension. This suggests that induced hypotension with extradural anaesthesia is a safe technique for patients with medically controlled hypertension undergoing total hip arthroplasty. 
Rare choroidal tumour simulating a malignant melanoma. A 15-year-old boy had been treated for a central chorioretinitis of his right eye. The other eye had always been normal. Two years later he presented a relapse with deterioration of central visual acuity. All clinical tests, including fluorescein angiography, suggested an inflammatory process this time again. Thereafter, the patient did not show up for 6 years. Then he came to hospital because of strong pains in his right eye. Now, a blind and inflamed eye was found with a huge tumour from the optic nerve extending to the temporal periphery. All clinical investigations, amongst others ultrasonography, computerized tomography and magnetic resonance tomography, suggested a choroidal melanoma with extrabulbar extension. An enucleation with partial exenteration was performed. A demonstration and discussion of the clinical findings and the rare and complicated histological diagnosis of a very unusual ectopic meningioma-like lesion are given. 
Prediction of postoperative pain and duration of hospitalization using two anxiety measures. This study examined the extent to which measures of anxiety could predict pain and the length of hospitalization following surgery in 111 patients with gallstones over and above what could be predicted on the basis of biographical and medical status variables. Self-reported pain on the third day postoperative could hardly be explained by the variables measured. Preoperative anxiety did not increase the value of the prediction. Age, type of surgery, cystitis and wound infection explained a significant proportion of the variance in postoperative hospital stay. Over and above these variables. A-state on the third postoperative day and also A-state and specific anxiety measured 1 day before surgery exerted a significant increase on the values of prediction of the length of postoperative hospitalization. 
Interferon-gamma inhibits arterial stenosis after injury. BACKGROUND. Arterial injury initiates a proliferative response among the smooth muscle cells of the artery. This leads to the formation of a thickened intima that may reduce the diameter of the arterial lumen. Such intimal lesions often develop after vascular surgery and angioplastic procedures. Previous cell culture studies have shown that the lymphokine, interferon-gamma (gIFN), inhibits smooth muscle cell proliferation. METHODS AND RESULTS. We therefore tested whether administration of exogenous gIFN could inhibit the development of intimal lesions. Rat carotid arteries were denuded with a balloon catheter, resulting in the formation of a standardized intimal lesion. The animals were then treated with recombinant rat gIFN at 200,000 units (approximately 400,000 units or 100 micrograms/kg body wt) administered parenterally once daily for 7 days. Autoradiographic analysis of 3H-thymidine incorporation revealed that gIFN reduced the early smooth muscle replication by approximately 75%. gIFN treatment for 1 week resulted in a 50% reduction of intimal cross-section area at 2 weeks after injury when compared to control rats injected with buffer alone. The difference in lesion development persisted in rats analyzed 10 weeks after injury, suggesting that proliferative events during the first week determine the long-term development of the intima. Inhibition of lesion development was accompanied by expression of the class II histocompatibility (Ia) gene, RT1B, suggesting that both were directly related to the administration of gIFN. CONCLUSIONS. These results show that gIFN is a potent inhibitor of the formation of arterial proliferative lesions in vivo. It is possible that gIFN could be useful in preventing arterial stenosis after surgery and angioplasty in man. 
Anaerobic threshold in patients with exercise-induced myocardial ischemia. The aim of the present study was to investigate the ventilatory anaerobic threshold in patients with exercise-induced myocardial ischemia. Ventilatory volumes and gas exchanges were measured during treadmill stress testing in 36 patients (11 with previous myocardial infarction) with electrocardiographic criteria of myocardial ischemia during the test and in 23 healthy, untrained control subjects of equivalent age. The anaerobic threshold was detected in 32 of 36 patients (89%) and in 22 of 23 control subjects (96%). The anaerobic threshold was significantly lower in patients than in control subjects (13.5 +/- 1.9 versus 19.7 +/- 1.7 ml/kg per minute VO2, p less than 0.001). In the 21 patients without previous myocardial infarction, the anaerobic threshold was also significantly lower than in the control subjects (13.9 +/- 1.6 versus 19.7 +/- 1.7 ml/kg per minute VO2, p less than 0.001). Among the 21 patients without previous myocardial infarction, the 12 with a low ischemic threshold, which occurred during the first three steps of the modified Bruce protocol, had an anaerobic threshold significantly lower than the other nine patients (13.1 +/- 1.5 versus 14.9 +/- 1.0 ml/kg per minute VO2, p less than 0.01). However, even in the patients with a moderate to high ischemic threshold, the anaerobic threshold was significantly lower than in the control subjects (p less than 0.001). These data show that the anaerobic threshold can be measured in the great majority of patients with exercise-induced myocardial ischemia. The low anaerobic threshold level indicates a relevant functional impairment in these patients. 
Safety and efficacy of repeat thrombolytic treatment after acute myocardial infarction. Thrombolytic treatment for acute myocardial infarction increases the risk of subsequent reocclusion of the infarct related artery. The efficacy and safety of repeat thrombolytic treatment was assessed in 31 patients treated with streptokinase (n = 13) or tissue plasminogen activator (n = 18) a median of five days (1-716) after the first infusion. The indication for readministration was prolonged chest pain with new ST segment elevation. Efficacy was assessed by infarct artery patency at angiography at a median of eight days after readministration in 22 patients and by non-invasive criteria in 23 patients (reperfusion was deemed to be likely if serum creatine kinase was not increased or reached a peak less than 12 hours after infarction). Angiography showed patency of 70% of the infarct arteries after readministration of streptokinase and of 75% after tissue plasminogen activator. The corresponding patency rates assessed noninvasively were 73% and 75%. Reinfarction was prevented in nine (29%) patients. Allergic reactions occurred in four of eight patients who received streptokinase twice (plasmacytosis and acute reversible renal failure developed in one patient). Two patients had major bleeding and two minor bleeding, all after tissue plasminogen activator, and one of them died of cerebral haemorrhage. Repeat thrombolytic treatment results in late patency rates similar to the rates after the initial administration. Allergic reactions were common in those treated twice with streptokinase. 
Cancer rates after the Three Mile Island nuclear accident and proximity of residence to the plant. BACKGROUND: In the light of a possible link between stress and cancer promotion or progression, and of previously reported distress in residents near the Three Mile Island (TMI) nuclear power plant, we attempted to evaluate the impact of the March 1979 accident on community cancer rates. METHODS: Proximity of residence to the plant, which related to distress in previous studies, was taken as a possible indicator of accident stress; the postaccident pattern in cancer rates was examined in 69 "study tracts" within a 10-mile radius of TMI, in relation to residential proximity. RESULTS: A modest association was found between postaccident cancer rates and proximity (OR = 1.4; 95% CI = 1.3, 1.6). After adjusting for a gradient in cancer risk prior to the accident, the odds ratio contrasting those closest to the plant with those living farther out was 1.2 (95% CI = 1.0, 1.4). A postaccident increase in cancer rates near the Three Mile Island plant was notable in 1982, persisted for another year, and then declined. Radiation emissions, as modeled mathematically, did not account for the observed increase. CONCLUSION: Interpretation in terms of accident stress is limited by the lack of an individual measure of stress and by uncertainty about whether stress has a biological effect on cancer in humans. An alternative mechanism for the cancer increase near the plant is through changes in care-seeking and diagnostic practice arising from postaccident concern. 
Peritoneopericardial diaphragmatic hernia discovered at coronary bypass operation. A 68-year-old man was discovered to have a large peritoneopericardial hernia when operated on for coronary artery bypass. Such hernias are very unusual. The pathogenesis, clinical presentation, and management of this problem are discussed. 
Primary mandibular reconstruction: analysis of 64 cases and evaluation of interface radiation dosimetry on bridging plates. The combination of a myocutaneous flap or free cutaneous tissue transfer with a three-dimensional bendable reconstruction plate either of stainless steel or titanium has provided very satisfactory results in primary restoration of mandibular defects following surgical resections in irradiated patients or in those who require postoperative radiotherapy. Sixty-four cases have been treated and evaluated prospectively using this technique. Fifty-three of the patients had the soft-tissue defect restored with a myocutaneous flap, 8 had a free cutaneous tissue flap, 2 were reconstructed with tongue flaps, and 1 closed primarily. The stainless steel plate of the A.O. type was used in 53 cases and the titanium plate system and hollow screws in the other 11 cases. A success rate of 78.9% was found with a median follow-up of 384 days. Thirty of the 64 cases had preoperative irradiation and 15 were treated postoperatively. A plate failure rate of 23% was encountered in those treated with preoperative irradiation and in 20% with those having postoperative irradiation. Forty-nine of the 64 patients or 76.5% experienced no perioperative complications. Five or 7.8% of the complications were minor. Ten patients or 15.6% experienced a major complication with one death due to a myocardial infarct. A radiation dosimetric model was employed using both stainless steel and titanium. The results from this study showed that, when using a parallel pair of beams, an excess dose of irradiation for the lowest energy cobalt-60 is 13%, for 6 mV it is 15%, and for 18 mV it is 20%. The excess tissue dose, both for stainless steel and titanium plates, extends for about 0.2 mm for cobalt-60, 1.1 mm at 6 mV, and for 25 mm at 18 mV. Patients with plates, therefore, can be treated safely with postoperative irradiation using either cobalt-60 or 6-mV energy. 
Transcatheter occlusion of pulmonary arterial circulation and collateral supply: failures, incidents, and complications. Failures and complications were analyzed retrospectively in 45 patients treated with embolotherapy or occlusion of pulmonary arterial circulation. Pulmonary arterial branches were occluded with steel coils in 19 patients with pulmonary arteriovenous malformations, 17 with hemoptysis of pulmonary artery (PA) origin, and one with massive parenchymal shunt. Bronchial arterial supply to the lung was embolized with small particles in eight cases of hemoptysis and systemic to pulmonary arterial antegrade shunt secondary to chronic thromboembolism. Asymptomatic incidents included catheterization failures, vascular damage, partial occlusion, partial recanalization of the thrombus, ectopic deposition of a coil, and delayed bacterial contamination of the thrombus. A few cases of transient clinical and radiologic signs of pulmonary infarction were observed after complete occlusion of the PA and bronchial artery embolization. This complication was never observed after complete occlusion of main right or left PA, inferior right or left PA, or segmental branches. The management and prevention of these complications, the role of bronchial arterial collateral pathways, and the importance of the site of PA occlusion in the development of pulmonary infarction are discussed. 
Follow-up study of unruptured aneurysms arising from the C3 and C4 segments of the internal carotid artery. A follow-up study of unruptured aneurysms arising from the C3 and C4 segments of the internal carotid artery was performed. During the 10-year period from 1979 to 1989, there were 22 patients with 24 aneurysms arising from the C3 or C4 segment of the internal carotid artery. All 24 aneurysms were unruptured. They represented 3% of all intracranial aneurysms and 11% of all internal carotid artery aneurysms diagnosed at the hospital during the 10-year period. Eighteen patients were women and 4 were men. Their ages ranged from 34 to 82 years (mean 63.3 years). Of the 22 patients, 12 (55%) had multiple aneurysms. A follow-up study without treatment was made in 15 of the 22 patients who had a total of 16 unruptured aneurysms arising from the C3 or C4 segment of the internal carotid artery. This study excluded 7 of the 22 patients with a total of eight aneurysms because of operation or death soon after diagnosis. The average maximal dimension of the 16 aneurysms was 5 mm, with a range of 2-17 mm. Follow-up periods varied from 11 months to 10.5 years, with an average of 4.7 years. During this period, none of the 16 aneurysms ruptured, and they remained asymptomatic, except for one aneurysm that had been discovered as a result of the cavernous sinus syndrome. Some surgeons are now attempting direct operations on intracavernous carotid artery aneurysms, even if the aneurysms are unruptured and relatively small. 
Standardizing neck dissection terminology. Official report of the Academy's Committee for Head and Neck Surgery and Oncology. The emergence of the multitude of modified techniques for neck dissection procedure has resulted in a nomenclature system that is nonuniform. To eliminate potential misinterpretation, overlap, and lack of standardization, the Academy's Committee for Head and Neck Surgery and Oncology, with input from the Education Committee of the American Society of Head and Neck Surgery, has developed a classification system for these procedures. This has now been adopted by the American Academy of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery. The classification is based on the following concepts: (1) radical neck dissection is the fundamental procedure with which all other neck dissections are compared, (2) modified radical neck dissection denotes preservation of one or more nonlymphatic structure(s), (3) selective neck dissection denotes preservation of one or more group(s) of lymph nodes, and (4) extended radical neck dissection denotes removal of one or more additional lymphatic and/or nonlymphatic structure(s). Adherence to the principles of this classification system to describe neck dissection techniques should provide an improved method of communication. Furthermore, the system provides a rational framework on which subsequent terminology can be added. 
Characterization of tumor hypoxia by 31P MR spectroscopy. Tumor hypoxia is of considerable importance to the oncologist in selecting and optimizing cancer therapy, because hypoxia can determine the effectiveness of various therapies. The relationship between tumor hypoxia and tumor bioenergetics, assessed by 31P MR spectroscopy, is examined to determine whether 31P MR spectroscopy can be clinically useful to measure or characterize tumor hypoxia. Work with experimental tumors has suggested that several different types of hypoxia may exist and that 31P MR spectroscopy cannot be used to characterize all types. Metabolic hypoxia is the level of hypoxia that results in mitochondrial impairment in cells, and it is associated with declining cellular bioenergetic status, which can be measured by enzymatic assay of adenosine triphosphate (ATP). Because 31P MR spectroscopy is sensitive to levels of ATP, it is potentially sensitive to metabolic hypoxia in vivo and may provide a rapid and noninvasive technique for characterizing metabolic hypoxia in tumors. Radiobiologic hypoxia is the level of hypoxia that results in attenuated cell death due to radiation, because radiotoxicity is directly related to tissue levels of oxygen. Radiobiologic hypoxia of tumors thus has more impact on choice of therapy, yet the relationship between metabolic hypoxia and radiobiologic hypoxia remains to be elucidated. An analysis of published data suggests that 31P MR spectroscopy is directly sensitive to metabolic hypoxia in tumors, but it is only indirectly sensitive to radiobiologic hypoxia in tumors. Therefore, 31P MR spectroscopy may be unable to quantify the cell fraction of a tumor that has radiobiologic hypoxia. However, preliminary data suggest that MR spectroscopy may prove useful for determining the effectiveness of therapeutic interventions designed to manipulate radiobiologic hypoxia in tumors or for monitoring the kinetics of tumor reoxygenation after treatment. 
The Sugiura procedure for patients with hemorrhagic portal hypertension secondary to extrahepatic portal vein thrombosis. The Sugiura procedure (SP) was performed upon 27 patients with hemorrhagic portal hypertension secondary to extrahepatic portal vein thrombosis (EPVT) without associated hepatic disease. There were 14 female and 13 male patients. The mean age was 28 +/- 14 years. The causes of EPVT were protein C deficiency in two; antithrombin III deficiency in one patient, a history of omphalitis in two patients, a history of pancreatitis in one patient and idiopathy in 21 patients. The SP was completed in two surgical stages in 14 patients and in one stage in nine. There was one operative death. One patient had mild postoperative encephalopathy, and two patients rebled at long term follow-up study. Actuarial survival rate was 82 per cent at five and ten years. It is concluded that the SP is a good alternative for the management of hemorrhagic portal hypertension secondary to EPVT. 
Reversal of intrapulmonary shunting in cirrhosis after liver transplantation demonstrated by perfusion lung scan. A young girl with biliary atresia leading to cirrhosis developed respiratory complications with hypoxemia. Intrapulmonary shunting was diagnosed with a 99mTc-MAA perfusion lung scan, which showed marked systemic activity. The shunting resolved after liver transplantation. The perfusion lung scan offers an efficient method to screen patients with cirrhosis in whom intrapulmonary shunts are suspected and to follow their progress. 
Surgical approaches for resection of heterotopic ossification in traumatic brain-injured adults. The site of heterotopic ossification (HO) at the elbow or the hip dictates the surgical approach for resection. Three approaches are used for HO resection at the elbow: (1) a posterolateral approach for posterolateral HO; (2) an anterolateral approach for anterior HO; and (3) a medical approach for medial or posteromedial HO or anterior transfer of the ulnar nerve. Two approaches are recommended for resection of HO at the hip: (1) an anterior approach for anterior or inferomedial HO and (2) a posterior approach for posterior HO. Posterior HO is often associated with a hip-flexion contracture, and an anterior soft-tissue release may be necessary as well. Physical examination indicates the prognosis for functional improvement as well as recurrence. Patients with a near normal neurologic recovery have minimal to no HO recurrence with improved limb function and increased joint motion, whereas a poor neurologic recovery and persistent spasticity are associated with recurrence of HO and no functional limb improvement. Standard roentgenograms aid in selecting the appropriate surgical approach. Radiation, indomethacin, and diphosphonates have been administered for prophylaxis. Physical therapy is necessary until range of motion stabilizes. 
Strategies for reducing cardiovascular risk in women. The major risk factors for coronary heart disease in women are much the same as in men. They include elevated cholesterol, hypertension, diabetes, cigarette smoking, severe obesity, a history of stroke and/or thromboembolic disease, and a family history of premature coronary heart disease. Diabetes appears to confer a greater risk and hypertension to have a lesser effect in women than in men. The obstetrician-gynecologist's role as primary care physician is important in terms of risk reduction counseling in areas that are amenable to change: diet, exercise and cigarette smoking. A fourth area, prescribing hormonal therapy, including oral contraceptives and hormone replacement, is the one risk reduction modality that is within the physician's control. 
Shortlasting, unilateral, neuralgiform headache attacks with conjunctival injection, tearing, and subclinical forehead sweating ("Sunct" syndrome): II. Changes in heart rate and arterial blood pressure during pain paroxysms. The recently described "Sunct" syndrome is a rare picture of unilateral, shortlasting headache attacks accompanied by autonomic phenomena (conjunctival injection, tearing, etc.) on the symptomatic side. Heart rate and blood pressure were monitored in two elderly "Sunct" patients during and outside headache attacks. An ultrasound Doppler servo method was used for the non-invasive, continuous, beat-to-beat determination of instantaneous arterial blood pressure. In a third patient, systolic and diastolic blood pressure, both outside and during pain paroxysms, were assessed using the standard Korotkoff method. Heart rate was found to be significantly decreased during pain paroxysms. Systolic blood pressure was observed to be significantly increased during attacks, when compared with the inter-attack period, while a less consistent pattern was observed for diastolic blood pressure. Some of the changes in the cardiovascular system seemed to start prior to pain onset. Therefore, it seems unlikely that these changes were caused by pain activation of the sympathetic nervous system or the oculocardiac reflex. 
Associative anomia: dissociating words and their definitions. A 60-year-old woman, in whom magnetic resonance imaging and single photon emission computed tomography confirmed the presence of chronic damage to the left temporal lobe, had pure anomia with sparing of other language and cognitive functions. She could independently access lexical knowledge (words) and semantic knowledge (word definitions). We postulate that her anomia was due to a failure to associate lexical and semantic knowledge. 
Benign hemorrhagic adrenocortical macrocysts in Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome. A new pseudotumorous lesion found in the adrenal cortex of six infants with Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome is described. These cystic masses were discovered either prenatally by using sonography or early in the neonatal period as palpable flank masses. Imaging studies, including sonography and CT, could not confidently exclude malignancy. After the masses were removed surgically, histologic examination showed them all to be benign hemorrhagic macrocysts within the capsule or permanent cortex (in contrast to neonatal adrenal hemorrhage, which usually occurs more centrally in the fetal cortex). The cysts were as large as 8 cm in diameter, and in one case a solitary cyst was predominant. Hemihypertrophy was present in all cases. Four of the six lesions were right-sided, and there was a male-female ratio of 5:1. Benign hemorrhagic adrenocortical macrocysts are a cause of abdominal mass in the fetus and neonate with Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome. 
Effects of U74006F on multifocal cerebral blood flow and metabolism after cardiac arrest in dogs. Lipid peroxidation reactions during reperfusion after cardiac arrest may contribute to postischemic cerebral hypoperfusion, which in turn can contribute to permanent neurological dysfunction. We designed this study to determine whether the aminosteroid U74006F, a putative inhibitor of lipid peroxidation, mitigates cerebral multifocal hypoperfusion after cardiac arrest. We used our established dog model of ventricular fibrillation cardiac arrest (no blood flow) of 12.5 minutes, reperfusion by cardiopulmonary bypass of less than or equal to 5 minutes, and control of extracerebral variables during 4 hours postarrest. Cerebral blood flow was monitored by the stable xenon computed tomography method. Changes in cerebral oxygen consumption were obtained from mean blood flow values of coronal slices and the cerebral arteriovenous (sagittal sinus) oxygen content difference. A treatment group (n = 5) received U74006F starting with reperfusion (1.5 mg/kg i.a. plus 1.5 mg/kg i.v.) and three additional (graded) doses over 4 hours (total dose 4.5, 7.5, or 14.5 mg/kg). The U74006F-treated group showed the same postarrest transient hyperemia and protracted hypoperfusion in terms of global (computed tomography slice), regional, and local (multifocal) cerebral blood flow values and the same global cerebral oxygen consumption pattern as a concurrent control group (n = 5). At 1-4 hours postarrest, in both groups there was mismatching of global cerebral oxygen consumption, which reached baseline values, in relation to global cerebral blood flow and oxygen delivery, which remained at 50% of baseline. We conclude that treatment with U74006F after prolonged cardiac arrest causes no deleterious side effects and does not seem to alter multifocal postarrest cerebral blood flow and oxygen consumption. 
Pulmonary microvascular permeability in patients with severe mitral stenosis. Patients with rheumatic mitral stenosis often have no pulmonary oedema despite considerably increased pulmonary venous pressure. Pulmonary microvascular permeability was measured non-invasively by a previously validated method of double isotope scintigraphy with indium-113m and technetium-99m. This permits calculation of an index reflecting transferrin efflux and thus, indirectly, the microvascular permeability. Fifteen patients with severe mitral stenosis (defined as valve area less than 1.0 cm2) were compared with a control group of 11 patients with mild coronary artery disease. The permeability index was significantly lower in patients with mitral stenosis than in the control group. Furthermore, the extent of reduction of the permeability index correlated with the severity of mitral stenosis as reflected by the Gorlin valve area. This finding may account for the relative resistance of these patients to pulmonary oedema despite chronic pulmonary venous hypertension. 
The effect on pulmonary function of tangential field technique in radiotherapy for carcinoma of the breast. Twenty-five patients treated by lumpectomy and radiotherapy for Stage I breast cancer were enrolled in a prospective study to measure the effects of tangential field irradiation on pulmonary function. Fractional doses of 2 Gy to a total of 50 Gy were administered with the tangential technique. An additional 10 Gy (2 Gy x 5) was given as direct booster. Dynamic and static lung volumes, distribution of ventilation and gas transfer were measured before irradiation and at varying intervals up to 1 year after the completion of therapy. There was a small, but statistically significant decrease in the forced vital capacity (mean 63 ml) and the forced expiratory volume in 1 second (mean 79 ml) measured 3 months after irradiation (p less than 0.05). These changes were reversed within 1 year. The reduction in total lung capacity (mean 240 ml) after 3 months was nearly significant (p = 0.06). The remaining variables did not change to a significant degree. We conclude that a slight restrictive ventilatory impairment may occur when a combined tangential and direct booster technique is applied. The changes are, however, small and reversible, and imply no clinical importance. 
The significance of antibody to hepatitis C virus in patients with chronic hepatitis B. We assessed the prevalence and clinical significance of antibodies to hepatitis C virus among a cohort of 148 patients with chronic hepatitis B virus infection. Sixteen patients (11%) had anti-hepatitis C virus detectable by enzyme-linked immunoassay. The results from eight of these patients were positive by recombinant immunoblot assay. The results of recombinant immunoblot assay testing were not consistent; therefore the analysis of the patients' data was based on anti-hepatitis C virus enzyme-linked immunoassay results. Patients with chronic hepatitis B with anti-hepatitis C virus were more likely to be cirrhotic (44% vs. 21%) and to have decompensated liver disease (24% vs. 6%). Hepatitis B virus replication appeared to be suppressed in patients with both infections as measured by hepatitis B virus-associated DNA polymerase activity (mean = 2,055 vs. 2,555 cpm). Human immunodeficiency virus infection was more common in the anti-hepatitis C virus positive group (36% vs. 11%). Thus hepatitis C virus appears to suppress hepatitis B virus replication and to cause more severe liver disease in patients with chronic hepatitis B infection. 
The tissue origin of low back pain and sciatica: a report of pain response to tissue stimulation during operations on the lumbar spine using local anesthesia. In an effort to define the origin of low back pain and sciatica, 193 patients were carefully studied using progressive local anesthesia. These patients had surgery for herniated discs, spinal stenoses, or both. Various tissues were stimulated during the performance of these lumbar spinal operations. This article discusses our observations and the results of that study. 
Acquired Brown's syndrome associated with hypogammaglobulinemia. We describe a 10-year-old girl with hypogammaglobulinemia who presented initially with painless progressive diplopia on right upward gaze and associated tenderness in the area of the superior oblique tendon (Brown's syndrome). She was given prednisone (40 mg/day) with gradual improvement of her symptoms. Prednisone was tapered and her symptoms remained unchanged for 10 months. She then experienced rapid deterioration. Prednisone was reinstituted with similar improvement and then therapy was switched to naproxen. She remains with only slight diplopia on extreme upward gaze. 
Relation of stenosis morphology and clinical presentation to the procedural results of directional coronary atherectomy BACKGROUND. Directional coronary atherectomy has recently become available to treat coronary stenoses. This study was performed to determine the relation of patient characteristics and stenosis morphology to procedural outcome with directional coronary atherectomy to gain insight into which patients might be best treated with this device. METHODS AND RESULTS. Four hundred stenoses from 378 patients consecutively treated at six major referral institutions were analyzed. Angiographic data were assessed at a central angiographic laboratory using standardized morphological criteria and computer-assisted quantitative dimensional analyses. Procedural success was achieved in 87.8% of stenoses, and major ischemic complications (death, myocardial infarction, and emergency bypass surgery) occurred in 6.3% of patients. Lesion success and complications were closely correlated with recognized modified American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association Task Force lesion morphological criteria. Observed for type A stenoses were 93% success and 3% complication rates; for type B1 stenoses, 88% success and 6% complication rates; and for type B2 stenoses, 75% success and 13% complication rates, respectively. There were too few type C stenoses treated to analyze. Furthermore, multivariate testing demonstrated stenosis angulation (multivariate p less than 0.001), proximal tortuosity (p less than 0.001), decreased preatherectomy minimum lumen dimension (p = 0.032), and calcification (p = 0.041) to correlate independently with adverse outcome and complex, probably thrombus-associated stenoses to have a favorable outcome (p = 0.055). Operator experience (p = 0.020) and a history of restenosis (p = 0.022) also favorably influenced outcome. CONCLUSIONS. The procedural outcome of directional coronary atherectomy is highly associated with coronary stenosis morphology. Furthermore, after appropriate stratification for morphology and clinical presentation, overall atherectomy procedural outcome may be similar to that achieved with coronary angioplasty. However, specific subsets of patients may have relatively better outcome with either atherectomy or balloon angioplasty. 
Antineutrophil cytoplasmic autoantibody-associated diseases: a pathologist's perspective. Antineutrophil cytoplasmic autoantibodies (ANCA) are a useful diagnostic serologic marker for the most common forms of necrotizing vasculitis, provide a means of categorizing vasculitides so that diagnostically useful shared pathologic and clinical characteristics can be recognized, and offer insight into the pathogenesis of previously idiopathic diseases. ANCA-associated vasculitides can be categorized into a number of distinctive clinicopathologic categories, eg, Wegener's granulomatosis, Churg-Strauss syndrome, pulmonary renal syndrome, microscopic polyarteritis nodosa, leukocytoclastic angiitis, and necrotizing and crescentic glomerulonephritis. At least the latter four syndromes can also be caused by other ANCA-negative immunopathogenic mechanisms, eg, immune complex deposition. Therefore, thorough diagnostic classification requires both an assessment of clinicopathologic category, as well as an assessment of immunopathologic category. Although different ANCA-associated vasculitic syndromes have distinctive clinical and pathologic features, all ANCA-associated vasculitides share a number of common pathologic features, ie, focal distribution, necrosis, and neutrophil infiltration. ANCA assays have very good sensitivity and specificity for ANCA-associated diseases, but the prevalence of these diseases in the patient population being analyzed must be taken into consideration when determining the predictive value of a test result. As with all serologic tests, ANCA results must be integrated with other clinical and pathologic data in order to reach the most accurate diagnostic conclusion. 
Arthropathy of the ankle in hemophilia. Seventy-five patients who had hemophilia were followed clinically and roentgenographically to assess the prevalence of hemarthrosis and the prevalence and severity of arthropathy of the ankle. The mean age of the patients at the time of follow-up was twenty-two years and seven months. The patients were divided into four age-groups: less than ten years (eleven patients), ten to nineteen years (twenty-one patients), twenty to thirty years (twenty-four patients), and more than thirty years (nineteen patients). Intra-articular bleeding occurred more frequently in the joints of the lower extremities than in the joints of the upper extremities. During the second decade of life, hemarthroses occurred more often in the ankle than in the knee. A history of recurrent bleeding into the ankle joint, chronic synovitis, and overgrowth of the medial portion of the distal tibial epiphysis was associated with an early onset of arthropathy. In older patients, compression arthrodesis of the ankle joint was helpful in eliminating pain, recurrent bleeding, and equinus deformity. 
Neurologic outcome after electroencephalographically proven neonatal seizures. Infants in whom neonatal seizures were confirmed by randomly recorded ictal electroencephalographic (EEG) tracings were retrospectively examined to determine their global neurologic outcome and the specific frequency of epilepsy, development delay, and cerebral palsy. Perinatal and postnatal clinical and EEG variables were also examined for their relevance to the neurologic outcome. Forty infants with EEG documented seizures of diverse etiologies were studied. The 27 survivors were followed up at a mean of 31 months. The outcome was unfavorable in 70%. The rate of epilepsy was 56%, of developmental delay 67%, and of cerebral palsy 63%. The etiology of seizures was an important factor influencing the outcome. Other clinical factors that showed a significant relationship with global or specific aspects of the neurologic outcome included the age at the onset of seizures, birth weight, and neurologic examination results. The EEG parameters that significantly predicted the neurologic outcome were interictal EEG background, increased seizure frequency, and decreased seizure duration. 
Recognition of human 60 kD heat shock protein by mononuclear cells from patients with juvenile chronic arthritis. A postulated mechanism for autoimmune disorders is that the immunoreactivity develops against bacterial antigens which show a high degree of sequence homology with mammalian proteins. The mycobacterial 65 kD heat shock protein (hsp) has been implicated in several forms of arthritis. Substantial amounts of the human 60 kD homologue (hsp60) were produced by insertion of the gene into Escherichia coli. To investigate the hypothesis that T-cell reactivity is directed against the endogenous hsp, T-cell proliferation of synovial-fluid and peripheral-blood mononuclear cells in response to hsp60 was studied in samples from six patients with juvenile chronic arthritis (JCA) and nine adult patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA). There was no T-lymphocyte proliferative response to purified fractions of hsp60 in mononuclear cells from RA patients or healthy children and young adults. However, both synovial-fluid and peripheral-blood mononuclear cells from JCA patients showed substantial proliferative responses. There was a significant correlation between the stimulation indices for human hsp60 and for mycobacterial hsp65 (r = 0.948, p less than 0.02). A similar correlation for hsp60 and mycobacterial hsp70 did not achieve significance. Immunohistochemistry showed that hsp65 and hsp70 homologues were expressed in the synovial membrane in these patients but not in controls. These findings suggest a sequence of events in which hsps become expressed during synovial inflammation and function as autoantigens. In JCA this may be manifested by specific T-cell reactivity which apparently is lost in the more bone-eroding and non-remitting adult disease. 
Involvement of neutrophils in postischaemic damage to the small intestine. Haemorrhagic mucosal lesions are produced during intestinal ischaemia and after reperfusion probably mediated by oxygen radicals. Oxygen radicals react with cell membrane lipids and induce cell damage by peroxidation and induce accumulation of polymorphonuclear leucocytes in the tissue. The aim of the study was to elucidate the involvement of polymorphonuclear leucocytes in post-ischaemic intestinal damage. Intestinal ischaemia was induced in cats by partial occlusion of the superior mesenteric artery. Samples from the small intestine were excised before and at the end of the two hour hypotensive period as well as 10 minutes and 60 minutes after reperfusion. Conjugated dienes, myeloperoxidase, and the purine metabolites were determined in the samples. The tissue was also examined histologically. Seven cats were treated before reperfusion with a monoclonal antibody (IB4) which inhibits leucocyte adherence to endothelial cells and its subsequent activation. After reperfusion myeloperoxidase activity increased and the ischaemic mucosal lesions worsened significantly. IB4 treatment prevented an increase in post-hypotensive myeloperoxidase activity and attenuated the normally observed severe mucosal lesions. We conclude that the severe post-ischaemic lesions are induced by polymorphonuclear leucocytes. Such mucosal injury may be appreciably reduced by blocking leucocyte adherence with IB4. 
Synchronous arytenoid and pancreatic neuroendocrine carcinoma. Neuroendocrine laryngeal carcinoid tumours are uncommon. The supraglottis is the main location of these tumours. Eighty-one cases have been reported in the world literature. We present the first case of a synchronous laryngeal and pancreatic neuroendocrine tumour. 
Importance of left ventricular systolic function in the assessment of left ventricular diastolic function with Doppler transmitral flow velocity recording. To study the effect of left ventricular systolic function on the Doppler transmitral flow velocity pattern, Doppler echocardiographic variables were correlated with hemodynamic indexes in 11 control subjects and 58 patients with heart disease. All underwent cardiac catheterization performed with use of a Millar micromanometer. The time constant of left ventricular isovolumetric pressure decrease and left ventricular end-diastolic myocardial stiffness was calculated. The 58 patients were classified into two groups according to ejection fraction: group I (n = 30; ejection fraction greater than 55%) and group II (n = 28; ejection fraction less than 50%). Compared with the control subjects, patients in group I had impairment only of left ventricular relaxation (time constant 47 +/- 9 vs. 38 +/- 3 ms; p less than 0.01), whereas patients in group II had, in addition to impaired left ventricular relaxation (time constant 52 +/- 11 vs. 38 +/- 3 ms; p less than 0.01), increased preload, increased pulmonary capillary pressure (12 +/- 8 vs. 5 +/- 3 mm Hg; p less than 0.01) and increased myocardial stiffness (2,018 +/- 980 vs. 1,050 +/- 218 g/cm2; p less than 0.01). In group I, there was a significant partial correlation coefficient between the time constant and deceleration half-time (r = 0.54). In group II, a strong correlation existed between myocardial stiffness and peak atrial filling velocity (r = -0.71) and between myocardial stiffness and the ratio of peak atrial to peak rapid filling velocity (r = -0.71). 
A critical evaluation of new agents for the treatment of sepsis. OBJECTIVE - To evaluate new treatments directed against endotoxin, tumor necrosis factor alpha, and interleukin 1 for use in sepsis and related disorders (sepsis syndrome and septic shock). DATA SOURCES - Investigations of these treatments in animal models, healthy human volunteers, and patients with sepsis and related disorders. STUDY SELECTION - Particular attention was paid to studies of patients with sepsis and related disorders, especially randomized, double-blind, controlled trials. DATA EXTRACTION - Animal studies and investigations with human volunteers were judged by how closely the experimental model replicated the clinical disorder (sepsis). Patient trials were assessed by sample size and design. Results of all studies were used to evaluate the likelihood that a given treatment would reduce mortality. DATA SYNTHESIS - Direct comparison of E5 and HA-1A antibody studies is difficult because of differences in their design, definitions of shock, and methods of subgroup analysis. However, both antibodies improve outcome in some subgroups: E5 benefits patients with gram-negative infection (bacteremic or focal) who do not have refractory shock, and HA-1A benefits those with gram-negative bacteremia (regardless of whether shock is present) but not those with focal gram-negative infection. Two agents that may be beneficial in gram-positive and gram-negative infection are monoclonal antibodies to tumor necrosis factor alpha and receptor antagonists to interleukin 1. Preliminary results with both are reviewed. CONCLUSIONS - All three types of treatment may improve outcome in sepsis. The best results will probably be obtained with combination therapy that interrupts multiple points of the inflammatory cascade underlying sepsis. 
Islet amyloid polypeptide in proliferating pancreatic B cells during development, hyperplasia, and neoplasia in humans and mice. The occurrence of islet amyloid polypeptide (IAPP) immunoreactivity was investigated in fetal pancreas, islet cell hyperplasia, and tumors in humans and mice. Transgenic mice heritably developing endocrine tumors of the pancreas (AVP/SV40, Rip 1 Tag2/Rip2PyST1 and Glu2-Tag strains) were used as murine models of islet cells proliferative disease. In the mouse, IAPP immunoreactivity was found in B cells at embryonic day 12 (E12), paralleling the onset of insulin immunoreactivity. In hyperplastic/dysplastic islets and in B-cell tumors of transgenic mice (n = 16), IAPP immunoreactivity was localized consistently to insulin-immunoreactive cells. Ultrastructural single- and double-immunogold labeling of transgenic mice B-cell tumors (n = 3) showed insulin and IAPP to be colocalized in beta granules. In human fetuses, IAPP immunoreactivity was found in insulin-immunoreactive B cells, but at a later gestational age than the onset of insulin immunoreactivity. In pancreatic specimens of infantile/neonatal persistent hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemia (11 cases) and in pancreatic endocrine tumors (21 cases, 10 of which were functioning insulinomas), IAPP immunoreactivity was found consistently in insulin-immunoreactive B cells. Congo-red-positive amyloid deposits present in tumors also were IAPP immunoreactive. Ultrastructural single and double immunogold labeling of infantile/neonatal persistent hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemia cases (n = 3) and functioning insulinomas (n = 2) showed IAPP and insulin to be colocalized in beta granules. In addition, IAPP immunoreactivity was observed in amyloidlike fibrils. These findings indicate that IAPP is a constitutive component of B cells. Possible relationships between IAPP and insulin expression and interspecies differences are suggested and discussed. 
Interethnic differences in pain perception. While several investigators have reported relationships between ethnic background and expression of pain, such relationships are in fact highly problematical. Few studies of pain and ethnicity have used quantitative measures of pain combined with multivariate methods of data analysis. Most have focussed on populations which, unlike many in the United States today, are characterized by highly distinct ethnic groups. The study reported here interviewed 536 persons recently treated for forms of cancer known to cause significant pain. Pain was assessed using standard, well validated instruments, including Graphic Rating Scales anchored in several alternative time-frames and the McGill Pain Questionnaire. The study took place in an area with a low proportion of recent immigrants and only small concentrations of distinct ethnic minorities. No statistically significant relationships were observed between ethnic identity and measures of pain sensation. However, pain described in affective terms according to the McGill Pain Questionnaire did vary among ethnicities. This observation suggests that cultures associated with specific ethnic identities still condition individual expression of pain despite the high degree of assimilation that has occurred among ethnic groups in the United States. 
Repair of abdominal aortic aneurysms. A statewide experience. The results of elective treatment of abdominal aortic aneurysms are excellent in many institutions. To our knowledge, however, no study has compared the results in a large geographic area in which patients were treated by a variety of surgeons and hospitals. We studied the results of repairing abdominal aortic aneurysms for all Medicare recipients during a single year in Kentucky. One hundred thirty-six operations were performed by 52 surgeons in 31 hospitals. Overall operative mortality was 18%; elective and emergency operative mortality rates were 6% and 49%, respectively. Advancing age did not affect outcome, but mortality due to ruptured aneurysms was higher in smaller hospitals than in larger hospitals. The low mortality for elective repair of abdominal aortic aneurysms in an elderly population by numerous surgeons in divergent hospitals is a strong indication for its liberal use compared with the high mortality and morbidity of emergency surgery. 
Gastrocolic fistula with pyloric stenosis and benign gastric ulcer. We have reported a case of gastrocolic fistula with gastric outlet obstruction as a complication of benign gastric ulcer. The single-stage surgical procedure described resulted in a successful outcome. Benign gastric ulcer currently appears to be the most prevalent cause of gastrocolic fistula. 
Anticardiolipin and antineutrophil antibodies in giant cell arteritis. IgG anticardiolipin antibodies (aCL) were found in a patient with Takayasu's arteritis and then in 11 of 22 patients with temporal arteritis (TA) studied prospectively. In comparison IgG aCL were found in only one of 18 elderly controls with rheumatoid arthritis and one of 47 healthy elderly controls. In TA IgG aCL were more frequent in those with acute disease (8/12), in those with an accompanying history of polymyalgia rheumatica (9/13), p less than 0.05); and levels normalized with corticosteroid treatment. Antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies (c-ANCA) were present in one patient with TA who had no systemic disease. 
Histological changes in free jejunal grafts used in pharyngeal reconstruction. A histological study was performed of biopsies taken from jejunal free grafts used in pharyngeal reconstruction. The main findings were a decreased crypt/villi ratio and a mild chronic inflammatory infiltrate. There was no evidence of metaplastic or dysplastic transformation. 
Atrial regulation of intravascular volume: observations on the tachycardia-polyuria syndrome. The atria, strategically located at the junction of the venous and arterial circulation, contain a network of neural and humoral structures by which they sense and regulate intravascular volume. Atrial receptors, most commonly consisting of complex unencapsulated nerve endings discharging into myelinated vagal fibers, are located in the intrapericardial portions of the caval and pulmonary veins and the adjacent atrial walls. Receptor activation by atrial distension results in increased afferent vagal fiber discharge, which in turn leads to tachycardia (Bainbridge's reflex) and decreased renal sympathetic nerve activity, renal vasomotor tone, and antidiuretic hormone activity. In addition, atrial distension also releases ANF, a peptide with potent diuretic, natriuretic, and vasorelaxant actions. The combined effect of these neurohumoral changes is the production of a large hypotonic diuresis. In the clinical setting the volume-regulating role of the atria is demonstrated by the tachycardia-polyuria syndrome. Laboratory and clinical evidence points to the activation of atrial neurohumoral mechanisms in response to atrial distension as the mediators of the polyuria that often accompanies paroxysmal tachycardias. The involvement of these mechanisms in other forms of cardiac congestion and the capability to easily measure in the blood an index of atrial distension, namely ANF, provide the opportunity to elucidate the pathophysiology and hence to open new therapeutic avenues in many cardiac disorders. 
Evolution of insulin secretory response to glucose by perifused islets from lean (FA/FA) rats chronically infused with glucose. Chronic infusion of nondiabetic rats with glucose for up to 7 days modified the insulin secretory response by subsequently perifused islets. Thus, on the 1st day of infusion with 40% glucose, the islets responded to 16.7 mM glucose with a 3.9-fold increase in insulin release during the first 10 min with no significant change during the second-phase insulin output compared with the control group. On the 2nd day, there was a 2-fold enhancement of insulin release during the initial 10 min of stimulation, the second phase being a similar to control islets. On the 5th day of infusion, the pattern of insulin release was not significantly different from the control group. After 7 day of infusion, there was a 46% decrease in first-phase and a 33% decrease in second-phase insulin response to glucose. The response to 10 mM arginine plus 5 mM glucose was not modified by chronic glucose infusion. Priming experiments indicate that islets from rats infused for 7 days were not able to recover the normal pattern of secretion in vitro. Islets from 7-day glucose-infused rats contained 75% more protein and had a significantly higher insulin content than control islet, suggesting that insulin synthesis is not involved in the loss of the response observed. Glucose metabolism by the islets was modified by glucose infusion with a significant increase in glucose utilization and no changes in glucose oxidation, suggesting that alterations in mitochondrial oxidative events are involved in the phenomenon of desensitization. 
Possible metastatic routes via portacaval shunts in renal adenocarcinoma with liver metastasis. Renal adenocarcinoma findings from autopsies on patients with and without liver metastasis (635 and 936 patients, respectively) were investigated concerning the mode of metastasis. The patients with liver metastasis showed a significantly higher frequency of metastases to the lungs, lymph nodes, contralateral kidney, adrenals, pancreas, spleen, peritoneum, and intestines; in the female patients, those with liver metastasis had a higher frequency of metastasis to the ovary and uterus than patients without liver metastasis. Some of the metastases to those organs are explainable by venous spread via portacaval shunts as well as ordinary hematogenous or lymphogenous spread, especially, those to the contralateral kidney, adrenals, spleen, intestines, or ovary. 
Wound complications after modified radical mastectomy compared with tylectomy with axillary lymph node dissection. Tylectomy with axillary lymph node dissection and radiotherapy (TAD) has become an accepted treatment for early breast cancer and has been shown to result in equal 5- and 8-year survival when compared with modified radical mastectomy (MRM). In order to determine the safety of TAD with respect to wound complications and to identify potential risk factors, we reviewed the charts of 560 patients undergoing MRM (n = 387) and TAD (n = 173) at Virginia Mason Medical Center from 1983 through 1989. The incidence of infection, seroma, hematoma, and epidermolysis were compared, and obesity, age 60 years or older, smoking, antibiotics, and wound drainage were examined as possible risk factors. There were more wound complications in the MRM group versus the TAD group (49% versus 35%; p less than 0.01), specifically more seromas (29% versus 18%; p less than 0.01) and epidermolysis (18% versus 0%). In the MRM group, age 60 years or older was associated with seroma (p less than 0.01) and smoking was associated with epidermolysis (p less than 0.01). In the TAD group, obesity was associated with infection. In both groups, volume of drainage from closed suction wound drains greater than 30 mL in the 24 hours prior to removal of the last drain was associated with seroma (p less than 0.05). 
Long-term results of choledochoduodenostomy in the treatment of choledocholithiasis: assessment of 225 cases. During a 10-year period 2610 patients were operated on for biliary lithiasis; in 225 (8.6 per cent) cases the operation concluded with a choledochoduodenostomy. The commonest preoperative diagnosis (62.2 per cent) in these 225 patients was choledocholithiasis; 30 patients had previously had a cholecystectomy. After choledochoduodenostomy, 4.0 per cent of patients had an intra-abdominal complication; six patients developed an intra-abdominal abscess and three developed an external biliary fistula. Four patients (1.8 per cent) died, three from pulmonary complications and one from a biliary fistula. After a mean follow-up period of 4.6 years, 71.5 per cent of patients were asymptomatic. The remainder suffered from dyspepsia (15.1 per cent), colicky pain (8.7 per cent) or episodes of cholangitis (4.7 per cent). Endoscopy in the symptomatic patients allowed the following conclusions: (a) no patient with dyspepsia had a problem at the anastomosis; (b) 27 per cent of those with colic had anastomotic stenosis or the sump syndrome; and (c) all patients with cholangitis had anastomotic stenosis and residual calculi. 
Adequacy of preparation for barium enema among elderly outpatients. OBJECTIVE: To determine whether outpatients 75 years of age or older have a higher rate of inadequate bowel preparation for barium enema and of complications associated with the preparation and the test than patients aged 55 to 74 years. DESIGN: Cross-sectional survey. SETTING: Radiology department in a teaching hospital. PATIENTS: Patients 55 years or older referred for a barium enema from March to August 1988. OUTCOME MEASURES: All films were reviewed independently by a study radiologist blind to the staff radiologist's report. Patients were interviewed by telephone within several days after the test to assess the occurrence of problems during the preparation or the test. MAIN RESULTS: Of the 213 patients assessed 72 were excluded: 43 refused to participate or could not be contacted, 16 had previously undergone colonic surgery, and 13 were excluded for other reasons. The remaining 141 patients were separated into three age groups: those 55 to 64 years (46 patients), those 65 to 74 (47) and those 75 or older (48). In 104 cases (74%) the bowel had been prepared adequately; there was no significant difference between the three groups with regard to the adequacy of preparation. The incidence of problems reported by the patients did not differ significantly between the groups. CONCLUSIONS: Outpatients aged 75 years or more are no more likely than those aged 55 to 74 to have problems with bowel preparation or the barium enema itself. Age should not be a criterion for exclusion from barium enema. To try to lower the rate of poor bowel preparation clinicians and radiologists should consider counselling patients more carefully about the importance of proper preparation. Also, the current method of preparation could be examined to determine whether simple changes would significantly improve colon cleanliness. 
Transmission of hepatitis C virus by organ transplantation BACKGROUND. Liver disease is a frequent and major complication after organ transplantation. We sought to determine whether hepatitis C virus (HCV) is transmitted by organ transplantation and whether it causes post-transplantation liver disease. METHODS. Serum samples from all cadaver organ donors to the New England Organ Bank between 1986 and 1990 were screened retrospectively for antibodies to HCV (anti-HCV) by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). We reviewed the hospital records of all recipients of organs from anti-HCV-positive donors for evidence of liver disease. Serum samples from recipients obtained before transplantation and during follow-up were analyzed for anti-HCV. RESULTS. Of 716 organ donors, 13 (1.8 percent) were positive for anti-HCV. Their organs (19 kidneys, 6 hearts, and 4 livers) went to 29 recipients. Non-A, non-B hepatitis developed after transplantation in 14 of the 29 (48 percent), for a prevalence 7.4 times the 6.5 percent prevalence after transplantation from untested donors that was previously reported by two institutions in the organ bank (P less than 0.0001). The liver disease began a mean of 3.8 months after transplantation and became chronic in 12 patients; the other 2 had subfulminant hepatic failure. Liver disease was more frequent in the patients who had received antilymphocyte preparations (P = 0.04). HCV was the cause of the post-transplantation liver disease in 12 of the 13 recipients (92 percent) for whom serum samples were available. Anti-HCV was detected by ELISA in eight and enzyme immunoassay in one; in three others, HCV RNA was detected by polymerase chain reaction in serum samples obtained after transplantation. CONCLUSIONS. Organ transplantation can transmit hepatitis C. This raises serious questions about the continued acceptance of organs from donors positive for anti-HCV. 
Prostaglandin F2 alpha inhibits the ammoniagenic response to acute acidosis in LLC-PK1 cells. A kidney epithelial cell line, LLC-PK1, which does not synthesize prostaglandins, provides an ideal in vitro model system to investigate the effect of prostaglandins in the regulation of renal ammoniagenesis. Previous studies from our laboratory have demonstrated significant increases in glutamine-dependent ammonia and alanine production by rocked cultures of LLC-PK1 cells subjected to either acute metabolic or respiratory acidosis. In the study presented here, experiments were conducted to investigate the role of prostaglandin F2 alpha (PGF2 alpha) and prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) in the response of ammonia metabolism to acute metabolic acidosis by LLC-PK1 cells. A low dose of PGF2 alpha (0.1 ng/mL) dramatically inhibited the stimulatory effect of a low pH (pH 6.8) on ammonia production. In contrast, the inhibition of cytosolically generated alanine was less dramatic and averaged only 20% of the effect on ammonia production. Furthermore, PGF2 alpha increased cellular alpha-ketoglutarate concentration, suggesting an increase in intramitochondrial pH. Thus, the cellular mechanism of PGF2 alpha action appears to involve either interference with the cytosolic pH signal or its translation to the intramitochondrial compartment. The inhibitory response of PGF2 alpha on pH-stimulated ammoniagenesis was progressively lost at higher concentrations. Both low-dose (0.1 ng/mL) and high-dose (10 ng/mL) PGF2 alpha had no significant effect on the basal rates of ammonia and alanine production at pH 7.4. PGE2, on the other hand, did not exhibit any significant response on ammonia or alanine production at either pH 6.8 or 7.4 when given in a wide range of doses. 
Treatment of children with Down syndrome and growth retardation with recombinant human growth hormone. The effect of recombinant human growth hormone on children with Down syndrome who had growth retardation and microcephaly was examined. Thirteen children with trisomy 21 without congenital heart disease who were short for age (-1.19 to -3.5 standard deviation score) and microcephalic (-1.58 to -6.60 standard deviation score) were given recombinant human growth hormone, 0.1 mg/kg subcutaneously, 3 days a week for 1 year. Before treatment, peak serum growth hormone concentrations were less than 10 micrograms/L after levodopa and clonidine stimulation tests in five patients, after clonidine in three patients, and after levodopa in three patients. Three patients had nocturnal integrated growth hormone concentrations of 0.5, 1.5 and 0.65 micrograms/L, respectively. The mean growth rate before treatment was 5.4 +/- 1.6 cm/yr and increased to 12.2 +/- 3.2 cm/yr (p less than 0.001) after 12 months of recombinant human growth hormone treatment. The mean head circumference standard deviation score before treatment was -3.1 +/- 1.3 and increased to -2.3 +/- 1.2 (p less than 0.001) at 12 months. Bone age before and 1 year after treatment increased in correspondence with chronologic age. Plasma hemoglobin A1c concentration was normal during treatment with recombinant human growth hormone. The mean plasma concentrations of insulin-like growth factor I at baseline and at 12 months were 0.54 +/- 0.19 U/ml and 1.25 +/- 0.97 U/ml, respectively (p less than 0.02). We conclude that recombinant human growth hormone therapy can result in a significant increase in annual growth rate and head circumference in children with Down syndrome, without significant side effects. 
A pilot study of stanozolol for advanced breast carcinoma. Eighteen patients with advanced metastatic carcinoma of the breast who had been previously treated with other hormone therapy were treated with stanozolol in a pilot study to assess its efficacy and toxicity. In a heavily pretreated population of patients with advanced breast cancer, three patients (16.6%) had partial responses (PR) and five patients (27.7%) had stable disease (SD). Toxicity was far less than that expected with androgen therapy. Stanozolol should be investigated in large groups of patients to establish its role more fully in the management of metastatic breast carcinoma. 
Cytochrome c oxidase deficiency with acute onset and rapid recovery. A 7-year-old girl with cytochrome c oxidase deficiency who had no neurologic deficits in infancy suddenly developed ophthalmoplegia, ptosis, and respiratory arrest. She recovered almost completely 80 days after onset, suggesting that acute onset and rapid remission are observed in patients with cytochrome c oxidase deficiency. It is also possible that early initiation of therapy in cytochrome c oxidase deficiency with coenzyme Q10 may hasten and enhance the therapeutic effect. 
Cutaneous botryomycosis. We report four cases of cutaneous botryomycosis. The predisposing factors included alcoholism, diabetes, and trauma. Clinically, the patients had nodules, suppurative plaques, or ulcers. In two cases, Staphylococcus aureus was cultured. In one case Neisseria species was cultured and in another a coagulase-negative Staphylococcus and Corynebacterium species were the only organism cultured. All patients responded to systemic antibiotic therapy. 
Assessment of left atrial appendage function by transesophageal echocardiography. Implications for the development of thrombus. BACKGROUND. The predilection of the left atrial appendage (LAA) for thrombus formation has long been known. METHODS AND RESULTS. We prospectively studied the two-dimensional echocardiographic and Doppler patterns of LAA function in 82 patients by transesophageal echocardiography. In the 63 patients in sinus rhythm, LAA area was measured during LAA diastole at the onset of the electrocardiographic (ECG) P wave (LAAmax) and after LAA systole at the ECG R wave (LAAmin) and LAA ejection fraction was calculated as (LAAmax-LAAmin)/LAAmax; peak Doppler velocity was recorded from the LAA outlet. The 58 patients in sinus rhythm without LAA thrombus were grouped according to left atrial size on transthoracic echocardiography; 39 patients had a left atrial size of less than 40 mm (group 1) and 19 had a left atrial size of 40 mm or greater (group 2). Five patients in sinus rhythm had LAA thrombus. In the 19 patients with atrial fibrillation or flutter LAAmax was measured independent of the ECG; three of these patients had LAA spontaneous contrast, four had thrombus, and one had both. Patients in sinus rhythm without LAA thrombus demonstrated a characteristic pattern of a contractile LAA apex and a noncontractile base with color flow and pulsed Doppler evidence of LAA emptying that coincided with the P wave. Patients in sinus rhythm with LAA thrombus had a mean +/- SD LAAmax (8.0 +/- 1.5 cm2) larger than that in group 1 (5.0 +/- 1.9 cm2) (p less than 0.01) but not group 2 (6.7 +/- 3.1 cm2), LAAmin (6.5 +/- 1.0 cm2) larger than that in both group 1 (2.3 +/- 1.5 cm2) and group 2 (4.2 +/- 2.7 cm2) (p less than 0.01), and LAA ejection fraction (17 +/- 11%) and LAA velocity (0.24 +/- 0.10 m/sec) less than those in both group 1 (55 +/- 21% and 0.48 +/- 0.24 m/sec, respectively) and group 2 (45 +/- 27% and 0.46 +/- 0.24 m/sec, respectively) (p less than 0.01). Patients with atrial fibrillation or flutter with LAA spontaneous contrast and/or thrombus had LAAmax (10.4 +/- 6.6 cm2) greater than that in patients with atrial fibrillation or flutter without LAA contrast and/or thrombus (6.8 +/- 3.0 cm2) (p less than 0.05). The LAA appeared as a static pouch in seven of eight of the former compared with in two of 11 of the latter. When attempted, Doppler demonstrated a recognizable fibrillatory LAA outflow velocity pattern in none of three in the former versus four of seven in the latter group. CONCLUSIONS. We conclude that the LAA has a characteristic pattern of emptying in sinus rhythm. LAA thrombus formation in sinus rhythm and atrial fibrillation is associated with both poor LAA contraction and LAA dilation. 
A unique bone-like variant of alkaline phosphatase. The authors describe an unusual variant of alkaline phosphatase (ALP) discovered in a patient with a 90-fold increase in serum ALP. The variant ALP was indistinguishable from the bone isoenzyme when subjected to chemical inhibition, heat inactivation, lectin precipitation, and routine electrophoresis. However, treatment with neuraminidase produced a marked decrease in the ALP variant's electrophoretic mobility and a reduction in its molecular weight. A bone marrow biopsy revealed metastatic infiltration of the bone marrow by adenocarcinoma of the prostate accompanied by a remarkable amount of new bone formation, suggesting a bone origin for the unusual isoenzyme. The authors believe this to be the first report of an ALP variant with these properties. 
Migraine and epilepsy with infantile onset and electroencephalographic findings of occipital spike-wave complexes. An EEG finding of temporo-occipital or temporo-parieto-occipital spike-wave complexes, suppressed by eye opening, coexisting with classical migraine, was observed in 14 children; in 13 of these patients, seizures were present. Classical migraine, visual phenomena and seizures coexisted in different clinical patterns. 
Treatment of advanced-stage Hodgkin's disease: alternating noncrossresistant MOPP/CABS is not superior to MOPP. One hundred twenty-five assessable patients with advanced-stage Hodgkin's disease were randomized to receive mechlorethamine, vincristine, procarbazine, and prednisone (MOPP) or MOPP alternating with lomustine (CCNU), doxorubicin, bleomycin, and streptozocin (CABS). The median follow-up is 7.7 years. The complete response rate was 60 of 66 MOPP-treated patients (91%) and 54 of 59 MOPP/CABS-treated patients (92%) (difference not significant). The level of the disease-free survival curve at longest follow-up is 65% for MOPP-treated patients and 72% for MOPP/CABS-treated patients (difference not significant). The overall survival at 12 years is projected at 68% for MOPP-treated patients and 54% for MOPP/CABS-treated patients (difference not significant). Thus, there were no significant differences in efficacy between MOPP and MOPP/CABS. However, MOPP/CABS was more emetogenic than MOPP, and four MOPP/CABS-treated patients went on to develop secondary acute leukemia. No MOPP-treated patients developed leukemia. High initial erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) and high platelet counts adversely affected treatment outcome. MOPP-treated patients who received greater than 81% of the projected dose intensity of vincristine over the first three cycles had significantly improved disease-free survival rates over those receiving less than 81%. MOPP/CABS-treated patients who received greater than 82% of the projected dose intensity of vincristine had significantly better overall survival than those who received less than 82%. Disease-free survival on both arms was significantly better in patients who received greater than 84% of the projected dose intensity of all agents. The effect of dose intensity was particularly apparent in patients with poor prognostic factors where those who received greater than 84% of the projected dose intensity of all agents had significantly improved disease-free and overall survival. 
In-vitro DNA synthesis of keratinocytes in normal human skin, psoriasis, seborrhoeic keratosis, Bowen's disease and basal cell carcinoma. The DNA-synthesizing cells in benign and malignant keratotic diseases including psoriasis, seborrhoeic keratosis, Bowen's disease and basal cell carcinoma were studied. Cells in S-phase were labelled after small pieces of the lesions were incubated in tissue culture medium that contained 5-bromo-2'-deoxyuridine (BrdU). The labelling of DNA was analysed using the labelling index and pattern. Although the malignant diseases tended to show a higher DNA labelling index, neither this nor the loss of polarity alone was associated with malignancy. However, a higher DNA labelling index together with a loss of polarity was characteristic for malignancy. 
Disorders of the hair and scalp in children. A wide variety of disorders involving the scalp and hair exist that may be encountered in the pediatric and adolescent population. An approach to the differential diagnosis of many of these conditions can be considered once the patient is found to have either alopecia, scaling, or tumors of the scalp. Certainly other causes of scalp or hair disease exist but the more common disorders can be appropriately considered in this manner. 
Interactions between calcium channel blockers and the anticonvulsants carbamazepine and phenytoin. We describe a retrospective analysis of the frequency of adverse interactions between calcium channel blockers and anticonvulsant drugs (phenytoin and carbamazepine) in a series of 43 patients. Ten patients receiving carbamazepine and three patients receiving phenytoin exhibited symptoms or signs of toxicity. Toxicity occurred with both diltiazem and verapamil, but not with nifedipine. These results emphasize the need for careful clinical and laboratory monitoring of patients receiving both classes of medication. 
Early enteral nutrition after brain injury by percutaneous endoscopic gastrojejunostomy. Twenty-seven patients in a series of 52 patients with severe brain injury (Glasgow Coma Scale score less than or equal to 8) underwent insertion of intestinal feeding tubes at the bedside. The technique required endoscopy with externalization of gastric and intestinal ports through the abdominal wall. Feedings were begun through the intestinal tube with Vital HN within 4 hours of its insertion with simultaneous gastric decompression via the gastric tube. Tubes were placed 2.3 (range 0-5) days after injury. Full caloric intake (3020 kcal/24 h) was achieved by 6.8 (range 2-8) days after injury to 4.2 (range 2-8) days after placement of the feeding tube. Only 1 patient failed to tolerate feedings immediately after tube insertion. Technical inability to insert the tubes occurred in 3 patients and the intestinal tube migrated into the stomach in 2 patients; diarrhea occurred in only 1 patient. With this technique, it was possible to deliver an average daily intake of 1.2 g/kg of protein in 8-day balance periods beginning at the time of tube insertion. These data included 3- to 4-day periods in which feedings were steadily increased. In 16 patients in whom nitrogen balance was measured for 8-day balance periods, average nitrogen balance was -5.7 (range -11.3 to +3.5) g/24 h. The reduction in nitrogen loss by this technique appears equal to or superior to either gastric feeding or TPN. This technique provides the ability to enterally feed a high proportion of brain-injured patients (except those in barbiturate coma) very early after injury using a bedside procedure. 
Five-day bismuth-free triple therapy for the eradication of Helicobacter pylori and reduction of duodenal ulcer relapse. Previous studies have demonstrated that the eradication of Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) is associated with a significant reduction of the rate of duodenal ulcer (DU) relapse. The aim of this study was to assess the long-term effect of a bismuth-free triple therapy on the eradication of H. pylori and reduction of DU relapse. After informed consent, 61 patients with endoscopically proven DU and H. pylori infection detected on 14C-urea breath test (BT) were included in the study. All patients received a combination of furazolidone, amoxicillin, and metronidazole, three times a day, for 5 days, in addition to eventual classical antiulcer agents prescribed by their attending physicians. BT was repeated after an interval of at least 60 days to evaluate H. pylori eradication. Endoscopy and another BT were performed again at 6.5 months after therapy to detect possible recurrences. Forty-eight patients completed the trial: 26 (54%) patients were negative for H. pylori at 6.5 months after the end of treatment, and 22 (46%) persisted H. pylori positive. Ninety-two percent of the patients in whom the bacteria were eradicated showed endoscopically healed ulcers and were asymptomatic, and two that were symptomatic presented only occasional pain not requiring therapy. Among the 22 patients who persisted H. pylori positive, six (27%) showed endoscopically active ulcers (p = 0.012) and eight (36%) patients continued to be symptomatic (p less than 0.01), and were still using antiulcer drugs (p = 0.002) 6.5 months after treatment. It is concluded that combined treatment with furazolidone, amoxicillin, and metronidazole for 5 days represents a well-tolerated, inexpensive, and effective therapeutic regime for the eradication of H. pylori and abolition of DU relapse in more than 50% of the patients during a follow-up period of 6.5 months. 
Azygos vein laceration due to blunt trauma. The azygos vein ascends along the thoracic spine through the mediastinum and drains into the superior vena cava at the level of the fourth thoracic vertebra. Fracture-dislocation of the mid-thoracic spine, as a result of blunt thoracic trauma, can tear the azygos vein. Four such fatal cases (three motor vehicle accidents and one fall) were studied, only one of which was recognized prior to death. The vein can also be torn, in the absence of skeletal injuries, by horizontal acceleration/deceleration forces. The pathologist must consider azygos vein laceration as a possible cause of either hemothorax or hemomediastinum or both in a victim of a blunt chest trauma, if that individual had persistent hypotension during the few hours before death and no identifiable source of hemorrhage can be found postmortem in sites such as the heart, great vessels, lung, and chest wall. A fracture-dislocation of the thoracic spine may not necessarily be present. Azygos vein laceration seems to be an uncommon cause of hemothorax and hemomediastinum; however, this injury is probably more frequent than is implied by the few cases described in the medical literature. 
Indium-111-labeled B72.3 monoclonal antibody in the detection and staging of breast cancer: a phase I study. Sixteen patients with primary breast cancer were studied with a pancarcinoma monoclonal antibody B72.3, an IgG1 molecule directed against tumor-associated glycoprotein (TAG-72) present in several tumors. Five millicuries of 111In was used to label 0.2 mg (six patients), or 2 mg (six patients), or 20 mg using the site-directed bifunctional DTPA method (at carbohydrate moiety). Digital, planar, and SPECT images were obtained at 2, 48, 72 and 96 hr when possible. HAMA levels were obtained before the Mab infusion and at 1, 3, and 6 wk postinfusion. Fourteen of 14 known primary breast lesions were detected by imaging (100% sensitivity). Two fibrocystic lesions were negative. Seven of 14 patients had lymph node metastases by histologic methods, but all were missed by radioimmunoscintigraphy. Tumor uptake of Mab ranged 0.00054%-0.0038% of the ID/g. The tumor-to-normal breast tissue ratio was 4.3 +/- 0.91 (mean +/- s.e.m.). Lymph nodes localization of 111In-B72.3 by tissue analysis was similar for tumor-bearing and normal nodes (0.0039 +/- 0.0023 versus 0.0025 +/- 0.0019). Pharmacokinetics revealed mean plasma half-life of 33.3-41.2 hr for the different doses. There was no statistical difference between any of the pharmacokinetic parameters of different doses. HAMA was positive only in 17% of the patients. The study suggests that this antibody has 100% sensitivity for primary breast cancers, but very poor detection rate of metastatic lesions in axillary lymph nodes; thus making it of questionable value in the initial staging process of this disease. 
Prolactin and cortisol levels in various paroxysmal disorders in childhood. The hormonal response of the anterior pituitary to various epileptic and nonepileptic events in children was studied. Postictal serum prolactin and cortisol levels were measured in 17 children with epilepsy, 23 with febrile seizures, and 10 with syncope or breath-holding spells. The levels were compared with those of 30 children with nonspecific fever, and 23 afebrile children served as control subjects. Significantly higher (P less than .01) prolactin levels (26.5 +/- 3.3 ng/mL, mean +/- SEM) were found in the epileptic group, compared with levels in children with febrile seizures (13.2 +/- 1.0 ng/mL), fever (11.2 +/- 0.9 ng/mL), syncope (7.3 +/- 0.9 ng/mL), and the control group (7.9 +/- 0.6 ng/mL). In contrast, serum cortisol levels were nonspecifically elevated in the epileptics and patients with febrile seizures or fever only. These findings suggest that elevated prolactin levels may be found after epileptic seizures and much less after febrile seizures, but not after breath-holding spells or syncopal events. Cortisol secretion appears to be nonselectively triggered by all stressful events, such as epileptic and febrile seizures, and fever. Elevated prolactin levels (greater than 15 ng/mL) associated with seizures may help in differentiating epileptic from febrile seizures or syncope. 
Cytogenetic abnormalities associated with renal cell carcinoma. Cytogenetic analysis was performed on 23 renal cell carcinomas (21 sporadic and 2 associated with von Hippel-Lindau's disease). Clonal chromosomal abnormalities were found in 19 of 21 of the sporadic tumors. The most frequent abnormalities were a loss or rearrangement of material in 3p (11 of 21 cases) or an extra chromosome 7 (7 of 21 cases). Correlation between specific chromosomal abnormalities and clinical presentation was absent with the exception of trisomy 7 and -Y, which occurred only in patients more than 60 years old. An increasing number of cytogenetic abnormalities were associated with a greater likelihood of renal vein and/or capsule involvement. Both patients with von Hippel-Lindau's disease had tumors with a normal karyotype. 
Uncemented total hip arthroplasty. Prospective analysis of the tri-lock femoral component. Fifty consecutive hip disease patients (56 hips) with total hip arthroplasties (THA) utilized the uncemented Tri-Lock femoral component. Forty-five patients (51 hips) were followed for an average of 46 months (range, 24-66). Forty-two patients (47 hips) were followed with clinical examination and roentgenographs, three (four hips) by telephone interview, four (four hips) were deceased, and one (one hip) was lost to follow-up evaluation. The diagnoses included osteoarthritis (30 hips), avascular necrosis (11 hips), juvenile rheumatoid arthritis (two hips), and degenerative joint disease secondary to childhood hip disorder (four hips). Of 47 hips, 34 were graded excellent, seven good, three fair, and three poor using the Harris hip score. The incidence of thigh pain was 19% at one year, but only 6% at final follow-up evaluation. Limp persisted in 19% of the patients. Of the three patients with four hips contacted by telephone, two had slight pain and two had no pain. The roentgenographic results found an alarming 38% incidence of varus shift of the components, relative to their preoperative position. The presence of a varus shift did not adversely affect the clinical results. Early experience with the Tri-Lock femoral component shows results comparable to those reported in the literature. The high incidence of femoral component shift, presumably because of geometry of the stem is of concern. Longer follow-up evaluation will be necessary to determine the fate of these uncemented THA operations. 
Modulation of venous tone in heart failure. Venodilatation may be an important property in drugs used to treat heart failure. Deductions about venous tone from standard hemodynamic studies may be misleading since filling pressures may be reduced by improved left ventricular function. To study the venodilator properties of drugs, we have modified a radionuclide blood pool method and shown that venous volume is increased by 10% after glyceryl trinitrate but is unchanged after the arteriolar dilator hydralazine. In patients with congestive cardiac failure, the calcium channel blocker, felodipine, causes a marked reduction in systemic vascular resistance and left ventricular filling pressures, but venous volume remains unchanged. In a similar group of patients comparable arterial and central effects are seen after the administration of captopril, but venous volume increases by 16%, and this increased venous volume is sustained after 3 months of long-term treatment. Milrinone has been used to treat both acute and chronic heart failure. As expected of a phosphodiesterase inhibitor, it exhibits inotropic properties in animals and humans and also causes arterial vasodilatation. We have studied its effects on venous tone in 10 patients with severe heart failure (New York Heart Association classes III to IV). Milrinone was given intravenously at a loading dose of 50 micrograms/kg followed by an infusion of 0.5 micrograms/kg/min. After treatment, cardiac index, which was measured by thermodilution, increased from 1.8 +/- 0.48 to 2.3 +/- 0.65 L/min/m2 (p less than 0.001); pulmonary artery wedge pressure fell from 23 +/- 6 to 11 +/- 5 mm Hg (p less than 0.001); and systemic vascular resistance index decreased from 4296 to 3168 dynes.sec.cm-5/m2 (p less than 0.001). 
Suprahyoid pharyngotomy for oropharynx cancer including the tongue base. Suprahyoid pharyngotomy has been utilized as the standard approach to tongue base cancer not involving the larynx or mandible for the last 6 years at the Department of Veterans Affairs Medical Center, Boston, Mass. Review of 15 patients revealed that all had advanced disease (stage III and stage IV); 14 cases involved the tongue base, and one was on the posterior pharyngeal wall. By following the hyoepiglottic ligament, precise entry into the vallecula was routine. No injuries of vital neurovascular structures or compromised tumor margins were present; one tracheotomy was performed. Primary closure without the use of flaps was accomplished in 14 of 15 patients. No locoregional recurrences were found, with a median follow-up of 25 months. However, two patients died of another unrelated cancer, and two patients died of a myocardial infarction unrelated to their surgery. Suprahyoid pharyngotomy is a familiar approach often utilized during laryngectomy. In our experience, it provides excellent exposure of the oropharynx, can be combined with a transoral approach to avoid mandibulotomy without precluding this option, allows for simple reconstruction, and has a low complication rate. 
Mucosal humoral immune response to Helicobacter pylori in patients with duodenitis. The humoral immune response to Helicobacter pylori infection in the duodenum has been investigated by short-term in vitro culture, ELISA, and immunoblotting techniques. H. pylori IgA secretion by duodenal bulb biopsies was significantly increased (P less than 0.001) in patients with duodenitis. The IgA response to H. pylori in patients with duodenitis was restricted to the first part of the duodenum; second part duodenal biopsies secreting significantly (P less than 0.001) less IgA during culture in vitro. H. pylori IgG antibody secretion by cultured biopsies was also significantly increased (P less than 0.01) in patients with duodenitis and those with gastric H. pylori infection but without duodenitis. Immunoblotting of duodenal bulb culture supernatants showed positive recognition by the mucosal IgA response of H. pylori antigens in the region of 120, 90, 61, and 31-26 kDa in patients with duodenitis. Serologically, such patients showed little evidence of IgA H. pylori antibodies by immunoblotting. These results demonstrate that the inflammatory response in the duodenal mucosa of patients with duodenitis represents a specific highly localized humoral response to H. pylori. 
Fetal cephaloceles: diagnosis with US. The prenatal sonograms of 15 fetuses with cephaloceles (13 occipital, one ethmoidal, and one frontoparietal) were retrospectively reviewed. The prognosis for fetuses with cephaloceles was poor: Only three of 14 with follow-up were born alive (21%), and all are likely to be handicapped. Karyotypes were abnormal in four of nine fetuses tested (44%). Associated cranial abnormalities observed in various numbers of fetuses included ventriculomegaly, the "lemon" sign, a flat basioccipital, "beaked" tectum, and bone defect. A wide variety of neural and nonneural anomalies were associated with cephaloceles. At least one sonographically observed concomitant neural or nonneural axis abnormality or an abnormal karyotype was present in nine of 15 fetuses (60%). Some associated neural malformations noted pathologically were not observed prenatally. Cranial meningoceles were not accurately distinguished from encephaloceles sonographically, and they also were associated with a poor prognosis. Comparison of findings in fetuses with cephaloceles with those of 15 fetuses with cystic hygromas revealed that the two abnormalities can usually be distinguished by the relationship of the mass with the neck and by other cranial findings present in fetuses with cephaloceles but absent in association with cystic hygromas. 
Sodium restriction in hypertensive patients treated with a converting enzyme inhibitor and a thiazide. When the function of the renin system is inhibited, blood pressure becomes more dependent on changes in sodium and water balance. Diuretics alone and sodium restriction alone are additive to converting enzyme inhibitor therapy. However, it is not known if these two ways of reducing sodium balance are additive in the presence of established converting enzyme inhibition. We therefore performed a double-blind crossover study of the effects of moderate sodium restriction in 21 patients with essential hypertension who were already being treated with the combination of a converting enzyme inhibitor and a diuretic. After 1 month of captopril (50 mg twice daily) and hydrochlorothiazide (25 mg once daily) therapy, with their usual sodium intake, average supine blood pressure was 147/96 +/- 5/3 (SEM) mm Hg 2 hours after treatment. Patients then reduced their sodium intake to around 80-100 mmol/day for the remainder of the study. After 2 weeks of sodium restriction, they entered a double-blind, randomized, crossover study of Slow Sodium (100 mmol sodium/day) compared with Slow Sodium placebo, while continuing sodium restriction and the above treatment. During the double-blind study, after 1 month of treatment with captopril (50 mg twice daily), hydrochlorothiazide (25 mg once daily), and Slow Sodium placebo, supine blood pressure 2 hours after treatment was 138/88 +/- 4/2 mm Hg (24-hour urinary sodium 104 +/- 11 mmol). After 1 month of captopril (50 mg twice daily), hydrochlorothiazide (25 mg once daily), and Slow Sodium tablets, supine blood pressure 2 hours after treatment was 147/91 +/- 5/2 mm Hg (p less than 0.05; 24-hour urinary sodium 195 +/- 14 mmol). 
Some genetic aspects of idiopathic and symptomatic absence seizures: waking and sleep EEGs in siblings. Epileptic activity was recorded in the waking and sleep EEG of 62.5% of 80 siblings of 38 patients with absence seizures. Epileptic discharges were noted in waking only in 8.7%, in waking as well as sleep in 28.8%, and in sleep only in 25%. Generalized, partly irregular, and slow spike-wave complexes were found, twice with lateral emphasis. Spike-wave complexes were recorded in 72% of 50 siblings of patients with idiopathic absence and in 46.7% of 30 siblings of patients with symptomatic absence. One epileptic discharge was observed every 108.6 s on the average, without striking differences between siblings of patients with idiopathic (99.7 s) and symptomatic absence (119.3 s). Without any differences between siblings of children with idiopathic and symptomatic absence, the most epileptic discharges were activated in sleep stages C and D, followed by stages A and B. The highest activation rate was observed in the 7-14-year-old group (73.5%) and to a somewhat lesser degree in the group between 15 and 20 years of age (66.7%); fewer epileptic discharges were recorded in younger (25%) and older patients (28.6%). The higher activation rates in the male sex were significant only in siblings of patients with idiopathic absence. Although only five patients (13.2%) were photosensitive, a photosensitivity was found in 24% of siblings of children with idiopathic absence and in 20% of siblings of patients with symptomatic absence. Three siblings of patients with idiopathic absence also had absence seizures; in one of them a febrile seizure occurred at an earlier age. All of them showed generalized spike wave discharges in waking as well as sleep. Occipital theta delta activity with generalization was observed more frequently in siblings of patients with idiopathic absence (82.2%) than in those of patients with symptomatic absence (63.6%). Our waking and sleep EEG recordings prove that concerning etiology-genetic factors play a striking role in idiopathic absence, but are also of considerable significance in the symptomatic types. 
Resting pulse rate of children and young adults associated with blood pressure and other cardiovascular risk factors. Few researchers have investigated the resting pulse rate of children and young adults as a risk factor or indicator for subsequent cardiovascular morbidity in a representative sample of the total population. Data from the first National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey for persons ages 6-24 years revealed mean resting pulse rates that declined with age until ages 12-16, were higher in females than males, and in whites than blacks. At ages 12-17 and 18-24, blood pressure and body temperature showed consistent, independent, positive associations with pulse rate in whites. However, relatively little of the overall variation in pulse rate was explained by measured variables in multivariate regression analyses. Mother-child, age-specific correlation coefficients for pulse and blood pressure were generally positive. Further research is needed on the associations of resting pulse rate with sex, race, and blood pressure and with subsequent cardiovascular morbidity. 
Intestinal absorption of calcium and calcium metabolism in patients with essential hypertension and normal renal function. Several abnormalities of calcium metabolism have been described in patients with essential hypertension, and they have been linked to the pathogenesis of hypertension. Intestinal calcium absorption has been shown to be decreased in rats with spontaneous hypertension, but it has not been studied in patients with essential hypertension. In these studies we have for the first time measured intestinal absorption of calcium (using oral and intravenous administration of 47Ca), along with other parameters of calcium metabolism, in 14 patients with essential hypertension and normal renal function and in 16 normal subjects. There was no difference in serum total or ionized calcium, serum phosphorus, parathyroid hormone (PTH), 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D), 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D (1,25(OH)2D), and 24,25-dihydroxy-vitamin D(24,25(OH)2D) among hypertensives and normotensives. The urinary excretion of calcium, on the other hand, was greater in hypertensive than in normotensive subjects (195 +/- 33 v 107 +/- 13 mg/24 h, P less than .05). There was also no difference in intestinal absorption of calcium after 2 and 24 h among hypertensives and normotensives. When hypertensive patients were stratified according to plasma renin activity (PRA) we found that patients with low PRA had higher intestinal absorption of calcium at 2 h (23 +/- 2.9 v 18 +/- 0.6%, P less than .05) but not at 24 h. Serum total and ionized calcium, PTH, and 1,25(OH)2D were not different between patients with low and those with normal-high PRA. The major derangement of calcium metabolism in patients with essential hypertension is hypercalciuria. This abnormality is more pronounced in patients with low PRA, and it may lead to increased vitamin D-dependent intestinal absorption of calcium. 
Prolactin and cortisol levels in various paroxysmal disorders in childhood. The hormonal response of the anterior pituitary to various epileptic and nonepileptic events in children was studied. Postictal serum prolactin and cortisol levels were measured in 17 children with epilepsy, 23 with febrile seizures, and 10 with syncope or breath-holding spells. The levels were compared with those of 30 children with nonspecific fever, and 23 afebrile children served as control subjects. Significantly higher (P less than .01) prolactin levels (26.5 +/- 3.3 ng/mL, mean +/- SEM) were found in the epileptic group, compared with levels in children with febrile seizures (13.2 +/- 1.0 ng/mL), fever (11.2 +/- 0.9 ng/mL), syncope (7.3 +/- 0.9 ng/mL), and the control group (7.9 +/- 0.6 ng/mL). In contrast, serum cortisol levels were nonspecifically elevated in the epileptics and patients with febrile seizures or fever only. These findings suggest that elevated prolactin levels may be found after epileptic seizures and much less after febrile seizures, but not after breath-holding spells or syncopal events. Cortisol secretion appears to be nonselectively triggered by all stressful events, such as epileptic and febrile seizures, and fever. Elevated prolactin levels (greater than 15 ng/mL) associated with seizures may help in differentiating epileptic from febrile seizures or syncope. 
Evolution of myocardial ischemia and left ventricular function in patients with angina pectoris without myocardial infarction and total occlusion of the left anterior descending coronary artery and collaterals from other coronary arteries. Repeated episodes of myocardial ischemia might lead to progressive impairment of left ventricular (LV) function. This radionuclide study assessed myocardial ischemia and LV function several years after documented coronary occlusion without myocardial infarction. Over 5 years, 24 consecutive patients, who underwent cardiac catheterization for angina pectoris without myocardial infarction, had isolated total occlusion of the left anterior descending coronary artery with well-developed collateral vessels. Five patients were successfully treated by coronary bypass grafting and 3 by coronary angioplasty. Among the 16 medically treated patients, 1 was lost to follow-up and 1 died (extracardiac death). The mean (+/- standard deviation) follow-up (14 patients) was 48 +/- 15 months. At follow-up, 8 patients still had clinical chest pain, 11 received antianginal therapy, 4 patients had no stress ischemia and the other 10 had greater than or equal to 1 sign of stress ischemia. All patients had a normal LV ejection fraction at rest (mean 60 +/- 3%; range 55 to 65%). Collateral circulation preserves LV function at the time of occlusion and, in some cases, prevents the development of myocardial ischemia; in patients with persisting myocardial ischemia after well-collateralized coronary occlusion, LV function is not impaired at long-term follow-up. 
Treatment of organic impotence. A review of 86 patients referred to a urological clinic with impotence showed that in 58% the causation was predominantly psychogenic. These patients were managed with psychosexual counselling. The various treatment options were discussed with those patients with organic impotence and 14 underwent the implantation of a penile prosthesis. A review of 130 patients who received penile prostheses in the period 1983 to 1987 was carried out to compare the complications and results obtained with the various types of prosthesis. The overall satisfaction rate was 81%; dissatisfaction usually arose as a result of complications of surgery. These were highest in patients with diabetes and priapism. The complications were also related to the type of prosthesis used. 
Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and antihypertensives. Approximately 60 million people in the United States have hypertension (BP greater than or equal to 140/90 mm Hg), 40 million have arthritis clinically suitable for nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) therapy, and millions take NSAIDs for nonarthritic conditions, creating considerable potential for concomitant administration of NSAIDs and antihypertensive agents. It is estimated that more than 20 million people are on concurrent therapy. Most NSAIDs produce mild elevations of normal blood pressure levels and can partially or completely antagonize the effects of many antihypertensive drugs. The effect on blood pressure can vary from no effect to hypertensive crisis. In pooled studies, the average increase in mean arterial pressure was 10 mm Hg, and duration was short-lived or chronic. Significant interactions occur in about 1% of patients per year. The risk is greatest in the elderly, blacks, and patients with low-renin hypertension. NSAIDs may block the antihypertensive effects of thiazide and loop diuretics, beta-adrenergic blockers, alpha-adrenergic blockers, and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors. No interactions have been reported with centrally acting alpha agonists or the calcium channel blockers. The mechanism of the hypertensive effects of NSAIDs seem primarily related to their ability to block the cyclo-oxygenase pathway of arachidonic acid metabolism, with a resultant decrease in prostaglandin formation. The prostaglandins are important in normal modulation of renal and systemic vascular dilatation, glomerular filtration, tubular secretion of salt and water, adrenergic neurotransmission, and the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system. Blockade of salutary effects of prostaglandins by NSAIDs results in a complex series of events culminating in attenuation of the effects of many antihypertensive agents. High-risk patients treated with NSAIDs should be identified and have blood pressure, renal function, and serum potassium frequently monitored. 
Usefulness of flecainide for prevention of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation and flutter. Danish-Norwegian Flecainide Multicenter Study Group. To evaluate the efficacy of flecainide acetate in the prevention of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation and flutter, 43 patients (23 men) (mean age 53 years) were randomized blindly to receive either placebo or 150 mg of flecainide twice per day for consecutive periods of 3 months. Attacks were verified by a minielectrocardiogram event recorder. If intolerable symptoms developed, the protocol allowed patients to cross over between treatments before the end of the first 3-month period. Four patients crossed over prematurely, between 1 week and 1 month, and 15 between 1 month and 3 months. The remaining 24 patients completed both 3-month periods. In all 3 treatment intervals, there was a significant reduction in the number of attacks during flecainide treatment (p less than 0.002). Complete suppression was seen in 15 of 43 patients (35%) treated with flecainide for 1 week, in 18 of 39 (46%) treated for 1 month and in 12 of 24 (50%) completing all 3 months in each period. Adverse effects were reported in 32 of the 43 patients (74%) treated with flecainide, but only 2 were withdrawals. One patient died suddenly. In comparison, 3 of 43 patients (7%) reported adverse effects in the placebo group. In conclusion, flecainide significantly suppressed the number of attacks of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation and flutter. Adverse effects were frequent but were mostly tolerable. 
Mortality and morbidity in patients receiving encainide, flecainide, or placebo. The Cardiac Arrhythmia Suppression Trial. BACKGROUND AND METHODS. In the Cardiac Arrhythmia Suppression Trial, designed to test the hypothesis that suppression of ventricular ectopy after a myocardial infarction reduces the incidence of sudden death, patients in whom ventricular ectopy could be suppressed with encainide, flecainide, or moricizine were randomly assigned to receive either active drug or placebo. The use of encainide and flecainide was discontinued because of excess mortality. We examined the mortality and morbidity after randomization to encainide or flecainide or their respective placebo. RESULTS. Of 1498 patients, 857 were assigned to receive encainide or its placebo (432 to active drug and 425 to placebo) and 641 were assigned to receive flecainide or its placebo (323 to active drug and 318 to placebo). After a mean follow-up of 10 months, 89 patients had died: 59 of arrhythmia (43 receiving drug vs. 16 receiving placebo; P = 0.0004), 22 of nonarrhythmic cardiac causes (17 receiving drug vs. 5 receiving placebo; P = 0.01), and 8 of noncardiac causes (3 receiving drug vs. 5 receiving placebo). Almost all cardiac deaths not due to arrhythmia were attributed to acute myocardial infarction with shock (11 patients receiving drug and 3 receiving placebo) or to chronic congestive heart failure (4 receiving drug and 2 receiving placebo). There were no differences between the patients receiving active drug and those receiving placebo in the incidence of nonlethal disqualifying ventricular tachycardia, proarrhythmia, syncope, need for a permanent pacemaker, congestive heart failure, recurrent myocardial infarction, angina, or need for coronary-artery bypass grafting or angioplasty. CONCLUSIONS. There was an excess of deaths due to arrhythmia and deaths due to shock after acute recurrent myocardial infarction in patients treated with encainide or flecainide. Nonlethal events, however, were equally distributed between the active-drug and placebo groups. The mechanisms underlying the excess mortality during treatment with encainide or flecainide remain unknown. 
Hypoxemic stimulation of heart glycogen synthase and synthesis. Effects of insulin and diabetes mellitus. With radiotracer and 13C nuclear magnetic resonance (13C-NMR) methods, we studied the time course of glycogen resynthesis after three 90-s episodes of hypoxemia in both control and diabetic rats in vivo. Glycogen synthesis was measured in the presence and absence of infused insulin and compared with the changes in glycogen synthase (GS) and phosphorylase activities. We observed in 13C-NMR spectra the expected mobilization of glycogen during hypoxia in vivo. In control rats with or without exogenous insulin, this was followed by a rapid resynthesis of glycogen during a 40-min recovery period. A marked activation of GS was observed by 10 min (glucose-6-phosphate-independent form of GS [GSl] = 0.65 mumol.min-1.g-1 or 92% of total GS), and activation persisted up to 40 min in both groups. Glycogen synthesis during the recovery period averaged 0.51 and 0.45 mumol.min-1.g-1 in the saline- and insulin-treated rats, respectively. In the diabetic rats by 10 min after hypoxemia, GSl increased only modestly in both saline-treated (0.16 mumol.min-1.g-1) and insulin-treated (0.21 mumol.min-1.g-1) rats, and activation persisted up to 40 min only with insulin treatment. Glycogen synthesis was slower in the diabetic rats given insulin (0.28 mumol.min-1.g-1) and essentially absent in the saline-treated rats (0.03 mumol.min-1.g-1) compared with controls. We conclude that recovery from hypoxemia is accompanied by a marked activation of GSl and rapid rates of glycogen synthesis in nondiabetic rats, and diabetes markedly blunts this response. Acute insulin infusion only partially overcomes this block. 
Stability of buffered lidocaine and epinephrine used for local anesthesia. Buffered lidocaine has been recently recommended for local anesthesia, as there is less pain on injection of the buffered solution. Reduced pain on injection of lidocaine and epinephrine buffered to a neutral pH was confirmed in 20 subjects (P less than .01). Concentrations of buffered lidocaine and epinephrine were performed in order to evaluate their stability. Buffered lidocaine dropped to 66.1% of initial concentrations after 4 weeks when stored at 25 degrees C. Buffered epinephrine fell to 1.34% of its initial concentration under similar conditions. Buffered lidocaine and epinephrine maintained 94.54% and 82.04%, respectively, of their initial concentrations after 4 weeks when refrigerated at 0-4 degrees C. Both lidocaine and epinephrine maintained greater than 90% concentration 2 weeks after buffering when stored at 0-4 degrees C. This permits batch buffering of lidocaine with epinephrine and storage for periods up to 2 weeks when properly refrigerated. 
Association of sustained oxyhemoglobin desaturation and onset of cluster headache attacks. Ten episodic cluster headache patients in their active cluster period, ten patients in remission and five control subjects were monitored for minute to minute changes in oxygen saturation (SaO2) and pulse rate before and after nitroglycerin (NTG) administration. A transient but significant decrease in SaO2 and increase in pulse rate of 25 minutes duration occurred following NTG in all groups. These changes may reflect physiologic hemodynamic effects of NTG as a smooth muscle relaxant. Subsequently, SaO2 levels and pulse rate recovered to baseline values in remission and control groups. In contrast, SaO2 values in the active cluster group decreased further and after an extended period culminated in cluster headache attacks in 10/10 patients. Three major changes, therefore, distinguished active cluster patients from remission and control groups. First, the magnitude of oxygen desaturation increased after the physiological effects of NTG ceased. Second, oxygen desaturation was sustained for an additional 9 to 30 minutes duration. Third, the hypoxemic state culminated in attacks in all cases. Our findings suggest that the active cluster period may be characterized by an impaired mechanism to autoregulate, and thus compensate, for hypoxemia. It is further proposed that persistence of hypoxemia and the cluster attack onset may share a common mechanism, coupling the two events. We suggest that abnormal central and/or peripheral chemoreceptor activity may be responsible for these events. 
Germ-line deletions of mtDNA in mitochondrial myopathy. mtDNA encodes subunits of the electron transport chain and is exclusively maternally inherited in mammals. It has been suggested that mtDNA might be the site of some of the mutations causing a group of human disorders called the "mitochondrial myopathies," because these may both be (1) accompanied by defects in the electron transport chain and (2) display a maternal pattern of inheritance. However, all of the deletions and duplications of mtDNA which occur in these patients have been sporadic, apart from families in whom affected members all carry different deletions suggesting a mutant autosomal dominantly inherited nuclear gene with de novo deletions in each individual. We present the first evidence for the presence of deleted mtDNAs in the germ line in these disorders. The patient carries a higher level of deleted mtDNAs than do his relatives, corresponding to severity of symptoms and consistent with a predicted dosage effect. "Selfishness" of deleted mtDNAs is probably one of the factors over and above random segregation of a small number of "founder" mtDNAs (the bottleneck hypothesis) which may be invoked to explain the usual distribution of mtDNAs in different tissues of patients with mtDNA deletions. 
Long-term mental health effects of a pediatric home care program. The increased survival of youngsters with chronic physical disorders has led to concern about their long-term psychological adjustment. Few data are available on how to reduce the psychological morbidity that occurs in the presence of chronic childhood illness. An earlier report of a randomized controlled trial of a pediatric home care program demonstrated that this program, combining comprehensive biomedical and psychosocial care, reduced the short-term psychological morbidity of those receiving home care. However, data have not previously been available on whether the short-term improvement in adjustment is associated with any long-term benefits. This report presents long-term follow-up data collected 4 1/2 to 5 years after enrollment on 68% of the original sample. After this interval there were even larger differences between the experimental and control groups than those previously observed at 6 months and 1 year. This finding provides strong evidence that a comprehensive family-oriented outreach program for youngsters with chronic physical disorders can have long-term mental health benefits. It should encourage clinicians to develop similar programs and investigators to look for long-term effects of other interventions. 
Sarcoidosis of the nervous system. A clinical approach. Sarcoidosis is a multisystem disorder of unknown cause. The disease is characterized by the presence of noncaseating granulomas in the affected tissue system. Clinically recognizable nervous system involvement occurs in about 10% of patients with sarcoidosis, although the incidence of subclinical neurosarcoidosis is much higher. The disease appears in the differential diagnosis of many infectious and noninfectious neurological syndromes. We have reviewed all aspects of neurosarcoidosis from the point of view of practicing internists, including the clinical manifestations, cerebrospinal fluid and radiographic changes, differential diagnosis, and treatment. 
The sequential generation of neutrophil chemoattractant proteins in acute inflammation in the rabbit in vivo. Relationship between C5a and proteins with the characteristics of IL-8/neutrophil-activating protein 1. An in vivo experimental peritonitis model was investigated in the rabbit using zymosan as the inflammatory stimulus. After an i.p. injection of zymosan, exudate was removed at intervals and tested in the back skin of assay rabbits. Assay rabbits received i.v. injections of 125I-albumin and 111In-neutrophils, and the local accumulation of each label was measured in response to intradermal injections of exudate samples mixed with a potentiating dose of PGE2. When peritoneal exudate samples were tested in the presence of a specific anti-C5a antibody, virtually all the edema-inducing and neutrophil chemoattractant activity was abolished in samples taken up to 2 h after the zymosan injection. Later samples, however, contained increasing levels of a non-C5a component. In C5a-depleted 6-h exudate two peaks of inflammatory activity were separated using cation exchange HPLC. Evidence is presented that C5a itself is unable to stimulate the production of these activities. Both peaks of activity appear related to IL-8/NAP-1 as they inhibited the binding of 125I-IL-8/NAP-1 to human neutrophils. 
Studies on corticosteroid therapy in Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada disease. We evaluated the significance of corticosteroid therapy on 47 new patients with Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada disease examined in the Uveitis Survey Clinic of the Hokkaido University Hospital. All patients were treated with topical corticosteroids, with or without systemic corticosteroids. 18 patients received systemic corticosteroid as pulse therapy, 20 patients received high-dose corticosteroid starting with prednisolone 200 mg, 2 patients received conventional-dose corticosteroid and 7 patients received no systemic corticosteroid therapy. When we evaluated the results 6 months after the initiation of treatment, anterior chamber inflammation was significantly less in patients with pulse and high-dose corticosteroid therapy than in those without systemic corticosteroid therapy. Furthermore, final visual acuity was significantly better in patients with pulse and high-dose corticosteroid than in those without them. However, there was no significant difference between patients with pulse therapy and those with high-dose corticosteroid therapy. The findings are in support of systemic corticosteroid therapy (pulse and high-dose) in the treatment of Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada disease. 
End-tidal CO2 monitoring in mitral stenosis patients undergoing closed mitral commissurotomy. Arterial to end-tidal carbon dioxide difference (P(a-E')CO2) was recorded in 20 mitral stenosis patients (group A) for closed mitral commissurotomy and 20 healthy individuals (group B) for elective limb surgery. Mitral stenosis patients showed a greater difference than group B patients. Repeated measurements of P(a-E')CO2 in mitral stenosis patients at various stages of closed mitral commissurotomy not only showed a mean increase from before thoracotomy but there was also no correlation between P(a-E')CO2 before thoracotomy with that after thoracotomy, after commissurotomy or after chest closure. This indicated that end-tidal CO2 monitoring was unsuitable to measure adequacy of ventilation during closed mitral commissurotomy. 
The possible influence of antibiotics on results of bacillus Calmette-Guerin intravesical therapy for superficial bladder cancer. Intravesical treatment with Bacillus Calmette-Guerin is an established treatment of carcinoma in situ and an effective prophylaxis for the prevention of recurrence of transitional cell carcinoma. During instillation therapy oral antibiotics may be used to prevent or to treat urinary tract infections. Tuberculostatic agents are employed to prevent or to treat local irritative symptoms and systemic side effects caused by Bacillus Calmette-Guerin. We investigated the susceptibility of four different Bacillus Calmette-Guerin preparations to 18 antibiotics and to 11 tuberculostatic agents in vitro. All preparations were equally susceptible to most of the commonly used antibiotics and to all of the tuberculostatic agents with the exception of pyrazinamide. Our results suggest that in the absence of cystitis, instillations should not be accompanied by antibiotics because of the possible inhibition of antitumor efficacy by eradication of living Bacillus Calmette-Guerin organisms. The same inhibition may occur when tuberculostatic agents are used to prevent local and systemic complications of Bacillus Calmette-Guerin instillation therapy. 
An unusual angiographic picture in status migrainosus. Arteriographic findings suggestive of inflammation are described in a 26-year-old woman presenting with headache and syncope. There were no clinical findings of angitis, and a diagnosis of status migrainosus was eventually made. We present her case, as well as a review of previous cases of arterial changes in patients with headache. Most previous cases report arterial narrowing, felt to reflect spasm, whereas our patient demonstrated segmental stenoses and dilatations, perhaps implicating inflammation. The inflammatory process has been postulated as the pathogenesis of migraine pain. As most migraineurs do not undergo arteriography, the incidence of arterial change in these patients is unknown. This finding has therapeutic implications for selecting the optimal anti-migraine agent. 
Serum and tissue autoantibodies to colonic epithelium in ulcerative colitis. Sera and colonic tissue-bound immunoglobulin extracts from patients with ulcerative colitis and disease controls were examined immunohistochemically and by killer cell cytotoxicity assay for the presence of anticolonic epithelial autoantibodies. IgG yields in the tissue extracts from patients with colitis and control subjects were similar, and the extracts were uniformly autoantibody negative. Of 41 sera from patients with inflammatory bowel disease, 'classical' anticolon antibody was present in 41% and was commoner in patients with sclerosing cholangitis. Cytotoxic anticolon antibody was present in 20% overall and was strongly associated with disease activity; it did not correlate with the presence of 'classical' anticolon antibody. The heterogeneous and non-universal antiepithelial autoantibody response and the failure to detect tissue bound autoantibody in vivo argue against the hypothesis that humoral autoimmunity is of major importance in the pathogenesis of ulcerative colitis. 
Rapid development of resistance to antifolates in vitro: possible clinical implication. Within three repeated 7-day incubation periods with either methotrexate (MTX) or trimetrexate (TMTX), human colon adenocarcinoma cells (HCT-8) developed high levels of resistance to these drugs, as evidenced by approximately 20- and 50-fold increases, respectively, in the median effective doses. Similarly, within six short-term exposures (4 hours) to the same drugs, a high degree of resistance developed in the cells. Alternating 4-hour treatment cycles with MTX and TMTX did not delay the onset of resistance to these antimetabolites in the HCT-8 cells. The same strategy produced no better results than giving either MTX or TMTX alone to (C57BL/6 x DBA/2)F1 mice bearing murine leukemia P388 cells. Furthermore, HCT-8 cells resistant to short-term (4-hour) exposure to MTX were cross-resistant to the same drug given for 7 days continuously, and cells resistant to MTX given continuously for 7 days were cross-resistant to the same drug given for 4 hours. Analogous results were obtained with TMTX, indicating that, under these circumstances, changing the schedule of administration of the same agent does not overcome resistance to it. The clinical relevance of these data to prolonged adjuvant chemotherapy, as well as loco-regional and continuous-infusion chemotherapy, is discussed. 
Inhibition of mineralization of glutaraldehyde-pretreated bovine pericardium by AlCl3. Mechanisms and comparisons with FeCl3, LaCl3, and Ga(NO3)3 in rat subdermal model studies. In the present study, the authors investigated the mechanism by which Al3+ preincubations inhibited the pathologic calcification of glutaraldehyde-pretreated bovine pericardium (GPBP) implanted subdermally in rats. The concentration dependency of the Al3+ anticalcification effect was compared with that of other trivalent metal ions (Fe3+, Ga3+, La3+) known to interact with calcium phosphates. In vitro incubations of GPBP were carried out in AlCl3 (10(-3) mol/l [molar] to 10(-1) mol/l) to ascertain both the optimal conditions for uptake of Al3+ and the time course of Al3+ dissociation. Al3+ uptake by GPBP was concentration dependent and occurred rapidly, with tissue levels after 1 hour not differing significantly from those after 72 hours of incubation. Analyses of GPBP samples preincubated in AlCl3 (0.1 mol/l, 24 hours) showed that more than 75% of the Al3+ remained tightly bound after 60 days' in vitro release at 37 degrees C, pH 7.4. Preincubations of GPBP in AlCl3 significantly inhibited calcification after subdermal implantation in rats for 60 days (Ca++ = 5.1 +/- 0.9 microgram/mg, 11.5 +/- 4.6 micrograms/mg, 70.3 +/- 23.0 micrograms/mg, mean +/- standard error [SE], for 10(-1) mol/l, 10(-2) mol/l, 10(-3) mol/l AlCl3, respectively), compared with controls (Ca++ = 110.0 +/- 9.3 micrograms/mg). All animals were free of Al3(+)-mediated adverse effects on bone, as determined by light microscopic evaluation of femoral epiphyseal growth plates. Transmission electron microscopy coupled with electron energy loss spectroscopy (EELS) of GPBP incubated in 10(-1) mol l AlCl3 for 24 hours demonstrated discrete Al3+ localization in the sarcolemma and cytoplasmic and nuclear membranes of devitalized pericardial connective tissue cells at intracellular sites coincident with phosphorus loci. Similar intracellular localization remained prominent in explants removed after 60 days; no calcific deposits were noted in these specimens. Preincubations in Fe3+ but not Ga3+ and La3+ solutions yielded significant inhibition of GPBP calcification, which did not differ significantly from that provided by Al3- and had a comparable concentration dependency. Light microscopic examination (Prussian blue staining) and EELS of FeCl3-preincubated explants demonstrated Fe3+ localization within devitalized GPBP connective tissue cells. The authors conclude that Al3+ and Fe3+ significantly inhibit the pathologic mineralization of glutaraldehyde-pretreated bovine pericardium by mechanisms that are likely related to the high affinity of these cations for membrane associated and other intracellular phosphorus loci. 
What value is given to quality of life assessment by health professionals considering response to palliative chemotherapy for advanced cancer? A study was designed to obtain information on the importance of quality of life assessment (QL) during palliative chemotherapy. A questionnaire was answered by 542 health professionals (392 general practitioners, 20 specialist oncologists, and 130 oncology nurses). In both simulated patient situations and multiple-choice questions, all groups rated QL higher than other standard methods of assessment. General practitioners and oncologists appeared to weight the assessment criteria more equally than nurses who gave strong emphasis to QL. In the simulated patient situation, there was a small degree of interaction between QL and other assessment criteria. However, the analysis showed that QL was regarded as an independent variable and was considered to be the most important objective of palliative chemotherapy for advanced cancer. 
Cystic cerebellar schwannoma: case report. We report a case of cerebellar schwannoma in a 64-year-old woman. The tumor was defined on computed tomographic and magnetic resonance imaging scans and confirmed on surgery. The solid part of the tumor appeared to be derived from the inferior vermis of the cerebellum, the cystic part extending toward the medulla oblongata and the foramen magnum. The problem of preoperative diagnosis based on magnetic resonance imaging findings is discussed. 
Acute effects of delayed reperfusion on myocardial infarct shape and left ventricular volume: a potential mechanism of additional benefits from thrombolytic therapy. The purpose of this study was to characterize the effects of late reperfusion on myocardial infarct shape and to quantitate associated changes in left ventricular volume. Reperfusion was delayed until there was no salvage of ischemic myocardium. Dogs underwent 6.5 h of left anterior descending coronary artery occlusion (n = 5) or 5.5 h of occlusion and 1 h of reperfusion (n = 5). Infarct shape was measured with pairs of ultrasonic crystals implanted circumferentially in the mid myocardium. Infarct stiffness was determined from end-diastolic pressure-segment length curves produced by aortic clamping. Left ventricular volume was measured with three pairs of endocardial ultrasonic crystals and the effect of infarct shape change on left ventricular volume was determined. Infarct size, expressed as a percent of the area at risk, was similar in reperfused (97 +/- 1%) and nonreperfused (98 +/- 1%) hearts. After coronary artery occlusion, infarct segments became akinetic and functional dilation, measured as end-diastolic ultrasonic crystal separation, increased to a similar extent in reperfused (24 +/- 7%) and nonreperfused (19 +/- 3%) hearts. In 13 additional dogs that underwent reperfusion and instrumentation with endocardial ultrasonic crystals for volume measurement, left ventricular volume increased 42 +/- 6% over the preocclusion level (p less than 0.001). Within minutes of reperfusion, the infarct stiffened, infarct dilation decreased to 1 +/- 4% over the baseline preocclusion level (p less than 0.05 vs. prereperfusion) and left ventricular volume decreased to 16 +/- 11% over the baseline level (p less than 0.01 vs. postocclusion). Thus, coronary artery reperfusion reverses initial infarct dilation. Changes in infarct dilation occur immediately after reperfusion and are accompanied by infarct stiffening and a decrease in left ventricular volume. Reperfusion can affect infarct shape and stiffness at a point in time when myocardial salvage is no longer possible. 
Pain in neonatal circumcision. Because newborn circumcision is a quick and safe surgical procedure, any method to relieve pain must be almost risk-free in order to be acceptable. General anesthesia and narcotic analgesia are not appropriate. Dorsal penile nerve block (DPNB) with lidocaine hydrochloride is probably the most effective and safest form of anesthesia for newborn circumcision currently available, but it can cause significant local and systemic reactions. Only a limited number of cases of DPNB have been reported and we feel that this procedure should be used cautiously until there is more published evidence of its safety. Alternative methods of pain relief including oral acetaminophen and topical anesthesia should also be studied. Of special interest is recent evidence that a sucrose-flavored pacifier is an effective analgesic during newborn circumcision. 
Stereotaxic implantation of autologous adrenal medulla into caudate nucleus in four patients with parkinsonism. One-year follow-up. Four patients with levodopa-responsive parkinsonism (aged 26, 35, 45, and 49 years) received autologous adrenal medullary implants into or near the left caudate nucleus by stereotaxic implantation after flank adrenalectomy. All patients had an immediate response to implantation lasting several days, during which parkinsonian signs and symptoms decreased. This period was followed by a gradual reappearance of symptoms in all but one patient. This patient had had a dramatic increase in "on" time without dyskinesias and a decrease in the severity and duration of "off" time. He died of multifocal glioblastoma 1 year after transplantation. Autopsy revealed no surviving adrenal cells. In one case, the stereotaxic implantation missed the basal ganglia, resulting in the placement of the adrenal medullary tissue into the medial thalamus and near the third ventricle; the patient did not improve. In the other two cases, a modest but definite increase in "on" time without dyskinesia and a reduction in the severity and duration of "off" time has been observed. The role of autologous adrenal medullary transplantation in patients with parkinsonism remains to be determined. Patients with a family history of cerebral malignancy may be at increased risk for the development of transplant-induced malignancy. 
Effect of aluminized covers on body temperature in patients having abdominal surgery. An unintended fall in body temperature is commonly associated with surgery. One promising strategy to help conserve body heat is use of covers made of aluminum-coated plastic. We compared the effect of three combinations of the covers (head cover, body covers, both) and a control condition on tympanic temperature in 60 adults having major abdominal surgery under general anesthesia. The covers were applied from the time of transport to the operating room until exit from the postanesthesia care unit (PACU). Tympanic temperature was measured with an infrared thermometer. Between transport and PACU entry, the four groups had mean temperature decreases ranging from 1.6 degrees to 2.3 degrees F (0.9 degree to 1.3 degrees C). After controlling for background variables affecting body temperature, adjusted PACU entry temperature was higher in the two groups with aluminized body covers. Regression analysis showed that use of the body covers accounted for 7% of the temperature variance at PACU entry and predicted a 0.9 degree F (0.5 degree C) higher temperature at that time. These findings indicate that aluminized body covers help to reduce heat loss in patients having major abdominal surgery. 
Recurring catamenial pneumothorax treated with a Gn-RH analogue. We report a case of recurring catamenial pneumothorax with concurrent pelvic endometriosis. Thoracoscopy revealed a blue-like lesion on top of the dome of the right hemidiaphragm. Microscopic examination of biopsy specimens showed endometriosis. The patient was treated with a Gn-RH analogue and remains well without further evidence of pneumothorax after six months. 
Endogenous IFN-gamma is required for resistance to acute Trypanosoma cruzi infection in mice. In order to study the role of endogenous IFN-gamma in Trypanosoma cruzi infection in mice, a potent murine IFN-gamma-specific mAb was injected i.p. on days -1, 7, and 14, relative to infection. Irrespective of the parasite inocula (100 or 25,000), groups of antibody-treated mice had significantly greater cumulative mortality rates than did appropriate controls. In antibody-treated mice, mean survival times were also significantly shorter, and maximum mean parasitemia levels were significantly higher, than in controls. Moreover, the number of amastigote nests in tissues was higher than in control mice and attained a maximum at the same time as parasitemia. As evident from kinetic studies of neutralizing activity, injected mAb were rapidly consumed in infected, but not in noninfected, mice, which is suggestive of massive IFN-gamma production during the early parasitemic phase of the disease. Nevertheless, IFN-gamma remained undetectable in the sera of infected but untreated mice. Unexpectedly, however, a peak of IFN-like antiviral activity, characterizable as a mixture of IFN-gamma and IFN-beta, appeared in mAb-treated mice that survived to infection at a time when neutralizing activity of injected mAb had drastically decreased in the circulation. We hypothesize that this high level of artificially induced endogenous IFN-gamma, not neutralized by the amounts of injected mAb, was due to the more intense parasite multiplication occurring in mAb-treated mice, which in turn may have induced an increased amount of various cytokines. TNF-alpha was not found in the serum of our mice. The humoral immune response entered its exponential phase at a time point later than that when protection by endogenous IFN-gamma was evident. Treatment with IFN-gamma-specific antibody, as applied in our study, failed to affect the level of different Ig isotypes or of T. cruzi-specific antibodies. Our study clearly indicates that IFN-gamma is produced early in acute T. cruzi infection and exerts a protective effect that is probably independent from the humoral immune response. 
Long-term observation after intravesical metaphylaxis with mitomycin C in patients with superficial bladder tumors. After transurethral resection of a superficial bladder tumor 63 patients were treated by chemoprophylaxis with mitomycin C over a period of two years: 33.3 percent experienced recurrent disease under metaphylaxis and 42 patients who remained recurrence-free during instillation therapy were observed further for an average of 26.4 months. During this period 26.2 percent of the patients showed recurrences ranging between two to forty-four months after completing instillation. The majority of the patients in whom recurrent tumors developed also had recurrent tumor processes before the instillation therapy was begun. Of the 42 patients 73.8 percent stayed recurrence-free during the observation period of twelve to fifty-four months after completing instillation therapy. In conclusion, during an average observation period of 50.4 months, 52.4 percent of the patients in this study showed recurrences. 
Gastroesophageal reflux disease as a cause of chest pain. Patients with recurrent chest pain free of significant coronary artery disease account for 10% to 30% of patients undergoing coronary angiography. Recent studies suggest that gastroesophageal reflux disease may be very common in these patients. The cause of this chest pain seems to be related primarily to an acid-sensitive mucosa regardless of the presence of esophagitis. Unfortunately, a careful history will not distinguish chest pain arising from a cardiac versus an esophageal source. Therefore, all patients must undergo a thorough cardiac evaluation before assuming that acid reflux is the cause of their complaints. Initial gastroenterology evaluation will usually include upper GI endoscopy or barium studies, possibly with acid perfusion (Bernstein) testing, or both. However, the more sensitive and specific test for acid-related disease is prolonged esophageal pH monitoring. This study quantifies the amount of acid reflux but, more importantly, identifies the relationship between chest pain and acid reflux episodes. Patients should be studied in the outpatient setting with emphasis placed on performing activities that replicate their chest pain. Although we presume that acid-induced chest pain responds as well as heartburn to vigorous antireflux regimens, there are few studies to address this issue. Nevertheless, I have had great success in treating these patients with either high-dose H2 blockers or omeprazole therapy. 
Cancer mortality, aging, and patterns of comorbidity in the United States: 1968 to 1986. Cancer is often reported as contributing to the risk of noncancer causes of death. The age variation of these reports was studied using U.S. data on all causes of death listed on death certificates for 1968 to 1986. The occurrence of cancer as a nonunderlying cause of death increased with age and was higher for treatable and slowly growing tumor types. These patterns persisted even if the cancer manifested changes in occurrence. Nonunderlying occurrences were highest in the 85 to 94 age group and were correlated with cancer survival. This suggests increased importance of cancer as a cause of death and a comorbid condition among oldest-old persons. The high rate of occurrence as an associated cause of death suggests that if life expectancy increases due to declines in circulatory and other chronic disease mortality, cancer could become the preeminent cause of death in the United States. 
Anterior transpetrosal-transtentorial approach for sphenopetroclival meningiomas: surgical method and results in 10 patients. This report presents a new surgical method and the results in 10 patients with petroclival meningiomas extending into the parasellar region (sphenopetroclival meningiomas). Minimal but effective extradural resection of the anterior petrous bone via a middle fossa craniotomy offered a direct view of the clival area with preservation of the temporal bridging veins and cochlear organs. The dural incision was extended anteriorly to Meckel's cave, and in cases with invasion of the cavernous sinus, Parkinson's triangle was enlarged by mobilization of the trigeminal nerve. This approach offered an excellent view from the mid-clivus to the cavernous sinus. Extra-as well as intradural tumor masses and dural attachments could be cleared under direct view of the pontine surface. The risk of injury to the lower cranial nerve and of retraction damage to the temporal lobe and brain stem were kept minimal by this approach. Total tumor resection was achieved in 7 patients, with no resultant mortality. Eight patients had a satisfactory postsurgical course, extraocular paresis being their main complaint. The extent of tumor resection depended on the degree of tumor adhesion to the carotid artery, and operative morbidity on the degree of tumor invasion of the brain stem. Of the 3 patients in whom subtotal tumor removal was achieved, only one experienced regrowth of the tumor and underwent a second operation during the follow-up period (6 months-6 years). 
Reexamination of the blood lymphocyte transformation test in the diagnosis of chronic beryllium disease. The T cell response to beryllium, measured in bronchoalveolar lavage by the lymphocyte transformation test (LTT), is a critical diagnostic test for discriminating between chronic beryllium disease (CBD) and other granulomatous diseases. We examined the sensitivity, reproducibility, and methods of a less invasive, peripheral blood LTT in 17 patients with CBD and in 18 beryllium-exposed control subjects. Ninety-four percent of CBD cases (16/17) had abnormal blood LTT results, and all 18 beryllium-exposed control subjects had normal blood LTT results. Split samples for 10 beryllium disease cases and eight control subjects demonstrated that the blood LTT was reproducible between two separate laboratories. The LTT was equally sensitive with 10% and 20% serum in the culture medium. We conclude that an abnormal blood LTT can be used to diagnose CBD in patients with compatible lung pathology. 
Uvulopalatopharyngoplasty: evaluation of postoperative complications, sequelae, and results. A study of 71 patients with obstructive sleep apnea syndrome was performed to evaluate the effectiveness, complications, and late sequelae of uvulopalatopharyngoplasty. Postoperative immediate complications were of minor importance. In 96% of the patients, the snoring was improved; it was completely resolved in 48%. The postoperative apnea index remained pathologic in all patients who underwent postoperative polysomnography, although mild improvement was noted. Seventy-four percent of our patients felt a subjective postoperative improvement which was not always confirmed by the polysomnographic examination. A record of improvement was obtained in 64% of the operated patients. Our results establish the beneficial effect of uvulopalatopharyngoplasty, which is the recommended surgical procedure for obstructive sleep apnea syndrome. 
Altered interleukin-2 secretion in patients with primary fibromyalgia syndrome. Interleukin-2 (IL-2) production was studied in T lymphocytes and isolated CD4+ T lymphocytes from 12 patients with primary fibromyalgia syndrome and 10 healthy volunteers. The dose and time kinetics of IL-2 production by concanavalin A-stimulated T cells and CD4+ T cells of fibromyalgia patients differed from findings in controls by 1) a need for a higher concentration of mitogen in order to achieve optimal IL-2 secretion, and 2) a delay in the peak time of optimal IL-2 secretion. Unlike normal IL-2 secretion, which was higher after removal of CD8+ T cells, the pattern and degree of IL-2 secretion by cells from fibromyalgia patients were not changed following removal of CD8+ T cells. Addition of calcium ionophore in assays using suboptimal concanavalin A concentrations did not correct the reduction in IL-2 secretion by fibromyalgia patient T cells, but addition of phorbol myristate acetate induced normal secretion of IL-2. These findings suggest that there is a defect in the IL-2 pathway, which is related to protein kinase C activation and does not involve impairment of Ca2+ elevation, in patients with fibromyalgia. 
Cerebral vasoconstriction during head-upright tilt-induced vasovagal syncope. A paradoxic and unexpected response. BACKGROUND. To determine the effect of vasovagally mediated syncope on the cerebral circulation, transcranial Doppler sonography was used to assess changes in cerebral blood flow velocity during head-upright tilt-induced syncope. METHODS AND RESULTS. Thirty patients (17 men and 13 women; mean age, 43 +/- 22 years) with recurrent unexplained syncope were evaluated by use of an upright tilt-table test for 30 minutes, with or without an infusion of intravenous isoproterenol (1-4 micrograms/min), in an attempt to provoke bradycardia, hypotension, or both. Transcranial Doppler sonography was used to assess middle cerebral artery systolic velocity (Vs), diastolic velocity (Vd), ratio of systolic to diastolic velocities, pulsatility index (PI = Vs-Vd/Vmean), and resistance index (RI = Vs-Vd/Vs) before, during, and after tilt. Syncope occurred in six patients (20%) during the baseline tilt and 14 (46%) during isoproterenol infusion (total positives, 66%). In the tilt-positive patients, concomitant with the development of hypotension and bradycardia, transcranial Doppler sonography showed a 75 +/- 17% decrease in diastolic velocity, unchanged systolic velocity, a 46 +/- 17% decrease in mean velocity, a 295 +/- 227% increase in pulsatility index, and a 73 +/- 34% increase in resistance index. CONCLUSIONS. These findings reflect increased cerebrovascular resistance secondary to arteriolar vasoconstriction distal to the insonation point of the middle cerebral artery. This is paradoxic because the expected response of the cerebral circulation to hypotension is vasodilation. We conclude that abnormal baroreceptor responses triggered during vasovagal syncope result in a derangement of cerebral autoregulation with paradoxic vasoconstriction in the face of increasing hypotension. 
Hypertension, lipoprotein(a), and apolipoprotein A-I as risk factors for stroke in the Chinese. We analyzed the serum concentrations of lipids and lipoproteins and the prevalence of other risk factors in a case-control study of 304 consecutive Chinese patients with acute stroke (classified as cerebral infarction, lacunar infarction, or intracerebral hemorrhage) and 304 age- and sex-matched controls. For all strokes we identified the following risk factors: a history of ischemic heart disease, diabetes mellitus, or hypertension; the presence of atrial fibrillation or left ventricular hypertrophy; a glycosylated hemoglobin A1 concentration of greater than 9.1%; a fasting plasma glucose concentration 3 months after stroke of greater than 6.0 mmol/l; a serum triglyceride concentration 3 months after stroke of greater than 2.1 mmol/l; and a serum lipoprotein(a) concentration of greater than 29.2 mg/dl. We found the following protective factors: a serum high density lipoprotein-cholesterol concentration of greater than 1.59 mmol/l and a serum apolipoprotein A-I concentration of greater than or equal to 106 mg/dl. The patterns of risk factors differed among the three stroke subtypes. When significant risk factors were entered into a multiple logistic regression model, we found a history of hypertension, a high serum lipoprotein(a) concentration, and a low apolipoprotein A-I concentration to be independent risk factors for all strokes. The attributable risk for hypertension was estimated to be 24% in patients aged greater than or equal to 60 years. In this population, in which cerebrovascular diseases are the third commonest cause of mortality, identification of risk factors will allow further studies in risk factor modification for the prevention of stroke. 
Abnormalities of gastrointestinal motility in children with nonulcer dyspepsia and in children with gastroesophageal reflux disease. In 11 children (mean age 44.2 months) with symptoms suggesting upper intestinal dysfunction (nonulcer dyspepsia), in nine children (mean age 27.3 months) with gastroesophageal reflux (GER) disease, and in seven controls (mean age 20.4 months) we investigated fasting [for 3 hr or until two migrating motor complexes (MMC) were observed] and fed (90 min) antroduodenal motility by means of perfused catheter system; furthermore, we measured both gastric emptying of a radiolabeled milk formula and fasting duodenogastric reflux during manometry by assessing bile salt concentration in gastric aspirates. No structural abnormalities of gastrointestinal tract and organic disorders were detected in the patients. In a high proportion of both groups of patients we found manometric abnormalities of interdigestive and fed motor patterns that were not seen in the controls: absence of antral phase III of MMC; significant decrease of antral and/or duodenal motor activity during fasting and/or fed periods; abnormal propagation or configuration of MMC phase III that was significantly shorter than in controls; bursts of sustained fasting and/or fed phasic duodenal activity, frequently uncoordinated with adjacent gut segments. When compared to controls, the mean intragastric concentration of bile salts during all MMC phases and the mean 1-hr percent gastric activity of the radiolabeled milk were significantly higher in the two groups of patients. We conclude that in a high proportion of children with nonulcer dyspepsia and of children with GER disease, gastrointestinal manometry may reveal significant irregularities of antral and duodenal motility, which are associated with increased duodenogastric reflux and delayed gastric emptying. 
One-stage hypospadias repair: experience of 367 cases. Over a 6 1/2-year period we performed 374 primary hypospadias repairs, all but 7 as single-stage procedures. We usually employed the MAGPI, tubed preputial island flap and Mathieu reconstructions. Complications were comparatively few, with an overall incidence of 5% fistulae, 3% anastomotic strictures and 7% meatal retraction or stenosis. The cosmetic results were superior to those of staged procedures in that it was almost always possible to obtain a glanular meatus which was both terminal and realistic. 
Early repair of iatrogenic injury to the ureter or bladder after gynecological surgery. Contrary to the traditional doctrine of delayed intervention in post-hysterectomy injuries of the ureter or bladder, the policy at our department has been to operate as soon as possible after the diagnosis is made. Of 68 patients (25 with vesicovaginal fistulas and 43 with ureteral injuries) early intervention was possible in 40 (59%). Primary healing was obtained in all patients. These results suggest that there is no disadvantage in early repair. 
Perivalvular pseudoaneurysm complicating bacterial endocarditis: MR detection in five cases. Bacterial endocarditis usually affects the valve leaflets, but erosion into the valve anulus and adjacent myocardium may form a myocardial abscess. Perivalvular abscesses can drain into the ventricles or aorta, forming a life-threatening pseudoaneurysm. We reviewed our experience with cardiac MR imaging of this disorder. Fourteen patients with complicated bacterial endocarditis underwent ECG-gated spin-echo cardiac MR imaging in addition to conventional duplex two-dimensional echocardiography (2-D echo). Angiography was performed in seven patients, six of whom underwent surgery for valve replacement. MR imaging detected the pseudoaneurysms in all five of the surgically proved cases, while 2-D echo detected only three. Clinical follow-up suggested there were no false-negative examinations, but no autopsy data were available for confirmation. Postoperative MR imaging studies were conducted in three patients, revealing two recurrent pseudoaneurysms and one thrombosed aneurysm. Cardiac MR imaging provides useful pre- and postoperative information in patients with perivalvular pseudoaneurysms due to endocarditis. 
Immunohistochemical detection of transforming growth factor-beta 1 in fibrotic liver diseases. Transforming growth factor-beta 1 was localized by means of immunohistochemical reaction in liver biopsy specimens taken from patients having different chronic liver diseases with extending fibrosis. Two polyclonal antibodies that were produced in rabbits were directed against the amino terminal of transforming growth factor-beta 1. Staining by anti-CC(1-30) was primarily extracellular and located in the portal and periportal fibrotic areas of all seven cases with chronic active hepatitis. No staining was noted in the four chronic persistent cases studied. A strong reaction was seen with the antibody in nine of the ten cirrhotic samples, whereas it was negative in one inactive cirrhosis case and in all five cases with normal liver histological findings. No positive staining could be detected by the anti-LC(1-30) in any of the liver tissues. Detection of transforming growth factor-beta 1 in active liver diseases at the site of fibrosis suggests that transforming growth factor-beta 1 might have a role in the process and progression of fibrosis during the development of the disease. 
Elevated serum gastrin levels in patients with gastric cancer. Elevated plasma gastrin levels have been found in patients with colorectal cancer. We measured fasting serum gastrin levels in control subjects (n = 12), patients with gastric cancer (n = 43), and patients with carcinoma of the esophagus (n = 55). Serum gastrin levels were significantly higher in patients with gastric cancer compared to normal controls (P less than 0.005) and those with esophageal cancer (P less than 0.05). This information may add to our understanding of the pathogenesis of gastric cancer. 
The nutcracker syndrome: new aspects of pathophysiology, diagnosis and treatment. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was used to study vascular anatomy in 3 patients with the nutcracker syndrome and in 10 healthy volunteers. From these studies an abnormal branching of the superior mesenteric artery from the aorta was identified as being the cause of the nutcracker syndrome. Consequently, surgical transposition of the left renal vein to achieve an unobstructed renal venous backflow was performed successfully in 2 patients, while 1 underwent nephrectomy. In 1 patient adjuvant ureteral instrumentation became necessary to aid occlusion of persisting shunts between peripelvic venous varicosities and the urinary tract. Awareness of the pathophysiology of the nutcracker syndrome ensures an early diagnosis, which should be confirmed by a combination of diagnostic procedures, including MRI. 
Localized necrotizing arteritis. A report of two cases involving the gallbladder and pancreas. We report two cases of localized necrotizing arteritis, one involving the gallbladder and one involving the pancreas. Both cases were found incidentally in surgically resected specimens. Vascular changes in both cases were similar to those seen in classic polyarteritis nodosa, involving medium-sized muscular arteries characterized by fibrinoid necrosis and panarterial and periarterial inflammations varying from active to resolving stages. Both patients had no constitutional symptoms or underlying serologic abnormalities suggestive of systemic angitis. To our knowledge, pancreas-limited arteritis has not previously been described. Whether these lesions represent an early manifestation of a systemic arteritides syndrome, a variant of polyarteritis nodosa, or a distinct entity should be prudently judged through a long-term follow-up. 
Effect of oral propranolol administration on azygos, renal and hepatic uptake and output of catecholamines in cirrhosis. Circulating catecholamines are increased in cirrhosis with portal hypertension, and increase further after propranolol. In 23 cirrhotic patients, plasma norepinephrine and epinephrine were determined in an artery, the azygos vein, the right renal vein and a hepatic vein before and after an oral 80-mg dose of propranolol. Baseline azygos and renal venous norepinephrine levels were significantly higher than arterial norepinephrine levels (+20%, p less than 0.005; and +28%, p less than 0.001, respectively). Hepatic venous norepinephrine and all venous epinephrine values were below the arterial values (all p less than 0.05). After propranolol intake, arterial norepinephrine and epinephrine increased (+16%, p less than 0.01; and +93%, p less than 0.001, respectively). Significant increases in norepinephrine and epinephrine were found in azygos and renal veins (all p less than 0.01), whereas hepatic venous norepinephrine and epinephrine remained unchanged. Azygos and hepatic blood flow decreased after propranolol intake (-27%, p less than 0.05; and -16%, p less than 0.01, respectively). Azygos spillover of norepinephrine (an estimate of locally released norepinephrine delivered to the circulation) and clearance of epinephrine remained unaltered. Hepatointestinal clearance showed no significant change for norepinephrine, but showed a borderline-significant decrease for epinephrine (-23%, p = 0.08). Our results show a net production of norepinephrine in the prehepatic splanchnic area drained through superior portalsystemic collaterals and in the kidneys. The increase in circulating catecholamines after propranolol intake is probably due to a combination of further enhancement of sympathetic activity and a decrease in catecholamine degradation. 
The spectrum of vertical gaze palsy following unilateral brainstem stroke. A single unilateral lesion, near the midline, may interrupt the pathways involved in vertical gaze just before and after they decussate, inducing an anatomically unilateral, but functionally bilateral, lesion. We report 11 patients with supranuclear vertical gaze palsies (two with conjugate upgaze palsy, four with combined up- and downgaze palsies, two with monocular elevation palsy, and three with vertical "one-and-a-half" syndrome) due to unilateral midbrain strokes. 
Use of polymerase chain reactions to monitor minimal residual disease in acute lymphoblastic leukemia patients. T-cell receptor (TCR) delta gene rearrangements are observed in more than 80% of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) patients. Moreover, a preferential usage of specific genetic elements has been shown in different ALL subtypes: V delta 1 DJ delta 1 rearrangements predominate in T-ALL, while most B-precursor ALLs show a recombination of V delta 2 to D delta 3. Recently we have proposed a strategy for the detection of minimal residual disease (MRD) based on the isolation of clonospecific probes following the in vitro amplification of V delta 1 DJ delta 1 junctions by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and now have adapted this method to the preparation of specific V delta 2 D delta 3 fragments. In the present study, clonospecific probes were generated from 11 T-ALL and 16 cALL patients (21 children, 6 adults). The sensitivity of these 27 probes in detecting residual leukemia cells varied between 10(-4) to 10(-6) as determined by semiquantitative evaluation of dilution experiments. PCR analysis of 55 bone marrow (BM) and peripheral blood (PB) samples obtained from the 27 patients during complete clinical remission showed the following results: (1) Evidence for MRD was obtained in the BM of all patients (eight of eight) investigated 2 to 6 months after remission induction and also in 6 of 11 cases on maintenance therapy 7 to 19 months after diagnosis. (2) In contrast, all patients but one (10 of 11) analyzed 6 to 41 months after the termination of treatment lacked apparent evidence for leukemia DNA; the exception was a girl exhibiting 10(-4) to 10(-5) residual cells in her PB 5.5 years after diagnosis. (3) Longitudinal analysis in nine patients disclosed marked individual differences in the intervals between achievement of clinical remission and complete eradication of the leukemia cell clone. (4) Differences in the duration of MRD were not associated with distinct clinical-hematologic features. (5) Detection of residual disease by PCR proceeded clinical relapse in two cases. 
Update on esophageal radiology. This article reviews the current status of double-contrast radiography in diagnosing pharyngeal tumors and opportunistic esophagitis and the radiologic evaluation of esophageal motility disorders in patients with chest pain. Double-contrast pharyngography is a valuable technique for detecting pharyngeal tumors. These lesions may be manifested by an intraluminal mass, mucosal irregularity, or asymmetric distensibility. Furthermore, barium studies may demonstrate lesions involving the valleculae, tongue base, lower hypopharynx, and pharyngoesophageal segment that are difficult to visualize at endoscopy. Double-contrast radiography is also a valuable technique for detecting opportunistic esophagitis and for differentiating the underlying causes. Mucosal plaques should suggest Candida esophagitis, whereas discrete ulcers should suggest herpes esophagitis, and one or more large, relatively flat ulcers should suggest cytomegalovirus esophagitis. Finally, in evaluating patients with chest pain, in only a small percentage are esophageal motility disorders found to be a possible cause of their pain. Instead, the majority are found to have cardiac disease, structural esophageal lesions, or gastroesophageal reflux, so that barium studies are more useful in documenting normal motility or structural abnormalities in these patients. 
Effects of diltiazem on long-term outcome after acute myocardial infarction in patients with and without a history of systemic hypertension. The Multicenter Diltiazem Postinfarction Trial Research Group. The effect of diltiazem on long-term outcome in patients with acute myocardial infarction with and without a history of systemic hypertension was investigated in 2,466 patients using the Multicenter Diltiazem Postinfarction Trial data-base. The baseline variables were comparable in the diltiazem and placebo-treated patients within the groups with and without hypertension. The initial 60-mg dose of diltiazem was associated with a significant (p less than 0.001) but modest (3%) reduction in blood pressure and heart rate in both groups with and without hypertension. Univariate and multivariate analyses revealed a meaningful overall reduction in first recurrent cardiac events (cardiac death or nonfatal reinfarction, whichever occurred first) and cardiac death in patients with hypertension treated with diltiazem compared with results in those treated with placebo. Similar effects were not observed in patients without a history of hypertension. When first recurrent cardiac events were used as the end point, the diltiazem:placebo hazard ratio (95% confidence limits) was 0.77 (0.58, 1.01) for the total hypertension group, and 0.67 (0.47, 0.96) and 1.32 (0.83, 2.10) for patients with hypertension with and without pulmonary congestion during the acute infarction, respectively. Similar results were observed using cardiac death as the end point. Beta blockers had a negligible effect on the hypertension-diltiazem relation. These findings suggest that diltiazem may exert a long-term beneficial effect in most patients with hypertension who do not have pulmonary congestion during an acute infarction, and a detrimental effect in the minority who have pulmonary congestion. 
Chronic neurologic manifestations of Lyme disease BACKGROUND AND METHODS. Lyme disease, caused by the tick-borne spirochete Borrelia burgdorferi, is associated with a wide variety of neurologic manifestations. To define further the chronic neurologic abnormalities of Lyme disease, we studied 27 patients (age range, 25 to 72 years) with previous signs of Lyme disease, current evidence of immunity to B. burgdorferi, and chronic neurologic symptoms with no other identifiable cause. Eight of the patients had been followed prospectively for 8 to 12 years after the onset of infection. RESULTS. Of the 27 patients, 24 (89 percent) had a mild encephalopathy that began 1 month to 14 years after the onset of the disease and was characterized by memory loss, mood changes, or sleep disturbance. Of the 24 patients, 14 had memory impairment on neuropsychological tests, and 18 had increased cerebrospinal fluid protein levels, evidence of intrathecal production of antibody to B. burgdorferi, or both. Nineteen of the 27 patients (70 percent) had polyneuropathy with radicular pain or distal paresthesias; all but two of these patients also had encephalopathy. In 16 patients electrophysiologic testing showed an axonal polyneuropathy. One patient had leukoencephalitis with asymmetric spastic diplegia, periventricular white-matter lesions, and intrathecal production of antibody to B. burgdorferi. Among the 27 patients, associated symptoms included fatigue (74 percent), headache (48 percent), arthritis (37 percent), and hearing loss (15 percent). At the time of examination, chronic neurologic abnormalities had been present from 3 months to 14 years, usually with little progression. Six months after a two-week course of intravenous ceftriaxone (2 g daily), 17 patients (63 percent) had improvement, 6 (22 percent) had improvement but then relapsed, and 4 (15 percent) had no change in their condition. CONCLUSIONS. Months to years after the initial infection with B. burgdorferi, patients with Lyme disease may have chronic encephalopathy, polyneuropathy, or less commonly, leukoencephalitis. These chronic neurologic abnormalities usually improve with antibiotic therapy. 
Automatic and effortful memory processes in elderly persons with organic brain pathology. This study investigated the automatic and effortful memory encoding model of Hasher and Zacks (1979) and the potential it may hold for aiding in the differentiation between aging-related memory decline and dementia. College students, normal elders, and dementia patients were compared on a 96-item picturebook task utilizing measures of free recall, recognition accuracy, memory for location, and memory for frequency. There were no differences between students and elders on any of the dependent measures. However, differences were found between elders and patients on each measure, and a discriminant function correctly classified the two groups with 93.3% accuracy. Subsequent discriminant analysis found patients could be correctly classified into diagnostic subgroups, i.e., dementia of the Alzheimer's type (DAT), multi-infarct dementia (MID), and Korsakoff's disease (KD) with 80.8% accuracy. The model holds promise as a guide for clinicians who are asked to make differential diagnoses of memory-impaired individuals. 
Postpartum hypercalcemia in a patient with medullary sponge kidneys. Previous associations of primary hyperparathyroidism-induced hypercalcemia and medullary sponge kidney (MSK) have been reported. In this report, we describe a lactating woman MSK noted to be hypercalcemic throughout lactation, without evidence of hyperparathyroidism. After the baby was weaned, the serum calcium returned to normal. A bone biopsy performed while the patient was hypercalcemic was consistent with hyperparathyroidism, suggesting the presence of a parathyroid-like protein produced during lactation. 
Survival determinants in extensive-stage non-small-cell lung cancer: the Southwest Oncology Group experience. We analyzed the 2,531-patient Southwest Oncology Group extensive-stage non-small-cell lung cancer (ENSCLC) data base from 1974 to 1988 to (1) assess the interactions of host- or tumor-related prognostic factors and therapy using Cox modeling and recursive partitioning and amalgamation (RPA) to determine whether each independently predicts outcome, and (2) use RPA to define prognostic subsets with different survival potentials. Good performance status (PS), female sex, and age greater than or equal to 70 years were significant independent predictors in a Cox model applied to the entire population. In a second Cox model for patients with good PS enrolled on recent studies, hemoglobin level greater than or equal to 11.0 g/dL, normal lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), normal calcium, and a single metastatic site were significant favorable factors. The use of cisplatin was an additional independent predictor of improved outcome in both Cox models after adjustments for year of accrual and all prognostic variables. The favorable effect of cisplatin was observed in each of six RPA-derived subgroups from the entire population. A second RPA of 904 patients from recent trials (nearly all received cisplatin-based therapy) resulted in three distinct prognostic subsets based on PS, age, hemoglobin, and LDH; greater than or equal to 1-year survivals were 27%, 16%, and 6% (P less than .0001). The best survival occurred for patients with a good PS who had a hemoglobin level greater than or equal to 11 g/dL and who were older than 47 years. This analysis suggests that although several factors were independent variables in the Cox models, three important prognostic subgroups were easily defined through RPA. Together with other analyses, our results suggest the need to modify the stage IV category in NSCLC. 
Current medical management of cirrhotic ascites. The presence of ascites may indicate a number of hepatic and extra-hepatic disorders. This situation requires comprehensive evaluation to determine the underlying cause. The evaluation and management of ascites in patients with known cirrhosis is very important since this manifestation of portal hypertension has a detrimental effect on the prognosis for such patients. 
Visceral and peripheral tissue perfusion after cardiac surgery. Visceral and peripheral tissue perfusion and oxygenation were studied in ten patients in the early phase after coronary artery bypass grafting. Visceral perfusion was assessed indirectly, by determining gastric intramucosal pH. As parameters of peripheral tissue perfusion and oxygenation, subcutaneous tissue PO2 (PscO2), transcutaneous PO2 (PtcO2). PtcO2 index (PtcO2/PaO2), laser-Doppler skin red-cell flux (RCF) and fingertip temperature (Tft) were recorded in the upper extremity. Central haemodynamics, rectal temperature and blood gases were also measured. The inspired oxygen concentration was maintained at 30 v/v%. Gastric intramucosal pH declined progressively during the first 3 hours in the intensive care unit, reached its minimum at 5 hours and thereafter slowly increased. The peripheral vascular bed was shut down on admission to the ICU, as indicated by low values of PscO2, PtcO2, PtCO2 index, RCF and Tft. These parameters began to rise after the next 2-4 hours and peaked by the end of the 8-hour study period, indicating complete opening of the peripheral vascular bed. 
Neutrophil-endothelial cell interaction in critical illness. Sepsis syndrome frequently results in endothelial injury in many organ systems. To evaluate neutrophil-pulmonary endothelial cell interaction in the sepsis syndrome, we studied 39 critically ill patients prospectively and 20 normal volunteers. Thirteen patients with sepsis (mean age, 71.4 years), 14 patients in an intensive care unit control group (mean age 65.4 years), and 12 patients admitted with acute myocardial infarction (mean age, 66.8 years) were evaluated. Blood samples were drawn from septic patients within 24 hours and from ICU and MI patients within 72 hours of admission. All sepsis patients were culture positive, 6 of 13 from the blood. Both renal failure and ARDS developed in 54 percent of septic patients. 51Cr-labelled neutrophils were prepared and added to bovine pulmonary endothelial cell monolayers with and without added phorbol myristate acetate. Endothelial cells with adherent PMA and nonadherent PMN's, were harvested and radioactivity in each fraction measured with a gamma scintillation counter. Baseline and maximally stimulated (PMA, 3.0 ng/ml) neutrophil adherence to endothelial cells were similar in all patients groups. However, in septic patients, PMA-stimulated PMN adherence was reduced at lower doses, most significantly in those who developed ARDS within 24 to 48 hours of admission (p less than 0.05). Seventy-one percent of patients who developed ARDS had reduced stimulated adherence (PMA 1.0 ng/ml) compared to 22 percent of critically ill patients who did not. We conclude that diminished adherence of neutrophils to endothelium in response to low-level PMA stimulation is significantly more common in patients with sepsis who develop ARDS. Our findings suggest that PMN-endothelial cell interaction is altered by the time sepsis is clinically recognized but before the development of ARDS. We speculate that the observed reduction in adherence of the PMN to endothelial cells may be a consequence of down-regulation by mediators generated in the inflammatory response to sepsis and/or the need for active participation of septic endothelium in this interaction. 
Systemic lupus erythematosus and lymphoma: association with antiphospholipid syndrome. A woman with a history of polyarthralgias appeared to develop systemic lupus erythematosus and lymphoma simultaneously. The diagnosis of the concurrent lymphoma was made on biopsy of a left axillary lymph node. Generalized lymphadenopathy, splenomegaly and pruritus had given rise to suspicion of an underlying lymphoma. The lymphoma responded well to chemotherapy. Her condition was further complicated by an arterial occlusion involving the right 2nd toe which was eventually amputated, transient ischemic attacks (amaurosis fugax), livedo reticularis and thrombocytopenia which were accompanied by elevations of IgM anticardiolipin antibodies and a biological false test for syphilis. The lupus anticoagulant test was not performed as she was given anticoagulation therapy. 
Determinants of successful transthoracic defibrillation and outcome in ventricular fibrillation. OBJECTIVE--To examine factors determining defibrillation success and outcome in patients with ventricular fibrillation. DESIGN--Observational prospective study of age, sex, transthoracic impedance, site of cardiac arrest, ventricular fibrillation duration and amplitude, primary or secondary ventricular fibrillation, aetiology, number of shocks to correct ventricular fibrillation, and drug treatment. SETTING--A teaching hospital and a mobile coronary care unit with a physician. PATIENTS--70 consecutive patients (50 male, 20 female) mean age 66.5 years. INTERVENTIONS--Before the first countershock was administered transthoracic impedance using a 30 kHz low amplitude AC current passed through 8 cm/12 cm self-adhesive defibrillator electrode pads applied in the anteroapical position was measured. The first two shocks were 200 J delivered energy (low energy) and further shocks of 360 J (high energy) were given if required. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES--Countershock success and outcome from ventricular fibrillation. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS--First shock success was significantly greater in inhospital arrests (37/53) than in out-of-hospital arrests (5/17) and in those receiving antiarrhythmic treatment (13/15, 86.7%) v (27/51, 52.9%). Transthoracic impedance was similar in those who were successfully defibrillated with one or two 200 J shocks (98.7 (26) omega) and those who required one or more 360 J shocks (91.4 (23) omega). Success rates with two 200 J shocks were similar in those patients with "high" transthoracic impedance (that is, greater than 115 omega) and those with transthoracic impedance (less than or equal to 115 omega) (8/12 (67%) v 44/58 (76%]. Fine ventricular fibrillation was significantly more common in the patients with a transthoracic impedance of greater than 95 omega (41% (13/32] than in those with a transthoracic impedance less than or equal to 95 omega (13% (5/38]. Death during arrest was significantly more common in patients who needed high energy shocks (14/18 (78%] than in those who needed low energy shocks (16/52 (31%]. Multiple regression analysis identified ventricular fibrillation with an amplitude of greater than or equal to 0.5 mV, age less than or equal to 70 years, and arrests that needed less than or equal to two shocks for defibrillation, in rank order as independent predictors of survival to discharge. 
Prediction of prognosis in primary breast cancer by detection of a high molecular weight mucin-like antigen using monoclonal antibodies DF3, F36/22, and CU18: a Cancer and Leukemia Group B study Three monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) (DF3, F36/22, CU18) were used to monitor expression of distinct epitopes present within a family of mucin-like, breast carcinoma-associated molecules. Primary tumor specimens from more than 190 stage II breast cancer patients were evaluated for expression of the high molecular weight antigens. With a median follow-up of 6 years, patients whose tumors exhibited high immunoperoxidase staining scores (greater than 50% positive cells) with MAb DF3 had a superior disease-free survival ([DFS] 56% +/- 6% v 37% +/- 5% at 6 years; P = .0088) and overall survival ([OS] 72% +/- 5% v 59% +/- 5% at 6 years; P = .025). Staining scores with the other two antibodies did not correlate with improved prognosis. For MAbs DF3 and CU18, patients whose tumors exhibited predominantly apical cellular reactivity patterns had improved DFS, although differences reached conventional levels of statistical significance only with MAb CU18. In multivariate analyses, the prognostic value of MAb DF3 staining was independent of other identified prognostic factors. Furthermore, the concordance between primary and axillary lymph node metastases staining with each MAb was 73%, 80%, and 85% for MAbs DF3, F36/22, and CU18, respectively. These results suggest that staining with MAb DF3 identifies a group of node-positive women with a relatively favorable prognosis. Expression of the DF3 mucin-like glycoprotein is related to better differentiation, and staining with MAb DF3 provides an accurate and objective estimate of clinical outcome independent of histopathologic evaluation. 
Cerebral edema causing death in children with maple syrup urine disease. Four children with the classic form of maple syrup urine disease (MSUD) died of cerebral edema during an intercurrent infection that caused severe dehydration and acidosis. The diagnosis of MSUD had been established during the neonatal period in all four patients, on day 1 of life in three of them. All were in satisfactory control before the intercurrent illness. Two patients underwent peritoneal dialysis. Signs of brain-stem compression occurred after treatment, when biochemical abnormalities were improving. Computed tomography of the head, which was done in two patients, revealed cerebral edema; one of these patients also had subarachnoid hemorrhage. Autopsy in one case revealed cerebral edema with herniation. Our experience documents that cerebral edema may occur in the older child with MSUD as well as in the neonate. The pathogenesis of cerebral edema in MSUD remains unclear. Early treatment of dehydration and acidosis may prevent the catastrophic consequences that we have observed. 
Amino acid substitutions in the coat protein result in loss of insect transmissibility of a plant virus. Amino acids near the N terminus of the coat protein of tobacco vein mottling virus were deleted or altered by site-directed mutagenesis to determine the effect on aphid transmissibility of the virus. Deletion of a three amino acid sequence Asp-Ala-Gly, which is conserved in aphid-transmissible potyvirus isolates, abolished transmission. The mutation Ala----Thr in this triplet drastically reduced transmission, whereas the mutation Asp----Asn had no effect, and the mutation Asp----Lys consistently reverted to the wild-type residue. The mutation Lys----Glu, in the residue adjacent to the glycine of the triplet, drastically reduced transmission, whereas the mutation Gln----Pro, seven residues downstream from the glycine had no effect. Comparison of the sequences of other potyviruses suggests that the presence of a glycine residue at the third position of the Asp-Ala-Gly triplet is critical for aphid transmissibility and that certain changes in the residues adjacent to this position abolish or greatly reduce aphid transmissibility. 
Radiologic findings of clonorchiasis. Clonorchiasis is a trematodiasis caused by chronic infestation of liver flukes, Clonorchis sinensis. The adult flukes reside in the medium-sized and small intrahepatic bile ducts and, occasionally, in the extrahepatic bile ducts, gallbladder, and pancreatic duct. The result is mechanical obstruction, inflammatory reaction, adenomatous hyperplasia, and periductal fibrosis. Signs and symptoms are usually mild and nonspecific, but heavy infestation results in obstructive jaundice. The disease has a close relationship with recurrent pyogenic cholangitis and cholangiocarcinoma. In this article, the radiologic findings, including cholangiography, sonography, and CT of clonorchiasis are reviewed in light of the pathophysiology of the disease. The relationship to recurrent pyogenic cholangitis and to cholangiocarcinoma is discussed. 
Diverticula of the female urethra: diagnosis by endovaginal and transperineal sonography. Diverticula of the female urethra can be difficult to diagnose. Invasive contrast studies (voiding cystourethrography or double-balloon urethrography) or urethroscopy are frequently required for definitive diagnosis. Although transabdominal sonography has been able to visualize large diverticula, this technique has not proved useful in routine screening. In this study, we examined the use of higher frequency (5 MHz) near-focus endovaginal or transperineal sonography for the diagnosis of urethral diverticula. Five patients with radiographically proved (three with double-balloon urethrography and two with voiding cystourethrography) urethral diverticula were examined with endovaginal (two cases) or transperineal (four cases) sonography. In all five cases, sonography showed the diverticula previously demonstrated on the contrast study. The spatial relationship of the diverticula to the urethra, an important consideration at surgery, was shown more clearly by sonography than by contrast radiography. These findings suggest that sonography may be useful as a noninvasive screening technique for urethral diverticula. 
Hypercapnic and hypoxic ventilatory responses in parents and siblings of children with congenital central hypoventilation syndrome. Children with congenital central hypoventilation syndrome (CCHS) have abnormal ventilatory responses to metabolic stimuli. As there is a genetically determined component of chemoreceptor sensitivity, parents and siblings of children with CCHS may also have blunted ventilatory responses to hypercapnea and hypoxia. To test this, we studied hypercapnic ventilatory responses and hypoxic ventilatory responses in six mothers, four fathers, and five siblings (6 to 49 yr of age) of seven children with CCHS and compared them with 15 age- and sex-matched control subjects (5 to 47 yr of age). Pulmonary function tests were not different between relatives of children with CCHS and control subjects. To measure hypercapnic ventilatory responses, subjects rebreathed 5% CO2/95% O2 until PACO2 reached 60 to 70 mm Hg. To measure hypoxic ventilatory responses (L/min/% SaO2), subjects rebreathed 14% O2/7% CO2/balance N2 at mixed venous PCO2 until SaO2 fell to 75%. All tests were completed in less than 4 min. Instantaneous minute ventilation, mean inspiratory flow (tidal volume/inspiratory time), and respiratory timing (inspiratory timing/total respiratory cycle timing) were calculated on a breath-by-breath basis. Hypercapnic ventilatory responses were 1.97 +/- 0.32 L/min/mm Hg PACO2 in children with CCHS relatives and 2.23 +/- 0.23 L/min/mm Hg PACO2 in control subjects. Hypoxic ventilatory responses were -1.99 +/- 0.37 L/min/% SaO2 in the relatives and -1.54 +/- 0.25 L/min/% SaO2 in the control subjects. 
Clinical pathology of endocrine tumors of the pancreas. Analysis of autopsy cases. A clinicopathological analysis of endocrine tumors of the pancreas, using 800 autopsy cases (422 men, 378 women, mean age 78.7) was accomplished. The results were: (1) Endocrine tumors and similar lesions were found in 3% or 24 cases (25 lesions). Twenty lesions (20 cases) were found to be tumors and five lesions (five cases) were determined to be hyperplasia of Langerhans islets. (2) Incidence of tumor was 10% (6/60) in individuals having histological studies of all sections of the pancreas, and 1.6% (12/738) in individuals having histological studies of three random sections of the pancreas. (3) None of the cases with tumors and hyperplastic lesions showed symptoms of hormone production. (4) Immunohistochemical analysis revealed hormone production in all 20 tumor cases and multiple hormone production was found in 14 of these (70%). (5) Ductular or tubular structures were found in or adjacent to the tumors in 12 cases (60%) and hyperplasia in one case (20%). Langerhans islets, 500 microns or larger in size, were found in three lesions of the tumor (15%). Langerhans islets with the mean diameter of normal islets + 2 SD or larger also were found around five tumors (25%) and three hyperplasias (60%). The above findings suggest that endocrine tumors of the pancreas are prevalent and that they do not produce symptoms of excessive hormone production even though they do continue to produce hormones. Some of the endocrine tumors or hyperplasias develop from totipotent stem cells of the duct epithelia, and factors promoting the growth of Langerhans islets might exist. 
ECMO in premature infants. Review of factors associated with mortality. During the first few years of clinical research on neonatal extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO), 16 premature infants of less than 35 weeks gestational age were treated by the authors (RHB), and only four (25%) survived. Intracranial hemorrhage was common, prompting the authors to recommend that ECMO not be used in premature infants with respiratory failure. Since diagnostic methods, indications, and techniques of extracorporeal support have improved considerably, the records of these previous cases were reviewed in detail to determine if there was reason to believe that results might be better in the modern era. Of the 16 patients, four had pre-ECMO conditions that would now be considered contraindications and five of the remaining patients had major technical complications that are now rare. Anticoagulation and fluid management of these patients also would be handled much differently. Based on this review and on current experience with extracorporeal support in near-term infants, it is reasonable to expect that survival of moribund premature infants might be 50% or greater with extracorporeal support. New phase I trials using improved indications and technology are suggested. 
Activation of phospholipase D by E-series prostaglandins in human erythroleukemia cells. Phospholipase D (PLD) can be activated by a variety of receptor agonists in different cell types. However, an effect of prostaglandins (PGs) on the activity of this enzyme has not been demonstrated previously. In this study, we found that PGE1 could stimulate PLD in human erythroleukemia cells, as measured by phosphatidylethanol formation, with an ED50 of 3.5 x 10(-7) M. PGE2 was also active, but other PGs including prostacyclin, PGD2 and PGF2, had no effect. PGE1 also elicited cyclic AMP production over the same concentration range that activated PLD. However, it is unlikely that cyclic AMP per se is responsible for PGE-induced PLD activation, because PLD could be substantially activated by PGE2 at concentrations (0.1-1 microM) which did not stimulate cyclic AMP production. Furthermore, no increase of phosphatidylethanol formation could be observed when cells were treated with other adenylyl cyclase-activating agents such as prostacyclin, forskolin and vasoactive intestinal peptide. In Ca+(+)-free medium, PLD activation by PGE1 and PGE2 was greatly reduced, indicating that their effect was through a Ca+(+)-dependent pathway. Pretreatment of cells with pertussis toxin abolished PGE1- and PGE2-stimulated PLD activity, implying the involvement of a G protein in the PGE-mediated signal transduction pathway. Our results not only indicate that E-series PGs may initiate some of their cellular effects through a novel pathway, activation of PLD, but also suggest that PGE-stimulated PLD activity in human erythroleukemia cells is Ca+(+)-dependent and is regulated via a pertussis toxin-sensitive G protein. 
Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor-induced renal failure: causes, consequences, and diagnostic uses. Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor-induced renal failure is now a well-recognized phenomenon that appears to occur almost exclusively in patients with a preexisting reduction in renal perfusion pressure, especially those with renovascular disease. In the latter group of patients, renal failure probably results from some combination of reduced poststenotic renal perfusion pressure and a unique disturbance in the autoregulation of glomerular filtration rate. Although traditionally regarded as functional and reversible, recent animal studies suggest that angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor-induced reductions of glomerular filtration rate may lead to progressive renal atrophy, an observation that raises concerns about the long-term safety of these agents in patients with renovascular disease. On the other hand, the deleterious consequences of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibition in renovascular disease have been exploited as aids in the diagnosis of this disorder. Whether the adjunctive use of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors will prove to be useful in screening large populations of hypertensive patients for renovascular hypertension remains to be determined. However, such adjunctive tests appear to be useful in judging the functional significance of angiographically documented renal artery stenosis. 
Pacemaker-lead puncture of the tricuspid valve. Successful diagnosis and treatment. During insertion, a transvenous pacing lead pierced the tricuspid valve in a 66-year-old man, causing progressive tricuspid insufficiency and congestive heart failure. The defect remained undiagnosed for ten years and was then repaired. To our knowledge, this is the first case in which this problem has been successfully treated rather than being diagnosed at autopsy. 
Acute and sustained release of the atrial natriuretic factor prohormone N-terminus with acute myocardial infarction. This investigation was designed to determine if acute ischemic cardiac injury causes the release of the 98 amino acid (aa) N-terminus of the 126 aa atrial natriuretic factor prohormone (pro ANF). Seventeen patients with acute myocardial infarction, but without clinical evidence of congestive heart failure, had their circulating concentrations of the whole N-terminus (ie, pro ANF 1-98), the midportion of the N-terminus of the ANF prohormone (consisting of aa 31-67; pro ANF 31-67) and creatine phosphokinase (CPK) monitored daily for 14 days. All seventeen patients had elevated plasma pro ANF 1-98 and pro ANF 31-67 concentrations at the time of presentation. Maximal increase on day three post-infarction correlated with the size of infarction estimated by the maximal CPK (r = 0.675; p less than 0.05) but did not correlate with the amount of left ventricular dysfunction. Another three patients with acute myocardial infarction were treated with tissue plasminogen activator (tPA). The measured pro ANF 1-98 and pro ANF 31-67 levels in these patients were within our normal range and significantly lower (p less than 0.001) than seen in patients with acute myocardial infarction not given thrombolytic therapy. Six patients with unstable angina, likewise, had normal circulating pro ANFs 1-98 and 31-67 concentrations during prolonged episodes of chest pain. These data suggest that myocardial necrosis but not ischemia triggers the release of the entire 126 aa prohormone. 
Peritonitis due to Prototheca wickerhamii in a patient undergoing chronic ambulatory peritoneal dialysis. A 72-year-old man who was undergoing chronic ambulatory peritoneal dialysis developed peritonitis due to Prototheca wickerhamii. Results of in vitro sensitivity testing revealed that the organism was sensitive to amphotericin B (MIC, 0.4 micrograms/mL) but resistant to fluconazole (MIC, greater than 80 micrograms/mL). The patient was successfully treated medically with a combination of intravenous amphotericin B and oral doxycycline. 
Microvascular decompression for hemifacial spasm. Patterns of vascular compression in unsuccessfully operated patients. To determine the causative factors of unsuccessful microvascular decompression for hemifacial spasm, the follow-up results in 53 patients were assessed retrospectively. The mean follow-up period was 36 months. There were 32 patients who had compression of the seventh cranial nerve ventrocaudally by an anterior inferior cerebellar artery (AICA) or a posterior inferior cerebellar artery. Of these 32 patients, 30 (94%) had excellent postoperative results. Of 14 patients with more severe compression by the vertebral artery, nine (64%) had excellent results, three (21%) had good results, and two (14%) had poor results; in this group, three patients with excellent results experienced transient spasm recurrence. There were seven patients in whom the meatal branch of the AICA coursed between the seventh and eighth cranial nerves and compressed the dorsal aspect of the seventh nerve; this was usually associated with another artery compressing the ventral aspect of the nerve ("sandwich-type" compression). Of these seven patients, five (71%) had poor results including operative failure in one and recurrence of spasm in four. The authors conclude that the clinical outcome was closely related to the patterns of vascular compression. 
Anti-anginal therapy and quality of life. A comparison of the effects of transdermal nitroglycerin and long-acting oral nitrates. A total of 112 male patients with severe effort-induced angina pectoris (New York Heart Association functional classes II and III) participated in a randomized open trial consisting of a 6 month phase with 3 month treatment cross-overs. The aim of the study was to compare the effect of transdermal nitroglycerin (TN) patches and long-acting oral nitrates (LAON) on quality of life (QL). During the cross-over period 30 patients (20 on TN and 10 on LAON) withdrew from the study, over half of them within the first month. Although the results should be interpreted with some caution, they showed that improvement in QL was present for both treatments but greater during the transdermal therapy (unadjusted p = 0.07, adjusted p = 0.03). Anginal attacks were associated with improved QL scores, and fewer attacks occurred on TN (p = 0.06). Improvement in QL was most pronounced in patients whose recorded duration of angina was less than 8 years. 
Method and theory of monophasic action potential recording. MAP recordings have been at the cradle of cardiac electrophysiology but only recently, through safer and simpler technology, have gained wider access to clinical electrophysiology. In contrast to conventional electrode catheter recordings, MAP recording devices provide precise information not only of the local activation time but of the entire local repolarization time course as well. Although the MAP does not reflect the absolute amplitude or upstroke velocity of transmembrane action potentials, it delivers highly accurate information on the action potential duration and configuration, including early afterdepolarizations as well as relative changes in transmembrane diastolic and systolic potential changes. Based on available data, the MAP probably reflects the transmembrane voltage of cells within a few millimeters of the exploring electrode. MAPs can be recorded by catheter technique from the endocardial surface and by special probes from the epicardium in the operating room. The contact electrode technique is preferable over suction electrodes because it is safer and simpler to use in patients and because it produces more stable, longer-lasting signals. A modified contact MAP catheter incorporates pacing electrodes and permits simultaneous assessment of action potential duration and refractoriness. This not only facilitates the use of MAP catheters in routine electrophysiological studies but also is important for assessing the voltage-independent effects of antiarrhythmic drugs on refractoriness. MAP recordings offer the opportunity to study, in the in situ heart, a variety of pertinent electrophysiological phenomena including, for example, effects of cycle length changes and antiarrhythmic drugs on action potential duration or the role of afterdepolarizations in the genesis of triggered arrhythmias. Due to vigorous heart beating, movement artifacts may occur and need to be distinguished from true abnormalities in the action potential time course. With these limitations in mind, MAP recordings are a valuable addition to clinical electrophysiological studies. 
Screening for sleep apnea using pulse oximetry and a clinical score. Confirmation of the diagnosis of OSA currently requires overnight polysomnography. This study evaluates the usefulness of pulse oximetry together with a clinical score in identifying OSA. Forty patients were assigned a clinical score based on the presence or absence of loud snoring, observations of interrupted breathing during sleep, hypersomnolence, obesity and essential hypertension. Each underwent a night of domiciliary pulse oximetry followed by nocturnal polysomnography. Significant OSA was confirmed in 26. All 15 patients with positive pulse oximetry tracings had significant OSA (apnea index greater than or equal to 10). Five of eight with negative tracings were also shown to have significant OSA along with six of the seven patients with inadequate or indeterminate tracings. Clinical scores were significantly different for those with and without OSA. This study confirms the usefulness of nocturnal pulse oximetry in establishing the diagnosis of OSA and highlights the value of a clinical score in improving its sensitivity as a screening tool. 
Hemodynamic and metabolic responses to graded microvascular occlusion. The hemodynamic and metabolic consequences of microvascular occlusion, often present in the runoff bed of distal arterial reconstructions, have been difficult to quantitate clinically. To investigate these pathophysiologic relationships, a porcine hindlimb model was developed in which arteriolar patency, which we term outflow capacity, may be quantitatively defined and reduced by serial distal microembolization with 70 microns flow-directed glass bubbles. In 10 anesthetized adult pigs, hindlimb perfusion was limited to femoral artery flow (FAF) by collateral ligation. Serial measurements of outflow resistance (OR), femoral artery flow, and resting muscle pH (mpH), a metabolic index of tissue perfusion, were made as relative outflow capacity (ROC) underwent graded reduction from 1.0 (baseline) to 0 (complete occlusion). Femoral artery flow decreased linearly (FAF = 87 ROC - 3), and outflow resistance increased in hyperbolic fashion (OR = 1.66/ROC) in response to graded peripheral microembolization, whereas resting muscle pH followed a more complex relationship (In mpH = 0.055 ROC + 1.95). An integrated analysis of these results suggests that a 50% to 60% reduction in arteriolar patency represents a critical point beyond which outflow resistance rises rapidly and hindlimb flow decreases to levels that are inadequate to support the metabolic demands of resting tissues. 
The fibromyalgia impact questionnaire: development and validation. An instrument has been developed to assess the current health status of women with the fibromyalgia syndrome. The Fibromyalgia Impact Questionnaire (FIQ) is a brief 10-item, self-administered instrument that measures physical functioning, work status, depression, anxiety, sleep, pain, stiffness, fatigue, and well being. We describe its development and validation. This initial assessment indicates that the FIQ has sufficient evidence of reliability and validity to warrant further testing in both research and clinical situations. 
Effect of salbutamol on gastroesophageal reflux in healthy volunteers and patients with asthma. The aim of this work was to establish whether beta-adrenergic agonists promote or increase gastroesophageal reflux in patients with asthma. Ten healthy individuals and eight patients with asthma were studied on 2 different days. One day they received a placebo, and the other day they received 4 mg of salbutamol by mouth. Complete measurements of esophageal manometry were performed before and every 30 minutes for 210 minutes after the administration of the drugs. Esophageal pH was measured continuously for the duration of the experiment. The results demonstrate that (1) salbutamol had no effect on the lower esophageal sphincter pressure gradient, the peak esophageal contraction pressure, or the number and duration of reflux episodes in patients with asthma and normal individuals, and (2) patients with asthma have a resting lower esophageal sphincter pressure higher than healthy subjects. We conclude that the administration of salbutamol does not affect esophageal function. 
Neurotoxicity of intraventricularly administered alpha-interferon for leptomeningeal disease. Nine patients with leptomeningeal disease are reported who were treated with intraventricular alpha-interferon (alpha-IFN). In seven of these patients, a progressive vegetative state developed during treatment. The patients became unresponsive to verbal commands but opened their eyes with auditory or tactile stimulation. It took an average of 3 weeks for these patients to become verbally responsive after treatment was discontinued. Electroencephalographic findings showed evidence of irritative involvement of the deep midline nuclei in 80% of patients. Periventricular white matter changes developed during treatment in three of six patients who underwent computed tomographic scans. All patients with this severe neurotoxicity received whole-brain irradiation before treatment. Possible mechanisms for the development of this neurotoxic syndrome are discussed. The neurotoxicity of alpha-IFN and brain irradiation may be additive, suggesting a cautious approach when using this combination for treatment. 
The survival of total knee arthroplasty in patients with osteonecrosis of the medial condyle. The results of total knee arthroplasty in patients with osteonecrosis of the medial femoral condyle were examined using Kaplan-Meier survival analysis. The study included 32 osteonecrotic knees with an average final follow-up examination of 3.9 years. For comparison, 63 osteoarthrotic knees with an average final follow-up examination of 4.6 years were also analyzed. The survival rates were calculated using four distinct categories of failure: (1) revision, (2) revision or radiolucency, (3) revision, radiolucency, or pain, and (4) pain. On the basis of pain relief alone, the five-year postoperative success rate was 82% for osteonecrosis (eight knees) and 90% for osteoarthrosis (27 knees), with no significant statistical difference between the two groups. 
Emergency department presentation of renal dialysis patients: indications for EMS transport directly to dialysis centers. To determine the pattern of emergency department (ED) utilization by renal dialysis (RD) patients, a prospective study was conducted of dialysis patients presenting to the ED of a regional dialysis center. The most common presenting complaints were shortness of breath (SOB), chest pain, abdominal pain, and vomiting; the most common diagnoses were congestive heart failure, chest wall pain, and electrolyte abnormalities. Interventional dialysis (ID), defined as emergent dialysis required to treat the patient's presenting complaint, was required for 30 patients, with the most common presenting complaints of these patients being shortness of breath, weakness, and chest pain. Only SOB was statistically significant in predicting the need for ID (P less than 0.001), with a positive predictive value of 0.63 and a negative predictive value of 0.85. Prehospital implications of these data suggest that RD patients with a chief complaint of SOB should be transported directly to a facility capable of dialysis on an emergent basis. 
Nuclear magnetic resonance imaging for assessment and follow-up of patients with valve disease. Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) imaging now offers a powerful means of assessing a variety of clinically important parameters in patients with valvular heart disease. NMR approaches will probably be most useful in patients with chronic valvular regurgitation, in which there continues to be uncertainty regarding the optimum timing for surgical intervention. In these patients it is possible to simultaneously assess both the valvular regurgitation and the resulting changes in myocardial structure and function. In patients with aortic stenosis, NMR can be applied to the assessment of left ventricular mass, both before and after valvuloplasty or valve replacement. In mitral stenosis, NMR may be applied to the assessment of right ventricular volumes and function. NMR may be used for the detection of prosthetic valve regurgitation when Doppler studies are equivocal. Finally, NMR imaging may be applied in patients with congenital or aortic root disease to evaluate valvular function in addition to diagnostic assessment of such patients. The future development of isotropic three-dimensional acquisition approaches, ultrafast imaging strategies, automated surface detection techniques, and more rapid function and flow analysis could considerably enhance the use of the current NMR approaches. The application of spectroscopic techniques could provide a means of monitoring myocardial metabolic abnormalities in ventricles exposed to chronic overload. Meanwhile, in patients with valvular regurgitation and stenosis, it would seem timely to initiate long-term serial NMR studies to further define natural history and the effects of various medical regimens and to ultimately help determine optimum medical and interventional regimens. 
Calcium antagonists: an overview. Calcium antagonists reduce the influx of calcium ions through the calcium channels. This causes a reduction in myocardial contractility or a fall in vascular resistance because of a lowering of vascular smooth muscle tone. Therefore, the net effect is a fall in blood pressure. The three major classes of calcium antagonists, the dihydropyridines, papaverine derivatives, and benzothiazepines, differ in molecular structure and their binding characteristics to the calcium channels. Furthermore, newer antagonists, particularly the dihydropyridines such as nicardipine, have a high affinity for vascular tissue and are highly selective for vascular smooth muscle. These compounds also have a favorable effect on hypertension mainly because of lowering of vascular resistance. In addition, they do not cause potentially negative metabolic effects on glucose or lipid levels and are generally well tolerated. Based on these findings, the Joint National Committee in the United States and the World Health Organization/International Society of Hypertension Committee on the Management of Mild Hypertension recommended the use of calcium antagonists as first-line treatment in hypertension. 
Prognostic value of proliferative activity in lymph node metastases of patients with breast cancer. Whether the proliferative activity of distant metastases could be predicted by the proliferation in axillary lymph node metastases was investigated in 304 lymph nodes metastases of 52 patients with breast cancer who had not received adjuvant treatment. The standard deviation of the mean mitotic index (MI)--the average number of mitoses per field in 10 high power fields--was of the best prognostic valve in univariate survival analysis. None of the classic (volume % epithelium and stroma) or morphometric features (nuclear area, nuclear axis ratio. shape factors) provided significant results. In Cox regression analysis a multivariate combination of the mean MI, the SD of the mean MI, and the maximum MI emerged, which provided a satisfying means of differentiating patients with a good (68% survival) and a poor (28% survival) prognosis. Proliferation variables derived from axillary lymph node metastases of patients with breast cancer can predict the clinical course of distant metastases. 
Nonoperative management of splenic injuries. The traditional management of splenic trauma has undergone major revision in recent years. Given the physiological importance of the spleen, certain controversy has arisen regarding the most appropriate method of managing this type of trauma. Nonoperative therapy in children has proven to be successful not only in the case of kidney lesions but also for splenic lesions. Nonoperative management carried out in the authors' hospital on a group of 56 patients (49 adults and seven children over the age of 7 years) has proved successful in 37 cases. The success of this technique requires a well-formulated protocol, diagnostic methods (ultrasound and computed tomography), rigorous patient control in the emergency room during the initial phase (first 48 hours), the availability of a medical team if surgical intervention becomes necessary (persistent or recurrent hemorrhage), and complementary measures which facilitate the cicatrization of the splenic injury (bed rest, antibiotic therapy). 
Eight-year outcome in infants with birth weight of 500 to 999 grams: continuing regional study of 1979 and 1980 births. Victorian Infant Collaborative Study Group. The outcome at a mean age of 8.3 years was determined for 88 of 89 surviving children with birth weights of 500 to 999 gm who were born in Victoria in 1979 and 1980; the condition of the untraced child, severely disabled at 5 years of age, was assumed to be unchanged at 8 years. Principal impairments in the children at 8 years of age were cerebral palsy 8 (9%); bilateral blindness 6 (6.7%) and poor vision in another 4 (4.5%); bilateral deafness requiring amplification 5 (5.6%); and epilepsy 2 (2.2%). The Full Scale score of the Weschler Intelligence Scales for Children--Revised was available for 77 children: 5 scores (6.5%) were less than 71 (low IQ), and 9 (11.7%) were between 71 and 85 (borderline IQ). Severe disability in 16 children (18%) was due to severe cerebral palsy, bilateral blindness, or low IQ. Mild or moderate disability was present in another 18 children (20.2%) with borderline IQ, mild or moderate cerebral palsy, poor vision, deafness, or epilepsy. Significantly more outborn children (10/18, 55.6%) than inborn children (24/71, 33.8%) were disabled. Ten children required special schooling; reading accuracy or comprehension was at least 18 months behind chronologic age in 17 (23%) of 75 children in normal school who were tested. The 2-year assessment correctly estimated the category of disability at 8 years of age in 55 (62%), overestimated it in 24 (27%), and underestimated it in 10 (11%). For the 82 children also seen at 5 years age, the category of disability at 8 years of age was correctly identified in 69 children (84%), overestimated in 4 (5%), and underestimated in 9 (11%). Change in psychologic test scores was the principal reason for reclassifying children. We conclude that the 2-yar assessment was valuable in the early identification of most of the severely disabled children, but developmental delay at 2 years of age did not always portend intellectual impairment at 8 years of age. 
Mixed acid fermentation of glucose as a mechanism of emphysematous urinary tract infection. Emphysematous pyelonephritis is a severe necrotizing infection that usually occurs in patients with diabetes mellitus or obstructive uropathy. Although glucose fermentation has been considered as the main cause of gas production the actual mechanism remains controversial. Compositions of gas samples from 2 patients with emphysematous pyelonephritis recently encountered were analyzed, and showed 15% hydrogen, 4.8% carbon dioxide, 60% nitrogen, 6.7% oxygen and some unknown gases in case 1, and 3.4% hydrogen, 22% carbon dioxide, 66% nitrogen and 9.8% oxygen in case 2. These results tend to implicate mixed acid fermentation of glucose as the pathway by which emphysematous urinary tract infections develop. 
Does hyperkinetic circulation constitute a pre-hypertensive stage? A 5-year follow-up of haemodynamics in young men with mild blood pressure elevation. In a previous haemodynamic examination, 44 young men (18-22 years) with blood pressure elevation above the 98th percentile, mean arterial blood pressure (MAP) greater than or equal to 95 +/- 6 mm Hg, showed an increased cardiac index (dye-dilution) and an enhanced resistance at maximal vasodilation of the hand (venous occlusion plethysmography during hyperaemia). This latter finding suggested arteriolar wall hypertrophy. However, the subgroup with the highest cardiac index (greater than or equal to 3.86 1 min-1 x m2) (n = 18) displayed normal vascular resistance at maximal dilation in comparison with the normotensive control group (n = 29). Consequently, functional signs of arteriolar hypertrophy were restricted to individuals with normal or low cardiac index. At the re-investigation 5 years later, a significant reduction in blood pressure was observed in the normotensive control group (MAP: from 88 +/- 7 to 85 +/- 7 mm Hg, P less than 0.05). There was no change in individuals with initially elevated blood pressure. Furthermore, cardiac index fell significantly with time in this latter group. Thus, the blood pressure elevation in the hypertensive group, previously mainly dependent on high blood flow was, 5 years later, more related to an increased total peripheral resistance, (delta total peripheral resistance = 8%). However, no definite evidence indicating development of hypertrophy of the resistance vessels of the hand was observed during the follow-up period. Since the hyperkinetic subgroup did not display a concomitant fall in blood pressure with cardiac output, our results do not support the theory that the hyperkinetic form of borderline hypertension is a temporary phenomenon, explained by the inclusion of anxious individuals afraid of the experimental situation. Hyperkinetic hypertension may be the initial phase of sustained hypertension in a subgroup of the future hypertensive population. 
Nonmelanoma skin cancer mortality. A population-based study. To estimate the magnitude of nonmelanoma skin cancer mortality and describe its parameters, we reviewed the medical records of all deaths certified as due to this cause among Rhode Island residents from 1979 through 1987. After excluding acquired immunodeficiency syndrome-associated Kaposi's sarcoma, we confirmed that nonmelanoma skin cancer was the cause of death for 51 individuals, a quarter of the number of melanoma deaths reported. The age-adjusted nonmelanoma skin cancer mortality rate was 0.44/10(5) per year. Fifty-nine percent were due to squamous cell carcinoma, and 20% were due to basal cell carcinoma. Most appeared actinically induced. Among deaths from squamous cell carcinoma, the mean age was 73 years. At least 80% of the squamous cell carcinomas metastasized, and 47% arose on the ear. None appeared due to refusal of treatment. Among deaths from basal cell carcinoma, the mean age was 85 years, and refusal of surgical intervention was documented in 40%. Study of nonmelanoma skin cancer mortality provides for estimation of the magnitude of this problem, complements other studies of prognosis, and helps guide prevention, early detection, and treatment. 
Acoustic-distortion products: separation of sensory from neural dysfunction in sensorineural hearing loss in human beings and rabbits. Because distortion-product otoacoustic emissions (DPOAEs) provide a noninvasive measure of outer hair-cell (OHC) activity, they should provide a unique and sensitive indicator of the effects of agents that damage hearing. Using DPOAE methods, the present study was designed to assess the relative contributions of the cochlea's outer hair cells to some common sensorineural diseases, including Meniere's disease, acoustic neuroma, and noise-induced, hereditary, and sudden idiopathic sensorineural hearing loss. Parallel evaluations of DPOAEs were performed under essentially identical conditions in rabbit models of several of the human disorders, including noise-induced hearing loss, endolymphatic hydrops, and cochlear neurectomy. Animal studies were performed to assess the proficiency of DPOAEs to track a developing sensorineural deficit as well as to compare patterns of DPOAE dysfunction between clinical and experimental forms of peripheral hearing loss. Detailed measures of DPOAEs were collected in the stimulus-frequency and intensity domains as "audiograms" and response/growth or input/output functions, respectively. The outcome of analyses of both human beings and animals supported the notion that DPOAE testing is sensitive to sensory-cell disease. Thus, in combination with conventional audiometry, DPOAE measures permit a distinction between the relative contribution sensory and neural components of the cochlea make to hearing deficits. 
Acute gall bladder perforation--a dilemma in early diagnosis. Gall bladder perforation is a rare complication of cholecystitis. A definitive diagnosis is uncommon before surgery and the morbidity and mortality associated with this condition are high. We report six patients with gall bladder perforation to show the difficulty of making an early diagnosis. The history and the clinical findings of these patients are reviewed to highlight diagnostic pitfalls. 
Early abdominal complications following heart and heart-lung transplantation. In the first 11 years of the heart and heart-lung transplantation programme at Papworth Hospital, Cambridge, 356 patients underwent heart transplantation, and 73 patients received both heart and lungs. Out of 429 patients 41 (9.5 per cent) developed abdominal complications within the first 30 days, and 20 of the 41 required surgery. The complications included pancreatitis (10), peptic ulceration (8), and pseudo-obstruction (8), in addition to colonic perforation and small bowel obstruction. When laparotomy was performed it was well tolerated. This paper supports the view that successful management of abdominal complications following transplantation requires prompt diagnosis and treatment. Where doubt exists in the presence of an acute abdomen, laparotomy is the appropriate way to establish a definitive diagnosis. 
Comparison of the combined effects of atropine and neostigmine with atropine and edrophonium on the lower oesophageal sphincter. In two groups (n = 11) of healthy patients, we have measured gastric, lower oesophageal and barrier pressures before and after antagonism of neuromuscular block during anaesthesia with nitrous oxide and isoflurane. In one group, atropine 1.2 mg and neostigmine 2.5 mg were given and in the second group atropine 0.6 mg with edrophonium 1 mg/kg. One minute after administration of the reversal agents, there was a significantly greater reduction in barrier pressures in the neostigmine and atropine group than in the edrophonium and atropine group, but subsequently, there was no significant difference between the two groups. We conclude that there is no clinical difference between the two reversal mixtures in terms of the risk of regurgitation in the immediate period after reversal. 
Auditory nerve compound action potentials and brain stem auditory evoked potentials in patients with various degrees of hearing loss. Click-evoked compound action potentials recorded in normal-hearing patients through a monopolar electrode placed on the intracranial portion of the eighth nerve were compared with the responses recorded in patients with high-frequency hearing loss or with high- and low-frequency hearing losses. That multiple peaks appear in the compound action potential in patients with hearing loss implies that click sounds elicit successive and separated volleys of neural excitation in the ascending auditory pathway, whereas click sounds in patients with normal hearing mainly give rise to a single volley of neural activity. This difference in the pattern of auditory nerve activity might explain why there are often multiple peaks in the brain stem auditory evoked potentials in patients with hearing loss and that the peaks are often less well-defined than peaks in patients with normal hearing. 
Determination of severity of valvular aortic stenosis by Doppler echocardiography and relation of findings to clinical outcome and agreement with hemodynamic measurements determined at cardiac catheterization. To determine the relation of Doppler findings to clinical outcome and the agreement between Doppler and cardiac catheterization in the assessment of aortic stenosis (AS) severity, 510 consecutive patients with suspected AS studied in our laboratory were analyzed. Adequate echocardiographic and Doppler examinations were obtained in 498 patients or 98% of the population. Clinical data were available for analysis in 497 patients. In 160 patients, Doppler demonstrated an aortic valve area less than or equal to 0.75 cm2 or a peak jet velocity greater than or equal to 4.5 m/s consistent with critical AS. In the subgroup with cardiac catheterization (n = 105), Doppler was 97% accurate. Aortic valve replacement or balloon valvuloplasty was performed in 109 patients, 106 of whom were symptomatic. Noncritical AS was detected by Doppler in 327 patients, with 95% accuracy in the subgroup with cardiac catheterization (n = 133). Aortic valve replacement was performed in 15 patients with symptoms of AS and with valve areas assessed by Doppler to be between 0.76 and 0.80 cm2 or with peak jet velocities greater than 3.5 m/s. In 20 patients, aortic valve replacement was performed because of moderate to severe aortic regurgitation, and in 11 elderly (greater than 70 years old) patients with valve areas between 0.80 and 1.0 cm2, valve replacement was performed at the time of coronary artery bypass surgery in an attempt to prevent the need for a repeat surgical procedure in the future. These observations allow the following conclusions. In the symptomatic patient with critical or near critical AS by Doppler, cardiac catheterization does not provide additional information beyond that provided by Doppler. 
Lord's procedure--the best operation for hydrocele? A prospective study was carried out to compare Lord's hydrocele operation with traditional surgical procedures. The groups of patients investigated were comparable in terms of age, period of observation, number of previous aspirations and size of hydrocele. The incidence of isolated hydrocele of the spermatic cord, as well as epididymal cysts, was lower in the patients who underwent Lord's procedure (7.2 versus 15.8%), as was the percentage of patients reporting post-operative pain for more than 3 days (4.3 versus 15.8%, p less than 0.05). 
Comparison of commercially available cytokeratin antibodies in normal and neoplastic adult epithelial and non-epithelial tissues. Five commercially available cytokeratin antibodies (lu-5, AE1/AE3, CAM 5.2, MFN116 and anti-cytokeratin 18) were used to stain a wide range of normal and neoplastic epithelial and non-epithelial tissues to assess their potential value in diagnostic histopathology. All five showed good specificity, with some cross-reactivity in smooth muscle cells. The wider reactivity of AE1/AE3, lu-5, and MFN 116, which includes cytokeratins 8,18 (Moll's catalogue) expressed in simple epithelia and their tumours, as well as cytokeratins expressed in complex stratified squamous epithelia, permits identification of a wider range of epithelial derived tumours. This wider spectrum of reactivity may allow these antibodies to be used in a diagnostic panel for the identification of poorly differentiated tumours. 
Improving palliation in pancreatic cancer: intraoperative celiac plexus block for pain relief. Most patients with pancreatic carcinoma are not curable. Surgical palliation of obstructive jaundice and gastric outlet obstruction leaves many patients with severe pain from pancreatic carcinoma. Anesthesiologists have drawn increasing attention to the successful use of postoperative percutaneous celiac plexus block for the treatment of pancreatic pain. Ironically, little attention has been paid to celiac plexus block during laparotomy. We reviewed the cases of 12 patients with pancreatic carcinoma and severe abdominal pain who were treated surgically. All patients had operative celiac plexus block with absolute alcohol at the time of exploratory laparotomy for biliary bypass, gastroenterostomy, or tumor biopsy. Complete postoperative pain relief was obtained in 10 of the 12 patients; two had only partial relief. No operative complications were related to celiac plexus block; one patient died postoperatively of pneumonia. Average postoperative hospital stay was 13 days and average postoperative survival was 3 1/2 months. Most patients had excellent pain relief for at least 2 months or until death. Because most patients treated surgically for pancreatic carcinoma are receiving only palliation with biliary bypass or gastroenterostomy, surgeons should pay increased attention to pain relief. Operative celiac plexus block is easy, safe, and highly effective in relieving the agonizing pain of pancreatic carcinoma. 
Anal tonometry: a quick method of anal manometry. Evaluation of anal sphincter tonic activity is important in the proctologic clinic. However, manometric techniques are expensive, complex, and only available in some centers. Because there is often an in-office need for having objective measurements of anal tonic activity, in our clinic we introduced a simple method for measurement of anal pressures. This method is based on the flow of air in an open circuit by using a rubber probe with a side opening at one end. Pressure is assessed by an ordinary manometric gauge for arterial pressure. With this simple instrument, the following parameters are measured: 1) anal resting pressure, 2) squeeze pressure, 3) functional length of the anal canal, and 4) descent of the perineum on staining. After testing the technique in 100 healthy persons, it was applied to 130 patients with several proctologic disorders. Differences in pressures were found between controls and patients with anal fissure (high resting pressures), and patients with anal incontinence (low resting and/or squeeze pressures). A correlation was also found between the descending perineum measured by this method and by defecography. This simple instrument is useful in the office as the first approach to the function of the anal sphincters and the pelvic floor. Nowadays, so-called anal tonometry is part of the proctologic examination in our department, because it is simple, reliable, and takes only a few minutes. 
Interrelationship of blood transfusion, non-A, non-B hepatitis and hepatocellular carcinoma: analysis by detection of antibody to hepatitis C virus. To clarify the relationship between hepatitis C virus infection and the development of hepatocellular carcinoma as sequelae of non-A, non-B posttransfusion hepatitis, 231 patients with chronic non-A, non-B hepatitis (96 with chronic hepatitis, 81 with cirrhosis and 54 with hepatocellular carcinoma) were analyzed for antibody to hepatitis C virus and were compared with 125 patients with chronic hepatitis B (50 with chronic hepatitis, 46 with cirrhosis and 29 with hepatocellular carcinoma). Antibody to hepatitis C virus was detected in 89.6%, 86.4% and 94.4% of patients with non-A, non-B hepatitis-related chronic hepatitis, cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma, respectively, compared with 6%, 17.4% and 34.5% with similar diseases related to hepatitis B. A history of transfusion was documented in 52%, 33% and 42% of anti-hepatitis C virus-positive cases of chronic hepatitis, cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. The mean intervals between the date of transfusion and the date of diagnosis of anti-hepatitis C virus-positive chronic hepatitis, cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma were 10, 21.2 and 29 yr, respectively. In 21 patients with transfusion-associated hepatocellular carcinoma, anti-hepatitis C virus was present in each serial sample available for testing, including samples obtained up to 14 yr before the diagnosis of hepatocellular carcinoma. These data suggest the slow, sequential progression from acute hepatitis C virus-related non-A, non-B hepatitis through chronic hepatitis and cirrhosis to hepatocellular carcinoma and support a causal association between hepatitis C virus and hepatocellular carcinoma. 
Left ventricular diastolic filling alterations in normotensive young adults with a family history of systemic hypertension. To characterize the cardiovascular consequences of a history of hypertension in first-degree relatives in normotensive young adults, 72 normotensive (diastolic blood pressure [BP] less than 90 mm Hg) healthy volunteers (age 18 to 30 years) were studied with 2 dimensionally guided M-mode echocardiography, pulsed Doppler echocardiography, and 2-hour automated BP monitoring. Of the 72 subjects, 19 (12 men and 7 women) had a family history of hypertension and were compared with 19 subjects without a family history of hypertension who were matched for systolic BP and gender. There were no detectable differences in 2-hour average BP, left ventricular (LV) mass or wall thickness, or echocardiographic systolic functional indexes between subjects with and without a family history of hypertension. Doppler-derived diastolic functional indexes demonstrated more prominent late diastolic filling in subjects with a family history of hypertension. Late diastolic transmitral flow time and flow velocity integral were greater (132 +/- 24 vs 117 +/- 17 ms, p less than 0.05; and 2.5 +/- 0.7 vs 1.9 +/- 0.5 cm, p less than 0.01, respectively). To measure possible gender-related effects of a family history of hypertension, the men and women were analyzed separately. The 12 men with a family history of hypertension had greater peak late (40 +/- 0.9 vs 31 +/- 0.8 cm/s, p less than 0.02) and ratio of late-to-early (0.64 +/- 0.19 vs 0.46 +/- 0.10, p less than 0.01) transmitral flow velocities and greater late transmitral flow velocity integrals (2.6 +/- 0.8 vs 1.9 +/- 0.5 cm, p less than 0.05) than the matched male control subjects. 
Enterogastric reflux after various types of antiulcer gastric surgery: quantitation by 99mTc-HIDA scintigraphy. In 28 controls and 142 patients subjected to a variety of antiulcer procedures, the enterogastric reflux (EGR) was quantitated by 99mTc-HIDA scintigraphy and expressed as the EGR index on 229 different occasions. The EGR index was calculated according to two different formulas: one based on the maximal radioactivity over the gastric area as a percentage value of the total abdominal activity (EGR-Im) and the other based on the relative maximal radioactivity over the gastric area as a percentage value of the relative hepatobiliary activity (EGR-It). There was a significant positive correlation of values between the two methods (P less than 0.0001). In patients with an EGR-Im greater than 20% or EGR-It greater than 57% and postgastric surgery symptoms some of the symptoms were attributed to EGR, an antireflux procedure is expected to relieve those symptoms. Sixteen of these patients underwent Roux-en-Y gastrectomy and their preoperative symptoms were relieved. 
Tocainide and mortality after myocardial infarction: a prospective study in conscious dogs. The production of an anterior myocardial infarction as part of an experimental animal model for sudden death was burdened by a persistently elevated mortality rate (30%) despite the use of traditional antiarrhythmic drugs. Mortality was reduced when tocainide (600 mg three times daily) was empirically administered for 4 days before and 4 days after myocardial infarction. Retrospective analysis showed that mortality at 4 days after infarction was significantly lower in the tocainide-treated dogs than in the preceding large group of dogs that had not been so treated (5 [9%] of 55, versus 64 [32%] of 199, p less than 0.01). This difference was still evident 30 days after myocardial infarction (13 [24%] of 55 versus 83 [42%] of 199; p less than 0.05). This observation led to the present prospective study in 106 dogs with a similar protocol but with a randomized sequence. At 4 days after myocardial infarction, the mortality rate was 55% lower in the tocainide group than in the control group (7 [12.5%] of 56 versus 14 [28%] of 50; p less than 0.05). During the 10 days after treatment withdrawal 9 (18%) of 49 dogs in the tocainide group died compared with only 2 (5%) of 36 in the control group. This rebound in mortality produced similar survival figures in the two groups at 14 and at 30 days after infarction when mortality was 30% (17 of 56) in the tocainide group and 34% (17 of 50) in the control group. The tocainide plasma levels were 7.4 +/- 4 micrograms/ml the day before infarction and 7.2 +/- 3 micrograms/ml 3 days after infarction. 
Hereditary sacral agenesis with presacral mass and anorectal stenosis: the Currarino triad. A family with autosomal dominant inheritance of sacral agenesis is described. Ten members were affected; four had associated presacral teratomas and anterior sacral meningoceles, giving rise to serious complications in three, including bacterial meningitis, local recurrence of teratoma and perianal sepsis. Three of those with presacral masses presented initially with anorectal anomalies. Other associated abnormalities included tethering of the cord, hydrocephalus, duplex ureter, hydronephrosis, vesicoureteric reflux, neurogenic bladder, bicornuate uterus, rectovaginal fistula and hereditary spherocytosis. Early diagnosis and surgical excision of a presacral mass is advised to prevent future morbidity and mortality. 
Nutritional management of acute and chronic pancreatitis. Acute pancreatitis often results in a catabolic state characterized by profound hemodynamic, metabolic, cardiovascular, pulmonary, hematologic, and renal aberrations. Parenteral nutrition and metabolic support are essential if morbidity and mortality are to be minimized. In chronic pancreatitis, nutritional management ranges from fundamental dietary manipulation with or without administration of appropriate digestive enzymes to enteral supplementation with modular chemically defined diets to total parenteral nutrition, depending on the stage, severity, and manifestations of the disease. In prescribing nutrient substrates in both acute and chronic pancreatitis, consideration must be given to their effects on pancreatic enzyme secretion if optimal results are to be achieved. 
Antitumor effect of synthetic derivatives of lipid A in an experimental model of colon cancer in the rat. Colon carcinoma is one of the most frequent causes of cancer death in industrialized countries. The patients generally die of the metastases. In a colon cancer rat model, the authors have shown that lipopolysaccharides from Escherichia coli induced the regression of carcinomatosis and cured 20%-30% of the rats. Some synthetic derivatives of lipid A, which are less toxic than lipopolysaccharides, were injected 14 days after the tumor cells. They induced the complete regression of peritoneal carcinomatosis consisting of numerous nodules measuring 1-5 mm in 20%-30% of rats. Only compounds with three or more hydroxymyristic acid residues were effective. In vivo effects were correlated with the capacity to induce the production of interleukin 1 and tumor necrosis factor but not with the capacity to induce macrophage-mediated cytolysis. It is therefore possible to synthesize weakly toxic derivatives of lipopolysaccharides retaining their antitumoral property in vivo. 
Effectiveness of imazodan for treatment of chronic congestive heart failure. The Imazodan Research Group. A 12-week, multicenter, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial of imazodan, a type III phosphodiesterase inhibitor, was conducted in 147 patients with congestive heart failure to determine clinical efficacy and safety. Patients were randomized to placebo or 2, 5 or 10 mg of imazodan administered twice daily. Patients were maintained on their standard therapy including diuretics, digoxin and an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor. The mean ejection fraction was 23 +/- 10%. Exercise time increased from baseline in all 4 groups. There was no significant difference observed between the placebo group and any of the treated groups with regard to exercise time, ejection fraction, frequency of ventricular premature complexes or ventricular tachycardia. When analyzed by intent to treat, the placebo mortality was 7% (3 of 44) and the imazodan mortality was 8% (8 of 103) (p = not significant). This study failed to demonstrate that imazodan provided any benefit in exercise performance when compared with placebo. 
Periarticular heterotopic ossification after total hip arthroplasty. Risk factors and consequences. The formation of periarticular heterotopic bone after total hip arthroplasty is a frequent complication. The reported occurrences concerning this complication vary considerably in different reports, ranging from 15% to 90% with significant amounts in 1%-27% of the cases. Heterotopic ossification (HO) starts with the surgical operation, and the extent is well delineated on roentgenograms after six to 12 weeks. The amount of bone varies from small islands in the soft tissue to widespread bridging ossification. The cause of HO seems to be mainly related to systemic factors and is chiefly dependent on gender, diagnosis, and concurrent antiinflammatory medication. Patients at risk seem to be those with HO after a previous surgical operation, patients suffering from certain types of ankylosing spondylitis, otherwise healthy men with osteoarthrosis, patients with hypertrophic osteoarthrosis, and patients operated upon for fresh fractures or other posttraumatic conditions. The surgical technique and the local tissue trauma probably moderate both the occurrence and amount of HO. HO does not seem to cause pain or to decrease hip muscle strength but does limit hip mobility in cases with significant amount of ossification. 
The European Stroke Prevention Study: results according to sex. The European Stroke Prevention Study was a multicenter trial comparing the effect of a combination of 75 mg dipyridamole and 330 mg acetylsalicylic acid tid with placebo in the prevention of stroke or death after one or more attacks of recent transient ischemic attacks or stroke of atherothrombotic origin. From the 2,500 patients in the intention-to-treat analysis, the proportion of women was 42%, and from the 1,861 patients in the explanatory analysis it was 44%. The endpoint incidence was significantly higher in men than in women. The endpoint reduction was statistically significant only in the intention-to-treat analysis with total endpoints. However, there was a marked percentage reduction of endpoints in both men and women in explanatory analysis. The risk reduction of strokes was 49% for men and 41% for women, and the reduction of total endpoints was 39% in men and 30% in women. Thus, antiplatelet therapy is effective in the prevention of stroke or death in both sexes. 
Pseudoaneurysm of the popliteal artery as a complication of an osteochondroma. A review of the literature and a case report. False aneurysm of the femoral artery was associated with a solitary osteochondroma of the femur in a 22-year-old man. An extensive review of the literature and the problems related to diagnosis revealed that the aneurysm was apparently unique. Contrary to previous reports, computed tomography and angiography did not establish the diagnosis. The physical findings were more informative. 
External cardiopulmonary resuscitation preserves brain viability after prolonged cardiac arrest in dogs. Standard external cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) steps A-B-C produce a low blood flow that may or may not preserve brain viability during prolonged cardiac arrest. A dog model was used with ventricular fibrillation (VF) of 20 minutes, reperfusion with brief cardiopulmonary bypass, controlled ventilation to 20 hours, and intensive care to 96 hours. A retrospective comparison was made of the results of one series, now called "group I" (n = 10)--which received CPR basic life support interposed from VF 10 to 15 minutes, and CPR advanced life support with epinephrine (without defibrillation) from VF 15 to 20 minutes--to the results of another series, now "control group II" (n = 10)--which received VF no flow (no CPR) for 20 minutes. All 20 dogs within protocol were resuscitated. All 10 of group I and 7 of 10 of group II survived to 96 hours. Pupillary light reflex returned after the start of cardiopulmonary bypass at 7.7 +/- 3.7 minutes in CPR group I, versus 16.3 +/- 7.4 minutes in control group II (P = .032). At 96 hours postarrest, final overall performance categories (1, normal; 5, brain death) were better in group I. Six of 10 dogs achieved normality (overall performance category 1) in group I, as compared with none of 10 in group II (P = .004). Final neurologic deficit score (0%, best; 100% worst) was lower (better) in group I (15% +/- 20%) than in group II (51% +/- 6%; P less than .001). 
Long-term follow-up after prosthetic replacement of the superior vena cava combined with resection of mediastinal-pulmonary malignant tumors. The contraindication to curative excision of mediastinal and pulmonary cancers because of invasion of the superior vena cava is now challenged by the existence of vascular prostheses that are suitable for venous replacement. Between 1979 and 1990 22 patients underwent resection of lung cancer (n = 6) or malignant mediastinal tumors (n = 16) involving the superior vena cava. Resection was done with concomitant venous reconstruction, and polytetrafluorethylene grafts were used. All bronchogenic carcinomas necessitated right pneumonectomy, whereas the excision of mediastinal tumors had to include pulmonary resections in nine patients (five lobectomies and four sublobar resections) and the right phrenic nerve in 12 patients. Venous reconstruction was performed by interposition of a large polytetrafluoroethylene graft between the proximal and cardiac ends of the superior vena cava (n = 8), or between one (n = 10) or both brachiocephalic veins (n = 4) and the right atrium. One patient died postoperatively (4.5%), and another had mediastinitis that was successfully treated by omentopexy. Chemotherapy was administered preoperatively to five patients and postoperatively to seven patients; radiotherapy was administered to two and 10 patients, respectively. The overall actuarial survival rate is 48% at 5 years, with 11 patients presently alive. The survival rate of patients with mediastinal tumors is 60% at 5 years. Among the patients with lung cancer, two with N1 disease are alive at 16 and 51 months, and one died at 38 months; the two patients with N2 disease died at 6 and 8 months. Only one graft occlusion occurred in the postoperative period; another occurred 14 months after operation and was precipitated by insertion of a central venous catheter. The patency of all remaining grafts was demonstrated after an average time of 23 (1 to 98) months. On the basis of these results, polytetrafluoroethylene graft replacement of the superior vena cava should be part of the planning and execution of radical excision with curative intent of mediastinal and right pulmonary malignant tumors that are not present with other contraindications, such as pleural or distant metastasis and severe systemic disease. 
Expression and secretion of leukocyte chemotactic cytokines by normal human melanocytes and melanoma cells. The capacity of human melanocytes and melanoma cells to produce IL-8 and monocyte chemotactic and activating factor (MCAF) was investigated. Melanocytes expressed mRNA for IL-8 and MCAF, when stimulated with either IL-1 alpha or TNF alpha, but not when stimulated with IL-6, IFN gamma, or LPS alone. IL-8 and MCAF could be induced in a dose-dependent fashion with doses as low as 0.1 ng/ml TNF alpha and 0.5 ng/ml IL-1 alpha. IL-8 and MCAF mRNA were rapidly expressed and peaked between 2 and 4 h for IL-8 and between 4 and 8 h for MCAF. This correlated well with the accumulation of IL-8 antigen as measured by a radioimmunoassay. Supernatants from melanocyte cultures stimulated with either IL-1 alpha or TNF alpha and separated on a heparin-Sepharose column became positive for neutrophil and monocyte chemotactic activity in a dose- and time-dependent fashion. When IFN gamma was added to melanocyte cultures stimulated with suboptimal doses of TNF alpha there was a synergistic increase in secreted IL-8 protein and monocyte chemotactic activity. These data provide further evidence for the possible role of melanocytes in the initiation of an inflammatory reaction. Three different malignant melanoma cell lines stimulated with either TNF alpha or IL-1 alpha expressed IL-8 mRNA, but not mRNA for MCAF. The IL-8 mRNA signal corresponded well with the amount of secreted IL-8 protein. These data suggest that IL-8 and MCAF may play a role in growth regulation and spreading of melanomas. 
[35S]methionine interaction with rat liver tRNA and effect of chemical carcinogens. The interaction of [35S]methionine with hepatic tRNA in normal, carcinogen-treated, and partially hepatectomized rats was studied. tRNA was preferentially labeled following [35S]methionine (1.6 mCi, 25 mg/kg body wt) administration by intraperitoneal injection. The extent of [35S]methionine-tRNA interaction was impaired by partial hepatectomy and by conditions having a carcinogenic potential. 
Inhibition of promoter activity by methylation: possible involvement of protein mediators. To study the relationship between DNA methylation and promoter activity we have methylated in vitro the promoters of the mouse metallothionein I gene and the herpes simplex virus thymidine kinase gene. We have transiently transfected these promoters fused to the human growth hormone in their methylated or unmethylated state into mouse L or F9 cells. Promoters methylated by methylase (M.) Hpa II and M.Hha I caused inhibition of reporter gene expression in L cells but not in F9 cells, while methylation of all CpGs by M.Sss I caused inhibition in both cell lines. Repression of promoter activity by M.Hpa II and M.Hha I methylation, but not by M.Sss I methylation, could be alleviated by cotransfection with an excess of untranscribable DNA methylated with M.Sss I. The methylated sites in nuclei isolated from the transfected L cells, but not F9 cells, were found to be protected from Msp I digestion. Taken together these results suggest that a factor present in L cells and missing in F9 cells mediates the methylation-directed inhibition of promoter activity. The ability of methylated DNA to overcome the inhibition seems to reflect competition for the mediator factor. Interestingly, treatment with Zn2+ ions brought about activation of the methylated promoter of the metallothionein gene. Similarly, butyrate could override the repression of the thymidine kinase methylated promoter. These activations were not accompanied by demethylation of the promoter or displacement of the mediator factor. 
Omega-3 fatty acids in health and disease and in growth and development. Several sources of information suggest that man evolved on a diet with a ratio of omega 6 to omega 3 fatty acids of approximately 1 whereas today this ratio is approximately 10:1 to 20-25:1, indicating that Western diets are deficient in omega 3 fatty acids compared with the diet on which humans evolved and their genetic patterns were established. Omega-3 fatty acids increase bleeding time; decrease platelet aggregation, blood viscosity, and fibrinogen; and increase erythrocyte deformability, thus decreasing the tendency to thrombus formation. In no clinical trial, including coronary artery graft surgery, has there been any evidence of increased blood loss due to ingestion of omega 3 fatty acids. Many studies show that the effects of omega 3 fatty acids on serum lipids depend on the type of patient and whether the amount of saturated fatty acids in the diet is held constant. In patients with hyperlipidemia, omega 3 fatty acids decrease low-density-lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol if the saturated fatty acid content is decreased, otherwise there is a slight increase, but at high doses (32 g) they lower LDL cholesterol; furthermore, they consistently lower serum triglycerides in normal subjects and in patients with hypertriglyceridemia whereas the effect on high-density lipoprotein (HDL) varies from no effect to slight increases. The discrepancies between animal and human studies most likely are due to differences between animal and human metabolism. In clinical trials eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) in the form of fish oils along with antirheumatic drugs improve joint pain in patients with rheumatoid arthritis; have a beneficial effect in patients with ulcerative colitis; and in combination with drugs, improve the skin lesions, lower the hyperlipidemia from etretinates, and decrease the toxicity of cyclosporin in patients with psoriasis. In various animal models omega 3 fatty acids decrease the number and size of tumors and increase the time elapsed before appearance of tumors. Studies with nonhuman primates and human newborns indicate that DHA is essential for the normal functional development of the retina and brain, particularly in premature infants. Because omega 3 fatty acids are essential in growth and development throughout the life cycle, they should be included in the diets of all humans. Omega-3 and omega 6 fatty acids are not interconvertible in the human body and are important components of practically all cell membranes. Whereas cellular proteins are genetically determined, the polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA) composition of cell membranes is to a great extent dependent on the dietary intake.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS). 
Ataxic hemiparesis associated with ipsilateral cerebellar syndrome caused by a paracentral gyrus lesion. The authors report a case of ataxic hemiparesis and an ipsilateral cerebellar syndrome in relation to a glioblastoma of the paracentral gyrus region. The physiopathology of this clinical presentation caused by compression of the corticopontine tract is discussed. 
6-mercaptopurine therapy in selected cases of corticosteroid-dependent Crohn's disease. Nineteen patients (12 children and 7 adults) with severe Crohn's disease, all of whom were dependent on corticosteroids, were treated with 6-mercaptopurine. All patients received a daily dose of 6-mercaptopurine of 50 mg; in two pediatric patients with a poor response after 2 months, the dosage was increased to 75 mg/day. A complete or partial response to 6-mercaptopurine therapy was noted in 47% of patients, and therapy failed in 53%. The age of the patients, prior resection, or initial symptoms did not influence the response. The clinical response was better in male than in female patients and in patients with involvement of both the small intestine and the colon than in those with only enteritis. 6-Mercaptopurine is a possible alternative to long-term corticosteroid therapy or surgical treatment in selected patients with severe Crohn's disease.
