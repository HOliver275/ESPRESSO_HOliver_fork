The physician's responsibilities: residua and sequelae. Cardiologists assuming responsibility for adults with congenital heart disease must have knowledge of electrophysiologic, valvular (native valves), prosthetic (valves, patches and conduits), ventricular (especially chamber function), vascular (especially elevated pulmonary vascular resistance) and noncardiovascular residua and sequelae. Acquired cardiac and noncardiac diseases coexist in older adults with postoperative congenital heart disease and add to the physician's responsibilities. 
Use of a guideline based questionnaire to audit hospital care of acute asthma. OBJECTIVES--To design an audit questionnaire and pilot its use by an audit assistant to monitor inpatient management of acute asthma and to compare the care given by chest physicians and general physicians. DESIGN--Retrospective review by a chest physician and audit assistant of a random sample of 76 case records of patients by a criterion based questionnaire developed from hospital guidelines on management of acute asthma. SETTING--One district general hospital. PATIENTS--76 adult patients with acute asthma: 38 admitted with a relevant primary diagnosis between April 1988 and March 1989 and a further 38 admitted through the accident and emergency department between April 1989 and March 1990. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES--Conformity with recognised standards for assessment and management of acute asthma before and after the audit and by chest physicians and general physicians. RESULTS--Age and sex did not differ significantly between the different groups of patients. Overall, deviations from the guidelines occurred in recording measures of severity of asthma, emergency treatment with beta 2 agonists (60/76, 79%) and steroids (43/76, 57%), and prescription of antibiotics in accordance with at least one criterion of the guidelines (29/45, 64%). Chest physicians were more rigorous than general physicians in recording severity measures, especially serum potassium concentration (chi 2 = 3.6, df = 1, p = 0.06), emergency steroid treatment within the correct period (chi 2 = 3.9, df = 1, p = 0.05), and referral for follow up at an outpatient chest clinic. Recording of arterial blood gas tensions improved significantly between the 1988-9 and 1989-90 samples (chi 2 = 7.0, df = 1, p = 0.08). CONCLUSIONS--The questionnaire proved easy to use for both doctor and audit assistant. The audit improved few standards of care and emphasises the need for further reinforcement and feedback. 
Surgical removal of massive subretinal hemorrhage associated with age-related macular degeneration. The authors report on 11 patients with age-related macular degeneration associated with massive subretinal hemorrhage, who were treated with surgical removal of the hemorrhage and associated fibrosis. Preoperative visual acuity ranged from 20/400 to hand motions. Postoperative visual acuity ranged from 20/200 to light perception with a minimum of 3 months of follow-up. Complications included partial or total retinal detachment in four patients (36%) and cataract in four patients (36%). Four of 11 patients showed some improvement in vision (36%). All four of these patients had surgery within 1 week of the onset of severe visual loss. Although surgical removal of large subretinal hemorrhages is technically feasible, visual recovery is limited, even in uncomplicated cases, by macular degenerative changes. 
Bilateral parotid secondaries from primary bronchial carcinoid tumour. Three years following a right lower lobectomy for primary carcinoid tumour of the bronchus, a patient presented with bilateral parotid masses. On investigation, both these were shown to be carcinoid tumours, consistent with metastatic spread from the primary bronchial tumour. This unique case is presented together with a discussion of the diagnostic methods employed. 
Serious infections involving the CDC group Ve bacteria Chryseomonas luteola and Flavimonas oryzihabitans. Chryseomonas luteola and Flavimonas oryzihabitans are phenotypically similar gram-negative bacilli and are also referred to as CDC groups Ve-1 and Ve-2, respectively. These bacteria are rarely reported as pathogens in humans. Infections described in the literature include primarily bacteremia in critically ill patients and peritonitis in patients undergoing continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis. We describe three cases of polymicrobial infection secondary to infection with group Ve organisms, including the first reported case (to our knowledge) of CNS infection due to F. oryzihabitans. These three cases and a review of literature suggest an association between the presence of indwelling catheters and polymicrobial infections with CDC group Ve organisms. F. oryzihabitans and C. luteola should be added to the expanding list of nosocomial pathogens with a propensity to infect critically ill patients who have undergone surgical procedures and/or had indwelling catheters placed. The isolation of either of these organisms from clinical specimens should prompt a search for a device-related source. 
Staphylococcus epidermidis induces complement activation, tumor necrosis factor and interleukin-1, a shock-like state and tissue injury in rabbits without endotoxemia. Comparison to Escherichia coli. Tumor necrosis factor (TNF) and IL-1 are thought to mediate many of the pathophysiologic changes of endotoxemia and Gram-negative bacteremia. In these studies, heat-killed Staphylococcus epidermidis were infused into rabbits to determine whether an endotoxin (LPS)-free microorganism also elicits cytokinemia and the physiologic abnormalities seen in Gram-negative bacteremia. S. epidermidis induced complement activation, circulating TNF and IL-1, and hypotension to the same degree as did one-twentieth the number of heat-killed Escherichia coli. Circulating IL-1 beta levels had a greater correlation coefficient (r = 0.81, P less than 0.001) with the degree of hypotension than TNF levels (r = 0.48, P less than 0.02). Leukopenia, thrombocytopenia, diffuse pulmonary capillary aggregation of neutrophils, and hepatic necrosis with neutrophil infiltration were observed to the same extent after either S. epidermidis or E. coli infusion. However, S. epidermidis infusion did not induce significant (less than 60 pg/ml) endotoxemia, whereas E. coli infusion resulted in high (11,000 pg/ml) serum endotoxin levels. S. epidermidis, E. coli, LPS, or S. epidermidis-derived lipoteichoic acid (LTA) induced TNF and IL-1 from blood mononuclear cells in vitro. E. coli organisms and LPS were at least 100-fold more potent than S. epidermidis or LTA. Thus, a shock-like state with similar levels of complement activation as well as circulating levels of IL-1 and TNF were observed following either S. epidermidis or E. coli. These data provide further evidence that host factors such as IL-1 and TNF are common mediators of the septic shock syndrome regardless of the organism. 
Independent genetic determinants of pancreatic and pulmonary status in cystic fibrosis The concordance of pancreatic and pulmonary status among siblings with cystic fibrosis, the cystic fibrosis genotype, and non-genetic factors were analysed in adult patients with cystic fibrosis. Genetic factors were more important than non-genetic factors in affecting the severity of pancreatic and lung disease. The genetic factors were independent of each other and did not invariably cosegregate with specific mutations at the cystic fibrosis locus. 
Pathogenetic mechanism of stroke in non-valvular atrial fibrillation: follow-up of stroke patients with and without atrial fibrillation. Stroke patients with brain infarction and non-valvular atrial fibrillation (NVAF, n = 88) or sinus rhythm (SR, n = 188), treated at a population-based stroke unit, were studied for 5 years. Within 1 month, 13% of NVAF and 2% of SR patients (P less than 0.01) had either a stroke recurrence or systemic embolism. After 5 years, the corresponding figures were 26 and 25%, respectively. The 1-month and 5-year mortality values were 35 and 78% in the NVAF group vs. 7 and 52% in the SR group (P less than 0.01). Age, ischaemic heart disease and function group on arrival at the hospital were independent risk factors for death. The main cause of death was ischaemic heart disease in the NVAF group, and complications to the initial stroke or a stroke recurrence in the SR group. Thus a higher risk of death, stroke recurrence and peripheral embolism was evident only during the first month after stroke. 
Self-reported sleep quality in HIV infection: correlation to the stage of infection and zidovudine therapy. We investigated self-reported sleep quality in a group of 50 patients in different stages of HIV-1 infection by using a standardized questionnaire (Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index). Alterations of sleep were found to be significantly correlated with the most severe stage of infection in AIDS patients. Analysis of data failed to indicate a significant influence of zidovudine on self-reported sleep quality. 
Life-threatening cervico-mediastinal haematoma after carotid sinus massage. Retropharyngeal and cervico-mediastinal haematomas are rare but potentially fatal entities. The potential for airway compression necessitates rapid assessment and treatment. A cervico-mediastinal haematoma following carotid sinus massage which required cervical drainage is presented. This is a life-threatening event demanding a high index of suspicion. A review of the literature and indications for treatment are discussed. 
Turbinate hypertrophy in habitual snorers and patients with obstructive sleep apnea: findings of acoustic rhinometry. Forty-five habitual snorers (mean respiratory disturbance index = 6) and 22 patients with obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (mean respiratory disturbance index = 36) were examined by polysomnography, radiocephalometry, rhinomanometry, nasopharyngeal videoendoscopy, and acoustic rhinometry. In 97% of these patients, hypertrophy of the inferior nasal turbinates was found by acoustic rhinometry, while increased nasal resistance of various degrees was measured in 93% of all patients by active anterior rhinomanometry. Acoustic rhinometry demonstrated that the most resistive segment was located in the anterior parts of the nasal cavity and was built up by two compartments: the region of the isthmus nasi and the region of the head of the inferior turbinate. In our snoring patients, the cross-sectional areas at the head of the inferior turbinate were always smaller than the cross-sectional areas in the isthmus nasi, which in normal controls presented the minimal cross-sectional values of the whole nasal cavity. While rhino-manometry can only measure the amount of nasal resistance, acoustic rhinometry can clearly determine the exact size and location of the different stenoses in the nasal cavity that contribute to the increased nasal resistance. 
Real-time digital contrast enhancement and magnification in the assessment of acute elbow injuries. The elbow is a common site of injury and missed fractures may lead to disability and litigation. An assessment was made of a commercially available desk-top digital contrast enhancement and magnification unit (DETECT system) in a series of 320 patients with an acute elbow injury. Five radiologists of varying experience independently viewed elbow radiographs on a conventional light-box, and subsequently using the digitizer, indicating the presence or absence of a fracture. The overall results demonstrated no difference in performance when using the unit, though small improvements in the confidence with which a definite diagnosis was made were observed. Assessment of soft tissues with the digitizer was less reliable. 
Percutaneous iliac artery stent: angiographic long-term follow-up. The authors conducted a prospective study of 49 consecutive patients with 53 lesions in 52 iliac arteries. All were treated between October 1987 and April 1990 with percutaneous transluminal angioplasty (PTA) and insertion of either a self-expandable or balloon-expandable stent. Lesions included total occlusion (28%), dissection (42%), post-PTA restenosis (21%), and unsatisfactory PTA (9%). Complications included one aortic protrusion, one acute thrombosis of the stent (resolved with urokinase), and three distal embolizations (5.7%) (resolved with urokinase and aspiration). During 15 months of follow-up, two patients died (one after occlusion). Three other occlusions occurred; one of these was resolved with local thrombolysis. Hyperplasia occurred in seven cases (13.5%), and stenosis occurred at the end of the stent because of incomplete covering of the lesion in three (5.8%); a complementary procedure was performed in six of these cases. Primary patency was 85.3% at 12 months and 80.9% at 18 months; secondary patency rate was 96.1% at 12 and at 18 months. At the end of the study, excluding data for the two patients who died, 27 limbs (54%) were asymptomatic and improvement was achieved in 19 (38%); the clinical success rate was 92%. No amputations were required. 
Early heparin therapy in patients with spontaneous intracerebral haemorrhage. In 68 patients with spontaneous intracerebral haemorrhage the effect of heparin treatment beginning on the second, fourth or tenth day was investigated. Early (day 2) low-dose heparin medication significantly lowered the incidence of pulmonary embolism. An increase in the number of patients with rebleeding was not observed. The results indicate that the early use of heparin in these patients is safe and can be recommended for the prevention of thromboembolic complications. 
Transtelephonic electrocardiographic monitoring of cardiac rehabilitation exercise sessions in coronary artery disease. Transtelephonic monitoring of a single-lead electrocardiogram and on-demand 2-way voice communication were accomplished at 1,865 exercise sessions for 67 cardiac patients. Exercise sessions occurred either at the patients' homes or at remote hospital sites and began an average of 25 or 14 weeks, respectively, after hospital dismissal. Monitoring centers provided experienced nurses to direct all exercise sessions. The transtelephonic monitoring equipment was reliable with only one instance of system failure observed. A broad spectrum of patients with coronary artery disease, including some classified at higher risk, participated in the program. Patients exercised with a variety of equipment (cycle ergometer, treadmill, arm ergometer, cross-country ski simulator, combination arm-leg cycle ergometer, rowing machine), for 30 to 50 minutes, 1 to 3 times each week. No medical emergencies occurred, although 18 specific problems were discovered that led to further evaluation or change in the medical program of specific patients. Transtelephonic monitoring of cardiac rehabilitation exercise sessions at home and at remote hospitals appears safe and is attractive because not all patients have access to supervised exercise programs; this exercise assessment helps to maximally use highly trained cardiac rehabilitation personnel. 
Epilepsy and brain tumors: implications for treatment. Primary intraparenchymal tumors of the brain are important etiologic factors in partial or focal epilepsy. Indolent low-grade gliomas may be associated with a long-standing seizure disorder refractory to medical treatment. Surgical resection of the neoplasm and the epileptogenic area may render patients seizure-free. Removal of the tumor alone may also be associated with an excellent survival rate and surgical outcome. Conventional neurosurgical procedures are restricted in patients with tumors that are deep-seated lesions or involve functional cerebral cortex. Computer-assisted stereotactic surgical procedures have been developed for biopsy and resection of intra-axial brain-mass lesions. Stereotactic tumor resection may allow pathological determination of intracranial lesions and produce a worthwhile reduction in seizure activity in some patients with intractable partial epilepsy. 
Ibopamine in the treatment of heart failure. Efficacy and safety of a drug are essential criteria to be fulfilled before a new drug receives recommendation. This review focuses on the safety of ibopamine in the treatment of chronic heart failure. Ibopamine is a new, orally active drug with a predominant action on dopaminergic adrenoceptors. As a result, it reduces systemic vascular resistance, increases cardiac output, and increases renal flow. Ibopamine also modulates the neuroendocrine reflexes in heart failure; plasma renin activity and norepinephrine and aldosterone plasma concentrations are reduced, both immediately and during sustained administration. Ibopamine has proved to be safe in many thousands of heart failure patients during long-term therapy. This argues well for its use as an alternative or additive therapy in the treatment of patients with chronic heart failure. 
Prospective randomized evaluation of ciprofloxacin versus piperacillin plus amikacin for empiric antibiotic therapy of febrile granulocytopenic cancer patients with lymphomas and solid tumors. The European Organization for Research on Treatment of Cancer International Antimicrobial Therapy Cooperative Group. Empiric therapy for febrile granulocytopenic patients is mandatory, but whether monotherapy is a safe alternative and whether fluoroquinolones are useful agents for this indication are still controversial issues. The use of monotherapy with intravenous ciprofloxacin (200 to 300 mg every 12 h) was evaluated against combined therapy with piperacillin plus amikacin in febrile granulocytopenic patients with solid tumor or lymphoma. The study was discontinued prematurely because patients treated with ciprofloxacin had a significantly lower overall success rate than patients treated with piperacillin plus amikacin (31 of 48 patients [65%] versus 48 of 53 patients [91%], P = 0.002). Patients with gram-positive coccal bacteremia had a particularly poor outcome: therapy failed for six of eight patients (75%) treated with ciprofloxacin, while therapy failed for none of four patients treated with piperacillin plus amikacin. Death from primary infection during initially randomized protocol therapy occurred in 7 of 48 patients (14.5%) treated with ciprofloxacin and in 3 of 53 (6%) treated with piperacillin plus amikacin. This study does not support the use of this dose of intravenous ciprofloxacin as empiric monotherapy for fever in granulocytopenic patients. 
Myocardial reperfusion injury. Platelet-activating factor stimulates polymorphonuclear leukocyte hydrogen peroxide production during myocardial reperfusion. To study the roles of platelet-activating factor, polymorphonuclear leukocytes, and oxygen free radicals in myocardial reperfusion injury, we subjected 10 sheep to 90 minutes of mid-left anterior descending coronary artery followed by 6 hours of reperfusion. Stainings with gentian violet and tetratriphenyl ammonium chloride demonstrated 20% +/- 3% of the left ventricular mass at risk for ischemia, of which 75% +/- 10% underwent infarction. Coronary sinus blood was assayed for platelet-activating factor and neutrophil hydrogen peroxide production before and during coronary occlusion and during reperfusion. Platelet-activating factor was isolated by column chromatography and lipid extraction and quantified by radioimmunoassay. Neutrophil hydrogen peroxide production was measured by a 2',7'-dichlorofluorescein flow-cytometric assay. Platelet-activating factor was elevated to 899 +/- 210 pg/ml at 15 minutes of reperfusion, compared with the preocclusion level of 271 +/- 55 pg/ml and coronary occlusion level of 359 +/- 64 pg/ml (p less than 0.05; analysis of variance). Neutrophil hydrogen peroxide production, measured on a relative fluorescence scale, was also elevated to a level of 141 +/- 27 at 1 hour of reperfusion, compared with the preocclusion level of 103 +/- 6 and the coronary occlusion level of 114 +/- 13 (p less than 0.01; analysis of variance). Both of these parameters returned toward baselines at the end of 6 hours of reperfusion. Histologic examination revealed infiltration of polymorphonuclear leukocytes into the interstitium of the reperfused myocardium. Neutrophils isolated from unoperated and healthy sheep demonstrated a graded dose response in hydrogen peroxide production when stimulated by purified platelet-activating factor in vitro. These findings suggest that platelet-activating factor is released in the coronary circulation and is a mediator of oxygen free radical production in polymorphonuclear leukocytes during myocardial reperfusion. 
Have general hospitals become chronic care institutions for the mentally ill? OBJECTIVE: Dramatic increases in lengths of stay for general hospital psychiatric patients in New York City in recent years have raised speculation that general hospitals are assuming a large responsibility for care of the chronically mentally ill. This study examines changes in utilization patterns and patient characteristics to assess whether such a trend is occurring. METHOD: The authors obtained discharge abstract data for all New York City general hospital adult psychiatric patients in 1985 and 1988 as well as utilization data from the public general hospital system for 1977-1989. Three measures of chronicity were chosen: hospital stays longer than 60 days, discharges to long-term care, and three or more admissions per year. Data on psychiatric diagnoses and comorbid diagnoses for chronically ill patients were also reviewed. RESULTS: The mean length of stay of psychiatric patients in general hospitals has increased substantially in recent years and nearly tripled in the public hospitals during 1977-1989. Between 1985 and 1988, citywide increases were due largely to a growing proportion of patients with very long stays. Patients with stays longer than 60 days accounted for 35% of all inpatient days in 1988, compared with 27% in 1985. Patients with chronic illness accounted for half of all days in 1988, compared with 38% in 1985. CONCLUSIONS: Although many factors have contributed to these trends, the leading cause has been reimbursement policies favoring short-term inpatient care. Improving accountability for community treatment programs will be the key to redirecting funding priorities and creating more appropriate alternatives for the chronically mentally ill. 
Failure of early electrocardiogram to predict successful thrombolysis. Effect of stunned myocardium? We investigated the value of the modified Selvester QRS score in predicting reperfusion in 74 patients with an acute myocardial infarction who were treated with intravenous streptokinase. Coronary angiography and time to peak creatine kinase level were used to determine the success of thrombolytic therapy. At 6 weeks a significant difference was seen between the QRS score of the patients in whom thrombolysis was successful compared with those in whom there was no reperfusion. There was, however, no difference between the QRS score of these groups of patients at 1 week. The ejection fraction at 1 week was 60% and 51%, respectively. The failure of the early electrocardiogram to predict reperfusion and improved left ventricular function may be a consequence of the stunned myocardium. 
Lack of gastric acid rebound after stopping a successful short-term course of nizatidine in duodenal ulcer patients. To assess whether there is rebound of gastric acidity after a short-term course of H2-receptor antagonists, we performed a 24-h in situ pH monitoring on 17 duodenal ulcer patients before, during, and after completing 4 wks' treatment with nizatidine 300 mg at bedtime (2200 h). Three around-the-clock continuous intragastric pH-metries were carried out the day before beginning treatment, at the end of the nizatidine course, and 67 h after the last dose of the drug was given. Nizatidine produced mean pH values that were significantly higher (p less than 0.001) than those of the pretreatment profile during both the whole 24-h period and the nighttime (2400-0759), and this confirms that it effectively inhibited gastric acidity. Conversely, there was no significant difference between the acidity indexes of pH profiles obtained before dosing and after discontinuing treatment in any of the time intervals considered. Therefore, it appears that a short term course of nizatidine therapy does not cause rebound hyperacidity in duodenal ulcer patients. 
PET measurements of hyperthermia-induced suppression of protein synthesis in tumors in relation to effects on tumor growth. Hyperthermia-induced metabolic changes in tumor tissue have been monitored by PET. Uptake of L-[1-11C]tyrosine in rhabdomyosarcoma tissue of Wag/Rij rats was dose-dependently reduced after local hyperthermia treatment at 42, 45, or 47 degrees C. Tumor blood flow, as measured by PET with 13NH3, appeared to be unchanged. The L-[1-11C]tyrosine uptake data were compared to uptake data of L-[1-14C]tyrosine and with data on the incorporation of L-[1-14C]tyrosine into tumor proteins. After intravenous injection, the 14C data were obtained from dissected tumor tissue. Heat-induced inhibition of the incorporation of L-[1-14C]tyrosine into tumor proteins tallied with the L-[1-11C]tyrosine uptake data. Heat-induced inhibition of amino acid uptake in the tumor correlated well with regression of tumor growth. It is concluded that PET using L-[1-11C]tyrosine is eligible for monitoring the effect of hyperthermia on tumor growth. 
Aortic valve reconstruction in Rubinstein-Taybi-syndrome: the valuable aid of transesophageal echocardiography. A fourteen year old boy with Rubinstein-Taybi-syndrome presented with a severe congenital subvalvular fibrous aortic stenosis with associated aortic regurgitation. Transthoracic echocardiographic imaging and left heart angiography showed a transvalvular peak systolic pressure gradient of 90 mmHg and a regurgitant fraction of 30%. The surgical treatment consisted of resection of the subvalvular fibrous tissue and subsequent aortic valvuloplasty. Intraoperative transesophageal echocardiography revealed a wide systolic opening of the aortic valve and good coaptation of the aortic valve leaflets in diastole. Two-dimensional color-coded and contrast echocardiography were successfully used to confirm a satisfactory reconstruction. Transesophageal echocardiography therefore represents a valuable tool in the assessment of the morphologic and haemodynamic status, especially in rare cases of congenital heart disease in older children. 
Histologic observations and P-glycoprotein expression in gastric and esophageal adenocarcinomas treated with preoperative chemotherapy. To describe histologic changes associated with chemotherapy response, we reviewed biopsy and resection specimens from 52 patients with locally advanced esophageal or gastric adenocarcinoma who were treated with preoperative chemotherapy, followed by resection. P-Glycoprotein expression in the adenocarcinomas was also determined with the use of antibody C219. Significant changes in morphologic appearance of the tumor between prechemotherapy and postchemotherapy samples was noted in 17 tumors (32.7%). The most frequent changes observed in these 17 tumors were a decrease in tumor cellularity and an increase in dense fibrosis in comparison with the prechemotherapy specimen. In signet-ring cell carcinomas, the intracytoplasmic mucin vacuoles were often smaller after chemotherapy, making tumor cells more difficult to identify. Another finding observed in tumors that showed histologic alteration after chemotherapy was the formation of large mucin pools that contained lymphocytes and macrophages. The remaining 35 tumors showed similar histologic features in prechemotherapy and postchemotherapy specimens. P-Glycoprotein was identified in 15 (29.4%) of 51 specimens after chemotherapy. P-Glycoprotein content of the residual tumors did not correlate with stage, degree of differentiation, or clinically determined chemotherapy response. We concluded that chemotherapy-induced changes in morphology were frequent in patients with upper gastrointestinal tract adenocarcinomas treated with preoperative chemotherapy. These changes should be recognized as they may cause difficulties in both gross and histologic evaluation of the extent of tumor in postchemotherapy resection specimens. The response of adenocarcinomas to this chemotherapy protocol does not appear to be linked to P-glycoprotein expression. 
Surgical options in 424 patients with primary breast cancer without systemic metastases. Mastectomy was dictated by medical considerations in about 40% of 424 consecutive patients who had invasive breast cancer with no evidence of systemic metastases. Half of the women considered suitable for local excision of the breast cancer followed by radiotherapy (conservation) elected to have mastectomy, and intraoperative findings dictated mastectomy in about 20% of those electing conservation. Consequently, conservation was accomplished in about one quarter of those treated for breast cancer. Younger rather than older women more frequently expressed the desire for breast conservation. 
The EEG as a monitor of midazolam amnesia: changes in power and topography as a function of amnesic state. In order to identify EEG parameters that might be specific for identifying amnesia during midazolam infusion, we examined changes in the EEG power spectrum associated with a period of amnesia, determined by inability to recall a sequence of numbers and objects presented verbally, after intravenous midazolam 0.07 mg/kg in ten normal volunteers. Measurements were taken at baseline, during infusion immediately before and after the onset of amnesia, immediately at end of infusion, and 0.5 and 1.5 h after infusion. All subjects had onset of amnesia during infusion, were completely amnesic by the end of infusion, partially amnesic 0.5 h after infusion, and had complete recall by 1.5 h after infusion. The EEG beta power increased and alpha power decreased during amnesic periods. The beta 1/alpha power ratio was the parameter most specific for amnesia. From a baseline value of 0.20 +/- 0.05 (standard error of the mean [SEM]), it increased to 0.96 +/- 0.26 at the end of infusion and decreased to 0.61 +/- 0.15 0.5 h after infusion. By 1.5 h after infusion, all EEG parameters had returned to baseline values. Beta power changes associated with midazolam amnesia were most pronounced in the Fz and Cz lead positions, and alpha power changes were most pronounced in the Oz position. We conclude that 1) EEG power values, particularly the beta 1/alpha ratio, can identify periods of amnesia after midazolam infusion; 2) specific EEG changes and the presence of amnesia vary with the probable serum concentration of midazolam; and 3) the characteristic EEG pattern during partial or complete amnesia varies as one moves across the cerebral cortex. 
Prophylactic sclerotherapy in high-risk cirrhotics selected by endoscopic criteria. A multicenter randomized controlled trial. Controlled trials of sclerotherapy for the prevention of the first variceal hemorrhage in cirrhotics have given conflicting results. In the present study, 106 cirrhotics were randomized to sclerotherapy (55 patients) or control group (51 patients). Admission criteria were no history of previous variceal bleeding and the presence of high-risk varices, i.e., a variceal score less than or equal to 0 according to Beppu et al. Sclerotherapy sessions were performed at time zero, 7 days, 30 days, and then monthly until eradication. Follow-up endoscopies were performed at 6-month intervals thereafter. Control patients underwent repeat endoscopy at 6-month intervals. Bleeding episodes were treated by sclerotherapy in both groups, whenever possible. Mean follow-up was 24 months. Analysis of the results was performed by the intention-to-treat method. Variceal bleeding occurred in 19 sclerotherapy patients (34.5%) and in 17 controls (35.4%, P = NS). Overall mortality was 34.5% in sclerotherapy patients and 50% in controls (P = NS). Seven of the 19 sclerotherapy patients (36.8%) and 11 of the 17 controls (64.7%) who bled died of hemorrhage (P less than 0.05, log-linear model). It is concluded that prophylactic sclerotherapy does not reduce the incidence of first variceal bleeding in cirrhotics. However, there seems to be a trend toward a lower bleeding-related mortality in sclerotherapy patients than in controls. 
Surgical treatment of carcinoid heart disease. Right heart failure in patients with carcinoid heart disease is a serious prognostic sign. Consideration and adequate timing of valvular operations seem essential for the postoperative outcome. Without any relation to duration or progression of the metastasizing tumor disease, right heart failure developed and increased rapidly for a period of 12 to 17 months in four patients with classic carcinoid syndrome. Invasive hemodynamic and cardiac ultrasound investigations revealed severe carcinoid heart disease, and medical decompensation treatment gradually failed. Tricuspid and pulmonic valve replacement operations resulted in dramatic improvement in three of the patients, and these patients were still free of cardiac symptoms 10, 12, and 38 months postoperatively. One patient died 5 days postoperatively probably of septicemia. The preoperative and postoperative development of the cardiac disease is evaluated clinically, by cardiac ultrasound and plasma atrial natriuretic peptide concentrations, and related to the tumor disease. Surgical anatomy and operative technique are reported, and the beneficial value of prophylactic treatment of the effects of tumor-released vasoactive substances by a somatostatin analog is emphasized. 
Role of percutaneous nephrostomy in patients with upper urinary tract transitional cell carcinoma. Percutaneous nephrostomy has become a well-established procedure for a wide variety of urologic disorders. However, its role in the management of patients with upper urinary tract transitional cell carcinoma has not been defined. We utilized percutaneous nephrostomy in 23 renal units for the evaluation or treatment of 21 patients in whom standard techniques were inconclusive or inadequate. The percutaneous nephrostomy provided adequate relief of obstruction in the face of significant azotemia or infection. Diagnostic abilities were improved through the use of antegrade pyelography, selective cytologic examination, and, at times, by providing direct access for endoscopic visualization and biopsy. In select cases, the percutaneous access provided a route for definitive or adjunctive treatment of the lesion. Complications were few and seeding of the tract or local tumor spread has not occurred at follow-up ranging from one to one hundred twenty-one (mean 27.8) months. 
Cricothyroid muscle responses to increased chemical drive in awake normal humans. To examine the response of the cricothyroid muscle (CT) to increased chemical drive, we measured its electromyogram simultaneously with that of the alae nasi (AN) in seven normal awake subjects. During both progressive hyperoxic hypercapnia and hypoxia, peak integrated inspiratory activity (moving time average, MTA) of the CT and AN increased as a power function of mean inspiratory flow (ratio of tidal volume to inspiratory time, VT/TI), given by MTA = a(VT/TI)b + c (where a, b, and c are constants). The exponent b varied from 0.009 to 3.4 among subjects but was correlated between CT and AN both during hypercapnia (r = 0.86) and hypoxia (r = 0.81). The onset of inspiratory activity of the CT and AN preceded that of inspiratory flow. Expressed as a percentage of expiratory time, the CT lead time rose from 7% at rest to 20% during hyperpnea. The corresponding values for the AN were from 22 to 52% (both P less than 0.03). Thus the pattern of response of the CT and AN is similar and related to that of the inspiratory muscles in a curvilinear manner. The findings suggest that during chemical stimulation the electrical activity of the CT is analogous to that of the AN, an upper airway dilator. 
The efficacy of fiberoptic endoscopic examination and biopsy in the detection of early nasopharyngeal carcinoma. Fiberoptic endoscopic examination and biopsy of the nasopharynx was done in 130 patients as a prospective study. They all had elevated titers of antibodies against the viral capsid antigen of Epstein-Barr virus but no symptoms or signs of nasopharyngeal carcinoma. Each underwent a biopsy from six fixed sites in the nasopharynx. Of the 780 biopsy specimens taken from seven patients, 11 showed the presence of nasopharyngeal carcinoma. Techniques to improve the yields of such biopsies with fiberoptic endoscopy are discussed. The presence of tumor was unrelated to the macroscopic endoscopic findings. The highest incidence of subclinical tumor is in the pharyngeal recess. 
Special considerations in the physical exam of older patients. For diagnostic utility, aspects of the standard physical examination are modified for elderly patients. Special attention is paid to problems that interfere with function, such as gait disorders, incontinence, and hearing and visual loss. Certain findings in cardiac and pulmonary examinations of the elderly require different interpretations. The examination should include the head and neck, chest, back, abdomen, breasts and pelvic area in women, prostate in men, extremities, and skin, as well as mental status. A number of diagnostic maneuvers are used to distinguish changes of normal aging from those associated with disease. 
Intracranial metastasis from carcinoma of the paranasal sinus. Carcinomas of the paranasal sinuses are locally invasive tumors that only occasionally metastasize. The tumor may spread intracranially by local invasion through the dura into the frontal lobes and extension along the vidian nerve. We describe two cases of cerebellar metastasis in patients with local recurrence and discuss the mechanism of spreading. It is possible that more aggressive treatment of these tumors, which results in longer survival, may be associated with an increased incidence of intracranial metastasis. 
Natural course of clinically localized prostate adenocarcinoma in men less than 70 years old. A total of 61 patients, less than 70 years old at diagnosis, with clinical stage T1-2, NX, M0, cytologically well or moderately differentiated prostate adenocarcinoma was prospectively included in a surveillance study. Median patient age was 63 years (range 38 to 69 years). Mean followup was 96 +/- 24 months. The probability of local progression to stage T3 disease after 5 and 10 years was 49 and 72%, respectively. The probability of metastases developing after 5 and 10 years was 8 and 23%, respectively. The probability of dying of prostate adenocarcinoma was 2 and 8%, respectively. Moderately differentiated cancer progressed locally significantly faster than well differentiated disease. The relative number of patients who had metastases or died of prostate adenocarcinoma found in our study was comparable to the relative numbers reported after radical prostatectomy and radiation therapy. Therefore, deferred therapy may be an alternative to active therapy in patients with clinically localized prostate adenocarcinoma and with a life expectancy of less than 10 years. 
Hepatitis B vaccination programs for health care personnel in U.S. hospitals. A random sample of 232 U.S. hospitals was surveyed. Of those hospitals, 75 percent had hepatitis B vaccination programs. The presence of a program was associated with hospital size (60 percent of those with 100 beds, 75 percent with 100-499 beds, 90 percent with 500 or more beds; P = 0.0013) and hospital location (urban 86 percent; rural 57 percent; P less than 0.001). The frequency of needlestick exposures per month among hospital personnel and hospital location were directly related to and best predicted the existence of hepatitis B vaccination programs. All hospitals with programs offered vaccine to high-risk personnel (as defined by the hospital). Seventy-seven percent of hospitals paid all costs for vaccinating high-risk personnel; 19 percent paid for any employee to be vaccinated regardless of risk status. Forty-six percent of hospitals with programs were estimated to have vaccinated more than 10 percent of all eligible personnel, and 13 percent to have vaccinated more than 25 percent of eligible personnel. The highest compliance rates were associated with hospitals paying for the vaccine and requiring vaccination of high-risk personnel. Fifty-four percent of hospitals attributed noncompliance to concern regarding vaccine safety and effectiveness. The reasons why there was no vaccination program in 58 hospitals were (a) low incidence of hepatitis B virus infections among personnel, (b) cost of vaccine, and (c) vaccination being offered as part of a needlestick protocol. Full utilization of hepatitis B vaccine could eliminate the occupational hazard that hepatitis B virus presents to health care personnel. 
Acute effects of parenteral beta-blockade on regional ventricular function of infarct and noninfarct zones after reperfusion therapy in humans. Although the mechanism is unknown, clinical trials have suggested that intravenous beta-adrenergic blockade may prevent early cardiac rupture after myocardial infarction. Previous studies have examined effects of beta-blockers on global left ventricular function after myocardial infarction; however, few data exist regarding their immediate effects on regional function or in patients after successful reperfusion. Therefore, 65 patients in whom thrombolysis with or without coronary angioplasty achieved reperfusion at 4.6 +/- 1.7 h from symptom onset were studied. Low osmolarity contrast ventriculograms were obtained immediately before and after administration of 15 mg of intravenous metoprolol (n = 54) or placebo (n = 11). Intravenous metoprolol immediately decreased heart rate (from 92 to 76 beats/min, p less than 0.0001), increased left ventricular diastolic volume (from 150 to 163 ml, p less than 0.001) and systolic volume (from 72 to 77 ml, p less than 0.0005) but did not change systolic and diastolic pressures. Although there was no difference in ejection fraction after metoprolol, centerline chord analysis revealed reduced noninfarct zone motion (from 0.41 to 0.12 SD/chord, p less than 0.05), improved infarct zone motion (from -3.1 to -2.9 SD/chord, p less than 0.01) and smaller circumferential extent of hypokinesia (from 30 to 27 chords, p less than 0.05). Patients with dyskinesia of the infarct zone had the most striking improvement in infarct zone wall motion. Because these changes occurred immediately after beta-blockade, they could not be attributed to myocardial salvage. No significant changes in heart rate, left ventricular volumes or regional wall motion were apparent in the control group. 
The significance of venous return impairment in ischemic radiculopathy and myelopathy. Because much of the symptomatology consequent to the constrictive lesions of spinal degenerations may be the result of radicular neurischemia, medullary neurischemia, or both, the structure and responses of the nerve root vasculature to compression or tension are discussed. Although the original investigations concentrated on the arterial side of the radiculomedullary circulation, more recent research has indicated that the venous return phase is far more susceptible to the effects of both intraspinal and extraspinal pathologic conditions. 
Prognostic factors in the conservative treatment of ureteric stones. A prospective study was made of 125 ureteric stones in order to detect factors which would predict the successful outcome of conservative treatment. The factors studied were the duration of pain prior to presentation, pyuria, haematuria, surface regularity of the stone and the degree of obstruction as seen radiologically. In stones less than or equal to 10 mm in size, conservative treatment was successful when the duration of pain was less than 30 days (39/45), when there was no significant pyuria (53/82), when the stones had an irregular surface (44/65) and when obstruction was only partial (55/88). Since most of these factors were interactive, further statistical analysis showed that duration of pain was the only significant factor in predicting the outcome of conservative treatment. In stones greater than 10 mm in size these factors had no predictive value and only 2/23 were passed spontaneously on conservative treatment. 
Excess mortality among 3302 patients with 'pure' anxiety neurosis. The survival probability and causes of death before the age of 70 years were analyzed among 3302 inpatients with "pure" anxiety neurosis in Stockholm County, Sweden, who were tracked in case registries by means of automated record linkage during a 14-year period. When all patients with other psychiatric diagnoses and substance abuse were excluded, and marital status controlled for, there was a significant excess of deaths due to verified and undetermined suicides, ie, nearly one third of all deaths. These unnatural deaths preempted any excess in natural causes before the age of 70 years, such as cardiovascular disease. Treatment policy with regard to the use of anxiolytic drugs was not found to influence mortality. We concluded that the risk of suicide in inpatients before the age of 70 years with anxiety disorders may be as high as that in persons with depression or other diagnoses who require inpatient care. 
Correlations between histopathological and biological findings in nasopharyngeal carcinoma and its prognostic significance. Forty-five consecutive cases of nasopharyngeal carcinoma were morphologically and immunocytochemically studied using monoclonal (anti-B and anti-T cell) and polyclonal (anti-S100 protein and antilysozyme) antibodies with the peroxidase-anti-peroxidase method to identify infiltrating lymphocytes (T and B cell) and histiocytes (monocytic/macrophagic and dendritic cells) in nasopharyngeal carcinoma. A variable density of dendritic cells was found within the tumor nests in 22 (49%) of 45 nasopharyngeal carcinomas examined; infiltrating macrophages were demonstrated in 15 (33%) specimens and around the tumor in almost all cases. Cases with moderate or marked density of dendritic cells (S100+) survived longer than those without such infiltration (mean 5-year survival rates of 31%, 55%, or 64% in patients with absent, moderate, or marked densities, respectively; P less than 0.05). A significant relationship between monocytic/macrophagic cells (lysozyme+) within the tumor and survival was also found (mean 5-year survival rate of 27% or 61% in patients with absent, moderate, or marked densities, respectively). However, lymphocytic infiltration was not statistically related to a better survival. Analyzing lymphocytic infiltration, we found a large prevalence of T cells in the neoplastic tissue without any prognostic significance. These data were correlated to different histological subtypes according to the principal histological classifications of nasopharyngeal carcinomas (Micheau, et al.; World Health Organization; Cologne University) to individualize the scheme which correlates best with prognosis and biological features of nasopharyngeal carcinomas. Our data suggest that, considering dendritic cells and macrophages within cancer nests, nasopharyngeal carcinoma histiotypes can be correlated to patient prognosis. 
Transureteroureterostomy and terminal loop cutaneous ureterostomy in advanced pelvic malignancies. Transureteroureterostomy was combined with terminal loop cutaneous ureterostomy, without complications, in 8 patients with advanced pelvic malignancy and a poor prognosis. Urinary diversion was palliative in all patients and followed pelvic exenteration in 4, debulking of pelvic tumor in 2 and radical cystectomy in 1, while 1 had inoperable bladder cancer. All patients had at least unilateral hydroureteronephrosis preoperatively. In each case a postoperative excretory urogram revealed significant improvement of the hydroureteronephrosis and the serum creatinine improved or stabilized. No patient had ureteral stomal stenosis or retraction. Mean survival was 5 months, with the longest survival being 1 year. Transureteroureterostomy in conjunction with terminal loop cutaneous ureterostomy is an effective technique of urinary diversion in selected patients with a poor prognosis and advanced pelvic malignancy, decreasing operative time while avoiding the morbidity associated with a ureterointestinal operation or nephrostomy. 
Quantitation of axon loss and conduction block in peroneal nerve palsies. We compared conduction in motor fibers supplying the extensor digitorum brevis (EDB) and anterior lateral compartment (AL) muscles. The object was to determine whether there were any differences in the relative proportions of degenerated and blocked nerve fibers between the longer EDB and shorter AL fibers. In almost every case the percentage of motor fibers undergoing axonal degeneration was greatest in EDB fibers. Conversely, the percentage of conduction block was greatest in the AL motor fibers. As clinical recovery is dependent on AL muscles rather than EDB, electrophysiological study of the relative proportions of degenerated and blocked fibers in the former should provide a more reliable measure of outcome than similar studies of EDB. Conduction velocity distal to the fibular head was not slowed despite the large loss of EDB motor fibers. Evidence for selective involvement of the larger myelinated fibers is, therefore, lacking. The location of the major conduction abnormalities was in almost every case between the mid-fibular head and popliteal fossa. 
Fourier analysis of the cerebrovascular system. We performed Fourier analysis of the middle cerebral artery blood flow velocity waveform envelope in 14 normal subjects (group A) and 15 patients, of whom five had arteriovenous malformations (group B), five had cerebral vasospasm (group C), and five had arterial hypertension (group D). Measurements were obtained under conditions of normocapnia, hypercapnia, and hypocapnia. The Fourier coefficients measured in the first five harmonics of the Doppler waveforms of group A were used as the reference baseline and were compared with the coefficients found in the other three groups. Group B showed significantly lower Fourier coefficients, while groups C and D showed higher coefficients (p less than 0.05). The elevation of the Fourier coefficients occurred in an alternating pattern in group C and a decremental pattern in group D. This distinction was attributed to possible differences in the underlying pathophysiological processes. The degree of vascular distensibility of the cerebral arterioles, inferred from the shape of the Fourier analysis curves, was compared in all four groups. Vascular distensibility was characterized as abnormal in arteriovenous malformations, vasospasm, and arterial hypertension. Fourier coefficients may be better indicators of cerebrovascular abnormalities than mean blood flow velocity in hypertension and pulsatility index in arteriovenous malformations, vasospasm, and hypertension. 
Mouse bronchiolar cell carcinogenesis. Histologic characterization and expression of Clara cell antigen in lesions induced by N-nitrosobis-(2-chloroethyl) ureas. Female Swiss mice (Cr:NIH(S)) developed bronchiolar cell hyperplasia, dysplasia, metaplasia, and various morphologic types of bronchiolar cell tumors after topical (skin) application of N-nitroso-methyl-bis-chloroethylurea (NMBCU) or N-nitroso-tris-chloroethylurea (NTCU). These compounds are the first found to induce systemically bronchiolar cell tumors in mice in high incidence. Twice a week, with a 3-day interval, a 25-microliter drop of 0.04 mol/l (molar) NMBCU or NTCU in acetone was applied to the shaved interscapular integument for a maximum of 35 to 40 weeks. The earliest lung neoplasms were seen in mice that died after 23 weeks of treatment and affected 11 of 19 with NMBCU and 14 of 19 with NTCU treatment. Tumor growth pattern was nodular or the neoplastic tissue was frequently disseminated throughout the parenchyma, starting from multicentric peribronchiolar foci. The most common tumor types were squamous cell carcinomas and adenosquamous carcinomas, followed by adenocarcinomas with or without secretory cells, and a single ciliated-cell tumor. Histochemical and immunohistochemical studies were carried out on paraffin-embedded lungs using the avidin-biotin immunoperoxidase complex procedure and antisera against keratin, Clara cell antigen, surfactant apoprotein, neuron-specific enolase, bombesin, and chromogranin A. In several mice from both groups, hyperplasias and tumors were composed of cells expressing Clara cell antigen. No tumor cells were found expressing alveolar type II or neuroendocrine cell markers. It appeared that bronchiolar cells, in particular Clara cells, had migrated from terminal bronchioles or invaded bronchiolar walls to extend into the alveolar parenchyma. Squamous cell metaplasia with keratin expression was seen within airways or associated with glandular tumors, especially at the periphery. A unique cell type, with large eosinophilic globules and associated eosinophilic crystals, was seen lining airways or forming hyperplastic and neoplastic lesions. N-nitroso-methyl-bis-chloroethylurea- and NTCU-induced mouse bronchiolar cell alterations could be an interesting new model to study mechanisms of bronchiolar cell differentiation and tumor formation. 
Posterior spinal fusion in Sotos' syndrome. Sotos' syndrome (synonym: cerebral gigantism) is the association of mental retardation, macrocephaly and prenatal onset of accelerated growth. The rapid skeletal growth may account for a 4% incidence of scoliosis. General anaesthesia using halothane or enflurane in nitrous oxide and oxygen, with opioid supplementation and labetalol to induce moderate hypotension, appeared to be a satisfactory technique for corrective spinal surgery. The potential problems are discussed, with mental retardation and sometimes aggressive behaviour contraindicating a "wake-up" test. Extradural somatosensory evoked potential monitoring is a satisfactory alternative. Hook failures seem more likely than in patients undergoing surgery for adolescent idiopathic scoliosis. 
Liver damage in long-term anticonvulsant therapy: a serological and histological study. The prevalence of liver damage in patients receiving long-term anticonvulsant therapy was determined, using a new marker of liver disease, the serum F protein concentration. Abnormal serum F protein concentrations were detected in 50 per cent of 34 patients receiving anticonvulsant therapy. A retrospective analysis of post-mortem liver samples showed common histological abnormalities in three out of seven patients who had died whilst receiving anticonvulsant therapy. These changes were not seen in control patients. We suggest that chronic anticonvulsant therapy may cause significant hepatocellular damage. 
Factors relevant to preventing embolic stroke in patients with non-rheumatic atrial fibrillation. Whether or not to treat patients with non-rheumatic atrial fibrillation with anticoagulants to prevent embolic stroke is a dilemma for physicians. If randomized trials, currently underway, demonstrate a beneficial effect, the dilemma will not be solved because not all of the relevant factors can be addressed by trials. We used current knowledge about non-rheumatic atrial fibrillation and a method of obtaining patient-derived weights for avoiding stroke from eight medically trained subjects, to determine the overall benefit of anticoagulants and to see what factors were relevant and what effect each might have in deciding whether to use anticoagulant therapy. Using standard assumptions, anticoagulants gave an expected benefit for all subjects. The expected benefit (expressed in terms of lives per 1000 saved due to anticoagulants) varied between 5.4 and 46.7. This benefit remained for all subjects when we did a sensitivity analysis for different rates of stroke prevented by anticoagulants and different rates of intracranial hemorrhage caused by anticoagulants. When we used different baseline rates of stroke and different impacts of major hemorrhagic complications the benefit disappeared for 3 and 4 subjects respectively. We found the factors that were most crucial to the decision will not be included in randomized trials; the weight that an individual would place on avoiding embolic stroke vs the risk of intracranial bleeding from anticoagulant therapy; and the rate of embolic stroke that could be expected for the subject at risk. Factors which will be measured in randomized trials, will change results less substantially: the increased risk of major hemorrhages; the proportion of strokes that could be prevented by treatment; the increase in risk of intracranial hemorrhage. This method of analysis suggests that for most patients anticoagulants are beneficial and that the most important factor in determining this result is the value that subjects put on different outcomes. 
Clinical significance of the expression of epidermal growth factor and its receptor in esophageal cancer. The epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) level in 56 esophageal cancer tissues was measured by 125I-EGF binding assay to elucidate its role in tumor progression. The survival rate of patients with high EGFR level (more than 50 fmol/mg protein) was significantly lower than that of patients with low EGFR level (less than 50 fmol/mg protein, P less than 0.01), although a correlation between EGFR level and the pathologic findings was not observed. The expression of EGF was examined immunohistochemically using anti-EGF monoclonal antibody in 100 esophageal cancer tissues; EGF-positive tumor cells were detected in 92.0%. The immunoreactivity of EGF was classified arbitrarily into four grades according to the number of stained tumor cells. The expression of EGF significantly correlated with the differentiation of esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (P less than 0.01, by chi-square test). The survival rate of patients with high EGF immunoreactivity (Grade 2 or 3) was much lower than in those with lower grade (0 or 1) tumors, (P less than 0.01). Patients with both high EGFR level and EGF immunoreactivity had a much worse prognosis than if both were low. Furthermore, the mitotic index was higher in groups with both high EGFR and EGF than if both were low (16.39 +/- 5.35 versus 6.90 +/- 3.31). These results suggest that EGF and EGFR in the autocrine system may play an important role in tumor progression in esophageal cancer and their expression could be of prognostic significance. 
Review of state-of-the-art beta-blocker therapy. Beta-adrenoceptor blocking drugs have been used in the treatment of hypertension for more than 2 decades. During this time they have reached the position of first-line therapy for hypertension and are recommended as such by the Joint National Committee (U.S.A.) in 1988 and by the World Health Organization/International Society of Hypertension in 1983 and 1989. This is because of the favorable relationship between the antihypertensive efficacy of these drugs and the rate and severity of their adverse effects. Of particular interest is the possibility that beta blockers may protect against coronary artery disease (CAD). With regard to secondary prevention against CAD, statistically highly significant and clinically relevant reductions of mortality and the risk of reinfarction have been shown in prospective, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials. A primary preventive effect against CAD, on the other hand, has only been shown in open trials without placebo control. However, in spite of the lack of clear proof, this effect still appears to be a logical possibility. Some new findings with beta blockers appear to be of particular interest: beta blockade may reduce myocardial necrosis in patients with marked elevations of plasma catecholamines due to traumatic head injury; a similar protective effect in other situations of severe stress, e.g., acute myocardial infarction, would be of great clinical value. Experimental studies also suggest that beta blockers may have antiatherosclerotic effect in animals fed an atherogenic diet and subjected to stress. Again, clinical confirmation of such results would be of great significance. 
Helicobacter pylori gastritis mimicking gastric carcinoma at CT evaluation. The abdominal computed tomographic (CT) scans from 61 patients with biopsy-proved Helicobacter (formerly Campylobacter) pylori gastritis were retrospectively reviewed. The CT scans were interpreted on the basis of the original report of the findings at CT examination and without knowledge of the results of biopsy. Of 19 patients (31%) with gastric abnormalities at CT, 14 (74%) had inflammatory changes initially reported as suspicious for gastric malignancy; malignancy was entertained as the primary diagnosis in four of those patients. In five of the 19 abnormal cases (26%), the diagnosis with CT was gastritis. The two major patterns of severe H pylori infection identified were (a) circumferential antral wall thickening and (b) thickening of the posterior gastric wall along the greater curvature, with or without evidence of ulceration. Thickening averaged 1.5-2.0 cm in cases suspicious for malignancy. The majority of abnormalities involved the gastric antrum (68%). No cases demonstrated significant adenopathy, obliteration of fat planes, or invasion of adjacent organs. 
Chronic reactive airway disease following acute chlorine gas exposure in an asymptomatic atopic patient. While chlorine gas inhalation has previously been reported to cause temporary mucous membrane irritation, acute pneumonitis, pulmonary edema, and transient bronchospasm, there is controversy about the existence of long-term pulmonary sequelae. We report the case of a 25-year-old man in whom chronic, recurrent asthma developed after exposure to a chlorine gas leak in an enclosed space. His course since the exposure has been notable for frequent exacerbations necessitating chronic corticosteroid therapy and multiple hospitalizations. To our knowledge, the persistence of symptoms years after the exposure is unique in the literature. 
Evidence for altered Na+/H+ antiport activity in cultured skeletal muscle cells and vascular smooth muscle cells from the spontaneously hypertensive rat. 1. Intracellular pH and Na+/H+ antiport activity were determined by a fluorimetric method in cultured skeletal muscle cells (myoblasts) and aortic vascular smooth muscle cells from spontaneously hypertensive and normotensive Wistar-Kyoto rats. 2. The intracellular pH was significantly more alkaline at three different extracellular pH values in both myoblasts and vascular smooth muscle cells from the spontaneously hypertensive rats than in those from the normotensive control rats. 3. A kinetic analysis of the Na+/H+ antiport activity in these cells showed that the raised activity in the spontaneously hypertensive rats was due to an increased maximal transport capacity in vascular smooth muscle cells and to an increase in the affinity of the antiport for internal H+ in the myoblasts. 4. When the extracellular pH was reduced in the skeletal muscle cells of both types of rat, the intracellular pH fell. However, in vascular smooth muscle cells, a reduction in the extracellular pH was not associated with a fall in the intracellular pH. This resistance of the intracellular pH to changes in the extracellular pH differentiates vascular smooth muscle cells from other cells that have been studied in this way. 
Relationship between proteolytic enzymes and atherosclerosis in aortic aneurysms. Aortic elastase and aortic collagenase were assayed in 38 patients who underwent an operation for thoracic or infrarenal aneurysm or infrarenal aortic occlusive disease and in 15 control patients (heart or kidney donors). Elastase was elevated in normal aortas of the infrarenal region (1.10 milliunits per gram, p less than 0.05), and in atherosclerotic descendens aneurysms (1.24 milliunits per gram, p less than 0.05), compared with the ascending aorta, when normal; aneurysmatic specimens revealed similar low elastolytic activities (0.10 milliunits per gram). The highest elastase content was found in infrarenal aneurysms (4.65 milliunits per gram). Collagenase assays yielded no significant differences, although higher activities were extracted from aortas of the infrarenal region. Coexistent atherosclerosis and wall destruction were evaluated by macroscopic and histologic investigation. All infrarenal specimens demonstrated severe atherosclerotic wall degeneration with depletion of elastic fibers. As the atherosclerotic specimens did not differ from normal aortas by protease assay, the higher elastase of infrarenal samples compared with the thoracic aorta suggests a more rapid fiber metabolism in the infrarenal region. The significantly elevated elastolytic activity of infrarenal aneurysms points to the decisive role of elastase in infrarenal aneurysm formation. 
Pregnancy complicated by antiphospholipid antibodies. The manifestations of antiphospholipid antibodies in pregnancy are multiple and include maternal arterial and venous thrombosis, spontaneous abortion, intrauterine fetal death, intrauterine growth retardation, and preeclampsia. Maternal complications may also arise in the puerperium with the development of an autoimmune pleuropulmonary postpartum syndrome. Currently, there is confusion in the literature regarding appropriate treatment of patients known to possess these antibodies. We have reported the case of a patient at 29 weeks' gestation who had elevated blood pressure, proteinuria, and early intrauterine growth retardation. Studies were positive for the presence of both lupus anticoagulant and anticardiolipin antibodies. After delivery, chest pain and a pleural effusion developed as further manifestations of the patient's autoimmune disease. 
The mast cell in health and disease. The presence of mast cells, often in an activated state or increased numbers, has been noted in various cutaneous disorders. Recent studies suggest that mast cells are of primary importance in these conditions and their presence does not merely represent a secondary event. This review focuses on atopic dermatitis, contact hypersensitivity reactions, bullous pemphigoid, fibrosing conditions, neurofibromatosis, wound healing, polycythemia vera, and psoriasis, in which there is significant evidence to indicate a pathophysiologic role for mast cells. 
Herniated cervical disk presenting as ischemic chest pain. Myocardial ischemia must be the first concern of every emergency physician in evaluating chest pain in the adult patient. Any suspicion of myocardial ischemia must be promptly evaluated and admitted. The American College of Emergency Physicians has recently published a standards document on the care of chest pain in the adult patient. The emergency physician must be familiar with this document. Once myocardial ischemia and other life-threatening causes are ruled out, one can consider that cervical disk disease may be the cause of chest pain. The authors present two cases of patients who presented to the Emergency Department with signs and symptoms consistent with cardiac ischemia. Both patients were found to have herniated cervical disks. Subsequent surgical repair completely relieved their symptoms. Evaluation of the literature reveals that this entity was well described from 1950 to the 1960s. Most recent discussions do not mention disk herniation as even an infrequent cause of chest pain. If there is no life-threatening disease present, one should consider cervical disk disease. 
Differential effect of compression-ischaemia block on warm sensation and heat-induced pain. The effect of compression-ischaemia nerve block on psychophysical thresholds for warm sensation and heat-induced pain was studied on 19 normal human volunteers. Although those two sensory submodalities should be predicted to block simultaneously, based on the fact that both are served by unmyelinated primary afferents, it was actually found that warm sensation was much more vulnerable to compression-ischaemia than heat-induced pain. This is interpreted as resulting from different summation requirements for each of the two sensory modalities; sensation of warmth depends on spatial summation to a larger extent than heat-induced pain. Such differential vulnerability is in line with recent clinical studies reporting deterioration of warm sensation associated with preservation of heat pain in peripheral nerve disorders caused by diabetes, ageing and other neuropathic processes. 
The potential use of a dopamine neuron antibody and a striatal-derived neurotrophic factor as diagnostic markers in Parkinson's disease. The cerebral spinal fluid (CSF) of patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) contains an antibody that immunocytochemically reacts with dopamine (DA) neurons in the substantia nigra (SN). This antibody was found in 78% of the CSF samples taken from patients with clinical PD. In contrast, only 3% of the CSF samples taken from control patients or patients with neurologic symptoms other than PD possessed this antibody. The production of this antibody might contribute to disease progression but does not appear to be the etiologic factor responsible for PD. In other experiments, concentrates of the CSF of patients with PD enhanced growth of mesencephalic cultures relative to control CSF. Both the antibody and the growth-promoting activity found in CSF are associated with degeneration of the SN and might therefore be useful as potential diagnostic markers for PD. 
Diaphragmatic performance during recovery from acute ventilatory failure in Guillain-Barre syndrome and myasthenia gravis. Diaphragmatic muscle performance during acute ventilatory failure due to Guillain-Barre syndrome and myasthenia gravis was assessed to evaluate (1) diaphragmatic function during weaning from ventilatory support and (2) diaphragmatic tension-time integral (TTdi) during ventilatory failure. We used a multilumen nasogastric tube and a pneumotachograph to measure transdiaphragmatic pressure per breath (Pdi), maximum transdiaphragmatic pressure (Pdimax), tidal volume (VT), and inspiratory time fraction during 74 spontaneous breathing trials in nine patients. Diaphragmatic performance was poor in all patients. The Pdi, Pdimax, and VT improved significantly, but values for Pdi and Pdimax remained low even after weaning. Improvement in Pdimax was the best predictor of recovery (r = 0.48; p less than 0.001). Maximal inspiratory force correlated with Pdimax (r = 0.48; p less than 0.005), but FVC did not. The TTdi rarely exceeded the expected fatigue threshold of 0.15 in spite of the patient's inability to sustain ventilation. Although our patients demonstrated diaphragmatic weakness, TTdi did not demonstrate diaphragmatic fatigue. 
Inhibitor of interleukin-1 alpha and interleukin-1 beta-induced T-cell activation in serum of patients with active Crohn's disease. Interleukin-1 is a family of polypeptides with a wide spectrum of immunoinflammatory activities pertinent to Crohn's disease, including T-cell activation. Using specific enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays, only sera from two of 19 patients (11%) with active Crohn's disease contained interleukin-1 alpha and interleukin-1 beta activity. Using the thymocyte proliferation assay, sera from the same patients contained significantly increased inhibitory activity against interleukin-1 alpha (P = 0.025) and interleukin-1 beta-induced cell activation (P = 0.00005) as compared with controls. Changes in both interleukin-1 alpha (P = 0.020) and interleukin-1 beta (P = 0.012) inhibitor concentrations correlated significantly with changes in clinical disease activity. None of the patient sera contained IgG or IgM autoantibodies to IL-1 alpha, nor did they exert significant inhibitory activity against interleukin 1 beta in the fibroblast prostaglandin E2-induction assay. Taken together, these data provide evidence for the presence of one or several regulators of interleukin-1-induced T-cell activation in sera from patients with active Crohn's disease. 
Osteomyelitis. The Ilizarov perspective. It is evident that Professor Ilizarov has devised some remarkable strategies for dealing with chronic osteomyelitis. In summary, his methods include: Extensive debridement and intercalary bone transport. Oblique osteotomy through multiloculated cavitary osteomyelitis in intact bone. Elimination of large cavities by gradual displacement of one cortical wall. The role that these techniques will play in the future of osteomyelitis surgery remains to be determined by careful clinical and experimental research. 
Surgical management of retinal detachment associated with the acute retinal necrosis syndrome. We operated on nine eyes in eight patients with retinal detachment associated with acute retinal necrosis (ARN) syndrome. The patients were treated with scleral buckling, vitreoretinal surgery, or a combination of these treatments. Vitrectomised eyes underwent combinations of lensectomy, membrane dissection, scleral buckling, air-fluid exchange, endolaser photocoagulation, cryotherapy, and retinal tamponade with C3F8 gas or SF6 gas. Macular attachment was achieved in eight (89%) eyes. Vision improved in seven (78%) eyes, of which five (56%) achieved 20/200 or better vision. Three eyes that had received laser treatment posterior to areas of retinitis suffered retinal detachment despite this prophylactic treatment. Poor visual outcome resulted from viral infection of the optic nerve or macular involvement, macular hole formation, macular pucker, or hypotony. 
Comparison of different doses of epinephrine on myocardial perfusion and resuscitation success during cardiopulmonary resuscitation in a pig model. Published results of dose-response effects of adrenergic drugs (epinephrine [E]) vary so much between studies because of differences in animal models and duration of ischemia before drug administration. In this investigation the effects of different doses of E on coronary perfusion pressure (CPP), left ventricular myocardial blood flow (MBF) and resuscitation success were compared during closed-chest cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) after a 4-minute period of ventricular fibrillation in 28 pigs. MBF was measured during normal sinus rhythm using tracer microspheres. After 4 minutes of ventricular fibrillation CPR was performed with the use of a pneumatic piston compressor. After 4 minutes of mechanical measures only, the animals were randomly allocated into four groups of seven, receiving 0.015, 0.030, 0.045, and 0.090 mg/kg E intravenously respectively. MBF measurements were started 45 seconds after E administration; hemodynamic measurements after 90 seconds. Four minutes after the first administration, the same E dose was given before defibrillation. The CPP of animals given 0.015, 0.030, 0.045 and 0.090 mg/kg E were as follows: 16.3 +/- 6.1, 25.6 +/- 5.8, 33.2 +/- 8.4 and 30.4 +/- 6.3 mm Hg. The left ventricular MBF values were: 14 +/- 9, 27 +/- 11, 43 +/- 6, 46 +/- 10 mL/min/100 g. The differences between the groups receiving 0.015 and 0.045 mg/kg and between the groups receiving 0.015 mg/kg and 0.090 mg/kg were statistically significant (P less than .05). Resuscitation success was 14.3%, 42.9%, 100% and 86.7% respectively. A significant difference in resuscitation success was found only between 0.015 mg/kg and 0.045 mg/kg E. 
Blade atrial septostomy: experience with the first 50 procedures. We have performed 50 blade and balloon atrial septostomies in 46 patients with diagnoses of transposition of the great arteries--32 patients; mitral atresia or stenosis--10 patients; total anomalous pulmonary venous drainage--2 patients; tricuspid atresia--1 patient; and pulmonary valve atresia with hypoplastic right ventricle--1 patient. The patients' age ranged from 1 day to 72 months (median = 8 months) and weights ranged from 2.7 to 14.5 kg. In patients with transposition the systemic saturation increased from an average of 62% to 74.6% (p less than 0.001) and the inter-atrial mean pressure gradient was reduced from 7.74 +/- 5.3 to 1.4 +/- 2.04 mm Hg. Patients with mitral atresia had no significant increase in systemic arterial saturation but a significant decrease in the mean inter-atrial gradient from 19.6 +/- 12.4 to 3.8 +/- 5.3 mm Hg. In three patients the blade septostomy was unsuccessful for technical reasons and the condition of the patient. Complications included one death due to atrial laceration, blood loss requiring transfusion in 5 patients, transient CVA in one patient, and failure of the blade to close in one patient. We have found the palliative use of the blade catheter in conjunction with balloon atrial septostomy to be an effective and safe procedure. 
Peripheral (extraosseous) calcifying odontogenic cyst. A review of forty-five cases. The peripheral calcifying odontogenic cyst (PCOC) is a rare lesion. The number of well-documented cases reported in the English-language literature until now is 38. The purpose of the present study is twofold: (1) to report seven new cases of PCOC and (2) to review and analyze the clinical and histomorphologic features of the previously reported cases of PCOC together with those of the present study. Most of the lesions were located in the maxillary and mandibular gingiva or alveolar mucosa anterior to the region of the first molar. Histologically, 66% of the lesions were of the cystic variant and 34% of the solid (neoplastic) variant. The terminology of the lesion and its histogenesis are discussed. 
Blood pressure and high blood pressure. Aspects of risk. This report deals with three aspects of risk related to blood pressure and high blood pressure. The first aspect of risk concerns distributions of systolic blood pressure (SBP) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP) in the adult population and their relation to long-term risk of morbidity and mortality. By middle age, only a minority (about 20%) of Americans have optimal SBP and DBP levels, less than 120 mm Hg and less than 80 mm Hg, respectively. For the majority with higher levels, risks of major clinical events, including death from cardiovascular diseases and from all causes, are markedly increased. The relations of SBP and DBP with risk are strong, continuous, and graded. Risk is sizable not only for persons with high blood pressure by usual clinical criteria (SBP greater than or equal to 140 mm Hg or DBP greater than or equal to 90 mm Hg), but also for those with "high-normal" blood pressure (e.g., SBP 130-139 mm Hg or DBP 80-89 mm Hg). Thus, the blood pressure problem is a population-wide one and requires for its control a combined population-wide and high-risk strategy. A major component of this strategy must be nutritional-hygienic measures for the primary prevention of the rise in blood pressure during adulthood and of high blood pressure (i.e., primary prevention not only of the complications of high blood pressure but also of high blood pressure itself) through improved lifestyles having the potential to shift downward the blood pressure distribution of the whole population. The second aspect of risk concerns the known risk factors (i.e., aspects of modern lifestyle) leading to the mass occurrence of blood pressure rise during adulthood and of high blood pressure. These risk factors are high salt intake, high dietary sodium/potassium ratio, calorie imbalance and resultant obesity, and high alcohol intake. The extensive data base establishing the role of these common traits in the etiology of the blood pressure/high blood pressure problem is the scientific foundation for efforts to achieve the primary prevention of high blood pressure. The third aspect of risk relates to the combined impact of other risk factors along with blood pressure-high blood pressure in markedly increasing the probabilities of morbidity and mortality (e.g., "rich" diet, diet-dependent serum cholesterol and uric acid, smoking, diabetes, and target-organ damage). Prevention and control of lifestyle-related traits are essential components of the strategy for dealing with the blood pressure-high blood pressure problem. 
A model of prostatic carcinoma tumor kinetics based on prostate specific antigen levels after radiation therapy. Serial prostatic specific antigen values (PSA) were determined on 42 patients receiving definitive radiation therapy for localized adenocarcinoma of the prostate. The PSA declined exponentially in 25 patients. None of these patients experienced metastases. The PSA initially declined then increased exponentially in 17 patients. The rate of decline was similar to the rate of rise in all 17 patients. Five of these patients had distant metastases (P less than 0.02) within 2 years of treatment. The PSA values after radiation therapy were employed to formulate a model of tumor kinetics. This model predicts the mean duration of G0. This parameter is correlated with the development of distant metastases within 2 years of treatment. For those patients at low risk for relapse, the mean G0 is calculated to be 22.5, and 13.6 weeks for those who have relapsed or are at high risk for relapse. 
Hepatitis B virus infection in patients with idiopathic liver disease. We studied 67 HBsAg-negative Israeli patients (36 negative for all HBV serological markers as group 1 and 31 positive for antibodies to HBs and HBc as group 2) with chronic liver disease and cirrhosis of unknown origin using a rapid, sensitive and specific assay for the detection of low levels of hepatitis B virus in serum. This technique uses a high-affinity monoclonal antibody to HBs against an a domain epitope of HBsAg to capture the virion, followed by hepatitis B virus DNA amplification with the polymerase chain reaction. In addition, 55 subjects without liver disease served as controls: Group 3 (n = 32) was negative for all hepatitis B virus markers; group 4 (n = 23) was positive for antibodies to HBs and HBc. We found 11 individuals in group 1 (31%) and 10 in group 2 (29%) harboring low levels of hepatitis B virus DNA in serum. In contrast, no one in group 3 or group 4 was positive by this technique (p less than 0.0001). Using polymerase chain reaction primers spanning other regions of the hepatitis B virus genome and a method of restriction-fragment analysis of polymerase chain reaction-amplified sequences, we detected significant DNA sequence heterogeneity, suggesting infection with distinct hepatitis B virus strains. DNA extracted from paraffin-embedded liver biopsy specimens of 42 patients from groups 1 and 2 was shown to contain hepatitis B virus DNA by polymerase chain reaction in 11 of 12 patients with circulating virion DNA. More important, 18 additional patients whose sera were negative by HBs-antibody capture/polymerase chain reaction amplification had hepatitis B virus DNA sequences in their livers. 
Discrepancy of cervical cytology and colposcopic biopsy: is cervical conization necessary? The purpose of this study was to determine whether diagnostic cervical conization is necessary in the patient with a discrepancy between the Papanicolaou smear and the colposcopically directed biopsy(s). Patients eligible for the study had at least a two-degree discrepancy, eg, CIN III cytology and CIN I or less on colposcopic biopsies, or CIN II cytology with biopsies showing no dysplasia. Of the 786 records reviewed, 87 (11.1%) had such a discrepancy. Twelve of 87 patients (13.8%) were pregnant and ten of 87 (11.5%) failed to return after their initial colposcopic evaluation, leaving 65 patients in the study group. Of these, 20 of 65 (30.8%) were treated medically, nine (13.8%) had cryotherapy, and 36 (55.4%) underwent diagnostic cervical conization. Of patients undergoing cervical conization, three had microinvasive carcinoma of the cervix. Following medical therapy, only two of 20 patients (10%) had negative cytology, two (10%) had CIN I, five (25%) received additional therapy, and 11 (55%) were lost to follow-up. Seven patients did not return for follow-up Papanicolaou smear after medical treatment, and four did not return after their initial posttreatment Papanicolaou smear revealed persistent dysplasia. Of the nine patients treated with cryotherapy, six (66.7%) had a negative Papanicolaou smear at the time of their initial follow-up. The results of this study emphasize the importance of proceeding with diagnostic or therapeutic conization if a two-stage or greater discrepancy exists between the colposcopically directed biopsies and the cervical cytology. The risk of not diagnosing a microinvasive or invasive cervical carcinoma far outweighs the risk of conization. 
Stress hormone and blood glucose response following acute stroke in the elderly. We studied the relation of reactive hyperglycemia, stress hormone response, and outcome in 23 consecutive elderly patients (median age 80 [range 75-92] years) following an acute first stroke. The median delay from the onset of the stroke to the first blood sample (day 0) was 9 (range 4-22) hours. Subsequent blood samples were taken, after fasting, for the determination of blood glucose, cortisol, catecholamine, insulin, C-peptide, glucagon, and lactate concentrations on days 1, 2, 3, 7, 14, 30, and 90. For all 23 patients, a significant relation was found between the blood glucose concentration and survival (p = 0.03) and the blood glucose concentration decreased with time (p less than 0.001). There was also a significant relation between blood glucose concentration and outcome (p = 0.02). For the 15 patients with complete data, the major determinants of the blood glucose concentration were the cortisol, insulin, and glucagon concentrations (all p less than 0.001), which accounted for 42% of the variance. When all the indexes were analyzed together by logistic regression, only the cortisol concentration was related to outcome (p = 0.02). Hyperglycemia following a stroke probably reflects the intensity of the stress hormone response. We have confirmed that hyperglycemia is a predictor of outcome in persons with stroke. 
Topographic variations in the peripheral course of the greater occipital nerve. Autopsy study with clinical correlations. The description of the peripheral course of the greater occipital nerve (GON) varies in the literature. An autopsy study was done on 20 cases without known headache problems. These findings showed a marked variation in the relation between the GON and nuchal muscles. The trapezius muscle was penetrated by the GON in 45% of cases, the semispinal muscle of the head was penetrated in 90% of cases, and the inferior oblique muscle of head was penetrated in 7.5% of cases. Macroscopic findings of possible compression were made in 11 cases (27.5%), indicating that nerve compression per se may be of minor importance since it seems to exist in the absence of headache. 
Efficacy and safety of a perioperative enoxaparin regimen in total hip replacement under various anesthesias. Four trials in which enoxaparin, a low-molecular-weight heparin, was used in patients having hip surgery are reported. In the first two trials, enoxaparin was given before general anesthesia. The protocol consisted of 40 mg of enoxaparin, 4,000 anti-factor Xa IU, subcutaneously 12 hours before surgery, followed by the same dose 12 hours after surgery and then once daily. In the third trial, this protocol was compared with unfractionated heparin calcium given in a standardized manner and appeared to be significantly superior both in efficacy and tolerance. In the fourth trial, the protocol was adapted for use in spinal subarachnoidal anesthesia; 20 mg of enoxaparin, 2,000 anti-factor Xa IU, was given subcutaneously 1 hour after anesthesia and 40 mg 12 hours later. In all these trials tolerance was good. Excessive bleeding did not occur with the 40 mg once daily regimen. Efficacy was good and compared favorably with other protocols in use. 
Left ventricular filling in the systemic hypertension of obesity. Cardiac structure and systolic as well as diastolic functions were evaluated by 2-dimensional M-mode echocardiography in lean and obese patients who were either hypertensive or normotensive. Diastolic function, as assessed by diminished normalized early peak filling rate and prolonged duration of rapid filling, was decreased in hypertensive patients compared with normotensive patients (p = 0.02). When compared with lean patients with similar blood pressure levels, obese patients exhibited a lower normalized peak filling rate (p = 0.0014) but no difference in duration of rapid filling. A significant correlation was observed between the normalized peak filling rate and either body mass index or left ventricular (LV) mass (r = 0.355 and r = -0.32, respectively; p less than 0.001). Obese patients had greater LV end-diastolic and systolic dimensions (p less than 0.005 and p less than 0.02, respectively), LV wall thickness (p less than 0.05) and LV mass (p less than 0.007) than lean patients. Impairment of LV filling was most pronounced in obese hypertensive patients. It is concluded that the burden on the left ventricle imposed by obesity causes cardiac enlargement and impairment of LV filling regardless of levels of arterial pressure. 
Immunocytochemical analysis of progesterone receptors in breast cancer. Breast cancer specimens from 116 patients were assayed for the presence of progesterone receptor (PR), with the use of a highly specific monoclonal antibody and the peroxidase-antiperoxidase technique on cryostat and permanent sections. Results were compared with those obtained by the conventional PR determination by dextran-coated charcoal (DCC) assay; they were in concordance in 90% of cryostat sections and 85% of paraffin-embedded tissue. The sensitivity and specificity of the PR immunocytochemical assay (PR-ICA) were 91% and 89% for frozen sections and 83% and 89% for permanent sections, respectively. The immunostained slides also were evaluated for several semiquantitative features, including staining intensity, heterogeneity of staining, and the proportion of positive tumor cells. A statistically significant correlation was found between the percentage of tumor cells stained with the PR immunocytochemical technique and the PR-cytosol levels (P less than 0.05). These results suggest that the PR-ICA is an effective tool in the evaluation of PR content in breast cancer and can be applied in paraffin as well as frozen sections. This technique provides excellent morphologic detail, as well as tissue localization for PR. It also offers an alternative for assessment of PR when fresh tissue is not available for conventional hormone receptor analysis. The immunocytochemical assay can be performed easily at community hospitals. Because it requires only a small amount of tissue, PR-ICA is an ideal method for analyzing specimens of insufficient size for the DCC assay. This technique also is suited to the evaluation of fine-needle aspiration biopsy specimens. 
Strength and skeletal muscle adaptations in heavy-resistance-trained women after detraining and retraining. Six women who had participated in a previous 20-wk strength training study for the lower limb detrained for 30-32 wk and subsequently retrained for 6 wk. Seven untrained women also participated in the 6-wk "retraining" phase. In addition, four women from each group volunteered to continue training an additional 7 wk. The initial 20-wk training program caused an increase in maximal dynamic strength, hypertrophy of all three major fiber types, and a decrease in the percentage of type IIb fibers. Detraining had relatively little effect on fiber cross-sectional area but resulted in an increased percentage of type IIb fibers with a concomitant decrease in IIa fibers. Maximal dynamic strength decreased but not to pretraining levels. Retraining for 6 wk resulted in significant increases in the cross-sectional areas of both fast fiber types (IIa and IIab + IIb) compared with detraining values and a decrease in the percentage of type IIb fibers. The 7-wk extension accentuated these trends such that cross-sectional areas continued to increase (nonsignificant) and no IIb fibers could be found. Similar results were found for the nonpreviously trained women. These data suggest that rapid muscular adaptations occur as a result of strength training in previously trained as well as non-previously trained women. Some adaptations (fiber area and maximal dynamic strength) may be retained for long periods during detraining and may contribute to a rapid return to "competitive" form. 
The osseointegration technique for the rehabilitation of the exenterated orbit. Osseointegrated implants can be used successfully to support maxillofacial prostheses. Six patients (aged 37 to 80 years; average age, 68 years) underwent orbital exenteration for eyelid neoplasms infiltrating into the orbit. Each patient underwent a two-stage osseointegration procedure in preparation for fitting an orbital prosthesis. In the first stage, three or four bone-anchored fixtures were placed into the bony orbital rim. Skin penetration and abutment placement were performed in the second-stage operation, performed 3 to 6 months later. Successful osseointegration was achieved in 17 (94.4%) of 18 fixtures in five nonirradiated patients. All five patients were successfully fitted with an implant-retained prosthesis. One patient who underwent irradiation lost all four fixtures that had been placed. This patient chose to wear a black patch rather than a conventional prosthesis held in with adhesive. Average follow-up was 16 months for the five patients who were successfully fitted with orbital prostheses (range, 6 to 30 months). 
Adenocarcinoma of the stomach: a plea for early diagnosis. In the United States, early diagnosis and cure of gastric carcinoma remain elusive. Patients with this disease commonly have gastrointestinal symptoms that often go unexplained. Physicians give gastric carcinoma a low priority in their differential diagnosis and are unaware of the risk factors patients may have. Patients may have a normal upper gastrointestinal series, and fiberoptic gastroscopy is delayed. Patients with unexplained indigestion and abdominal pain, coupled with such risk factors for gastric carcinoma as national origin, diet, heredity, and previous subtotal gastrectomy for gastric ulcers, should be given the opportunity of esophagogastroduodenoscopy. 
Diagnostic and therapeutic strategies of white clot syndrome. This study describes our experience with 12 patients with white clot syndrome encountered during a recent 36-month period. The diagnosis was based on the following criteria: (1) development of thrombocytopenia of less than 100,000/mm3 during administration of heparin therapy, (2) normalization of the platelet count after an interruption in heparin therapy, (3) exclusion of other causes of thrombocytopenia, (4) a positive heparin-induced platelet aggregation test, (5) detection of white clots on pathologic examination, and (6) the presence of thrombotic complications. Of 2,500 patients who received heparin therapy, 12 (0.48%) developed white clot syndrome. Various indications, routes of administration, and types of heparin were implicated. The mean platelet nadir was 26,900/mm3, and the mean time to onset of heparin-induced thrombocytopenia was 5 days. Thrombotic complications included arterial occlusions of the legs in 11 patients, deep vein thrombosis of the legs in 9 patients (4 had pulmonary embolism), and combined arterial and venous thrombosis in 8 patients. Treatment strategies included discontinuation of heparin in all patients and intravenous infusion of dextran, followed by arterial thrombectomy in four patients, urokinase therapy in two patients for arterial complications, and insertion of Greenfield filters in six patients. All patients were given warfarin. The mortality rate was 25% and the morbidity rate was 50%. An initial platelet count should be obtained on all patients prior to receiving heparin, followed by repeat platelet counts every 2 to 3 days. Once thrombocytopenia or thrombosis is diagnosed, heparin should be discontinued and other methods of therapy considered. 
Antithrombin III supplementation reduces heparin requirement and platelet loss during hemodialysis of patients with fulminant hepatic failure. Previous studies have shown that antithrombin III levels are low in fulminant hepatic failure, and heparin kinetics are abnormal, making control of heparinization difficult during hemodialysis of these patients who are at risk of bleeding. In this study, we have performed a controlled, randomized trial of antithrombin III supplementation on heparin activity, occurrence of bleeding and the platelet count and activation during hemodialysis in 24 patients with fulminant hepatic failure. The treated group of 12 patients was given 3,000 units of antithrombin III before hemodialysis. Antithrombin III supplementation was shown to normalize antithrombin III levels during hemodialysis (prelevels: 0.22 +/- 0.03 U/ml S.E.; at 1 hr 0.99 +/- 0.06 U/ml; p less than 0.001; control prelevels: 0.24 +/- 0.03 U/ml; at 1 hr 0.23 +/- 0.04 U/ml). Total heparin usage was significantly decreased by antithrombin III supplementation (median 5,200 U; range = 2,000 to 13,000) as compared with the control group (median 10,200 U; range = 5,000 to 16,500; p less than 0.005). Blood heparin level (antifactor Xa activity) after the initial bolus was significantly greater in the antithrombin III-supplemented subjects (0.40 +/- 0.07 U/ml compared with 0.22 +/- 0.05 U/ml in the control group; p less than 0.05). The significant reduction in platelet count observed in the control patients (18% +/- 6% at 1 hr; p less than 0.05) did not occur in antithrombin III patients (6% +/- 4% at 1 hr), which was reflected by a lower release of the platelet-specific protein beta-thromboglobulin. Two of 12 patients in both groups showed minor bleeding around vascular access sites during the first hemodialysis. 
Time course of creatine kinase release after termination of sustained ventricular dysrhythmias. Differentiation between primary and secondary (caused by acute myocardial infarction) ventricular fibrillation has important therapeutic and prognostic implications. The diagnosis of myocardial infarction is based on clinical, ECG, and creatine kinase MB isoenzyme (MBCK) activity. Enzymatic criteria might not be able to confirm the diagnosis of myocardial infarction after recent cardioversion. The routine use of electrophysiologic studies involving the induction and termination of ventricular dysrhythmias provides a setting in which enzyme release as a result of cardioversion alone can be examined. Therefore a systematic investigation of the magnitude and time course of creatine kinase (CK) and MBCK release was performed after termination of ventricular dysrhythmias in 57 patients undergoing electrophysiologic studies. Of patients requiring external cardioversion, only 50% had an elevation in CK and MBCK activity. Elevation when present corrected with the number of shocks and cumulative energy delivered. The magnitude of MBCK release exceeded 10% of the total CK activity in 9% of observations. Pace-termination of ventricular tachycardia did not result in enzyme release. Arrhythmia characteristics, coronary artery disease, and left ventricular function did not affect the magnitude of the time course of enzyme release. These data suggest that cardioversion with multiple shocks may result in a component of MBCK release, and thus a false positive diagnosis of primary acute myocardial infarction may be made by relying exclusively on the enzyme release pattern. 
Localized irradiation of testes with carcinoma in situ: effects on Leydig cell function and eradication of malignant germ cells in 20 patients. Twenty men (median age, 31 yr) previously treated for unilateral testicular cancer received localized irradiation in a dose of 20 Gray in 10 fractions for carcinoma in situ of the remaining testis. Follow-up testicular biopsies performed 3 (n = 19) and 24 (n = 14) months after the treatment showed in all cases a Sertoli cell-only pattern. Hormonal evaluation was performed before as well as 3, 12, 24, and 36 months after radiation treatment. Endocrine parameters were followed for a median of 30 months (3-36 months). Baseline serum testosterone values decreased during the follow-up period from 13.3 +/- 6.0 to 10.8 +/- 6.4 nmol/L (mean +/- SD), although the decrease was not statistically significant (P = 0.06). Serum LH values increased during the first 3 months of follow-up from 10.4 +/- 5.4 to 15.6 +/- 7.3 IU/L (P less than 0.0001) and then remained unchanged. Significant decreases in GnRH- and hCG-stimulated testosterone levels also indicated an impairment of Leydig cell function. FSH levels increased (P less than 0.0001) during the first 3 months of follow-up from 21.8 +/- 11.1 to 33.2 +/- 13.2 IU/L. We conclude that localized irradiation of 20 Gray eradicated carcinoma in situ germ cells. Development of a second testicular cancer has until now been prevented. Leydig cell function was partially impaired by the radiation dose given. 
Investigations on etiology of Crohn's disease. Humoral immune response to stress (heat shock) proteins. Many investigators have tried to prove a relationship between Crohn's disease and Mycobacteria. Recent evidence suggests that some autoimmune diseases may be initiated through "molecular mimicry" between mycobacterial stress protein antigens and their human homologs. We investigated whether antibody to stress proteins was more frequent in patients with Crohn's disease than controls. We used ATP binding to separate stress proteins (heat-shock-induced, de novo-synthesized, and constitutively expressed ATP-binding proteins) from crude extracts obtained from Mycobacteria and from an SV40-transformed human epithelial cell line that expresses a heat-shock protein, hsp73, as a complex with SV40 T antigen. We used immunoblots to compare sera from 34 patients with Crohn's disease, 14 with ulcerative colitis, and 14 with duodenal or gastric ulcers (noninflammatory bowel disease control patients). We found no statistically significant pattern or frequency of antibodies against single proteins or a combination of mycobacterial or human stress proteins. These observations do not support the hypothesis that a humoral immune response to stress proteins of Mycobacteria is important in the pathogenesis of Crohn's disease. 
Hypertrophic spinal pachymeningitis: report of two cases and review of the literature. The cases of two patients with idiopathic pachymeningitis hypertrophica that caused progressive paraparesis are presented. Gadolinium-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging was used to demonstrate this pathological entity in one patient, and myelography was used in the other. Decompressive surgery led to significant neurological improvement. The etiology, diagnosis, and management of this disease is discussed, and the literature is reviewed. To our knowledge, this is the first report to describe the features of this rare pathological entity on magnetic resonance imaging. 
Marijuana as antiemetic medicine: a survey of oncologists' experiences and attitudes. A random-sample, anonymous survey of the members of the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) was conducted in spring 1990 measuring the attitudes and experiences of American oncologists concerning the antiemetic use of marijuana in cancer chemotherapy patients. The survey was mailed to about one third (N = 2,430) of all United States-based ASCO members and yielded a response rate of 43% (1,035). More than 44% of the respondents report recommending the (illegal) use of marijuana for the control of emesis to at least one cancer chemotherapy patient. Almost one half (48%) would prescribe marijuana to some of their patients if it were legal. As a group, respondents considered smoked marijuana to be somewhat more effective than the legally available oral synthetic dronabinol ([THC] Marinol; Unimed, Somerville, NJ) and roughly as safe. Of the respondents who expressed an opinion, a majority (54%) thought marijuana should be available by prescription. These results bear on the question of whether marijuana has a "currently accepted medical use," at issue in an ongoing administrative and legal dispute concerning whether marijuana in smoked form should be available by prescription along with synthetic THC in oral form. This survey demonstrates that oncologists' experience with the medical use of marijuana is more extensive, and their opinions of it are more favorable, than the regulatory authorities appear to have believed. 
Validation of a computerized technique for detection of the gas exchange anaerobic threshold in cardiac disease. Respiratory gas exchange data were collected from 77 men greater than 6 months after acute myocardial infarction. Maximal exercise was performed on an ergometer cycle programmed for a ramp protocol of 15 W/min. The gas exchange anaerobic threshold (ATge) was determined by analysis of the carbon dioxide elimination (VCO2) vs oxygen consumption (VO2) curve below a respiratory exchange ratio of 1.00 using a computerized algorithm. This value was estimated at the inflection of VCO2 from a line with a slope of 1 which intersects the VCO2 vs VO2 curve. The relation of the ATge to the lactate acidosis threshold was studied in 29 patients. The reproducibility of the ATge method was studied in 77 patients. Mean (+/- standard deviation) VO2 for the ATge was 905 +/- 220 vs 866 +/- 299 ml/min for the lactate acidosis threshold (r = 0.86, p less than 0.001). Mean VO2 at the ATge for test 1 was 968 +/- 225 vs 952 +/- 217 ml/min for test 2 (r = 0.71, p less than 0.001). Mean peak VO2 was 1,392 +/- 379 vs 912 +/- 202 ml/min at the ATge (r = 0.76, p less than 0.001). Results demonstrate that this ATge method correlates well with the lactate acidosis threshold, is reproducible, and should be useful as an objective measure of submaximal exercise performance. 
Gastrointestinal transit of solid-liquid meal in chronic alcoholics. Gastric emptying, mouth-to-cecum transit, and whole-gut transit of a solid-liquid meal were measured in 46 chronic alcoholics and in 30 control subjects by using scintigraphic techniques, hydrogen breath test, and stool markers. In the alcoholics various parameters such as ethanol consumption, gastrointestinal symptoms, and alcoholic neuropathy were determined and related to gastrointestinal transit times. Although there was no significant overall difference of gastric emptying, abnormally delayed gastric emptying was detected in 23.9% of the alcoholics but no control subject (P less than 0.005). Mouth-to-cecum transit was significantly prolonged in the alcoholics (P less than 0.001) with 14 alcoholics (37.8%) disclosing delayed mouth-to-cecum transit. No significant differences between both groups were detected concerning whole gut transit. In the alcoholics there was a significant correlation of dyspeptic symptoms with delayed gastric emptying (P less than 0.006), and alcoholics with diarrhea had an accelerated mouth-to-cecum transit as compared to those without diarrhea (P less than 0.05). Neither the presence of autonomic or peripheral neuropathy nor the presence of liver cirrhosis or ascites was significantly related to gastrointestinal transit times. However, the daily ethanol ingestion significantly correlated with gastric emptying (P less than 0.005). It is concluded, therefore, that in chronic alcoholics the small intestine and the stomach are most likely to be affected by gastrointestinal transit disorders and that these transit abnormalities are potentially related to toxic damage of gastrointestinal smooth muscle. 
Effect of light chain V region duplication on IgG oligomerization and in vivo efficacy. A human immunoglobulin G1 (IgG1) antibody oligomer was isolated from a transfected myeloma cell line that produced a monoclonal antibody to group B streptococci. Compared to the IgG1 monomer, the oligomer was significantly more effective at protecting neonatal rats from infection in vivo. The oligomer was also shown to cross the placenta and to be stable in neonatal rats. Immunochemical analysis and complementary DNA sequencing showed that the transfected cell line produced two distinct kappa light chains: a normal light chain (Ln) with a molecular mass of 25 kilodaltons and a 37-kilodalton species (L37), the domain composition of which was variable-variable-constant (V-V-C). Cotransfection of vectors encoding the heavy chain and L37 resulted in production of oligomeric IgG. 
Synchronous primary mucosal melanoma and mucoepidermoid carcinoma of the maxillary antrum. We present a case of contiguous primary malignant melanoma of the nose and maxillary antrum and mucoepidermoid carcinoma of the maxillary antrum. We believe that this association has not been previously recorded; whether this represents divergent differentiation in a single tumour or 'collision' of two separate tumours is uncertain. 
Mediastinal granuloma secondary to histoplasmosis. Mediastinal granuloma is one of the many potential clinical manifestations of infection with Histoplasma capsulatum. Plain radiographs, computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging can help identify intrathoracic adenopathy, calcification, and compression or invasion of vital structures. 
Comparative evaluation of carcinoembryonic antigen, secretory component, and mucins in index and metachronous adenomas of the colorectum. Of 124 patients who underwent endoscopic polypectomy, 70 were colonoscopically reevaluated during a mean period of 10 years. On the basis of the clinical outcome, the patients were divided into three groups: group 1, 31 patients who had a colon still with no adenomas or cancer; group 2, 35 patients in whom one or more metachronous adenomatous polyps developed; and group 3, 4 patients in whom a carcinoma of the colon subsequently developed. In addition to the clinical and pathological features, the pattern of the immunohistologic staining for carcinoembryonic antigen and secretory component was studied. Moreover, the mucin histochemical staining intensity of neutral mucins, sulfomucins, and sialomucins was evaluated. The features of the 40 index adenomas obtained from patients in group 1 were compared with the features of the 51 index adenomas from patients in group 2. Furthermore, these characteristics of the index adenomas were compared with those in the 69 metachronous adenomas of the group 2 patients. It was found that male sex (P less than 0.005) and a history of colorectal neoplasia (P less than 0.02) are main factors for the development of new adenomas. The neutral mucins were less abundant in the group 2 index adenomas (r = -0.21; P less than 0.05). The expression of the other evaluated markers was not significantly different between both groups, although the group 2 index adenomas were significantly smaller (r = -0.22; P less than 0.05) and showed a trend toward a more pronounced cytoplasmic expression of carcinoembryonic antigen than the index adenomas from group 1 (22% vs. 12.5%). Moreover, it was found that in comparison with the index adenomas, metachronous adenomas were significantly smaller (r = -0.24; P less than 0.01) and more sessile (r = 0.20; P less than 0.002). Significant negative correlations, i.e., decrease, were also found in the expression of carcinoembryonic antigen (surface P less than 0.001; cytoplasmic P less than 0.05) and neutral mucins (P less than 0.005) between the index adenomas and the metachronous adenomas, whereas positive correlations were found for secretory component (P = 0.0001) and sulfomucins (P less than 0.05). These findings suggest that a limited production of neutral mucins in the goblet cells of a small index adenoma from a male patient with a history of colorectal neoplasia is indicative of an increased risk for the development of new colorectal adenomas. Furthermore, the clinical, mucin histochemical, and immunohistochemical findings of the metachronous adenomas show less malignancy-associated features than those of the index adenomas. 
Factors affecting survival of patients with ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm in a West Virginia community. The hospital records for patients treated for ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysms in southern West Virginia during a recent five year period were reviewed. The over-all mortality rate was 62 per cent. Patients with intraperitoneal rupture had a higher mortality rate (97 per cent) than patients with retroperitoneal rupture (25 per cent). Patients at increased risk were more than 80 years of age, presented with syncope, experienced a short duration of symptoms before seeking medical attention, had preoperative systolic blood pressure levels of less than 90 millimeters of mercury and had a preoperative hemoglobin level of less than 8. Other factors associated with death were a delay in beginning surgical treatment, a larger total blood loss and amount of blood transfused. The results of multivariate analysis demonstrated that preoperative blood pressure, preoperative hemoglobin, presence of syncope and the amount of blood loss were, in large part, reflections of the type of rupture and had only slight independent relationship to mortality. The most effective method of preventing fatal outcome is elective resection of the aneurysms before rupture occurs. 
Rectus sheath hematoma in an anticoagulated patient. Rectus sheath hematoma is an unusual though not rare cause of abdominal wall mass. There are multiple causes for RSH, and with a thorough history, usually some precipitating factor can be identified. Ultrasound and CT are useful in making an accurate diagnosis. Treatment is usually conservative unless the hematoma is enlarging or if the diagnosis is uncertain. 
Angiosarcoma at the site of a Dacron vascular prosthesis: a case report and literature review. Four of 32 reported sarcomas related to the aorta have arisen around previously placed aortic vascular prostheses suggesting that the graft may have been an etiologic factor. Our recent experience with such an angiosarcoma arising around a Dacron aortic graft prompted a review of the lesion to identify risk factors, diagnostic approaches, and treatment options. The diagnosis of these sarcomas is seldom made before operation. Animal studies have implicated plastic polymers including Dacron as carcinogenic materials capable of inducing sarcoma in 7% to 50% of exposures. Because of the rarity of these tumors and the thousands of vascular implants used over the past 30 years, it is unlikely that this degree of risk can be extrapolated to humans. However, a tumor should be included in the differential diagnosis of any mass or thromboembolic event associated with a vascular prosthesis. 
Endocrine responses to long-term administration of the antiprogesterone RU486 in patients with pelvic endometriosis. OBJECTIVE: To examine endocrine and clinical responses to long-term administration of RU486 in patients with endometriosis. DESIGN: Prospective open trial. SETTING: Faculty practice of the authors. PATIENTS, PARTICIPANTS: Six normally cycling women with endometriosis were recruited. INTERVENTIONS: Subjects received RU486 100 mg/d for 3 months. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S): Hormonal changes during RU486 were compared with control data obtained in the preceding cycle during the early follicular phase. Clinical responses were determined by patient assessment and second-look laparoscopy. RESULTS: All women became amenorrheic, and daily urinary levels of ovarian steroid metabolites remained acyclic. Mean luteinizing hormone (LH) (P less than 0.02) and LH pulse amplitude (P less than 0.05) were increased without changes in LH pulse frequency. An antiglucocorticoid effect was demonstrated by an increase in serum cortisol (P less than 0.01) and adrenocorticotropic hormone (P less than 0.05) levels. Treatment resulted in an improvement in pelvic pain in all subjects without significant change in the extent of disease as evaluated by follow-up laparoscopy. CONCLUSIONS: Daily administration of RU486 results in acyclic ovarian function and improvement in the subjective painful symptoms of endometriosis. 
Mitral valve replacement combined with coronary artery operation: determinants of early and late results. Mitral valve replacement combined with coronary artery bypass grafting has been reported as being associated with a higher mortality than either mitral valve replacement or coronary artery bypass grafting alone. Cause of mitral valve disease and severity of mitral regurgitation have been reported as related to mortality. To study the correlation of the cause of mitral valve disease and severity of mitral regurgitation to hospital mortality and long-term survival, we analyzed the results of 135 patients undergoing mitral valve replacement and coronary artery bypass grafting between June 1974 and August 1989. The hospital mortality was 11.8% (16/135). Fifteen preoperative and operative variables were tested for correlation with hospital or late mortality using univariate tests and multivariate regression. Advanced age (greater than 60 years), New York Heart Association functional class, and wall motion score were independently associated with hospital mortality (p less than 0.05). The cause of mitral valve disease and severity of mitral regurgitation were not related to hospital mortality or long-term survival (p greater than 0.05). The follow-up rate was 96.6% for the hospital survivors (115/119). Mean follow-up was 52.6 +/- 4.1 months. There were 35 late deaths. Survival was 91.9%, 89.9%, 78%, and 49.9% at 1, 2, 5, and 10 postoperative years, respectively. Preoperative New York Heart Association functional class and use of catecholamines during the postoperative intensive care period were independently related to late survival (p less than 0.05). 
Alleviation of cocaine-induced coronary vasoconstriction by nitroglycerin. Cocaine induces vasoconstriction of epicardial coronary arteries in patients with and without coronary artery disease, and this vasoconstriction is particularly marked in segments narrowed by atherosclerosis. To assess the effect of nitroglycerin on cocaine-induced coronary vasoconstriction, computer-assisted quantitative analysis was performed on non-diseased and diseased coronary artery segments in 23 patients (18 men, 5 women, aged 43 to 65 years) 1) at baseline, 2) after administration of intranasal saline solution (in 8 patients) or 2 mg/kg of cocaine (in 15 patients), and then 3) after administration of sublingual placebo (in 6 patients) or 0.4 or 0.8 mg of nitroglycerin (in 9 patients) in the 15 patients given cocaine. In response to cocaine administration, coronary artery cross-sectional area decreased 22 +/- 7% (mean +/- SD) in non-diseased segments (p less than 0.05) and 45 +/- 18% in diseased segments (p less than 0.02). The magnitude of vasoconstriction was greater (p = 0.01) in the diseased segments. Sublingual nitroglycerin abolished the vasoconstriction in both non-diseased and diseased segments. Thus, nitroglycerin alleviates cocaine-induced vasoconstriction in patients with coronary artery disease. 
Drug-induced fever due to diltiazem. To our knowledge, drug-induced fever has not been reported with the use of diltiazem hydrochloride, a commonly prescribed calcium channel blocker. We describe a patient in whom this was the primary manifestation of drug hypersensitivity. A 67-year-old man was admitted for management of a diabetic foot ulcer. His hospital course was complicated by a non-Q-wave myocardial infarction, for which diltiazem was prescribed. On the seventh day of therapy, he experienced fever, with temperatures as high as 38.8 degrees C. Despite an extensive evaluation, which included a gallium scan, a technetium bone scan, and abdominal ultrasound, a source could not be found. On the 16th day of therapy, however, relative eosinophilia developed, and 2 days later a pruritic maculopapular rash appeared. Diltiazem therapy was discontinued, leading to resolution of fever within 48 hours. Drug-induced fever should be considered in patients who have unexplained high temperatures during diltiazem therapy. 
Functional, biochemical, and histopathologic consequences of high-dose interleukin-2 administration in rats. A variety of side effects have been reported with the use of interleukin-2 alone or in combination with lymphokine-activated killer cells in patients with disseminated neoplasms. The present study was undertaken to determine the effects of high-dose interleukin-2 administration in normal rats. Sprague-Dawley rats were treated with intravenous recombinant interleukin-2 (900,000 IU/kg/day) for 9 consecutive days. Animals were placed in individual metabolic cages, and arterial blood pressure, food intake, body weight, and urine output were monitored. On day 10, animals were killed by exsanguination, various tissues were harvested, and a variety of hematologic and chemical assays were performed. The results were compared with those of placebo-injected normal control and pair-fed groups. The interleukin-2-treated group exhibited anorexia, weight loss, hypotension, anemia, leukocytosis, lymphocytosis, eosinophilia, hypercalcemia, azotemia, and a marked urinary concentration defect. Histologic examination of various tissues revealed widespread infiltration with mono-nuclear cells and eosinophils in most organs, especially in the lungs and liver of interleukin-2-treated animals. Other abnormalities included severe panlobular hepatitis, hepatocellular necrosis, and thymic involution. Renal involvement was mild and consisted of focal interstitial infiltration by mononuclear cells. According to these observations, administration of high-dose interleukin-2 in normal rats results in a score of significant functional, biochemical, and histologic abnormalities. 
Risk factors for stroke in middle aged British men. OBJECTIVE--To determine the risk factors for stroke in a cohort representative of middle aged British men. DESIGN--Prospective study of a cohort of men followed up for eight years. SETTING--General practices in 24 towns in England, Wales, and Scotland (the British regional heart study). SUBJECTS--7735 men aged 40-59 at screening, selected at random from one general practice in each town. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE--Fatal and non-fatal strokes. RESULTS--110 of the men had at least one stroke; there were four times as many non-fatal as fatal strokes. The relative risk of stroke was 12.1 in men who had high blood pressure (systolic blood pressure greater than or equal to 160 mm Hg) and were current smokers compared with normotensive, non-smoking men. Diastolic blood pressure yielded no additional information, and former cigarette smokers had the same risk as men who had never smoked. Heavy alcohol intake was associated with a relative risk of stroke of 3.8 in men without previously diagnosed cardiovascular disease. Men with pre-existing ischaemic heart disease had an increased risk of stroke, but only when left ventricular hypertrophy on electrocardiography was also present. CONCLUSIONS--Systolic blood pressure, cigarette smoking, and left ventricular hypertrophy on electrocardiography in men with pre-existing ischaemic heart disease were found to be the major risk factors for stroke in middle aged British men. Heavy alcohol intake seemed to increase the risk of stroke in men without previously diagnosed cardiovascular disease. A large proportion of strokes should be preventable by controlling blood pressure and stopping smoking. 
Scalp tumours mimicking encephaloceles. Two neonates presented with benign scalp tumours that mimicked encephaloceles. In the more recent case ultrasonography confirmed that the tumour was extracranial. 
MRI of the paranasal sinuses: incidental abnormalities and their relationship to symptoms. Magnetic resonance imaging is able to demonstrate a wide range of sinus abnormalities. Incidental findings in patients referred for neuroradiology because of suspected intracranial pathology are surprisingly common and were present in 37.5 per cent of 483 images examined. The maxillary and ethmoid sinuses were most commonly affected with 27 and 26 per cent of images abnormal whereas the frontal and sphenoid sinuses were less commonly affected with 5 per cent of each abnormal. If minor changes were excluded then 17 per cent of patients had either fluid, a polyp or marked mucosal thickening in at least one sinus. Nasal symptoms, other than the presence of a cold, showed no statistically significant relationship to abnormal findings. Many people with inflammatory changes in their sinuses demonstrated on MRI do not have symptoms classically attributed to sinusitis. 
Anti-carcinoembryonic antigen immunoscintigraphy (technetium-99m-monoclonal antibody BW 431/26) and serum CEA levels in patients with suspected primary and recurrent colorectal carcinoma. This study comprises a total of 141 patients with suspected primary and recurrent colorectal carcinomas, in whom immunoscintigraphy with 99mTc-Mab BW 431/26 was performed. Whole-body scans were done 5.5 hr and SPECT imaging of the abdominal region was done at 6 and 24 hr postinjection of 1100 MBq 99mTc-labeled Mab (1 mg). In the course of primary tumor identification (n = 65), sensitivity of anti-CEA immunoscintigraphy was 95%, specificity 91%. In the diagnosis of early recurrences (n = 76), immunoscintigraphy was the method of choice to clarify the problem (sensitivity 94%; specificity 86%). Overall sensitivity of immunoscintigraphy in patients with suspected colorectal carcinomas and early recurrences was 95%, specificity 88%. Human anti-mouse antibodies were found in 29% (80% predominantly anti-isotypic, 20% predominantly anti-idiotypic). In contrast to anti-CEA immunoscintigraphy, the results of serum CEA levels were rather disappointing. Only 18 out of the 43 surgically verified primary colorectal carcinomas and 17 out of 32 patients with recurrences showed elevated serum CEA levels. In our clinical experience with this 99mTc-labeled anti-CEA antibody, immunoscintigraphy can play an important role in the identification of early colorectal recurrences and in postoperative colorectal cancer patients it should be performed in cases with unclear transmission computed tomography. 
The pseudotumor syndrome. Disorders of cerebrospinal fluid circulation causing intracranial hypertension without ventriculomegaly. We report a series of eight cases that show a close resemblance to, but are not identical with, pseudotumor cerebri (PTC) as normally defined. The majority of these cases are characterized by raised intracranial pressure without ventriculomegaly. They include two cases of cranial venous outflow obstruction in which clinical or radiologic abnormalities precluded the diagnosis of PTC proper (cases 1 and 2); one case of chronic meningitis in which an abnormal cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) composition precluded the diagnosis of PTC (case 3); two cases without either papilledema or a measured increase of CSF pressure, which in other respects, particularly in response to treatment, resembled PTC (cases 4 and 5); and three cases of what is thought to represent an infantile form of PTC (cases 6 through 8). The purpose of the analysis of these cases is twofold. First, it is argued that these cases throw light on the mechanism of PTC itself, supporting a concept of a disturbance of CSF circulation in this condition, and that they are themselves illuminated by considerations of typical PTC. Second, the cases are used to frame a proposed classification of the pseudotumor syndrome aimed at broadening the diagnostic criteria applied currently to PTC. It is suggested that the pseudotumor syndrome has a single underlying mechanism (disturbed CSF circulation) and that recognition of this mechanism not only clarifies the pathophysiologic processes of PTC but also has important diagnostic and therapeutic implications. 
Structural heterogeneity of faecal alpha 1 antitrypsin shown by immunoblot analysis in patients with Crohn's disease. Faecal alpha 1 antitrypsin was determined in 34 patients with Crohn's disease and in 19 healthy subjects by immune nephelometry. A structural analysis of faecal alpha 1 antitrypsin was carried out using immunoblot analysis under non-reducing conditions. Native serum alpha 1 antitrypsin migrated with an apparent molecular weight of 45 kDa. Proteolytic alpha 1 antitrypsin fragments (5-42 kDa) were specifically immunostained in 13/19 and 22/34 stool samples from control subjects and from patients with Crohn's disease respectively. There was a weak correlation (r = 0.47; p less than 0.02) between the molecular weight of fragmented alpha 1 antitrypsin and the faecal concentration in both groups, indicating that alpha 1 antitrypsin inhibits its own proteolysis by intestinal proteases in a dose dependent way. The incidence of polymeric forms (greater than 45 kDa) was similar in patients (10/34) and control subjects (5/19). In only one case in each group was the native serum form of alpha 1 antitrypsin found in faeces. We conclude that faecal alpha 1 antitrypsin differs structurally from the native serum form. Immunochemical measurements, therefore, reflect rather than represent faecal concentrations of alpha 1 antitrypsin. The controversial results in published reports may be partly explained by these findings. The molecular heterogeneity of faecal alpha 1 antitrypsin is not specifically associated with Crohn's disease. 
Gastroesophageal reflux disease as a cause of chest pain. Patients with recurrent chest pain free of significant coronary artery disease account for 10% to 30% of patients undergoing coronary angiography. Recent studies suggest that gastroesophageal reflux disease may be very common in these patients. The cause of this chest pain seems to be related primarily to an acid-sensitive mucosa regardless of the presence of esophagitis. Unfortunately, a careful history will not distinguish chest pain arising from a cardiac versus an esophageal source. Therefore, all patients must undergo a thorough cardiac evaluation before assuming that acid reflux is the cause of their complaints. Initial gastroenterology evaluation will usually include upper GI endoscopy or barium studies, possibly with acid perfusion (Bernstein) testing, or both. However, the more sensitive and specific test for acid-related disease is prolonged esophageal pH monitoring. This study quantifies the amount of acid reflux but, more importantly, identifies the relationship between chest pain and acid reflux episodes. Patients should be studied in the outpatient setting with emphasis placed on performing activities that replicate their chest pain. Although we presume that acid-induced chest pain responds as well as heartburn to vigorous antireflux regimens, there are few studies to address this issue. Nevertheless, I have had great success in treating these patients with either high-dose H2 blockers or omeprazole therapy. 
DNA ploidy of spindle cell soft-tissue tumors and its relationship to histology and clinical outcome. With the use of fresh cell suspensions, the DNA ploidy of 11 benign and 27 malignant spindle cell soft-tissue lesions was determined by flow cytometry (37 cases) and/or image cytometry (35 cases). Of the 27 malignant lesions, 10 were low- or intermediate-grade sarcomas, and 17 were high-grade sarcomas. In the malignant lesions, the DNA ploidy was correlated with the histologic grade and the clinical outcome. Of the 11 benign lesions, six had a diploid DNA ploidy pattern, and five were nondiploid by either flow cytometry or image cytometry. All benign cases had a favorable outocome regardless of ploidy. Eight of the 10 low- or intermediate-grade malignant lesions were diploid, whereas two were nondiploid. Of the 17 high-grade sarcomas, 15 were nondiploid by either method of measurement and nine by both. Of the 10 diploid malignant tumors, only one had an unfavorable outcome (malignant mesothelioma with biopsy only), whereas of the 17 malignant lesions that were nondiploid, five had no evidence of recurrent disease, three cases recurred, eight patients died of disease, and one patient died of an unrelated cause. We concluded that (1) ploidy does not differentiate benign from malignant spindle cell soft-tissue tumors, (2) the nondiploid DNA pattern is more common in high-grade than in low- or intermediate-grade sarcomas, and (3) there is a statistically significant relationship between nondiploidy and a worse clinical outcome in sarcomas. 
Effects of selected beta-adrenergic blocking agents on sleep stages in spontaneously hypertensive rats. The effects on sleep of six beta-adrenergic blockers (propranolol, dilevalol, pindolol, metoprolol, celiprolol and atenolol) which differ in their pharmacological characteristics were studied in spontaneously hypertensive rats. Electroencephalographic activity was recorded for 6 hr after p.o. administration of drugs or vehicle, and the stages of wakefulness, rapid eye movements (REM) sleep and non-REM sleep (non-REM) were classified thereafter. In separate experiments antihypertensive activity of each drug was assessed by the tail-cuff technique. The most common effect of the beta-blockers examined was a decrease of the duration of REM. The effect was marked for propranolol (10-100 mg/kg), celiprolol (10-100 mg/kg) and pindolol (1-10 mg/kg), whereas it occurred at low doses, but not at high doses for metoprolol (10 mg/kg) and atenolol (3 and 10 mg/kg). Dilevalol induced a moderate REM decrease at 30 mg/kg only. For the beta-1 antagonists, the dose reducing REM substantially (ED30) was slightly above (1.4- to 3.7-fold) that effective on blood pressure (ED10), whereas the separation was high for pindolol (17.4-fold) and dilevalol (22.4-fold). Conversely, propranolol displayed a weak antihypertensive activity in this model and was more potent on REM than in reducing blood pressure. Propranolol, celiprolol and atenolol also increased duration of wakefulness. Considering the pharmacological characteristics of the beta-blockers examined, it is suggested that selective beta-1 antagonism and interaction with other neurotransmitters, such as serotonin, are relevant to the potential effects of this class of antihypertensive drugs on sleep function. 
Erythropoietic protoporphyria: unusual skin and neurological problems after liver transplantation. The case of a woman with protoporphyria who developed liver failure and underwent liver transplantation is described. During the pretransplant episode of liver failure she developed quadriparesis that rapidly progressed after transplantation to a severe polyneuropathy. Following transplantation she also developed a second-degree burn of the light-exposed abdominal wall. The neuropathy resembled that observed in other forms of porphyria, and it is proposed that the extreme disturbance of protoporphyrin levels associated with protoporphyrin-induced liver failure caused this neuropathy. Such a neuropathy has not previously been described in protoporphyria. Erythrocyte protoporphyrin levels remain high and fecal levels normal, although results of liver tests are normal. She remains photosensitive, which emphasizes that although liver transplantation may be lifesaving in this disorder, it is not curative, and care must be taken to prevent photosensitive damage to skin and light-exposed internal organs. 
Analysis of the hemodynamic and ventilatory effects of laparoscopic cholecystectomy. Laparoscopic cholecystectomy uses carbon dioxide, a highly diffusable gas, for insufflation. With extended periods of insufflation, patient arterial carbon dioxide levels may be adversely altered. Patients were selected for laparoscopic cholecystectomy using the same criteria as for open cholecystectomy. Twenty patients (group 1) had normal preoperative cardiopulmonary status (American Society of Anesthesiologists class I), while 10 patients (group 2) had previously diagnosed cardiac or pulmonary disease (class II or III). Demographic, hemodynamic, arterial blood gas, and ventilatory data were collected before peritoneal insufflation and at intervals during surgery. Patients with preoperative cardiopulmonary disease demonstrated significant increases in arterial carbon dioxide levels and decreases in pH during carbon dioxide insufflation compared with patients without underlying disease. Results of concurrent noninvasive methods of assessing changes in partial arterial pressures of carbon dioxide (end-tidal carbon dioxide measured with mass spectrographic techniques) may be misleading and misinterpreted because changes in partial arterial pressures of carbon dioxide are typically much smaller than changes in arterial blood levels and, unlike arterial gas measurements, do not indicate the true level of arterial hypercarbia. During laparoscopic cholecystectomy, patients with chronic cardiopulmonary disease may require careful intraoperative arterial blood gas monitoring of absorbed carbon dioxide. 
Chromosome anomalies in human oocytes in vitro. OBJECTIVE: To determine possible effects on chromosomal status of human oocytes in vitro. DESIGN: A prospective cytogenetic study of human oocytes fixed at 4, 20 (noninseminated oocytes), or approximately 52 hours after pick-up (inseminated-unfertilized oocytes). SETTING: Primary treatment of infertility in an institutional practice. PATIENTS, PARTICIPANTS: Eighty-eight consecutive in vitro fertilization (IVF) patients (262 inseminated-unfertilized oocytes) and 47 IVF patients with greater than 8 oocytes retrieved (95 noninseminated oocytes). INTERVENTIONS: Ultrasound-guided transvaginal follicular aspiration. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S): Planned before data collection began. RESULTS: The incidence of chromosome anomalies did not differ between groups. However, a negative correlation between oocytes apparently without chromosomes and oocytes with fragmented chromosomes was found. CONCLUSIONS: Incubation of oocyte in vitro does not affect the chromosome complement. The mechanisms leading to oocytes apparently without chromosomes and with fragmented chromosomes are self-excluding. 
Hemorrhagic venous infarction after excision of an arteriovenous malformation: case report. A case of arteriovenous malformation (AVM) in which postoperative hemorrhagic infarction developed, probably because of occlusion of the former draining veins, is reported. The hemorrhage developed in the temporal lobe 3 days after the initial operation and was located in the immediate vicinity of the site of the AVM. The following findings suggest that the postsurgical hemorrhage probably resulted from a venous thrombosis: 1) no evidence of residual AVM; 2) delayed onset of the hemorrhage, inconsistent with the time course of a hemorrhage developing according to the breakthrough theory or with insufficient hemostasis with a high-pressure afterload; 3) good correlation between the location of the hemorrhage and the occlusion of the draining veins; and 4) multifocal hemorrhage affecting both the gray matter and the subcortical white matter. Postoperative hemorrhagic infarction caused by thrombosis in the draining veins is rare, but it should be considered as a distinct postoperative complication after removal of an AVM. 
The role of 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D in the maintenance of hypercalcemia in a patient with an ovarian carcinoma producing parathyroid hormone-related protein. The syndrome of humoral hypercalcemia of malignancy (HHM) is thought to be mainly a result of the production of parathyroid hormone-related protein (PTHRP) by malignant tumors. Serum 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D (1,25-DHD) concentrations are generally low in such patients, which contrasts with the findings in animal studies. A patient is reported with HHM from a clear cell ovarian carcinoma and elevated serum immunoreactive PTHRP (about five times the upper limit of normal) in whom serum 1,25-DHD concentrations were abnormally high (200 pmol/l) and associated with increased intestinal calcium absorption. Treatment with two different nitrogen-containing bisphosphonates (pamidronate and [3-dimethyl-amino-1-hydroxypropylidene]-1,1-bisphosphonate) did not normalize serum and urinary calcium despite effective inhibition of bone resorption. These observations suggested an additional intestinal contribution to the maintenance of hypercalcemia. Tumor removal was followed by decreases in serum immunoreactive PTHRP and 1,25-DHD concentrations to their respective normal ranges and normocalcemia. Separating HHM into Types I and II, according to the prevailing serum 1,25-DHD concentrations, can provide a basis for a better understanding of the pathogenesis of hypercalcemia, and it also may have practical use in the successful management of these patients. 
Fatal acetaminophen poisoning with evidence of subendocardial necrosis of the heart. The authors describe a case of fatal acetaminophen overdose which occurred in a 16-year-old female. Her serum acetaminophen concentration 11.5 h postingestion was 154 mg/L. Antidotal therapy was unsuccessful, and after 9 days she died. Autopsy findings included centrilobular zonal liver necrosis, acute proximal renal tubular necrosis, and diffuse alveolar pulmonary damage. Her heart was transplanted into a young woman with congenital heart disease. The recipient expired 14 days after the transplant as a result of sepsis complicating bowel ischemia. The transplanted heart showed extensive subendocardial myocyte necrosis related to acetaminophen toxicity and not rejection. 
Relative incidence of intracranial mass lesions and severe torso injury after accidental injury: implications for triage and management. In a previous study of head injury patients we found that old age, low Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score, pupillary inequality, and falls were significant predictors of intracranial mass lesions (IMLs). Injury to motor vehicle occupants was less likely to result in IML. The present study defines predictors of severe torso injury (STI) in 646 patients admitted to a trauma unit and compares these with predictors of IML obtained in the previous study. Tachycardia and low blood pressure were associated with an increased incidence of STI (p = 0.003, p = 0.0000). The incidence of STI in falls differed from that of IML (13.2% vs. 47.7%, p less than 0.001). There was a greater incidence of STI than IML in MVAs (33.6% vs. 14.8%, p less than 0.001). Patients 70 years of age or older had a higher incidence of IMLs than STIs (p less than 0.001). Patients less than 30 years old had a significantly greater incidence of STIs than IMLs (p less than 0.001). These data suggest that in MVA victims who are less than 30 years old, are hypotensive, and tachycardic, the diagnosis and emergent treatment of severe torso injury should take precedence over measures designed to detect and treat intracranial mass lesions. The converse is true for older patients injured in falls. 
Hepatic colorectal metastases: correlation of MR imaging and pathologic appearance. Results of magnetic resonance (MR) imaging examinations for 76 patients with proved colorectal metastases to the liver were retrospectively reviewed. Signal intensity and morphologic patterns of 157 lesions were scored. The morphologic patterns were correlated with the histologic material obtained at segmental hepatic resections or excisional biopsies in 33 patients. In 154 lesions (98%) colorectal metastases to the liver were found to be hyperintense on MR images acquired with a long repetition time/echo time; in 77 lesions (49%) central low-signal-intensity changes were seen. Virtually all larger lesions demonstrated areas of low signal intensity within the tumor. These areas were found to reflect histologic findings of coagulative necrosis and desmoplasia within the tumor. Peripheral hyperintense halos around central hypointense areas encompassed the growing tumor margin and variable degrees of cell necrosis. Hypointense peripheral rims, which correspond to abnormalities of surrounding hepatic parenchyma, were seen in 40 lesions (25%). This sign should not be assumed to represent the fibrous pseudocapsule of primary hepatic malignancy. No correlation between tumor grade (differentiation) and tumor morphology was observed. 
Relative efficacy of antithrombin compared with antiplatelet agents in accelerating coronary thrombolysis and preventing early reocclusion. BACKGROUND. Optimal coronary thrombolysis should be prompt and persistent. Although activation of platelets and increased thrombin activity have been associated with clinical thrombolysis, the role of each in delaying thrombolysis or inducing early coronary reocclusion has been difficult to define. METHODS AND RESULTS. In conscious dogs with coronary thrombosis induced by electrical current, we assessed the impact on the rapidity of thrombolysis and the incidence of reocclusion of two types of adjunctive treatment given concomitantly with intravenous tissue-type plasminogen activator (t-PA): 1) inhibition of platelet function with a peptide mimetic antagonist of platelet glycoprotein IIb/IIIa receptors or with lysine acetylsalicylic acid (ASA) and 2) inhibition of thrombin activity with recombinant hirudin or with heparin. ASA but not the receptor antagonist shortened the time to thrombolysis with t-PA (20 +/- 13 [mean +/- SD] minutes with ASA, 36 +/- 15 minutes with receptor antagonist, and 43 +/- 16 minutes with the saline control). Reocclusion occurred promptly after completion of the infusion of t-PA in all seven dogs given saline. Reocclusion was delayed and prevented in some dogs within 90 minutes after the end of the infusion of t-PA by both antiplatelet agents but still occurred in 42% despite continued inhibition of platelet function (i.e., three of six dogs given ASA and two of six given receptor antagonist). In contrast, inhibition of thrombin activity with recombinant hirudin in a dose that prolonged the partial thromboplastin time modestly (1.5-2-fold) resulted in accelerated lysis (19 +/- 10 minutes) and prevention of reocclusion in each of six dogs. Heparin given in doses that elicited similar prolongation of the partial thromboplastin time did not accelerate lysis nor prevent reocclusion, which occurred in five of six dogs. CONCLUSIONS. Inhibition of thrombin by recombinant hirudin facilitates thrombolysis and maintains patency of coronary arteries recanalized with t-PA particularly effectively. The benefit conferred may reflect direct anticoagulant effects plus diminished activation of platelets secondary to decreased thrombin activity. 
Long-term results of peridural morphine in 225 patients. The long-term results of peridural morphine in 225 cancer patients have been evaluated. Two methods were employed: percutaneously implanted catheter (175 patients) and subcutaneous reservoirs (50 patients). In the 225 patients, the mean duration of implantation of the peridural catheter was 47.3 days (7-420 days), the mean daily dose of morphine was 13.4 +/- 6.9 (5-80 mg) delivered by 2.6 +/- 0.7 (1-8) injections. The mean duration of action was calculated to be 9.3 +/- 3.8 h (3-32 h). Satisfactory analgesia was achieved in 133 patients (59.1%) in whom peridural morphine was the sole analgesic treatment. Peridural morphine appeared to be especially effective in patients with pain arising in the abdominal region. Complications due to morphine and the catheter were evaluated. 
Endoscopic injection sclerosis: effective treatment for bleeding peptic ulcer. One hundred and nine patients presenting with severe haemorrhage from benign peptic ulcers were randomised to either endoscopic injection sclerotherapy using a combination of 1:100,000 adrenaline and 5% ethanolamine or to conservative treatment. Only high risk patients with active bleeding or endoscopic stigmata of recent haemorrhage and accessible ulcers were considered. The two groups were well matched for age, shock, haemoglobin concentration, endoscopic findings, and consumption of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. The group treated endoscopically had a significantly reduced rebleeding rate (12.5% v 47%, p less than 0.001). Rebleeding was successfully treated in some patients by injection sclerotherapy, other patients underwent urgent surgery. While there was a tendency towards a lower operation rate and lower transfusion requirements in the treated group, this failed to achieve statistical significance. The use of injection sclerotherapy in the conservatively treated group after rebleeding undoubtedly reduced the number of surgical operations. Endoscopic injection sclerotherapy is effective in the prevention of rebleeding in these patients. 
Ultrasound in the diagnosis of the juxta-pleural lesion. Any opacity on a chest radiograph has a wide differential diagnosis. Plain radiography and computed tomography may help to differentiate whether bone, intercostal soft tissue or mediastinum are involved. Bronchoscopy is often negative with peripheral lesions. This leaves the physician with a diagnostic problem. We examined ultrasonically 30 patients with juxta-pleural lesions and performed cutting biopsy in 27. Twenty-four of these produced positive histology (90%). The three that were not biopsied were anechoic and had pulsatile lesions due to vascular abnormalities. There were four benign lesions all with hypoechoic appearances and the 20 malignant cases showed a wide spectrum of echogenicity. Of the malignant lesions, 90% showed pleural line disruption with reduced respiratory movement suggesting chest wall invasion. There were no complications, despite using cutting biopsy. 
Diabetic ketoacidosis. Neurologic collapse during treatment followed by severe developmental morbidity. Diabetic Ketoacidosis (DKA) remains the leading cause of death in children with type 1 diabetes mellitus. Complications occurring during DKA treatment include cerebral edema and neurologic collapse. Developmental outcomes following neurologic deterioration during DKA have varied from no sequelae to severe developmental disabilities. A total of three children developed neurologic deterioration during treatment of DKA at Buffalo Children's Hospital between 1984 and 1987. The authors treated aggressively for cerebral edema. Characteristic findings on the computed tomography (CT) scans and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain included hemorrhagic infarctions of the thalami, basal ganglia and lentiform nuclei. The authors conducted developmental follow-up examinations between 1-1/2 - 3 years following recovery from DKA coma. Although they noted significant recoveries over time, developmental disabilities persisted. The clinical courses and neuroradiographic findings of these patients are compatible with sequelae of central brain stem herniation and cytotoxic brain injury. Continued efforts are needed in the prevention and early detection of clinically significant cerebral edema during treatment of DKA. 
Complications of a failed Bristow procedure and their management. The management of patients who have a failed Bristow reconstruction of the shoulder is very complex. In order to determine the complications that occur when a Bristow procedure fails, and how they should be managed, we retrospectively evaluated forty shoulders in thirty-nine patients who had been treated by the senior one of us for a failed Bristow procedure from 1977 to 1987. The complications of the index Bristow procedures included recurrent painful anterior instability, injury to the articular cartilage, failure of the coracoid bone-block to unite with the glenoid, loosening of the screw, neurovascular injury, and posterior instability. The primary etiology of failure of the index Bristow procedure was excessive laxity of the capsule in thirty-two shoulders (80 per cent) that were affected by chronic, painful anterior or posterior instability. An untreated Perthes-Bankart lesion was present in the remaining eight shoulders (20 per cent). The use of anterior reconstruction for the revision of a failed Bristow procedure is a difficult operation that necessitates meticulous technique. As our over-all plan of treatment resulted in a good or excellent outcome in only 50 per cent of the patients, we do not recommend the Bristow procedure for primary treatment of symptomatic anterior instability of the shoulder. 
Post-triathalon delirium [clinical conference] This is a case presentation of acute delirium in a previously healthy man. It was originally discussed during Morbidity and Mortality Conference at The George Washington, Georgetown Residency Program in Emergency Medicine, December 1989. 
Extensive Bowen's disease of the penile shaft treated with fresh tissue Mohs micrographic surgery in two separate operations. Bowen's disease or squamous cell carcinoma in situ is uncommon on the penile shaft. While surgical excision is the treatment of choice, the Mohs micrographic surgical approach ensures microscopically controlled tumor-free margins with preservation of normal tissue. While small- or medium-sized penile excisions heal very well by second intention, large areas of involvement are often grafted to prevent debilitating contractures. We report a case of near circumferential penile Bowen's disease treated by two separate operations that healed by second intention with very good cosmetic and functional results. 
Endothelin-1 induces hypertrophy with enhanced expression of muscle-specific genes in cultured neonatal rat cardiomyocytes. To determine whether endothelin-1 (ET-1) induces hypertrophy of cardiomyocytes, the effects of ET-1 on the expression of muscle-specific genes and a proto-oncogene, c-fos, in cultured neonatal rat cardiomyocytes were examined by Northern blot analysis. ET-1 (10(-7) M) induced about twofold to fourfold increases in the gene expression of myosin light chain 2, alpha-actin, and troponin I after 6 hours, which continued up to 24 hours. The ET-1-induced increases in mRNA levels for these muscle-specific genes were dose dependent (10(-9) to 10(-7) M). Run-on transcriptional assay showed that the changes in mRNA level for three muscle-specific genes were regulated, at least in part, at the transcriptional level. 12-O-Tetradecanoylphorbol 13-acetate (TPA), a potent protein kinase C activator, and the Ca2+ ionophore ionomycin also increased mRNA levels of three muscle-specific genes. ET-1, TPA, and ionomycin similarly induced the expression of c-fos after 30 minutes, which returned to an undetectable level after 6 hours. ET-1 remarkably and dose-dependently stimulated accumulation of total inositol phosphates in cardiomyocytes. Morphometrical evaluation showed that ET-1 significantly increased surface area of cardiomyocytes without cell proliferation. ET-1 also dose-dependently stimulated the synthesis of protein and DNA, which was unaffected by the L-type calcium channel blocker nicardipine. These data suggest that ET-1 induces hypertrophy of cardiomyocytes associated with the induction of muscle-specific gene transcripts through the possible involvement of protein kinase C activation or intracellular Ca2+ mobilization. 
MRI reveals multiple reversible cerebral lesions in an attack of acute intermittent porphyria. A 20-year-old woman had an attack of acute intermittent porphyria (AIP) with seizures and hallucinations. MRI revealed multiple lesions in both hemispheres. Both the cerebral clinical abnormalities and the MRI lesions resolved following treatment. These findings suggest that a vascular mechanism may underlie the pathogenesis of cerebral dysfunction in AIP. 
Detection of breast cancer. Routine screening has been shown to reduce the mortality from breast cancer in asymptomatic women. All women should be instructed in breast self-examination, and should begin a program of screening mammography and breast physical examination on an annual basis beginning at the age of 40. Most early breast cancers can be adequately treated without ablative surgery. 
Case report of a coronary anomaly: crossing obtuse marginal arteries. We present a coronary anomaly of crossing obtuse marginal branches of the left circumflex coronary artery which has not been seen in our laboratory or previously reported. Recognition of anomalous intramyocardial branches of the circumflex artery was important to avoid confusion with branches of the left anterior descending artery in conventional angiographic views and was clinically important as well. Intramyocardial vessels may not be easily bypassed surgically, and therefore angioplasty may be a better therapeutic option. 
Plasma lipid transfer protein as a determinant of the atherogenicity of monkey plasma lipoproteins. This study was undertaken to determine potential tissue sources of plasma cholesteryl ester transfer protein (CETP), and to assess the influence of CETP on lipoprotein concentrations and atherosclerosis. In a group of 28 cynomolgus monkeys fed high fat, high cholesterol diets, plasma CETP concentration was strongly correlated with the abundance of CETP mRNA in liver and in adipose tissue, and with the output of CETP in liver perfusates. Plasma CETP concentration showed a strong inverse correlation with HDL cholesterol concentrations (r = -0.62, P less than 0.001) and a positive correlation with LDL cholesterol concentration (r = 0.54, P less than 0.005) and molecular weight (r = 0.57, P less than 0.001). The extent of coronary artery atherosclerosis was positively correlated with LDL cholesterol concentration and molecular weight, and with plasma CETP concentration. Thus, in monkeys fed an atherogenic diet, individual variation in CETP mRNA abundance in liver and adipose tissue probably plays a major role in the determination of plasma CETP levels. In plasma, CETP influences the distribution of cholesteryl esters between LDL and HDL, and CETP concentration appears to be a key determinant of the relative atherogenicity of the plasma lipoproteins. 
Chronic venous insufficiency in primary varicose veins evaluated by plethysmographic technique. Venous hemodynamics were evaluated by plethysmography in normal subjects and patients with venous disorders of the lower extremity, to clarify the pathophysiology of chronic venous insufficiency (CVI) due to primary varicose veins. Expelled volume during five active dorsiflexions of the feet and venous recovery time were calculated to evaluate muscle pump efficiency and valvular competence. Limbs with CVI due to primary varicose veins showed a higher expelled volume and a more shortened refilling time than limbs with simple varicosities. With application of tourniquets, the refilling time normalized in limbs with CVI, as well as in limbs with simple varicosities. These results indicate that a high degree of venous congestion in the distal part of the calf and valvular incompetence of the superficial vein system might cause CVI due to primary varicose veins. 
Spontaneous common iliac arteriovenous fistula manifested by acute renal failure: a case report. Arteriovenous fistulas between the common iliac vessels resulting from spontaneous rupture of aneurysms are rare, with only 31 cases having been reported since 1971. Clinical diagnosis is possible when a unique set of findings is present, namely high-output cardiac failure, a pulsatile abdominal mass associated with a bruit or thrill, and unilateral arterial insufficiency or venous engorgement. Recently, with advancements in diagnostic techniques, the number of cases in which an arteriovenous fistula is found between the common iliac vessels has increased. Diagnosis can be difficult, however, as in the case of one of our patients in whom the predominant sign was acute renal failure. Other reports of renal failure or impairment in the presence of a common iliac fistula have also appeared. Awareness of this phenomenon can help the physician to establish the diagnosis when one or more of the classic signs are absent. Prompt diagnosis and surgical management have contributed to the high incidence of survival in patients with arteriovenous fistulas between the common iliac vessels. 
Management of the recalcitrant total-hip arthroplasty wound. The infection rate for total-hip arthroplasty is around 1 percent. This small group is usually managed by complete removal of the prosthesis and the cement and closure over suction catheters to "collapse" the wound and eventually achieve a girdlestone arthroplasty. Occasionally, there are patients who have a persistent draining wound after this treatment and repeated efforts at wound closure. We present 27 patients who had recalcitrant, noncollapsible wounds of the hip that were present for many months to years. Twenty-eight cases of infected total-hip arthroplasties that did not respond to removal of the prosthesis and cement and closure were seen by the authors between January of 1977 and December of 1988. One patient had bilateral involvement. Average age was 64 years (range 33 to 79 years). There was an average of 4.2 previous surgical attempts at closure (range 1 to 21). Staphylococcus aureus was the most common organism, but the infections were virtually all multiple. Thirty-three muscles were utilized in 27 patients. The rectus femoris was used in 23 cases, the vastus lateralis in 8, tensor fasciae latae in 1, and combined latissimus dorsi-serratus anterior free-tissue transfers were carried out in 2. Multiple combinations of transpositions and free flaps were utilized. Follow-up ranged from 1 to 10 years, with an average of 6.4 years. Eighteen patients were ambulatory with minor degrees of pain, five ambulated with a cane, seven ambulated with a walker, six ambulated with crutches, and four ambulated unassisted, all of whom had reimplantation of their hip arthroplasty at least 12 months following the muscle flap procedure. 
Effect of meal on the physiological and physicochemical actions of potassium citrate. The effect of meals on the physiological and physicochemical actions of potassium citrate was examined in 8 patients with nephrolithiasis maintained on a constant metabolic dietary regimen. Potassium citrate (20 mEq. 3 times per day), whether given with food or on an empty stomach, significantly increased urinary pH, citrate and potassium, and decreased urinary calcium and ammonium. Moreover, potassium citrate decreased urinary saturation of calcium oxalate and uric acid, although it slightly increased that of brushite. However, there was no significant difference in these measures when the drug was given with meals from the time when it was given on an empty stomach. Thus, the effect of potassium citrate on urinary risk factors is unaffected by food. 
cis-platinum ototoxicity in children. Despite the recognized ototoxicity of cis-platinum, a clinical outline for the audiologic evaluation of patients receiving this drug has not been clearly defined. In a practical approach to this problem, the audiograms of 48 pediatric patients referred for monitoring during planned cis-platinum therapy were reviewed. Eleven patients tested with auditory brain-stem response (ABR) audiometry demonstrated several limitations of this modality. Fourteen children underwent initial ABR testing followed by at least two pure-tone audiograms. The remaining 23 patients had their hearing evaluated by pure-tone audiometry only. Various factors such as patient age, cis-platinum dosage, and cranial radiation exposure were analyzed for apparent effect. Younger patients tended to be more susceptible to audiologic changes with the administration of cis-platinum. The proportion of patients who demonstrated a hearing loss increased with successive dosing as did the severity of the hearing loss. Prior exposure to cranial radiation was strongly linked to the development of hearing loss following cis-platinum therapy. Guidelines are presented regarding the use of clinical audiometry in the screening of these pediatric oncology patients. 
Undifferentiated carcinoma of the endometrium. A histopathologic and clinical study of 31 cases. A histopathologic review of 1985 cases of endometrial carcinoma yielded 31 undifferentiated carcinomas (1.6%). Forty-eight percent were large cell type and 52%, intermediate/small cell type. Twenty-one tumors were examined immunohistochemically. All stained for keratin. Eleven tumors reacted with vimentin antibodies, two with carcinoembryonic antigen antibodies, and ten with neuron-specific enolase (NSE) antibodies (four of which stained for bombesin, two for beta-endorphin, one for prealbumin, five for Leu7, and four for synaptophysin). The mean age at diagnosis was 63.9 years (range, 45 to 86). The crude 5-year and 10-year survival was 58% and 48%, respectively. Seventy-nine percent of the patients in surgicopathologic Stage I and 33% in Stage II survived 5 years. The intermediate/small cell types had a somewhat better prognosis than the large cell type, but the difference was not statistically significant. The presence or absence of NSE and vimentin immunoreactivity had no influence on survival. All patients with tumors infiltrating less than one half of the myometrium survived 5 years in contrast with 46% of the patients with deep infiltrating tumors. Fifty-four percent of the patients with demonstrable vessel invasion survived 5 years in contrast with 89% not so affected. 
Differential effect of recombinant tissue plasminogen activator-induced thrombolysis in the central nervous system and systemic arteries. Recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (rTPA) has been more effective in inducing thrombolysis in laboratory studies of intracranial thrombosis than clinical studies of systemic or coronary thrombosis would indicate. To evaluate this discrepancy, 21 rabbits were subjected to embolic occlusion of the right internal carotid artery (ICA) by retrograde injection of a tin-tagged, 2-hour-old autologous clot through the external carotid artery with angiographic monitoring in the same manner as in a previously reported model. The emboli lodged intracranially at the bifurcation of the ICA in 10 animals and in the cervical ICA in 11 animals. Digital subtraction angiography confirmed total occlusion of the ICA in all animals. Treatment started one-half hour after embolization and consisted of a bolus of 0.5 mg/kg of rTPA followed by an infusion of 1 mg/kg/h for 2 hours. All of the animals with intracranial emboli and 6 of the animals with cervical emboli were treated intravenously. The remaining 5 animals with cervical emboli were treated by intracarotid infusion of the same dose of rTPA. In the intravenously treated group, serial digital subtraction angiography documented thrombolysis in 9 of the 10 animals with intracranial emboli and only 1 of the 6 with cervical emboli. Thrombolysis occurred in 4 of the 5 rabbits with cervical emboli treated with intracarotid rTPA. Intravenous rTPA therapy produced a significantly (P less than 0.01) higher rate of thrombolysis in intracranial as compared to cervical thrombus. 
Cognitive development of children following early repair of transposition of the great arteries using deep hypothermic circulatory arrest. Twenty-eight children who underwent corrective cardiac surgery in early infancy had developmental evaluations to explore whether cardiopulmonary bypass perfusion variables are associated with later cognitive function. All had transposition of the great arteries repaired by the arterial switch operation using deep hypothermic circulatory arrest. The mean duration of deep hypothermic circulatory arrest was 64 +/- 10 minutes (mean +/- SD). Median age at repair was 4 days (range 1 to 125 days). Tests of development were administered at age 7 to 53 months: Bayley Scales for children younger than 30 months of age (n = 18) and McCarthy Scales for older children (n = 10). Overall cognitive development score was 101.2 +/- 11.1. Duration of deep hypothermic circulatory arrest was not associated with performance. However, for core cooling periods of less than 20 minutes' duration, shorter cooling periods were associated with lower scores (r = .85, n = 11, P less than .001). These data suggest that patients undergoing relatively long periods of deep hypothermic circulatory arrest may require some minimum time of cardiopulmonary bypass cooling to avoid central nervous system injury. 
Appendicitis. Improvements in diagnosis and treatment. The results of therapy in cases of suspected acute appendicitis were reviewed in 844 consecutive cases of appendicitis occurring over a 3-year period. A diagnostic accuracy of 87.4 per cent was found as well as a perforation rate of 18.4 per cent. Complication rates varied with the clinical state of the appendix: 16 per cent in perforated, 5.6 per cent in nonperforated, and 11.3 per cent in normal appendices. Excellent results were routinely obtainable employing early operative intervention, perioperative antibiotics, and a systematic surgical approach. 
Evaluation of a structured treatment and teaching programme on asthma. The objective of this study was to evaluate a structured treatment and teaching programme for adult patients with moderate to severe asthma. The design consisted of a prospective, before-after trial: the same consecutive patients were studied before and after intervention with observation periods 1 year before and 1 year after intervention. The investigation took place within a tertiary care centre (university hospital). A total of 142 consecutive patients were referred for in-patient treatment of their asthma, of whom 132 (93%) patients participated in the follow-up examination. The intervention consisted of a structured 5-d in-patient treatment and teaching programme presented by a specialized nurse educator. The aim of the programme was for the patient to assume greater responsibility for disease management, including self-monitoring of peak expiratory flow and qualified self-adaptation of drug therapy. The main outcome measures were the frequency of severe asthma attacks, hospitalization, and absenteeism from work (data provided by health insurance companies), patients' compliance and management skills. During the year before and the year after the intervention 71% and 36%, respectively of patients had one or more severe asthma attacks (mean difference 35%, 95% CI: 25-45%, P less than 0.0001). The percentage of patients who were hospitalized because of asthma decreased from 39% to 22% (mean difference 17%, 95% CI: 7-27%, P less than 0.002). The percentage of employed patients (n = 67) who were absent from work because of asthma decreased from 60% to 43% (mean difference 17%, 95% CI: 4-30%, P less than 0.04). The patients' adherence to maintenance drug therapy and their management skills improved significantly. It was concluded that the participation of patients with moderate to severe asthma in a structured treatment and teaching programme resulted in a substantial reduction in asthma morbidity in the year following the intervention. 
Decreasing severity of chronic uveitis in children with pauciarticular arthritis. We compared the current prevalence and severity of chronic uveitis in children with pauciarticular juvenile rheumatoid arthritis in Seattle, Wash, with that of children with the same condition in the same area in 1975. The prevalence of eye disease decreased from 45% in 1975 to 13% in 1989, and the proportion of patients with severe visual loss decreased from 21% in 1975 to none in 1989. We could not attribute these findings to differences in known risk factors for iritis, such as age, sex, or presence of antinuclear antibodies. There was no difference in the duration of follow-up between the two groups. It is possible that the decline in prevalence of uveitis reflects a referral bias for eye disease in the 1975 population. However, the decrease in disease severity remains unexplained and may represent more effective treatment, earlier surveillance for ocular disease, or a change in the frequency of ocular manifestations of this disease in the 1989 group. 
Angiofibromas of the postnasal space: a critical appraisal of various therapeutic modalities. Angiofibromas of the postnasal space are an enigma to the treating surgeon in view of their extensions around the skull base. The availability of modern investigative procedures has to some extent facilitated the decision making process in choosing a suitable surgical approach. Proper tumour staging and the earliest and widest possible exposure tailored to the needs of the specific situation together with adequate blood replacement is the key to success in minimizing the chances of the recurrence. The present study aims at an evaluation of the methodology adopted in 100 serial cases of angiofibromas of the postnasal space. After initial surgery, a further 31 procedures were needed for the management of recurrences. 
Outcome after major dissection during coronary angioplasty using the perfusion balloon catheter. Coronary artery dissection is an infrequent but serious complication of coronary angioplasty that can lead to periprocedural vessel occlusion, emergency bypass surgery, myocardial infarction or death. Recently, a perfusion balloon catheter was developed that permits passive perfusion of blood through the central lumen of the catheter. It enables prolonged balloon inflations to be performed and has been used to provide distal blood flow after coronary occlusion. To evaluate the effectiveness of the perfusion balloon catheter in patients with major coronary dissections, 36 consecutive patients treated with the perfusion balloon catheter were compared with 46 consecutive patients treated before its availability. The 2 groups were similar in terms of clinical, angiographic and initial procedural characteristics. Use of the perfusion balloon catheter permitted a significantly longer inflation than standard balloon inflation (average 18 +/- 5 min). Angiographic success was significantly greater with the perfusion balloon catheter (84 vs 62% for conventional therapy), whereas complications were markedly reduced (48 vs 78%). With the perfusion balloon catheter there were fewer deaths (2 vs 6%), myocardial infarctions (14 vs 40%) and emergency bypass operations (11 vs 25%). The findings of this retrospective comparison demonstrate that the perfusion balloon catheter is effective for the management of major dissections after coronary angioplasty. The use of the perfusion balloon catheter should be considered when a major coronary dissection occurs and when emergency bypass surgery is contemplated. 
Early clinical experience with the transverse colon-gastric tube continent urinary reservoir. The clinical results of the first 4 patients undergoing reconstruction with the transverse colon-gastric tube urinary reservoir are presented. All patients had a minimum 1-year follow-up. All 4 patients are continent with stable or improved renal function. Two patients required reoperation. Indications as well as possible modifications of this procedure are discussed. 
Arterial chemoreceptor input to respiratory hypoglossal motoneurons. To better understand the role of the arterial chemoreceptors in the regulation of upper airway patency at the level of the oropharynx, intracellular recordings were obtained from inspiratory hypoglossal motoneurons (IHMs), and the responses to selective activation of the carotid body chemoreceptors were examined. In pentobarbital-anesthetized, vagotomized, paralyzed, and artificially ventilated cats, chemoreceptor activation enhanced the inspiratory depolarization of membrane potential in 32 of 36 IHMs. This was manifested as an increase in either the amplitude (n = 13) or duration (n = 3) or an increase in both amplitude and duration (n = 16) of the inspiratory membrane potential depolarization. The amplitude and duration of the inspiratory membrane potential depolarization increased 98 +/- 15% (n = 29) and 78 +/- 13% (n = 19), respectively. Similar patterns of enhanced activity (increased duration and/or amplitude of membrane depolarization) were observed in five expiratory hypoglossal motoneurons (EHMs) after chemoreceptor activation. In 16 of the 32 IHMs, chemoreceptor activation also evoked changes in IHM membrane potential during expiration: enhanced post-inspiratory discharge (n = 6), expiratory depolarization/discharge (n = 6), and tonic depolarization/discharge, which persisted for several respiratory cycles (n = 4). The arterial chemoreceptors provide a powerful excitatory input to IHMs during both inspiration and expiration. This excitatory drive to IHMs and EHMs will aid in the maintenance of upper airway patency throughout the respiratory cycle during increases in end-tidal CO2. 
Upper abdominal cancer surgery in the very elderly. From January 1981 to December 1987, 59 major upper abdominal operations were performed on 57 patients aged 80 to 90 years at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center. Procedures for primary adenocarcinoma of the stomach, distal esophagus, pancreas, or hepatobiliary system were performed with curative intent or for palliation in 34 of 59 patients (58%) and bypass with limited or no resection in 13 of 59 patients (22%) patients. Emergency operations were performed in six (10%) patients for gastric bleeding, perforation, or outlet obstruction. Six (10%) patients underwent laparotomy for benign biliary obstruction (1), splenectomy for secondary thrombocytopenia (2), or gastrectomy for sarcoma (2) or lymphoma (1). Hospital mortality was 15% overall and 9% for major resections, 15% for bypass, and 67% for emergency procedures. Major complications occurred in 10 (20%) elective procedures. Mortality was associated with respiratory or cardiac failure while complications most commonly included arrhythmias and wound infection. Mean postoperative hospitalization was 18 days overall and 45 patients (76%) were discharged home. Median survival following major resection was 17.5 months but less than 2 months after bypass procedures. A protocol of pre-operative evaluation, intra-operative hemodynamic monitoring and postoperative intensive care has been formalized for use in elderly or poor-risk patients. 
Cytokine-endothelial interactions in inflammation, immunity, and vascular injury. This paper reviews the evidence that cytokines induce a variety of functional and structural alterations in endothelium and that cytokine-endothelial interactions play important roles in the evolution of inflammatory and immune responses. The effect of cytokines, particularly interleukin-1 and tumor necrosis factor, on leukocyte-endothelial adhesion has led to the discovery of several endothelial adhesion molecules, and the molecular and biological characteristics of these are described. Finally, the review discusses the possible contribution of cytokine-induced activation to vascular injury in such pathological processes as septic shock, the Shwartzman reaction, delayed hypersensitivity, and immune-mediated vasculitis. 
The Dubbo study of the health of elderly: correlates of coronary heart disease at study entry. A prospective study of the health of elderly Australians recently commenced in Dubbo, NSW, the study population comprising 1,237 males and 1,568 females 60 years and older. The prevalence rates of coronary heart disease (CHD) and its associated risk factors have been examined in the baseline data. The age-standardized rate of CHD was 23.8/100 in males and 18.1/100 in females. The prevalence rate increased with age until 79 years in males, thereafter declining. The rate increased steadily with age in females. In a multiple logistic model, the following possible predictors of CHD were included: age, cigarette smoking, use of alcohol, exercise, religiosity, years of education, hypertension, diabetes, family history of CHD, body mass index, lipid and lipoprotein variables. The presence of CHD in males was significantly predicted by age, hypertension (odds ratio, OR = 1.40), family history (OR = 2.05), and high density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol (OR = 0.78). The significant predictors in females were age, years of education (OR = 0.82), hypertension (OR = 1.45), family history (OR = 1.77), serum triglycerides (OR = 1.30), and HDL cholesterol (OR = 0.73). Hypertension was found to be a stronger predictor of CHD in the younger age group (60-69 years), while diabetes was a predictor of CHD in older males (70-79 years). Our findings require confirmation in the prospective study now in progress. 
General moderate hypothermia in the surgical treatment of descending thoracic aortic aneurysms. The diagnosis and surgical treatment of aneurysms of the descending thoracic aorta is difficult and some aspects of management remain controversial. We report 53 patients treated in the period 1983-1988; 25.9% of them had previously been erroneously diagnosed as having mediastinal cysts or tumours. Duplex scanning and computerised tomography were valuable adjuncts in establishing the correct diagnosis, which was confirmed by aortography in 52 patients. Of 49 patients operated upon electively three died with a mortality rate of 6.1%; of the 4 patients operated upon as emergencies 2 died. Fifty patients survived the operative procedure and of the 3 operated upon under normothermia 1 developed paraplegia, whereas of the 47 patients operated upon under moderate hypothermia (30 degrees-31 degrees C) only 1 developed paraplegia. 
Magnetic resonance imaging for calf deep venous thrombophlebitis. STUDY OBJECTIVE: To compare magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the calf with venography for patients with suspected calf deep venous thrombophlebitis (DVT). DESIGN: Ten consecutive adult patients with suspected calf DVT received venography and, within 48 hours, MRI scans. The tests were reviewed blindly by two radiologists, and results of the tests were compared. SETTING: The emergency department of a large teaching hospital with an annual census of 60,000 patients. MAIN RESULTS: All patients with negative venograms had no suggestion of DVT on MRI scan. Two of these patients had other significant demonstrable abnormalities. Four of the five patients with positive venograms had positive calf MRI scans. One patient with a venogram that was difficult to interpret had no DVT on MRI. A thigh DVT was seen on his venogram and was suggested by MRI findings. CONCLUSION: MRI may replace ascending venography as the standard for diagnosis of calf DVT. 
Superoxide dismutase decreases mortality, blood pressure, and cerebral blood flow responses induced by acute hypertension in rats. Oxygen radicals are known to be produced by the cerebral vasculature during acute, pressor-induced hypertension and are also known to inactivate endothelium-derived relaxing factor. The objective of our present study was to determine if the oxygen radical scavenger superoxide dismutase (24,000 units/kg plus 1,600 units/kg/min) alters the pressor, cerebral blood flow, and mortality responses to systemic norepinephrine in rats. Increasing doses (0.01-30 micrograms/kg i.v.) of norepinephrine were given by bolus injection to eight rats, and changes in the cortical microcirculatory blood flow were measured by laser-Doppler flowmetry. Superoxide dismutase shifted the norepinephrine-blood pressure and -cerebral blood flow dose-response curves moderately, but significantly, to the right such that it took more norepinephrine to reach a given blood pressure. However, superoxide dismutase had no effect on the autoregulation of cerebral blood flow. Additionally, whereas five (63%) of the eight control rats died after the 10 micrograms/kg norepinephrine dose, all eight rats treated with superoxide dismutase survived this dose. The mechanism by which superoxide dismutase reduced mortality is uncertain. The blood pressure and cerebral blood flow results suggest that superoxide dismutase prevents oxygen radicals from destroying endothelium-derived relaxing factors, which reduce the pressor effects of norepinephrine. 
Nasopharyngeal flora in the first three years of life in normal and otitis-prone children. Nasopharyngeal carriage of the three major middle ear pathogens (Streptococcus pneumoniae, nontypeable Hemophilus influenzae, and Moraxella catarrhalis) was evaluated prospectively in a group of 110 children followed up for the first 3 years of life. The findings suggested that nasopharyngeal carriage of middle ear pathogens increases significantly during respiratory illness among the general population of young children; however, otitis-prone children demonstrated a tendency to carry nontypeable H influenzae at an unusually high rate even during health. This propensity to carry nontypeable H influenzae might explain why nontypeable H influenzae is a major cause of recurrent or chronic otitis media. 
Isolated T-wave abnormalities and evaluation of left ventricular wall motion after nifedipine for severe hypertension. Rapid reduction of blood pressure by vasodilators in severe hypertensives has been associated with T-wave inversion. The significance of these changes in the absence of chest pain or other manifestations of ischemia is not known. To determine if these T-wave inversions are due to myocardial ischemia, we obtained electrocardiograms and left ventricular wall motion studies (2-D echocardiography) before and 1 h after rapid blood pressure reduction with nifedipine in 23 severe hypertensives. One hour after 10 mg nifedipine blood pressure was markedly reduced from 189 +/- 6/117 +/- 3 (mean +/- SE) to 151 +/- 5/91 +/- 3 mm Hg (P less than .001). New T-wave inversions developed in 6 of 23 (26%) subjects, but blinded evaluation of 2-D echocardiograms revealed no new wall motion abnormalities. Wall motion score, which at pretreatment was abnormal in 11 of 23 patients, improved significantly after nifedipine from 1.4 +/- 0.1 to 1.2 +/- 0.1 (P less than .05). Therefore, rapid and marked reduction of blood pressure with nifedipine is accompanied by a high incidence of asymptomatic T-wave inversions which are not accompanied by left ventricular wall motion abnormalities, suggesting that significant myocardial ischemia did not occur. 
Pharyngeal ulceration in AIDS patients secondary to cytomegalovirus infection. Cytomegalovirus (CMV) infections in patients with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome are common and may present as retinitis, encephalitis, esophagitis, gastritis, enterocolitis, adrenalitis, or pneumonitis. Three patients are presented with pharyngeal ulcerations secondary to CMV. Similar cases have not been previously described in the literature. Symptoms, physical findings, and the treatment of this clinical entity are discussed. Although pharyngeal CMV ulcers are not life-threatening, they may herald multisystemic CMV infection that may require prompt antiviral chemotherapy. 
Electrophysiologic effects and clinical hazards of carbamazepine treatment for neurologic disorders in patients with abnormalities of the cardiac conduction system. Carbamazepine, a first-line drug for the treatment of epilepsy and neuralgia, may exert hazardous effects on the cardiac conduction system. Standard ECG and long-term ECG monitoring and invasive electrophysiologic testing were carried out in 10 patients who required this drug for neurologic disorders, but in whom its safe use had been questioned because of symptoms of ECG abnormalities. We observed depression of sinus node function and an atrioventricular conduction delay with a significant prolongation of the PQ interval of 16 msec (9%; 95% confidence interval: 1.9% to 16.5%; p less than 0.05), of which the HV interval was significantly prolonged but not the PA and AH intervals. These effects are in accordance with previously shown class 1A properties. However, the lack of effects on QRS, JT, and QT intervals at normal heart rates is a class 1B characteristic. Thus carbamazepine seems to have composite electropharmacologic actions. A cause effect relationship between carbamazepine treatment and significant arrhythmias was established in five patients. Thus the negative chronotropic and dromotropic effects of carbamazepine may, at least in predisposed patients, induce symptoms confusingly similar to the epileptic seizures it is used to prevent. 
More accurate diagnosis of irritable bowel syndrome by the use of 'non-colonic' symptomatology. The criteria now used in an attempt to distinguish irritable bowel syndrome from organic gastrointestinal disease rely almost entirely on symptoms of colonic origin. 'Non-colonic' symptoms, however, arising either from elsewhere in the gut or of a more general nature, are common in irritable bowel syndrome and may have even better diagnostic potential. The prevalence of these non-colonic features was assessed in 107 patients with the irritable bowel syndrome and 295 subjects with other gut disorders. Gastrointestinal type non-colonic symptoms are useful in differentiating irritable bowel syndrome from inflammatory bowel disease but, with the exception of early satiety, are not helpful when there is gastro-oesophageal or biliary disease. More general 'non-colonic' features, such as lethargy and backache, are much commoner in irritable bowel syndrome than in all the organic gastrointestinal diseases studied and have good discriminant function. Multiple logistic regression analysis identified certain features that had a particularly significant independent risk for irritable bowel syndrome. Those were lethargy (relative risk 6.7), incomplete evacuation (RR 5.2), age under 40 (RR 2.1), backache (RR 2.0), early satiety (RR 1.8), and frequency of micturition (RR 1.8). These relative risks can be multiplied together to give an overall risk when more than one of these features is present in a patient. Until a diagnostic test is available more confident diagnosis of irritable bowel syndrome can be achieved by identifying symptoms that have good discriminant function. The results of this study indicate that the non-colonic features of irritable bowel syndrome may be especially valuable in this respect. 
Factors influencing admission blood pressure levels in patients with acute stroke. In clinical practice, patients with acute stroke often have high blood pressure. The aim of this study was to investigate factors correlated with blood pressure elevation in 843 consecutive stroke patients on hospital admission to a nonintensive stroke unit. Using a multivariate analysis model, we analyzed the influence on admission blood pressure of sex, age, previous hypertension, cardiac failure, diabetes, type of stroke, impaired consciousness, and latency between onset of symptoms and admission. Previous hypertension was the strongest predictor (p less than 0.001) of elevated blood pressure on admission, followed by the presence of intracerebral hemorrhage (p less than 0.001). The latency between onset of symptoms and admission showed no correlation with blood pressure levels at hospitalization. Previously, high blood pressure levels on hospital admission have been shown to decline within a few days in hospital. We therefore hypothesize that mental stress on hospital admission may be a major factor in the blood pressure elevation seen in acute stroke. 
Antiemetic efficacy of ondansetron after outpatient laparoscopy. The safety and efficacy of ondansetron were evaluated for the treatment of postoperative nausea and vomiting after laparoscopic surgical procedures. Seventy-one healthy, consenting outpatients were randomly assigned to one of two treatment groups according to a double-blind, placebo-controlled protocol. A standardized anesthetic technique consisting of alfentanil-thiopental-succinylcholine for induction and alfentanil-nitrous oxide-succinylcholine for maintenance of anesthesia was used. Patients in whom postoperative nausea and/or vomiting developed and persisted for greater than or equal to 10 min received equivolemic intravenous injections of either ondansetron (8 mg) or saline (placebo) over a 2-5 min period. Ondansetron significantly decreased the posttreatment nausea scores (vs placebo) without increasing sedation or producing changes in cardiorespiratory parameters. In the placebo-treated group, 92% of the patients experienced subsequent episodes of vomiting in the postanesthesia care unit compared with 51% of the patients in the ondansetron group. Finally, only 43% of the ondansetron-treated patients required a "rescue" antiemetic compared with 86% in the placebo group. Thus, ondansetron (8 mg IV) was associated with a decreased incidence of nausea and vomiting after outpatient laparoscopic procedures. 
Malignant renal tumors in tuberous sclerosis. Although the frequency of renal carcinoma in tuberous sclerosis is lower than that in von Hippel-Lindau syndrome, it occurs bilaterally in 43 percent of patients at a median age of twenty-eight years. Concomitant hamartomas and hyperplastic cystic components may confound the histologic diagnosis of renal carcinoma in tuberous sclerosis. 
Antihypertensive therapy and atherosclerosis. Hypertension and atherosclerosis make independent contributions to the pathogenesis of cardiovascular disease. Diuretics and beta adrenergic blockers, effective antihypertensive medications, exhibit some untoward effects on lipid metabolism, while most other antihypertensive medications tend not to exhibit such effects. In animal models, beta adrenergic blockers, angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, and calcium antagonists have anti-atherogenic effects. A vascular biological approach to therapy for the patient with both hypertension and atherosclerosis is recommended. This includes effective reduction of blood pressure--preferably with agents that do not adversely affect lipid metabolism--and treatment of lipid metabolism disorders. 
Detection of aneuploidy involving chromosomes 13, 18, or 21, by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) to interphase and metaphase amniocytes. Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) with chromosome-specific probes has been applied to detection of numerical aberrations involving chromosomes 13, 18, and 21 in metaphase and interphase amniocytes. High-complexity, composite probes for chromosomes 13, 18, and 21 were used as hybridization probes for this study. These probes were constructed as chromosome-specific libraries in Bluescribe plasmids and are designated pBS-13, pBS-18, and pBS-21. Elements of these probes bind at numerous sites along the target chromosome and, when detected fluorescently, stain essentially the entire long arm of the target chromosome. The target chromosome number (i.e., the number of chromosomes of the type for which the probe was specific) was correctly determined in 20 of 20 samples in which metaphase spreads were analyzed and in 43 of 43 samples in which interphase nuclei were analyzed; all of these studies were conducted in blind fashion. These results suggest the utility of FISH with composite probes for rapid detection of numerical aberrations in metaphase and interphase amniotic cells. 
Cell adhesion molecules and the regulation of development. Cell adhesion molecules, in conjunction with the other morphoregulatory molecules, substrate adhesion molecules and cell junctional molecules, are dynamically expressed in coordinate patterns throughout development. Their activities are linked to a variety of cellular processes, and their ability to influence mechanochemical processes allows them to influence a variety of other fundamental developmental events. The clinical significance of these molecules remains to be determined, but they are clearly involved in a number of pathologic conditions and could become the focus of a wide range of diagnostic techniques and eventually even therapeutic designs. 
Enalapril prevents cardiac fibrosis and arrhythmias in hypertensive rats. To evaluate the effects of hypertension on cardiac hypertrophy, on myocardial structure, and on ventricular arrhythmias, 27 3-month-old spontaneously hypertensive rats were treated with enalapril (10 mg/kg) daily for 11 months and compared with 26 untreated control rats. Systolic arterial pressure was significantly decreased in treated rats, and at the end of the experiment, it was 199 +/- 3 mm Hg (treated) versus 237 +/- 3 mm Hg (controls) (p less than 0.001). At this time, spontaneous arrhythmias and induced arrhythmias either by programmed electrical stimulation (train of stimuli +1 or 2 extrastimuli) or by trains of eight stimuli at decreasing coupling intervals were observed in isolated heart preparations. Comparing enalapril-treated and control rats, spontaneous arrhythmias (9 of 27 versus 20 of 26, respectively; p less than 0.01), programmed stimulation-induced arrhythmias (3 of 26 versus 12 of 23, respectively; p less than 0.01), and trains of stimuli-induced arrhythmias (4 of 26 versus 14 of 19, respectively, p less than 0.001) were less frequent in the enalapril group. Left ventricular weight was decreased in treated rats by 18% (p less than 0.001). Enalapril administration diminished the fraction of myocardium occupied by foci of replacement fibrosis normally occurring in control rats by 59% (p less than 0.001). Finally, a significant correlation was found between left ventricular weight, the extent of myocardial fibrosis, and the occurrence of ventricular fibrillation. It was concluded that chronic treatment with enalapril, which resulted in attenuation of systemic arterial pressure by limiting cardiac hypertrophy and myocardial fibrosis, decreases the propensity of the heart of hypertensive rats to arrhythmogenesis. 
The personality pattern of duodenal ulcer patients in relation to spontaneous ulcer healing and relapse. One hundred consecutive out-patients with duodenal ulceration from a hospital and a gastroenterological clinic were tested with the Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory (MMPI). This was carried out in order to investigate whether neuroticism or other personality disorders were characteristics of duodenal ulcer patients, and whether the presence of such possible personality disorders might influence the prognosis of the disease. Neuroticism occurred in 53% of the patients, but only in 5% of controls (P less than 0.0001). Overall, personality disorders were present in 69% of the patients compared with 30% of the controls (P less than 0.0001). Neuroticism was connected with a high frequency of relapse (P less than 0.05) whereas failure of spontaneous ulcer healing had no certain relation to personality disorders. Patients with non-neurotic personality disorders had more frequently suffered stressful life events before entrance to the study (P less than 0.05) and, like the neurotic patients, they had lower ego-strength to cope with such events (P less than 0.05). The results indicate that personality assessments make it possible to distinguish between subgroups of duodenal ulcer patients with different course of the disease. 
Patient and technique survival for blind and sighted diabetics on continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis: a ten-year analysis. A retrospective analysis of patient and technique survival over 10 years in a group of 66 diabetics (40 being blind) and 71 non-diabetics was undertaken. Patient survival profiles showed that the blind diabetics lived longer than the sighted, but for a shorter time than the nondiabetics. In technique success, the sighted diabetics out did the blind and the non-diabetics, long term. Short term, the blind performed better than sighted diabetics. The key to success and longer survival on CAPD depended on motivation on the part of the patient, patient's acceptance of given disability, family (social) support, and willingness on the part of renal care personnel to train the disabled diabetic to perform CAPD. With adequate education and support, blind diabetics did CAPD as well as sighted patients. There was no increased frequency of peritonitis in blind diabetics compared to sighted diabetics. Both blind diabetics and non-diabetics had fewer episodes than sighted diabetics. Intraperitoneal route of insulin administration achieved good glycemic control in diabetic population. Refractory congestive cardiac failure and/or fatal arrhythmias was the most common cardiac cause of death in diabetics on CAPD. 
Effect of combinations of cytokines and hormones on synthesis of serum amyloid A and C-reactive protein in Hep 3B cells. We have previously shown that induction of synthesis of the two major human acute phase proteins, serum amyloid A (SAA) and C-reactive protein (CRP), can be accomplished in the human hepatoma cell line Hep 3B, in the presence of dexamethasone, either by conditioned medium from LPS-stimulated monocytes or by the combination of IL-6 and IL-1. Neither of these cytokines alone caused significant induction of either SAA or CRP. In the present study we extended our earlier observations by evaluating the role of dexamethasone, the effect of different concentrations of IL-6 and IL-1 alpha in combination, and the possible role of TNF-alpha in regulating synthesis of SAA and CRP. Dexamethasone alone had no effect on induction of SAA or CRP. Incubation of Hep 3B cells with conditioned medium from LPS-stimulated monocytes, in the absence of dexamethasone, led to modest induction of SAA or CRP, but addition of dexamethasone potentiated this response in a dose-dependent manner. Similar results were obtained for the effect of dexamethasone on the induction of SAA by IL-6 plus IL-1 alpha. Checkerboard titration of IL-6 and IL-1 alpha revealed that increases in concentration of either cytokine led to dose-related increases in synthesis of both SAA and CRP as long as a minimal amount of the other cytokine was present. TNF-alpha alone had no significant effect on synthesis of either SAA or CRP, but the combination of IL-6 plus TNF-alpha led to substantial induction of SAA. This combination was less effective than the combination of IL-6 plus IL-1 alpha. No detectable effect of IL-6 plus TNF-alpha was observed on CRP synthesis. Both combinations of cytokines, IL-6 plus IL-1 alpha, and IL-6 plus TNF-alpha, caused increased SAA mRNA accumulation that roughly paralleled increase in synthesis. These data indicate that IL-6, IL-1 alpha, TNF-alpha, and dexamethasone in various combinations are all capable of influencing synthesis of SAA in Hep 3B cells, whereas only IL-6, IL-1 alpha, and dexamethasone can influence CRP synthesis. 
Balloon dilatation of pacemaker induced stenosis of the superior vena cava. A 53 year old woman with symptomatic pacemaker associated superior vena cava syndrome was treated successfully with balloon angioplasty. She was well six months after the procedure. 
Fine structure mapping of the hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase (HPRT) gene region of the human X chromosome (Xq26). The Xq26-q27 region of the X chromosome is interesting, as an unusually large number of genes and anonymous RFLP probes have been mapped in this area. A number of studies have used classical linkage analysis in families to map this region. Here, we use mutant human T-lymphocyte clones known to be deleted for all or part of the hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase (hprt) gene, to order anonymous probes known to map to Xq26. Fifty-seven T-cell clones were studied, including 44 derived from in vivo mutation and 13 from in vitro irradiated T-lymphocyte cultures. Twenty anonymous probes (DXS10, DXS11, DXS19, DXS37, DXS42, DXS51, DXS53, DXS59, DXS79, DXS86, DXS92, DXS99, DXS100d, DXS102, DXS107, DXS144, DXS172, DXS174, DXS177, and DNF1) were tested for codeletion with the hprt gene by Southern blotting methods. Five of these probes (DXS10, DXS53, DXS79, DXS86 and DXS177) showed codeletion with hprt in some mutants. The mutants established the following unambiguous ordering of the probes relative to the hprt gene: DXS53-DXS79-5'hprt3'-DXS86-DXS10-DXS177 . The centromere appears to map proximal to DXS53. These mappings order several closely linked but previously unordered probes. In addition, these studies indicate that rather large deletions of the functionally haploid X chromosome can occur while still retaining T-cell viability. 
Laparoscopic treatment of painful perihepatic adhesions in Fitz-Hugh-Curtis syndrome. This report illustrates a case of Fitz-Hugh-Curtis syndrome associated with pelvic inflammatory disease in which the clinical symptom of right upper quadrant pain was severe and persistent despite appropriate antibiotic therapy. Because of the atypical course, an extensive work-up was performed to rule out other possible etiologies for the pain. In this context, a laparoscopy was performed and identified dense adhesions between the liver and the anterior abdominal wall. These adhesions were safely and successfully lysed using a KTP/532 laser through a second puncture site. After surgery the pain was completely resolved, with no further recurrence after 6 months of follow-up. 
Inflammatory pseudotumors of the spleen. Inflammatory pseudotumors are uncommon benign lesions that have been found in numerous organ systems. However, their appearance within the spleen is decidedly rare. Grossly, pseudotumors appear as well-circumscribed, encapsulated masses, while microscopic examination reveals a polymorphous inflammatory cell infiltrate occurring variably with granulomatous reaction, fibrosis, and cell necrosis. Because they often present either as unexplained, asymptomatic masses or with vague constitutional symptoms, splenic inflammatory pseudotumors can raise suspicion for a primary splenic neoplasm, such as lymphoma. Splenectomy is the treatment of choice. 
Prognostic significance of atrial fibrillation in advanced heart failure. A study of 390 patients. BACKGROUND. Atrial fibrillation is common in advanced heart failure, but its prognostic significance is controversial. METHODS AND RESULTS. We evaluated the relation of atrial rhythm to overall survival and sudden death in 390 consecutive advanced heart failure patients. Etiology of heart failure was coronary artery disease in 177 patients (45%) and nonischemic cardiomyopathy or valvular heart disease in 213 patients (55%). Mean left ventricular ejection fraction was 0.19 +/- 0.07. Seventy-five patients (19%) had paroxysmal (26 patients) or chronic (49 patients) atrial fibrillation. Compared with patients with sinus rhythm, patients with atrial fibrillation did not differ in etiology of heart failure, mean pulmonary capillary wedge pressure on therapy, or embolic events but were more likely to be receiving warfarin and antiarrhythmic drugs and had a slightly higher left ventricular ejection fraction. After a mean follow-up of 236 +/- 303 days, 98 patients died: 56 (57%) died suddenly, and 36 (37%) died of progressive heart failure. Actuarial 1-year overall survival was 68%, and sudden death-free survival was 79%. Actuarial survival was significantly worse for atrial fibrillation than for sinus rhythm patients (52% versus 71%, p = 0.0013). Similarly, sudden death-free survival was significantly worse for atrial fibrillation than for sinus rhythm patients (69% versus 82%, p = 0.0013). By Cox proportional hazards model, pulmonary capillary wedge pressure on therapy, left ventricular ejection fraction, coronary artery disease, and atrial fibrillation were independent risk factors for total mortality and sudden death. For patients who had pulmonary capillary wedge pressure of less than 16 mm Hg on therapy, atrial fibrillation was associated with poorer 1-year survival (44% versus 83%, p = 0.00001); however, in the high pulmonary capillary wedge pressure group, atrial fibrillation did not confer an increased risk (58% versus 57%). CONCLUSIONS. Atrial fibrillation is a marker for increased risk of death, especially in heart failure patients who have lower filling pressures on vasodilator and diuretic therapy. Whether aggressive attempts to maintain sinus rhythm will reduce this risk is unknown. 
Effect of inhibition of Helicobacter pylori urease activity by acetohydroxamic acid on serum gastrin in duodenal ulcer subjects. The mechanism of the hypergastrinaemia associated with Helicobacter pylori infection is unknown. It may be an effect of the ammonia produced by the bacterium near the antral epithelial surface. We have examined the effect on serum gastrin of inhibiting H pylori urease activity with acetohydroxamic acid in six duodenal ulcer patients. On day 1 the fasted patients received placebo tablets at 8 am, a peptide meal at 10 am, and a 14C urea breath test at 11.30 am. The next day 750 mg acetohydroxamic acid was administered orally in place of the placebo. The median (range) 30 minute breath test value (dose/mmol CO2 X kg body wt X 100) was 152 (111-335) on day 1, but only 22 (14-95) the next day (p less than 0.03). Further studies performed in one subject confirmed that acetohydroxamic acid lowered the ammonium concentration and raised the urea concentration in gastric juice. The inhibition of urease activity and ammonia production did not result in a fall in the basal gastrin concentration or in the median integrated gastrin response to the peptide meal, which was 78 ng/1.h (range 21-222) on day 1 and 79 ng/1.h (33-207) the next day. Ten days after acetohydroxamic acid, the urea breath test values were similar to those before treatment. This study shows that the raised gastrin concentration in patients with H pylori infection is not directly related to the organism's urease activity. It also shows that temporary suppression of H pylori urease activity does not clear the infection. 
Intoxication after an acute dose of alcohol: an assessment of its association with alcohol consumption patterns by using twin data. We examined the hypothesis that genetically determined differences in sensitivity to alcohol explain some of the genetic variation in alcohol consumption pattern. Self-report data on average weekly alcohol consumption and self-ratings of intoxication after a standard dose of ethanol (0.75 g/kg body weight), used as an index of sensitivity, were obtained on 206 Australian twin pairs. Significant genetic covariance between weekly consumption and level of intoxication after alcohol intake was found in males, lower ratings of intoxication being associated with increased consumption. However, when direction of causation models were fitted to the male twin data, the hypothesis that decreased sensitivity was a cause of increased consumption was rejected. The major causal effect was that of weekly consumption on level of sensitivity. A similar, although nonsignificant, trend was observed in females. The strength of the association between self-report of average weekly consumption and level of intoxication after a standard dose of alcohol supports the validity of the former measure. 
Bone mineral density and anorexia nervosa in women. OBJECTIVE: A review of reports of reduced bone mineral density in women with anorexia nervosa was undertaken in order to profile specific risk factors, which could then be used as the basis for suggestions for future research and treatment. METHOD: Thirteen research studies and four case studies of reduced bone mineral density and fractures in women with anorexia nervosa were reviewed. The relationships between bone mineral density and amenorrhea, estrogen, calcium intake, physical activity, parathyroid hormone, alkaline phosphatase, 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D, cortisol, and growth hormone were examined in the reports of these studies and other reports of altered physiology during anorexia nervosa. RESULTS: The average spinal, radial, and femoral bone mineral density in anorexic women was significantly lower than it was in normal control subjects. Concurrent with the low intake of nutrients by individuals with anorexia nervosa, low body weight, early onset and long duration of amenorrhea, low calcium intake, reduced physical activity, and hypercortisolism appeared more likely to contribute to decreased bone mineral density than did other abnormal aspects of the disorder. CONCLUSIONS: Future research needs to address how such factors as amenorrhea and hypercortisolism affect bone mineral density in anorexia nervosa. Since no controlled trials of estrogen replacement or calcium supplementation in anorexia nervosa have been reported, the proper treatment for decreased bone mineral density is not known. However, the most obviously important intervention is to encourage medical stabilization and weight gain. 
Role of acid milieu in the gastroprotective and ulcer-healing activity of sucralfate. Sucralfate prevents the formation of acute gastric lesions induced by various ulcerogens and enhances the healing of chronic gastroduodenal ulcerations, but the mechanism of these effects has not been fully explained. This study was designed to determine the importance of intragastric pH in the sucralfate-induced gastroprotection against 100% ethanol, acidified aspirin, taurocholate, or stress, and in the healing of chronic gastroduodenal ulcerations induced by acetic acid. Sucralfate acidified to pH 2.0 showed significantly stronger protective activity against all four irritants, its protective potency against 100% ethanol being about eight times greater and the duration of the protection about four times longer than those obtained with sucralfate at its pH of 5.0. Pretreatment with indomethacin to suppress mucosal generation of prostaglandin or the removal of salivary glands to eliminate the endogenous source of epidermal growth factor failed to affect sucralfate-induced gastroprotection. In contrast, the rate of healing of chronic gastric ulcerations was significantly delayed by indomethacin or sialoadenectomy; but sucralfate enhanced the healing, and a marked inhibition of gastric acid secretion by ranitidine did not eliminate this enhancement. We conclude that the protective activity of sucralfate depends on the presence of acid milieu in the stomach, but that the ulcer-healing effects of this drug occur even after a marked inhibition of gastric acid secretion. 
The aging process: major risk factor for disease and death. Aging is the accumulation of changes responsible for the sequential alterations that accompany advancing age and the associated progressive increases in the chance of disease and death. Average life expectancies at birth in the developed countries are now approaching plateau values as the aging changes associated with the environment and disease near irreducible levels. The inborn aging process is now the major risk factor for disease and death after around age 28 in the developed countries and limits average life expectancy at birth to approximately 85 years. Future significant increases in average life expectancy--a rough measure of the healthy, productive life-span, i.e., the functional life-span--in these countries will be achieved only by slowing the rate of production of aging changes by the aging process. Many theories have been advanced to account for the aging process. The free radical theory of aging is discussed briefly. The importance attached to increasing the functional life-span dictates that aging hypotheses be explored for practical means of achieving this goal while work continues toward a consensus on the cause(s) of the aging process. Efforts to further increase the functional life-span by conventional measures are now almost futile, whereas those directed toward slowing the aging process are just beginning. These new efforts show promise. 
The effect of food on pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of fenoldopam in class III heart failure. Eighteen patients with New York Heart Association class III congestive heart failure were given single 100 mg oral doses of fenoldopam with food or fasting in a random-order single-blind crossover trial. Before and after each fenoldopam dose, thermodilution cardiac output, right atrial pressure, pulmonary artery pressure, and pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (PCWP) were measured with a balloon-tipped pulmonary artery catheter, and heart rates and blood pressures were recorded with an automated sphygmomanometer. Compared with fasting, bioavailability of fenoldopam was decreased significantly when administered with food: mean peak plasma fenoldopam level decreased from 26.5 (+/- 4.1 SEM) ng/ml to 10.9 (+/- 1.7 SEM) ng/ml (p = 0.0004) and mean area under the concentration-time curve was decreased from 44.7 (+/- 5.8 SEM) ng.hr/ml to 26.8 (+/- 4.1 SEM) ng.hr/ml (p = 0.0001). Fenoldopam administration to fasting patients resulted in decreases in mean arterial pressure, systemic vascular resistance, and PCWP and significant increases in cardiac index without change in heart rate. The maximum changes in mean cardiac index, systemic vascular resistance, and PCWP were greatest 1 hour after oral administration and did not persist beyond 3 hours after administration. In fasting patients, changes in cardiac index were correlated with plasma fenoldopam levels, whereas changes in PCWP and mean arterial pressure did not correlate significantly with the observed fenoldopam level. 
Stage I seminoma of the testis. Adjuvant radiotherapy or surveillance? Lately the role of radiotherapy in stage I seminoma of the testis has been questioned by some authors who reported on a "surveillance" strategy for these patients. Since 1980, 124 patients with seminoma of the testis have been referred to this institution; 97 of 116 patients analysed presented with stage I disease and 10 of these had elevated levels of beta HCG. A total of 64 patients were given radiotherapy after orchiectomy and 33 entered a surveillance protocol. After a median follow-up of 48 months, 3 patients in the surveillance group relapsed after 5, 13 and 49 months and 2 of the irradiated patients did so after 25 and 33 months. Elevation of beta HCG was not significant because none of these patients showed progression. A low rate of progression and excellent survival are associated with standard treatment (orchiectomy and radiotherapy) and good results have been achieved with chemotherapy in cases of relapse. A surveillance policy is not recommended in stage I seminoma because of its slower growth compared with non-seminomatous germ cell tumours (NSGCT), the absence of a specific tumour marker, the 10% risk of occult metastases and the 3-fold higher progression rate compared with irradiated patients. We suggest the use of a reduced dosage and radiation field. 
Effects of isradipine on peripheral hemodynamic reflex responses in mild-to-moderate essential hypertension. In a randomized double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover study of isradipine (5 mg twice daily), effects on peripheral hemodynamic reflex responses were studied in nine patients (mean age 48 years) at baseline and after six weeks of active treatment. Assessments included vital signs, resting blood flow in the calf and finger (using an electrocardiograph-triggered venous occlusion plethysmograph), reflex responses during isometric exercise and cold pressor resistance, and venous capacitance in the forearm and calf. Isradipine lowered systolic and diastolic blood pressure as well as mean arterial pressure in patients with mild-to-moderate essential hypertension without reflex tachycardia or venoconstriction. All of the reflex responses studied were attenuated. It is concluded that vasodilatation of the peripheral circulation induced by isradipine contributes partially to the blood pressure-lowering effect. 
Combined curettage and excision: a treatment method for primary basal cell carcinoma. A retrospective study of 403 primary basal cell carcinomas treated with aggressive curettage followed immediately by excision revealed microscopic tumor present in the curettage margin in 64 (15.9%) of the patients and in the excisional margin in 12 (2.5%) after curettage and excision. In 92% (11 of 12) of patients with persistent tumor after the combined curettage and excision technique the tumors were of the aggressive growth (fibrosing, sclerosing, scirrhous, and morpheaform) variety of basal cell carcinoma. Both lateral and deep margins were involved with tumor. The short-term cure rate was 97.6% for the combined technique. Excluding aggressive growth BCCs, the use of curettage allows the surgeon to define tumor borders better before excision. This proves especially beneficial in tumors with clinically indistinct borders. 
Does plasma cholesterol concentration predict mortality from coronary heart disease in elderly people? 18 year follow up in Whitehall study. OBJECTIVE--To explore the extent to which the relation between plasma cholesterol concentration and risk of death from coronary heart disease in men persists into old age. DESIGN--18 year follow up of male Whitehall civil servants. Plasma cholesterol concentrations and other risk factors were determined at first examination in 1967-9 when they were aged 40-69. Death of men up to 31 January 1987 was recorded. SUBJECTS--18,296 male civil servants, 4155 of whom died during follow up. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES--Cause and age of death. Cholesterol concentration in 1967-9 and number of years elapsed between testing and death. RESULTS--1676 men died of coronary heart disease. The mean cholesterol concentration in these men was 0.32 mmol/l higher than that in all other men (95% confidence interval 0.26 to 0.37 mmol/l). This difference in cholesterol concentrations fell 0.15 mmol/l with every 10 years' increase in age at screening. The risk of raised cholesterol concentration fell with age at death. Compared with other men cholesterol concentration in those who died of coronary heart disease was 0.44 mmol/l higher in those who died aged less than 60 and 0.26 mmol/l higher in those aged 60-79 (p = 0.03). For a given age at death the longer the gap between cholesterol measurement and death the more predictive the cholesterol concentration, both for coronary heart disease and all cause mortality (trend test p = 0.06 and 0.03 respectively). CONCLUSION--Reducing plasma cholesterol concentrations in middle age may influence the risk of death from coronary heart disease in old age. 
Uvulopalatopharyngoplasty: evaluation of postoperative complications, sequelae, and results. A study of 71 patients with obstructive sleep apnea syndrome was performed to evaluate the effectiveness, complications, and late sequelae of uvulopalatopharyngoplasty. Postoperative immediate complications were of minor importance. In 96% of the patients, the snoring was improved; it was completely resolved in 48%. The postoperative apnea index remained pathologic in all patients who underwent postoperative polysomnography, although mild improvement was noted. Seventy-four percent of our patients felt a subjective postoperative improvement which was not always confirmed by the polysomnographic examination. A record of improvement was obtained in 64% of the operated patients. Our results establish the beneficial effect of uvulopalatopharyngoplasty, which is the recommended surgical procedure for obstructive sleep apnea syndrome. 
Controlled multicenter double-blind trial of nicardipine in the treatment of primary Raynaud phenomenon. French Cooperative Multicenter Group for Raynaud Phenomenon, Paris, France. A total of 69 patients with primary Raynaud phenomenon were included in a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, crossover, placebo-controlled trial to assess the efficacy of nicardipine, a new calcium channel blocker. The trial data were combined with a meteorological survey. Nicardipine significantly (p = 0.02) reduced the number of crises of Raynaud phenomenon but had no significant effect on the intensity of the crises. Mean overall improvement, assessed on a linear visual analog scale, was 21% (p = 0.018), but results for the cold-reactive hyperemia test were not significantly altered after nicardipine treatment. All side effects were mild, and their frequency only differed significantly (p less than 0.05) from that of placebo for edema and headache. 
Bacteremia during extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy of renal calculi. An increasing incidence of bacterial endocarditis has been observed since the beginning of the last decade. An explanation for this fact is the expansion of diagnostic and therapeutic procedures in diverse medical disciplines. In a clinical study performed on 49 consecutive patients undergoing extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy a 14.3% rate of bacteremia was detected during treatment. The bacterial spectrum consisted of gram-positive cocci, gram-negative cocci, Bacteroides capillosus and Proteus mirabilis. In principle, these results do not call for an antibiotic prophylaxis. Nevertheless, according to the recommendations of the American Heart Association and the Deutsche Gesellschaft fur Herz- und Kreislaufforschung, patients with a cardiac risk predisposing to bacterial endocarditis must receive perioperative antibiotic prophylaxis. 
Long-term postoperative dysphagia in oral/pharyngeal surgery patients: subjects' perceptions vs. videofluoroscopic observations. Dysphagia commonly results from surgical resection of various structures within the oral, pharyngeal, and esophageal areas. The type and severity of swallowing dysfunction are based largely on the number and quantity of structures removed as well as the reconstructive procedure. Short term-recovery has been addressed in many studies. However, follow-up studies of long-term functional results and continuing swallowing problems following oral/pharyngeal surgery are unavailable. In this study, perception of swallowing dysfunction was compared with actual videofluoroscopic findings in subjects at least 1 year after oral/pharyngeal surgery. The comparative results of a questionnaire developed to evaluate patients' perception of continuing swallowing difficulty and an analysis of actual videofluoroscopic tapes indicated that the degree or type of dysphagia could not be determined from patients' subjective descriptions of the swallowing problem. 
Prolactin and growth hormone levels in premenopausal women with breast cancer and healthy women with a strong family history of breast cancer. Although both prolactin and growth hormone are believed to play roles in the development and growth of rodent mammary cancer, the role of these hormones in human breast cancer is uncertain. Under carefully specified conditions, serum levels of these hormones were determined by radioimmunoassay (RIA) and prolactin was determined by bioassay in 18 premenopausal women with breast cancer, 23 healthy women with a strong family history of breast cancer, and 39 healthy women with no significant family history of breast cancer. Parity was associated strongly with decreased prolactin levels, and increasing age was associated strongly with decreased growth hormone levels. After controlling for these variables, no differences in prolactin or growth hormone levels were found among the three groups of women. These data do not support roles for these RIA-measured hormones or bioassay-measured prolactin in premenopausal or familial breast cancer in omnivorous white women. 
Digital gangrene in small cell lung cancer: response to aspirin treatment. A patient who had small cell lung cancer complicated by symmetrical peripheral gangrene, secondary to spontaneous platelet aggregation, improved dramatically after starting aspirin treatment. 
Diagnostic classification of antineutrophil cytoplasmic autoantibody-associated vasculitides. Antineutrophil cytoplasmic autoantibodies (ANCA) are in the circulation of patients with a variety of clinically and pathologically distinctive forms of necrotizing vasculitis. Some patients have classic manifestations of well-recognized clinicopathologic syndromes, such as Wegener's granulomatosis, microscopic polyarteritis nodosa, and Churg-Strauss syndrome, but many patients are difficult to assign to a diagnostic category. The Ad Hoc Nomenclature Committee of The Third International Workshop on ANCA is attempting to identify a working classification system for ANCA-associated vasculitides. This system takes into account the many shared clinical and pathologic features, and relies on prerequisite positive and negative findings for diagnostic categorization. 
Cytokine-induced enhancement of ICAM-1 expression results in increased vulnerability of tumor cells to monocyte-mediated lysis. Pretreatment of the human melanoma cell line, A375, and the human colon carcinoma cell line, HT-29, with certain cytokines was found to increase the vulnerability of these cells to monocyte-mediated killing. This activity was found to correlate with increased expression of intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) on the tumor cells and was blocked by anti-ICAM-1 antibodies. Both IFN-gamma and TNF induced large increases in the ICAM-1 expression on both cell lines and increased the susceptibility of the tumor cells to monocyte-mediated killing. IFN-alpha and IL-1 beta, however, induced only small increases in ICAM-1 expression and enhanced the lysis of the A375 cells but not the HT-29 cells by monocytes. These differences may be the result of a higher basal expression of ICAM-1 found on the A375 cells when compared with the HT-29 cells. These data indicate that regulation of ICAM-1 expression on tumor cells can alter the vulnerability of these cells to lysis by monocytes. 
Oestrogen and androgen states in oligo-amenorrhoeic women with polycystic ovaries. Oestrogen and androgen states have been studied in relation to ovarian morphology defined by ultrasonography in 65 women with oligo-amenorrhoea. Of the 48 women with polycystic ovaries (PCO), 44 (92%) had a withdrawal bleed following progestogen challenge (indicating oestrogenization) compared with just three (18%) of the 17 with non-PCO (P less than 0.001). Median serum concentrations of oestradiol and oestrone were statistically significantly higher in the PCO group but the ranges overlapped widely. Of the four women with PCO but oestrogen deficiency, two were hirsute and had evidence of a severe form of the disorder. The other two were not hirsute and appeared to have hypothalamic dysfunction associated with weight loss overriding the disorder due to pre-existing PCO. Compared with the non-PCO group, the PCO subgroup without hirsutism (n = 31) had statistically significantly higher median values of LH, testosterone, androstenedione, and dehydroepiandrosterone sulphate concentrations, and free androgen index. Concentrations of androgen, but not LH, were significantly higher still in the PCO subgroup with hirsutism (n = 17). 
Expression of 5'-nucleotidase (CD73) related to other differentiation antigens in leukemias of B-cell lineage. Ecto-5'nucleotidase (5'NT; CD73) expression was studied with a monoclonal antibody (7G2) and a radiochemical assay and compared with the expression of other antigens in B-cell-lineage leukemias on cells from 100 leukemic patients and two cell lines. A B-cell origin was confirmed by the expression of CD19 and HLA-DR. Four stages of B-cell leukemias were defined: stage I (pro-B) as CD10-, cytoplasmic mu- (c mu-), surface Ig- (sIg-); stage II (cALL) as CD10+/c mu-/sIg-; stage III (pre-B) as CD10+ or -/c mu+/sIg-; and stage IV (B) as CD10-/c mu-/sIg+. A linear correlation was found between immunohistochemical and radiochemical determination of 5'NT (r = .86). 5'NT expression was low in T-cell leukemias and stage I, high in stages II and III, and low again in stage IV of B-cell leukemias. 5'NT expression was not related to c mu, CD20, CD21, CD22, CD34, and terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase (TdT) expression, but was significantly related to CD10 and inversely related to kappa/lambda expression. However, the 5'NT activity in CD10+ leukemias (stages II and III) shows a very wide range. Within the group of CD10+ leukemias no differences were detected between 5'NT+ and 5'NT- cells in their expression of other B-cell antigens. We conclude that the place of 5'NT in leukemias corresponding to early stages of B-cell development has been characterized. 5'NT is expressed in CD10+ stages and decreases before the expression of sIgs. Future studies should make clear whether a high expression of this enzyme in CD10+ stages is a normal maturation phenomenon or a malignant phenomenon. 
Management of the short-bowel syndrome. The patient with short-bowel syndrome after massive small-intestinal resection represents one of the greatest clinical challenges a general surgeon must face. Maintaining optimal nutritional and metabolic support until maximum bowel adaptation can occur is the top priority of therapy. Currently, no operative procedure for adjunctive management of the short-bowel syndrome is sufficiently safe and effective to recommend its routine use. Long-term parenteral nutrition remains the cornerstone of successful management. 
Scirrhous carcinoma of the stomach versus hypertrophic gastritis: findings at endoscopic US. To differentiate scirrhous carcinoma from hypertrophic gastritis, 16 patients with scirrhous carcinoma of the stomach and seven patients with hypertrophic gastritis were examined with endoscopic ultrasonography (US) between August 1987 and October 1990. US images of the normal gastric walls of 16 patients with gastric ulcers served as controls. Characteristic features of scirrhous carcinoma included an irregular hypoechoic enlargement of the third (submucosa) and fourth (muscularis propria) layers. The mean thickness of the third and fourth layers was increased sixfold and threefold, respectively, compared with thickness in healthy subjects. In the patients with scirrhous carcinoma, the mucosal layer remained normal in appearance at US, and it was possible to distinguish the five-layer structure of the gastric wall. These findings were prospectively correlated with histopathologic findings in the resected specimens. In contrast, only the mucosal layer was thickened in cases of hypertrophic gastritis. Recognition of these patterns at US can aid in the differential diagnosis of scirrhous carcinoma and such benign diseases as hypertrophic gastritis with a thickened gastric wall. 
Intracranial extension of a naso-ethmoid schwannoma. A rare case of intracranial extension of a naso-ethmoid schwannoma is presented. Its subsequent removal with few sequelae confirmed the benign nature and good prognosis of the disease. 
Value of MR imaging in differentiating benign from malignant soft-tissue masses: study of 95 lesions. MR imaging has largely replaced CT as the technique of choice for preoperative staging of patients with soft-tissue masses. Whether MR imaging can be used to differentiate benign from malignant masses is controversial. Our experience suggests that MR imaging often can characterize soft-tissue masses accurately. To evaluate this question further, we studied 95 consecutive lesions (50 benign and 45 malignant). Consecutive cases were selected to simulate our clinical practice. Surgical proof was available for all masses except hematomas, for which clinical follow-up confirmed the diagnosis. MR images were interpreted twice by three radiologists. The first review was accomplished without any clinical history and the second review with clinical history. Reviewers were asked to classify the lesion as benign or malignant on the basis of their clinical knowledge and analysis of MR image features (size, lesion margin, signal homogeneity, and neurovascular or bone involvement). Although interpretation varied somewhat because of the experience of the reviewers, the specificity and accuracy of diagnosis averaged 90% for both benign and malignant lesions. Negative predictive value for malignancy averaged 94% among the three reviewers. MR imaging is the technique of choice for identification and characterization of soft-tissue masses. The nature of the lesion (benign vs malignant) can be determined in the majority of cases. 
Exercise-induced ventricular tachycardia in association with a myocardial bridge. Sustained ventricular tachycardia induced by exercise is uncommon. This is a report of a patient who has a positive exercise test at a high level of exercise. The electrocardiogram has classic ischemic ST depressions. Following the appearance of these ST depressions, the patient developed ventricular tachycardia at a rapid rate. Workup that included an echocardiogram and cardiac catheterization revealed myocardial bridging of the left anterior descending artery as the only structural abnormality. Electrophysiologic studies revealed the patient to have ventricular tachycardia only with isoproterenol (Isuprel) infusion. 
Resolution of chronic pelvic pain after laparoscopic lysis of adhesions. Thirty women undergoing laparoscopic lysis of adhesions for the treatment of chronic pelvic pain were prospectively evaluated for the presence of a chronic pain syndrome. At follow-up, of those with chronic pain syndrome (10), four (40%) reported continued improvement or resolution of pain during daily activities of dyspareunia, whereas of those without chronic pain syndrome (20), 15 (75%) were better (p = 0.06). When these two complaints are evaluated individually, both pain during daily activities (p less than 0.05) and dyspareunia (p less than 0.05) are more likely to improve after lysis of adhesions in women without chronic pain syndrome. Prognosis was not related to the number of previous operations, adhesion score, or other physical parameters. Laparoscopic lysis of adhesions is generally worthwhile in the treatment of chronic pelvic pain, although the presence of psychosocial compromise warrants preoperative evaluation and concomitant treatment. 
Twin pregnancy: the impact of the Higgins Nutrition Intervention Program on maternal and neonatal outcomes. Perinatal outcomes were compared between 354 twins treated with the Higgins Nutrition Intervention Program and 686 untreated twins. After differing distributions of key confounding variables were adjusted for, the twins in the intervention group weighed an average of 80 g more (P less than 0.06) than the nonintervention twins; their low-birth-weight rate was 25% lower (P less than 0.05) and their very-low-birth-weight rate was almost 50% lower (P less than 0.05). Although the rate of preterm delivery was 30% lower in the intervention group (P less than 0.05), the rates of intrauterine growth retardation were similar in the two groups. Fetal mortality was slightly higher (14 vs 12 per 1000, NS), but early neonatal mortality was fivefold lower (3 vs 19 per 1000, P less than 0.06) in the intervention group. Maternal morbidity was significantly lower (P less than 0.05) in the intervention group. There was a trend towards lower infant morbidity in the intervention group. These results suggest that nutritional intervention can significantly improve twin-pregnancy outcome. 
Sugar-induced hypertension in Sprague-Dawley rats. Male Sprague-Dawley rats were fed either conventional rat chow, or a diet in which vegetable starch was replaced with either glucose or sucrose for two weeks. At the end of this period, measurements were made of weight, blood pressure, and plasma glucose, insulin, and triglyceride concentrations. The average weight gain over the dietary period was approximately 75 g, and did not vary between the three groups. Mean (+/- SEM) blood pressure remained stable in the rats fed conventional chow (124 +/- 2 to 127 +/- 3 mm Hg), but increased significantly in rats fed the glucose-enriched diet (122 +/- 1 to 134 +/- 2 mm Hg, P less than .02, compared to chow-fed rats). The increase in blood pressure was even greater in rats fed the sucrose-enriched diet (122 +/- 2 to 144 +/- 2), and was significantly greater (P less than .005) than in rats fed either conventional chow or the glucose-enriched diet. Plasma glucose concentrations did not change in any of the groups, but plasma insulin concentration approximately doubled in rats fed either the glucose-enriched or sucrose-enriched diets. Finally, plasma triglyceride concentrations also were significantly higher (P less than .002) in both glucose-fed and sucrose-fed rats than in the control group. However, the increase was greatest in the sucrose-fed rats, and was significantly higher than in rats fed the glucose-enriched diet (P less than .002). 
Intracanalicular acoustic neurinomas. The cases of 16 patients with acoustic neurinomas confined to the intracanalicular area are presented. These represent 2.7% of the 600 patients with acoustic neurinomas consecutively operated upon at the Neurosurgical Clinic at Nordstadt Hospital during the last 8 years. The comparatively earlier onset of vestibular symptoms and signs was characteristic of this group and precipitated diagnosis. The diagnostic reliability of magnetic resonance imaging was at least equivalent to that of air computed tomographic cisternography. Complete tumor removal was accomplished via the suboccipital approach in all patients, with 100% preservation of facial nerve and facial function; the cochlear nerve was preserved anatomically in 100% of the patients and functionally in 57%. No recurrence has occurred during follow-up periods of up to 8 years in all 16 patients. A broad spectrum of the current literature is considered, and purely intracanalicular acoustic neurinomas are discussed with regard to clinical characteristics, diagnostic steps-including neuroradiological and neurophysiological approaches-and surgical treatment and results. 
Identification of a monocyte receptor on herpesvirus-infected endothelial cells. The adhesion of circulating blood cells to vascular endothelium may be an initial step in atherosclerosis, inflammation, and wound healing. One mechanism for promoting cell-cell adhesion involves the expression of adhesion molecules on the surface of the target cell. Herpes simplex virus infection of endothelium induces arterial injury and has been implicated in the development of human atherosclerosis. We now demonstrate that HSV-infected endothelial cells express the adhesion molecule GMP140 and that this requires cell surface expression of HSV glycoprotein C and local thrombin generation. Monocyte adhesion to HSV-infected endothelial cells was completely inhibited by anti-GMP140 antibodies but not by antibodies to other adhesion molecules such as VCAM and ELAM-1. The induction of GMP140 expression on HSV-infected endothelium may be an important pathophysiological mechanism in virus-induced cell injury and inflammation. 
Global T wave inversion. Because global T wave inversion has not been specifically characterized, 100 electrocardiograms (ECGs) with this pattern (frontal plane T vector -100 degrees to -170 degrees with precordial T inversion) were prospectively collected from approximately 30,000 consecutively interpreted ECGs and analyzed blindly. There was a striking female predominance (82 women vs. 18 men; p less than 0.0005) despite an essentially equal number of female and male hospital admissions. There was a single statistically significant ECG correlate: a more vertical QRS axis in women (+14.1 degrees +/- 45.3 degrees vs. -5.6 degrees +/- 31.3 degrees; p = 0.034). The T waves were basically symmetric (68%), the influence of this factor usually altering the characteristically asymmetric T wave inversions of right bundle branch block (4 of 5) and left ventricular hypertrophy (21 of 36). Asymmetry was mainly associated with digoxin therapy (21 of 32 patients taking digoxin; p less than or equal to 0.0005) and a corrected QT (QTc) interval (0.433 +/- 0.095) shorter than with symmetric T wave inversions (0.507 +/- 0.074; p less than or equal to 0.0005) though not reaching the degree of shortening expected for digitalization. Twenty-eight patients admitted for acute myocardial infarction and 23 for a central nervous system disorder accounted for the majority of patients with symmetric T wave inversion. Fifteen of 18 patients who had coronary angiography had some degree of coronary artery disease: 3 had angiographically normal coronary arteries. 
An unusual problem during surgical removal of a broken guidewire. At operation, it proved impossible using traction alone to remove an angioplasty guidewire that was lodged in an intermediate artery. The problem was solved by passing a Teflon catheter over the wire, thus protecting the left main coronary artery while freeing the entrapped distal end of the guidewire. 
Physiologic and anatomic assessment of patients with rectocele. Clinical, physiologic, and anatomic assessments were carried out in 22 female patients with symptomatic rectocele (Group A), 15 patients with asymptomatic rectocele (Group B), and 14 subjects having no rectocele (Group C). Resting and pressure, rectal pressure, rectal compliance, anorectal inhibitory reflex, and rectal sensation did not differ among the groups. Proctography revealed that the lengths of the rectocele during attempted defecation in groups A (1.6 [1.0-3.5] cm) (median and range) and B (1.6 [1.0-3.0] cm) were significantly greater than that in Group C (0.4 [0.1-0.9] cm) (P less than 0.001 in both groups). Median pelvic floor descent at rest in Groups A (4.3 [1.6-7.5] cm) (median and range) and B (4.3 [1.3-6.9] cm) were significantly greater than that in Group C (2.5 [1.2-5.0] cm) (P less than 0.001 and P less than 0.02, respectively). These results indicate that rectocele is not associated with any physiologic change apart from a significant increase of pelvic floor descent. 
Intraperitoneal hemorrhage from hepatocellular carcinoma: emergency chemoembolization or embolization. From 1982 to 1990, 38 patients with intraperitoneal hemorrhage from hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) underwent treatment with emergency embolization with or without anticancer drug and iodized oil. Before emergency embolization, 24 patients had a serum total bilirubin value of 3.0 mg/dL or less (group A) and 14 patients had hyperbilirubinemia, with a serum bilirubin level greater than 3.0 mg/dL (group B). Successful hemostasis was achieved in all patients. The mean length of survival was 165 days in group A and 13 days in group B. A significant correlation (P less than .00003) between serum bilirubin level and prognosis was obtained. While tumor thrombus in the portal vein made the prognosis poor, there was no significant difference in prognosis between groups with and without tumor thrombus (P = .145). Emergency embolization is an effective treatment in patients with intraperitoneal hemorrhage from HCC. The prognosis for patients with HCC depends on the serum bilirubin level before embolization. 
The value of plain radiography in establishing the diagnosis of gastric lesions. Appreciation for the diagnostic value of plain (noncontrast) radiography of the gastrointestinal tract appears to have diminished with the advent of more sophisticated imaging techniques. A case in which scrutiny of the gastric air pattern on plain abdominal films suggested the underlying presence of Zollinger-Ellison syndrome emphasizes the potential diagnostic value of plain radiography of the abdomen for gastric disorders. 
XY chromosome nondisjunction in man is associated with diminished recombination in the pseudoautosomal region. To assess the possible association between aberrant recombination and XY chromosome nondisjunction, we compared pseudoautosomal region recombination rates in male meiosis resulting in 47,XXY offspring with those resulting in 46,XY and 46,XX offspring. Forty-one paternally derived 47,XXYs and their parents were tested at six polymorphic loci spanning the pseudoautosomal region. We were able to detect crossing-over in only six of 39 cases informative for the telomeric DXYS14/DXYS20 locus. Subsequently, we used the data to generate a genetic linkage map of the pseudoautosomal region and found it to be significantly shorter than the normal male map of the region. From these analyses we conclude that most paternally derived 47,XXYs result from meiosis in which the X and Y chromosomes did not recombine. 
Tardive dyskinesia and chronic pain. Psychotropic drugs are frequently used to treat chronic pain. Tardive dyskinesia is a serious complication of such therapy, but is not mentioned in the pain literature. Two cases are reported and the implications discussed. 
Metastatic carcinoma to the male breast. A case of metastasis to the male breast from prostate carcinoma is reported. For proper treatment, it is important to differentiate primary from metastatic tumours. Prostate-specific antigen screening should be strongly considered in all breast masses seen in patients with known prostatic carcinoma. One cannot assume that breast enlargement in these patients is solely due to oestrogen-induced gynecomastia. 
Standardized data collection and coding in eye disease epidemiology: the Uveal Melanoma Data System. The Uveal Melanoma Data System of the Massachusetts Eye and Ear Infirmary is a computerized data-base designed for data management and analysis with a broad range of clinical research applications. The system was created in 1980 and has evolved to include standardized data collection forms for all aspects of uveal melanoma patient care such as initial examination, treatment, and follow-up, as well as precoded forms for computer entry, which facilitate quality control measures and data analysis. Excerpts from current versions of these forms are presented. The Uveal Melanoma Data System has been used for a variety of clinical epidemiologic investigations. Examples of its application, including descriptive studies, prognostic factor studies, and treatment evaluations, are discussed. The model has potential broad application for clinical ophthalmic research in other specialty areas. 
The role of interleukin-1 and granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor in the paracrine stimulation of an in vivo-derived murine myeloid leukemia. WEHI-274.3 is a cell line isolated from an in vivo-derived, murine myelomonocytic leukemia. Although the survival and growth of WEHI-274.3 cells in vitro is absolutely dependent on the addition of exogenous growth factors such as interleukin-3 (IL-3), granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF), or colony-stimulating factor-1, when injected into syngeneic mice the cell line is tumorigenic. Sera from normal mice contain low levels of an activity that sustains survival of WEHI-274.3 but does not stimulate growth. In contrast, sera from mice bearing the WEHI-274.3 leukemia contained levels of CSF-1 and GM-CSF that stimulated the growth of WEHI-274.3 cells. Supernatants of cultures of WEHI-274.3 cells contained an activity that stimulated 3T3 fibroblasts to release an activity that stimulated the growth of the WEHI-274.3 cells. The 3T3-stimulatory activity released by the WEHI-274.3 cells was neutralized completely with an antiserum specific for murine IL-1 alpha, but not with antiserum specific for IL-1 beta. Moreover, WEHI-274.3 cells both in vitro and in vivo contained high levels of IL-1 alpha and IL-1 beta mRNAs. The leukemia-stimulatory activity released by the 3T3 cells was neutralized by an antiserum specific for GM-CSF. We postulate that the IL-1 alpha constitutively released by the WEHI-274.3 cells stimulates the production of GM-CSF from host cells such as fibroblasts or endothelial cells. A similar paracrine mechanism of growth stimulation may occur in acute myeloid leukemias in humans. 
A model for breast cancer screening. A model for breast cancer screening has been developed. When the appropriate screening policy is specified, the model reproduces the detection rates and the incidence of interval cancers as observed in the recent screening projects in Utrecht and Nijmegen, the Netherlands. The model-predicted mortality rate reduction is in accordance with the results of the Kopparberg/Ostergotland randomized trial in Sweden. Key parameters of the model are the duration of the preclinical stages and the sensitivity of mammography. The average duration is approximately 2 years at age 40 and increases to approximately 5 years at age 70. The sensitivity is high (approximately 95%) for tumors larger than 1 cm. The model is used in the prospective evaluation of effects and costs of various screening policies. 
Activation of AP-1 by IL-1 and phorbol esters in T cells. Role of protein kinase A and protein phosphatases. We have examined the regulation of the AP-1 transcription complex in the IL-1-responsive murine T cell thymoma cell line EL-4 6.1 C10. Our results demonstrate that AP-1-mediated gene expression in T cells may be regulated by several signaling pathways and factors, including IL-1, protein kinase C, protein kinase A (PKA), and one or more serine/threonine-specific protein phosphatases. The activation of protein kinase C results in an increase in nuclear AP-1 DNA binding activity, as well as enhanced gene expression. IL-1 and agents that elevate intracellular cAMP levels do not, by themselves, induce AP-1 activation, but they synergize with phorbol esters. IL-1 and forskolin may enhance AP-1 function by different mechanisms, because forskolin enhanced gene expression without producing an increase in nuclear AP-1 DNA binding, whereas IL-1 increased AP-1-binding activity and gene expression. These observations, in conjunction with the lack of a demonstrable effect of IL-1 on cAMP production in EL-4 cells, are consistent with the view that IL-1 enhances AP-1 activation by a pathway that does not directly involve cAMP and PKA. However, the induction of AP-1 activity by IL-1 and phorbol esters is dependent upon the presence of PKA, as evidenced by the loss of AP-1 inducibility in cells transfected with a cDNA encoding protein kinase inhibitor, a specific inhibitor of PKA. The effect of protein kinase inhibitor on AP-1 activation in response to IL-1 and tetradecanoyl-phorbol-13-acetate was reversed in the presence of the serine/threonine protein phosphatase inhibitor okadaic acid. Thus, the level of AP-1 activity in T cells may be determined by the balance between the activities of several serine/threonine protein kinases and phosphatases. 
Acute hemiplegia associated with HIV infection. An acute hemiplegia secondary to a large cerebral infarct is described in a 16-month-old infant with congenitally-acquired human immunodeficiency virus infection. Serial imaging studies during the next year documented improvement in his hemiplegia and a static underlying human immunodeficiency virus encephalopathy. Acquired immunodeficiency syndrome should be included in the differential diagnosis of children with acute hemiplegia. 
Benign thyroid adenoma causing recurrent laryngeal nerve palsy in a child. The standard teaching is that only malignant thyroid masses produce recurrent laryngeal nerve palsy. An unusual exception to this rule is reported. 
Atrial natriuretic peptide, aldosterone, and plasma renin activity in peripartum heart failure. Plasma concentrations of atrial natriuretic peptide and aldosterone and plasma renin activity were measured in patients with peripartum heart failure and in age matched healthy women post partum. Both groups had carried out traditional postpartum practices of salt consumption and body heating. Plasma concentrations (mean (SEM)) of atrial natriuretic peptide were significantly higher in the seven patients with peripartum heart failure (146.9 (24.3) pg/ml) than in the seven controls (4.4 (0.8) pg/ml). Both plasma aldosterone and plasma renin activity were suppressed in the patients with peripartum heart failure. After treatment for the heart failure plasma atrial natriuretic peptide fell considerably and there were associated increases in plasma aldosterone and plasma renin activity. The high plasma concentrations of atrial natriuretic peptide may have been a compensatory response to salt and water retention as well as to the heart failure. These high concentrations could also, in part, have suppressed the release of aldosterone and renin in an attempt to correct for volume overload. 
Amphetamine promotes recovery from sensory-motor integration deficit after thrombotic infarction of the primary somatosensory rat cortex. The present studies were undertaken to examine 1) whether d-amphetamine sulfate administered to rats well after thrombotic infarction of the vibrissal cortical barrel-field within the primary somatosensory cortex affected the rate and completeness of behavioral recovery and 2) whether a dose-response relation exists between d-amphetamine sulfate dose and recovery of function. In a learning task requiring sensory-motor integration, 41 rats were trained to perform a motor response in a T-maze consequent to the detection of a vibrissal deflection cue. Once training was complete, unilateral (n = 29) or sham (n = 12) infarction was produced by a noninvasive photochemical technique. After infarction, T-maze performance was assessed repeatedly in rats receiving 2 (n = 10) or 4 (n = 10) mg/kg d-amphetamine sulfate or saline (n = 9) 24 hours prior to testing on days 4, 6, 9, and 11. The sham-operated control rats received d-amphetamine sulfate (n = 7) or no injections (n = 5). All three infarcted groups displayed a reliable and sustained behavioral deficit in performance that was not present in the sham-operated control animals. Although the performance of each infarcted group improved over the testing sessions after the first injection, the amphetamine-treated groups improved at a faster rate than the saline-injected group. The results further demonstrated a dose-response effect, with the 4 mg/kg amphetamine group recovering to within preinfarction levels 6-8 days earlier than the 2 mg/kg amphetamine and saline-injected groups. Moreover, both amphetamine-treated groups recovered more completely than the saline-injected group. Quantification of the chronic infarct area revealed no differences among the amphetamine-treated and saline-injected groups. These data provide further evidence of the facilitatory effect of d-amphetamine sulfate on recovery from brain injury and extend this effect to the enhancement of recovery subsequent to thrombotic infarction of the primary somatosensory cortex. 
The receptor for ciliary neurotrophic factor. Although neurotrophic factors were originally isolated on the basis of their ability to support the survival of neurons, these molecules are now thought to influence many aspects of the development and maintenance of the nervous system. Identifying the receptors for these neurotrophic factors should aid in identifying the cells on which these factors act and in understanding their precise mechanisms of action. A "tagged-ligand panning" procedure was used to clone a receptor for ciliary neurotrophic factor (CNTF). This receptor is expressed exclusively within the nervous system and skeletal muscle. The CNTF receptor has a structure unrelated to the receptors utilized by the nerve growth factor family of neurotrophic molecules, but instead is most homologous to the receptor for a cytokine, interleukin-6. This similarity suggestes that the CNTF receptor, like the interleukin-6 receptor, requires a second, signal-transducing component. In contrast to all known receptors, the CNTF receptor is anchored to cell membranes by a glycosyl-phosphatidylinositol linkage. 
"Hemicrania continua": a clinical review. Hemicrania continua (HC) is a headache entity completely responsive to indomethacin. Since 1984, 18 cases have been described, 15 females and 3 males, i.e. a F:M ratio of 5.0. The finding of a female preponderance, like that in chronic paroxysmal hemicrania, is a new observation. HC is, in general, a unilateral headache in the sense that it sets in on one side and subsequently sticks to this side. In two cases, both sides might possibly be involved, when the pain was at its maximum. In another (somewhat dubious) case the headache was bilateral. The pain was continuous from the beginning in 8 of 18 cases (early stage ratio continuous: non-continuous = 0.8). Over time, the headache developed a continuous character in 16 of the 18 cases, producing a "continuous: non-continuous ratio" of 8:1. The intensity of pain generally was moderate and was not reported as excruciatingly severe by any patient. The autonomic involvement from a clinical point of view, was clearly less pronounced than that of other unilateral headaches, such as cluster headache and chronic paroxysmal hemicrania. 
Thyrotropin-secreting pituitary adenomas: report of seven cases. Seven patients with hyperthyroidism due to a TSH-secreting pituitary macroadenoma have been observed of a total of 800 patients with pituitary tumors over a period of 15 yr. Serum TSH levels varied between 1.1-36.3 mU/L. The serum alpha-subunit level was low in 1 case, while in 4 other cases the concentration was elevated and varied between 3.7-7.8 micrograms/L. Serum TSH beta levels were normal in the 4 cases in which it was determined. Serum GH or PRL levels were elevated in 5 cases. In 1 patient the cosecretion of TSH, GH, and PRL was confirmed by immunocytochemical examination. Serum TSH and alpha-subunit responses to TRH, GnRH, CRF, GRF, dexamethasone, methimazole, T3, and bromocriptine administration were variable when studied. Serum TSH and alpha-subunit circadian rhythms were absent in 1 case and inverted in another. A serum alpha-subunit pulsatility without TSH pulses was observed in 1 patient. Five patients underwent transsphenoidal adenomectomy. Three of 4 patients operated on in our center were cured, but a recurrence of the adenoma was found in 1 of them after 5 yr. The fifth patient was not cured. Treatment with octreotide in 3 patients resulted in normalization of serum TSH, GH, and thyroid hormones levels. Cosecretion of PRL in 1 case and alpha-subunit in 2 cases was also inhibited. Partial tachyphylaxis occurred in 1 patient. In summary, heterogeneity in clinical presentation, hormonal expression, and therapeutic response appears to characterize these TSH-secreting adenomas. 
Correlation of nuclear morphometry and DNA ploidy in rectal cancer. Several investigators have used morphometric measurements to determine differences in the nuclear size and shape of normal and neoplastic colorectal tissue. Changes in nuclear morphometric parameters have also been shown to correlate with prognosis in a variety of noncolorectal cancers. The association of nuclear morphometry with prognostic indicators in rectal cancer has not been well studied. Measurements of the nuclear area, perimeter, longest cord, and circularity factor from 39 primary rectal adenocarcinomas were compared with DNA content, degree of tumor differentiation, Dukes' class, and patient survival. Nuclear circularity was found to correlate with DNA ploidy. Nondiploid tumors with a DNA index greater than 1.3 had significantly more circular nuclei than tumors with diploid or near-diploid DNA content. There was no correlation between nuclear morphometry and Dukes' class or patient survival. Significant increases in DNA content of rectal cancers appear to be reflected by measurable changes in nuclear shape. Nuclear morphometric measurements may provide useful information in the study of the progression of neoplastic changes in colorectal cancer. 
Lymphocytic gastritis in nonulcer dyspepsia. The prevalence of lymphocytic gastritis, a specific form of chronic gastritis characterized by infiltration of gastric superficial epithelium with T lymphocytes, has been established in nonulcer dyspepsia. Among a population sample of 586 patients at risk for gastric carcinoma, 0.83% of patients with nonulcer dyspepsia and 1.63% of patients with chronic active gastritis showed lymphocytic gastritis. Among routine gastric biopsies from 5130 patients, only five cases met histological and immunohistochemical criteria of lymphocytic gastritis. 
Tinnitus: the hidden epidemic. A patient's perspective. The author describes his personal experience with tinnitus as well as various medical practitioners. He also discusses possible avenues for tinnitus research and suggests educational efforts that otolaryngology organizations might initiate. 
Acute regional cerebral blood flow changes caused by severe head injuries. To evaluate the changes in cerebral blood flow (CBF) that occur immediately after head injury and the effects of different posttraumatic lesions on CBF, 61 CBF studies were obtained using the xenon-computerized tomography method in 32 severely head-injured adults (Glasgow Coma Scale score (GCS) less than or equal to 7). The measurements were made within 7 days after injury, 43% in the first 24 hours. During the 1st day, patients with an initial GCS score of 3 or 4 and no surgical mass had significantly lower flows than did those with a higher GCS score or mass lesions (p less than 0.05): in the first 1 to 4 hours, those without surgical mass lesions had a mean CBF of 27 cc/100 gm/min, which rose to 44 cc/100 gm/min by 24 hours. Patients without surgical mass lesions who died tended to have a lower global CBF than did those with better outcomes. Mass lesions were associated with a high global CBF and bihemispheric contusions with the lowest flows. By 24 hours after injury, global blood flow increased in groups that originally had low flows and decreased in those with very high initial flows, such that by 36 to 48 hours, most patients had CBF values between 32 and 55 cc/100 gm/min. Lobar, basal ganglion, and brain-stem blood flow values frequently differed by 25% or more from global averages. Brain-stem CBF varied the most but did not correlate with clinical signs of brain-stem dysfunction. Double studies were performed at two different pCO2 values in 10 patients with various posttraumatic lesions, and the CO2 vasoresponsivity was calculated. Abnormal CO2 vasoresponsivity was found with acute subdural hematomas and defuse cerebral swelling but not with epidural hematomas. In patients without surgical mass lesions, the findings suggest that CBF in the first few hours after injury is often low, followed by a hyperemic phase that peaks at 24 hours. Global CBF values vary widely depending on the type of traumatic brain injury, and brain-stem flow is often not accurately reflected by global CBF values. These findings underscore the need to define regional CBF abnormalities in victims of severe head injury if treatment is intended to prevent regional ischemia. 
Observer variability of Osler's maneuver in detection of pseudohypertension. Pseudohypertension in the elderly occurs when blood pressure is overestimated because of inelastic, sclerotic arteries. Osler's maneuver (OM), the palpability of a pulseless artery, is recommended as a non-invasive test to detect pseudohypertension, despite limited data concerning its reproducibility. We assessed the maximum achievable inter-and intra-observer agreement of OM among 6 examiners: cardiologists, geriatricians and general internists. Each examiner performed OM twice on 65 elderly hypertensive men attending the general medicine and geriatric clinics. The inter-observer agreement for brachial and radial examinations was 79 and 70%, while intra-observer agreement was 82 and 75%, respectively. After adjusting for chance agreement the kappa values for inter-observer agreement for brachial and radial arteries were 0.38 (95% confidence interval (CI): 0.21-0.55) and 0.37 (0.28-0.46), respectively. Similarly, the kappa values for intra-observer agreement were 0.45 (95% CI: 0.35-0.55) and 0.49 (0.39-0.59). Kappa values never exceeded 0.6 in any time period, suggesting no training effect. OM cannot be recommended as a screening test for pseudohypertension given this low inter- and intra-observer agreement. 
Future applications of electronic thermography. The dental literature does not yet indicate the full range of facial thermographic findings in health and disease. Thermography is not useful in assessing some common dental problems, such as periapical granuloma. Promising reports, however, support its use in the diagnosis of neuralgias and atypical odontalgia, TMJ, nerve damage and repair after oral surgery, and in evaluating local dental anesthesia. Unfortunately, few if any of these studies were properly designed or conducted, limiting current attempts to define the value of thermography in dentistry. Until this situation resolves, ET of the face, for use in dentistry, can only be considered an investigational procedure. More research will clarify the precise contribution of thermography to dental problems. 
Percutaneous transluminal angioplasty involving internal mammary artery grafts. With the increasing use of the internal mammary artery as the conduit of choice in coronary bypass surgery, it is anticipated that an expanding patient population will have stenosis, usually at the site of internal mammary-to-coronary artery anastomosis. In our series 31 patients underwent dilatation at either the site of anastomosis (24), the native coronary artery beyond the anastomosis (4), or both (3) with no mortality, myocardial infarction, or need for emergency coronary artery bypass surgery. Angiographic and clinical success was achieved in 28 patients (90%). There were two internal mammary artery dissections with both patients requiring elective coronary bypass surgery. Of the patients in whom dilatation was successful, 22 (79%) have been followed for longer than 6 months and 19 (86%) have had sustained functional improvement at a mean of 35 months after angioplasty. One patient is to undergo repeat coronary bypass surgery. No patient has had a myocardial infarction or died during follow-up. Although percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty of the internal mammary artery has inherent difficulties because of the anatomic characteristics of the vessel, it can be performed with a high degree of primary success and a low incidence of complications and can provide long-term clinical improvement. 
Hemifacial spasm. Occurrence in multiple sclerosis. We present six patients with hemifacial spasm and multiple sclerosis. To our knowledge, this association has not been described previously in the North American literature. Magnetic resonance imaging was obtained in all the patients and plaques consistent with multiple sclerosis were identified. In two patients the plaques were seen in the area of the facial nucleus on the involved side. We suggest that hemifacial spasm can be a manifestation of multiple sclerosis. These cases illustrate the utility of magnetic resonance imaging in the investigation of hemifacial spasm. Our findings also support a central (nuclear) origin in multiple sclerosis associated with hemifacial spasm. 
Acute gastrointestinal hemorrhage detected by selective scintigraphic angiography. Intra-arterial 99mTc colloid scintigraphy may have greater sensitivity than either standard intravenous scintigraphy or selective arteriography in detecting gastrointestinal bleeding. Ten millicuries of 99mTc colloid were administered directly into the superior and inferior mesenteric arteries (SMA and IMA) of patients who had undergone selective arterial catheterization for the evaluation of gastrointestinal bleeding. In one patient, 99mTc-albumin colloid was administered directly into the IMA and identified diverticular bleeding. The bleeding had been occult to prior contrast arteriography and refractory to selective intra-arterial Pitressin therapy. In a second patient who had undergone three negative provocative angiograms, selective SMA injection of 99mTc-sulfur colloid identified occult mesenteric varices secondary to portal hypertension. Selective intra-arterial scintigraphy should be valuable in detecting intestinal bleeding occult to conventional studies. This will help in directing further therapy and diagnostic evaluation. 
Reconstruction of the medial half of the lower eyelid using a "switch" split-lid procedure. Reconstruction of the medial half of the lower eyelid has one major disadvantage: It produces a scar at right angles to the eyelid rim. In contrast, use of a "switch" split-lid procedure avoids this inconvenience. The lateral half of the lower eyelid is split in two lamellae. The inner layer is transferred medially, and the resulting defect is closed with a buccal graft. The outer layer is drawn laterally to cover the raw surface of the mucosal pedicle and graft. The surplus of skin over the lateral canthal area is removed. This procedure, which so far has been used in three patients, promises to be a useful alternative for reconstruction of the medial half, but not more, of the lower eyelid. 
Test-retest reliability of isokinetic knee extension and flexion torque measurements in persons with spastic hemiparesis. The purpose of this study was to evaluate and compare the test-retest reliability of isokinetic torque measurements in the involved and uninvolved knee musculature of 20 subjects with spastic hemiparesis. An isokinetic dynamometer was used to measure maximal voluntary knee extension and flexion at 60 degrees and 120 degrees/s. Peak torque (PT) and average peak torque (APT) data were collected from five repetitions on two separate occasions. Average peak torque was defined as the mean of the PT values obtained during each of the five repetitions. Spasticity was measured in the involved knee musculature prior to isokinetic testing using the Ashworth Scale. Pearson Product-Moment Correlation Coefficients and intraclass correlation coefficients (ICCs) were high (greater than or equal to .90) for both knees for PT and APT at both angular velocities. No clinically meaningful differences were found between the Pearson correlation coefficients and the ICCs of the involved versus the uninvolved knee for any testing conditions. We concluded that isokinetic evaluation of torque, as measured by PT and APT in subjects with spastic hemiparesis, can yield reliable results in both extremities. 
Effect of vasoconstriction on longitudinal distribution of pulmonary vascular pressure and volume. We used an improved version of the low-viscosity bolus method to evaluate longitudinal (arterial-to-venous) differences in the sensitivity of the dog lung lobe vasculature to selected vasoconstrictor stimuli, including hypoxia, and serotonin, histamine, and norepinephrine infusions. This method revealed a bimodal distribution of local vascular resistance vs. cumulative vascular volume under the zone 3 conditions studied. Our interpretation of the two modes of relatively high resistance is that they correspond to high resistance per unit volume segments of the arteries and veins upstream and downstream from the relatively low resistance per unit volume capillary bed. Thus an increase in the height of the upstream and downstream modes of the resistance distribution suggests constriction in small arteries and veins, respectively. Horizontal displacement of the modes along the cumulative volume axis suggests changes in the distribution of volume among the arteries, veins, and capillary bed. By use of these criteria, the results are consistent with the concept that each of the vasoconstrictor stimuli studied had a different longitudinal response pattern. Hypoxia constricted mainly small arteries, whereas serotonin constricted small and large arteries. Histamine constricted large and small veins, and norepinephrine constricted large and small veins and arteries. 
Successful balloon aortic valvuloplasty in a patient with mitral valve endocarditis. A critically-ill 73-year-old man was admitted with simultaneous mitral valve endocarditis and aortic stenosis. Balloon aortic valvuloplasty was performed successfully and without complications and was followed by prompt clinical improvement. Balloon aortic valvuloplasty should be considered in patients with aortic stenosis and nonaortic valve endocarditis. 
Status of the valves in the superficial and deep venous system in chronic venous disease. The relationship between the functional status of the venous valves in the superficial and deep veins and ulceration was evaluated in 42 patients. Twenty-five patients had ulcers, 12 of these patients had a history of previous deep venous thrombosis and 13 of these patients denied such an event. Seventeen patients had normal ankle skin, 10 of these patients had a documented history of deep vein thrombosis and seven of these patients had varicose veins only. An ultrasonic duplex scanner was used to document the presence of reflux in all segments of the superficial and deep system. In the entire group of 25 limbs with ulceration, valvular incompetence was noted in 22 limbs at levels involving segments that communicated with the ulcer-bearing area. Of the 17 limbs with normal ankle skin, in only two instances was a single segment of posterior tibial vein in midcalf found to be incompetent. For those patients with normal ankle skin and a history of varicose veins, the deep veins below the common femoral vein level were always competent. 
Diagnostic tests for choreoacanthocytosis. Two patients with striatal atrophy and a clinical syndrome consistent with choreoacanthocytosis had normal dried blood smears but their red cells demonstrated an abnormal sensitivity to various conditions known to promote discocyte-echinocyte transformation. Dilution in normal saline, in vitro aging, and contact with glass caused a great proportion of these patients' red cells to develop multiple spiny or rounded projections. Under identical conditions, such shape changes did not occur in normal patients or in those with Huntington's disease. Scanning electron microscopy showed that the age-induced increase in acanthocytic-appearing cells could be reversed with chlorpromazine. These data suggest that the red cells from these patients with striatal degeneration are deficient in their ability to preserve normal shape in the face of echinocytic stress and that this observation has diagnostic and, possibly, pathophysiologic significance. 
Combined split anterior tibial-tendon transfer and intramuscular lengthening of the posterior tibial tendon. Results in patients who have a varus deformity of the foot due to spastic cerebral palsy. Twenty patients who had a varus deformity of the foot secondary to spastic cerebral palsy had twenty-two operations involving combined split anterior tibial-tendon transfer and intramuscular lengthening of the posterior tibial tendon, with and without concomitant lengthening of the Achilles tendon. Preoperatively, all patients had had a dynamic varus deformity of the hindfoot and adduction of the forefoot in both the stance phase and the swing phase of gait. At an average follow-up of 6.2 years (range, 2.3 to 8.8 years), there were fourteen excellent, four good, and four poor clinical results. Two patients who had a fixed varus deformity of the hindfoot and one patient who had a very weak anterior tibial muscle had a poor result. We concluded that the combined procedure is effective for correction of a flexible varus deformity of the foot in patients who have spastic cerebral palsy. 
Continuous ambulatory ECG monitoring in the perioperative period: relationship of preoperative status and outcome. We have used continuous ambulatory electrocardiography in the perioperative period to monitor 108 patients with known cardiovascular disease undergoing non-cardiac surgery. There was a high incidence of ischaemic ST segment changes and ventricular arrhythmias. For the group as a whole, anaesthesia and surgery were followed by increased ventricular ectopic activity, but did not worsen myocardial ischaemia. However, the mean duration of ischaemic ST segment changes was increased significantly in those patients with treated hypertension. Of the risk factors considered, preoperative ischaemia and peroperative systolic arterial pressure were significant correlates with postoperative myocardial ischaemia. 
Induction of nm23 gene expression in human colonic neoplasms and equal expression in colon tumors of high and low metastatic potential. Levels of expression of the murine nm23 gene inversely correlate with metastatic potential in several rodent tumor model systems. Expression of the human nm23 homologue also is lower in human breast cancers of high metastatic potential than in breast cancers of low metastatic potential. In the present study, we examined changes in nm23 expression during colon carcinogenesis as found in 18 matched pairs of normal and neoplastic human colon tissues. We found that a 0.8-kilo-base nm23 transcript was expressed in all samples of morphologically normal colon mucosa. In 16 of 18 colon neoplasms, nm23 expression was further increased in the neoplastic, compared with the morphologically normal, colon mucosa from the same individual. Expression of nm23 was elevated over normal mucosa in 3 of 3 polyps, in 2 of 3 nonmetastatic cancers, and in 11 of the 12 cancers that were metastatic at the initial presentation. The levels of nm23 expressed were similar in the 12 metastatic colon neoplasms and in the 6 colon neoplasms of lower clinical stage. In addition, nm23 expression was maintained in culture in each of 12 cell lines initiated from human colon neoplasms and did not differ between lines established from neoplasms of high or low metastatic capability. We concluded that nm23 was expressed in normal colon mucosa. Expression of nm23 increased during early stages of colon carcinogenesis and remained increased in metastatic colon cancer. Therefore, in the colon, tissue-specific events dissociate nm23 expression from loss of tumor metastatic competence. 
Expression and distribution of atrial natriuretic peptide in human hypertrophic ventricle of hypertensive hearts and hearts with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. To investigate the ventricular expression of atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) in human hypertrophic hearts, we conducted an immunohistochemical study of 130 endomyocardial biopsy specimens obtained from the right side of the ventricular septum (RVB), left ventricular free wall (LVB), or both from a total of 80 patients: 44 patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM), 14 with apical hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (APH), 13 with hypertensive hearts (HHD), and nine without hypertrophy (controls). No patients had apparent congestive heart failure. ANP was not seen in ventricular myocytes in controls but was identified in biopsy specimens of hypertrophic hearts, and its distribution was characteristic in each hypertrophic group: 15 RVB (37%) and two LVB (7%) of the HCM group, one RVB (7%) and two LVB (18%) of the APH group, and zero RVB (0%) and five LVB (46%) of the HHD group. Clinical data (including echocardiographic, hemodynamic, and angiographic data) were not directly related to ventricular ANP expression in HCM, APH, or HHD with one exception. In HHD patients, LVB specimens with ANP showed greater ventricular wall thickness than LVB specimens without ANP. According to histological data, however, the ANP-present RVB specimens of HCM or ANP-present LVB specimens of HHD had greater myocyte size than did the ANP-absent specimens. In addition, in HCM patients, the ANP-present RVB specimens showed more severe fibrosis and myofiber disarray than did the ANP-absent specimens. We conclude that a failing state and hemodynamic overload are not likely to be indispensable for ANP expression in human hypertrophic ventricles and that ventricular ANP expression occurs as a response to disease-specific changes: hemodynamic overload in HHD and histological changes such as myocardial fiber disarray, hypertrophy of myocytes, and fibrosis in HCM, which may reflect the characteristic distribution of intraventricular ANP. 
Management of adipsia by a behavioural modification technique. Adipsia combined with diabetes insipidus after hypothalamic damage may produce major difficulties in clinical management. If there is an associated memory impairment it may be impossible to teach self-regulation of fluid balance, necessitating long-term hospital supervision. The successful use of a behaviour modification technique to achieve independent drinking and allow discharge from hospital into the community is described in a patient with adipsia, diabetes insipidus and memory impairment resulting from the removal of a craniopharyngioma. 
Perilymph fistulas: the House Ear Clinic experience. The diagnosis, evaluation, and surgical treatment of perilymph fistulas has recently been the focus of a great deal of attention in otology. Authors have focused on perilymph fistulas as the cause of hearing loss and vertigo in many diverse situations. Additionally, surgical repair has been suggested when there is little objective support for intervention. To address some of the problems inherent in the diagnosis and treatment of perilymph fistulas, records of patients operated on at the House Ear Clinic during the past 12 years were reviewed retrospectively. Eighty-six patients were surgically explored for fistulas during this period. Thirty-five (40.7%) fistulas were found, and 51 ears were patched whether fistulas were found or not. Of the 80 patients who were seen for follow-up, 35 (43.8%) were subjectively better, and 45 (56.2%) were the same. Although the number of fistulas found and the number of patients improved were similar, the composition of the two groups was different. On the basis of audiometric results, improvement in hearing occurred in only 18.7% of the patients. None of the demographic factors or diagnostic tests were predictive of either the presence of a fistula or the therapeutic outcome. Further work is required to facilitate the preoperative diagnosis of fistulas and to design appropriate surgical intervention. 
Management of childhood cholesteatoma. We report a retrospective study of 54 children with 57 involved ears who underwent surgery for cholesteatoma before their sixteenth birthdays. The majority of these underwent open cavity operations (modified radical mastoidectomy, radical mastoidectomy or atticotomy). The incidence of residual disease was only 6 per cent and overall 70 per cent of ears have been free of chronic discharge. The post-operative hearing thresholds were disappointingly low, though overall no worse than those recorded before surgery. The mean post-operative hearing level for the group was 39 dB and the mean air-bone gap was 29 dB. Open cavity surgery is the method of choice for childhood cholesteatoma, mainly because of the low incidence of residual disease. 
Cytologic manifestations of ballistic injury. The adherent residue from 60 projectiles in 38 consecutive gunshot wound deaths was analyzed by cytologic technique to determine whether a bullet, while passing through the body or intermediate target, retains tissue and other trace evidence. The projectiles, which were recovered from both the body and shooting area, contained microscopically recognizable cellular and inert material in all cases. Direct ballistic trauma could be documented in several tissue types, most notably in muscular tissue. Progressive damage to skeletal and cardiac muscle was seen in multiple preparations. This ranged from partial separation of the fascicles to cytoplasmic homogenization and nuclear rupture. Except in cases of severe ballistic trauma, skeletal and cardiac muscle could be distinguished on the preparations. In addition to neural tissue, projectiles traversing the central nervous system (CNS) contained elongated fragments of intact microvascular structures, sheets of cerebral covering cells, and connective tissue from the scalp. The vascular structures present in CNS preparations may clarify some of the clinical findings in victims of gunshot wounds and elucidate possible pathophysiologic mechanisms in craniocerebral projectile injuries. 
Laboratory differences in cervical cytology. This prospective study was designed to determine if there is a difference in reporting endocervical cells in Papanicolaou smears among laboratories used by an urban, academic family practice. A review of the literature found no studies comparing Papanicolaou smear results among laboratories with respect to the presence of endocervical cells. In this study, three laboratories evaluated a total of 140 Papanicolaou smears from women aged 16 to 83 (mean = 33.8) for endocervical cells. The presence of endocervical cells was reported for 88 smears (62.9%) ranging from 42/83 (50.6%) to 21/23 (91.3%) among laboratories. Results of an analysis of variance revealed a statistically significant difference in the frequency of reporting endocervical cells (p less than .001) among the laboratories. Analysis of covariance controlling for effects of several factors known to influence the outcome of Papanicolaou smears (age, days since last menstrual period, method used to obtain smear, and experience of clinician obtaining smear) failed to explain this difference. 
Syringomyelia secondary to congenital intraspinal lipoma. Preoperative evaluation using serial magnetic resonance imaging was performed on an infant with lumbosacral lipoma. Syrinx formation arising just above the lipoma was observed in conjunction with rapid growth of the lipoma. Definite shrinkage of syringomyelia was obtained after radical excision of the lipoma. The syrinx formation was possibly caused by compression from the extramedullary lipoma. 
Parent-child concordance in multiple sclerosis. It is now recognized that susceptibility to multiple sclerosis (MS) is determined in part by genetic factors. The gene loci influencing MS susceptibility are largely unidentified. In an attempt to better understand the mode of transmission, parent-child concordance for MS was studied in two large, population-based MS clinic populations. Among 75 parent-child pairs concordant for MS, we found 40 mother-daughter pairs, 13 mother-son pairs, 21 father-daughter pairs, and 1 father-son pair. Controlling for the known female preponderance in MS, the data show a paucity of father-son pairs. These data have implications for understanding the mechanisms of inheritance for MS susceptibility as well as for risk counseling in families of patients. 
Empiric therapy with amphotericin B in febrile granulocytopenic patients. The early diagnosis of invasive fungal infection in granulocytopenic patients remains unreliable. Granulocytopenic patients who are persistently or recurrently febrile despite therapy with appropriate antibacterial agents are at high risk for the development of such infection. Two randomized clinical trials demonstrated that the empiric administration of amphotericin B to persistently or recurrently febrile granulocytopenic patients decreased the frequency, morbidity, and mortality of invasive fungal infection; these effects were especially marked in profoundly granulocytopenic patients who were not receiving antifungal prophylaxis. Current studies continue to indicate that prompt empiric administration of amphotericin B to persistently or recurrently febrile granulocytopenic patients ensures earlier treatment of deep mycoses. The roles of newer antifungal triazole compounds and of liposomal and lipid complexes of amphotericin B in empiric antifungal therapy must be investigated further in thoughtfully designed, randomized clinical trials. 
Relation of early hemodynamic changes to final cardiac phenotype and survival after neural crest ablation in chick embryos. BACKGROUND. Microcinephotography was used to study a model of persistent truncus arteriosus created in chick embryos by ablation of premigratory neural crest destined for the third and fourth aortic arch arteries as well as the septum of the cardiac outflow tract. METHODS AND RESULTS. Twenty-five control embryos and 105 of 202 experimental embryos were filmed on day 3 of incubation and then reincubated. The remaining 97 experimental embryos were not filmed because of twisting of the embryos, but they were reincubated. There was no difference in either the survival rate (p greater than 0.23) from day 3 to day 11 of incubation or the incidence of persistent truncus arteriosus (p greater than 0.08) between the filmed and the nonfilmed embryos. Incomplete looping of the cardiac tube observed in experimental embryos during early cardiogenesis correlated with a right ventricular origin of the outflow vessels in the definitive heart. Hemodynamic measurements indicated that there was no difference in heart rate, ejection fraction, systolic and diastolic areas, stroke volume, and cardiac output between controls and the experimental group as a whole. However, embryos that did not survive to day 11 had decreased stroke volume (p less than 0.001) and cardiac output (p less than 0.001), whereas embryos that survived to day 11 with cardiac malformations had increased stroke volume and cardiac output in early embryogenesis. CONCLUSIONS. Increased stroke volume and cardiac output may be necessary factors for survival in embryos with cardiac dysmorphogenesis and probably are associated with dilation of the ventricular portion of the cardiac tube, which leads to malalignment of the outflow vessel or vessels. 
Serious bacterial infections in children. When can outpatient treatment be used? Several studies now support outpatient treatment of many serious bacterial infections in children, such as periorbital or buccal cellulitis, urinary tract infection, pneumonia, and abscess. However, an appropriate agent, that is, a third-generation cephalosporin with a long half-life, must be available and its effectiveness properly researched. In addition, children must be free of other illnesses and able to ingest fluids and maintain hydration, and their parents must be willing and able to cooperate with an outpatient treatment regimen. Family physicians can maintain the close patient and family contact needed to facilitate this form of therapy. 
Nocturnal hypoxemia as a determinant of vigilance impairment in sleep apnea syndrome. In sleep apnea syndrome (SAS), vigilance impairment is typically associated with highly disrupted sleep, but recently, nocturnal hypoxemia has also been identified as a second pathogenetic factor in patients with a high degree of desaturation. However, although sleep disruption has been demonstrated to play a role in both the propensity to fall asleep and the capacity to stay awake, the role of nocturnal hypoxemia has been implicated only in the latter. In the present study, both sleep disruption and nocturnal hypoxemia were assessed in 20 moderately to severely apneic patients. During the day, vigilance was assessed both by the multiple sleep latency test (MSLT), as a measure of the propensity to fall asleep, and by the four-choice reaction time test (FCRTT), as a measure of the capacity to stay awake in a performance task. Severity of nocturnal hypoxemia was found to predict performance on the MSLT, as well as on the FCRTT, but sleep disruption was found to predict performance only on the FCRTT. These results suggest that in moderately to severely affected SAS patients, nocturnal hypoxemia may play a primary role in the pathogenesis of vigilance impairment. 
Sucralfate versus antacids or H2-antagonists for stress ulcer prophylaxis: a meta-analysis on efficacy and pneumonia rate. OBJECTIVES AND METHODS: Histamine2 (H2)-receptor antagonists and antacids have been the basic drugs for the prevention of stress bleeding in ICU patients during the past decade. Recently, drugs without major influence on gastric pH have been investigated in stress bleeding prophylaxis. Therefore, a meta-analysis (Mantel-Haenszel test) was undertaken to determine the efficacy of sucralfate in the prevention of macroscopically visible stress bleeding, as well as the influence of sucralfate on the frequency of pulmonary infections. RESULTS: The efficacy of sucralfate was compared with H2-antagonists in nine studies and with antacids in eight studies. Sucralfate was significantly more effective than H2-antagonists (typical odds ratio 0.532, 95% confidence interval 0.303 to 0.933) and equally as effective as antacids (typical odds ratio 0.868, 95% confidence interval 0.452 to 1.667). The pneumonia rates of those patients who were administered sucralfate were compared with the rates of those patients who were given H2-antagonists in five studies and with those patients who were given antacids in four studies. Pneumonia was a significantly more frequent occurrence under prophylaxis with H2-antagonists (typical odds ratio 0.498, 95% confidence interval 0.316 to 0.783) as well as with antacids (typical odds ratio 0.402, 95% confidence interval 0.235 to 0.687). CONCLUSION: Sucralfate is an effective drug for the prevention of stress bleeding that minimizes the risk of nosocomial pneumonia in long-term ventilated ICU patients. 
Relationship of HBsAg subtypes with HBeAg/anti-HBe status and chronic liver disease. Part II: Evaluation of epidemiological factors and suspected risk factors of liver dysfunction. In this study, we examined a possibility that epidemiological factors or suspected risk factors of liver dysfunction could account for the different HBeAg/anti-HBe status or the different prevalence of liver dysfunction between the adr and adw carriers. A total of 428 HBsAg carriers were surveyed of their age, sex, racial background, socioeconomic status, place of residence, birthplace, alcohol consumption, smoking habit, and history of blood transfusion as epidemiological factors or suspected risk factors of liver dysfunction. Adjustment for those variables using multivariate analyses did not substantially affect the association of the HBsAg subtypes with either prevalence of liver dysfunction or HBeAg/anti-HBe status. HBsAg subtypes seem to directly affect HBeAg/anti-HBe status and consequently influence development of chronic liver disease. 
Antibiotic therapy of intra-abdominal sepsis in the elderly: experience with ticarcillin and clavulanic acid. Age is a major factor in determining the outcome for older patients with intra-abdominal sepsis. Poor outcome in these patients may be related to a number of physiologic and immunologic changes associated with aging. The treatment of intra-abdominal sepsis can itself pose special risks for the elderly. Standard regimens containing aminoglycosides have a substantial risk of nephrotoxicity, which is magnified in elderly patients. Alternatives to standard aminoglycoside-containing regimens, therefore, are desirable. Most intra-abdominal infections involve multiple pathogens, usually both aerobic and anaerobic. The polymicrobial nature of intra-abdominal sepsis mandates antimicrobial chemotherapy effective against a broad range of organisms. In the past several years, a host of new antibiotics have been introduced that used alone or in combination with other drugs has the potential of safely avoiding aminoglycosides in many patients with intra-abdominal sepsis. One such agent, ticarcillin with clavulanate potassium, is active against a wide spectrum of aerobic and anaerobic pathogens. In a prospective, randomized, open label trial, ticarcillin and clavulanate was compared with gentamicin and clindamycin. Although the sample size was too small to allow meaningful statistical comparisons of efficacy and safety, both regimens were effective and well tolerated. In general, prolonged administration of aminoglycosides is rarely indicated for the treatment of intra-abdominal sepsis in the elderly, although initial empiric use of aminoglycosides may sometimes be warranted. 
PTA and laser assisted PTA combined with simultaneous surgical revascularization. In this study we investigated the efficacy of percutaneous transluminal angioplasty (PTA) and laser percutaneous transluminal angioplasty (LPTA) as an adjunct to surgery in patients with peripheral vascular disease. We report 84 cases of the simultaneous association of direct arterial surgery and angioradiological procedures to treat 82 patients with arterial occlusive disease of the lower limbs. Sixty-five patients (79.2%) were affected by severe claudication and 14 (19.6%) presented with rest pain or gangrene. One patient (1.2%) had signs of acute ischemia. PTA or LPTA were utilized as an inflow procedure in 41 cases (48.8%), as an outflow procedure in 24 (28.6%) and in 19 cases (22.6%) to recanalize an arterial occlusion in the contralateral limb opposite to surgical interventions. Immediate postoperative patency was achieved in 79 cases (94.0%), while in 5 cases (6.0%) it was impossible to perform a satisfactory balloon dilatation. The complication rate was 16.6%: 10 perioperative thromboses, 1 plaque dissection, 1 peripheral embolus, 1 haemorrhage and 1 femoral nerve lesion. No perioperative mortality occurred in this group of patients. Long term patency, analyzed with the life-table method (mean follow-up: 28 months) was respectively 78.0%, 76.3% and 78.9% at 5 years. These data indicate that the combined revascularization technique should always be recommended in properly selected patients because it is less invasive, the surgical risk and operative time are reduced and associated with early and long term cumulative patency rates comparable to those of extensive surgery. 
Quantitative electroencephalography: a report on the present state of computerized EEG techniques. American Psychiatric Association Task Force on Quantitative Electrophysiological Assessment. The American Psychiatric Association established the Task Force on Quantitative Electrophysiological Assessment in May 1989 to consider several questions of interest to psychiatrists. From the inception of techniques for quantitative electroencephalography (qEEG), the possibility was raised that it would substantially assist in the diagnosis of brain disorders. However, controversy exists over the scientific basis for such approaches and the training necessary for interpretation of computerized records. The task force's charge was to report 1) the present state of scientific knowledge about qEEG, 2) the role of qEEG in clinical psychiatric practice at the present time, 3) the training necessary for the use of qEEG techniques, and 4) the possible future of the technique in the study of mental disorders. The task force concluded that qEEG is particularly useful for the detection of abnormalities in slow waves, which are a feature of delirium, dementia, intoxication, and other syndromes involving gross CNS dysfunction. The ability of qEEG to help in the diagnosis of other disorders, such as schizophrenia or depression, is not yet established. Clinical replications and sharing of normative and patient data bases are necessary for the advancement of this field. Proper use of this technique requires extensive training in a center experienced in its use. Standards for training and for using the technology in psychiatry are urgently needed. This report was approved by the Board of Trustees in December 1990. 
The p53 tumour suppressor gene. The cell cycle is composed of a series of steps which can be negatively or positively regulated by various factors. Chief among the negative regulators is the p53 protein. Alteration or inactivation of p53 by mutation, or by its interactions with oncogene products of DNA tumour viruses, can lead to cancer. These mutations seem to be the most common genetic change in human cancers. 
The impact of ulcerogenic drugs on surgery for the treatment of peptic ulcer disease. To investigate the impact of ulcerogenic drugs on surgery for the treatment of peptic ulcer disease, we reviewed 150 surgical cases. Ulcerogenic drug use (steroids and/or nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents, including aspirin) increased from 15% between 1972 and 1977 to 37% between 1983 and 1988. While there was no correlation between ulcerogenic drug use and hemorrhage, obstruction, or intractable pain, 16 (52%) of the 31 perforations and 26 (38%) of the 69 emergency operations were associated with use of ulcerogenic drugs. The overall mortality rate was 11%. Death was correlated with age greater than 65 years and emergency operation, but not with ulcerogenic drug use or other variables. Of 12 patients with histories of peptic ulcer disease who were treated with ulcerogenic drugs without concomitant antiulcer prophylaxis, 11 (92%) required emergency operation to treat perforation or massive hemorrhage. Standard antiulcer medications or misoprostol should be prescribed to elderly patients and to those with histories of ulcers who require ulcerogenic drug therapy. 
Mouse bronchiolar cell carcinogenesis. Histologic characterization and expression of Clara cell antigen in lesions induced by N-nitrosobis-(2-chloroethyl) ureas. Female Swiss mice (Cr:NIH(S)) developed bronchiolar cell hyperplasia, dysplasia, metaplasia, and various morphologic types of bronchiolar cell tumors after topical (skin) application of N-nitroso-methyl-bis-chloroethylurea (NMBCU) or N-nitroso-tris-chloroethylurea (NTCU). These compounds are the first found to induce systemically bronchiolar cell tumors in mice in high incidence. Twice a week, with a 3-day interval, a 25-microliter drop of 0.04 mol/l (molar) NMBCU or NTCU in acetone was applied to the shaved interscapular integument for a maximum of 35 to 40 weeks. The earliest lung neoplasms were seen in mice that died after 23 weeks of treatment and affected 11 of 19 with NMBCU and 14 of 19 with NTCU treatment. Tumor growth pattern was nodular or the neoplastic tissue was frequently disseminated throughout the parenchyma, starting from multicentric peribronchiolar foci. The most common tumor types were squamous cell carcinomas and adenosquamous carcinomas, followed by adenocarcinomas with or without secretory cells, and a single ciliated-cell tumor. Histochemical and immunohistochemical studies were carried out on paraffin-embedded lungs using the avidin-biotin immunoperoxidase complex procedure and antisera against keratin, Clara cell antigen, surfactant apoprotein, neuron-specific enolase, bombesin, and chromogranin A. In several mice from both groups, hyperplasias and tumors were composed of cells expressing Clara cell antigen. No tumor cells were found expressing alveolar type II or neuroendocrine cell markers. It appeared that bronchiolar cells, in particular Clara cells, had migrated from terminal bronchioles or invaded bronchiolar walls to extend into the alveolar parenchyma. Squamous cell metaplasia with keratin expression was seen within airways or associated with glandular tumors, especially at the periphery. A unique cell type, with large eosinophilic globules and associated eosinophilic crystals, was seen lining airways or forming hyperplastic and neoplastic lesions. N-nitroso-methyl-bis-chloroethylurea- and NTCU-induced mouse bronchiolar cell alterations could be an interesting new model to study mechanisms of bronchiolar cell differentiation and tumor formation. 
Torticollis in children. Torticollis is a common clinical sign that is found in a variety of disorders. Childhood torticollis differs from the adult form in that congenital types are common and many frequently encountered disorders found in adults are unusual. Pediatric torticollis related to otolaryngologic conditions is reviewed, and three illustrative cases are presented. 
Cardiomyopathy of the aging human heart. Myocyte loss and reactive cellular hypertrophy. To determine the effects of aging on the human myocardium, 67 hearts were obtained from individuals who died from causes other than cardiovascular disease. The age interval examined was 17-90 years. Regression analysis demonstrated that the aging process was characterized by a loss of 38 million and 14 million myocyte nuclei/yr in the left and right ventricular myocardium, respectively. This loss in muscle mass was accompanied by a progressive increase in myocyte cell volume per nucleus in both ventricles. Left ventricular myocytes enlarged by 110 microns3/yr, whereas right ventricular myocytes increased by 118 microns3/yr, resulting in a preservation of ventricular wall thickness. However, the cellular hypertrophic response was unable to maintain normal cardiac mass. Left and right ventricular weights decreased by 0.70 and 0.21 g/yr, respectively. In conclusion, loss of cells and enlargement of the remaining myocytes may represent the structural basis for the reduced compensatory capacity of the aged heart and together may contribute to the development of myocardial dysfunction and failure in the elderly. 
Mandatory trial of labor after cesarean delivery: an alternative viewpoint Twelve women experienced major rupture of the uterus during a trial of labor after previous cesarean (low transverse cervical incision in 11, low vertical in one). Two women required hysterectomy and a third had serious postoperative complications. There were three perinatal deaths, and two infants suffered significant long-term neurologic impairment. Although vaginal birth after cesarean delivery is considered safe in most instances, these cases serve as a reminder that catastrophic events can occur. Potential complications have important implications for clinicians when counseling patients about the route of delivery and for the management of any trial of labor after cesarean delivery. 
High-speed memory scanning in Parkinson's disease: adverse effects of levodopa. High-speed memory scanning as assessed by the Sternberg paradigm was studied in 12 nondemented patients with fluctuating Parkinson's disease and 13 age-matched healthy controls. Patients were first assessed before taking their morning dose of levodopa ("off") and again after that dose had produced full clinical effect ("on") after that dose had produced full clinical effect ("on"). Although motor components of the measured choice reaction time were slower in patients when off than in control subjects, memory scanning speed was not different. After levodopa (on), patients' motor time normalized, but cognitive processing speed became significantly slower when compared with previous performance in the off condition and with controls. Contrary to previous concepts of bradyphrenia in patients with Parkinson's disease, these results indicate that dopaminergic stimulation can reduce cognitive processing speed. 
Preparedness of practicing pediatricians to manage emergencies. To determine pediatrician preparedness to manage emergencies, a nationally representative random sample of 1000 non-hospital-based pediatricians was surveyed about (1) types of emergencies encountered and methods of transport to an emergency facility, (2) availability and use of equipment and medications in the office, and (3) determinants of pediatrician confidence in managing emergencies. The proportion of pediatricians who had encountered specific emergencies ranged from 86% for meningitis to 22% for cardiopulmonary arrest. The majority transported acutely ill children to an emergency department by ambulance. Availability of individual pieces of equipment and medications in offices ranged from 97% for epinephrine 1:1000 to 11% for bone marrow needles for intraosseous access. Combination of equipment available to manage particular emergencies ranged from 61% for severe dehydration to 11% for cardiopulmonary arrest. The equipment available in a pediatrician's office was significantly related to the type of primary work setting. Pediatrician confidence in managing the initial stabilization of emergencies ranged from 58% for seizures to 25% for epiglottitis. Confidence was related significantly to year residency was completed, Advanced Cardiac or Advanced Pediatric Life Support training, work setting, and the availability of equipment in the office. Continuing education regarding initial office management of and equipment for common emergencies should improve the pediatrician's confidence and competence in this area. 
The bottom end. Handling of the perineal wound after abdominoperineal resection. There are a number of options for handling the perineal wound following abdominoperineal resection, including open packing or primary closure with suction drainage. Open packing has not been widely accepted, fearing that it may delay perineal wound healing. The purpose of this paper, therefore, was to retrospectively evaluate, the experience at Ferguson Hospital with abdominoperineal resection from 1977 through 1986. The study population consisted of 288 patients undergoing abdominoperineal resection for rectal adenocarcinoma. Forty-six patients had the perineal wound closed primarily and 242 had the perineal wound packed open. Ninety-four patients had the pelvic peritoneum left open and 194 underwent closure of the pelvic peritoneum. Overall operative mortality was 2.1 per cent, and there was no significant difference between primary closure and open packing of the perineal wound with respect to hospital stay, operating time, operative blood loss, perioperative mortality, incidence of postoperative bowel obstruction, incidence of postoperative complications, or average time for perineal wound healing. Therefore, it would appear that packing the perineal wound following abdominoperineal resection is a viable means of handling the bottom end. 
Safe and rapid palliation of dysphagia for carcinoma of the esophagus. Patients with carcinoma of the esophagus continue to present late when their tumors are inoperable. This makes palliation of their dysphagia the main therapeutic aim. The Nd-YAG laser has been used in our department to treat dysphagia resulting from cancer of the esophagus since 1986. Our rapid, one-stage cannulation technique using the Nd-YAG laser in both contact and noncontact modes was applied to 35 cases of carcinoma of the esophagus with the aim of achieving rapid and safe palliation of dysphagia. During the treatment we aimed not to coagulate the tumor and await sloughing, but to vaporize the tumor and ablate as much as possible in a single session. In this way there was less need for repeat sessions to create an adequate lumen. In a small number of patients (9) who had tight strictures with no visible lumen, a pre-laser dilation was required to allow visualization of the lumen and tumor vaporization. For nondilated patients (26) we achieved a 15-mm lumen in an average of 1.6 sessions, and in the dilated patients (9) this was achieved in one session in all patients. Functional improvement occurred in 28 patients (80%). There were four minor complications and no mortality associated with the procedure. 
Brainstem compression by basilar artery anomalies as visualized by MRI. The use of MRI in the diagnosis of vascular anomalies of the basilar artery is demonstrated in two cases. The first patient had a partially thrombosed giant aneurysm of the basilar artery; the second had an atypical course of the basilar artery. MRI is indicated whenever other imaging procedures do not provide a definite diagnosis or the use of contrast medium for conventional X-ray examination or computed tomography is contraindicated. 
Restenosis after coronary angioplasty: an overview. Despite substantial basic and clinical efforts to address the problem of restenosis after percutaneous coronary intervention, effective preventive therapies have not yet been developed. Nevertheless, the accumulated information has provided much insight into the process of restenosis in addition to allowing standards to be developed for adequate clinical trials. The pathophysiology of restenosis increasingly appears to be distinct from that of primary atherosclerosis. Restenosis involves elastic recoil, incorporation of thrombus into the lesion and fibrocellular proliferation in varying degrees in different patients. Lack of an animal model that satisfactorily mimics restenosis is a major impediment to further understanding of the process. Clinical studies are hampered by difficulties in finding a single unifying definition of restenosis and by variable methods of reporting follow-up. Reporting of clinical outcomes of all patients in angiographic substudies would allow a more satisfactory interpretation of the results of clinical trials. Current noninvasive test results are not accurate enough to substitute for angiographic and clinical outcome data in intervention trials. In the majority of observational studies, only diabetes and unstable angina have emerged as consistently associated with restenosis; whereas most of the standard risk factors for atherosclerosis have a less consistent relation. Disappointingly, the new atherectomy and laser technologies have not affected restenosis rates. The one possible exception is coronary stenting, as a result of the larger luminal diameter achieved by the placement of the stent. In conclusion, although substantial continued effort is necessary to explore the basic aspects of cellular proliferation and mechanical alteration of atherosclerotic vessels, attention to the principles of clinical trials and observation are required to detect the impact of risk factors and interventions on the multifactorial problem of restenosis. Adequate sample sizes, collection of clinical and angiographic outcomes and factorial study designs hold promise for unraveling this important limitation of percutaneous intervention. 
Obstruction of the infrarenal portion of the abdominal aorta: results of treatment with balloon angioplasty. Our experience in the treatment of stenoses of the infrarenal portion of the abdominal aorta with balloon angioplasty in 27 patients is reported. Clinical findings were lower limb claudication (all patients), impotence (eight patients), and blue-toe syndrome (two patients). The underlying disease was atherosclerosis in 24 patients and nonspecific aortoarteritis in three patients. Dilatation was successful in all patients. Embolic occlusions of the left common iliac artery (one patient) and left superficial femoral artery (one patient) were the only major complications. Claudication in the affected limb continued in the first patient; the second died when diagnostic angiography, performed 3 months after angioplasty, caused a severe atheroembolus. Of the other 25 patients, nine of the 10 followed up for 13-48 months and all seven followed up for 3-8 months were free of symptoms. Six of eight patients with sexual dysfunction had normal function after angioplasty. Seven patients still awaited follow-up and one was lost to follow-up. Our experience suggests that balloon angioplasty is an effective treatment of stenoses of the infrarenal portion of the abdominal aorta. 
A new look at postoperative instructions following cataract extraction. We sought to determine whether, given the decreasing rate of complications associated with cataract surgery and IOL implantation, postoperative restrictions placed on patients undergoing these procedures could be significantly and safely relaxed. We reviewed the charts of 216 patients who had undergone capsulorhexis or "can-opener" capsulotomy, phacoemulsification, and insertion of an oval IOL over a 3-year period, noting any operative or postoperative complications. All of these patients had been examined the day after surgery and, if no complications were noted, had been instructed only to refrain from activities that produced pain. No shield was required, and no instructions were given to restrict showering, hair washing, or any other normal physical activity. We found no complications related to any postoperative activity. These results suggest that current postoperative instructions typically restricting such patients' activities should be reevaluated. 
Coronary thrombosis: pathogenesis and clinical manifestations. The majority (greater than 75%) of major coronary thrombi are precipitated by a sudden rupture of the surface of an atherosclerotic plaque (plaque fissuring) causing platelet aggregation where thrombogenic subendothelial tissue has been exposed. Whether the thrombus remains mural and limited, just sealing the rupture, or evolves into an occlusive thrombus seems to depend on: (1) the amount and character of exposed thrombogenic material; (2) the actual thrombotic-thrombolytic equilibrium; and (3) local flow disturbances due to preexisting atherosclerotic stenosis. Thrombus formation may take place within the stenosis, where blood velocity and shear forces are highest, or it may take place or extend poststenotically, where flow separation, recirculation, and turbulence prevail. Platelet aggregation within the stenosis is responsible for the primary flow obstruction, but fibrin subsequently enmeshes the platelets and thus stabilizes the thrombus. Most thrombi have a layered structure, indicating an episodic growth that may alternate with thrombus fragmentation and peripheral embolization: thrombosis and thrombolysis are dynamic processes occurring simultaneously. If the platelet-rich thrombus at the rupture site evolves into an occlusive thrombus, the blood proximal and distal to the occlusion may stagnate and coagulate, giving rise to a secondarily formed red stagnation thrombosis consisting predominantly of erythrocytes held together by fibrin membranes. A ruptured plaque with a dynamic thrombosis superimposed (with or without spasm) seems to underlie the great majority of acute ischemic syndromes: unstable angina, acute infarction, and sudden death. The clinical presentation and the outcome depend on the severity and duration of ischemia: whether the obstruction is occlusive or nonocclusive, transient or persistent--modified by the magnitude of collateral flow. 
Ultrastructural and immunohistochemical features of coronal adenomas. We studied by electron microscopy three coronal adenomas discovered incidentally in eyes removed surgically. Tumor cells displayed prominent intercellular interdigitations with numerous desmosomes, mitochondria, abundant rough endoplasmic reticulum, and nuclei with membrane infoldings and a granular chromatin pattern. In these characteristics, the tumor cells were identical to nonpigmented ciliary epithelium of the ciliary processes. These growths contained abundant extracellular material, which showed a dimorphic pattern of complex reduplicated basal lamina and granular areas without structure. Immunohistochemical studies on formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded coronal adenomas demonstrated type IV collagen and laminin in the extracellular material. These findings confirm that coronal adenomas develop from nonpigmented ciliary epithelium and that the extracellular material of these tumors contains components normally present in basement membranes. 
The intraoperative management of the thyroid gland during laryngectomy. The standard of care of laryngeal cancer surgery is wide field excision of the larynx combined with ipsilateral thyroid lobectomy. A retrospective review of 247 laryngectomies performed between 1979 and 1989 was undertaken to determine specific intraoperative indications for thyroid gland removal. The incidence of thyroid disease in our patients with laryngeal cancer was compared to the normal population. Eight percent of thyroid specimens removed during laryngeal cancer surgery demonstrated invasion by squamous cell carcinoma. All patients having thyroid invasion had T3 or T4 laryngeal lesions that were stage IV at the time of surgery. All these lesions were found to have transglottic growth and laryngeal cartilage invasion by the pathologist. All of these patients also had abnormal thyroid glands intraoperatively and laryngeal cartilage destruction that was evident intraoperatively. Total thyroidectomy with bilateral paratracheal and pretracheal lymph node dissection is indicated when squamous cell carcinoma of the larynx involves the thyroid gland. Prophylactic ipsilateral thyroid lobectomy and isthmusectomy is warranted for large laryngeal cancers (T3, T4) that involve the anterior commissure, the subglottic area, or extend transglottically. Routine thyroid gland removal is not indicated for the majority of laryngeal cancers that do not meet the aforementioned criteria. Finally, abnormal thyroid histopathology was diagnosed in 37% of the surgical thyroid gland specimens removed during laryngectomy. 
Human hepatocyte growth factor in blood of patients with fulminant hepatic failure. I. Clinical aspects. The levels of human hepatocyte growth factor (hHGF) in sera obtained from patients with various liver diseases were determined using adult rat hepatocytes maintained in primary culture. The mean hHGF activity for 22 patients with fulminant hepatic failure was about nine times greater than that found in normal human serum. The increase in serum hHGF activity seen in two patients with "acute-on-chronic" hepatitis was similar to that found in patients with fulminant hepatic failure. The serum level of hHGF from patients with acute hepatitis is related to the stage of their illness. The average value for 31 patients was about three times that of normal human serum. In some patients, the time course for the increase in serum hHGF activity was similar to that demonstrated for alpha-fetoprotein. The mean hHGF activity in serum for the 33 patients with chronic hepatitis and from 25 patients with liver cirrhosis was increased also compared with that of normal human serum. In addition, serum hHGF activity in three of seven patients studied after partial hepatectomy for a space-occupying lesion of the liver was increased. These data suggest that the increase in serum hHGF activity present in patients with various liver diseases reflects a self-defense mechanism that is involved in the process of liver cell regeneration. 
DNA methylation profiles in the human genes for tumor necrosis factors alpha and beta in subpopulations of leukocytes and in leukemias. The genomic sequencing technique has been applied to assess the state of methylation in the DNA from human leukocyte subpopulations from healthy individuals and in the DNA from several individuals with myeloid or lymphatic leukemias or non-Hodgkin lymphomas. Leukocyte populations were purified by the high-gradient magnetic cell sorting technique. In the human tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha) gene segment between nucleotides 300 and 1150, the specific methylation profile in the DNA from human granulocytes and monocytes is maintained in three cases of myeloid leukemia. In one such case, all 5-methyl-2'-deoxycytidine residues have been replaced by cytidine. In a chronic lymphatic T-cell leukemia, all 5-methyl-2'-deoxycytidine residues have been substituted by cytidine. In normal B lymphocytes, in two cases of chronic lymphatic B-cell leukemias and two cases of non-Hodgkin lymphomas, all 5'-CG-3' sequences in this gene segment are devoid of methylation. In the TNF-beta gene, DNA methylation is decreased in several examples of acute or chronic myeloid leukemias in comparison to normal human granulocytes or monocytes, whose DNA is almost completely methylated between nucleotides 700 and 900. In human T and B lymphocytes, the main producers of TNF-beta, in three instances of chronic lymphatic leukemias and two cases of non-Hodgkin lymphomas, all 5'-CG-3' sequences are unmethylated in this region. The DNA from the human HeLa cell line is highly methylated at all 5'-CG-3' sequences in the TNF-alpha and -beta genes. The TNF-alpha gene is transcribed in the cells of one case of acute myeloid leukemia in which the analyzed region of the TNF-alpha gene is completely unmethylated. The TNF-beta gene is not transcribed in any of the malignant cells tested. 
Childhood sexual abuse in patients with paradoxical vocal cord dysfunction. We present three prototypical cases of paradoxical vocal cord dysfunction. The symptoms of this functional disorder mimic those of bronchial asthma attacks. These patients typically have experienced extensive medical intervention including intubation and corticosteroid use. We identify a history of childhood sexual abuse as an important factor contributing to the development of this psychosomatic disorder. We discuss the severity of psychopathology in patients with paradoxical vocal cord dysfunction and how this physical symptom may have developed to express psychological difficulties. 
Gastrointestinal transit of solid-liquid meal in chronic alcoholics. Gastric emptying, mouth-to-cecum transit, and whole-gut transit of a solid-liquid meal were measured in 46 chronic alcoholics and in 30 control subjects by using scintigraphic techniques, hydrogen breath test, and stool markers. In the alcoholics various parameters such as ethanol consumption, gastrointestinal symptoms, and alcoholic neuropathy were determined and related to gastrointestinal transit times. Although there was no significant overall difference of gastric emptying, abnormally delayed gastric emptying was detected in 23.9% of the alcoholics but no control subject (P less than 0.005). Mouth-to-cecum transit was significantly prolonged in the alcoholics (P less than 0.001) with 14 alcoholics (37.8%) disclosing delayed mouth-to-cecum transit. No significant differences between both groups were detected concerning whole gut transit. In the alcoholics there was a significant correlation of dyspeptic symptoms with delayed gastric emptying (P less than 0.006), and alcoholics with diarrhea had an accelerated mouth-to-cecum transit as compared to those without diarrhea (P less than 0.05). Neither the presence of autonomic or peripheral neuropathy nor the presence of liver cirrhosis or ascites was significantly related to gastrointestinal transit times. However, the daily ethanol ingestion significantly correlated with gastric emptying (P less than 0.005). It is concluded, therefore, that in chronic alcoholics the small intestine and the stomach are most likely to be affected by gastrointestinal transit disorders and that these transit abnormalities are potentially related to toxic damage of gastrointestinal smooth muscle. 
Partial, non-thrombotic, superior sagittal sinus occlusion due to occipital skull tumours. Two cases are described in which raised intracranial pressure occurred as a result of superior sagittal sinus (SSS) occlusion by an occipital skull tumour. One was a plasmacytoma, the other a metastatic deposit from a Ewing's sarcoma. The difficulties in diagnosis of this syndrome are illustrated together with the importance and success of appropriate treatment. From the literature it appears possible that these two tumours may be particularly likely to occlude the SSS and the reasons for this are discussed. 
Magnetic resonance imaging vs palpation of cervical lymph node metastasis. In a series of 100 patients with head and neck carcinoma, the preoperative histopathologic findings of palpation and magnetic resonance imaging were compared with regard to both laterality and lymph node level (I through V). The overall error for palpation in detecting affected sides was 32%. Gadolinium-enhanced magnetic resonance images reliably upgraded 60% of the clinically negative necks, the overall error of magnetic resonance imaging being 16%. However, for both modalities, the sensitivity per level was too low to allow for selective neck dissections in case of only one positive level. These findings show that apart from primary tumor grading, magnetic resonance imaging can improve the preoperative grading of cervical lymph nodes. In selected cases, this may change the treatment plan to a "wait-and-see" policy or a more conservative type of neck dissection. 
Fatal disseminated hemorrhagic toxoplasmic encephalitis as the initial manifestation of AIDS. A 28-year-old woman presented with progressive coma after being asymptomatic for 1 year after the demonstration of seropositivity for human immunodeficiency virus and high serum immunoglobulin G toxoplasma titers. Computed tomographic scanning showed multiple rounded cerebral hemorrhages and massive cerebral edema. Postmortem examination disclosed Toxoplasma gondii cysts scattered throughout the brain. An overwhelming fatal toxoplasmosis associated with multiple cerebral hemorrhages may be the first presentation of the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome. We raise the possibility that frequent neuroradiological monitoring may be indicated in asymptomatic human immunodeficiency virus-infected patients with high immunoglobulin G toxoplasma titers. 
Thrombolysis in postinfarction angina. Postinfarction angina carries a poor prognosis, with a 20-70% incidence of recurrent myocardial infarction (MI) or death within the subsequent 3-6 months. The pathophysiologic mechanisms causing postinfarction angina may include thrombus, complex coronary arterial lesions that form a nidus for thrombus formation, inadequate collateral supply following acute MI, or intimal endothelial dysfunction. The role of thrombus has been established in the pathophysiology of Q-wave MI, and thrombolytic treatment of patients presenting with acute transmural MI has been shown to salvage left ventricular function and to reduce mortality. However, thrombolytic therapy for the acute MI does not reduce the incidence of recurrent ischemia or infarction, as is evident from the 18-26% incidence of recurrent ischemia reported in the Thrombolysis and Angioplasty in Myocardial Infarction (TAMI) and Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction (TIMI) trials. In the Gruppo Italiano per lo Studio della Streptochinasi nell'Infarto Miocardico (GISSI) study the incidence of reinfarction was documented as 4% in the streptokinase group, which was actually significantly greater than in the placebo group (2%). In a randomized placebo-controlled study of thrombolysis for postinfarction angina, 29 patients were randomized to placebo (P group, n = 17) or to thrombolytic therapy (T group, n = 12). Patient groups were similar with respect to age, location of MI, ejection fraction, severity of coronary artery disease, and antianginal therapy. Patients underwent coronary angiography 6 +/- 1 days postinfarction. Filling defects consistent with intracoronary thrombus was seen in 11 of 12 T group patients and in 11 of 17 P group patients prior to treatment. Lysis occurred in 7 of 11 T patients and 1 of 11 P (p less than 0.02). Holter-detected silent ischemia was compared pre- and posttherapy. 
Topical amethocaine in strabismus surgery. A randomized study was performed to assess the effect of topical 1% amethocaine hydrochloride on postoperative analgesia requirements after strabismus surgery. Forty children scheduled for elective operation were allocated randomly to receive either topical amethocaine or normal saline. Postoperative analgesia was evaluated with the use of a four-point assessment score and analgesic requirements. The topical amethocaine provided significantly better postoperative analgesia (p less than 0.001) as measured by both the assessment score and the postoperative analgesia requirement. 
Diffuse Lewy body disease presenting with a supranuclear gaze palsy. A patient with diffuse Lewy body disease presented with supranuclear vertical and horizontal ophthalmoplegia, dementia, axial rigidity and falls, bradykinesia and pyramidal signs. This broadens the clinical presentation of this pathological diagnosis and re-emphasises the heterogeneity of patients diagnosed clinically as progressive supranuclear palsy (Steele-Richardson-Olszewski syndrome). 
Chemotherapy compared with bone marrow transplantation for adults with acute lymphoblastic leukemia in first remission. OBJECTIVE: To compare efficacy of intensive postremission chemotherapy with allogeneic bone marrow transplantation in adults with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) in first remission. DESIGN: Retrospective comparison of two cohorts of patients. SETTING: Chemotherapy recipients were treated in 44 hospitals in West Germany in two cooperative group trials; transplants were done in 98 hospitals worldwide. PATIENTS: Patients (484) receiving intensive postremission chemotherapy and 251 recipients of HLA-identical sibling bone marrow transplants for ALL in first remission. Patients ranged from 15 to 45 years of age and were treated between 1980 and 1987. MAIN RESULTS: Similar prognostic factors predicted treatment failure (non-T-cell phenotype, high leukocyte count at diagnosis, and 8 or more weeks to achieve first remission) of both therapies. After statistical adjustments were made for differences in disease characteristics and time-to-treatment, survival was similar in the chemotherapy and transplant cohorts: Five-year leukemia-free survival probability was 38% (95% CI, 33% to 43%) with chemotherapy and 44% (CI, 37% to 52%) with transplant. No specific prognostic group had a significantly better outcome with one treatment compared with the other (6% for the difference; CI, -3% to 15%). Causes of treatment failure differed: With chemotherapy, 268 (96%) failures were from relapse and 11 (4%) were treatment-related; with transplants, 43 (32%) failures were from relapse and 92 (68%) were treatment-related. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that bone marrow transplants currently offer no special advantage over chemotherapy for adults with acute lymphoblastic leukemia in first remission. 
Intravenous adenosine in the emergency department management of paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia. STUDY PURPOSE: To evaluate the efficacy of adenosine in the treatment of emergency department patients with spontaneous paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia (PSVT). DESIGN: An eight-month prospective outcome study. POPULATION: Patients 16 or more years old with PSVT by surface ECG criteria. Patients were excluded if there was clinical or hemodynamic evidence of hypoperfusion. MEASUREMENTS: Patient age, sex, PSVT rate, pretreatment blood pressure, history of cardiac disease, chronic drug therapy, and response to IV adenosine. RESULTS: Twenty-three patients with 27 episodes of suspected PSVT met inclusion criteria. After IV adenosine, two patients were found to have atrial flutter, and one was found to have ventricular tachycardia. Twenty-four episodes of PSVT were diagnosed in the remaining 21 patients. There were eight male and 13 female patients with a mean age of 51 +/- 19 years (range, 16 to 80 years). Sixteen patients related a history of cardiovascular disease. The mean QRS rate during PSVT was 181 +/- 23. Twenty-three of 24 episodes (96%) were converted to sinus rhythm within 20 to 45 seconds of adenosine therapy. However, 13 of 23 of initial conversions (57%) were followed by recurrence of PSVT within five minutes. All 13 recurrences required therapy with other antiarrhythmic drugs for conversion to and maintenance of sinus rhythm. Complications of adenosine were noted in only four patients and were transient and clinically unimportant. CONCLUSION: IV adenosine effectively terminates PSVT in ED patients with spontaneous PSVT; recurrence of PSVT after adenosine is common in the ED population and should be treated with other antiarrhythmic agents, not repeated doses of adenosine; adenosine is useful in the differential diagnosis of tachyarrhythmias; and doubling the initial dose of adenosine to 12 mg would increase the likelihood of conversion with the first dose. 
Diagnostic imaging of heterotopic ossification with coexistent deep-venous thrombosis in flaccid paraplegia. Heterotopic ossification and deep-venous thrombosis can coexist. This raises potential problems because diagnosis depends heavily on imaging studies, and an ideal imaging study which will cost-effectively and noninvasively diagnose both conditions simultaneously is not readily available. A case of coexistent heterotopic ossification and deep-venous thrombosis in flaccid paraplegia is presented. In this case, deep-venous thrombosis and pulmonary embolus were diagnosed and treatment was begun without knowledge of the coexistent heterotopic ossification. Alternative imaging and laboratory diagnostic strategies are discussed. It was concluded that, at this time, clinical acumen and judicious use of traditional diagnostic alternatives is the best means of selecting appropriate treatment. Awareness of the coexistence of the two conditions are careful attention to the patient's clinical course can minimize treatment delays and resultant morbidity. 
Primary carcinoid of the common bile duct. Immunohistochemical characterization of a case and review of the literature. A 39-year-old woman with a primary carcinoid of the common bile duct is presented. The tumor showed argyrophilia; and, by immunohistochemical studies, chromogranin, serotonin, and somatostatin were demonstrated. The patient has no symptoms 42 months after surgical treatment. To the authors' knowledge, this is the first report of a carcinoid of the common bile duct as studied by immunohistochemistry. When six choledochal carcinoids were reviewed, the following characteristics were observed: in none of the cases were endocrine symptoms present; women were affected more frequently than men; the carcinoids occurred in younger patients than did adenocarcinomas; metastases were present in half of the patients; and, as a group, carcinoids seemed to have a better prognosis than adenocarcinomas in this location. 
Human insulin and awareness of acute hypoglycaemic symptoms in insulin-dependent diabetes. Some insulin-dependent diabetic patients who have clear symptoms of hypoglycaemia during animal insulin treatment have reported loss of these symptoms when human insulin preparations are introduced. A survey of Mersey Region, UK, identified eleven patients whose awareness of hypoglycaemia was lost after introduction of human insulin but returned with animal insulin treatment; seven took part in the study. Acute hypoglycaemia was induced in these patients on two occasions by intravenous infusion of porcine or human soluble insulin (2.5 mU.kg-1, min-1) in random order. There was no significant difference between porcine and soluble insulin in the plasma glucose profile; mean (SEM) plasma glucose fell from 7.1 (0.4) mmol/l to a nadir of 1.5 (0.1) mmol/l with porcine insulin and from 7.1 (0.5) mmol/l to 1.6 (0.2) mmol/l with human insulin. An acute autonomic reaction occurred in all seven patients, at a similar plasma glucose concentration (1.9 [0.1] mmol/l with porcine insulin; 2.0 [0.2] mmol/l with human insulin). There were no significant differences in the frequency of symptoms or signs of hypoglycaemia between the two insulin species, nor any consistent differences in plasma glucagon, cortisol, growth hormone, adrenaline, or noradrenaline responses to hypoglycaemia. Symptomatic and hormonal responses to acute hypoglycaemia induced by porcine and human soluble insulins therefore seem to be almost indistinguishable, even in patients carefully selected for their apparent loss of hypoglycaemia awareness with human insulin. 
Multivariate clinical models and quantitative dipyridamole-thallium imaging to predict cardiac morbidity and death after vascular reconstruction. Patients with peripheral vascular disease have a high prevalence of coronary artery disease and are at increased risk for cardiac morbidity and death after vascular reconstruction. The present study was undertaken to assess the value of 18 clinical parameters, of 7 clinical scoring systems, and of quantitative dipyridamole-thallium imaging for predicting the occurrence of postoperative myocardial infarction or cardiac death. Vascular surgery was performed in 125 patients. Thirteen postoperative cardiac events occurred, including 10 cardiac deaths and 3 nonfatal infarctions. Clinical parameters were not useful in predicting postoperative outcome. All 63 patients with normal scan results or fixed perfusion defects underwent surgery uneventfully, whereas 21% (13/62) of patients with reversible defects had a postoperative cardiac complication. By use of quantitative scintigraphic indexes we found that patients with reversible defects could be stratified into intermediate and high-risk subgroups with postoperative event rates of 5% (2/47) and 85% (11/13), respectively, despite intensive postoperative monitoring and antianginal medication. Thus in patients unable to complete a standard exercise stress test, postoperative outcome cannot be predicted clinically, whereas dipyridamole-thallium imaging successfully identified all patients who had a postoperative cardiac event. By use of quantification we found that patients with reversible defects can be stratified into an intermediate risk subgroup that can undergo surgery with minimal complication rate and a high-risk subgroup that requires coronary angiography. 
Progressive vs single-stage treadmill tests for evaluation of claudication. The reliability of claudication pain and the metabolic and hemodynamic measurements of the lower limbs of patients with stable peripheral vascular occlusive disease (PVOD) were compared during and following single-stage (S) and progressive (P) treadmill tests. Ten patients (69.8 +/- 1.8 yr; X +/- SE) walked to maximal claudication pain twice a month for 4 months. Patients walked at 1.5 mph up a 7.5% grade (S test) and at 2 mph on a 0% grade, increasing by 2% every 2 min (P test). Distance walked to the onset of claudication pain (CPD) and maximal walking distance (MWD) were recorded. Foot transcutaneous oxygen tension (TcPO2) was measured before, during, and after exercise, while ankle systolic blood pressure (SBP) and the ankle-to-brachial SBP index (ABI) were measured before and after exercise. Intraclass correlation coefficients (R) of CPD and MWD during S tests were R = 0.53 and R = 0.55, respectively. In contrast, the respective R values during P tests were R = 0.89 and R = 0.93. Higher R values of foot TcPO2 were also obtained during and following P tests, while ankle SBP and ABI were highly reliable following both tests. It is concluded that the severity of PVOD is better assessed by P treadmill tests because clinical measurements are more reliable during exercise and recovery.
