Positive direct antiglobulin tests in myeloma patients. Occurrence, characterization, and significance. Review of direct antiglobulin testing (DAT) in 88 patients with multiple myeloma (MM) and five with Waldenstrom's macroglobulinemia revealed 26 cases with a positive DAT. Twenty-two of these had immunoglobulin G-M protein, three had light chain MM, and one had immunoglobulin A-MM protein. None of the immunoglobulin GD-MM (n = 2), nonsecretory MM (n = 5), or Waldenstrom's macroglobulinemia patients (n = 5) were positive. None of the patients had hemolysis attributable to the adsorption of the M protein. The serum concentration of M protein was higher in DAT-positive patients (57.6 +/- 3.8 g/L, mean +/- SEM) than in the negative ones (35.7 +/- 6.4 g/L; probability value of the difference was less than 0.01). The erythrocyte eluates from DAT-positive patients contained a single immunoglobulin, of the same class as the M protein, and did not react with a panel of ABO-compatible erythrocytes. Addition of melphalan during incubation did not affect the results. The M protein of DAT-positive patients was of immunoglobulin G-3 subclass in 7 of 10 patients. A positive direct antiglobulin test frequently is seen in patients with multiple myeloma, the reaction is due to passive adsorption of the M protein onto the erythrocytes, is most frequently observed with immunoglobulin G3-MM, and usually does not produce hemolysis. 
The importance of surface immunoglobulin, mouse rosettes, and CD5 in the immunophenotyping of chronic lymphocytic leukemia and reactive lymphocytosis. Peripheral blood from 167 B-chronic lymphocytic leukemia (B-CLL) and 119 reactive lymphocytosis (RLC) patients were analyzed to evaluate the immunophenotypic diagnostic value of mouse rosettes (M-rosette), and weak expression of monoclonal surface immunoglobulin (SIg). In B-CLL, 145 cases were M-rosette+ (86.83%), 135 surface immunoglobulin (SIg)+ (80.84%), and 117 M-rosette+ SIg+ (70.06%). Of 32 SIg- cases, 28 were M-rosette+; and of 22 M-rosette-cases, 18 were SIg+. By combining results of the two assays and accepting positivity of either one or both as sufficient for diagnosis, B-CLL was diagnosed in 163 cases (97.60%). CD5 was performed in 49 cases of the 167 with paired data for SIg and M-rosettes. By combining the results of the three assays and accepting positivity of any two or all three as sufficient for diagnosis, all 49 cases (100%) were diagnosed. Correlation analysis showed no significant association between M-rosette, SIg, and CD5 expression. The results demonstrate the independent expression of the three markers, and their complementary role in immunophenotyping B-CLL. In RLC, all 119 cases were T-lineage and SIg-, and 115 were M-rosette-, indicating the role of the two markers in differentiating B-CLL from RLC. Three of the four M-rosette+ T-RLC were subsequently diagnosed as B-CLL, suggesting the necessity of follow-up of such cases. 
Class II-restricted presentation of an endogenously derived immunodominant T-cell determinant of hen egg lysozyme. An in vitro model was used to investigate the potential for different structural forms of endogenous antigen to be processed and presented by major histocompatibility complex class II molecules. For this purpose the class II-restricted presentation of an immunodominant epitope of hen egg lysozyme [HEL-(46-61)] was studied in class II-positive B-lymphoma cells (M12.C3) transfected with genes encoding HEL molecules either (i) secreted in high (hi) or low (lo) amounts as soluble antigen [sHEL(hi/lo)], (ii) localized within the endoplasmic reticulum (ER)/salvage compartment (ER-HEL), or (iii) anchored on the cell surface as an integral membrane protein (mHEL). The corresponding sHEL, ER-HEL, and mHEL gene products were expressed as predicted except that HEL determinants accumulated in the culture supernatant as well as on the cell membrane of mHEL-transfected cells. Class II-positive cells endogenously expressing all three forms of HEL antigen constitutively presented the immunodominant HEL-(46-61) determinant with differential efficiency (mHEL, sHEL greater than ERHEL) to a class II-restricted T hybridoma. A second T hybridoma recognized endogenous HEL-(46-61) determinants constitutively presented on sHEL(hi) and mHEL transfectants but not on sHEL(lo) or ERHEL transfectants. The formation of HEL-(46-61)/I-Ak complexes in the ERHEL and sHEL(lo) transfectants was therefore limiting. Mixing experiments with different antigen-presenting cells indicated that the HEL-(46-61) determinant was derived from endogenous antigen rather than by reuptake of shed or secreted HEL determinants. We conclude that MHC class II molecules can present some antigenic determinants derived from endogenous proteins that are sequestered in the ER/salvage compartment as well as distally transported in the form of secretory or membrane antigens. 
Thoracoscopic diagnosis and treatment of chylothorax after pneumonectomy. Chylothorax after pneumonectomy was treated successfully by selective application of fibrin glue through a thoracoscope. Conservative therapy for 18 days failed to close the fistula. The site of leakage was identified during thoracoscopy, and fibrin glue was applied under direct vision. Leakage decreased immediately and eventually stopped completely. This technique is less invasive than standard surgical treatment and should be considered in all patients with postoperative chylothorax. 
Strategy for management of distal ileal Crohn's disease. We have determined the outcome of a defined policy for the management of distal ileal Crohn's disease using a prospective computer-based analysis of 139 patients diagnosed between 1970 and 1988 with a mean follow-up of 10 years. The policy in outline consists of conservative treatment for acute obstructive episodes, resection or strictureplasty for recurrent obstructive episodes, surgical treatment for abscess and fistula formation and specific medical treatment (corticosteroids, immunosuppressive therapy or metronidazole) for symptomatic non-obstructive disease. Twenty-nine patients had a benign course without resection. The remainder were treated surgically at some time but only 28 of these patients had specific treatment before operation. Thirty-three needed more than one resection and five needed more than three surgical procedures. Immediate, early or delayed surgical treatment did not affect the reoperation rates or the long-term outcome. Eleven patients died, ten of causes unrelated to Crohn's disease. Of the 128 living patients, 114 are fit and well, and only two are currently taking specific medication. Fourteen are unwell of whom six either need or have refused further surgery which could restore them to good health. This management policy has achieved excellent long-term results in nearly all patients, and our findings suggest that the timing of surgery and its nature are more important in determining outcome than specific medical therapy. 
The modified buccal musculomucosal flap method for cleft palate surgery. We have reported previously on a palatoplasty method, called the T-shaped musculomucosal buccal flap method, for the primary repair of a cleft palate. This method has been used on more than 90 patients, and satisfactory outcomes have resulted in terms of maxillar development, the prevention of fistulation, and verbal functions. However, 14.3 percent of these patients exhibited a velopharyngeal incompetence that showed no potential improvement through training. In the majority of these patients, the entire raw surface of the oral cavity side could not be covered with a buccal musculomucosal flap, and as a result, postoperative contraction of the soft palate occurred. Thus a new surgical method has proven effective in which both buccal musculomucosal flaps are used as an oral lining, the nasal mucosa having been extended by Z-plasty. We have performed 25 operations using this new method and have observed no postoperative contractions of the soft palate, notwithstanding two cases (8.0 percent) of postoperative fistulation. 
Comparative studies of extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy by Dornier HM3, EDAP LT 01 and Sonolith 2000 devices. During a 2-year period extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy (ESWL) was done at our institution in 70 patients with the Dornier HM3, 113 with the EDAP LT 01 and 104 with the Sonolith 2000 lithotriptors. The size and location of stones were comparable in all 3 series, and all treatments were done by the same team of urologists. Complete fragmentation occurred in 79% of the patients treated by the Dornier, 82% treated by the EDAP and 79% treated by the Sonolith devices, with 3-month stone-free rates of 66, 67 and 58%, respectively. Auxiliary procedures were needed in 12% of the patients in the Dornier, 13% in the EDAP and 9% in the Sonolith groups. Repeat treatment was necessary in 4% of the Dornier group, 42% of the EDAP group and 26% of the Sonolith group. Therefore, all 3 lithotriptors are effective in stone disintegration and produce satisfactory results when selection criteria for ESWL are observed. The most significant difference among the 3 lithotriptors is the number of repeat treatments, which reflects the power and energy output of the lithotriptors. In conclusion, the Dornier HM3 device has the advantage of low repeat treatment rate and easier stone localization. The EDAP LT 01 unit has the advantage of lower treatment costs and anesthesia-free treatment with no irradiation. The Sonolith 2000 device has features of the other 2 lithotriptors with a superior ultrasound image. 
A systematic consideration of the neoplastic spectrum of AIDS: registry linkage in Illinois. To examine unexplored aspects of the association between AIDS and neoplasia, the Illinois AIDS and Cancer Registries were linked. The method integrated use of a personal computer to find exact matches on names and dates of birth with manual review to assure satisfaction of a match definition. Of the factors examined, white race and homosexuality predicted Kaposi's sarcoma (KS) among people with AIDS (PWAs), and white race predicted non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL). Earlier reports of a declining proportion of PWAs with KS were confirmed. Lymphoma (mixed lymphocytic/histiocytic type), while not currently diagnostic of AIDS, occurred more frequently among PWAs than in the Illinois population. For the first time, rates of cancers other than KS and NHL were demonstrated to be significantly increased among PWAs compared with general populations. In the light of these findings, reconsideration of current neoplastic definitions may be useful. 
Chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyradiculoneuropathy of childhood: treatment with high-dose intravenous immunoglobulin. We treated four children with chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyradiculoneuropathy (CIDP) with high-dose intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG). All patients received 400 mg/kg of IVIG a day for 5 days during relapses, and one patient received additional periodic infusions of 400 mg/kg. All patients showed excellent recovery of motor strength following each relapse that was treated with IVIG. Compared with plasmapheresis (which was used to treat relapses earlier), recovery of function with IVIG treatments was similar, and in two patients it was superior, to plasmapheresis. There were no side effects with IVIG treatments as compared with plasmapheresis with which two children had infection of central lines with Staphylococcus epidermidis, one had profuse bleeding from accidental extrusion of a central line, and one had multiple episodes of major venous thromboses. High-dose IVIG was a safe and effective adjunctive therapy for childhood CIDP in these four patients. 
Experience with laser-assisted balloon angioplasty and a rotary angioplasty instrument: lessons learned. Favorable early results with mechanical angioplasty devices and laser-assisted balloon angioplasty have resulted in aggressive marketing and a rapid increase in the use of these devices for the treatment of femoropopliteal occlusive disease. Recent reports, however, have questioned the durability of these less invasive procedures. Since 1986 we have been involved in the clinical investigation of the Kensey dynamic angioplasty instrument and laser-assisted balloon angioplasty. One hundred two balloon angioplasty procedures assisted by the Nd:YAG laser (n = 56) and the Kensey dynamic angioplasty instrument (n = 46) were performed for the treatment of femoropopliteal occlusive lesions. Both Kensey dynamic angioplasty instrument and laser-assisted balloon angioplasty groups were similar with regard to age, operative indication, preoperative ankle-brachial index, lesion length, and distal runoff. Mean follow-up was 19 months in the Kensey dynamic angioplasty instrument group and 15 months in the laser-assisted balloon angioplasty group. Technically successful recanalization was achieved in 67% of Kensey dynamic angioplasty instrument-assisted balloon angioplasty procedures and 82% of laser-assisted balloon angioplasty procedures. Early hemodynamic and clinical improvement was obtained in 59% of Kensey dynamic angioplasty instrument-assisted balloon angioplasty procedures and 57% of laser-assisted balloon angioplasty procedures. Two-year clinical success by life-table analysis was 37% in the Kensey dynamic angioplasty instrument group and 19% in the laser-assisted balloon angioplasty group. The level of subsequent surgical revascularization was not altered in any patient by Kensey dynamic angioplasty instrument-assisted balloon angioplasty or laser-assisted balloon angioplasty. 
Passive immunoprophylaxis after liver transplantation in HBsAg-positive patients. 110 HBsAg-positive patients underwent orthotopic liver transplantation and received long-term anti-hepatitis B virus (HBV) passive immunoprophylaxis with anti-HBs immunoglobulin. During a mean follow-up period of 20 months, all patients became HBsAg negative after transplantation but circulating HBsAg reappeared in 25 (22.7%). Overall 1-year survival was 83.6% and overall 2 year actuarial recurrence of HBsAg was 29% (59% after posthepatitis B cirrhosis, 13% after posthepatitis B-delta cirrhosis, and 0% after fulminant hepatitis B). Patients with HBV cirrhosis who were HBV-DNA positive had a much greater risk of HBsAg recurrence than patients who were HBV-DNA negative (96% vs 29% at 2 years). Reappearance of HBsAg was associated with evidence of HBV replication and abnormal histological findings in the graft. Long-term passive anti-HBV immunoprophylaxis significantly reduced HBV reinfection and improved survival in patients without evidence of active HBV replication before orthotopic liver transplantation. 
Differential activation within costal diaphragm during rapid-eye-movement sleep in cats. Simultaneous recordings of the diaphragmatic electromyogram (EMG) were made from two separate regions of the costal diaphragm in six normal cats. The diaphragmatic activities were always synchronous and the amplitudes and rates of rise were similar during slow-wave sleep. In contrast, during natural rapid-eye-movement (REM) sleep, different activity was often present in the two leads. These differences were in the time of onset and offset, as well as in the amplitude and spike patterns, and occurred in approximately 5-20% of the diaphragmatic bursts averaged over the entire REM sleep period. With respect to eye movement density, the rate of differential activation was higher during periods of high density (26%) than in the absence of eye movements (1%) in the four animals for which these data were available. Differential activation of portions of the costal diaphragm is apparently a normal event of REM sleep. This could result from descending state-specific phasic neuronal activity that bypasses the medullary respiratory generator. Differential activation of portions of the diaphragm could contribute to disordered ventilation during REM sleep. 
Posttraumatic headache and the postconcussion syndrome. Although headache is the most common sequelae of head injury, the posttraumatic headache is associated frequently with dizziness, irritability, lack of concentration, and intolerance to alcohol ingestion as a part of a symptom complex known as the postconcussion syndrome. This article clarifies the definitions of acute traumatic headache, posttraumatic headache, and the postconcussion syndrome and improves diagnostic ability, making the assessment and treatment of patients with these three conditions more accurate and effective. 
Characterization of interactions of enteropathogenic Escherichia coli O127:H6 with mammalian cells in vitro. Previous studies have identified two bacterial factors involved in enteropathogenic Escherichia coli (EPEC) infection. A plasmid-mediated EPEC adherence factor (EAF) is responsible for initial and localized adherence. A chromosomally encoded E. coli attachment and effacement factor (eae) is involved in effacement of the eukaryotic cell surface and characteristic "pedestal" formation. By using isogenic strains deficient in either EAF, eae, or both, the process of EPEC adherence and entry in vitro was examined. While EAF proved necessary and sufficient for efficient bacterial association with HEp-2 cells, both EAF and eae were required for efficient effacement of and entry into these cells and other cultured cell lines. Invasion mediated by eae was markedly inhibited by cytochalasin D and colchicine. Afimbrial adhesion or type I pili from uropathogenic strains of E. coli substituted for EAF in EAF-Eae+ strains to provide initial adherence to HEp-2 cells and to facilitate actin condensation. 
Who will operate on Africa's 3 million curably blind people? About half the 6 million blind people in sub-Saharan Africa have surgically curable cataract. The available manpower and resources can only provide services for less than 10% of the new blind cataract patients each year, and little is being done for the estimated 3 million "cataract backlog". A serious limiting factor to the development of prevention of blindness programmes is lack of trained manpower. Despite an increase in the number of ophthalmologists trained in cataract surgery (which varies greatly from country to country), this number is not keeping pace with increased demand for eye-care services, especially in large rural populations. Initiatives that will help to overcome this dilemma are specific post-graduate courses in community ophthalmology in Africa, plans to develop a one-year diploma in ophthalmology course for English-speaking West African countries, and a proposal to upgrade a similar course in Zimbabwe. Additionally there is a need for the training of more ophthalmic assistants, cataract surgeons, and nurses in the diagnosis and management of common ophthalmic disorders. Experienced expatriate ophthalmologists also have an important role in the teaching of doctors and ophthalmic assistants how to select patients and carry out successful inexpensive cataract surgery with appropriate technology and limited facilities. 
Ectopic pituitary adenoma in the suprasellar cistern: case report. The case of a 56-year-old man with an ectopic pituitary adenoma is reported. Neurological examinations, neurodiagnostic imaging, surgical observation, endocrinological evaluation, histological examination, and immunohistological study demonstrated evidence of ectopic prolactinoma in the suprasellar cistern and the presence of a normal pituitary in the sella turcica. The patient underwent total removal of the suprasellar mass by a pterional approach, leading to a surgical and endocrinological cure. 
Two cases of neoplastic angioendotheliomatosis presenting with myelopathy. We describe two patients with autopsy-proven neoplastic angioendotheliomatosis (NAE) presenting only as a transverse myelopathy for 10 to 12 months, followed by disseminated intracranial manifestations. Postmortem examination disclosed a vasculocentric distribution of neoplastic cells in various organs that stained positively with B-lymphocyte-specific monoclonal antibody. These cases were unusual because they manifested as an isolated myelopathy for many months. 
Treatment of esophageal varices: low versus high dose of 5% ethanolamine oleate. Twenty-four patients, undergoing sclerotherapy for esophageal varices, were injected with 10-20 ml of ethanolamine oleate 5% in the first treatment session (group A). Fourteen patients were injected with 40 ml of the same sclerosant in the first session (group B). Retrospective analysis was carried out to evaluate the efficacy and safety of the two doses. Variceal eradication was achieved in group B in significantly fewer sclerotherapy sessions. Rebleeding occurred in 16% of patients in group A, compared with no rebleeding in group B. There was no significant difference in the incidence of various complications. We conclude that the use of 40 ml of 5% ethanolamine oleate in the first session is more effective and as safe as the use of 20 ml of the same sclerosant. 
Endothelium-dependent responses of cerebral blood vessels during chronic hypertension. Acetylcholine produces less dilatation of pial arterioles in stroke-prone spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHRSP) than in normotensive (WKY) rats. Responses of cerebral vessels to acetylcholine and bradykinin appear to involve different mechanisms. Our first goal was to determine whether responses of pial arterioles to bradykinin are impaired in SHRSP. Diameter of pial arterioles (20-60 microns) was measured using intravital microscopy in WKY rats and SHRSP (9-12 months old). Superfusion of bradykinin (3 x 10(-7) M) dilated pial arterioles by 35 +/- 6% (mean +/- SEM) in WKY rats, but only 21 +/- 3% in SHRSP (p less than 0.05 versus WKY rats). Both nitric oxide (5 x 10(-7) M) and nitroglycerin (10(-5) M) produced similar vasodilatation in WKY rats and SHRSP. Our second goal was to determine whether alteration of postreceptor mechanisms contributes to impairment of endothelium-dependent cerebral vasodilatation in SHRSP. Calcium ionophore A23187 (10(-5) M) produced more vasodilatation in WKY rats than in SHRSP (32 +/- 8% versus 9 +/- 4%, p less than 0.05). Responses to A23187 (10(-5) M) were inhibited by indomethacin (46 +/- 13% versus 15 +/- 5%, p less than 0.05) in WKY rats, whereas responses to A23187 (10(-6) M) were potentiated modestly by indomethacin (-3 +/- 2% versus 4 +/- 2%, p less than 0.05) in SHRSP. 
Primary malignant melanoma of the gasserian ganglion associated with neurofibromatosis. A case of primary intracranial malignant melanoma of the left gasserian ganglion associated with temporal lobe gliosis in a patient suffering from von Recklinghausen's disease is reported. The association of primary malignant melanoma of the trigeminal nerve and neurofibromatosis is discussed. 
Lymph node counts in the upper abdomen: anatomical basis for lymphadenectomy in gastric cancer. The number of regional lymph nodes was determined in sites relevant to lymphadenectomy in gastric cancer in 30 cadavers. Tissue was cleared by dissolving fatty tissue, thus making lymph nodes with a diameter of at least 1 mm visible. All lymph node stations indicated by the Japanese Research Society for Gastric Cancer were studied. In stations 1-11 (corresponding with R2 resection) an average of 27 nodes (range 17-44 nodes) was found, whereas stations 1-16 (corresponding with R3 resection) showed an average of 43 nodes (range 25-64 nodes). These values are higher than those usually obtained from lymphadenectomy for gastric cancer. Striking individual differences in the total number of lymph nodes and the number of single stations was observed. The number of lymph nodes in these investigations are the normal anatomical values and serve as quality control of lymph node dissection in gastric carcinoma. 
Gamma-interferon promotes proliferation of adult human astrocytes in vitro and reactive gliosis in the adult mouse brain in vivo. Reactive gliosis is a characteristic response of astrocytes to inflammation and trauma of the central nervous system. To investigate whether soluble factors (cytokines) from inflammatory mononuclear cells that accumulate at lesion sites can provide the cellular signals to initiate gliosis and to identify such cytokines, we have tested and found that supernatants derived from subsets of activated human T lymphocytes (CD8+ or CD4+) are potent mitogens for cultured human adult astrocytes. This effect is blocked by a neutralizing antibody to gamma-interferon (IFN). Recombinant IFN alone can induce proliferation of human adult astrocytes in vitro and increase the extent of trauma-initiated gliosis in the adult mouse brain. The astrocyte proliferation-inducing activity of supernatants of glial cultures treated with IFN can be completely blocked with IFN-neutralizing antibody, suggesting that the proliferative effect does not require intermediary cytokines or cells. These results implicate IFN as an important mediator of the gliosis observed in pathologic conditions of the adult central nervous system associated with infiltrating lymphocytes. 
Clinically significant pneumatosis intestinalis with postoperative enteral feedings by needle catheter jejunostomy: an unusual complication. We evaluated the incidence of clinically significant pneumatosis intestinalis and intestinal necrosis with the use of needle catheter jejunostomy in 217 consecutive patients who had undergone complicated abdominal operations or selected bariatric procedures. The needle catheter jejunostomy was used to deliver immediate postoperative nutrition, maintenance, and replacement fluids, and selected medications. In this group, no serious complications requiring surgical intervention were related to the use of needle catheter jejunostomies. Clinically significant pneumatosis intestinalis was encountered in two of 217 patients (1%). With the needle catheter jejunostomy in place, both patients improved rapidly when enteral feedings were discontinued and parenteral antibiotics were administered. None of the 217 patients developed ischemic intestinal necrosis. We conclude that 1) clinically significant pneumatosis is a rare complication of enteric feeding via needle catheter jejunostomy when the intrajejunal feeding is begun with a diluted, hypoosmolar solution with stepwise increases in osmolality, and 2) patients who do develop clinically significant pneumatosis (n = 2) seem to respond rapidly to a temporary stoppage of enteral feedings and administration of parenteral antibiotics. 
Facial nerve and medially invasive petrous bone cholesteatomas. Eight patients with extensive petrous bone cholesteatomas that invaded the labyrinth and fallopian canal are presented. The eight cases are added to a tabulation of prior literature reports to elucidate concepts of routes of extension of medially invasive temporal bone cholesteatoma. Medially invasive petrous bone cholesteatoma develops insidiously, often without symptoms other than facial palsy and/or unilateral deafness. Typically, a history of chronic ear disease can be obtained. While hearing is unlikely to be preserved in this group of patients, facial nerve function can usually be preserved, and a facial nerve graft was not necessary in our series. Acute facial nerve palsy or facial nerve paresis progressing to palsy in patients with a history of chronic ear disease should be studied radiographically for petrous bone cholesteatoma, even if there is no physical evidence of cholesteatoma. 
Controlled trial of 2, 4, and 6 months of pyrazinamide in 6-month, three-times-weekly regimens for smear-positive pulmonary tuberculosis, including an assessment of a combined preparation of isoniazid, rifampin, and pyrazinamide. Results at 30 months. Hong Kong Chest Service/British Medical Research Council In a study in Hong Kong 1,386 Chinese patients with sputum smear-positive pulmonary tuberculosis were allocated at random to four 6-month regimens of chemotherapy, all given three times weekly from the start and all containing isoniazid (H) and rifampin (R) throughout. Three contained streptomycin (S) for the first 4 months and pyrazinamide (Z) for 2 months (Z2), 4 months (Z4), or 6 months (Z6); the fourth contained pyrazinamide for 6 months but no streptomycin (Z6noS). Every dose of all four regimens was given under the direct supervision of clinic staff on a predominantly outpatient basis. During the later part of the intake patients were allocated at random to be given their HRZ either as a combined formulation (Rifater), each tablet containing 125 mg isoniazid, 100 mg rifampin, and 375 mg pyrazinamide, or as the three drugs separately. Among 892 assessable patients with drug-susceptible strains of tubercle bacilli pretreatment, bacteriologic failure during chemotherapy occurred in 4, all Z6noS (2% of 224; p less than 0.005 for the comparison with the S-containing regimens). During 30 months of follow-up after the end of chemotherapy, bacteriologic relapse occurred in 2 (3%) of 71 Z2, 2 (3%) of 72 Z4, 4 (6%) of 66 Z6, and 6 (9%) of 64 Z6noS patients allocated to Rifater, and in 4 (3%) of 149 Z2, 8 (6%) of 133 Z4, 2 (1%) of 142 Z6, and 6 (4%) of 135 Z6noS patients allocated to separate drugs. In the relapse rates there were no significant differences between the Rifater and separate drug regimens, the different durations of pyrazinamide, or the regimens with and without streptomycin. 
Failure of initial 24-hour esophageal pH monitoring to predict refractoriness and intractability in reflux esophagitis. Prolonged esophageal pH monitoring is considered to be the most sensitive and specific test for the diagnosis of gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD). However, the role of pH monitoring in predicting the clinical and endoscopic response of reflux esophagitis is not well defined. In this study, 106 patients with moderate to severe symptoms of GERD and esophagitis (grades 0-IV) by endoscopy were initially studied by ambulatory esophageal pH monitoring, and their clinical response to standard H2 antagonist therapy was monitored at 8 wk. Refractory patients were defined as those who failed to heal and/or had intractable reflux symptoms after 8 wk of H2 antagonist therapy, and who required continuous therapy with higher doses of H2 antagonists, addition of prokinetic agents, or omeprazole. There was a positive correlation (r = 0.89) between endoscopic severity of esophagitis upon entry into the study and refractoriness to standard medical therapy. However, there were no differences in the various pH parameters analyzed between the 58 patients who responded and the 48 patients who were refractory to medical therapy, regardless of the endoscopic grading of their esophagitis. We conclude that 24-h ambulatory esophageal pH monitoring does not predict refractoriness of reflux esophagitis to standard therapy. The decision for more aggressive methods of treatment probably requires assessment of symptomatic and endoscopic response after 8 week standard H2 antagonist therapy. 
Ultrastructural morphometry of gastric endocrine cells before and after omeprazole. A study in the oxyntic mucosa of duodenal ulcer patients. Long-term toxicological experiments with inhibitors of acid secretion were found to induce hyperplasia and eventually carcinoid tumors of the enterochromaffin-like cells of the oxyntic mucosa. To evaluate the effects of 6 months' treatment with omeprazole in humans, the oxyntic endocrine cells were morphometrically investigated at the ultrastructural level in five patients with active duodenal ulcer. No omeprazole-induced changes were found in the volume density of the total endocrine cell population and specific cell types (including the enterochromaffin-like cell) as well as in the other cytological parameters investigated (number of cell profiles per unit area, mean cross-sectional area of cell profiles, nuclear-cytoplasmic ratio, and density of cytoplasmic secretory granules). Both pretreatment and post-treatment values in our patients with duodenal ulcer significantly differed from those of a previous investigation of healthy volunteers with regard to the volume density of enterochromaffin-like cells and non-granulated cells, which increased, and of D cells, which markedly decreased. The latter result may provide a cellular basis for impairment in the paracrine release of fundic somatostatin in peptic ulcer disease. Finally, morphometric data on endocrine cell volume density provided by electron microscopy were found to correlate with those obtained in the same patients using light microscopy techniques (Grimelius silver impregnation and chromogranin A immunostaining). It is concluded that 6 months' treatment with pharmacological doses of omeprazole is devoid of appreciable trophic effect on endocrine cells of human oxyntic mucosa. 
Fate of patients with acute myocardial infarction with patency of the infarct-related vessel achieved with successful thrombolysis versus rescue angioplasty. Patients with failure of infarct-related artery recanalization after thrombolytic therapy have a poor clinical outcome. These patients have been considered for rescue angioplasty 90 min after thrombolytic therapy at the time of emergency catheterization in the course of five Thrombolysis and Angioplasty in Myocardial Infarction (TAMI) trials. The outcome of 776 patients with patent infarct-related vessels after emergency catheterization was analyzed--607 with thrombolysis-mediated patency of the infarct-related vessel and 169 with patency achieved by angioplasty. Baseline characteristics of the thrombolysis and angioplasty patency groups were similar except for a higher acute left ventricular ejection fraction (51.3% versus 48.2%) in the thrombolysis group (p = 0.003). Seven to 10 day left ventricular ejection fraction was higher (52.3% versus 48.1%), infarct zone functional recovery was greater (0.44 versus 0.21 standard deviation/chord, or 18% versus 7%, p = 0.001) and reocclusion was less (11% versus 21%) in the thrombolysis compared with the angioplasty group. Despite these differences, angioplasty patency was associated with the same low in-hospital mortality rate (5.9% versus 4.6%) and long-term mortality rate (3% versus 2%) as thrombolysis patency. Reocclusion adversely affected the mortality rate and ventricular functional recovery. Technical failure of rescue angioplasty was associated with a much higher mortality rate than was technical success (39.1% versus 5.9%). Thrombolysis patency was preferable to angioplasty patency after thrombolytic therapy in acute myocardial infarction, but both were associated with the same low in-hospital and long-term mortality rates, suggesting that rescue angioplasty is beneficial in some patients with failure of infarct-related artery recanalization after thrombolytic therapy. 
Exploring the molecular basis for variability among patients with Becker muscular dystrophy: dystrophin gene and protein studies. Becker muscular dystrophy (BMD) often results from in-frame mutations of the dystrophin gene that allow production of an altered but partially functional protein. To address potential structure-function relationships for the various domains of dystrophin, we examined both the dystrophin gene and protein in 68 patients with abnormal dystrophin. Eighty-six percent of BMD patients with dystrophin of altered size have deletions or duplications, and the observed sizes of dystrophin fit well with predictions based on DNA data. Deletions within the amino-terminal domain I tended to result in low levels of dystrophin and a more severe phenotype. The phenotypes of patients with deletions or duplications in the central rod domain were more variable. This region can be divided into three portions based on differences in clinical presentations of patients. Deletions around exons 4553 were most common and generally caused typical BMD; however, phenotypic variability among patients with similar mutations suggests that epigenetic and/or environmental factors play an important role in determining the clinical progression. In contrast, deletions or duplications in the proximal portion of this domain tended to cause severe cramps and myalgia. Finally, loss of the middle of this region probably causes a very mild phenotype, as only one such patient was found and his only symptom was elevated serum creatine phosphokinase levels. 
Anterior urethral polyp associated with hematuria in six-year-old child. Anterior urethral polyps are rare, occur only in male patients, and have been associated with obstruction, terminal hematuria, and enuresis. We believe this is the fifth reported case of anterior urethral polyp associated with terminal hematuria. The radiographic findings, treatment, and pathology are reviewed. 
Percutaneous stimulation of the cauda equina. A new diagnostic method in spinal stenosis. A study to determine the feasibility of measurement of conduction velocities through the lumbosacral nerve roots by direct percutaneous stimulation of the cauda equina is reported. The technique was applied to a series of normal volunteers and its reliability and reproducibility confirmed. An electrophysiologic defect was demonstrated in most patients with surgically proven lateral recess stenosis. Electrophysiologic recovery was shown in patients examined after surgery. Although the technique can be refined, these early results are encouraging. 
Reducing the risk of stroke: identifying patients to refer for carotid endarterectomy. The most common causes of stroke are two diseases of aging: hypertension and atherosclerosis. Therefore, although stroke may occur at any age, the incidence is highest among the elderly population. Noninvasive efforts to reduce the risk of stroke in the elderly include control of hypertension and diabetes, smoking cessation, low-cholesterol dietary habits, and moderate exercise. Routine low-dose aspirin also provides some protective effect. High-risk patients (with asymptomatic high-grade stenosis, TIAs, or prior stroke) should be considered candidates for carotid endarterectomy in the absence of contraindications to surgery. 
Comparison of 1 or 3 MU of interferon alfa-2b and placebo in patients with chronic non-A, non-B hepatitis. Ninety patients with histologically documented chronic non-A, non-B hepatitis were randomly allocated to receive SC injections of placebo or of 1 or 3 MU of recombinant interferon alfa-2b three times weekly for 24 weeks. Complete normalization of alanine aminotransferase levels occurred posttreatment in 43.3% of patients receiving 3 MU, in 20% of those receiving 1 MU, and in 6.7% of untreated patients (P less than 0.0005 vs. those treated with 3 MU). Alanine aminotransferase normalization was sustained for 6 months after therapy in 13.3% of the patients treated with 3 MU and in 3.3% of those given 1 MU or placebo. The decline of alanine aminotransferase levels following interferon therapy showed independent, positive correlations with female sex (P less than 0.03) and younger age (P less than 0.05). The Knodell's fibrosis score was strongly positively correlated with age (P less than 0.0001). It is concluded that 3 MU of interferon is a more effective dose than 1 MU for controlling disease activity in non-A, non-B chronic hepatitis patients. Women and younger and noncirrhotic patients are more likely to respond. 
Angiographic management of retroperitoneal hemorrhage from renal angiomyolipoma in polycystic kidney disease. Angiographic management of bilateral angiomyolipomas complicated by hemorrhage in autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease is presented. The patient had mild stigmata of tuberous sclerosis, and a family history of tuberous sclerosis and autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease. The radiographic features at diagnosis, and those present during and after embolization are described. Radiological criteria for diagnosis and successful control of bleeding with intra-arterial selective embolization are discussed. Radiographic features before, during and after embolization are exhibited. 
Paraplegia in a pregnant thalassemic woman due to extramedullary hematopoiesis: successful management with transfusions. The investigation and treatment of a pregnant thalassemic woman who developed severe paraplegia is presented. Magnetic resonance imaging showed a paravertebral mass infiltrating the epidural space, resulting from extramedullary hematopoiesis (marrow heterotopia). The patient was treated successfully with repeated blood transfusions and made a complete recovery. The literature (36 cases) is reviewed and the magnetic resonance imaging features of spinal extramedullary hematopoiesis are presented. The efficacy of transfusions in the management of spinal cord compression due to marrow heterotopia in thalassemic patients is discussed. 
Hypertension following erythropoietin therapy in anemic hemodialysis patients. Recombinant human erythropoietin (rHuEpo) corrects the anemia of end-stage renal disease. However, hypertension has been observed as an adverse effect of increasing red cell mass. In our study, 44 of 63 patients (70%) treated with rHuEpo had an increase in mean arterial pressure greater than 10 mm Hg or required new or additional hypertensive medications. Retrospective analysis disclosed that increasing blood pressure was associated with pretreatment hematocrit level less than or equal to 0.20 (P = .05) and dependency on red cell transfusions (P less than .01). Factors not associated with hypertension included the rate of rise of the hematocrit, the net rise in hematocrit, age, sex, the number of years on dialysis, the presence or absence of kidneys, smoking, or the presence of pretreatment hypertension. Noninvasive hemodynamic studies in eight normotensive patients before and after improvement of the anemia demonstrated a normalization of the decreased peripheral vascular resistance and a reduction toward normal in the elevated cardiac output. In three of these patients, clinical hypertension subsequently evolved. Follow-up hemodynamic studies in nine other patients receiving new or additional antihypertensive medications were difficult to interpret. Although the hypertension can be controlled with routine medication, hypertensive encephalopathy may occur if the blood pressure increases rapidly when the hematocrit increases with rHuEpo therapy. 
Is craniospinal irradiation required to cure children with malignant (anaplastic) intracranial ependymomas? Between 1970 and 1989, 17 children with histologically malignant intracranial ependymomas received treatment at the University of Pennsylvania (Philadelphia, PA). Eleven were treated with prophylactic cranial or craniospinal irradiation plus a local boost (CS-XRT), five with local (L-XRT) irradiation only, and one was treated without (NRT) irradiation. With a median survival of 2 years and a median follow-up time for long-term survivors of 6.0 years, five of 11 patients who received CS-XRT are alive compared with none treated with L-XRT and none treated with NRT. Two-year actuarial survival rates are 40% (L-XRT) and 52% (CS-XRT). When examined for other factors, age and local radiation dose remain the most significant prognostic indicators of survival. The 2-year actuarial survival for children younger than 4 years at diagnosis is 20% compared with 83% for their older counterparts. Likewise, the 2-year survival for patients treated with local radiation doses over 4500 cGy was 55% compared with 0% for patients treated with lesser doses. To date there are a total of 28 recurrences. All have occurred with local components except for six (unknown) who died before the exact site(s) could be determined. There is no significant difference in the failure rates outside the original tumor bed in the three groups. These data suggest that local relapse remains the most significant component of failure. Because intrinsic and extrinsic factors such as age and radiation dose seem to be interrelated and at least as important as the use of craniospinal irradiation, the need for prophylactic treatment for children with anaplastic ependymoma could neither be substantiated nor refuted. The use of local radiation alone, however, should be restricted to carefully designed clinical trials in which meticulous pretreatment evaluation is performed, and vigilant posttreatment evaluation of the spine and brain is mandatory. 
Increased free light chains in the urine from patients with multiple sclerosis. We quantitated free kappa (kappa) and lambda light (L) chains in coded urine specimens from subjects with clinically definite multiple sclerosis (MS) (N = 56), other neurologic diseases (OND) (N = 30), and age-matched normal controls (N = 28). Urine from MS patients showed statistically significant increases in free L chains compared with the other groups, although there was overlap between MS patients and OND patients. The ratio of kappa/creatinine was significantly greater in the relapsing-remitting MS group than in patients with clinically stable MS, OND, and normal controls. Elevated free L chains were usually independent of urinary albumin and beta 2-microglobulin levels. Serial studies showed that urinary free kappa/creatinine ratios were elevated during periods of clinical worsening in seven of eight MS patients and subsequently decreased during clinical recovery. The measurement of free L chains in urine obtained at intervals from MS patients may be useful as a marker to monitor disease activity. 
The interaction of plasminogen activator inhibitor 1 with plasminogen activators (tissue-type and urokinase-type) and fibrin: localization of interaction sites and physiologic relevance. Plasminogen activator inhibitor 1 (PAI-1), an essential regulatory protein of the fibrinolytic system, harbors interaction sites for plasminogen activators (tissue-type [t-PA] and urokinase-type [u-PA]) and for fibrin. In this study, anti-PAI-1 monoclonal antibodies (MoAbs) were used to identify interaction sites of PAI-1 with these components. The binding sites of 18 different MoAbs were established and are located on five distinct "linear" areas of PAI-1. MoAbs, binding to two distinct areas of PAI-1, are able to prevent the inhibition of t-PA by PAI-1. In addition, two interaction sites for fibrin were identified on PAI-1. The area located between amino acids 110 and 145 of PAI-1 contains a binding site for both components and its significance is discussed in the context of the t-PA inhibition by fibrin-bound PAI-1. Subsequently, the MoAbs were used to assess the role of platelet-PAI-1 in clot-lysis. An in vitro clot-lysis system was used to demonstrate that clot-lysis resistance is dependent on the presence of activated platelets and that PAI-1 is a major determinant for lysis-resistance. We propose that, upon activation of platelets, PAI-1 is fixed within the clot by binding to fibrin and retains its full capacity to inhibit t-PA and u-PA. 
Granulomatous pulmonary zygomycosis in a patient without underlying illness. Computed tomographic appearances and treatment by pneumonectomy. Pulmonary zygomycosis rarely occurs in the absence of underlying disease. We report a patient with granulomatous pulmonary zygomycosis without underlying disease who presented with a pulmonary mass. We present the computed tomographic findings that we believe have not been described previously. We also report the successful treatment by pneumonectomy. 
Mucosal dysplasia and DNA content in ulcerative colitis patients with ileorectal anastomosis. Follow-up study in a defined patient group. In a follow-up study of an epidemiologically defined patient group comprising 1,274 patients with ulcerative colitis diagnosed in Stockholm County during 1955-1979, 55 patients had undergone colectomy with ileorectal anastomosis (IRA). Nine of these were found to have Crohn's disease after histopathologic review of the colectomy specimens. Of the 46 patients with ulcerative colitis remaining for evaluation, two died postoperatively. Twenty-five patients were subsequently reoperated with rectal excision owing to intractable inflammatory activity (n = 22, one postoperative death) or owing to dysplasia (n = 3). Of 19 patients with their IRA still intact at time of follow-up, 15 patients (median disease duration 23 years) had a flexible sigmoidoscopy with multiple biopsies performed. The average length of the remaining rectum and sigmoid colon was 26 cm. No patient had findings of dysplasia, carcinoma, or DNA aneuploidy. None of the four remaining patients had developed dysplasia or carcinoma at the time of the latest regular rigid sigmoidoscopy. The risk of malignant transformation in this selected group of patients with ulcerative colitis operated upon with colectomy and IRA derived from an epidemiologically defined population seems to be low. 
Is erythrokeratoderma one disorder? A clinical and ultrastructural study of two siblings. Two sisters with erythrokeratoderma are described. In the younger sister the clinical appearance corresponded to erythrokeratoderma variabilis (EKV), whereas in the older sister it corresponded to progressive symmetrical erythrokeratoderma (PSEK). Ultrastructural findings in both cases were identical. We suggest that EKV and PSEK are different manifestations of a single condition. 
Oral contraceptives increase insulin-like growth factor binding protein-1 concentration in women with polycystic ovarian disease. Insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I) stimulates ovarian androgen production. Insulin-like growth factor binding protein-1 (IGFBP-1) inhibits IGF actions in vitro. OBJECTIVE: To investigate the effect of oral contraceptive (OC) pills, given for 3 months, on serum gonadotropin, androgen, IGF-I, and IGFBP-1 concentrations, and glucose tolerance in seven women with polycystic ovarian disease (PCOD) and in five healthy control subjects. PATIENTS: Seven women with PCOD and five healthy control subjects. INTERVENTIONS: An oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) was performed before and after treatment with OC. RESULTS: After treatment with OC, serum luteinizing hormone, androstenedione, and free testosterone levels decreased, and sex hormone-binding globulin concentration increased in the women with PCOD as well as in the control subjects. The cumulative response of serum insulin to OGTT was larger in the women with PCOD than in the control subjects both before and after treatment. Serum IGF-I concentration, which was unchanged during OGTT, decreased from basal level of 326 +/- 70 micrograms/L to 199 +/- 28 micrograms/L after treatment with OC in the women with PCOD, whereas no change was found in the control subjects (from 235 +/- 11 micrograms/L to 226 +/- 11 micrograms/L). Treatment with OC caused an increase of the mean basal IGFBP-1 concentration from 24 +/- 7 micrograms/L to 73 +/- 14 micrograms/L in the women with PCOD. This increase was constant during the OGTT. In the control subjects, treatment with OC did not result in any significant change in IGFBP-1 concentrations (from 44 +/- 11 micrograms/L to 61 +/- 9 micrograms/L). CONCLUSION: The combination of decreased total IGF-I concentration and increased IGFBP-1 concentration induced by OC may decrease ovarian androgen production in PCOD. 
Immunohistochemical demonstration of CD23 expression on lymphocytes in rheumatoid synovitis. The leucocyte antigen CD23 is expressed by B lymphocytes following activation by a number of stimuli and functions as an IgE receptor, and in its soluble form, as a putative B cell growth factor. The expression of CD23 on the surface of lymphocytes in paraffin wax sections of synovial biopsy specimens was studied using a novel mouse monoclonal antibody, BU38. Specimens were investigated from nine cases of rheumatoid arthritis, six cases of osteoarthritis, and eight cases of chronic inflammation in articular and non-articular tissues. CD23 was expressed on a high proportion of lymphocytes in all forms of chronic inflammation and was not specific for rheumatoid arthritis. It may be a characteristic feature of any chronic inflammatory response. As CD23 was found on the surface of lymphocytes in many cases of these arthritides, sCD23 in serum or synovial fluid may yet prove a useful marker for the severity of the inflammatory infiltrate. 
Ulcerative colitis in the autotransplanted neovagina. A 33-year-old woman had undergone a radical surgical excision for carcinoma of the vagina at age 11. Vaginal reconstruction using a pedicled transplant of the sigmoid colon was successfully accomplished at age 19. Fourteen years later she developed vaginal bleeding, and a biopsy of the neovagina revealed changes consistent with ulcerative colitis. Within 2 weeks the patient developed bleeding per ano, and a rectal biopsy also revealed changes consistent with ulcerative colitis. Symptoms responded to sulfasalazine. This is believed to be the first case report of ulcerative colitis developing in colonic tissue used for a neovagina. The etiology, natural history, and surveillance of ulcerative colitis in relation to this unique case are reviewed. This case argues against the hypothesis that chronic ulcerative colitis is causally related to direct exposure to alimentary antigens. 
An atrial natriuretic factor analogue at low doses attenuates forearm reflex vasoconstriction to cardiopulmonary receptor deactivation in patients with hypertension. Contrasting data exist about a possible modulation of the autonomic function by atrial natriuretic factor (ANF) in human beings, particularly at low, biologically, significant concentrations. We have evaluated that possibility by increasing plasma ANF levels through the infusion of a synthetic analogue (WY-47,663, anaritide) in five male patients with mild to moderate uncomplicated hypertension. Nonhypotensive lower body negative pressure (-10 mm Hg x 5 min) was used to selectively deactivate cardiopulmonary receptors and to stimulate sympathetic efferent tone reflexogenically. ANF was given at either a low rate (0.005 micrograms/kg/min x 60 min, which was previously shown to increase plasma ANF in a range compatible with physiologic stimuli) or at a high rate (0.05 micrograms/kg/min x 60 min, each). Administration of ANF was preceded and followed by vehicle infusion (Haemacell x 30 min). Forearm blood flow (venous plethysmography), intraarterial blood pressure, and heart rate were monitored continuously, and venous immunoreactive ANF, plasma renin activity, aldosterone level, and venous hematocrit were measured at the end of both control and infusion periods. Arterial norepinephrine values, an indirect index of sympathetic discharge, were measured at rest and during lower body negative pressure conditions. Graded systemic ANF infusion increased immunoreactive ANF and venous hematocrit, decreased aldosterone level and plasma renin activity, whereas resting norepinephrine levels, blood pressure, and heart rate did not change. Lower body negative pressure decreased forearm blood flow during vehicle infusion, but it lost its vasoconstrictor effect during infusion of ANF. To identify the site of that inhibitory action, ANF was also infused into the brachial artery at rates that raised local but not systemic levels of immunoreactive ANF. 
Immunological evidence for the co-existence of the Lambert-Eaton myasthenic syndrome and myasthenia gravis in two patients. Two patients are described in whom a clinical and electromyographic diagnosis of the Lambert-Eaton myasthenic syndrome (LEMS) was made. Serum antibodies to voltage-gated calcium channels (VGCCs), the antigenic target in LEMS and to acetylcholine receptors (AChRs), the antigen in myasthenia gravis, were detected at raised titres in both cases, using radioimmunoassays based on 125I-omega-Conotoxin labelled VGCCs and 125I-alpha-Bungarotoxin labelled AChRs. These data provide immunological evidence for the coexistence of the two disorders in these patients. 
Fine-needle aspiration biopsy: application to pediatric head and neck masses. Fine-needle aspiration biopsy cytology is widely used to screen masses in adults. The authors present a series of 89 fine-needle aspiration biopsies performed between January 1973 and December 1988 on 86 pediatric patients with clinically significant head and neck masses. All fine-needle aspiration diagnoses were confirmed by subsequent surgical biopsy, autopsy, or clinical follow-up for a minimum of 18 months. Of 21 tumors identified, 19 were malignant. Of the 89 aspirations performed, 67 required no subsequent surgical biopsy. In 11 of these cases, metastatic or recurrent tumor was diagnosed and appropriate therapy instituted. Fifteen of the 89 aspirates revealed previously undiagnosed tumors requiring surgical intervention. One false-negative and two false-positive results were obtained. No radical treatment resulted from the false-positive diagnoses, and no patient delay in treatment occurred because of the false-negative result. The sensitivity was 94.4%, and the specificity was 97.1%. The usefulness and cost-effectiveness of fine-needle aspiration is stressed. 
Orthotopic cardiac transplantation in two patients with previous malignancy. This report presents 2 patients with previous malignancy in whom congestive cardiomyopathy developed secondary to doxorubicin toxicity. Both patients underwent orthotopic cardiac transplantation 3 and 5 years ago and are now in functional class I with no evidence of malignant recurrence. 
Priapism as a manifestation of isolated genital vasculitis. Vasculitis may affect virtually any organ system in the body. We describe a patient who presented with priapism due to isolated genital vasculitis. This responded promptly to oral corticosteroids. In patients presenting with priapism, a possible underlying vasculitis should be considered in the differential diagnosis; the treatment for this may be nonsurgical. 
Acute and chronic symptoms of mononucleosis. BACKGROUND. The clinical symptoms and durations of illness of patients with infectious mononucleosis (IM) are variable and are poorly documented in the scientific literature. METHODS. Patients who presented for care at the Student Health Service of a Canadian university between September 1985 and May 1988 and had been diagnosed as having IM were surveyed. Health experience during the acute and convalescent phases of IM was compared with that of a group of patients matched for age, sex, date of diagnosis, and year of study, who had suffered acute upper respiratory tract infections (URI), other than Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-induced, during the same period. RESULTS. Students were sicker for longer after IM than after non-EBV-induced URI. During the acute phase of illness, the symptoms of fatigue (P = less than .000001), night sweats (P = .000001), and painful neck swelling (P = .00003) were seen significantly more often in the IM group. The severity and duration of these symptoms were also significantly worse in IM patients. Getting tired easily (P = .002), diurnal somnolence (P = .002), and depression (P = .002) were significantly more common postacute symptoms. Eleven percent of IM patients reported persistence of symptoms longer than 100 days, and in 6% of patients the symptoms had persisted after 1 year. Convalescent cases showed a trend toward reduced alcohol intake and, perhaps, reduced alcohol tolerance. CONCLUSIONS. IM involves excessive morbidity in a student community compared with URI that was other than EBV-induced, during both the acute and the postacute phases of infection. 
Dynamic exercise-induced elevation in plasma levels of atrial natriuretic peptide in patients with effort angina pectoris. We investigated the relationship between plasma atrial natriuretic polypeptide (ANP) levels and hemodynamic indices during dynamic exercise testing in 15 patients with effort angina pectoris. Patients exercised on an angina-limited, supine, multistage bicycle ergometer, and plasma ANP levels and hemodynamic indices were measured at rest, at peak exercise, and 6 minutes after exercise. Plasma ANP levels increased significantly at peak exercise. Pulmonary artery wedge pressure (PAWP) and coronary sinus blood flow (CSBF) were significantly correlated with plasma ANP levels before and at peak exercise (PAWP: r = 0.69, p less than 0.001; CSBF; r = 0.45, p less than 0.05). In six of eight patients whose PAWP exceeded 20 mm Hg at peak exercise, plasma ANP levels were increased at 6 minutes after exercise, whereas PAWP had decreased relative to the values obtained at peak exercise. Plasma ANP concentrations at 6 minutes after exercise were not correlated with PAWP at the same time. However, PAWP at peak exercise was correlated with the plasma ANP levels at 6 minutes after exercise (r = 0.80, p less than 0.001). These results suggest that in patients with effort angina pectoris left ventricular dysfunction resulting from exercise-induced myocardial ischemia may increase preload excessively and may contribute to the excess secretion of ANP after dynamic exercise. 
Acute appendicitis in patients with AIDS/HIV infection. Nine patients known to have acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) and/or human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection and operated on for acute appendicitis are presented. Six of the nine patients did not have an elevation in the white blood cell count preoperatively. Two patients underwent diagnostic laparoscopy prior to exploration. In four cases, a perforated appendix was removed. Seven patients had persistent postoperative fever, while all nine had a significant lack of leukocytosis after surgery. Other than the absence of a preoperative increase in white blood cell count, the presenting characteristics of this group were similar to those expected in immunocompetent patients. However, concern for a possible opportunistic infection etiology and a desire to avoid operating on these patients resulted in an undue delay prior to exploration. The use of diagnostic laparoscopy aided in earlier and more accurate diagnosis. Despite persistent postoperative fever, appendectomy was performed in patients with AIDS/HIV infection without significant increase in morbidity and mortality. 
Changes in hypertension treatment and in congestive heart failure mortality in the United States. The use of antihypertensive agents has increased in recent years and has been more marked among individuals in older age groups (65-74 years) than in middle-aged groups (45-54 years). Because hypertension is a strong risk factor for the development of congestive heart failure, more common use of antihypertensive agents would be expected to reduce the incidence of congestive heart failure. Examination of the national death statistics reveals decreases in congestive heart failure mortality at younger ages with mortality increases at older ages. The reasons for these divergent trends in congestive heart failure mortality in different ages and the apparent inconsistency with respect to the changes in the use of antihypertensive drugs are explored. We speculate that antihypertensive treatment does not completely prevent congestive heart failure but merely postpones its development by several decades. 
Causes of death in patients with tuberous sclerosis. Of the 355 patients with tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) examined at the Mayo Clinic, 49 had died (9 of causes other than TSC). We attempted to determine what pattern of organ involvement occurred most often in the 40 patients who died of TSC. One baby died of cardiac failure due to cardiac rhabdomyomas, and one child died of rupture of an aneurysm of the thoracic aorta. Eleven patients died of renal disease, which was the commonest cause of death. Ten patients died as a result of brain tumors, and four patients (who were 40 years of age or older) died of lymphangiomyomatosis of the lung. Thirteen patients with severe mental handicaps died of either status epilepticus or bronchopneumonia; in all but one of these patients, the only source of information was the death certificate. Survival curves show a decreased survival for patients with TSC in comparison with that for the general population. Patients with TSC need lifelong follow-up for early detection of potentially life-threatening complications. 
Sigmoid sinus thrombosis diagnosis by contrasted MRI scanning. Septic thrombosis of the transverse-sigmoid sinuses and the jugular bulb is a highly lethal condition. The presenting signs and symptoms of this disease entity are subtle and not in proportion to the magnitude of the problem. Later in the disease course, sudden fulminant findings appear. A high index of suspicion, combined with scanning techniques of either enhanced MRI or CT, allows prompt diagnosis and treatment. MRI enhanced with gadolinium-DTPA (Gd) is a valuable adjunct that confirms the diagnosis and delineates the extent of suspected pathology. 
Coarctation and hypoplasia of the aortic arch: will the arch grow? Hypoplasia of the transverse aortic arch of various degrees of severity is commonly seen in infants who have coarctation of the aorta. It is more often present when the coarctation is associated with intracardiac lesions that diminish or limit forward flow in the ascending aorta and promote right to left flow through an arterial duct. The increased frequency of surgical treatment of infants with complex coarctation, which is in part related to the ability to stabilize their condition with prostaglandin E1, has posed the question of the potential for growth and development of the originally hypoplastic aortic arch after conventional repair of aortic coarctation. Review of our experience with transverse aortic arch hypoplasia, found in 33 (32%) of 102 infants undergoing coarctation repair by subclavian flap aortoplasty or classic resection and end-to-end anastomosis, revealed excellent growth of the transverse arch after repair in all patients available for linear follow-up. The currently proposed extended arch repair should be reserved for the small group of infants with transverse aortic arch to ascending aorta diameter ratios (arch indices) of less than 0.25. 
Mechanism of augmented left atrial pump function in myocardial infarction and essential hypertension evaluated by left atrial pressure-dimension relation. To analyze left atrial (LA) pump function in normal subjects, in patients with essential hypertension and in patients with a healed myocardial infarction, LA dimension (aortic-root echogram) and pressure (catheter-tip manometer) were simultaneously recorded in 25 patients (8 normal subjects, 7 with hypertension and 10 with myocardial infarction). The pressure-dimension relation of the left atrium was composed of 2 loops: the A loop (expressing the pump function of the left atrium) and the V loop. LA dimension at the beginning of active LA shortening was significantly greater in hypertensive subjects (33 +/- 3 mm) and in those with myocardial infarction (32 +/- 4 mm) than in normal subjects (28 +/- 3 mm) (p less than 0.01, p less than 0.05, respectively). The area of the A loop significantly increased in subjects with hypertension (48 +/- 3 mm Hg.mm, p less than 0.01) and in subjects with myocardial infarction (29 +/- 10 mm Hg.mm, p less than 0.05), compared with normal subjects (20 +/- 8 mm Hg.mm). The mean fractional shortening velocity of the left atrium significantly increased in subjects with hypertension, compared with normal subjects and those with myocardial infarction (p less than 0.05 for both). LA peak wall tension during the LA active contraction period significantly increased with hypertension and with myocardial infarction, compared with normal subjects (p less than 0.01, p less than 0.05, respectively). The area of the A loop was directly proportional to the LA dimension at the beginning of active LA shortening (r = 0.53), p less than 0.01). 
Observation of spinal canal and cisternae with the newly developed small-diameter, flexible fiberscopes. Small-diameter (0.5-, 0.9-, and 1.4-mm) flexible fiberscopes were developed for visual diagnosis of spinal canal diseases. The fiberscopes were introduced via a Tuohy needle into the subarachnoid and epidural spaces of ten patients with various pain syndromes. Clear visualization of the subarachnoid space was achieved using the fiberscopes. The epidural space could be visualized only during withdrawal of the fiberscope. In five cases, the fiberscope could be advanced up to the level of the cisternae without causing the patient any discomfort. A slight headache and transient fever were noted after the examination in five and two cases, respectively, but no other complications occurred. Interestingly, preexisting pain diminished (two cases) or disappeared (one case) after the myeloscopy in three of five cases in which the myeloscopy revealed aseptic adhesive arachnoiditis. Further studies should be carried out to evaluate the usefulness of this technique. 
Thickening at the root of the superior mesenteric artery on sonography: evidence of vascular involvement in patients with cancer of the pancreas. Thickening of the root of the superior mesenteric artery (SMA) was studied by using preoperative sonography in 23 patients with pancreatic cancer and in 10 healthy control subjects. Of the 23 with cancer, 11 had neoplastic involvement of the SMA and 12 did not. Prominent thickening of the area around the SMA with (six patients) or without (five patients) decreased echogenicity compared with the adjacent retropancreatic connective tissue was observed in patients with involvement of the SMA, a finding called the "cuff sign." Mean thickness of the periarterial area in the cancer patients with and without involvement of the SMA and in control subjects were 8.5 mm, 4.0 mm, and 2.9 mm, respectively. With an upper limit of normal of 7.0 mm for the thickness of the SMA, the sensitivity, specificity, and overall accuracy of this sign in the evaluation of involvement of the SMA were 91%, 100%, and 96%, respectively. Decreased echogenicity of the periarterial area was not observed in patients without involvement of the SMA or in control subjects. Our results show that sonographic evidence of periarterial thickening of the root of the SMA (cuff sign), especially with decreased echogenicity, is a reliable finding of tumor infiltration of the SMA in patients with pancreatic carcinoma. 
Masseter muscle spasm in children: implications of continuing the triggering anesthetic. This retrospective study was undertaken to examine the management and outcome of children who developed isolated masseter muscle spasm (MMS) after the administration of intravenous succinylcholine during anesthetic induction. The inhalation anesthetics used for induction were continued in all of these cases. The medical records of 68 patients (male/female ratio, 1.7:1), identified from approximately 42,000 anesthetics given during the period 1980-1989, were reviewed. Fifty-seven children (2.3-12 yr old) were diagnosed as having isolated MMS, i.e., MMS without spasm of other muscles; 11 experienced generalized rigidity in combination with MMS. Anesthetic and postoperative management of these two groups differed. The overall incidence of MMS was 0.3% of inhalation anesthetics during which succinylcholine was given. Intraoperative arrhythmias occurred in 33% of the patients who developed isolated MMS and more frequently in older children. Most children experienced some degree of hypercarbia and/or metabolic acidosis, but the significance of these abnormalities in the spontaneously ventilating, fasting child is unknown. Serum creatine kinase levels when measured 18-24 h postoperatively were elevated in all but one child (n = 45). There was no long-term morbidity and no mortality. We conclude that failure of the masseter muscles to relax after succinylcholine is not uncommon in children. Based on our experience, and accepting that MMS may be part of the clinical spectrum of malignant hyperthermia, we believe that anesthesia can be continued safely in cases of isolated MMS when careful monitoring accompanies diagnostic evaluation. This differs from the current practice of discontinuing the anesthetic or switching to a nontriggering anesthetic technique. 
Hemisphere asymmetry in decision making abilities. An experimental study in unilateral brain damage. Thirty control subjects and 60 unilateral brain-damaged patients, 30 with left hemisphere (LH) damage and 30 with right hemisphere (RH) disease, underwent a disjunctive 4-choice reaction time study. Speed of reaction (as defined by the reciprocal of reaction time (RT), movement time (MT) and total response time (TRT] and accuracy of response (as represented by the sum of errors in selecting the correct response key) were investigated comparatively as a function of side of lesion and of performance on Raven's Coloured Progressive Matrices (PM47). In contrast to movement speed (1/MT), reaction speed (1/RT) as well as total response speed (1/TRT) showed a lesion effect independent of side of damage. Conversely, accuracy was differentially impaired, LH damage being associated with a significantly higher number of errors. Speed and accuracy had different relationships with the performance on the PM47 in the two hemisphere groups. Speed was affected in parallel with changes in PM47 performance both in the LH and in RH groups, whereas accuracy was altered only in LH patients. It was concluded that speed of motor reaction is affected by unilateral brain lesions irrespective of their side, whereas decision making processes, as expressed by accuracy of response, seem to be specifically impaired by LH damage. 
Cisplatin and etoposide as first-line chemotherapy for metastatic breast carcinoma: a prospective randomized trial of the Italian Oncology Group for Clinical Research. In this prospective randomized study, first-line treatment with the combination of cisplatin (P) and etoposide (E) was compared with the standard cyclophosphamide, methotrexate, and fluorouracil (CMF) combination in 140 patients. Complete remissions were obtained in 11% of 65 assessable patients on CMF and in 12% of 65 assessable patients on PE. Complete plus partial remission rates were 48% on CMF and 63% on PE (P = .08). Time to progression (median, 32 v 31 weeks), duration of response (48 v 39 weeks), and survival (75 v 76 weeks) were not different. Hematologic toxicity was significantly higher with PE, and gastrointestinal side effects were frequent with this treatment. This study demonstrated that the PE combination is effective as front-line chemotherapy. As far as response rate is concerned, a trend of superiority over CMF was observed, which was of borderline significance. Due to the lack of survival advantage and to toxicity, this combination is not recommended for routine clinical use. However, its high level of activity should be taken into account for further research. 
Idiopathic colonic perforation in the neonate. We describe a premature infant in whom spontaneous perforation of the colon was initially detected on routine abdominal films. There was no clinical evidence of necrotizing enterocolitis, peritonitis, or bowel obstruction. Surgical and pathologic findings confirmed the diagnosis of idiopathic bowel perforation. Since spontaneous gastrointestinal perforation in the neonate is often difficult to diagnose clinically, radiographic evaluation may allow earlier diagnosis and prompt surgical treatment of this life-threatening condition. 
Prognostic factors and complication rates for cervical cerclage: a review of 482 cases. Charts from 482 singleton pregnancies undergoing cerclage placement in patients over a 6-year period were reviewed. Cervical dilatation at time of surgery, number of previous spontaneous losses, and gestational age at placement were key determinants of outcome. The most frequent complication, premature rupture of the membranes, ultimately occurred in 38% of patients. The 6.6% infection rate was increased in patients undergoing emergent versus elective surgery (12.7% vs 4.7%, p less than 0.005) and in patients at increased dilatation at time of surgery (5.7% for less than or equal to 2 cm vs 41.7% for greater than 2 cm, p less than 0.005). McDonald and Shirodkar procedures had similar obstetric outcomes in patients undergoing their first cerclage. The subgroup of patients with prior cerclage surgery showed improved birth weight when the Shirodkar procedure was performed instead of the McDonald cerclage (mean birth weight 3020 vs 2470 gm, p less than 0.005). An increased rate of primary cesarean section was found in the Shirodkar group (31% vs 17%, p less than 0.005). Complication rates and pregnancy outcome appear to reflect cervical dilatation more than gestational age at time of surgery. 
Extraspinal causes of lumbosacral radiculopathy. Twelve of 12,125 patients who had been referred during a seven-year period to a specialist in spinal disorders were found to have an extraspinal cause of radiculopathy or neuropathy of the lower extremity. The records of these twelve patients were reviewed retrospectively. The average age of the twelve patients was sixty-five years (range, forty-two to seventy-seven years). The cause of the symptoms was an occult malignant tumor in nine patients and a hematoma, an aneurysm of the obturator artery, or a neurilemoma of the sciatic nerve in the others. The average time from the onset of symptoms to the final diagnosis was eight months (range, one month to two years). The most useful test for determination of the correct diagnosis was computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging of the abdomen and pelvis. Computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging of the spine and bone-scanning of the whole body were of little help in localizing the disease. In four of the twelve patients, an operation was performed on the basis of an incorrect diagnosis. In dealing with elderly patients who have radiculopathy, one should be suspicious that the cause is outside the spine. 
Hepatotoxicity of rifampin and isoniazid. Is it all drug-induced hepatitis? Serologic markers for hepatitis viruses were studied in 40 children who developed acute hepatitis during antituberculosis therapy with rifampin and isoniazid, with the aim of assessing the contributory role of these viruses toward producing hepatic injury. Hepatitis A and B were confirmed in 7.5 and 35% patients, respectively, by IgM antibodies. Epidemiologic evidence suggested the possibility of non-A, non-B hepatitis in at least a few of the remaining 23 children. Hepatitis B was seen more often in children with severe tubercular disease (72%) and was largely (92.8%) parenterally transmitted. The study highlights that the endemicity of viral hepatitis in developing countries, among other factors, could also be responsible for the reported higher incidence of hepatotoxicity from developing countries and also for the increased risk of hepatotoxicity seen in severe tubercular disease. 
Hyperemesis gravidarum. A comparison of single and multiple admissions. Recurrent hyperemesis gravidarum is a frustrating and poorly studied complication of early pregnancy. Between 1979 and 1987, 140 women with emesis severe enough to require parenteral fluid and electrolyte replacement were admitted to the Medical University of South Carolina Hospital, Charleston, on 220 occasions. Thirty-nine of the 140 women were admitted on multiple occasions. A comparison of clinical characteristics of women with single and multiple admissions revealed no significant differences except that women admitted repeatedly for hyperemesis gravidarum were more likely to be nulliparous (P less than .05). Ptyalism (59% vs. 9%) and persistent vomiting for greater than 24 hours after admission (69% vs. 23%) were significantly more common among women who were admitted repeatedly (P less than .05). Despite published reports that hyperemesis gravidarum has no impact on ultimate perinatal outcome, this study indicated that women admitted repeatedly have a more severe nutritional disturbance, associated with significantly reduced maternal weight gain and neonatal birth weight. These risks argue for more aggressive antenatal treatment and increased fetal surveillance in pregnancies complicated by recurrent hyperemesis gravidarum. 
Vancomycin added to empirical combination antibiotic therapy for fever in granulocytopenic cancer patients. European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) International Antimicrobial Therapy Cooperative Group and the National Cancer Institute of Canada-Clinical Trials Group [published erratum appears in J Infect Dis 1991 Oct;164(4):832] A total of 747 febrile granulocytopenic patients with cancer were randomized to receive ceftazidime plus amikacin (CA) with or without vancomycin (V) as initial empirical therapy. Single gram-positive bacteremias responded in 29 (43%) of 68 patients treated with CA and in 48 (72%) of 67 treated with CAV (P = .001). For single gram-negative bacteremias and clinically documented and possible infections the response rates of CA and CAV were 80% and 63% (P = .17), 55% and 75% (P = .009), and 74% and 81% (P = .16), respectively. However, for patients with gram-positive bacteremia and for all other patients, there were no differences by treatment regimens in the proportion of febrile patients on each trial day (P = .85, P = .82, respectively) or in the duration of fever (P = .22, P = .93, respectively). Moreover, no patient with gram-positive bacteremia died during the first 3 days of true empirical therapy. Antibiotic-associated nephrotoxicity was more frequent in patients treated with vancomycin (6% vs. 2%, P = .02). These results do not support the empirical addition of vancomycin to initial antibiotic therapy in cancer patients with fever and granulocytopenia. 
The conversion of primaquine into primaquine-aldehyde, primaquine-alcohol, and carboxyprimaquine, a major plasma metabolite. Although efficacy and toxicity of primaquine (PQ) depend on bioconversion, the process is poorly understood, even for carboxyprimaquine (CPQ), the major plasma metabolite. Earlier work to clarify drug metabolism showed that PQ could be converted quantitatively into CPQ, in vitro, with human erythroleukemic K562 cells or nonleukemic bone marrow supplemented with calf serum. We have now found--using systems with serum only, as well as with K562, bone marrow, and adult or embryonic liver cells--that the bioconversion of the side chain of PQ involves a branched pathway with at least three separate enzymes and two derivatives other than CPQ. An oxidase activity in serum converted PQ first into a novel side chain aldehyde (Y). Aldehyde dehydrogenase transformed PQ-aldehyde into CPQ in cell-free systems and in K562, bone marrow, and adult liver cells. Embryonic hepatocytes or bone marrow treated with 1,3-bis(2-chloroethyl)-1-nitrosourea did not produce CPQ; instead, they made a metabolite (Xc) that we could synthetize via PQ-aldehyde and identify as PQ-alcohol. PQ-alcohol replaced CPQ as the final product whenever alcohol-dehydrogenase prevailed over aldehyde dehydrogenase. These enzymes operated in intact cells and controlled the biotransformation of PQ absolutely. Unless both dehydrogenase were absent, inhibited, or deprived of coenzyme, potentially cytotoxic PQ-aldehyde intermediate did not accumulate. Some of the unique tissues schizonticidal and gametocidal effects of PQ may depend on the distribution pattern and relative activities of PQ oxidase, aldehyde dehydrogenase, and alcohol dehydrogenase in human subjects and in parasites. 
Inflammatory pseudotumor of the liver causing biliary obstruction. Treatment by biliary stenting with 5-year follow-up. Inflammatory pseudotumors of the liver are rare lesions that are becoming increasingly recognized, possibly because of frequent use of abdominal computed tomography (CT) and ultrasonography. Most previously reported cases have been treated by hepatic resection. For this reason, we describe a patient with obstructive jaundice secondary to an inflammatory hepatic pseudotumor in the porta hepatis. Bilateral internal biliary stents were inserted, and the patient remains well 5 years later. The clinicopathologic features of inflammatory pseudotumors of the liver are described, as are the implications of accurate diagnosis. There have been no previous reports of biliary stenting in management of inflammatory hepatic pseudotumors. 
Syncope and orthostatic hypotension. PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to determine the postural blood pressure response over time, the prevalence of orthostatic hypotension in patients with syncope, and the relationship of orthostatic hypotension to recurrence of symptoms. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We prospectively evaluated 223 patients with syncope in a standardized manner. Orthostatic responses were measured in a standardized fashion at 0, 1, 2, 3, 5, and 10 minutes or until symptoms occurred. Follow-up was obtained at 3-month intervals. Causes of syncope were assigned by predetermined criteria. RESULTS: Orthostatic hypotension (20 mm Hg or greater systolic blood pressure decline) was found in 69 patients (31%). The median time to reach minimal standing systolic blood pressure was 1 minute for all subjects. In patients with orthostatic hypotension (20 mm Hg or greater), mean time to reach minimum blood pressure was 2.4 minutes. The vast majority of patients with significant orthostatic hypotension had this finding within 2 minutes of standing. Orthostatic hypotension was common in patients for whom other probable causes of syncope were assigned. The recurrence of syncope was not related to the degree of orthostatic hypotension; however, the recurrence of dizziness and syncope as end-points was lower in patients with 20 mm Hg or greater systolic blood pressure reductions as compared with patients with lesser degrees of orthostatic blood pressure declines. CONCLUSION: Orthostatic hypotension is common in patients with syncope and is detected in the vast majority of patients by 2 minutes. Although symptom recurrence on follow-up was lower in patients with more severe orthostatic hypotension, the clinical significance of this finding needs to be further defined by future studies. 
A meta-analysis of prophylactic antibiotics in head and neck surgery. Although it is generally agreed that prophylactic antibiotics are necessary for the prevention of postoperative wound infection, the choice of antibiotic regimen is controversial. In an attempt to determine the most effective antibiotic regimen, a meta-analysis of published clinical trials of prophylactic antibiotics for head and neck surgery was undertaken. The meta-analysis revealed a relative difference in infection rates of 43.7 percent in favor of the use of antibiotics versus placebo, of 8.3 percent in favor of multiple antibiotics versus a single antibiotic, of 13.7 percent in favor of multiple antibiotics versus cefazolin, and of 4.1 percent in favor of multiple-day prophylaxis versus single-day prophylaxis. This meta-analysis suggests that a 1-day course of clindamycin may be the most effective prophylactic antibiotic regimen for head and neck surgery. 
Ossifying fibromyxoid tumor of soft parts. Additional observations of a distinctive soft tissue tumor. The author studied four subcutaneous soft tissue tumors, similar to those recently described by Enzinger and associates (Am J Surg Pathol 1989;13:817) by the name "ossifying fibromyxoid tumor," by immunohistochemistry and electron microscopy to further understand the cellular nature of this lesion. The four tumors were composed of uniform round cells often surrounded by a lacunar space. The tumors often contained a peripheral zone of metaplastic bone. The cellularity was high, but the mitotic rate was low, suggesting a benign or borderline nature of the lesion. Longer follow-up was available for three cases, showing recurrence-free survival times of 11, 8, and 3 years. Immunohistochemistry studies revealed that all tumors were strongly positive for S-100 protein and focally positive for Leu-7, whereas melanoma-specific marker HMB45 was negative. Vimentin was the main type of intermediate filament protein, and one case also contained scattered glial fibrillary acidic protein-positive cells. Epithelial markers (keratins, epithelial membrane antigen), desmin, and muscle actins were negative. Electron microscopic examination showed partial, sometimes reduplicated, basal lamina surrounding many cells. Complex cell processes were also present. No myofilaments were found. The immunohistochemical and electron microscopic results may suggest that this tumor has Schwann's cell differentiation. 
Mucosal vascular stasis precedes loss of viability of endothelial cells in rat acetic acid colitis. The hypothesis that a significant reduction in colonic mucosal perfusion, and hence ischemic injury, precedes the development of mucosal ulceration and inflammation is tested in this report. The microcirculatory changes in the rat colonic mucosa within 1 hr of topical exposure to 10% acetic acid were assessed. Colonic mucosal blood flow signals measured by laser Doppler flowmetry were significantly reduced to 61 +/- 8, 52 +/- 10, and 37 +/- 13% (mean +/- SEM) of baseline values at 1 min, 4 min, and 10 min after the colonic mucosa was exposed to 10% acetic acid, respectively, but not in controls exposed to saline. After the start of application of 10% acetic acid (for 4 min), in vivo microscopy studies demonstrated that colonic mucosal ischemia (stasis of the red blood cells in the mucosal capillaries) occurred at 9 +/- 5 min (mean +/- SEM). Evidence of endothelial cell death (failure to exclude a fluorescent dye, propidium iodide, by endothelial cells) developed at 25 +/- 10 min (mean +/- SEM). These findings indicate that within minutes after contact of the colonic mucosa with 10% acetic acid, colonic mucosal ischemia develops, followed shortly by death of endothelial cells. The data do not establish a cause-and-effect relationship between the reductions in mucosal blood flow and loss of endothelial cell viability in response to acetic acid. Nevertheless, because these events occur at such an early time point, they may play a pathogenetic role in the development of the subsequent inflammatory and ulcerative changes in this animal model of colitis. Further studies to define the potential causal relationships between these parameters are warranted. 
Sufentanil citrate and morphine/bupivacaine as alternative agents in chronic epidural infusions for intractable non-cancer pain. Intraspinal narcotic (usually intrathecal morphine) infusions with implanted pumps are increasingly used in patients with intractable chronic pain not caused by cancer. In some patients, pain control is difficult with infusions of morphine. Seven patients with diagnoses of arachnoiditis, epidural scarring, and/or vertebral body compression fracture were treated with alternative solutions in an epidural route. For maximal flexibility, Medtronic implanted programmable infusion pumps with catheters to T6-T10 were used, and pain was monitored by verbal pain scales. In three patients, epidural infusions of morphine in 0.5% bupivacaine (MS-MARC) resulted in little or no pain relief without significant side effects (e.g., headache, nausea, or vomiting). In these same patients, epidural infusions of sufentanil citrate resulted in pain scale reductions of 92%, 82%, and 40%, respectively, with no side effects. Four other patients found more effective pain relief when switched from initial sufentanil citrate infusions to MS-MARC. Pain scale reductions (with no side effects) were 92%, 76%, 59%, and 47% in these patients. Pain relief and minimal side effects with sufentanil citrate is theorized to result from its higher lipophilicity promoting local transdural diffusion to spinal cord and limiting upward diffusion to the brain stem. Sufentanil citrate is also advantageous for programmable pumps because it is 100 times more potent than morphine and therefore allows longer pump refill times and higher infusion doses. Although this study was done on a limited number of patients, sufentanil citrate and MS-MARC in epidural infusions using programmable infusion pumps for non-cancer patients provide significant alternative drug combinations and routes. 
Processing of the precursor of NF-kappa B by the HIV-1 protease during acute infection. Transcription of the human immunodeficiency virus type-1 (HIV-1) genome is regulated in part by cellular factors and is stimulated by activation of latently infected T cells. T-cell activation also correlates with the induction of the factor NF-kappa B which binds to two adjacent sites in the HIV-1 long terminal repeat. This factor consists of two DNA-binding subunits of relative molecular mass 50,000 (50K) associated with two 65K subunits. It is located in the nucleus in mature B cells, but is present in other cell types as an inactive cytoplasmic complex. External stimuli, including those that activate T cells, result in nuclear translocation of active NF-kappa B. The cloning of the complementary DNA for the 50K subunit helped to identify an exclusively cytoplasmic 105K precursor (p105) (V.B., P.K. and A.I., manuscript submitted). The expression of active NF-kappa B might therefore also be regulated by the extent of processing of p105. Because HIV-1 requires active NF-kappa B for efficient transcription, we tested the effect of HIV-1 infection on the processing of the human 105K precursor. We show here that the HIV-1 protease can process p105 and increases levels of active nuclear NF-kappa B complex. 
Trichinella spiralis infection alters small bowel motor activity in the fed state. The effect of Trichinella spiralis infection on small intestinal transit and motor activity in the fed state during the intestinal phase of infection was studied. Contractions were recorded by strain gauge transducers, and mean transit time was measured by marker dilution technique. The mean amplitude and area of individual phasic contractions decreased, but no change occurred in their mean duration during trichinosis. The total amplitude and area of phasic contractions also decreased; this was caused by a decrease in the frequency of contractions as well as a decrease in the mean parameters. The reduction in the total duration was entirely caused by the decrease in frequency. The reduction in the total parameters of all contractions was the result of a reduction in the same parameters for both propagating and nonpropagating contractions. However, the decrease in the parameters of propagating contractions was much greater. Also, there was a decrease in the distance of propagation of phasic contractions. The transit time as a result of phasic contractions increased during T. spiralis infection. Additionally, T. spiralis infection induced giant migrating contractions in the fed state that were never observed during control. Chyme was propelled very rapidly and effectively by giant migrating contractions. The findings of the present study suggest that during diarrhea induced by T. spiralis infection, the phasic contractions may act to decrease transit and, hence, allow more contact time for absorption of water and nutrients. However, this response may be counter-balanced by giant migrating contractions that rapidly propel chyme into the colon and compound the diarrhea associated with T. spiralis infection. 
Identification of stromal cell precursors in human bone marrow by a novel monoclonal antibody, STRO-1. Murine IgM monoclonal antibody STRO-1 identifies a cell surface antigen expressed by stromal elements in human bone marrow (BM). STRO-1 binds to approximately 10% of BM mononuclear cells, greater than 95% of which are nucleated erythroid precursors, but does not react with committed progenitor cells (colony-forming unit granulocyte-macrophage [CFU-GM], erythroid bursts [BFU-E], and mixed colonies [CFU-Mix]). Fibroblast colony-forming cells (CFU-F) are present exclusively in the STRO-1+ population. Dual-color cell sorting using STRO-1 in combination with antibody to glycophorin A yields a population approximately 100-fold enriched in CFU-F in the STRO-1+/glycophorin A+ population. When plated under long-term BM culture (LTBMC) conditions, STRO-1+ cells generate adherent cell layers containing multiple stromal cell types, including adipocytes, smooth muscle cells, and fibroblastic elements. STRO-1+ cells isolated from LTBMC at later times retain the capacity to generate adherent layers with a cellular composition identical to that of the parent cultures. The STRO-1-selected adherent layers are able to support the generation of clonogenic cells and mature hematopoietic cells from a population of CD34+ cells highly enriched in so-called long-term culture-initiating cells. We conclude that antibody STRO-1 binds to BM stromal elements with the capacity to transfer the hematopoietic microenvironment in vitro. 
Percutaneous posterolateral lumbar discectomy and decompression with a 6.9-millimeter cannula. Analysis of operative failures and complications. The operative failures and complications of percutaneous posterolateral lumbar discectomy were analyzed in 100 patients who had a herniated nucleus pulposus and were prospectively studied and treated with use of a 6.9-millimeter outer-diameter (4.9-millimeter inner-diameter) sheath and manual insertion of the instruments. Twelve operations were considered to have failed, regardless of the length of postoperative follow-up or the incidence of reinjury; eleven patients had a repeat operation at the index level, and one patient was a chronic drug-abuser. In eight of the eleven patients, subsequent laminectomy was successful. Two patients had a psoas hematoma and one had a transitory sensory and distal motor deficit; all of these complications resolved without sequelae. There were no major complications, including superficial or deep infection, and no patient had neurovascular compromise. 
Obesity in minority populations: policy implications of research. Obesity is a major health problem for many Americans, with an overall prevalence for adults of approximately 25% and a range for specific subgroups of 24-75%. This range is striking and reflects many factors shown to influence the development and maintenance of obesity, including physical activity, diet, ethnicity, income, education, and genetic susceptibility. Many minority populations have higher prevalences of obesity and, thus, experience its adverse health consequences disproportionately. Research in diverse populations indicates that the relative importance of risk factors for cardiovascular disease varies in many populations. Data characterizing the profile of risk factors, including obesity and physical activity, for various special populations are limited and some, such as obesity, are based on standards developed in the general population. For public health policy and interventions to succeed, they must address the needs of special populations and of the overall population. This paper discusses some of the relevant broader social and research issues. 
Bioelectrical impedance assay (BIA) of total body composition in alcohol-induced migraine patients. Preliminary report. "Whole body composition" was investigated in 30 people subject to alcohol-induced migraine. The control group was 30 people matched for age, sex, height and weight, who were not subject to migraine and who consumed moderate amounts of alcohol. The following were evaluated: anthropometric data, alcohol intake in grams per day, total body water, fat-free mass, fat mass, and body mass index (kg/m2). Two methods of measurement were used: skin fold thickness evaluation, and bioelectric impedance assay (BIA). BIA is a non-invasive method based on the principle that lean tissues conduct a low frequency alternating current of electricity better than do fatty tissues. Body mass index was increased in the alcohol-induced migraine patients (p less than 0.04), as was fat mass, (p less than 0.03) as evaluated by skin fold measurements. Bioelectric impedance assay demonstrated a slight total body water increase in alcohol-induced migraine patients (p less than 0.07). Possibly, if this total body water increase was reflected at the neuronal level, the bioelectric properties of the migrainous brain may be altered, thus creating a hypothetical link with the phenomenon of spreading depression. 
Detection of alcoholism in hospitalized children and their families The study sought to measure provider recognition of family alcohol-related problems among hospitalized children and to identify characteristics distinguishing "positive" families. The study sample (N = 147) was drawn from admissions to the general pediatric medical service of a metropolitan teaching hospital. Positivity was assessed through parent and patient interviews that included standard alcohol abuse screening instruments. Provider recognition was assessed through record review and physician interview. Of the 22 families screened positive, only one was so identified by the child's attending or resident physician. Positive and "negative" families were similar in most respects, although parents in positive families were more likely to report stress and sleeping problems and adolescents were more likely to report being troubled by a parent's drinking. The similarity of positive and negative families and the low pediatrician recognition rate suggest that alcohol problems are likely to go unnoticed without a conscious screening effort. 
Neonatal detection of generalized resistance to thyroid hormone [published erratum appears in JAMA 1991 Feb 20;265(7):869] Generalized resistance to thyroid hormone (GRTH) is an inherited disease that is usually suspected when elevated serum thyroid hormone levels are associated with nonsuppressed thyrotropin. Often these test results are obtained because of short stature, decreased intelligence, and/or hyperactivity with learning disability noted in childhood and adolescence, or because of goiter in adulthood. We detected GRTH at birth by analysis of blood obtained during routine neonatal screening. The proposita, born to a mother with GRTH, had a thyrotropin level of 26 mU/L and a corresponding thyroxine concentration of 656 nmol/L (normal, 84 to 232 nmol/L). Administration of thyroid hormone in doses eightfold to 10-fold above replacement levels (liothyronine sodium, 21 micrograms/kg per day, and levothyroxine sodium, 44 micrograms/kg per day) were required to reduce serum thyrotropin to normal levels without induction of hypermetabolism. This case, and the retrospective finding of high thyroxine levels in five newborns subsequently diagnosed as having GRTH, suggest that measurement of thyroxine at birth, in conjunction with thyrotropin, could allow the early detection of GRTH. 
Total hip replacement with cemented, uncemented, and hybrid prostheses. A comparison of clinical and radiographic results at two to four years. One hundred and thirty-one patients who had 144 cemented or uncemented hip prostheses were followed prospectively for two to four years. A cemented or a hybrid prosthesis (consisting of a cemented femoral component and an uncemented acetabular component) was used in men older than seventy years, in women older than sixty years, and in younger patients in whom adequate initial fixation could not be obtained without cement. Uncemented, porous-surfaced implants were used in all other patients. The over-all clinical results were similar for the three groups. For the fifty-two hips that had a cemented prosthesis, the mean total Harris hip rating was 91 points and the score for pain, 42 points; for the twenty-seven hips that had a hybrid prosthesis, 90 and 43 points; and for the sixty-five hips that had an implant allowing ingrowth of bone in both the acetabulum and the femur, 95 and 43 points. Two prosthetic stems that were designed to allow ingrowth of bone had aseptic loosening; one was revised. Pain in the thigh, usually slight and not disabling, occurred at one year in 24 per cent of the patients in whom a femoral component allowing ingrowth had been used; the prevalence of pain then declined. The incidences of migration of the components and of radiolucent lines were greater in the acetabula that had a cemented component than in those that had a cup allowing ingrowth of bone. 
The effect of oral nitroglycerin on portal blood velocity as measured by ultrasonic Doppler. A double blind, placebo controlled study. We studied the effect of oral nitroglycerin on portal blood velocity (PBV) in 20 cirrhotic patients by a double blind, placebo controlled method using noninvasive Doppler sonography. After we obtained baseline Doppler in the fasting state, 0.6 mg nitroglycerin or placebo was given orally and the mean of 3 s averaged mean PBVs was repeated at 5 min intervals for 60 min. Ten patients each received nitroglycerin or placebo. Portal vein flows were antegrade in all. Of the 10 patients receiving nitroglycerin, seven (P = 0.002) showed a greater than 10% fall in the mean PBVs for at least 15 min. Of these seven "responders," five patients had a 10% decrease in mean systemic blood pressure for at least 15 min. None of the "nonresponders" had systemic hypotension. Our study suggests that the PBV-reducing effect of nitroglycerin in cirrhotics may be explained in part by systemic hypotension. 
Twin delivery: influence of the presentation and method of delivery on the second twin. To ascertain the perinatal mortality and morbidity in the second twin as related to its presentation and method of delivery, we reviewed the data on 578 sets of twins delivered from 1980 to 1987 and included 397 sets in whom both twins were greater than or equal to 1000 gm, without lethal anomalies, and in whom the first twin presented as a vertex. The perinatal outcome comparing twin A (all vertex) with twin B (vertex or nonvertex) with cesarean section or vaginal delivery was analyzed. No statistically significant difference in perinatal mortality or morbidity was found in comparing the nonvertex second twin delivered vaginally or by cesarean section. The one perinatal death and significant perinatal morbidity occurred in infants weighing less than 1500 gm or at less than 32 weeks' gestational age. It is concluded that vaginal delivery, irrespective of the position of the second twin, is valid in selected cases as long as fetal weight is greater than 1500 gm and the gestational age is greater than or equal to 32 weeks. 
A phase II evaluation of menogaril in cisplatin-refractory advanced ovarian carcinoma. A collaborative trial of the North Central Cancer Treatment Group and the Mayo Clinic. Forty-one women with advanced, recurrent epithelial ovarian carcinoma (in whom prior chemotherapy with a platinum-based regimen failed) were treated with menogaril 200 mg/m2 intravenously every 4 weeks in a Phase II trial. Partial responses were seen in two of 19 (10.5%) measurable disease patients and three of 12 (25%) nonmeasurable but evaluable patients, an overall objective response rate of 16.1% (95% confidence interval, 5% to 34%). Median time to progression for all patients was 2 months and median survival, 5 months. Toxicities were acceptable and consisted primarily of leukopenia and gastrointestinal toxicity. Twenty-nine percent of the patients had venous irritation or painful phlebitis at the intravenous injection site. Menogaril, as administered in this protocol, had modest antineoplastic activity in previously treated ovarian carcinoma patients. The responses were of short duration, and there appeared to be no survival advantage with menogaril treatment. 
The binding and functional properties of voltage dependent calcium channel receptors in pediatric normal and myelodysplastic bladders. The present study was designed to compare the binding and functional properties of calcium channel receptors in normal and myelodysplastic bladders. Normal bladders were obtained from children with vesicoureteral reflux undergoing ureteral reimplantation. Myelodysplastic bladder specimens were obtained from patients undergoing bladder augmentation. The functional studies included agonist (calcium chloride) dose response experiments and the determination of apparent antagonist dissociation constants for various calcium channel antagonists. The receptor binding studies were performed using the ligand (+)-3H-PN200-110 (specific activity 86.6 Ci./mmol.). The mean maximal response of myelodysplastic bladders to calcium ions was 31% less than normal bladders (p greater than 0.05). The mean EC50 for calcium mediated isometric tension and the mean -log antagonist dissociation constant values of nifedipine, diltiazem and verapamil were similar in normal and myelodysplastic bladders. The radioligand receptor binding studies demonstrated that the equilibrium dissociation constant of (+)-3H-PN200-110 in myelodysplastic bladders was 4-fold greater than in normal bladders. The density of dihydropyridine binding sites in myelodysplastic and normal bladders was similar. Our study demonstrated that the pathophysiology of the poorly compliant hyperreflexic bladder is not related to up regulation of dihydropyridine calcium channel receptors or alterations in the response of detrusor muscle to calcium ions. The relative abundance of calcium channel receptors in the normal and myelodysplastic bladders, and the regulation of detrusor contraction by calcium ions suggest that calcium channel receptors have a meaningful role in detrusor function. 
IgA nephropathy in blacks: studies of IgA2 allotypes and clinical course. The prevalence of IgA nephropathy (IgAN) varies among racial groups, being most common among Caucasians and Orientals and rare in Blacks. Other investigators have hypothesized that the risk for IgAN may be influenced by the IgA2 allotype. It has been suggested that the rare Black patients with IgAN may be homozygous for the A2m(1) allele which predominates in Whites, but is less common in Blacks. In a multicenter study, 27 Black IgAN patients were enrolled to investigate this hypothesis and analyze the clinical course of disease in Blacks. The IgA2 allotypes of 18 Black patients and 14 controls were determined using restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis. Three patients were homozygous for the A2m(1) allele, four were homozygous for A2m(2) and 11 were heterozygous. The respective allelic frequencies of A2m(1) and A2m(2) were 0.47 and 0.53 and did not differ significantly from Black controls. Most clinical manifestations of disease did not significantly differ with respect to distribution of the two alleles, although the gender ratio differed between the homozygous A2m(1) and heterozygous patients. The presence of the A2m(1) allele did not increase the risk for IgAN, and the presence of the A2m(2) allele or homozygosity for this allele did not protect Blacks from the development of IgAN. 
Coronary artery vasoregulation and left ventricular function in patients with angina pectoris-like pain and normal coronary angiograms. Twenty patients with angina pectoris-like pain, normal coronary angiography and abnormal exercise 201Tl scans were investigated by means of haemodynamic, coronary sinus blood flow and lactate determinations before and after cold provocation, pacing and dipyridamole infusion. Radionuclide angiography, a new exercise 201Tl scan and noninvasive hyperventilation and ergonovine tests were performed. Intracoronary infusions of acetylcholine were given in increasing doses and a second coronary angiogram in combination with a 201Tl scintigram was performed. Despite a previously pathological 201Tl scintigram, with reversible perfusion defects, only ten of the patients had reversible perfusion defects at the second investigation. Hyperventilation and ergonovine tests did not result in ECG signs indicative of coronary spasm. Intracoronary infusion of acetylcholine resulted in a diffuse coronary constriction in 3 of 14 patients, and in one patient a perfusion defect was observed on thallium scintigram. In conclusion, although most of the common methods for inducing coronary vasospasm were used, no consistent pattern of reaction was found to explain the chest pains experienced in this group of patients. 
Erdheim-Chester disease. Case report with autopsy findings. Erdheim-Chester disease is a rare pathologic entity characterized by symmetrical radiodensities in the metaphyseal and the diaphyseal portions of the long bones. Fibrosis, osteoblastic cortical bone deposition, and fibroxanthomatous granulomas with lipid-laden macrophages and multinucleated giant cells, which have a particular tropism for connective and adipose tissues, are the pathologic hallmarks. To our knowledge, 27 cases have been reported in the literature since the entity was first described in 1930. Protean clinical features range from a focal and asymptomatic process to a multisystemic infiltrative disease. We describe the clinical course of a new case and review the extensive pathologic findings at autopsy, including those demonstrated by light and electron microscopy and cytochemical and immunocytochemical studies. 
Comparison of direct insertion of disposable and standard reusable laparoscopic trocars and previous pneumoperitoneum with Veress needle. A randomized prospective study was conducted to evaluate the ease of use and safety of direct insertion of laparoscopic trocars. Comparison of previous pneumoperitoneum by Veress needle insertion with direct insertion of the reusable conventional laparoscopic trocar and direct insertion of the disposable shielded trocar revealed minor complication rates of 22, 6 and 0%, respectively. No major complications occurred in this series of 200 patients. 
Conservative treatment of patients with acoustic tumors. Seventy of 178 patients with acoustic tumors initially were treated conservatively and have been followed up for an average of 26 +/- 2 months. The tumor size was determined by the mean maximum anteroposterior and mediolateral diameters, using computed tomographic or magnetic resonance imaging scans obtained sequentially throughout the follow-up period. The average tumor growth was 1.6 +/- 0.4 mm the 1st year, and 1.9 +/- 1.0 mm the 2nd year (range, -2 to 17 mm/y): 4 tumors showed apparent regression, 28 (40%) had no detectable growth, and 37 (53%) exhibited growth (average, 3.8 +/- 1.2 mm/y). Within individual patients, the tumor growth rate determined during the 1st year of follow-up was predictive of tumor growth rate determined during the following year. Rapid tumor growth or clinical deterioration in 9 of the 70 patients (13%) who initially were treated conservatively necessitated subsequent surgery an average of 14 +/- 5 months after the patient was initially seen. This group had a larger initial tumor size (27.0 +/- 3.4 mm vs. 21.3 +/- 0.9 mm, P less than 0.05), and a faster 1-year growth rate (7.9 +/- 2.3 mm/y vs. 1.3 +/- 0.3 mm/y, P less than 0.05) than the 61 patients who did not require surgery. Two patients, however, experienced neurological deterioration that required surgery, even though there was no tumor growth. The high incidence of acoustic tumors with no detectable growth or apparent spontaneous regression must be taken into account when evaluating the indications for surgery and the efficacy of radiotherapy. 
Superior vena cava syndrome caused by an intrathoracic plasmacytoma. A case of an extramedullary intrathoracic plasmacytoma causing superior vena cava syndrome is described. Review of the literature on intrathoracic plasmacytomas and superior vena cava syndrome revealed that no similar cases have been described to date. The initial presentation, management, and response to treatment are described. 
Effects of left atrial pressure on the pulmonary vascular response to hypoxic ventilation. We investigated the effects of hypoxic ventilation on the pulmonary arterial pressure- (P) flow (Q) relationship in an intact canine preparation. Mean pulmonary P-Q coordinates were obtained during hypoxic ventilation and during ventilation with 100% O2 at normal and at increased left atrial pressure. Specifically, we tested the hypothesis that, over a wide range, changes in left atrial pressure would alter the effects of hypoxic ventilation on pulmonary P-Q characteristics. Seven dogs were studied. When left atrial pressure was normal (5 mmHg), the mean value of the extrapolated intercept (PI) of the linear P-Q relationship was 10.9 mmHg and the slope (incremental vascular resistance, IR) of the P-Q relationship was 2.2 mmHg.l-1.min. Hypoxic ventilation increased PI to 18 mmHg (P less than 0.01) but did not affect IR. Subsequently, during ventilation with 100% O2, when left atrial pressure was increased to 14 mmHg by inflation of left atrial balloon, PI increased to 18 mmHg. IR was 1.6 mmHg.l-1.min. Again, hypoxic ventilation caused an isolated change in PI. Hypoxia increased PI from 18 to 28 mmHg (P less than 0.01). As in the condition of normal left atrial pressure, hypoxic ventilation did not affect IR. We conclude that, in an anesthetized intact canine preparation, hypoxic ventilation causes an isolated increase in the extrapolated pressure intercept of the pulmonary P-Q relationship. Furthermore the effects of hypoxic ventilation on pulmonary P-Q characteristics are not affected by the resting left atrial pressure. 
Detection of autoantibodies against myeloid lysosomal enzymes: a useful adjunct to classification of patients with biopsy-proven necrotizing arteritis. PURPOSE: Assessment of the value of determination of antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies (ANCA) and its specificities for classification of patients with biopsy-proven necrotizing arteritis. PATIENTS AND METHODS: The serum samples of 28 consecutive patients with biopsy-proven vasculitis involving medium- and/or small-sized arteries were tested for ANCA by an indirect immunofluorescence technique, by neutrophil extract enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), and by catching ELISA. RESULTS: Eight patients had Churg-Strauss syndrome; six had myeloperoxidase (MPO) antibodies, and in the other two patients, ANCA were not detected. Six patients had polyarteritis nodosa (PAN) limited to the skin and the musculoskeletal system; ANCA were not detected in these patients. Two patients had systemic PAN and both had MPO antibodies. The remaining 12 patients had overlapping clinical features of the different forms of vasculitis. Five patients had polyarteritis in combination with chronic nasal inflammation and glomerulonephritis compatible with Wegener's granulomatosis (WG) but without granulomas in the respiratory tract. All five patients had 29-kd serine protease antibodies. Two patients had polyarteritis in combination with nasal polyposis and asthma compatible with Churg-Strauss syndrome, but eosinophilia was not detected. Both patients had MPO antibodies. Three patients with unclassified granulomatous arteritis had either elastase antibodies or ANCA of unknown specificity. One patient with unclassified systemic vasculitis had 29-kd serine protease antibodies, and one patient with necrotizing arteritis of the bowel in combination with Schonlein-Henoch purpura was negative for ANCA. CONCLUSION: Determination of ANCA and its specificities is a useful adjunct to the classification of patients with biopsy-proven necrotizing arteritis. Within the spectrum of idiopathic vasculitides, 29-kd serine protease antibodies are associated with WG, MPO antibodies are associated with Churg-Strauss syndrome and systemic PAN, and PAN limited to the skin and the musculoskeletal system is not associated with ANCA. 
Current status of lung transplantation. Techniques and indications for single and bilateral lung transplantation have evolved significantly in the past several years. Lung transplantation has entered a new era in which transplantation can be achieved with the same degree of success as that achieved with other major organ transplants. Many problems, common to organ transplantation remain to be solved including availability of suitable donor organs, improved immunosuppressive regimens, and the ability to properly diagnose and effectively treat organ rejection. 
Five-year vascular audit from a district hospital. Vascular patients under the care of one surgeon over a 5-year period have been reviewed, from computer-based discharge records, with regard to in-hospital measures of outcome to determine whether or not surgery was being performed to an acceptable standard. Out of 466 procedures, 30 per cent of patients had at least one complication, 14 per cent had further surgery and 9 per cent died. Outcome was examined within the following treatment groups: aorto/iliac aneurysm, aortofemoral bypass, femoroproximal popliteal bypass, femorodistal popliteal bypass, femorocrural bypass, embolectomy and percutaneous transluminal angioplasty. Patients having below-knee bypass surgery were found to have an unacceptably high rate of complications, reoperations and amputations. An overall rate of reoperation for postoperative bleeding of 5 per cent was also considered to be high. With these exceptions, it was concluded that the surgery was being performed to an acceptable standard, but that comparative audit of this type remained difficult while there was a deficiency of national statistics against which the work of individual surgeons could be judged. 
Clinical characteristics of patients in the persistent vegetative state Little is known concerning the specific clinical characteristics of patients in persistent vegetative states (PVS). Fifty-one patients from four nursing homes, approximately 3% of the total patients, were identified as being in a PVS. The mean age of the patients was 64.8 +/- 3.2 years (range, 19 to 96 years) and the mean duration of the PVS was 3.3 +/- 5.0 years (range, 1 to 16.8 years), with 13 patients' PVS being longer than 5 years. Cerebrovascular accidents and dementia were the most common causes of the PVS, accounting for 32 of the cases (63%). In the younger patients cerebral trauma secondary to motor vehicle accidents was the most common cause. All 51 patients were fed via tube feeding and 35 patients had urinary catheters (75%). All patients were receiving daily medications, with greater than 50% taking daily vitamins. Over 30% were taking digitalis and/or diuretics and over 32% were taking H2 blockers. Transfer of patients to an acute care hospital was not uncommon, with 31 patients (61%) requiring 63 acute care hospitalizations during their stay in the nursing home. As expected, infections were the most common reason for acute care hospitalization, although 15 of the patients were hospitalized for surgical procedures. Another common problem encountered by the patients was pressure sores, with 78% of patients requiring specific therapy for at least one pressure sore. Surprisingly, only 27 (53%) of 51 patients had a specific resuscitation status designation in the medical chart, and neither presence of a chart designation nor specific resuscitation order was related to the patient's age or the cause or duration of PVS. From these data it would appear that clinical characteristics of patients in PVS are variable. Some patients are young, others are old. The cause varies from cerebrovascular accidents to cerebral trauma. Survival may be prolonged; complications are not uncommon, with some patients requiring acute care hospitalization. 
Attenuation of circadian variation by combined antianginal therapy with suppression of morning and evening increases in transient myocardial ischemia. The circadian variation of total ischemic activity was examined during 3289 hours of ambulatory ECG monitoring in 101 patients with stable angina pectoris and proved coronary artery disease, who were not receiving any prophylactic antianginal therapy. The 101 patients displayed 411 episodes of ischemia, 312 (76%) of which were silent; a circadian rhythm was noted for the occurrence of total and silent ischemia. Thirty-eight percent of the ischemic episodes occurred between 6 AM and 12 noon, and total and silent ischemia were significantly more frequent during this period compared with the other three 6-hour periods (p less than 0.01); a lesser peak was noted in the evening. The effects of metoprolol and combined therapy with metoprolol and nifedipine on the circadian variation of ischemic activity were studied in two subgroups of patients in a random, double-blind study design (31 patients receiving metoprolol and 42 receiving combined therapy). During therapy with metoprolol the morning increase in ischemic activity was attenuated, and the highest frequency of ischemia was then noted in the evening (6 AM to 12 noon compared with 6 PM to 12 midnight; p less than 0.05). Combined therapy abolished the morning peak as did metoprolol monotherapy, but even the evening increase in ischemic activity was attenuated (p less than 0.05). The diurnal distribution of the mean heart rate at the onset of ischemia, when patients were off therapy, showed a morning increase similar to the increase in ischemic activity but no second peak in the evening. 
Hereditary lymphedema and distichiasis. Two patients with lymphedema-distichiasis syndrome illustrate that both Milroy's disease and late-onset hereditary lymphedema are sometimes associated with distichiasis. It is important for ophthalmologists to be aware of the lymphedema-distichiasis syndrome because of its ophthalmic manifestations and the associated systemic abnormalities that can be potentially life threatening. 
Management of hypertensive emergencies: changing therapeutic options. Rapid lowering of severe hypertension is essential to prevent irreversible damage to vital organs. The patient's clinical status should be evaluated, noting particularly cardiac, neurologic, and renal functions. Choice of treatment should be based on speed and efficacy of action and on hemodynamic, vascular, and renal consequences. It is also important to preserve circulatory homeostasis and vital organ function. Sodium nitroprusside, labetalol, diazoxide, and hydralazine have been used parenterally for rapid control of severe hypertension, but they do not always produce optimal, balanced hemodynamic effects. Calcium antagonists have been advocated because of their beneficial circulatory effects. Nicardipine, a new dihydropyridine calcium antagonist, produces significant antihypertensive effects, and when given intravenously, results in a rapid fall in blood pressure. Studies have confirmed that nicardipine is effective and safe in the management of severe hypertension and hypertensive crises. Because the aim of rapidly controlling severe hypertension is to prevent target organ dysfunction, nicardipine therapy offers a useful additional option in the clinical management of severe hypertension and hypertensive crises. 
Preparing children for venous blood sampling. A convenience sample of 100 children, aged 6-12 years, attending Kuwait government hospital laboratories for venous blood sampling was studied. A picture book was used to prepare half of the children for the procedure. Preparation was carried out just prior to sampling and took less than 5 min. The story provided a simple description of venous blood sampling, and why it is carried out; it stressed that the pain is noticeable but not unbearable, and that children will experience less pain if they relax their arm and cooperate with the technician. Prepared children reported significantly less pain, and radial pulse rates confirmed that they were less distressed by the procedure. Observers' and parents' evaluations also indicated that prepared children coped better. Various explanations for the benefits observed are discussed, together with requirements for managing the pain, fear and stress experienced by children during medical treatment. 
Relationship between outlet obstruction constipation and obstructed urinary flow. Ten women with symptoms and radiological features of outlet obstruction constipation underwent urodynamic bladder studies. The results were compared with ten age- and sex-matched controls. The mean (s.e.m.) peak flow rate for patients was 19.4 (6.4) ml/s compared with 32.1 (7.2) ml/s for controls (P less than 0.05). The mean (s.e.m.) voiding time for patients was 62.9 (23.7) s against a corresponding value of 15.6 (6) for controls (P less than 0.05). The mean (s.e.m.) bladder volume in patients was 482 (80) ml compared with a control value of 254 (112) ml (P less than 0.03). The mean (s.e.m.) detrusor pressure during the voiding phase was 53.3 (12) cmH2O. These results demonstrate that patients with outlet obstruction constipation have a generalized pelvic floor disorder resulting in obstructed urinary flow. 
Cystic mesothelioma of the peritoneum. A report of three cases. Three cases of peritoneal cystic mesothelioma are reported. All patients were women who had undergone previous abdominal surgery for unrelated conditions. Tumors consisted of solitary and multiple cystic masses involving the abdominal and pelvic peritoneum. The cysts focally infiltrated the muscularis externa of the small intestine in case 1, the outer muscular layer of the uterus in case 2, and the omental tissue in case 3. These findings give morphologic support to the borderline clinical behavior of this tumor that often recurs and support the hypothesis that previous surgery may play a role in its pathogenesis. 
Surgery for chronic ear disease in a non-university hospital: open cavity, obliteration and intact canal wall techniques. The long-term results of surgery for chronic suppurative middle ear disease at a non-university ENT-clinic (Vasa Central Hospital, Finland) are reported. The material consisted of 273 ears, 65 of which had been operated on by open cavity techniques, 178 by the original Palva obliteration method, and 30 by the intact canal wall method. Post-operative cholesteatoma occurred equally frequently with the two canal wall down methods (7.7 and 7.3%, respectively) but was more frequent after intact canal wall surgery (23.3%). Hearing was better and the infection rate lower with obliteration than with open cavity techniques. Post-operative infection was the least frequent and the hearing result best in the intact canal wall ears, but compared to the other two groups the extent of disease found at surgery was considerably less in this group. The obliteration operation proved to be a safe method in the hands of a practising otologist outside university clinics. 
Establishment and characterization of a new human prostatic carcinoma cell line (DuPro-1). A new human prostate adenocarcinoma cell line (DuPro-1) has been established from the athymic nude mouse supported xenograft DU5683. This was accomplished by embedding dispersed xenograft cells in 0.1 by 5.0 cm. spaghetti-like strands of Basement Membrane MATRIGEL [BMM (Collaborative Research, Inc.)], a unique technique facilitating the transition to tissue culture. Now passed over 30 times, the cells display anchorage and serum concentration independent growth with a doubling time of 22 to 24 hours. Cells exhibit pronounced morphological differences when grown on BMM coated culture dishes, assuming a pseudoglandular configuration, in contrast to typical homogeneous monolayer growth on plastic culture dishes. Light and electron microscopy show cohesive sheets of anaplastic epithelial cells, consistent with prostate carcinoma. Karyotypic analysis revealed all human chromosomes, near tetraploidy, 10 to 12 markers, and 3 to 4 X chromosomes, without a Y chromosome. Cells injected s.c. or embedded in BMM and implanted in the subrenal capsule space are equally tumorigenic in male and female athymic mice, suggesting that DuPro-1 cells are hormonally insensitive. Embedding cells in BMM may be useful in developing other tissue culture cell lines from neoplasms difficult to initiate in vitro. DuPro-1 should provide a valuable means to study the biology, immunology, and chemosensitivity of human prostate cancer. 
Induced hypertension during restoration of flow after temporary middle cerebral artery occlusion in the rat: effect on neuronal injury and edema. The effect of hypertension instituted during restoration of flow after focal ischemia was studied. After the middle cerebral artery (MCA) of 12 rats was occluded for 2 hours, the ligatures were released and flow was restored for a period of 2 hours. In the control group, mean arterial pressure (MAP) was not manipulated. In the hypertensive group, the MAP was elevated by 25-30 mm Hg immediately after reestablishment of MCA patency. The area of neuronal injury, determined by 2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium staining, was significantly smaller in the hypertensive group. Specific gravity, determined by microgravimetry, did not differ between groups. The data demonstrate that modest hypertension, when induced during reperfusion after 2 hours of MCA occlusion, reduces neuronal injury and does not exacerbate edema formation. 
The early management of flap necrosis in breast reconstruction. Flap necrosis is a potential complication of any type of breast reconstruction. Of 302 breast reconstructions performed by the author at the University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, some degree of flap necrosis occurred in 59 (19.5 percent). Small areas of flap necrosis can be managed with simple observation, but secondary healing may not be complete for months. Early and aggressive excision of the ischemic tissue with immediate primary closure often can achieve rapid primary healing. In addition, early revision and reshaping of the breast may, in selected patients, permit achievement of a significantly better final result. This is true not only for TRAM and latissimus dorsi flaps, but also for the mastectomy flap necrosis sometimes encountered in immediate reconstruction with simple implants or tissue expanders. 
Monthly pulses of vincristine and prednisone prevent bone marrow and testicular relapse in low-risk childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia: a report of the CCG-161 study by the Childrens Cancer Study Group. On study CCG-161 of the Childrens Cancer Study Group (CCSG), 631 children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) at low risk for relapse were randomized to receive monthly pulses of vincristine-prednisone (VCR-PDN ) during maintenance therapy in addition to standard therapy with mercaptopurine (6MP) and methotrexate (MTX), and either cranial irradiation during consolidation or intrathecal (IT) MTX every 3 months during maintenance. All patients received six doses of IT MTX during induction and consolidation. With a minimum follow-up time of 4.25 years, 76.7% receiving VCR-PDN were in continuous complete remission at 5 years, in contrast to 63.9% receiving GMP-MTX alone (P = .002). The difference in relapse-free survival was due primarily to bone marrow relapse (P = .0008), and in boys also to testicular relapse (P = .003). Among the nonirradiated patients, the 5-year disease-free survival (DFS) was 79.4% for patients randomized to the VCR-PDN pulses, in contrast to 61.2% for the patients randomized to receive 6MP-MTX alone (P = .0002). Among the irradiated patients, the DFS was not significantly different. Of the four combinations of maintenance and CNS therapy studied, the highest DFS was achieved with VCR-PDN pulses and maintenance IT MTX. 
Expression of the insulin like growth factor-binding protein 3 (IGFBP-3) gene is increased in human renal carcinomas. After we had established that the IGFBP-3 gene is expressed in normal human kidney we examined renal adenocarcinoma tissue for alterations of the expression of this gene. For this purpose we prepared poly(A)+ RNA from normal kidney tissue and adjacent renal adenocarcinoma of 18 adult patients and compared the levels of IGFBP-3 mRNA by Northern analysis in both samples. The mean content by densitometry was markedly increased in the carcinoma tissues; in 17 of 18 patients the carcinoma contained significantly more IGFBP-3 mRNA than the normal kidney sample. The highest mRNA levels were found in patients with N2 and N3 lymph node extensions. Comparative Southern analysis of paired samples of four of these patients did not reveal amplification of the gene as the cause of these increased mRNA levels. In one patient, however, we identified a restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) present in normal and malignant cellular DNA. This suggests a participation of the IGFBP-3 gene in the development of human renal cell cancer. 
A difference in mortality between two strains of jaundiced rats. Homozygous Gunn rats lack bilirubin glucuronyltransferase, become jaundiced, and often develop kernicterus, thus providing a model for neonatal hyperbilirubinemia. Two new, inbred rat strains that carry the Gunn mutation are described. These were developed by breeding the mutant Gunn gene (j) into the RHA/N and ACI/N strains, producing the new lines, which were designated RHA/N-j and ACI/N-j. Liver assay confirmed the absence of transferase activity in jaundiced rats from both of the new strains, but marked differences in mortality between the strains were observed. The mortality of jaundiced RHA/N-j rats through 8 weeks was the same as that of their nonjaundiced littermates (20%). In contrast, mortality of jaundiced ACI/N-j rats was distinctly greater than that of their nonjaundiced littermates (81% vs 34%, P less than .001). Signs of kernicterus such as ataxia were much more frequent in jaundiced ACI/N-j rats than in jaundiced RHA/N-j rats (73% vs 11%, P less than .001). Both strains had comparable albumin concentrations through 8 weeks of age. Serum bilirubin concentrations were also comparable, except for a small but significant difference at 20 days of age (ACI/N-j = 294 mumols/L, RHA/N-j = 248 mumols/L, P less than .01). Similarly, the bilirubin-to-albumin ratios were comparable except for a significantly higher ratio at 20 days of age in the ACI/N-j rats (ACI/N-j = 0.70, RHA/N-j = 0.51, P less than .01). Thus, the RHA/N-j strain is unusual in that the jaundiced animals remain healthy. Conversely, the ACI/N-j animals demonstrate a high incidence of kernicterus with mortality. 
Asymptomatic bacterascites: is it spontaneous bacterial peritonitis? Asymptomatic bacterascites is defined as the presence of bacteria in ascitic fluid without clinical features of peritonitis or increased ascitic fluid polymorphonuclear cells. Asymptomatic bacterascites is a controversial entity, and little information is available regarding its spontaneous evolution. Clinical features, bacteriological data and outcome in 22 cirrhotic patients with asymptomatic bacterascites are reported and are compared with those of a group of 36 cirrhotic patients with spontaneous bacterial peritonitis. Eleven patients had gram-negative bacteria and 11 had one gram-positive bacteria. Only in three patients (13.6%) did peritonitis develop. Twelve patients received no antibiotic therapy, and in none did peritonitis develop. At 1 month, 27% of patients with asymptomatic bacterascites had died. Patients with asymptomatic bacterascites had less-severe liver disease; they more frequently had gram-positive bacteria in ascitic fluid and had a lower 1-mo mortality rate than did patients with spontaneous bacterial peritonitis. We conclude that asymptomatic bacterascites is usually the transient residence of bacteria in ascitic fluid. Peritonitis rarely develops in patients with asymptomatic bacterascites and, in most of them, antibiotic therapy is not required. 
Fetal hypertension induced by norepinephrine infusion and umbilical artery flow velocity waveforms in fetal sheep. This study was designed to examine the effects of fetal hypertension on the umbilical artery pulsatility index. Fetal arterial blood pressure and umbilical venous pressure were measured in eight sheep, 3 to 5 days after surgery. Umbilical blood flow was measured with an electromagnetic flowmeter around the common umbilical vein. Umbilical artery flow velocity waveforms were obtained either by an indwelling 5 MHz pulsed Doppler device (n = 4) or transcutaneously by a 4 MHz continuous-wave Doppler device (n = 4). Fetal blood pressure was raised by intravenous infusion of norepinephrine 10 micrograms/min during 5 minutes. Norepinephrine infusion resulted in elevated arterial and umbilical venous pressures, accompanied by a bradycardia during the first 3 minutes. Umbilical blood flow, calculated placental vascular resistance, and umbilical artery pulsatility index did not change. After atropine administration, the norepinephrine-induced elevated arterial and umbilical venous pressures were accompanied by tachycardia, increased umbilical blood flow, and no change in placental vascular resistance and umbilical artery pulsatility index. It is concluded that fetal arterial hypertension provoked by norepinephrine infusion has no effect on placental vascular resistance, umbilical blood flow, and umbilical artery pulsatility index. 
Prolactin-producing pituitary carcinoma with pulmonary metastases. Pituitary adenomas rarely are metastatic. Extracranial visceral metastases of prolactinomas were not previously reported. The authors report a case of a 34-year-old man with a prolactin-producing pituitary carcinoma and histologically proven lung metastases. Pathologic examination of the pulmonary spread included electron microscopy and immunohistochemistry; these confirmed prolactin production by the tumor. The patient's presentation at initial diagnosis, disease recurrence, clinical course, management, and response to therapy (with its theoretic basis) are detailed. Despite the use of dopamine analogues (to tolerance and in combination), there was documented intracranial and extracranial disease progression. Possible future therapeutic maneuvers are discussed. 
Renal pelvic explosion during conservative management of upper tract urothelial cancer. Ureteroscopic fulguration of a renal pelvic papillary transitional cell carcinoma is a relatively new and limited procedure. We present a case of intrarenal explosion during ureteroscopic fulguration. 
Cutaneous vasomotor sensitivity to ethanol and acetaldehyde: subtypes of alcohol-flushing response among Chinese. A cutaneous test has been applied in examination of the flushing response to ethanol and acetaldehyde in 402 Chinese of Han ethnicity. Using this noninvasive method, five response subtypes have been observed: (A) fast flushing to both ethanol and acetaldehyde; (B) fast flushing only to ethanol but not to acetaldehyde; (C) slow flushing to ethanol only; (D) no response either to ethanol or to acetaldehyde; (E) vasoconstriction to ethanol, or to both ethanol and acetaldehyde. A total of 94% in subtype (A) are reported to be flushers, while only 25% was reported in subtype (D). Other physiological responses, such as tachycardia, dizziness, headache, drowsiness, and nausea are less frequent after alcohol ingestion. The recent history of consumption of alcohol of the subjects in different subtypes was also obtained. Although alcohol-induced flushing is thought to be a deterrent factor to heavy consumption of alcohol, the frequency of drinking of alcoholic beverages was not found to be different between flushers and nonflushers. 
Parental occupations of children with leukaemia in west Cumbria, north Humberside, and Gateshead OBJECTIVE--To determine whether parental occupations and chemical and other specific exposures are risk factors for childhood leukaemia. DESIGN--Case-control study. Information on parents was obtained by home interview. SETTING--Three areas in north England: Copeland and South Lakeland (west Cumbria); Kingston upon Hull, Beverley, East Yorkshire, and Holderness (north Humberside), and Gateshead. SUBJECTS--109 children aged 0-14 born and diagnosed as having leukaemia or non-Hodgkin's lymphoma in study areas during 1974-88. Two controls matched for sex and date and district of birth were obtained for each child. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES--Occupations of parents and specific exposure of parents before the children's conception, during gestation, and after birth. Other adults living with the children were included in the postnatal analysis. RESULTS--Few risk factors were identified for mothers, although preconceptional association with the food industry was significantly increased in case mothers (odds ratio 2.56; 95% confidence interval 1.32 to 5.00). Significant associations were found between childhood leukaemia and reported preconceptional exposure of fathers to wood dust (2.73, 1.44 to 5.16), radiation (3.23, 1.36 to 7.72), and benzene (5.81, 1.67 to 26.44); ionising radiation alone gave an odds ratio of 2.35 (0.92 to 6.22). Raised odds ratios were found for paternal exposure during gestation, but no independent postnatal effect was evident. CONCLUSION--These results should be interpreted cautiously because of the small numbers, overlap with another study, and multiple exposure of some parents. It is important to distinguish periods of parental exposures; identified risk factors were almost exclusively restricted to the time before the child's birth. 
L-tryptophan-induced eosinophilia-myalgia syndrome. This report describes three Belgian cases of the eosinophilia-myalgia syndrome associated with the use of L-tryptophan-containing products. Three women, aged 51, 53 and 73 years, were taking L-tryptophan for 2 months to 2 years, at 500, 1500, and 2250 mg d-1, respectively. All developed disabling myalgias, fatigue, and a variable skin rash, in association with marked eosinophilia. In one patient, symptoms and eosinophilia reappeared after rechallenge with L-tryptophan. Discontinuation of the drug resulted in gradual disappearance of the symptoms, signs and laboratory abnormalities in two patients. One patient was treated with corticosteroids because of persisting myalgias. Because of the non-specific clinical manifestations, clinicians from all subspecialties of internal medicine might be confronted with such patients and should be aware of this new entity. 
Mitral valve prolapse, panic disorder, and chest pain. Mitral valve prolapse is a common cardiac disorder that can readily be diagnosed by characteristic auscultatory and echocardiographic criteria. Although many diseases have been associated with mitral valve prolapse, most affected individuals have the primary form of the disorder. Mitral valve prolapse is an inherited condition commonly associated with myxomatous degeneration of the mitral valve and its support structures. Complications of mitral valve prolapse, including cardiac arrhythmias, sudden death, infective endocarditis, severe mitral regurgitation (with or without chordae tendineae rupture), and cerebral ischemic events, occur infrequently considering the wide prevalence of the disorder. Panic disorder is a specific type of anxiety disorder characterized by at least three panic attacks within a 3-week period or one panic attack followed by fear of subsequent panic attacks for at least 1 month. It too is a common condition with a prevalence and age and gender distribution similar to that of mitral valve prolapse. Panic disorder and mitral valve prolapse share many nonspecific symptoms, including chest pain or discomfort, palpitations, dyspnea, effort intolerance, and pre-syncope. Chest pain is the symptom in both conditions that most commonly brings the patient to medical attention. The clinical description of chest pain in patients with mitral valve prolapse is highly variable, possibly reflecting multiple etiologies. Chest pain in panic disorder is usually characterized as atypical angina pectoris and as such bears resemblance to the chest pain commonly described by patients with mitral valve prolapse. Multiple investigative attempts to elucidate the mechanism of chest pain in both conditions have failed to identify a unifying cause. Review of the literature leaves little doubt that mitral valve prolapse and panic disorder frequently co-occur. Given the similarities in their symptomatology, a high rate of co-occurrence is, in fact, entirely predictable. There is, however, no convincing evidence of a cause-effect relationship between the two disorders, nor has a single pathophysiologic or biochemical mechanism been identified that unites these two common conditions. Until specific biologic markers for these disorders are identified, it may be impossible to do so. The lack of a proven cause-and-effect relationship between mitral valve prolapse and panic disorder and the absence of a unifying mechanism do not diminish the clinical significance of the high rate of co-occurrence between the two conditions. Primary care physicians and cardiologists frequently encounter patients with mitral valve prolapse and nonspecific symptoms with no discernible objective cause who fail to respond to beta-blockade. Panic disorder should be considered as a possible explanation for symptoms in such patients.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS). 
Induction of the protooncogene c-fos and recovery of cytosolic adenosine triphosphate in reperfused liver after transient warm ischemia: effect of nitrone free-radical spin-trap agents. Ischemia and reperfusion stimulate several adenosine triphosphate (ATP)-dependent processes involving release of substances including free radicals. This cellular response is mediated through receptors responsive to transcriptional products of gene expression; c-fos acts as a transcriptional factor involved in the regulation of genes associated with cellular proliferation and differentiation. We hypothesized that nitrone free-radical spin traps promote restoration of cytosolic ATP during reperfusion and prevent c-fos induction. Four control rats had no ischemia. Global hepatic ischemia was induced in 19 rats in four groups: saline solution, phenyl-N-tert-butyl nitrone (PBN), alpha 1-pyridyl-N-oxide N-tert-butyl nitrone (POBN), and 5,5-dimethyl-1-pyrroline-N-oxide (DMPO). ATP and intracellular pH were measured at intervals before, during, and after ischemia. At 90 minutes of reperfusion, liver c-fos mRNA was measured. A fourfold elevation of c-fos occurred in the saline-treated group (p less than 0.001). PBN and POBN groups did not differ from the saline group. DMPO resulted in significantly less induction of c-fos than did NS. ATP depletion and recovery in all treatment groups was similar to that of the saline group. We conclude that (1) nitrone spin traps do not prevent c-fos induction or alter the pattern of ATP recovery after hepatic ischemia and reperfusion and (2) c-fos induction is not necessary for restoration of ATP, but the rate of ATP restoration is inversely related to c-fos induction. 
Localization of the translocation breakpoint in a female with Menkes syndrome to Xq13.2-q13.3 proximal to PGK-1. Menkes syndrome is a rare X-linked recessive disorder characterized by an inability to metabolize copper. A female patient with both this disease and an X; autosome translocation with karyotype 46,X,t(X;2)(q13;q32.2) has previously been described. The translocation breakpoint in Xq13 coincides with a previous assignment of the Menkes gene at Xq13 by linkage data in humans and by analogy to the mottled mutations which are models for Menkes disease in the mouse. Therefore, this translocation probably interrupts the gene for Menkes syndrome in band Xq13. We describe here experiments to precisely map the translocation breakpoint within this chromosomal band. We have established a lymphoblastoid cell line from this patient and have used it to isolate the der(2) translocation chromosome (2pter----2q32::Xq13----Xqter) in human/hamster somatic cell hybrids. Southern blot analyses using a number of probes specific for chromosomes X and 2 have been studied to define precisely the location of the translocation breakpoint. Our results show that the breakpoint in this patient--and, therefore, likely the Menkes gene--maps to a small subregion of band Xq13.2-q13.3 proximal to the PGK1 locus and distal to all other Xq13 loci tested. 
Solitary extradural cavernous hemangiomas in the spinal canal. Report of five cases. Five cases of solitary extrathecal cavernous hemangioma in the spinal canal are reported. In one case, two coexistent massive cerebral venous medullary malformations were found. The symptomatology and prognosis of extrathecal spinal cavernous hemangiomas are discussed, as is the significance of various diagnostic measures. The patient material further permitted a rough calculation of the incidence of symptomatic extrathecal cavernous hemangiomas in the spinal canal. 
Transesophageal echocardiography: a simple method for monitoring the patency of ventriculoatrial shunts. Technical note. A new method for evaluating the patency of a ventriculoatrial shunt is described, and early experience with it is reported. Transesophageal echocardiography can demonstrate a cerebrospinal fluid leak in the right atrium through the atrial tip of a shunting device. This capability was an incidental discovery, and since then the accuracy of the technique in evaluating the patency of a ventriculoatrial shunt has been prospectively studied in 20 observations of 16 patients. The method proved to be accurate in 90% to 100% of cases. It is concluded that transesophageal echocardiography offers a rapid and accurate assessment of ventriculoatrial shunt function, is well tolerated, and is easy to perform. 
Heterotopic ossification and peripheral nerve entrapment: early diagnosis and excision. Heterotopic ossification can occur in neurologic disorders, burns, musculoskeletal trauma, and metabolic disorders. In addition to producing the complications of contracture, skin breakdown, and pain, it can cause peripheral nerve entrapment. Nerve entrapment due to heterotopic ossification may be misdiagnosed, and it is difficult to evaluate and treat without recurrence. Computed tomography is especially useful in localization before surgical release of the entrapped nerve. Resection of heterotopic ossification can be successful using disodium etidronate to decrease the risk of recurrence, and resection can improve range of motion and nerve function. Two case studies of nerve entrapment due to heterotopic ossification are presented with the results of computed tomography localization, successful resection, and long-term follow-up. Clinicians should be aware of this complication and the potential for rapid nerve injury. If heterotopic ossification is causing clinically significant peripheral nerve entrapment, early surgical treatment may be indicated, and may be successful. 
The effect of chronic orthopedic infection on quality of life. The patient with chronic orthopedic infection presents a unique challenge to the orthopedic surgeon. The orthopedic surgeon must not only possess an expertise in constantly evolving diagnostic and treatment techniques but also be able to identify numerous related problems and direct the patient in receiving the most appropriate treatment. This demands a commitment of time by the treating surgeon to the individual patient to properly assess the need for support, the extent of psychologic distress, the intensity of pain, and the requirement for medication management. The effective utilization of a multidisciplinary team of health care providers (e.g., specialists in infectious disease, physical medicine and rehabilitation, psychiatry, nursing, pharmacology) can provide an optimal treatment program for this multifaceted problem and maximize the potential for a favorable outcome. 
Cellular energy metabolism during hypoxia. Tissue hypoxia is frequently seen in critically ill patients and it perhaps predisposes these patients to development of multiple system organ failure. In cellular terms, hypoxia is characterized by decreases in the intracellular concentration of oxygen, leading to a decline in aerobically produced adenosine triphosphate (ATP). The deficit arising from unequal levels of cellular ATP requirements and aerobic ATP production is partially satisfied by anaerobic sources of ATP, including glycolysis, the creatine kinase reaction, and the adenylate kinase reaction. These reactions can set in motion cellular mechanisms that ultimately may lead to cellular dysfunction and death. A clear understanding of the relative importance of these reactions is impossible to acquire from global measures of oxygen delivery and oxygen consumption; therefore, the clinical monitoring of tissue oxygenation also should include the measurement of metabolically relevant, organ-specific variables. 
Acoustic neuroma (schwannoma) surgery 1978-1990. A series of 151 patients with 154 acoustic schwannomas have been operated upon in Manchester Royal Infirmary by a joint Otological and Neurosurgical team, employing either the translabyrinthine or the suboccipital approach. The perioperative mortality rate was 3 per cent. Anatomical preservation of the facial nerve was achieved in 89 per cent of tumour removals and a good to normal functional result in 79 per cent of cases. Attempts at hearing preservation have been unsuccessful, largely because of the small number of patients in the series in whom useful hearing was present preoperatively. Complications included major brain stem ischaemia (1.2 per cent), CSF fistula (5 per cent) and facial dysaesthesia (7 per cent). The incidence of mortality and morbidity is directly related to tumour size and to the experience of the surgeons. A number of patients experienced an unusual type of post-operative dreamlike state which appeared to be a form of hypnagogic hallucination, and the possible neurophysiological mechanism responsible for this phenomenon is discussed. The continuing failure to attain the ideal of early diagnosis is lamented, and the importance of a flexible bidisciplinary surgical approach emphasized. 
Mitochondrial encephalomyopathies in childhood. II. Clinical manifestations and syndromes. During a 4-year period 1984 to 1988, 20 children referred with manifestations of central nervous system or neuromuscular disease combined with hyperlactatemia were found to have a mitochondrial disease. Each diagnosis was based on the results of thorough biochemical and morphologic investigations. The patients were separated into one series with mainly encephalopathy (n = 14) and another with mainly myopathy (n = 6). The patients with encephalopathy had the following syndromes: Kearns-Sayre (n = 2), MERRF (myoclonus epilepsy and ragged red fibers; n = 2), MELAS (mitochondrial myopathy, encephalopathy, lactic acidosis, and strokelike episodes; n = 3), Alpers (n = 3), Leigh (n = 1), and other variants (n = 3). In patients with myopathy, three had hypertrophic nonobstructive cardiomyopathy. Ultrastructural abnormalities of mitochondria were the most common morphologic changes in the muscle biopsies. Complex I deficiency was most common in the patients with encephalopathy. All of the patients with myopathy had complex IV deficiency. Mutations of mitochondrial DNA were found in six patients with encephalopathy. We conclude that identification of defects at the DNA level and determination of the phenotypic expression with clinical, morphologic, and biochemical methods are fundamental for future rational classification of mitochondrial disorders. 
Cervicomedullary junction decompression in a case of Marshall-Smith syndrome. Case report. The case is reported of a 2-year-old boy born with Marshall-Smith syndrome who had difficulty in swallowing and who exhibited spasticity and quadriparesis due to compression of the medulla and cervical spine. This is the first child with this rare condition reported to have brain-stem compression from bone abnormalities at the craniovertebral junction and who has required surgery. 
Histological and morphometrical indicators for a biopsy diagnosis of well-differentiated hepatocellular carcinoma. Among 597 patients with nodular hepatic lesions who underwent ultrasonically guided needle biopsy, 305 were histologically confirmed as having hepatocellular carcinoma, and 37 patients had borderline lesions. Histological reexamination was correlated with morphometrical analysis on selected cases of well-differentiated, microtrabecular hepatocellular carcinomas (n = 29), borderline lesion (n = 10), typical (mid-sized and macrotrabecular) hepatocellular carcinomas (n = 15) and cirrhotic liver tissue obtained from extranodular hepatic parenchyma of hepatocellular carcinoma patients (n = 47). Morphometrical analyses revealed that the mean cell size and nucleocytoplasmic ratio were most useful for distinguishing well-differentiated, microtrabecular hepatocellular carcinoma from cirrhosis. These two parameters were well correlated with nuclear density. The grade of nuclear density, therefore, seemed to be a convenient semiquantitative indicator for diagnosing well-differentiated hepatocellular carcinoma. A comparison between intranodular and extranodular hepatic tissues was particularly important for its assessment. It is concluded from the results that hepatic nodules presenting a nuclear density larger than two times that of controls could be classified into the overt hepatocellular carcinoma group. From the statistical aspect, the possibility of microtrabecular hepatocellular carcinoma should be considered when a nodule has a nuclear density exceeding 1.3 times that of the extranodular tissue. 
Pure akinesia: an atypical manifestation of progressive supranuclear palsy. Two patients with "pure akinesia" who showed the characteristic changes of progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP) at necropsy are described. They had akinesia but no rigidity or tremor, and ophthalmoplegia was not observed during the course of illness. The symptoms of "pure akinesia" was not improved by levodopa therapy but was considerably improved by L-threo-3,4-dihydroxy-phenylserine. At necropsy, pathological findings were not different from those reported for PSP. It is suggested that "pure akinesia" is an atypical manifestation of PSP, and that norepinephrinergic neurons may be involved in some types of PSP. 
Catalase-negative listeria monocytogenes causing meningitis in an adult. Clinical and laboratory features. A 63-year-old previously healthy woman presented with acute meningitis. Cultures of the cerebrospinal fluid yielded a serotype 1/2a isolate of Listeria monocytogenes that was biochemically typical in all respects, other than the reproducible lack of catalase production. During therapy, the patient developed oculomotor dysfunction that was attributed to an abscess in the internal capsule. This case report documents the existence of catalase-negative L. monocytogenes indicating that catalase production should not be a strict criterion for identification of Listeria. Furthermore, this clinical experience extends in vitro and experimental animal studies indicating that catalase production is not a necessary virulence factor for invasion by Listeria. 
Intra-arterial thrombolytic therapy in the management of acute and chronic limb ischaemia. A group of 54 patients with acute or chronic limb ischaemia were initially treated with low dose intra-arterial thrombolytic therapy using streptokinase (10,000 units h-1) or plasminogen activator (0.5 mg h-1). Complete thrombolysis was obtained in 90 per cent of patients with symptoms of less than 1 week duration, and in 50 per cent with symptoms of greater than 1 week (P less than 0.05). Successful lysis in 36 patients was followed by successful bypass surgery in seven, percutaneous angioplasty in 13, no further treatment in 13, repeat thrombolysis in two and amputation in one. Failed therapy was associated with major amputation in 40 per cent. One patient died of haemorrhage and another of stroke as a direct result of thrombolytic treatment. The most common complication was haematoma at the site of cannulation of the vessel. Intra-arterial thrombolytic therapy can be very useful for the management of acute and chronic limb ischaemia, but complications do occur and patients should be carefully selected. 
Limited hepatic resection for selected cirrhotic patients with hepatocellular or cholangiocellular carcinoma: a prospective study. From 1 January 1983 to 1 January 1989 123 cirrhotic patients with hepatocellular cancer (n = 122) or cholangiocarcinoma (n = 1) were screened using liver function tests, alpha-fetoprotein determination, ultrasonography with biopsy (and in selected cases computed tomography or nuclear magnetic resonance), laparoscopy and angiography, Child-Pugh classification and urea-nitrogen synthesis rate. Twenty-three patients were selected for surgical resection because the tumour was smaller than 5 cm, not centrally located and at least 1 cm away from main structures; there was no evidence of multicentricity or metastatic disease; and the Child-Pugh classification was A or B and the urea-nitrogen synthesis rate at least 6 g/day. Upper gastrointestinal endoscopy was used routinely to identify oesophageal varices which were present in 17 cases; ten patients with a history of variceal haemorrhage (43 per cent) had preoperative endoscopic sclerotherapy. In cases with recurrent haemorrhage, surgery was used to prevent intraoperative and postoperative bleeding. Tumour resection was carried out using controlled hypotension and hepatoduodenal ligament clamping. Twelve bisegmentectomies, ten segmentectomies and one atypical resection were performed. The operative mortality rate was 13 per cent with liver failure and sepsis as the causes of death. The 'recurrence rate' was 26 per cent and the late mortality rate for the whole group up to 1 January 1990 was 30 per cent; 13 patients were still alive. The 12-month survival rate was 77 per cent and after 5 years it was 49 per cent. Thus, surgical resection of small liver tumours is the treatment of choice in this selected group of patients. 
Clinical and biologic features of childhood T-cell leukemia with the t(11;14). Cytogenetic analysis of cells from 622 consecutive patients with newly diagnosed acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) and successful G-banding chromosome studies disclosed seven cases with the t(11;14)(p13;q11) and one with the t(11;14)(p15;q11). Leukemia cells in all eight cases had a T-cell immunophenotype. The t(11;14)(p13;q11) occurred in 6.8% and the t(11;14)(p15;q11) in 1% of T-cell ALL cases (n = 103). The t(11;14) was associated with presenting clinical features typical of T-cell ALL: male predominance (n = 6), age greater than 10 years (n = 3), hyperleukocytosis (white blood cells greater than 100 x 10(9)/L, n = 5), relatively high hemoglobin level (median, 10.8 g/dL), high serum lactic dehydrogenase level (median, 3248 U/L), presence of mediastinal mass (n = 6), and central nervous system leukemia (n = 2). While there were no significant differences in presenting features between T-cell ALL cases with or without the t(11;14), leukemic cells from patients with the translocations were more likely to coexpress CD4 and CD8 antigens (6 of 6 v 35 of 86 cases tested, P less than .05). Adverse events have occurred in six patients: three central nervous system relapses [including the one with t(11;14)(p15;q11)], two secondary acute myeloid leukemia, and one hematologic relapse. Our results indicate that the t(11;14)(p13;q11) occurs exclusively in T-cell malignancies of intermediate- or late-stage thymocyte differentiation. Additional studies are needed to determine the prognostic implications of these translocations. 
Spinal leptomeningeal metastasis from cerebral glioblastoma. Appearance on magnetic resonance imaging. A case of circumferential leptomeningeal metastasis to the spinal cord from an intracranial glioblastoma multiforme (spinal meningeal gliomatosis) is presented. The clinical, radiographic, and pathological features are described. Spinal magnetic resonance imaging with gadolinium-diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid accurately demonstrated the spread of disease when compared with autopsy findings. The value of spinal magnetic resonance imaging in patients with symptoms attributable to cerebrospinal fluid metastases is discussed. 
Supravalvar aortic stenosis: a 29-year review of surgical experience Between February 1960 and August 1989, 73 consecutive patients underwent surgical correction for supravalvar aortic stenosis (SVAS) at the Texas Heart Institute. There were 43 male (59%) and 30 female patients (41%) ranging in age from 5 days to 27 years (mean age, 12 years). Preoperatively, 8 patients were in New York Heart Association functional class I, 43 in class II, 18 in class III, and 4 in class IV. Of the 73 patients, 62 had localized SVAS and 11 (15%), diffuse SVAS. For all procedures, patients were placed on cardiopulmonary bypass. Those with localized SVAS were successfully treated with patch aortoplasty, whereas those with diffuse SVAS required either an apicoaortic conduit or extensive end-arterectomy with extended patch aortoplasty. There were eight early deaths (less than or equal to 30 days postoperatively) (11%) and four late deaths (greater than 30 days postoperatively) (6%) in a follow-up period ranging from 2 months to 28 years. Sixteen patients (25%) underwent one or more additional operations in the follow-up period. Postoperatively, there were 44 patients in New York Heart Association functional class I and 17 in class II. Preoperative functional class III and class IV (p less than 0.0005), diffuse SVAS (p = 0.05), and the presence of associated congenital defects (p less than 0.01) were important determinants of death. 
Visual evoked potentials and visual acuity after transurethral resection of the prostate. Changes in visual evoked potentials, visual acuity, blood ammonia levels and serum electrolytes (Na+ and K+) after transurethral resection of the prostate using glycine as an irrigating fluid performed under subarachnoid block were studied in 12 patients, in the pre-operative and immediate postoperative periods. Visual evoked potentials (p100 latency), recorded by shift of a checkerboard pattern, increased significantly from a pre-operative value of mean (SEM) 101.18 (1.63) msec in the right eye, and 102.5 (1.47) msec in the left eye to 108.91 (1.8) msec (p less than 0.01) and 108.08 (2.53) msec (p less than 0.01) respectively in the postoperative phase. There were no changes in visual acuity as assessed by a Snellen's chart, blood ammonia levels and serum electrolyte concentrations. The amount of glycine used intra-operatively for irrigation ranged from 3 to 31 litres. 
Alzheimer's disease with delusions and hallucinations: neuropsychological and electroencephalographic correlates. We longitudinally evaluated the neuropsychological functions, rate of progression, and waking EEG findings in 17 patients with probable Alzheimer's disease (AD) with delusions and hallucinations, and compared them with those of matched AD patients without delusions and hallucinations. AD patients with delusions and hallucinations had a more rapid rate of decline, as measured by the Mini-Mental State Examination, a specific defect in receptive language, and a greater frequency of aggression and hostility. Visual EEG analysis showed that these patients had a significantly greater proportion of moderately abnormal EEGs, and spectral analysis confirmed the increased amount of delta and theta activity. These data demonstrate that AD patients with delusions and hallucinations have a greater degree of cerebral dysfunction and a relatively focal neuropsychological defect, which may indicate a localized pathologic abnormality. 
Williams syndrome: masseter spasm during anaesthesia. A 4-year-old boy with Williams syndrome developed masseter spasm after halothane and suxamethonium. He did not develop malignant hyperthermia; the surgery was accomplished with a nontriggering anaesthetic and no further problems. 
Inappropriate use of transillumination for breast cancer screening--Wisconsin, 1990. The overall effectiveness of early breast cancer detection efforts requires the appropriate use and maintenance of dedicated radiographic mammography systems. However, the effectiveness of early detection efforts can be compromised if proven technology is improperly used and/or maintained or if ineffective technology is successfully marketed as an equivalent or superior alternative to mammography. This report summarizes state and federal responses to the inappropriate use of a nonradiographic imaging technique in a breast cancer screening service advertised and used in Wisconsin in 1990. 
Thallium stress testing does not predict cardiovascular risk in diabetic patients with end-stage renal disease undergoing cadaveric renal transplantation. PURPOSE: This study assessed the usefulness of thallium stress testing as a predictor of perioperative cardiovascular risk in diabetic patients with end-stage renal disease undergoing cadaveric renal transplantation. Demographic factors influencing the exercise performance in these patients were also examined. PATIENTS AND METHODS: The medical records of 189 consecutive patients with diabetic nephropathy who were evaluated for cadaveric renal transplantation were reviewed. Thallium stress testing was the initial examination of cardiovascular status in 141 patients. An adequate examination was one in which at least 70% of maximum heart rate was achieved. A thallium stress test was normal if there were no ST segment depressions on the electrocardiogram and no perfusion abnormalities on the thallium scan. Forty-four patients underwent cardiac catheterization as the initial evaluation (Group C) and four patients underwent transplantation without a formal cardiovascular evaluation (Group D). RESULTS: Sixty-four of the 141 patients undergoing thallium stress testing had an adequate and normal examination (Group A). The incidence of perioperative cardiac events in this group was 2%. Seventy-seven patients (Group B) had an abnormal (n = 41) or an inadequate (n = 36) thallium stress test and most (n = 61) then underwent coronary angiography. The use of beta-blockers was the only predictor of an abnormal or inadequate thallium stress test (10 of 64 versus 27 of 77, chi 2 = 6.66, p less than or equal to 0.025). Forty-three percent (26 of 61 in Group B) of patients with inadequate or abnormal thallium stress tests had significant coronary artery disease on cardiac catheterization. The perioperative risk of cardiac events was not different in Group A versus Groups B, C, and D combined. Survival of Group A and B patients was not different but was significantly longer than that of Group C patients (p less than 0.001). Thallium stress testing was less expensive than cardiac catheterization ($1,000 versus $4,000 to $5,000). CONCLUSIONS: Thallium stress testing allowed 45% of patients to avoid cardiac catheterization before renal transplantation. Discontinuing beta-blockers before thallium stress tests may improve exercise performance. The risk of perioperative cardiac events after transplantation was low and not different among patient groups. The relatively low predictive value of thallium stress testing for significant coronary artery disease and perioperative cardiac events in diabetic patients with end-stage renal disease suggests the need for the development of a more cost-effective, noninvasive screening test for this patient population. 
Diagnosis of portal vein thrombosis: value of color Doppler imaging. This study was undertaken to determine the accuracy of color Doppler imaging in the diagnosis of portal vein thrombosis. Two hundred fifteen patients were studied with color Doppler imaging to determine patency of the main portal vein. Sonographic findings were confirmed in 75 patients, aged 19 to 66 years. Correlation with angiography was obtained in 13 patients, and surgical correlation was obtained in the remaining 62. Nine patients had portal vein thrombosis on the basis of these gold standards. Sonograms were classified as showing either patency or thrombosis, depending on the ability to show color flow within the main portal vein. Agreement between sonography and angiography or surgery was found in 69 patients (61 patent, eight thrombosed). One patient with a patent portal vein at sonography was found to have a thrombosed vessel at surgery, whereas five patients without portal venous flow at sonography had patent vessels at angiography (one patient) or surgery (four patients). Overall sensitivity and specificity for detection of portal vein thrombosis were 89% and 92%, with an accuracy of 92%, a false-negative rate of 0.11, a negative predictive value of 0.98, and a positive predictive value of 0.62. We postulate that the majority of errors in our study occurred in vessels that, although patent, had only sluggish flow, which could not be resolved because of technical limitations. We conclude that color Doppler imaging is a valuable screening procedure for the assessment of portal vein patency. If the sonogram shows a patent portal vein, no further studies are required. However, a lack of demonstrable flow does not always indicate thrombosis, and other imaging studies should be performed for confirmation. 
Local control and survival from the Cooperative Osteosarcoma Study Group studies of the German Society of Pediatric Oncology and the Vienna Bone Tumor Registry. The use of aggressive chemotherapy undoubtedly has brought about a dramatic increase in the cure rate of osteosarcoma. The authors' investigations have increased the authors' knowledge of chemotherapy for osteosarcoma, the differential efficacy of currently used agents, and the pronounced schedule dependency and relative route independency of their efficiency. The authors were able to confirm the prognostic significance of tumor response after preoperative chemotherapy. Preoperative chemotherapy in itself has facilitated and promoted limb-salvage surgery. Also, more patients can be cured today by use of aggressive thoracic surgery in case of primary or secondary pulmonary metastases. The authors' efforts to steadily increase metastasis-free survival rates by intensifying chemotherapy in this series of studies, however, have been only moderately successful. Still, chemotherapy-related acute toxicity is considerable and increases with aggressiveness of treatment, and the manifestations of late toxicity may continue to increase with follow-up time. Future trials should be targeted toward exploration of the minimum indispensable amount of toxic treatment yielding comparable or even better results than those currently attainable. 
Rupture of the posterior wall of the left ventricle after mitral valve replacement. During a 20 year period from 1970 to 1989, 1100 patients underwent mitral valve replacement. Rupture of the posterior wall of the left ventricle occurred in seven patients (0.6%); four in the operating room and three in the postoperative room. It was possible to institute CP bypass in six patients and in all of them bleeding was controlled successfully, with repair by an external approach. Only one patient survived. We believe that institution of CP bypass and reinfusion of cardioplegic solution is a major determinant of the outcome. 
Heterogeneity of immunotypes of heat-labile enterotoxins of enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli of human origin. A new technique, checkerboard immunoblotting (CBIB), has been applied to detect and to differentiate heat-labile enterotoxins, (LTs), from enterotoxigenic strains of Escherichia coli of human origin using polyclonal and monoclonal antibodies. Optimal conditions of production and release of LTs were defined using CBIB. LT release was enhanced when E. coli cells were treated with 8 M urea. LT production was highest when E. coli strains were incubated with shaking (200 rpm) at 37 degrees C for 12 h in CAYE-2 medium. Two hundred and five strains of E. coli, isolated from patients with diarrhea in Japan, Thailand, the United States, Mexico, and Brazil, were examined for LT. Of 133 LT-positive strains, 4 (3%) produced an LT that reacted like H-LT-1 (originally isolated from E. coli strain H-74-114) while 126 strains (94.7%) produced LT that reacted like H-LT-2 (originally isolated from strain H-10407) or H-LT-3 (from strain H-240-3). Three strains of human origin (2.3%) produced an LT that reacted like P-LT (produced by E. coli strains of porcine origin). This study shows that CBIB, a simple, efficient, and practical assay, might be useful for epidemiologic surveys and for evaluation of serologic responses to LTs and antitoxic vaccines. 
Role of von Willebrand factor in arterial thrombosis. Studies in normal and von Willebrand disease pigs. With normal and von Willebrand disease (vWD) pigs, we studied the role of von Willebrand factor (vWF) in platelet-vessel wall interactions and occlusive arterial thrombosis. Two methods of arterial injury have been used to determine the thrombotic response of flowing blood in vivo. The first involves balloon catheter injury. After superficial denudation of endothelium from coronary intima, platelets adhere to the subendothelium in a monolayer. Similar numbers of adherent platelets are found in both phenotypes, but platelets in vWD pigs have impaired pseudopod formation and are less well spread morphological indexes of limited platelet activation. Deeper injury, which involves the media, produces nonocclusive platelet-fibrin microthrombi. The second injury method involves pinching the artery at a site of superimposed stenosis, a procedure that almost always exposes media. This procedure induces platelet-fibrin microthrombi in normal and vWD pigs, but only normal pigs develop occlusive thrombosis. Both methods of arterial injury have also been performed in normal and vWD pigs with diet-induced hypercholesterolemia and atherosclerosis. Atherosclerosis promotes platelet spread in vWD pigs but does not abolish the protection from stenosis and injury-induced occlusive thrombosis. In addition, neutralization of vWF activity in normal pigs by a monoclonal antibody prevents the induction of occlusive thrombosis by the stenosis and pinch-injury procedure. This monoclonal antibody also causes performed platelet aggregates to break up. These experimental models of inducing arterial thrombosis have been used in normal and vWD pigs to demonstrate interactions between normal and atherosclerotic vessel wall constituents, circulating platelets and vWF that are fundamental in the process of arterial thrombosis. 
Serum zinc, copper, and selenium levels in inflammatory bowel disease: effect of total enteral nutrition on trace element status. Serum levels of zinc, copper, and selenium, and alkaline phosphatase activity were prospectively studied in 29 patients with inflammatory bowel disease. Fifteen patients had extensive active colitis (active colitis group). Seven patients had active, and seven cases inactive small bowel or ileocecal Crohn's disease (small bowel disease group). Ninety-three healthy subjects acted as controls. Serum trace element levels were considered in relation to vitamin A and E levels, nutritional parameters, the activity of the disease, and the recent intake of steroids. The effect of total enteral nutrition on serum trace elements was studied in seven cases. Serum zinc levels were lower and serum copper levels higher in the active colitis group than in controls (p = 0.0007, and p = 0.02, respectively). More than 50% of patients with active colonic or small bowel disease showed zinc levels below the 15th percentile of the control group. Serum zinc levels correlated with plasma vitamin A in acute colitis (r = 0.67; p = 0.006), and with both serum albumin concentration (r = 0.76; p = 0.002) and disease activity score (r = -0.67, p = 0.009) in patients with small bowel disease. The copper:zinc ratio was higher in the active colitis group than in controls (p = 0.002). In spite of the increase in serum albumin levels and the decrease in disease activity, serum zinc levels remained low after total enteral nutrition. The implications of the abnormal trace element status in patients with inflammatory bowel disease are discussed. 
Tranexamic acid treatment of hemothorax in two patients with malignant mesothelioma. Patients with malignant mesothelioma may present with hemothorax. We used a combination of oral and intrapleural tranexamic acid to treat two patients with this severe complication. Initiation of treatment with this potent anti-fibrinolytic drug resulted in rapid reduction of bleeding and of transfusion requirements. 
Peripheral nerve lesions in hemophilia. Between 1962 and 1986, eighty-one of the 1351 admissions of patients who had hemophilia to the Nuffield Orthopaedic Centre were for peripheral nerve lesions. Eighty-eight such lesions were identified in fifty-four patients, and thirty-nine of these patients (sixty-one lesions) had adequate follow-up (mean, 8.4 years; range, four months to eighteen years). The femoral nerve was most commonly involved, but involvement of other peripheral nerves also occurred. In thirty (49 per cent) of the sixty-one lesions, the nerve had full motor and sensory recovery; in twenty-one (34 per cent), a residual sensory deficit; and in ten (16 per cent), both a persistent motor and sensory deficit. Patients who had antibodies to factor VIII were significantly less likely to recover full motor or sensory function than were those who did not have such antibodies, and the time to full motor recovery in these patients was significantly longer. 
Mammography in the management of patients with small breast cancers. Findings on mammography resulted in a change of treatment policy in 17 of 200 patients with small breast cancers (T1/T2 less than 4 cm, N0/N1, M0). Twelve patients were considered unsuitable for conservation therapy because of mammographic evidence of either extensive in situ carcinoma or more than one focus of invasive carcinoma. These patients were treated by mastectomy and histology confirmed widespread in situ carcinoma or multifocal/multicentric invasive carcinoma. Seven patients were found to have unsuspected contralateral lesions on mammography, of which five were subsequently shown to be malignant. Routine preoperative mammography is essential in the management of patients with small breast cancers. 
Treating insulin resistance in hypertension with metformin reduces both blood pressure and metabolic risk factors. Insulin resistance and hyperinsulinaemia may play an important role in both the development of hypertension and its accompanying metabolic aberrations. In order to investigate this possibility, nine non-obese, non-diabetic, non-smoking, middle-aged men with untreated hypertension were treated with metformin 850 mg b.i.d. for 6 weeks as a pilot study and within-patient comparison. Metformin decreased total and LDL-cholesterol (P less than 0.01), triglyceride (P less than 0.01), fasting plasma insulin (P less than 0.01) and C-peptide levels (P less than 0.02). Glucose disposal, an indicator of insulin action measured by means of the euglycaemic clamp technique, increased (P less than 0.001). Tissue plasminogen activator (t-PA) activity increased (P less than 0.02), and t-PA antigen decreased (P less than 0.01), whereas plasminogen activator inhibitor (PAI-1) and fibrinogen were unaffected by metformin treatment. Body weight remained unchanged. Withdrawal of metformin was associated with the return of both blood pressure and metabolism towards the initial levels. In conclusion, metformin treatment increased insulin action, lowered blood pressure, improved the metabolic risk factor profile and tended to increase the fibrinolytic activity in these mildly hypertensive subjects. These results support the view that insulin resistance plays a role in hypertension, and may open up a new field for the alleviation of abnormalities associated with cardiovascular disease. 
Generalized cortical dysplasia. Clinical and pathologic aspects. Three children with profound mental retardation and intractable seizures died at ages 10 months, 3 years, and 7 years, respectively. Complete examination of their brains showed generalized cortical dysplasia, without any major malformation of the external gyral pattern. The neuropathologic features of cortical dysplasia include abnormally thickened cortex with indistinct demarcation of the gray-white matter junction. In many areas, the cortex contained increased numbers of large neurons with disordered cortical lamination. Heterotopic neurons were scattered throughout the white matter with decreased myelination of the underlying white matter. To our knowledge, these cases represent the first fully detailed neuropathologic study of diffuse cortical dysplasia--a newly recognized entity of abnormal neuronal migration. 
Alcohol induction of ferritin expression in a human hepatoblastoma cell line (HEP G2). Hyperferritinemia, an unclear mechanism, is frequently observed in chronic alcoholics. The aim of this work was to study the effect of alcohol on ferritin expression in a human hepatoblastoma cell line, HepG2. This cell line proved to be sensitive to alcohol, since alcohol increased gamma-GT activity both in cells and media. The most striking result was the increase of ferritin in cells and media by alcohol. Moreover, this effect was specific, since it contrasted with a decrease in total protein synthesis and secretion, a decrease in transferrin excretion and a lack of effect on orosomucoid. In our model, alcohol was able to induce, in a specific manner, ferritin expression. 
Comparison of the findings on preoperative dipyridamole perfusion scintigraphy and intraoperative transesophageal echocardiography: implications regarding the identification of myocardium at ischemic risk. The evidence of myocardium at potential ischemic risk on preoperative dipyridamole perfusion scintigraphy was compared with that of manifest ischemia on intraoperative transesophageal echocardiography in 26 patients at high risk of a coronary event undergoing noncardiac surgery. The clinical outcome was also assessed. Induced intraoperative wall motion abnormalities were more common in patients and myocardial segments with, than in those without, a preoperative reversible perfusion defect (both p less than 0.05). Conversely, a preoperative reversible perfusion defect was more common in patients and segments with, than in those without, a new intraoperative wall motion abnormality (both p less than 0.05). Six patients, five with a reversible scintigraphic defect but only three with a new wall motion abnormality, had a hard perioperative ischemic event. Events occurred more often among patients with, than in those without, a reversible perioperative scintigraphic defect (5 [33%] of 15 vs. 1 [9%] of 11) but this difference did not reach significance (p = 0.14), probably owing to the sample size. Intraoperative wall motion abnormalities were all reversible and did not differentiate between risk groups; these findings were possibly influenced by treatment. These preliminary data support the known relation between reversible scintigraphic defects and perioperative events and identify another manifestation of ischemic risk in the relation between reversible scintigraphic defects and induced intraoperative wall motion abnormalities. The value of intraoperative echocardiography in identifying ischemia and guiding therapy in patients with a reversible scintigraphic abnormality should be further assessed. 
Recognition, management, and prevention of Clostridium septicum abscess in immunosuppressed patients. Spontaneous gas gangrene due to Clostridium septicum is a rapidly progressing disease that usually ends in fatal toxemia. We report three cases of asymptomatic C septicum abscesses to document the clinical course of this entity and to establish guidelines for its prevention and treatment. In contrast to previously reported data, C septicum infections can produce abscesses in solid organs, the retroperitoneum, and the extremities. These lesions often occur in patients with cancer, producing liver abscesses without gas formation that may be misinterpreted as metastatic carcinoma. Symptoms may be minimal or nonspecific before fulminant toxemia. Asymptomatic bacteremia should prompt a search for unsuspected cancer and an abscess. Computed tomography is the diagnostic modality of choice. The treatment consists of surgical debridement of necrotic tissue in concert with an appropriate course of antibiotics. We have found recurrences after adequate debridement and short-term antibiotic therapy, suggesting that prolonged and even lifelong prophylactic oral penicillin G potassium may be necessary to prevent further recurrences. 
Time course of hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction after endotoxin infusion in unanesthetized sheep. Endotoxin [lipopolysaccharide (LPS)] has been reported to reduce hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction and thus increases venous admixture. The time course of this failure of pulmonary blood flow regulation was investigated in six chronically instrumented unanesthetized sheep after infusion of Escherichia coli LPS (1 microgram/kg). The change in left pulmonary arterial blood flow (LPBF, ultrasonic transit time) in response to unilateral lung hypoxia (10 min of N2 alternately to the left and right lungs) was compared before and at various time intervals after the administration of LPS. During baseline conditions, LPBF was 33% of total cardiac output and decreased to 15% when the left lung was ventilated with a hypoxic gas mixture. One hour after endotoxin infusion, LPBF remained at 33% of total cardiac output yet only decreased to 28% during the hypoxic challenge. The response to one-lung hypoxia was still significantly depressed 10 h post-LPS administration. It is concluded that hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction is almost completely abolished for a prolonged time period after a small dose of LPS. 
Anterograde amnesia with fornix damage following removal of IIIrd ventricle colloid cyst. Two patients developed anterograde amnesia following the apparently uncomplicated transcallosal-transventricular removal of a colloid cyst. Damage to the fornical columns was demonstrated on CT and MRI scans, whilst other memory related structures were entirely normal. Longitudinal neuropsychological evaluation, over 12-24 months, has revealed a very similar pattern of deficit in the two cases: verbal memory has remained persistently impaired whilst nonverbal anterograde memory has improved to some degree. Formal tests of remote public (famous faces and events) and personal autobiographical memory have supported the clinical impression that neither patient has a temporally extensive retrograde amnesia. These findings address the role of the fornix, and the dissociation of memory processes in humans. 
Changes in upper airway resistance during progressive normocapnic hypoxia in normal men. The effects of normocapnic progressive hypoxia on nasal and pharyngeal resistances were evaluated in nine normal men. To calculate resistances, upper airway pressures were measured with two low-bias flow catheters; one was placed at the tip of the epiglottis and the other in the posterior nasopharynx, and we measured flow with a Fleish no. 3 pneumotachograph connected to a tightly fitting mask. Both resistances were obtained during a baseline period and during progressive normocapnic hypoxia achieved by a rebreathing method. We collected the breath-by-breath values of upper airway resistances, minute ventilation, O2 and CO2 fractions, arterial O2 saturation (SaO2), and changes in functional residual capacity (inductance vest). The central respiratory drive was evaluated by the mouth occlusion pressure 0.1 s after the onset of inspiration (P0.1), and breath-by-breath P0.1 values were estimated by intrapolation from the linear relationship between P0.1 and SaO2. In each subject both resistances decreased during the hypoxic test. The slope of the decrease in resistance with decreasing SaO2 (%baseline/%SaO2) was steeper for pharyngeal resistance than for nasal resistance [2.67 +/- 0.29 and 1.61 +/- 0.25 (SE), respectively; P less than 0.05]. The slope of the decrease in resistance with increasing P0.1 (%baseline/cmH2O) was -0.24 +/- 0.05 for nasal resistance and -0.39 +/- 0.07 for pharyngeal resistance (P less than 0.05). Functional residual capacity progressively increased during the test, but the decrease in resistance was greater than expected from an isolated increase in lung volume. We conclude that nasal and pharyngeal resistances decrease during progressive normocapnic hypoxia. 
Long-term angiographic follow-up after angioplasty of venous coronary bypass grafts. From April 1981 to June 1987, 57 patients underwent venous coronary bypass graft percutaneous angioplasty and had a minimal follow-up of 18 months. The procedure was elective for 28 patients, urgent for 19, and was considered as an emergency for 10. A total of 64 grafts were dilated that had been bypassed 58 +/- 48 months previously (range 2 to 184 months); lesions were located on the aortic anastomosis in 12 grafts, on the body in 38, and on the coronary anastomosis in 14. Technical success was 95.3% (61 of 64) per lesion; clinical success was 84.4% (54 of 64) per lesion and 82.5% (47 of 57) per patient. Thrombotic complications with images of a lacunar defect occurred in 11 grafts (17.2%). Predictive factors for these complications were: age of grafts 38.5% for greater than 60 month grafts versus 2.6% for less than 60 month grafts (p less than 0.01); site of lesion, body lesion 28.9% versus anastomosis none (p less than 0.01); type of lesion, concentric and short 6% versus other 29% (p less than 0.05); and recent fibrinolysis in 66% versus 10.6% (p less than 0.05). Long-term follow-up is available in the 47 successful patients and the three limited non-Q wave myocardial infarction patients. Two patients died at 13 and 17 months. Long-term angiographic follow-up is available in 45 of 48 patients or 94%. At the end of the study, 35 of 57 (61.4%) venous bypass grafts in 32 patients (64%) were patent after one or more percutaneous transluminal angioplasties. 
Differences in "primary response" gene expression in renal compensatory hypertrophy and hyperplasia. The induction of a family of primary response genes (ie, genes whose transcription is not dependent on new protein synthesis) occurs within minutes after stimulation of quiescent 3T3 cells by phorbol esters and growth factors. A similar pattern of gene expression is seen in PC-12 pheochromocytoma cells induced to differentiate by nerve growth factor (NGF), suggesting that a common set of activating signals occur in different forms of cell growth. To determine whether the same "activation" process occurs in renal hypertrophy, we measured mRNA levels in mice subjected to uninephrectomy (UNX) or sham operation. Regenerative renal hyperplasia was induced by intraperitoneal folic acid (FA) injection with vehicle as control. Northern blots showed induction of these genes by FA with elevated mRNA levels persisting for up to 24 to 48 hours. UNX and sham operation demonstrated a slight and transient elevation of mRNA levels, with a prompt return to basal levels by 60 minutes. 
Long-term psychologic implications of congenital heart disease: a 25-year follow-up. Patients with various types of congenital heart disease were contacted 25 years after their original examination at the Mayo Clinic. In addition to providing their current health status, level of education achieved, and current occupation, they were asked to complete a detailed standardized questionnaire to assess their degree of psychologic stress. Of the original 463 patients, 168 completed and returned the psychologic questionnaires. These patients had evidence of psychologic stress in excess of that expected on the basis of normative data. Furthermore, the degree of stress was unrelated to the clinical severity of the original cardiac defect. In addition, the psychologic stress occurred despite "success" as defined by educational achievement and occupational level. One can speculate that as children these patients were exposed to environmental stresses that may well have been colored by parental attitudes and perceptions. 
Spinal epidural hematoma causing cord compression after tissue plasminogen activator and heparin therapy. Bleeding is the most serious complication of thrombolytic therapy and limits its usefulness. We have reported a case of epidural hematoma, a rare occurrence after combined therapy with tissue plasminogen activator (TPA) and heparin. We emphasize that in patients treated with thrombolytic agents, any trauma may increase the risk of bleeding. The sudden onset of back pain and neurologic deficits should alert the clinician to the possibility of spinal hematoma with cord compression. 
Cerebral edema causing death in children with maple syrup urine disease. Four children with the classic form of maple syrup urine disease (MSUD) died of cerebral edema during an intercurrent infection that caused severe dehydration and acidosis. The diagnosis of MSUD had been established during the neonatal period in all four patients, on day 1 of life in three of them. All were in satisfactory control before the intercurrent illness. Two patients underwent peritoneal dialysis. Signs of brain-stem compression occurred after treatment, when biochemical abnormalities were improving. Computed tomography of the head, which was done in two patients, revealed cerebral edema; one of these patients also had subarachnoid hemorrhage. Autopsy in one case revealed cerebral edema with herniation. Our experience documents that cerebral edema may occur in the older child with MSUD as well as in the neonate. The pathogenesis of cerebral edema in MSUD remains unclear. Early treatment of dehydration and acidosis may prevent the catastrophic consequences that we have observed. 
The association of frequent headaches with personality and life events. The associations between personality traits, life events and frequent headaches were studied in a sample of 5766 adult subjects between 20 and 65 years of age from the general population. Subjects with at least weekly headaches had more life events and higher inadequacy, social inadequacy, rigidity and injuredness than subjects with less frequent headaches. These relationships were not observed in subjects of 50 years of age and older, with the exception of the association with inadequacy. From the traits measured, inadequacy had the highest odds ratios for frequent headaches and showed a modest interaction with the presence of a life event. These findings are in agreement with Sarason's interactional model. 
Inflammation at the neuromuscular junction in myasthenia gravis. To better define the pathogenic mechanisms in the antibody-mediated autoimmune disease myasthenia gravis (MG), we analyzed the morphology and electrophysiology of the neuromuscular junction in anconeus muscle biopsy specimens from eight patients with MG and seven control subjects. There were inflammatory cells at the neuromuscular junction in seven of the eight biopsies from MG patients. The endplate index (length of the postsynaptic membrane divided by the length of the apposed presynaptic membrane) was abnormally reduced in all the MG patients, and fiber type grouping, suggestive of reinnervation, was present in six of the eight MG patients. Intracellular recording revealed diminished amplitude of miniature endplate potentials and miniature endplate currents in the MG patients compared with the controls. The time constant of decay of miniature endplate currents did not differ from that of controls, suggesting no change in mean channel open time of the acetylcholine receptor. The endplate receptor sensitivity to iontophoretically applied acetylcholine was also decreased in MG patients compared with controls. The quantal content of neurally evoked endplate potentials was reduced in six of the eight MG patients, demonstrating abnormal presynaptic function as well. The presence of inflammatory cells at the neuromuscular junctions of limb muscles in MG reconciles an apparent disparity between the animal model of MG, experimental autoimmune myasthenia gravis, and the human disease. This study also demonstrates a frequent presynaptic component to the abnormal neuromuscular transmission in MG. 
On lowering lipids in the post-infarction patient. In patients with coronary heart disease (CHD) elevated serum cholesterol levels, like other classical risk factors, remain predictive of further coronary events. The excess risk attributable to raised cholesterol levels is considerable, and greater than that in subjects without CHD. A recent meta-analysis of all eight qualifying trials of secondary prevention of CHD by cholesterol lowering is reviewed. There were significant reductions in recurrent non-fatal and fatal CHD, with a downward trend in total mortality. Mechanisms underlying the relationship between cholesterol lowering and secondary prevention are reviewed. The implication of this analysis of trials for clinical practice is that hypercholesterolaemia should be sought and effectively treated in patients with CHD, unless contraindications are present. 
Glutathione peroxidase deficiency and childhood seizures. 4 children with intractable seizures, repeated infections, and intolerance to anticonvulsants had evidence of glutathione peroxidase deficiency. 2 had low intracellular enzyme activity but normal blood selenium and high plasma glutathione peroxidase concentrations. The other 2 had low intracellular glutathione peroxidase activity with low circulating glutathione peroxidase and selenium concentrations. The clinical state of the children improved after discontinuation of anticonvulsant medication and selenium substitution. 
Polysialic acid of the neural cell adhesion molecule distinguishes small cell lung carcinoma from carcinoids. The neural cell adhesion molecule (NCAM) exists in various types of neuroendocrine cells and their tumors. A typical feature of NCAM is polysialic acid, of which the chain length is developmentally regulated. The authors have performed a comparative immunohistochemical study on small cell lung carcinomas and bronchial as well as gastrointestinal carcinoids with the monoclonal antibody (MAb) 735 reactive with the long-chain form of polysialic acid. The small cell lung carcinomas, irrespective of their histological type, were positive for polysialic acid. Metastatic tumor cell complexes also exhibited immunostaining. The tumor cell-surface-associated immunostaining for polysialic acid was sensitive to endoneuraminidase. The mature and atypical bronchial and gastrointestinal carcinoids were not immunoreactive for polysialic acid. Cytoplasmic staining in groups of cells of carcinoids (2 of 28 cases) was due to nonspecific antibody binding, which could be prevented by increased ion strength. These data indicate that neuroendocrine tumors of the lung can be distinguished by their content of highly sialylated NCAM. 
Malignant tumors of the eye in geriatric patients. The ocular tissues can be the site of a number of malignant tumors in adults and geriatric patients. In addition to posing a threat to the patient's life, these tumors can cause severe visual loss or blindness. Therefore, the primary care clinician should be capable of prompt diagnosis of the various malignant ocular tumors and be prepared to refer the patient for appropriate management. This article provides a photographic guide to the most common primary and secondary malignancies that can affect the eyelid, conjunctiva, intraocular structures, and orbit in the geriatric patient. 
Restenosis after coronary angioplasty: a multivariate statistical model to relate lesion and procedure variables to restenosis. The M-HEART Investigators. The Multi-Hospital Eastern Atlantic Restenosis Trial group obtained follow-up angiography in 510 patients with 598 successfully dilated coronary lesions who were enrolled in a controlled trial of the effects of a single dose of 1 g of methylprednisolone on restenosis after coronary angioplasty. The overall restenosis rate was 39.6%. The strongest univariate relations to the restenosis rate were found for lesion location (saphenous vein graft, 68%; left anterior descending artery, 45%; left circumflex artery and right coronary artery, 32%; p = 0.002); lesion length (less than or equal to 4.6 mm, 33%; greater than 4.6 mm, 45%; p = 0.001); percent stenosis before angioplasty (less than or equal to 73%, 25%; greater than 73%, 43%; p = 0.005), percent stenosis after angioplasty (less than or equal to 21%, 33%; greater than 21%, 46%; p = 0.017) and arterial diameter (less than 2.9 mm, 44%; greater than or equal to 2.9 mm, 34%; p = 0.036). Two multivariate models to predict restenosis probability were developed with use of stepwise logistic regression. The preprocedural model, which included only variables whose values were known before angioplasty, entered lesion length, vein graft location, left anterior descending artery location, percent stenosis before angioplasty, eccentric lesion and arterial diameter. The postprocedural model, which also included variables whose values were known after angioplasty was performed, was similar to the preangioplasty model except that it also entered postangioplasty percent stenosis and "optimal" balloon sizing but did not enter eccentric lesion. These data indicate that the probability of restenosis after angioplasty is determined predominantly by the characteristics of the lesion being dilated. They are consistent with the known intimal proliferative mechanism of restenosis, offer a means of identifying lesions at unusually high or low risk of restenosis, and of predicting the likelihood that a particular lesion will restenose after angioplasty and provide a rationale for stratification by restenosis probability in the design of future studies of restenosis. 
Prenatal diagnosis of fetal left ventricular aneurysm: a case report and review. Fetal echocardiography in a 30-year-old black woman, gravida 4, para 3, demonstrated left ventricular aneurysm. This was confirmed by color flow pulsed Doppler techniques. After delivery, neonatal echocardiography and magnetic resonance imaging further confirmed the diagnosis. The infant was followed closely and underwent surgical correction at 8.5 months of age. Before surgery, cardiac catheterization demonstrated normal hemodynamic function. A review of the literature revealed a paucity of information. Issues of prenatal diagnosis, antenatal surveillance, method of delivery, and neonatal follow-up are not well defined in either the obstetric or pediatric cardiology literature. A rationale for our approach to this complex problem is presented. 
Community obstetric care in West Berkshire OBJECTIVE--To assess the effects of a revised obstetric booking policy whereby all low risk pregnant women received their antenatal care entirely in the community. DESIGN--Comparison of the distribution of antenatal clinic attendances, transfers, and perinatal mortality rates for 1987 and 1989, before and after introduction of the revised policy. SETTING--West Berkshire Health District. SUBJECTS--All women who delivered with a registrable birth in the district in 1987 (5817 women) and 1989 (5372). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES--Attendances at community and consultant antenatal clinics; bookings transferred from community care to consultant care; perinatal mortality rates. RESULTS--Of 5372 women delivering in West Berkshire in 1989, 3185 (58.3%) were originally booked for general practitioner-midwife care, of whom 1567 (49.2% of general practitioner-midwife bookings) were transferred to consultant care. 1618 women (30.1% of all women delivered) received their entire obstetric care from general practitioners and midwives. Attendance at hospital antenatal clinics was reduced by 16%. In 1989 the perinatal mortality rates (1987 values) for the district were 6.3 (7.6) per 1000 births overall; 8.2 (8.3) per 1000 consultant bookings; 5.0 (4.7) per 1000 for community bookings; and 10.2 (14.4) per 1000 for women transferred to consultant care. CONCLUSION--Antenatal care of low risk pregnant women may safely be provided by their general practitioner and midwife. 
Outcome of psychogenic seizures in children and adolescents compared with adults. We compared outcome of psychogenic seizures documented by video-EEG in 18 nonepileptic children and adolescents (ages 8 to 18; median, 14.5 years old) and 20 adults (ages 25 to 56; median, 34.0 years old). Outcome was significantly better for the younger patients at 1 year, 2 years, and 3 years after diagnosis. At these follow-up times, the percentages of children and adolescents free of psychogenic attacks were 73%, 75%, and 81%; at the same follow-up times, the percentages of adults free of psychogenic attacks were only 25%, 25%, and 40%. Factors leading to better outcome for younger patients may have been different psychological mechanisms at different ages of onset and greater effectiveness with earlier intervention. 
Criteria for the diagnosis of migraine in clinical practice. Criteria for the diagnosis of migraine have evolved from generalized descriptions to specific rules designed to ensure the selection of homogenous groups of patients for research studies. For clinical practice, the former are insufficiently specific and the latter are too complex. For care of headache patients by primary care physicians, we propose that the diagnosis of migraine without aura (common migraine) is warranted if any two of the following symptoms are present: unilateral site, throbbing quality, nausea, photophobia or phonophobia. These criteria are derived from a study comparing the features of 100 patients with migraine without aura and 100 patients with chronic daily headache. The proposed criteria for the diagnosis of migraine without aura were highly sensitive and adequately specific in discriminating groups. These simple criteria should facilitate the diagnosis of migraine by primary care physicians. 
Use of secondary prophylaxis against myocardial infarction in the north of England OBJECTIVE--To record the use of secondary prophylactic drugs in patients discharged from hospital having had a myocardial infarction. DESIGN--Prospective postal questionnaire survey of a random one in two sample of general practitioners in the region. SETTING--The nine family practitioner committee areas within the Northern Regional Health Authority. PATIENTS--Patients who had had a myocardial infarction and were discharged to their general practitioner. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE--Whether beta blockers or aspirin, or both, were given on discharge. RESULTS--Of 267 patients, 158 (59%) were treated suboptimally in that they did not receive a secondary prophylactic drug to which they had no contraindication. For most patients this entailed underuse of one drug, but 17 (6%) of patients received no treatment. beta Blockers were 2.5 times less likely to be used than aspirin. Treatment was not associated with the age or sex of the patient, risk of further infarction, or hospital of discharge. CONCLUSIONS--Secondary prophylaxis after myocardial infarction is practised haphazardly. It should be offered to all patients who can tolerate it, after a trial period to assess any side effects of the drugs if necessary. 
Impairment of mitochondrial transcription termination by a point mutation associated with the MELAS subgroup of mitochondrial encephalomyopathies. Defects in mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) are associated with several different human diseases, including the mitochondrial encephalomyopathies. The mutations include deletions but also duplications and point mutations. Individuals with MELAS (mitochondrial myopathy, encephalopathy, lactic acidosis and stroke-like episodes) carry a common A-to-G substitution in a highly conserved portion of the gene for transfer RNA(Leu(UUR)). Although the MELAS mutation may be comparable to the defect in the tRNA(Lys) gene associated with MERRF (myoclonus epilepsy associated with ragged-red fibres), it is also embedded in the middle of a tridecamer sequence necessary for the formation of the 3' ends of 16S ribosomal RNA in vitro. We found that the MELAS mutation results in severe impairment of 16S rRNA transcription termination, which correlates with a reduced affinity of the partially purified termination protein for the MELAS template. This suggests that the molecular defect in MELAS is the inability to produce the correct type and quantity of rRNA relative to other mitochondrial gene products. 
Differential effects of thromboxane A2 synthase inhibition, singly or combined with thromboxane A2/prostaglandin endoperoxide receptor antagonism, on occlusive thrombosis elicited by endothelial cell injury or by deep vascular damage in canine coronary arteries. In open-chest dogs, cyclic flow reductions (CFRs, 5.1-6.6/hr in controls; n = 24) caused by platelet deposition/dislodgment at sites of endothelial cell injury in critically stenosed left anterior descending coronary arteries (59% flow reduction) were attenuated to the same extent either by single thromboxane A2 (TXA2) synthase inhibition (0.31 mg/kg i.v. ridogrel; CFR, 0.16 +/- 0.16/hr; n = 6; p less than 0.05) or by a comparatively modest degree of TXA2/prostaglandin endoperoxide receptor antagonism on top of TXA2 synthase inhibition (5 mg/kg i.v. ridogrel; CFR, 0.22 +/- 0.1/hr; n = 10; p less than 0.05). By contrast, occlusive thrombosis on deep vascular damage elicited by intraluminal stimulation (150-microA anodal constant current) in nonpreconstricted canine coronary arteries (time to occlusion, 237.1 +/- 13.9 minutes; n = 7; incidence of occlusion within 300 minutes, six of seven experiments) was not affected by platelet cyclooxygenase inhibition (5 mg/kg i.v. acetylsalicylic acid; n = 7), single TXA2 synthase inhibition (1.25 mg/kg i.v. ridogrel; n = 7), or single TXA2/prostaglandin endoperoxide receptor antagonism (10 mg/kg + 10 mg/kg/hr i.v. sulotroban for 300 minutes; n = 5). However, such an occlusive thrombus formation was significantly reduced by combined TXA2 synthase/prostaglandin endoperoxide receptor inhibition (5 mg/kg i.v. ridogrel; time to occlusion greater than 300 minutes, n = 7; incidence of occlusion within 300 minutes, one of seven experiments; p less than 0.05). This study reveals 1) a differential efficacy of TXA2 synthase inhibition, singly or combined with TXA2/prostaglandin endoperoxide receptor antagonism, depending on the extent of the vessel wall lesion triggering thrombosis and the size of the thrombus required to obstruct the vascular lumen and 2) a significant synergism in preventing occlusive thrombosis of extensively damaged coronary arteries between strong TXA2 synthase inhibition and comparatively modest TXA2/prostaglandin endoperoxide receptor antagonism with ridogrel. 
Double blind crossover comparison of the effects of dual chamber pacing (DDD) and ventricular rate adaptive (VVIR) pacing on neuroendocrine variables, exercise performance, and symptoms in complete heart block. OBJECTIVE--To compare the effects of dual chamber pacing (DDD) and ventricular rate adaptive pacing (activity sensing) (VVIR) in patients with complete heart block. DESIGN--Double blind crossover comparison with one month in each pacing mode. PATIENTS--10 consecutive patients aged 23-74 presenting with complete anterograde atrioventricular block at rest and on exercise and with an intact atrial rate response received Synergyst I (Medtronic) pacemakers. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES--Symptom scores, maximal exercise performance on a treadmill, and the plasma concentrations of atrial natriuretic peptide, adrenaline, and noradrenaline. RESULTS--No significant differences were identified between pacing modes in symptom scores for dyspnoea, fatigue, and mood disturbance; exercise time; and maximal oxygen consumption. One patient with intact ventriculoatrial conduction developed pacemaker syndrome during VVIR pacing. Resting plasma concentrations of atrial natriuretic peptide were raised in complete heart block and were restored to normal by DDD pacing but not by VVIR pacing. Resting plasma catecholamine concentrations were normal in complete heart block and in both pacing modes. During exercise the increase in the concentrations of all three hormones was similar in both pacing modes. CONCLUSIONS--In patients with complete anterograde and retrograde atrioventricular block, symptoms and maximal exercise performance were no better during DDD than during VVIR pacing. 
Epstein-Barr virus and persistent graft dysfunction after liver transplantation. Epstein-Barr virus infection has been associated with a broad spectrum of clinical manifestations, depending on the immune status of the host. In this report, we describe two liver transplant patients who received hepatic allografts from donors serologically positive for Epstein-Barr virus and who experienced primary infection with Epstein-Barr virus associated with prolonged liver graft dysfunction. In both patients, Epstein-Barr serologies converted within 3 mo of liver transplantation, and hepatic histological study revealed mononuclear infiltration of the sinusoids evolving to pronounced immunoblastic features suggestive of evolving lymphoma. In both cases, in situ hybridization studies confirmed the presence of Epstein-Barr virus genome in the liver. Furthermore, polymerase chain reaction analysis suggested that high levels of Epstein-Barr virus DNA were present in biopsy specimens obtained during the episode of acute hepatitis that followed Epstein-Barr virus seroconversion. The degree of Epstein-Barr virus DNA estimated by polymerase chain reaction appeared to increase in parallel with the progression of parenchymal lymphocytic infiltrates. In one patient, a biopsy sample from a cervical node also revealed high levels of Epstein-Barr virus DNA estimated using the polymerase chain reaction technique. Furthermore, in these patients, Epstein-Barr virus DNA levels appeared to decrease dramatically after discontinuing azathioprine administration and beginning treatment with acyclovir. These two cases illustrate the dynamics of Epstein-Barr virus immune regulation and confirm chronic hepatic allograft dysfunction related to Epstein-Barr viral infection. 
Pseudarthrosis of the scaphoid treated by the Matti-Russe operation. A long-term review of 77 cases. We report the long-term results of the Matti-Russe operation for pseudarthrosis of the scaphoid in 100 cases, reported previously by Mulder in 1968. Clinical results for 77 patients and radiographic data for 74 were reviewed at 22 to 34.8 years after surgery. In general, there was satisfactory relief of pain and stiffness but some patients had limitation of motion and reduced grip-strength, with usually slight osteoarthritic changes. There was poor correlation between subjective, objective, and radiographic results but 88% of the patients were satisfied with their results. 
Hydroureteronephrosis secondary to perforated Meckel's diverticulum. Complications related to Meckel's diverticulum are not unusual. However, involvement of the urinary tract is extremely rare. To our knowledge this is the first reported case of ureteral obstruction due to perforation of Meckel's diverticulum. 
Pathogenesis of respiratory infections due to influenza virus: implications for developing countries. The influenza viruses have an important and distinctive place among respiratory viruses: they change antigenic character at irregular intervals, infect individuals of all ages, cause illnesses characterized by constitutional symptoms and tracheobronchitis, produce yearly epidemics associated frequently with excess morbidity and mortality, and predispose the host to bacterial superinfections. Much is known about influenza viruses, but their role in respiratory infections among children in developing countries is poorly understood, and the risk factors that lead to the excess morbidity and mortality have not been identified clearly. Among the many risk factors that may be important are alterations in host immunity, malnutrition, prior or coincident infections with other microorganisms, inhaled pollutants, and lack of access to medical care. There is a great need for research that can establish more precisely the role these and other unidentified factors play in the pathogenesis of influenza infections in children in the developing world. 
Expression of atrial natriuretic factor in the human ventricle is independent of chamber dilation This study investigated the presence of atrial natriuretic factor in ventricular tissue obtained from humans with dilated or restrictive heart disease. In 17 patients with ventricular dilation and impaired systolic function and in 8 patients with restrictive heart disease and preserved systolic function, the presence of ventricular atrial natriuretic factor was investigated in tissue obtained by ventricular endomyocardial biopsy. The objective of the study was to determine if the ventricular presence of atrial natriuretic factor is dependent on ventricular dilation. Left ventricular end-diastolic volume index was greater in the group with dilated cardiomyopathy than in the group with restrictive cardiomyopathy (134 +/- 13 versus 78 +/- 5 ml/m2, p less than 0.05); end-diastolic pressure was elevated in the two groups (20 +/- 2 versus 25 +/- 4 mm Hg, p = NS). With the use of immunohistochemical techniques, ventricular atrial natriuretic factor was clearly detected in 15 of the 17 patients with dilated cardiomyopathy and in 6 of the 8 patients with restrictive cardiomyopathy. This study demonstrates the high prevalence of ventricular atrial natriuretic factor in living patients with either systolic or diastolic dysfunction. Whereas in the atria, stretch or dilation may be an important stimulus, atrial natriuretic factor in the ventricular chamber occurs independent of dilation. 
Knowledge-based computer system to aid in the histopathological diagnosis of breast disease. A knowledge-based computer system, designed to assist pathologists in the histological diagnosis of breast disease, is described. This system represents knowledge in the form of "disease profiles" and uses a novel inference model based on the mathematical technique of hypergraphs. Its design overcomes many of the limitations of existing expert system technologies when applied to breast disease. In particular, the system can quickly focus on a differential problem and thus reduce the amount of data necessary to reach a conclusion. The system was tested on two sets of samples, consisting of 14 retrospective cases and five hypothetical cases of breast disease. Its recommendations were judged "correct" by the evaluating pathologist in 15 cases. This study shows the feasibility of providing "decision support" in histopathology. 
Diurnal variations of neurocardiac rhythms in acute myocardial infarction. To determine the diurnal pattern of cardiac autonomic tone in acute myocardial infarction (AMI), this study examined the power spectrum of heart rate (HR) variability in 24 patients during a single 24-hour segment within 4 days of AMI. Patients were nonrandomly allocated to a group (n = 14) without autonomic drugs and to a group (n = 10) already receiving beta blockers at the time of AMI. With use of autoregressive modeling, the power spectrum of HR variability was computed from continuous 1-hour electrocardiographic segments recorded at equally spaced intervals; 7 to 8 A.M., 3 to 4 P.M., and 11 to 12 P.M. All patients were supine, awake and pain free during recordings. There were no differences in HR, HR variance or the low-frequency peak power (0.06 to 0.1 Hz) from one temporal sequence to another. For the patients not taking beta blockers, the high-frequency peak power (0.2 to 0.36 Hz) or vagal component increased significantly from 3 P.M. to 11 P.M. (28 +/- 11 to 45 +/- 20 beats/min2.Hz-1, p less than 0.01). There was a significant decrease in the low- to high-frequency peak power and area ratios from 3 P.M. to 11 P.M. All power spectral parameters in the patients taking beta blockers remained unchanged over 24 hours. There was significantly heightened vagal modulation of sinus node activity in those receiving beta blockers, especially at 7 A.M. and 3 P.M. The data suggest that under steady-state wakeful conditions in the early recovery phase after an AMI, vagal tone is more pronounced during the late evening hours with a possible shift to relative sympathetic dominance during early morning and midafternoon hours. 
Argyrophilic nucleolar organizer regions and alpha-fetoprotein in adenomatous hyperplasia in human cirrhotic livers. Recently, adenomatous hyperplasia (AH) of the liver has been suspected as a precancerous lesion in human hepatocarcinogenesis. The authors examined 75 cases of AH from 42 cirrhotic livers, using staining of argyrophilic nucleolar organizer regions (AgNORs). These reflect proliferative cell activity. Findings in AH were compared with those seen in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and other chronic liver diseases. Expression of alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) was also examined immunohistochemically. The authors classified AH into three types: ordinary (OAH), atypical (AAH), and AH with focal malignancy (FM). OAH implies a lack of atypia; AAH represents AH with structural and cellular atypia but without the features of overt carcinoma; and FM denotes AH with foci of overt HCC. Forty of the 75 cases of AH were categorized as OAH, 19 as AAH, and 16 as FM. The noncancerous areas of FM had features of AAH. The mean number of AgNORs in AH was intermediate between that seen in cirrhosis (2.93) and HCC (6.18) and showed a step-wise increase in the following order: OAH (2.95), AAH (3.89), noncancerous areas in FM (4.58), and malignant foci in FM (5.71). There was no significant difference in AgNOR counts between OAH and cirrhosis. AgNOR counts in AAH and FM were significantly higher than those of OAH, and lower than those of HCC. AFP was positive in 12 of 25 HCCs and in malignant foci of 3 FM lesions, but it was absent in OAH and AAH. These data suggest that OAH has a limited capacity for proliferation but that AAH and FM are much more replicative. The latter two conditions are probably preneoplastic lesions or early forms of HCC. 
Explicit memory and repetition priming in depression. Preliminary findings. Explicit memory and repetition priming, a form of implicit memory, were examined in depressed patients and controls. Explicit memory of depressed patients was severely impaired, whereas repetition priming was intact. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that the impairment of memory in depression is linked to a failure of effort-demanding cognitive processes. Repetition priming might be useful in differentiating between depression and dementia. 
Lupron retards proliferation of ovarian epithelial tumor cells cultured in serum-free medium. Some patients with recurrent ovarian epithelial cancer respond favorably to treatment with GnRH agonists. This effect was proposed to be mediated by suppression of pituitary gonadotropin release. The present in vitro study investigated effects of human gonadotropin (Pergonal LH/FSH, 1:1) and Lupron, a GnRH agonist, on proliferation of an ovarian cancer cell line, 2774, which is estrogen receptor negative and grows well in serum-free, defined medium. Pergonal, 10 IU/mL or 30 IU/mL, did not enhance cell proliferation, which argues against stabilization of ovarian tumors in vivo due to decreased serum gonadotropin. Lupron, 1.4 micrograms/mL and 140 micrograms/mL, retarded cell division by day 6-8 of culture, in a dose-dependent manner. Flow cytometric cell cycle phase DNA analysis demonstrated Lupron caused a reversible 5-6% increase in the portion of cells in rest phase, G0/G1, compared to controls during log growth, and a corresponding decrease in the portion of cells in DNA synthesis, S phase. However, long-term culture, 3 weeks, with Lupron failed to arrest cells in G0/G1, and experimental cultures plateaued at cell number similar to control cultures. We conclude Lupron's effect on ovarian cancer cell proliferation is independent of gonadotropin and steroid, involves a cell cycle regulatory event, and duration of benefit observed in vivo for some patients may be related to total tumor volume at the time of treatment. 
Early-initiated zidovudine therapy prevents disease but not low levels of persistent retrovirus in mice. An F1 hybrid mouse strain containing the Rfv-3r/s genotype was inoculated with Friend virus complex (FV) and treated with zidovudine (ZDV) intraperitoneally three times daily for 20 days beginning as early as 10 min after initial viral exposure. This strain of mice develops FV-specific neutralizing antibodies that aid in reducing viremia and splenic virus titers but do not prevent splenomegaly and eventual FV-associated death. The virally exposed mice treated with ZDV did not develop splenomegaly or have detectable viremia after the last drug treatment. On day 21, a single animal had demonstrable virus in the spleen as determined by a focal immunoenzyme assay; 57% had detectable virus at 5 weeks, but non displayed splenic virus after 35 weeks. None of the animals died after the 35-week holding period, compared to 38% dying in placebo-treated mice. To detect low levels of the virus, or potentially latent virus, splenocytes were cocultivated with a cell line known to readily propagate FV, and the cells were subsequently passaged four times to amplify replication of the virus. After amplification, a significant increase was seen in the number of mice testing positive for virus. Thus, ZDV treatment initiated early after virus exposure was effective in preventing FV-induced splenomegaly and death, but did not prevent low levels of persistent retrovirus in the mice. 
Minute lesions of the rectum and sigmoid colon in patients with Crohn's disease. Sigmoidoscopy with a spray of 0.1% indigocarmine was performed on 20 patients with Crohn's disease whose main lesions were located proximal to the transverse colon and on 10 age-matched healthy volunteers. Minute lesions such as apthoid lesions, areas of erythema, and small ulcers were found in 90% of patients with Crohn's disease and in 0% of healthy volunteers (p less than 0.001). Among the minute lesions, aphthoid lesions were found in the highest incidence (85%). It was difficult to determine the presence of aphthoid lesions without the spray of indigocarmine, which facilitated detection. Histologically, granulomas were found in 15% of patients with Crohn's disease. Aphthoid lesions were not associated with superficial erosions and lymphoid follicles. The presence of aphthoid lesions in the rectum and sigmoid colon would be a strong indication of the presence of Crohn's disease. 
Regional changes in hemodynamics and cardiac myocyte size in rats with aortocaval fistulas. 2. Long-term effects. Regional changes in hemodynamics and cardiac myocyte size were examined in adult rats 5 months after creating a large aortocaval fistula. At that time, cardiac output, left and right ventricular pressures, and left and right ventricular dP/dtmax were measured. Subsequently, isolated cardiac myocytes were collected from the left ventricle, right ventricle, and septum for cell size measurements. Compared with sham-operated controls, percent dry weight was reduced in the liver and kidney but was unchanged in the lung. Heart rate, left ventricular systolic pressure, left ventricular dP/dtmax, and systolic aortic pressure were not changed in rats with fistulas. However, cardiac output, stroke volume, left ventricular end-diastolic pressure, and all measured parameters in the right ventricle were significantly increased. Mean cell volume and the ratio of heart weight to body weight were both elevated 92%. Cell volume, cell length, and cross-sectional area increased significantly in each heart region examined. Hypertrophy was more pronounced in cells from the right ventricle and the endomyocardium of the left ventricle. The percentage of cells with mononucleation or binucleation was not changed in any heart region of rats with fistulas. In summary, despite evidence of renal and hepatic congestion, most indexes of cardiac function were normal or elevated 5 months after creation of a large volume-overload-induced hypertrophy. Data from isolated cardiac myocytes suggested that cellular hypertrophy, rather than hyperplasia, was responsible for the increased cardiac mass. 
Somatosensory function following dorsal root entry zone lesions in patients with neurogenic pain or spasticity. The goal of this study was to assess the effects of the dorsal root entry zone (DREZ) lesioning procedure, microsurgical DREZ-otomy (MDT), on spinal cord somatosensory function based on peri- and intraoperative clinical and electrophysiological data. The study was performed prospectively on a series of 20 patients suffering from either chronic neurogenic pain or spasticity. Physiological observations were made of the intraoperative evoked electrospinographic recordings as collected from the surface of the spinal cord. The MDT procedure produced analgesia or severe hypalgesia, moderate hypesthesia, and only slight deficits in proprioception and cutaneous spatial discrimination on the body segments operated on. These clinical data correlated well with evoked electrospinographic recordings, which showed a moderate effect of MDT on presynaptic compound action potentials recorded from the spinal cord (N11 and N21), a partial or even reversible effect on the cortical postcentral N20 wave, a more marked effect on the postsynaptic dorsal horn waves N13 and N24 related to large primary afferent fibers, and a disappearance of dorsal horn waves related to finer afferents (N2 and possibly N3). These data provide evidence for an acceptably selective action of MDT on spinal cord nociceptive mechanisms, and for a partial, often slight, involvement of the other somatosensory domains. The presence of abnormal evoked electrospinographic waves is discussed in relation to the mechanisms of neurogenic pain and spasticity. The hypothesis of a "retuning" of the dorsal horn as the mode of action of MDT is presented. 
Control of local blood flow in pulmonary inflammation: role for neutrophils, PAF, and thromboxane. The intrapulmonary instillation of C5a results in a local inflammatory response that, in this site, is accompanied by a decrease in local blood flow. Reversal of this decrease by vasodilators or the thromboxane synthesis inhibitor dazmegral has been shown to result in enhanced lung inflammation. In the present study the mechanisms underlying the decrease in flow in pulmonary inflammation were investigated in the rabbit in vivo and in the isolated blood-perfused rabbit lung. In vivo, the decrease in local blood flow was shown to be dependent on circulating neutrophils. In the isolated blood-perfused lung, inflammation induced by airway instillation of C5a was similar histologically to that seen in vivo and was also accompanied by a decrease in local blood flow. The decrease in blood flow appeared to require circulating neutrophils and was prevented by dazmegral and the platelet-activating factor (PAF) antagonists WEB 2086 and L-659,989. Furthermore, no decrease occurred in aspirin-treated lungs perfused with normal blood, suggesting that the source of thromboxane was lung rather than circulating cells. The decrease in blood flow in inflammation did not appear to be a consequence of hypoxic vasoconstriction. Inflammation in the guinea pig lung was also accompanied by a decrease in local blood flow and was also prevented by dazmegral and PAF antagonists. We conclude that local inflammation in the lung is accompanied by a decrease in blood flow that involves neutrophils and the lipid mediators PAF and thromboxane. We suggest that this form of negative feedback by the neutrophil serves to control the inflammatory response. 
Role of echocardiography in the diagnosis and evaluation of severity of mitral and tricuspid stenosis. The presence, severity, and hemodynamic consequences of mitral and tricuspid stenosis can be determined by echocardiographic techniques. In mitral stenosis two-dimensional echocardiographic imaging allows definition of leaflet anatomy and dynamics, subvalvular disease, ventricular function, and involvement of other valves. Spectral and color Doppler echocardiographic techniques permit accurate measurement of transvalvular gradient, determination of functional orifice area, evaluation of associated valvular regurgitation, and assessment of pulmonary artery pressures. These approaches are of recognized clinical value, and they provide additional diagnostic information that is unavailable from clinical assessment alone in a significant number of patients. Compared with available invasive diagnostic standards of reference, echocardiographic data have been found to be comparable in accuracy. In tricuspid stenosis echocardiographic imaging and Doppler techniques provide an assessment of valve morphology and function that should be similarly useful in clinical management decisions, although rigorous comparative studies have not been performed. Currently, carefully done echocardiographic studies are a definitive means of establishing the presence and significance of mitral stenosis and tricuspid stenosis, thereby obviating the need for invasive evaluation in many patients, reducing risk, and potentially decreasing the cost of diagnostic assessment. 
Lack of diameter effect on short-term patency of size-matched Dacron aortobifemoral grafts. This study examined the relationship between graft diameter and subsequent patency in 79 patients who received Dacron aortobifemoral bypass grafts for aortoiliac occlusive disease between 1985 and 1989. Sixty-five percent of these patients were men, 25% were diabetic, and 94% were smokers, with an average age of 62 years. Patients were followed for a mean interval of 24 months. Life-table survival was 92% at 3 years. All surviving patients showed "significant" postoperative improvement by use of Society for Vascular Surgery/International Society for Cardiovascular Surgery combined clinical and vascular laboratory criteria. There were three early and five late graft thromboses. Primary and secondary life-table patencies were 85% and 92%, respectively, at 3 years. Dacron bifurcation grafts were selected to match the size of native arteries. Patients receiving small diameter grafts, defined as 12 mm (n = 9) and 14 mm (n = 39), were compared with patients receiving large diameter grafts of 16 mm (n = 26) and 18 mm (n = 5). Small diameter grafts were more likely to be used in women (p less than 0.01), but patient groups were otherwise comparable with respect to age, smoking history, diabetes, outflow status, operative indications, type of proximal anastomosis (end-to-end or end-to-side), location of distal anastomosis (common femoral vs deep femoral), type of graft construction (knitted vs woven), and functional result. Graft diameter did not influence life-table patency, which was 84% for small and 87% for large diameter grafts at 3 years (p = 0.74). Furthermore, none of the other variables listed above influenced graft patency. 
Amnesia following damage to the left fornix and to other sites. A comparative study. Two memory-impaired patients, who had suffered damage to the left or both fornix columns during removal of a ventricular cyst, were compared with 3 others having left-sided hippocampal or thalamic lesions, and with normal controls. The tests used were nonverbal--scene recognition, delayed matching-to-sample and concurrent pattern and object discrimination learning. The last two are differentially sensitive to fornix transection and to hippocampal or thalamic ablations in monkeys; however, the patients with fornix damage did not show a distinctive pattern of impairment. The reasons for this discrepancy are discussed. The study adds to the evidence that fornix transection can cause wide-ranging memory disturbances in man. 
DNA ploidy analysis of effectiveness of radiation therapy for cervical carcinoma. Cellular DNA content from 30 patients with cervical carcinoma was determined using flow cytometry before and after radiation therapy (RT). The authors attempted to correlate changes in DNA content, tumor response to RT, and post-RT pathologic findings. Before RT, tumors from eight of 30 patients (26.7%) were diploid or near-diploid; tumors from 22 patients (73.3%) were aneuploid. After RT, diploid or near-diploid tumors were found in 23 patients (76.7%), and aneuploid tumors were observed in seven patients (23.3%). Aneuploidy disappeared in 15 of the patient tumors, and complete tumor response (CR) was observed in 13 of these 15 patients (86.7%). Pathologic examinations were negative in 12 of 15 cases and suspicious in one of 15 cases. Of the seven patients whose tumor aneuploidy did not change after RT, CR was observed in only two (28.7%). Pathologic examinations were positive in five of seven cases and suspicious in one of seven cases. The CR for the 22 patients with pre-RT aneuploid tumors was 15 of 22 (68.2%); the CR for the eight patients with pre-RT diploid tumors was two of eight (25%, P less than 0.01). From these data the authors conclude there is a direct correlation between DNA content and radiosensitivity in cervical carcinoma. Aneuploid tumors from these patients were more radiosensitive than diploid tumors, and they patients had a better clinical tumor response and improved pathologic findings. 
Enhanced GABAergic inhibition preserves hippocampal structure and function in a model of epilepsy. Extensive electrical stimulation of the perforant pathway input to the hippocampus results in a characteristic pattern of neuronal death, which is accompanied by an impairment of cognitive functions similar to that seen in human temporal lobe epilepsy. The excitotoxic hypothesis of epileptic cell death [Olney, J. W. (1978) in Kainic Acid as a Tool in Neurobiology, eds. McGeer, E., Olney, J. W. & McGeer, P. (Raven, New York), pp. 95-121; Olney, J. W. (1983) in Excitotoxins, eds. Fuxe, K., Roberts, P. J. & Schwartch, R. (Wenner-Gren International Symposium Series, Macmillan, London), Vol. 39, pp. 82-96; and Rothman, S. M. & Olney, J. W. (1986) Ann. Neurol. 19, 105-111] predicts an imbalance between excitation and inhibition, which occurs probably as a result of hyperactivity in afferent pathways or impaired inhibition. In the present study, we investigated whether the enhancement of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA)-mediated (GABAergic) inhibition of neurotransmission by blocking the GABA-metabolizing enzyme, GABA transaminase, could influence the histopathological and/or the behavioral outcome in this epilepsy model. We demonstrate that the loss of pyramidal cells and hilar somatostatin-containing neurons can be abolished by enhancing the level of synaptically released GABA, and that the preservation of hippocampal structure is accompanied by a significant sparing of spatial memory as compared with placebo-treated controls. These results suggest that enhanced GABAergic inhibition can effectively block the pathophysiological processes that lead to excitotoxic cell death and, as a result, protect the brain from seizure-induced cognitive impairment. 
Cortical blindness in children: a study of etiology and prognosis. Thirty-four children (20 boys, 14 girls) with congenital and acquired cortical blindness were analyzed for visual outcome in relation to etiology, visual evoked potentials, electroencephalography, and cranial computed tomography. All 7 children with congenital cortical blindness remained blind on subsequent examination. Of the 27 children with acquired blindness, 16 (59%) had poor visual outcome. Poor visual outcome occurred in those with cardiac arrest, hypoxia, status epilepticus, intracranial hemorrhage, cerebral thrombosis, and head trauma. Good visual outcome occurred in children with hypotensive episodes after cardiac surgery. Of the 12 children with recovery of vision, the interval from acute loss of vision to partial or total recovery was 2 weeks to 5 months. Seven children had complete recovery of vision with no residual visual field defect. The majority of children (87%) had focal or multifocal spike-and-waves and slow sharp-wave discharges on electroencephalography. None had photic recruitment response or occipital spike-and-wave discharges. Flash visual evoked potential studies performed during acute episodes of cortical blindness documented 11 with absent response, 10 with bilateral increases in latency, and 6 with normal responses. There was no correlation between normal visual evoked potentials and a good visual outcome. Only 2 of 6 children with normal responses had normal vision. Abnormal or absent responses are more predictive of a poor recovery of vision because only 3 of 21 (14%) had normal vision on subsequent examination. Abnormal electroencephalographic findings with focal or multifocal spike-and-wave discharges or cerebral atrophy on cranial computed tomography are also poor prognostic signs. 
Factors affecting ability to resume oral nutrition in the oropharyngeal dysphagic individual. Successful oral intake of nutrition depends not only on the patient's ability to swallow efficiently and safely but also a number of cognitive, neurolinguistic, and behavioral variables. This paper reviews these competencies as they are integrated into the act of oral feeding and describes the types of disorders that affect these abilities. Methods of evaluating and treating the abilities needed for successful oral intake are described. 
Recurrent abortion and the diagnosis of Wilson disease. We describe the first patient with Wilson disease and recurrent abortion who was effectively treated with oral zinc for both conditions. Between the ages of 21-26, this patient experienced seven successive unexplained abortions. At age 27, neurologic signs and liver function disturbances appeared. Wilson disease was diagnosed when Kayser-Fleischer rings were detected in the cornea. Decoppering therapy was instituted with zinc sulfate per os. By the age of 31, hepatic and neurologic signs had vanished. The patient conceived, and after an uncomplicated eighth pregnancy she delivered her first healthy child. Two years later, a ninth pregnancy was equally successful. The chance that Wilson disease may be the cause of recurrent abortion is small. However, because the disease is fatal if left untreated and because it is an underdiagnosed disease, we recommend screening for Wilson disease in cases of unexplained recurrent abortion when family history demonstrates consanguinity or neurologic, psychiatric, and/or liver disorders. A strategy to this end is proposed. 
Ki-67 immunostaining in node-negative stage I/II breast carcinoma. Significant correlation with prognosis. Prognostic predictors for node-negative breast carcinoma have not been clearly established. Immunostaining with Ki-67 antibody was performed on frozen sections of histologically proved node-negative breast carcinomas from 42 patients to examine its prognostic value and its association with other clinicopathologic and biochemical parameters, i.e., patient age and tumor size, histologic type, nuclear grade, mitotic rate, presence of vascular or lymphatic invasion, DNA ploidy, percentage of cells in S-phase, estrogen content, and c-erbB-2 amplification. Thirty-seven of the 42 tumors showed immunoreactivity with Ki-67 antibody in 1% to 55% of the tumor cells. A strongly significant correlation was observed between Ki-67 staining percentage and, respectively, nuclear grade, age, and mitotic rate. Nuclear grade 1 (the most anaplastic) tumors showed a significantly higher median percentage of cells stained (median, 14; range, 3 to 40) compared with nuclear grade 3 tumors (median, 0.5; range, 0 to 8). Thirteen patients developed recurrence; six of them died of disease. On univariate analysis, both 5-year disease-free and overall survivals were strongly associated with percentage of cells stained with Ki-67 antibody. Our results suggest that Ki-67 immunostaining correlates well with nuclear grade and clinical outcome in node-negative breast carcinoma. Because of small sample size analyzed in this study we were unable to do multivariate analysis. Therefore, further studies with larger number of cases are needed to determine whether tumor proliferative activity determined by Ki-67 immunostaining is an independent prognostic parameter or it merely reflects histopathologic features such as nuclear grade or mitotic activity. 
A forensic application of DNA typing. Paternity determination in a putrefied fetus. Using minisatellite DNA probes that hybridize to a variable number of tandemly repeated loci, an individual-specific DNA fingerprint can be determined. In the case reported here, we succeeded in extracting high-molecular-weight DNA from a 3-month-old fetus discovered during the autopsy of a murdered 28-year-old pregnant woman reported missing 10 days earlier. The results of analysis of restriction-fragment-length polymorphisms showed that all bands present in the fetus's pattern, but absent in the mother's, matched only those of the putative father. Thus, the paternity of the victim's husband was ruled out. 
Chemotherapy dose intensity correlates strongly with response, median survival, and median progression-free survival in metastatic neuroblastoma We examined the efficacy of five commonly used drugs, teniposide (VM26), cisplatin (CDDP), cyclophosphamide (CPM), doxorubicin (DOXO), and vincristine (VCR) in a retrospective analysis of 44 clinical trials of induction chemotherapy for stage IV neuroblastoma patients newly diagnosed at older than 1 year of age. Dose intensity (DI) of each drug was calculated as milligrams per square meter per week. Linear regression analyses showed that the Dls of VM26 and CDDP had the greatest influence on clinical outcomes (ie, proportion of major response, median survival, and median progression-free survival [PFS]), while those of CPM and DOXO were less significant. VCR had no influence on the three clinical end points. Although many protocols extended treatment to more than 1 year, none of these end points correlated positively with the duration of therapy. Twenty-one weeks appeared adequate for achieving superior response, median survival, and median PFS. These results suggest that maximal dose intensification of selective drugs over a short duration may improve the outcome of patients with poor-risk neuroblastoma. 
Major amputations done with palliative intent in the treatment of local bony complications associated with advanced cancer. Palliative amputations were performed on 11 patients (7 men, 4 women) with disseminated disease to control local bony complications. The average patient age was 54 years (range 14-78 years). The primary diseases were melanoma/sarcoma (seven patients) and carcinoma (four patients). All had pain; eight had intractable pain that could not be controlled by analgesics. All 11 patients had additional severe local complications, which included recurrent pathological fracture (4), sepsis (2), hemorrhage (2), radiation necrosis (2), and iliofemoral thrombosis secondary to tumor (1). Previous attempts of palliation had been made in all 11 patients, and 8 had undergone previous operative procedures (5 had undergone two or more) prior to amputation. Three anterior hemipelvectomies, five posterior hemipelvectomies, two hip disarticulations, and one forequarter amputation were performed. All patients survived the surgery, and there were no intraoperative complications. All patients received dramatic relief of pain. Postoperative complications included two cases of flap necrosis and two infections; all resolved satisfactorily. The six patients who were nonambulatory before surgery ambulated postoperatively, and two eventually ambulated with a prosthesis. Six of 11 patients survived 1 year or longer, with a median postoperative survival period of 13 months (average 16 months). Although major amputations are viewed at times as offering little to already-compromised patients, they can improve dramatically the quality of life in selected patients. 
Confirming the theoretical structure of the McGill Pain Questionnaire in acute clinical pain. Based upon a tripartite theoretical model of pain, the Pain Rating Index (PRI) of the McGill Pain Questionnaire (MPQ) continues to be one of the most frequently used instruments to measure clinical pain. Although a number of exploratory factor analytic studies have failed to consistently support the theoretical structure of the instrument, one previous confirmatory factor analytic study of chronic pain did statistically support the a priori model. Because it has been suggested that acute pain may not involve the same dimensions as chronic pain, this study provided a direct test of the theoretical structure of the MPQ through multi-sample confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) using data provided by women experiencing pain during labor (n = 185) and women experiencing acute postoperative pain (n = 192). Results of the LISREL CFA analysis indicated that the a priori, 3-factor, oblique model originally proposed by Melzack provided the most parsimonious representation of the data across the 2 samples of acute pain. 
The physician's responsibilities: residua and sequelae. Cardiologists assuming responsibility for adults with congenital heart disease must have knowledge of electrophysiologic, valvular (native valves), prosthetic (valves, patches and conduits), ventricular (especially chamber function), vascular (especially elevated pulmonary vascular resistance) and noncardiovascular residua and sequelae. Acquired cardiac and noncardiac diseases coexist in older adults with postoperative congenital heart disease and add to the physician's responsibilities. 
The mini-grommet and tympanosclerosis. One hundred and sixteen children with otitis media with effusion underwent myringotomy and insertion of a conventional pattern of Shah grommet in one ear and the much smaller Mini Shah grommet in the other. Close observation post-operatively determined the comparative rate of extrusion, recurrence of effusion, and of onset and degree of tympanosclerosis. At one year review, the Mini Shah shows a significantly earlier extrusion and a greater tendency to recurrence of otitis media with effusion. However, this is compensated by a decreased incidence of tympanosclerosis and reduced severity in those affected. This tends to support the view that shear forces produced by heavier patterns of ventilation tube promote tympanosclerosis. 
Hemobilia due to vasculitis of the gall bladder in a patient with mixed connective tissue disease. A 30-year-old woman with mixed connective tissue disease presented with acute abdominal pain and signs of blood loss. At cholecystectomy she appeared to have lost a considerable amount of blood into the biliary tract due to bleeding of the gall bladder. Microscopic examination showed vasculitis of the gall bladder wall. Hemobilia has not been described before as a complication in mixed connective tissue disease. 
A world record marathon runner with silent ischemia without coronary atherosclerosis. A 62-year-old world record marathon runner was found to have silent ischemia manifested by a very abnormal stress test, whereas at autopsy nine months later, there was virtually no coronary atherosclerosis nor other disease of the coronary microvasculature. However, there was focal fibrosis of the papillary muscles consistent with remote ischemia secondary to possible CV. It is postulated that endurance-related high catecholamine levels might have been responsible. 
Lack of ciprofloxacin ototoxicity after repeated ototopical application. The possible side effects of ototopically applied ciprofloxacin on inner ear function were investigated. The hearing function of pigmented guinea pigs was evaluated by daily frequency-specific evoked response audiometry after repeated application of the drug to both ears. Ciprofloxacin appeared to have no statistically significant effect on the hearing thresholds of the experimental animals. 
Risk factors for tunnel infections in continuous peritoneal dialysis. Little data are available about risk factors for peritoneal catheter subcutaneous tunnel infection. Therefore, we analyzed tunnel infections occurring in our program over a 10.5-year period. One hundred twenty-nine tunnel infections occurred in 92 of 411 patients (22%) on peritoneal dialysis for a mean of 19 +/- 19 months. Tunnel infection rate was 0.19 per year. By 1 year, 15% of patients had a tunnel infection, and by 2 years, 23%. Tunnel infection rates decreased with increasing time on peritoneal dialysis: 2.4 per year for patients on peritoneal dialysis less than 1 year, 0.8 per year for patients on dialysis 1 to 2 years, and 0.4 per year for patients on dialysis greater than 2 years (all different at P less than 0.01). Organisms were cultured in 109 tunnel infections: gram-positive cocci in 77 episodes (71%) [Staphylococcus aureus 57, 52%], and gram-negative bacilli in 24 episodes (22%). Tunnel infection rates were higher in diabetics than in nondiabetics (0.27 per year v 0.16 per year, respectively; P less than 0.001 by life-table analysis of time to first infection) and also higher in women than in men (0.23 per year v 0.17 per year, P less than 0.001). Tunnel infection rates were 0.35 per year for diabetic women, 0.20 per year for diabetic men, 0.18 per year for nondiabetic women, and 0.15 per year for nondiabetic men (groups different, P less than 0.001). Race and age were similar in patients with and without tunnel infections. Catheter loss was 80% when tunnel infection was associated with peritonitis and 40% when tunnel infection alone was present (P less than 0.001). We conclude that the risk of tunnel infection is highest early in the course of peritoneal dialysis and that diabetic women, for unclear reasons, are at the highest risk. 
Assessment of normal and abnormal erectile function: color Doppler flow sonography versus conventional techniques. The penile arteries were studied with color Doppler flow sonography in 10 subjects with normal and 39 patients with abnormal erectile function. The relationships of systolic and diastolic velocities to spectral waveform changes in the penile arteries in response to tumescence were studied before and after intracorporal injection of vasoactive medications that induce erection. In normal subjects, a characteristic spectral waveform pattern corresponded to increasing intracorporal pressure. Patients with abnormal arterial inflow and/or abnormal venous sinusoidal leakage demonstrated deviation from the patterns noted in normal subjects. Patients with abnormal arterial inflow had lower mean peak systolic velocities than normal subjects. Patients with severe venous sinusoidal incompetence had an arrest of waveform progression with evolution to but not beyond phases 1 or 2 (diastolic flow remained positive). Patients with abnormal arterial inflow and abnormal venous sinusoidal outflow had waveform changes that reflected both processes. Systolic/diastolic velocity and waveform relationships can be used to define the integrity of both the cavernosal artery inflow and venous sinusoidal outflow occlusion mechanisms. 
Breast cancer metastatic to the eye is a common entity. Breast cancer metastatic to the eye is a common entity occurring in up to 30% of women with metastatic disease. The prevalence of this lesion is not appreciated because of the dominant clinical picture of metastases occurring in other organs. The diagnosis should be suspected in any women with a history of breast cancer and any visual symptoms, particularly metamorphopsia and scotomata. A thorough ophthalmologic evaluation, aided by ultrasonography, computed tomography, or magnetic resonance scanning, usually confirms the diagnosis. Early treatment with radiation therapy can alleviate symptoms and control local disease. The recognition and treatment of this disorder is important in maximizing the quality of life in patients with metastatic breast cancer, especially because newer treatment regimens prolong survival and thereby increase the chances for ocular metastasis. 
Incidental detection of a microcystic adenoma of the pancreas. Cystic neoplasms of the pancreas are uncommon. The two major types of cystic pancreatic neoplasms are microcystic (serous) cystadenoma and mucinous cystic lesions (mucinous cystadenoma and mucinous cystadenocarcinoma). The two types differ substantially in the long-term mortality. Symptoms and signs do not distinguish between the two types, and small lesions are often asymptomatic. The neoplasms may be discovered during imaging procedures for unrelated complaints. Computerized tomography may suggest the diagnosis of microcystic adenoma or mucinous cystic neoplasm when the features are typical, but the final diagnosis must be established by surgical biopsy. Characteristic gross findings, light microscopic findings, and immunohistochemical staining patterns distinguish between the two types. When preliminary open biopsy confirms microcystic adenoma, extensive unnecessary surgery can be avoided. 
Effects of beta-adrenergic stimulation with dobutamine on isovolumic relaxation in the normal and failing human left ventricle. BACKGROUND. We tested the hypothesis that beta-adrenergic receptor-stimulated acceleration of left ventricular (LV) isovolumic relaxation (i.e., positive lusitropic response) is attenuated in patients with severe congestive heart failure (CHF) compared with patients without LV dysfunction or CHF. METHODS AND RESULTS. The beta-adrenergic agonist dobutamine was infused by the intracoronary route in 14 subjects (normal group, six; CHF patients, eight) and by the intravenous route in a second group of 14 subjects (normal group, four; CHF patients, 10). The positive inotropic response to intracoronary or intravenous dobutamine was substantially and significantly reduced in the patients with CHF. LV isovolumic relaxation rate was determined by the methods of Weiss (TL), Mirsky (T1/2), and by a nonlinear regression technique (TNL). LV isovolumic relaxation assessed by all three methods was significantly prolonged in CHF patients compared with normal subjects. Intracoronary and intravenous infusions of dobutamine caused significant acceleration of LV isovolumic relaxation in both normal subjects and patients with CHF. The magnitude of the dobutamine-stimulated acceleration of isovolumic relaxation in patients with CHF was comparable with that in normal subjects. CONCLUSIONS. These data demonstrate that beta-adrenergic receptor stimulation causes significant acceleration of LV isovolumic relaxation in both normal subjects and patients with severe CHF. Coronary to our hypothesis, the lusitropic response to beta-adrenergic stimulation is well preserved in patients with severe CHF despite substantial attenuation of the beta-adrenergic positive inotropic response. These findings have potentially important implications regarding the physiology and pharmacology of adrenergically mediated LV relaxation in humans. 
Dystrophin expression and somatic reversion in prednisone-treated and untreated Duchenne dystrophy. CIDD Study Group. The mechanism by which prednisone improves muscle strength and function in Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) is unknown. We addressed the possibility that clinical improvement was related to prednisone-induced alterations in skeletal muscle dystrophin. We performed muscle biopsies on patients at the conclusion of a randomized, double-blind, 6-month trial of prednisone and analyzed dystrophin content using Western blots and antibody staining of tissue sections. These studies demonstrated no significant differences in dystrophin content between treatment (prednisone 1.5 mg/kg/d, n = 12; prednisone 0.75 mg/kg/d, n = 9) and placebo (n = 12) groups. Of interest, however, was the presence of varying numbers of dystrophin-positive fibers (revertants) occurring individually or in clusters in antibody-stained tissue sections of more than one-half of the Duchenne patients. Mutation analysis revealed that revertants occurred in DMD patients with identifiable deletions half of the Duchenne patients. Mutation analysis revealed that revertants occurred in DMD patients with identifiable deletions or duplications, and in nondeletion patients. Prednisone treatment did not influence the prevalence of revertants. Revertants are most likely due to a second-site mutation occurring in a somatic cell allowing for restoration of the translational reading frame of the dystrophin transcript. 
Dimethylformamide-induced liver damage among synthetic leather workers. Prevalence of liver injury associated with dimethylformamide (DMF) exposure was determined. Medical examinations, liver function tests, and creatine phosphokinase (CPK) determinations were performed on 183 of 204 (76%) employees of a synthetic leather factory. Air concentrations of solvents were measured with personal samplers and gas chromatography. The concentration of DMF in air to which each worker was exposed was categorized. High exposure concentrations of DMF (i.e., 25-60 ppm) were significantly associated with elevated alanine aminotransferase (ALT) levels (ALT greater than or equal to 35 IU/l), a result that did not change even after stratification by hepatitis B carrier status. Modeling by logistic regression demonstrated that exposure to high concentrations of DMF was associated with an elevated ALT (p = .01), whereas hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) was slightly but independently associated with an elevated ALT (p = .07). In those workers who had normal ALT values, there occurred still significantly higher mean ALT and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) activities, especially among those who were not HBsAg carriers. A significant association existed between elevated CPK levels and exposure to DMF. However, an analysis of the CPK isoenzyme among 143 workers did not reveal any specific damage to muscles. This outbreak of liver injury among synthetic leather workers is ascribed to DMF. It is recommended that the occupational standard for DMF and its toxicity among HBsAg carriers be evaluated further. 
Parathyroid hypertensive factor, a circulating factor in animal and human hypertension. A new circulating hypertensive factor (parathyroid hypertensive factor; PHF) was shown to exist in the plasma of spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) but not in that of normotensive rats. PHF produced a delayed increase in blood pressure with a peak response at 45 min (bolus injection) or 60 to 90 min (continuous infusion). This increase in blood pressure was coupled with an in vitro increase in calcium uptake in rat tail artery with a similar time course. The involvement of calcium in the mechanism of action was supported by the inhibitory effect of calcium antagonists on the vascular action of PHF. Furthermore, PHF increased the intracellular free calcium concentration in cultured smooth muscle cells from rat tail artery. Parathyroidectomy and parathyroid transplant experiments indicated the parathyroid origin of PHF. A culture of parathyroid glands from SHR, but not from normotensive rats, produced in the medium a factor which has the same biological property and HPLC retention time as plasma PHF. A novel cell type was described in the parathyroid gland of SHR, but not normotensive rats, and the percent of these cells correlated significantly with plasma PHF level and blood pressure. In some hyperparathyroid patients, plasma PHF and hypertension were found, both of which disappeared after surgical removal of the parathyroid gland. In both animal models and human studies, PHF seems to be associated with low or normal plasma renin and salt-sensitive type of hypertension. 
How well can radiographers triage x ray films in accident and emergency departments? [published erratum appears in BMJ 1991 Mar 23;302(6778):696] OBJECTIVE--To assess the ability of radiographers to identify abnormal radiographs of patients attending accident and emergency departments. DESIGN--Prospective study over six weeks. SETTING--Teaching hospital casualty x ray department. PATIENTS--3394 consecutive patients referred for radiography. INTERVENTIONS--Radiographs were assessed by radiographers who were offered a four point triage scheme: normal, abnormal, insignificantly abnormal, or further advice required. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES--Comparison of radiographers' assessments with an assessment made independently by the reporting radiologists. RESULTS--Overall disagreement between the radiographers and radiologists was 9.4%. There were 7% false positives and 14% false negatives. Most errors occurred in assessing radiographs of the skull, facial bones, chest, abdomen, and soft tissues. CONCLUSION--Unselected radiographers can offer useful advice on radiographs to casualty officers, but their high rate of false positive diagnoses indicates that they cannot triage casualty radiographs sufficiently accurately to allow them to extend their current reporting role. 
Early treatment of ischemic stroke with a calcium antagonist. We performed a feasibility and safety study (phase II) of nicardipine, a calcium antagonist, in 57 patients. The objectives of the study were to begin therapy as early as possible (less than or equal to 12 hours) after the onset of ischemic stroke and to administer as high a dose as possible. All patients received an intravenous infusion of nicardipine for 72 hours, starting with a dose of 3 mg/hr and increasing to a maximum dose of 7 mg/hr. Upward titration of the dose was limited by a 10% decrease in blood pressure or a 20 beats/min increase in pulse. Intravenous therapy was followed by 30 days of oral therapy. The mean +/- SD interval from onset of stroke to commencement of therapy was 9.1 +/- 5.4 hours. Adverse reactions consisted primarily of hypotension requiring discontinuation of therapy in four patients. Score on a graded neurologic examination increased from 41/100 at baseline to 64/100 at 3 months for the 41 patients completing follow-up. There was no correlation between the dose of nicardipine administered and outcome, but the 11 patients starting therapy less than or equal to 6 hours after onset did better than those starting therapy 6-12 hours after onset. Further study of very early therapy with nicardipine is justified. 
Should intravenous immunoglobulin G be first-line treatment for acute thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura? Case report and review of the literature. Acute thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP) is a rare and serious disease. Treatment with prednisone, anticoagulation, antiplatelet drugs, splenectomy, exchange transfusions, vincristine, and plasmapheresis may be effective in some patients, but the response to these therapies is inconsistent and all carry the potential for serious side effects. We, and others, have recently seen dramatic responses to intravenous (IV) immunoglobulin G (IgG) when other treatments have failed. Although IV IgG is expensive, its costs are low compared with those extended plasmapheresis regimens. Since the response to treatment can usually be evaluated within a few days and the side effects appear less than with other treatments, we believe a strong case can be made for the use of IV IgG as first-line therapy for acute TTP. Continued multicenter studies are necessary to finally solve the problem of competing and confusing treatment attempts and synergism of treatment in acute TTP. 
The prognostic value of deoxyribonucleic acid flow cytometric analysis in stage D2 prostatic carcinoma. This study was designed to compare the prognostic potential of tumor grade and ploidy status in patients with stage D2 prostate cancer. Two outcome groups were selected on the basis of survival after orchiectomy: a bad outcome group consisting of 66 patients who died of the disease within 12 months and a good outcome group comprising 37 patients who survived beyond 5 years. Tumors were classified histologically as well (17%), moderately (17%) or poorly (66%) differentiated. Tumor grade was a significant predictor of outcome, with 76% of poorly differentiated tumors in the bad outcome group and 65% of well differentiated tumors in the good outcome group (p less than 0.005). Deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) ploidy analysis was performed on formalin fixed, paraffin embedded samples of the primary tumor to yield 97 final tracings that were classified using set criteria for DNA ploidy status. Over-all, 54% of the tumors were nondiploid (33% aneuploid and 21% tetraploid) and the remaining 46% were diploid. DNA ploidy status was a significant indicator of outcome (p less than 0.001), with 64% of diploid tumors in the good outcome group and 88% of the nondiploid tumors in the poor outcome group. Tetraploid tumors behaved no differently from other nondiploid tumors. We conclude that DNA ploidy status and tumor grading are significant independent predictors of outcome after orchiectomy and when combined yield important additional prognostic information. 
Effects of milrinone on left ventricular remodeling after acute myocardial infarction. BACKGROUND. Left ventricular remodeling after an acute myocardial infarction may result in progressive left ventricular dilation that may be associated with increased mortality. We studied the effects of the phosphodiesterase inhibitor milrinone on left ventricular remodeling after acute myocardial infarction. METHODS AND RESULTS. Rats (n = 90) were randomized to undergo either left coronary artery ligation or sham operation. Three weeks after surgery, rats received either no treatment or milrinone, which was continued until 2 days before the rats were killed. Ninety days after the initial surgery, hemodynamic measurements were made before and after volume loading. The rats were killed, the hearts were removed, and passive pressure-volume curves were obtained. The hearts were fixed at a constant pressure and analyzed morphometrically. Compared with untreated infarcted rats, milrinone-treated infarcted rats had a lower left ventricular end-diastolic pressure (1.7 +/- 0.4 versus 4.3 +/- 1.4 mm Hg, p less than 0.05), a lower left ventricular volume (1.25 +/- 0.20 versus 2.37 +/- 0.30 ml/kg, p less than 0.001) and a lower left ventricular wall stress index (1.3 +/- 0.2 versus 1.7 +/- 0.1, p less than 0.05). Left ventricular chamber stiffness was higher in milrinone-treated infarcted rats than in untreated infarcted rats. Milrinone had no cardiac effect on uninfarcted animals. CONCLUSION. Chronic milrinone therapy after acute myocardial infarction improves cardiac hemodynamic indexes and attenuates progressive left ventricular dilation. 
Nongynecologic somatic pathology in women with chronic pelvic pain and negative laparoscopy. One hundred eighty-three women with chronic pelvic pain were referred to a multidisciplinary chronic pelvic pain clinic after negative laparoscopy. One hundred twenty-two of them completed a thorough medical and psychologic evaluation and were followed for a minimum of six months after completion of therapy. Occult somatic pathology was diagnosed in 57 women (47%), including 19 in whom coexistent psychopathology was diagnosed. Myofascial pain was the most common somatic diagnosis, followed by atypical cyclic pain (dysmenorrhea or mittelschmerz); gastroenterologic, urologic and infectious diseases; and pelvic vascular congestion. No plausible somatic etiology was apparent in the remaining 65 (53%) of the 122 referrals. Nongynecologic somatic pathology accounted for 34 (29%) and gynecologic pathology for 23 (19%) of the referrals, only 6 (5%) of whom ultimately required hysterectomy. Women with a somatic diagnosis were found to be significantly older than the remainder of the referral population. Long-term symptomatic improvement or resolution of pain was obtained in 43 (75%) of the 57 patients with somatic diagnoses. Coexistent psychopathology was found to correlate with a poorer long-term prognosis. Our findings underscore the importance of a multidisciplinary approach to evaluating and treating chronic pelvic pain in women and confirm that hysterectomy is indicated in this setting only rarely. 
Treatment of bone, joint, and vascular-access-associated gram-positive bacterial infections with teicoplanin. Teicoplanin, a glycopeptide antibiotic, was evaluated for safety and efficacy in the treatment of vascular-access-associated bacteremias and of bone and joint infections due to susceptible gram-positive organisms. Of 35 patients enrolled, 26 had osteomyelitis, 8 had vascular-access-associated bacteremias, and 1 had a joint infection. A total of 38 gram-positive isolates were identified: 23 Staphylococcus aureus and 6 coagulase-negative staphylococcus and 9 streptococcus isolates. After at least 6 months of follow-up, 17 patients were evaluable for efficacy: 10 of 14 (71%) with osteomyelitis and 3 of 3 with vascular-access-associated bacteremias had full resolution of their infections. Inadequate debridement, the presence of metal, and inadequate dosing were likely causes of two failures and two relapses in patients with osteomyelitis. For all but two organisms, teicoplanin MICs were less than or equal to 2 micrograms/ml. Patients who responded had median peak and trough serum bactericidal levels at serum dilutions of 1:64 and 1:16; trough levels of teicoplanin in serum were greater than 30 micrograms/ml. Patients did not respond as expected to daily doses of 4 mg/kg of body weight, which consequently were increased to greater than or equal to 15 mg/kg. Audiology testing of 20 patients found 2 with a mild loss of high-frequency hearing; 1 patient complained of tinnitus. Patients tolerated peak levels in serum as high as 127 micrograms/ml and trough levels of 49 micrograms/ml. However, 5 of 18 patients (28%) whose daily dose was greater than or equal to 12 mg/kg developed drug fever and rash and had teicoplanin discontinued. Further study of the antibiotic at such higher doses is needed. 
Effect of the calcium antagonist nicardipine hydrochloride on glucose tolerance and insulin secretion. The calcium antagonist nicardipine was administered to 42 patients at a dose of 60 or 120 mg/day for an average of 7.8 weeks to determine its effects on glucose tolerance and insulin secretion. Glucose tolerance and immunoreactive insulin levels were essentially unchanged by nicardipine regardless of the preexisting level of glucose tolerance. Mean systolic and diastolic blood pressures decreased in all patients. Concentrations of triglycerides decreased and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels increased significantly (p less than 0.05) in association with nicardipine administration. Therefore it is concluded that, regardless of the preexisting level of glucose tolerance, nicardipine exerted hypotensive effects without significant adverse effects on glucose tolerance or insulin secretion. 
Monitoring of somatosensory evoked potentials during surgery for middle cerebral artery aneurysms. Somatosensory evoked potentials (SEPs) were monitored during 53 procedures for aneurysms of the middle cerebral artery (MCA). "Significant" changes were reported to the surgeon, who took corrective action when possible. Changes in the SEPs were categorized as follows: Type I, no change; Type II, significant change with complete return to baseline; Type III, significant change with incomplete return to baseline; Type IV, complete loss with no return; and Type V, no response at baseline. Only 1 of 37 patients with a Type I SEP had a new neurological deficit, and this was a patient who could not be examined for several days after surgery because he was in a pentobarbital coma. All 4 patients with Type III and IV changes had new postoperative neurological deficits. Perhaps of greater importance, 4 of 5 patients with Type II changes had no new deficit. These patients all had changes in SEPs that were completely reversible by clip adjustment (2), prompt removal of temporary clips (1), and inducing hypertension after aneurysm trapping (1). These cases may, therefore, represent instances in which SEP monitoring allowed the clinicians to prevent a neurological deficit. The MCA supplies the area of the somatosensory cortex that controls the hand. Median nerve SEPs are, therefore, a theoretically ideal monitor during surgery for MCA aneurysms. This study suggests that the results of MCA aneurysm surgery may be accurately predicted and improved with SEP monitoring. 
Clinical diagnosis for metastatic adenocarcinoma of spine of unknown origin. A comparative study. The diagnostic values of the presence of Virchow's node (VN) or rectal shelf (RS) in spinal metastasis from adenocarcinoma of unknown origin were studied prospectively in 60 patients during 1986-1988. These were compared with 14 cases with other malignancies of the spine and 37 controls with nonneoplastic spinal lesions. The diagnosis was confirmed by histologic study in all malignant cases. The results were analyzed by diagnostic test analysis and McNemar chi 2 testing. This yields 18.3-21.6%, 97.2-100%, and 92.8-100% sensitivity, specificity, and predictive value, respectively, for a positive test for VN and RS to differentiate significantly adenocarcinoma from other malignancies and control patients (P less than 0.005). These findings may thus be considered as a simple and economic guide for physicians to determine the proper approach to patients with a spinal lesion suspected to be malignant. 
Indirect laryngoscopic approach for injection of botulinum toxin in spasmodic dysphonia. Spasmodic dysphonia is a focal dystonia that causes a loss of the fine control of intrinsic laryngeal muscles and produces a strained staccato voice. Temporary relief from symptoms has been reported in patients treated with botulinum toxin percutaneously injected into the thyroarytenoid muscle. A newly developed method of treatment differs from reported methods by increasing the accuracy of botulinum toxin placement, reducing soft tissue trauma, and applying basic scientific information about the functional histology of intrinsic laryngeal musculature. Sixteen patients with primarily adductor spasmodic dysphonia were treated. Initial assessment included laryngeal examination by indirect laryngoscopy, videoendoscopy, and stroboscopy, neurology examination (including laryngeal EMG), and vocal function studies with acoustic analysis and aerodynamic studies. A device originally designed for collagen injection allowed the precise microdelivery of toxin to the thyroarytenoid muscle. Indirect laryngoscopy was used to direct the needle, in an attempt to cover a broad area of motor end plates. The minimally effective dose was titrated for each patient, to avoid paralysis and preserve laryngeal function. All patients showed improved voices after treatment. There were no major complications. The basic technique can be performed in the otolaryngologist's office and does not require electromyography equipment or expertise. 
A new approach to the differential diagnosis of a regular tachycardia with a wide QRS complex. BACKGROUND. In the differential diagnosis of a tachycardia with a wide QRS complex (greater than or equal to 0.12 second) diagnostic mistakes are frequent. Therefore, we investigated the reasons for failure of presently available criteria, and we identified new, simpler criteria and incorporated them in a stepwise approach that provides better sensitivity and specificity for making a correct diagnosis. METHODS AND RESULTS. A prospective analysis revealed that current criteria had a poor specificity for the differential diagnosis. The value of four new criteria incorporated in a stepwise approach was prospectively analyzed in a total of 554 tachycardias with a widened QRS complex (384 ventricular and 170 supraventricular). The sensitivity of the four consecutive steps was 0.987, and the specificity was 0.965. CONCLUSIONS. Current criteria for the differential diagnosis between supraventricular tachycardia with aberrant conduction and ventricular tachycardia are frequently absent or suggest the wrong diagnosis. The absence of an RS complex in all precordial leads is easily recognizable and highly specific for the diagnosis of ventricular tachycardia. When an RS complex is present in one or more precordial leads, an RS interval of more than 100 msec is highly specific for ventricular tachycardia. This new stepwise approach may prevent diagnostic mistakes. 
The infectious and hematologic otolaryngic complications of myelosuppressive cancer chemotherapy. The otolaryngologist-head and neck surgeon is frequently consulted to evaluate patients before the administration of myelosuppressive cancer chemotherapy. Fifty consecutive patients treated at the University of Pennsylvania Oncology Center were studied before and during chemotherapy for adult leukemia or bone marrow transplantation. Otolaryngic history, physical examination, radiographic studies, and hematologic surveys were analyzed for the duration of therapy in an attempt to identify risk factors for infectious and hematologic otolaryngic complications. Two-thirds of the patient studied experienced untoward effects that required the further attention of an otolaryngologist-head and neck surgeon. The various complications and associated correlations with the study parameters before and during chemotherapy are discussed. 
Results of long-term rice bran treatment on stone recurrence in hypercalciuric patients. A series of 182 calcium stone formers with idiopathic hypercalciuria underwent treatment with rice bran for 1 to 94 months. Urinary calcium excretion was considerably reduced, but there was some increase in urinary phosphate and oxalate. Urinary excretion of magnesium and uric acid, serum calcium, magnesium, phosphate, uric acid, parathyroid hormone (PTH) and ALP was unaffected. There were no obvious changes in serum iron, zinc and copper even when patients were treated for long periods. Rice bran was well tolerated in almost all cases and there were no serious side effects; 49 patients have undergone treatment for more than 3 years (average duration of administration 5.09 years). The frequency of new stone formation was drastically reduced (individual stone formation rate (no./year) from 0.720 +/- 0.533 to 0.125 +/- 0.204; group stone formation rate (no./patient-year) from 0.721 to 0.120) compared with the 3-year period before treatment. During treatment, 61.2% of patients remained in remission. Although rice bran therapy should be effective in correcting absorptive hypercalciuria, there may be limits to the overall ability of rice bran monotherapy to prevent recurrence. 
Phase II trial of weekly or biweekly intraperitoneal mitoxantrone in epithelial ovarian cancer. Previous experimental and clinical evaluation has suggested that ovarian cancer is sensitive to the cytotoxic effects of mitoxantrone at concentrations achievable within the peritoneal cavity after intraperitoneal (IP) administration. Unfortunately, the use of the drug delivered IP at high doses (20 mg/m2 in 2 L normal saline [NS]) on a monthly schedule is compromised by severe local effects secondary to the irritant properties of the drug. To reduce toxicity and take advantage of minimal systemic drug exposure following IP administration, we treated 28 patients with a lower drug concentration of mitoxantrone (10 mg/m2 in 2 L NS), but on a weekly or every other week schedule (total, 12 courses). Compared with the monthly program, this regimen caused less pain, allowed for a higher cumulative dose of mitoxantrone to be delivered, and resulted in less serious treatment-related morbidity. Four of 13 assessable patients (31%) whose largest tumor was less than or equal to 1 cm in diameter demonstrated a surgically defined response. All responding patients had failed previously or exhibited a minimal response to cisplatin. Despite the improved toxicity profile of this regimen, the overall response rate was similar to the monthly program, probably secondary to inadequate IP drug distribution in many patients. Future investigative efforts using IP mitoxantrone as therapy for ovarian cancer might focus on developing methods to improve drug delivery to all sites of tumor within the peritoneal cavity (eg, intraoperative therapy, increased treatment volumes, and antiinflammatory agents to reduce adhesion formation). 
The influence of the renin gene on alcohol consumption in Dahl rats. A rat renin allele (the S-allele) has been identified in Dahl rats which cosegregates with increases in blood pressure. Rats with a double dose of the allele--the salt-sensitive hypertensive rats--have low renin activity compared with the salt-resistant hypertensive rat that does not have this S-allele. Alcohol consumption in rats has also been shown to vary with renin activity, and the possible involvement of renin activity in the genetics of alcohol consumption was suggested by previous work showing that the alcohol-preferring P line of selected rats had low renin levels. In the present study we examined alcohol consumption in a group of inbred Dahl rats, which have a double dose of the S renin allele, and in a group of selected Dahl rats, which have only a single dose of this S-allele. After an initial acclimation period, these two groups were first given daily 1-hr access to ascending concentrations of alcohol (3%, 6%, 8% w/v) over a 34-day period followed by continuous access to alcohol for a further 10 days. Water and food were always available. Regardless of whether alcohol was rationed or continuously available, the rats with the double dose of the S-allele drank significantly more alcohol than the rats that had only a single dose of this allele. These findings suggest that genetically mediated alterations in the renin gene may exert a significant influence on alcohol consumption and may be a component in the etiology of alcoholism. 
Electrothrombosis of saccular aneurysms via endovascular approach. Part 2: Preliminary clinical experience. Fifteen patients with high-risk intracranial saccular aneurysms were treated using electrolytically detachable coils introduced via an endovascular approach. The patients ranged in age from 21 to 69 years. The most frequent clinical presentation was subarachnoid hemorrhage (eight cases). Considerable thrombosis of the aneurysm (70% to 100%) was achieved in all 15 patients, and preservation of the parent artery was obtained in 14. Although temporary neurological deterioration due to the technique was recorded in one patient, no permanent neurological deficit was observed in this series and there were no deaths. It is believed that this new technology is a viable alternative in the management of patients with high-risk intracranial saccular aneurysms. It may also play an important role in the occlusion of aneurysms in the acute phase of subarachnoid hemorrhage. 
The impact of National Health Service Corps physicians in the lowering perinatal mortality rate in Dade County, Florida. In some parts of Dade County, Florida, perinatal mortality rates have revealed serious problems in the delivery of health care to poor pregnant women. From 1982-1985, the reported perinatal mortality rates varied from 32-36 per 1000 live births, more than double the national average. Under the leadership of the Primary Health Care Consortium of Dade County (a federation of community health centers and other primary care providers), National Health Service Corps obstetricians and pediatricians served inner-city, medically needy patients as part of a coordinated perinatal plan from 1987-1989. Data on fetal and neonatal deaths, collected from census tracts adjacent to the community health centers, were used to study the impact of Corps obstetrician and pediatrician placement. The respective perinatal mortality rates were compared with those of 1986 as historic controls. Within a year, the overall perinatal mortality rate was reduced by 45%. As a result, an estimated 320 lives were saved between 1987-1989. This public health achievement represents a measurable impact due to assignment of National Health Service Corps physicians and can be used as a working model to reduce perinatal mortality in medically underserved communities in the United States. 
Elevation of ambulatory systolic blood pressure in hypertensive smokers. A case-control study. Although smoking raises blood pressure, the office blood pressure measurements of smokers are the same as, or lower than, those of nonsmokers. To resolve this paradox, we compared the office and 24-hour ambulatory blood pressures of 59 untreated hypertensive smokers with 118 nonsmoking hypertensives matched for age, sex, and race. The office blood pressures of the smoking and nonsmoking groups were 141/93 and 142/93 mm Hg, respectively. The awake ambulatory systolic blood pressure was significantly higher in the smokers (145 vs 140 mm Hg). This difference was greater among patients over the age of 50 years (153 vs 142 mmHg), and absent among patients under 50 years (140 vs 139 mm Hg). Blood pressures during sleep did not differ between the two groups (121/76 vs 123/77 mm Hg). We conclude that, among white hypertensives above the age of 50 years, smokers maintain a higher daytime ambulatory systolic blood pressure than nonsmokers even though blood pressure measured in the office is similar. 
Bilateral central retinal vein occlusion as an initial manifestation of pseudotumor cerebri. Pseudotumor cerebri, or benign intracranial hypertension, is known to produce visual symptoms. Central retinal vein occlusion has been linked with pseudotumor cerebri but rarely as an initial manifestation. We describe a 46-year-old patient--who was obese and mildly hypertensive with bilateral central retinal vein occlusions--who was subsequently diagnosed as having pseudotumor cerebri. In patients with simultaneous bilateral central retinal vein occlusions, unusual underlying systemic conditions such as pseudotumor cerebri should be considered in the diagnostic evaluation. 
Laser laparoscopic management of large endometriomas. Forty-seven patients underwent laser laparoscopic management of endometriomas from 3 to 12 cm in diameter. Eighteen patients had infertility, 15 had pelvic pain, and 14 had both. The types of laser used were the carbon dioxide, argon, and potassium-titanyl-phosphate. There were no surgical complications. Twelve of 32 patients with infertility achieved pregnancy after the initial procedure. Subsequently, 2 patients conceived after a second-look procedure. Twenty-three of 30 patients with pelvic pain reported improvement or resolution. We confirm the efficacy of operative laparoscopy using lasers in the management of large ovarian endometriomas. 
Serum cholesterol: attitudes and behavior of family practice residents BACKGROUND. Given the current health promotion efforts regarding coronary artery disease, more information is needed about residents' attitudes and behaviors that relate to identification and management of patients with elevated serum cholesterol levels. METHODS. Family practice residents from eight US programs (N = 128) were surveyed in 1989 to assess their attitudes and reported practice patterns. Resident survey data were compared, when feasible, to published data from 1986 and 1990 surveys of practicing physicians performed by the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute. RESULTS. The use of faculty "key contacts" resulted in a 90% response rate (N = 115). Both residents and practicing physicians attributed a high degree of importance to cholesterol as a risk factor. Residents reported more frequent routine screening of middle-aged men than the routine screening rate of practicing physicians in 1986 (P less than .01). Residents reported less frequent screening of younger and older adults than of middle-aged men (P less than .001). Residents' threshold for the use of cholesterol-lowering medication was lower than that of practicing physicians surveyed in 1986, but higher than that of physicians surveyed in 1990. Compared with practicing physicians, residents did not believe they were as well prepared to counsel patients about dietary change or as successful when they tried to help patients make changes; residents reported a significantly higher rate of referral to dietitians (P less than .01). CONCLUSIONS. Residents may need more education regarding screening guidelines for children and young adults. A health promotion skills gap may exist that explains reported discrepancies between self-report and actual behavior and indicates that residency educators may need to pay more attention to fostering dietary assessment and counseling skills in their residents. 
Normal serum levels of calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) in mild to moderate essential hypertension. Calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP), a highly potent vasodilator, is expressed from the calcitonin-gene and has been localized to nerve fibers of the cardiovascular system, suggesting involvement in the physiologic regulation of vascular tone. In this investigation serum concentrations of CGRP were measured in patients with untreated mild to moderate essential hypertension (WHO I-II) and compared with concentrations in sex- and age-matched normal controls to assess a possible relationship between changes in concentrations of CGRP and this condition. The study showed no significant difference in concentrations of CGRP between patients and the normotensive controls. However, a weak but significant positive correlation was found between systolic (SBP), diastolic (DBP), mean blood pressures (MBP), and circulating concentrations of CGRP when calculated for all individuals included in the study. No correlation was found between heart rates (HR) and concentrations of CGRP. In the normotensive control group, but not in patients with hypertension, a significant positive correlation was present between body weights and concentrations of CGRP. These findings do not support the hypothesis that low expression of CGRP plays a causal role in essential hypertension, but the results do not exclude a potential receptor defect for CGRP to be involved in the disease. 
Constitutive expression and role in growth regulation of interleukin-1 and multiple cytokine receptors in a biphenotypic leukemic cell line. A cell line (B1) was established from the bone marrow of a patient with a relapse of acute leukemia characterized by a 4;11 chromosomal translocation and biphenotypic features of early B and myeloid lineages. Analysis of the growth requirements of this cell line showed density-dependent growth and secretion of an autostimulatory growth factor, suggesting an autocrine mechanism. Several lines of evidence implicate the participation of interleukin-1 (IL-1) in the autocrine growth regulation of B1 cells. These cells constitutively express the messenger RNA (mRNA) for IL-1 and IL-1 receptor and secrete IL-1; recombinant IL-1 stimulated the growth of colonies when cells were seeded at low density, and anti-IL-1 antibodies inhibited the growth of colonies with cells seeded at higher density. B1 cells do not express detectable levels of mRNA for any of the other cytokines tested, and other cytokines failed to support the growth of B1 cells at low density. In addition, B1 cells express multiple cytokine receptor genes, including the receptors for IL-6, IL-7, tumor necrosis factor and gamma-interferon. Addition of the respective cytokines to the B1 cells resulted in inhibition of the growth of leukemic cells in vitro. The multiplicity of growth-inhibitory cytokine receptors on this leukemic cell line might be due to its biphenotypic lineage and may suggest new therapeutic possibilities in controlling leukemic cell proliferation. 
Cephalometric measurements in snorers, non-snorers, and patients with sleep apnoea. Cephalometry is often used to assess patients with sleep apnoea but whether these measurements differ from those in non-apnoeic snorers and how they are influenced by age is not clear. Cephalometric radiographs of patients with sleep apnoea were compared with those of snorers without sleep apnoea and those of non-snorers. Fifty two snorers with suspected sleep apnoea had a conventional sleep study and were divided into two groups: those with an apnoea-hypopnoea index greater than 10/h (n = 40, sleep apnoea group) and those whose apnoea-hypopnoea index was 10/h or less (n = 12, snorer group). The cephalometric measurements in these patients were compared with those of 34 non-snoring control subjects. Controls were subdivided into two groups: control group 1 included 17 subjects similar in age to the sleep apnoea and snorer groups (mean (SD) age 50.0 (10.9), 50.7 (9.4), and 50.6 (9.7) years); control group 2 included 15 young men (25.4 (2.6) years). The distance from the mandibular plane to the hyoid bone (MP-H) and the length of the soft palate were greater in the patients with sleep apnoea (28.7 (7.8) and 43.6 (5.0) mm) than in the snorers (23.7 (4.2) and 40.3 (4.9 mm). The MP-H was similar in snorers and age matched control subjects, but was significantly greater in the older than in the younger control subjects (22.1 (6.1) vs 17.0 (6.8]. The soft palate was longer in subjects who snored (both sleep apnoea patients and snorers) than in control subjects. The MP-H distance significantly correlated with age for all subjects (snorers and controls) and for the control subjects alone. This study shows that non-apnoeic snorers have cephalometric abnormalities that differ from those of patients with sleep apnoea and that cephalometric values are influenced by the subject's age. 
Unexpected immunoreactivities of intermediate filament antibodies in human brain and brain tumors. Immunoreactivities of 35 different monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) that detect intermediate filaments were studied systematically on serial cryostat sections of 14 well-defined human gliomas (five astrocytomas, three oligodendrogliomas, six glioblastomas) and on normal brain. Glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), vimentin, desmin, neurofilaments, and broad-specificity keratin MAbs, as well as MAbs that recognize several or only single keratin polypeptides, were used. Unexpected reactivities were surprisingly frequent. As these may lead to diagnostic confusion and misinterpretation on this material, the authors investigated these phenomena more thoroughly. Four major sources of artifactual staining were found: 1) positive staining attributable to the rabbit gamma G immunoglobulins used in the alkaline phosphatase anti-alkaline phosphatase technique; 2) certain desmin and keratin MAbs cross-reacted with astrocytic glia and with other brain-specific epitopes; 3) technical difficulties; 4) some MAbs directed against neurofilaments and keratins showed unexpected reactivities only on individual anaplastic gliomas. The implications of these findings for intermediate filament typing of neuropathologic material are discussed. 
A novel behavioral model of neuropathic pain disorders produced in rats by partial sciatic nerve injury. Partial nerve injury is the main cause of causalgiform pain disorders in humans. We present here a novel animal model of this condition. In rats we unilaterally ligated about half of the sciatic nerve high in the thigh. Within a few hours after the operation, and for several months thereafter, the rats developed guarding behavior of the ipsilateral hind paw and licked it often, suggesting the possibility of spontaneous pain. The plantar surface of the foot was evenly hyperesthetic to non-noxious and noxious stimuli. None of the rats autotomized. There was a sharp decrease in the withdrawal thresholds bilaterally in response to repetitive Von Frey hair stimulation at the plantar side. After a series of such stimuli in the operated side, light touch elicited aversive responses, suggesting allodynia to touch. The withdrawal thresholds to CO2 laser heat pulses were markedly lowered bilaterally. Suprathreshold noxious heat pulses elicited exaggerated responses unilaterally, suggesting thermal hyperalgesia. Pin-prick evoked such exaggerated responses bilaterally (mechanical hyperalgesia). In a companion report, we show that these abnormalities critically depend on the sympathetic outflow. Based on the immediate onset and long-lasting perpetuation of similar symptoms, such as touch-evoked allodynia and hyperalgesia, and the resemblance of the contralateral phenomena to 'mirror image' pains in some humans with causalgia, we suggest that this preparation may serve as a model for syndromes of the causalgiform variety that are triggered by partial nerve injury and maintained by sympathetic activity. 
Susceptibility of normal human joint tissue to viruses. A model system has been developed to investigate the comparative ability of different viruses to replicate and persist intraarticularly. The viruses chosen for study were rubella, mumps, Coxsackie B4, adenovirus and varicella zoster, a selection of viruses with different degrees of association with joint symptoms in clinical studies. Our results showed that these viruses demonstrated a range of abilities to infect and persist in human joint tissue cultured in vitro. The most arthritogenic viruses, rubella, and to a lesser extent mumps, replicated and penetrated deeply into the synovial membrane. In contrast, the other 3 viruses were much less arthrotropic, and may only induce arthritis by immunopathological mechanisms. 
Intermittent claudication as a manifestation of silent myocardial ischemia: a pilot study. One hundred consecutive patients with intermittent claudication were screened noninvasively with electrocardiography chest wall mapping stress test and transcutaneous aortovelography during bicycle ergometry. Electrocardiographic chest wall stress testing indicated three-vessel coronary disease in 25 patients and left anterior descending plus circumflex (left main stem equivalent) disease in seven. In these 32 patients transcutaneous aortovelography demonstrated a decrease in stroke distance (an index of cardiac stroke volume) (median, -28%; 90% range, +5% to -48%), and coronary angiography confirmed the presence and severity of the disease. The claudication distance ranged between 50 and 250 meters. After myocardial revascularization or medical therapy a significant increase occurred in the stroke distance after exercise (median, +20; 90% range, +40% to -25%); also a significant increase in the postexercise pressure index and a reduction in the recovery time (p less than 0.01). No change occurred in the ankle/pressure index at rest. Twelve patients were able to walk without being limited by claudication; 15 reported improvement with a two to tenfold increase in claudication distance. No change occurred in three. The results indicate that silent myocardial ischemia is a common finding in patients with intermittent claudication. It produces left ventricular dysfunction and a decrease in stroke volume leading to a large fall in ankle pressure and early onset of claudication during exercise. Niltrates and myocardial revascularization tend to reverse this. 
Intractable ulcerating enterocolitis of infancy. Five children (three boys, two girls) presenting in the first year of life with intractable diarrhoea had a number of features in common. All had ulcerating stomatitis, four had partial villous atrophy on small intestinal biopsy, all had colitis characterised by large ulcers with overhanging edges, and four had severe perianal disease; no stool pathogens were detected. Treatment with steroids, sulphasalazine, and azathioprine was unsuccessful. All five required subtotal colectomy. Four were children of consanguinous marriages, two were siblings of Pakistani origin, two were cousins of Arab origin, and the fifth was Portuguese. Although the diagnoses of Behcet's disease and Crohn's disease were considered, it appears that these children represent a distinct inherited condition affecting the whole gastrointestinal tract, particularly the colon. 
Improving survival in gastric cancer: review of operative mortality in English language publications from 1970. In this review of English language publications from 1970, operative mortality following surgery for gastric cancer has been analysed. Operative mortality has declined in series reporting operations in successive decades to 1970, 1980 and 1990. Series reporting patients having surgery for gastric cancer in the decade to 1990 show a mean operative mortality rate of 7.8 per cent (median 4.6 per cent). This improvement may have contributed to the declining mortality rates for gastric cancer in the face of unchanging surgical workload. Results of operations for gastric cancer should be reported in a standard manner. 
Aetiological parallel between anal cancer and cervical cancer. It has been postulated that an infectious agent and/or specific sexual behaviour is involved in the aetiology of anal cancer, in analogy with the aetiology established for cancer of the cervix. A case-control study of 29,648 women with cancers registered in the Danish Cancer Registry during 1968-87 tested the hypothesis that anal cancer patients were more likely than patients with colon, stomach, or vulva cancer to have had a previous diagnosis of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) or invasive cervical cancer. The odds ratio of CIN, adjusted for age and year of diagnosis, for anal vs colon cancer was 5.2 (95% confidence interval [CI] 3.3-8.3), that for anal vs stomach cancer 3.6 (2.1-6.0), and that for anal vs vulva cancer 1.6 (0.9-2.9). The median time from diagnosis of CIN to diagnosis of the registered cancer was 151 months for anal, 112 months for vulva, 114 months for colon, and 126 months for stomach cancer. The association with previous invasive cervical cancer was also investigated; no patient with cervical cancer in this second analysis had been included in the CIN analysis. The odds ratios were similar. In addition, anal cancer patients were significantly more likely to have had cervical cancer than were patients with vulva cancer (odds ratio 1.8 [1.0-3.9]). The strong association between anal cancer and CIN/invasive cervical cancer suggests that these cancers share common risk factors. The association is at least as strong as that between cervical and vulva cancer. 
Reversible tricuspid stenosis. Demonstration with two-dimensional echocardiography and continuous-wave Doppler. We report a case of pseudo-tricuspid stenosis as a result of extrinsic compression of the tricuspid valve by a large right-sided pericardial effusion. Two-dimensional echocardiography and continuous-wave Doppler enabled accurate noninvasive diagnosis and hemodynamic assessment. 
Positive serum antibody and negative tissue staining for Helicobacter pylori in subjects with atrophic body gastritis. Helicobacter pylori is rarely found in gastric biopsy specimens from individuals with atrophic gastritis of the body mucosa. To determine if subjects with atrophic body gastritis have evidence of previous infection with H. pylori, immunoglobulin G antibody to H. pylori was measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay in sera of 399 Finnish subjects. In 124 subjects, multiple biopsy specimens from body and antrum had been evaluated for the presence of H. pylori by Giemsa staining. Antibody correlated well with H. pylori staining except in the subgroup with atrophic body gastritis, in whom the prevalence of seropositivity (86%) was significantly greater than the prevalence of positive staining (33%) (P less than 0.001). Twenty-five subjects had positive antibody and negative staining. This group had a significantly higher prevalence of atrophic body gastritis (80%), lower maximal acid output, lower serum pepsinogen I levels, and higher serum gastrin concentrations than did seropositive subjects with H. pylori. These data suggest that most patients with atrophic body gastritis, despite having a low incidence of current overt infection, have been infected with H. pylori at some point in their lives. 
Superoxide production by Crohn's disease neutrophils. Neutrophil superoxide anion production was measured in healthy subjects and in patients with quiescent and active Crohn's disease using superoxide dismutase inhibitable cytochrome C reduction. Three stimuli were used: phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA1), phorbol 20-oxo-20-deoxy 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA2), and Candida albicans in serum. Normal neutrophils produced significantly more superoxide anion than Crohn's disease neutrophils with both PMA1 (mean (SD) 9.6 (2.2) v 8.6 (1.8) nmol/10(6) cells/5 minutes, p = 0.04) and PMA2 (1.8 (0.8) v 0.8 (0.77) nmol/10(6) cells/5 minutes, p = 0.00004). With C albicans in serum, normal and Crohn's disease neutrophils produced similar amounts of superoxide anion (4.4 (1.5) v 4.3 (1.7) nmol/10(6) cells/30 minutes, not significant). Results were independent of disease activity. Superoxide anion production by PMA-stimulated Crohn's disease neutrophils is significantly lower than by normal neutrophils. 
Increased circulating concentration of the N-terminus of the atrial natriuretic factor prohormone in persons with pheochromocytomas. To investigate the possible relationship of hypertension and the N-terminus of the atrial natriuretic factor (ANF) prohormone which contains two peptides [i.e. pro ANF-(1-30) and pro-ANF-(31-67)] with blood pressure-lowering effects, we examined the circulating levels of the N-terminus of the ANF prohormone in three patients with pheochromocytomas before surgery, during an increase in their blood pressure with surgical manipulation of their tumors, and after surgery when their blood pressures returned to normal. The circulating levels of the whole N-terminus [amino acids 1-98; pro-ANF-(1-98)] and pro-ANF-(31-67) from the midportion of the N-terminus of the ANF prohormone were increased 2-fold in patients with both extraadrenal and intraadrenal pheochromocytomas. In both the intraadrenal and extraadrenal patients N-terminus [pro-ANF-(1-98)] and pro-ANF-(31-67) circulating levels increased further during surgical manipulation and returned to normal after surgical removal of their respective tumors. Each of these pheochromocytomas was found to have pro-ANF-(1-30) and -(31-67)-binding sites that were functional, since they could enhance the guanylate cyclase-cGMP system 2-fold in these pheochromocytomas. The entire 126 amino acids of the prohormone were present within each of the pheochromocytomas, since both the whole N-terminus and C-terminus (i.e. ANF) of the prohormone were present. Examination of the pheochromocytomas by electron microscopy revealed electron-dense granules similar to those in the heart, which have been associated with the synthesis and storage of the ANF prohormone. We conclude that 1) the whole N-terminus [pro-ANF-(1-98)] and pro-ANF-(31-67) of the ANF prohormone circulate at higher concentrations in persons with pheochromocytomas and return to normal with removal of the tumors; 2) pheochromocytomas contain specific binding sites for pro-ANF-(1-30) and -(31-67); 3) these binding sites are functional, since pro-ANF-(1-30) and -(31-67) could enhance the enzyme guanylate cyclase within these tumors; and 4) the entire 126 amino acids of the ANF prohormone are present within these tumors, which have electron-dense granules associated with polypeptide hormone synthesis, suggesting that the ANF prohormone is being synthesized within the pheochromocytomas. 
Use of human recombinant erythropoietin to correct severe preoperative anemia. The risks of homologous blood transfusion are well known. Herein, we describe the successful preoperative use of human recombinant erythropoietin to correct severe anemia in a patient refusing transfusion. This case report emphasizes the important perioperative role human recombinant erythropoietin may play in the future. 
Cancer staging may have different meanings in academic and community hospitals. We investigated differences in lung cancer care and outcome between academic and community settings for all lung cancer patients diagnosed during 1973-1976 in New Hampshire and Vermont. Trained abstracters reviewed hospital charts to record personal, diagnostic, and clinical information, and survival was determined for all patients through the end of 1979. Patients diagnosed in university hospital cancer centers underwent more staging procedures and tended to be assigned to a higher stage than similar patients diagnosed in community hospitals. When tumor stage was considered as a covariable in a survival analysis, these patients appeared to have a lower mortality rate both for non-small cell tumors (mortality rate ratio, 95% confidence interval = 0.81, 0.71-0.91) and for small cell tumors (0.71, 0.55-0.91). When functional status rather than tumor stage was used to adjust for disease severity, there was no apparent survival advantage for university patients with non-small cell cancer (0.96, 0.85-1.09) and the lower mortality for small cell cancers (0.76, 0.59-0.97) was attenuated, although still statistically significant. We conclude that inconsistently-collected data on clinical stage can complicate comparisons of prognosis between cancer patients from different types of hospitals and that measures of performance status may be more useful indicators of disease severity in population based studies. 
Changes in intracranial CSF volume after lumbar puncture and their relationship to post-LP headache. Post-lumbar puncture (LP) headache may be due to "low CSF pressure", leading to stretching of pain sensitive intracranial structures. The low intracranial pressure is secondary to net loss of intracranial CSF. It has, however, not been possible to measure intracranial CSF volume accurately during life until recently. Intracranial CSF volume can now be measured non-invasively by a MRI technique. The changes in intracranial CSF volume were studied in 20 patients who had LP. Total intracranial CSF volume was reduced in 19 of the 20 patients 24 hours after LP (range -1.8 mls to -158.6 mls). Most of the CSF was lost from the cortical sulci. Very large reductions in intracranial CSF volume were frequently related to post-LP headache but some patients developed headache with relatively little alteration in the intracranial CSF volume. There was not a measurable change in position of the intracranial structures following LP. 
Prognostic value of proliferating cell nuclear antigen in gastric carcinoma. A new monoclonal antibody to proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA), PC10, which can be used on routinely processed tissue, was applied to 93 cases of gastric carcinoma. Significant intra-tumoural variation in staining occurred. In addition to a PCNA index (percentage of positive cells per 1000 tumour cells), a semiquantitative PCNA grading system was devised, based on estimates of less than or more than 50% of positive tumour cells in whole sections. Neither PCNA index nor PCNA grade showed any correlation with established histological variables, tumour stage, or the presence of lymph node metastases. No significant correlation was observed between PCNA index and S + G2M phase fraction measured by flow cytometric analysis. To analyse survival tumours with PCNA indices above and below the median level (41%) were compared. Those with a higher index tended to have a worse prognosis, but when PCNA grade was considered, it was found to have definite independent prognostic value, tumours of low grade surviving better than those of high grade. The ability of semiquantitative PCNA grading to allow for intra-tumoural variation suggests it may have advantages over absolute counting, which is prone to sampling error when tumour heterogeneity is a major factor. The prognostic value of PC10 staining in gastric carcinoma is therefore promising. 
Renal oncocytomas--an Australian experience. A review was made of 24 cases of renal oncocytoma seen between 1978 and 1989. There was considerable overlap between the clinical presentation of renal oncocytomas and renal carcinomas. Although pre-operative radiological, cytological and pathological investigations may suggest the presence of an oncocytoma, these studies cannot make a definitive diagnosis. We recommend that these tumours be treated as potential renal carcinomas until post-operative microscopic evaluation proves otherwise. 
Transient myocardial ischemia during daily life in rest and exertional angina pectoris and comparison of effectiveness of metoprolol versus nifedipine. The clinical characteristics of 65 patients with mixed angina were classified by means of (1) a questionnaire investigating the proportion of symptoms occurring at rest and on effort, (2) an exercise stress test, (3) 24-hour ambulatory Holter monitoring, and (4) coronary arteriography. According to the questionnaire, the proportion of effort-induced anginal episodes ranged from 1 to 99%. The ischemic threshold during exercise testing ranged from 110 x 10(2) to 350 x 10(2) mm Hg x beats/min. At least 1 episode of ST-segment depression was observed in 29 of the 65 patients during Holter monitoring. Ischemic episodes during Holter monitoring were more frequent (p less than 0.05) in patients reporting greater than or equal to 50% of anginal attacks on effort, with moderate to severe limitation of exercise capacity and with multivessel coronary artery disease. The effect on ambulatory ischemia of a 6-week treatment with a beta blocker (metoprolol CR, 200 mg once daily) or a dihydropyridine calcium antagonist (nifedipine retard 20 mg twice daily) were then compared according to a double-blind, parallel group design. Metoprolol significantly reduced the number and duration of the ischemic episodes during daily life (p less than 0.05) irrespective of the patients' clinical characteristics. Nifedipine was ineffective, particularly in patients with angina predominantly on effort and with a moderate to severe reduction in exercise tolerance. It is concluded that in patients with mixed angina, ischemic episodes during daily life are more likely to occur in patients with a clinical presentation suggesting poor coronary reserve. 
Liver transplantation for alcoholic liver disease, viral hepatitis, and hepatic neoplasms. In closing, it is important to note that the indications for liver transplantation are not static but rather are remarkably dynamic and capable of change over time. Thus yesterday's major indications can become relative contraindications, while yesterday's absolute contraindications have become today's nuisances. The goal for physicians who care for individuals with problems such as alcoholic liver disease, viral hepatitis, and hepatic cancer should be to develop new strategies of care that will ultimately eliminate these diseases as problems, rather than eliminating individuals with such health problems from currently available health options. In other words, physicians who accept the responsibility for a patient's life should be searching for the best form of therapy available for their patient rather than examining the reasons that exist for limiting one's choice in health care. 
The value of class IC antiarrhythmic drugs for acute conversion of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation or flutter to sinus rhythm. In a single-blind randomized study, the efficacy and safety of intravenous propafenone (2 mg/kg body weight per 10 min) versus flecainide (2 mg/kg per 10 min) were assessed in 50 patients with atrial fibrillation or flutter. Treatment was considered successful if sinus rhythm occurred within 1 h. Conversion to sinus was achieved in 11 (55%) of 20 patients with atrial fibrillation treated with propafenone and in 18 (90%) of 20 with atrial fibrillation treated with flecainide (p less than 0.02). If atrial fibrillation was present less than or equal to 24 h, conversion to sinus rhythm was achieved in 8 (57%) of 14 patients in the propafenone group and 13 (93%) of 14 in the flecainide group (p less than 0.05). Atrial flutter was converted in two (40%) of five patients treated with propafenone and in one (20%) of five with flecainide (p = NS). Mean time to conversion was 16 +/- 10 min in the propafenone group versus 18 +/- 13 min in the flecainide group (p = NS). QRS lengthening (83 +/- 15 to 99 +/- 20 ms) was observed only in the patients treated with flecainide (p less than 0.001). Patients successfully treated with propafenone showed significantly higher plasma levels than those whose arrhythmia did not convert to sinus rhythm. Transient adverse effects were more frequent in the flecainide group (40%) than in the propafenone group (8%) (p less than 0.01). In conclusion, at a dose of 2 mg/kg in 10 min, flecainide is more effective than propafenone for conversion of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation to sinus rhythm. However, considering the propafenone plasma levels and very few adverse effects, the dose or infusion rate, or both, used in the propafenone group may not have been sufficient to achieve an optimal effect. Neither drug seems very effective in patients with atrial flutter. 
Intracerebral hemorrhage related to cerebral amyloid angiopathy and t-PA treatment. Tissue plasminogen activator (t-PA) has been approved as thrombolytic therapy for the treatment of acute myocardial infarction, but this agent can cause serious bleeding complications including intracerebral hemorrhages. Mechanisms underlying the development of these hemorrhages have not been clarified. We report a patient who developed two intracerebral hemorrhages shortly after receiving t-PA for the treatment of an acute myocardial infarction, and who was found to have cerebral amyloid angiopathy at autopsy. Staining of cortical sections with Congo red and an antibody directed against beta amyloid protein (A4 peptide) disclosed specific involvement of most of the subarachnoid and superficial cortical vessels in the region of the two hemorrhages. Based on the findings in this patient and in 6 additional patients reported recently, it is likely that cerebral amyloid angiopathy plays a pathogenic role in some intracerebral hemorrhages associated with the administration of t-PA. The cautious use of t-PA with heparin in patients who are elderly or demented may be advisable. 
The initiation of failure in cemented femoral components of hip arthroplasties. We studied 16 femora retrieved at post-mortem from symptomless patients who had a satisfactory cemented total hip arthroplasty from two weeks to 17 years earlier, with the aim of delineating the initial mechanisms involved in loosening. Only one specimen showed radiographic evidence of loosening; the other 15 were stable to mechanical testing at 17.0 Nm of torque. In all 16 specimens, the cement-bone interface was intact with little fibrous tissue formation. By contrast, separation at the cement-prosthesis interface and fractures in the cement mantle were frequent. The most common early feature was debonding of the cement from the metal, seen at the proximal and distal ends of the prosthesis. Specimens which had been in place for longer also showed circumferential fractures in the cement, near the cement-metal interface, and radial fractures extending from this interface into the cement and sometimes to the bony interface. The most extensive cement fractures appeared to have started at or near sharp corners in the metal, or where the cement mantle was thin or incomplete. Fractures were also related to voids in the cement. The time relationship in this series suggested that long-term failure of the fixation of cemented femoral components was primarily mechanical, starting with debonding at the interface between the cement and the prosthesis, and continuing as slowly developing fractures in the cement mantle. 
Epicardial coronary artery tone and reactivity in patients with normal coronary arteriograms and reduced coronary flow reserve (syndrome X) The vasomotor response of proximal and distal angiographically normal coronary artery segments was studied in 12 patients with syndrome X, 17 age- and gender-matched patients with chronic stable angina and 10 control subjects with atypical chest pain and a normal coronary arteriogram. Ergonovine (300 micrograms by intravenous injection) and isosorbide dinitrate (1 mg by intracoronary injection) were administered to all patients. Computerized coronary artery diameter measurement (angiographically normal segments only) was carried out before and after the administration of ergonovine and nitrate. Baseline intraluminal diameters (mean +/- SEM) of proximal and distal coronary segments were not significantly different in control subjects and patients with syndrome X or coronary artery disease (proximal 2.88 +/- 0.19, 3.01 +/- 0.13 and 2.86 +/- 0.13 mm; distal 1.57 +/- 0.09, 1.70 +/- 0.10 and 1.61 +/- 0.06 mm, respectively). With ergonovine, proximal segments constricted by 10 +/- 2%, 7 +/- 2% and 11 +/- 3% and distal segments by 12 +/- 3%, 14 +/- 3% and 14 +/- 2% in control subjects and patients with syndrome X or coronary artery disease, respectively (p = NS). With isosorbide dinitrate, proximal coronary segments dilated by 11 +/- 2%, 10 +/- 2% and 8 +/- 2% (p = NS) and distal segments by 15 +/- 2%, 11 +/- 3% and 13 +/- 2% (p = NS) in control subjects and patients with syndrome X or coronary artery disease, respectively. Within groups, constriction in response to ergonovine and dilation in response to nitrate were not significantly different in proximal and distal segments. 
Surgical evaluation of Henoch-Schonlein purpura. Experience with 110 children. Henoch-Schonlein purpura is a disorder of unknown origin that is probably related to an autoimmune phenomenon. This report concerns 110 children (mean age, 6.2 years; range, 6 months to 14 years) with Henoch-Schonlein purpura. Seventy-two (65%) had abdominal pain associated with nausea and vomiting, bloody stool, and upper gastrointestinal bleeding. Sixty patients with abdominal pain were evaluated and treated conservatively. However, 12 patients underwent laparotomy. Six underwent unnecessary appendectomy for wrongly diagnosed appendicitis. Bowel resection was performed in one patient for an obstructive ileal lesion. Six additional patients had intussusception; surgery was required in three, while barium enema reduction was successfully accomplished in three others. Massive gastric hemorrhage required ligation, vagotomy, and pyloroplasty in two instances. One child with severe scrotal pain, hemorrhage, and swelling underwent unnecessary scrotal exploration. Four additional patients with similar symptoms avoided operation after a testicular scintiscan demonstrated good blood flow. A high index of suspicion and early diagnosis of Henoch-Schonlein purpura based on clinical, roentgenographic, and laboratory findings may avoid unnecessary operations in most cases. However, life-threatening complications (hemorrhage, obstruction, and intussusception) may occur and require operative intervention. All of the patients survived. 
Surgically induced endometriosis does not alter peritoneal factors in the rabbit model. OBJECTIVE: It was the purpose of this study to examine the cause and effect relationship between alterations in peritoneal factors and the presence of ectopic endometrium in the rabbit model. DESIGN: Forty rabbits had autologous endometrial or omental (control) tissue surgically implanted. Peritoneal fluid (PF) volume, macrophage number, and macrophage activation, as well as the number of implants with adhesions, were compared with values obtained during the initial surgery. The effect of hormonal treatment on these factors was evaluated at a third laparotomy. RESULTS: There was a significant increase (P less than 0.05) of adhesions in animals with endometrial implants. Peritoneal fluid volume, macrophage number, or macrophage activation were not increased in rabbits with endometrial implants as compared with controls, nor was there a response to hormonal manipulation. CONCLUSIONS: These results demonstrate that PF volume, macrophage number, and macrophage activation are not altered by endometrial implants in the rabbit model. This suggests that the increase in these peritoneal factors in women with endometriosis may not be caused exclusively by the presence of ectopic endometrial tissue. 
Jugular venous 'a' wave in dilated cardiomyopathy: sign of abbreviated right ventricular filling time. OBJECTIVE--To study the mechanisms underlying the high venous pressure often seen in patients with dilated cardiomyopathy. DESIGN--Retrospective and prospective examination of the pattern of flow in the superior vena cava, cardiac echo-Doppler studies, and recordings of the jugular venous pulse. SETTING--A tertiary referral cardiac centre. PATIENTS PARTICIPANTS--23 patients with dilated cardiomyopathy, all with functional mitral and tricuspid regurgitation. RESULTS--Two patterns of venous pulse were seen: a dominant 'a' wave and 'x' descent, with systolic flow in the superior vena cava (group 1, n = 11), and a dominant 'v' wave with 'y' descent and diastolic flow in the superior vena cava (group 2, n = 12). A comparison of group 1 and group 2 showed: age (mean (SD] 58 (12) v 61 (6) years, left ventricular end diastolic dimension 7.0 (0.7) cm in both groups, right ventricular short axis 3.3 (0.6) v 3.6 (0.5) cm and long axis 7.3 (0.5) v 7.1 (0.7) cm, and duration of tricuspid regurgitation 350 (65) v 370 (50) ms. The RR interval (550 (100) v 680 (80) ms) and right ventricular filling time (150 (30) v 290 (50) ms) were significantly shorter in group 1. In all patients in group 2 right ventricular filling time was more than 200 ms with separate E and A waves on the tricuspid Doppler echocardiogram, while in all group 1 patients it was less than 200 ms with a single summation peak. In nine patients in group 1, the right ventricular filling time was limited by prolonged tricuspid regurgitation and in the remaining two by prolonged isovolumic relaxation time (215 (80) ms), so that it was consistently significantly less than that of the left ventricle. CONCLUSION--In patients with dilated cardiomyopathy, right ventricular filling time may be so short that it limits stroke volume. Such patients can be recognised by a dominant 'a' wave on the jugular venous pulse. Patients in whom the right ventricular filling time was longer showed a dominant 'v' wave. Both groups can present as "congestive heart failure". 
Impaired response of atrial natriuretic factor to blood volume expansion in acute right ventricular infarction. To assess the role of atrial natriuretic factor (ANF) in right ventricular (RV) infarction, 30 patients with inferior wall acute myocardial infarction (15 with RV involvement) and normal left heart filling pressures were studied 39 +/- 12 hours after the onset of symptoms. Serial measurements of cardiac output, right atrial, pulmonary artery and pulmonary wedge pressures, as well as plasma ANF, plasma renin activity, plasma aldosterone and vasopressin were obtained before and 30 minutes after acute volume expansion to raise wedge pressure greater than or equal to 20 mm Hg. Baseline mean right atrial pressure and plasma ANF levels were greater in patients with than without RV infarction (8 +/- 3 vs 5 +/- 2 mm Hg; p less than 0.0001, and 4.6 +/- 2.9 vs 2.7 +/- 1.5 fmol/ml; p less than 0.05, respectively). There were no differences in other baseline hemodynamic or humoral parameters between both groups. After volume expansion, pulmonary wedge pressure was similar in both groups, but right atrial pressure increased to higher levels in patients with RV infarction (19 +/- 2 vs 14 +/- 2 mm Hg; p less than 0.0001). Despite this greater stimulus for ANF secretion, the increase in plasma ANF was less pronounced in patients with RV infarction (63 +/- 81 vs 455 +/- 417%; p less than 0.002), especially among those with paroxysmal supraventricular tachyarrhythmias. Thus, despite higher baseline plasma levels of ANF, response to volume loading is markedly attenuated in patients with RV infarction complicating an inferior wall acute myocardial infarction. 
Relative importance of eight virulence characteristics of pyelonephritogenic Escherichia coli strains assessed by multivariate statistical analysis. We have previously reported univariate statistical analysis of the prevalences of putative virulence determinants in Escherichia coli isolated from children and adults with acute pyelonephritis. The expression of P-fimbriae, cell surface hydrophobicity, mannose resistant haemagglutination, haemolysin synthesis, cytotoxic necrotizing factor production and aerobactin mediated iron uptake occurred more often in a collection of 115 Escherichia coli strains isolated from children and women with acute non-obstructive pyelonephritis compared to 96 strains isolated from the commensal fecal flora. With the aim to study which of these virulence markers were independently associated with strains causing infection we performed a multivariate statistical analysis with the data from these strains. The previously proposed virulence factors, expression of type 1 fimbriae and adhesion to HeLa cells were also included in the analysis. P-fimbriae, mannose resistant haemagglutination and the production of haemolysin were, in the multivariate analysis, associated with strains isolated from patients with acute pyelonephritis. 
Sensitivity, specificity and predictive value of the sensation of warmth as a method of detecting inadvertent subarachnoid injection of local anaesthetic when performing extradural blocks. In order to test if the rate of onset of sensation of warmth in the legs after the injection of 0.5% bupivacaine might discriminate between subarachnoid and extradural injection, 150 urological patients were allocated randomly to receive either spinal anaesthesia with isobaric (IS) or hyperbaric (HS) 0.5% bupivacaine, or extradural anaesthesia with isobaric 0.5% bupivacaine. The volume of the local anaesthetic for spinal anaesthesia and for the extradural test dose was 3-4 ml. The patients were asked to report at once if they had a sensation of warmth in the legs during or after injection of local anaesthetic. The mean time to the sensation of warmth was significantly shorter in the spinal groups (80 (SEM 10) s in IS and 76 (8.0) s in HS) than in the extradural group (558 (38) s). However, six patients in the IS and two in the HS group had no sensation of warmth. 
Recommendations for preventing transmission of human immunodeficiency virus and hepatitis B virus to patients during exposure-prone invasive procedures. This document has been developed by the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) to update recommendations for prevention of transmission of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and hepatitis B virus (HBV) in the health-care setting. Current data suggest that the risk for such transmission from a health-care worker (HCW) to a patient during an invasive procedure is small; a precise assessment of the risk is not yet available. This document contains recommendations to provide guidance for prevention of HIV and HBV transmission during those invasive procedures that are considered exposure-prone. 
The value of pancreatic pseudocyst amylase concentration in the detection of pseudocyst communication with the pancreatic duct. The aims of the study were to compare the results of endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) and percutaneous cystopancreatography (PCP) in the detection of the communication between the pancreatic pseudocyst and the pancreatic duct, and to assess the reliability of the increased amylase concentration in the pseudocyst content as an indicator of the existence of communication between the pancreatic pseudocyst and the pancreatic duct system. Forty-three patients were included in the study. Pseudocystic fluid content was obtained by percutaneous aspiration. Twenty-four patients had pseudocyst amylase concentrations above 64 Wolgemuth units (WU), and 19 patients had less than 64 WU. The communication between pseudocyst and the pancreatic duct was determined in 22 patients by ERCP and in 13 patients by PCP, all in the group with increased pseudocyst amylase concentration. Due to high sensitivity and specificity of pseudocyst amylase concentration for the existence of pseudocyst communication with the pancreatic duct, we conclude that guided percutaneous aspiration of the pancreatic pseudocyst with the determination of amylase concentration in the fluid can replace ERCP as a method of choice for the detection of pseudocyst communication with the pancreatic duct. 
Intestinal injury after lumbar discectomy. In a review of 5,200 lumbar discectomies performed from 1974 to 1989, two patients sustained a ventral perforation of the disc space followed by isolated small intestinal injury. Both patients underwent lumbar discectomy at the lumbosacral junction and presented with signs and symptoms of acute abdominal distress within three days after the operation. At surgical laparotomy, small tears were noted in the ileum, which were closed primarily. The patients had an uneventful recovery. The results of a review of 11 instances reported in the literature suggest that isolated intestinal injuries usually occur postoperatively at the lumbosacral junction and involve the small intestine. Factors, such as body habitus, surgical experience, patient positioning and types of instruments, as well as the use of a surgical microscope, do not appear to modify the risk of intestinal injury. After discectomy, patients may present with acute abdominal signs and symptoms or chronic wound infections. Work-up studies include evaluation of vascular structures and ureters either roentgenographically or at abdominal exploration. A high index of suspicion and adequate disc space visualization during discectomy may reduce the incidence of this complication. 
Salvage of nonunion following ankle arthrodesis for failed total ankle arthroplasty. Revision operations for nonunion following total ankle arthrodesis for total ankle arthroplasty (TAA) were reviewed in ten patients. Operations averaged 2.0 years after prior arthrodesis attempts and featured external fixation in seven, internal fixation in one, percutaneous pin fixation in one, and cast immobilization only in one. Bone graft was used in seven. Union was achieved in 78%. The one complication was an infection in a patient with prior sepsis. The results were considered excellent in three, good in one, fair in three, and poor in two of the nine patients with adequate follow-up evaluation (average, 7 years). Despite successful arthrodesis, residual symptoms were common because of factors such as hindfoot degenerative arthritis and malalignment. 
Serum vitamin D metabolites and bone mineralization in young children with chronic low to moderate lead exposure. One hundred five children (49 male, 99 black) with known lead exposure indices from birth and adequate nutrient intake of calcium, phosphorus, and vitamin D were studied at 1 of 3 ages (21, 27, or 33 months) to determine the effects of chronic low to moderate lead exposure on circulating concentrations of vitamin D metabolites and bone mineral content as determined by photon absorptiometry. Univariate multiple regression analyses showed no direct relationship of blood lead levels to vitamin D metabolites or bone mineral content. Structural equation analyses which took into account potential covariates of age, season, race, and sex showed estimated declines in serum concentrations of total calcium (from 9.72 to 9.61 mg/dL), phosphorus (from 5.4 to 4.67 mg/dL), and 25-hydroxyvitamin D (from 27.24 to 25.8 ng/mL) and estimated increases in concentrations of parathyroid hormones (from 73.03 to 83.14 microL Eq/mL), 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D (from 62.39 to 62.69 pg/mL), and bone mineral content (from 222.66 to 234.91 mg/cm) over the observed range of average lifetime blood lead concentrations (4.76 to 23.61 micrograms/dL, geometric mean 9.74 micrograms/dL). However, the only statistically significant effect of average lifetime blood lead concentration was that for phosphorus, and the multivariate test of the combined effects of lead on these six outcomes was not statistically significant (P = .2). It is concluded that significant alterations in vitamin D metabolism, calcium and phosphorus homeostasis, and bone mineral content are not present in children whose nutritional status is adequate and who experience low to moderate lead exposure. 
A weekly cisplatin-based induction regimen for extensive non-small cell lung cancer. A Southwest Oncology Group study. The purpose of this Phase II pilot study was to determine whether a dose-intensive regimen of weekly cisplatin combined with other active non-cross-resistant agents would improve the response rate and survival time of patients with extensive non-small cell lung cancer. Patients received cisplatin (50 mg/m2/wk) on days 1, 8, 15, 22, 36, 43, 50, and 57 combined with mitomycin C (8 mg/m2) on days 1 and 36, vinblastine (3 mg/m2) on days 8 and 43, and 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) (1 g/m2) by continuous infusion over 24 hours on days 15 and 50. Responding patients received consolidation therapy with cisplatin and etoposide (VP-16). Of 82 registered patients, 80 were eligible and 77 were evaluable for response. The overall response rate was 23% with 1 patient achieving a complete response (CR) and 17 patients achieving a partial response (PR). The median survival time was 4.6 months. The toxicity profile was not different from that described for standard-dose regimens. Although this regimen does not offer any benefit over standard-dose cisplatin regimens for patients with extensive non-small lung cancer, the weekly schedule permits a dose-intensive regimen with acceptable toxicity for tumors that may benefit from this approach. 
Increased expression of intercellular adhesion molecule 1 on bile ducts in primary biliary cirrhosis and primary sclerosing cholangitis. It has been suggested that immunological mechanisms involving lymphocyte-mediated damage are important in the characteristic bile-duct damage that occurs in primary biliary cirrhosis and primary sclerosing cholangitis. Because adhesion is necessary for the interaction of lymphocytes with their target structures, we have studied the expression of intercellular adhesion molecule 1, a ligand for the leukocyte adhesion receptor lymphocyte function-associated antigen 1 in the liver of patients with primary biliary cirrhosis and primary sclerosing cholangitis. Strong expression of intercellular adhesion molecule 1 was seen on interlobular bile ducts and proliferating bile ductules in both conditions. In primary biliary cirrhosis, medium-sized ducts, which are spared by the disease, were negative. Minimal bile-duct staining was seen in conditions in which bile-duct damage is not a major feature, such as nonbiliary cirrhosis and acute liver diseases. In patients with cirrhosis from any cause, strong expression of intercellular adhesion molecule 1 was detected on the periseptal hepatocytes adjacent to new connective tissue. The intensity of immunohistochemical staining was recorded using a semiquantitative visual scoring system that was subsequently validated quantitatively by confocal laser scanning microscopy. The expression/induction of intercellular adhesion molecule 1 on bile ducts may be important in the pathogenesis of bile-duct damage in primary biliary cirrhosis and primary sclerosing cholangitis and is further evidence to support an immune pathogenesis in these two conditions. Furthermore, the induction of intercellular adhesion molecule 1 on hepatocytes may be an important factor in the liver-cell damage and fibrosis that occur during the development of cirrhosis. 
Salvage of thrombosed forearm polytetrafluoroethylene vascular access grafts by reversal of flow direction and venous bypass grafting. A technique is described for salvage of looped forearm polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) vascular access grafts that fail because of thrombosis due to cephalic vein outflow obstruction. It entails reversal of blood flow direction through the graft and construction of a new venous outflow in the medial upper arm. This procedure was performed in nine patients and, at the present time, has increased the graft life by an average of 6.2 months (range: 2 to 14 months) in eight. We conclude that this is a useful alternative to abandoning failed looped forearm PTFE grafts that have cephalic vein outflow obstruction. 
A comparison of dopexamine and dopamine to prevent renal impairment in patients undergoing orthotopic liver transplantation. The efficacy of low-dose dopamine as a renal protective agent was compared with that of dopexamine in patients who underwent orthotopic liver transplantation. Twelve patients who received a continuous infusion of dopexamine (1-3 micrograms/kg/minute) were matched for age, diagnosis, pre-operative creatinine clearance and blood loss with 12 patients who received a low-dose infusion of dopamine (2 micrograms/kg/minute). The catecholamine infusion was started after induction of anaesthesia and continued for 48 hours after surgery. Patients in the dopexamine group had less evidence of renal impairment and failure than those in the dopamine group during 7 days after the operation, although the differences between groups did not achieve statistical significance. Similarly there were no significant differences between the two groups in peri-operative urine output, urine/plasma osmolality ratio or creatine clearance. Dopexamine is at least as effective as dopamine for renal protection in patients who undergo liver transplantation. 
Alteration of urinary carnitine profile induced by benzoate administration. To study the effect of sodium benzoate on carnitine metabolism, the acylcarnitine profile in the urine of five normal volunteers and two patients with urea cycle disorders was examined with fast atom bombardment-mass spectrometry. The volunteer subjects were given 5 g of sodium benzoate orally and the two patients with urea cycle disorders (carbamyl phosphate synthetase deficiency type I and ornithine transcarbamylase deficiency) were already undergoing treatment with sodium benzoate and L-carnitine. The amount of benzoylcarnitine excretion depended on the dose of both sodium benzoate and L-carnitine in a reciprocal relation. Increased excretions of acetylcarnitine and propionylcarnitine were also noted after sodium benzoate administration. The alteration of the urinary aclycarnitine profile was consistent with the change of mitochondrial CoA profile predicted by in vitro studies of an animal model. It is suggested that urinary acylcarnitine analysis is important to assess the effect of benzoate administration on mitochondrial function in vivo. Supplementation with carnitine may be necessary to minimise the adverse effects of sodium benzoate treatment in hyperammonaemia. 
Magnetic resonance imaging of spinal trauma. A retrospective series of 118 magnetic resonance examinations of 110 patients who had sustained previous spinal trauma is reported. Examinations performed within 3 weeks of trauma showed extraspinal soft tissue (including ligamentous) injury in 48% and intraspinal lesions in 61% (mostly consisting of extradural haematoma and spinal cord contusion). In examinations performed more than 3 weeks after injury intraspinal abnormalities were shown in 51% and these represented spinal cord compression, atrophy, myelomalacia and syringohydromyelia. Magnetic resonance imaging has the unique capability of displaying non-invasively the late sequelae of spinal trauma permitting simultaneous evaluation of the extra-spinal soft tissues, vertebral column and spinal cord. It is therefore recommended as the technique of choice in the investigation of patients who have sustained previous spinal injury, particularly those with neurological deficit. In the acute phase potentially remediable causes of neurological impairment such as disc herniation or extradural haematoma can be identified. Signal changes in the cord may allow the prognosis for neurological recovery to be established. In the later stages sequelae such as cord atrophy, myelomalacia and syringohydromyelia are accurately identified and surgical therapy may be guided, where appropriate. 
Altered density of glomerular binding sites for atrial natriuretic factor in bile duct-ligated rats with ascites. The renal response to atrial natriuretic factor is blunted in cirrhosis with ascites. This might be due to alterations of renal receptors for atrial natriuretic factor. Therefore density and affinity of glomerular atrial natriuretic factor binding sites of bile duct-ligated rats with ascites (n = 10) and of sham-operated controls (n = 10) were determined. Glomerular atrial natriuretic factor binding sites were identified to be of the B-("biologically active") and C-("clearance") receptor type. Discrimination and quantitative determination of B and C receptors for atrial natriuretic factor were achieved by displacement experiments with atrial natriuretic factor(99-126) or des(18-22)atrial natriuretic factor(4-23), an analogue binding to C receptors only. Density of total glomerular atrial natriuretic factor binding sites was significantly increased in bile duct-ligated rats (3,518 +/- 864 vs. 1,648 +/- 358 fmol/mg protein; p less than 0.05). This was due to a significant increase of C-receptor density (3,460 +/- 866 vs. 1,486 +/- 363 fmol/mg protein; p less than 0.05), whereas density of B receptors was not significantly different in bile duct-ligated rats (58 +/- 11 vs. 162 +/- 63 fmol/mg protein). Affinity of atrial natriuretic factor to its glomerular binding sites did not differ significantly between both groups. These data suggest that an altered glomerular atrial natriuretic factor receptor density could be involved in the renal resistance to atrial natriuretic factor in cirrhosis with ascites. 
The change in patterns of relapse in medulloblastoma. The authors reviewed 89 patients treated for cerebellar medulloblastoma between 1970 and 1989 to determine the impact of changing treatment (high-dose posterior fossa radiation therapy and chemotherapy) on the pattern of failure in medulloblastoma. Between 1970 and 1983, 50 patients (median follow-up, 110 months) were treated with surgery and postoperative craniospinal irradiation (CSI). Nineteen of the 50 (38%) recurred in the central nervous system (CNS). Isolated systemic (bone) metastases occurred in six. The median time to the development of bone metastases was 12 months. Since 1984, 39 patients (median follow-up, 27 months) were treated with preradiation chemotherapy consisting of cisplatin and vincristine for 9 weeks before initiation of CSI. Nine of the 39 (23%) patients recurred in the CNS. There were no systemic failures in this cohort. The actuarial 5-year disease-free survival was 55 +/- 7% for the earlier cohort and 72 +/- 8% for the later cohort (P equals 0.3). Posterior fossa recurrence was associated with radiation therapy to this area. The cumulative incidence of posterior fossa relapse was 50 +/- 13% in patients who received less than 5300 cGy and 18 +/- 7% in those who received 5300 cGy or more (P equals 0.005). All six bone relapses were in patients treated with CSI alone and 5300 cGy or more to the posterior fossa for a 5-year cumulative incidence of bone metastases of 18 +/- 7% compared with 0% for patients treated with 5300 cGy or more and chemotherapy (P equals 0.03). The authors concluded that high-dose radiation therapy has altered the pattern of relapse with an increase in systemic recurrence after radiation therapy alone that is now equivalent to the risk of recurrence in the posterior fossa. Chemotherapy may be indicated in an attempt to decrease this high risk of systemic metastases.
