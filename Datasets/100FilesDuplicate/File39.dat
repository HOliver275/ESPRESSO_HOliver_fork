4	Preclinical pharmacology of celiprolol: a cardioselective beta-adrenergic antagonist and mild vasodilator. Celiprolol is a new antihypertensive agent that represents a new generation of beta-blockers. It combines cardioselective beta-adrenergic antagonism (beta 1) with a mild vasodilation via vasoselective beta-adrenergic agonism (beta 2). Results of animal studies show that celiprolol has beta 1-antagonist potency similar to that of propranolol and atenolol, and cardioselectivity slightly greater than that of atenolol. Celiprolol does not produce bronchoconstriction but has mild propranolol-resistant bronchodilatory properties in cats. The compound also relaxes vascular smooth muscle in a propranolol-sensitive fashion, suggesting a mechanism of beta 2-agonism. The beta 2-agonism results in a selective downregulation in beta 2-receptor number and response in tissue culture, as well as in peripheral tissue from celiprolol-treated volunteers. The decreases in beta 2-receptors are blocked by concomitant treatment with propranolol. Celiprolol is devoid of cardiac depressant activity and in fact has mild cardiostimulatory actions. The cardiostimulation is not via beta 1-stimulation, since it is not abolished by beta-blocking doses of propranolol. In a model of severe myocardial ischemia, celiprolol attenuates the ischemia-induced myocardial acidosis and improves the regional segment function. These results are suggestive of myocardial protection. In summary, celiprolol distinguishes itself from other beta-blockers by virtue of its cardioselectivity, vasorelaxation via beta 2-agonism, and the lack of bronchoconstriction and cardiodepression. These properties observed in animal studies have also been documented in clinical trials. 
2	Clinicopathologic features of hepatocellular carcinoma in young patients. To investigate clinicopathologic characteristics of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in young adults, excised tumors from 21 patients younger than 45 years (young group) were compared with findings in tumors from 204 patients older than 45 (old group). In the young group HCC showed (1) a high incidence of positive hepatitis B virus surface antigen (HBsAg) (young 71.4% versus old 20.1%); (2) relatively well-preserved hepatocellular function (indocyanine green test; young 10.7 +/- 8.8% versus old 20.6 +/- 10.8%); (3) low incidence of histologically verified concomitant cirrhosis (young 52.4% versus old 78.4%); and (4) a more advanced stage of the disease in TNM classification (Stage III; young 52.4% versus old 18.1%). With respect to survival rates achieved by surgery, there was no statistically significant difference between the two groups. Thus, hepatitis B virus may relate to the occurrence of HCC in the young patients. Despite the advanced stage in the young group, survival rate after surgery was comparable with that achieved in the old group. These observations mean that a close periodic surveillance of young adults with a positive HBsAg is required to detect HCC at an early stage. Treatment of patients with HBsAg using interferon or vidarabine and hepatitis B vaccine should be made to convert HBsAg to negative in these individuals. 
3	The relation of pain to depression among institutionalized aged. Nursing home and congregate apartment residents (N = 598) were classified on the basis of a DSM-IIIR symptom checklist as suffering possible major, minor, or no depression; they also completed the Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS) and the Profile of Mood States (POMS). Possible major depressives reported more intense pain and a greater number of localized pain complaints than did minor depressives; nondepressed individuals reported the least intense pain and fewest localized complaints. The effect remained strong even when functional disability and health status were controlled statistically. Both pain intensity and number of localized complaints were correlated with GDS and POMS factor scores, but strength and direction of associations varied with level of depression. Item-by-item examination of localized complaints again indicated that more depressed individuals were more likely to report pain, particularly where physicians had identified a physical problem that might account for the pain. Results are compared with previous research on pain among younger individuals. Implications for treatment of depressed elderly are discussed. 
5	Antibodies to Epstein-Barr virus in iridocorneal endothelial syndrome. Antibody titers to Epstein-Barr virus were determined in 13 patients with iridocorneal endothelial syndrome and in 13 healthy race-, age-, and sex-matched controls. Both the geometric mean titer of IgG antibodies to the Epstein-Barr virus capsid antigen and the proportion with high titers of IgG antibodies to the Epstein-Barr virus capsid antigen (greater than or equal to 1:640) were significantly higher in 12 seropositive patients with iridocorneal endothelial syndrome than in 12 seropositive controls (1/761:1/202, P = .001; 83.3%:8.3%, P less than .001). Ten of 12 seropositive patients with iridocorneal endothelial syndrome and five of 12 seropositive controls had antibodies to Epstein-Barr virus-induced early antigens (greater than or equal to 1:10) (Fisher's Exact Test, P less than .05), while four seropositive patients with iridocorneal endothelial syndrome and one seropositive control had low to undetectable levels of antibodies to Epstein-Barr virus-associated nuclear antigen (less than or equal to 1:5) (P greater than .1). Antibody levels to cytomegalovirus or measles virus were not different between patients with iridocorneal endothelial syndrome and controls. Additional studies showed no evidence of humoral immune disorder or collagen vascular disease in the patients with iridocorneal endothelial syndrome. The serologic profiles suggest that the patients with iridocorneal endothelial syndrome examined had a cellular immune abnormality sufficient to permit reactivation of latent Epstein-Barr virus infection and imply, but do not establish, a role for Epstein-Barr virus infection in the pathogenesis of some cases of the iridocorneal endothelial syndrome. 
1	Evaluation of endosonography in TN staging of oesophageal cancer. Strategies for the treatment of cancer of the oesophagus depend on the tumour stage at the time of diagnosis. Resection, the only curative treatment, is confined to early tumour stages. Tumours with local infiltration are usually unresectable and require palliative treatment. Computed tomography has been widely used for preoperative staging but often fails to define this correctly. Endoscopic ultrasound allows direct visualisation of the parietal wall and may be useful in staging gastrointestinal tumours. In a comparative prospective study, 52 patients with tumours of the oesophagus were investigated preoperatively both by endoscopic ultrasound and computed tomography to determine the stage of tumour infiltration and local lymph node involvement. Thirty seven of these patients underwent operation, resection, or dissection and entered the study. The intraoperative findings or the histopathological assessment, or both, were taken as a reference. For all TN stages of oesophageal tumours, correct preoperative staging was accomplished by endoscopic ultrasound in 89% for T stage and 69% for N stage compared with 51% and 51% respectively by computed tomography (highly significant using Fisher's exact test). This study shows that endoscopic ultrasound is useful in preoperative TN staging of tumours of the oesophagus. 
5	Thromboxane receptor blockade prevents pulmonary hypertension induced by heparin-protamine reactions in awake sheep We used competitive thromboxane A2-prostaglandin endoperoxide receptor blockade (SQ 30,741) as a probe to evaluate the role of thromboxane in ovine pulmonary vasoconstriction associated with protamine reversal of heparin anticoagulation. Control heparin-protamine reactions induced rapid release of thromboxane into arterial plasma (more than 1 ng/ml plasma), a 2.5-fold increase of pulmonary artery pressure, a 20% decrease of PaO2, and a 30% reduction in arterial white blood cell concentration. After giving SQ 30,741 despite similar thromboxane release into arterial plasma after heparin-protamine challenge, acute pulmonary hypertension was significantly reduced when 94% of pulmonary vascular smooth muscle thromboxane receptors were occupied with SQ 30,741 (p less than 0.01 at 1 minute after protamine versus control heparin-protamine reaction) and was completely abolished by a 10 mg/kg i.v. bolus (p less than 0.0001 at 1 minute after protamine versus control). Peripheral leukopenia was not affected by SQ 30,741 prophylaxis, but hypoxemia was prevented. We conclude that thromboxane causes pulmonary vasoconstriction in ovine heparin-protamine-induced pulmonary hypertension. Pulmonary vasoconstriction and hypoxemia can be completely prevented by thromboxane receptor blockade. 
3	Acute and long-term changes in serum lipids after acute stroke. We studied serum lipid profiles in 171 patients less than or equal to 48 hours after the onset of acute stroke and 3 months later. The 83 patients suffering cerebral infarction had significantly higher serum concentrations of total cholesterol, low density lipoprotein-cholesterol, and apolipoprotein B and significantly lower serum concentrations of triglycerides and lipoprotein (a) less than or equal to 48 hours after ictus than 3 months later. The lipid profiles of the 53 patients suffering lacunar infarction were similar on both occasions, the only significant differences being higher total cholesterol and low density lipoprotein-cholesterol concentrations less than or equal to 48 hours after ictus. No significant changes were observed among the 35 patients suffering cerebral hemorrhage apart from a significantly higher concentration of high density lipoprotein3-cholesterol less than or equal to 48 hours after ictus. Our study, with many patients classified according to stroke subtype, gives results different from those of previous studies with much fewer patients. We conclude that in studies of serum lipid and lipoprotein concentrations as risk factors for cerebral infarction, comparing values obtained less than or equal to 48 hours after admission with control values may incorrectly identify certain lipid fractions as risk factors. 
5	Synovial membrane histology and immunopathology in rheumatoid arthritis and osteoarthritis. In vivo effects of antirheumatic drugs. We examined the histologic and immunopathologic features of the synovial membrane of 18 patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and 12 patients with osteoarthritis (OA) who had undergone total knee arthroplasty. Patients were classified into 5 groups according to therapeutic regimen and disease: RA treated with nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), RA treated with NSAIDs and prednisone, RA treated with NSAIDs and methotrexate (MTX), OA treated with analgesics, and OA treated with NSAIDs. There were no significant between-group differences in the percentages or the distribution pattern of the infiltrating T cell subsets (CD4, CD8), HLA-DR, or interleukin-2 receptor-bearing cells. However, inflammatory indices, which included the thickness of the lining cell layer and the density of the mononuclear cell infiltrate, were significantly higher in the RA patients treated with prednisone and those treated with MTX (P less than 0.05). Similarly, fibrosis was markedly reduced in these 2 groups. The RA patients treated with NSAIDs alone and the 2 groups of patients with OA demonstrated similar profiles. These data suggest that prednisone and MTX may inhibit the development of fibrosis without altering the subsets of the inflammatory cell population. This observation raises the possibility that the action of these 2 drugs may be partly mediated by the suppression of inflammatory mediators that are responsible for fibroblast activation. 
3	Clinical analyses and short-term prognoses of neonates with subependymal cysts. Twenty-one neonates with subependymal cysts detected by neurosonography soon after birth were prospectively examined. The clinical and cranial sonographic findings were evaluated with respect to short-term prognosis. The prognosis was poor in 6 patients with congenital viral infection (4 with cytomegalovirus infection and 2 with rubella infection). Five patients also had neurodevelopmental abnormalities (2 with neonatal epileptic seizures, 2 with chromosomal abnormalities, and 1 with lissencephaly). The remaining 10 patients had normal psychomotor development. The incidence of congenital viral infection was statistically correlated with a poor neurodevelopmental outcome. A correlation did not exist between the short-term prognosis and each of the other clinical factors or cranial sonographic findings. Our evidence suggests that further investigation of possible subependymal cyst etiologies is required during a careful, long-term follow-up period. 
5	Effects of prostaglandin I2, superoxide dismutase, and catalase on ischemia-reperfusion injury in liver transplantation. This study evaluated the effects of a prostaglandin I2 analogue (aPGI2), superoxide dismutase (SOD), and catalase (CAT) on hepatic injury after warm ischemia and reperfusion in terms of survival, mitochondrial function, serum enzymes, and histology. Hepatic ischemia was created in rats by clamping the hepatoduodenal ligament for 90 min with splenofemoral bypass. Reperfusion was induced by unclamping the vessels and disconnecting the splenofemoral bypass. Then aPGI2 (350 ng/kg/min) was infused for 60 min just before hepatic ischemia, and SOD and CAT (5,000 units/kg each) were administered immediately before the start of reperfusion. Serum enzyme and mitochondrial function assessments of livers were made just after ischemia, and after 2 hr of reperfusion. Survival rate was also assessed in a separate group of rats. Liver enzymes such as SGOT, SGPT, and LDH showed no correlation to liver viability. The administration of aPGI2 alone showed no effect on ischemically injured mitochondria; however, the free radical scavengers (SOD, CAT), in combination with aPGI2, showed significant improvement of mitochondrial function together with extension of survival. The ultrastructure of hepatocytes was better preserved in the treated groups. These agents improved the viability of ischemic-reperfused injured livers. 
1	The frequency of uterine leiomyomas. As a leading cause of hysterectomy in premenopausal women. uterine leiomyomas are a major public health problem. However, very little work has been done on their epidemiology. Indeed, their true frequency has never been established using systematic and meticulous methods. In this study, gross serial sectioning at 2-mm intervals was applied as an adjunct to routine pathology processing in 100 consecutive total hysterectomy specimens. This tripled the number of leiomyomas noted in routine pathology reports. There were 649 leiomyomas in 77 of 100 uteri, with multiplicity of leiomyomas in 84%. Although leiomyomas were more numerous and larger in women with a clinical diagnosis of myomatous uterus, the incidence was no higher than in uteri removed for other reasons. The postmenopausal incidence of leiomyomas was no lower than the premenopausal incidence, although postmenopausal leiomyomas were smaller and fewer. These findings suggest that epidemiologic studies of leiomyomas may not be valid if they are based only on clinical diagnoses or routine pathology reports. 
4	Endovascular management of arterial intimal defects: an experimental comparison by arteriography, angioscopy, and intravascular ultrasonography. To determine the feasibility of the endovascular management of intimal defects while comparing the accuracy of arteriography with angioscopy and intravascular ultrasonography, we developed an in vivo model of arterial intimal flaps. In 10 superficial femoral arteries of five anesthetized mongrel dogs, intimal flaps were constructed and then imaged by arteriography, angioscopy, and intravascular ultrasound. A flexible microbiopsy forceps was used to remove each intimal flap under angioscopic guidance. Arteriographic lumen diameters were measured and cross-sectional areas calculated. Corresponding measurements by angioscopy and intravascular ultrasound with reduction in luminal area at the flap were obtained by use of computerized planimetry. Uniplanar arteriography identified 60% (6/10) of the intimal flaps, whereas angioscopy and intravascular ultrasound demonstrated 100%. Lumen diameter (in millimeters) measured by arteriography (3.4 +/- 0.6) correlated significantly with measurements by angioscopy (3.5 +/- 0.5, r = 0.77) and intravascular ultrasound (3.5 +/- 0.6, r = 0.96). Similarly, lumen area (square millimeters) by arteriography (9.2 +/- 2.9) correlated with measurements by angioscopy (8.9 +/- 2.2, r = 0.82) and intravascular ultrasound (8.6 +/- 2.7, r = 0.91). Reduction in lumen area by the flap by angioscopy (37 +/- 7%) and intravascular ultrasound (33 +/- 8%) also correlated significantly (r = 0.72). The intimal flaps were removed successfully in all 10 arteries as confirmed by arteriography, angioscopy, and intravascular ultrasound. We conclude that the endovascular management of intimal defects is possible. Additionally, angioscopy and intravascular ultrasound accurately evaluate lumen diameter and area while providing direct assessment of intimal defects. 
4	How ancient is temporal arteritis? Realism is one of the characteristics of Amarnian art; some details of The Harpist represented in the tomb of Pa-Aton-Em-Heb (1350 BC, 18th Dynasty) might gives clues to a diagnosis: the eyes are closed with swollen lids, and the harpist appears to stare into space; he is round shouldered with a very wasted face, his temporal ara is heightened and hollowed by a broken line joining the extremity of the eyebrow with the corner of the eye. These details are not found elsewhere. Did the harpist's blindness result from temporal arteritis associated to polymyalgia rheumatica?. 
1	Genotypic analyses of Richter's syndrome. The authors report the immunogenotype of two cases of Richter's syndrome. The immunoglobulin gene rearrangement pattern obtained on Southern Blot analysis was found in both cases to be the same in leukemic blood cells and in the tissue involved by the lymphoma. The beta chain and gamma chain T-cell receptor gene rearrangement pattern exhibited a germ-line configuration in the peripheral blood cells and in the lymph node in Case 2, whereas in Case 1 the lymph node had a gene rearrangement in the beta chain, as well as in the gamma chain T-cell receptor, and the leukemic cells from bone marrow were found to be in a germ-line configuration for T-cell receptors (beta and gamma chains). 
1	Anesthesia for craniotomy: a double-blind comparison of alfentanil, fentanyl, and sufentanil. Using a prospective, randomized, and double-blind study design, alfentanil (n = 15), fentanyl (n = 14), or sufentanil (n = 16), in combination with N2O, were administered to patients undergoing craniotomy for supratentorial tumor resection. Physicians were given two syringes, one of which was labeled as "load" for the initial loading dose and the other as "maintenance" for continuous infusion. The concentration of drug in each syringe was adjusted to permit administration on a milliliter per kilogram basis. The target loading doses for alfentanil, fentanyl, and sufentanil were 75, 10, and 1 microgram/kg, respectively, and initial infusion rates were 33.5, 2.0, and 0.3 microgram.kg-1.h-1, respectively. Additional supplementary boluses and changes in maintenance infusion rate were made according to predetermined guidelines. Isoflurane, in increasing 0.2% inspired increments, was used only when the maximum allowed opioid dose had been given (i.e., supplementary bolus doses equal to 75% of the calculated loading dose or supplementary bolus doses equal to 50% of the calculated loading dose combined with a 50% increase in the maintenance infusion rate). Opioid infusions were stopped at the time of bone flap replacement. Antihypertensive medications and naloxone were subsequently given at the discretion of the anesthesiologist. Group demographics were not different. Total volumes of drug were similar among groups indicating equipotent preparations. Administration of isoflurane, antihypertensive medications, and naloxone were not different among groups. Although decreases in blood pressure seen with induction were similar among groups, alfentanil-treated patients received ephedrine more frequently before intubation. Thirty minutes after entry into the postanesthesia recovery area, respiratory rate and pH were lowest in sufentanil-treated patients. 
1	Influence of organ environment on extracellular matrix degradative activity and metastasis of human colon carcinoma cells Orthotopic implantation of human colon carcinoma cells is useful for studying the behavior of metastatic subpopulations. We observed that the parental line and variants of human colon carcinoma KM12 cells were all tumorigenic following implantation into the subcutis or cecal wall of BALB/c nude mice. Their ability to metastasize to distant organ sites varied, however, with the site of growth. Subcutaneous (SC) tumors did not produce visceral metastases, whereas cecal tumors metastasized to the regional mesenteric lymph nodes and to the liver. To examine the influence of organ environment on the extracellular matrix-degrading activity of the tumors, we inoculated human colon carcinoma cells into the subcutis or cecal wall and after 7 weeks isolated and cultured the tumors in serum-free medium. The conditioned media of SC tumors contained very low levels of type IV collagenase (gelatinase) and heparanase (heparan sulfate-specific endo-beta-D-glucuronidase), whereas the media of the cecal wall tumors contained high levels of both. Zymograms of the media revealed that the intracecal human colon carcinomas secreted more than three times the amount of latent and active forms of 92-kd type IV collagenase than did the SC tumors. Moreover, only the conditioned media of intracecal tumors contained latent and active forms of 64-kd type IV collagenase. Histochemical analysis using rabbit antiserum raised against the synthetic peptides of 72-kd procollagenase type IV showed type IV collagenase in the intracecal tumors; human colon carcinoma growing SC, however, were not stained significantly. These results suggest that factors in the organ environment may affect production and secretion of tumor extracellular matrix-degrading enzymes, and these factors may modify the metastatic behavior of human colon carcinoma cells in nude mice. 
1	The role of adrenalectomy in Cushing's syndrome. Forty-four patients with Cushing's syndrome were treated by adrenalectomy between 1975 and 1989. Twenty patients had adrenal adenomas: 13 with obvious Cushing's syndrome and 7 whose disease was subclinical, detected after evaluation of an incidentally discovered adrenal mass (es). Twelve patients underwent bilateral adrenalectomies for Cushing's disease after failed transsphenoidal explorations and pituitary irradiation. Six patients had primary adrenal hyperplasia, five as manifestations of Carney's complex. Two others underwent bilateral adrenalectomies for ectopic adrenocorticotropic hormone from carcinoid tumors. Four patients had adrenocortical carcinoma treated with transabdominal adrenalectomy. Three are alive from 8 years to 5 months. There was one postoperative death (2.3%) caused by coagulopathy and multiple organ failure and three (7%) minor postoperative complications. Follow-up showed good to excellent results in 95% of patients. It is concluded that adrenalectomy provides prompt relief from the severe morbidity of Cushing's syndrome regardless of the cause. It is the treatment of choice for adrenal adenomas, carcinomas, primary hyperplasia, and selected patients with Cushing's disease. 
5	An unusual complication of silastic dural substitute: case report. A case is presented in which a patient developed an unusual complication after the use of Silastic dural substitute. In 1983, the patient underwent removal of a meningioma with the involved dura. Five years later, he developed around the graft material a very thick connective tissue capsule, which simulated a recurrent meningioma clinically and radiologically. 
2	Severe thrombocytopenia after paracetamol overdose. Two patients with severe thrombocytopenia after paracetamol overdose are described. The platelet count was lowest two days after the overdose. Neither leucopenia nor anaemia occurred. 
5	Single polypoid cystitis cystica and glandularis presenting as benign bladder tumor. A case report of a ten-year-old boy with a benign polypoid bladder tumor is presented. The rarity of benign or malignant bladder tumors in children is reviewed, as well as the possible etiology of this unique lesion. 
5	Single versus double indicator dilution measurements of extravascular lung water. OBJECTIVE: To compare a simplified method of measuring extravascular lung water (EVLW) using only a single indicator (EVLW-SI) with the standard double indicator dilution technique (EVLW-DI). DESIGN: Direct comparison of EVLW-SI with EVLW-DI in 18 critically ill patients. SETTING: A general medical ICU in a university-affiliated hospital. PATIENTS: Nine men and nine women, ages 19 to 80 yr. Six patients were in shock (four from septic shock), and 11 were in respiratory failure. INTERVENTIONS: EVLW-DI and cardiac output were measured in triplicate during injection of cold indocyanine green dye. Cardiac output was calculated both from pulmonary artery (COpa) and femoral artery (COfem-di) thermal dilution signals. EVLW-SI and COfem-si were also measured during three additional injections of cold saline using only thermal signals from the pulmonary and femoral arteries. Order of measurements was random. EVLW-SI was measured in ten patients while blood was withdrawn through the femoral catheter and in ten patients without blood drawn through the femoral catheter. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: A total of 84 comparisons were made. Although the overall correlations were good (r2 = .86), EVLW-SI systematically overestimated EVLW-DI (p less than .05). This difference was greater when EVLW-SI was measured without blood withdrawal through the femoral catheter. In this subgroup, mean values for EVLW by the two methods were within 20% of one another in only two of ten patients, in contrast to the results in six of eight patients in which blood was withdrawn through the catheter. COfem-si and COfem-di also overestimated COpa. CONCLUSIONS: Theoretically, neither injection of green dye nor blood withdrawal should be necessary during measurements of EVLW-SI, making it a simpler technique for bedside use than EVLW-DI. However, significant discrepancies exist between the two techniques. Some of this difference is apparently due to technical factors related to catheter design. In any case, we cannot recommend use of the single indicator dilution technique at present to estimate EVLW. 
5	Delayed, exsanguinating pelvic hemorrhage after blunt trauma without bony fracture: case report. We present a case of a young man who developed a delayed, life-threatening hemorrhage after blunt pelvic trauma. He did not have a bony fracture. Successful management of the hemorrhage with angiographic embolization and the complex subsequent course are discussed. 
3	Neuromuscular function in polio survivors at one-year follow-up [published erratum appears in Arch Phys Med Rehabil 1991 Mar;72(3):213] Many polio survivors complain of progressive loss of strength, work capacity, endurance, and ability to recover from fatiguing activity. These variables were measured initially and one year later in the quadriceps muscles of 28 symptomatic and 16 asymptomatic persons who had polio and 38 control individuals. Peak knee extension torque was measured isokinetically and isometrically. Endurance, or the amount of time the subject could maintain isometric torque at 40% of maximal torque, was measured. Work capacity was determined as the product of isometric torque and endurance time. Recovery of strength was measured at regular intervals for ten minutes after the endurance test. Statistical analysis was done by repeated measures ANOVA. Although the initial measures showed significant deficits in mean peak torque, work capacity, and recovery of strength in symptomatic postpolio subjects, no significant changes were found one year later in any of the variables. We conclude that symptomatic postpolio subjects do not lose significant neuromuscular function in one year. 
4	Physical activity, opportunity for reinfection, and sibling history of heart disease as risk factors for Chagas' cardiopathy. A case-control study was conducted to examine whether physical activity, sibling history of heart disease (HHD), and length of residence in an area endemic for Chagas' disease were associated with the risk of developing Chagas' cardiopathy. Two hundred forty-seven cases of Chagas' heart disease and 345 seropositive subjects with normal ECG (controls) were selected in a population survey in Goiania, Brazil. Prevalence ratios for exposure variables were estimated for cases in relation to controls and for subgroups of seropositives with selected ECG abnormalities in relation to controls. Increasing age and male sex were consistently and significantly related to an increased risk of ECG abnormalities. HHD was significantly associated with ECG alterations in 3 of the 5 comparison subgroups (any ECG alteration, right bundle branch block, and left anterior hemiblock). No association was found between length of residence in an area endemic, physical activity, and ECG abnormalities. A sample of 529 seronegative subjects were also examined and the interaction between exposure variables and seropositivity was tested to assess whether the associations found were specific for seropositives. Males were at greater risk of any ECG alteration and left anterior hemiblock in relation to females if they were seropositive. An increasing risk of ventricular premature beats with age was clearer for seropositive than for seronegative subjects. Subjects with HHD were at an increased risk of ECG abnormalities and this was greater in those with a positive serological test (P less than 0.05). The findings suggest a possible geographical clustering or a familial aggregation of cases of Chagas' heart disease. 
5	Constipation: pathophysiology and treatment. Although many physicians consider constipation a trivial problem, it is one of the most frequent and chronic digestive disorders in the United States, affecting 4.53 million people and causing considerable morbidity. More than $200 million are spent for over-the-counter laxatives and untold millions of dollars are spent for prescription drugs and other medical services to manage this disorder. Successful management requires an appreciation of the magnitude of the problem, an understanding of colorectal function and a clear assessment of the causes. Careful examination of the patient's anorectal anatomy and improvement in the patient's dietary habits are the first steps in management. Therapeutic options include behavioral modification strategies, diet and lifestyle changes, pharmacologic therapy and, rarely, surgical intervention. 
2	Do life events or depression exacerbate inflammatory bowel disease? A prospective study. OBJECTIVE: To determine whether depressed mood or life events are associated with an exacerbation of inflammatory bowel disease. DESIGN: A prospective study of a consecutive sample of patients with relapsing inflammatory bowel disease, followed by monthly questionnaires and periodic office visits. SETTING: A referral-based gastroenterology clinic at a medical school. PATIENTS: A consecutive sample of 32 patients with inflammatory bowel disease who had had at least one relapse in a 2-year period after entry into the study. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: The Social Readjustment Rating Scale (measuring life events), the Beck Depression Inventory (a visual analog scale for depressed mood) and an inventory of intestinal symptoms were completed monthly by each subject with a 78% rate of compliance. A mean of 2.2 exacerbations was seen per subject during the study period. Life events were not temporally associated with changes in intestinal symptoms. Significant associations were found between intestinal symptoms and the two mood scales (P less than 0.05 for each), but no directionality in symptom occurrence could be detected in a time-lagged analysis. The results were similar when the months preceding exacerbations of inflammatory bowel disease were analyzed separately. CONCLUSIONS: Although these findings suggest that mood changed concurrently with exacerbation of inflammatory bowel disease, no evidence indicated that stressful life events or depressed mood precipitated exacerbations in this study group. 
1	Does increased detection account for the rising incidence of breast cancer? BACKGROUND: The incidence of breast cancer has been increasing over time in the United States. METHODS: To determine the role of screening in this increase, trends in the incidence of in situ and invasive carcinoma of the breast were evaluated using records of the metropolitan Atlanta SEER program between 1979 and 1986. From a sample of records, evidence of symptoms and mammographic screening prior to diagnosis was recorded. RESULTS: The average annual age-adjusted incidence of invasive disease rose 29 percent among Whites and 41 percent among Blacks. Incidence increased in all age groups. A trend towards earlier detection of invasive disease was found. Asymptomatic tumors accounted for only 40 percent of the increased incidence among whites and 25 percent of the increased incidence among blacks, with mammography as the principal contributing procedure. CONCLUSIONS: These data suggest that increased detection accounts for some but not all of the rising incidence of breast cancer in the United States. 
5	Bone mineral loss in young women with amenorrhoea. OBJECTIVE--To examine the impact of amenorrhoea on bone mineral density in women of reproductive age. DESIGN--Cross sectional study of 200 amenorrhoeic women compared with normally menstruating controls. SETTING--Teaching hospital outpatient clinic specialising in reproductive medicine. SUBJECTS--200 Women aged 16-40 with a past or current history of amenorrhoea from various causes and of a median duration of three years, and a control group of 57 age matched normal volunteers with no history of menstrual disorder. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE--Bone mineral density in the lumbar spine (L1-L4) as measured by dual energy x ray absorptiometry. RESULTS--The amenorrhoeic group showed a mean reduction in bone mineral density of 15% (95% confidence interval 12% to 18%) as compared with controls (mean bone mineral density 0.89 (SD 0.12) g/cm2 v 1.05 (0.09) g/cm2 in controls). Bone loss was related to the duration of amenorrhoea and the severity of oestrogen deficiency rather than to the underlying diagnosis. Patients with a history of fracture had significantly lower bone density than those without a history of fracture. Ten patients had suffered an apparently atraumatic fracture. CONCLUSIONS--Amenorrhoea in young women should be investigated and treated to prevent bone mineral loss. Menopausal women with a past history of amenorrhoea should be considered to be at high risk of osteoporosis. 
4	Regulation of fibrillar collagen types I and III and basement membrane type IV collagen gene expression in pressure overloaded rat myocardium. Left ventricular hypertrophy is based on cardiac myocyte growth. The hypertrophic process can be considered heterogeneous based on whether it also includes a remodeling and accumulation of fibrillar types I and III collagens that are responsible for impaired myocardial stiffness. In the heart, the messenger RNA (mRNA) for fibrillar collagen types I and III has been detected only in cardiac fibroblasts, whereas mRNA for basement membrane collagen type IV is present in both fibroblasts and myocytes. We studied the early and long-term expression of these collagenous proteins in rat myocardium after abdominal aortic banding with renal ischemia. Complementary DNA probes for rat pro-alpha 2 (I), mouse type III and mouse type IV collagens, and chicken beta-actin were used. Northern and dot blot analysis on total RNA extracted from left ventricular tissue indicated a sixfold increase in steady-state levels of mRNA for collagen type I on day 3 of abdominal aortic banding, which had declined to control levels by day 7 where it remained rather constant at 4 and 8 weeks. Type III collagen showed a similar pattern of gene expression after banding. mRNA levels for type IV collagen, on the other hand, were elevated on day 1 after banding, returning to control at day 7 and remaining constant. Actin mRNA levels also increased on day 1 of banding, followed by a rapid return to control levels. Monospecific antibody to types I and III collagens and immunofluorescent light microscopy on frozen sections of the myocardium revealed that at 1 week after banding, the distribution and density of these collagens were similar to those of control animals. 
3	Threat of unemployment and cardiovascular risk factors: longitudinal study of quality of sleep and serum cholesterol concentrations in men threatened with redundancy. OBJECTIVE--To assess whether the threat of unemployment affects risk factors for cardiovascular disease. DESIGN--Longitudinal study of a cohort of middle aged shipyard workers followed up for a mean of 6.2 (SD 1.9) years and a group of controls observed for the same period. The first investigation took place during a period of relative economic stability for the shipyard and the second during the phase of its closure. SETTING--An age cohort health screening programme in Malmo, Sweden. PARTICIPANTS--715 Male shipyard workers and 261 age matched male controls. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES--Changes in 19 variables related to the risk of cardiovascular disease, and psychological variables, alcohol consumption, smoking, and dietary habits as assessed by questionnaire. RESULTS--Serum cholesterol concentrations increased more (mean 0.25 (SD 0.68) mmol/l v 0.08 (0.66) mmol/l) and serum calcium concentrations decreased less (-0.06 (0.10) mmol/l v -0.08 (0.09) mmol/l) in the shipyard workers than in the controls. A correlation was found between scores for sleep disturbance and changes in serum cholesterol concentration. In the whole series there was a greater increase in serum cholesterol concentrations among men threatened with unemployment (437/976; 44.8%) than among those who were not. In stepwise regression analysis the change in serum cholesterol concentration was correlated with changes in haemoglobin concentration, body weight, and serum triglyceride and calcium concentrations. A positive correlation was found between change in cholesterol concentration and change in blood pressure, indicating that the overall risk profile had worsened among men with increased serum cholesterol concentrations. CONCLUSIONS--Risk of unemployment increases the serum cholesterol concentration in middle aged men, the increase being more pronounced in those with sleep disturbance. The increase in serum cholesterol is related to changes in other established risk factors for cardiovascular disease. These findings might partly explain the excessive mortality due to cardiovascular disease recorded among the unemployed and people with sleep disturbance. 
5	Morphological and biochemical changes in gastric mucosa of aging rats. Although previous data from this laboratory have indicated that aging is associated with increased gastric mucosal proliferative activity, no direct assessment of proliferative potential of the tissue has been made during aging. In order to assess this, and to determine whether changes in mucosal proliferative potential would be reflected in growth of the tissue, we have examined the labeling index (LI), height and morphology of the gastric mucosa in young (4-month-old) and aged (24-month-old) Fischer-344 rats. In addition, tyrosine kinase (Tyr-k) activity and the levels of phosphotyrosine proteins were determined to evaluate their relationship to mucosal proliferative activity. Histologic evaluation revealed a marked atrophy of the mucosal glandular component with 32% reduction in height in aged rats when compared with young animals. In aged rats, there was also a decrease in gland density, resulting in a reduction in the number of epithelial cells of all types with evidence of decreased secretory activity. Despite the occurrence of mucosal atrophy in aged rats, LI in these animals was significantly increased by 28%. This was associated with a parallel rise in mucosal Tyr-k activity, and a two- to threefold increase in the relative concentrations of seven phosphotyrosine membrane proteins with Mr of 120, 105, 90, 60, 55, 48 and 32 kDa. We conclude that (1) although aging is associated with increased gastric mucosal proliferative activity, this does not result in mucosal growth and that (2) Tyr-k and tyrosine phosphorylation of certain proteins play a role in the regulation of gastric mucosal cell proliferation during aging. 
2	Blood transfusion and recurrence of colorectal cancer: the role of platelet derived growth factors. Efforts to explain the possible effects of blood transfusion on the recurrence of colorectal cancer have been based entirely on the immunosuppressive effects of blood transfusion. However, the relationship between solid tumour development and the immune system is inconclusive. We have investigated an alternative mechanism involving the potential role of growth factors in this phenomenon. Using a human fibroblast: [125I]deoxyuridine uptake mitogenesis assay, the relative amounts of growth factor in the plasma of stored blood were measured. There was a progressive increase in mitogenesis from day 0 (n = 6) to day 28 (n = 6; P less than 0.001, Mann-Whitney U test). The effect of growth factors on the development of liver and intraperitoneal metastases was studied in Hooded Lister rats. Following an intraportal injection of 10(5) MC28 tumour cells, the experimental group (n = 25) received 2 ml of syngeneic serum intravenously for 4 days. Likewise, colonic anastomoses were performed on omentectomized rats and the peritoneal cavity seeded with 10(3) cells. The experimental groups (n = 20) received either 2 ml serum intravenously repeatedly or 3 ml serum intraperitoneally (n = 19). There was no significant increase in liver metastases or peritoneal disease following intravenous infusion of serum but serum delivered intraperitoneally resulted in a significant increase in tumour from 22 per cent in the controls to 89 per cent in the study group (P less than 0.01). Growth factors released from platelets following blood loss into the peritoneal cavity may be important in enhancing local recurrence of colorectal cancer. 
1	Enhanced modulation of antibodies coating guinea pig leukemic cells in vitro and in vivo. The role of Fc gamma R expressing cells. We have investigated the antigenic modulation induced by a number of antibody fragments and derivatives directed against the idiotype of the surface Ig of the L2C guinea pig B lymphoblastic leukemia, and studied the effects upon such modulation of the simultaneous presence of cells expressing Fc gamma receptors (FcR). In vitro studies confirmed previous work showing that antibody bivalency is required to induce modulation in vitro in simple systems. However, in the presence of isolated Kupffer cells, Fc-containing univalent antibodies were found to induce significant antigenic modulation, and the modulation induced by intact IgG was also found to be more rapid and extensive. Fragments that did not contain Fc regions behaved similarly in the presence or absence of Kupffer cells. Further investigations demonstrated that all three classes of human FcR can mediate modulation enhancement, and suggest that the mechanism involves indirect cross-linking of cell surface Ag via the antibody and effector cell FcR. In vivo studies showed that univalent antibody derivatives containing Fc regions did induce antigenic modulation, but that this was significantly reduced in comparison with bivalent antibodies, confirming their potential advantage for immunotherapy. 
1	Basement membrane of cervical adenocarcinoma: an immunoperoxidase study of laminin and type IV collagen. The basement membrane components type IV collagen and laminin were examined immunohistochemically in 14 cases of adenocarcinoma of the cervix. The patterns of staining in adenocarcinoma in situ, invasive adenocarcinoma, and early invasive adenocarcinoma were compared to see whether characteristic patterns could be delineated. Adenocarcinoma in situ had a uniform intact basement membrane, whereas the basement membrane of invasive adenocarcinoma was fragmented and irregular. Cases of early stromal invasion showed early gland buds and outpouchings with defective basement membrane staining. The degree of histologic differentiation of the tumor was not clearly related to the amount of basement membrane component staining. The concept of early stromal invasion in cervical adenocarcinoma, as supported by our immunohistochemical studies, is discussed as it relates to a possible pathogenic mechanism in early invasion and infiltration of adenocarcinoma of the cervix. 
1	Decreased expression of integrin adhesive protein receptors in adenocarcinoma of the breast. The integrin superfamily represents a major class of receptors mediating cell-substrate adhesion. Our recent study of the tissue distribution of the alpha 2 beta 1 integrin, a cell-surface collagen receptor, revealed that high levels of receptor expression were associated with orderly, regulated epithelial cell proliferation. Those observations prompted the present investigation of alpha 2 beta 1 and other integrins in adenocarcinoma of the breast. The alpha 2 beta 1 integrin was highly expressed on the epithelium of the ducts and ductules of normal breast tissue. Normal or nearly normal levels of the receptor were expressed in fibroadenomas. In contrast, markedly decreased or undetectable alpha 2 beta 1 expression was typical of poorly differentiated adenocarcinomas. Well-differentiated lesions exhibited intermediate levels of expression. Similar, but less extensive, decreases in expression were observed for the alpha 5 beta 1 (fibronectin receptor) and alpha v beta 3 (vitronectin receptor). Significant expression of the beta 1 subunit on even poorly differentiated tumors suggests that the expression of other undefined members of the beta 1 family is not reduced to the same low level as alpha 2 beta 1 and alpha 5 beta 1. Expression of the alpha 2 beta 1 integrin was highly correlated with estrogen-receptor expression. Decreased expression of alpha 2 beta 1 and other integrin adhesive protein receptors probably contributes to the altered adhesive properties of tumor cells characteristic of the malignant phenotype. 
1	Normal and leukemic hematopoietic cells manifest differential sensitivity to inhibitory effects of c-myb antisense oligodeoxynucleotides: an in vitro study relevant to bone marrow purging. The c-myb protooncogene is preferentially expressed in hematopoietic cells, and its encoded protein, Myb, is required for hematopoietic cell proliferation. To analyze the relative Myb dependence of normal and leukemic human hematopoietic progenitor cells, normal bone marrow cells, several types of leukemic blast cells, and 1:1 mixtures of normal and leukemic cells were cultured in the presence of c-myb sense or antisense oligodeoxynucleotides; cell viability and cloning efficiency were then assessed. c-myb sense oligomers had negligible effects on normal and leukemic cells. In contrast, c-myb antisense oligomers strongly inhibited or completely abolished clonogenic growth of a T-cell leukemia line, 78% (18 of 23) of primary acute myelogenous leukemia cases examined, and 4 of 5 primary chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) cases in blast crisis. In three of the latter patients, polymerase chain reaction analysis of a 1:1 mixture of c-myb antisense-treated normal and CML cells revealed a complete absence of bcr-abl expression, suggesting that the CML clonogenic units had been completely eliminated from the cultures. At antisense doses that inhibited leukemic cell growth, normal hematopoietic progenitor cells survived. Thus, normal and leukemic hematopoietic cells show differential sensitivity to the toxic effects of c-myb antisense DNA. Perturbation of c-myb function with antisense oligodeoxynucleotides might eventually form the basis for a molecular approach to leukemia therapy, perhaps most immediately as ex vivo bone marrow purging agents. 
5	Drug fever. Remember to consider it in diagnosis. Drug fever should be considered in the differential diagnosis of any patient with unexplained fever. Clues in the history, physical examination, and laboratory assessment can point to the diagnosis before extensive, costly, and potentially harmful investigations and therapies are begun. 
4	Cutaneous vasculitis associated with pheochromocytoma. We describe a patient who presented with constitutional symptoms, severe hypertension, and purpuric lesions over the knees, thighs, and penis. The patient was eventually diagnosed as having multiple endocrine neoplasia type II, with cutaneous leukocytoclastic vasculitis. The cutaneous vasculitis persisted despite treatment with high-dose systemic corticosteroids, but rapidly resolved after the removal of bilateral pheochromocytomas. This case demonstrates cutaneous leukocytoclastic vasculitis in association with pheochromocytoma. 
5	The neural substrate of memory impairment demonstrated by the intracarotid amobarbital procedure. The intracarotid amobarbital sodium (Amytal) procedure (IAP) was performed for 46 patients with temporal lobe epilepsy (21 with left seizure foci; 25 with right seizure foci). After anteromedial temporal lobectomy, neuronal densities were established for hippocampal subfields CA1, CA2, and CA3; the hilum; and the dentate granule cell layer. Intracarotid amobarbital procedure memory results were related to CA3 neuronal loss only. Patients who did not demonstrate memory after injection contralateral to the seizure focus had significantly fewer cells in CA3 than patients who did. Additionally, a significant correlation was observed between the intracarotid amobarbital procedure memory examination raw score after injection contralateral to the seizure focus and CA3 cell density. Using chi 2 analysis, significant differences were documented in the frequency with which memory was demonstrated after injection contralateral to the seizure focus for groups of patients classified by degree of CA3 neuronal loss. This finding supports prior research showing subfield specificity in some memory processes. 
1	Misdiagnosis of the Zollinger-Ellison syndrome due to hyperlipidemia. Most authorities feel that diagnosis of the Zollinger-Ellison syndrome is established when the serum gastrin level is greater than 1000 pg/mL (1000 ng/L) in a patient with gastric acid hypersecretion and clinical manifestations consistent with the diagnosis. A patient with recurrent peptic ulcer disease is reported who was thought to have had the Zollinger-Ellison syndrome based on two serum gastrin level measurements greater than 1000 pg/mL (1000 ng/L). Subsequent evaluation revealed the gastrin elevation to be spurious because the sample was hyperlipidemic. Lipemic serum samples may yield falsely elevated serum gastrin determinations as determined by radioimmunoassay. 
3	Abnormal pattern detected in fragile-X patients by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis. The fragile-X syndrome is the most frequent inherited form of mental retardation, with an incidence of 1 in 1,500 males. It is characterized by the presence of a fragile site at Xq27.3 induced in vitro by folate deprivation or by inhibitors of deoxynucleotide synthesis. Its mode of inheritance is unusual for an X-linked trait, with incomplete penetrance in both males and females. Some phenotypically normal males transmit the mutation to all their daughters who rarely express any symptoms, but penetrance is high in sons and daughters of these carrier women. Genetic and physical mapping of the Xq27-q28 region has confirmed that the disease locus is located at or very near the fragile site. Hypotheses proposed to account for the abnormalities in the inheritance of the disease include sequence rearrangements by meiotic recombination or a mutation that affects reactivation of an inactive X chromosome during differentiation of female germ cells. To detect such rearrangements, or methylation changes that may reflect a locally inactive X chromosome, we used pulsed-field gel analysis of DNA from fragile-X patients with probes close to the fragile-X locus. The probe Do33 (DXS465) detected abnormal patterns in fragile-X patients, but not in normal controls or in non-expressing male transmitters. 
5	A simple stress test for the evaluation of hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis during the first 6 months of life. In 33 normal infants, divided into 3 age groups (less than 1 month, 1-3 months, and 3-6 months) plasma cortisol was measured at 2230, 2300, and 2330 h. Baseline plasma cortisol at 2230 h. was, as expected, low in all infants, with mean +/- SEM values of 41 +/- 5, 72 +/- 14, and 97 +/- 17 nmol/L in each group, respectively. Thirty and 60 min after the painful stimulus of the venipuncture, plasma cortisol increased significantly (P less than 0.0005), reaching a maximum increase up to 458 +/- 50, 392 +/- 66, and 455 +/- 97 nmol/L in each age group, respectively. We conclude that in these infants the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis was functionally intact and responded to the painful stimulus of the venipuncture by a significant increase in plasma cortisol. This test may be used as a simple procedure for the evaluation of the integrity of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis without the administration of pharmacological agents. Its usefulness, however, should be validated with patients having a disorder of the system. 
2	Injection or heat probe for bleeding ulcer. A prospective randomized trial was performed to compare the efficacy of endoscopic epinephrine injection and heat probe treatment in actively bleeding peptic ulcers. Emergency endoscopy in 1758 patients over an 18-month period identified 132 patients with active ulcer bleeding. They were randomized to receive either endoscopic epinephrine injection or heat probe treatment. After endoscopy, the patients were transferred to the surgical gastroenterology ward and were managed by surgeons unaware of the treatment option. Bleeding was initially controlled in 96% by epinephrine injection and in 83% by heat probe (P less than 0.05). There was no significant difference in outcome as measured by transfusion requirement (4.5 units vs. 3.8 units), emergency surgery (20% vs. 22%), hospital stay (8 days vs. 7 days), and mortality (2 vs. 4) between the injection group and the heat probe group. Two patients in the heat probe group experienced perforation. We conclude that both endoscopic epinephrine injection and heat probe treatment are effective in stopping bleeding from actively bleeding ulcers. Epinephrine injection is technically easier to perform and has a higher initial success rate. 
5	A bradykinin antagonist modifies allergen-induced mediator release and late bronchial responses in sheep. We assessed the role of bradykinin (BK) in allergen-induced early and late bronchial responses, airway inflammation, mediator release, and antigen-induced airway hyperresponsiveness in allergic sheep by studying the effects of the BK B2 receptor antagonist, NPC-567 (D-Arg-[Hyp3, D-Phe7]-BK), on these parameters. Antigen challenge was performed on two occasions greater than 3 wk apart, once with placebo (control) and once after high-dose (10 mg/ml) and low-dose (5 mg/ml) treatments with aerosol NPC-567. In the control trials (n = 14) antigen challenge resulted in an early and late increase in specific lung resistance (SRL). The early response was associated with increases (p less than 0.05) in prostaglandin (PG) D2, immunoreactive kinin, tosyl-L-arginine methyl ester (TAME)-esterase, and PGE2 in bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid. The late response was associated with increases (p less than 0.05) in leukotrienes (LT) B4 and C4, thromboxane (TX) B2, 6-keto-PGF10, and PGE2. There was a significant influx of neutrophils in the BAL fluid during the late response, and airway hyperresponsiveness to carbachol aerosol was apparent 4 h after challenge. In six sheep the high-dose NPC-567 treatment (given before, during, and 4 h after antigen challenge) did not attenuate the early bronchoconstrictor response or the early release of mediators but caused a significant reduction in the late response (p less than 0.05). This protective effect was accompanied by reductions (p less than 0.05) in both the concentrations of all the mediators associated with the late response and the severity of the BAL neutrophilia. High-dose NPC-567 did not attenuate the airway hyperresponsiveness or the cellular inflammatory response seen 24 h after challenge. In eight sheep treated with the low dose of NPC-567 (given before, during, and 4, 8, and 24 h after challenge) the early response was not blocked but the late response was again inhibited, as were the mediators associated with the late response. At the low dose the drug did not prevent the airway inflammation at 8 or 24 h. The additional treatments did, however, prevent the 24 h hyperresponsiveness. These data suggest that kinin generation during antigen-induced airway anaphylaxis may be important for controlling the release of arachidonic acid metabolites from airway inflammatory cells that contribute to the development of the late response in the allergic sheep model. 
3	Pupil-sparing oculomotor nerve palsy due to midbrain infarction. Vasculopathic oculomotor nerve palsies with pupillary sparing are thought to be due to ischemic damage to the nerve in the subarachnoid space or the cavernous sinus. We present two cases of patients with isolated pupil-sparing oculomotor nerve palsies due to midbrain infarcts. Focal ischemic midbrain lesions should be considered in cases of pupil-sparing oculomotor nerve palsies. 
5	The role of gastric resection in the management of multicentric argyrophil gastric carcinoids. A patient with pernicious anemia, atrophic non-antral gastritis, hypergastrinemia, and widespread hyperplasia of enterochromaffin-like cells and manifest enterochromaffin-like cell carcinoma was followed up during 39 months, including 15 months after gastric resection. In this case normalization of gastrin levels did not prevent the development of multiple gastric carcinoids in the fundic mucosa, suggesting that factors other than gastrin are of importance in the pathogenesis. 
1	Microdochectomy for discharge from a single lactiferous duct. Microdochectomy for persistent discharge from a single lactiferous duct was performed in 162 women. Invasive or in situ ductal carcinoma was diagnosed in 16 patients (10 per cent), none of whom had a palpable lump. The discharge was blood-stained in 14 of these women and in two it was clear. Mammography was performed in 15 of these 16 patients and was abnormal in only five. Three patients had atypical ductal hyperplasia, one of whom subsequently developed an invasive ductal carcinoma. Microdochectomy for persistent discharge from a single lactiferous duct is curative and gives a diagnosis of the cause. It remains the treatment of choice whether the discharge is blood-stained or clear. 
1	Subrenal capsule assay as a chemosensitivity test for primary esophageal squamous cell carcinoma. The efficiency of the subrenal capsule assay (SRCA) was studied with fresh tissue of esophageal squamous cell carcinoma. The day-to-day changes in 10 carcinoma cases were evaluated for 9 days. The cancer cells continued to proliferate from the 3rd to the 7th day after the implantation and then decreased. The host reaction was recognized histologically from the 3rd or 4th day to the 9th day. However, the immune reaction did not significantly influence the evaluation of SRCA until the 7th day. The immunohistochemical staining with anti-bromodeoxyuridine monoclonal antibody revealed the existence of cancer cells at the DNA synthesizing stage (S stage) in the graft until the 7th day. In chemosensitivity test by SRCA, 21 patients were studied, and all were evaluable. 5-FU administration produced a response in 8/21 cases (38.1%), VDS in 8/21 (38.1%), and CDDP in 3/21 (14.3%). Used in combination, CDDP + VDS was effective in 7/18 cases (38.9%) and CDDP + BLM in 6/18 cases (33.3%). 
4	Influence of low osmolality contrast media on electrophysiology and hemodynamics in coronary angiography: differences between an ionic (ioxaglate) and a nonionic (iohexol) agent. It has recently been suggested that the addition of sodium to low osmolality contrast media may reduce the incidence of ventricular fibrillation and conduction disturbances during coronary angiography. In a randomized, double blind study of 30 patients undergoing coronary angiography we therefore examined the electrophysiological and hemodynamic effects of the two low osmolality contrast media-ioxaglate (with sodium) and iohexol (without sodium). Standard ECG, aortic blood pressure, and His bundle electrocardiogram were recorded. The contrast media were well tolerated and no serious arrhythmias were observed. Both induced a transient decrement in systolic blood pressure and reduction in heart rate 10 s following contrast injection (all P less than 0.01). Ioxaglate prolonged the QT interval at 10 s (P less than 0.01) and also when analysed for the whole observation period (120 s) (P less than 0.05), whereas iohexol did not cause any significant changes in the QT-interval. The AH-interval was prolonged by ioxaglate at 10 s (P less than 0.01), but not altered by iohexol. Thus, other factors than osmolality and sodium content might contribute to QT prolongation, since only the contrast agents with sodium (ioxaglate) induced QT prolongation in this study. 
3	A prospective, double-blind study of metoclopramide hydrochloride for the control of migraine in the emergency department STUDY OBJECTIVE: To determine the effectiveness of IV metoclopramide as sole therapy for relieving the pain of acute migraine in the emergency department. DESIGN: Prospective study. Fifty patients were divided randomly into subjects and placebo controls with blinding of the treating physician and the patient. PARTICIPANTS: Patients presenting to the ED with migraine requiring parenteral treatment. INTERVENTIONS: Subjects received 10 mg IV metoclopramide and controls received IV normal saline; patient assessment of relief was followed by means of a numerical scale. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Sixty-seven percent of subjects compared with 19% of controls had effective pain relief within one hour (P less than .001). Subjects achieved mean relief scores of 2.46 compared with 1.69 for controls (P less than .02). No significant side effects were observed. CONCLUSION: IV metoclopramide as a single agent is effective and safe therapy for migraine in the ED. 
1	Comparative investigation of c-erbB2/neu expression in head and neck tumors and mammary cancer. Normal tissues, primary tumors, and metastases of mammary and salivary glands and oral/laryngeal mucosa have been analyzed with Northern-blots employing 32P-labeled RNA probes for the expression of the neu oncogene. Neu oncogene expression of a mRNA species of 4.6 kilobases was found in all normal salivary (five) and mammary glands (four) as well as in two normal or inflamed samples of tongue mucosa. This expression was regarded as baseline activity of the neu gene for the respective tissues and was used as standard for the evaluation of benign and malignant tumors. None of 14 squamous cell carcinomas of the oral and laryngeal mucosa showed enhanced neu transcription level. Five fibroadenomas, one benign variant of phylloid tumor, one carcinosarcoma, and one of two proliferative fibrocystic diseases of the breast showed lacking or normal baseline expression of the neu oncogene, as did one monomorphous cystadenolymphoma of the parotid gland. In contrast, four parotid pleomorphic adenomas and one salivary gland adenocarcinoma showed enhanced neu expression. For mammary adenocarcinomas, increased neu oncogene expression concerned ten of 34 cases--all being variants of ductal carcinomas--and all metastases analyzed (six) deriving from three primaries. One adenoid cystic carcinoma also showed enhanced neu expression. Neu overexpression may reflect accidents of genomic reconstitutional events occurring regularly within the differentiation pathway of epithelial/myoepithelial cells. This assumption was supported by further immunohistochemical analysis which showed stainings of myoepithelial and myoepithelia-like cell populations in tumors, especially pleomorphic adenomas and adjacent normal-looking tissues. 
5	Protein turnover in uraemia in the rat. 1. The effect of uraemia on the rates of protein synthesis and protein degradation in liver, heart and vastus lateralis muscle were examined in the rat. Uraemia was induced by a five-sixths nephrectomy and the rates of protein turnover were compared with pair-fed sham-operated littermate controls. 2. The procedure produced plasma concentrations (means +/- SEM) of urea of 7.3 +/- 0.4 mmol/l in control and 39 +/- 2 mmol/l in uraemic rats, and of creatinine of 41 +/- 1 mumol/l in control and 133 +/- 7 mumol/l in uraemic rats. 3. Uraemia reduced the rates of protein synthesis in liver, heart and muscle by 35 +/- 5, 4.0 +/- 1.2 and 4.0 +/- 0.6%/day, respectively, compared with control rats (P less than 0.01). Since the reductions in tissue growth rate were too small to be accounted for by the reduction seen in protein synthesis alone, this implied that protein degradation was also reduced. Uraemia also caused an 18% reduction in the rate of growth as measured by the increase in tail length (P less than 0.01). 4. Uraemia reduced both protein synthesis and protein degradation. Protein synthesis exceeded protein degradation in all tissues. This would cause a reduced rate of protein accumulation in the uraemic compared with the control rats, and hence a reduced rate of growth. 
3	Relationship between body and brain temperature in traumatically brain-injured rodents. Recent work has shown that mild to moderate levels of hypothermia may profoundly reduce the histological and biochemical sequelae of cerebral ischemic injury. In the present study, the authors examined the effect of fluid-percussion injury on brain temperature in anesthetized rats and the effect of anesthesia on brain temperature in uninjured rats. The relationship between the brain, rectal, and temporalis muscle temperatures during normothermia, hypothermia, and hyperthermia was studied following a moderate magnitude of fluid-percussion brain injury (2.10 to 2.25 atmospheres) in rats. The results showed that mean brain temperature in 10 anesthetized injured rats, in 21 anesthetized uninjured rats, and in 10 unanesthetized uninjured rats was a mean (+/- standard error of the mean) of 36.04 degrees +/- 0.20 degrees C, 36.30 degrees +/- 0.08 degrees C, and 37.95 degrees +/- 0.09 degrees C, respectively. There was no significant difference in temperature under general anesthesia between injured and uninjured rats (p greater than 0.05). In the absence of brain injury, mean brain temperature was significantly lower in anesthetized rats than in unanesthetized rats (p less than 0.001). In anesthetized brain-injured rats, temporalis muscle temperature correlated well with brain temperature over a 30 degrees to 40 degrees C range, even when brain temperature was rapidly changed during induction of hypothermia or hyperthermia (r = 0.9986, p less than 0.0001). In contrast, rectal temperature varied inconsistently from brain temperature. These observations indicated that: 1) brain injury itself does not influence brain temperature in this model; 2) anesthesia alone decreases brain temperature to levels producing cerebral protection in this model; and 3) external monitoring of temporalis muscle temperature can provide a reliable indirect measure of brain temperature in the course of experimental brain injury. The authors believe that it is essential to monitor or control brain temperature in studies of experimental brain injury. 
5	Peroxisomal disorders. Although peroxisomes were once considered a vestige, their importance in cellular metabolism is clearly established by the many inherited diseases that have been described in the past two decades. Unfortunately there is no definitive treatment for the various disorders, but based on the recognition of the biochemical abnormalities, prenatal testing and appropriate genetic counseling can be provided. It is essential for clinicians to be aware of this group of diseases, as diagnosis and further study of these patients are essential in understanding the basic etiologic mechanisms underlying these complex groups of disorders. Clearly, there is much to be learned about the relationship between biochemical abnormalities and the phenotypic variability of the peroxisomal disorders. 
3	Characterization of "peak E," a novel amino acid associated with eosinophilia-myalgia syndrome. Epidemiologic studies strongly associate eosinophilia-myalgia syndrome (EMS) with ingestion of tryptophan containing a contaminant ("peak E"). Prior reports have suggested that peak E is the di-tryptophan N alpha-animal of acetaldehyde. Spectral and chemical studies now demonstrate that peak E is 1,1'-ethylidenebis[tryptophan]. This novel amino acid may be the etiological agent responsible for EMS, or it may be a marker of a still unidentified causal agent. 
3	Analgesic use: a study of treatments used by patients for migraine prior to attending the City of London Migraine Clinic. Eighty-three unselected patients attending the City of London Migraine Clinic for the first time were asked about their drug intake and use of alternative treatment. Thirty-one of those questioned took regular daily doses of medication. Fifteen were taking a combination of drugs bought 'over the counter' (OTC) and drugs prescribed by their GP; eleven took OTC drugs only; and 5 took prescription drugs only. It was noticeable that those taking drugs prescribed both by the GP and obtainable over the counter were more likely than the other groups to be taking several drugs rather than a single type. Thirty five of the 83 (42.2%) had tried alternative treatments for their attacks. 
1	Testicular calcifications and neoplasia in patient treated for subfertility. A subfertile male with a history of left cryptorchism underwent scrotal ultrasound that revealed stippled calcifications, without associated mass, in the right testicle. Six months later, while on a regimen of clomiphene citrate, a testicular tumor became palpable. This was sonographically confirmed to be surrounding the calcifications. Testicular calcifications are most commonly associated with benign conditions. We review the literature regarding their relationship to neoplasms and the significance of the ultrasonic findings. Furthermore, this is the sixth reported case of testicular tumor developing during hormonal treatment for oligospermia. Although these cases may be circumstantial, closer surveillance and screening ultrasound may be indicated for subfertile males taking clomiphene citrate. 
5	Role of histamine in natural killer cell-mediated resistance against tumor cells. The formation of lung metastases by i.v.-injected B16 melanoma (F1 and F10 strain) cells in Swiss albino, C57BL/6, and BALB/c mice was reduced by a single dose of histamine given 24 h before tumor cell inoculation. The antimetastatic effect of histamine was specifically mediated by histamine H2-receptors (H2R): it was blocked by the H2R antagonist ranitidine and mimicked by dimaprit, a specific H2R agonist but not by an H2R-inactive structural analog of this compound, nor-dimaprit, or the H1R agonist 2-thiazolyl-ethylamide. A single dose of any of the H2R antagonists ranitidine, tiotidine, famotidine, or cimetidine drastically augmented metastasis. Effects of H2R-interactive compounds on B16 metastasis required intact NK cells, as judged by the inability of histamine or ranitidine to affect B16 metastasis after NK cell depletion in vivo using antibodies to asialo-GM1. NK-cell-mediated lysis of YAC-1 lymphoma cells in vivo was enhanced by histamine and reduced by ranitidine within 4 h after inoculation of tumor cells. The antimetastatic effect of IL-2 was potentiated by histamine; in some experiments, combined treatment with a low dose of IL-2 (6000 U/kg) and histamine completely eliminated metastasis, whereas concomitant treatment with ranitidine abrogated antimetastatic effects of IL-2; animals treated with ranitidine and IL-2 displayed the same level of enhanced metastasis as those treated with ranitidine alone. The presented data are suggestive of an earlier unrecognized role for histamine in NK cell-mediated resistance against metastatic tumor cells. 
5	Learning disabilities in epilepsy: neurophysiological aspects. Subclinical generalized spike-wave discharges are often accompanied by transitory cognitive impairment, demonstrable by psychological testing during EEG recording. Transitory cognitive impairment is demonstrated most readily by difficult tasks and during generalized regular spike-wave bursts lasting for more than 3 s, but can also be found during briefer and even focal discharges. That this is not simply a consequence of global inattention is shown by the fact that focal discharges exhibit some specificity: left-sided focal spiking is more likely to produce errors on verbal tasks, for instance, whereas right-sided discharges are more often accompanied by impairment in handling nonverbal material. Both learning difficulties in general and specific abnormal patterns of cognitive functioning are well documented in children with epilepsy and are most pronounced in those with frequent interictal discharges. However, there is now evidence that intermittent cognitive impairment due to the discharges themselves contributes significantly to such neurophysiological abnormalities. The significance of transitory cognitive impairment accompanying subclinical EEG discharges for everyday functioning is uncertain, but there is experimental evidence that subclinical discharges may be accompanied by disruption of educational skills in children or by impairment of driving performance in motorists. In some individuals, suppression of discharges by antiepileptic drugs has demonstrably improved psychological function, but further work is required to determine the indications for such treatment. 
3	Reconstruction of the chronically insufficient anterior cruciate ligament with the central third of the patellar ligament. The results of reconstruction of the anterior cruciate ligament with the central third of the patellar ligament as a free, autogenous, non-vascularized graft were retrospectively reviewed at our institution. Eighty reconstructions in seventy-nine patients were evaluated after a minimum of two years. In forty-eight (60 per cent) of the knees, the reconstruction was augmented with an extra-articular lateral sling of iliotibial band. The patients were evaluated with a physical examination, a KT-1000 arthrometer, radiographs, a subjective questionnaire, and a revision of the scale of The Hospital for Special Surgery for rating ligaments. Postoperatively, seventy-six (95 per cent) of the eighty knees no longer gave way, and the pivot-shift test was negative in sixty-seven (84 per cent) of the knees. The average score on the ligament-rating scale was 93 points. All of the patients who had clinical instability at the time of the most recent follow-up had associated ligamentous instability that had not been appreciated or addressed at the time of reconstruction. Arthrometric evaluation revealed that the laxity differed by three millimeters or less from that of the untreated knee in sixty (76 per cent) of the treated knees. In the patient who had bilateral reconstruction, the laxity was the same in both knees. Seventeen patients, who had more than three millimeters of translation, also had additional related ligamentous instability, most commonly posterolateral instability and insufficiency of the medial collateral ligament. We think that major associated ligamentous instability predisposes the reconstruction to failure and should be corrected in conjunction with the reconstruction. 
1	99mTc-anti-CEA radioimmunoscintigraphy of lung adenocarcinoma. Anti-carcinoembryonic antigen radioimmunoscintigraphy (anti-CEA RIS) in colorectal adenocarcinoma has been reported to allow a better estimation of the local tumor extension than other radiologic methods. This study evaluated the clinical feasibility of a 99mTc-labeled anti-CEA monoclonal antibody (BW 431/26, Behring Institute, FRG) in 11 patients for staging of primary adenocarcinoma of the lung. The primary tumor size ranged from 3 to 8 cm with a mean of 4 cm. Mediastinal and hilar nodes were present in four patients, intrapulmonary metastases were present in two patients, and pleural and liver metastases were present in one patient each. The CEA levels were in the range of 2 to 265 ng/ml and elevated (greater than 5 ng/ml) in six patients. Planar scintigraphy was performed at 6 h and 24 h post injection (pi). Analog and digitized images were interpreted by two observers. One patient was imaged twice and experienced serum sickness due to human anti-mouse antibodies (HAMA) after the second study, which showed marked unspecific tracer uptake in liver, spleen, and bone marrow, but no specific uptake by the tumor and was excluded from further analysis. Visual interpretation identified the primary tumor clearly in seven patients. No tumor imaging was observed in two patients. Two patients were classified as having questionable imaging due to a poor separation of tumor uptake from mediastinal blood pool. The primary tumor could be clearly delineated in both patients after comparison with the chest radiograph. Thus, the overall sensitivity for imaging of the primary tumor was 82 percent. The average target/background ratio was 1.31 +/- 0.17:1 at 6 h pi, and 1.30 +/- 0.16:1 at 24 h pi. Hilar and mediastinal nodes were correctly suspected in three patients, but the cardiac blood pool hampered a clear interpretation. Intrapulmonary and pleural metastases were diagnosed in all cases. The single liver metastasis was missed because of the high unspecific tracer uptake. Planar anti-CEA RIS with 99mTc BW 431/26 was superior to computed tomography (CT) in one case with subtotal tumor resection. We summarize that at present, planar anti-CEA RIS with 99mTc BW 431/26 cannot be advised as a routine staging procedure in adenocarcinoma of the lung, but it may be helpful in the detection of residual or recurrent tumor tissue. 
2	Peritoneal blastomycosis. Blastomycosis is a systemic fungal infection caused by Blastomyces dermatitidis. Involvement of the peritoneum is unusual, with only two previously reported cases that occurred in association with disseminated disease. A single case of histopathologically proven blastomycosis involving the peritoneum is presented, as well as a short overview of previously published cases on gastrointestinal and peritoneal blastomycosis. The case is unique in that chronic peritonitis was the only manifestation of disease. The diagnosis was made by laparoscopy. 
5	Changes in plasma high density lipoprotein cholesterol and phospholipid in acute viral hepatitis and cholestatic jaundice. Forty-four male and female subjects aged 22-57 years were studied. Thirteen patients had acute viral hepatitis, and eleven patients had cholestatic jaundice due to carcinoma of the head of the pancreas. Twenty healthy volunteers who served as controls were also included. In hepatitis patients, the mean plasma levels of total cholesterol (TC) and the high density lipoprotein (HDL)-phospholipid/phospholipid (HDLPL/PL) ratio were reduced, and HDL-cholesterol (HDLC), HDL-phospholipid (HDLPL) and the phospholipid/total cholesterol (PL/TC) ratio were normal, while total phospholipid (PL) levels and the HDLC/TC ratio were significantly increased compared to the control values. In patients with cholestatic jaundice the mean plasma total cholesterol, phospholipid and HDLC levels were elevated, and HDLPL/PL, HDLPL, HDLC/TC and PL/TC remained normal compared to the control values. A comparison within the patient groups showed that plasma TC, PL and HDLC levels were significantly increased in cholestatic jaundice when compared with the corresponding levels in hepatitis patients. The mean plasma levels of HDLPL, HDLC/TC and PL/TC did not show any significant variation within the patient groups. Alkaline phosphatase (ALP) correlated positively with TC, and total protein correlated negatively with TC and HDLPL, while albumin correlated negatively with TC, HDLC and HDLPL in cholestatic jaundice. Alanine amino-transferase (ALAT) also correlated positively with PL in cholestatic jaundice, while albumin correlated positively with TC in hepatitis. The results suggest that lipoproteins might be metabolized differently in these two forms of cholestasis. 
3	Temporal arteritis with normal erythrocyte sedimentation rates presenting as occipital neuralgia. A retrospective review of 46 patients with biopsy-proven giant cell (temporal) arteritis revealed 8 (17%) whose initial presentation was occipital pain. The most likely etiology of occipital pain in these patients was occipital artery inflammation. A Westergren erythrocyte sedimentation rate less than 40 mm/hour was noted at presentation in 6 of these 8 patients. Giant cell arteritis should be considered in the differential diagnosis of elderly patients who present with occipital pain and demonstrate a normal erythrocyte sedimentation rate. 
4	Life events and difficulties preceding stroke. Life events and difficulties were recorded for the year before stroke, using a standardised semi-structured interview, in 113 surviving patients seen after their first ever in a lifetime stroke. An age and sex-matched control group (n = 109) was also interviewed about the preceding year. The stroke patients reported fewer non-threatening events and events with only a short-term threat, while difficulties were reported with equal frequency by the two groups. However, events which were severely threatening in the long-term were significantly more common in the stroke patients (in the 52 weeks before stroke 26% versus 13%, odds ratio 2.3, 95% confidence interval 1.1-4.9). The increased rate was apparent throughout the year and not just in the weeks immediately before stroke onset. The number of stroke patients experiencing severe events in the follow up year fell to the level found in the control group. Recognised risk factors for stroke were found equally in those patients with and without severe events before onset, except that hypertension was rather less common in the patients who had experienced a severe event. It therefore appears that severe life events may be one of the determinants of stroke onset. 
1	Morphine-induced transactivation of HIV-1 LTR in human neuroblastoma cells. Infection by human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) is followed in many cases by a clinically quiescent or latent phase that appears to continue as long as host antiviral defense is intact. This has raised the possibility that certain host susceptibility factors (i.e., environmental cofactors) might influence the progression of the disease. In this study we demonstrate that morphine can function to activate HIV/LTR-CAT fusion gene (HIV-long terminal repeat-chloramphenicol acetyltransferase) when transfected into undifferentiated human SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cells. The stimulatory effect of morphine is amplified in SH-SY5Y cells that have been induced to differentiate first with phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) and is much less in cells differentiated with retinoic acid (RA). Morphine does not appreciably activate HIV/LTR-CAT expression in human MOLT-3 and other T cells. Morphine activation of HIV/LTR-CAT in the SH-SY5Y cells is not reversible by naltrexone and appears to involve a Fos/Jun signaling system. Our results suggest that narcotics such as morphine may lead to activation of latent HIV infection. This may be particularly important in tissues, such as brain, which can host latent HIV infection and which is uniquely damaged in patients with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) as evidenced by neuronal degeneration and dementia. We also predict that these findings may have important implications for the pathogenesis of AIDS, particularly in opiate drug abusers. 
3	Intraputaminal infusion of nerve growth factor to support adrenal medullary autografts in Parkinson's disease. One-year follow-up of first clinical trial. Experimental studies in rodents show that beta-nerve growth factor can increase the survival, neurite outgrowth, and functional effect of grafts of adrenal chromaffin cells to the basal ganglia. We, therefore, have begun to investigate whether treatment with nerve growth factor might also increase the functional effect of autografts of adrenal medullary tissue in patients with Parkinson's disease. Previous studies have shown that stereotactic implantation of adrenal tissue pieces produces a transient functional improvement that lasts for a few months. This report describes a trial of grafting of adrenal chromaffin tissue into the putamen, supported by infusion of nerve growth factor. The patient is a 63-year-old woman with a 19-year history of Parkinson's disease, now complicated by on-off phenomena and drug-induced hyperkinesia, despite optimized medical management. The left adrenal gland was removed, and the medulla was dissected into 1- to 2-mm3 pieces in a solution containing nerve growth factor purified from mouse submandibular gland. Pieces were implanted in six tracts 3 to 4 mm from a previously placed cannula in the left putamen. Through the cannula, nerve growth factor was infused for 23 days for a total dose of 3.3 mg. Clinical assessment consisted of global ratings for rigidity and/or hypokinesia and for drug-induced hyperkinesia. Measures of gait and fine-motor control were also made. The motor readiness potential and auditory evoked potentials were recorded. 
5	Flexion osteotomy of the femur for genu recurvatum after poliomyelitis. We report the results of 21 femoral osteotomies performed in 18 patients for genu recurvatum and flattening of the femoral condyles after poliomyelitis. Before operation the average angle of recurvatum was 31 degrees and all the limbs required bracing. After a mean follow-up of four years there has been partial recurrence in only one case. Nine patients (10 limbs) needed no orthosis and the others had less discomfort and an improved gait. Complete remodelling of the femoral and tibial epiphyses was noted in two of the younger patients. 
2	Adult immunization in a network of family practice residency programs. A substantial proportion of morbidity and mortality associated with vaccine-preventable diseases occurs among adults. Teaching residents about disease prevention is mandated in the curriculum guidelines for family practice programs. A cooperative study among the Kansas City family practice residency programs was begun to look at immunization behaviors in these teaching programs. A retrospective audit of medical records and a prospective survey of residents and faculty were performed. From the medical records of 400 patients seen for health maintenance examinations, the frequency of tetanus-diphtheria immunizations recorded was 4.75%. The pooled immunization rate recorded for pneumococcal vaccine was 25%, and for influenza vaccine, 24%. Although 93% of respondents knew patients need tetanus-diphtheria immunization every 10 years, on a written questionnaire giving clinical examples, they were less likely to elect to immunize older patients eligible for tetanus-diphtheria vaccine. The following immunization criteria were listed by respondents: for pneumococcal vaccine, age over 65 years (86%); for influenza vaccine, age over 65 years (85%), chronic diseases (69%), residence in a chronic care facility (7%), and being a health care worker (28%). Educational interventions stressing the appropriate criteria and involvement of the patient are planned at the separate programs. 
4	Management of aortic insufficiency in chronic aortic dissection. From January 1980 to December 1988, 44 patients with chronic aortic dissection and aortic insufficiency underwent operation. This group of patients was analyzed to evaluate the outcome of those in whom the aortic valve was preserved compared with those having valve replacement. The overall preoperative characteristics of the two groups were similar except for the incidence of Marfan's syndrome. Valve replacement was the elected procedure in patients with valve degeneration or annuloaortic ectasia. In patients with leaflet prolapse with or without an enlarged annulus, a plastic procedure was used. In 48% of the patients, it was possible to preserve the valve. There were five hospital deaths (11%): three were due to low-output syndrome, one was due to bleeding, and one was due to neurological complications. There were two late deaths (5%). Follow-up of the 37 surviving patients ranged from 2 to 108 months (mean follow-up, 18 months). Seventy-eight percent of the survivors were in functional class I and the others were in class II. Two patients in whom the aortic valve was preserved had mild aortic insufficiency. Three patients with bioprostheses underwent reoperation because of prosthetic valve dysfunction. One patient who had aortoplasty and an aortic valve plastic procedure was seen with redissection and aortic insufficiency after 60 months and was reoperated on using the Bentall technique. The actuarial survival curves showed that patients who underwent valvoplasty had higher, but not significantly higher, survival rates than the valve replacement patients. 
4	A perspective on reducing salt intake. Epidemiological, clinical, and experimental evidence links excessive salt consumption to hypertension; there appears to be no evidence that it is beneficial. I conclude that it should be public policy to advise and help Americans to reduce their salt intake. Because even mild hypertension increases risk, the overall problem does not appear to be amenable to treatment, although treatment for those with clinical hypertension will always be needed. There appears to be little likelihood that identification of those "at risk" will be successful, nor does it appear that we have the capacity at this time to conduct successful preventive field trials. It is difficult for the individual to modify his diet alone. The successful strategy is to modify the food supply by changing public demand. The public responds to dietary advice if acceptable and identifiable products are available. Because most of the salt is in commercially prepared foods and because their consumption will increase in the future, the major responsibility for lowering salt consumption will fall on the food manufacturers. They are beginning to respond, and there appears to be ample opportunity for them to reduce the salt content of foods markedly. Our temporary objectives, however, should be modest, because unrealistic objectives only discourage those who attempt to follow them. 
4	Immediate preoperative phlebotomy with autologous blood donation for aortic replacement. The preferential use of autologous blood provided by phlebotomy can reduce the need for homologous blood transfusion in patients undergoing extensive elective operations. This blood is usually provided either by intraoperative isovolemic hemodilution or phlebotomy one to two weeks preoperatively. To minimize the intraoperative time delay or preoperative period between phlebotomy and operation required in these patients, we performed preoperative isovolemic hemodilution in 69 patients one to two days prior to elective aortic replacement for infrarenal aneurysmal disease. Patients underwent phlebotomy a mean of 0.57 +/- 0.01 liter of whole blood; volume was replaced with lactated Ringer's solution. Hematocrit levels decreased from a mean value of 42.9 +/- 0.4 per cent to 33.7 +/- 0.3 per cent. Mean intraoperative blood loss was 1.2 +/- 0.05 liters. Hemodynamic parameters (blood pressure, cardiac output, pulmonary capillary wedge pressure, central venous pressure, oxygen delivery and systemic vascular resistance) remained stable throughout the perioperative and intraoperative time periods. In addition, we evaluated the technical modification of exclusion aneurysmorrhaphy (n = 50) versus open aneurysmorraphy (n = 19) on reduction of intraoperative homologous blood transfusion in these patients. Seventy-two per cent (36 of 50) of patients whose aneurysms were excluded received no homologous blood intraoperatively. Blood loss was decreased in the excluded versus open aneurysmorraphy group, 920 +/- 90 milliliters versus 2,030 +/- 250 milliliters, as were homologous blood transfusion requirements, 175 +/- 35 milliliters versus 570 +/- 119 milliliters. Two patients died (2.9 per cent mortality rate), and there was no increase in morbidity. Surgical treatment of large aortic aneurysms is frequently performed on an urgent basis; thus, provision of autologous blood for this operation in a short period of time may be beneficial. Isovolemic hemodilution performed during the immediate preoperative period can reduce homologous blood requirements and be safely performed without adverse effects on mortality, morbidity and myocardial performance. Exclusion aneurysmorrhaphy may further reduce dependence on homologous blood. 
4	Direct measurement of skeletal muscle fatigue in patients with chronic heart failure. Skeletal muscle function was measured as force production and fatigue in both the quadriceps (a large locomotive muscle) and adductor pollicis (a small intrinsic hand muscle) in five healthy volunteers, five patients with mild chronic heart failure, and five patients with severe chronic heart failure. The quadriceps of patients with chronic heart failure had a reduced muscle cross sectional area, a reduced maximum isometric force production, and an increased tendency to fatigue. Isometric force production and fatigue of the adductor pollicis, however, were not significantly different between the three groups under control conditions. But during circulatory occlusion fatigue in the adductor pollicis increased more in the patients with severe chronic heart failure. These differing findings in quadriceps and adductor pollicis suggest that skeletal muscle atrophy and reduced isometric force production are not a necessary consequence of chronic heart failure per se, because they were only present in the large locomotive muscle. The normal values for muscle fatigue observed in adductor pollicis in patients with chronic heart failure imply that skeletal muscle blood flow must increase normally during muscle activation when only a small muscle mass is used. These results are not compatible with the concept of a generalised impairment of normal vasodilatation within active skeletal muscle. In contrast, activation of a large muscle, such as quadriceps, results in the rapid onset of fatigue in patients with severe chronic heart failure. This fatigue may be related to the inability of the cardiovascular system to provide the required blood flow for the activation of a large muscle mass. 
4	HIV-associated myocarditis. Pathology and immunopathology. Autopsy studies of AIDS (acquired immune deficiency syndrome) patients showed a high incidence of myocarditis. To attain a better understanding of the pathogenesis, the pathology and immunopathology of nine endomyocardial biopsies with active myocarditis from 18 human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-positive patients were systematically characterized. These were compared with 17 biopsies with active myocarditis from patients without AIDS risk factors. In both groups, the myocarditis consisted of either multifocal or interstitial infiltrates of small lymphocytes and isolated myocyte necrosis. The lymphocytes consisted of T cells (CD2+, CD3+) and cells not identified by the usual markers. B cells, monocytes, CD4+ cells, and natural killer (NK) cells were only rarely observed. All of the HIV-positive patients but only 7 of 17 non-HIV patients had CD8+ lymphocytes in the infiltrates (P less than 0.01). The arteriolar endothelium demonstrated induced class I (HLA-A, B, C) and II (HLA-DR) antigens in both groups. In situ hybridization for HIV-1 failed to identify the virus in the specimens. The immunopathology is consistent with a cell-mediated injury to the myocytes in HIV-positive patients and is similar to a subgroup of myocarditis in the non-HIV group. 
5	Late relapse with nodular lymphoma after treatment for diffuse non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. Histologic conversion from a low-grade non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) into a more aggressive histologic pattern is a common, well-documented event in NHL. The converse phenomenon, appearance of a low-grade, follicular NHL after treatment for diffuse, intermediate, or high-grade NHL, has only recently been recognized. The clinical, morphologic, and immunologic features of a patient in whom relapse with an indolent nodular lymphoma was noticed after combination chemotherapy for diffuse lymphoma are presented. Immunologic markers at presentation and relapse were similar. Other previously reported cases are reviewed. Implications for diagnosis and therapy as well as the pathogenesis of this unique form of conversion are discussed. 
5	Sudden infant death syndrome in infants of substance-abusing mothers. A population-based study was performed to determine whether substance abuse during the perinatal period may be a risk factor for sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS). The incidence of SIDS was studied in 2143 infants of substance-abusing mothers (ISAM) born in Los Angeles County during 1986 and 1987 who were reported to the Los Angeles County Department of Health Services because of a history of drug exposure or positive urine test results in the mother, infant, or both. By comparing the ISAM birth reports with records of autopsy-proven SIDS in Los Angeles County, we found 19 SIDS cases in the population of 2143 ISAM, a SIDS rate of 8.87 cases per 1000 ISAM (95% confidence interval 5.3 to 13.8). This was significantly higher than the SIDS rate for the non-ISAM general population: 396 SIDS deaths among 325,372 live births, an incidence rate of 1.22 cases per 1000 births, p less than 0.00001. The age of ISAM at death was 99 +/- 63 (mean +/- SD) days compared with 91 +/- 52 days for the non-ISAM population (not significant). The incidence of SIDS was significantly greater in male infants, during the winter months, in black infants, and in non-Hispanic white infants in the non-ISAM population. Such differences were not observed in the ISAM group. A greater incidence of symptomatic apnea was reported before SIDS for the ISAM than for the non-ISAM population (22% vs 5.4%, p = 0.022). We conclude that ISAM have a higher incidence of SIDS than the non-ISAM general population. However, it was not possible to separate maternal substance abuse from other confounding variables that may also have had an impact on SIDS risk in the ISAM group. 
2	Risk of gastric cancer after gastric surgery for benign disorders. The objective of this review was to evaluate published evidence for the association between gastric resection for benign disorders and subsequent cancer of the gastric remnant. We searched the literature through Medline (1970 to 1988) and through the references of relevant articles. Fifty-eight studies consisting of case series, uncontrolled surveys, and case control or cohort analyses were identified and critically assessed using defined methodological criteria. There were no consistent differences between the expected and observed number of cancers occurring within 15 years after gastric resection. However, all case control studies and seven of the eight cohort analyses, in which the prevalence of cancer was stratified by time since gastric resection, indicated a twofold to fourfold increase in the risk of gastric cancer in patients who survived 15 or more years after gastric surgery. We conclude that most studies of the association of gastric surgery with subsequent gastric cancer have relatively weak designs. Still, the repetitive demonstration of this association by different investigators using different research designs supports the hypothesis that gastric resection increases the risk of cancer in the gastric remnant. 
4	Aspirin reduces the growth of medial and neointimal thickenings in balloon-injured rat carotid arteries. We analyzed the effect of Aspirin on the growth of experimentally induced vascular thickenings in rat carotid arteries. Vascular thickenings were induced by denudation of the endothelium in the left carotid artery with a balloon catheter. Administration of Aspirin-rich food (17.4 g/kg body wt/day) was started 1 week before and continued 2 weeks after injury. Nine rats were used. A control group of equal size received normal food. Sizes of the tunica media, the neointima, and the open vessel lumen were measured on cross sections of carotid segments with the aid of a videomorphometry system. The results show that in the Aspirin group, neointimal lesions are significantly smaller than in the control group (0.14 mm2 versus 0.23 mm2; p less than 0.5). Thickenings of the tunica media are also reduced (0.11 mm2 versus 0.12 mm2; p less than 0.5). It is suggested that Aspirin reduces both medial hypertrophy and neointimal outgrowth in injury-induced atherosclerosis. 
4	Buerger's colour. Cyanosis of the hands and feet in Buerger's disease is known as 'Buerger's colour'. This characteristic skin colour is produced by the subpapillary venous plexus. The reactions of the subpapillary venous plexus in patients with Buerger's disease were observed by analysing the fractional blood volume of tissue using a visible light reflective spectrophotometer. Capillary morphology was investigated using an intravital video-microscopic system. Twenty-seven subjects, comprising 13 normals and 14 patients with Buerger's disease, were studied. In the nailbeds of patients with Buerger's disease, an increase in the number of loops, cyanotic colour change and dilatation were observed. In this condition there was incompetence of venular tonus and regurgitation at venular valves. Buerger's colour is probably due to excessive congestion of venous blood in the subpapillary venous plexus which is produced by these mechanisms. 
5	Hypercapnic respiratory failure due to L-tryptophan-induced eosinophilic polymyositis. A 24-year-old man presenting with fever, rash, and myalgias subsequently developed hypercapnic respiratory failure and severe limb muscle weakness. Muscle biopsy revealed eosinophilic myositis, due to the ingestion of large quantities of L-tryptophan as a dietary supplement. Complete recovery occurred with corticosteroid administration. Significant involvement of the respiratory muscles can be a predominant feature of this newly described disease entity. 
1	Vastus lateralis myocutaneous flap for reconstruction of defects around the groin and pelvis. We present our experience using the vastus lateralis myocutaneous flap for the repair of defects around the groin and pelvis. It is a relatively new technique, with many advantages over other flaps used in this area, though it has limitations. The history, anatomy and surgical technique of raising the flap are described and clinical cases are discussed. The importance of patient selection is highlighted. 
2	Clostridium difficile--a common and costly colitis. Clostridium difficile infection manifests as a self-limiting diarrhea, protracted colitis, or toxic pseudomembranous colitis. The incidence of C. difficile in a 514-bed community hospital was studied retrospectively; 155 patients of a total 18,262 admitted during 1988 were identified with C. difficile as an admitting or subsequent diagnosis. The method of diagnosis, mode of therapy, and related costs were analyzed. We have determined that education, with an emphasis on pathogenesis and prevention, is necessary to reduce the incidence in the hospital and the cost to the patient. 
5	Infective dermatitis of Jamaican children: a marker for HTLV-I infection In Jamaican children infective dermatitis is a chronic eczema associated with refractory nonvirulent Staphylococcus aureus or beta-haemolytic streptococcus infection of the skin and nasal vestibule. 14 children between the ages of 2 and 17 years with typical infective dermatitis, attending the dermatology clinic at the University Hospital of the West Indies in Jamaica, were tested for antibody to human T-lymphotropic virus type 1 (HTLV-1). All were seropositive, whereas 11 children of similar age with atopic eczema were all negative. In 2 of 2 cases of infective dermatitis, the biological mother was HTLV-1 seropositive. None of the 14 patients showed signs of adult T-cell leukaemia/lymphoma, though experience with previous cases of infective dermatitis indicates the possibility of such progression. 
4	Thromboxane A2 and development of genetic hypertension in the Lyon rat strain. To determine whether the increased renal biosynthesis of thromboxane A2 observed in young genetically hypertensive rats of the Lyon strain could be involved in the development of their hypertension, Lyon hypertensive female rats received either thromboxane synthetase inhibitors (Dazmegrel or OKY 046) or a thromboxane A2 receptor antagonist (AH 23848) during their prehypertensive stage. Treatment from 5 to 9 weeks of age with Dazmegrel failed to reduce systolic blood pressure. When given from 3 to 9 weeks of age, Dazmegrel and OKY 046 induced a similar progressive and specific reduction (60%) in the urinary excretion of thromboxane B2 that was associated with a transient decrease in blood pressure level with Dazmegrel and a longer lasting blood pressure-lowering effect with OKY 046. AH 23848, given according to the same schedule, normalized the blood pressure level. This effect persisted 1 week after the cessation of the treatment. Interestingly, active doses of thromboxane synthetase inhibitors or of thromboxane A2 receptor blocker required a 3-week delay to exhibit their antihypertensive properties. It is concluded that 1) the elevated production of thromboxane A2 observed in young Lyon hypertensive rats is likely to participate actively in their blood pressure regulation and 2) this effect may be independent of its direct vasoconstrictor properties. 
5	Serum and tissue magnesium concentrations in patients with heart failure and serious ventricular arrhythmias. OBJECTIVE: To compare magnesium concentrations in serum and tissue from patients with heart failure. Two groups of patients were compared, those with or without serious ventricular arrhythmias. DESIGN: Consecutive enrollment. Blinded laboratory analyses. SETTING: Referral inpatient service of the cardiology division of a university hospital. PATIENTS: Twenty-three patients with idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy and mild to moderately severe congestive heart failure (New York Heart Association functional class II to IV) were divided into two groups: 9 patients with sustained ventricular tachycardias and 14 patients without serious ventricular arrhythmias (control). INTERVENTIONS: Medications for heart failure were withdrawn 12 hours or more before study. Antiarrhythmic therapy was continued throughout the study. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: The patients had skeletal muscle biopsies, myocardial biopsies, and blood sampling for the analysis of magnesium concentrations. No statistically significant differences in the mean magnesium concentrations in serum, circulating mononuclear cells, skeletal muscle, and myocardium were found when the 9 patients with ventricular arrhythmias were compared with the 14 control patients without serious ventricular arrhythmias. CONCLUSIONS: In a general, ambulatory sample of patients with heart failure, magnesium depletion in serum and tissue does not appear to occur more commonly in patients with serious ventricular arrhythmias than in patients without serious ventricular arrhythmias. 
2	Changes in anal canal sensation after childbirth. Obstetic trauma predisposes to faecal incontinence. Anal canal sensation is impaired in incontinent patients. To assess the effect of childbirth on anal canal sensation anal mucosal electrosensitivity was measured in 122 primiparous patients in the immediate postnatal period and in 74 at 6 months postpartum. There were 35 normal vaginal deliveries, 36 forceps deliveries, 20 ventouse extractions, ten vaginal breech deliveries and 21 caesarean sections. Sensation was impaired in the lower, mid and upper anal canal immediately after delivery in those patients who had a normal vaginal delivery or a forceps delivery when compared with controls or with those delivered by caesarean section. Women who had ventouse deliveries had impaired sensation immediately after delivery in the mid anal canal compared with controls and those undergoing caesarean section. By 6 months there were no differences between any group. Patients who sustained a division of the external anal sphincter at delivery had impaired sensation which persisted in the upper anal canal at 6 months. 
5	Long-term postthoracotomy pain. We used a pain questionnaire to evaluate the prevalence and functional significance of long-term postthoracotomy pain. Data on 56 patients who were at least 2 months postsurgery were analyzed. Thirty patients (54 percent) with a median follow-up of 19.5 months had persistent pain; 26 others were pain free at a median of 30.5 months postthoracotomy. Pain was reported in 24 of 44 patients (55 percent) who were more than one year after surgery, 13 of 29 patients (45 percent) more than two years, six of 16 (38 percent) more than three years, and three of ten patients (30 percent) greater than four years postthoracotomy. Pain intensity was low, but 13 patients stated that pain "slightly" or "moderately" interfered with their lives. Five of 56 patients had sufficiently severe chronic pain to require either daily analgesic use, nerve blocks, relaxation therapy, acupuncture, or referral to a pain clinic. We conclude that long-term chest wall pain is common postthoracotomy. It is generally not severe, but a small proportion of patients may experience persistent, moderately disabling pain. 
5	Ileocolic nipple valve anastomosis for preventing recurrence of surgically treated Crohn's disease. Long-term follow-up of six patients. To prevent coloileal reflux after ileocecal resection, an ileocolic nipple valve anastomosis was constructed in six patients with Crohn's disease. The patients were observed for more than 7 years and were compared with 21 Crohn patients in whom conventional end-to-end ileocolic anastomosis was performed during the same period. The outcome was more favorable in the group with nipple valve anastomosis, i.e., longer interval between surgery and symptomatic relapse, and tendency to less frequent recurrence and re-resection. An association was found between radiologically preserved nipple valve and remission, and two patients with intact valve at long-term follow-up remained symptom-free. The observations implied that protection of the terminal ileum from coloileal reflux after ileocecal resection for Crohn's disease may favorably influence the prognosis. 
5	Diagnoses of acute lower respiratory tract infections in children in Rawalpindi and Islamabad, Pakistan. A hospital-based inpatient and outpatient study of 1,492 cases of acute lower respiratory tract infection (ALRI) was conducted from November 1986 to March 1988 in two hospitals in Rawalpindi and Islamabad, Pakistan. Specimens of nasopharyngeal aspirate were processed for viral studies in all cases; blood cultures were performed in 1,331 cases; and urine was obtained for detection of bacterial antigen in 378 cases, but 227 of these samples had bacterial contamination and were discarded. Respiratory syncytial virus was identified in 33% of cases, and Haemophilus influenzae and Streptococcus pneumoniae were identified in 9.6% and 9.9% of cases, respectively. Nonencapsulated H. influenzae accounted for 32% of the Haemophilus isolates, and type b was the only encapsulated H. influenzae strain identified. Of the S. pneumoniae serotypes isolated, 31% are not included in the currently available polyvalent pneumococcal vaccine. No clinical characteristic was demonstrated to be a reliable indicator for bacterial ALRI. 
5	Acquired benign esophagorespiratory fistula: report of 16 consecutive cases. Sixteen cases of acquired benign esophagorespiratory fistula were treated in a 20-year period. A delay in diagnosis was usual, and most patients were first seen with a pulmonary infection already developed. Contrast esophageal x-ray studies established the diagnosis in all patients. There were seven esophagotracheal and nine esophagobronchial fistulas. A fistula between the esophageal diverticulum and a bronchus considered to be of inflammatory origin developed in 7 patients. A fistula as the consequence of trauma developed in 9 patients, and these fistulas were situated at a higher level of the respiratory tree. All patients underwent surgical treatment; in 12 it was definitive, and in 4 temporary gastrostomy was performed to improve nutrition before definite repair. The definitive repair consisted of eventual diverticulectomy, division of the fistula, and suture of both esophageal and respiratory defects. Two patients required esophageal resection and later reconstruction with colon interposition. One patient died, creating an operative mortality of 8.3% in the definitive-repair group. The remaining 11 patients had a gratifying long-term result. There were two deaths in the gastrostomy group due to an extremely poor condition of patients and debilitating pulmonary infection. Early diagnosis of this rare condition is necessary if severe pulmonary complications are to be avoided. Early direct repair gives excellent results. 
1	Cecal diverticulitis presented as a cecal tumor. Seven patients diagnosed as having acute appendicitis were operated on and a cecal wall mass due to cecal diverticulitis was found. In two patients the mass could not be separated from the cecal wall and right colectomy was performed. In five patients, in whom the mass could be separated from the cecum, conservative operations (three diverticulectomies and two wedge resections) were performed, thus avoiding needless, more extensive surgery. 
5	Digoxin for atrial fibrillation: a drug whose time has gone? For over 200 years digitalis compounds have been used to treat atrial fibrillation. The rapid ventricular response to atrial fibrillation is frequently treated with digoxin to produce a controlled heart rate. Digoxin has also been proposed as a treatment for terminating recent-onset atrial fibrillation, for maintaining sinus rhythm after an episode of atrial fibrillation, and as prophylactic therapy in patients with paroxysmal atrial fibrillation to prevent excessive tachycardia during a paroxysm. Perhaps because it has been used for so long, few of these indications have been studied scientifically until recently. Studies now suggest that in patients with atrial fibrillation, digoxin is a poor drug for controlling heart rate during exertion, has little or no effect in terminating the arrhythmia, and may occasionally aggravate paroxysmal atrial fibrillation. Despite adequate digitalization, the heart rate at the onset of a paroxysm of fibrillation in patients receiving the drug does not differ from the heart rate in patients not receiving it. This article discusses the current role of digoxin in the management of patients with chronic, recent-onset, or paroxysmal atrial fibrillation. 
3	Treatment of status migrainosus: the American experience. Dependence upon a variety of drugs--ergotamine, analgesics, benzodiazepines, corticosteroids--is a major reason for patients to enter an intractable phase of their migrainous disorders. Repeated dosing of dihydroergotamine has proven to be remarkably effective in stabilizing the mechanism of migraine, allowing these patients to make the transition to a more reasonable as well as more specific form of therapy. 
3	Comparison of vastus medialis obliquus: vastus lateralis muscle integrated electromyographic ratios between healthy subjects and patients with patellofemoral pain. The purpose of this study was to compare vastus medialis obliquus:vastus lateralis muscle (VMO:VL) integrated electromyographic (IEMG) ratios of healthy subjects and patients with unilateral patellofemoral pain (PFP) under isotonic and isometric quadriceps femoris muscle contraction conditions. Subjects ranging in age from 18 to 35 years (mean = 28.06, SD = 5.97) were assigned to one of three groups on the basis of type of knee condition. In group 1, which consisted of seven healthy control subjects with no history of knee pathology, both knees were tested. In group 2, which consisted of nine patients with unilateral PFP, only the painful knee was tested. In group 3, which consisted of the same nine patients who comprised group 2, only the nonpainful knee was tested. Nonnormalized and normalized VMO:VL IEMG ratios were computed for ascending stairs, descending stairs, submaximal isometric contraction, and maximal isometric contraction (nonnormalized only). A two-way analysis of variance for repeated measures indicated VMO:VL ratios for isotonic stair-climbing activities were significantly greater than VMO:VL ratios for isometric contractions. Nonnormalized VMO:VL ratios in group 1 were significantly greater than nonnormalized VMO:VL ratios in the other two groups. Patients with PFP may have abnormal VMO:VL activation patterns, and isotonic quadriceps femoris muscle exercise may elicit more favorable muscle activation patterns than isometric exercise for patients with PFP. 
5	Postinduction repression of the beta-interferon gene is mediated through two positive regulatory domains. Virus induction of the human beta-interferon (beta-IFN) gene results in an increase in the rate of beta-IFN mRNA synthesis, followed by a rapid postinduction decrease. In this paper, we show that two beta-IFN promoter elements, positive regulatory domains I and II (PRDI and PRDII), which are required for virus induction of the beta-IFN gene are also required for the postinduction turnoff. Although protein synthesis is not necessary for activation, it is necessary for repression of these promoter elements. Examination of nuclear extracts from cells infected with virus reveals the presence of virus-inducible, cycloheximide-sensitive, DNA-binding activities that interact specifically with PRDI or PRDII. We propose that the postinduction repression of beta-IFN gene transcription involves virus-inducible repressors that either bind directly to the positive regulatory elements of the beta-IFN promoter or inactivate the positive regulatory factors bound to PRDI and PRDII. 
3	A retrospective outcome study and review of hypnosis as treatment of adults with sleepwalking and sleep terror. Hypnosis has been described anecdotally to be effective in the treatment of sleepwalking and sleep terror, potentially dangerous parasomnias. The authors report the use of hypnosis in the treatment of 27 adult patients with these disorders. A total of 74% of these individuals reported much or very much improvement when followed over substantial periods after instruction in self-hypnotic exercises that were practiced in the home. Hypnosis, often preferred over pharmacotherapy by patients, required one to six office visits (mean = 1.6). This represents a very cost-effective and noninvasive means of treatment, especially when constrasted with lengthy psychotherapy and pharmacotherapy. 
1	Menopausal estrogen replacement therapy and breast cancer We conducted a meta-analysis of the literature concerning breast cancer and estrogen replacement therapy. The overall relative risk of breast cancer associated with this therapy was 1.07. However, the variation of the estimated risks among the studies was far greater than could plausibly be explained by chance alone. To explain this variation, we looked at the effects of type, duration, and dosage of treatment. Overall, women who took 0.625 mg/d or less of conjugated estrogens had a risk of breast cancer that was 1.08 times that of women who did not receive this therapy (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.96 to 1.2). The relative risks from these individual studies of low-dosage therapy did not differ significantly from each other. Women who took 1.25 mg/d or more of conjugated estrogens had a breast cancer relative risk of 2.0 or less in all studies. However, the variation in observed risks at this higher dosage was significant. This implies that other risk factors varied among these studies, making it difficult to estimate the overall risk associated with this dosage. The relative risk of breast cancer associated with estrogen replacement therapy among women with a history of benign breast disease was 1.16 (95% CI, 0.89 to 1.5). The combined results from multiple studies provide strong evidence that menopausal therapy consisting of 0.625 mg/d or less of conjugated estrogens does not increase breast cancer risk. 
1	Xeroderma pigmentosum lesions related to ultraviolet transmittance by clothes. Xeroderma pigmentosum is associated with severe actinic degeneration of the skin. Our patient with xeroderma pigmentosum showed increasing actinic damage in some areas covered by clothes. We therefore performed a complete evaluation of the patient's exposure to ultraviolet radiation. This included transmission measurements of the patient's clothes, glasses, and car windows. The transmission of UVB (280 to 320 nm) by the clothes varied from none to 17.8%. The transmitted UVB radiation was proportional to the clinical manifestations of xeroderma pigmentosum. The patient's wardrobe was changed, and UVA-blocking film was applied to the windows of the car and house. A decline in manifestations was seen after 18 months of improved ultraviolet protection. 
5	Hepatocellular carcinoma presenting with pyrexia and leukocytosis: report of five cases. In the past 26 years we have encountered five patients with primary liver malignancy clinically characterized by high remittent fever and leukocytosis mimicking liver abscess. Two patients underwent exploratory laparotomy, and drainage was carried out in another. The clinical courses went rapidly downhill. The liver was cirrhotic in two patients. The interior of the main mass was almost totally necrotic in four cases. Histologically, the malignant cells in the main portion resembled sarcoma, but in some areas cells appeared epithelial with eosinophilic cytoplasm and were in a trabecular arrangement, except for one case not subjected to autopsy in which histological study was inadequate because of extensive necrosis. It seems that these neoplasms were very poorly differentiated hepatocellular carcinomas rather than combinations of sarcoma and hepatocellular carcinoma. These patients, therefore, may represent a distinct clinicopathological type of hepatocellular carcinoma that is very rare in Japan but perhaps more common in South Africa, where similar cases have been clinically described in larger numbers. 
4	Logistic discriminant analysis improves diagnostic accuracy of exercise testing for coronary artery disease in women. BACKGROUND. Diagnostic accuracy of the exercise electrocardiogram in women has been shown to be limited for the detection of coronary artery disease. New diagnostic methods based on computer analysis of the exercise electrocardiogram and multivariate analysis have improved the diagnostic value of exercise testing in male subjects. The aim of the present study was to assess whether the diagnostic value of exercise testing can be enhanced in women by using multivariate analysis of exercise data. METHODS AND RESULTS. Between 1978 and 1984, 135 infarct-free women underwent exercise testing and coronary angiography. Significant coronary artery disease was present in 41% of the patients. In this first group, maximal exercise variables were submitted to a stepwise logistic analysis. Work load, heart rate, and ST60X were selected to build a diagnostic model. The model was tested in a second group of 115 catheterized women (significant coronary artery disease in 47%) and of 76 volunteers. We compared the present model with conventional analysis of the exercise electrocardiogram, with ST changes adjusted for heart rate, and with a previously described analysis. In both groups, sensitivity was better with the present model (66% and 70%) than by conventional (68% and 59%) and by the previously described analysis (57% and 44%) without a loss of specificity (85% and 93%). Receiver-operator characteristic curves showed also a better diagnostic accuracy with the present model. CONCLUSIONS. In women, logistic analysis of exercise variables improves the diagnostic value of exercise testing. It yields a significantly better sensitivity without a loss of specificity. 
3	The dynamic flexometer: an instrument for the objective evaluation of spasticity. Anesthesiologists may care for patients who have spasticity in the operating room or pain clinic. A number of therapeutic modalities for treatment of spasticity exist, but there are few simple objective methods for evaluating their effect. We describe one instrument, the Dynamic Flexometer, that measures the force required to move the limb passively through its maximum range of motion. The data presented validate the instrument's reliability. Two clinical cases presented here demonstrate the instrument's utility. This device may be of value to anesthesiologists involved in the care of patients with spasticity. 
3	Prospective observations of 100 high-risk neonates by high-field (1.5 Tesla) magnetic resonance imaging of the central nervous system. II. Lesions associated with hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy. One hundred neonates determined prospectively to be at risk for neurologic handicap underwent magnetic resonance imaging with a high-field (1.5 T) imager. Thirty-three demonstrated a total of 37 lesions consistent with hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy, including periventricular leukomalacia (n = 12), basal ganglia hemorrhage (n = 5), multicystic encephalomalacia (n = 5), and focal parenchymal hemorrhage (n = 15). Diagnoses by ultrasonography and computed tomography were compared with those by magnetic resonance imaging in 29 and 17 infants, respectively. Ultrasonography agreed more frequently with magnetic resonance imaging than did computed tomography. Ultrasonography detected 79% of lesions demonstrated by magnetic resonance imaging whereas computed tomography detected only 41%. Periventricular leukomalacia was seen most often in preterm infants, basal ganglia hemorrhage and multicystic encephalomalacia primarily occurred in term infants, and focal parenchymal hemorrhage occurred at all gestational ages. Basal ganglia hemorrhage and multicystic encephalomalacia were strongly associated with histories of perinatal asphyxia, seizures, and early abnormal neurological status. All infants with basal ganglia hemorrhage (5/5) and multicystic encephalomalacia (5/5) and the majority with periventricular leukomalacia (9/12) and focal parenchymal hemorrhages (9/15) had developmental abnormalities at discharge. 
1	Pelvic lipomatosis associated with cystitis glandularis and adenocarcinoma of the bladder. Pelvic lipomatosis is a rare condition characterized by an overgrowth of normal fat in the perivesical and perirectal spaces. Cystitis glandularis, cystica or follicularis has been observed in 75% of the patients with pelvic lipomatosis. Although cystitis glandularis is widely regarded as premalignant few reports have documented its transition to adenocarcinoma. We describe a 41-year-old man with pelvic lipomatosis in whom primary adenocarcinoma of the bladder developed 6 years after a histological diagnosis of cystitis cystica and glandularis was established. To our knowledge this is the second case reported of pelvic lipomatosis associated with proliferative cystitis and adenocarcinoma of the bladder, indicating that intestinal metaplasia of the urothelium may be a precursor of malignancy in these patients. 
5	Referral of patients with primary biliary cirrhosis for liver transplantation. All patients with primary biliary cirrhosis referred to this unit for consideration for transplantation between April 1981 and January 1989 were analysed retrospectively to assess whether disease stage at referral affects the outcome after grafting and whether greater awareness of the benefits of the procedure means that patients are now being referred at an earlier stage. Seventy of the 107 patients have been grafted, with an overall one year actuarial survival of 62%. A better prognosis at the time of referral, as assessed by both serum bilirubin concentration and a mathematically derived prognostic index, was associated with a greater probability of survival after grafting. Patients in the tertile with the best prognosis (median serum bilirubin concentration at referral 84 mumol/l and estimated survival in the absence of transplantation of more than nine months) had a 78% one year actuarial survival after transplantation, whereas those in the tertile with the worst prognosis (median serum bilirubin concentration 467 mumol/l and estimated survival of less than four months) had a one year actuarial survival of only 50%. No trend towards earlier referral of patients, however, was shown using either of these two markers. This retrospective analysis suggests that many patients are being referred too late for an optimal outcome. We recommend that patients with primary biliary cirrhosis who are potential candidates for liver grafting should be referred to a transplant centre before the serum bilirubin concentration approaches 150 mumol/l. 
2	Surgical options in postgastrectomy syndromes. The various operations performed for the treatment of peptic ulcer disease can lead to a variety of iatrogenic disorders collectively referred to as the "postgastrectomy syndromes." Although the etiology of most of these disorders remains unclear, loss of vagal innervation and bypass, ablation, or destruction of the pylorus clearly are involved in the pathogenesis of most, if not all, of these disorders. Unfortunately, there often is also a poorly understood psychological element involved in the pathogenesis. Of all ulcer operations, proximal gastric vagotomy results in the fewest physiologic abnormalities and the mildest postoperative symptoms. The continued popularity of this operation should effect a marked reduction in the incidence of disabling postgastrectomy syndromes. Fortunately, symptoms severe enough to necessitate remedial operation are uncommon, and conservative medical management is always indicated and usually suffices. When disabling symptoms are refractory, a thorough evaluation of the patient and an accurate classification of the syndrome are essential to guarantee a satisfactory result from surgical intervention. Although numerous surgical procedures have been developed to deal with the different syndromes, with varied results, the Roux-en-Y procedure has emerged as the operation of choice for most, if not all, postgastrectomy syndromes. However, the Roux-en-Y procedure has not been universally successful, and this operation can itself lead to the recently recognized postgastrectomy state of Roux-en-Y stasis syndrome. Prevention therefore remains the best form of therapy, and remedial operation should not be undertaken until adequate time has elapsed since the original operation and all forms of conservative treatment have failed. 
5	Femoral arteriovenous fistula as a complication of percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty. A report of five cases. Arteriovenous fistula (AVF) associated with invasive and diagnostic angiographic procedures is rare. The incidence is increased with procedures such as percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA) but is still quite low. We report five cases of AVF within a 17-month period, representing 0.15 per cent of all cardiac catheterizations and 0.87 per cent of PTCAs. All five patients presented with groin bruits. There were two associated pseudoaneurysms and one patient with deep vein thrombosis. All patients underwent uneventful division of the fistula. A thorough understanding of the anatomy of the femoral triangle is necessary in order to avoid this complication. That all fistulas were in the superficial or profunda femoris arteries emphasizes the importance of avoiding a low groin puncture. Early angiography and surgical intervention are recommended for optimal results. 
1	The glucose transporter and blood-brain barrier of human brain tumors. The glucose transporter of the human brain has been localized to endothelial cells expressing the blood-brain barrier, but little is known regarding its mechanism of induction or whether its expression is exclusively linked with restricted vascular permeability. We investigated glucose transporter expression by vessels in human astrocytic tumors and pulmonary metastases to the brain using immunohistochemical techniques. Vessels in 9 of 10 low-grade astrocytomas and 8 of 10 anaplastic astrocytomas were positive for glucose transporter. Glioblastoma vessels were transporter-positive in only 2 of 10 specimens. Vessels in all three metastatic tumors were negative for the glucose transporter. The decrease in transporter expression observed in higher-grade tumors occurred independently of increases in vascular permeability. In low-grade astrocytomas and glioblastomas transporter expression and contrast enhancement were inversely related, but vessels in 6 of 9 anaplastic astrocytomas were transporter-positive despite contrast enhancement. These findings suggest that separate mechanisms induce the glucose transporter and the permeability restrictions of the human blood-brain barrier. They also have potential implications for the therapy and prognosis of astroglial neoplasms. 
3	Transcranial electrical motor evoked potentials as a prognostic indicator for motor recovery in stroke patients. Transcranial electrical motor evoked potentials (MEP) were examined in 33 patients within three days after stroke. Normal values for MEP and motor central conduction time (CCT) were obtained in 46 healthy controls whose MEPs were evaluated during slight voluntary muscle contraction and at rest. Two months later 23 patients were re-examined clinically and electrophysiologically. Motor function change was correlated with MEP results. Two months after stroke the patients with normal or prolonged CCT had an improved motor function compared with those with absent CCT. MEP may be a valuable prognostic indicator in the acute stage of paralytic stroke for recovery of motor function. 
1	Pulmonary blastomas. Pulmonary blastoma is a rare lung tumor composed of immature mesenchyme and/or epithelium that morphologically mimics embryonal pulmonary structure. The prognosis of these tumors is poor, and the clinical course is not readily predicted from histologic appearance. In this report, the clinical, gross, microscopic, and immunopathologic features of 52 cases are described, and prognostically important correlates are determined. Twenty-eight patients were women, and 24 were men. There was a unimodal age peak in the fourth decade; only two patients were younger than 10 years old, and both had biphasic blastomas. Forty-one percent of patients were asymptomatic. Chest radiography typically showed a peripheral or midlung mass without predilection for any lobe. Microscopically, tumors could be divided into two classes: those composed solely of malignant glands of embryonal appearance (well-differentiated fetal adenocarcinomas [WDFA], 28 cases) and those with a biphasic appearance (24 cases). The malignant epithelium contained cytokeratin, carcinoembryonic antigen, milk fat globulin, and often chromogranin; vimentin, actin, and less frequently desmin and myoglobin were present in malignant stromal cells. More often WDFA was a smaller tumor (less than 5 cm) than biphasic tumors (P less than or equal to 0.001). It was more likely to be asymptomatic (P less than or equal to 0.001), and it was less likely to show pleural effusion by chest radiography (P less than or equal to 0.01) or giant or bizarre tumor cells (P less than or equal to 0.001) or frequent (greater than or equal to 30 mitoses/10 high-power fields) mitoses in the microscopic sections (P less than or equal to 0.01). Only 14% of patients with WDFA died of their tumor; 52% of patients with biphasic tumors died (mean follow-up, 97 months and 49 months, respectively). For patients with WDFA, the presence of thoracic adenopathy by chest radiography (P less than or equal to 0.001) and metastasis at initial presentation (P less than or equal to 0.001), followed by tumor recurrence (P less than or equal to 0.01), were the factors most highly correlated with poor prognosis. For patients with biphasic tumors, tumor recurrence (P less than or equal to 0.001) was the most significant indicator of poor prognosis, followed by metastasis at initial presentation (P less than or equal to 0.05) and gross size of the tumor (greater than or equal to 5 cm) (P less than or equal to 0.05). These findings support the idea that histologic class and gross and clinical findings can be of prognostic value in pulmonary blastoma. 
5	Obstructive sleep apnea presenting with nocturnal angina, heart failure, and near-miss sudden death. An obese woman with a one-year history of episodic nocturnal chest pain was admitted because of shock and pulmonary edema. A clinical diagnosis of acute myocardial infarction and cardiogenic shock was made. She was ventilated and successfully resuscitated. Subsequent investigations showed no evidence of cardiac dysfunction or coronary disease, but sleep study confirmed the diagnosis of obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (OSAS). We suggest that the nocturnal angina and heart failure in this patient might have resulted from extreme hypoxemia produced by OSAS. This case raised the possibility that the high cardiovascular mortality rate reported in OSAS might not necessarily relate to underlying coronary artery disease. Further investigations are required to delineate the true incidence of coronary disease in patients with OSAS. 
5	Central adenoid cystic carcinoma of the mandible. A patient with adenoid cystic carcinoma arising centrally within the mandible, a rare location for this malignant salivary gland tumor, is described. Current concepts regarding the etiology, diagnosis, histology, and treatment of central intramandibular salivary gland tumors are discussed and the literature is reviewed. 
5	Expression of HLA-DR and secretory component antigens and lymphocyte infiltration in human gastric nonmalignant and malignant tissues: an immunohistochemical study. The relation between HLA-DR and secretory component (SC) expression and the degree of lymphocyte infiltration was immunohistochemically examined in human gastric mucosa with or without intestinal metaplasia and gastric carcinoma tissues. Gastric mucosa without obvious inflammation showed neither expression of HLA-DR or SC nor remarkable lymphoid infiltration. In contrast, gastric mucosa with chronic inflammation, tissues with incomplete type of intestinal metaplasia, and carcinoma demonstrated both HLA-DR and SC in almost the same area and also prominent lymphoid infiltration in the surrounding stroma. This simultaneous expression of HLA-DR and SC was not observed in complete type of intestinal metaplasia. The results indicate a close relationship between expression of HLA-DR and SC and the presence of lymphocyte infiltration in gastric mucosa, areas of incomplete type of intestinal metaplasia and in gastric carcinomas. 
1	Elevated expression of the c-fes proto-oncogene in adult human myeloid leukemia cells in the absence of gene amplification. Expression of the 93-kd tyrosine kinase encoded by the human c-fes proto-oncogene (also known as FES) is restricted to mature hematopoietic cells of the granulocytic and monocytic lineages, suggestive of a function essential to normal myeloid differentiation. However, recent studies have shown that c-fes can transform fibroblasts if sufficient levels of gene expression are achieved. These findings indicate that strict regulation of the c-fes gene is critical to normal myeloid development, whereas elevated c-fes expression may contribute to malignant transformation. In the present study, we compared the c-fes messenger RNA (mRNA) levels in leukemia blasts from patients with myeloid or lymphoid leukemia with those of peripheral monocytes from a normal donor with the use of a quantitative ribonuclease protection assay. The presence of c-fes mRNA was readily detected in both acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) cells, but c-fes mRNA was present in low levels or was absent in lymphoid leukemia cells. The leukemia cells of two of five AML patients and four of four CML patients expressed more c-fes mRNA than monocytes from a normal donor, with more than a threefold elevation in the cells of one CML patient. No evidence of amplification or rearrangement of the c-fes gene was detectable by Southern blot analysis of myeloid leukemia DNA, suggesting that the variation in c-fes mRNA levels are related to differences in transcriptional activity and/or message stability. These results indicate that elevated c-fes expression is a common feature of myeloid leukemia cells that could potentially contribute to the leukemia phenotype. 
4	Continuous electrocardiographic monitoring in hypertensive crises in pregnancy. Twenty-four patients first seen with hypertensive crises during pregnancy were studied by continuous electrocardiographic monitoring for a period of 24 hours to detect the presence of serious ventricular arrhythmias. Three patients were excluded from analysis because of low serum potassium levels. Thirteen of the remaining 21 patients had ventricular tachycardia on subsequent analysis of the electrocardiogram. These arrhythmias subsided after induction of anesthesia when blood pressure control was optimal. This finding may be implicated in the pathogenesis of pulmonary edema and sudden death in these patients. 
5	Lateral temporal bone resections. Eighteen consecutive patients underwent a lateral temporal bone resection for the treatment of tumors originating in the auricle, the external auditory canal, the periauricular skin, or the parotid and were retrospectively analyzed. The different lateral temporal bone resections performed have been categorized into four types. The type I resection consists of the removal of the tympanic bone and the external auditory canal lateral to the tympanic membrane. The type II resection consists of the removal of the entire tympanic bone, the tympanic membrane, the incus, and the malleus, preserving the facial nerve and the inner ear. Type III resections remove, in addition to the those structures removed in type II resections, the distal facial nerve and fallopian canal, the mastoid tip, the styloid process, and the stylomastoid foramen. The type IV resection consists of the removal of only the mastoid tip and the inferior portion of the tympanic bone. When the techniques of lateral temporal bone resection are used appropriately, adequate surgical treatment of patients with selected advanced and recurrent malignant tumors of the external ear, the periauricular skin, and the parotid is possible with low morbidity and a high probability of local regional control. 
5	The Oxford knee replacement. A review from an independent centre. We present a study of 67 Oxford bicompartmental total knee replacements performed at a district general hospital. In this general orthopaedic unit, 57 of the knees (85%) had significant relief of pain with a mean flexion range of 95 degrees and a mean flexion deformity of only 9 degrees. There was a noticeable difference between osteoarthritic and rheumatoid knees. Poor results could be directly related to an avoidable postoperative complication. The results of this independent assessment may be compared favourably with the previously published series from the specialist centre at which the prosthesis was designed. 
1	Enhanced hepatic drug clearance in patients with cystic fibrosis. To examine whether hepatic drug metabolism is altered in patients with cystic fibrosis (CF), we evaluated the pharmacokinetics of three model pharmacologic substrates (antipyrine, a marker of hepatic oxidative metabolism; lorazepam, a marker of hepatic glucuronosyltransferase activity; and indocyanine green (ICG), a marker of hepatic blood flow and biliary secretion) in 14 patients with CF (14.6 to 29.2 years of age) and in 12 children and adolescents with cancer (7.2 to 19.4 years of age), which was treated with only surgery and radiation. Each study subject received a single intravenous dose of the combined model substrates (0.03 mg/kg lorazepam, 10 mg/kg antipyrine, and 0.5 mg/kg ICG) for 5 minutes, followed by repeated blood sampling (n = 10) during a 24-hour postinfusion period. Patients with CF had a significantly greater plasma clearance of lorazepam (56.5 +/- 5.2 vs 25.9 +/- 1.9 ml/min/m2) and ICG (892.5 +/- 176.4 vs 256.5 +/- 41.7 ml/min/m2) but not of antipyrine (27.2 +/- 3.8 vs 20.7 +/- 2.0 ml/min/m2) in comparison with control subjects. The apparent steady-state volume of distribution for lorazepam, ICG, and antipyrine was significantly higher in the patients with CF (2.0-, 3.1-, and 1.4-fold, respectively) than in control subjects. Clearance of the model substrates did not correlate with standard biochemical markers of hepatic function. Similarly, no significant relationships were observed between the clearance or steady-state volume of distribution of the compounds and the National Institutes of Health prognostic scores for the patients with CF. These data demonstrate that the plasma clearance of lorazepam and ICG is increased in patients with CF and suggest that hepatic glucuronosyltransferase activity and biliary secretory capacity are enhanced in this disease. 
3	Genetics of cerebrovascular disease. Stroke is a complex disease, with both genetic and environmental factors having a role in its pathogenesis. A review of past studies shows some evidence of genetic influences in the development of stroke. This is supported by studies of cardiovascular disease, which indicate major genetic influences at several levels including the development of risk factors. New approaches to phenotypic classifications, patient ascertainment, and genetic analysis will stimulate research into the role of genetics in cerebrovascular disease. 
5	Temporary cardiac pacing using a new, steerable, balloon-tipped pacing catheter. A new balloon-tipped, flow-directed, steerable pacing catheter for unipolar temporary ventricular pacing is presented. It was successfully and uneventfully tested in 25 patients with acute myocardial infarction in the coronary care unit. The main advantage of the new catheter is the ease with which a stable contact may be achieved between the pacing electrode and the endocardium. 
5	Clinical-physiologic correlations in acute asthma of childhood. Seventy-one patients who presented to the emergency room with acute asthma were evaluated to determine the relationship between common clinical signs and spirometric and transcutaneous arterial oxygen saturation (SaO2) measurements. Prior to treatment, a physical examination was performed, a clinical score assigned, and pulmonary function and SaO2 were measured. Although forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) and SaO2 had strong correlation with the overall clinical score (r2 = .47, .49 respectively), many patients with low clinical scores and apparent mild clinical disease had low FEV1 values (as low as 20% predicted). Of the individual components of the clinical score (ie, heart rate, respiratory rate, pulsus paradoxus, accessory muscle use, dyspnea, and wheezing), the degree of accessory muscle use correlated most closely with lung function followed by the degree of dyspnea and wheezing. Similarly, the degree of accessory muscle use correlated most closely with SaO2 followed by dyspnea and respiratory rate. Significant correlation (r2 = .59) was found between SaO2 and FEV1, although the range of SaO2 value for a given FEV1 was wide and some patients with low FEV1 values had normal SaO2 values. These results show that although clinically apparent severe disease and hypoxemia were always associated with low FEV1, their absence does not exclude the presence of airflow obstruction. It is concluded that for the optimal evaluation of acute asthma in children in the emergency room, clinical evaluation should be used in conjunction with objective laboratory measurements. 
4	Myocardial amiodarone and desethylamiodarone concentrations in patients undergoing cardiac transplantation. Myocardial amiodarone and desethylamiodarone concentrations were measured at multiple sites in the explanted heart in four patients who underwent cardiac transplantation. Patients were taking amiodarone, 200 to 400 mg/day (mean 300 +/- 115), for 88 to 428 days (mean 229 +/- 148). The mean cumulative dose was 58 +/- 21.3 g. Plasma amiodarone concentration in three subjects was 204, 312 and 419 ng/ml and desethylamiodarone concentration was 268, 513 and 880 ng/ml, respectively. Significant interindividual variability in myocardial concentrations of amiodarone and desethylamiodarone was observed (p less than 0.05). Mean myocardial amiodarone concentration ranged from 4 +/- 1.0 to 29 +/- 17.2 micrograms/g (p less than 0.05); mean desethylamiodarone concentration ranged from 22 +/- 8.8 to 141 +/- 102.5 micrograms/g (p less than 0.05). At each site, save for fat, myocardial desethylamiodarone concentration was higher than amiodarone concentration. Greater intraindividual variability was observed in myocardial desethylamiodarone compared with amiodarone concentration particularly in septal and scar tissue (p = NS). No significant relation was found between myocardial concentration and duration of treatment. In patients with significant ventricular disease, usefulness of plasma amiodarone and desethylamiodarone concentration to estimate myocardial concentration is limited by intra- and interindividual variability. 
5	A comparison of surfactant as immediate prophylaxis and as rescue therapy in newborns of less than 30 weeks' gestation BACKGROUND. Exogenous pulmonary surfactants are administered into the trachea either to prevent respiratory distress syndrome in premature infants or to treat it. In a randomized, multicenter trial, we compared the results of surfactant therapy initiated as prophylaxis with the results of rescue therapy with surfactant. METHODS. Before birth, 479 infants with an estimated gestational age of less than 30 weeks were randomly assigned to receive surfactant as prophylaxis (n = 235) or rescue therapy (n = 244). The infants in the prophylaxis group received a 90-mg intratracheal dose of an exogenous calf-lung surfactant extract at the time of delivery, whereas the infants in the rescue-therapy group received 90 mg of the surfactant several hours after delivery if the fractional inspiratory oxygen concentration was at least 0.40 or if the mean airway pressure was at least 0.686 kPa (7 cm of water), or both. Infants in both groups received additional doses of surfactant at intervals of 12 to 24 hours if these criteria were met. RESULTS. The proportion of infants surviving until discharge to their homes was significantly higher in the prophylaxis group than in the rescue-therapy group (88 vs. 80 percent, P = 0.028). This difference was due primarily to the longer survival of very premature infants (less than or equal to 26 weeks' gestation) in the prophylaxis group than in the rescue-therapy group (75 vs. 54 percent, P = 0.006). According to proportional-hazards regression analysis, the distribution of survival times was better for all infants in the prophylaxis group (P = 0.007) and for the subgroup of infants in the prophylaxis group who were delivered at 26 weeks' gestation or earlier (P = 0.0048). Infants in the prophylaxis group who were delivered at 26 weeks' gestation or earlier had a lower incidence of pneumothorax than similar infants in the rescue-therapy group (7 vs. 18 percent, P = 0.03). CONCLUSIONS. We found a significant advantage to the administration of the initial dose of surfactant as prophylaxis rather than as rescue therapy in very premature infants. 
1	Leukemia and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma and residential proximity to industrial plants. The risks of developing leukemia and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma from living near industrial facilities were evaluated among men from Iowa and Minnesota in a population-based, case-control study. We found a statistically significant increase in the risk of developing non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (RR = 1.4) and a slight, nonsignificant excess for leukemia (RR = 1.2) among individuals who lived .8-3.2 km (1/2-2 miles) from a factory. Risks were greater for certain histologic types: follicular lymphoma (RR = 1.5), acute lymphocytic leukemia (RR = 5.4), and acute myelocytic leukemia (RR = 2.2). For non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (but not for leukemia), the relative risks for those living within .8 km (1/2 mile) of a factory were similar or slightly larger than for those living .8-3.2 km (1/2-2 miles) from a factory. Risks did not increase with duration of residence near a factory. The elevated risks of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma were particularly associated with residing near stone, clay, or glass industry facilities. The risk of developing leukemia was greater among persons who resided near chemical and petroleum plants. These preliminary findings raise the possibility that general environmental exposure associated with certain industrial activities may elevate the risk of developing leukemia and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. Evaluation of data on proximity to industrial plants from studies in other geographic locations is needed to determine whether our results represent a meaningful association. 
5	Hepatic histological findings after transplantation for chronic hepatitis B virus infection, including a unique pattern of fibrosing cholestatic hepatitis. Long-term follow-up of 27 patients with hepatitis B virus-related chronic liver disease treated by transplantation showed that 23 had hepatitis B virus recurrence. In 13 patients late changes in the grafts were similar to those described in other series: minor abnormalities in five cases, chronic active hepatitis in five cases and non-hepatitis B virus-related graft dysfunction in three cases. Three patients had incomplete histological follow-up. Analysis of the histological changes and viral antigen expression in six cases revealed a distinct and novel pattern termed fibrosing cholestatic hepatitis. Development of fibrosing cholestatic hepatitis was associated with rapidly progressive graft dysfunction. It is postulated that this pattern of fibrosing cholestatic hepatitis develops because of a high cytoplasmic expression of viral antigens, including HBsAg. The remaining case had some features of fibrosing cholestatic hepatitis. The main histological features of this unique syndrome include thin, perisinusoidal bands of fibrosis extending from portal tracts to surround plates of ductular-type epithelium; prominent cholestasis; ground-glass transformation; and ballooning of hepatocytes with cell loss and mild mixed inflammatory reaction. 
5	Laparoscopic cholecystectomy: an initial report. Sixty consecutive patients underwent an elective attempt at laparoscopic cholecystectomy between March 15 and July 31, 1990 at the Mount Sinai Hospital in New York. Fifty-two patients had successful completion of the laparoscopic cholecystectomy (87%). The reasons for conversion to open cholecystectomy were acute cholecystitis (four patients), inability to define the cystic duct-common duct junction (three patients), and one patient with an unexpected choledochal cyst variant. Forty patients (77%) were discharged on the first post-operative day, and the remaining 12 patients on the second post-operative day. Thirty-three patients (63%) required only oral pain medication, and 11 patients (21%) needed no pain medication post-operatively. Fifty-one patients (98%) had resumed normal activities by the seventh post-operative day. Cholecystectomy remains the treatment of choice for biliary colic. Laparoscopic cholecystectomy minimizes length of stay in the hospital, lessens post-operative pain, allows quicker return to normal activities, and has a superior cosmetic result. 
5	A prognostic system for transient ischemia or minor stroke. OBJECTIVE: To build a prognostic system for patients with carotid transient ischemic attack or minor stroke. DESIGN: Inception cohort study with 2-year follow-up. SETTING: Urban community teaching hospital. PATIENTS: Eligible patients (n = 142), identified on a carotid ultrasound roster, had been hospitalized between 1984 and 1987 within 30 days of a first carotid transient ischemic attack or minor stroke. MEASUREMENTS: Stroke or death within 2 years. MAIN RESULTS: Three factors were associated with stroke or death: age of more than 65 years, diabetes, and hypertension. Based on regression coefficients, age of more than 65 years was assigned 3 points; diabetes, 3 points; and hypertension, 2 points. An initial prognostic system comprised risk groups 1 (0 points), 2 (1 to 5 points), and 3 (6 to 8 points). Outcome rates in the three groups were 2%, 31%, and 54% (P less than 0.0001), respectively. In an independent test sample, the corresponding outcome rates for the initial system were 12%, 21%, and 31% (P = 0.04). A final prognostic system, including two additional predictors (coronary heart disease [1 point] and the distinction between stroke and transient ischemic attack for the baseline event [2 points]), comprised risk groups 1 (0 to 2 points), 2 (3 to 6 points), and 3 (7 to 11 points). Corresponding outcome rates were 3%, 27%, and 48% (P less than 0.001) in the original cohort and 10%, 21%, and 59% (P less than 0.001) in the test cohort. CONCLUSION: For selected patients with carotid transient ischemia or minor stroke, five clinical features can be combined to stratify effectively the risk for a subsequent stroke or death. 
5	Multimodal therapy for the management of primary, nonmetastatic Ewing's sarcoma of bone: a long-term follow-up of the First Intergroup study. A total of 342 previously untreated eligible children were entered into the first Intergroup Ewing's Sarcoma Study (IESS) between May 1973 and November 1978. In group I institutions, patients were randomized between treatment 1 (radiotherapy to primary lesion plus cyclophosphamide, vincristine, dactinomycin, and Adriamycin [doxorubicin; Adria Laboratories, Columbus, OH] [VAC plus ADR]) or treatment 2 (same as treatment 1 without ADR), and group II institutions randomized patients between treatment 2 or treatment 3 (same as treatment 2 plus bilateral pulmonary radiotherapy [VAC plus BPR]). The percentages of patients relapse-free and surviving (RFS) at 5 years for treatments 1, 2, and 3 were 60%, 24%, and 44%, respectively. There was strong statistical evidence of a significant advantage in RFS for treatment 1 (VAC plus ADR) versus 2 (VAC alone) (P less than .001) and 3 (P less than .05) and also of treatment 3 versus 2 (P less than .001). Similar significant results were observed with respect to overall survival. Patients with disease at pelvic sites have significantly poorer survival at 5 years than those with disease at nonpelvic sites (34% v 57%; P less than .001). Among pelvic cases, there was no evidence of differing survival by treatment (P = .81), but among nonpelvic cases, there was strong evidence of differing survival by treatment (P less than .001). The overall percentage of patients developing metastatic disease was 44%; the percentages by treatments 1, 2, and 3 were 30%, 72%, and 42%, respectively. The overall incidence of local recurrence was 15%, and there was no evidence that local recurrence rate differed by treatment. Patient characteristics related to prognosis, both with respect to RFS and overall survival experience, were primary site (nonpelvic patients were most favorable) and patient age (younger patients were more favorable). 
1	Single cell levels of hypothalamic messenger ribonucleic acid encoding luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone in intact, castrated, and hyperprolactinemic male rats. We have examined the changes that occur in neuronal expression of LHRH mRNA in response to castration and hyperprolactinemia in male rats. Single cell levels of LHRH mRNA were determined by quantitative in situ hybridization histochemistry using an 35S-labeled synthetic 48-base oligodeoxynucleotide probe and quantitative autoradiography. Nine days postcastration, a 10.4-fold increase in mean plasma LH titers was observed which was associated with significantly increased LHRH mRNA in rostral hypothalamic neuronal cell bodies. Both increases were blocked in rats rendered hyperprolactinemic by the presence of the 7315a PRL-secreting pituitary tumor. The location and number of neurons expressing LHRH mRNA were unchanged, indicating that these differences were attributable to amounts of mRNA expressed per neuron. Experimental differences occurred in LHRH perikarya situated throughout the rostral hypothalamus from the organum vasculosum of the lamina terminalis to the caudal extent of the medial preoptic nucleus. These results suggest that gonadal steroids and PRL are involved, either directly or indirectly, in regulating the biosynthesis of LHRH in the rostral hypothalamus. 
5	Pivotal role of early and sustained infarct vessel patency in patients with acute myocardial infarction. Thrombolytic therapy in acute myocardial infarction unequivocally has improved short- and long-term mortality. The fundamental goal of therapy for evolving myocardial infarction is early and sustained infarct vessel recanalization. The mechanisms linking an open artery with improved long-term survival and other clinical outcomes are presented with use of data from extensive clinical trials. 
1	Rapid diagnosis of lung cancer from palpable metastases by needle thrust. This study encourages the use of percutaneous FNB to diagnose and stage advanced lung cancer in patients with palpable metastases in supraclavicular lymph nodes or soft tissues. Percutaneous FNB of metastases is much easier to learn than transthoracic needle aspiration: the superficial target is anchored and sampled with multiple passes using a short needle grasped directly in the fingers. It is fast, accurate, economical and nearly free of risk and pain. The technique saves time and money because it is the only procedure needed by many patients with palpable disease in stage IIIB and IV. Bronchoscopy, transthoracic needle aspiration and open surgical biopsy thus can be avoided in most patients with palpable metastases. Prompt diagnosis by FNB of metastases speeds palliation for patients with urgent need. Tumor cell type from FNB correlated with cytologic findings from sputum samples, bronchoscopy specimens and autopsy results. 
5	An extracorporeal perfusion system to bridge pediatric liver transplant candidates. An extracorporeal liver perfusion system was designed to maintain cadaver livers in an oxygenated, normothermic state for bridging procedures for hepatic transplantation. Nonpulsatile high flow and pulsatile low flow blood are supplied to the portal venous (PV) and hepatic arterial (HA) circulations. Controlled low blood flow (5-10 cc/kg [patient]/min) is exchanged between the high flow extracorporeal perfusion circuit (1 cc/g [liver]/min) and the patient. The system was evaluated in perfusions of fresh, excised pig livers (n = 5). The average oxygen consumption was 9 +/- 3 microliters/g/min, and bile production averaged 4.7 microliters/g/hr. Perfusion pressures and flows were normal in both the HA and PV circulations for about 4 hr. Pressures then gradually rose, especially in the HA circulation, causing flow to decrease, with subsequent mottling and discoloration of the liver. Red blood cell, platelet, and white blood cell counts fell continuously. Maintenance of liver function was assessed by clearance of an 80 mg taurocholic acid challenge. An average of 56% of injected acid was cleared from the perfused livers (n = 5) in the first half hour, compared with 90% and 25% for the in situ (n = 3) and unperfused (n = 3) control livers, respectively. The system consistently maintained livers in a moderately well functioning state through the first 4 hr of perfusion. Adequate support of animals with induced hepatic failure must now be demonstrated. 
1	Immune-competent cells of regional lymph nodes in colorectal cancer patients: II. Immunohistochemical analysis of Leu-7+ cells. Distribution of Leu-7+ cells in cancer tissues and regional lymph nodes was immunohistochemically examined to estimate the role of NK cells in colorectal cancer patients. Leu-7+ cells were rarely observed both in the primary and distant metastatic lesions, but the number of these cells was large in the germinal center of the lymph nodes. Studies of Leu-7+ cell population in the lymph node indicated that intermediate nodes in n0 and n1 groups showed significantly higher values than those in the control group. Comparative study of the population in identical patients revealed a significantly higher rate in the intermediate nodes than in the paracolic nodes both in n0 and n1 groups. These data suggest that Leu-7+ cells might be related to the defense mechanism of regional lymph nodes against tumor. 
4	From the parallel group design to the crossover design, and from the group approach to the individual approach. The consequences of heterogeneity in response to antihypertensive drugs for the clinical development programs of new antihypertensive drugs and for the care of the individual hypertensive patient have not previously been sufficiently recognized. They play a role in the inappropriate choice of too-high daily doses of some antihypertensive drugs at the end of extensive international development programs. They are also implicated in the insufficient control of blood pressure observed in the long-term multicenter trials in hypertension, where some patients have been treated for several years with drugs that were not the most appropriate for their disease and which did not adequately control their blood pressure. In addition to the parallel group studies, the use of double-blind two-period or multiple period crossover designs can provide valid data for the dose-finding of new antihypertensive drugs and their comparative evaluation. At the end of the trial, these designs also offer each patient the opportunity to be treated with the right dose of the drug most appropriate for his or her disease. 
4	Relation between sodium intake, renal function, and the regulation of arterial pressure. The long-term regulation of arterial pressure requires the maintenance of a balance between sodium and water intake and sodium and water excretion. Normal salt and water balance leads to stable body fluid volumes and the maintenance of normal renal function is critical to establishing extracellular fluid volume homeostasis. This review focuses on the role of the kidney in the long-term control of salt and water balance with particular emphasis on the relations between sodium intake, the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, renal sympathetic nerve activity, and the regulation of arterial pressure via renal sodium and water excretion. The accumulation of evidence in recent years demonstrates that low level elevation of renin release, circulating angiotensin II or aldosterone, or activation of renal sympathetic outflow may alter renal function such that normal natriuretic and diuretic responses to arterial pressure are significantly impeded. Under these circumstances, the maintenance of normal sodium and water excretion requires a significant elevation of arterial pressure. Thus, compromised renal function leads to elevation of arterial pressure to maintain adequate sodium and water balance during periods of increased sodium intake. The resultant chronic elevation of arterial pressure then becomes a compromise that is used by the kidneys to maintain normal extracellular body fluid volumes. 
3	Orbital intramuscular schwannoma. In an 8-year-old girl with asymptomatic proptosis, computed tomographic scans showed a large medial orbital mass that contoured the globe anteriorly, bowed the optic nerve laterally, and extended posteriorly to the orbital apex. T1-weighted coronal magnetic resonance images showed the mass to be a diffusely enlarged medial rectus muscle. Histopathologic examination of a medial rectus muscle biopsy specimen disclosed a multinodular, intramuscular schwannoma, separating and infiltrating normal skeletal muscle fibers. The intramuscular location and multinodular configuration of this tumor, together with its occurrence in a child, distinguish it from previous orbital schwannomas. 
5	Progression of human papillomavirus type 18-immortalized human keratinocytes to a malignant phenotype. We have developed a model system for progression of human epithelial cells to malignancy, using a human papillomavirus type 18 (HPV-18)-immortalized human keratinocyte cell line. Cells of cell line FEP-1811 were nontumorigenic in athymic mice through at least 12 passages in culture, but after 32 passages were weakly tumorigenic, producing tumors that regressed. After 62 passages they produced invasive squamous cell carcinomas that grew progressively. The progression to malignancy was associated with an increase in the efficiency of forming colonies in soft agar and with altered differentiation properties. In an organotypic culture system, FEP-1811 cells at passages 12 and 32 exhibited features typical of premalignant intraepithelial neoplasia in vivo, and cells at passage 68 exhibited features consistent with squamous cell carcinomas. No change in copy number of the transfected HPV-18 genome or in the level of expression of the viral transforming gene products E6 and E7 was detected between tumorigenic and nontumorigenic cells. Cytogenetic analysis of cells at early, middle, and late passage levels and cells cultured from tumors revealed that several chromosomal abnormalities segregated with the tumorigenic cell populations. 
5	Results of treatment of persistent hyperplastic primary vitreous. The records of 48 patients with persistent hyperplastic primary vitreous (PHPV) were reviewed. Approximately 17% had vision of 20/100 or better after surgery, contact lens fitting, and amblyopia therapy. Only eyes with a purely anterior presentation had successful visual outcomes. Lensectomy alone prevented glaucoma, but a membranectomy as well was required to ensure a successful visual result. Eyes with a posterior PHPV had poor visual results because of posterior pole abnormalities. I recommend that an attempt be made to visually salvage eyes with an anterior presentation. Eyes with a posterior or a combination anterior-posterior PHPV can be successfully treated for glaucoma, but the visual results will be poor. 
3	Tumor necrosis factor and severe malaria. To investigate the relation of tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF alpha) to Plasmodium falciparum infection, plasma TNF alpha concentrations were measured in Zairian children with severe malaria, mild malaria, or other illnesses. The initial geometric mean plasma concentration of TNF alpha among 61 children with P. falciparum infection, (71 pg/ml) was higher than the level in 26 severely ill, aparasitemic children (10 pg/ml; P less than .001). Among 29 parasitemic children, initial geometric mean TNF alpha levels decreased from 77 to 5 pg/ml (P less than .001) at day 7. TNF alpha levels increased with parasite density and were associated with hyperparasitemia, severe anemia, hypoglycemia, and young age but not with cerebral malaria or fatal outcome. However, TNF alpha levels were elevated equally in children with cerebral malaria and with other signs of severe malaria. With multiple linear regression, TNF alpha levels were elevated independently in children with hyperparasitemia (P = .001) and severe anemia (P = .04). In this study, high TNF alpha levels were associated with several manifestations of severe malaria and were not specific to cerebral malaria. 
4	Relation of central obesity and insulin resistance with high diabetes prevalence and cardiovascular risk in South Asians. The hypothesis that the high mortality from coronary heart disease (CHD) in South Asians settled overseas compared with other populations is due to metabolic disturbances related to insulin resistance was tested in a population survey of 3193 men and 561 women aged 40-69 years in London, UK. The sample was assembled from industrial workforces and general practitioners' lists. In comparison with the European group, the South Asian group had a higher prevalence of diabetes (19% vs 4%), higher blood pressures, higher fasting and post-glucose serum insulin concentrations, higher plasma triglyceride, and lower HDL cholesterol concentrations. Mean waist-hip girth ratios and trunk skinfolds were higher in the South Asian than in the European group. Within each ethnic group waist-hip ratio was correlated with glucose intolerance, insulin, blood pressure, and triglyceride. These results confirm the existence of an insulin resistance syndrome, prevalent in South Asian populations and associated with a pronounced tendency to central obesity in this group. Control of obesity and greater physical activity offer the best chances for prevention of diabetes and CHD in South Asian people. 
3	Arterial abnormalities of the hand in athletes. Vascular lesions of the hand may be seen in athletes exposed to repetitive blunt trauma. Thirteen athletes seen from 1983 to 1988 experienced symptoms related to hand ischemia. Nine were professional baseball catchers. The majority of patients complained of chronic symptoms, including cold hypersensitivity (four patients), finger numbness (one), finger coolness (three), and finger blanching (three). Two patients had acute symptoms with sudden posttraumatic hand ischemia with finger and palmar pain. Diagnosis was established by history and physical examination and confirmed by noninvasive testing. Testing included use of Doppler examination and cold tolerance examination with thermistors. Two athletes required angiographic evaluation because of severe ischemia and continuous pain. All patients in this group were managed nonoperatively. Those with chronic complaints were counseled regarding cold avoidance and instructed to increase their glove padding. The two patients with acute symptoms required vasodilator (papaverine chloride) infusion, followed by intravenous heparin and dextran. All baseball catchers returned to their sport with dissipation of symptoms. 
5	Comparison of epidurally administered sufentanil, morphine, and sufentanil-morphine combination for postoperative analgesia. Postoperative analgesia provided by epidurally administered sufentanil and/or morphine was evaluated in 45 patients recovering from major gynecologic surgery. At the first complaint of pain in the Postanesthesia Care Unit, patients received a single epidural bolus of 30 micrograms sufentanil (group A), 5 mg morphine (group B), or 30 micrograms sufentanil plus 3 mg morphine (group C) in a randomized blinded fashion. Analgesic efficacy was assessed throughout the 24-h study period with 10-cm visual analog scales. The need for additional postoperative analgesia (patient-controlled analgesia, 1 mg of morphine every 6 min as necessary) and the incidence of adverse effects were also assessed. Patients receiving sufentanil (groups A and C) had significantly faster onset of analgesia than did patients given morphine alone (group B, P less than 0.05). Group B subjects experienced the longest duration of analgesia (B vs A and C, P less than 0.05) and required significantly less patient-controlled analgesia (morphine) than patients in group A (P less than 0.05). No patient developed clinically significant respiratory depression or excessive sedation, and there were no intergroup differences in incidence of pruritus or nausea (P value not significant). The data indicate that a mixture of sufentanil and morphine provides either a more rapid onset of epidural analgesia or reduced patient-controlled analgesia narcotic requirement than respective doses of each agent administered alone. 
5	Isolated ventral pancreatitis in a patient with pancreas divisum. A previously healthy 22-yr-old woman was found to have chronic pancreatitis restricted to the ventral pancreas in association with pancreas divisum. When conservative treatment failed, sphincteroplasty of both papillae was performed with good results. This well-documented case represents a clear exception to the commonly held concept that obstruction of the dorsal duct is the essential pathogenic factor in the development of pancreatitis associated with pancreas divisum. The importance of visualizing both the dorsal and ventral pancreatic ducts to direct therapy for patients with idiopathic pancreatitis is discussed. Theories of the pathogenesis of concomitant pancreatitis and pancreas divisum are reviewed. 
1	Surgical strategy in thyroid disease. Over the past 8 years, 311 patients have undergone surgical treatment by the senior authors for thyroid disease. Over 80% of the cases were performed by the head and neck surgical service at Olive View County Hospital, Sylmar, Calif, with the remainder performed at UCLA-affiliated institutions. This service is an important source of thyroid surgical training for UCLA head and neck residents who rotate through this major affiliate. The purpose of this communication is to review our experience with these cases; to describe our overall surgical strategy; and to detail the specifics of our surgical procedure, which we have developed to safely train residents in the treatment of these challenging cases. This article deals with the specific problems of preservation of the recurrent nerve, the parathyroid glands, and the techniques for reimplantation of injured parathyroid glands; the management of larger, substernal thyroid glands; and our techniques for partial thyroid surgery. In addition, the difficult decisions in the management of thyroid cancer, such as completion thyroidectomy; the management of lymph node mestastases; and how tracheal, esophageal, or laryngeal invasion should be managed are discussed. An initial section describing the general preoperative examination of these patients is also included, so that the proper surgical strategy can be developed prior to entering the operating room. 
4	Bronchial hyperreactivity in patients with mitral valve disease. To elicit the mechanism of bronchial hyperreactivity (BHR) in chronic heart failure (CHF), a methacholine inhalation test, pulmonary function test, and cardiac catheterization were performed in 19 patients with mitral valve disease (MVD), and the change of severity of BHR before and after mitral valve replacement (MVR) was also examined in seven of 19 patients with MVD. Sixteen of 19 patients with MVD showed significant increase in respiratory resistance in methacholine inhalation test, while all normal subjects did not. The maximal expiratory flow at 25 percent of vital capacity (Vmax25), a parameter of small airway disease, correlated significantly with log cumulative dose producing a 35 percent decrease in respiratory conductance (PD35Grs) (r = 0.536) and the duration of symptoms (r = -0.682). There was a significant correlation between log PD35Grs and mean pulmonary artery wedge pressure (r = -0.466). After MVR, log PD35Grs was significantly improved in all seven operated-on patients, although six patients retained BHR. We conclude that patients with long-term MVD have marked BHR and that BHR in long-term MVD is related to peripheral airway narrowing with organic remodeling, which was not ameliorated with MVR procedure, in addition to pulmonary congestion. 
3	Cerebral blood flow and oxygen metabolism in patients with vascular dementia of the Binswanger type. We performed clinical and neuroradiologic studies, including positron emission tomography, in five patients with vascular dementia of the Binswanger type. The clinical features of these cases consisted of slowly progressive dementia, together with vascular risk factors such as hypertension and often a history of minor stroke, and characteristic white matter lesions on brain computed tomograms or magnetic resonance images. Digital subtraction angiography of the cervical and intracranial arteries demonstrated no occlusive lesion in any patient. Both cerebral blood flow and the cerebral metabolic rate for oxygen were markedly reduced in the white matter (54-77% of control values), and both were decreased in the parietal (73% of control), frontal (74-80%), and temporal (74-83%) cortices, where no abnormalities were detected by brain computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging. We conclude that vascular dementia of the Binswanger type may be caused by disconnection between the cerebral cortex and subcortical structures due to ischemic damage in the white matter. 
1	Trends in primary breast cancer management. Where are we going? The treatment of cancer during any period has been based not on the whim of a clinician but on the therapeutic consequences of the dominant biologic model of the disease. Until the 1960s, the dominant model of breast cancer was of a disease that spread centrifugally along anatomic pathways, with time being the only determinant of prognosis. An alternative model, that of biologic determinism, posits that the outcomes of treatment are determined by the extent of microscopic dissemination that occurred before the tumor became detectable. This model, too, has flaws, and the author suggests that it is time for a Kuhnian paradigm shift. Breast cancer exhibits a heterogeneity of phenotypes resulting from one or perhaps two mutations. The multiple prognostic variables may be epiphenomena, expressing different degrees of amplification of a limited domain of the genome. 
5	Precipitated abstinence in orally dosed benzodiazepine-dependent dogs. The ability of graded doses of flumazenil (2, 6, 18, 36 and 72 mg/kg) and a lactose placebo to precipitate abstinence was studied in dogs treated chronically with diazepam, nordiazepam, flunitrazepam, alprazolam, oxazepam, halazepam and lorazepam by oral dosing. A scale comprised of 10 precipitated abstinence signs, the Benzodiazepine Precipitated Abstinence Scale, was developed, which yielded linear flumazenil log-dose response lines with significant slopes in dogs dependent on diazepam, nordiazepam and flunitrazepam. The effects of 18, 36 and 72 mg/kg of flumazenil in otherwise drug naive dogs were studied. In naive dogs, the most prominent effect of flumazenil was to reduce activity. All benzodiazepines studied produced dependence that was characterized by signs of precipitated abstinence; however, the intensity and quality of abstinence varied from one benzodiazepine to another. Precipitated abstinence in dogs treated chronically with diazepam and flunitrazepam was characterized by a dose-related increase in clonic convulsions and Benzodiazepine Precipitated Abstinence Scale scores. This pattern differed from that seen in nordiazepam- and alprazolam-dependent dogs, which showed a comparable flumazenil dose-related increase in clonic convulsion but only a modest increase in Benzodiazepine Precipitated Abstinence Scale scores. Oxazepam and lorazepam produced dependence that was less intense than that seen with the other benzodiazepines. Plasma levels of the benzodiazepines and their metabolites were repeatedly determined after single doses and during addiction cycles. Nordiazepam accumulated in diazepam- and nordiazepam-dependent dogs and alpha-OH alprazolam accumulated in alprazolam-dependent dogs. Other drugs and metabolites did not. These observations suggest that: 1) different benzodiazepines or their metabolites produce different types of physical dependence, suggesting that they or their metabolites have different mechanisms and sites of action; 2) plasma cumulation of the benzodiazepines or their active metabolites is an important factor in the genesis of physical dependence; and 3) metabolism of benzodiazepines plays an important role in their dependence-producing capacity, and because of differences in the way species metabolize benzodiazepines, the type of dependence produced in different species may differ. 
5	"Spontaneous sump syndrome": Successful treatment by duodenoscopic sphincterotomy. "Sump syndrome" is a rare complication of side-to-side choledochoenterostomy operations which develops in the distal, nonfunctioning limb of the common bile duct where lithogenic bile, gastrointestinal contents, and debris accumulate. We report here a patient who developed spontaneous sump syndrome as a result of the formation of choledochoduodenal fistula, and who presented with multiple pyogenic liver abscesses. The patient's symptoms and liver abscesses resolved completely after treatment by endoscopic sphincterotomy and antibiotics. This case demonstrates that sump syndrome may occur spontaneously, that it can be a cause for pyogenic liver abscess formation, and that it may be treated effectively by endoscopic sphincterotomy. 
2	Gastric lesions secondary to long-distance running. Gastrointestinal disorders have been reported during long-distance running. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effects of prolonged exercise on the upper digestive tract. Seven subjects were submitted to a standard endoscopic examination of the upper digestive tract before and after long-distance running (range 18-50 km). Mucosal biopsy specimens were taken during all endoscopies. After running, all runners had histologically pathological features in the stomach. Vascular lesions were present in the chorion in six subjects after running, with the intensity of the lesions ranging from congestion to hemorrhage. Postexercise histological examination also showed a decrease in mucosal secretion. These lesions secondary to prolonged exercise indicate the presence of hemodynamic perturbations in the upper digestive tract. 
3	Misdiagnosis in patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. To confirm our impression that a high percentage of patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis are initially misdiagnosed, we reviewed records of 33 patients with a definitive diagnosis of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis seen over 10 years. Fourteen patients (43%) were initially misdiagnosed. Mean time to correct diagnosis was significantly greater for the misdiagnosed group (16.0 +/- 9.3 months) than for the rest of the patients (7.6 +/- 4.1 months). Two of three patients with an initial symptom of dyspnea were misdiagnosed. Three patients underwent laminectomies because of misdiagnosis. Age, stage of disease, and unusual presenting symptoms were not identified as causes of misdiagnosis. Most likely causes were physicians' failure to consider the diagnosis and lack of familiarity with the common clinical presentations of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. Earlier diagnosis of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis may help prevent medical mismanagement and may benefit patients both medically and psychologically. 
3	Reversed lateralization of cognitive functions in right handers. Exceptions to classical aphasiology. Most current and past research on the cerebral organization of cognitive functions has presupposed certain specialized hemisphere operations. At least for right handers, language and praxis are to be organized in the left hemisphere, while affective prosody, configurational spatial capacity, and global attention are lateralized in the right hemisphere. Deviations from these presuppositions, as in crossed aphasics and perhaps left handers, are generally considered to be 'exceptions' and either to disprove the rules or to be irrelevant to the rule. We report 4 very 'exceptional' cases, right handers with almost entirely reversed lateralization of functions. Analysis of the intrahemispheric relationships between functions suggests that there may be a specific neurobiology to the interrelationships between and among cognitive functions, handedness, and the intrahemisphere localization of the function. 
1	Management of recurrent malignant pleural effusion in the United Kingdom: survey of clinical practice. Malignant pleural effusions are often symptomatic and tend to recur after simple aspiration. Pleurodesis may prevent recurrence of the effusion; many agents and techniques have been described. A questionnaire was sent to 448 clinicians in the United Kingdom to determine how pleurodesis is performed in practice. There was a 56% overall response, with replies from 101 respiratory physicians, 88 general physicians, 29 thoracic surgeons, and 35 general surgeons. General surgeons saw few cases of malignant pleural effusion and rarely performed pleurodesis. A patient with recurrent malignant pleural effusion would usually be managed with pleurodesis by 76 (76%) respiratory physicians, 26 (30%) general physicians, and 23 (81%) thoracic surgeons; a further 29 (33%) general physicians would refer such patients to another specialist. Most medical pleurodesis were performed by junior staff, whereas consultant thoracic surgeons were more likely to be concerned with the procedure. All the thoracic surgeons used an intercostal tube drain, usually with suction. An intercostal tube drain was used routinely by only 54 (54%) of the respiratory physicians and 28 (32%) general physicians. Thoracic surgeons preferred talc for pleurodesis whereas physicians most commonly used tetracycline. The variety of methods in use supports the need for randomised, controlled studies to determine the most effective technique of pleurodesis. 
5	Influence of prosthetic design on durability of the Liotta porcine valve in the mitral position. From March 1979 to December 1984, the Liotta low-profile porcine bioprosthesis was employed for mitral valve replacement in 71 patients to avoid potential left ventricle-prosthesis mismatch occasionally observed with the standard, high-profile, Hancock porcine xenograft. Follow-up of 61 operative survivors showed at 10 years an actuarial survival of 67% +/- 7%, freedom from thromboemboli of 96% +/- 2%, freedom from structural deterioration of 63% +/- 11% and freedom from all Liotta bioprosthesis-related complications of 53% +/- 10%. Complications related to excessive protrusion of the stent into the left ventricular cavity were eliminated with the Liotta bioprosthesis; the peculiar stent configuration, however, was responsible for an increased rate of structural deterioration requiring reoperation in 10 patients (2.8% +/- 0.9%/patient-year) at a mean interval of 76 +/- 18 months after mitral valve replacement (range, 45 to 106 months). Common findings in all explants were cusp prolapse, cusp tears, and commissural rupture related to various degrees of tissue calcification, constantly leading to severe prosthetic incompetence. As also shown experimentally, such structural changes have been attributed to increased systolic stresses on the closed cusps, favored by excessive reduction of the stent height. Our experience shows that the Liotta bioprosthesis used for mitral valve replacement does not provide any clear-cut advantage over standard porcine bioprostheses and that its long-term durability appears affected by the unique prosthetic design. 
5	Fetal death due to nonlethal maternal carbon monoxide poisoning. Fetal death due to acute carbon monoxide poisoning is rarely reported in the medical literature. Of the eight cases found in literature review, only one documented the fetal carboxyhemoglobin concentration. This paper reports a fetal death due to accidental nonlethal maternal carbon monoxide intoxication in which both maternal and fetal carboxyhemoglobin concentrations were obtained. The corrected carboxyhemoglobin concentration was 61% at the time of death in utero, while the maternal carboxyhemoglobin was measured at 7% after one hour of supplemental oxygen. The authors review the mechanisms of fetal death and emphasize the different carbon monoxide kinetics in the fetal circulation. 
4	Renal angioplasty for renovascular disease: a reappraisal. The exact role of percutaneous transluminal angioplasty (PTA) for the treatment of renal artery stenoses (RAS) remains unclear. Therefore we analysed the outcome of unselected renal artery PTA in 30 subjects with angiographically proven unilateral RAS (Group I) compared with that of 19 who had RAS but were treated medically (Group II) and 21 who had essential hypertension but who underwent angiography (Group III). Good blood pressure control was achieved in all three groups but those who underwent PTA had a small but significant fall in their requirement for antihypertensive medications (p less than 0.05). However, no patient was "cured" of hypertension and blood pressure was able to be controlled in both Group II and Group III subjects without an increase in their number of antihypertensives. Serum creatinine did not improve significantly during follow-up in those who underwent PTA and was not different from that of Group II subjects at follow-up. Although unselected renal artery PTA for RAS may make blood pressure control easier it does not delay or prevent further deterioration in renal function and should not be used for this purpose. 
5	Management of aortobronchial fistula with graft replacement and omentopexy. Massive hemoptysis due to a recurrent aortobronchial fistula after repair of a thoracic aortic aneurysm developed in a 64-year-old woman. The infected aortic tissue was resected and replaced with an in situ Dacron graft covered by omentum. The patient is alive and well 15 months later. 
1	Multiple granular cell tumors associated with giant speckled lentiginous nevus and nevus flammeus in a child. We describe an 11-year-old girl in whom multiple cutaneous granular cell tumors were associated with a giant speckled lentiginous nevus and an extensive nevus flammeus. An association between granular cell tumors and pigmented skin lesions has been reported twice previously and supports a neural origin for these tumors. An abnormality of neural crest development is proposed to explain the coexistence of three uncommon and unusually extensive cutaneous disorders in this patient. This case may represent a further variant of phakomatosis pigmentovascularis. 
4	Platelet-activating factor: evidence against a role in hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction. The mechanism of hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction (HPV) remains unknown. The platelet-activating factor (PAF) antagonist WEB 2086 attenuated HPV in the isolated lung model of the rat. We evaluated the effect of WEB 2086 on HPV in an intact animal. Pigs were anesthetized, mechanically ventilated, and had their hemodynamic variables monitored with a pulmonary artery catheter and arterial line. Cardiac output was measured by thermodilution. Initial studies determined that PAF (0.03 to 1.0 micrograms) injected iv dose-dependently increased pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR) with a 262 +/- 58% increase in PVR 5 min after a dose of 1.0 microgram. WEB 2086 (25 mg/kg iv) completely blocked the increase in PVR caused by iv PAF. Additionally, indomethacin (2 mg/kg followed by 2 mg/kg.h iv) treatment of the animals attenuated the PAF-induced increase in PVR. To evaluate the effect of WEB 2086 on HPV, animals were alternately ventilated with 21% oxygen and 10-min periods of 10% oxygen to induce HPV. After three initial control episodes of hypoxic ventilation, WEB 2086 (25 mg/kg) was injected iv and two more episodes of ventilation with 10% oxygen were given. During the three control HPV episodes the increases in PVR were 80 +/- 10%, 108 +/- 10%, and 107 +/- 22% (n = 5). After WEB 2086, the increase in PVR during two episodes of hypoxia were 96 +/- 28% and 99 +/- 19%, respectively, which was not significantly different from the control response to hypoxia. We conclude that iv PAF dose dependently increases PVR in pigs, and can be blocked by WEB 2086, that its effect is partially mediated through cyclooxygenase products, and that PAF does not appear to mediate HPV in this species. 
4	Lovastatin decreases coenzyme Q levels in humans. Lovastatin is clinically used to treat patients with hypercholesterolemia and successfully lowers cholesterol levels. The mechanism of action of lovastatin is inhibition of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A reductase, an enzyme involved in the biosynthesis of cholesterol from acetyl-CoA. Inhibition of this enzyme could also inhibit the intrinsic biosynthesis of coenzyme Q10 (CoQ10), but there have not been definitive data on whether lovastatin reduces levels of CoQ10 as it does cholesterol. The clinical use of lovastatin is to reduce a risk of cardiac disease, and if lovastatin were to reduce levels of CoQ10, this reduction would constitute a new risk of cardiac disease, since it is established that CoQ10 is indispensable for cardiac function. We have conducted three related protocols to determine whether lovastatin does indeed inhibit the biosynthesis of CoQ10. One protocol was done on rats, and is reported in the preceding paper [Willis, R. A., Folkers, K., Tucker, J. L., Ye, C.-Q., Xia, L.-J. & Tamagawa, H. (1990) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 87, 8928-8930]. The other two protocols are reported here. One involved patients in a hospital, and the other involved a volunteer who permitted extraordinary monitoring of CoQ10 and cholesterol levels and cardiac function. All data from the three protocols revealed that lovastatin does indeed lower levels of CoQ10. The five hospitalized patients, 43-72 years old, revealed increased cardiac disease from lovastatin, which was life-threatening for patients having class IV cardiomyopathy before lovastatin or after taking lovastatin. Oral administration of CoQ10 increased blood levels of CoQ10 and was generally accompanied by an improvement in cardiac function. Although a successful drug, lovastatin does have side effects, particularly including liver dysfunction, which presumably can be caused by the lovastatin-induced deficiency of CoQ10. 
4	A randomized controlled trial of allopurinol in coronary bypass surgery. A plethora of experimental evidence indicates that allopurinol reduces the formation of cytotoxic free radicals during myocardial ischemia and reperfusion. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effect of allopurinol on cardiac performance and early mortality after coronary bypass surgery. Allopurinol (n = 89) or placebo (n = 80) was administered to 169 patients before surgery. Randomization produced groups evenly matched for surgical risk factors. Hospital mortality rate in the placebo group was 14 of 80 (18%) in the allopurinol group 4 of 89 (4%), p = 0.014. Cardiac performance, scored by cardiac index and the need for ionotropic or mechanical support, was significantly better in the allopurinol group. More nonfatal complications occurred in the allopurinol group. When either a complication or death is termed an event, the proportion of events was equal in the two groups. No side effects were identified. We now administer allopurinol to all patients who are undergoing bypass surgery unless specifically contraindicated. 
4	Left ventricular diastolic function in patients with left ventricular systolic dysfunction due to coronary artery disease and effect of nicardipine. To assess the effect of nicardipine on left ventricular (LV) diastolic function independent of concurrent effects on loading conditions in patients with LV systolic dysfunction due to coronary artery disease, equihypotensive doses of intravenous nitroprusside and nicardipine were administered to 12 patients with congestive heart failure due to previous myocardial infarction (LV ejection fraction less than 0.40). LV micromanometer pressure and simultaneous radionuclide volume were obtained during a baseline period, during nitroprusside infusion, during a second baseline period and during nicardipine infusion. Mean systemic arterial pressure decreased an average of 21 mm Hg with nitroprusside and 19 mm Hg with nicardipine. A greater decrease in LV end-diastolic pressure was observed with nitroprusside (29 +/- 2 to 15 +/- 2 mm Hg, p less than 0.01) than with nicardipine (29 +/- 2 to 25 +/- 3 mm Hg, p less than 0.05). There was a decrease in the time constant of relaxation during nitroprusside but not during nicardipine infusion. There was enough overlap in LV volumes in the baseline and nitroprusside periods to compare diastolic pressure-volume relations over a common range of volumes in 4 patients, and enough overlap in the baseline and nicardipine periods in 11 patients. The relation was shifted downward in 3 of 4 patients taking nitroprusside and in 6 of 11 patients taking nicardipine. The relation between end-diastolic pressure and volume was not shifted with nicardipine. 
4	Progress of patients with pulmonary atresia after systemic to pulmonary arterial shunts. Between February 1980 and June 1987, 42 shunts were placed in 39 infants with pulmonary atresia: 33 were modified Blalock-Taussig shunts with polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) and 9 were classic Blalock-Taussig shunts. There were four hospital deaths not related to the shunts. The remaining 35 patients were followed up for 1.6 months to 6.3 years (mean, 24.7 +/- 18 months). Repeat cineangiocardiographic studies revealed stenosis or distortion of the pulmonary arteries related to the site of the shunt in 11/22 patients (50%) with PTFE shunts and in 1/6 (17%) with classic Blalock-Taussig shunts; the stenosis was severe in only 1 patient. Mean increase in the pulmonary arterial index in the group with classic Blalock-Taussig shunts was 117 +/- 52 mm2/m2 (not significant) and in the group with PTFE shunts, 158 +/- 21 mm2/m2 (p less than 0.001). Late shunt occlusion occurred in 1 patient 23 months postoperatively. Thereafter, shunt patency rate remained at 94% +/- 6%. At the end of 1 year 81% +/- 7% of patients were judged to have adequate palliation, but between 2 and 3 years, only 60% +/- 10%. Univariate analysis showed that after 2 years the ranking order for successful palliation was classic Blalock-Taussig, 5-mm PTFE, and 4-mm PTFE shunts, but differences did not achieve statistical significance. 
3	Prognosticating study for cervical myelopathy using evoked spinal cord potentials. One hundred twenty-three cases of cervical spondylotic and ossification of the posterior longitudinal ligament (OPLL) myelopathy cases with long tract signs subjected to surgical treatment were studied to identify the most important factors having an influence on postoperative outcome using evoked spinal cord potentials (ESCP). Disappearance and positive wave changes of these potentials at the level of responsible lesions and slow conduction velocity under 40 m indicated an unsatisfactory outcome. Localized-lesion cases diagnosed by ESCPs had excellent results, significantly more so than extensive-lesion cases, regardless of operative methods. In 123 cases, 76% were found to have localized lesions, while the other 24% showed extensive lesions. Concerning the difference between CSM and OPLL, 54% of OPLL and only 14% of CSM demonstrated extensive lesions. 
4	Biohistory of slavery and blood pressure differences in blacks today. A hypothesis. Genetic factors are known to play an important role in the variations in blood pressure levels. However, genetic factors that explain the higher average blood pressure levels of western hemisphere blacks when compared with African blacks have not been seriously considered. Because the genetic makeup of a population is largely determined by biological and ecological forces in the past, an examination of the biohistory of blacks, specifically the slavery era, was conducted. An overview of the salient findings of that investigation is included in this article. The published historical evidence on the transatlantic slave trade and New World slavery (from the 16th century to the 19th century) reveals that conditions existed for "natural selection," and therefore, genetic changes were virtually inevitable in the slave populations. During this period of history, mortality was extremely high, and fertility (or reproductive success) was so low among the survivors that most plantation societies in the western hemisphere depended on a constant importation of captives (over 12 million) from Africa for the viability of the plantation communities. Because the major causes of death were salt-depletive diseases such as diarrhea, fevers, and vomiting, it is argued that individuals with an enhanced genetic-based ability to conserve salt had a distinct survival advantage over others and were, therefore, more likely to bequeath their genotype to subsequent generations of Western hemisphere blacks. Thus, it is predicted that blacks in the Americas have a greater frequency of individuals with an enhanced genetic-based ability to conserve salt than African blacks. 
5	Arterial oxygen desaturation during gastrointestinal endoscopy This prospective study evaluated the incidence and severity of arterial oxygen desaturation during gastrointestinal endoscopy. Following pulmonary function testing, 115 male patients underwent esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD), colonoscopy, or colonoscopy followed by EGD, with continuous recording of arterial oxygen saturation (SaO2). Most patients (80/115, 70%) showed arterial oxygen desaturation (greater than 4% decrease from baseline SaO2); severe arterial oxygen desaturation (SaO2 less than or equal to 85%) reflecting hypoxemia (PaO2 less than or equal to 50 mm Hg) was noted in one-third of patients overall (37/115, 32%). Severe arterial oxygen desaturation occurred in 9/62 EGD patients (15%), 23/46 colonoscopy patients (50%), and 4/7 patients having colonoscopy followed by EGD (57%). Arterial oxygen desaturation occurs frequently during gastrointestinal endoscopy and is often severe. These data support the concept that continuous monitoring of SaO2 should be standard procedure during all gastrointestinal endoscopic procedures. 
1	Epirubicin cardiotoxicity: a study of 135 patients with advanced breast cancer. The cardiotoxicity of epirubicin (EPI) was evaluated clinically, radiologically, with ECG, and with multiple ECG-gated radionuclide determination of the left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) during rest in 135 patients with advanced breast cancer. The EPI doses were 60 mg/m2 on days 1 and 8 every 4 weeks or 45 mg/m2 plus vindesine 3 mg/m2 on the same schedule. The median cumulative dose of EPI was 500 mg/m2 (range, 47 to 1,563). Eight of the 135 patients developed congestive heart failure (CHF). Of 67 patients treated with EPI less than 500 mg/m2, none developed CHF. Among 48 patients treated with doses between 500 and 1,000 mg/m2, one had CHF (2%; 95% confidence limits, 0.1 to 11.1). Among 20 patients who received EPI from 1,000 to 1,563 mg/m2, seven developed CHF (35%; 95% confidence limits, 15.4 to 59.2). Four patients died due to cardiotoxicity. The risk of EPI cardiotoxicity at the present schedule is considerable at doses above 1,000 mg/m2. At doses between 500 and 1,000 mg/m2 the risk of CHF decreases, and at doses below 500 mg/m2, it is negligible. For all patients, the prevalence of CHF was 6% and the sensitivity of LVEF high (95%), mainly due to the low incidence of CHF. Among the 20 patients who received EPI at more than 1,000 mg/m2, the prevalence of CHF was 35% and the sensitivity only 64%. The specificity was maximally 62%. Our results suggest that LVEF is of no value as a predictor for CHF. 
5	Post-traumatic bile fistulae. Bile leakage after liver injury has been reported to be a complication associated with significant mortality. In a prospective study of 306 patients with liver injuries 13 (4%) developed a bile leak. There appear to be two groups of patients, those with a major bile duct injury (three patients) and those with a more peripheral injury (ten patients). Bile leaks may present either as bile peritonitis (six patients) or as a bile leak through a drain site (seven patients). All but one bile leak closed spontaneously at a median of 33 days (range, 3-110 days). There was no mortality but patients incurred a median of four complications each (range, 1-5). This may reflect the severity of the initial injury rather than the bile leak. Respiratory failure and/or infection and sepsis were the most common complications whilst abnormalities of liver function, although common, were seldom of clinical significance. 
5	Surgeons, surgery, and immunomodulation. With the definition over the past 15 years of the altered immune state of surgical patients as a result of disease itself and surgical therapy, there have been multiple approaches to the modulation of immune status in experimental or clinical situations, but with conflicting or unhelpful results. The variable that has never been assessed is the significance of the surgeon as an immunomodulator. The expediency and the quality of the surgical act in a variety of surgical diseases have a positive effect on the immune system. Indeed, the data indicate that correction of shock, drainage of infection, excision or drainage of necrotic material, restoration of body composition, and solid basic care all have a positive influence on patients' immune responses. An immunomodulator might get credit if the role of surgical care is not properly assessed. A framework for the study of immunomodulators with the integration of clinical behavior is outlined. 
4	Indirect revascularization of the lower extremity by means of microvascular free-muscle flap--a preliminary report. We describe the treatment of a patient with end-stage peripheral vascular disease and ischemic ulceration of the lower extremity in whom an obliteration of the distal arterial bed precluded conventional arterial reconstruction. A nonhealing dorsal foot ulcer was debrided, and soft tissue reconstruction was accomplished by the free microsurgical transfer of a muscle flap to the distal lower extremity. Arterial inflow to this free flap was provided by a contralateral reversed saphenous vein graft from the proximal arterial tree of the leg. This procedure resulted in a healed wound, stable coverage, and limb salvage. The patient also noted complete relief of rest pain and improvement in his claudication symptoms. A follow-up arteriogram was done 2 months after surgery. Contrast injection directly into the artery of this flap showed new blood vessel growth from the muscle flap into the foot with anastomoses of these "new vessels" to the patient's native circulation. This experience suggests that limb salvage may be possible by the free microvascular transplantation of a muscle flap onto the limb in selected patients whose limbs are deemed "nonreconstructible.". 
5	Deletion of chromosome 4: 46,XY, del(4) (q31.3) after gamete intrafallopian transfer and in vitro fertilization-embryo transfer. It seems that assisted reproduction technology does not increase the rate of chromosome abnormalities, and up to now, a few cases have been reported. The case we describe here is the first one of monosomy 4q31 in a full-term liveborn after a combined GIFT-IVF procedure. Once more, this case raises the question of whether pregnancies resulting from IVF should be monitored for chromosome abnormalities or not. 
2	5-Aminosalicylic acid is a potent inhibitor of interleukin 1 beta production in organ culture of colonic biopsy specimens from patients with inflammatory bowel disease. Interleukin 1 beta in biopsy specimens from inflamed colonic mucosa of patients with active inflammatory bowel disease was studied. Compared with normal colonic mucosal biopsy specimens, a significantly greater amount of interleukin 1 beta was present in rectal mucosa before (median (range) 4.3 (2.0-11.8) v 119.2 (30.1-286.8) pg/mg; p less than 0.01) and produced during organ culture (39.1 (9.4-106.8) v 97.6 (28.2-991.6) pg/mg; p less than 0.01). Values of interleukin 1 beta after culture correlated with concentrations of thromboxane B2. Organ culture of inflamed biopsy specimens in the presence of 5 aminosalicylic acid and dexamethasone reduced the amount of interleukin 1 beta detected. At the doses studied, 5 aminosalicylic acid also reduced the amount of leukotriene B4 detected after culture. 
5	Current management of varicoceles. In spite of all that has been written about the varicocele, it is still not clear who will benefit from occlusion of the spermatic vein or why improvement in semen takes place in some patients but not in others. Because fertility is usually assessed in the framework of a couple who are trying to establish a pregnancy, it is important to evaluate both partners before making any recommendations regarding therapy. If the man is found to have a varicocele and semen analyses that indicate deficits in either the quantity or quality of the sperm, surgical ligation or transvenous occlusion should be considered as one appropriate form of therapy. Varicocele ligation and embolotherapy both can be performed as an outpatient procedure with minimal morbidity and equal effectiveness regarding pregnancy outcome. The cost, if the procedures are done in an outpatient facility, should be approximately equal. The obvious benefits of the percutaneous technique are a slightly lower recurrence rate and a more rapid return to full physical activity. The surgical procedure described by Marmar and associates appears to have a similar rate of recurrence and short postoperative period of recovery. Greater experience by more urologists using this technique needs to be gained to compare it adequately with the other methods described. Varicocele ligation by the inguinal or retroperitoneal routes is familiar to most urologists and does not require the operating microscope or other special instruments. With greater understanding of the venous anatomy and with careful dissection, the persistence and recurrence rate can be acceptably low and the postoperative recovery relatively rapid and smooth. 
5	Evaluation of 13C-urea breath test in the detection of Helicobacter pylori and in monitoring the effect of tripotassium dicitratobismuthate in non-ulcer dyspepsia Sixty nine patients with non-ulcer dyspepsia have been studied with endoscopy, biopsy, quick urease (CLO) test, Helicobacter pylori culture, and the 13C-urea breath test before and after treatment with tripotassium dicitratobismuthane (DeNol) two tablets twice daily for four weeks. Symptoms of non-ulcer dyspepsia were recorded using a standard questionnaire. Using H pylori culture as the gold standard, the sensitivity of the 13C-urea breath test was 90%, the specificity 98.6%, and the accuracy 94.8% with a positive predictive value of 98.2% and a negative predictive value of 92.5%. Conversion rate from H pylori positive to negative status after treatment with tripotassium dicitratobismuthate was 17.9%. Symptoms of non-ulcer dyspepsia improved appreciably after treatment irrespective of H pylori status. The 13C-urea breath test is an accurate research tool suitable for serial testing and population surveys. 
5	Pulmonary involvement in the eosinophilia-myalgia syndrome. We describe the cases of three women with pulmonary involvement in the eosinophilia-myalgia syndrome. The illness was characterized by elevated peripheral blood eosinophil counts, myalgias, fatigue, and dyspnea. Two of three patients had bilateral infiltrates on chest roentgenograms. All three had markedly decreased carbon monoxide diffusing capacities and pulmonary hypertension. High-dose prednisone therapy provided only partial resolution of the pulmonary symptoms. Open lung biopsy specimens showed chronic interstitial and perivascular infiltrates in two of the patients and moderate fibrointimal hyperplasia of pulmonary vasculature in the third. High-dose prednisone therapy prior to the biopsies may have modified the original histologic features. 
1	Nevus flammeus. Discordance in monozygotic twins. Nevus flammeus has been described as an inherited vascular anomaly. We report two cases of nevus flammeus, each appearing in one of two monozygotic twins. This finding supports the idea that nevus flammeus results from embryologic mishap rather than genetic transmission. 
5	Late results of the left subcostal approach for automatic implantable cardioverter defibrillator implantation. A left subcostal surgical approach was used to implant an automatic implantable cardioverter defibrillator (AICD) in 48 patients with a history of nonfatal cardiac arrest or documented ventricular tachycardia/fibrillation. Electrophysiologic studies before surgery yielded induction of monomorphic or polymorphic ventricular tachycardia in 40 patients, whereas 8 were noninducible. Mean (+/- standard deviation) age was 58 +/- 12 years. Mean ejection fraction was 33 +/- 16%. Thirty patients (63%) had documented coronary artery disease; 14 patients (29%) had previous coronary bypass surgery. The mean intraoperative defibrillation threshold was 13.8 +/- 6.6 J. In 6 patients, an adjunctive right minithoracotomy was used to position 1 patch over the right atrium and thus optimize the defibrillation threshold. Patients with prior exposure to amiodarone and previous coronary bypass surgery had higher defibrillation thresholds at implantation. Two perioperative deaths occurred. There were no infections. Long-term follow-up yielded a 1- and 5-year survival of 0.88 and 0.58, respectively, and a freedom from sudden cardiac death of 1.0 and 0.97, respectively. The nonthoracotomy, left subcostal surgical approach is safe and effective, provides adequate defibrillation thresholds in most patients, and yields long-term survival comparable to other implantation techniques. 
1	Cytotoxic effects of high energy shock waves in different in vitro models: influence of the experimental set-up. High energy shock waves (electromagnetically generated, Siemens Lithostar) were studied for their effects in vitro on different (tumor) cell types. Cells were exposed to the shock waves as a single cell suspension or as a cell pellet on the bottom of a test tube. In both cases, a dose dependent direct cytotoxicity, established by trypan blue dye exclusion, was observed after treatment with 1000 or 2000 shock waves. Also, the antiproliferative capacity as determined by clonogenic potential (double layer soft agar) and growth rate (plastic) were affected in this way. However, comparing the results after treatment in suspension or pellet, a discrepancy was evident. The cell lines showed a different susceptibility in pellet vs. suspension. Also the differential sensitivity of the cell types varied in these two treatment models. Furthermore the outcome depended on the cell concentration; direct cytotoxicity in a cell suspension was more pronounced at higher cell concentrations, while in a pellet this was increased by decreasing the number of cells. Finally, no shock wave induced cytotoxicity could be seen after fixation of cells in gelatine or by placing the pellet on a bottom layer of gelatine. Pressure measurements revealed no adequate explanation for this phenomenon. These results indicate that in vitro effects depend on the way cells are exposed to the shock waves and can be greatly influenced by changing the conditions of the microenvironment. Therefore, precise descriptions of the experimental set-up and careful interpretations of their outcome are obligatory. 
5	Initial failure of surgical exploration in patients with primary hyperparathyroidism. To determine the causes of failures of cervical exploration for primary hyperparathyroidism, we reviewed 892 patients operated on by one surgeon from 1953 to 1990. Twenty-seven patients (3%) remained hypercalcemic or developed hypercalcemia within 6 months of surgery. Of these, five patients had one adenoma removed initially; at reoperation, three patients had a second adenoma that was successfully removed, whereas the other two patients had hyperplasia and required subtotal parathyroidectomies. No enlarged parathyroid glands were identified in 22 patients. Eventually, six patients became normocalcemic spontaneously, seven patients underwent re-exploration with a successful outcome in all but one case, two patients had ectopic hyperparathyroidism associated with carcinoma elsewhere, and seven patients refused reoperation and remain hypercalcemic. The failure rate of surgical exploration for primary hyperparathyroidism can be reduced by systematically exploring all four parathyroid glands. All abnormal parathyroids should be removed with histologic verification. When no abnormal glands are found, localization studies should be performed before re-exploration. 
5	Triggers of transient myocardial ischemia: circadian variation and relation to plaque rupture and coronary thrombosis in stable coronary artery disease. The phenomenon of transient myocardial ischemia is common in patients with stable coronary disease and appears to be due both to increases in myocardial demand and to episodic coronary vasoconstriction. The circadian variation of transient ischemic episodes closely parallels the circadian variation of acute coronary syndromes associated with plaque rupture, such as myocardial infarction and sudden death. These concordant temporal patterns of transient ischemia, myocardial infarction and sudden cardiac death probably represent independent manifestations stemming from the consequences of increased sympathetic activity. 
5	Identification of lymphotoxin and tumor necrosis factor in multiple sclerosis lesions. Multiple sclerosis (MS) brain tissue, spleen, and PBMC were studied using immunocytochemistry and FACS for immunoreactivity for lymphotoxin (LT) and TNF. Both cytokines were identified in acute and chronic active MS lesions but were absent from chronic silent lesions. LT was associated with CD3+ lymphocytes and Leu-M5+ microglia cells at the lesion edge and to a lesser extent, in adjacent white matter. TNF was associated with astrocytes in all areas of the lesion, and with foamy macrophages in the center of the active lesion. In acute lesions, immunoreactivity for TNF in endothelial cells was noted at the lesion edge. No LT or TNF reactivity was detected in Alzheimer's or Parkinson's disease brain tissues but was present at lower levels in central nervous system (CNS) tissue from other inflammatory conditions, except for adrenoleucodystrophy which displayed high levels of LT in microglia. No increase in LT and TNF reactivity was detected in spleen and PBMC of MS patients suggesting specific reactivity within the CNS. These results indicate that LT and TNF may be involved in the immunopathogenesis of MS, and can be detected in both inflammatory cells and cells endogenous to the CNS. 
5	Percutaneous transhepatic cholecystostomy for acute complicated cholecystitis in elderly patients. We report our experience with percutaneous transhepatic cholecystostomy in 10 elderly patients with acute cholecystitis, complicated by empyema formation. Most of these patients has severe underlying disease, rendering them at high risk for surgical intervention. In all patients, the percutaneous procedure was followed by a rapid regression of clinical symptoms and of radiologic abnormalities. Six were considered inoperable. Three of these remain free of biliary symptoms, respectively 22, 10, and 7 months after percutaneous cholecystostomy. Three others died of nonbiliary disease 1-4 months after cholecystostomy. Three patients underwent successful elective cholecystostomy 1-5 wk after percutaneous cholecystostomy. In one patient, cholecystectomy had to be performed because of recurrence of hydrops, 1 wk after catheter removal. In our opinion, percutaneous transhepatic cholecystostomy is a safe and effective procedure in the treatment of elderly patients with acute complicated cholecystitis. It can be followed by elective cholecystectomy in good surgical candidates, or by an expectant conservative management in high surgical risk patients. 
1	Activated protooncogenes in human lung tumors from smokers. Fourteen primary human lung tumor DNAs from smokers were analyzed for transforming activity by two DNA transfection assays. Activated protooncogenes were detected in 3 of 11 tumor DNAs by the NIH 3T3 focus assay, whereas activated protooncogenes were detected in 11 of 13 tumor DNAs by the NIH 3T3 cotransfection-nude mouse tumorigenicity assay. K- or NRAS genes activated by point mutation at codons 12 or 61 were detected in a large cell carcinoma, a squamous cell carcinoma, and 5 adenocarcinomas. An HRAS oncogene activated by a different mechanism was detected in an epidermoid carcinoma. One adenocarcinoma was found to contain an activated RAF gene. Two unidentified transforming genes were detected in a squamous cell carcinoma DNA and two adenocarcinoma DNAs. Eight of 10 lung adenocarcinomas that had formed metastases at the time of surgery were found to contain RAS oncogenes. No significant increase in metastasis was observed in the lung adenocarcinomas that contained one or more 6-kilobase EcoRI alleles of the LMYC gene. Overall, 12 of 14 (86%) of the lung tumor DNAs from smokers were found to contain activated protooncogenes. RAS oncogenes appear to play a role in the development of metastases in lung adenocarcinomas. 
4	Early afterdepolarizations and triggered activity in rabbit cardiac Purkinje fibers recovering from ischemic-like conditions. Role of acidosis. BACKGROUND. The mechanisms underlying repetitive activity during reperfusion of ischemic myocardium are thought to include triggered responses elicited at short pacing cycle lengths. The potential to generate repetitive responses at longer pacing cycle lengths under similar conditions, however, has not been explored. Thus, the present study examined the role of cycle length on the cellular electrical changes produced during recovery from ischemic-like conditions and identified the major component precipitating nondriven, repetitive activity. METHODS AND RESULTS. Transmembrane potentials were recorded in vitro from isolated rabbit Purkinje fibers exposed to hypoxia (defined as PO2 less than 30 mm Hg, high [K+]o, and zero glucose) plus lactic acidosis (pH 6.7) for 45 minutes and during recovery in normal Tyrode's solution (pH 7.4). Compared with control, action potential duration (90% repolarization) during recovery increased transiently by 40.9 +/- 11.8 and 241.0 +/- 51.1 msec at respective basic cycle lengths of 1,000 and 3,000 msec (both p less than 0.005). In 81% of preparations, action potential prolongation was accompanied by early afterdepolarizations and triggered activity generated from low (positive to -40 mV) or high (negative to -40 mV) membrane potentials. In 62% of experiments, brief periods of abnormal automaticity also occurred. Triggered responses were 1) unaffected by 1 microM ryanodine, 2) abolished by pacing at short basic cycle lengths or by exposing tissues to 2.5 micrograms/ml lidocaine, and 3) more easily induced at long basic cycle lengths or by superfusing 2.5 micrograms/ml quinidine. When tissues were conditioned with hypoxia alone (pH 7.4), action potential prolongation on recovery was comparatively small, and nondriven responses did not develop. Conversely, addition of 10-20 microM amiloride to the hypoxic, acidic test solution augmented recovery-induced action potential prolongation. CONCLUSIONS. We conclude that acidosis, as a component of ischemia, plus slow pacing frequencies may mediate the genesis of early afterdepolarizations and triggered activity in Purkinje fibers on recovery, long after extracellular pH has been restored to normal. These data may have clinical relevance to the mechanisms of reperfusion arrhythmias in the intact human heart. 
4	Thiazide diuretics and the risk of hip fracture. Results from the Framingham Study. Thiazide diuretics may preserve bone mass and prevent elderly women's osteopenic fractures, but studies have not distinguished between thiazide preparations or examined former users. We performed a case-control study looking at thiazide use and subsequent hip fracture in postmenopausal female members of the Framingham Study cohort. Cases who had experienced a first hip fracture (n = 176) were compared with age-matched controls (n = 672). Results showed a modest protective effect of any recent thiazide use (not significant). However, recent pure thiazide users experienced significant protection against fracture (adjusted odds ratio, 0.31; 95% confidence interval, 0.11 to 0.88), whereas recent users of combination drugs containing thiazides experienced no protection (adjusted odds ratio, 1.16; 95% confidence interval, 0.44 to 3.05). Combination drugs generally contained only 25 mg of hydrochlorothiazide, suggesting that the small amount of thiazide was insufficient to preserve bone mass. Former thiazide users were not protected against fracture. In sum, recent pure thiazide use in women protects against hip fracture. 
5	The flail mitral valve: echocardiographic findings by precordial and transesophageal imaging and Doppler color flow mapping. To determine the echocardiographic and Doppler characteristics of mitral regurgitation associated with a flail mitral valve, precordial and transesophageal echocardiography with pulsed wave and Doppler color flow mapping was performed in 17 patients with a flail mitral valve leaflet due to ruptured chordae tendineae (Group I) and 22 patients with moderate or severe mitral regurgitation due to other causes (Group II). Echocardiograms were performed before or during cardiac surgery; cardiac catheterization was also performed in 28 patients (72%). Mitral valve disease was confirmed at cardiac surgery in all patients. By echocardiography, the presence of a flail mitral valve leaflet was defined by the presence of abnormal mitral leaflet coaptation or ruptured chordae. Using these criteria, transesophageal imaging showed a trend toward greater sensitivity and specificity than precordial imaging in the diagnosis of flail mitral valve leaflet. By Doppler color flow mapping, a flail mitral valve leaflet was also characterized by an eccentric, peripheral, circular mitral regurgitant jet that closely adhered to the walls of the left atrium. The direction of flow of the eccentric jet in the left atrium distinguished a flail anterior from a flail posterior leaflet. By transesophageal echocardiography with Doppler color flow mapping, the ratio of mitral regurgitant jet arc length to radius of curvature was significantly higher in Group I than Group II patients (5.0 +/- 2.3 versus 0.7 +/- 0.6, p less than 0.001); all of the Group I patients and none of the Group II patients had a ratio greater than 2.5. 
2	Advanced assessment of the abdomen and gastrointestinal problems. There are many unique physical assessment findings that are associated with specific gastrointestinal disorders. The detection of these findings enables the nurse to manage gastrointestinal emergencies on the patient unit in a timely fashion, preventing deterioration and maintaining the safety of the patient. These skills build well on the traditional, detailed, and comprehensive assessments the nurse makes when using the nursing process. Specific abdominal assessments include detection of signs associated with appendicitis such as rebound tenderness and McBurney's, Rosvig's, and Aaron's signs. The nurse must always be alert to the possibility of peritonitis and the urgency of early detection and treatment. The patient with cirrhosis of the liver presents a distinct clinical picture. There is a need for subtle evaluation of mental status to detect early signs of hepatic coma. Another extra-abdominal assessment of this complication is asterixis. Finally, the assessment of the patient is enhanced when the nurse is able to help identify the location of bleeding. Improving abdominal and gastrointestinal system assessment leads to early detection of nursing problems and appropriate interventions. 
1	Interstitial irradiation and hyperthermia for the treatment of recurrent malignant brain tumors. Between June 1987 and June 1989, 29 recurrent malignant gliomas or recurrent solitary brain metastases in 28 patients were treated in a Phase I study of interstitial irradiation and hyperthermia. Patient age ranged from 18 to 65 years, and the Karnofsky Performance Status scores ranged from 40 to 90%. There were 13 glioblastomas, 10 anaplastic astrocytomas, 3 melanomas, and 3 adenocarcinomas. Catheters were implanted stereotactically after computed tomography-based preplanning. Hyperthermia was administered before and after brachytherapy, using one to six 2450- or 915-MHz helical coil microwave antennas and one to three multisensor fiberoptic thermometry probes. The goal was to heat as much of the tumor as possible to 42.5 degrees C for 30 minutes. Within 30 minutes after the first hyperthermia treatment, implant catheters were afterloaded with high-activity iodine-125 seeds delivering tumor doses of 32.6 to 61.0 Gy. Most patients had no sensation of heating. Complications included seizures in 5 patients, reversible neurological changes in 9 patients, a scalp burn in 1, and infections in 3. Of 28 evaluable 2-month follow-up scans, 11 showed definite improvement in the radiological appearance of the tumor, 4 were slightly improved, 7 were stable, and 6 showed tumor progression. Ten patients underwent reoperation for persistent tumor and/or necrosis. Eleven of 28 patients are alive 40 to 97 weeks after treatment. Thirteen patients died of a brain tumor, 2 died of extracranial melanoma metastases, 1 died of new brain melanoma metastases, and 1 died of a pulmonary embolus. The median survival was 55 weeks overall. Median survival has not yet been reached for the anaplastic astrocytoma subgroup. We conclude that interstitial brain hyperthermia using helical coil microwave antennas is technically feasible. The level of toxicity is acceptable, and the computed tomographic response rate is encouraging. 
1	The dichotomous distribution of gastrinomas. Our experience with 47 sporadic gastrinomas suggests that no less than 85% of these tumors are located to the right of the superior mesenteric artery. This finding is unexpected because approximately 75% of insulinomas and glucagonomas are located to the left of the superior mesenteric artery. All of our extrapancreatic gastrinomas have been located to the right. These observations prompted us to determine if other extrapancreatic gastrinomas were also predominantly located to the right side. We searched the world's literature and found 10 cases of ovarian gastrinomas and one case of a renal gastrinoma. Nine of these remote extrapancreatic gastrinomas were located on the right side. This distribution of remote extrapancreatic gastrinomas is similar to our experience with peripancreatic gastrinomas. This unexpected right-sided preponderance of both remote and peripancreatic gastrinomas suggests a common origin for both. 
5	Myocardial revascularization for the third time. Clinical characteristics and follow-up. Twenty-five patients presenting for a third revascularization procedure were retrospectively reviewed at Loyola University Medical Center, Maywood, IL. This represents 0.5 percent of the total revascularization cases over a five-year period extending from 1985 through 1989. Perioperative mortality was none, and seven complications occurred in six patients. Internal mammary arteries were used for revascularization in 60 percent of this group. Follow-up reveals that only one patient has died secondary to an arrhythmia. All patients except one are symptomatically improved, and 18 patients remain angina free at a mean follow-up of 22.3 months. It is therefore concluded that patients are clinically improved with a third revascularization, and this procedure should be offered as an effective means of treatment. 
5	Menstrual state and exercise as determinants of spinal trabecular bone density in female athletes. OBJECTIVE--To study the effects of amenorrhoea and intensive back exercise on the bone mineral density of the lumbar spine in female athletes. DESIGN--Cross sectional study comparing amenorrhoeic with eumenorrhoeic athletes and rowers with non-rowers. SETTING--The British Olympic Medical Centre, Northwick Park Hospital. PATIENTS--46 Elite female athletes comprising 19 rowers, 18 runners, and nine dancers, of whom 25 were amenorrhoeic and 21 eumenorrhoeic. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE--Trabecular bone mineral density of the lumbar spine measured by computed tomography. RESULTS--Mean trabecular bone mineral density was 42 mg/cm3 (95% confidence interval 22 to 62 mg/cm3) lower in the amenorrhoeic than the eumenorrhoeic athletes; this difference was highly significant (p = 0.0002). Mean trabecular bone mineral density was 21 mg/cm3 (1 to 41 mg/cm3) lower in the non-rowers than the rowers; this was also significant (p = 0.05). There was no interaction between these two effects (p = 0.28). CONCLUSION--The effect of intensive exercise on the lumbar spine partially compensates for the adverse effect of amenorrhoea on spinal trabecular bone density. 
4	Nd:YAG laser with sapphire tip combined with balloon angioplasty in peripheral arterial occlusions. Long-term results In 167 patients with complete occlusion (greater than 3 cm) of the femoropopliteal artery, percutaneous transluminal laser angioplasty (PTLA) was performed after an unsuccessful attempt at crossing with a guide wire and was immediately followed by balloon dilatation. An Nd-YAG laser and an optical fiber delivery system with a sapphire tip serving as a contact probe were used for PTLA. In 132 of 167 (79%) patients, the occluded segment was successfully reopened. Clinical symptoms improved in 126 of 167 (75%) patients. PTLA was unsuccessful in 35 patients, and in 15 of these, injury of the vessel wall occurred. In one patient, surgical drainage of a large hematoma became necessary. All patients in whom recanalization had been achieved were randomized to receive long-term treatment with either phenprocumarol or acetylsalicylic acid (ASA) plus dipyridamole to prevent rethrombosis. At 36 months of follow-up, the cumulative patency rate (CPR) was 63%. A complete reobstruction in 32 patients (24%) and a partial reobstruction in 15 patients (11%) were found angiographically. The CPR after 36 months was significantly lower (p less than 0.05) in patients younger than 60 years of age (54%) than in patients older than 60 (68%); it was also significantly lower (p less than 0.05) in patients with reduced peripheral runoff (55%) due to obstructed arteries of the lower leg than in patients with unaffected runoff (73%). The CPR was 65% in recanalized segments shorter than 7 cm and was 62% in recanalized segments longer than 7 cm. 
5	Pinch-off syndrome: a complication of implantable subclavian venous access devices. Implantable central venous access devices placed via the subclavian vein may become obstructed by thrombosis, impingement against a vein wall, or compression between the clavicle and first rib. The latter has been termed pinch-off syndrome (POS). Eleven patients with POS were studied, including one whose catheter had fractured and one whose catheter had fragmented. They were compared with 22 matched control patients and 100 consecutive routine clinic patients. Each catheter was graded: 0 = normal, 1 = abrupt change in course with no luminal narrowing, 2 = luminal narrowing, and 3 = complete catheter fracture. POS was present in most (eight of 11) cases within 3 weeks after placement. A grade 1 catheter was common (33%) among control subjects, but grades 2 and 3 were uncommon (1%). Catheter fracture or fragmentation was seen in two of five cases with long-term (greater than 3 weeks) pinching (grade 2 catheter). The following conclusions were reached: Grade 2 represents significant catheter compression and the potential for serious complications. Grade 1 is of uncertain clinical significance, due to its high prevalence in control subjects. 
1	Lack of prognostic value of nucleolar organizer region enumeration in transitional cell carcinoma of the bladder. Enumeration of silver-stained nucleolar organizer regions is of limited use in grading transitional cell tumors of the bladder. We attempted in this article to establish whether or not such a technique would be helpful in predicting the prognosis of such tumors within rather than between grades. In the study population of 11 high-grade transitional cell carcinomas of the bladder, no correlation was found between clinical outcome and mean nucleolar organizer region count. 
4	Predictive value of lipoprotein (a) and other serum lipoproteins in the angiographic diagnosis of coronary artery disease. To determine the relation among lipids in predicting coronary artery disease (CAD), 213 patients undergoing diagnostic angiography for suspected CAD were prospectively studied. Twenty-one patients had normal coronary arteries and 192 had CAD in 1 to 3 arteries at arteriography with measurements obtained with digital calipers. Lipoproteins were measured and lipoprotein (a) [Lp(a)] was also assayed in a subset of 98 patients with CAD. Statistical analysis was performed using uni- and multivariate techniques to test the association among age, gender, systemic hypertension, diabetes mellitus, cigarette smoking, family history, total cholesterol, triglycerides, high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, very low density lipoprotein cholesterol, apolipoproteins (apo) A-I and apo B, ratio of apo A-I to apo B, and ratio of HDL cholesterol to total cholesterol, to Lp(a) and to CAD. All factors except gender, systemic hypertension, diabetes mellitus and cigarette smoking were univariate predictors of CAD. Multivariate predictors were, in decreasing order of significance, family history, age, HDL/total cholesterol ratio and apo B. When Lp(a) was included, multivariate predictors were age, family history, apo B and Lp(a), in that order. Lipid parameters alone showed that the HDL/total cholesterol ratio and that Lp(a) provide the best predictive tests for the detection of CAD in this referral population and may ultimately become important screening tests for CAD. 
5	Hageman factor-dependent kinin activation in burns and its theoretical relationship to postburn immunosuppression syndrome and infection. Burn injury and intradermal injection of bradykinin or histamine cause permeability changes visualized as dye-release lesions in the skin of guinea pigs injected intravenously with Evans blue dye. Antihistamine pretreatment ablates the histamine but not the effect of thermal injury or bradykinin. Bradykinin is generated via activation of Hageman factor in a two-step reaction. Steps 1 and 2 can be inhibited by corn trypsin inhibitor and soy bean trypsin inhibitors, respectively. Dye-release lesions were reduced from thermal injury and bradykinin injections when these substances were injected into the skin first. Angiotensin-converting enzyme deactivates bradykinin by degrading it. Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor neutralizes angiotensin-converting enzyme. Dye-release lesions from both thermal injury and bradykinin injection were enhanced because of continued bradykinin build-up when these treatments were preceded by subcutaneous injections of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor. Thus bradykinin is generated in thermal injury via the Hageman factor-dependent pathway. Hageman factor sits at the apex of a series of interrelated cascade systems, all of which impinge on the animal's immune status. Uncontrolled Hagemen factor activation in thermal injury may be the link among all the events collectively known as the "post thermal injury immunosuppression syndrome.". 
3	Excipients in valproic acid syrup may cause diarrhea: a case report. A 5-year-old child receiving valproic acid syrup for seizure control developed diarrhea probably from the excipient ingredients. Each 5 mL of valproic acid syrup contains sucrose 3 g, glycerin 0.75 g, and sorbitol 0.75 g, providing daily amounts of 36, 9, and 9 g of sucrose, glycerin, and sorbitol, respectively. The diarrhea resolved when the child was switched to another valproic acid product. Clinicians should be aware of potential problems that may occur from excipient ingredients in pharmaceutical products when evaluating adverse effects of medications. 
1	Alternative therapies, 1990. An overview. The availability of alternative therapies for many health problems is a well-documented historical fact. Alternative therapies are generally understood to be those therapies outside of the usually accepted medical therapies for disease processes, such as cancer, arthritis, diabetes, psoriasis, lupus, and AIDS. Some other descriptive terms utilized include questionable, unproven, dubious, unorthodox, and unconventional. These alternative therapies vary from active involvement in promotion of one's own health (exercise, diet) to quackery. In today's society, with emphasis on self-involvement with individual health, metabolic therapies have become the most widely practiced alternative therapy. In an antiestablishment, anti-intellectual climate, with an increasingly mobile, rootless population, alternative therapies are in somewhat of a renaissance. Some confusion exists regarding clinical trials and alternative therapies in the general population and in the noninvolved health profession. Various studies indicate that from 10% to 50% of cancer patients use some alternative therapy, with national expenditures ranging as high as $10 billion annually. Better-educated patients with higher-than-average income are more likely to choose alternative therapies and are frequently supported by a physician in this choice. Most cancer patients continue under a physician's care and continue usual therapy while pursuing alternative methods. Approximately 5% of cancer patients abandon appropriate therapy and pursue potentially harmful alternative methods. A variety of sociomedical questions are brought forth by studies of the use of alternative therapies. A great need for public and professional education regarding this subject is evident. 
1	Pedunculated giant lipoma of the esophagus. A patient with a giant lipoma of the esophagus presented with progressive dysphagia and odynophagia, fever, and recurrent melena. Two years previously, when the symptoms were less pronounced, it had been misdiagnosed as achalasia. After surgical removal of the lipoma, the patient became symptom free. 
5	Dilatation in the duplex kidney: 3 unusual cases. Dilatation in the upper limb of a duplex ureter is usually secondary to obstruction and may be associated with a ureterocele. By contrast, vesicoureteric reflux is the usual cause of a dilated lower moiety ureter. We report 3 cases in which unusual or complex causes of dilatation of 1 limb of a duplex ureter were demonstrated. 
5	Cytogenetic evidence of clonality in a case of pigmented villonodular synovitis. Pigmented villonodular synovitis is an uncommon benign lesion that is characterized by diffuse synovial proliferation. Based on animal models, this lesion has been conjectured previously to be reactive in nature. In this report, the authors present the histologic and cytogenetic findings for a pigmented villonodular synovitis that was excised from the right knee of a 47-year-old man. Trisomy 7 was observed in 24 of 75 (35%) metaphases obtained from short-term culture of cells from this tumor. These findings suggest that some cases of pigmented villonodular synovitis represent clonal, neoplastic proliferations. 
5	Focal myositis. A new cause for the pediatric neck mass. Focal myositis is an inflammatory pseudotumor of skeletal muscle that may involve the head and neck. It can closely mimic either a neoplastic or infectious process. We present the case of a 7-year-old boy with a 2-week history of a painful, unilateral neck swelling, fever, and torticollis. He failed to respond to antibiotic therapy and required an open neck exploration. An incisional biopsy of the indurated, inflammatory tissue adherent to his sternocleidomastoid muscle showed focal myositis. Focal myositis is an unusual, but important possibility in the differential diagnosis of any neck mass and especially one in a child. Although its cause is unknown, it is a self-limited disease and neither excisional biopsy nor radical resection is justified. 
1	Adenotin and adenotin-like proteins coexist with adenosine receptors in mammalian tissues. The relationship of adenotin, a low-affinity adenosine-binding protein, to adenosine receptors was examined in two human tissues and two mammalian cultured cell lines. An adenosine A2 receptor exists in the membranes from platelets, PC-12 cells, and JAR cells as shown by a stimulation of adenylate cyclase related to 5'-N-ethylcarboxamidoadenosine (NECA) or a NECA-related increase in intracellular cAMP levels. In contrast, binding studies with tritiated NECA revealed typical adenotin-like low-affinity binding sites on the membranes from the sources studied with agonist potencies as follows: NECA greater than 2-chloroadenosine greater than R-PIA. No evidence was found of coupling to a guanine nucleotide regulatory protein. Solubilization of platelet and placental membranes and precipitation with polyethylene glycol separated adenotin or the adenotin-like protein from a second adenosine binding site in each tissue. The pharmacologic properties of the precipitated binding sites were compatible with an adenosine A2 receptor in platelets and an adenosine A1 receptor in placenta. Our observations indicate that adenotin-like proteins exist outside the placenta. In addition, adenotin and adenotin-like proteins coexist with the adenosine A1 or A2 receptor in a number of cells and tissues and do not couple to a guanine nucleotide regulatory protein and stimulate adenylate cyclase. Therefore, adenotin is pharmacologically distinct from adenosine receptors, and its function remains to be discovered. 
2	Coccidioidomycosis during human immunodeficiency virus infection. A review of 77 patients. Through a retrospective review, we identified 77 previously unreported cases of coccidioidomycosis during HIV infection. Patients were classified into 1 of 6 categories based on their primary clinical presentation: 20 had focal pulmonary disease (Group 1), 31 had diffuse pulmonary disease (Group 2), 4 had cutaneous coccidioidomycosis (Group 3), 9 had meningitis (Group 4), 7 had extrathoracic lymph node or liver involvement (Group 5), and 6 has positive coccidioidal serology without a clinical focus of infection (Group 6). Coccidioidal serologies were positive on initial testing in 83% of the patients in whom such serologic testing was performed. Sera from 39% of patients were positive for TP antibodies while 74% had CF antibodies. Eleven of 12 seronegative patients had pulmonary disease (Group 1 or 2). Serologic results of other patients sent to a single reference laboratory were similar, with 26% positive for immunodiffusion TP antibodies and 79% positive for immunodiffusion CF antibodies. For the 77 patients in this study, the CD4-lymphocyte count was below 0.250 X 10(9) cells/L in 46 of the 55 patients who had this test performed, and a low CD4 count was significantly associated with mortality (p less than 0.01). At the time of follow-up, 32 of the 77 patients (42%) had died. There were significantly more deaths in those with diffuse pulmonary disease (Group 2) than in other groups (p less than 0.001). Amphotericin B, ketoconazole, fluconazole, and itraconazole were all used as antifungal therapies. Outcome could not be related to the therapy used. Of note, 3 patients developed coccidioidomycosis while receiving ketoconazole for other conditions. 
5	Induction of transforming growth factor beta 1 resistance by the E1A oncogene requires binding to a specific set of cellular proteins. Transforming growth factors beta (TGF-beta s) are potent inhibitors of epithelial cell growth in culture and might play a similar role in vivo. Several studies have suggested that acquisition of TGF-beta resistance is an important step in epithelial tumor development. Here, we show that resistance to TGF-beta 1 growth inhibition can be induced by transformation of keratinocytes with the E1A, but not the ras, oncogene. Mutational analysis revealed that these effects closely correlate with the ability of E1A proteins to bind to the retinoblastoma gene product (p105) as well as to three other cellular proteins (p60, p107, and p300). Only partial resistance to TGF-beta 1 growth inhibition was elicited by E1A mutants that bind to a subset of proteins, whereas complete resistance was induced by E1A mutants that bind to all four proteins together. Total protection against TGF-beta growth inhibition was also induced by concomitant introduction into cells of an E1A mutant binding to the p60/p105/p107 proteins and one binding to p300. In parallel with these effects, epidermal transglutaminase, a marker of keratinocyte differentiation, was induced by TGF-beta in control but not in E1A-transformed cells. TGF-beta 1 receptor levels were only partially down-modulated by an intact E1A gene and not significantly affected by the various truncated mutants. Thus, the ability of E1A to induce TGF-beta resistance depends on its ability to bind, and presumably inactivate, several cellular proteins that may be involved in transmission of the TGF-beta signal and seem to act downstream from its receptor(s). 
1	Induction chemotherapy with a new regimen alternating cisplatin, fluorouracil with mitomycin, hydroxyurea and bleomycin in carcinomas of nasopharynx or other sites of the head and neck region. Sixty-six patients with locally advanced (Stages III and IV) carcinoma of the head and neck were treated with three cycles of induction chemotherapy, consisting of cisplatin, fluorouracil (FU) infusion, bleomycin, mitomycin, and hydroxyurea, followed by radiotherapy and/or surgery. There were 48 men and 18 women with a median age of 55 years (range, 18 to 75 years) and Karnofsky performance status of 80 (range, 40 to 90). Primary site was nasopharynx (28 patients), followed by larynx (12) and others (26). Forty-one (62%) patients were presented with Stage IV disease. The response rate to induction chemotherapy was 27% complete response, 50% partial response, 20% stable disease, and 3% progressive disease. There was no significant difference in response rate between patients with cancer of nasopharynx or other sites (P greater than 0.1). Survival was 61% at 24 months. Patients with cancer of nasopharynx had a better survival than those with other primaries (P = 0.033). Toxicities from chemotherapy included alopecia (73%), nausea/vomiting (66%), leukopenia (54%), stomatitis (36%), anemia (32%), thrombocytopenia (16%), and diarrhea (9%). Grade IV toxicity was not observed. Induction chemotherapy with this new regimen resulted in a high response rate but may not be superior to cisplatin and FU alone. It can be safely combined with radiotherapy as a potentially curative therapy in squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck. Chemotherapy followed by radiation therapy may yield survival similar to radical surgery in laryngeal and other head and neck cancers. 
1	In situ hybridization of prostate-specific antigen mRNA in human prostate. Prostate-specific antigen (PSA) mRNA was detected by in situ hybridization utilizing a 428 base pair [35S]-labelled cDNA probe from the 3' noncoding region of the PSA gene. Thirty six fresh surgical specimens were collected from patients undergoing radical retropubic prostatectomy for carcinoma of the prostate. Quantitative analysis of the levels of PSA mRNA in both the benign and malignant tissues was performed using an IBAS 2000 Image Analysis System. The results of this study demonstrated that there is a significant decrease in the expression of PSA mRNA in the carcinoma tissue when compared to the benign epithelium. The average binding (number of silver grains/1 x 10(4) microns. 2) for 20 specimens of malignant epithelium was 475 +/- 161 and 586 +/- 140 for 16 specimens of benign epithelium (p less than 0.05). Eleven patients had both benign and malignant tissue from the same surgical specimen available for study. From these paired specimens, the PSA mRNA expression was also significantly reduced in the malignant epithelium when compared to the benign epithelium, 445 +/- 162 and 588 +/- 135 respectively (p less than 0.005). The PSA protein was detected using a monoclonal antibody to PSA with an immunohistochemical staining technique. The PSA protein expression paralleled the expression of the PSA mRNA in the majority of the tissue sections. Many of the tumor specimens showed a heterogeneous expression of PSA, whereas all of the benign epithelium had a uniform high level of PSA expression. In conclusion, PSA mRNA and protein are located only within the glandular epithelial tissue, the expression of PSA protein parallels that of the PSA mRNA, and both the PSA protein and PSA mRNA are significantly decreased in the malignant epithelium when compared to benign prostatic epithelium. 
4	Improved results with combined donor-specific transfusion (DST) and sequential therapy protocol. A combined DST-sequential CyA therapy protocol has been described that results in optimum graft survival for 1- and 2-haplotype mismatched living related donor-recipient combinations. In addition to the excellent graft survival obtained through 4 years, lower prednisone and CyA dosage levels are achieved with significantly decreased infection rates during the posttransplant period. 
2	Chronic alcoholic gastritis. Roles of alcohol and Helicobacter pylori. We assessed the relative roles of alcohol and infection with Helicobacter pylori in the pathogenesis of chronic gastritis in alcoholic patients. Helicobacter pylori was found in 14 of 18 alcoholics with dyspepsia and was associated with chronic antral gastritis. Gastric biopsy specimens were normal in four H pylori-negative alcoholics. Studies were repeated 3 to 4 weeks after controlled abstinence. There was no change in histologic findings during this period, indicating that alcohol itself was not the major causative agent. We then eliminated H pylori in 10 subjects by giving triple therapy (bismuth subsalicylate, amoxicillin, and metronidazole). Treatment for H pylori was associated with almost complete normalization of histologic findings. Four control subjects who received antacids alone showed no improvement. Dyspeptic symptoms in H pylori-positive patients significantly improved after elimination of this organism, whereas there was no change with antacid treatment. 
4	Baroreflex sensitivity and electrophysiological correlates in patients after acute myocardial infarction. BACKGROUND. Several studies have identified transient disturbances of autonomic function during the acute and recovery phases of myocardial infarction, and it has recently been suggested that survivors of acute myocardial infarction with depressed vagal tone may be at increased risk of sudden or arrhythmic death. METHODS AND RESULTS. To investigate this hypothesis, parasympathetic function was assessed by arterial baroreflex sensitivity (BRS) testing (using the phenylephrine method) and by heart rate variability (HRV) analysis from 24-hour Holter recording in 68 patients at day 7-10 after infarction. The relation between autonomic tone and markers of arrhythmic propensity, including programmed ventricular stimulation (PVS) and late potentials in addition to other clinical variables, was examined. BRS for the whole group was 7.0 +/- 4.7 msec/mm Hg and was inversely correlated with age (r = 0.53, p less than 0.001) but not with left ventricular ejection fraction (r = 0.035, p = NS). In those patients in whom sustained monomorphic ventricular tachycardia (SMVT) was induced, BRS was significantly reduced (p = 0.001) as was HRV (p = 0.007) and left ventricular ejection fraction (p = 0.022). The strongest association between any variable (including HRV, BRS, late potentials, left ventricular ejection fraction, exercise testing, Q waves, and infarct site) and the induction of sustained monomorphic ventricular tachycardia was depressed BRS with a relative risk of 36.28 (95% confidence interval, 5-266). CONCLUSIONS. This study confirms that depressed BRS identifies a subgroup at high risk for arrhythmic events after myocardial infarction and that programmed ventricular stimulation may be safely limited to this group without any loss of predictive accuracy. 
1	Clinical evaluation of plasma abnormal prothrombin (des-gamma-carboxy prothrombin) in hepatobiliary malignancies and other diseases. Des-gamma-carboxy prothrombin (DCP), a protein induced by vitamin K absence or antagonist-II (PIVKA-II) was measured in the plasma of patients with primary hepatocellular carcinoma and those with various other hepatobiliary and pancreatic diseases. DCP levels were determined by enzyme immunoassay (E-1023), using an anti-DCP monoclonal antibody. Forty-two of the 91 patients (46.2%) with hepatocellular carcinoma had abnormally elevated levels of DCP, whereas only one of the 24 patients with hepatic cirrhosis showed a slight increase. An increase was also observed in some patients with obstructive jaundice. There was no correlation between plasma levels of DCP and those of serum alpha-fetoprotein (AFP). In most patients with hepatocellular carcinoma, plasma DCP levels normalized after curative surgical resection. Plasma DCP levels were not related to the plasma concentration of vitamin K in the patients with hepatocellular carcinoma. Plasma DCP determination may be useful in the diagnosis and postoperative monitoring of the response of hepatocellular carcinoma. 
4	Renal dysfunction after angiography; a risk factor analysis in patients with peripheral vascular disease. Angiography is required for a detailed anatomical investigation before reconstructive surgery or percutaneous transluminal angioplasty can be performed. Although angiography is a safe procedure, it is associated with renal dysfunction, usually transient, in about 10% of the cases. This study concentrates on the evaluation of renal dysfunction induced by "conventional" (i.e. film-screen) Seldinger angiography and a consecutive series of 396 angiographic procedures have been evaluated. Induced Renal Dysfunction was defined as an increase of more than 10% in the serum creatinine after angiography. To identify "risk factors" for Induced Renal Dysfunction we have studied whether clinical and angiographical variables were associated with the occurrence of Induced Renal Dysfunction. These variables included: age, hypertension, the use of antihypertensive drugs, diabetes mellitus, technique of angiography, site of contrast injection and type and quantity of contrast medium. Induced Renal Dysfunction was found in 21 cases (5.7%) and appeared to be associated with age above 70, hypertension, administration of more than 150 ml contrast medium and the presence of renal disease prior to angiography. More than 95% of the 21 patients with dysfunction had two or more of these "risk factors". The presence of diabetes was not clearly associated with Induced Renal Dysfunction and haemodialyses was not required in any of the patients. The incidence of Induced Renal Dysfunction after angiography was 5.7% which is low but not negligible. However, renal dysfunction was always transient and never severe. Furthermore, the identification of "risk factors" allows the prompt identification of patients at risk before angiography, which may help to reduce the incidence of Induced Renal Dysfunction. 
4	Cardiopulmonary resuscitation and the patient with cancer. The records of 114 cancer patients suffering cardiopulmonary arrests (CPA) during a 3-year period at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center (MSKCC) were retrospectively reviewed to identify variables predicting final outcome in these patients. Although 65.7% of the patients were successfully resuscitated, only 12 (10.5%) were discharged alive from the hospital. Median survival after discharge was 150 days. By univariate and multivariate analysis, the only variable predicting the likelihood of a patient's being discharged alive after a CPA was the performance status of the patient at the time of admission to the hospital. Thus, a patient spending more than 50% of the time in bed at the time of admission had only a 2.3% chance of being discharged alive after CPA. A thorough discussion of these findings between physicians and patients and their families is strongly recommended at the time of admission to spare cancer patients unnecessary invasive resuscitative procedures. 
3	The comportmental learning disabilities of early frontal lobe damage. Two adult patients are described who suffered bilateral prefrontal damage early in life and who subsequently came to psychiatric attention because of severely aberrant behaviour. A battery of developmental psychology paradigms (not previously used to assess neurologically impaired individuals) showed that social and moral development of these 2 patients was arrested at an immature stage. In comparison with other types of brain damage which disrupt cognitive development, frontal damage acquired early in life appears to provide the neurological substrate for a special type of learning disability in the realms of insight, foresight, social judgement, empathy, and complex reasoning. 
5	Polyneuropathy syndromes associated with serum antibodies to sulfatide and myelin-associated glycoprotein. We studied a series of 64 patients with sensory +/- motor peripheral neuropathies by comparing clinical and physiologic features to serum antibody reactivity against compounds containing sulfated carbohydrate moieties. We determined antibody reactivity by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) using purified glycolipids and glycoproteins as antigens, and we used high-performance thin-layer chromatography and Western blotting to test the specificity of results. Twelve patients with high titers of IgM antibodies directed against the myelin-associated glycoprotein (MAG) had sensory-motor polyneuropathies with physiologic evidence of demyelination. IgM antibody reactivity to MAG was associated with an IgM serum M protein in five patients. Eight other patients, most with sensory greater than motor polyneuropathies, had high titers of antibody reactivity to sulfatide but not of IgM to MAG. Two had an associated IgM paraprotein. None of the patients with selective serum antisulfatide activity had predominantly demyelinating features on physiologic testing. We conclude that (1) high ELISA titers of antibodies to MAG may be more common than previously suspected in patients with chronic demyelinating sensory-motor neuropathies, and (2) the presence of high titers of antisulfatide antibodies in serum may provide clues to the pathogenesis of otherwise idiopathic, axonal, predominantly sensory neuropathies. 
1	Survey of Alabama physicians' use of mammography, 1989. In early 1989 we surveyed by questionnaire Alabama primary care physicians (N = 1800) concerning their attitudes toward and use of mammography. There were 681 respondents (37.8%). The majority (83%) recommend mammograms for their patients according to the American Cancer Society guidelines and obtain baseline studies in asymptomatic women between the ages of 35 and 40 years. It appears that the cost of mammograms is decreasing in Alabama; a screening study was available for $50 or less to 34% of responding physicians. Almost one half (48%) of the physician respondents believe that more than 50% of their patients have had at least one mammogram. 
3	Microsaccadic flutter. Microsaccadic flutter is a rare symptomatic saccadic oscillation that has been reported only twice previously. Here we describe 5 patients with this disorder. The oscillation is horizontal, has a frequency of 15-30 Hz, an amplitude of 0.1-0.5 degrees, and cannot be seen with the unaided eye. It is usually not associated with any underlying neurological disorder. We hypothesize that microsaccadic flutter is due to malfunction of the brainstem omnipause neurons. 
5	The effects of epidural anesthesia on the Doppler velocimetry of umbilical and uterine arteries in normal and hypertensive patients during active term labor. To study the effects of epidural anesthesia on uterine and umbilical artery blood flow in preeclampsia, we observed 25 patients in active labor at 36 or more weeks' gestation. Seven had preeclampsia, eight had chronic hypertension, and ten had no complications. Doppler velocimetry of the uterine and umbilical arteries was performed before and after intravenous fluid loading and at 30 and 60 minutes after epidural blockade. Maternal vital signs and fetal heart rate were monitored continuously. After epidural block, mean maternal blood pressure fell significantly in all groups, but no maternal hypotension was observed. Mean maternal and fetal heart rates were unchanged. After epidural block, mean uterine artery systolic-diastolic (S-D) ratios did not change in the chronic-hypertension and normal groups, but fell significantly in the preeclamptic group to values similar to those of the normal group. Umbilical artery S-D ratios did not change in any group. In preeclamptic pregnancy, epidural anesthesia may help to reduce uterine artery vasospasm and may benefit intrapartum fetal well-being. 
4	Edge detection versus densitometry for assessing coronary stenting quantitatively. The optimal method used to analyze quantitatively the immediate angiographic results of coronary stenting in the coronary arteries has not been studied. Accordingly, minimal luminal cross-sectional area was determined by 2 methods, edge detection and densitometry, in 19 patients who underwent percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA) and then coronary stent implantation for symptomatic coronary stenoses. The correlation coefficient, 0.73 before angioplasty, decreased to 0.59 after coronary angioplasty and then increased to 0.83 after stent implantation. The mean differences between edge detection and densitometric determinations of minimal luminal cross-sectional area were 0.31 +/- 0.51 mm2 before PTCA, -0.38 +/- 1.22 mm2 after angioplasty and 0.35 +/- 0.79 mm2 after coronary stenting. It is concluded that, although the correlation and variability in the measurement of minimal luminal cross-sectional area between edge detection and densitometry deteriorate after PTCA, they are improved after stenting, probably because of smoothing of the vessel contours by the stent and remodeling of the stented segment into a more circular configuration. Therefore, in the stented coronary artery, edge detection and densitometry are equally acceptable methods of analysis. 
1	Enterogenous cyst of the cerebellopontine angle cistern: case report. A case of an enterogenous cyst located in the cerebellopontine angle cistern is presented. These cysts have usually been found in the spinal canal, and their intracranial occurrence is exceptional. In the present case, the cyst was lined histologically by a single epithelial layer of cuboidal cells with some glandular structures resembling the fundic glands of the stomach. The unusual location of the cyst and its histological features are discussed. 
4	Deep femoral to anterior tibial bypass after failed femoropopliteal reconstructions. Deep femoral to anterior tibial artery bypass is a reconstructive technique occasionally applicable when more conventional attempts at revascularization of the distal portion of the leg have failed. Three such patients, in whom the anterior tibial was the only distal patent branch of the popliteal artery, had severe symptoms of arterial insufficiency. Deep femoral to anterior tibial bypass was done using autogenous The distal portion of the deep femoral artery was exposed through an anteromedial distal thigh approach. The three patients have been followed up for a mean of 20.3 months, and each maintains graft patency and marked symptomatic improvement. 
4	Dynamic cardiomyoplasty in chronic Chagas' heart disease: clinicopathological data. We report a 44-year-old man with chronic chagasic cardiomyopathy who underwent latissimus dorsi dynamic cardiomyoplasty and died 4 months later. The clinicopathological findings are discussed, and the literature is reviewed. 
5	Prosthetic above-knee femoropopliteal bypass for intermittent claudication. There is no consensus about the most appropriate management of the patient with intermittent claudication due to a superficial femoral artery occlusion. To evaluate the natural history of prosthetic above-knee femoropopliteal (AKFP) bypass, 200 operations for intermittent claudication were reviewed. One hundred AKFP bypasses were done with PTFE and 100 with dacron. In the 30 day postoperative period, four PTFE and three dacron grafts occluded without consequence and only one patient died. Analysis of results by the life-table method demonstrated statistically similar primary graft patency rates at five years (PTFE 65% SE +/- 6.5, dacron 57% +/- 6.2) and ten years (PTFE 31% +/- 18/9, dacron 32% +/- 13.2) (p greater than 0.10). Redo procedures (e.g., thrombectomy, angioplasty) were necessary on 21 grafts (12 PTFE, 9 dacron) and "secondary" patency rates at five years were 76% PTFE and 62% dacron; no grafts which required a redo procedure were patent at ten year follow-up. Major amputations during ten year follow-up were necessary in 16 (8%) patients; all amputations were in diabetic patients. Survival rates were 79% at five and 42% at ten years. An anticipated, the leading cause of death was cardiac related (25 patients); 28 (14%) patients underwent aortocoronary bypass during follow-up. A prosthetic AKFP bypass graft is a safe and durable operation which provides relief from the symptoms of intermittent claudication while allowing for the preservation of the saphenous vein for use later in the coronary or infrapopliteal circulations, should the need arise. These results indicate that the risk of amputation after AKFP is no greater than the natural history of untreated claudication; however, AKFP offers a significant improvement in life-style. 
5	A controlled trial of psychological treatment for the irritable bowel syndrome. One hundred two patients with irritable bowel syndrome were studied in a controlled trial of psychological treatment involving psychotherapy, relaxation, and standard medical treatment compared with standard medical treatment alone. Patients were only selected if their symptoms had not improved with standard medical treatment over the previous 6 months. At 3 months, the treatment group showed significantly greater improvement than the controls on both gastroenterologists' and patients' ratings of diarrhea and abdominal pain, but constipation changed little. Good prognostic factors included overt psychiatric symptoms and intermittent pain exacerbated by stress, whereas those with constant abdominal pain were helped little by this treatment. This study has demonstrated that psychological treatment is feasible and effective in two thirds of those patients with irritable bowel syndrome who do not respond to standard medical treatment. 
4	Successful surgical treatment of subaortic stenosis caused by an accessory mitral valve. A 22-month-old boy with subaortic stenosis was found to have relatively mature mitral valve tissue beneath the aortic valve, associated with a hypertrophic and prominent interventricular septum. This tissue caused obstruction of the left ventricular outflow tract and resulted in a pressure gradient of 70 mmHg between the aorta and the left ventricle. Surgical treatment was successfully performed to excise the tissue and part of the hypertrophic ventricular septum. Results of microscopic examination of the resected specimen are shown and discussed. 
1	Social environment and social support. Research on the relevance of social support to cancer has been plentiful since the first American Cancer Society workshop on methodological issues in behavioral and psychosocial science. Nonetheless, critical shortcomings continue to characterize the attempt empirically to establish such things as the extent to which social support predicts adjustment to cancer diagnosis and treatment. Prominent among these is the failure to adequately address large elements of the social structure, such as social class and urbanization, and to investigate how they shape the well being of persons with or at risk for cancer and their caregivers. We recommend that more psychosocial research on the link between social support and cancer be conducted within populations beset by poverty and without adequate access to health care. Funding is needed for the training and maintenance of multidisciplinary and multicultural teams of researchers working within community-based organizations and hospitals serving the underserved. 
5	The long-term prognosis of patients with out-of-hospital cardiac arrest but no inducible ventricular tachycardia. The long-term prognosis of patients successfully resuscitated from cardiac arrest who do not have acute precipitating factors and in whom ventricular arrhythmias cannot be induced during baseline electrophysiologic testing is controversial. The purpose of this investigation was to evaluate the long-term risk of recurrent sudden death and determine the clinical, angiographic, hemodynamic, and electrophysiologic predictors of recurrent cardiac arrest in such patients. Twenty-six (37%) of 71 consecutive patients with a single episode of aborted sudden death did not have inducible ventricular arrhythmias (less than 7 intraventricular responses) during baseline drug-free electrophysiologic study and they form the basis of this report. Their mean age was 54 +/- 13 (mean +/- SD) years and the left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) was 0.47 +/- 0.17. After a mean follow-up period of 16 months, 11 patients (42%) had a recurrent cardiac arrest (fatal in 10 patients). The actuarial incidence of recurrent cardiac arrest was 30 +/- 10% at 1 year and 55 +/- 13% at 3 years. Patients with LVEF less than or equal to 0.40 had a significantly higher occurrence of recurrent cardiac arrest than those with LVEF greater than 0.40 (p = 0.02; 1-year actuarial incidence of 57 +/- 17% versus 13 +/- 19%). Patients with recurrent sudden death had a significantly greater incidence of dilated cardiomyopathy (55% versus 7%; p = 0.02) and baseline frequent premature ventricular contractions (PVCs greater than 10/hr; 64% versus 17%, p = 0.036) or nonsustained ventricular tachycardia (36% versus 0%; p = 0.37) than patients without these characteristics. 
1	The presence of human papillomavirus type 16 in squamous cell carcinoma of the proximal finger and reconstruction with a bilobed transposition flap. In a 71 year old white female a clinically diagnosed keratoacanthoma on the dorsum of the right third finger was removed using Mohs micrographic surgery and histologically diagnosed as a squamous cell carcinoma. It was shown by dot blot hybridization to have HPV type 16 DNA in the tumor. The wound was reconstructed with a bilobed transposition flap. 
2	A tongue force measurement system for the assessment of oral-phase swallowing disorders. A computer-aided measuring system using a highly sensitive beam transducer has been developed to provide a quantitative, reliable measure of tongue strength. This tool has application in both the diagnosis and treatment of dysphagic patients with oral-stage dysfunction. The device is customized to comfortably adapt to each individual. Audiovisual feedback is used to enhance subject interest and motivation. The device has proven reliable in measurements of upward and side tongue thrust in six able-bodied subjects measured during five separate sessions. It has also been used with two dysphagic patients. 
3	Comparison of symptom characteristics of indwelling ureteral catheters. The signs and symptoms produced by 4 different types of 7F double pigtail catheters, including Cook polyurethane pigtail stent, Surgitek Silitek Uropass, Cook C-Flex and Van-Tec Soft stent, were analyzed prospectively. The stents were placed in 45 men and 28 women ranging in age from 23 to 72 years old. A total of 44 catheters had a suture attached to the bladder end of the catheter, which exited from the urethral meatus to facilitate removal. The remaining 29 catheters had no suture attached. Symptoms were evaluated at 2 and 6 days after insertion and 1 week following removal of the catheter, and included urinary frequency, nocturia, hematuria, flank pain, suprapubic pain, dysuria and pain on removal of the catheter. Frequency and nocturia were evaluated in minutes, pain was graded on a subjective scale of 0 (no pain) to 10 (severe pain), and dysuria and hematuria were assessed qualitatively. There were no significant differences among the 4 types of catheters in terms of frequency, nocturia, hematuria, flank pain, suprapubic pain and dysuria. In addition, there was no significant difference in urinary symptoms between catheters with and without a suture at either 2 or 6 days after insertion nor was there any difference in pain on removal of catheters with (mean 3.9) and without (mean 5.0) suture. We found that catheter composition and use of suture to facilitate removal did not significantly affect patient morbidity. 
1	Premalignant lesions and cancers of the skin in the general population: evaluation of the role of human papillomaviruses. To evaluate the role of human papillomaviruses (HPV) in the development of premalignant lesions and cancers of the skin in the general population, 314 biopsies obtained from 227 patients with benign neoplasms, premalignant lesions, and cancers of the skin and from 25 patients with squamous cell carcinoma of the lip were analyzed by Southern blot hybridization. DNA probes specific for various cutaneous and genital HPV types were used in hybridizations conducted under nonstringent or stringent conditions. HPV DNA sequences were only detected in eight specimens obtained from six patients: HPV 34 in one case of periungual Bowen's disease, HPV 36 and an as yet uncharacterized HPV in two cases of actinic keratosis, HPV 20 in one case of basal cell carcinoma, an as yet unrecognized HPV in one case of squamous cell carcinoma, and HPV 16 in one case of squamous cell carcinoma of the lip. None of the specimens of cutaneous horn and keratoacanthoma contained detectable HPV DNA. In contrast, HPV DNA sequences, mostly HPV 16, were detected in 13 of 23 cases of anogenital Bowen's disease and invasive Bowen's carcinoma. HPV DNA sequences were not detected in 90 cutaneous samples further analyzed by the polymerase chain-reaction technique, using amplification primers that contain conserved sequences among the genomes of HPV. These results strongly suggest that the known HPV types play only a minor role, if any, in skin carcinogenesis in the general population. 
3	Corticosteroid-responsive dominantly inherited neuropathy in childhood. We describe three children with corticosteroid-responsive inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy from families with dominantly inherited neuropathy. There were atypical clinical, electrophysiologic, and pathologic characteristics that suggested a coexistent inflammatory demyelinating neuropathy and that should alert the clinician to the possibility of an associated acquired, potentially treatable disorder. 
5	Axial rotation of the lumbar spine and the effect of flexion. An in vitro and in vivo biomechanical study. A series of experiments were performed on eight whole, cadaveric lumbar spines and on eight male volunteers to determine whether axial rotation changed with subjects bending forward compared with being in a neutral posture and whether rotation was affected by articular tropism. Kirschner wires were inserted into the spinous processes of the eight cadaveric lumbar spines, and the axial rotation of the wires was measured while the spine was rotated in a torsion apparatus. Similarly, Steinmann pins were inserted into the spinous processes of L3, L4, and L5 of the eight volunteers, and the axial rotation of the pins was measured while the subjects rotated in a torsion apparatus. Axial rotation was found to be less when combined with forward flexion, and articular tropism did not influence the amplitude of rotation. 
1	Studies evaluating antioxidants and beta-carotene as chemopreventives. Cancer chemoprevention research takes leads from epidemiologic and laboratory research and develops them through in vitro and in vivo preclinical research and initial human studies into randomized controlled clinical trials. At present, the chemoprevention program is sponsoring 21 human efficacy studies. These trials are testing the potential of agents (beta-carotene, folic acid, 13-cis retinoic acid, 4-hydroxyphenyl retinamide, vitamins C and E, and minerals) as inhibitors of a variety of cancers in humans (colon, lung, esophagus, cervix, bladder, and skin). Endpoints in these studies include overall incidence of cancer, incidence of specific cancers, rate of regression or progression of preneoplastic changes, and changes in cellular or biochemical parameters. Study participants include volunteers from the general population; populations at high risk for cancer because of occupation, lifestyle, or place of residence; persons with previously treated cancers; and persons with preneoplastic lesions. Study designs include single agent randomization, combination of agents and complete factorial designs. 
1	Catecholamine-induced cardiomyopathy in multiple endocrine neoplasia. A histologic, ultrastructural, and biochemical study. A catecholamine-induced dilated cardiomyopathy is reported in a patient with multiple endocrine neoplasia, type 3. A histologic and ultrastructural study has been undertaken in cardiac biopsy samples, together with determination of myocardial Ca++ and cellular membrane fatty acids. Contraction band necrosis of cardiocytes with supercontraction of sarcomeres progressing to myofibrolysis and increased levels of myocardial Ca++ have been found as morphologic and biochemical abnormalities, respectively. No lipoperoxidation of cellular membranes or an alpha-adrenergic mediated reduction of coronary supply could be recognized in the study. We indicate a receptor-mediated intracellular Ca++ overload as the main abnormality responsible for myocardial impairment. 
2	Pharynx: value of oblique projections for radiographic examination. The utility of oblique views for augmenting standard posteroanterior and lateral double-contrast radiography of the pharynx was examined. Over an 8-month period, two oblique views were added to the standard posteroanterior and lateral views of the pharynx during routine upper gastrointestinal studies in 102 patients divided into two groups. Group 1 consisted of 81 patients without suspected pharyngeal or esophageal disease who demonstrated what was considered to be normal anatomy on all radiographic views. Group 2 consisted of 21 patients who were known or suspected to have pathologic abnormality of the pharynx. The members of this latter group each demonstrated various abnormal pharyngeal anatomy on the standard views. In just over half of these cases the oblique projection contributed significant information not obtained with conventional views. Therefore, the authors conclude that oblique images are a beneficial addition to the diagnostic evaluation of patients highly suspected of having pharyngeal disease. 
1	The pathology of nonpalpable breast cancer. A principal goal of mammographic screening is the early detection of breast cancer. We reviewed records of 125 women who were referred because of nonpalpable, suspicious abnormalities on mammogram, which subsequently proved to be cancer, requiring mammographic localization biopsy and subsequent surgery for therapy. We found that 72 (57.6%) had invasive tumors, 15 (12%) showed evidence of microinvasion and 38 (30.4%) were noninvasive. A total of 115 patients had lymphadenectomy as part of their definitive surgery. Nine (12.7%) of the patients with infiltrating tumors had between one and 10 malignant nodes on histologic section. None of the patients with noninvasive or microinvasive tumors were found to have involved nodes. The mammographic abnormalities which led to biopsy in our series were: calcifications in 74 (59.2%) patients, mass lesions in 39 (31.2%), mass lesions with calcifications in 11 (8.8%), and asymmetry in one (0.8%). Of the nine patients with nodal metastases, seven (77.8%) had a mass with or without calcifications as the indication for biopsy. Increasing tumor size was found to correlate with invasive tumors on histopathologic examination and the incidence of lymph node metastases. Thirty-seven (54.4%) of the patients with infiltrating tumors had a tumor size greater than 1 cm. Further, seven (77.8%) of the nine lymph node positive patients had tumors between 1 and 3 cm in size. Of note, however, is that two (22.2%) patients with microscopic tumors had involved nodes. The 4-year actuarial survival in patients with infiltrating tumors was 85.2 per cent, while that for patients with noninvasive or microinvasive tumors was 100 per cent (median follow-up of 20 months). 
5	Surgery or radiation for early cervical cancer. In summary, neither radiation nor surgery is clearly superior. The benefits of surgery include: 1) emotional satisfaction that the tumor has been removed, 2) accuracy of surgical staging, 3) preservation of the ovaries, 4) no secondary uterine cancer (a very uncommon problem), and 5) complications that are more readily correctable. Radiation offers the major advantages of being useful in most patients regardless of age or medical condition and is the choice for large cancers. Because stage IB cervical cancer is a very diverse pathological entity with a number of potential prognostic factors (including cell type, depth of invasion, tumor volume, lymphatic space involvement, and occult lymph node metastases), and because patients present with a number of other conditions (including excess weight, advanced age, prior pelvic surgery or infection, and severe medical illness), we are fortunate to have two good methods for treating cervical cancer. Prospective randomized studies will be necessary in the future to better define specific advantages in the various clinical settings. But, in general, the following have proven most expedient: 1) class I hysterectomy, for microinvasive cancer of 3 mm invasion or less without lymphatic space involvement, 2) modified, extended hysterectomy (class II) and pelvic lymphadenectomy for lesions of 3 mm and lymph vascular space involvement or when the lesion seems to just exceed 3 mm and for very early adenocarcinoma, 3) an extended hysterectomy (class III) and pelvic lymphadenectomy for larger IA2, IB, and IIA lesions that are less than 4 cm, particularly for the pregnant or younger patient, and when ovarian conservation is desired, 4) radiation therapy is used for lesions over 4 cm and for women with severe medical illness making extended hysterectomy too hazardous, 5) combination therapy and chemotherapy are now reserved for study in poor prognosis patients with very large lesions (greater than 6 cm), occult metastases, and unfavorable histologic criteria (Table 2). 
1	Misinterpretation of the upper parathyroid adenoma on thallium-201/technetium-99m subtraction scintigraphy. Pre-operative thallium-technetium subtraction scintigraphy of 50 patients with primary hyperparathyroidism, which was subsequently proven on histology to be due to an adenoma, was compared with operative findings. Six scans were negative and seven uninterpretable. Of the remaining 37 patients, 34 had correct scan prediction of the anatomical locations of the adenomas. On examination of the origins of the adenomas, all six scintigraphic predictions of upper adenomas corresponded to tumours arising from the upper gland found at operation. Of the 25 lower predictions, there was one false positive and 16 were correct, i.e. of lower gland origin, but eight were found to originate from the upper gland. This misinterpretation is though to be due to the prolapse of an adenoma arising from the upper gland towards the lower pole of the thyroid, thereby mimicking a lower lesion on the scan. 
2	Role of laparoscopy in the evaluation of patients with suspected hepatic or peritoneal malignancy. The purpose of this study was to determine the role of laparoscopy in patients with suspected hepatic or peritoneal malignancy and a normal computerized tomograph (CT). Twenty-five consecutive patients with a normal liver and no peritoneal lesions on CT were evaluated. Patients with a documented primary neoplasm or a positive ascitic fluid cytology were excluded. At laparoscopy, malignancy was documented by biopsy in 12 patients for an incidence of 48%. Of the patients with exudative ascites, 75% had peritoneal metastases. In addition seven patients had benign liver disease documented by laparoscopic biopsy. Liver enzymes were not helpful in distinguishing benign and malignant disease in this group of patients. This study indicates that a negative CT does not exclude liver or peritoneal malignancy. Laparoscopy has a significant yield in patients with a negative CT suspected of having hepatic or peritoneal malignancy and is the procedure of choice in evaluating these patients. 
5	Posthypoxic glucose supplement reduces hypoxic-ischemic brain damage in the neonatal rat. We evaluated the effect of posthypoxic glucose supplement in a neonatal hypoxic-ischemic animal model. Seven-day-old rats underwent bilateral ligation of the carotid arteries, followed by exposure to an 8% oxygen atmosphere for 1 hour. The extent of hypoxic-ischemic brain damage was assessed histologically 72 hours later. Glucose load immediately after the end of the hypoxic exposure reduced the volume of neocortical infarction to 37% of the unsupplemented value, and attenuated ischemic damage in the striatum and the dentate gyrus. At the end of the hypoxic exposure, the brain level of glucose was 0.3 mmol/kg and the level of lactate 9 mmol/kg. Glucose supplement produced a rapid rise in brain glucose level to 3 to 5 mmol/kg over the next 2 hours. Lactate in both brain and plasma gradually fell toward the baseline level during the first hour of recovery. Posthypoxic glucose supplement slightly retarded lactate restitution. At any period of this neonatal model, brain lactate levels did not exceed the toxic level, which is postulated to be responsible for cerebral infarction in adult ischemic models. These results illustrate the important role of glucose in the development of neonatal hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy and the fact that full cortical infarction can develop even if brain lactate levels are low. 
4	Modification of atrioventricular node transmission properties by intraoperative neodymium-YAG laser photocoagulation in dogs. The purpose of this study was to test the feasibility of neodymium-yttrium-aluminum-garnet (Nd-YAG) laser photocoagulation of the atrioventricular (AV) node to control the ventricular rate during rapid atrial rhythms without creating AV block. In 12 dogs on normothermic cardiopulmonary bypass, short laser pulses were delivered to an area between the coronary sinus orifice and the site of the most proximally recorded His deflection until second degree AV block occurred at a paced atrial rate of 200 beats/min. Long-term effects on AV node function were followed up for 3 months. Three animals developed chronic high grade AV block. In nine animals with preserved 1:1 conduction, the mean (+/- SEM) critical atrial cycle length resulting in AV node Wenckebach periodicity increased from 183 +/- 6 to 261 +/- 24 ms (+43%), the mean RR interval during induced atrial fibrillation increased from 248 +/- 14 to 330 +/- 27 ms (+32%) and the shortest RR interval during atrial fibrillation increased from 215 +/- 11 to 275 +/- 20 ms (+28%). Laser effects were not reversed by isoproterenol infusion. Histologic examination of the irradiated area showed fibrotic changes in the AV node and fatty metamorphosis. This study suggests that 1) graded Nd-YAG laser photocoagulation of the AV node region in dogs results in long-term modification of anterograde AV node transmission properties; 2) 1:1 conduction during sinus rhythm usually remains preserved, but ventricular rate during rapid atrial rhythms is chronically reduced; and 3) progression to high grade AV block occurs in a minority of animals. 
3	New approaches in the rehabilitation of the traumatic high level quadriplegic. The use of noninvasive alternatives to tracheostomy for ventilatory support have been described in the patient management of various neuromuscular disorders. The use of these techniques for patients with traumatic high level quadriplegia, however, is hampered by the resort to tracheostomy in the acute hospital setting. Twenty traumatic high level quadriplegic patients on intermittent positive pressure ventilation (IPPV) via tracheostomy with little or no ability for unassisted breathing were converted to noninvasive ventilatory support methods and had their tracheostomy sites closed. Four additional patients were ventilated by noninvasive methods without tracheostomy. These methods included the use of body ventilators and the noninvasive intermittent positive airway pressure alternatives of IPPV via the mouth, nose, or custom acrylic strapless oral-nasal interface (SONI). Overnight end-tidal pCO2 studies and monitoring of oxyhemoglobin saturation (SaO2) were used to adjust ventilator volumes and to document effective ventilation during sleep. No significant complications have resulted from the use of these methods over a period of 45 patient-years. Elimination of the tracheostomy permitted significant free time by glossopharyngeal breathing for four patients, two of whom had no measurable vital capacity. We conclude that noninvasive ventilatory support alternatives can be effective and deserve further study in this patient population. 
3	Resistance to atracurium-induced neuromuscular blockade in patients with intractable seizure disorders treated with anticonvulsants. Previous studies have demonstrated that, with the exception of atracurium, resistance to the neuromuscular blocking effects of various muscle relaxants develops in patients receiving anticonvulsant therapy. We studied the effects of 0.5 mg/kg IV atracurium in 53 neurosurgical patients: 21 nonepileptic patients receiving no anticonvulsant therapy (MED = 0); 14 epileptic patients treated with carbamazepine for years (MED = 1); and 18 epileptic patients treated with carbamazepine plus either phenytoin or valproic acid for years (MED = 2). The evoked compound electromyogram of the adductor pollicis brevis was recorded, and results were analyzed using analysis of covariance, with weight and age as covariables. The onset time was not significantly different among the three groups. Times for recovery of baseline and train-of-four responses to stimuli were significantly shorter in the MED = 1 and MED = 2 groups than in control patients (MED = 0). The recovery index (time between 25% and 75% recovery of baseline electromyogram values) was progressively shorter in the three groups (MED = 0: 8.02 min; MED = 1: 5.93 min; MED = 2: 1.96 min; P less than 0.001). This study demonstrates that atracurium, when used on epileptic patients requiring long-term (that is, years of) anticonvulsant therapy, has a shorter duration of action than when used in nonepileptic patients. 
1	Is local recurrence of minor importance for metastases in soft tissue sarcoma? The authors analyzed the relationship between treatment, local recurrence, and metastases in a population-based series of 375 patients with soft tissue sarcoma of the extremities and the trunk wall. Treatment was inadequate (marginal excision alone) in 107 patients, local recurrence occurred in 112, and 128 patients developed metastases. Local recurrence was 3.5 times more common after inadequate treatment than after adequate and 2.5 times more common in patients with metastases than in those without. However, metastases were only 1.2 times more common after inadequate treatment than after adequate. Of the 128 patients who developed metastases, 63 had local recurrence and 65 had not. In these two subgroups the timing of metastases and the distribution of clinicopathologic factors--age, sex, tumor size, localization, depth, histotype, and malignancy grade--were similar. These findings indicate that local recurrence is of minor importance for development of metastases in soft tissue sarcoma. The increased local recurrence rate in metastatic tumors may be an expression of the aggressiveness of the primary tumor; highly malignant tumors combine a potential both for local and distant spread. 
1	Macrophage colony-stimulating factor activity in malignant pleural effusions. Its augmentation by intrapleural interleukin-2 infusions. The activity of endogenous colony-stimulating factor (CSF) in malignant pleural effusions of lung cancer patients before and during daily intrapleural infusions of recombinant interleukin-2 (IL-2) was measured quantitatively by colony-forming bioassay and radioimmunoassay (RIA). Before therapy, malignant pleural effusions had various levels of CSF activities, and this CSF activity was neutralized almost completely by anti-M-CSF antibody. RIA also showed that the effusions contained various amounts of M-CSF. Daily intrapleural infusion of recombinant IL-2 caused significant increase in the CSF activities and M-CSF levels in pleural effusions. These results indicate that in vivo treatment with IL-2 induces production of endogenous M-CSF. 
1	Ki-B5: a monoclonal antibody unrelated to CD45 recognizes normal and neoplastic human B cells in routine paraffin sections. In the search for immunoreagents appropriate for the histopathologic diagnosis of malignant B-cell lymphomas in routinely processed paraffin sections, a new monoclonal antibody, Ki-B5, was generated using a high-grade B-cell lymphoma as the immunogene. Ki-B5 is a mouse IgG1/kappa that recognizes five protein fractions of about 84, 82, 55, 48, and 27 Kd after biosynthetic radiolabeling and immunoprecipitation. Protein fractions with the molecular weights of approximately 84 and 82 Kd were expressed on the cell surface and show that Ki-B5 is probably unrelated to CD45. It was possible through electron microscopy to visualize the membrane-bound portion of Ki-B5. Extensive immunohistologic studies on normal human tissue and various neoplasias demonstrated the high specificity of Ki-B5 to normal human B cells and a minor subgroup of plasma cells. Except for ML-2, which is a myelomonocytic human cell line, Ki-B5 exclusively recognized the B-cell lineage, including EB-3, BALL-1, and NALM-1. All carcinomas, sarcomas, and malignant melanomas tested with Ki-B5 were negative. Although normal granulocytes and monocytes were constantly negative, three of eight myelomonocytic leukemias coreacted with this antibody. Eight of the 57 T-cell lymphomas studied were positive to Ki-B5. Five were classified as lymphoblastic, two represented T8-CLL, and one was classified as immunoblastic T-cell lymphoma. Only 3 of 126 cases of B-cell lymphoma, including rare types not considered in the current classifications, were negative to Ki-B5. Plasmacytomas were also negative, except for one case. Irrespective of the cases of lymphoblastic lymphoma and plasmacytoma, Ki-B5 represents a new monoclonal antibody appropriate for the diagnosis and immunophenotyping of malignant lymphomas in routinely processed paraffin sections. 
3	Headache. Public health problem. Headache is, and apparently always has been, a frequent pain syndrome. It is reported in American and Western European societies in very high percentages of the population. Headache, and specifically severe headache, have also been reported as prevalent from a variety of societies worldwide, although prevalence rates have varied (they are very low, for example, in the People's Republic of China). Whether prevalence varies with different socioeconomic groups remains uncertain. Severe headache and specifically migraine is, for reasons still unknown, much more common in women, and, in most studies, is reported to decrease in prevalence in older age groups. Positive family histories are common, but the precise role of genetics is unknown. A major problem in the epidemiologic studies remains the difficulty of uniform definition of headache syndromes. 
4	Ventricular load optimization by unloading therapy in patients with heart failure. The effects of unloading a depressed heart were assessed in terms of optimal coupling between the ventricle and arterial system. To assess the effects of preload on ventricular load coupling, preload was reduced with a lower body negative pressure of -20 mm Hg. Nitroprusside was used to evaluate the effects of afterload on the coupling under the condition that preload reduction was comparable to that with lower body negative pressure. In 13 patients with heart failure (ejection fraction 32 +/- 3%, mean +/- SE), direct arterial pressure was simultaneously recorded with the left ventricular echocardiogram as the pressure was elevated by phenylephrine. Left ventricular contractile properties were defined by the slope (Ees) of the end-systolic pressure-volume relation. The effective arterial elastance (Ea) was expressed by the slope of the end-systolic pressure-stroke volume relation. Left ventricular external work, end-systolic potential energy and work efficiency, defined as external work per pressure volume area (external work + potential energy), were determined. Baseline ventricular load coupling in these patients was characterized by an increase in the ratio of arterial elastance to ventricular elastance (Ea/Ees) (1.96 +/- 0.31). This ratio decreased significantly, to 1.45 +/- 0.22, with nitroprusside, and increased to 2.37 +/- 0.34 with lower body negative pressure. Therefore, end-systolic potential energy was decreased by nitroprusside but was unaltered by lower body negative pressure while external work was comparably decreased by both manipulations, indicating that work efficiency was significantly augmented with nitroprusside but declined with lower body negative pressure. 
2	Serial prothrombin time as prognostic indicator in paracetamol induced fulminant hepatic failure. OBJECTIVE--To find out whether changes in the daily prothrombin time are of prognostic importance in patients with paracetamol induced fulminant hepatic failure. DESIGN--Retrospective study. SETTING--The Liver Unit, King's College Hospital, London. PATIENTS--150 Consecutive patients with paracetamol induced fulminant hepatic failure admitted between October 1986 and February 1989. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE--Death. RESULTS--Of the 150 patients, 72 (48%) died. In all, 34 of the 37 (92%) patients with a peak prothrombin time of greater than or equal to 180 seconds died as did 20 of the 41 (49%) with a time of 130-179 seconds, nine of the 25 (36%) with a time of 90-129 seconds, and nine of the 47 (19%) with a time of less than 90 seconds. Of the 42 patients with a continuing rise in prothrombin time between days 3 and 4 after overdose, 39 died (93%) compared with 21 of the 96 (22%) in whom the prothrombin time fell. CONCLUSIONS--These data indicate that a continued increase in prothrombin time on day 4 after overdose and a peak prothrombin time of greater than or equal to 180 seconds identify at an early stage those patients with a less than 8% chance of survival. Liver transplantation should be considered in patients meeting either of these criteria. 
2	Enteroaggregative Escherichia coli elaborate a heat-stable enterotoxin demonstrable in an in vitro rabbit intestinal model. Enteroaggregative Escherichia coli (EAggEC) have been associated with persistent diarrhea in young children, but little is known about its pathogenesis. We assayed for enterotoxic activity in culture filtrates (CF) of EAggEC strains in Ussing chambers mounted with rabbit ileal mucosa. CF from strain 17-2, a prototype Chilean EAggEC strain, caused a greater rise in potential difference and short circuit current (SCC) than that seen in HB101 control, and this effect was abolished by protease pretreatment and partially stable after heat treatment. Ultrafiltration of 17-2 CF preparations localized the active moiety to the 2-5 kD Mr size range. CF from HB101 transformed with the 17-2 plasmid showed Ussing chamber activity. less than 10-kD CF fractions from five of six other EAggEC strains screened in Ussing chambers gave SCC responses of similar magnitude to 17-2. The 17-2 CF activity was not neutralized after pretreatment with polyclonal anti-STa antibody. Additionally, all of the seven EAggEC strains studied were nonreactive by heat-stable enterotoxin variant STa ELISA, were negative in the suckling mouse assay, and failed to hybridize with heat-stable enterotoxin variant STh and STp DNA probes. In summary, our data indicate that 17-2 produces a low molecular weight, partially heat-stable, protease-sensitive enterotoxin which appears to be plasmid associated, and genetically and immunologically distinct from E. coli STa. Preliminary screening suggests that this tox+ phenotype may be common among EAggEC. 
1	Carcinoma of female urethra. Manitoba experience: 1958-1987. Fourteen female patients with primary urethral carcinoma were treated at the Manitoba Cancer Foundation in the last twenty-nine years. The relationship of natural history to the stage, location, and therapeutic modality has been reviewed. A higher stage and length of urethral involvement affected prognosis negatively, whereas lower stage had a positive prognostic effect and location of tumor had no prognostic influence. Two patients with Stage C, who failed to received inguinal node radiotherapy, died of disease recurring in the inguinal area. Patients who received inguinal radiation (3 patients Stages B, C, and D1) had no regional recurrence. It is suggested that, for all female urethral carcinoma, bilateral ilioinguinal nodes be included in the radiation field. For radical treatment, iridium 192 insertion in combination with external beam treatment is recommended. 
2	Bile acids in human plasma interfere with cholecystokinin bioassay using dispersed pancreatic acini. A bioassay using dispersed pancreatic acini was used to measure fasting plasma cholecystokinin (CCK) concentrations in 105 patients with various kinds of gastrointestinal diseases, 17 patients with diabetes mellitus, and 6 healthy volunteers. High plasma CCK bioactivities were observed in patients with obstructive jaundice, choledocolithiasis, and primary biliary cirrhosis. Twenty-three samples with high CCK bioactivities were assayed by the same bioassay after the addition of a specific CCK antagonist and by a CCK radioimmunoassay in order to determine whether the high CCK-like bioactivity was due to circulating CCK or other factors. High CCK bioactivities were partially inhibited by the specific CCK antagonist, CR-1409, but the activities were not totally abolished. The residual bioactivities (not inhibited by CR-1409) correlated with plasma bile acid concentrations. The inhibitable CCK bioactivities correlated with plasma CCK levels obtained by radioimmunoassay. Although the bioassay using dispersed pancreatic acini has several advantages for measuring plasma CCK, this method overestimates CCK bioactivities in patients with high plasma bile acid concentrations. 
4	Arterial vasodilator effects of the dihydropyridine calcium antagonist amlodipine alone and in combination with verapamil in systemic hypertension. The arterial vasodilator properties of the dihydropyridine calcium antagonist amlodipine were compared with the effects of vascular muscle cyclic guanosine monophosphate production by sodium nitroprusside and with the effects of a combined infusion of amlodipine and the nondihydropyridine calcium antagonist verapamil in 8 untreated patients with primary hypertension. Arterial vasodilation was assessed by measurement of changes of forearm blood flow by mercury in Silastic strain-gauge plethysmography during brachial artery drug infusions. Forearm blood flow increased during amlodipine infusions (0.4 to 45 micrograms/min/100 ml forearm tissue) from 2.9 +/- 1.7 to a maximum of 23.6 +/- 7.6 ml/min/100 ml (687%), while sodium nitroprusside caused an increase from 3.0 +/- 1.8 to 16.2 +/- 5.4 ml/min/100 ml (449%), attesting to the importance of transmembrane calcium influx for the maintenance of vascular tone. The addition of verapamil 40 micrograms/min/100 ml to an infusion of amlodipine 44.5 micrograms/min/100 ml resulted in a further increase of forearm blood flow, from 23.6 +/- 7.6 to 34.4 +/- 9.8 ml/min/100 ml (p less than 0.05). The precise mechanisms of this finding have yet to be elucidated but may be due to interactions of the effects of the binding of these 2 chemically and pharmacologically different calcium antagonists to distinct binding sites at calcium channels. The clinical relevance of this observation for the treatment of coronary artery disease and systemic hypertension needs further study. 
5	Teflon versus thyroplasty versus nerve transfer: a comparison. Surgical rehabilitation of the paralyzed larynx is currently performed by Teflon injection, thyroplasty, and reinnervation techniques. Proponents of the two newer techniques maintain that they are preferred to Teflon injection because superior phonatory quality is achievable. This paper was written in an attempt to dissect the issues regarding this question. Teflon remains the quickest and least expensive procedure, but further experience with stroboscopic and other voice analyses reveals that the other procedures demonstrate some superiority in phonatory quality over Teflon. In this author's hands, the nerve transfer offers the best opportunity to achieve a normal phonatory voice. In addition, it is the only one of the three procedures that leaves the vocal cord entirely undisturbed--important in the event one of the other two procedures becomes necessary. 
5	Mapping of the locus for X-linked cardioskeletal myopathy with neutropenia and abnormal mitochondria (Barth syndrome) to Xq28. X-linked cardioskeletal myopathy with neutropenia and abnormal mitochondria is clinically characterized by congenital dilated cardiomyopathy, skeletal myopathy, recurrent bacterial infections, and growth retardation. We analyzed linkage between the disease locus and X-chromosomal markers in a family with seven carriers, four patients, and eight unaffected sons of carriers. Highest lod scores obtained by two-point linkage analysis were 2.70 for St14.1 (DXS52, TaqI) at a recombination fraction of zero and 2.53 for cpX67 (DXS134) at a recombination fraction of zero. Multipoint linkage analysis resulted in a maximum lod score of 5.24 at the position of St35.691 (DXS305). The most distal recombination detected in this family was located between the markers II-10 (DXS466) and DX13 (DXS15). These data indicate the location of the mutated gene at Xq28. 
1	Focal nodular hyperplasia of the liver. Twenty-four patients underwent biopsy or resection of the liver for focal nodular hyperplasia (FNH) at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center from 1978 to 1988. Twenty-two of the patients were women. The mean age was 35 years. A history of antecedent oral contraceptive or conjugated estrogen (Premarin) use was obtained in 18 of 21 women. There were two men, aged 26 and 37 years; neither gave a history of hormone use. Most of the tumors were solitary (22 of 24) and located in the left lobe of the liver (17 of 22). Fifteen of the patients had a prior or simultaneous malignant lesion and six had other benign tumors. Most of the tumors were resected with a wedge or subsegment of liver (13 of 24). Four patients underwent segmentectomy and five required lobectomy for removal of the tumors. Two patients had an intraoperative biopsy only. The patients in whom the tumor was diagnosed preoperatively underwent computed tomography and arteriography routinely. Scintigraphy of the liver with sulfur colloid was obtained in only three patients, despite its distinct potential for nonoperative diagnosis of FNH. 
5	Inactivation of human alpha-globin gene expression by a de novo deletion located upstream of the alpha-globin gene cluster. Synthesis of normal human hemoglobin A, alpha 2 beta 2, is based upon balanced expression of genes in the alpha-globin gene cluster on chromosome 16 and the beta-globin gene cluster on chromosome 11. Full levels of erythroid-specific activation of the beta-globin cluster depend on sequences located at a considerable distance 5' to the beta-globin gene, referred to as the locus-activating or dominant control region. The existence of an analogous element(s) upstream of the alpha-globin cluster has been suggested from observations on naturally occurring deletions and experimental studies. We have identified an individual with alpha-thalassemia in whom structurally normal alpha-globin genes have been inactivated in cis by a discrete de novo 35-kilobase deletion located approximately 30 kilobases 5' from the alpha-globin gene cluster. We conclude that this deletion inactivates expression of the alpha-globin genes by removing one or more of the previously identified upstream regulatory sequences that are critical to expression of the alpha-globin genes. 
4	Maternal and uteroplacental hemodynamic effects of chronic captopril in the hypertensive, term-pregnant rat. The chronic effects of captopril on maternal hemodynamics and organ perfusion were investigated in 10 untreated and 10 captopril-treated pregnant spontaneously hypertensive rats by means of the radioactive-labeled microsphere technique. The normal decrease in blood pressure during gestation was prevented by reduction of litter size to two conceptuses on day 7 of gestation. Captopril (approximately 10 mg/kg/day) or drug vehicle (50% ethyl alcohol) was administered intraperitoneally by an osmotic pump from day 7 to 21. At term mean arterial pressure was 23% lower in the captopril-treated group as the result of a 29% decrease in total peripheral resistance without a significant change in cardiac output. The decrease in total peripheral resistance was primarily caused by a decline in splanchnic and skin resistances. Maternal organ and uteroplacental perfusion were not significantly altered. We conclude that administration of captopril during the last 2 weeks of pregnancy in the hypertensive rat effectively lowers maternal blood pressure without adverse effects on organ and uteroplacental perfusion. 
4	Critical care transportation medicine: new concepts in pretransport stabilization of the critically ill patient. Regionalization of health care for trauma has become commonplace, and the same concept for critically ill medical/surgical patients is developing. Recent evidence suggests that current stabilization measures used by transport teams can be inadequate for this critically ill patient population. In trauma, speed has been considered a necessity to get the patient to a facility which cannot be carried out to the field, eg, an operating room. For acute medical illnesses, critical care transport teams can bring intensive care technology to the patient. Accumulating evidence supports the premise that speed of transport is not as important as stabilization before transport, knowledge of hemodynamics during transport, and early use of critical care monitoring systems. Other reports identify the need for initial evaluation and stabilization of critically ill patients by physicians at the critical care level of expertise. Accordingly, critical care transportation teams have evolved, creating new notions of pretransport stabilization not applicable to previous transport systems. 
4	Coronary artery pattern and outcome of arterial switch operation for transposition of the great arteries. A successful outcome of an arterial switch operation (ASO) for dextro-transposition of the great arteries (D-TGA) depends in large part on the transfer of the coronary arteries to the neoaorta without distortion or narrowing. However, the origins and distribution of the coronary arteries are quite variable in D-TGA; therefore, the entire experience with ASO at the Children's Hospital in Boston was reviewed. From 1983 through November 1989, 314 patients underwent surgery for D-TGA with the intent to perform an ASO. An ASO was actually performed in 290 patients, and 20 patients died, with 12 deaths (4.2%) clearly related to problems with the coronary arteries (CA deaths). The ASO was aborted to a Senning operation in 24 patients (7.6%), primarily due to coronary anatomy. Eight coronary patterns were identified and related to the outcome of the ASO. In 182 patients with the "usual" coronary pattern for D-TGA (i.e., anterior descending and circumflex arteries from the left sinus and right coronary artery from the right sinus), five CA deaths occurred, and two patients had Senning operations. Sixty-seven patients had right coronary and circumflex arteries from the right sinus and anterior descending arteries from the left sinus. Three CA deaths occurred, and one patient had a Senning operation. Single right coronary artery was found in 14; 12 had ASOs with three CA deaths (25%); and two had Senning operations. One late death was due to diffuse narrowing of the single right coronary artery. Single left coronary artery occurred in 11 patients, and seven had ASO with no early but one late "sudden" death, whereas four had Senning operations. 
5	Recurrent subacute torsion: prospective study of effects on testicular morphology and function. A prospective study was done on 43 consecutive patients with a diagnosis of recurrent subacute testicular torsion. All patients underwent full examination, hormonal assays and seminal fluid analysis before scrotal exploration, bilateral testicular biopsy and fixation. Seminal fluid analysis and hormonal assays were repeated 3 months postoperatively. Of the patients 36 were cured of recurrent pain, 35 of whom had a horizontally lying testis. No hormonal abnormalities were found preoperatively or postoperatively. Three patients had abnormal seminal fluid analysis. Testicular biopsies, including Johnsen scores, were abnormal in these 3 patients and normal in the other 33. It is concluded that patients with recurrent subacute torsion can be identified accurately and treated satisfactorily. There is little evidence that these patients suffer testicular damage as a result of this subacute torsion or that any pre-existing cellular abnormality exists to explain the oligospermia that frequently is seen in patients who have acute testicular torsion. 
5	Ichthyosis, exocrine pancreatic insufficiency, impaired neutrophil chemotaxis, growth retardation, and metaphyseal dysplasia (Shwachman syndrome). Report of a case with extensive skin lesions (clinical, histological, and ultrastructural findings). The Shwachman syndrome comprises exocrine pancreatic insufficiency, growth retardation, and bone marrow hypoplasia resulting in neutropenia. Clinical, morphological, and ultrastructural studies, as well as hair analysis, were performed in a patient with Shwachman's syndrome and severe ichthyosis. Clinical findings were lamellar ichthyosiform desquamation on the extremities. The hair was scanty and short on the scalp, in the eyelashes, and in the eyebrows. The nails were hyperkeratotic. Morphologic findings were slight, regular acanthosis and severe diffuse hyperkeratosis with variable parakeratosis. The granular layer was thickened. The papillary dermis showed very slight perivascular lymphocyte infiltration. The most prominent ultrastructural finding was the presence of solitary or multiple droplets of varying size in the cytoplasm of the keratinocytes. Hair analysis revealed no abnormalities; the cystine concentration in hair specimens was normal. 
5	Hypersensitivity reactions to epipodophyllotoxins in children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia. The incidence, clinical characteristics, and outcome of hypersensitivity reactions to teniposide (VM-26), etoposide (VP-16), or both were determined in 108 children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) treated with a contemporary regimen of intensive multiagent chemotherapy. Fifty (46%) of the 108 patients had one or more hypersensitivity reactions. The risk of any child having an initial reaction over the cumulative dose range studied was 52% (95% confidence limits, 41% and 63%) for VM-26, compared with 34% (95% confidence limits, 24% and 44%) for VP-16. The risk of having an initial reaction to VM-26 or VP-16 was clearly related to the cumulative dose. This risk peaked at 1500 to 2000 mg/m2 for VM-26 and at 2000-3000 mg/m2 for VP-16. All reactions were Type 1 reactions according to the Gell and Coombs classification, characterized by urticaria, angioedema, flushing, rashes, or hypotension, and 86% of reactions were of Grade 1 or 2 severity according to standard criteria. There was no evidence of increasing clinical severity on repeated rechallenge with premedication, and no deaths occurred. The findings suggested that hypersensitivity reactions to epipodophyllotoxins in children with ALL are more common than previously reported, but only rarely constitute dose-limiting toxicity. 
1	Ultrasonographic assessment of placental abnormalities. Current ultrasonographic techniques offer a novel approach for the identification of a wide variety of placental abnormalities usually described postnatally by the pathologist. Placental vascular lesions, placental tumors, and abnormal placentation are potentially associated with perinatal complications and their diagnosis in utero may influence the pregnancy management. An ultrasonographic classification of placental lesions that is based on their location, size, echogenicity, and number is proposed. Repeated ultrasonographic examination, together with biologic investigations, is important for the prenatal differential diagnosis of most these lesions and for full understanding of their pathophysiologic characteristics and significance. 
5	Morphological and histopathological aspects of aneurysms after patch aortoplasty for coarctation. Repair of coarctation of the aorta by synthetic patch grafting has been complicated by late aneurysm formation. These aneurysms differ macroscopically from atherosclerotic thoracic aortic dilatations. Specimens for microscopic examination were taken from 14 of 20 patients undergoing aneurysm resection. Histological analysis of the specimens showed medionecrosis in 13 patients of the specimens showed medionecrosis in 13 patients (93%), foreign body reaction in 11 patients (78%), and intimal thickening in 3 patients (21%). The three layers of the aortic wall could be identified in the aneurysms. On the basis of these results, we discuss the etiologic factors and pathogenetic mechanisms involved in the development of these aneurysms. 
2	The effect of long-acting somatostatin analogue on enzyme changes after endoscopic pancreatography. The effect of the long-acting somatostatin analogue, octreotide acetate (Sandostatin) on enzyme elevation after endoscopic pancreatography was studied in a prospective, randomized, double-blind trial. Sixty-three consecutive patients undergoing ERCP were randomly allocated to two group. In the control group, 34 patients received isotonic sodium-chloride, and in the treated group 29 patients received 0.1 mg of octreotide acetate subcutaneously before the pancreatography. After the endoscopy, amylase levels increased to pathological range in 15 of the controls and in 3 of the treated patients, whereas lipase levels showed a pathological rise in 17 of the controls and in 5 of the treated patients. A significant difference (p less than 0.01) was observed in the amylase and lipase changes between the two groups at 90 and 180 min after pancreatography. The enzyme levels showed at 90 min, mean +/- SD amylase: controls 540 +/- 185 units/liter, treated patients 261 +/- 108 units/liter; lipase: controls 304 +/- 98 units/liter, treated patients 198 +/- 88 units/liter. These findings suggest that the use of long-acting somatostatin analogue ameliorates the enzyme increases in the serum after endoscopic pancreatography. 
3	Dual task performance and processing resources in normal subjects and patients with Parkinson's disease. In recent years, there has been a growing consensus among investigators that the presence or absence of external cues guiding behaviour and attention is an important factor in determining whether or not deficits are found in patients with Parkinson's disease (PD). In an earlier study, the authors suggested that the pattern of impaired and intact performance could be explained in terms of differential resource demands of the tasks, combined with depleted levels of central processing resources in PD patients. Two experiments are reported, both employing dual-task paradigms. The first assessed, in normal subjects, the relative processing demands of a cued and an uncued version of the Stroop task. The results supported the proposal that the noncued task made greater demands on the subject's limited processing resources. Further, performing a resource demanding secondary task concurrently with the Stroop test produced, in normal subjects, the same pattern of impaired performance as that reported previously in PD patients. In the second experiment the same dual-task paradigm was employed with a group of PD patients and normal aged-matched controls. Only the patients showed an increase in reaction time on the Stroop task when performing a resource demanding secondary task. The patients also showed an interfering effect with concurrent foot tapping but not with an articulatory suppression task. The results were taken to support the hypothesis that PD patients have depleted central processing resources. In considering the present data, alternative explanations for the results are considered, in particular the possibility that they represent a deficit in switching processing resources between two tasks as the combined demands outweigh available resources. 
3	Treatment of fulminant hepatic failure with insulin and glucagon. A randomized, controlled trial. Insulin and glucagon are among the therapeutic modalities that have been investigated in the treatment of fulminant hepatic failure (FHF). We have completed a randomized, controlled trial of insulin and glucagon in 38 patients with FHF from either viral or toxin exposure. The control and treatment groups consisted of 21 and 17 patients, respectively, and did not differ significantly in etiology or admission laboratory values. Mortality was not significantly different between control and treatment groups and was 67% and 82%, respectively. Time from randomization to death or discharge was not significantly different between the two groups. Peak levels of alpha-fetoprotein were statistically higher in survivors than in nonsurvivors (P less than 0.01). We conclude that even though a type-2 error may exist, the combination of insulin and glucagon is not useful in the treatment of FHF. 
5	Manual stretch: effect on finger movement control and force control in stroke subjects with spastic extrinsic finger flexor muscles. This study evaluated the effects of manual stretch of extrinsic finger flexor muscles on finger extension movement control and force control in 16 spastic hemiparetic subjects. These subjects were randomly divided into a control group and an experimental group. A group of able-bodied subjects also participated. A joint-movement tracking test (JMTT) quantified control of active finger extension movement at the metacarpophalangeal joint of the index finger within the available range of active movement, and a force tracking test (FTT) quantified control of isometric finger extension force at the same joint within the subject's available force range. Electromyographic activity was monitored in the extensor digitorum and flexor digitorum superficialis muscles during both tracking tests. Manual stretch was applied to the extrinsic finger flexor muscles of the experimental group between the pretest and posttest tracking tests. The JMTT performances of both control (p less than .025) and experimental (p less than .05) groups were significantly subnormal on the pretest as were FTT performances of controls (p less than .01) and study subjects (p less than .03). The JMTT improvement on posttest was significantly greater (p less than .05) in subjects than in controls. However, the change in FTT performance was not significantly different between the two groups. Manual stretch treatment, properly applied to extrinsic finger flexor muscles, is an effective method of temporarily improving the control of finger extension movement in spastic hemiparetic subjects. 
1	Epidermoid tumors of the 4th ventricle: report of seven cases. Epidermoid tumors occur very rarely in the 4th ventricle. We discuss the history, clinical course, and the surgical results for seven patients. One patient had a remittal of symptoms, probably due to the emergence of the tumor from the 4th ventricle into the cisterna magna. Total removal of the capsule was possible only in the youngest patient. At present, four patients (mean follow-up, 6 years) enjoy good general and neurological health. 
3	Artificial urinary sphincter insertion in congenital neuropathic bladder. A series of 44 patients with neuropathic bladder dysfunction due to congenital myelodysplasia underwent implantation of an artificial urinary sphincter (AUS); in 26 patients a reconstructive procedure was performed at the same time. Five patients who initially had AUS implantation alone developed detrusor hyper-reflexia and required a clam cystoplasty. Forty patients (90%) are continent, 2 are occasionally damp and 2 are wet and awaiting further surgery; 66% of patients who underwent AUS insertion and reconstruction were found to have significant residual urine and they perform intermittent self-catheterisation (ISC). In patients with a good bladder capacity and normal compliance and detrusor hyper-reflexia controlled by anticholinergic drugs, cystoplasty is not necessary at the time of AUS insertion. 
3	Compressive neuropathy of spinal nerve roots. A mechanical or biological problem? Pathophysiologically, nerve root pain production is a complex issue. For many years, mechanical compression has been regarded as the sole cause for such pain. There are indications, however, that other factors, such as intraneural inflammation, may be of importance in this context. In this article, four cases are presented in which nerve root related pain gradually resolved without any proven change in the mechanical deformation of the involved nerve root. The data presented here suggest that mechanical compression, per se, may not always be the sole cause of radicular pain and dysfunction. These findings suggest that improvement is needed in our understanding of the pathophysiology of nerve root compression and inflammation. 
5	Effects of common illnesses on infants' energy intakes from breast milk and other foods during longitudinal community-based studies in Huascar (Lima), Peru. To assess the effects of common infections on dietary intake, 131 Peruvian infants were observed longitudinally. Home surveillance for illness symptoms was completed thrice weekly, and food and breast-milk consumption was measured during 1615 full-day observations. Mean (+/- SD) energy intakes on symptom-free days were 557 +/- 128 kcal/d (92.4 +/- 26.5 kcal.kg-1.d-1) for infants aged less than 181 d and 638 +/- 193 kcal/d (77.7 +/- 25.7 kcal.kg-1.d-1) for infants aged greater than 180 d. Statistical models controlling for infant age, season of the year, and individual showed significant 5-6% decreases in total energy intake during diarrhea or fever. There were no changes with illness in the frequency of breast-feeding, total suckling time, or amount of breast-milk energy consumed. By contrast, energy intake from non-breast-milk sources decreased by 20-30% during diarrhea and fever, and the small decrements in total energy consumption during illness were explained entirely by reduced consumption of non-breast-milk foods. 
4	A giant renal artery aneurysm diagnosed post partum. We report a case of a 5.8 cm. right renal artery aneurysm diagnosed intact 8 weeks post partum. Rupture of a renal arterial aneurysm during pregnancy is a rare but well described catastrophic event. There are no previous reports of an intact renal artery aneurysm diagnosed either ante partum or post partum. To our knowledge, this also represents the largest reported renal artery aneurysm. The aneurysm was repaired successfully with kidney salvage and closure of the fistulous connection to the renal vein. 
5	Respiratory input impedance in anesthetized paralyzed patients. Respiratory impedance (Zrs) was measured between 0.25 and 32 Hz in seven anesthetized and paralyzed patients by applying forced oscillation of low amplitude at the inlet of the endotracheal tube. Effective respiratory resistance (Rrs; in cmH2O.l-1.s) fell sharply from 6.2 +/- 2.1 (SD) at 0.25 Hz to 2.3 +/- 0.6 at 2 Hz. From then on, Rrs decreased slightly with frequency down to 1.5 +/- 0.5 at 32 Hz. Respiratory reactance (Xrs; in cmH2O.l-1.s) was -22.2 +/- 5.9 at 0.25 Hz and reached zero at approximately 14 Hz and 2.3 +/- 0.8 at 32 Hz. Effective respiratory elastance (Ers = -2pi x frequency x Xrs; in cmH2O/1) was 34.8 +/- 9.2 at 0.25 Hz and increased markedly with frequency up to 44.2 +/- 8.6 at 2 Hz. We interpreted Zrs data in terms of a T network mechanical model. We represented the proximal branch by central airway resistance and inertance. The shunt pathway accounted for bronchial distensibility and alveolar gas compressibility. The distal branch included a Newtonian resistance component for tissues and peripheral airways and a viscoelastic component for tissues. When the viscoelastic component was represented by a Kelvin body as in the model of Bates et al. (J. Appl. Physiol. 61: 873-880, 1986), a good fit was obtained over the entire frequency range, and reasonable values of parameters were estimated. The strong frequency dependence of Rrs and Ers observed below 2 Hz in our anesthetized paralyzed patients could be mainly interpreted in terms of tissue viscoelasticity. Nevertheless, the high Ers we found with low volume excursions suggests that tissues also exhibit plasticlike properties. 
5	West syndrome associated with hyperlexia. Two patients are reported with West syndrome associated with hyperlexia. They had peculiar linguistic and psychosocial development and autistic behavior, yet began to read Japanese and Chinese characters, numbers, Roman alphabet letters, and trademark letters at 3 years of age. Neuropsychologic, electroencephalographic, and radiologic studies were performed at 11 years of age in Patient 1 and at 10 years of age in Patient 2. Although they were able to read fluently with correct intonation, their comprehension was significantly impaired. The neuropsychologic evaluation of both patients demonstrated selective, excellent ability in auditory memory in contrast to impairment of associational abilities, visual retention, and visual constructional abilities. These findings suggest that the functions in the nondominant hemisphere were also impaired. Although children with West syndrome frequently have associated mental retardation, patients with West syndrome associated with hyperlexia have never been reported. A neuropsychologic investigation of epileptic children with mental retardation is necessary for the detection of hyperlexia. 
4	IgD immune complex vasculitis in a patient with hyperimmunoglobulinemia D and periodic fever. We describe a 27-year-old Dutch woman with the hyperimmunoglobulinemia D and periodic fever syndrome. During febrile attacks she occasionally presented with skin lesions on the distal parts of her upper and lower extremities, with the histologic picture of a leukocytoclastic vasculitis. Clear perivascular deposits of IgD and C3 were presented in early lesional skin on immunofluorescence investigation. Circulating IgD immune complexes were demonstrated on several occasions, both during and in between clinical attacks. These findings are consistent with an IgD immune complex-mediated pathogenesis for the skin lesions. In 10 patients with other forms of immune complex vasculitis of the skin, minimal perivascular deposits of IgD were found in four cases. In these cases, however, IgD was never found as the solitary immunoglobulin class. 
4	Course of diabetic retinopathy following cataract surgery Five patients with mild to moderate retinopathy to both eyes underwent complication-free cataract surgery in one eye. Within three months of surgery deterioration of the retinopathy was observed in the operated eye only. In four patients there was an increase of intraretinal haemorrhages and hard exudates, accompanied by clinically significant macular oedema manifested as retinal thickening and extensive fluorescein leakage from both the macular and the peripapillary capillary networks. Of these four patients one also developed retinal ischaemia, evident ophthalmoscopically by flame-shaped haemorrhages and cotton-wool spots and angiographically by areas of capillary non-perfusion. The fifth patient showed proliferation of new blood vessels and vitreous haemorrhage. Diabetic patients scheduled for cataract surgery should undergo a thorough preoperative evaluation of any existing retinopathy. Postoperatively they should be followed up at close intervals so that any progression of retinopathy can be promptly detected and considered for laser treatment. 
5	Dexamethasone increases plasma levels of albendazole. Therapy of neurocysticercosis with cysticidal drugs is frequently complicated by the exacerbation of symptoms that follows the inflammation triggered by the acute destruction of cysticerci. Treatment of such adverse reactions with dexamethasone is highly effective. However, it has been shown that dexamethasone lowers the plasma levels of praziquantel, thus reducing its cysticidal efficacy. We measured plasma levels of albendazole, another strong cysticidal drug, when dexamethasone was given simultaneously. We found that dexamethasone increased the plasma levels of albendazole by about 50% (P less than 0.002); hence, it seems that cysticercosis and the ensuing inflammation can be treated simultaneously with albendazole and dexamethasone without diminishing the efficacy of the cysticidal drug. 
1	Sensitivity of urinary quantitative immunocytology with monoclonal antibody 486 P3/12 in 241 unselected patients with bladder carcinoma. We investigated the sensitivity of quantitative immunocytology with our monoclonal antibody 486 P3/12 in 241 unselected patients with transitional cell carcinoma. Immunocytology yielded a sensitivity of 91.8%, 89.4% and 92.9% for grade 1, 2 and 3 tumors, respectively. Standard cytology was positive in 59.2%, 63.8% and 84.7%, respectively. Deoxyribonucleic acid flow cytometry, used in the first 69 patients, was positive in only 27.7%, 48.6% and 57.1%, respectively. 
1	Cutaneous malignant melanoma in Rochester, Minnesota: trends in incidence and survivorship, 1950 through 1985 In Rochester, Minnesota, 107 incidence cases of cutaneous malignant melanoma (in 46 male and 61 female patients) were diagnosed during the years 1950 through 1985. Overall crude incidence rates were 6.0 and 6.6 per 100,000 males and females, respectively. Evaluation of trends in 9-year periods showed that the rates increased from 3.2 to 8.9 for males (P = 0.015) and from 4.4 to 11.7 for females (P less than 0.001). Age-specific rates suggested that the highest incidence occurs in the age-groups 50 to 59 years and 70 years or older for males and 40 to 49 years and 70 years or older for females. Lesions were most common in the head and neck area among males (P = 0.044) and on the lower extremities among females (P = 0.018). The most frequent histologic type was superficial spreading melanoma (61%). Five-year survival was diminished overall for patients with cutaneous malignant melanoma--0.72 in comparison with 0.88 expected for the general population. Statistically significant risk factors for survival were depth of invasion of the lesion (Clark level), thickness of the lesion, histologic type, and age of the patient. 
2	A clinicopathologic study of the eyes in familial adenomatous polyposis with extracolonic manifestations (Gardner's syndrome). The eyes of a 51-year-old woman with familial adenomatous polyposis and extracolonic manifestations (Gardner's syndrome) were obtained postmortem and studied by light microscopy and by transmission and scanning electron microscopy. We found a generalized abnormality in melanogenesis of the retinal pigment epithelium and at least three types of pigmented lesions. The histologic findings in one type of lesion were consistent with congenital hypertrophy of the retinal pigment epithelium or benign pigmented nevus of the retinal pigment epithelium. The other two types of lesion were most consistent with hamartomatous malformations of the retinal pigment epithelium featuring cellular hypertrophy, hyperplasia, and rarely retinal invasion and formation of a minute mushroom-shaped tumor. These histopathologic findings indicate a generalized effect of the familial adenomatous polyposis gene on the retinal pigment epithelium. This oncogene, which is responsible for tumor formation in the gastrointestinal tract, soft tissues, bone, and other locations in patients with familial adenomatous polyposis, also leads to a generalized defect in melanogenesis and focal lesions of the retinal pigment epithelium. 
4	Leukocyte counts and activation in spontaneously hypertensive and normotensive rats The etiology for the progressive organ injury in hypertension is largely speculative. Recent studies have shown that leukocytes play a key role in several cardiovascular diseases. As an initial step toward investigating the role of leukocytes in hypertension, we measured leukocyte counts and spontaneous activation of granulocytes of freshly drawn unseparated blood samples in spontaneously hypertensive rats and in their normotensive counterpart, Wistar-Kyoto rats. The animals were derived from one breeder in the United States and from two breeders in Europe. Total leukocyte counts in young, mature, and old hypertensive rats were 50-100% above the controls. The number of granulocytes in mature and old spontaneously hypertensive rats in more than 100% elevated compared with control rats. In young hypertensive rats the mean granulocyte count was only slightly elevated. The number of spontaneously activated granulocytes, as detected by the nitroblue tetrazolium reduction, increases with age in both species; in mature spontaneously hypertensive rats, it is more than 300% above the values in the controls. Furthermore, in mature hypertensive rats the number of monocytes, activated monocytes, and the lymphocyte count are also significantly elevated over the values in the normotensive controls. It is proposed that these elevated leukocyte counts may constitute an enhanced risk for organ injury in the spontaneously hypertensive rat. 
3	Parathyroid hormone-related peptide in lactation and in umbilical cord blood. Parathyroid hormone-related peptide (PTHrP) is expressed in lactating rat mammary glands after suckling, as a result of increases in prolactin rather than suckling per se. In addition, PTHrP produced in the fetal parathyroid glands and placenta may be responsible for stimulation of placental calcium transport. In the current study, we used a radioimmunoassay for human PTHrP to measure levels of the peptide in (1) human breast milk, cow's milk, and two infant formulas; (2) sequential plasma samples in prepartum and postpartum lactating women; (3) women with pathologic hyperprolactinemia; and (4) human umbilical cord blood. In normal subjects, plasma PTHrP levels ranged from less than 2 to 5 pmol/liter. In contrast, human breast milk contained substantially increased levels of immunoreactive PTHrP. Similar elevations were found in cow's milk and in one infant formula. Column chromatography of breast milk demonstrated that PTHrP immunoreactivity included a region of adenylate cyclase stimulating activity, consistent with the presence of biologically active PTHrP. Plasma prepartum PTHrP values did not differ from corresponding postpartum values in lactating women. Women with hyperprolactinemia had a mean plasma PTHrP value in the high-normal range. Umbilical cord blood had considerably suppressed parathyroid hormone values but PTHrP levels that were indistinguishable from those in normal human plasma. Thus, PTHrP is present in high concentrations in breast milk but apparently does not gain access to the maternal circulation in significant amounts. In addition, women with pathologic hyperprolactinemia seem not to have increased levels of circulating PTHrP. 
5	Continent ileocolonic urinary reservoirs for filling and lining the post-exenteration pelvis. Pelvic exenteration has a high complication rate due, in large part, to the extensive raw surfaces and dead space it creates. Numerous techniques have been used to control this space and line these surfaces, but none, to date, has proven to be a reliable solution. We investigated the use of continent ileocolonic urinary reservoirs as a new "flap" to fill and line the pelvis in 17 patients, and found that our historical complication rate of 44% for pelvic exenteration was reduced to 18%. These reservoirs appear to be an improved method of managing the post-exenteration pelvis. 
5	Intrapericardial infusion of 5-fluorouracil. An unusual complication of a Hickman catheter. Venous access devices (VAD) have become an important tool in the management of patients with cancer. Multiple complications can occur as a consequence of insertion of a VAD. The authors report a case of a Hickman catheter perforating the wall of the superior vena cava into the pericardium, resulting in accidental intrapericardial infusion of 5-fluorouracil (5-FU). Pericarditis and cardiac arrhythmias developed, but the patient did not have cardiac tamponade. She recovered from the event without apparent chronic cardiac dysfunction. 
5	Long-term cardiopulmonary bypass by peripheral cannulation in a model of total heart failure. The decompression of the left heart through a percutaneous helical spring positioned within the lumen of the tricuspid and pulmonary artery valves. We performed long-term closed-chest cardiopulmonary bypass in an animal model of total heart failure (induced ventricular fibrillation). The extracorporeal system included a venous reservoir, a roller pump, a membrane lung, and a blood pulsator system. We cannulated the right external jugular vein for venous drainage and the right subclavian artery for arterial return. To decompress the left heart we passed by percutaneous cannulation a special helical spring mounted on a Swan-Ganz catheter (Baxter Edwards Divisions, Irvine, Calif.) and positioned it to rest within the pulmonary artery and tricuspid valves, which rendered them partly incompetent. After induced ventricular fibrillation, blood flow was raised to keep the central venous pressure at baseline values. The lungs were ventilated with 5% carbon dioxide in room air. During bypass, mean pulmonary artery pressure was 10.0 +/- 1.7 mm Hg, mean wedge pressure 11.9 +/- 1.8 mm Hg, and mean blood pressure 95.2 +/- 5.6 mm Hg. After 2 days (four animals) and 3 days (two animals) the hearts were defibrillated. There was immediate ejection from both sides of the heart. All sheep were weaned from bypass within 29 +/- 11 minutes and their lungs were ventilated with room air within 42 +/- 34 minutes. At autopsy hearts and lungs grossly appeared normal. We conclude that the percutaneous helical spring resting within right heart valves provided excellent decompression throughout the study, with full recovery of heart and lung function on defibrillation. 
2	Improved water and sodium absorption from oral rehydration solutions based on rice syrup in a rat model of osmotic diarrhea. Rice syrup solids, rice protein, and casein hydrolysate were added to experimental oral rehydration solutions in various combinations and tested in a rat intestinal perfusion system. Chronic osmotic diarrhea was induced in juvenile rats by supplying the cathartic agents, magnesium citrate and phenolphthalein, in their drinking water for 1 week. The experimental oral rehydration solutions were compared with standard oral rehydration solutions containing 20 gm/L or 30 gm/L of glucose and with each other to determine if there were significant differences in net water, sodium, or potassium absorption. An oral rehydration solution containing 30 gm/L of rice syrup solids had a net water absorption rate significantly higher than that of the standard 20 gm/L glucose-based oral rehydration solution (2.1 +/- 0.62 versus 1.5 +/- 0.48 microliters/[min x cm], p less than 0.05). Casein hydrolysate did not significantly affect net water absorption. However, combinations of 30 gm/L rice syrup solids and 5 gm/L casein hydrolysate significantly increased (p less than 0.05) net sodium and potassium absorption compared with the 20 gm/L glucose-based oral rehydration solution but not versus rice syrup solids alone. Oral rehydration solutions containing 30 gm/L rice syrup solids plus 5 gm/L rice protein, and 30 gm/L rice syrup solids plus 5 gm/L casein hydrolysate, had net water absorption rates significantly higher than the rate of a 30 gm/L glucose-based oral rehydration solution (2.5 +/- 0.36 and 2.4 +/- 0.38, respectively, versus 0.87 +/- 0.40 microliters/[min x cm], p less than 0.05). Rice protein and casein hydrolysate, however, did not significantly affect net water, sodium, or potassium absorption when added to rice protein glucose-based oral rehydration solutions. An inverse correlation between osmolality and net water absorption was observed (r = -0.653, p less than 0.02). The data suggest that substitution of rice syrup solids for glucose in oral rehydration solutions will improve water absorption and that rice syrup solids in combination with protein hydrolysates may, in addition, promote better sodium and potassium uptake.
