5	Adenocarcinoma of the appendiceal stump. We have reported the case of a 58-year-old woman with nonspecific abdominal complaints in whom barium enema and subsequent colonoscopy showed a 3 cm lobulated adenocarcinoma within a villous adenoma arising from the appendiceal stump. Because such appendiceal malignancies have no specific clinical signs, symptoms, or radiologic features, preoperative diagnosis is extremely difficult, and colonoscopy may be required to clarify radiologically demonstrated irregularities. 
4	Trolox protects rat hepatocytes against oxyradical damage and the ischemic rat liver from reperfusion injury. Trolox, a hydrophilic analog of vitamin E, was reported to scavenge peroxyl radicals from artificial systems better than its parent compound. Here we examined the possible cytoprotective effect of Trolox in cultured hepatocytes and in the rat liver. In cultured rat hepatocytes, 0.5 to 16 mmol/L Trolox (with optimum between 1 to 2 mmol/L) was observed to prolong the survival of cells exposed to oxyradicals generated with xanthine oxidase-hypoxanthine. The protection by 1 mmol/L Trolox surpassed that provided by either ascorbate, mannitol, superoxide dismutase and/or catalase--each at a level giving its maximal protection in the same system. In both a global and partial model of hepatic ischemia-reperfusion in rats, infusion of Trolox (7.5 to 10 mumol/kg body weight) just before reflow reduced by greater than 80% the liver necrosis sustained in untreated (no Trolox) control rats. Such organ salvage was apparently accompanied by approximately 50% reduction in the amount of hepatic conjugated dienes, which were quantified by a highly specific radiochemical assay. Since conjugated dienes are presumed to be good "markers" of oxyradical damage, our data may have provided a semiquantitative link between free radical-induced necrosis and its chemical imprint in vivo. The data also indicated a relatively rapid and potent antioxidant-like action by Trolox on rat hepatocytes and on the postischemic reperfused rat liver. 
3	Cyclosporin-associated akinetic mutism and extrapyramidal syndrome after liver transplantation. Three patients developed akinetic mutism on the third day after the introduction of intravenous cyclosporin A, given for immunosuppression after liver transplantation. One patient in addition developed a florid orofacial dyskinesia, which resolved completely, as did the akinetic mutism, after withdrawal of cyclosporin. In these patients the time course of the akinetic mutism and extrapyramidal syndrome, which developed in the absence of any other identifiable cause, suggests cyclosporin A was the precipitating factor. Subsequently, two of the patients showed signs of pseudobulbar palsy with abnormalities in the pons on MRI scanning, suggesting central pontine myelinolysis (CPM). None of the patients had experienced significant fluctuations in serum sodium or other risk factors for central pontine myelinolysis and the exact relationship to the earlier cyclosporin related mutism was not clear. 
1	Radioimmunoguided surgery using iodine 125 B72.3 in patients with colorectal cancer. Preliminary data using B72.3 murine monoclonal antibody labeled with iodine 125 suggested that both clinically apparent as well as occult sites of colorectal cancer could be identified intraoperatively using a hand-held gamma detecting probe. We report the preliminary data of a multicenter trial of this approach in patients with primary or recurrent colorectal cancer. One hundred four patients with primary, suspected, or known recurrent colorectal cancer received an intravenous infusion of 1 mg of B72.3 monoclonal antibody radiolabeled with 7.4 x 10 Bq of iodine 125. Twenty-six patients with primary colorectal cancer and 72 patients with recurrent colorectal cancer were examined. Using the gamma detecting probe, 78% of the patients had localization of the antibody in their tumor; this included 75% of primary tumor sites and 63% of all recurrent tumor sites; 9.2% of all tumor sites identified represented occult sites detected only with the gamma detecting probe. The overall sensitivity was 77% and a predictive value of a positive detection was 78%. A total of 30 occult sites in 26 patients were identified. In patients with recurrent cancer, the antibody study provided unique data that precluded resection in 10 patients, and in another eight patients it extended the potentially curative procedure. 
5	Retroviral expression of transforming growth factor-alpha does not transform fibroblasts or keratinocytes. Transforming growth factor alpha (TGF alpha) is a peptide so named because it helps to impart anchorage-independent growth to normal rat kidney (NRK) cells in vitro and is secreted by many rodent and human tumor cells. To directly investigate the transforming properties of this factor, we constructed a replication-defective murine retrovirus that expresses the human sequence coding for TGF alpha. Infection of NIH/3T3 cells with the TGF alpha retrovirus led to the integration of a transcriptionally active provirus and overexpression of biologically active TGF alpha, but failed to induce morphologic transformation. Similarly, the TGF alpha retrovirus failed to induce morphologic transformation of five other types of rodent fibroblasts. We also investigated the effect of TGF alpha expression on the growth of BALB/MK mouse keratinocytes, which require epidermal growth factor (EGF) for proliferation. We show that exogenously added TGF alpha is an extremely potent mitogen for BALB/MK cells. However, retroviral expression of TGF alpha in BALB/MK cells failed to relieve dependence on exogenously added EGF (or TGF alpha) for cell growth. These results suggest that overexpression of TGF alpha does not, by itself, transform rodent fibroblasts or keratinocytes. 
5	The abdominal trauma index--a critical reassessment and validation. The Abdominal Trauma Index (ATI) was devised to quantify the risk of complications following abdominal trauma. With scores greater than 25, the risk of postoperative complications became exponential. The purpose of the present study was to determine if: 1) the organ risk factors previously assigned were more statistically valid; and 2) the addition of physiologic variables would enhance the prediction of postinjury intra-abdominal sepsis. Fifteen abdominal organ systems and 17 physiologic variables in 300 consecutive patients were analyzed to determine ability to predict intraabdominal sepsis. There were no significant differences in predictive ability between the old and new organ risk factors. The addition of physiologic factors did not enhance the prediction of intra-abdominal sepsis. This clinical study demonstrates that: 1) the risk of intra-abdominal sepsis increases with increasing ATI score; 2) the previous (1979-initial) organ risk grading concept is statistically valid; 3) six of the 15 organ systems warrant a change in their relative rank order (1989-revision); 4) the addition of demographic, physiologic, and immunologic variables did not significantly improve the prediction of intra-abdominal sepsis. 
4	Are blood pressure levels increasing in Denmark? The Copenhagen City Heart Study is a prospective cardiovascular population study designed to evaluate the incidence of and risk factors for cardiovascular disease. A random population sample comprising approximately 20,000 individuals was invited to participate. Blood pressure was measured, and information regarding the use of antihypertensive medication was collected in an initial survey during the period 1976-1978 (attendance rate 74%) and from a second survey during the period 1981-1983 (attendance rate 70%). A significant increase in systolic and diastolic blood pressure between survey 1 and survey 2 was found among both men and women greater than 40 years of age and not using antihypertensive medication. The increase in blood pressure in the follow-up survey could not be explained by changes in methods, changes in the prescription of antihypertensive medication, or selection bias. Factors associated with changes in systolic and diastolic blood pressure were examined by multiple linear regression analysis. Both increase in body mass index and increase in alcohol consumption were positively correlated with changes in systolic and diastolic blood pressure, while use of antihypertensive medication, a high value of body mass index at survey 1 and a high level of education were negatively correlated with changes in systolic and diastolic blood pressure. Female sex and advanced age were also negatively correlated with changes in diastolic blood pressure. Consumption of tobacco and alcohol, income and changes in consumption of tobacco were not significantly correlated with changes in systolic and diastolic blood pressure. 
1	Multiple primary malignancies in patients with malignant tumours of the nasal cavities and paranasal sinuses. The incidence of multiple primary malignancies (MPM) was analysed in 1297 patients with malignant tumours of the nasal cavities and paranasal sinuses. The patients were followed for a minimum of six years or until death. The incidence of MPM was 3.4 per cent (44/1297) which is lower in patients with malignant tumours of other regions in the upper aerodigestive tract. Five of the 44 patients had second malignancies within previously irradiated areas. There was a difference between the proportion of histologies occurring in irradiated tissues compared with the overall 1297 patients. This finding suggests that radiotherapy may induce a second cancer. 
5	Acute cholangitis. Cholangitis is an infection of the biliary ductal system that results from the combination of bactibilia and biliary obstruction. Choledocholithiasis has been the leading cause of cholangitis. However, in recent years, especially at tertiary referral centers, nonoperative biliary manipulations, often in patients with unresectable malignancies, have become the most common cause of cholangitis. As a result, the complete triad of fever and chills, jaundice, and abdominal pain, as originally described by Charcot, is now seen less frequently. Most patients still have leukocytosis and abnormal liver function tests, but many patients with indwelling tubes may develop cholangitis without significant jaundice. E. coli, Klebsiella species, and the enterococci remain the most frequently isolated organisms, and anaerobes including Bacteroides fragilis are recovered in 15% to 30% of patients. However, Enterobacter and Pseudomonas species, as well as yeasts, are now being isolated more frequently from patients with indwelling tubes, who often have been treated previously with antibiotics. Computed cholangiography usually is necessary to determine the cause and site of biliary obstruction. In the majority of patients with cholangitis, cholangiography can be delayed until the patient has been afebrile for a minimum of 24 to 48 hours. Initial therapy includes bowel rest, intravenous fluids, and antibiotics. Many antibiotic regimens are now available to cover the gram-negative aerobes, the enterococcus, and the anaerobes that are likely to be causing the biliary infection. The combination of a penicillin and an aminoglycoside has been the gold standard. However, recent studies suggest that the newer broad-spectrum penicillins provide adequate therapy for these patients. Only a small percentage (5%-10%) of patients with toxic cholangitis require emergency biliary decompression. The choice of percutaneous or endoscopic drainage should be made on the basis of the presumed site and cause of obstruction as well as local expertise. The nature of the biliary obstruction may be the most important determinant of outcome. At present, patients with end-stage malignant obstruction account for most of the deaths, whereas approximately 95% of patients survive an episode of cholangitis. 
3	Suggestive evidence that pelvic endometriosis is a progressive disease, whereas deeply infiltrating endometriosis is associated with pelvic pain. In a 3-year prospective study of 643 consecutive laparoscopies for infertility, pelvic pain, or infertility and pain, the pelvic area, the depth of infiltration, and the volume of endometriotic lesions were evaluated. The incidence, area, and volume of subtle lesions decreased with age, whereas for typical lesions these parameters and the depth of infiltration increased with age. Deeply infiltrating endometriosis was strongly associated with pelvic pain, women with pain having larger and deeper lesions. Because deep endometriosis has little emphasis in the revised American Fertility Society classification and after analyzing the diagnoses made in each class, considerations for a simplifying revision with inclusion of deep lesions are suggested. In conclusion, suggestive evidence is presented to support the concept that endometriosis is a progressive disorder, and it is demonstrated that deep endometriosis is strongly associated with pelvic pain. 
1	Resolution of inferior vena cava syndrome after embolization of a hepatic adenoma. A 77-year-old man presented with severe pruritus and massive lower body edema. Computerized axial tomography of the abdomen showed a large hepatic mass compressing the inferior vena cava, and a liver biopsy specimen showed hepatic adenoma. Embolization of vessels feeding the hepatic tumor resulted in complete resolution of pruritus and ascites, and clinical remission has persisted for 1 year following partial obliteration of tumor vasculature. Angiographic ablation of tumor blood supply represents a nonoperative means for inducing clinical remission in patients with symptomatic hepatic adenoma who are at high surgical risk. 
3	Further notes on Munchausen's syndrome: a case report of a change from acute abdominal to neurological type. A rare case of Munchausen's syndrome beginning in early childhood is described. The diagnosis of Munchausen's syndrome was made at the age of 29 years, after the symptoms had changed from acute abdominal to neurological complaints, with feigned loss of consciousness, first ascribed to an encephalitis. Insight into the psychopathology of this patient is given by his biography, by assessment of a psychotherapist, who had treated him some years before, and by his observed profile in some psychological tests. 
1	Small bowel obstruction associated with a leiomyomatous uterus. A case report and review of the literature. A 38-year-old woman developed small bowel obstruction shortly after a cholecystectomy because of a massively enlarged leiomyomatous uterus. Small bowel obstruction is a relatively rare complication from fibroid tumors and results from entrapment of the bowel between serosal pedunculated fibroids (as in this patient), adhesions to infarcted leiomyomas, or from compression of the small bowel by the large mass. Large uterine leiomyomas clearly must be considered in the etiology of intestinal obstruction. 
1	Coexistence of testicular carcinoma and hairy cell leukemia. The coexistence of two relatively rare disorders in 1 patient often induces speculation about possible cause and effect of these disorders. The suitable therapeutic regimen for both diseases and roentgenologic manifestations are described. 
1	Is the treatment of metastatic carcinoid tumor with interferon not as successful as suggested? Eight patients with metastatic carcinoid tumor, seven of whom had symptoms of the carcinoid syndrome, were treated with either human leukocyte interferon (seven patients) or recombinant alpha-interferon (IFN alpha-2b) (one patient) at doses of 4.5 to 21 x 10(6) IU weekly for 1 to 21 (mean, 8.5) months. Tumor regression on computed tomography (CT) scan was found in one patient, the CT findings remained unchanged in three, and the tumor progressed in four patients. A clearcut and continuing decrease in urinary levels of 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid (5-HIAA) was observed in one patient and a transient one in four patients. The symptoms improved in only two of seven patients. Four patients had leukopenia develop, which was circumvented by reducing the dose. The authors conclude that interferon therapy of the carcinoid tumor is not as successful as has been suggested in previous reports. 
5	Magnitude and time course of extracellular potassium inhomogeneities during acute ischemia in pigs. Effect of verapamil. Prior studies have demonstrated the presence of inhomogeneities in myocardial [K+]e after serial 10-minute occlusions of the left anterior descending coronary artery in the pig, even within restricted locations of an ischemic zone. These inhomogeneities are thought to underlie the electrophysiological abnormalities responsible for lethal ventricular arrhythmias through reentrant and nonreentrant pathways, but a clear association has not been demonstrated. As a prerequisite to establishing this association, these studies were performed to establish measurement standards for [K+]e inhomogeneity, to quantify the magnitude and time course of these inhomogeneities, to determine whether the inhomogeneities are greater in the ischemic border where lethal ventricular arrhythmias are known to originate, and to assess the effect of a known antifibrillatory drug on [K+]e inhomogeneities. [K+]e (expressed as the change in potassium equilibrium potential, dEK [mV]) was measured in 15 preparations using an average of 17 closely spaced, critically calibrated K(+)-sensitive electrodes having stable response characteristics. A series of four 10-minute occlusions each separated by a 50-minute reperfusion period were performed in each study. In half of the studies, intravenous verapamil (0.2 mg/kg bolus followed by 0.0065 mg/kg/hr) was administered before the fourth occlusion. In nine studies (five control and four verapamil), electrodes were placed in the marginal ischemic zone (from 2 mm outside to 5 mm inside the visible cyanotic border). In six other studies (three control and three verapamil), electrodes were placed in the central ischemic zone (10-20 mm within the ischemic region). We determined that the standard deviation is the best measure of inhomogeneity and that 12 equivalent measurement sites are required to estimate it with a satisfactory degree of statistical confidence. We found that after 10 minutes of ischemia, mean dEK was 1.6 times greater in the central than in the marginal ischemic zone, whereas mean standard deviation at the same time was 1.5 times greater in the marginal than in the central ischemic zone. Verapamil reduced mean dEK and mean standard deviation in both ischemic zones for most of the occlusion by delaying the rise in [K+]e and the inhomogeneity of that rise by 3-5 minutes. Comparisons of mean dEK with mean standard deviation revealed a steep linear relation in the marginal zone and a curvilinear relation in the central zone where higher mean dEK values were not accompanied by higher values for mean standard deviation. Furthermore, we determined that these relations were not altered by verapamil.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS). 
5	Norfloxacin prevents spontaneous bacterial peritonitis recurrence in cirrhosis: results of a double-blind, placebo-controlled trial. Eighty cirrhotic patients who had recovered from an episode of spontaneous bacterial peritonitis were included in a multicenter, double-blind trial aimed at comparing long-term norfloxacin administration (400 mg/day; 40 patients) vs. placebo (40 patients) in the prevention of spontaneous bacterial peritonitis recurrence. At entry, both groups were similar with respect to clinical and laboratory data, ascitic fluid protein and polymorphonuclear concentrations, number of previous episodes of spontaneous bacterial peritonitis and causative organisms of the index spontaneous bacterial peritonitis. Norfloxacin administration produced a selective intestinal decontamination (elimination of aerobic gram-negative bacilli from the fecal flora without significant changes in other microorganisms) throughout the study in six patients in whom the effect of norfloxacin on the fecal flora was periodically assessed. Fourteen patients from the placebo group (35%) and five from the norfloxacin group (12%) developed spontaneous bacterial peritonitis recurrence during follow-up (chi 2 = 5.97; p = 0.014) (mean follow-up period = 6.4 +/- 0.6 mo; range = 1 to 19 mo). Ten of the 14 spontaneous bacterial peritonitis recurrences in the placebo group and only one of the five spontaneous bacterial peritonitis recurrences in the norfloxacin group were caused by aerobic gram-negative bacilli (chi 2 = 8.87; p = 0.0029). The overall probability of spontaneous bacterial peritonitis recurrence at 1 yr of follow-up was 20% in the norfloxacin group and 68% in the placebo group (p = 0.0063) and the probability of spontaneous bacterial peritonitis recurrence caused by aerobic gram-negative bacilli at 1 yr of follow-up was 3% and 60%, respectively (p = 0.0013). 
3	Schindler disease: the molecular lesion in the alpha-N-acetylgalactosaminidase gene that causes an infantile neuroaxonal dystrophy. Schindler disease is a recently recognized infantile neuroaxonal dystrophy resulting from the deficient activity of the lysosomal hydrolase, alpha-N-acetylgalctosaminidase (alpha-GalNAc). The recent isolation and expression of the full-length cDNA encoding alpha-GalNAc facilitated the identification of the molecular lesions in the affected brothers from family D, the first cases described with this autosomal recessive disease. Southern and Northern hybridization analyses of DNA and RNA from the affected homozygotes revealed a grossly normal alpha-GalNAc gene structure and normal transcript sizes and amounts. Therefore, the alpha-GalNAc transcript from an affected homozygote was reverse-transcribed, amplified by the polymerase chain reaction (PCR), and sequenced. A single G to A transition at nucleotide 973 was detected in multiple subclones containing the PCR products. This point mutation resulted in a glutamic acid to lysine substitution in residue 325 (E325K) of the alpha-GalNAc polypeptide. The base substitution was confirmed by dot blot hybridization analyses of PCR-amplified genomic DNA from family members with allele-specific oligonucleotides. Furthermore, transient expression of an alpha-GalNAc construct containing the E325K mutation resulted in the expression of an immunoreactive polypeptide which had no detectable alpha-GalNAc activity. 
2	Xipamide disposition in liver cirrhosis. The pharmacokinetics of the sulfonamide-type diuretic xipamide was studied in patients with liver cirrhosis and ascites and compared with healthy control subjects. After oral administration of 40 mg xipamide, the diuretic was rapidly distributed in the blood and the ascites. The ratio of the area under the concentration-time curve (AUC) of plasma and ascitic fluid was 7:2, as was the protein content in the respective compartments. The AUC in plasma of cirrhotic patients was significantly greater than in control subjects (p less than 0.001). The most striking finding was the increase of the amount (Ae) of parent drug and main metabolite excreted into the urine (p less than 0.001). The renal clearance of xipamide was only moderately reduced in patients with liver cirrhosis. Both AUC and Ae were positively correlated to the plasma concentration of direct bilirubin of the patients (p less than 0.05). We concluded that nonrenal drug clearance in patients with liver cirrhosis was reduced as a result of the blockade of hepatobiliary excretion during cholestatic conditions. 
5	Muscle relaxation rates in individuals susceptible to malignant hyperthermia. Muscle relaxation rate following a tetanic stimulus of adductor pollicis muscle was measured prospectively in 26 patients potentially susceptible to malignant hyperthermia (MH) the day before a muscle biopsy was obtained for MH in vitro screening. Eleven subjects were found to be MH susceptible (MHS) and 15 subjects MH-negative (MHN). In all patients, relaxation rate was recorded at three different temperatures of the skin overlying adductor pollicis (30, 34 and 38 degrees C) achieved by a small surface heating unit placed over the thenar eminence. The MHS group exhibited slightly higher relaxation rate at 34 and 38 degrees C compared with the MHN group and this difference was accentuated with increasing temperature, but was not statistically different. The results of the present study suggest that relaxation rates are normal in MHS individuals under physiological conditions and cannot be used diagnostically for MH screening. 
5	Chronic functional gastrointestinal symptoms in Holocaust survivors. In Nazi-occupied Europe (1939-1945), Jews were submitted to extreme mental and physical hardships (the Holocaust). This study was designed to investigate the impact of the severe protracted suffering on the development of chronic functional gastrointestinal symptoms. Thus, we studied 623 consecutive patients of Eastern European origin who had been admitted for nongastrointestinal complaints. They filled out detailed questionnaires, and were divided into the following two groups: A) Holocaust survivors [237 subjects who had been for at least 6 months in either German concentration/extermination camps (95 subjects), ghetto and/or underground movements (65 subjects), labor camps not directly supervised by Germans (79 subjects)], and B) a control group (384 subjects from the same demographic background, who had not been exposed to Nazi persecutions). The symptoms investigated were the following: abdominal pain, irregular bowel habits, diarrhea, constipation, abdominal distension, heartburn, flatulence, anorexia, nausea, vomiting, mucus in stool, tenesmus, and aerophagia. Patients were defined as having functional symptoms after these had been present for at least 5 yr and relevant organic disease had been excluded. The prevalence, duration of suffering, and frequency of appearance of most symptoms were significantly higher in the group of Holocaust survivors. This study supports the clinical observations that severe and protracted suffering contributes to the development of chronic functional gastrointestinal symptomatology. 
5	Defects in the precore region of the HBV genome in patients with chronic hepatitis B after sustained seroconversion from HBeAg to anti-HBe induced spontaneously or with interferon therapy. Hepatitis B virus DNA clones were propagated from sera of six patients with chronic hepatitis B who seroconverted from HBeAg to antibody to HBeAg either spontaneously or after administration of alpha-interferon. Defects in the precore region blocking synthesis and secretion of HBeAg were detected in all 46 hepatitis B virus DNA clones from three patients who remained positive for antibody to HBeAg and in whom hepatitis resolved. Defective clones had point mutations from guanine to adenine at nucleotide 83 in the precore region, converting codon 28 from tryptophan (TGG) to a stop codon (TAG). In contrast, this defect was not found in any of 39 hepatitis B virus DNA clones from three patients who seroconverted to antibody to HBeAg but then redeveloped HBeAg with reactivation of hepatitis. Using these results, the G-to-A point mutation at nucleotide 83 in the precore region would predict sustained positivity for antibody to HBeAg and remission of hepatitis in patients who have seroconverted either spontaneously or with interferon therapy. 
5	Physiologic parameters and perceived exertion with local muscle fatigue in postpolio subjects. Fifty postpolio patients, 34 with and 16 without complaints of progressive loss of muscle strength, and 41 control subjects were studied to compare physiologic measures of the fatiguing process and to determine whether there is a significant interaction between the rating of perceived exertion (RPE) and physiologic measures. Statistical analyses were by ANOVA and repeated-measures ANOVA. The RPE was obtained every 20 seconds during an isometric contraction of the quadriceps at 40% of maximal torque; median frequency (Fm) of the power spectrum of the surface electromyographic signal and neuromuscular efficiency (NME) were constantly monitored. The RPE increased similarly (p greater than .05), whereas Fm and NME decreased similarly (p greater than .05) during endurance exercise at 40% of maximal torque in all three groups. A significant (p less than .05) interaction was found between RPE and both Fm and NME. We conclude that physiologic measures of the fatiguing process (Fm and NME) occur in a similar manner in postpolio and control subjects and that there is a significant interaction between subjective RPE and physiologic measures of the fatiguing process. 
4	Implantation of an endoluminal prosthesis at the distal anastomosis of a bypass graft for abrupt closure following balloon angioplasty. A coronary Wallstent was implanted in a 10-year-old saphenous vein bypass graft following a PTCA that was complicated by abrupt closure. Anterograde flow was restored and no myocardial necrosis resulted. One week later, bypass surgery was performed due to a bleeding complication associated with the anticoagulation regimen. 
4	Surgical epicardial ablation of left ventricular pathway using sling exposure We report our experience with 43 consecutive patients with left free wall pathways operated on since December 1988 using a modified direct epicardial approach through a medial sternotomy, without the adjunct of normothermic cardiopulmonary bypass. The left atrioventricular sulcus is exposed by dislocating the heart cephalad and to the right using a sling made of a large sponge passed around the ventricle through the transverse sinus. While the arterial pressure is monitored, the heart is positioned to obtain adequate exposure without compromising the ventricular function. The left atrioventricular junction is exposed using a direct approach. The epicardium is incised along the ventricular edge and a plane of dissection is identified and opened using blunt dissection over the ventricular wall. The entire left atrioventricular junction can be exposed. After dissection, electrophysiological testing is repeated to assess accessory pathway conduction. Epicardial cryoablation was used when accessory pathway conduction was not present (42 patients). Transmural cryoablation was used under normothermic cardiopulmonary bypass when accessory pathway conduction persisted after dissection (subendocardial pathway). In all, cardiopulmonary bypass was not used in 41 patients. There was one early relapse that required transmural cryoablation. There were no complications. 
5	Predictive value of congenital hypertrophy of the retinal pigment epithelium as a clinical marker for familial adenomatous polyposis. One hundred forty-eight members of 53 kindreds with familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP) were examined for congenital hypertrophy of the retinal pigment epithelium (CHRPE) and extracolonic manifestations (ECM) to assess the value of CHRPE as a predictive marker for FAP. Based on eye examination results, the families were divided into 2 groups. In a first group of 34 families, all 61 members diagnosed as having polyps and 13 of the 33 patients at risk had 4 or more lesions distributed in both eyes. By contrast, in a second group of 18 families, all 32 polyposis patients and all 18 members at risk had less than 4 lesions. Extra-colonic manifestations were present in 26 of 34 families in the first group and in 11 of 18 families in the second group. Data on one family with ambiguous ancestry were reviewed separately. The existence of 4 or more CHRPE lesions distributed in both eyes seems to be a congenital marker for FAP, present in 65.4 percent of families. When present in a family: 1) it is found in all diagnosed patients in that family, 2) can therefore be considered predictive for the development of polyps in other family members who carry the trait, and 3) if confirmed by longer follow-up, may possibly preclude members without the trait from further evaluation and surveillance. 
5	Surgical staples in cesarean section: a randomized controlled trial. This randomized controlled trial compares the use of the Auto Suture Poly CS 57 disposable surgical stapler (n = 98) with standard hysterectomy (n = 102) in low transverse cesarean sections. Subjective assessment of blood loss by the surgeon resulted in lower mean (+/- SEM) total blood loss estimates in the stapled group (492 +/- 24 ml) than in the nonstapled group (579 +/- 38 ml) (p = 0.05). However, surgeon's estimation of blood loss as a result of the hysterotomy and blood loss estimated by the hemoglobin deficit measured on the second postoperative day did not significantly differ between the two groups. The use of the stapling device tended to lengthen the total operating time, which averaged 42.5 minutes in the group with the staples and 39.2 minutes in the group with the standard hysterotomy (p = 0.05). The risk of febrile morbidity, the frequency of endometritis, and the length of hospitalization were similar in the two groups. Our results do not support the routine use of the Auto Suture Poly CS 57 disposable surgical stapler in low transverse cesarean sections. 
5	Ischemic intestinal complications in patients with burns. Enteral bacterial translocation has been implicated as a major cause of morbidity in instances of trauma, but little clinical evidence of the loss of intestinal mucosal integrity has been documented. A retrospective review of the medical and autopsy records of all patients admitted between 1982 and 1988 was performed to describe the incidence of intestinal pathologic findings. Of all deaths, a total of 53 per cent of adults (greater than 18 years old) and 61 per cent of children (zero to 17 years old) were noted to have ischemic intestinal pathologic findings on autopsy, ranging from superficial necrosis to full thickness mucosal necrosis extending into the omentum. More than 80 per cent of these patients were septic at the time of death, with endogenous intestinal flora species most frequently identified as the causative agent. Less than 1 per cent (n = 16) of the patients admitted were clinically identified with intestinal pathologic examination, surgically explored and underwent resection of the intestine. Despite intervention, this group suffered a 69 per cent mortality rate. Although the documentation of bacterial translocation in a human model may be obscured by other potential sources of contamination, for example, burn wound, in combination with the immunosuppression inherent to the thermally injured, may lead to bacterial contamination of the systemic circulation and, therefore, may be a significant contributor to morbidity and mortality after thermal injury. 
3	Occipital condyle fracture presenting as retropharyngeal hematoma. Reported is the case of a 30-year-old male motorcycle accident victim who was found on plain cervical-spine radiography to have prevertebral soft-tissue swelling. Although subsequent computed tomography demonstrated no cervical-spine fracture, it did reveal a fracture of one occipital condyle. The mechanism, diagnosis, and treatment of occipital condyle fractures are reviewed, as is the ligamentous and fascial anatomy of the cervicocranium. Dissection of fracture hematoma inferiorly along vertically oriented tissue planes is hypothesized as the pathogenesis of our patient's retropharyngeal hematoma. In addition to being a sign of potential cervical-spine injury, post-traumatic prevertebral soft-tissue swelling may also indicate occipital condyle fracture. To avoid overlooking such fractures, computed tomography undertaken to investigate upper cervical-spine prevertebral soft-tissue swelling should always include slices up to the level of the basal skull so as to visualize the condyles. 
5	Long-time survival of a patient with glioblastoma and Turcot's syndrome. Case report. A rare case of Turcot's syndrome is reported in a long-time survivor of glioblastoma multiforme. The patient was treated for his tumor in 1976 with macroscopically complete surgical resection and radiotherapy consisting of 60 Gy to the tumor bed and 40 Gy to the whole brain. Five years later, in 1981, he developed adenocarcinoma of the colon Dukes Stage B which was successfully treated at another hospital by surgery alone. In 1990, he presented with multiple colon polyps and adenocarcinoma Dukes Stage A. For more than 15 years, the patient has been afflicted with cystic and conglobate acne. Possible mechanisms and treatment with 13-cis retinoic acid are discussed. 
1	Stereotactic radiosurgery of meningiomas. Stereotactic radiosurgery has an expanding role in the management of selected intracranial tumors. In an initial 30-month experience using the 201-source cobalt-60 gamma knife at the University of Pittsburgh, 50 patients with meningiomas were treated. The most frequent site of origin was the skull base. Previously, 36 patients (72%) had undergone at least one craniotomy and four patients (8%) had received fractionated external beam radiation therapy. Stereotactic radiosurgery was the primary treatment modality in 16 patients (32%) with symptomatic tumors demonstrated by neuroimaging. Computer imaging-generated isodose plans (with one to five irradiation isocenters) for single-treatment irradiation gave optimal (greater than or equal to 50% isodose line) coverage in 44 patients (88%). The proximity of cranial nerves or vascular, pituitary, and brain-stem structures to the often convoluted tumor mass was crucial to dose selection. Serial imaging studies were evaluated in all 50 patients. Twenty-four patients were examined between 12 and 36 months after treatment; 13 (54%) showed a reduction in tumor volume while nine (38%) showed no change. Of 26 patients evaluated between 6 and 12 months after treatment, four showed a decrease in tumor size while 22 showed no change. Two patients (both with large tumors that received suboptimal irradiation) had delayed tumor growth outside the radiosurgical treatment volume. The actuarial 2-year tumor growth control rate was 96%. Between 3 and 12 months after radiosurgery, three patients developed delayed neurological deficits that gradually improved, compatible with delayed radiation injury. Although extended follow-up monitoring over many years will be necessary to fully evaluate treatment, to date stereotactic radiosurgery has proved to be a relatively safe and effective therapy for selected patients with symptomatic meningiomas, including those who failed surgical resection. Radiosurgery was an effective primary treatment alternative for those patients whose advanced age, medical condition, or high-risk tumor location mitigated against surgical resection. 
4	Serum and tissue magnesium concentrations in patients with heart failure and serious ventricular arrhythmias. OBJECTIVE: To compare magnesium concentrations in serum and tissue from patients with heart failure. Two groups of patients were compared, those with or without serious ventricular arrhythmias. DESIGN: Consecutive enrollment. Blinded laboratory analyses. SETTING: Referral inpatient service of the cardiology division of a university hospital. PATIENTS: Twenty-three patients with idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy and mild to moderately severe congestive heart failure (New York Heart Association functional class II to IV) were divided into two groups: 9 patients with sustained ventricular tachycardias and 14 patients without serious ventricular arrhythmias (control). INTERVENTIONS: Medications for heart failure were withdrawn 12 hours or more before study. Antiarrhythmic therapy was continued throughout the study. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: The patients had skeletal muscle biopsies, myocardial biopsies, and blood sampling for the analysis of magnesium concentrations. No statistically significant differences in the mean magnesium concentrations in serum, circulating mononuclear cells, skeletal muscle, and myocardium were found when the 9 patients with ventricular arrhythmias were compared with the 14 control patients without serious ventricular arrhythmias. CONCLUSIONS: In a general, ambulatory sample of patients with heart failure, magnesium depletion in serum and tissue does not appear to occur more commonly in patients with serious ventricular arrhythmias than in patients without serious ventricular arrhythmias. 
2	Effect of ulcerative colitis and smoking on rectal blood flow. Rectal blood flow was measured by laser doppler flowmetry over 60 minutes in eight patients with colitis in remission and eight healthy male non-smokers. Ten smokers were also examined on two occasions, one of which included smoking a cigarette. Plasma nicotine concentrations were measured in smokers. All subjects showed a pronounced fall in rectal blood flow in the first 30 minutes and patients with colitis had significantly higher values compared with smokers (p less than 0.002; p less than 0.04) and non-smokers (p less than 0.007; p less than 0.002) during the first and second 30 minutes respectively. Values in smokers and non-smokers were similar, but smoking a cigarette was associated with a significant fall in blood flow (p less than 0.04) and this change was inversely related to the rise in plasma nicotine concentration (r = -0.63; p less than 0.05). The findings may be relevant to the association between colitis and the smoking history. 
3	The classification and diagnosis of headache disorders. Headache disorders recently have been reclassified, and new operational diagnostic criteria assist in making the correct diagnosis. These diagnostic criteria have been accepted worldwide. 
1	Cranial nerve palsy in childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. Forty-five children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia or non-Hodgkin's lymphoma had cranial nerve palsy (CNP) as a complication of their disease. Twenty-two of these children had CNP initially and 23, at relapse, with or without previous hematologic relapse. Only one of the 23 patients with CNP at relapse was a long-term survivor. In contrast, 11 of the 22 children who had CNP initially survived in remission for 3+ months to 13+ years. Two factors are associated with an improved outcome for patients with CNP at diagnosis: treatment after 1979 (P less than 0.004) and male gender (P less than 0.01). Patients who received radiation therapy fared better than those for whom radiation was not given (disease-free survival at 2 years 53% versus 29%). The authors conclude that CNP signifies an aggressive or advanced disease requiring intensive systemic chemotherapy and that the role of irradiation should be examined for this group of patients. 
4	Noninvasive assessment of cerebral collateral blood supply through the ophthalmic artery. We assessed the potential of 2-MHz pulsed-wave transorbital Doppler ultrasonography to delineate the role of the ophthalmic artery as a source of collateral cerebral blood supply by comparing oculopneumoplethysmography, transorbital Doppler ultrasonography, periorbital continuous-wave Doppler ultrasonography, and transcranial Doppler ultrasonography in 25 patients with unilateral internal carotid artery occlusion and five controls with 10 normal internal carotid arteries. Systolic ophthalmic artery blood velocity was reduced ipsilateral to an internal carotid artery occlusion (38.2 +/- 10.2 cm/sec) compared with the contralateral and control velocities (46.0 +/- 10.3 and 47.5 +/- 6.8 cm/sec, respectively; p less than 0.05). Ophthalmic systolic pressure measured by oculopneumoplethysmography was 94.7 +/- 13.2 mm Hg ipsilateral to an internal carotid artery occlusion compared with 108.4 +/- 15.3 mm Hg on the contralateral side (p less than 0.01). Transorbital and periorbital Doppler ultrasonography detected reversed ophthalmic artery blood flow ipsilateral to an internal carotid artery occlusion in 44.0% and 40.0% of the patients, respectively. Systolic middle cerebral artery blood velocity was 55.2 +/- 22.3 cm/sec ipsilateral to an internal carotid artery occlusion compared with 79.4 +/- 23.5 cm/sec on the contralateral side (p less than 0.05) and 101.2 +/- 18.9 cm/sec in the controls (p less than 0.05). Reversed ophthalmic artery blood flow was associated with a low middle cerebral artery blood velocity and lack of major intracerebral collaterals. Transorbital Doppler ultrasonography permits noninvasive evaluation of the ophthalmic artery. 
2	Bile acids and the increased risk of colorectal tumours after truncal vagotomy. An association between colorectal cancer and previous peptic ulcer surgery is reported. In a prospective screening study, 100 asymptomatic patients (80 men and 20 women) who had undergone truncal vagotomy at least 10 years previously were investigated by barium enema, colonoscopy and gallbladder ultrasonography. Control data were obtained from forensic autopsy subjects. The incidence of neoplasms greater than or equal to 1.0 cm in the vagotomized group was 14 per cent (11 adenomas, 3 carcinomas) and 3 per cent in controls (P = 0.01). Duodenal bile obtained at endoscopy from 21 vagotomized patients with normal gallbladders and from 21 control patients undergoing endoscopy was analysed by high performance liquid chromatography. The mean percentage of cholic (CA), chenodeoxycholic (CDCA), deoxycholic (DCA) and lithocholic (LCA) acids in the bile of vagotomized patients was 32.3, 45.6, 20.7 and 1.4 per cent respectively compared with 45.3, 36.2, 17.9 and 0.7 per cent respectively in controls. The increased proportions of CDCA and LCA and decreased proportions of CA in the duodenal bile of vagotomized patients were significant (P less than 0.001; P = 0.02; P = 0.007). Abnormalities in bile acid metabolism may help to explain the increased risk of colorectal neoplasia 10 years after truncal vagotomy. 
4	Risk stratification in survivors of acute myocardial infarction: routine cardiac catheterization and angiography is a reasonable approach in most patients [editorial] Noninvasive risk assessment in survivors of AMI can effectively subdivide patients into groups with differing risk profiles after hospital discharge, but some patients at risk for late death or recurrent AMI may be incorrectly identified; data from cardiac catheterization and angiography provide complementary and generally more powerful prognostic information. Many patients may derive particular benefit from early cardiac catheterization and angiography, including: (1) patients with AMI complicated by recurrent myocardial ischemia, congestive heart failure, and/or complex ventricular arrhythmias; (2) patients with abnormal or inconclusive results of noninvasive testing or those patients unable to perform an exercise test; (3) patients with abnormal left ventricular global systolic function and those with increased left ventricular end-systolic volume; (4) "young" patients (younger than 50 years of age?); (5) older patients (older than 65 to 70 years of age?); (6) patients with non-Q wave AMI; and (7) patients who are receiving thrombolytic therapy. Performance of early cardiac catheterization and angiography in virtually all survivors of AMI, with selective use of appropriate noninvasive tests, may provide a more efficacious means of risk assessment after AMI; if all tests are performed judiciously, the cost of such an approach need not be excessive. A combination of invasive and selected noninvasive tests probably provides optimal information. The risks to the routine performance of diagnostic cardiac catheterization and angiography in all survivors of AMI are: (1) adequate care and attention may not be paid to proper performance of the procedure(s) and to detailed and proper analyses of the data; (2) the need for additional noninvasive testing in selected patients may be ignored; and most importantly, (3) premature or unnecessary revascularization procedures may be performed subsequently. For optimal patient care, the clinician must obtain all necessary data, avoid unnecessary and repetitive tests, know the accuracy of individual tests at his or her own facility, interpret all data in proper context, and then counsel patients objectively about available management strategies. With this approach, all patients who might appropriately benefit from coronary artery revascularization will be correctly identified, and patients who are truly at very low risk (minimal residual coronary artery disease and preserved left ventricular function particularly if associated with a patent infarct-related artery) may be similarly identified and managed appropriately with elimination of unnecessary additional testing and pharmacologic therapy. Finally, whatever approach to risk stratification one chooses for an individual patient, the importance of and the need to correct and/or ameliorate risk factors for coronary artery disease must be recognized and undertaken. 
5	Technetium-99m-HMPAO brain SPECT in medically intractable temporal lobe epilepsy: a postoperative evaluation. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the predictive value of interictal single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) using technetium-99m-labeled hexamethyl propyleneamine oxime (HMPAO) for the outcome after temporal lobectomy in patients with complex partial seizures. Out of 40 patients, 21 underwent right-sided and 19 left-sided temporal lobectomy. EEG and CT/MRI were primarily used to select the side of surgery. SPECT results correlated with temporal lobectomy in 68% of the patients. After surgical intervention, memory function was tested for both sides. Following left-sided temporal lobectomy, verbal memory was impaired in 8% of the patients, if SPECT agreed with the side selected for surgery, but in 83%, if it diverged from it. In the present study, there was no relationship between SPECT concordance with the side of temporal lobectomy and outcome as to seizure frequency and non-verbal memory. We conclude that preoperative interictal HMPAO/SPECT can contribute to the prediction of postoperative verbal memory function and that this method should be considered for use prior to temporal lobectomy. 
1	Transoesophageal echocardiography improves the diagnostic value of cardiac ultrasound in patients with carcinoid heart disease. Transthoracic and transoesophageal cardiac echocardiography and Doppler investigations were performed in 31 consecutive patients with malignant midgut carcinoid tumours. The transoesophageal images allowed measurement of the thickness of the atrioventricular valve leaflets and the superficial wall layers on the cavity side of both atria. The mean thickness of the anterior tricuspid leaflet was significantly greater than that of the mitral valve--a difference not seen in a control group of age-matched patients without carcinoid tumours and with normal cardiac ultrasound findings. In addition, the edges of the tricuspid leaflets were thickened giving them a clubbed appearance. Tricuspid incompetence was detected transoesophageally in 71% of the patients with carcinoid compared with 57% by transthoracic investigation. The inner layer of the right atrial wall in the carcinoid patients was significantly thicker than that of the left atrium and that of both atria in the controls. Furthermore, patients with other signs of severe carcinoid heart disease had significantly thicker mean right atrial luminal wall layer than those with less or no signs of right heart disease. Transoesophageal cardiac ultrasound investigation improved the diagnostic accuracy and seemed to show the structural changes typical of carcinoid heart disease established by histopathological investigations. 
1	Activation and inducer subset phenotype of the lymphocytic infiltrate around epidermally derived tumors. An in situ analysis of the mononuclear cell infiltrate found in association with a range of benign, premalignant, and malignant epidermal tumors is described. The predominant cell phenotype was that of the recently described immunoregulatory helper/inducer T lymphocyte. A large number of lymphocytes expressed antigens associated with cellular activation, suggesting an ongoing immunologic response by the host against the tumor, although evidence of in situ proliferation of these cells was lacking. These findings suggest that the infiltrate found in association with cutaneous tumors does not represent passive accumulation of lymphocytes from the circulation but rather an active antitumor response. 
1	Prognostic value of histopathology in Ewing's sarcoma. Long-term follow-up of distal extremity primary tumors. The pathologic material from 56 patients diagnosed initially as Ewing's sarcoma of the distal extremity and treated on National Cancer Institute protocols between 1968 and 1984 was reviewed and correlated with clinical outcome. Histologically, the tumors were categorized, based on recent pathologic criteria, into three diagnostic groups: (1) typical Ewing's sarcoma, (2) atypical Ewing's sarcoma, and (3) other (predominantly peripheral neuroepithelioma [PN]). Thirty-two patients (57%) had typical Ewing's, 13 (23%) were atypical, and 11 (20%) were in the "other" diagnostic category (seven [13%] PN, two primitive rhabdomyosarcoma, one primitive sarcoma of bone, and one synovial cell sarcoma). No cases of metastatic neuroblastoma, osteosarcoma, or lymphoma were found. Forty-five patients had localized disease at diagnosis; 11 had metastases. Patients with typical Ewing's sarcoma were less likely to have metastatic disease at the time of diagnosis. Only two of 32 patients with typical Ewing's sarcoma had metastases compared with nine of 24 patients in the two other groups. The pattern of relapse was also different in these other groups compared with typical Ewing's patients; five patients developed lymph node metastases and two patients developed brain metastases. Although the presence of metastatic disease at diagnosis was a strong negative prognostic factor, our histologic grouping was independently prognostic of clinical outcome in patients with localized disease. Patients with typical osseous Ewing's sarcoma had an improved overall survival (P2 = 0.03) and patients with other tumors (neither typical nor atypical Ewing's sarcoma) had a poorer disease-free survival (P2 = 0.02). Since no generally accepted histopathologic prognostic criteria exist for Ewing's sarcoma, the potential value of our proposed classification should be evaluated in a larger retrospective and a prospective study. 
4	Clinical and anatomic considerations for surgery in tibial disease and the results of surgery. Bypass vein grafts to the infrapopliteal arteries now achieve a 5-year cumulative patency equivalent to that of vein grafts to the popliteal arteries. The technique of in situ vein grafting to the tibial arteries is described and the results are presented. The 5-year cumulative patency for such bypasses and the 5-year limb salvage in the same patients have both been approximately 80%. These results coupled with those reported from other centers that have sizable experience in tibial artery reconstruction suggest that there has been real progress over the past decade in the salvage of lower extremities in patients with far advanced peripheral vascular disease through the use of autogenous venous bypass grafts. 
4	Improvement of systolic and diastolic left ventricular wall motion by serial echocardiograms in selected patients treated for unstable angina. The purpose of the study was to evaluate the effect of antiischemic treatment on left ventricular function in selected patients with unstable angina pectoris that was due to severe proximal left anterior descending coronary artery narrowing and to identify subgroups liable to an adverse outcome (mean term 2.7 years). Effect of antiischemic treatment on systolic and diastolic left ventricular wall motion was studied in 35 patients who had unstable angina pectoris and an electrocardiogram that indicated severe proximal left anterior descending coronary artery narrowing. Treatment consisted of either a revascularization procedure (17 patients) or antianginal drug therapy (18 patients). All patients underwent a two-dimensional echocardiographic study within 48 hours (mean 20 hours) of entry into the study. This study semiquantitatively analyzed systolic performance of the ischemia-related segments by calculation of a total wall motion score. In 16 patients this investigation was combined with a continuous detailed recording of only the apical interventricular septal wall motion. This detailed study included measurements for regional function by providing a typification of the pattern of systolic and early diastolic excursion of the endocardial border of the apical interventricular septum. A repeat ultrasonic study was performed at least 1 month (median 2 months, 7 days) after admission. Results of the systolic wall motion analyses of all 35 patients showed, in both treatment groups, a significant improvement in systolic wall motion of the anterior and apical segments (mean total wall motion score at early study vs late study: revascularization, 6.9 vs 2.2 and medical therapy, 4.6 vs 1.0). 
1	Recognition by ELAM-1 of the sialyl-Lex determinant on myeloid and tumor cells. Endothelial leukocyte adhesion molecule-1 (ELAM-1) is an endothelial cell adhesion molecule that allows myeloid cells to attach to the walls of blood vessels adjacent to sites of inflammation. ELAM-1 recognizes the sialyl-Lewis X (sialyl-Lex) determinant, NeuAc alpha 2-3Gal beta 1-4(Fuc alpha 1-3)GlcNAc-, a granulocyte carbohydrate also found on the surface of some tumor cell lines. Binding of myeloid cells to soluble ELAM-1 is inhibited by a monoclonal antibody recognizing sialyl-Lex or by proteins bearing sialyl-Lex, some of which may participate in humoral regulation of myeloid cell adhesion. Stimulated granulocytes also release an inhibitor of ELAM-1 binding that can be selectively adsorbed by monoclonal antibody to sialyl-Lex. 
1	Decollateralization with silicone rubber sheeting for advanced hepatocellular carcinoma: a preliminary report. A new treatment method, interception of collaterals with a silicone rubber sheet, was applied to three patients with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma in whom arterial chemoembolization was assessed as ineffective because of the developed collateral feeding arteries. This procedure was followed by arterial chemoembolization or intraportal infusion chemotherapy or both. Follow-up celiac angiography confirmed that the long-term decollateralization was achieved by shielding the liver with silicone rubber sheeting. This technique resulted in partial responses without serious complications in all the patients including two who had no responses to chemoembolization before the procedure. The response durations were 5, 21, and 27, months, respectively. One patient died of gastrointestinal bleeding 7 months after the decollateralization. The other two patients are still alive, and the survivals after the procedure are 28 and 30 months, respectively. This therapy is considered promising and may be worth choosing as an adjuvant treatment for advanced hepatic malignancies uncontrolled by arterial chemotherapy or chemoembolization. 
4	Identification of viable myocardium in patients with chronic coronary artery disease and left ventricular dysfunction. Comparison of thallium scintigraphy with reinjection and PET imaging with 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose In patients with chronic coronary artery disease and left ventricular dysfunction, the distinction between ventricular dysfunction arising from myocardial fibrosis and ischemic, but viable, myocardium has important clinical implications. By positron emission tomography (PET), enhanced fluorine-18-labeled fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) uptake in myocardial segments with impaired function and reduced blood flow is evidence of myocardial viability. Reinjection of thallium-201 at rest immediately after stress-redistribution imaging may also provide evidence of myocardial viability by demonstrating thallium uptake in regions with apparently "irreversible" defects. To compare these two methods, we studied 16 patients with chronic coronary artery disease and left ventricular dysfunction (ejection fraction, 27 +/- 9%), all of whom had irreversible defects on standard exercise-redistribution thallium single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) imaging. Thallium was reinjected immediately after the redistribution study, and SPECT images were reacquired. The patients also underwent PET imaging with FDG and oxygen-15-labeled water. A total of 432 myocardial segments were analyzed from comparable transaxial tomograms, of which 166 (38%) had irreversible thallium defects on redistribution images before reinjection. FDG uptake was demonstrated in 121 (73%) of these irreversible defects. Irreversible defects were then subgrouped according to the degree of thallium activity, relative to peak activity in normal regions. Irreversible defects with only mild (60-85% of peak activity) or moderate (50-59% of peak) reduction in thallium activity were considered viable on the basis of FDG uptake in 91% and 84% of these segments, respectively. In contrast, in irreversible defects with severe reduction in thallium activity (less than 50% of peak), FDG uptake was present in 51% of segments. In such severe defects, an identical number of segments (51%) demonstrated enhanced uptake of thallium after reinjection. In these severe "irreversible" defects, data on myocardial viability were concordant by the two techniques in 88% of segments, with 45% identified as viable and 43% identified as scar on both PET and thallium reinjection studies. These observations suggest that thallium imaging can be used to identify viable myocardium in patients with chronic coronary artery disease and left ventricular dysfunction. Most irreversible defects with only mild or moderate reduction in thallium activity represent viable myocardium as confirmed by FDG uptake.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS). 
5	Late cholangitis after successful surgical repair of biliary atresia. Bacterial cholangitis is a frequent complication of successful surgical repair of biliary atresia, occurring in 93% of patients before the age of 1 year, but thought to be rare after 2 years of age. Among 76 children free of jaundice more than 5 years after operation, four presented with late cholangitis (7 to 13.5 years old), consisting of fever, jaundice, and abdominal pain with biochemical features of an inflammatory process and cholestasis. Liver biopsy specimens consistently demonstrated histological features of cholangitis, growth of microorganism, or both. Cholangitis subsided spontaneously in one patient or in response to intravenous administration of antibiotics. Cholangiography consistently demonstrated biliary abnormalities but no definite obstruction to the bilioenteric anastomosis. All the children had good hepatic function 3 weeks to 4 years after the episode of cholangitis. These results suggest that cholangitis may occur several years after surgery but does not seem to alter prognosis. 
1	Palliative treatment of bile duct tumoral compression by an endoprosthesis: clinical results. The palliative therapy of stenoses of the biliary tract is a difficult choice. Because percutaneous or endoscopic drainage methods are fraught with complications, an endoprosthesis for surgical intubation of the biliary tract has been developed. Thirty patients were treated by this method. After choledochotomy, the endoprosthesis is positioned surgically above the sphincter of Oddi, thereby avoiding ascending cholangitis. Twenty-nine patients (13 with gallbladder cancer, 11 with cholangiocarcinomas, 5 with metastases) presented with neoplastic compression, and one patient had an early postoperative stricture with loss of substance after right hepatectomy for hepatic metastases. The operative mortality was 3.3% (one pulmonary complication). Resolution of jaundice was obtained in all but two patients, and pruritus always resolved. The mean survival time for the patients with cholangiocarcinoma was 12.2 months and 6.33 months for those with gallbladder cancer. Indices of satisfaction (Bismuth's method) were 71% (gallbladder cancer), 93.5% (hilar cholangiocarcinoma), and 92% (metastatic compressions). This new type of surgical endoprosthesis is an alternative in the palliative treatment of neoplastic hilar compression because it is well tolerated, has a low rate of operative mortality or morbidity, and affords an acceptable quality of life for the patients. 
5	Impaired oxidative metabolism increases adenine nucleotide breakdown in McArdle's disease. Two patients with muscle phosphorylase deficiency [McArdle's disease (McA)] were studied during bicycle exercise at 40 (n = 2) and 60 W (n = 1). Peak heart rate was 170 and 162 beats/min, corresponding to approximately 90% of estimated maximal heart rate. Muscle samples were taken at rest and immediately after exercise from the quadriceps femoris. Lactate content remained low in both muscle and blood. Acetylcarnitine, which constitutes a readily available form of acetyl units and thus a substrate for the tricarboxylic acid cycle, was very low in McA patients both at rest and during exercise, corresponding to approximately 17 and 11%, respectively, of that in healthy subjects. Muscle NADH was unchanged during exercise in McA patients in contrast to healthy subjects, in whom NADH increases markedly at high exercise intensities. Despite low lactate levels, arterial plasma NH3 and muscle inosine 5'-monophosphate increased more steeply relative to work load in McA patients than in healthy subjects. The low postexercise levels of lactate, acetylcarnitine, and NADH in McA patients support the idea that exercise performance is limited by the availability of oxidative fuels. Increases in muscle inosine 5'-monophosphate and plasma NH3 indicate that lack of glycogen as an oxidative fuel is associated with adenine nucleotide breakdown and increased deamination of AMP. It is suggested that the early onset of fatigue in McA patients is caused by an insufficient rate of ADP phosphorylation, resulting in transient increases in ADP. 
4	Discordant nephron function. A pathogenic factor in hypertension and its vascular complications of stroke and heart attack. Morphologic evidence from patients with essential hypertension and Goldblatt-type hypertension reveals a subpopulation of narrowed afferent arterioles to ischemic nephrons. These ischemic nephrons, responding individually to their perception of underperfusion, secrete renin. In response, the normal nephrons are in adaptive natriuresis and have appropriately shut off their renin production. Nevertheless, they are affected adversely by the discordant renin-angiotensin II arising from the ischemic nephrons' presence, which exerts an unwanted sodium-retaining effect on the proximal tubules of the adapting nephrons. The end result is elevated blood pressure from too much sodium retention for the level of renin activity, that is, an abnormal renin-sodium product. Thus, "normal" renin levels in a hypertensive individual are abnormal because healthy kidneys shut off renin production entirely when blood pressure rises. This construction explains why angiotensin converting enzyme inhibition often corrects "normal" renin hypertension. Although such hypertension may be partly sodium-mediated as a consequence of inappropriate sodium retention by the normal and ischemic nephrons, the source of the problem lies in the renin production from ischemic nephrons. The correct treatment, then, is an antirenin therapy designed to block renin synthesis or secretion or angiotensin II formation or action. In view of modern studies suggesting that renin excesses also correlate with an increased risk of heart attack and stroke, the role of antirenin and antiangiotensin agents in treatment assumes additional relevance. 
3	Pain control in the ambulatory elderly. Pain control in the elderly, no matter what the etiology or setting, can be a major clinical challenge. Aging causes unique physiologic changes, eg, a decreased perception of pain and an enhanced sensitivity to opioid analgesics. Principles regarding evaluation of patients with pain are reviewed, including the use of an objective instrument for pain assessment from the viewpoint of both physician and patient. Good pain control can be achieved with the nonopioids, such as acetaminophen and the nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, the opioid analgesics, and, in some cases, adjuvant agents. Discussed also are the concerns for patient addiction and the WHO Cancer Pain Relief program. 
5	Recognition of cemetery remains in the forensic setting. Cemetery remains exposed through vandalism or natural phenomena are frequently brought to the attention of law enforcement agents or medical examiners. Although it is often difficult to distinguish cemetery remains from those of medicolegal significance, clues to their origin may exist. Characteristics consistent with cemetery remains include physical characteristics associated with the embalming process. Characteristics indicative of cemetery remains include functional or ornamental artifacts associated with the coffin, devices used in embalming the body, and elevated levels of embalming chemicals in the soft tissue. 
3	Angiographic changes suggestive of vasospasm in migraine complicated by stroke. A 30-year-old woman with a history of common migraine developed a permanent left homonymous hemianopia during a typical headache. CT scan demonstrated a right posterior cerebral infarction and angiography showed irregular narrowing of the ipsilateral posterior cerebral artery, suggestive of vasospasm. In the case no risk factors for atherosclerotic stroke were present except for smoking, and no other causes of stroke could be found. 
5	A randomized control trial of two cervical spatulas The sampling efficacy of the Ayre and Rocket cervical spatulas was compared in a randomized controlled trial involving 533 women who were attending a colposcopy clinic either for investigation of cytological abnormality or for review after treatment of CIN. Smears were compared with respect to the presence of cytological abnormality and two types of normal cervical epithelial cells (endocervical and immature metaplastic cells) which are considered indicators of adequate cytological sampling. Smears taken with the Rocket spatula were significantly less likely to contain immature metaplastic cells (95% CI on difference in proportion; 5-30%), but more likely to contain endocervical cells (95% CI 16-36%). No significant difference was found in the proportion of smears containing one or other type of indicator cell or in the yield of abnormal smears. It is concluded that the Rocket spatula offered no advantage when used in these circumstances. This study illustrates how spurious conclusions of sampling efficacy can be drawn if only one type of indicator cell is used as an endpoint. 
3	Stroke and its modification in Parkinson's disease. Previous studies have not agreed on the incidence of ischemic stroke in persons with Parkinson's disease. There are epidemiologic and neurochemical facets of Parkinson's disease that might confer some benefit or protection against ischemic stroke. We used a case-control method to determine the lifetime history of ischemic stroke in 200 patients with Parkinson's disease and 200 controls of a similar age range. Analysis was also carried out for myocardial infarction as a marker of generalized atherosclerotic disease and for stroke risk factors. The cumulative incidence of ischemic stroke was significantly less in the patients with Parkinson's disease than in the controls, as was the cumulative incidence of myocardial infarction. Among risk factors, significantly fewer patients with Parkinson's disease used tobacco than controls. The decreased incidence of ischemic stroke in the patients with Parkinson's disease appears to be related to their less severe generalized atherosclerosis, possibly due to their lower incidence of tobacco use. In view of the known potential for dopamine to exacerbate experimental ischemic tissue damage, the possibility that the dopamine deficiency in the central nervous system of persons with Parkinson's disease confers an additional specific protective benefit against ischemic stroke cannot be excluded and requires further study. 
4	Treatment of patients with aortic dissection presenting with peripheral vascular complications. The incidence of peripheral vascular complications in 272 patients with aortic dissection during a 25-year span was determined, as was outcome after a uniform, aggressive surgical approach directed at repair of the thoracic aorta. One hundred twenty-eight patients (47%) presented with acute type A dissection, 70 (26%) with chronic type A, 40 (15%) with acute type B, and 34 (12%) with chronic type B dissections. Eighty-five patients (31%) sustained one or more peripheral vascular complications: Seven (3%) had a stroke, nine (3%) had paraplegia, 66 (24%) sustained loss of a peripheral pulse, 22 (8%) had impaired renal perfusion, and 14 patients (5%) had compromised visceral perfusion. Following repair of the thoracic aorta, local peripheral vascular procedures were unnecessary in 92% of patients who presented with absence of a peripheral pulse. The operative mortality rate for all patients was 25% +/- 3% (68 of 272 patients). For the subsets of individuals with paraplegia, loss of renal perfusion, and compromised visceral perfusion, the operative mortality rates (+/- 70% confidence limits) were high: 44% +/- 17% (4 of 9 patients), 50% +/- 11% (11 of 22 patients), and 43% +/- 14% (6 of 14 patients), respectively. The mortality rates were lower for patients presenting with stroke (14% +/- 14% [1 of 7 patients]) or loss of peripheral pulse (27% +/- 6% [18 of 66 patients]). Multivariate analysis revealed that impaired renal perfusion was the only peripheral vascular complication that was a significant independent predictor of increased operative mortality risk (p = 0.024); earlier surgical referral (replacement of the appropriate section of the thoracic aorta) or more expeditious diagnosis followed by surgical renal artery revascularization after a thoracic procedure may represent the only way to improve outcome in this high-risk patient subset. Early, aggressive thoracic aortic repair (followed by aortic fenestration and/or abdominal exploration with or without direct visceral or renal vascular reconstruction when necessary) can save some patients with compromised visceral perfusion; however, once visceral infarction develops the prognosis is also poor. Increased awareness of these devastating complications of aortic dissection and the availability of better diagnostic tools today may improve the survival rate for these patients in the future. The initial surgical procedure should include repair of the thoracic aorta in most patients. 
5	Wasting and macrophage production of tumor necrosis factor/cachectin and interleukin 1 in experimental visceral leishmaniasis. Wasting and secretion of the catabolic cytokines tumor necrosis factor (TNF)/cachectin and interleukin 1 (IL-1) were assessed in weanling Syrian hamsters infected with Leishmania donovani amastigotes. Whereas the mean weight of uninfected animals increased progressively over 9 weeks, the mean weight of infected animals plateaued at 4-6 weeks and then decreased progressively until death. Splenic mononuclear cells from control hamsters produced 11.3 +/- 8.3 (SD) ng TNF/10(6) mononuclear cells/24 hr. TNF secretion in infected animals was greater than the mean +/- 2 SD of controls in 1 of 3 hamsters at 2 weeks post-infection and in 8 of 9 hamsters at weeks 4-8. The mean TNF secreted by infected animals studied at weeks 4-8 was 371 (range 28-800) ng TNF/10(6) mononuclear cells/24 hr (P = 0.005). Control hamsters produced 7.7 +/- 2.7 pg IL-1/10(6) mononuclear cells/24 hr. At 2 weeks, mononuclear cells from 2 of 3 infected animals secreted amounts of IL-1 greater than the mean +/- 2 SD of controls. All of 8 infected hamsters secreted increased amounts of IL-1 at 4-8 weeks. The mean was 164 (range 17-370) pg IL-1/10(6) mononuclear cells/24 hr (P = 0.002). In comparison to infected animals, mononuclear cells from control hamsters incubated with lipopolysaccharide, 10 micrograms/ml, produced 172.5 ng TNF and 44.6 pg of IL-1/10(6) mononuclear cells/24 hr. The effect of visceral leishmaniasis on food intake was assessed in a separate group of animals housed individually in metabolic cages. Significant reductions in weight and food intake were first observed at 2 and 3 weeks of infection, respectively. By 5 weeks, the food intake of infected animals was 46% that of controls. Syrian hamsters infected with L. donovani provide an excellent model with which to study the mechanism of wasting. 
4	The effect on skin blood flow of short-term venous hypertension in normal subjects. Plugging of skin capillaries by activated white blood cells is one of the proposed mechanisms by which skin damage may be initiated in chronic venous insufficiency. The aim of this study was to determine whether a microcirculatory deficit was induced in the skin by raising the venous pressure proximally for thirty minutes. Seventeen subjects with no evidence of venous or arterial disease had laser Doppler velocimetry performed in the goiter region of the leg; 8 different subjects had the measurement done on the dorsum of the hand. Peak hyperemic response following three minutes of ischemia was measured before and after a thirty-minute period of sustained venous hypertension applied by a proximal tourniquet inflated to 80 mm Hg. A decrease in the peak flow: baseline flow ratio (median ratio 2.25 before, 1.70 after, p less than 0.02) and an increase in the time taken to reach maximal hyperemia (median time ten seconds before, twenty seconds after, p less than 0.01) were observed after the period of venous hypertension in the lower limb. The second parameter, but not the first, was significantly affected in the upper limb. The authors conclude that a microvascular deficit in the skin is demonstrable after a short period of venous hypertension. This is consistent with the white-cell-trapping theory, but other possible explanations are discussed. 
5	Attenuation of suxamethonium myalgias. Effect of midazolam and vecuronium. We studied the incidence of fasciculations and postoperative myalgias in 100 female outpatients who had laparoscopy under thiopentone, N2O, isoflurane anaesthesia. Four groups of 20 patients each were pretreated with saline (group 1), tubocurarine 0.05 mg/kg (group 2), vecuronium 0.006 mg/kg (group 3), or midazolam 0.025 mg/kg (group 4), followed by suxamethonium 1.5 mg/kg. Group 5 received only vecuronium 0.1 mg/kg as relaxant (no suxamethonium). Fasciculations were graded, and postoperative myalgias rated on the first and third postoperative days. In groups 1-5 the incidence of fasciculations was 95, 15, 25, 95 and 0%; the incidence of myalgias on the first day after operation was 70, 45, 65, 75 and 60%, and on the third day after operation 20, 5, 20, 20, and 5%, respectively. We conclude that pretreatment with vecuronium, but not midazolam, decreases the incidence of fasciculations after suxamethonium (p less than 0.05) and that in this patient population, postoperative myalgias appear to be unrelated to the use of suxamethonium. 
3	Secondary deposition of beta amyloid within extracellular neurofibrillary tangles in Alzheimer-type dementia. The hippocampal areas of 34 autopsy specimen brains from aged demented and nondemented subjects were examined using double staining of Bodian and beta protein. In 18 cases (75.5 +/- 7.4 years old), none of the extracellular neurofibrillary tangles (E-NFTs) were immunoreactive with beta protein. In 16 cases (82.9 +/- 5.4 years old), the minority of E-NFTs were immunoreactive with beta-protein antiserum. These beta-immunoreactive E-NFTs frequently appeared in the areas having senile plaques, while they were not observed in the area lacking beta-immunoreactive senile plaques. The ultrastructure of beta-immunoreactive E-NFTs revealed that they consisted of extracellular amyloid fibrils, extracellularly located bundles of paired helical filaments, astroglial processes and degenerating neurites. These findings suggest that the beta immunoreactivity of E-NFTs comes from secondary deposition of amyloid fibrils. 
4	Survival rates from out-of-hospital cardiac arrest: recommendations for uniform definitions and data to report. Survival rates for out-of-hospital cardiac arrest vary widely among locations. We surveyed the definitions used in published studies of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest. Data from 74 studies involving 36 communities showed survival rates ranging from 2% to 44%. There were five different case definitions and 11 different definitions of survivors. The absence of uniform definitions prevents meaningful intersystem comparisons, prohibits explorations of hypotheses about effective interventions, and interferes with the efforts of quality assurance. The most satisfactory numerator for a survival rate appears to be survival to hospital discharge; the most appropriate denominator appears to be witnessed adult cardiac arrest of presumed heart disease etiology, with ventricular fibrillation as the initial identified rhythm. Proposed definitions for the data emergency medical services systems should report as they examine their cardiac arrest survival rates are presented. 
2	Isolation and characterization of cDNA encoding a human nuclear antigen predominantly recognized by autoantibodies from patients with primary biliary cirrhosis. Autoantibodies to a novel nuclear Ag, Sp100, have recently been described that recognize a nuclear protein with an apparent molecular mass of 95 to 100 kDa and a dot-like distribution within cell nuclei. By immunoscreening of a lambda gt11 cDNA expression library derived from HeLa cells with an anti-Sp100 autoimmune serum a 0.7-kb cDNA (Sp26) coding for a fragment of Sp100 was isolated. Expression of this cDNA and use of the recombinant protein in ELISA revealed that the fragment carries major Sp100 autoepitopes and that anti-Sp100 autoantibodies predominantly occur in patients suffering from primary biliary cirrhosis (50/184). The Sp26 cDNA was used as hybridization probe for isolation of longer cDNA from human liver- and placenta-derived lambda gt10 cDNA libraries. Overlapping fragments were assembled to generate a full length cDNA coding for a protein with a molecular mass of 53 kDa and an isoelectric point of 4.7. The Sp100 autoantigen expressed in vitro from this cDNA and authenticated by a capture immunoblot assay, comigrated in SDS-PAGE with the authentic HeLa autoantigen of 95 to 100 kDa and thus showed an aberrant electrophoretic mobility. Computer based protein sequence analysis of the Sp100 autoantigen revealed regions of striking sequence similarities to the alpha 1 and alpha 2 domains of various human and non-human MHC class I Ag and to several transacting transcriptional regulatory proteins. 
3	Arterial responses during migraine headache. The superficial temporal artery has been thought to be the main focus of pain during migraine attacks, but its diameter has never been measured directly. The use of a new, high-resolution ultrasound machine to measure arterial size in 25 migraine patients with unilateral head pain showed that the lumen was wider on the painful than on the non-painful side during a migraine attack. The diameters of both radial arteries and the temporal artery on the non-painful side were smaller during than between attacks. The generalised vasoconstriction was not shared by the temporal artery on the affected side, which suggests a local vasodilatory response. The findings suggest that cephalic arteries may play a role in migraine pathogenesis. 
5	A placebo-controlled trial of maintenance therapy with fluconazole after treatment of cryptococcal meningitis in the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome. California Collaborative Treatment Group. BACKGROUND AND METHODS. In patients with the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS), the rate of relapse after primary treatment for cryptococcal meningitis remains high. We conducted a controlled, double-blind trial to evaluate the efficacy of maintenance therapy with fluconazole. At entry into the study, all participants had sterile cultures of cerebrospinal fluid, blood, and urine after following a standardized course of therapy for culture-proved cryptococcal meningitis. The patients were randomly assigned to take either fluconazole or placebo as maintenance therapy. The dose of fluconazole was 100 mg daily in the first phase of study and 200 mg daily in the second phase. RESULTS. Of 84 patients initially enrolled, 16 (19 percent) were found to have silent, persistent infection on the basis of cultures that became positive after entry into the study; 7 other patients were lost to follow-up shortly after entry. Of the remaining 61 patients, 10 of 27 assigned to placebo (37 percent) and 1 of 34 assigned to fluconazole (3 percent) had a recurrence of cryptococcal infection at any site (difference in risk, 34 percent; 95 percent confidence interval, 15 to 53). Of the 11 recurrent infections, 7 were detected in urine obtained after prostatic massage. There were four recurrent meningeal infections in the patients taking placebo, but none in those taking fluconazole (mean duration of follow-up, 164 days) (P = 0.03). In multivariate analyses, the best predictors of recurrence-free survival were fluconazole treatment (P = 0.02; relative hazard, 13.2), a lower serum cryptococcal-antigen titer (P = 0.05; relative hazard, 1.2), and more prolonged primary therapy with flucytosine (P = 0.09; relative hazard, 1.1). Survival and toxicity were similar in the two maintenance-treatment groups. CONCLUSIONS. In patients with AIDS, silent persistent infection is common after clinically successful treatment for cryptococcal meningitis. Maintenance therapy with fluconazole is highly effective in preventing recurrent cryptococcal infection. 
5	Combined epidural and general anesthesia in aortic surgery. The perioperative course of 144 consecutive patients undergoing aortic reconstructive surgery was studied to assess the potential benefit of employing a combined epidural and light general anesthesia technique. A group of 67 patients had general anesthesia alone (GA), while in the group of 77 remaining patients, a combined epidural and general anesthesia (Epi-GA) was employed. The two groups were similar in regards to age, medical risk factors, preoperative assessment of cardiac and pulmonary function, and type of surgical reconstruction. There was no significant difference in the anesthetic, operative time, or operative fluid requirements between the two groups. There was a lower rate pressure product in the Epi-GA group during aortic cross clamping (P less than 0.05). More patients in the GA group required a prolonged ventilatory support (P less than 0.05) and a high parenteral narcotic administration (P less than 0.025) during the first 48 hours. While the mortality rate was similar for the two groups (3.0% for GA group vs 5.2% for Epi-GA group), there was a higher percent of postoperative pulmonary complications observed in the GA group (7.6%) compared to the Epi-GA group (2.6%). By facilitating early extubation and a decreased need for systemic narcotics in the early postoperative period, Epi-GA may be beneficial in the high risk pulmonary patient undergoing aortic reconstruction. 
1	Calcium transport by plasma membranes from a glucose-responsive rat insulinoma. Inside-out plasma membrane vesicles from a glucose-responsive rat insulinoma showed an ATP- and Mg2(+)-dependent uptake of Ca2+. The Km (concentration giving half-maximal activity) for Ca2+ was 60 nM. In the presence of 0.4 microM free Ca2+, the Km for ATP was 15 microM, and the Km for Mg2+ was 4 microM. Glucose (30 mM) decreased Ca2+ uptake by 50%, while other insulin secretagogues had no effect, except for glyceraldehyde, which stimulated Ca2+ uptake. Calmodulin increased the uptake of Ca2+, while trifluoperazine and vanadate inhibited the uptake. The Ca2(+)- and Mg2(+)-dependent ATPase from this tumor has a 10- to 20-fold higher requirement for Ca2+, which suggests that this enzyme is not responsible for Ca2+ transport, rather, Ca2+ transport activity represents only a small fraction of the total Ca2(+)-ATPase activity. The physiological importance of Ca2+ transport in insulin secretion is evident from the inhibition of Ca2+ uptake by glucose, which leads to a decrease in Ca2+ efflux from the cell. This inhibition would lead to an increase in intracellular free Ca2+ and insulin release. 
5	Estimating and testing an index of responsiveness and the relationship of the index to power. Responsiveness has been proposed as a criterion, in addition to reliability and validity, to evaluate instruments that measure quality of life or functional status. The responsiveness index measures the change in a quality of life score due to a treatment relative to the variability of changes in that score within a stable control group. We derive the expected value, variance and distribution of the responsiveness index and give a large sample distribution for comparing the responsiveness of two different instruments. We also give the relationship between the responsiveness index and the power of a test of treatment effect. 
5	Does ethamsylate reduce haemorrhage in transurethral prostatectomy? A double-blind, randomised trial of 44 consecutive patients undergoing transurethral prostatectomy demonstrated that ethamsylate (Dicynene) did not reduce blood loss during either the operative or the post- operative periods. 
2	Endoscopy versus x-ray studies of the gastrointestinal tract: future health care implications. I did esophagogastroduodenoscopy in 147 patients and colonoscopy in 59 patients who had had gastrointestinal x-ray studies. The endoscopic procedure was done within 7 days after the x-ray study and/or while the patient was still symptomatic. The barium swallow findings were confirmed in only 40%; in the other 60%, the x-ray findings could not be confirmed. These unconfirmed x-ray findings were false-positive in 37.4%, false-negative in 16.3%, and suboptimal or nondiagnostic in 6.2%. The barium enema findings were confirmed in 32%. In the other 68%, the x-ray findings were false-positive in 42.3%, false-negative in 22%, and suboptimal in 3.3%. We conclude that in clinical or private practice, relying on x-ray studies alone may be associated with a high margin of diagnostic errors. When all factors are considered, the initial cost advantage of the x-ray studies appears to be lost. In future recommendations on the continuing dilemma of x-ray studies versus endoscopy, consideration should be given to factors other than the initial lower price of the x-ray studies. 
1	Primary adenocarcinoma of the temporal bone. A case with 40-year follow-up. Adenomatous tumors of the temporal bone are rare neoplasms. This article records the 40-year course of a patient with adenocarcinoma of the temporal bone and reviews the literature pertinent to the biologic behavior, histologic appearance, prognosis, and treatment of this group of tumors. 
4	Adverse mortality experience of a southwestern American Indian community: overall death rates and underlying causes of death in Pima Indians. As part of an ongoing epidemiologic study, the death rate and causes of death during 1975 through 1984 were determined in Pima Indians who resided in the Gila River Indian Community (GRIC) in 1965 and later. Death certificates were available for 677 of the 681 deaths. In 78% of the deaths, the underlying cause recorded on the death certificate agreed with the cause determined after review of all available relevant records. The age- and sex-adjusted average annual death rate for the GRIC population (1639/100,000) was 1.9 times (95% CI 1.7-2.0) the 1980 rate for the U.S. all races (878/100,000). In Pima males, whose death rate was substantially higher than that of Pima females, the age-adjusted death rate was 2.3 times that in U.S. males, all races. Moreover among males 25-34 years of age, the Pima death rate was 6.6 times that for the U.S. all races. Diseases of the heart and malignant neoplasms caused 59% of U.S. deaths in 1980, but only 19% of GRIC deaths. By contrast, the age- and sex-adjusted mortality rate in the GRIC Pima was 5.9 times the rate of the U.S. all races for accidents, 6.5 times for cirrhosis, 7.4 times for homicide, 4.3 times for suicide, and 11.9 times for diabetes. Tuberculosis and coccidioidomycosis were important causes of death in the Pima, for whom infectious diseases was the tenth leading cause of death. The findings indicate that programs to improve the adverse mortality experience of the GRIC population should emphasize factors related to fatal accidents, alcoholic cirrhosis, homicide, suicide, diabetes mellitus, and infectious diseases. Young Pimas, especially the males, should be the primary focus of such preventive efforts. These findings and recommendations probably apply to many Native American populations. 
5	Postpartum amaurosis. Blindness is a rare but dramatic complication of pregnancy and delivery. We present the case of a patient who developed toxemia at the time of delivery that with ineffective treatment resulted in cortical blindness without seizure activity. The pathogenesis as well as the diagnostic workup and treatment of this unusual complication are discussed. 
5	Effects of neuro-developmental treatment and orthoses on knee flexion during gait: a single-subject design. The interactive effects of neuro-developmental treatment and inhibitive ankle-height orthoses on gait were examined via a single-subject research design. Knee flexion during gait at initial contact, mid-stance, heel-off, and mid-swing were measured in a 2-year-old girl with diplegia by use of a goniometer and freeze-frame videography. During the treatment and treatment/orthoses phases, a decrease in excessive knee flexion was noted. Changes in trend over time were greater in the 3-week treatment phase than in the 3-week treatment/orthoses phase. Changes in level at the initiation of the treatment/orthoses phase were greater than in the treatment phase. The described neuro-developmental treatment activities were conducted correctly 92% of the time according to an independent observer. The interrater reliability of goniometric data measured by videography was .93 using intraclass correlation coefficients. The results of this study suggest that both methods of treatment can be used to decrease excessive knee flexion during gait in a child with diplegia. 
5	Primary carcinoma of the gallbladder. Seventy-four patients with primary carcinoma of the gallbladder, diagnosed over 18 years from 1969 to 1987, were studied retrospectively. The most common presenting complaint was abdominal pain, followed by jaundice and weight loss. Surgery was performed in 61 patients and of these patients, only two had accurate preoperative diagnosis which was made by ultrasonography. Twelve of the 13 patients who were treated medically had the disease diagnosed at autopsy. One of the 13 patients had the diagnosis of gallbladder cancer by the findings of ultrasonography and abdominal computed tomography (CT) scanning. The resectability of the surgically managed group was 36.1%, and the majority of patients with advanced tumors (82.2%) were deemed unresectable. The most common histologic type was adenocarcinoma. Liver was the organ most commonly invaded (76.5%) by direct extension and/or metastases, followed by regional lymph nodes (52.9%). The overall 5-year survival rate was 5.4%. A high index of suspicion of the disease, intraoperative examination of gallbladder specimen, and earlier, more aggressive surgical treatment may improve patient survival. 
3	A practical approach to the painful bladder syndrome. The painful bladder syndrome (PBS) is a progressive and painful disease of the bladder that may lead to fibrosis, contracture and reduction of bladder capacity. The usual symptoms are urinary urgency, frequency, nocturia, chronic pelvic pain and lower abdominal pain upon filling of the bladder. A retrospective analysis was performed on 21 women with PBS between March 1987 and March 1988. The patients were treated weekly with a bladder pillar block, bladder distention and dimethyl sulfoxide instillation. Symptomatic relief was observed in 80% of the patients so treated. The maximum bladder volume increased from 185 to 475 mL (P less than .01). The side effects were minimal. 
5	Electroencephalographic activity related to palatal myoclonus in REM sleep. Polysomnography, including electroencephalography, electromyography and electro-oculography was performed in three patients with palatal myoclonus (PM). The amplitude of the myoclonus decreased during sleep. The frequency did not change during non-REM sleep, but increased during REM sleep in two patients. Ocular myoclonus synchronized with PM disappeared during deep sleep stages in two patients and reappeared during REM sleep in one of them. In the other patient, ocular myoclonus was noted only in REM sleep, being absent even when the patient was awake. All patients showed episodic EEG activities synchronous with myoclonic jerks only in REM sleep. These episodes were noted 5-15 times throughout the night, and each episode lasting for 1-7 s. They were negative or positive waves of saw-tooth appearance which were distributed predominantly in the central region. During the episodes, the frequency of myoclonic jerks increased in two patients. Although it is known that REM sleep influences PM and ocular myoclonus, this is the first report demonstrating the electroencephalographic activity associated with PM. 
3	The acutely affected abdomen in paraplegic spinal cord injury patients. The records of 145 paraplegic or quadriplegic patients were reviewed to identify those factors useful in the correct diagnosis of the acute abdomen in this population. Twenty-one patients had 22 episodes of acute or subacute abdominal problems. Presenting complaints, physical findings, and laboratory results were useful in various ways. However appropriate radiographic studies led to the correct diagnosis in 77% of patients. Although paraplegic and quadriplegic patients are predisposed to a distinct constellation of medical problems, including urinary tract infection and calculi, they also may present with other abdominal conditions that cause significant morbidity and mortality if not promptly recognized. 
3	A simple method to improve the accuracy of non-invasive ultrasound in selecting TIA patients for cerebral angiography. A prospective study is reported of the ability of B mode ultrasound imaging and continuous wave Doppler flow studies to detect different degrees of stenosis of the extracranial internal carotid artery (ICA) in 186 arteries in 99 patients with transient ischaemic attacks (TIA) and minor ischaemic stroke. A simple mathematical equation has been developed which combines the image and flow data to provide a single predictor of the degree of angiographic stenosis which has advantages over either ultrasonic modality used alone. The sensitivity and specificity of the predictive model in the detection of stenosis greater than or equal to 25% was 73% and 98%, of stenosis greater than or equal to 50% was 90% and 93%, of stenosis greater than or equal to 75%, 65% and 99% and occlusion 100% and 94% respectively. The principal clinical value of ultrasound screening is to spare patients with "non-significant" stenosis the risk of unnecessary angiography. Thus a simple measure of the Duplex screening tests' performance is the proportion of all strokes occurring as a complication of angiography that are avoided by changing the investigation policy from "angiograms for all carotid TIA and minor ischaemic stroke patients" to "angiograms for all patients with abnormal ultrasound results". If Duplex scanning were used to select patients most likely to have a significant abnormality on angiography, depending on the degree of stenosis to be detected, 52-85% of angiographic strokes might be avoided. If the predictive equation were used 62-88% of angiographic strokes might be avoided. 
1	Liver transplantation for hepatoblastoma. The American experience. The current role of liver transplantation in treating malignant tumors of the liver is uncertain, except for select histologic types. Pooled data on the results of liver transplantation in 12 children with hepatoblastoma is presented here. One half of the children are alive 24 to 70 (44 +/- 19) months after transplantation with no evidence of recurrence. Three patients (25%) died of tumor recurrence and three (25%) died of other causes. Unifocal and intrahepatic tumors were associated with better prognosis compared to the multifocal tumors and tumors with extrahepatic spread (p = 0.04 and 0.13). Microscopically vascular invasion and the predominance of embryonal and/or anaplastic epithelium were associated with a poor prognosis compared to the tumors with no vascular invasion and with predominantly fetal epithelium (p = 0.08 and 0.1). It is concluded that continued efforts to treat unresectable hepatoblastomas by liver transplantation is justified and the role of adjuvant chemotherapy in improving the results needs to be better defined. 
3	The effect of improved cementing techniques on component loosening in total hip replacement. An 11-year radiographic review. Improved cementing techniques have been shown to decrease the rate of aseptic loosening of femoral components of cemented total hip replacements at five to seven years. We now report our results in 105 hips in 93 patients at 10 to 12.7 years (mean 11.2). The improved techniques included use of a medullary plug, a cement gun, a doughy mix of Simplex P and a collared stem of chrome cobalt. Only three femoral components had definitely loosened, none were probably loose and 24 were graded as possibly loose. In contrast, the incidence of radiographic loosening on the acetabular side was 42%. Improved cementing techniques have produced a marked reduction in the rate of aseptic loosening of the femoral component, but the incidence of acetabular loosening is unchanged. 
5	Pharyngeal volume in asymptomatic snorers compared with nonsnoring volunteers. STUDY OBJECTIVE: to determine if asymptomatic snorers have smaller pharyngeal volumes than age- and height-matched nonsnorers. DESIGN: we recruited asymptomatic heavy snorers and nonsnorers for a study. Each snorer was matched by age (+/- 3 years) and height (+/- 2 inches) with a nonsnorer. The nonsnorers were required to be near ideal body weight. All volunteers underwent overnight polysomnography, pulmonary function testing, and magnetic resonance imaging of the pharynx while awake. The volume of the pharynx was determined by a computer with data input from a digitizing instrument. SETTING: Veterans Administration Hospital and University of Florida Teaching Hospital PARTICIPANTS: Nine volunteers were recruited for both the snorer and nonsnorer groups. Each participant was paid $50. There were no interventions. MEASUREMENTS and RESULTS: There were no differences in sleep variables between the two groups. There was also no significant difference between pharyngeal volumes for the two groups. CONCLUSIONS: The volume of the pharynx in asymptomatic snorers is similar to the volume in age- and height-matched nonsnorers. 
5	Does carotid restenosis predict an increased risk of late symptoms, stroke, or death? The identification of carotid restenosis as an unexpected late complication of carotid endarterectomy has prompted concerns regarding its importance as a source of new cerebral symptoms, stroke, and death. To investigate these concerns, we analyzed a consecutive series of 507 patients undergoing 566 carotid endarterectomies, each documented as technically satisfactory. Post-operative duplex Doppler examination data at 3 days, 1, 3, 6, 12 months, and annually thereafter in 484 arteries (85.5%) permitted classification of these arteries according to the most severe degree of postoperative stenosis: normal (n = 306); 1% to 19% (n = 89); 20% to 50% (n = 40); more than 50% (n = 49, including 8 occluded). The incidence of more than 50% restenosis was 14.5% in female and 7.7% in male patients (p = 0.003). Life table analyses to 10 years revealed a significantly greater life expectancy among those with restenosis (p = 0.05). Stroke was also less likely in patients with restenosis, although this difference did not reach statistical significance. When survival and stroke were both endpoints, the likelihood of patients with more than 50% restenosis remaining alive and stroke free was also greater than the less than 20% stenotic group (p = 0.03). Thus patients with carotid restenosis were less likely than patients with normal postoperative scans to have late symptoms, stroke, or early death. 
2	Zollinger-Ellison syndrome. Relation to Helicobacter pylori-associated chronic gastritis and gastric acid secretion. Since Helicobacter pylori infects the gastric mucosa in most patients with chronic duodenal ulcer, infection with this organism has been implicated in the pathogenesis of this common disease. We postulated that if H. pylori is pathogenic in the usual type of duodenal ulcer, it should be less common when duodenal ulcer has another, specific etiology, such as Zollinger-Ellison syndrome. Gastric mucosa was compared from 18 patients with proven Zollinger-Ellison syndrome (17 of whom had had duodenal ulcer disease) and 18 controls with chronic duodenal ulcer without such a diagnosis. All subjects, who were matched for age and sex, had undergone elective gastric resections. Gastric tissues were stained by hematoxylin-eosin and Giemsa and were reviewed by an experienced pathologist who was unaware of the diagnosis. The frequency of H. pylori in patients with Zollinger-Ellison syndrome (8/18) was lower than in controls with duodenal ulcer (16/18; P less than 0.02). Moreover, chronic antral gastritis scores were higher in patients with duodenal ulcer (P less than 0.01). In Zollinger-Ellison syndrome, peak acid output was lower in patients positive (median 22 meq/30 min) compared to those negative for H. pylori (median 32 meq/30 min; P less than 0.02) but serum gastrin was correspondingly lower in patients positive for H. pylori (P less than 0.05). H. pylori infection appears to be more frequent when duodenal ulceration is not associated with another etiology, such as acid hypersecretion in Zollinger-Ellison syndrome. H. pylori infection in Zollinger-Ellison syndrome may also be associated with decreased gastric acid secretion. 
3	Photosensitive epilepsies and photoconvulsive responses in Arabs. The occurrence of photosensitivity (PS) was examined in 327 Arabs greater than or equal to 15 years of age with epilepsy by intermittent photic stimulation (IPS). A control group of 192 nonepileptic Arabs greater than or equal to 15 years of age were also examined by IPS. Of the epileptic patients, 24 (7.3%) were photosensitive, an incidence comparable to that in whites in contradistinction to the reported rarity among African blacks. This finding indicates that environmental factors, particularly excessive sunshine, does not appear to influence the occurrence of PS among epileptic patients. The occurrence of PS among epileptic patients may depend more strongly on the presence of an epileptic syndrome known to have association with PS. 
3	Electroencephalographic parameters in assessing the cognitive function of children with epilepsy. Many biological and psychological possibilities have to be considered when attempting to explain cognitive dysfunction in the individual child with epilepsy. Electroencephalographic (EEG) information, which may be particularly relevant in some children, has mainly been studied in relation to the possible direct effects of seizure discharges on learning and behavior. Such discharges can be divided into transient, brief or prolonged. Prolonged seizure discharges includes nonconvulsive status epilepticus during wakefulness and status epilepticus during slow-wave sleep. In addition to the influence of seizure discharges, preliminary findings suggest that some children with epilepsy might have a subtle disorder of arousal mechanisms in sleep, possibly associated with impaired daytime performance. 
1	Thermally induced 'nicotine' stomatitis. A case report. A palatal lesion resembling "nicotine" stomatitis was found in a woman who did not smoke. However, the patient frequently drank extremely hot beverages. After she was instructed to reduce the temperature of the beverages, the lesion almost completely resolved. This suggests that heat was the primary cause of this lesion and also implicates heat as the major cause of nicotine stomatitis. 
5	Ocular complications of rheumatic diseases of childhood. The association between inflammatory ocular and articular disease is a strong one, although the pathogenesis of this relationship is obscure. For the physician or surgeon caring for children with chronic arthritis, awareness of the risk of chronic asymptomatic anterior uveitis is essential if early diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of visual impairment are to be accomplished. This is particularly true for children with pauciarticular-onset juvenile rheumatoid arthritis or psoriatic arthritis. Acute symptomatic anterior uveitis is characteristic of disorders such as ankylosing spondylitis. Whereas this disease is initially more unpleasant for the child, it has a good long-term prognosis. 
3	Neuroophthalmologic effects of intravenous magnesium sulfate. To test the hypothesis that visual disturbances are more common during intravenous magnesium sulfate administration than at 1 to 4 days after discontinuation of the drug, 13 women underwent bedside neuroophthalmologic examinations during intravenous magnesium sulfate tocolysis at 2.0 to 3.0 gm hr and again at 1 to 4 days after cessation of therapy. Visual symptoms were common during intravenous magnesium sulfate administration. Blurred vision was present in 12 of 13 patients and diplopia was present in 10 of 13 patients. Abnormal findings during neuroophthalmologic examination occurred in all patients during intravenous magnesium sulfate administration. Findings included ptosis, accommodative and convergence insufficiency, and abnormal pupillary responsiveness to light and near. All patients were symptom-free and had normal examinations after magnesium sulfate was discontinued. These findings suggest that visual disturbances with therapeutic magnesium sulfate are common. 
4	Multicenter trial of L-carnitine in maintenance hemodialysis patients. II. Clinical and biochemical effects. Since carnitine deficiency has been reported in some patients undergoing maintenance hemodialysis, we studied the effects of intravenous infusion of L-carnitine or placebo at the end of each dialysis treatment. The trial, which lasted seven months (one month baseline, 6 months treatment) was multicenter, double blind, placebo controlled, and randomized. Eighty-two long-term hemodialysis patients, who were given either carnitine (N = 38) or placebo (N = 44), completed this study. In each group, clinical and biochemical parameters during treatment were compared with baseline values. Intra-dialytic hypotension and muscle cramps were reduced only in the carnitine treated group, while improvement in post-dialysis asthenia was noticed in both carnitine and placebo groups. Maximal oxygen consumption, measured during a progressive work exercise test, improved significantly in the carnitine group (111 +/- 50 ml/min. P less than 0.03) and was unchanged in the placebo group. L-carnitine treatment was associated with a significant drop in pre-dialysis concentrations of serum urea nitrogen, creatinine and phosphorus (means +/- SEM, 101 +/- 4.5 to 84 +/- 3.9, 16.7 +/- 0.67 to 14.7 +/- 0.64, and 6.4 +/- 0.3 to 5.5 +/- 0.4 mg/dl, respectively, P less than 0.004). No significant changes in any of these variables were noticed in the placebo group. Mid-arm circumference and triceps skinfold thickness were measured in 11 carnitine and 13 placebo treated patients. Calculated mid-arm muscle area increased in the carnitine patients (41.37 +/- 2.68 to 45.6 +/- 2.82 cm2, P = 0.05) and remained unchanged in the placebo patients. 
5	Orthopedic complications. Compartment syndrome, fat embolism syndrome, and venous thromboembolism. Specialized education in the care of orthopedic patients includes an understanding of the common complications for which patients require monitoring. With a socioeconomic backdrop of decreasing hospital stays and prospective payment, patient care must be managed proactively. For all three complications presented, there are unique sets of risk factors that, when present, contribute to a high index of suspicion for morbidity. Clusters of symptoms have also been discussed representing the expected normal patterns. With this knowledge as a foundation, clinical application is essential to incorporate other salient aspects of individual situations. Nurses diagnose and treat human responses to health problems. The end result of human responses to injury or orthopedic conditions can be the development of complications. Stringent adherence to patient monitoring protocols can promote timely nursing interventions to prevent, minimize, or detect complications or treatment side effects. Although definitive treatment is often physician directed, nurses are in a key role to impact final patient outcomes. 
5	Aminoglycosides: assessing the potential for nephrotoxicity. Although aminoglycosides have been a mainstay of antibiotic therapy in postsurgical infections, certain patients may be at risk for potential aminoglycoside induced toxicities. Aminoglycoside nephrotoxicity is one of the most frequent causes of iatrogenic renal failure. A narrow toxicity to therapeutic ratio, a relatively long serum half-life and concentration in the renal cortex all contribute to renal dysfunction. Patients at greatest risk for aminoglycoside-induced nephrotoxicity include the elderly, patients with pre-existing renal disease and those who are volume depleted. Calculations based on the results of a multicenter study demonstrate that the average additional cost incurred for each patient who had aminoglycoside-related nephrotoxicity was $2,501. Methods are reviewed for prospectively assessing the potential for development of nephrotoxicity to identify patients for whom effective therapeutic substitutes for aminoglycosides should be sought. 
5	Cervical muscle myoelectric response to acute experimental sternocleidomastoid pain. A method is presented for investigating the response of passive and active muscle to experimentally induced deep muscle pain. Ten healthy adult males performed multiple, submaximal isometric neck flexion tasks before and after pain had been induced in the sternocleidomastoid (SCM) muscle by injecting 5 ml of a hypertonic (5%) saline solution. A similar volume of isotonic saline was injected into the contralateral muscle as a control. Cervical myoelectric signal (MES) root-mean-square (RMS) response to each injection was recorded from eight neck muscles over 8 minutes. The subject rated perceived pain at regular intervals using a visual analog scale (VAS). Sternocleidomastoid pain, which reached a mean of 36 mm on the 100-mm VAS 2 minutes after the injection, resulted in significantly increased (1-2 microV, P less than 0.05) RMS MES in the otherwise relaxed SCM muscle during the first 2 minutes. This was followed by a gradual return to control values after 5 minutes. A similar trend in MES was found for the active SCM muscle during a 10% maximum voluntary contraction (MVC) isometric neck flexion effort. Thus, acute deep muscle pain caused subtle, yet systematic, changes in motor output in both the relaxed and active painful muscle, and its synergists and antagonists. 
2	Esophageal inflammation and stricture: complication of chronic granulomatous disease of childhood. Esophagitis in children with immunodeficiency is most commonly due to opportunistic infection. The authors describe three patients with chronic granulomatous disease (CGD) of childhood who developed esophageal strictures that were believed to be complications of the primary disease. At radiologic examination, all three patients initially had a focal narrowing of the upper thoracic esophagus. Endoscopy showed no signs of opportunistic infection or Barrett esophagus. Biopsy of the strictures in two patients revealed findings consistent with CGD. In two of the three patients, inflammation extended to involve the middle and distal esophagus. Long-term response to balloon dilation was poor in the first two patients. The third patient was lost to follow-up after a partial clinical and radiographic response to dilation. 
1	Congenital midline nasal masses: diagnosis and management. Congenital midline nasal masses (CMNMs) are rare lesions most commonly caused by dermoids, hemangiomas, nasal gliomas or encephaloceles. We report a case of nasal glioma and discuss the embryologic development, evaluation, and management of such CMNMs. 
4	Branch retinal vein occlusion: the pathogenetic role of blood viscosity. The pathogenesis of branch retinal vein occlusion has not been completely clarified. The role of abnormal blood viscosity in the appearance and evolution of the disease has recently been advocated. We studied 54 patients with long-standing branch retinal vein occlusion from a hemorrheologic point of view. Depending on the extension of retinal ischemia, two subgroups were identified. Hematocrit, blood and plasma viscosity, whole blood filterability, cell deformability, and fibrinogen levels were investigated. Thirty-five subjects of similar age, sex, and risk factors of diabetes and hypertension served as controls. Our results showed that blood viscosity is higher in patients with occlusion and particularly in those with severe retinal ischemia. Statistical analysis showed a direct correlation between blood viscosity and hematocrit. 
3	Neuromuscular disease of the gastrointestinal tract. Gastrointestinal motility is the function of gastrointestinal smooth muscle. It is controlled by both the intrinsic and extrinsic nerves of the gastrointestinal tract and, to a lesser degree, the gastrointestinal hormones. Therefore, any abnormality of the above factors, theoretically, can cause gastrointestinal dysmotility. In a clinical situation, commonly seen is gastrointestinal dysmotility caused by either smooth muscle or intrinsic and extrinsic nerves dysfunction. Diseases that cause smooth muscle dysfunction include familial visceral myopathies, nonfamilial visceral myopathies, collagen disease, muscular dystrophies, amyloidosis, thyroid disease, and so on. Diseases that cause enteric nerve dysfunction include familial visceral neuropathies, nonfamilial visceral neuropathies, diabetes mellitus, Chagas' disease, ganglioneuromatosis of the intestine, visceral neuropathy of carcinomatosis, Parkinson's disease, and so on. The patients with neuromuscular disease of the gastrointestinal tract have a wide range of clinical manifestations regardless of the underlying cause. At one end of the spectrum, the patients may be asymptomatic, and at the other end of the spectrum, the patients may have functional obstruction of the gastrointestinal tract. Plain abdominal x-rays, upper gastrointestinal (UGI) and small bowel x-rays, enteroclysis, barium enema, and manometric studies are useful for the work-up of these patients. Enteroclysis is especially helpful in ruling out mechanical obstruction of the small intestine in patients with chronic intestinal pseudo-obstruction. Treatment is mainly symptomatic and supportive. There is no effective drug to improve gastrointestinal motility. Surgery may be helpful in selected cases of severe gastrointestinal dysmotility. 
5	Cytogenetic analysis of 434 consecutively ascertained specimens of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma: clinical correlations. Cytogenetic and histopathologic data were correlated with clinical parameters from 423 patients with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL). Clinical correlations were performed on subgroups of 149 patients with low-grade lymphoma (LG) and 205 patients with diffuse lymphoma with a large cell component (DLLC). Correlations were made between clinical outcome and individual recurring cytogenetic aberrations, each of which was noted in greater than 5% of cases belonging to LG NHL and DLLC, and derived measures of karyotypic complexity, comprising modal chromosome number, number of marker chromosomes, and number of translocation breakpoints. No correlations with survival were noted in LG NHL, although median follow-up was only 2 years. Seven patients with t(8;14) LG NHL had an indolent course. Among 104 patients with DLLC and abnormal karyotypes at diagnosis, breaks at 1q21-23 or more than 4 marker chromosomes was associated with a shortened median survival. Using these variables we constructed a proportional hazards model with a good fit to observed data. Breaks at 6q21-25 predicted a decreased probability of achieving remission. Patients with DLLC and breaks at 1q21-23 or 1p32-36 had a shorter duration of complete remission. Of 41 DLLC studied at relapse, the only long-term survivors had t(14;18). 
4	Venous air embolism. Diagnosis by spontaneous right-sided contrast echocardiography. This report describes the definitive diagnosis of venous air-embolism by documentation of spontaneous echo contrast in the right cardiac chambers following removal of a jugular venous catheter in a patient with hepatic failure. This complication was potentiated by the presence of concurrent hepatic coagulopathy which prejudiced effective hemostasis at the central venous puncture site. 
4	An improved photochemical model of embolic cerebral infarction in rats. To provide further evidence that the multiple cerebral infarcts found in rats following photochemical damage to the carotid artery are caused by emboli and to eliminate the systemic hypotension and heating of the blood reported with the previous photochemical embolic stroke model (rose bengal and a green laser), I have modified the photochemical technique. Brain pathology was studied in 18 Wistar rats following carotid artery irradiation with a red laser (632 nm) at powers ranging from 100 to 800 mW/cm2 for 10 or 20 minutes following the injection of the photosensitizing dye Photofrin II. Multiple cerebral arterioles were occluded by platelet aggregates containing frequent erythrocytes and leukocytes, identical to the thrombotic material in the carotid artery but different from the platelet aggregates seen in the carotid artery and the brain in the rose bengal model. Eighty infarcts were distributed randomly throughout the brain ipsilateral to the nonocclusive carotid thrombus. Significant heating (0.5 degree C or more) of the blood occurred only with laser powers higher (1,600 mW/cm2) or laser irradiations longer (25 minutes) than those used in the improved model of embolic stroke. This model mimics one mechanism of stroke in humans and provides a means to study systematically the morphological evolution of small cerebral infarcts. 
4	The impact of right ventricular infarction on the prevalence of ventricular arrhythmias during acute inferior myocardial infarction. To determine the impact of RV infarction on the prevalence and complexity of ventricular arrhythmias during inferior AMI, 57 patients with no prior MI were studied by 24-hour Holter monitoring on the first and tenth days of AMI. Based on radionuclear studies, patients were allocated into two groups: (1) group A, 21 patients (37 percent) with normal RVEF (greater than or equal to 40 percent); and (2) group B, 36 patients (63 percent) with depressed RVEF (less than 40 percent). There were no significant differences between the groups regarding age and LVEF. Values of RVEF were 47 +/- 6 percent and 31 +/- 6 percent, respectively (p less than 0.05). The RVEF had no influence on the prevalence and complexity of early and late arrhythmias. Stratification of patients in group B into two subgroups based on the extent of RV dysfunction did not reveal any differences in the occurrence of all forms of ectopy (when both groups were matched to group A). Therefore, patients with inferior AMI, with or without RV infarction, have a similar prevalence of arrhythmias. Ventricular ectopic beats may be related to the severity and spread of LV involvement, rather than to RV dysfunction. 
1	Le Fort I osteotomy approach to the skull base. Horizontal osteotomy allows the surgeon to safely down-fracture the maxilla for wide exposure of the central skull base. This surgical approach is easily extended posteriorly in the midline to include the clivus and the arch of C1, providing 8 cm of horizontal anterior exposure and 5 cm of posterior. Wide operative exposure and a low rate of complications afford superior functional and cosmetic preservation in removing tumors of the central cranial base. 
4	Entrapment neuropathy of the median nerve at the level of the ligament of Struthers. The presence of a supracondylar process and Struthers' ligament is a rare congenital anomaly that may cause compression of either the median nerve, the brachial artery, or both. The authors present a case in which the supracondylar process and Struthers' ligament compressed both the median nerve and the brachial artery. This case is unusual, in that the symptoms of compression of the brachial artery increased--namely, the pulse intensity decreased and the pain increased with elbow flexion. 
1	Identification of a melanoma progression antigen as integrin VLA-2. The expression of the integrin receptors VLA-1, -2, -3, and -6 was studied in normal cultured melanocytes and in five melanoma cell lines. Normal melanocytes synthesized VLA-3, but did not reveal detectable levels of VLA-1, -2, and -6. All melanoma cell lines, however, expressed VLA-2, -3, and -6. VLA-1 was synthesized by two of five melanoma lines. In parallel, we had analyzed the expression of four previously characterized melanoma cell surface antigens. One of them (antigen A.1.43), which is associated with tumor progression of human melanoma, revealed a striking similarity to VLA-2. In sequential immunoprecipitation experiments, we show that A.1.43 is identical with the integrin VLA-2, a cell surface receptor for collagen, laminin, and fibronectin. 
5	Loss of heterozygosity on chromosomes 17 and 18 in breast carcinoma: two additional regions identified. The loss of heterozygosity (LOH) at specific regions of the human genome in tumor DNA is recognized as evidence for a tumor-suppressor gene located within the corresponding region of the homologous chromosome. Restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis of a panel of primary human breast tumor DNAs has led to the identification of two additional regions on chromosomes 17q and 18q that frequently are affected by LOH. Deletions of each of these regions have a significant correlation with clinical parameters that are associated with aggressive breast carcinomas. Previous restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis of this panel of tumors has uncovered several other frequently occurring mutations. LOH on chromosome 18q frequently occurs in tumors with concomitant LOH of loci on chromosomes 17p and 11p. Similarly, tumors having LOH on 17q also have LOH on chromosomes 1p and 3p. This suggests that certain combinations of mutations may collaborate in the development and malignant progression of breast carcinomas. 
4	Effect of intravenous streptokinase on early mortality in patients with suspected acute myocardial infarction. A meta-analysis by anatomic location of infarction [published erratum appears in Ann Intern Med 1991 Mar 15;114(6):522] PURPOSE: To determine the effect of intravenous streptokinase on early mortality in patients with suspected acute anterior and acute inferior myocardial infarctions. DATA IDENTIFICATION: A literature search of English-language studies on the use of intravenous streptokinase in the treatment of suspected acute myocardial infarction for the period 1966 to 1989 using Medlars II and the bibliographies of relevant articles. In a number of instances, additional details on early mortality by location of myocardial infarction were provided by the authors. STUDY SELECTION: Of 140 originally identified articles, 6 that specifically met our inclusion criteria were selected: randomized trials that used intravenous streptokinase in a dose of 1.5 million units, with or without additional agents, compared with a group that differed only by the absence of streptokinase. Trials were selected by review of the methods section without regard for the results. DATA EXTRACTION: Data were extracted independently by two observers using specific methodologic criteria for infarct location and early mortality. After they conferred, the observers agreed completely on the data. RESULTS OF DATA SYNTHESIS: Among the 9155 patients with suspected acute anterior myocardial infarction, the mortality rate in the control group was 17.4%. In contrast, patients treated with streptokinase had a 12.5% mortality. The mean risk difference was -4.8% (95% CI, -7.5% to -2.1%) and the summary risk ratio was 0.72 (CI, 0.65 to 0.79). A total of 9650 patients with suspected inferior infarction had a mortality rate in the control group of 7.6% [corrected]. The mortality for streptokinase-treated patients was 6.6%. The mean risk difference was -0.8% (CI, -1.8% to 0.2%) and the summary risk ratio was 0.87 (CI, 0.76 to 1.01). CONCLUSIONS: Intravenous streptokinase clearly confers a protective effect against early mortality in patients with suspected acute anterior myocardial infarction. The magnitude of this effect is on the order of a 5% absolute reduction in risk of death by 21 to 35 days. For these patients, 21 need to be treated to save 1 additional life. For patients with suspected acute inferior infarction, the benefit of treatment on reducing early mortality is of smaller magnitude and less certain. These patients have an estimated absolute reduction of early mortality of approximately 1%, which would require treating 125 patients to save 1 additional life. 
4	Mapping of a functional autoimmune epitope on the beta 1-adrenergic receptor in patients with idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy. The presence and properties of serum autoantibodies against beta-adrenergic receptors in patients with idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy were studied using synthetic peptides derived from the predicted sequences of the human beta-adrenergic receptors. Peptides corresponding to the sequences of the second extracellular loop of the human beta 1- and beta 2-adrenergic receptors were used as antigens in an enzyme immunoassay to screen sera from patients with dilated cardiomyopathy (n = 42), ischemic heart disease (n = 17), or healthy blood donors (n = 34). The sera of thirteen dilated cardiomyopathy patients, none of the ischemic heart disease patients, and four of the healthy controls monospecifically recognized the beta 1-peptide. Only affinity-purified antibodies of these patients had a inhibitory effect on radioligand binding to the beta 1 receptor of C6 rat glioma cells. They recognized the receptor protein by immunoblot and bound in situ to human myocardial tissue. We conclude that a subgroup of patients with idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy have in their sera autoantibodies specifically directed against the second extracellular loop of the beta 1-adrenergic receptor. These antibodies could serve as a marker of an autoimmune response with physiological and/or pathological implications. 
3	Primary progressive aphasia. Longitudinal course, neuropsychological profile, and language features. Four patients with the clinical syndrome of primary progressive aphasia and a nonfluent aphasia profile were followed up over a period of 3 to 5 years. Extensive neuropsychological data for three patients revealed a progressive, quantitative decline of language with relative stability of memory, visuospatial skills, and reasoning. Comportment and most activities of daily living were preserved even when speech was unintelligible. Although several aphasia types may be associated with primary progressive aphasia, a nonfluent aphasia profile and phonemic paraphasic errors are most useful in differentiating it from the much more common clinical syndrome, "probable Alzheimer's disease." The clinicopathological correlates of probable Alzheimer's disease differ from those associated with primary progressive aphasia. Therefore, the clinical distinction between the two syndromes may be important for predicting the underlying pathophysiologic changes during the life of the patient. 
4	Beta 2-microglobulin predicts survival in primary systemic amyloidosis. PURPOSE: The study assessed whether beta 2-microglobulin levels predict survival or response in patients with primary systemic amyloidosis without associated multiple myeloma. PATIENTS AND METHODS: The study group consisted of 131 untreated patients with biopsy-proven primary systemic amyloidosis diagnosed and evaluated at the Mayo Clinic. No patient had multiple myeloma. The minimum follow-up of surviving patients is 8 years. No patient was lost to follow-up. RESULTS: The median survival of patients with an increased beta 2-microglobulin level was 10.8 months, compared with patients with a normal beta 2-microglobulin level (less than or equal to 2.7 micrograms/mL, 0.23 mumol/L) of 32.9 months (p less than 0.001). In a multivariate proportional-hazards model, the best model included congestive heart failure (p less than 0.0001) and increased beta 2-microglobulin levels (p less than 0.05). After adjustment for the presence of congestive heart failure, beta 2-microglobulin level remained significant. When the analysis was restricted to those patients with normal renal function, the median survival of those with an elevated beta 2-microglobulin level was 9.1 months versus 39.4 months for those with a normal level (p less than 0.001). The serum level of beta 2-microglobulin was increased in patients with nephrotic-range proteinuria with or without renal insufficiency (p = 0.05). CONCLUSION: The serum beta 2-microglobulin level should be measured routinely in all patients with primary systemic amyloidosis because it provides a useful objective factor to identify subsets of patients with this disease who have unfavorable outcomes. 
2	The effects of nonthyroid disease and drugs on thyroid function tests. Serious nonthyroid illness and caloric deprivation, which so often accompany systemic illness, have diverse and still incompletely understood effects on thyroid hormone economy. We have discussed the pathophysiologic basis for the most common pattern of alterations in routine thyroid function tests: a decreased serum T3 concentration; normal or, in critically ill patients, a low total serum T4 level; and a normal free T4 concentration. Another, less frequent pattern (high total and free T4 with a normal serum T3) can be encountered transiently in the acutely ill medical or psychiatric patient. With the recent advent of sensitive assays for TSH and better methods for serum free T4, it is now possible to define more quickly and accurately the thyroid-metabolic status of most of these sick patients; the vast majority are euthyroid. Certain drugs confound the picture. The most important of these include dopamine and high-dose glucocorticoids, both of which suppress TSH secretion from the pituitary and may actually cause a state of central hypothyroidism. Other drugs have multiple effects on thyroid hormone indices (e.g., amiodarone). Knowledge of all of the ways in which systemic illness, starvation, and certain drugs may influence thyroid function tests is crucial in assessing the thyroid status of patients with serious nonthyroid disease. 
5	Psychological outcomes of different treatment policies in women with early breast cancer outside a clinical trial OBJECTIVES--To assess outside a clinical trial the psychological outcome of different treatment policies in women with early breast cancer who underwent either mastectomy or breast conservation surgery depending on the surgeon's opinion or the patient's choice. To determine whether the extent of psychiatric morbidity reported in women who underwent breast conservation surgery was associated with their participation in a randomised clinical trial. DESIGN--Prospective, multicentre study capitalising on individual and motivational differences among patients and the different management policies among surgeons for treating patients with early breast cancer. SETTING--12 District general hospitals, three London teaching hospitals, and four private hospitals. PATIENTS--269 Women under 75 with a probable diagnosis of stage I or II breast cancer who were referred to 22 different surgeons. INTERVENTIONS--Surgery and radiotherapy or adjuvant chemotherapy, or both, depending on the individual surgeon's stated preferences for managing early breast cancer. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES--Anxiety and depression as assessed by standard methods two weeks, three months, and 12 months after surgery. RESULTS--Of the 269 women, 31 were treated by surgeons who favoured mastectomy, 120 by surgeons who favoured breast conservation, and 118 by surgeons who offered a choice of treatment. Sixty two of the women treated by surgeons who offered a choice were eligible to choose their surgery, and 43 of these chose breast conserving surgery. The incidences of anxiety, depression, and sexual dysfunction were high in all treatment groups. There were no significant differences in the incidences of anxiety and depression between women who underwent mastectomy and those who underwent lumpectomy. A significant effect of surgeon type on the incidence of depression was observed, with patients treated by surgeons who offered a choice showing less depression than those treated by other surgeons (p = 0.06). There was no significant difference in psychiatric morbidity between women treated by surgeons who offered a choice who were eligible to choose their treatment and those in the same group who were not able to choose. Most of the women (159/244) gave fear of cancer as their primary fear rather than fear of losing a breast. The overall incidences of psychiatric morbidity in women who underwent mastectomy and those who underwent lumpectomy were similar to those found in the Cancer Research Campaign breast conservation study. At 12 months 28% of women who underwent mastectomy in the present study were anxious compared with 26% in the earlier study, and 27% of women in the present study who underwent lumpectomy were anxious compared with 31% in the earlier study. In both the present and earlier study 21% of women who underwent mastectomy were depressed, and 19% of women who underwent lumpectomy in the present study were depressed compared with 27% in the earlier study.) CONCLUSIONS--There is still no evidence that women with early breast cancer who undergo breast conservation surgery have less psychiatric morbidity after treatment than those who undergo mastectomy. Women who surrender autonomy for decision making by agreeing to participate in randomised clinical trials do not experience any different psychological, sexual, or social problems from those women who are treated for breast cancer outside a clinical trial. 
5	Chancroid and the role of genital ulcer disease in the spread of human retroviruses. Chancroid is the most prevalent form of genital ulcer disease in developing countries and is undergoing a resurgence in industrialized countries. As a result of a nonspecificity of the clinical findings, the etiologic diagnosis of genital ulcer disease requires laboratory support. Genital ulcer disease is a risk factor for the transmission of human retroviral infections. An understanding of this interaction is emerging and will impact on the treatment and control programs for the agents causing genital ulcer disease. 
4	Right coronary artery injury during tricuspid valve annuloplasty. An unusual complication after tricuspid valve annuloplasty is described where a ring suture ligated right coronary artery and precipitated myocardial infarct and patient death. The need for caution to prevent this complication with such surgery is emphasized. 
5	Locked intramedullary fixation for metaphyseal malunion and nonunion. Locked intramedullary rod fixation, established for metaphyseal fractures, is applicable to reconstructive procedures. Fourteen cases of complex nonunion or malunion (five infected) were reviewed retrospectively. Thirteen of the 14 fractures united. Eleven of 14 required an open procedure for removal of metal, soft-tissue release, bone grafting, osteotomy, or resection of infected bone. Infections were controlled by resection, depot antibiotics, and early stabilization. Interlocking intramedullary rods are an excellent fixation technique for posttraumatic metaphyseal reconstructive procedures. 
5	Reperfusion arrhythmias after thrombolysis. Electrophysiologic tempest, or much ado about nothing. Arrhythmias that may accompany myocardial reperfusion have generated significant clinical interest. First, there were concerns, based on animal studies, that high-grade ventricular tachyarrhythmias would pose a serious threat following thrombolytic therapy to treat an evolving myocardial infarction. Second, lower-grade arrhythmias, such as accelerated idioventricular rhythm, were cited as useful, noninvasive markers of successful reperfusion. Critical review of the current data, however, indicates that arrhythmias following thrombolytic therapy for acute myocardial infarction are usually neither dangerous clinical events nor consistent markers of reperfusion. 
5	Treatment of solitary arteriovenous fistulas. Four patients with a solitary arteriovenous fistula were treated by transvascular balloon embolization technique, which resulted in complete fistula closure in three patients and partial closure in one. There were two vertebral arteriovenous fistulas, one peroneal arteriovenous fistula, and one radial arteriovenous fistula. The first two fistulas were spontaneous, the other two were traumatic. The only partial occlusion of the peroneal fistula was, in our opinion, due to a technical failure, the balloon was inflated slightly proximal to the fistular orificium instead of in the orificium itself. There were no complications, and there was no morbidity. In our opinion transvascular balloon embolization technique is the treatment of choice for solitary arteriovenous fistulas. 
1	MIC2 is a specific marker for Ewing's sarcoma and peripheral primitive neuroectodermal tumors. Evidence for a common histogenesis of Ewing's sarcoma and peripheral primitive neuroectodermal tumors from MIC2 expression and specific chromosome aberration. This study reports on the specific expression of the MIC2 gene, a pseudoautosomal gene located on the short arms of the X and Y chromosomes, on Ewing's sarcoma (ES) and peripheral primitive neuroectodermal tumor (pPNET) cells. The gene product, a cell membrane protein, is recognized by the newly established monoclonal antibody (MoAb) HBA-71 and the previously described MoAb 12E7 and RFB-1. Furthermore, the reaction pattern of the MIC2 antibodies, especially HBA-71, with normal tissues and a great number of benign and malignant tumors (70 different tumors, 199 tumor samples), as well as the correlation between the specific chromosomal aberrations, i.e., the t(11;22) and the del(22) and the expression of this antigen, are demonstrated. Both ES and pPNET cells express the MIC2 gene in very high amounts, which represents a highly selective and almost unique feature of these cells, making an assignment of these tumors in one entity even more likely. The MIC2 antibodies are of great value for clinical and research purposes. 
1	Purification and characterization of an inhibitor (soluble tumor necrosis factor receptor) for tumor necrosis factor and lymphotoxin obtained from the serum ultrafiltrates of human cancer patients. Serum ultrafiltrates (SUF) from human patients with different types of cancer contain a blocking factor (BF) that inhibits the cytolytic activity of human tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha) in vitro. BF is a protein with a molecular mass of 28 kDa on reducing sodium dodecyl sulfate/polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS/PAGE). The active material was purified to homogeneity by a combination of affinity chromatography, PAGE, and high-pressure liquid chromatography. Amino acid sequence analysis revealed that BF is derived from the membrane TNF receptor. Purified BF blocks the lytic activity of recombinant human and mouse TNF-alpha and recombinant human lymphotoxin on murine L929 cells in vitro. However, BF inhibits the lytic activity of TNF-alpha more effectively than it does that of lymphotoxin. The BF also inhibits the necrotizing activity of recombinant human TNF-alpha when coinjected into established cutaneous Meth A tumors in BALB/c mice. The BF may have an important role in (i) the regulation and control of TNF-alpha and lymphotoxin activity in cancer patients, (ii) interaction between the tumor and the host antitumor mechanisms, and (iii) use of systemically administered TNF-alpha in clinical trials with human cancer patients. 
4	The Framingham Disability Study: relationship of various coronary heart disease manifestations to disability in older persons living in the community. The relation between coronary heart disease and disability was examined in 2,576 community-dwelling women and men ages 55-88 years. These Framingham Study participants were originally recruited in 1948-51 for an examination of cardiovascular disease. Twenty-seven years later, remaining members of the cohort were interviewed to ascertain physical abilities, and a score on a disability scale was assigned. Multivariate logistic analyses examined disability in relation to uncomplicated angina pectoris (AP), complicated AP, and coronary heart disease other than AP, controlling for possible confounders. In younger and older women and men, uncomplicated and complicated AP were associated with disability. Coronary heart disease other than AP was associated with disability only in the younger men. Congestive heart failure predicted disability only in the women. These results suggest that onset of AP should be recognized as a critical point in the development of disability and that AP is a better predictor of disability than is myocardial infarction or coronary insufficiency. 
1	The increased frequency of cervical dysplasia-neoplasia in women infected with the human immunodeficiency virus is related to the degree of immunosuppression. Cytologic and histologic investigations of the uterine cervix and studies of the lymphocyte functions were performed in human immunodeficiency virus-infected and human immunodeficiency virus antibody-negative women to study possible linkages between human papillomavirus-induced dysplasia and degree of human immunodeficiency virus-induced immunosuppression. Cytologic smears of the uterine cervix of 111 human immunodeficiency virus-infected women were compared with findings in 76 female intravenous drug users negative for human immunodeficiency virus antibodies and in a group of 526 women of the outpatient population of the hospital. Cervical dysplasia-neoplasia (including five cases of invasive carcinoma) was seen in 41% of the human immunodeficiency virus-infected patients. In human immunodeficiency virus-negative intravenous drug users dysplasia-neoplasia was seen in 9%, and in the sample from outpatients in 4%, including two cases of invasive carcinoma (p less than 0.01). Cytologic features that were attributable to infection with human papillomavirus were observed in human immunodeficiency virus-infected women four times more often than in the sample from the outpatient population (p less than 0.01). Frequency and severity of dysplasia appear to increase with diminishing numbers of CD4+ helper/inducer T lymphocytes and correlated significantly (p less than 0.01) with a loss of blastogenic response to phytohemagglutinin, pokeweed mitogen, and tetanus toxoid. These results suggest an increased risk for the development of dysplasia of the uterine cervix in women with human immunodeficiency virus infection, which is related to the degree of immunosuppression. 
5	Dysphagia following fundoplication: "slipped" fundoplication versus achalasia complicated by fundoplication. Failure to obtain preoperative esophageal manometry in patients being considered for antireflux surgery can result in immediate persistent postoperative dysphagia due to a missed diagnosis of achalasia. We describe the clinical assessment and management of a case of delayed postoperative dysphagia due to a "slipped" fundoplication, which is contrasted with three patients with immediate postoperative dysphagia due to a missed diagnosis of achalasia. Surgical revision was required to correct the "slipped" fundoplication, and pneumatic dilatation was successfully used in two of three cases of achalasia complicated by fundoplication. Careful preoperative esophageal evaluation with manometry is essential to rule out the presence of a primary esophageal motor disorder. 
1	Extracranial metastatic glioblastoma: appearance on thallium-201-chloride/technetium-99m-HMPAO SPECT images. Sequential thallium-201-chloride and technetium-99m-hexamethylpropyleneamine oxime single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) images were obtained in a patient with extracranial metastatic glioblastoma multiforme. Thallium-201 uptake was high (three times the scalp background) in all pathologically confirmed extracranial metastases and moderate (1.6 times scalp background) intracranially, where most biopsy specimens showed gliosis with scattered atypical astrocytes. Technetium-99m-HMPAO uptake was decreased intracranially in the right frontal and parietal lobes which had been irradiated. It was also decreased in one well-encapsulated scalp lesion and high in another scalp mass with less defined borders. Possible mechanisms of tumor uptake of these agents are reviewed. 
5	Parental presence during procedures in an emergency room: results from 50 observations. This report describes the physician-parent-child encounter during an invasive medical procedure in a pediatric emergency department. Fifty children underwent venipuncture or intravenous cannulation performed by 22 physicians and 6 nurses. The median age of the children was 12 months. Parents remained with their children during 31 (62%) of the 50 procedures. Parents were more likely to stay if they had previously stayed when this child (P = .05) or another (P = .02) had undergone a procedure. Parental decision to stay was not related to parental age, gender, race, marital status, or level of education, nor to the residents' age, gender, or level of training. Only 43% of the parents who did stay were given that option by the residents, and of those who did not stay 37% reported that physicians asked them to leave. Nonverbal cues by the residents, such as pulling the curtain closed or turning their back toward parents, were noted in 58% of the encounters in which parents did not stay. The residents and nurses indicated that parents should stay with their child for the following procedures: laceration repair, 66%; venipuncture, 58%; intravenous cannulation, 48%; arterial blood sampling, 32%; suprapubic aspiration, 20%; and lumbar puncture, 14%. In the emergency room studied, it appears that for venipuncture and intravenous cannulation, the majority of parents stay with their children. Parental decision to stay or leave is frequently made without discussion with the physician. 
3	Progress in the search for genetic linkage with Tourette syndrome: an exclusion map covering more than 50% of the autosomal genome. Gilles de la Tourette syndrome is a neuropsychiatric disorder with an autosomal dominant mode of inheritance and reduced penetrance at a single genetic locus. Several research groups have genetic linkage studies underway to detect the chromosomal location of the gene that predisposes for this disorder. Strong and clear evidence of linkage has not yet been produced for Tourette syndrome. This paper presents an overview of the methods and progress of the groups centered at Yale University and Erasmus University in excluding linkage from a large portion of the genome. Our labs have screened 228 genetic marker loci for linkage with a gene for this disorder in a series of affected families in the United States, Canada, The Netherlands, and Norway. More than 50% (and perhaps as much as 66%) of the autosomal genome has now been excluded on the assumption that genetic heterogeneity is not an important factor in the Tourette syndrome pedigrees pooled for this summary. 
1	Successful conservative management of primary nonmetastatic cervical choriocarcinoma. Primary cervical choriocarcinoma is a rare disease; since 1915 only about 60 cases have been published. The case presented here can be defined as primary cervical choriocarcinoma since it fulfills all the criteria delineated previously. 
5	Lightning injury with lung bleeding in a tracheotomized patient. A 68-year-old man, who had undergone laryngectomy six months earlier, was struck by lightning and developed pulmonary hemorrhage. This was attributed to pulmonary barotrauma due to a lightning blast via his tracheostoma. 
3	Loss of consciousness after emergence from anaesthesia. A case of suspected micturition syncope. A case of postanaesthesia micturition syncope with respiratory arrest is described. If syncope occurs, the temporary myocardial ischaemia and cerebral hypoperfusion may increase anaesthetic risk in the marginally compensated patient. The loss of airway protection during the syncopal period is also a cause of concern. We recommend the use of an indwelling bladder catheter during any prolonged surgical procedure. 
1	Radiation therapy in metastatic spinal cord compression. A prospective analysis of 105 consecutive patients. One hundred thirty consecutive patients with metastatic spinal cord compression (MSCC) were entered in a therapeutic protocol in which radiation therapy (RT) played the main role. When MSCC is diagnosed by clinical-radiologic methods such as myelography with or without computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), steroids are given and RT treatment started within 24 hours. When diagnostic doubts exist or stabilization is necessary, surgery precedes RT. Chemohormonal potentially responsive tumors are also treated with chemotherapy or hormonal therapy. Twelve patients (9.2%) underwent surgery plus RT, and 118 (90.8%) received RT alone. Thirteen (11%) early death patients were not evaluable. The 105 evaluable cases that received RT alone were analyzed. Median follow-up was 15 months (range, 4 to 38 months). Response among patients with back pain was 80%. In cases with motor dysfunction, 48.6% improved, and in 33 of 105 patients (31.4%) without motor disability there was no deterioration. Forty percent of patients with autonomic dysfunction responded to RT. Median survival time was 7 months with a 36% probability of survival for 1 year. The median duration of improvement was 8 months. The most important prognostic factor was early diagnosis. Radiosensitivity of tumor was only important in paraparetic patients in predicting response to RT. Complete myelographic block significantly diminished response to RT. Vertebral collapse did not influence response or survival. 
2	Perforation and tumor formation of the intestine in primary amyloidosis. We report a case of primary amyloidosis with repeated bowel perforations. This patient also had localized amyloid deposition creating a tumorous region mimicking malignancy in the rectum. Perforation of the intestine is common in systemic amyloidosis. The ischemic change due to amyloid infiltration into the vessel wall may lead to perforation of the affected bowel. Amyloid tumors occur more often in localized amyloid than in systemic amyloidosis. Macroscopically, it is difficult to distinguish amyloid tumor of the intestine from neoplasia. 
5	Unusually late onset of cerebrospinal fluid rhinorrhea after head trauma. Two cases of acute meningitis and cerebrospinal fluid rhinorrhea, in which the head trauma responsible occurred 10 and 30 years before, are presented. Intraoperatively, the brain parenchyma was found to be plugged into the fractured anterior fossa. By debridement and duraplasty from an intradural approach, both patients were cured. Several precipitating factors could be responsible for this unusually late reopening of the fistula. The possible accidental causes could be coughing or undetected microtraumas, but in the long run, atrophy of tissues and consequent changes in brain compliance with aging may play a role. 
1	Implications of peritoneal cytology for staging of early pancreatic cancer. Cytologic examination of peritoneal washings was performed in 40 patients with pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (35 head, 5 body) whose tumors had been selected as potentially resectable by computed tomographic (CT) findings. Saline (100 mL) was instilled and aspirated at laparoscopy in 27 patients and at laparotomy in 13. Malignant cells were found in the peritoneal washings in 12 of 40 patients (30%): 29% in cancers of the pancreatic head versus 40% in the body; 33% at laparoscopy versus 23% at laparotomy; and in 4 of 8 patients with ascites versus 8 of 32 without ascites. The cytology was positive in 6 of 8 patients (75%) who had a prior percutaneous needle biopsy versus 6 of 32 (19%) of those who did not (p less than 0.01). Liver metastases were found in six patients, all with negative cytology. One of 10 pancreatic head cancers with positive cytology was resectable versus 13 of 25 with negative cytology (p less than 0.05). Survival was significantly longer in patients with negative cytology. We conclude that (1) pancreatic cancer sheds malignant cells into the peritoneum early and commonly; (2) laparoscopic lavage is an effective means of cytologic study; (3) ascites is not a precondition for cytologic study, nor does its presence necessarily imply carcinomatosis; (4) intraperitoneal spread of cancer cells may be promoted by tumor biopsy; (5) cytologic findings provide an additional index of resectability; and (6) cytologic findings appear to correlate with duration of survival. This study shows that even "localized" pancreatic cancer is often not contained and suggests caution with biopsy of potentially curable lesions. 
4	Multiple breakpoint method for measuring effect of antibiotics on endocarditis strains of streptococci. The activity of penicillin alone and combined with aminoglycoside on endocarditis strains of streptococci was examined. Good assay reproducibility was obtained by the use of logarithmic phase cultures standardised by opacity, careful inoculation of well-plates, removal of antibiotic by membrane transfer and incubating survival counts in hydrogen plus carbon dioxide. The use of 10-fold intervals for penicillin concentration simplified assay design without loss of efficiency. 
3	Familial eating epilepsy. Eating-related seizures affecting 20 individuals among 59 siblings belonging to nine families are presented. The type of epilepsy was partial in all the affected individuals, and the seizures complex in 15 and simple in 5, secondarily generalized in the majority. The onset of epilepsy, in most cases, was in the second decade of life. A remarkable degree of intra-family consistency was observed with regard to age at onset, symptomatology of seizures and timing of eating seizures. The study demonstrates sibling clustering in a partial epilepsy, implicating for the first time genetic susceptibility in the aetiology of eating epilepsy. 
1	Malignant adenolymphoma of the parotid gland: report of carcinomatous transformation. Malignant transformation of an adenolymphoma (Warthin's tumour) is a rare event. This paper presents a case of carcinoma arising in an adenolymphoma of the parotid gland. 
4	Prevalence of symptoms of Raynaud's phenomenon in general practice. OBJECTIVE--To investigate the prevalence of Raynaud's phenomenon in the populations of five general practices. DESIGN--Two populations studied. A questionnaire was given to all new patients attending five general practices over four weeks, and the same questionnaire was sent by post to a random sample of adults from two of the practices. SETTING--General practices in inner London, Merseyside, and Cheshire. SUBJECTS--1532 Patients who completed questionnaires (1119 who attended the surgeries (response rate unknown) and 413 respondents to the postal survey (response rate 69%)). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES--Response to questionnaire on symptoms of Raynaud's phenomenon: patients were regarded as having the disease if they had episodes of blanching of the fingers that were precipitated by cold and accompanied by sensory symptoms (pins and needles or numbness). Subsequent interview and clinical appraisal of patients with the disease according to their responses to the questionnaire. RESULTS--The prevalence of Raynaud's phenomenon was 11% (26/231) and 19% (34/182) respectively in men and women who completed the postal questionnaire and 16% (56/357) and 21% (157/762) respectively in those who completed the questionnaire when attending their general practice. Thus the overall rates were slightly higher in women, but there was no effect of age even after adjustment of the rates for practice and method of survey. CONCLUSION--The prevalence of Raynaud's phenomenon is high compared with the low number of patients who seek treatment for the disease. 
3	Absence of acetylcholine-induced current in epithelial cells from thymus glands and thymomas of myasthenia gravis patients. We investigated the activity of ion channels in epithelial cells from human thymus glands and thymomas kept in short-term cell culture by clamping the membrane potential of the cells at -85 mV and determining the membrane current flowing on application of acetylcholine, glycine, or gamma-aminobutyric acid. In concentrations of up to 10(-3) M, none of the neurotransmitters induced any detectable current. This suggests (1) that there are no acetylcholine receptors (AChRs) or other products of the AChR gene family having ion-channel properties in the membranes of these epithelial cells, and (2) that the alpha-bungarotoxin-binding protein of thymus and thymoma has no AChR-like ion-channel property. These results support the hypothesis that the cross-reacting structures that elicit the anti-AChR autoimmune response in thymoma-associated myasthenia gravis are antigens having only limited homology with the AChR. Myasthenia gravis not associated with thymoma might have a different pathogenesis. 
4	Inflation pressure requirements during coronary angioplasty. To examine the balloon inflation pressures required for successful percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA), the maximal inflation pressure required for 477 coronary lesions in 200 consecutive patients was determined retrospectively. When graded balloon inflations just sufficient to achieve full expansion were used, the maximal inflation pressure used was less than or equal to 8 atm in 412 stenoses (86%) and was less than or equal to 10 atm in 463 stenoses (97%). Successful PTCA was achieved in 98% of lesions with a 3.5% major procedural complication rate. In a second group of 100 patients studied prospectively, the inflation pressure required to achieve full balloon expansion was less than or equal to 8 atm in 214 of 232 stenoses (92%) and less than or equal to 10 atm in 228 stenoses (98%). Thus, PTCA of coronary stenoses can be achieved with high success rates and low complication rates when graded inflations to pressures just sufficient to achieve full balloon expansion are performed. Most coronary stenoses will respond to pressures less than or equal to 8-10 atm. 
4	Hemorrhoidectomy during pregnancy: risk or relief? Acute hemorrhoidal crisis can occur in the pregnant female. When medical therapy fails to relieve pain, operative intervention may be necessary. The surgeon, however, may be reluctant to operate due to potential complications to the mother and fetus. From July 1983 to July 1989, hemorrhoidectomy was performed in 25 of 12,455 pregnant women (0.2 percent) who delivered in our institution. Twenty-two women were in their third trimester, 80 percent were multiparous, and each had a remote history of hemorrhoidal symptoms, including intermittent pain, bleeding, and protrusion. Closed hemorrhoidectomy was performed under local anesthesia. The surgery was directed at removing only symptomatic disease, which included three quadrants in 14 patients, two quadrants in seven patients, and one quadrant in four patients. All patients experienced relief of intractable pain the day after surgery, except one patient who required a hemostatic packing during the immediate post-operative period. There were no other maternal or fetal complications. Subsequent follow-up for anorectal disease ranged from 6 months to 6 years. Six (24 percent) patients required additional hemorrhoid treatment. Hemorrhoidectomy in selected pregnant patients is safe in our experience. 
5	Are myotonias and periodic paralyses associated with susceptibility to malignant hyperthermia? Excised muscles from patients with myotonia or periodic paralysis were subjected to the in vitro contracture test for susceptibility to malignant hyperthermia (MH). In a group of 44 patients, this standard test gave four positive, 10 equivocal and 30 negative results. The results for 27 control muscles from normal subjects were negative. When the test was performed with less than normal concentrations of contracture-triggering substances (caffeine less than or equal to 2 mmol litre-1, less than or equal to 2% halothane), 70% of the muscles from the patients and only 15% of the controls responded with small contractures (less than 0.2 g). These results should not be taken to indicate that the patients have the genetic trait for MH. The positive and equivocal test results, in addition to the slight contractures, may be accounted for by the electrical after-activity in the cases of pure myotonia, and by increased resting myoplasmic [Ca2+] in myotonic dystrophy. This shows that the in vitro contracture test lacks specificity. 
4	Inflammatory abdominal aortic aneurysm: an indication for the retroperitoneal approach. In three recent cases, one of which is described in this report, we have found the retroperitoneal approach to have the following significant and distinct advantages over the transabdominal repair of inflammatory abdominal aortic aneurysms: (1) The posterolateral aspect of the aorta characteristically is not significantly involved by the inflammatory process, whereas the anterior aspect is. (2) The duodenum does not need to be dissected away from the aorta and, in fact, is not seen. (3) The left renal vein moves up off the neck of the aneurysm with forward mobilization of the kidney, facilitating proximal control. Now that the computerized tomography scan has become the preferred preoperative imaging technique for abdominal aortic aneurysms, the diagnosis of inflammatory abdominal aortic aneurysm can routinely be made before elective operation allowing the retroperitoneal approach to be selected. 
3	The value of intubating and paralyzing patients with suspected head injury in the emergency department. One hundred consecutive trauma patients who underwent planned emergency intubation with muscle paralysis in the ED were studied to investigate the safety of these procedures and to determine their impact on the evaluation of patients with suspected head injury. Patients were intubated by either a surgeon (n = 47) or anesthesiologist (n = 53), and paralyzed with either vecuronium (n = 59) or succinylcholine (n = 41). Nasal intubation was used in 40 patients, oral in 57, and cricothyroidotomy in three. Ninety-four patients with suspected head injuries had a CT scan performed. Fifty-five (59%) had a positive scan and 15 required emergent neurosurgical intervention. Only two patients had lateral cervical spine roentgenograms before intubation; seven patients were eventually found to have cervical fractures. No patient suffered a neurologic deficit. One patient developed aspiration pneumonia following intubation. The three failed intubations occurred in patients with multiple facial fractures. We conclude that induced paralysis and intubation in the ED is safe, can facilitate the diagnostic workup, and may be a potentially life-saving maneuver in combative trauma patients. 
5	Bipolar hemiarthroplasty for subcapital fracture of the femoral neck. A prospective randomised trial of cemented Thompson and uncemented Moore stems. We performed a randomised prospective trial to compare the results of 27 cemented and 26 uncemented bipolar hemiarthroplasties in active patients with displaced subcapital fractures of the femoral neck. After a mean follow-up of 17 months, significantly more of the uncemented group were experiencing pain in the hip and using more walking aids than the patients in the cemented group. The incidence of postoperative complications, the early mortality rate and the operating time and blood loss were not significantly different. Using otherwise identical prostheses the early results were much better with a cemented Thompson stem than with an uncemented Austin Moore stem. 
1	Current advances in the diagnosis and treatment of AIDS: an introduction. Significant progress has been made in the diagnosis and treatment of AIDS. Laboratory tests available for assessment of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection include the detection of antibodies to HIV type 1, the direct detection of the virus, the identification of surrogate markers, and the phenotypic analysis of peripheral blood mononuclear cells. Clinicians have made great strides in the treatment of tumors, opportunistic infections, and complications associated with AIDS as well as in the treatment of the infection itself. In selected patients, treatment with interferon-alpha has been successful against AIDS-related Kaposi's sarcoma. Attempts to treat the leukopenia and anemia of patients with AIDS by the administration of hematopoietic growth factors have resulted in increased white blood cell counts and a decrease in erythrocyte transfusion requirements. In addition to zidovudine, several antiretroviral agents are undergoing testing, including the nucleoside analogues dideoxycytidine and dideoxyinosine, soluble CD4, and the glycosidase inhibitor N-butyldeoxynojirimycin. 
4	Ventricular stroke work loss: validation of a method of quantifying the severity of aortic stenosis and derivation of an orifice formula Because aortic stenosis results in the loss of left ventricular stroke work (due to resistance to flow through the valve and turbulence in the aorta), the percentage of stroke work that is lost may reflect the severity of stenosis. This index can be calculated from pressure data alone. The relation between percent stroke work loss and anatomic aortic valve orifice area (measured by planimetry from videotape) was investigated in a pulsatile flow model. Thirteen valves were studied (nine human aortic valves obtained at necropsy and four bioprosthetic valves) at stroke volumes of 40 to 100 ml, giving 57 data points. Valve area ranged from 0.3 to 2.8 cm2 and mean systolic pressure gradient from 3 to 84 mm Hg. Percent stroke work loss, calculated as mean systolic pressure gradient divided by mean ventricular systolic pressure x 100%, ranged from 7 to 68%. It was closely related to anatomic orifice area with an inverse exponential relation and was not significantly related to flow (r = -0.15). An orifice formula was derived that predicted anatomic orifice area with a 95% confidence interval of +/- 0.5 cm2 (orifice area [cm2] = 4.82 [2.39 x log percent stroke work loss], r = -0.94, SEE = 0.029). These results support the clinical use of percent stroke work loss as an easily obtained index of the severity of aortic stenosis. 
1	Orbit, skull base, and pharynx: contrast-enhanced fat suppression MR imaging. The high signal intensity of fat on T1-weighted magnetic resonance images has limited the utility of gadopentetate dimeglumine in imaging of the extracranial head and neck. Enhancing lesions may be obscured either by proximity to fat or by chemical misregistration artifact. The authors evaluated the role of a gadolinium-enhanced fat suppression imaging technique in the detection of extracranial head and neck abnormalities in 29 patients. These studies were directly compared with conventional pre- and postcontrast T1- and T2-weighted SE sequences. In detecting and defining the extent of abnormalities, fat-suppressed images were superior to non-fat-suppressed gadolinium-enhanced T1-weighted images in the majority of cases (22 of 27 [81%]). Fat-suppressed images were particularly beneficial in the detection of perineural spread of tumor as well as in defining lesions situated within or adjacent to fat-containing areas such as the base of the skull. These findings demonstrate that fat suppression techniques in combination with gadolinium enhancement are of value in extracranial head and neck imaging and should replace conventional postcontrast T1-weighted SE imaging. 
5	Treatment of flexor tenosynovitis of the hand ('trigger finger') with corticosteroids. A prospective study of the response to local injection. We developed a protocol to maximize medical therapy for "trigger finger." Fifty-eight patients with 77 episodes of flexor tenosynovitis of the hand that was resistant to rest, therapy with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, and/or splinting were treated with single or multiple injections of depo-methylprednisolone acetate or triamcinolone acetonide. Patients were prospectively followed up for an average of 4.6 years. Results showed that symptoms and signs resolved in 61% after a single injection. Recurrent episodes, after prolonged pain-free intervals, occurred in 27% and were effectively re-treated with injection. In 12% of cases, either injection failed or early recurrence required surgical release. Local adverse reactions to injection, including pain at the injection site, stiffness, ecchymosis, or atrophy of subcutaneous fat, were self-limited. No episodes of postinjection infection or tendon rupture occurred. The medical management of flexor tenosynovitis with local corticosteroid injection(s) is effective in nearly 90% of cases and is free from serious adverse reactions. 
5	Studies of controlled reperfusion after ischemia. XXIII. Deleterious effects of simulated thrombolysis preceding simulated coronary artery bypass grafting with controlled blood cardioplegic reperfusion. This study tests whether simulated thrombolysis before controlled reperfusion (i.e., simulated coronary artery bypass) causes reperfusion injury that obviates the benefits of subsequent controlled reperfusion and results in unnecessary ventricular arrhythmias. Fifteen dogs underwent acute occlusion of the left anterior descending coronary artery. In 10 dogs we simulated thrombolysis after 1 hour of ischemia (delivering 10% to 15% of control flow at 5 ml/min), followed 1 hour later by either normal blood reperfusion at systemic pressure (to simulate percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty) in five dogs or regionally controlled blood cardioplegic reperfusion on bypass in five others to simulate coronary bypass. In five dogs ischemia was prolonged to 2 hours, and the initial reperfusate was blood cardioplegic solution on total vented bypass (to simulate primary coronary bypass). All hearts receiving simulated thrombolysis (100%) after 1 hour of ischemia had reperfusion-induced ventricular fibrillation. All hearts treated by simulated angioplasty recovered regional contractility (56% of control systolic shortening), whereas there was no (0%) recovery of spontaneous contractility after subsequent blood cardioplegic reperfusion, and only two (40%) dogs had contractile reserve capacity (6% +/- 49%). Conversely, surgically controlled blood cardioplegic reperfusion without preceding low-flow normal blood reperfusion after 2 hours of ischemia resulted in no ventricular arrhythmias (0%; p less than 0.05 versus simulated coronary artery bypass after simulated thrombolysis), 72% +/- 7% (p less than 0.05 versus simulated coronary artery bypass after simulated thrombolysis) recovery of regional contractility (ultrasonic crystals), and 114% +/- 11% (p less than 0.05 versus simulated coronary artery bypass after simulated thrombolysis) recovery of contractile reserve with calcium chloride stimulation. We conclude that controlled reperfusion (simulating coronary artery bypass) with blood cardioplegic solution produces immediate functional recovery and avoids the ventricular fibrillation that follows simulated thrombolysis despite the need for prolonged ischemic time. Preceding controlled reperfusion by normal blood reperfusion (simulated thrombolysis) shortens the ischemic time but nullifies immediate functional recovery possible by simulated coronary bypass and produces unnecessary arrhythmias. 
1	Update: prostate cancer. Prostate cancer represents a major health-care issue for older men. Recent technical advances in imaging, serum markers, and treatment hold great promise. Further insight into the natural history and biologic potential of this ubiquitous neoplasm is necessary before we can make rational decisions about early detection and newer treatment approaches. 
4	A prospective study of acute central retinal artery obstruction. The incidence of secondary ocular neovascularization. We conducted a prospective study to determine the incidence of ocular neo-vascularization following acute central retinal artery obstruction. Only patients initially evaluated within 7 days of visual loss were eligible. Any patient with pre-existing ocular neovascularization or clinical evidence of the ocular ischemic syndrome noted at the initial evaluation was excluded. During the 18-month study, 33 consecutive patients were enrolled. Six patients subsequently developed neovascularization of the iris, an incidence of 18.2%. In these six patients, neovascularization of the iris appeared as early as 12 days to as late as 15 weeks following the artery obstructions. Five of the six patients (15.2% of the total) later developed neovascular glaucoma. Another patient in this series developed neovascularization of the optic disc without neovascularization of the iris, an incidence of 3.0%. Only two of the seven patients with ocular neovascularization had ipsilateral hemodynamically significant carotid artery disease as determined by noninvasive carotid artery testing. This study confirms results of previous retrospective studies that the incidence of ocular neovascularization after central retinal artery obstruction is higher than commonly thought. It also shows that, in the majority of cases, carotid artery disease is not responsible for the neovascularization seen after central retinal artery obstruction. 
1	Nuclear DNA profiles in primary melanomas and their metastases. DNA-aneuploid primary melanomas are said to show a greater propensity to metastasize than those without an aneuploid profile. A higher aneuploid rate has also been reported in metastatic melanomas than in primary lesions. The ploidy profile was determined of 26 primary melanomas and their first subsequent secondaries on Feulgen-stained sections from routinely processed material using a computerized video image-analysis system. In 18 of 26 cases, both primary and secondary tumor showed similar corresponding DNA patterns. These were aneuploid in 13 of 18 of the cases. A hyperdiploid pattern was present in one case in both the primary and its metastasis, and a diploid pattern was seen in four cases. There were only eight cases in which a disparity between the nuclear ploidy profile in the primary and secondary tumor was evident. Although the results suggest that ploidy studies are not useful for predicting the metastatic potential of a primary melanoma, the maintenance of similar DNA profiles in the metastases in most of these cases was interesting in regard to tumor biology. 
4	Tachycardia during reversal of one-kidney, one-clip hypertension in conscious rats. The efferent sympathetic activity of the heart was investigated during reversal of one-kidney, one-clip (1K,1C) hypertension in conscious, freely moving rats using changes in heart rate as an index. One-kidney, one-clip hypertensive rats presented marked tachycardia during the first 8 h after unclipping. Mean arterial pressure fell 28% 3 h after unclipping and 37% 8 h after unclipping. In a separate experiment, short term infusion (15 min) of sodium nitroprusside in conscious freely moving rats produced similar tachycardia in hypertensive and sham-operated rats. The present results indicate that the baroreceptor reflex of the heart was operating normally during the prompt reversal of hypertension after unclipping. 
4	A prospective study of sodium-lithium countertransport and hypertension in Utah. A 7-year prospective study of a cohort of 1,458 normotensive adults from Utah pedigrees, screened from 1980 to 1985, was done to determine whether baseline levels of sodium-lithium countertransport were associated with an increased risk of future hypertension. Subsequent new hypertension (n = 39) was ascertained in 1989 from detailed follow-up medical questionnaires (67% response). Previous segregation analyses on a subset of these pedigree members who responded (n = 342) using family relationships in addition to countertransport levels have shown statistically inferred major gene segregation of sodium-lithium countertransport levels. In the normotensive adults inferred by segregation analysis to carry the recessive major gene for high sodium-lithium countertransport, new-onset hypertension occurred in 18.8% (3 of 16) compared with 3.7% (12 of 326) in the low sodium-lithium countertransport genotype group (relative risk, 4.6 [1.6, 13.9]; p = 0.03). However, an elevated baseline sodium-lithium countertransport level without genotype information from segregation analysis did not increase the risk of future hypertension in the complete cohort of adult pedigree members (relative risk, 1.02 [0.85, 1.22]). Adjustment for other risk factors reduced the relative risk to 0.90 (0.72, 1.11). We conclude that the presence of a major gene for sodium-lithium countertransport or another closely linked gene, rather than the actual level of sodium-lithium countertransport, may increase the risk of hypertension onset. High sodium-lithium countertransport levels do not increase the risk of future hypertension for individuals in whom only polygenic and environmental effects determine sodium-lithium countertransport level. 
5	Prolonged intermittent clamping of the portal triad during hepatectomy. From 112 consecutive hepatectomies for malignant tumours performed with intermittent portal triad clamping, we have retrospectively selected the 20 cases in which clamping exceeded 90 min. Intermittent portal clamping of prolonged duration was used because of abnormal liver texture in 13 cases (mainly patients who had received intra-arterial chemotherapy) and/or because of technically difficult hepatectomy. The mean(s.d.) duration of intermittent portal clamping was 109(18) min and in two cases it exceeded 140 min (148 and 150 min). There was no postoperative mortality and the rate of postoperative morbidity was 35 per cent. Postoperative changes in biochemical liver tests were not major and transient hepatic failure occurred in only one patient following subtotal resection of the liver. We conclude that intermittent portal clamping is a useful manoeuvre in partial hepatectomy when resection is difficult or prolonged, or when the liver parenchyma is abnormal. Such clamping may be used for longer than 120 min without major complications. 
5	Central corpectomy for cervical spondylotic myelopathy: a consecutive series with long-term follow-up evaluation. Since 1984, a consecutive series of patients with cervical spondylotic myelopathy has been treated by central corpectomy and strut grafting. This report focuses on 40 cases operated on between 1984 and 1987 and followed from 2 to 5 years. The perioperative complication rate was 47.5%, with a 7.5% incidence of persistent sequelae: severe C-5 radiculopathy in one patient, swallowing dysfunction in one, and hypoglossal nerve palsy in one. No single factor (age, duration of symptoms, or severity of myelopathy) was absolutely predictive of outcome; however, syndromes of short duration had the best likelihood of cure. Similar outcomes were associated, individually, with long duration of symptoms, age over 70 years, and severe myelopathy. After factoring a 5% regression of improvement, the long-term cure rate was 57.5% and the failure rate was 15%. Myelopathy worsening was not documented. 
1	Mobile knee reconstructions after resection of malignant tumors of the distal femur. Limb-salvage surgery involving mobile knee reconstructions for malignant tumors about the distal femur is a desirable and achievable goal. With limb salvage, the survival rate does not decrease significantly, and the resulting function is superior to when an amputation plus a prosthesis are used. Immediate and delayed morbidity is greater after limb-salvage surgery than after amputation. However, with thorough preoperative planning, use of neoadjuvant chemotherapy as indicated, and an experienced team of surgeons, limb-salvage surgery can provide a mobile knee with excellent function in the vast majority of cases for patients with malignant tumors of the distal femur. 
5	Pediatric sinusitis. The role of endoscopic sinus surgery in cystic fibrosis and other forms of sinonasal disease. Functional endoscopic sinus surgery has altered the surgical treatment of sinus disease in adults. We report our experience with functional endoscopic sinus surgery in the pediatric population. Functional endoscopic sinus surgery was safe and effective and compared favorably with traditional surgery with regard to operative time, blood loss, and parental opinion. 
4	Increase of intraplatelet free calcium ion during extracorporeal circulation with a hollow fiber oxygenator: arterial filter and dynamics of platelet thrombosis on oxygenator and filter in a pig model. Intraplatelet free calcium (IPFC) ions provide a common pathway for platelet activation leading to thrombosis and embolization. IPFC levels were determined by chlorotetracycline fluorometry during extracorporeal circulation (ECC) with systemic heparin in eight Yorkshire pigs (weighing 30-40 kg; 3 control and 5 ECC); the ratio of slow phase organelle calcium sequestration to fast phase platelet-membrane binding is an index of free calcium. During 3 hr of ECC with a hollow fiber oxygenator (HFO) (Bentley CM-50) and AF (Bentley 1025), seven blood samples were collected 5 min before and during ECC. The platelet deposition (CPM/microCi) on HFO (PDHFO) was simultaneously measured with In-111-labeled autologous platelets (300-400 microCi) and a Geiger probe detector at -5, 0, 5, 30, 45, 60, 120, and 180 min. During ECC, IPFC and HFO thrombus increase significantly (p less than 0.05) at 45 min with respect to control IPFC values of 0.4 +/- 0.1, suggesting direct participation of calcium activated platelets in thrombosis on HFO. The decline of IPFC is due to extrusion and sequestration by dense granules, and decline in HFO thrombus is due to embolization. On the other hand, the embolus in the arterial filter was trapped in a linear fashion, with a consistent increase with time of ECC. 
1	Anorectal malignant melanoma in Sweden. Report of 49 patients. Clinicopathologic features and prognosis of 49 patients with anal malignant melanoma were investigated in the total Swedish population between 1970 and 1984. Median age was 71 years (range, 50 to 87 years), and there was a female predominance (31 females, 18 males). The most common symptom at presentation was bleeding. The majority of tumors ranged between 2 and 5 cm in diameter and all invaded at least into the submucosa and/or the lamina propria. At diagnosis, one third of the patients had either regional or distant metastasis with a median survival of 5 months. The remaining patients were surgically treated with curative intent, either by abdominoperineal resection (APR) or local excision. Median survival was poor in both treatment groups (APR, 12 months; local excision, 13 months). Most patients died with distant metastasis. Our results confirm the opinion that APR offers no more curative potential than a more conservative surgical approach. However, tumor sizes were on average smaller in the group treated by local excision. This could indicate that, in the absence of known distant metastasis, radical surgery should be performed, particularly since local recurrences tended to be more common after a local excision. 
5	The lap belt complex: intestinal and lumbar spine injury in children. The "seatbelt syndrome" describes intestinal and spinal injury caused by lap-style automotive restraints. More than 2,600 children were admitted to Children's National Medical Center with blunt injury in 3 years; 395 were involved in a motor vehicle crash. Ninety-five of the crash occupants (24%) were known to be wearing safety belts. Ten children sustained a "lap belt injury": five with lumbar spine injury, four with combined lumbar spine and intestinal injuries, and one child with intestinal injury. All ten children presented with a characteristic transverse abdominal ecchymosis. The CT scan was unreliable in evaluation of both spinal and intestinal injury. Lateral radiographs were required for definitive diagnosis in eight of nine children with lumbar spinal injury. CT scan was clearly diagnostic in only one of five children with intestinal injury. Children wearing lap belts are at risk of a "lap belt complex." Lateral spine X-rays, peritoneal lavage, and early laparotomy are recommended to establish an accurate diagnosis and to decrease morbidity. 
4	The agent of bacillary angiomatosis. An approach to the identification of uncultured pathogens BACKGROUND. Bacillary angiomatosis is an infectious disease causing proliferation of small blood vessels in the skin and visceral organs of patients with human immunodeficiency virus infection and other immunocompromised hosts. The agent is often visualized in tissue sections of lesions with Warthin-Starry staining, but the bacillus has not been successfully cultured or identified. This bacillus may also cause cat scratch disease. METHODS. In attempting to identify this organism, we used the polymerase chain reaction. We used oligonucleotide primers complementary to the 16S ribosomal RNA genes of eubacteria to amplify 16S ribosomal gene fragments directly from tissue samples of bacillary angiomatosis. The DNA sequence of these fragments was determined and analyzed for phylogenetic relatedness to other known organisms. Normal tissues were studied in parallel. RESULTS. Tissue from three unrelated patients with bacillary angiomatosis yielded a unique 16S gene sequence. A sequence obtained from a fourth patient with bacillary angiomatosis differed from the sequence found in the other three patients at only 4 of 241 base positions. No related 16S gene fragment was detected in the normal tissues. These 16S sequences associated with bacillary angiomatosis belong to a previously uncharacterized microorganism, most closely related to Rochalimaea quintana. CONCLUSIONS. The cause of bacillary angiomatosis is a previously uncharacterized rickettsia-like organism, closely related to R. quintana. This method for the identification of an uncultured pathogen may be applicable to other infectious diseases of unknown cause. 
1	Testicular carcinoma in patients positive and at risk for human immunodeficiency virus. Patients with the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome are at increased risk for certain malignancies. Because acquired immunodeficiency syndrome and testicular cancer affect primarily young men, the potential complications that acquired immunodeficiency syndrome might impose raise significant concern. To address this question we performed a retrospective review of all cases of testicular cancer during an 11-year period. Of 140 patients 6 had human immunodeficiency virus infection and 7 were from human immunodeficiency virus risk groups. All cases were either stage I or II disease with seminoma in 8, teratocarcinoma in 3, embryonal cell carcinoma in 1 and teratoma in 1. The clinical presentations of these patients were comparable to those of patients without human immunodeficiency virus risk factors. The majority of the patients received standard therapy, including orchiectomy followed by lymphadenectomy, radiation therapy or chemotherapy depending on stage and pathological subtype. Patients tolerated therapy well with only 1 course of radiation therapy complicated by Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia. All patients achieved complete remission and none died of testicular cancer. Since treatment of these patients may worsen the immunosuppression, surveillance is recommended after orchiectomy for acquired immunodeficiency syndrome patients with stage I disease. However, the majority of patients with human immunodeficiency virus infection should receive standard therapy. 
5	Long-term treatment of Crohn's disease with cyclosporine: the effect of a very low dose on maintenance of remission. Low-dose oral cyclosporine was used to maintain remission in patients with Crohn's disease. In seven patients, cyclosporine was used as a steroid-sparing agent; in 14 it was given for refractory active disease as an adjunct to conventional treatment, and then continued as maintenance treatment. Cyclosporine was given at an initial dose of 5 mg/kg reduced by 1 mg/kg at 2-month intervals until a maintenance dose of 2 mg/kg was reached. Of the seven patients in whom cyclosporine was used as a steroid-sparing agent, six had a relapse. Remission was achieved in seven of the refractory active group, but cyclosporine was withdrawn because of side effects in six of the patients in this group. Of the seven patients who had achieved remission, six subsequently had a relapse. Therefore, 12 of 14 patients (86%) in remission had a relapse despite cyclosporine maintenance. Ten of these (83%) had a relapse at a cyclosporine dose of 2 or 3 mg/kg. Cyclosporine levels at relapse (median, 74 ng/ml) were lower than the mean levels over the first 6 weeks of treatment (median, 130 ng/ml; p = 0.02). Our data do not support the use of cyclosporine to maintain remission in Crohn's disease. 
4	Salvage of branch vessels during bifurcation lesion angioplasty: acute and long-term follow-up. To evaluate angiographic success, frequency of branch vessel loss and salvage, and long-term outcome, we studied the early and late outcomes of 56 consecutive patients who underwent PTCA of bifurcation lesions, which involved the left anterior descending or left circumflex coronary artery, with stenoses greater than 70% in both the parent and an involved branch vessel. In 35 patients (63%), the PTCA strategy was attempted dilation of both the main vessel and the involved branch vessels using predominantly a double-wire, sequential balloon technique; in 21 (27%) the PTCA attempt was confined to the main vessel alone. Transient angiographic occlusion of the branch vessel occurred in 32% of patients in whom dilation of both vessels was attempted, and in 38% in whom the main vessel alone was dilated (p = NS); 91% of the occluded branch vessels were the salvaged when sequential angioplasty of both vessels had been initially planned, compared to only 38% when the initial strategy had been dilation of the main vessel alone (p less than .05). Predischarge exercise testing showed residual ischemia in 6% of patients who had both vessels successfully dilated, versus 37% in those in whom dilatation was confined to the main vessels (p less than .01). Clinical restenosis, defined as late (greater than 6 weeks) recurrence of angina or a positive exercise test, occurred in 42% of patients who had both vessels successfully dilated. Thus although bifurcation lesion angioplasty frequently results in transient branch vessel loss, these branches can usually be salvaged using a double-wire technique but tend to have a higher late restenosis than conventional single vessel PTCA. 
4	Calcium and blood pressure. An epidemiologic perspective. We reviewed the research literature on the epidemiologic relationship between blood pressure levels and calcium, with an emphasis on dietary intake. A conceptual framework for causal inference is summarized; then the designs and results of observational and intervention studies are presented. Of 25 reports of observational studies relating intake of calcium or calcium-rich foods to blood pressure, the majority found some evidence of an inverse association. However, many analyses did not support this relationship, and only two studies have confirmed the inverse association with a prospective design. Nineteen randomized controlled clinical trials of calcium supplementation have been reported, excluding those exclusively in pregnant women. Eleven of these showed no significant effects on blood pressure; in two trials, both systolic and diastolic pressure were significantly reduced; and in the remainder results were equivocal. Pooled analyses yielded estimates of a small (1.8 mm Hg), significant reduction in systolic blood pressure, but no effect on diastolic pressure. Epidemiologic relationships with serum and urinary calcium, and the possible mechanisms of these effects, are also discussed. We conclude that the evidence from studies in humans is suggestive, but not conclusive, regarding a role for calcium in hypertension. Recommendations for further epidemiologic studies are presented. 
1	Colposcopic survey of Papanicolaou test-negative cases with hyperkeratosis or parakeratosis. A colposcopic survey was performed in 269 consecutive women with negative cytology showing hyperkeratosis or parakeratosis. A colposcopy-guided biopsy specimen of cervical abnormalities was taken in 88 cases, and human papillomavirus infection (HPV) was detected histologically in 25 cases. No cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) was detected. The detection rate of HPV was not significantly different from that observed in a consecutive series of 1073 Papanicolaou test-negative subjects self-referred for colposcopy. Colposcopic screening of subjects showing hyperkeratosis or parakeratosis with otherwise negative smears is not recommended because it does not allow detection of cytologically false-negative CIN. 
5	Involvement of thromboxane and neutrophils in multiple-system organ edema with interleukin-2. Interleukin-2 (IL-2) produces toxicity characterized by generalized edema within 24 hours. This study tests whether the rate of IL-2 administration modulates the onset of edema and examines thromboxane (Tx) and neutrophils as possible mediators of this event. Recombinant human IL-2, 10(5) U (n = 7), 10(6) U (n = 9), or vehicle (n = 8) were given to anesthetized rats intravenously during a period of 1 hour. At 6 hours edema, as measured by increase in wet to dry weight (w/d) ratio, was present in the heart, liver, and kidney, with 10(5) U IL-2 and in the lung, heart, liver and kidney, with 10(6) U IL-2, relative to values with vehicle-infused controls (all p less than 0.05). With a 1-hour infusion of 10(6) U IL-2, there was an increase in plasma thromboxane (Tx)B2 level to 1290 +/- 245 pg/mL, higher than 481 +/- 93 pg/mL in control rats (p less than 0.05); lung polymorphonuclear leukocyte (PMN) sequestration of 53 +/- 7 PMN/10 higher-power fields (HPF) relative to 23 +/- 2 PMN/10 HPF in controls (p less than 0.05); and increased bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid protein concentration of 1970 +/- 210 micrograms/mL relative to 460 micrograms/mL in controls (p less than 0.05). When 10(6) U IL-2 was given as a 1-minute intravenous bolus (n = 9), edema was not demonstrated, plasma TxB2 levels were similar to controls, there was no leukosequestration, and BAL protein levels were normal. These data indicate that a constant infusion but not the rapid bolus administration of IL-2 produces in rats multiple-system organ edema, increased plasma TxB2, sequestration of PMNs, and microvascular permeability. These findings may explain the early toxicity seen in patients given high-dose IL-2 in cancer treatment. 
5	Herpes simplex keratitis in renal transplant patients. Five out of 430 patients (1.16%) undergoing kidney transplantation developed an atypical clinical picture of herpetic dendritic keratitis within four weeks after surgery. It was manifested by multiple dendrites, located mainly in the corneal periphery or the limbus, developing in relatively uninflamed eyes. The response to acyclovir therapy was prolonged and took at least three weeks. Additionally, subepithelial infiltrates with ultimate scarring developed in all patients. Disciform keratopathy was not found. This clinical course is ascribed to the patients' immunosuppressed state. 
3	A multifocal schwannoma of the masseteric nerve causing hemicrania. A case is reported of schwannoma of the right masseteric nerve, invading the pterygopalatine fossa and the parapharyngeal space through the mandibular notch in a 61-year-old woman. The tumor in this case was composed of four various-sized interconnected nodules, simulating a string of beads. The tumor was the cause of the patient's chronic hemicrania, as confirmed by the relief from and disappearance of head pain after surgical removal of the tumor. The most important aspects of this case are the anatomic site of the schwannoma and its uncommon clinicopathologic manifestations; this tumor originated from the masseteric nerve and is the first case reported to straddle the mandibular notch. 
4	Functional significance of myocardial perfusion defects induced by dipyridamole using thallium-201 single-photon emission computed tomography and two-dimensional echocardiography. The mechanisms responsible for inhomogeneous myocardial blood flow after oral administration of a large dose (300 mg) of dipyridamole were assessed in 27 patients with serial thallium-201 single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) and simultaneous 2-dimensional echocardiograms. Myocardial tomographic images were obtained 50 minutes and 3 to 4 hours after administration of dipyridamole. Two-dimensional echocardiograms were recorded at baseline and then every 15 minutes for 60 minutes. Dipyridamole caused only a mild reduction in blood pressure (from 129 +/- 18 to 126 +/- 16 mm Hg) and a mild increase in heart rate (from 69 +/- 15 to 73 +/- 4 beats/min). Sixteen patients had perfusion defects after dipyridamole by SPECT, which underwent partial or total filling-in. Fourteen of these patients (87.5%) had either a new abnormality or further deterioration of a preexisting wall motion abnormality by 2-dimensional echocardiography, and thus were considered to have developed transient ischemia during dipyridamole administration. Ten of 11 patients (91%) with normal perfusion or fixed defects by SPECT had no further deterioration in wall motion after oral dipyridamole, and were thus considered to have no evidence of myocardial ischemia. In conclusion, most patients with transient thallium-201 defects after dipyridamole develop transient worsening of resting wall motion by 2-dimensional echocardiography, suggestive of true myocardial ischemia. Because myocardial oxygen demand, as indicated by the heart rate-blood pressure product, did not change significantly, the mechanism of myocardial ischemia in these patients is likely to be diminished regional blood flow related to a "subendocardial steal" induced by dipyridamole. 
5	Delivery dependence of early proximal bicarbonate reabsorption in the rat in respiratory acidosis and alkalosis. In the intact rat kidney, bicarbonate reabsorption in the early proximal tubule (EP) is strongly dependent on delivery. Independent of delivery, metabolic acidosis stimulates EP bicarbonate reabsorption. In this study, we investigated whether systemic pH changes induced by acute or chronic respiratory acid-base disorders also affect EP HCO3- reabsorption, independent of delivery (FLHCO3, filtered load of bicarbonate). Hypercapnia was induced in rats acutely (1-3 h) and chronically (4-5 d) by increasing inspired PCO2. Hypocapnia was induced acutely (1-3 h) by mechanical hyperventilation, and chronically (4-5 d) using hypoxemia to stimulate ventilation. When compared with normocapneic rats with similar FLHCO3, no stimulation of EP or overall proximal HCO3 reabsorption was found with either acute hypercapnia (PaCO2 = 74 mmHg, pH = 7.23) or chronic hypercapnia (PaCO2 = 84 mmHg, pH = 7.31). Acute hypocapnia (PaCO2 = 29 mmHg, pH = 7.56) did not suppress EP or overall HCO3 reabsorption. Chronic hypocapnia (PaCO2 = 26 mmHg, pH = 7.54) reduced proximal HCO3 reabsorption, but this effect was reversed when FLHCO3 was increased to levels comparable to euvolemic normocapneic rats. Thus, when delivery is accounted for, we could find no additional stimulation of proximal bicarbonate reabsorption in respiratory acidosis and, except at low delivery rates, no reduction in bicarbonate reabsorption in respiratory alkalosis. 
4	Migraine and vertebrobasilar ischemia. I studied 9 patients with migraine and posterior circulation ischemia. Inclusion criteria were (1) brainstem or cerebellar infarcts or transient ischemic attacks, (2) satisfactory vertebrobasilar angiograms, and (3) migraine. Excluded were patients with only occipital lobe ischemia, known arteriosclerosis, or other nonmigrainous vascular disease. Two women and 7 men, ages 6 to 58 years (mean, 34.7), had transient attacks only (2), single strokes (4), single stroke followed by attacks (1), or multiple strokes (2). Five had antecedent classic, 2 common migraine, and classic migraine began only after the initial ischemic event in the other two. The 7 stroke patients all had CT- or MRI-documented brainstem (4) or cerebellar (6) infarcts. Angiography was normal (3) or demonstrated basilar artery (BA) narrowing (2) or occlusion (4), or branch occlusion (1). In 3 patients the initially occluded BA later reopened. At follow-up (average 4.3 years, range 1 to 9 years), 5 were normal and 4 had important clinical deficits. I conclude that (1) "basilar migraine" is not always benign; it affects both sexes and a wide age range; (2) the pattern of headaches, attacks, and strokes varies; (3) migraine may appear only after ischemia; (4) some patients have BA occlusion or diffuse narrowing; and (5) BA occlusion can be temporary. 
5	Natural evolution of cardiac function, cardiac pathology and antimyosin scan in a murine myocarditis model. Serial technetium-99m radionuclide ventriculograms, indium-111 antimyosin antibody scans and tissue biodistribution studies were performed in C3H/He mice with experimentally induced viral encephalomyocarditis and the results were compared with pathologic assessments of myocardial necrosis. Postinfection ejection fraction decreased on days 10 (20.7 +/- 5.5%, n = 6), 20 (18.6 +/- 15.2%, n = 5), 30 (18.5 +/- 7.7%, n = 5) and 150 (30.0 +/- 18.7, n = 6) (p less than 0.001) in comparison with that in uninfected control mice (63.3 +/- 3.1%, n = 6). In the same group of animals, indium-111 antimyosin antibody scans showed intense positive myocardial accumulation on day 10 (in six of six mice) and only slight accumulation on day 20 (in one of five mice). In the chronic stage, two of five mice on day 30 and two of six mice on day 150 still showed positive uptake. The antimyosin scan myocardium to lung uptake ratio (expressed as mean count density [mean counts/pixel of the region] ratio) increased greatly on day 10 (p less than 0.001 versus values in uninfected control mice) but not subsequently. Biodistribution studies of the indium-111 antimyosin antibody showed that the heart to blood count ratio was significantly higher on day 10 (p less than 0.001 versus values in control mice) but not on days 20, 30 and 150. Pathologic examination showed active and ongoing severe myocardial necrosis with dilated ventricles on day 10. On day 20, there was less active necrosis and healing had appeared to begin. On days 30 and 150, myocardial fibrosis increased. 
4	Native valve endocarditis due to Pseudallescheria boydii in a patient with AIDS: case report and review. A 53-year-old man with AIDS developed mitral valve endocarditis due to infection with the fungus Pseudallescheria boydii. A limited number of cases of prosthetic valve endocarditis caused by this organism have been described. We report a unique case of pseudallescheria infection of a native valve and describe this disease in a patient with AIDS. 
5	Lack of gene deletion for complement C4A deficiency in Japanese patients with systemic lupus erythematosus. The frequency of C4A gene deletion was studied in Japanese patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and was compared with healthy controls. DNA preparations were extracted from peripheral blood leukocytes from 59 patients with SLE and from 166 healthy persons, and digested by restriction enzymes. They were hybridized with C4 complementary DNA by the Southern blotting method and the deletion of C4A gene was judged from restriction fragment length polymorphism. At the same time phenotypic C4A deficiency (C4AQ0) was measured. Our results showed that the frequency of phenotypic C4A deficiency was 44.1% in Japanese patients with SLE and this value was comparable with that (43.2%) in Caucasian patients. On the other hand the deletion of C4A gene was not found in Japanese patients with SLE (0%), or in healthy controls (0.6%). Our results indicate that C4AQ0 may contribute to the pathogenesis of SLE beyond the ethnical differences but Japanese patients with SLE have a different genetic background from Caucasian patients with the C4A gene deleted. 
1	Antigen related to cell proliferation in malignant gliomas recognized by a human monoclonal antibody. A human monoclonal antibody (CLN-IgG) was produced from a human-human hybridoma derived from lymphocytes of a patient with cervical carcinoma. The reactivities of this antibody with various human glioma tissues and cultured glioma cells and the characterization of the antigen recognized by CLN-IgG on malignant glioma cells were analyzed and reported. CLN-IgG reacted with various human glioma cells and glioma tissues, especially glioblastoma, but did not react with normal brain tissues or fetal brain tissues. A large amount of antigen recognized by CLN-IgG was expressed on cell membranes of undifferentiated glioma cells and of glioma cells at the G2/M tumor growth phase in cycling cells. Antigen recognized by CLN-IgG was detected in only one of seven samples of cyst fluid, and was not detected in 27 serum samples or 18 samples of cerebrospinal fluid from glioma patients. CLN-IgG exhibited antibody-dependent cell cytotoxicity against U-25 1 MG glioma cells and primary cultured cells of glioblastomas and anaplastic astrocytomas. These data suggest that the antigen recognized by CLN-IgG might be related to cell proliferation in malignant gliomas. Thus, CLN-IgG might be useful for immunotherapy or immunoimaging of malignant gliomas. 
3	Rett syndrome: cerebellar pathology. The cerebellar pathology at autopsy of 5 patients with Rett syndrome is described. The patients ranged in age from 7-30 years. All had markedly reduced brain weights with proportionately small cerebella. Microscopic examination revealed loss of Purkinje cells, atrophy, astrocytic gliosis of the molecular and granular cell layers, and gliosis and loss of myelin in the white matter. Cortical atrophy occurred focally along the folia and was often more marked in the tips of the folia. The 2 oldest patients had been treated with phenytoin which may have contributed to the morphologic changes. Atrophy and gliosis increased with age or in patients without phenytoin treatment; the youngest patient demonstrated only minor microscopic changes. In addition to the generalized alterations, 1 patient had several adjacent folia with severe atrophy. The results indicate that cerebellar changes in Rett syndrome consist of general hypoplasia with the addition of atrophy beginning in childhood and progressing over many years. 
5	Positive and negative regulation of proliferation and differentiation in tracheobronchial epithelial cells. The lung (in particular the bronchial epithelium) is a major site for tumor formation in humans. Environmental factors in conjunction with genetic factors are important determinants in this disease. The acquisition of defects in the control of proliferation and differentiation appears to constitute crucial steps in the transition of a normal to a neoplastic cell. Several factors have been identified that control positively or negatively the proliferation and differentiation of tracheobronchial epithelial cells. These factors include EGF/TGF alpha, TGF beta, insulin/IGFI, KGF, certain cytokines, retinoids, and activators of protein kinase C. Studies with neoplastic cells have identified several protooncogenes and tumor suppressor genes whose gene products are involved in the regulation of cell growth of normal tracheobronchial epithelial cells, and when mutated, lost, or activated, bring about a neoplastic phenotype. Future studies on the precise function of these genes will help to elucidate the mechanisms by which proliferation and differentiation in normal tracheobronchial epithelial cells are regulated and help to understand the molecular changes involved in diseases such as cancer. 
5	Complications in hyperthermia treatment of benign prostatic hyperplasia. Of 435 patients treated with local hyperthermia to the prostate 27 had 29 complications, for an over-all complication rate of 6.6%. Urinary tract infections (7 cases), hematuria (6), and epididymitis (2) accounted for roughly half of the complications and could be attributed to the insertion of a catheter rather than the treatment itself but this remains to be proved. Most of the complications occurred within the first 3 treatment sessions. Despite the complication, 9 patients continued and completed the treatment course. Mean age of the study group was 73 +/- 8.3 years. Given the age of these patients, high incidence of accompanying diseases and low rate of complications, local hyperthermia should be considered a viable low risk treatment option in patients with benign prostatic hyperplasia. 
3	Risk of dementia in first-degree relatives of patients with Alzheimer's disease and related disorders. First-degree relatives of patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD) are at greater risk for dementia when compared with the relatives of their healthy peers, but not when compared with the relatives of patients with Parkinson's disease. This may indicate that the risk of dementia in these relatives is not specific to AD or that these studies are biased. We obtained a family history and vital status information on each first-degree relative of patients attending a clinic and in a group of recruited healthy elderly subjects. Patients formed two groups: probable AD and other forms of dementia or cognitive disorders without dementia. The odds of dementia in first-degree relatives did not differ between patient groups. The odds of dementia in relatives of patients with probable AD or other forms of dementia was six times that in the relatives of the healthy elderly subjects. The cumulative incidence of dementia increased with age in the first-degree relatives of all subjects. Approximately 50% of the first-degree relatives of patients with AD were demented by age 91 years, but almost the same number of the other patient group's relatives were demented as well. That figure was never reached in the healthy elderly subject's relatives. Because the risk of dementia in first-degree relatives of patients with AD was similar to that for patients with other disorders, we cannot exclude the possibility that this is the result of selection and information biases. Our investigation implies that the increased risk of dementia may not be specific to relatives of patients with AD; the risk may also be increased in first-degree relatives of patients with other neurologic disorders. 
5	Spontaneous and steroid-induced recurrence of endometriosis after suppression by a gonadotropin-releasing hormone antagonist in the rat. Recurrent endometriosis in women is difficult to study because of the ethical consideration of performing repeated surgeries. Previously in the rat model we described therapeutic regression of endometriosis with the gonadotropin-releasing hormone antagonist antide. Presently we report the spontaneous and steroid-induced recurrence of endometriosis after withdrawal from antide therapy. Rats with endometriosis received antide or vehicle on days 0 (proestrus), 3, 6, and 9 and were killed on days 0, 6, 12, 18, 24, 30, and 42 (n = 4 antide-treated and 4 vehicle-treated rats killed per day). Additional antide-treated rats (n = 4 per treatment) received estrogen, progesterone, both estrogen and progesterone, cholesterol, and no steroid on day 9 and were killed on day 12. Antide significantly suppressed endometriotic implant size on days 12, 18, and 24. However, implant size spontaneously returned to pretreatment values by day 30. Administration of steroids on day 9 elicited regrowth of antide-suppressed endometriosis (estrogen plus progesterone greater than estrogen, progesterone, or cholesterol greater than no steroid) by day 12. This resilience of endometriosis offers an explanation for treatment failure and recurrence of the disease in women. 
1	Prothymosin alpha antisense oligomers inhibit myeloma cell division. The function of prothymosin alpha has been investigated by using four different antisense oligodeoxyribonucleotides directed at selected regions of its mRNA. In every case, when synchronized human myeloma cells were released from stationary phase by incubation in fresh medium containing antisense oligomers, cell division was prevented or inhibited; sense oligomers and random antisense oligomers had no effect. A detailed analysis of synchronized cell populations indicated that sense-treated and untreated cells divided approximately 17 hr after growth initiation, whereas cells incubated with antisense oligomer 183, a 16-mer targeted 5 bases downstream of the initiation codon, entered mitosis approximately one cell division late. The failure to divide correlated directly with a deficit in prothymosin alpha and with the continued presence of intact intracellular antisense oligomers over a period of at least 24 hr. Because antisense oligomers had no effect either on the timing of the induction of prothymosin alpha mRNA upon growth stimulation or on mRNA levels seen throughout the cell cycle, we concluded that antisense DNA caused specific hybrid arrest of translation. Our data suggest that prothymosin alpha is required for cell division. However, there is no evidence that prothymosin alpha directly regulates mitosis. 
5	The effect of improved cementing techniques on component loosening in total hip replacement. An 11-year radiographic review. Improved cementing techniques have been shown to decrease the rate of aseptic loosening of femoral components of cemented total hip replacements at five to seven years. We now report our results in 105 hips in 93 patients at 10 to 12.7 years (mean 11.2). The improved techniques included use of a medullary plug, a cement gun, a doughy mix of Simplex P and a collared stem of chrome cobalt. Only three femoral components had definitely loosened, none were probably loose and 24 were graded as possibly loose. In contrast, the incidence of radiographic loosening on the acetabular side was 42%. Improved cementing techniques have produced a marked reduction in the rate of aseptic loosening of the femoral component, but the incidence of acetabular loosening is unchanged. 
5	The modified superior based pharyngeal flap. Part III. A retrospective study. A retrospective study of 31 patients who had diagnosed velopharyngeal incompetence and were surgically managed with the modified superior based pharyngeal flap was completed. The following were analyzed: age at time of operation, gender, physical status, diagnostic protocol, length of operation (length of total surgery) and length of superior based pharyngeal flap, length of postoperative hospital stay, length of total hospital stay, length of follow-up, speech results, complications, patient care, and medication. The result showed that the optimal timing for correction of velopharyngeal incompetence was between 3 and 6 years of age. The mean length of total hospital stay was 2.7 days, postoperative complications were minimal, and speech results were generally good. 
2	Duodenal stricture: a complication of chronic fibrocalcific pancreatitis. Over the past 10 years, one of us (M.C.A.) has treated 92 patients who required operation for symptoms associated with alcohol-induced chronic fibrocalcific pancreatitis. Four of these patients had duodenal obstruction. All four had had lateral pancreaticojejunostomy to relieve pancreatic ductal obstruction and associated chronic abdominal pain; three of the four also required biliary diversion for stenosis of the intrapancreatic portion of the common bile duct. Each duodenal stricture required reoperation and gastrojejunostomy to bypass the site of obstruction. A review of the English language literature revealed that duodenal obstruction in patients with chronic fibrocalcific pancreatitis is uncommon, only 58 previous cases having been reported. All of those patients had pancreatic ductal obstruction, and more than half had concomitant distal biliary stenosis. Two thirds of the duodenal obstructions were treated by gastroenterostomy, and one third were resected. Duodenal obstruction in patients with chronic pancreatitis and biliary stricture appears to reflect an advanced form of the disease. Combined lateral pancreaticojejunostomy and biliary diversion has emerged as the preferred surgical procedure for this problem. Careful preoperative assessment for evidence of duodenal stenosis also is needed in this group of patients, and gastroenterostomy is indicated in appropriate cases. 
3	Spinal anaesthesia in day-care surgery with a 26-gauge needle. We studied 106 day-care surgical patients (52 male) aged 18-70 yr (mean 49.6 yr) who received spinal anaesthesia with a 26-gauge spinal needle. The incidence of headache, back pain and patient acceptability were investigated after operation using a questionnaire. The incidence of postspinal headache was 7.5%, and 11.3% of patients developed back pain. One patient remained in hospital because of hypotension and dizziness. There were no major complications and patient acceptability was almost 100%. We conclude that spinal anaesthesia for day-care surgery is easy to perform and cost effective. 
3	Reliability of death certificate diagnoses. Consistency between death certificates and clinical records from 5 general hospitals in Kuwait was studied for 470 deaths with the following underlying or associated causes: hypertensive (HYP), ischaemic heart diseases (IHD), cerebrovascular diseases (CVD) and diabetes mellitus (DM). Direct causes were not considered since they are of little interest analytically. Only deaths with definite or most probable ascertainment were included. One cardiologist, who was provided with the WHO criteria and relevant documents on death certification, independently reviewed the records. To test the reviewer's bias and the reliability of his judgement, an adjudication process was effected by having one senior cardiologist re-review a random subsample of 140 records. The two reviewers showed good agreement. Specific diagnoses criteria for deciding the underlying cause of death in multiple morbid conditions by the reviewer were followed. Due to possible reviewer bias, we aimed at measuring the difference between initial certifiers and the reviewer rather than measuring the diagnostic accuracy of initial certifiers in reference to the reviewer. The agreement index kappa showed poor agreement between original and revised certificates. The original certificates under-estimated CVD as an underlying cause of death by 69.2%, DM by 60%, IHD by 33.5% and HYP by 31.8% in our sample. Associated causes were also consistently under-estimated by initial certifiers as compared with the reviewer. This bias calls for basing mortality statistics in Kuwait on hospital death committees' reports rather than on initial certifier death certificates, use of multiple-causes of death instead of one underlying cause and adequate training of the medical profession on the value and process of death certification. 
3	Temporal bone findings in two cases of head injury. Temporal bone findings in two cases of head injury are reported. In one patient, longitudinal fractures occurred in both temporal bones, and extended to the middle ear bilaterally. Bleeding was seen in the tympanic cavity, mastoid air cells, internal auditory meatus and facial nerve canal. Bleeding was observed in the scala tympani, cochlear aqueduct and endolymphatic sac, but there were no fractures. In the other patient, bleeding was seen in the internal auditory meatus and facial nerve canal. In the right ear, endolymphatic hydrops was observed in all turns of the cochlea. 
2	Pancreaticobiliary ductal union. The main pancreatic duct and the common bile duct open into the second part of the duodenum alone or after joining as a common channel. A common channel of greater than 15 mm (an anomalous pancreaticobiliary duct) is associated with congenital cystic dilatation of the common bile duct and carcinoma of the gall bladder. Even a long common channel (greater than or equal to 8 mm) is associated with a higher frequency of carcinoma of the gall bladder. Gall stones smaller than the common channel and a long common channel predispose to gall stone induced acute pancreatitis. Separate openings for the two ductal systems predisposes to development of gall stones and alcohol induced chronic pancreatitis. The role of ductal union has also been investigated in primary sclerosing cholangitis and biliary atresia. 
2	24-hour intragastric acidity and plasma gastrin after omeprazole treatment and after proximal gastric vagotomy in duodenal ulcer patients The relationship between suppressed gastric acidity and the increase in plasma gastrin levels after pharmacological and surgical treatment of peptic ulcer disease were compared in this study. Eight patients with chronic duodenal ulcer and referred for proximal gastric vagotomy were studied. 24-hour intragastric acidity and plasma gastrin levels were investigated in the same patients on three consecutive occasions: preentry without any treatment; after 4 weeks of administration of 20 mg of omeprazole daily, and 4-6 months after proximal gastric vagotomy. Intragastric acidity was slightly more reduced by omeprazole (94%) than after proximal gastric vagotomy (78%), with no difference found during the day or night with either. Plasma gastrin levels increased slightly more after proximal gastric vagotomy [284% (median, 2120 pmol.h/L; range, 733-2831 pmol.h/L)] than after omeprazole administration [186% (median, 1586 pmol.h/L; range, 495-2573 pmol.h/L)]. There is strong evidence that the increased plasma gastrin concentration following omeprazole treatment is caused by the reduced intragastric acidity. The slight increase in plasma gastrin concentration following proximal gastric vagotomy despite a lesser reduction in intragastric acidity may be the result of additional effects on gastrin release by the vagotomy. Both treatments resulted in a modest increase in plasma levels of gastrin that were far below the gastrin levels observed in achlorhydric patients, e.g., patients with pernicious anemia. 
4	Patch aortotomy for aortic valve replacement after previous coronary artery bypass grafting. Exposure for aortic valve operations after previous coronary artery bypass grafting may be technically difficult owing to the presence of patent vein grafts on the proximal aorta. A patch or "island" aortotomy technique that allows excellent exposure of the aortic valve is presented here. In select patients this approach may facilitate cardioplegia administration. 
1	Colonic lipomas: outcome of endoscopic removal. Colonic lipomas are benign adipose tumors which are usually submucosal. With the increase in the number of endoscopic procedures being performed, these tumors are often detected incidentally at colonoscopy. Although the risks of removing these tumors have been recognized, numerous reports have documented safe removal by snare electrocautery. We have reviewed the clinical outcome and the endoscopic and histopathologic features of seven lipomas that were endoscopically removed over a 5-year period. Four patients recovered uneventfully, while three patients (42.8%) developed colonic perforation after the polypectomy. In the latter group, the lipomas were significantly larger than they were in the patients who did not develop colonic perforation (1.9 +/- 0.4 and 4.2 +/- 0.7 cm, respectively; p = 0.048). Furthermore, the polypectomy specimens from those patients who developed perforation all contained significant muscularis propria. Lipomatous polyps that are identified at endoscopy to be greater than or equal to 2 cm in diameter and to have a limited pedicle are at the greatest risk for endoscopic perforation. 
1	A prospective study of magnetic resonance imaging in lymphoma staging. In this prospective study, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was compared with computed tomography (CT) in patients with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHDL), and with CT and laparotomy in patients with Hodgkin's disease (HD). Among 31 patients with NHDL, there was agreement between MRI and CT findings in 21 patients; MRI findings were positive and CT findings were negative in 8 patients; and MRI findings were negative and CT findings were positive in 2 patients. The false-negative findings of MRI included a laparotomy-proven mesenteric mass and a 6.6-cm lesion in the spleen, both shown by CT. In 13 evaluable patients with HD, there was agreement between MRI and laparotomy findings in 8 patients; MRI findings were positive and laparotomy findings were negative in 4 patients; and MRI findings were negative and laparotomy findings were positive in 1 patient. CT findings agreed with laparotomy findings in nine patients; CT findings were positive and laparotomy findings were negative in one patient: and CT findings were negative and laparotomy findings were positive in three patients. This suggested that MRI, although more sensitive than CT, was less specific with more false-positive findings. The spin-lattice relaxation time (T1) for the spleen was generally higher in patients with HD who had pathologically confirmed splenic involvement, and tended to increase with increasing spleen weight. This study was performed on a prototype 0.15 Tesla (Technicare Inc., Solon, OH) resistive unit at a time when methods and reporting for MRI were still being developed. Although MRI appears to have fewer false-negative findings than CT in evaluating the abdomen of lymphoma patients, the lack of a gastrointestinal contrast agent and specificity of T1 elevations in the spleen would not suggest that MRI could replace CT or laparotomy as a staging technique. 
1	Medroxyprogesterone acetate lowers plasma corticotropin and cortisol but does not suppress anterior pituitary responsiveness to human corticotropin releasing factor. The endocrine action of medroxyprogesterone acetate (MPA) has been claimed to be of a glucocorticoid-like nature. Upon clinical observation, MPA has been shown to improve life quality and overall well-being in patients with advanced breast cancer, renal carcinoma, prostatic carcinoma, and uterine adenocarcinoma. The authors have evaluated MPA endocrine action by the administration of human corticotropin releasing factor (hCRF) in a 90-minute assay in 15 patients with advanced breast cancer or renal cell carcinoma both, before the initiation of oral high-dose MPA treatment (1000 mg MPA) as well as after at least 10 days of therapy. The curves for corticotropin, beta-endorphin, and cortisol responses to hCRF of tumor patients who were tested before the initiation of MPA treatment were parallel to the curves of a healthy control group of probands tested under equal conditions, although at significantly higher respective hormone levels. In patients with malignant disorders assayed after MPA administration, both basal and peak hormone levels were found to be comparable with values obtained in healthy controls. In conclusion, MPA appeared to act at a suprapituitary level since pituitary responsiveness to hCRF was preserved under MPA treatment. Moreover, it appeared that MPA brought the hormonal stress state found in patients with malignant tumors back to normal. 
1	Complete follow-up and evaluation of a skin cancer screening in Connecticut. On May 21, 1988, 251 persons were screened for skin cancer in New Haven, Connecticut. A total body skin examination was performed on 98% of the participants. On the basis of follow-up of 93% of persons with positive screens for basal cell carcinoma, squamous cell carcinoma, or Bowen's disease, positive predictive values were 43% for basal cell carcinoma, 14% for squamous cell carcinoma, and 50% for Bowen's disease. In the group with atypical nevi, a person with two or more clinically atypical nevi was 16 times more likely to have histologic confirmation than a person with a single clinically atypical nevus (p = 0.003). Eighty persons were screened by both a dermatologist and a dermatology nurse; the crude agreement rate for actinic keratoses was 0.62; for atypical nevi, 0.53; and for BCC, 0.88. Both nurses and physicians overdiagnosed in the screening setting, the nurses more so than the physicians. Of the 128 persons screened who were advised to seek medical follow-up, 16 did not do so despite several reminders; their reasons are discussed. 
1	Clinical prognostic factors in patients with posterior uveal malignant melanoma. The authors evaluated the prognostic value of clinically assessed variables for predicting length of survival until death from metastatic disease in 237 patient with a primary choroidal or ciliary body melanoma. Using multivariate Cox proportional hazards modeling, the authors identified the largest linear basal tumor diameter (mm), estimated by indirect ophthalmoscopy and fundus drawing, the location of the anterior margin of the tumor relative to the ocular equator and ora serrata, and the age of the patient at the time of treatment as the best combination of the clinically assessed variables for predicting survival. For each patient in this group, the authors computed a prognostic index based on the best multivariate Cox model. They showed that patients with low, intermediate, and high values of prognostic index had low, intermediate, and high melanoma-related mortality rates, respectively, during the first 5 to 8 posttreatment years. These results suggest that: (1) clinically assessed variables evaluated according to a standardized protocol are useful for predicting the survival of treated patients with posterior uveal melanoma and (2) ophthalmologists who assess potential clinical prognostic variables consistently may identify subgroups of patients with comparable mortality risk on the basis of noninvasive testing. 
1	Effect of tamoxifen on serum insulinlike growth factor I levels in stage I breast cancer patients. Insulinlike growth factor I (IGF-I) has been shown to be a potent mitogen for breast cancer cells in vitro, and IGF-I receptors have been demonstrated on human primary breast neoplasms. In a randomized, placebo-controlled study, we document that administration of the antiestrogen tamoxifen to patients with breast cancer was associated with a statistically significant (P = .002) reduction in the serum level of IGF-I. The mean IGF-I level was 1.4 U/mL in the placebo-treated group and 0.9 U/mL in the tamoxifen-treated group. Because serum IGF-I level is growth hormone (GH) dependent and because data suggest that the pubertal surge in GH and IGF-I levels is sex steroid dependent, we speculate that the mechanism underlying our observation may involve blockade by tamoxifen of estrogen action in the hypothalamic-pituitary axis. We conclude that tamoxifen treatment reduces IGF-I levels and that this reduction may contribute to the therapeutic effect of the drug. 
2	Extracellular matrix gene expression increases preferentially in rat lipocytes and sinusoidal endothelial cells during hepatic fibrosis in vivo. Whether parenchymal or nonparenchymal liver cells play a predominant role in the pathophysiology of hepatic fibrosis has not been firmly established in vivo. We have addressed this question by quantitating the relative abundance of specific mRNAs for collagen types I, III, and IV, and laminin in purified populations of hepatocytes, sinusoidal endothelial cells, and lipocytes from normal and fibrotic rat liver. In normal liver, type I collagen gene expression was minimal in all cell types; mRNA for types III and IV collagen were apparent in endothelial cells and lipocytes, but not in hepatocytes. Laminin mRNA was present in all cell types. Induction of fibrogenesis by either bile duct ligation or carbon tetrachloride administration was associated with a substantial increase in mRNA for types I and III collagen in nonparenchymal cells. Lipocytes from fibrotic animals exhibited a greater than 30-fold increase in type I collagen mRNA relative to normal lipocytes, and greater than 40-fold relative to hepatocytes. Type III collagen mRNA reached 5 times that in normal lipocytes and greater than 120 times that in hepatocytes. Endothelial cells exhibited an isolated increase in type I collagen mRNA, reaching five times that in normal liver. Type IV collagen and laminin gene expression were not significantly increased in nonparenchymal cells during fibrogenesis; in fact, mRNA for type IV collagen and laminin decreased by up to 50% in endothelial cells. Despite the pronounced changes that occurred in matrix gene expression in nonparenchymal cells during fibrogenesis, no change was noted in hepatocytes. We conclude that nonparenchymal liver cells, particularly lipocytes, are important effectors of hepatic fibrosis in vivo. 
1	Oncogene amplification in breast cancer. To refine the analysis of gene amplification in breast cancer, the authors have developed sensitive methods that can be used to screen nucleic acid prepared from a variety of sources. In their analysis, Southern hybridization and DNA dot-blot analysis were used to screen 49 breast cancer DNAs for Myc, Neu, and Int-2 gene amplification. The analysis detected minimal one extra gene copy) as well as expanded (two or more extra gene copies) gene amplifications, and in addition, distinguished between gene amplification and aneuploidy as the cause of extra gene copies. These quantitative methods were adapted to patient specimens routinely available in the anatomic pathology laboratory, including fresh tumor tissue, tumor nuclei discarded during estrogen receptor analysis, and paraffin blocks. One minimal gene amplification was found in three cases of intraductal cancer. Of 25 cases of nonmetastatic invasive cancer, 28% had at least one extra Myc gene, whereas 24% had Neu, and 21% had Int-2 gene amplification. Of 21 cases of metastatic invasive cancer, 43% had Myc, 43% had Neu, and 40% had Int-2 gene amplification. Among the nonmetastatic cancers, 47% had one, 12% had two, and 4% had three amplified genes. Within the metastatic cancers, 48% had one, 28% had two, and 5% had three amplified genes. Our data suggest relationships between tumor progression and both incidence and size of Myc, Neu, and Int-2 gene amplification. 
5	Upper tract tumours following cystectomy for bladder cancer. Is routine intravenous urography worthwhile? The incidence and presentation of upper tract tumours were studied in 180 patients who had previously undergone cystectomy for transitional cell carcinoma of the bladder. Intravenous urography was performed routinely 3 months after cystectomy, 1 year later and at 3-yearly intervals thereafter. Ten patients developed upper tract tumours; 1 presented with loin pain and the remainder with haematuria. Six patients underwent nephroureterectomy and 5 of them lived for at least 4 years; 4 were inoperable and only 1 survived longer than 6 months. In this series, all patients with upper tract tumours presented with symptoms and routine intravenous urography failed to detect any asymptomatic lesions. Routine radiological assessment of the upper tracts to detect tumours is not justified following cystectomy. 
5	Idiopathic scoliosis and asymmetry of form and function. This report investigates dimensions of hand and foot preference in 159 girls with idiopathic scoliosis diagnosed after the age of 8 years, 1,522 girls with clinically straight spines, and 132 with minor truncal asymmetry. It was found that, although there was no significant difference in hand or foot preference for individual items between scoliotic groups and controls, there was a statistically significant tendency for children with any degree of asymmetry to show uniform lateralization in the sense of consistency of side preference. Another, smaller group showed a tendency for scoliosis to be associated with clearly visible facial asymmetry, which itself correlated with handedness. It was concluded that theories of scoliosis need to include the frequently ignored minor observations, such as the well-known fact of lateralization of the curve, if they are to describe the condition completely. Because the asymmetry of cerebral lateralization is known to be genetically determined and because it is thought to result in other skeletal asymmetries, such as skull and limb inequality, it seemed reasonable to investigate the primary cause of that gross asymmetry, idiopathic scoliosis. 
2	Autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease--more than a renal disease. Autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) is the most common genetic disease, affecting a half million Americans. The clinical phenotype can result from at least two different gene defects. One gene that can cause ADPKD has been located on the short arm of chromosome 16. This discovery has made possible new methods for diagnosing the disorder in gene carriers prior to the development of renal cysts. Although renal cysts are clearly an important manifestation of the gene defect, other systemic manifestations are both common and clinically important. Cardiac valvular lesions, intracranial aneurysms, hepatic cysts, and diverticula are included in the array of systemic manifestations. Moreover, renal cysts are only one of a myriad of renal manifestations. Although ADPKD was long considered an adult cystic disease, it is also a common cause of childhood cystic disease and must be considered in the differential diagnosis in that setting. 
5	Immunochemical characterization and quantitative distribution of pancreatic stone protein in sera and pancreatic secretions in pancreatic disorders. A fluorometric immunoassay has been established to quantitate pancreatic stone protein providing a sensitivity for concentrations from 0.015 to 0.5 micrograms/mL. When concentrations of pancreatic stone protein were determined from pancreatic secretions obtained either from patients suffering from chronic pancreatitis (n = 31) [including the calcifying forms (n = 10)], pancreatic cancer (n = 22), or nonpancreatic diseases (n = 17), no significant differences were found. In contrast, increased concentrations were found in serum samples from patients with chronic (39/66) and acute pancreatitis (16/20) compared with control patients. The differences between these diagnostic groups and controls were highly significant (P less than 0.0001) and independent of pancreatic enzyme activity. Immunochemical analyses of serum pancreatic stone protein showed an isoelectric point (pH 9) similar to that reported for the pancreatic thread protein. With respect to recent communications, these data do not support the etiopathogenic role postulated for pancreatic stone protein in chronic pancreatitis and chronic calcifying pancreatitis by other investigators. 
4	Pericarditis with tamponade due to cytomegalovirus in the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome. A 35-year-old male homosexual with AIDS presented with headache and fever and was found to have cryptococcal meningitis. During the patient's hospital course, his hemodynamic status deteriorated as a result of pericardial tamponade. Antemortem analysis of the fluid was unrevealing; however, postmortem examination of the pericardium revealed typical intranuclear inclusions of cytomegalovirus infection. Cytomegalovirus should be included in the differential diagnosis of pericardial effusion in patients with AIDS. 
2	Should safety concerns with available ulcer treatment influence drug selection? With the identification of the parietal cell receptors for gastric acid secretion coupled with the introduction of cimetidine in 1977, treatment of acid-peptic diseases was transformed from empiric therapy to an approach based on a clearer understanding of human physiology. Today, physicians are confronted with an array of antiulcer agents that differ within their drug class (e.g., the H2-receptor antagonists) as well as in their mechanisms of action (e.g., neutralize acid, alter mucosal defensive factors, or suppress acid secretion). With minor exceptions, the clinical efficacy of the available antiulcer drugs can be regarded as comparable. Thus, the safety profile becomes the next consideration when choosing among similarly effective drug products. Of the available antiulcer agents, the H2-receptor antagonists as a class have an excellent safety profile, as indicated by more than 25 years of cumulative clinical experience and postmarketing surveillance. Important safety issues with currently available antiulcer drugs, i.e., H2-receptor antagonists, sucralfate, prostaglandin E analogues, and the newest antiulcer agent, omeprazole, are reviewed to place them into perspective for the clinician. 
1	Treatment of advanced neuroblastoma with I-131 meta-iodobenzylguanidine. From February 1986 to December 1988, 31 children with advanced pretreated neuroblastoma were treated with 131-I meta-Iodobenzylguanidine (131-MIBG). Thirteen children had been resistant to first-line therapy, three had suffered a local relapse, and fourteen had suffered a disseminated relapse without over bone marrow infiltration. One child was treated initially because of resistance to first-line therapy, and subsequently for a local relapse. A total of 72 courses of 131-MIBG was administered, with doses ranging from 2.8 to 6.0 GBq (median, 3.7 GBq). One child received five courses, two four courses, 13 three courses, four two courses, and 12 one course of 131-MIBG. The most common toxic effect was thrombocytopenia, with a platelet level of less than 50,000/cmm occurring after 19 of 60 evaluable courses. A leukocyte count less than 1000/cmm was seen only once. There were six major responses (two complete) lasting 4 to 9 months, and two minor responses lasting longer than 38 and 44 months. Responses were seen more commonly in children whose only lesion was a residual primary tumor and in children who had not been pretreated who experienced disseminated relapse. Further studies of the role of 131-I meta-Iodobenzylguanidine in treatment of neuroblastoma are needed. 
1	Cryptic osteoid osteoma of the cranium: case report. Osteoid osteoma is an uncommon benign tumor of bone that rarely involves the cranium. If often causes local pain that is worse at night, characteristically relieved by aspirin, and does not correlate with the size of the lesion. The diagnosis depends on skull radiographs and computed tomography. This report describes a case in which radiographs showed nothing abnormal. The diagnosis and operative localization were accomplished with radionuclide bone scanning. Thus, the possibility of radiographically cryptic lesions must be considered in the evaluation of atypical head pain syndromes. 
5	Amyloidosis associated bleeding diatheses in the surgical patient. The coagulopathies associated with amyloidosis have not been widely appreciated. We encountered a patient with amyloidosis and mildly abnormal coagulation studies who presented for an emergency laparotomy for acute bowel obstruction. Upon gentle manipulation of the bowel, an unexpected bleeding diathesis was manifested by the formation of several large haematomas resulting in a large amount of blood loss (approximately 800 ml). Numerous defects of platelet function and coagulation have been associated with amyloidosis, including abnormal platelet aggregation, increased vascular fragility, factor IX and X deficiencies, decreased levels of alpha-2-plasmin inhibitor, and increased levels of plasminogen. Intraoperative therapy for our patient included the rapid administration of four units of fresh frozen plasma and ten units of platelet concentrate. A review of the pathology and therapeutic modalities for this potentially life-threatening complication is presented. 
5	Endoscopic sclerotherapy in extrahepatic portal hypertension in pregnancy. Extrahepatic portal hypertension usually occurs during childhood, but a substantial number of patients may reach adult life. There is a general agreement that pregnancy may become hazardous to these patients, and some authors even consider this condition as a contraindication to conceiving. A case of endoscopic sclerotherapy in such a patient is herein presented, and the approach to such patients is discussed. 
4	Visual loss with dancing extremities and mental disturbances. A case is reported of a teenage girl, who presented with a profound loss of vision in the right eye, secondary to retinal vasculitis. During the preceding year, a gradual change in her personality had been noted, associated with a deterioration in her intellect. She developed an area of pigment epithelial disturbance in the macular region of the right eye, and subsequently, optic atrophy. One year after this, she had a similar, but more localized episode in the left eye. She later developed involuntary movements, and two years after initial presentation, a diagnosis of subacute sclerosing panencephalitis was made. Subsequently her clinical condition deteriorated rapidly and she died. Post-mortem examination confirmed the diagnosis of subacute sclerosing panencephalitis. This case demonstrates the insidious nature of the disease and suggests that the diagnosis of subacute sclerosing panencephalitis should be considered in any child or young adult who presents with unexplained retinal vasculitis, maculopathy or chorioretinitis. 
5	Enhanced activity of the free radical producing enzyme xanthine oxidase in hypoxic rat liver. Regulation and pathophysiologic significance. It has been widely proposed that conversion of xanthine dehydrogenase (XDH) to its free radical-producing form, xanthine oxidase (XOD), underlies ischemic/reperfusion injury, although the relationship of this conversion to hypoxia and its physiologic control have not been defined. This study details the time course and control of this enzymatic interconversion. In a functionally intact, isolated perfused rat liver model, mean % XOD activity increased as a function of both the duration (25 to 45% in 3 h) and degree (r = 0.97) of hypoxia. This process was markedly accelerated in ischemic liver by an overnight fast (45 vs. 30% at 2 h), and by imposing a short period of in vivo ischemia (cardiopulmonary arrest 72%). Moreover, only under these conditions was there a significant rise in the XOD activity due to the conformationally altered XDH molecule (XODc, 18%), as well as concomitant morphologic injury. Neither circulating white blood cells nor thrombosis appeared to contribute to the effects of in vivo ischemia on enzyme conversion. Thus, it is apparent that conversion to the free radical-producing state, with high levels of XOD activity and concurrent cellular injury, can be achieved during a relatively short period of hypoxia under certain well-defined physiologic conditions, in a time course consistent with its purported role in modulating reperfusion injury. These data also suggest that the premorbid condition of organ donors (e.g., nutritional status and relative state of hypoxia) is important in achieving optimal organ preservation. 
1	Treatment of patients with isolated axillary nodal metastases from an occult primary carcinoma consistent with breast origin. The records of 42 patients who had axillary metastases compatible with a clinically occult breast primary were reviewed. Forty patients had mammography performed as part of their evaluations. Mastectomy yielded the primary tumor in one of 13 patients; biopsy yielded positive results in one of five. Among the 29 patients who did not undergo mastectomy, 16 received breast irradiation, and 13 were simply observed for signs of the primary tumor. For the patients who did not undergo mastectomy, the 5-year actuarial risk for appearance of a primary was 17% in the irradiated group versus 57% in the nonirradiated group (P = 0.06). Patterns of failure are correlated with stage and local and systemic therapy. The results affirm our belief that patients with axillary metastases histologically consistent with breast tumor should be treated identically to patients with similar nodal stages and proven breast primaries. 
5	A variant of arteriovenous fistulas within the wall of dural sinuses. Results of combined surgical and endovascular therapy. Dural arteriovenous (AV) fistulas are thought to be acquired lesions that form in an area of thrombosis within a sinus. If the sinus remains completely thrombosed, venous drainage from these lesions occurs through cortical veins, or, if the sinus is open, venous drainage is usually into the involved sinus. Among 105 patients with dural AV fistulas evaluated over the the past 5 years, seven had a unique type of dural AV fistula in the superior sagittal, transverse, or straight sinus in which only cortical venous drainage occurred despite a patent involved sinus; the fistula was located within the wall of a patent dural sinus, but outflow was not into the involved sinus. This variant of dural AV fistulas puts the patient at serious risk for hemorrhage or neurological dysfunction caused by venous hypertension. Three patients presented with hemorrhage, one with progressive neurological dysfunction, one with seizures, and two with bruit and headaches. A combination of surgical and endovascular techniques was used to close the fistula while preserving flow through the sinus. 
4	Prevalence and determinants of estrogen replacement therapy in elderly women. To better understand which women use estrogen replacement therapy, we examined the prevalence and determinants of estrogen replacement therapy in 9704 nonblack women, age greater than or equal to 65 years, who participated in the multicenter prospective Study of Osteoporotic Fractures. Overall, 13.7% of women reported current use of oral estrogen; 10.9% took estrogen alone and 2.8% took estrogen opposed by progestin. Four percent currently used parenteral estrogen compounds. Current use declined sharply with age from 17% at age 65 to 4% at age greater than or equal to 85. The primary determinant of estrogen replacement therapy was the type of menopause; the odds of using estrogen replacement therapy in current users compared with never users were approximately five times higher in women with a surgical menopause. Estrogen use was more common among women who had higher levels of education and were less obese. Furthermore, estrogen replacement therapy users were more likely to drink alcohol and to participate in sports and recreation. A diagnosis of osteoporosis was the major determinant of continued estrogen use, but only 24% of women with a diagnosis of osteoporosis used estrogen replacement therapy. We conclude that only a small proportion of elderly women in the United States use estrogen replacement therapy. Selection factors for use of estrogen are evident and may introduce bias in studies of estrogen and disease. In consideration of the distribution of these selection factors, estrogen users will tend to be at lower risk of coronary disease and possibly breast cancer but at greater risk for hip fractures. 
5	Recurrent acute glomerulonephritis. Biopsy-proven recurrent acute glomerulonephritis (AGN) is extremely rare and is usually seen in children with acute, well-defined streptococcal infections. We present here a patient with recurrent AGN in the absence of chronic bacterial infection. The subject, an 80-year-old man, had eight episodes of acute nephritic syndrome following upper respiratory tract infection. No abnormalities were detected during remissions. Renal biopsies during two of those episodes showed typical postinfectious acute exsudative endocapillary glomerulonephritis, while results of another biopsy performed during remission were normal. 
2	Training, credentialling, and granting of clinical privileges for laparoscopic general surgery. Despite the lack of scientific data comparing it with traditional open operations, laparoscopic surgery has gained rapid acceptance and implementation by general surgeons. Individual hospitals, which have the responsibility for developing their own privileging criteria, are searching for guidance as to the amount and type of additional training required to grant clinical privileges in laparoscopic general surgery. Laparoscopic surgery involves techniques different from those learned during general surgery residency training. Therefore, until such techniques are regularly included in general surgery residency programs, additional training for and granting of separate privileges in laparoscopic surgery are appropriate. Adequate training for surgeons already experienced in abdominal and biliary tract surgery can be acquired through a preceptorship in diagnostic laparoscopy, attending a course in laparoscopic surgery that includes both didactic instruction and live animal experience, assisting with the procedures in humans, and being proctored and certified as competent by an experienced general surgeon. 
2	Capillary refilling (skin turgor) in the assessment of dehydration. This study was undertaken to evaluate the usefulness of skin turgor or capillary refilling in estimating the degree of dehydration in infants with diarrhea. After initial standardization of the technique, capillary filling time was found to be more reproducible when measured in the fingernail bed after applying just the amount of pressure necessary to blanch the nail bed. Capillary refilling time in 30 normal infants 2 to 24 months of age was 0.81 +/- 0.31 seconds. Capillary filling time was then measured in 32 infants with diarrhea admitted to the hospital and correlated to the degree of dehydration as estimated from the difference in weight from the time of hospital admission to the weight after rehydration. A turgor time of 1.5 seconds or less was found to be indicative of a less than 50-mL/kg deficit or of a normal infant; 1.5 to 3.0 seconds suggests a deficit between 50 and 100 mL/kg, and more than 3 seconds suggests a deficit of more than 100 mL/kg. 
5	Eosinophilia-myalgia syndrome. Recognition of a distinct clinicopathologic entity The eosinophilia-myalgia syndrome is a newly described disorder related to the ingestion of L-tryptophan-containing products. Its presentation may mimic other disorders characterized by eosinophilia and muscle pain and/or weakness, but can be differentiated by certain characteristic laboratory and pathologic findings. We report two such cases, describe their features, and review similar syndromes. 
4	Epirubicin cardiotoxicity: a study of 135 patients with advanced breast cancer. The cardiotoxicity of epirubicin (EPI) was evaluated clinically, radiologically, with ECG, and with multiple ECG-gated radionuclide determination of the left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) during rest in 135 patients with advanced breast cancer. The EPI doses were 60 mg/m2 on days 1 and 8 every 4 weeks or 45 mg/m2 plus vindesine 3 mg/m2 on the same schedule. The median cumulative dose of EPI was 500 mg/m2 (range, 47 to 1,563). Eight of the 135 patients developed congestive heart failure (CHF). Of 67 patients treated with EPI less than 500 mg/m2, none developed CHF. Among 48 patients treated with doses between 500 and 1,000 mg/m2, one had CHF (2%; 95% confidence limits, 0.1 to 11.1). Among 20 patients who received EPI from 1,000 to 1,563 mg/m2, seven developed CHF (35%; 95% confidence limits, 15.4 to 59.2). Four patients died due to cardiotoxicity. The risk of EPI cardiotoxicity at the present schedule is considerable at doses above 1,000 mg/m2. At doses between 500 and 1,000 mg/m2 the risk of CHF decreases, and at doses below 500 mg/m2, it is negligible. For all patients, the prevalence of CHF was 6% and the sensitivity of LVEF high (95%), mainly due to the low incidence of CHF. Among the 20 patients who received EPI at more than 1,000 mg/m2, the prevalence of CHF was 35% and the sensitivity only 64%. The specificity was maximally 62%. Our results suggest that LVEF is of no value as a predictor for CHF. 
5	Plasma cell granuloma of the nasal cavity treated by radiation therapy. Plasma cell granuloma is a rare, benign tumor most commonly found in the lungs in patients younger than 30 years. Although presentation has been reported at a number of other anatomic sites, this report is the first of plasma cell granuloma of the nasal cavity. The tumor was initially resected, but progression was seen at 1-month follow-up. Because further surgery to completely eradicate the tumor would have been extensive and disfiguring, 40-Gy external beam radiation was given in 20 fractions using a three-field wedge technique. Most recent clinical follow-up at 27 months showed local control. Surgery remains the treatment of choice for plasma cell granuloma when the disease can be completely resected. However, irradiation can also be effective in patients with recurrent or inoperable local disease. 
5	Cardiac Arrest in Seattle: Conventional Versus Amiodarone Drug Evaluation (the CASCADE study). This randomized study evaluates survivors of out-of-hospital ventricular fibrillation (VF) not associated with a Q-wave acute myocardial infarction who are deemed to be at a high risk of recurrence of VF. It compares the outcome of treatment with empirically administered amiodarone with the outcome of treatment with other antiarrhythmic agents guided by electrophysiologic testing or Holter recording, or both. The goal of therapy guided by electrophysiologic testing is to suppress inducible ventricular tachycardia (VT) or VF. Holter recording is used as the primary means of adjusting therapy only if patients are noninducible at the baseline electrophysiologic study. Patients are stratified according to cardiac diagnosis, ejection fraction, and whether they had previously received an antiarrhythmic agent that failed to suppress their arrhythmias. The primary end point of the study is total cardiac mortality. The first patient was enrolled in a pilot study on April 26, 1984. By October 1988, 142 patients had been enrolled in the full study and, as of May 1990, 199 patients have been enrolled. Compliance with therapy has been good, with no patients lost to follow-up and 8% of patients, equal in both drug groups, crossing over to alternate therapy. Baseline clinical characteristics remain similar in amiodarone and conventional drug groups. Pulmonary toxicity with amiodarone is 7% at 1 year, with no patients dying of pulmonary toxicity. In the first 142 patients, the overall 1-year cardiac mortality was 19%, with a 17% arrhythmic mortality (either VF or presumed arrhythmic death). 
5	Hippocampal sclerosis in temporal lobe epilepsy demonstrated by magnetic resonance imaging. The value of magnetic resonance imaging in the detection of hippocampal sclerosis has been controversial. We studied 10 patients aged 22.5 +/- 6.0 years with intractable temporal lobe epilepsy selected because of a history of a prolonged childhood convulsion, which is characteristic of a group of patients in whom hippocampal sclerosis is a constant finding. All 10 patients showed reduction in size of one hippocampus associated with increased signal intensity on T2-weighted magnetic resonance images. These changes were reliably detected on coronal spin-echo images, perpendicular to the long axis of the hippocampus. Appreciation of the normal imaging anatomy of the hippocampus allowed correct interpretation of the relative changes in signal intensities of the hippocampus and adjacent temporal horn on sequential echo images. The side of the abnormal hippocampus on magnetic resonance imaging accorded with the electroencephalographic localization in all 10 patients, and with the lateralization of the early convulsions in all 6 patients where this was known. Temporal lobectomy was performed in all 10 patients. Hippocampal sclerosis was confirmed in the 3 patients in whom hippocampal tissue was available for histological examination. The value of this technique was reinforced by the excellent postoperative results, with 80% being seizure free at a mean follow-up time of 33 +/- 4 months. 
3	Limb-body wall complex with complete absence of external genitalia after in vitro fertilization. The first case of limb-body wall complex (a combination of a body wall defect, neural tube defect, and limb abnormalities) after IVF is described. This is the third reported patient with this complex anomaly associated with complete absence of external genitalia. The possible pathogenic mechanisms are discussed. 
5	Chromosomal analysis of unfertilized oocytes and morphologically abnormal preimplantation embryos from an in vitro fertilization program. In vitro fertilization cycles yield a low percentage of pregnancies. Eighty-five to ninety percent of the transferred embryos do not implant, and the abortion rate approaches 30%. Aneuploidy is assumed to be responsible for a major portion of this pregnancy wastage. The purpose of this study was to determine if there was any correlation between morphology and chromosomal content of unfertilized oocytes and rejected embryos. To assess the chromosomal content of oocytes and embryos, we used the method described by Tarkowski in 1966. Sixty oocytes fron 28 women, aged between 27 and 41 years, were analyzed. Sixty-seven percent were aneuploid; of these, 23.35% were hyperhaploid, 23.35% were hypohaploid, 8.35% were hyperdiploid, 3.35% were diploid, and 8.35% showed premature chromosome condensation. Of 20 preimplantation embryos analyzed, 80% were aneuploid, 10% were diploid, 5% were haploid, and 5% showed structural anomaly. Correlation was found between maternal age and aneuploidy in oocytes and between morphology and genetic balance in preimplantation embryos. 
2	Water and electrolyte balance after ileoanal anastomosis. Water and electrolyte balance was studied in 30 patients with ileoanal anastomosis and J pouch, 10 patients with conventional ileostomy, and nine nonoperated patients with quiescent ulcerative colitis. Serum electrolyte concentrations, daily urinary volume, and daily losses of sodium, potassium, and chloride were measured in all patients. Daily fecal weight and daily losses of sodium and potassium were analyzed in patients with ileoanal anastomosis or conventional ileostomy. Serum chloride in patients with ileoanal anastomosis was significantly lower (P less than 0.05) than in those with conventional ileostomy or in nonoperated patients. Daily urinary loss of sodium in nonoperated patients was significantly higher than in patients with ileoanal anastomosis (P less than 0.01) or conventional ileostomy (P less than 0.05). Daily urinary loss of chloride in patients with ileoanal anastomosis was significantly lower (P less than 0.05) than in nonoperated patients. Daily fecal loss of potassium in patients with ileoanal anastomosis was significantly higher (P less than 0.05) than in those with conventional ileostomy. Daily urinary volume and fecal weight did not differ significantly in patients with ileoanal anastomosis or conventional ileostomy. The present study indicates that changes in water and sodium balance after ileoanal anastomosis are similar to those after conventional ileostomy but chloride balance is more altered after ileoanal anastomosis. 
4	Pulmonary artery-bronchus ratios in patients with normal lungs, pulmonary vascular plethora, and congestive heart failure. The pulmonary artery-bronchus ratio (ABR), defined as the external diameter of a pulmonary artery divided by the external diameter of its accompanying bronchus, was measured in the upper and lower lung zones on frontal chest radiographs in the following groups of subjects: erect healthy subjects, erect subjects with pulmonary vascular plethora, erect subjects with clinical evidence of decompensated left-sided congestive heart failure (CHF), supine normal subjects, and supine subjects with clinical evidence of decompensated CHF. Characteristic vascular patterns were found in each group. The positive predictive value of an abnormal vascular pattern determined by means of changes in the ABR on the erect chest radiograph was 100%, with the negative predictive value of a normal pattern being 97%. The erect chest radiograph was 93% accurate in distinguishing between plethora and CHF. The positive predictive value of an abnormal vascular pattern on the supine chest radiograph was 100%, with the negative predictive value of a normal vascular pattern being 97%. Measurements of ABR can be a helpful adjunct to the interpretation of supine and erect chest radiographs. 
5	In-hospital symptoms of psychological stress as predictors of long-term outcome after acute myocardial infarction in men. The impact of high levels of psychological stress symptoms in the hospital after an acute myocardial infarction (AMI) was examined over 5 years among 461 men who took part in a trial of psychological stress monitoring and intervention. Psychological stress was assessed using the 20-item General Health Questionnaire (GHQ) 1 to 2 days before hospital discharge. Once discharged, patients in the treatment group responded to the GHQ by telephone on a monthly basis and, when they reported high levels of stress symptoms (GHQ greater than or equal to 5), received visits from nurses to help them deal with their life problems. Control patients received routine medical care after discharge. Post-hoc subgroup analyses based on life-table methods showed that, for patients receiving routine care after discharge, high stress (GHQ greater than or equal to 5) was associated with a close to threefold increase in risk of cardiac mortality over 5 years (p = 0.0003) and an approximately 1.5-fold increase in risk of reinfarction over the same period (p = 0.09). In contrast, highly stressed patients who took part in the 1-year program of stress monitoring and intervention did not experience any significant long-term increase in risk. Although program impact was significant in terms of reduction of both cardiac mortality (p = 0.006) and AMI recurrences (p = 0.004) among highly stressed patients, there was little evidence of impact among patients with low levels of stress in the hospital. 
1	Inhibition of invasion of invasive human bladder carcinoma cells by protein kinase C inhibitor staurosporine. To study the effect of the protein kinase C (PKC) inhibitor staurosporine on invasion, we selected the invasive human bladder carcinoma cell line EJ. Total PKC activity was more than twofold higher in the EJ cells than in RT4 cells (superficial human bladder carcinoma cells), which do not pass through an artificial basement membrane. There was more PKC activity in the cytosol than in the membrane of EJ cells. Staurosporine, at nontoxic concentrations, inhibited the invasion of EJ cells through an artificial basement membrane in a dose-dependent manner. Staurosporine caused a dose-dependent inhibition of cell motility but did not inhibit cell attachment. Staurosporine represents a new agent for the inhibition of tumor cell invasion and may prove useful in studying the mechanisms responsible for this phenomenon. 
4	Is sick sinus syndrome an adenosine-mediated disease? Effects of intravenous aminophylline on sick sinus node function after pharmacologic autonomic blockade. To assess the effects of intravenous aminophylline on the sinus node, 12 patients with clinical and Holter monitor-documented sick sinus syndrome were studied (1) during the control state, (2) after pharmacologic autonomic blockade and (3) 5 min after intravenous administration of aminophylline. The effects of aminophylline on sinus node function were compared with those after pharmacologic autonomic blockade. No significant improvement of sinus node function was found after intravenous aminophylline administration with a mean sinus cycle length and a mean maximum CSRT of 968 +/- 218 and 1832 +/- 1036 ms, respectively. The mean serum theophylline level was 10.9 +/- 1.7 micrograms/ml. Since aminophylline is an adenosine receptor antagonist, these findings suggest that intrinsic adenosine may not play an important role in pathogenesis in patients with chronic and advanced sick sinus syndrome. 
5	Irreversible tubulointerstitial damage associated with chronic aminonucleoside nephrosis. Amelioration by angiotensin I converting enzyme inhibition. Chronic aminonucleoside nephrosis is variably associated with tubulointerstitial damage, depending on the route and frequency of drug administration. Recently, different groups have shown this injurious tubulointerstitial process to be reversible, coinciding with the resolution of heavy proteinuria to normal values. The authors have previously shown that a single jugular intravenous administration of puromycin aminonucleoside (PA) to male Munich-Wistar rats produces a triphasic pattern of glomerular injury and proteinuria, which culminates in focal glomerulosclerosis 70 weeks after drug administration. The authors now report the later progression of the tubulointerstitial morphologic abnormalities associated with acute nephrosis (phase I), despite spontaneous resolution of glomerular injury during the intermediate period (phase II) in this model. Although treatment of rats with the angiotensin I converting enzyme inhibitor enalapril (50 mg/l drinking water) over the 70-week period did not affect the magnitude of proteinuria during the acute nephrotic phase, enalapril prevented the recurrence of proteinuria (phase III), as well as significantly reducing the severity of interstitial fibrosis, extent of tubular dilatation, and number of intratubular casts on semiquantitative scoring at the conclusion of the study. In addition, enalapril-treated rats had less low-molecular-weight protein excretion during the recurrent phase of proteinuria, suggesting a preservation of tubular functional capacity to reabsorb these proteins. In vitro cytotoxicity studies showed only the glomerular visceral epithelial cell to be sensitive to PA, in contrast with rat tubular epithelium and other cellular controls. Although the exact pathogenetic mechanism responsible for the development of the tubulointerstitial damage remains unknown, PA in vitro does not adversely affect rat tubular epithelium; there is however a clear correlation between the magnitude of recurrent proteinuria and the severity of tubulointerstitial morphologic abnormalities, as suggested by the beneficial effect of converting enzyme inhibition on both of these untoward processes. 
5	Expanding contractures of the tunica albuginea due to Peyronie's disease with temporalis fascia free grafts. We describe a procedure to expand contractures of the tunica albuginea by multiple full thickness relaxing incisions followed by inlay of tailored temporalis fascia free grafts. This technique is performed without resection of the tunica albuginea, although in the case of calcified plaques the calcifications themselves are removed, preserving the overlying tunica. Between September 1988 and February 1990, 12 patients have undergone this procedure, all of whom have greater than 3 months of followup and have experienced spontaneous erections within the first week postoperatively. Of the patients 11 resumed intercourse within 8 weeks of surgery and 1 required 12 weeks. No patient had sensory loss postoperatively and there has been no donor site morbidity. Correction of curvature was accomplished in all patients and there have been no recurrences within a maximal followup of 22 months. Within the limitations of such a small study we believe that there is evidence supporting this approach in potent patients with severe acquired penile curvature. 
3	A single case of Huntington's disease simultaneously occurring with obstructive hydrocephalus. A case of simultaneously occurring Huntington's disease and obstructive hydrocephalus is presented. Huntington's and other neurodegenerative diseases have been described with normal-pressure hydrocephalus; however, no such description with obstructive hydrocephalus has been reported. The obstructive hydrocephalus displays a familial tendency in its presentation. 
5	Gallbladder surgery following cholecystlithotripsy: suggested guidelines for treatment Twenty-three of 229 symptomatic patients undergoing cholecystlithotripsy underwent surgical intervention: 22 of the patients had cholecystectomy performed (five also undergoing choledochotomy) and one patient had a cholecystostomy. Of these 23 patients, five were lithotripsy failures, five developed acute pancreatitis, one had acute cholecystitis, and one had cholangitis. One patient had her gallbladder removed incidentally at the time of surgery for a bleeding gastric ulcer. Ten patients underwent surgery for recurrent biliary pain, probably related to fragment passage via the cystic duct. We suggest that up to 16 of these 23 patients did not necessarily require cholecystectomy, i.e. five patients with pancreatitis, one patient with cholangitis and ten patients with recurrent biliary colic. Conservative and/or endoscopic management may be successful in the first instance to allow further treatment with lithotripsy in the majority of patients. If, however, the expertise to perform endoscopic sphincterotomy is not available or the patient declines further lithotripsy, then resort to surgery may be necessary. We propose that it is the responsibility of the management team in charge of the lithotripsy unit to inform both the patient and the referring clinicians of the possible side-effects and outcome of treatment in an attempt to avoid unnecessary surgical procedures. 
1	Germfree animals and technics in surgical research. Germfree animals have been reared to a size, weight, and age permitting the performance of major surgical procedures and the pursuit of a variety of surgical research problems. Germfree dogs have been maintained in the isolator system through three generations, indicating that life, reproduction, and growth are all possible in the absence of microbial contamination. The value of the germfree approach to surgical problems has been utilized in studies of a variety of gastrointestinal problems, shock, cancer, immunology, burns, wound healing, and in direct patient application. Patients have been maintained in isolator environments for prevention of infection, for operative procedures, for treatment of extensive burns, and for management of immune-suppressed individuals. We conclude that germfree animals and germfree technics provide a valuable addition to the armamentarium of the surgeon in both research and clinical applications. 
3	Asymmetric growth of the lateral cerebral ventricle in infants with posthemorrhagic ventricular dilation. Lateral cerebral ventricular volume in 36 preterm infants with or without an intraventricular hemorrhage, and with or without posthemorrhagic hydrocephalus, was measured longitudinally and compared with the ventricular index measurements of the same ventricles. A poor correlation was found (r2 = 0.67). To determine a reason for this poor relationship, we analyzed the volumes of the regions of the ventricles by a segmental volume analysis. The occipital region of the lateral cerebral ventricle enlarged at a much faster rate (1.904 +/- 0.477 ml/day) than either the anterior region (0.546 +/- 0.253 ml/day; p less than 0.01) or the middle region (-0.209 +/- 0.334 ml/day; p less than 0.01) in infants with posthemorrhagic hydrocephalus. The rate of growth of the middle region of the lateral cerebral ventricles was the same for all infants. Linear indexes, such as the ventricular index and the lateral ventricular ratio, do not allow for accurate serial estimates of ventricular size in posthemorrhagic hydrocephalus because of asymmetric growth of the lateral cerebral ventricle. We conclude that sequential volume measurements are more useful than ventricular index measurements to follow ventricular size sequentially in infants with posthemorrhagic hydrocephalus. 
1	Comparative study of cutaneous T-cell lymphoma and adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma. Clinical, histopathologic, and immunohistochemical analyses. An important disease entity distinct from cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (CTCL) in Japan is adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma (ATL), which usually shows the same phenotype as CTCL, i.e., a helper/inducer T-cell phenotype (CD4+CD8-), and usually involves the skin. Clinically, both CTCL and ATL are heterogeneous in nature. In this study, we demonstrated differences between CTCL and ATL in terms of clinical and immunopathologic cell surface features. In patients with ATL, the predominant clinical findings were peripheral lymph node involvement, skin lesions, hepatosplenomegaly, leukemic manifestations, and an aggressive course. In patients with CTCL, by contrast, only skin lesions predominated at the onset of the disease and a relatively good prognosis was demonstrated. Phenotypic heterogeneity of ATL in the skin, i.e., CD4-CD8-, CD4+CD8-, and CD4-CD8+, was demonstrated. Expression of Leu8, CD7 (Leu9), and CD45RA (2H4) was high in both the skin-infiltrating ATL cells and peripheral blood and lymph node ATL cells compared with that in the skin-infiltrating CTCL cells. Expression of CD25 (IL-2R), CD71 (OKT9), HLA-DR, and HLA-DQ was higher in the skin-infiltrating ATL cells than in CTCL cells. Expression of CD29 (4B4) was high, and that of CD45RA (2H4) was low in both the skin-infiltrating ATL and CTCL cells compared with the peripheral blood and lymph node ATL cells. Expression of CD45RO (UCHL-1) was not significantly high in the skin-infiltrating CTCL cells compared with that in ATL cells. The most significant phenotypic difference between ATL cells and CTCL cells was the expression of Leu8 (lymph node homing receptor), CD7 and CD25 antigens on the cell surface, and the main phenotypic difference between skin-infiltrating ATL and CTCL cells and peripheral blood and lymph node ATL cells was the expression of CD29 and CD45RA. These findings confirm that the difference in antigen expression on the cell surface might reflect the clinical features of ATL and CTCL, and suggest that the predominant phenotype of peripheral blood and lymph node ATL cells is that of naive, relatively immature or activated T-cells, and that CTCL cells are previously activated (memory) T-cells. In other words, CTCL cells do not share the same origin as ATL cells. These observations support the concept that ATL is a disease distinct from CTCL. 
4	Aortic dissection with the entrance tear in the descending thoracic aorta. Analysis of 40 necropsy patients. Clinical and necropsy findings are described in 40 patients who had aortic dissection with the entrance tear in the descending thoracic aorta. Their ages at death ranged from 39 to 91 years (mean, 66 years); 24 (60%) were men and 16 (40%) were women. Systemic hypertension was present by history in 33 patients (83%) and the hearts were of increased weight in 78%. Of the 40 patients, 31 (78%) had no operative intervention, while 9 (22%) underwent operation for aortic dissection. Of the 31 patients without operative therapy, the diagnosis of aortic dissection was established in life in 9 patients (29%) and at necropsy in 22 (71%). The interval from aortic dissection to death was 30 days or less in 13 patients (42%); rupture of the false channel was the cause of death in 9 patients (69%), renal failure in 2 (15%), and the cause was unclear in 2 (15%). The interval from aortic dissection to death was more than 30 days in 18 (58%) of the 31 patients without operative therapy. The cause of death in these 18 patients was related to the dissection in 11 (61%) (rupture of the false channel in 5; renal failure from dissection in 3, and rupture of the false channel of a second acute dissection in 3), but in the other 7 patients (39%) death was unrelated to the dissection but a nonfatal complication, specifically stenosis of the true channel from compression by a thrombus-filled false channel, occurred in 4 of these 7 patients. Thus only 3 (10%) of the 31 patients without operative therapy had no complications of aortic dissection. All nine patients who underwent operation had had an aortic dissection within 30 days, and the operation was performed because of a major complication of the dissection. Four patients survived 8 to 84 months after the operation. Thus early operative intervention (before the appearance of complications) appears justified in patients with aortic dissection with the entrance tear in the descending thoracic aorta to prevent rupture of the false channel acutely or after initial healing; to prevent renal failure from compression of renal arteries by an aneurysmal false channel; to prevent true channel stenosis from compression by a thrombus-filled false channel; and possibly to prevent the recurrence of acute dissection. 
4	Outcomes of direct coronary angioplasty for acute myocardial infarction in candidates and non-candidates for thrombolytic therapy. Coronary angioplasty without prior thrombolytic therapy was performed in 383 patients with acute myocardial infarction (AMI). Patients were divided into 2 groups depending on whether they were candidates or non-candidates for thrombolytic therapy. Patients were not considered thrombolytic candidates if they: (1) presented in cardiogenic shock, (2) were greater than or equal to 75 years of age, (3) had had coronary artery bypass surgery or, (4) had a reperfusion time of greater than 6 hours. Thrombolytic and nonthrombolytic candidates had similar rates of reperfusion (92 vs 88%), nonfatal reinfarction (6.0 vs 5.9%) and recurrent myocardial ischemia (1.8 vs 0%). Thrombolytic candidates had a lower mortality rate (3.9 vs 24%, p less than 0.0001) and a lower incidence of bleeding (4.6 vs 10.9%, p less than 0.05). Improvement in left ventricular ejection fraction at follow-up angiography was 4.4% in thrombolytic and 10.5% in nonthrombolytic candidates (p less than 0.002). Ejection fraction improved most in patients with anterior wall AMI (7.7% in thrombolytic candidates, 15.1% in nonthrombolytic candidates) and in patients with reperfusion times greater than 6 hours (14.2%). These outcomes suggest that direct coronary angioplasty is a viable alternative method of reperfusion in patients with AMI who are candidates for thrombolytic therapy. Nonthrombolytic candidates are a high-risk group of patients. Direct coronary angioplasty may be beneficial in certain subgroups, especially for patients in cardiogenic shock and for patients presenting greater than 6 hours after the onset of chest pain with evidence of ongoing ischemia. 
4	Usefulness of digital angiography in the assessment of left ventricular ejection fraction. With modern digital cardiac systems the image data are digitized on-line and in real-time, allowing the replay and subsequent interpretation and analysis during or directly after the cardiac catheterization procedure. In this study we have evaluated the advantages and limitations of a manual tracing technique for left ventricular digital angiograms on the Phillips DCI system. Thirty-three patients who were catheterized for suspected coronary artery disease were studied. The manual tracings were performed by a senior cardiologist and an experienced function-analyst. It was found that the short- and long-term intraobserver variabilities in the assessment of the global ejection fraction were very small; short-term mean difference +/- standard deviation (correlation coefficient): 0.5 +/- 2.7 (r = 0.97) global EF%-units; long term; 0.7 +/- 2.7 (r = 0.96) EF%-units. The interobserver variabilities (5.1 +/- 4.8 (r = 0.93) EF%-units) were slightly higher than the intraobserver variabilities. A decrease by 25% in the amount of contrast medium administered did not significantly influence the variabilities in the contour tracings, which would suggest the use of smaller doses. At the average, the cardiologist and the function-analyst required 6 and 11 min of analysis time for a left ventricular study, respectively, emphasizing the need for further developments towards automated contour detection. Finally, an excellent correlation was found with a standard off-line cinefilm analysis procedure. Thus, it may be concluded that quantitative digital left ventricular angiography based on manual tracing of the outlines performed immediately following the cardiac catheterization (post-processing) is feasible as a routine procedure for the assessment of left ventricular function. 
4	Swan-Ganz catheter-induced massive hemoptysis and pulmonary artery false aneurysm. Swan-Ganz catheter-induced massive hemoptysis and later pulmonary artery false aneurysm occurred in a patient with prosthetic mitral regurgitation. This patient was successfully managed by double-lumen endotracheal intubation, control of pulmonary hypertension, reversal of anticoagulation, mitral valve re-replacement, and transcatheter embolization. The pertinent literature is reviewed. 
3	Serum and CSF levels of IL-2, sIL-2R, TNF-alpha, and IL-1 beta in chronic progressive multiple sclerosis: expected lack of clinical utility. We measured interleukin-2 (IL-2), soluble IL-2 receptor (sIL-2R), tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), and interleukin-1 beta (IL-1 beta) by ELISA in paired sera and CSF from 50 chronic progressive multiple sclerosis (CPMS) patients during worsening disability, 19 patients with other neurologic diseases (OND), and in sera from 40 healthy volunteers. In the CPMS patients, 28% (14/50), 10% (5/50), 16% (8/50), and 6% (3/50) had elevated serum levels of IL-2, sIL-2R, TNF-alpha and IL-1 beta, respectively, compared with healthy controls. The only analyte we detected in the CSF was IL-2 in 1 CPMS patient (1/50, 2%). We also saw elevated serum sIL-2R in 16% (3/19) of OND patients. We found no significant difference in mean levels of serum sIL-2R between the 3 groups. Our study, the largest to date of CPMS patients, shows that serum and CSF levels of IL-2, sIL-2R, TNF-alpha, or IL-1 beta are not sensitive for, and the serum sIL-2R level is not specific for, CPMS. Therefore, measurement of these analytes will not be clinically useful for therapeutic or prognostic purposes in the majority of CPMS patients. 
2	Congenital diaphragmatic hernia: impact of prostanoids in the perioperative period. A prospective study of 10 neonates with congenital diaphragmatic hernia and five controls to determine the importance of prostanoid concentrations perioperatively and the relation with persistent pulmonary hypertension (PPH) is reported. In neonates with congenital diaphragmatic hernia postoperative concentrations of the vasoconstrictor thromboxane B2 rose significantly and were higher during episodes of PPH; this rise may provoke PPH and subsequent right to left shunting. 
5	Fatty liver hepatitis (steatohepatitis) and obesity: an autopsy study with analysis of risk factors. Steatohepatitis (fatty liver hepatitis), histologically identical to alcoholic disease, occurs in some obese patients after jejunoileal bypass. A similar lesion occurs rarely in obese patients without bypass surgery, but the risk factors are poorly understood. Hepatic steatosis, steatohepatitis and fibrosis were sought in 351 apparently nonalcoholic patients at autopsy and various risk factors were evaluated. Incidence of steatosis and steatohepatitis correlated with the degree of obesity. Steatohepatitis was found in 18.5% of markedly obese patients and 2.7% of lean patients. Additional risk factors for steatohepatitis were type II diabetes, weight loss in the preterminal period shortly before death and intravenous glucose therapy in the last week of life. Severe fibrosis was found in 13.8% of markedly obese patients and in 6.6% of lean patients; this difference was largely explained by the higher prevalence of diabetes in obese groups. The risk factors defined in this study are known to be associated with abnormalities of free fatty acid metabolism. Obesity, type II diabetes and intravenous glucose therapy are associated with hyperinsulinemia, which may inhibit fatty acid oxidation. Obesity and weight loss increase the presentation of fatty acids to the liver. Similar metabolic changes may occur in obese patients after jejunoileal bypass surgery. Thus this study supports the hypothesis that fatty acids have a role in the hepatocellular necrosis found in some obese individuals. 
3	Spontaneous electromyographic potentials in chronic spinal cord injured patients: relation to spasticity and length of nerve. Nine patients with complete cervical spinal cord injury (SCI) had their vastus medialis, tibialis anterior, and gastrocnemius muscles evaluated with an electromyographic (EMG) examination in the acute (four to eight weeks) and chronic (more than one year) phases. The hypothesis that spontaneous EMG activity changes with time was assessed. During the chronic phase evaluation, a conduction study was performed to rule out peripheral nerve damage, and the amount of reflex activity was assessed on a scale of 0 to 5 (0 = areflexia; 5 = greater than 5 beats of clonus) to estimate the amount of spasticity. Subjects demonstrated normal conduction through the sensory (sural nerve) and/or motor segments of the peroneal and tibial nerves. In the acute phase, each muscle had spontaneous activity with no significant variation between different muscles of the same patient. In the chronic phase, there was a positive correlation between the degree of spontaneous activity in a muscle and the length of its axon (p less than .01) and a negative correlation between the amount of spontaneous activity and the degree of reflex activity (p less than .01). Specifically, the lower motor neuron in the chronic phase of an SCI seems to behave much like an axonopathy where the degree of spontaneous EMG activity is dependent on the length of the axon, with the additional concept that spontaneous activity is inhibited by spasticity. 
2	Screening colonoscopy in asymptomatic average-risk persons with negative fecal occult blood tests. Colonoscopy was performed on 210 asymptomatic average-risk persons, aged 50-75 years, who had negative fecal occult blood test results. Colonoscopy was complete to the cecum in 209 subjects. Fifty-three subjects (25%) had adenomas and two had cancer. All of the adenomas greater than or equal to 1 cm in size and both cancers occurred in subjects aged greater than or equal to 60 years. Fifty-one percent of subjects with adenomas and one with cancer had no neoplasms distal to the sigmoid-descending colon junction. One subject had a major postpolypectomy hemorrhage that stopped spontaneously. Screening colonoscopy, therefore, has a high yield for detection of neoplasms in asymptomatic average-risk persons aged greater than or equal to 60 years with negative fecal occult blood test results. The yield is low in persons aged 50-54 years and intermediate in persons aged 55-59 years. 
5	Decision criteria for pure-tone detection used by two age groups of normal-hearing and hearing-impaired listeners. Response criteria from a yes-no task and detection thresholds from two test procedures were measured for four groups of adults: younger normal-hearing, older normal-hearing, younger hearing-impaired, and older hearing-impaired. The two test procedures were an audiological procedure (which does not control for response bias) and a 21FC adaptive procedure (which does control for bias). The signal was a 500 or 4000 Hz tone presented in quiet. All four groups showed an equally conservative response bias in the yes-no task. In addition, neither age nor hearing loss affected the difference (6.5 dB) between the two threshold measures. 
2	Use of H2-receptor antagonists in children. H2-receptor antagonists (H2RAs) have evolved into the mainstay of anti-acid therapy for pediatric patients, replacing antacids and other modes of therapy. Much of the experience and data used for therapeutic decisions in children, however, have been extrapolated from adult studies. Ranitidine and cimetidine have been studied most extensively in the adult and pediatric populations. Both raise gastric pH and achieve other therapeutic endpoints; however, cimetidine appears to have a greater frequency of both adversed effects and drug interactions. H2RAs are the preferred agents for prevention of stress ulcers, ulcer disease, and reflux esophagitis in the pediatric population. 
1	Mid-line presentation of cervical lymphomata. Three cases of lymphoma are reported, all of which presented as a mid-line cervical swelling and appeared to be localised disease. The importance of early removal of such lesions is emphasized. 
1	Hepatobiliary manifestations of the acquired immune deficiency syndrome. Patients with the acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) frequently develop hepatic dysfunction. Although hepatic injury may indirectly result from malnutrition, hypotension, administered medications, sepsis, or other conditions, the hepatic injury is frequently due to opportunistic hepatic infection, directly related to AIDS. Infection with Mycobacterium avium intracellulare typically occurs in patients with advanced immunocompromise and with systemic symptoms due to widely disseminated infection. In contrast, hepatic tuberculosis often occurs with less advanced immunocompromise. Cytomegaloviral infection may produce a hepatitis. Cytomegaloviral and cryptosporidial infections have been implicated as causes of acalculous cholecystitis and of a secondary sclerosing cholangitis. About 10-20% of patients with AIDS have chronic hepatitis B infection. These patients tend to develop minimal hepatic inflammation and necrosis. The clinical findings in patients with hepatic cryptococcal infection are usually due to concomitant extrahepatic infection. Hepatic histoplasmosis usually develops as part of a widely disseminated infection with systemic symptoms. Hepatic involvement by Kaposi's sarcoma is rarely documented ante mortem because an unguided liver biopsy is an insensitive diagnostic procedure. Patients with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma of the liver typically have lymphadenopathy, hepatomegaly, and systemic symptoms. As a pragmatic approach, patients with liver dysfunction and HIV-related disease should have a sonographic or computerized tomographic examination of the liver. Patients with dilated bile ducts should undergo endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography because opportunistic infection may produce biliary obstruction. Patients with a focal hepatic lesion should be considered for a guided liver biopsy. Patients with a significantly elevated serum alkaline phosphatase level should be considered for a percutaneous liver biopsy. When performed for these indications, liver biopsy will demonstrate a significant disease involving the liver in about 50% of patients with AIDS and in about 25% of patients who are HIV seropositive but who are not known to have AIDS. The clinical impact of a diagnostic biopsy is blunted by a lack of efficacious therapy for many opportunistic infections. 
1	Effect of plasmapheresis on serum and CSF autoantibody levels in CNS paraneoplastic syndromes. We compared the effect of plasmapheresis on antineuronal autoantibody titers in the serum and CSF of 3 patients with CNS paraneoplastic syndromes. Plasmapheresis reduced the serum autoantibody titer to 20% of the initial levels in the 3 patients, but the CSF autoantibody titer decreased only in the patient with severe damage of the blood-brain barrier. 
1	Establishment of an erythroid cell line (JK-1) that spontaneously differentiates to red cells. The authors established a new hemopoietic cell line (JK-1) from a patient with chronic myelogenous leukemia in erythroid crisis. This JK-1 line predominantly consists of immature cells, but a small number of mature erythroblasts and red cells can be consistently seen without any specific differentiation inducer. The JK-1 cells grow in suspension culture supplemented with human plasma and carry double Philadelphia chromosomes. Hemoglobin staining with benzidine was positive for about 20% of cells and the type of the hemoglobin was for the most part HbF. Surface-marker analysis revealed JK-1 cells positive for glycophorin A, EP-1, and HAE9. The proportion of mature cells was elevated by the addition of delta-aminolevulinic acid. Erythropoietin (EPO) enhanced the growth of JK-1 cells either in the suspension or in methylcellulose semisolid culture. The total number of EPO receptors was 940 per cell, of which 220 sites had an affinity higher than the other 720 sites. This is the first report of an established human erythroid cell line which spontaneously undergoes terminal differentiation. 
4	Thallium-201 stress scintigraphy in Takayasu arteritis. Thirty-eight women with Takayasu arteritis were studied using thallium-201 stress myocardial scintigraphy to assess the prevalence and pathophysiology of the perfusion abnormality. Twenty (53%) had abnormal scintigraphic findings (group A). Abnormal scans were divided into 3 groups: permanent defects in 6, reversible defects in 7 and slow washout in 7. The remaining 18 patients had normal scintigrams (group N). Group A had a tendency to be older and to have a high prevalence of complicated significant aortic regurgitation. Interventricular thickness plus left ventricular posterior wall thickness (26 +/- 7 vs 17 +/- 2 mm, p less than 0.01) and left ventricular mass (267 +/- 121 vs 133 +/- 39 g, p less than 0.01) were all greater in group A on echocardiography. The mean value of the central aortic pressure in systole was 170 +/- 15 mm Hg in the 7 catheterized patients in group A. Coronary ostial stenoses were present in 2 group A patients who showed reversible defects on scintigrams. These data indicate that the abnormal perfusion detected by imaging in patients with Takayasu arteritis was responsible for a decrease in coronary reserve or myocardial damage, or both, due to long-standing systemic hypertension or aortic regurgitation. Coronary artery disease should be considered if a reversible defect is present. 
5	The scapegoat effect on food aversions after chemotherapy. The effects of consuming a novel food (halva) versus a familiar food (cookies) before gastrointestinal (GI) toxic chemotherapy on patients' preference for familiar foods consumed after chemotherapy treatment were compared. The development of aversions to the novel and familiar foods was also assessed. Patients with a history of posttreatment nausea consumed either a novel or a familiar food before chemotherapy and were asked to keep a food record through the next breakfast and to rate their preference for these foods. Patients who consumed halva before treatment were significantly more likely to increase their ratings for foods consumed after chemotherapy than patients who consumed familiar cookies. Aversions to the novel food were significantly more frequent than aversions to the familiar food. These findings provide evidence that a novel but not a familiar food consumed before chemotherapy can act as a scapegoat to prevent items in the regular diet consumed after chemotherapy from decreasing in preference. Providing patients with a novel food before chemotherapy is a useful clinical intervention to reduce the likelihood of forming aversions to familiar foods consumed after chemotherapy. 
2	Rationale and efficacy of conservative therapy for gastroesophageal reflux disease. Major recent advances in the diagnosis and understanding of gastroesophageal reflux disease have afforded the practicing clinician a number of therapeutic options to treat the increasingly recognized affected patient population. With highly effective acid-suppressive therapies available, simple life-style modifications, such as selective food and medicine avoidance, weight loss, smoking cessation, elevation of the head of the bed, and the judicious use of antacids and alginate, have been relegated to a minor, if any, role in the management of these patients. The validity of these recommendations, however, remains consistent with our current understanding of the pathogenesis of gastroesophageal reflux disease. Although few well-designed placebo-controlled trials have been conducted, a review of the medical literature indicates an appreciable efficacy of these interventions, which are founded on well-studied physiologic determinants of gastroesophageal reflux. Most patients with gastroesophageal reflux disease can be managed by reassurance and simple life-style adjustments alone. The therapy for those with chronic or relapsing disease should always include the adjunctive reinforcement of these simple, efficacious, and cost-effective measures. 
4	The surgical pathologist's role in liver transplantation. Liver transplantation has become an option in treating a wide variety of diseases. The surgical pathologist, as a member of the transplantation team, is increasingly involved in the evaluation of allograft dysfunction. Interpretation of the liver allograft biopsy specimen requires integration of clinical history, biochemical data, and histologic patterns of a wide variety of lesions, including harvesting injury, vascular thrombosis, rejection, infection, and recurrent disease. This article reviews the varied histologic appearances of the more common forms of liver allograft injury, the contexts in which they arise, and their distinction from one another. 
3	Biological correlates of mental activity studied with PET. The development of newer imaging techniques that allow direct investigation of the function of the human brain under normal and pathological conditions has affected the way in which we conceive of the mind/brain relation. In this report the authors use examples from findings obtained with positron emission tomography (PET) to illustrate the highly interactive organization of the brain. Because operations in the brain require the participation of various brain areas, a model that does not require a one-to-one relationship between the physical and mental, but rather allows an association between clusters of physical processes and one or more mental phenomena, may reflect better the relation between physical brain phenomena and mental activities. 
5	The De Vega tricuspid annuloplasty. Perioperative mortality and long term follow-up. One hundred and fifty-three patients undergoing De Vega tricuspid annuloplasty, with or without other associated cardiac procedures between January, 1979, and June, 1987, were evaluated. There were 136 hospital survivors. The follow-up was 98.1% complete for a mean of 3.7 years/patient. Operative mortality was 11.1%; preoperative NYHA class and length of CPB were significant risk factors of perioperative mortality. The actuarial survival of operative survivors at 9 years was 73.5 +/- 11.8%. There were 7 late cardiac deaths among a total of 12 late deaths. Eleven patients required reoperation (2.1 +/- 0.6% patient-year). In seven patients it was necessary for recurrence of tricuspid regurgitation; six of these had also a mitral prosthesis malfunction or a periprosthetic leak. Residual tricuspid regurgitation was judged as mild, moderate or severe in 29.9%, 11.9% and 4.3% of the patients respectively. De Vega tricuspid annuloplasty is the method of choice for mild and moderate tricuspid insufficiency; in selected cases, with a more severe degree of regurgitation, better results could be achieved with a different surgical approach. 
5	Baffle fenestration with subsequent transcatheter closure. Modification of the Fontan operation for patients at increased risk Ventricular dysfunction, elevated pulmonary vascular resistance, and residual distal pulmonary artery distortion contribute to early mortality after a Fontan operation; they may be transient or reversible. A baffle fenestration, allowing right-to-left shunting, maintains cardiac output and limits right atrial pressure. A baffle fenestration was surgically created at the time of a modified Fontan repair in 20 consecutive patients. Risk factors included pulmonary artery pressure of 18 mm Hg or more, end-diastolic pressure of 12 mm Hg or more, valvar regurgitation, pulmonary artery distortion, pulmonary vascular resistance of 2 Woods' units or more, ventricular outflow obstruction, and complex anatomy. Nineteen of 20 patients survived. After the operation, mean arterial oxygen saturation was 86%, mean right atrial pressure was 15 mm Hg, and mean duration of pleural effusions was 6 days. Twelve of 19 survivors tolerated early test occlusion and had permanent transcatheter umbrella closure. Four patients failed early test occlusion, with a significant decrease in venous O2 saturation and a rise in central venous pressure, due to ventricular dysfunction, pulmonary artery distortion, or aortopulmonary collaterals. Three of four had successful late closure of the fenestration after correction of these abnormalities. 
5	Symptom analysis of patients undergoing modified Pereyra bladder neck suspension for stress urinary incontinence. Pre- and postoperative findings. The results of a physician-directed follow-up of 145 women undergoing the modified Pereyra bladder neck suspension from March 1980 to February 1986 are presented. Median follow-up was 3.5 years (2.0-7.7); 70 percent of patients had follow-up between three and four years postoperatively. All patients had preoperative demonstration of stress incontinence as well as urodynamic evaluation. Fifty-one percent of patients reported no stress incontinence and 76 percent reported that their sense of urinary control was better, or much better at the time of follow-up. Improvement was seen in all grades of stress incontinence. Age, weight, parity, and history of prior anti-incontinence surgery had no significant impact on success rates. Although preoperative urgency symptoms were more common among failure (28% vs 15%), this association was not statistically significant. However, persistent or de novo urgency symptoms postoperatively were highly associated with postoperative incontinence (p less than 0.005). The onset of recurrent incontinence was experienced more than two years postoperatively in 23 percent of the incontinent group. 
4	Paradoxic air embolism in the absence of an intracardiac defect. A 58-year-old man experienced paradoxic air embolism with passage of air from the systemic venous to the systemic arterial circulation with subsequent stroke and death. No intracardiac shunt was present. Pulmonary fibrosis concomitant with severe pulmonary arterial hypertension appears to have been responsible for the air traversing the pulmonary capillary bed. This unusual outcome of a complicated central venous catheterization must be borne in mind and guarded against in similar patients. 
5	Pseudotumor of the craniocervical junction during long-term hemodialysis. A systematic study of the upper cervical spine was performed using magnetic resonance imaging in 25 patients (15 men and 10 women) who had been undergoing hemodialysis for more than 10 years. Seven pseudotumors of the periodontoid soft tissue were disclosed, which were similar to the pannus recently described in rheumatoid arthritis. Bone cystic radiolucencies were observed in association with these pseudotumors in 5 patients. The radiolucencies were located in the atlas (1 in the lateral mass and 1 in the anterior branch) and in the axis (3 in the odontoid process and 1 in the vertebral body). No horizontal or vertical atlantoaxial subluxation was demonstrated. These features were observed only in patients who had amyloid arthropathy. They could be a frequent, yet thus far little-recognized, feature of beta 2-microglobulin amyloidosis. 
4	Endothelial-derived relaxing factor released by endothelial cells of human umbilical vessels and its impairment in pregnancy-induced hypertension. The principal objective of this study was to determine and compare the capability of human umbilical vessels of normal and pregnancy-induced hypertensive parturients to produce and to release the endothelial-derived relaxing factor. A bolus of bradykinin injected in the perfusion system of human umbilical vessels induces a release of a relaxant factor, detectable by bioassay, that is pharmacologically similar to the endothelial-derived relaxing factor. Human umbilical cords were collected from normal and pregnancy-induced hypertensive parturients. In the latter group the release of endothelial-derived relaxing factor is extremely reduced. In fact, in umbilical vessels collected from normal parturients, bradykinin at a dose of 20 pmol produces a release of endothelial-derived relaxing factor equivalent to a relaxation induced by 59.9 +/- 11.0 and 30.8 +/- 11.4 pmol of glyceryl trinitrate for the artery and vein, respectively. The same dose of bradykinin in umbilical vessels, collected from pregnancy-induced hypertensive parturients, produces a release equivalent to 6.6 +/- 2.2 and 5.7 +/- 3.5 pmol of glyceryl trinitrate equivalent for the artery and vein, respectively. Neither an increasing bolus of exogenous bradykinin or an infusion of superoxide dismutase or L-arginine was able to restore the production of endothelial-derived relaxing factor to normal levels. Our results indicate a probable alteration of endothelial cell numbers or an alteration of the enzymatic pathway, probably due to cytotoxic endogenous factors produced in pregnancy. 
5	Morphological features of blood access stenosis and results of noninvasive angioplasty. We investigated a connection between the results of noninvasive angioplasty for the blood access stenosis and its morphological features in 37 dialysis cases. In 3 cases presenting stenosis in the original artery, the area could not be dilated by noninvasive techniques. In 4 cases with stenosis in the arterialized vein downstream of the needle insertion points for extracorporeal circulation, 3 showed long-term dilatation by the procedures. In 30 cases having stenosis upstream of the points, 16 showed long-term dilatation. In the unsuccessful cases, the angle formed between the axes of the stenosed portion and the normal vessel was over 39 degrees, and the distance between the anastomosis and the stenosed portion was less than 11 mm. 
3	Infarction in the anterior rostral cerebellum (the territory of the lateral branch of the superior cerebellar artery). We report 9 patients with an isolated infarct of the anterior part of the rostral cerebellum, ie, the territory of the lateral branch of the superior cerebellar artery. Clinicoanatomic correlations are based on CT, MRI, or both in 8 patients and on pathologic data in the ninth. The main clinical features were ipsilateral dysmetria and axial lateropulsion, dysarthria, and unsteadiness. In 1 patient, the clinical presentation mimicked a lacunar stroke (dysarthria and clumsy hand syndrome). There were no edematous cerebellar infarcts with signs of brainstem compression, and all patients spontaneously improved without significant sequellae. Angiography in 2 patients and pathologic examination of arteries in 1 patient disclosed no occlusion in the vertebrobasilar system. Six patients had a cardiac source of emboli. In conclusion, infarcts of the anterior part of the rostral cerebellum can be regarded as a benign condition in which there is, frequently, a cardiac source of emboli. 
4	Right ventricular systolic function during exercise with and without significant coronary artery disease. To evaluate the effects of exercise and coronary artery disease on right ventricular (RV) systolic function, rest and exercise biplane RV angiograms were recorded in 20 patients undergoing diagnostic cardiac catheterization. Thirteen patients had exercise angiograms of sufficient quality to undergo analysis and were classified into 2 groups. Group 1 had no or only mild coronary artery disease; group 2 had significant coronary artery disease as manifested by new, exercise-induced, left ventricular regional wall motion abnormalities. RV systolic pressure increased in both groups during exercise: 33 to 57 mm Hg in group 1 (p = 0.0002) and 33 to 55 mm Hg in group 2 (p = 0.0004). Pulmonary resistance did not change in group 1 during exercise but increased in group 2 (3.2 to 4.8 Wood units, p = 0.04). RV ejection fraction increased slightly, but not significantly, during exercise in group 1, but decreased in group 2 (73 vs 58% with exercise [p = 0.01]). The change in RV ejection fraction from rest to exercise correlated closely with the change in pulmonary resistance from rest to exercise (r = -0.89, p less than 0.0001). RV regional wall motion analysis demonstrated a generalized decline in regional ejection fraction in group 2 during exercise, even in patients without right coronary artery disease. In conclusion, there is a decline in RV ejection fraction during exercise in patients with significant coronary artery disease. The generalized reduction in regional RV ejection fraction coupled with the close correlation with the change in pulmonary resistance suggests that increased afterload, rather than RV ischemia, is the cause. 
5	Association of pneumothorax and hypotension with intraventricular haemorrhage. To test the hypothesis that acute hypotension resulting from pneumothorax would be associated with severe brain injury (grade 3 or 4 intraventricular haemorrhage), 67 very low birthweight (VLBW) infants of 32 weeks' gestation or less with respiratory distress syndrome and pneumothorax were studied. Thirty six had pneumothorax associated with systemic hypotension and 31 had pneumothorax with normal blood pressure. The groups were similar in gestational age and severity of their respiratory distress syndrome. Thirty two of 36 of infants with pneumothorax associated with hypotension (89%) had grade 3 or 4 intraventricular haemorrhage. This percentage was significantly greater than the percentage for infants with pneumothorax and normal blood pressure (three of 31, 10%). The risk ratio for grade 3 or 4 intraventricular haemorrhage for infants with pneumothorax associated with hypotension was 9.8 compared with neonates with pneumothorax and normal blood pressure. These observations are consistent with the hypothesis that systemic hypotension and cerebral hypoperfusion are important factors leading to intraventricular haemorrhage in VLBW infants. 
5	Use of ektacytometry to determine red cell susceptibility to oxidative stress. To define a more sensitive and reliable method to determine changes in the overall cellular characteristics of erythrocytes after oxidative damage, we used a viscodiffractometric method (ektacytometry) to measure the effect of oxidative stress. Erythrocytes were incubated in the presence of hydrogen peroxide, t-butyl hydroperoxide, or cumene hydroperoxide in phosphate buffer. This treatment resulted in decreased cellular deformability of the intact erythrocytes. In addition, deformability and fragility measurements of the erythrocyte ghost membranes indicated an increased membrane dynamic rigidity and altered-mechanical stability as a consequence of oxidant stress. These changes were observed before the onset of hemolysis. The observed decrease in deformability was accompanied by oxidation of hemoglobin, alterations of membrane proteins, and lipid peroxidation. To continuously measure the time course of the decrease in deformability in intact erythrocytes under oxidative stress, a new ektacytometric method was developed. Erythrocytes were oxidatively challenged within the viscometer at a constant osmolality and shear stress. The change in deformability was monitored and a typical range was defined for erythrocytes from normal individuals. Comparison of erythrocytes from patients with sickle cell disease with those from normal individuals demonstrated a higher susceptibility of sickle red cells toward oxidative stress. 
1	Iron and the liver. Iron is essential for life, but iron overload is toxic and potentially fatal. The liver is a major site of iron storage and is particularly susceptible to injury from iron overload, especially when (as in primary hemochromatosis) the iron accumulates in hepatocytes. Iron can be taken up by the liver in several forms and by several pathways including: (1) receptor-mediated endocytosis of diferric or monoferric transferrin or ferritin, (2) reduction and carrier-facilitated internalization of iron from transferrin without internalization of the protein moiety of transferrin, (3) electrogenic uptake of low molecular weight, non-protein bound forms of iron, and (4) uptake of heme from heme-albumin, heme-hemopexin, or hemoglobin-haptoglobin complexes. Normally, pathway 2 is probably the major one for uptake of iron by hepatocytes. Iron is stored in the liver in the cores of ferritin shells and as hemosiderin, an insoluble product derived from iron-rich ferritin. Iron in hepatocytes stimulates translation of ferritin mRNA and represses transcription of DNA for transferrin and transferrin receptors. The major pathologic effects of chronic hepatic iron overload are: (1) fibrosis and cirrhosis, (2) porphyria cutanea tarda, and (3) hepatocellular carcinoma. Although precise pathogenetic mechanisms remain unknown, iron probably produces these and other toxic effects by increasing oxidative stress and lysosomal lability. Vigorous efforts at diagnosis and treatment of iron overload are essential since the pathologic effects of iron are totally preventable by early vigorous iron removal and prevention of iron re-accumulation. 
1	The prognostic value of image analysis in ovarian cancer. Histologic grading is very important for treatment decisions in ovarian cancer. All grading systems contain a significant subjective component, which could be reduced by including objective measurements into the diagnostic decision. Image analysis was used to determine nuclear area and ploidy distributions in 42 patients with epithelial ovarian cancer, and the results were related to tumor grade and clinical outcome. The mean nuclear area, mean optical density, number of hyperploid cells, and the standard deviation between measurements were significantly higher in Grade 2 and 3 tumors compared with Grade 1 tumors, in rapidly progressive tumors compared with less aggressive malignancies, and in recurrent tumors compared with primary lesions. The number of nuclei with very high DNA content was found to be of prognostic importance. Image analysis thus provides additional prognostic information in epithelial ovarian cancer. 
5	Persistent primitive trigeminal artery-cavernous sinus fistulas: report of two cases. Two cases of persistent primitive trigeminal artery-cavernous sinus fistulas are presented. In one case, the fistula was treated by using a two-balloon tandem technique. This method was accomplished by introducing, inflating, and detaching a silicone balloon into the trigeminal artery, thus preserving the carotid and basilar blood flow. An unusual case of a similar fistula with only contralateral exophthalmos is also reported. The relationship between this type of fistula and the presence of aneurysms on the persistent primitive trigeminal artery and the relationship with traumatic events are discussed. 
3	Hormonal dependency of cerebral meningiomas. Part 1: Female sex steroid receptors and their significance as specific markers for adjuvant medical therapy. Female sex steroid receptors were examined in 50 human cerebral meningiomas. For estrogen receptors, high-affinity binding sites (dissociation constant (Kd): 0.05 to 0.2 nM) were found in the cytosolic fraction with a capacity of less than 4 fmol/mg protein in 10 meningiomas using a dextran-coated charcoal (DCC) assay. In the same cytosolic fraction, the solid-phase enzyme immunoassay revealed only one cytosol with a positive colorimetric reaction equal to 5 fmol/mg protein. However, in the nuclear compartment, none of the tumors stained positively for estrogen receptors with immunohistochemical techniques. In addition, the most convincing evidence for the absence of estrogen receptors was obtained by in situ hybridization using an oligonucleotide probe complementary to a fraction of the human receptor messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA). In none of the 50 meningiomas was the expression of estrogen mRNA coding for the estrogen receptor detected. For progesterone receptors, high-affinity binding sites (Kd: 0.3 to 2.6 nM) were found in 49 of the 50 tumors using a DCC assay. In the same cytosols, solid-phase enzyme immunoassay revealed that each tumor was positive for progesterone receptors. However, in the nuclear compartment, only five tumors had partially positive staining for progesterone receptors with immunohistochemical techniques. Within the confines of this study, it is concluded that: 1) the estrogen receptor is generally absent in meningioma tissue, and 2) the progesterone receptor is mainly absent in the nuclear compartment, leading to the conclusion that the cytosolic progesterone receptor may be an inactive form. This study suggests that female sex steroid receptors are not primarily involved in the proliferative rate of cerebral meningiomas and that they are of no current significance as markers for adjuvant medical therapy of most meningiomas. 
4	Platelet aggregation is not necessary for occurrence of Raynaud's phenomenon: a clinical history and laboratory results. "Raynaud's phenomenon (R.P.) is characterized by a spastic vasoconstriction of hand and/or feet extremities leading to painful ischemic attacks. In the pathogeny of this syndrome the role of a platelet hyperactivation was evidenced. Nevertheless, the responsibility of platelet aggregation remains controversial. We report here the case of a patient presenting with a Glanzmann thrombasthenia defined by the complete lack of platelet aggregation, and showing a typical RP which was confirmed by the measurement of hand temperature and the decrease of digital and hand blood flow. Thus, the description of this case shows that platelet aggregation by itself is not necessary for the occurrence of RP, and encourages for therapeutic purposes the development of vasodilatators rather than platelet antiaggregants agents.". 
3	Olfactory identification deficits in HIV infection. OBJECTIVE: Impaired odor identification is described in a number of CNS disorders, and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infects the CNS in a large percentage of patients. To evaluate whether impaired olfaction may indicate CNS disease, the authors measured odor identification in patient groups defined along a continuum of progressive immunodeficiency and in a comparison group. METHOD: Most of the 42 HIV-infected patients in the study were outpatients in a clinic specializing in treatment of HIV-infected individuals. The comparison subjects were 37 healthy age- and sex-matched individuals who were recruited from hospital and medical school personnel. Ten of the patients were HIV-seropositive but had no symptoms, 24 had clinical evidence of immunocompromise, and eight had HIV dementia. All subjects were given the University of Pennsylvania Smell Identification Test, which presents common odorants and requires the subject to identify the odor from a four-item word list. The data were analyzed by using analysis of variance after arc-sine transformation and Scheffe post hoc analysis. RESULTS: All patients scored significantly lower on the Smell Identification Test than did the comparison subjects. The patients with HIV dementia had significantly lower scores than did the other two groups of patients. CONCLUSIONS: Clinically, impaired olfaction might serve as a marker of early CNS HIV involvement. Future studies should attempt to match comparison and experimental populations for socioeconomic status and HIV risk behavior. 
5	Obstructive sleep apnoea in children undergoing routine tonsillectomy and adenoidectomy. Sleep screening was used to discover the incidence of sleep apnoea in 50 children undergoing routine adenotonsillectomy for recurrent upper respiratory tract infections, randomly selected from the waiting list. Preoperative assessment included a detailed parental history, physical examination, and lateral cephalometry, in order to identify factors that might alert the clinician to a diagnosis of obstructive sleep apnoea. There were 2 equal groups of snorers and non-snorers (grade 0); 1 patient was found to have the sleep apnoea syndrome (IV), 9 patients had obstructive snoring with apnoeic episodes (III), 3 patients had snoring with a disrupted sleep pattern (II), and 12 patients snored with no disruption of sleep (I). In identifying patients with apnoea, a history of snoring was unhelpful, whereas one of breathing irregularities was found to be highly specific. Nasal obstruction correlated poorly; however, there was a significant relationship between tonsillar position and size and sleep grade (Chi-squared P less than 0.01). Stepwise regression analysis showed a large contribution to the grading was made by the size of the oropharyngeal airway measured by lateral cephalometry. The children in grade II-IV were re-studied 3 months post-operatively and all reverted to grades 0 or I. 
2	Outbreak of diarrhoea due to Escherichia coli O111:B4 in schoolchildren and adults: association of Vi antigen-like reactivity. During six days in November, 1987, 611 pupils (age range 7-19 years) and 39 adults (23-57) at a school complex in southern Finland had diarrhoea due to Escherichia coli O111:B4. Diarrhoea developed in 137 other household members during the two weeks after the school outbreak. The source of the organism remains unknown. The outbreak strains, when incubated at 22 degrees C or exposed to ampicillin, lost the lipopolysaccharide O antigen and began to react with antisera against Salmonella typhi Vi antigen. The Vi antigen-like reactivity increased the adherence of the organisms to Hep-2 cells. These results indicate that E coli O111:B4, and possibly other enteropathogenic E coli strains, should be considered in the diagnosis of all diarrhoea cases and not only in infantile diarrhoea. Expression of Vi antigen in E coli may play a part in virulence by enhancing adherence to the intestinal epithelium. 
4	Mucoid vasculopathy of unknown etiology. A new vascular disorder with generalized deposition of abnormal amounts of acid mucopolysaccharide (AMPS) material in arteries, veins, and vasanervorum has been observed in a large number of autopsies at the author's institution. It is unlike any of the known vascular diseases and has emerged as a distinct disorder of vascular connective tissue. This has been named "mucoid vasculopathy of unknown etiology." This hitherto unreported entity is described here. 
3	Management of meralgia paresthetica Meralgia paresthetica is a syndrome of pain or dysesthesia, or both, in the anterolateral thigh caused by entrapment or neurinoma formation of the lateral femoral cutaneous nerve. Conservative treatment was successful in relieving symptoms in 91% of 277 patients with this syndrome; however, 24 patients required surgical treatment for intractable symptoms. Although neurolysis with transposition is the most common procedure, sectioning of the lateral femoral cutaneous nerve was performed in 24 cases and was successful in 23. One patient had early symptomatic relief, but subsequently developed different neurological signs and symptoms because of an undetected pelvic neoplasm. Anatomical variations of the nerve and neurinomas, which occur frequently, are easily handled with sectioning but may lead to recurrence with neurolysis and transposition. 
4	Retroperitoneal air after routine hemorrhoidectomy. Report of a case. Retroperitoneal air as a complication after routine hemorrhoidectomy has not been reported in the literature. This occurred recently after hemorrhoidectomy in a 34-year-old patient receiving glucocorticoid therapy for rheumatoid arthritis. Adverse steroidal effects of wound healing have been well documented. It is believed that steroid-induced tissue changes contributed to the development of this unique complication. 
5	Lack of bone accretion and amenorrhea: evidence for a relative osteopenia in weight-bearing bones. Bone mineral density (BMD) was studied in young exercising amenorrheic girls to determine if density was compromised and the change related to injury. Ninety-eight volunteers (professional ballet dancers and controls) were studied in a cross-sectional study. Dancers and controls were further subdivided into normally cycling and amenorrheic subjects. Amenorrhea significantly lowered bone density of the spine (P less than 0.0001), wrist (P less than 0.03), and metatarsal (P less than 0.01); effects on the wrist were eliminated by controlling for age while controlling for weight eliminated all effects of amenorrhea at three sites. BMD of the metatarsal, a weight-bearing bone, showed an interaction between amenorrhea and dancing (exercising) P less than 0.035); surprisingly, dancing was associated with a further lowering of bone density. This interaction was eliminated when controlling for age, but not when controlling for weight. With multiple comparisons of the groups, spine, wrist, and metatarsal bone density was significantly lower in amenorrheic dancers when compared to normal dancers (P less than 0.05), even when controlling for age and weight in the metatarsal (P less than 0.05), and age in the spine (P less than 0.05). Estradiol levels correlated with bone density of both the wrist and the spine (r = 0.25, r = 0.23, P less than 0.02). Metatarsal density correlated with estradiol levels only in the dancers (r = 0.34, P less than 0.02). The only variable found to correlate with the occurrence of stress fractures was age of menarche. This was also the only variable of 9 (BMD of the wrist, spine or foot, calories ingested and expended, amount of calcium ingested, involvement in high energy activity, age of menarche or presence of amenorrhea) to predict stress fractures. Thus, BMD is significantly affected by the presence of amenorrhea but the effects are generally weight dependent. The compensatory increase in bone density generally seen in stressed bones, such as the metatarsal in ballet dancers, is deficient in amenorrheic premenopausal women even when controlling for weight but this effect may be age and estrogen dependent. Bone mass may not accumulate in the same manner in adolescents as in the mature women, thus putting them at risk for injury. 
5	Intracranial hemorrhage from aneurysms and arteriovenous malformations during pregnancy and the puerperium. Intracranial hemorrhage (ICH) from an intracranial aneurysm or arteriovenous malformation is a grave complication of pregnancy and is responsible for 5 to 12% of all maternal deaths. We critically analyzed 154 cases of verified ICH during pregnancy from an identified intracranial lesion, including 2 patients treated at our institution and 152 cases previously reported in the literature in English. Aneurysms were responsible for ICH in 77% of patients, and arteriovenous malformations in 23%. Hemorrhage occurred antepartum in 92% of patients and postpartum in 8%. Women with angiomatous hemorrhage were younger than those with aneurysmal hemorrhage; however, in contrast to previous reports, we found no differences between angiomatous and aneurysmal hemorrhage with respect to parity or gestational age at the time of the initial hemorrhage. Hypertension and/or albuminuria were present at some time during the pregnancy in 34% of patients with documentation, which sometimes made it difficult to differentiate angiomatous or aneurysmal ICH from that associated with eclampsia. In a logistic regression analysis, surgical management of aneurysms, but not arteriovenous malformations, was associated with significantly lower maternal and fetal mortality, independent of other covariants. For those patients with a lesion not operated on, cesarean delivery afforded no better maternal or fetal outcome than did vaginal delivery. We conclude that the decision to operate after ICH during pregnancy should be based upon neurosurgical principles, whereas the method of delivery should be based upon obstetrical considerations. The perioperative and anesthetic management of the pregnant patient with a neurosurgical complication is discussed. 
5	The clinical course of residual carotid arterial disease. Over a 5-year period 642 patients underwent 686 carotid endarterectomies with patch closure and intraoperative surveillance with continuous-wave Doppler. The perioperative stroke rate was 1.5%. Patients were screened with duplex scans immediately after operation for the presence of residual carotid lesions, and followed every 3 to 6 months for either the development of a true recurrent lesion or a change in a residual one. Five hundred thirty-nine arteries (84%) had no postoperative abnormalities. The incidence of recurrent carotid lesions in this groups was 1.5%, 3.4%, and 5.2% at 1, 2, and 3 years, respectively. The incidence of symptoms in this group was 0.2%, 0.7%, and 1.4% at 1, 2, and 3 years, respectively. The earliest recurrence or symptom occurred 8 months from operation. One hundred forty-seven arteries had residual lesions that were more common when either a temporary shunt was used or the operation was carried out above the hypoglossal nerve or below the omohyoid muscle. Sixty-one patients who had plaque proximal to the arteriotomy without a significant stenosis were followed an average of 21 months. There were no changes in plaque morphology and no proven symptoms related to the residual lesion. Fifty-six patients with both plaque and significant hemodynamic abnormalities in the carotid bulb were followed an average of 18 months. Seven of these patients (12.5%) had either a significant deterioration of the lesion or a symptom from it. Each event occurred within 6 months of operation. Thirty patients had significant flow abnormalities but no visible plaque. None of these lesions deteriorated. Although common, residual carotid lesions are benign unless the lesion is characterized by both plaque within the artery and a hemodynamically significant stenosis. These lesions should be further investigated and treated when discovered. 
4	Granulomatous vasculitis in Crohn's disease [published erratum appears in Gastroenterology 1991 Aug;101(2):595] This study investigated a possible vascular origin for granulomas in Crohn's disease. Twenty-four consecutive resected specimens of small and large intestinal Crohn's disease were preserved by arterial perfusion-fixation with 10% formol saline, at mean arterial pressure (100 mm Hg). Fifteen specimens contained granulomas on routine examination of H&E-stained sections. These 15 specimens were examined in detail using a range of immunohistochemical staining techniques to identify vascular structures and granulomas. A total of 485 granulomas were found, 85% of which were identified as being directly involved in vascular injury. The majority (77%) of granulomas were deep to the mucosa; they were found most frequently in the submucosa (42%). The techniques used in this study enhanced the recognition of granulomatous vasculitis. The results suggest that the majority of granulomas in Crohn's disease form within walls of blood vessels. Vascular localization of granulomatous inflammation suggests that the intestinal microvasculature contains an early element in the pathogenesis of Crohn's disease. 
3	Tension pneumocephalus: treatment with controlled decompression via a closed water-seal drainage system. Case report. The successful treatment of a patient with tension pneumocephalus by controlled decompression via external drainage is described. The advantage of the technique includes the immediate release of high pressure and the capability of maintaining constant low pressure to enable and facilitate sealing of dural tears. The method has been used in three other patients, leading to resolution of the tension pneumocephalus without recurrence or other complications. 
5	Femoral noninfected anastomotic aneurysms. A report of 56 cases. Fifty-six femoral non infected anastomotic false aneurysms (FAAs) were observed in 49 patients admitted to the Institute of Vascular Surgery, University of Milan, from 1975 to 1988; in 6 patients they were bilateral. These aneurysms developed after primary revascularization procedures at a mean interval of 66 months (range 12 to 156 months); one recurred after reparative surgery. Forty-four FAAs (78.6%) were asymptomatic, whereas 3 (5.3%) were complicated by acute expansion and 9 (16.1%) by thrombosis. Host vessel degeneration was the cause of aneurysm formation in most cases. A history of hypertension was present in 30% of the patients. All anastomotic aneurysms were operated upon except for one small aneurysm that was asymptomatic. In 5 patients aneurysm resection was carried out on both sides. The surgical technique was endoaneurysmectomy in all the cases with insertion of an interposition graft in 48 cases, a fabric patch in 2 cases and prosthesis re-anastomosis in 5 cases. One case of peripheral embolization occurring in the early postoperative period was successfully treated and there was no operative mortality. In our opinion elective repair of these aneurysms should be recommended whenever possible because of their propensity to develop serious complications and the operative morbidity is low. 
5	Combined surgical resection and iridium 192 implantation for locally advanced and recurrent desmoid tumors. Thirty-eight histologically confirmed desmoid tumors were treated with conservative surgical resection and interstitial iridium 192. Patients included in this series constituted a poor prognostic group. Seventy five percent (75%) had previous recurrences of their disease and 50% had tumors 8 cm or greater in size. In addition, 16% of the patients had gross residual disease after surgical excision and 79% had positive or close margins of resection. With a median follow-up of 5.5 years, the 5-year actuarial in-field local control rate was 75% and the overall local control rate was 66%. Four of the 12 local recurrences developed at the periphery of the implant volume and four patients failed at least 3 cm or more beyond the treated volume. After salvage therapy, the 5-year actuarial local control rate was 95%. Two patients required amputation for recurrent disease. Thirty of 34 patients remain free of disease with an excellent functional result achieved. The authors conclude that surgical resection and postoperative interstitial iridium 192 is effective therapy for patients with desmoid tumors. Despite the fact that most patients in this series had bulky, recurrent tumors, excellent long-term local control and limb function were achieved. 
1	Antagonism of serotonin S3 receptors with ondansetron prevents nausea and emesis induced by cyclophosphamide-containing chemotherapy regimens The control of nausea and emesis in cancer patients receiving chemotherapy poses a significant management problem. In this randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study, we evaluated the effect of serotonin S3 receptor blockade with ondansetron (GR 38032F) on the prevention of nausea and vomiting induced by cyclophosphamide-containing chemotherapy. Cyclophosphamide was given in doses of 500 to 600 mg/m2 and ondansetron as three intravenous (IV) doses of 0.15 mg/kg. Most patients had breast cancer. Cyclophosphamide was given in combination with doxorubicin (65% of patients) or with fluorouracil (85% of patients: 50% with Adriamycin [doxorubicin; Adria Laboratories, Columbus, OH] and 35% with methotrexate). All placebo-treated patients experienced vomiting, whereas 70% of patients treated with ondansetron did not vomit (P = .008). Median nausea scores were 8 mm on ondansetron and 65 mm on placebo (P less than .001). Seventy percent of patients treated with ondansetron retained their normal appetite, compared with 10% of placebo patients. Adverse events occurred in six placebo patients and one ondansetron patient. Diarrhea and headache were the most common events, both occurring more frequently in the placebo group. There were no extrapyramidal reactions, and the only significant biochemical change occurred in a placebo-treated patient. These results suggest that serotonin S3 receptor antagonists represent a novel, effective, and safe mode of therapy for nausea and emesis induced by cyclophosphamide-containing chemotherapies. In addition, our observations are compatible with the view that serotonin, acting on S3 receptors, mediates the nausea and emesis occurring after cyclophosphamide chemotherapy. 
5	Development of a small caliber biologic vascular graft: evaluation of its antithrombogenicity and the early healing process. The authors previously showed that a small caliber xenograft using our crosslinking technique was applicable to aortocoronary bypass grafting. In this study of the graft, the antithrombogenicity and healing process was evaluated at an early stage after implantation. Fresh sheep carotid artery (3mm ID) was obtained and cross-linked with polyepoxy compounds, and then used as a small caliber vascular graft. The graft was white and soft. Six cm segments of the graft were implanted into the carotid arteries bilaterally in nine dogs. Sodium heparin was given during the surgery, but no anticoagulant was used postoperatively. Fifteen grafts from eight dogs were removed from 1 hr to 30 days after implantation, and 13 of 15 grafts were found to be patent. Two grafts, one at 3 days, and the other at 14 days, were occluded. The anastomotic area of the occluded grafts felt hard when touched from the outside. In one dog, the grafts were shown angiographically to be patent at 14 days after implantation, and this dog was kept for long-term observation. Macroscopically, no thrombus was observed on any of the patent grafts. Microscopically, the inner surface near the anastomotic lines was covered with endothelial cells, and infiltration of fibroblasts was observed from the outside 7 days after implantation. No foreign body reactions were seen around the graft. After 30 days of implantation, a thin layer of plasma protein at the middle of the graft was observed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM). From these observations, it was concluded that the grafts exhibited satisfactory early antithrombogenicity and healing after implantation. 
5	Surgery in patients on long-term steroid therapy: a tentative model for risk assessment. Increased morbidity after operation has been associated with long-term steroid therapy. To determine the correlation between steroid therapy and such morbidity, the perioperative course of 55 steroid-treated patients was reviewed: 27 had bronchopulmonary disorders (group P) and 28 had non-pulmonary diseases (group NP). There were six (11 per cent) deaths, of which three were steroid related. Among the 13 non-lethal postoperative complications, eight were considered to be steroid related in group P and one in group NP. The duration of steroid therapy was for a median of 24 months (range 1-408 months) in group P and for a median of 6 months (range 1-240 months) in group NP (P less than 0.01). In contrast, the daily dose of hydrocortisone or equivalent before operation was significantly lower in group P, with a median of 0.51 mg kg-1 day-1 (range 0.20-2.56 mg kg-1 day-1) than in group NP, with a median of 1.20 mg kg-1 day-1 (range 0.23-7.38 mg kg-1 day-1) (P less than 0.01). In conclusion, bronchopulmonary disorders requiring a long duration of steroid therapy are associated with a higher risk of steroid-related complications after surgery. A convenient mathematical model is proposed which may allow a preoperative assessment of surgical risk, using steroid dose and duration of treatment. 
5	Dynamic analysis of the Harrington system using a spinal simulator. The authors constructed a spinal simulator for the thoracolumbar spine with mechanical properties similar to those of cadaver specimens, and studied the effectiveness of the Harrington system in unstable fractures of the thoracolumbar spine. Distraction and compression rods were applied under various conditions. External bending moment was applied to the model to measure the internal bending moment on the vertebral body and ligaments. Optimal spinal stability was obtained when the distraction system was combined with the compression system with hooks at laminas three levels above and below the fracture.
