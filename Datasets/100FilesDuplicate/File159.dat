Nd:YAG laser hyperthermia treatment of rat mammary adenocarcinoma in conjunction with surface cooling. Electromagnetic radiation ranging from radiofrequency to microwave has classically been used to induce hyperthermia for treatment of cancer. This paper presents a new technique using near infrared radiation from an Nd:YAG laser in conjunction with surface cooling to induce hyperthermia in a rat tumor model. A CW Nd:YAG laser hyperthermia system was used to induce hyperthermic temperatures in chemically (DMBA) induced rat mammary adenocarcinomas. The laser was interfaced to a computer and a thermometry unit that provided feedback to control the tumor temperature between 43.2-43.5 degrees C. A thermocouple was placed at the base of the tumor and its temperature was used to control laser exposure. All tumors were 10 to 20 mm in diameter. Surface cooling methods investigated included forced air flow from a fan, forced oxygen flow plus an IV drip, and forced moist oxygen flow from a nebulizer. Twelve rat mammary adenocarcinomas have been treated with Nd:YAG laser hyperthermia. In 4 treatments, no surface cooling was employed. In one treatment the surface was cooled using oxygen flow plus IV drip. In 7 treatments the skin was cooled using the nebulizer technique. The nebulization provided the most effective and reproducible surface cooling. Nd:YAG laser hyperthermia delivered in conjunction with nebulizer surface cooling produced efficient heating of rat mammary adenocarcinomas. A mean temperature of 42.1 degrees C was obtained at the base of the tumors while the mean surface temperature was 37.0 degrees C. 
Estimates of radiation absorbed dose for intraperitoneally administered iodine-131 radiolabeled B72.3 monoclonal antibody in patients with peritoneal carcinomatoses. Using a newly available model for determining estimates of radiation absorbed dose of radioisotopes administered intraperitoneally, we have calculated absorbed dose to tumor and normal tissues based on a surgically controlled study of radiolabeled antibody distribution. Ten patients with peritoneal carcinomatosis received intraperitoneal injections of the murine monoclonal antibody B72.3 radiolabeled with 131I. Biodistribution studies were performed using nuclear medicine methods until laparotomy at 4-14 days after injection. Surgical biopsies of normal tissues and tumor were obtained. The marrow was predicted to be the critical organ, with maximum tolerated dose [200 rad (2 Gy) to marrow] expected at about 200 mCi (7.4 GBq). In patients with large intraperitoneal tumor deposits, the tumor itself is an important source tissue for radiation exposure to normal tissues. Local "hot-spots" for tumor-absorbed dose were observed, with maximum tumor-absorbed dose calculated at 11,000 rad (11 Gy) per 100 mCi (3.7 GBq) administered intraperitoneal; however, tumor rad dose varied considerably. This may pose serious problems for curative therapy, especially in patients with large tumor burdens. 
The clinical course of perimesencephalic nonaneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage We studied the early clinical course of 65 patients with perimesencephalic (nonaneurysmal) subarachnoid hemorrhage. None of the patients rebled; none had delayed cerebral ischemia; and only 3 patients (5%) developed clinical signs of acute hydrocephalus, 2 requiring ventricular shunting. Hyponatremia and electrocardiographic changes were found in the same proportions as in patients with aneurysmal rupture. All patients had a good outcome after 3 months. To control for the influence of the relatively small amount of cisternal blood in perimesencephalic hemorrhage on the absence of delayed cerebral ischemia, we compared these 65 patients with 49 patients who had aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage. This control group with aneurysms was selected according to a similar amount of cisternal blood, a comparable level of consciousness on admission, and absence of other factors known to increase the risk for delayed cerebral ischemia. We found that 4 of the 49 patients with aneurysmal hemorrhage developed delayed cerebral ischemia (Fisher's exact test, p = 0.03); therefore the relatively small amount of blood does not account for the absence of delayed cerebral ischemia in perimesencephalic hemorrhage. Patients with a perimesencephalic pattern of hemorrhage and a normal angiogram should be considered to have a distinct subset of subarachnoid hemorrhage and should be excluded from future treatment trials of patients with subarachnoid hemorrhage. 
The hyperekplexias and their relationship to the normal startle reflex. The startle response to unexpected auditory and somaesthetic stimulation was studied in 8 patients with hereditary or symptomatic hyperekplexia. It was abnormal in its resistance to habituation and in its exaggerated motor response. Both noise and taps to the face and head elicited a normal early blink response, separate from the subsequent true startle reflex. The earliest reflex EMG activity recorded after the blink was in sternocleidomastoid. EMG activity in masseter, and trunk and limb muscles followed later. This pattern of muscle recruitment suggests a brainstem origin for the abnormal startle responses. In addition, the abnormal startle responses exhibited disproportionately long latencies to the intrinsic hand and foot muscles and relatively slow recruitment of caudal muscles. The pattern of muscle recruitment was similar between patients, irrespective of the absolute latency of the response, and regardless of whether stimulation was auditory or somaesthetic. This suggests that auditory and somaesthetic afferents converge on a common brainstem efferent system, and that this system forms the final common pathway for abnormal startle responses of differing latency. The characteristics of this efferent system differ from those previously described in brainstem reticular reflex myoclonus, but are similar to those described in the normal auditory startle reflex in man. This suggests that the abnormal startle response in hyperekplexia, and the normal startle reflex represent pathological and physiological activity in the same brainstem efferent system. 
Granulocyte function in coronary artery disease. Granulocytes defend the body against invading microbes by producing a complex armamentarium of toxic substances, such as proteolytic enzymes, oxygen radicals and arachidonic acid metabolites. Under certain circumstances, however, such compounds may be released in the absence of phagocytosable particles, resulting in injury to normal cell and connective tissue degradation. Recent experimental studies have emphasized the potential role of granulocytes in the pathogenesis of myocardial ischemia. Clinical investigations have also shown alterations in neutrophil function in stable and unstable clinical manifestations of ischemic heart disease. "Priming" of granulocytes in stable forms of coronary disease may predispose to the subsequent development of acute coronary events, whereas activation of neutrophils may lead to alterations in vascular permeability and coronary flow regulation, leading to further myocardial and endothelial injury in acute myocardial infarction, unstable angina and coronary angioplasty. 
Severe lactic acidosis related to acute thiamine deficiency. The authors report a case of severe lactic acidosis in a 3-year-old boy, after 20 days of total parenteral nutrition without vitamin supplementation. This child with acute lymphoblastic leukemia underwent a period of severe refractory lactic acidosis (pH between 6.81 and 7.00 and a serum lactate level up to 38 mmol/liter) leading to cardiac arrest. After the initial resuscitation and the subsequent treatment of shock and vitamin K deficiency, acute peritoneal dialysis was instituted to correct the severe lactic acidosis. Initial low plasma thiamine levels confirmed the diagnosis of thiamine deficiency. An associated transient pancreatic dysfunction was also noted. The patient's overall course with thiamine replacement therapy led to a complete recovery within 5 days and no sequelae were noted after 12 months. 
Assessment of aortic regurgitation by the acceleration flow signal void proximal to the leaking orifice in cinemagnetic resonance imaging. BACKGROUND. The proximal acceleration flow region is a laminar flow field that is located immediately upstream from the leaking orifice. The purpose of this study was to evaluate whether cinemagnetic resonance imaging can provide information regarding the proximal acceleration flow region in patients with aortic regurgitation and to analyze the relation between the area of the proximal acceleration flow delineated by cinemagnetic resonance imaging and the severity of aortic regurgitation delineated by angiography. METHODS AND RESULTS. Thirty-eight consecutive patients who underwent aortography were examined by cinemagnetic resonance imaging. The region of proximal flow acceleration was identified as a semicircular-shaped signal void in the aorta during diastole. Cinemagnetic resonance imaging detected the proximal acceleration flow region in 26 of the 30 patients who were proved to have this lesion (sensitivity, 87%). In eight patients without aortic regurgitation according to aortography, no proximal acceleration flow region was detected (specificity, 100%). The area of the acceleration flow signal void from the long-axis view was well correlated with angiographic degree of aortic regurgitation. CONCLUSIONS. Cinemagnetic resonance imaging is useful in detecting the proximal acceleration flow region and permits noninvasive assessment of the severity of aortic regurgitation. 
Neutrophil activation is confined to the maternal circulation in pregnancy-induced hypertension. The aim of this study was to determine whether neutrophil activation occurs in the fetal circulation in pregnancy-induced hypertension and to correlate this with evidence of neutrophil activation in the maternal circulation. Twenty-one normal pregnancies and 23 complicated by pregnancy-induced hypertension were studied in the third trimester. The mean length of gestation at delivery was significantly shorter (P less than .01) and the mean birth weight percentile was significantly lower (P less than .05) in the hypertensive group; otherwise the groups were comparable. Blood was obtained before cesarean delivery or established labor in the mothers and immediately after delivery from the umbilical vein. Plasma neutrophil elastase, which is released after neutrophil activation, was measured by radioimmunoassay as a marker for neutrophil activation. The mean (+/- standard error) concentration of neutrophil elastase in maternal plasma in the hypertensive group (35.9 +/- 4.7 ng/mL) was significantly higher than in the normal group (20.8 +/- 0.87 ng/mL) (P less than .005). The concentration of neutrophil elastase in umbilical venous plasma was not significantly different between the normal and hypertensive groups. However, significantly higher concentrations of neutrophil elastase were found in the umbilical venous plasma of pregnancies delivered vaginally compared with those delivered by cesarean (P less than .05) regardless of diagnosis. There was no correlation between maternal venous and umbilical venous plasma neutrophil elastase concentrations, birth weight percentile, plasma urate, or platelet count. These data suggest that neutrophil activation is confined to the maternal circulation in pregnancy-induced hypertension where it may contribute to vascular damage and dysfunction in areas such as the placental bed. 
The anterior inferior cerebellar artery in the internal auditory canal. It has been proposed that compression of the auditory and vestibular nerve trunks by vascular loops might be the cause of otherwise unexplained hearing loss, tinnitus, and vertigo, as well as Meniere's disease. We studied the human temporal bone histological collection at the Massachusetts Eye and Ear Infirmary to determine whether audiovestibular symptoms could be correlated with the presence of the anterior inferior cerebellar artery within the internal auditory canal. Anterior inferior cerebellar artery loops were found within the internal auditory canals of 12.3% of 1327 temporal bones, about half the number found when preparations with intact brains are studied. This difference can be attributed to avulsion of the anterior inferior cerebellar artery during removal of the brain at autopsy. There were 5 cases of unexplained unilateral hearing loss with anterior inferior cerebellar artery loops: 3 in the opposite ear and 2 in both ears. There were 2 cases with unilateral unexplained tinnitus with anterior inferior cerebellar artery loops: 1 in the involved ear and 1 in the opposite ear. A case with bilateral tinnitus had an anterior inferior cerebellar artery loop in 1 ear. There were 29 cases of vertigo with no peripheral histopathological correlate or central nervous system disorder; anterior inferior cerebellar artery loops were found in the internal auditory canals of 7 (12.5%) of the 56 ears in this group, which is not significantly different from the 12.3% incidence recorded for the entire collection. In 23 cases of unilateral Meniere's disease, there were anterior inferior cerebellar artery loops in the hydropic ears in 3, the opposite ear in 1, and both ears in 1. We can find no correlation between unexplained hearing loss, tinnitus, vertigo, or Meniere's disease and the presence of the anterior inferior cerebellar artery in the internal auditory canal. 
Identification and characterization of a low-affinity granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor receptor on primary and cultured human melanoma cells. Hematopoietic growth factor receptors are present on cells of normal nonhematopoietic tissues such as endothelium and placenta. We previously demonstrated functional human granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) receptors on small cell carcinoma of the lung cell lines, and others have reported that certain solid tumor cell lines respond to GM-CSF in clonogenic assays. In the current study, we examine human melanoma cell lines and fresh specimens of melanoma to determine whether they have functional GM-CSF receptors. Scatchard analyses of 125I-GM-CSF equilibrium binding to melanoma cell lines showed a mean of 542 +/- 67 sites per cell with a kd of 0.72 +/- 0.14 nmol/L. Cross-linking studies in the melanoma cell line, M14, showed a major GM-CSF receptor species of 84,000 daltons. Under the conditions tested, the M14 cells did not have a proliferative response to GM-CSF in vitro, nor was any induction of primary response genes detected by Northern analysis in response to GM-CSF. Studies to determine internal translocation of the receptor-ligand complex indicated less than 10% of the 125I-GM-CSF internalized was specifically bound to receptors. Primary melanoma cells from five surgical specimens had GM-CSF receptors; Scatchard analysis was performed on one sample, showing 555 sites/cell with a kd of 0.23 nmol/L. These results indicate that human tumor cells may express a low-affinity GM-CSF receptor protein that localizes to the cell surface and binds ligand, but lacks functional components or accessory factors needed to transduce a signal. 
Primary anterior mediastinal B-cell lymphoma. A clinicopathologic and immunohistochemical study of 16 cases. Sixteen cases of primary anterior mediastinal B-cell lymphoma were characterized by morphologic, immunophenotypic, and clinical profiles. Twelve were men and four were women. The median age was 42 years. Virtually all tumors were of large cell type. Three main morphologic categories were identified, with one rare exception. In some tumors, the cells were compatible with centrocytes and centroblasts (four). Others had cells readily identifiable as centroblasts (six). Both these groups had a variable proportion of cells with multilobed nuclei. A third group was composed mainly of unclassifiable cells with multilobed nuclei (five). All had discernible sclerosis of varying intensity. A wider range of morphologic features and different sex distribution was noticed in comparison with previously reported clear cell features and younger women. The dominant phenotype of these B-cell lymphomas was CD19+, CD22+, CD37+, CD21-, CD30-, CD10-, CD5-, and Ig-negative. The finding of CD21-, Ig-negative phenotype, as observed by the authors and others, overlaps with some high-grade lymphomas of follicular center cell origin but is thought to bear similarity to a noncirculating population of thymic medullary B-cells. The tumors attained large size without peripheral dissemination and responded to chemotherapy as well as radiotherapy. 
Scirrhous carcinoma of the stomach versus hypertrophic gastritis: findings at endoscopic US. To differentiate scirrhous carcinoma from hypertrophic gastritis, 16 patients with scirrhous carcinoma of the stomach and seven patients with hypertrophic gastritis were examined with endoscopic ultrasonography (US) between August 1987 and October 1990. US images of the normal gastric walls of 16 patients with gastric ulcers served as controls. Characteristic features of scirrhous carcinoma included an irregular hypoechoic enlargement of the third (submucosa) and fourth (muscularis propria) layers. The mean thickness of the third and fourth layers was increased sixfold and threefold, respectively, compared with thickness in healthy subjects. In the patients with scirrhous carcinoma, the mucosal layer remained normal in appearance at US, and it was possible to distinguish the five-layer structure of the gastric wall. These findings were prospectively correlated with histopathologic findings in the resected specimens. In contrast, only the mucosal layer was thickened in cases of hypertrophic gastritis. Recognition of these patterns at US can aid in the differential diagnosis of scirrhous carcinoma and such benign diseases as hypertrophic gastritis with a thickened gastric wall. 
Enhanced detection of intracardiac sources of cerebral emboli by transesophageal echocardiography. We performed transesophageal echocardiography in 50 consecutive hospitalized patients with recent transient ischemic attack or stroke of embolic origin to determine whether transesophageal echocardiography is more sensitive than transthoracic echocardiography in detection of possible intracardiac sources of embolism. Twenty-six of 50 patients with a negative transthoracic echocardiogram for potential source of emboli had a transesophageal echocardiography study that demonstrated at least one intracardiac abnormality. Abnormalities noted by transesophageal echocardiography included five of 50 patients with either a left atrial or left atrial appendage clot, four patients with a patent foramen ovale, and nine patients with spontaneous echocardiographic contrast. In 11 of 50 patients with no other source of embolism, we found highly mobile filamentous strands on the mitral valve, which have not been described previously. These mitral valve echo strands may represent a fissured surface or fibrosis that can serve as a nidus for thrombus formation. We detected no unexpected left ventricular thrombus or left atrial myxoma. Factors significantly associated with a greater likelihood of a positive transesophageal echocardiography study included left atrial enlargement, atrial fibrillation, and a calcified or thickened mitral valve. Our study suggests that transesophageal echocardiography is a valuable addition to transthoracic echocardiography in investigating potential intracardiac sources of embolism. 
Ependymoma: internal correlations among pathological signs: the anaplastic variant. In a series of 298 cases of ependymoma, survival analysis identified some prognostic histological factors but failed to demonstrate a worse survival for the anaplastic variant diagnosed with the common criteria used for assessing anaplasia in primitive brain tumors. This finding suggests that either anaplastic ependymoma does not exist, or that the established criteria are not useful in its identification. To solve these problems, the association of histological, immunohistochemical, and ultrastructural signs in 173 intracranial cases was investigated and analyzed by means of contingency tables. Many signs had only focal distribution. Some signs, meaningful for anaplasia, such as very high cell density and number of mitoses, were found to be associated, whereas other signs usually considered indicative of anaplasia, such as endothelial hyperplasia, glomeruli, and necrosers, were not. In addition, pseudorosettes, mesodermic areas, and incomplete formation of perivascular pseudorosettes were signs associated with very high cell density and number of mitoses. Distribution of glial fibrillary acidic protein and vimentin, as well as other immunohistochemical and ultrastructural features, were not helpful, with the exception of microsettes found by electron microscopy. Our conclusion is that the anaplastic variant of ependymoma is recognizable only when some histological prognostic factors, such as cell density and number of mitoses, are maximally expressed. 
Complications of percutaneous intra-aortic balloon pump use in patients with peripheral vascular disease. Percutaneous intra-aortic balloon pump use may carry an increased risk for patients with peripheral vascular disease. To determine the incidence and types of associated complications, the medical records of 144 patients who underwent a total of 153 percutaneous intra-aortic balloon pump insertions were reviewed. Patients were divided into two groups. Group 1 was composed of 20 patients with a history of peripheral vascular disease. Group 2 was composed of 124 patients without such history; they underwent a total of 133 insertions. Nineteen major complications (12%) occurred, 12 in group 1 (60% of 20 insertions) and seven in group 2 (5% of 133 insertions). Major complications were further classified by their nature: embolic, occlusive, and technical. All three types of complications occurred more frequently in group 1. Embolic complications occurred more frequently in patients with aneurysms and proved the most lethal, with two of six deaths in group 1 resulting from this complication. 
Influence of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibition on pump function and cardiac contractility in patients with chronic congestive heart failure. Eleven patients with coronary artery disease and chronic heart failure were studied before and three months after the angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor enalapril was added to their frusemide medication. The following were measured: left ventricular pressure and volume with transient occlusion of the inferior vena cava, radionuclide angiography, and hormone concentrations in plasma. As in other reported studies, the clinical condition of the patients improved and their exercise tolerance increased moderately. Addition of enalapril reduced end diastolic and systolic pressure, reduced ventricular volume, and concomitantly increased the ejection fraction. The end systolic pressure-volume relation shifted to the left as it did in a similar animal study. In the animal study unloading by a vasodilator did not induce a leftward shift, so it can be inferred that in the present study unloading combined with a decrease in the angiotensin concentration was instrumental in remodelling the heart. Though unloading was expected to have a beneficial effect on the oxygen supply/demand ratio of the heart, the patients still showed the same drop in the ejection fraction during exercise as they did before treatment with enalapril, and early diastolic filling did not improve. Normally, regression of cardiac dilatation is only found if pump function improves; the present study showed that unloading in combination with angiotensin converting enzyme inhibition reshapes the ventricle without improving intrinsic pump function. 
Ambulatory blood pressure monitoring in hypertension. Compared with blood pressure measurements in the office setting, ambulatory blood pressure monitoring offers a more accurate and reliable method of diagnosing and managing hypertension. Indications for ambulatory blood pressure monitoring include borderline hypertension, a discrepancy between home and office blood pressure measurements, persistent blood pressure elevation in the office with no end-organ damage, episodic elevations of blood pressure or suggestive symptoms, hypertension resistant to treatment, episodic angina not related to exercise, end-organ damage but normal office blood pressure readings, and evaluation of the efficacy of antihypertensive agents. Several cases are presented for review. 
Acute leukemia after a primary myelodysplastic syndrome: immunophenotypic, genotypic, and clinical characteristics. We studied the nature of blast cells in 41 patients with acute leukemia following a previous primary myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) by a combined multiparameter analysis including morphologic, immunophenotypic, and molecular genetic (Igs, T-cell receptor (TCR)-beta, -gamma, and -delta and the major breakpoint cluster region [M-bcr]) investigations. In addition, the clinical and hematologic characteristics according to the immunophenotype of blast cells were analyzed. Our results show that, although the granulocytic and/or monocytic lineages are those most commonly involved in these acute leukemias, other cell components, including the megakaryocytic and lymphoid, may be present (12% and 15% of the cases, respectively). Moreover, both morphologic and phenotypic studies show the frequent coexistence of two or three cell populations. Interestingly, in all cases the lymphoblastic component constantly displayed an early B phenotype (CD19+, CD10-, TdT+). Upon analyzing whether the type of MDS conditioned any differences in the immunophenotype of blast cells, we observed that, although the lymphoid lineage may be involved in all MDS subgroups, some differences emerge within the myeloid leukemic transformations. Thus, the refractory anemias with excess of blasts (RAEB) and RAEB in transformation displayed a significantly higher incidence of myeloblastic and megakaryoblastic transformations, while in the RA, RA with ring sideroblasts and chronic myelomonocytic leukemia, the granulo-monocytic phenotype predominated. In addition, our results show that the clinical and hematologic characteristics of these patients may be partially related to the immunophenotype of the blast cells. Ig heavy chain gene rearrangements were found in two of 19 patients analyzed (11%), one with a hybrid leukemia (lymphoid-myeloid) and the other with a granulo-monocytic phenotype. Two other hybrid transformations analyzed were in germline configuration. Gamma and delta gene rearrangements were found in 21% and 37% of these acute transformation, respectively. The TCR-beta and M-bcr were in germline configuration in all 19 cases studied. In summary, immunophenotype and molecular studies point to a pluripotent stem cell with preferential myeloid commitment as the target cell of leukemias following a primary MDS. 
Early photocoagulation for diabetic retinopathy. ETDRS report number 9. Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study Research Group. The Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study (ETDRS) enrolled 3711 patients with mild-to-severe nonproliferative or early proliferative diabetic retinopathy in both eyes. One eye of each patient was assigned randomly to early photocoagulation and the other to deferral of photocoagulation. Follow-up examinations were scheduled at least every 4 months and photocoagulation was initiated in eyes assigned to deferral as soon as high-risk proliferative retinopathy was detected. Eyes selected for early photocoagulation received one of four different combinations of scatter (panretinal) and focal treatment. This early treatment, compared with deferral of photocoagulation, was associated with a small reduction in the incidence of severe visual loss (visual acuity less than 5/200 at two consecutive visits), but 5-year rates were low in both the early treatment and deferral groups (2.6% and 3.7%, respectively). Adverse effects of scatter photocoagulation on visual acuity and visual field also were observed. These adverse effects were most evident in the months immediately following treatment and were less in eyes assigned to less extensive scatter photocoagulation. Provided careful follow-up can be maintained, scatter photocoagulation is not recommended for eyes with mild or moderate nonproliferative diabetic retinopathy. When retinopathy is more severe, scatter photocoagulation should be considered and usually should not be delayed if the eye has reached the high-risk proliferative stage. The ETDRS results demonstrate that, for eyes with macular edema, focal photocoagulation is effective in reducing the risk of moderate visual loss but that scatter photocoagulation is not. Focal treatment also increases the chance of visual improvement, decreases the frequency of persistent macular edema, and causes only minor visual field losses. Focal treatment should be considered for eyes with macular edema that involves or threatens the center of the macula. 
Anaerobic pathogenesis: collagenase production by Peptostreptococcus magnus and its relationship to site of infection. Fifty isolates of Peptostreptococcus magnus from intraabdominal sepsis, nonpuerperal breast abscess, and diabetic foot infections were examined for collagenase activity using bovine type I collagen. Collagenase production was detected in a higher percentage of strains from nonpuerperal breast and diabetic foot specimens (P less than .001). This enzyme may be responsible for P. magnus playing a more central role in the pathogenesis of nonpuerperal breast abscess and diabetic foot disease than in intraabdominal sepsis. 
Comparative effects of pacing-induced and balloon coronary occlusion ischemia on left ventricular diastolic function in man. BACKGROUND. Effects of pacing-induced and coronary occlusion myocardial ischemia on left ventricular (LV) function have been compared only in anesthetized dogs. Diastolic properties of the same LV anterior wall segment were therefore compared in 12 patients with single-vessel proximal left anterior descending coronary artery stenosis at rest, immediately after 7 +/- 1.2 minutes of pacing, and at the end of a 1-minute balloon occlusion of coronary angioplasty (CO). METHODS AND RESULTS. Shifts of the diastolic LV pressure-length relation, derived from simultaneous tip-micromanometer LV pressure recordings and digital subtraction LV angiograms, were used as an index of regional diastolic LV distensibility of the anterior wall segment. Immediately after pacing, LV end-diastolic pressure rose from 13.5 +/- 3.5 to 23.8 +/- 7.0 mm Hg (p less than 0.01 versus at rest) without a significant change of the LV end-diastolic volume index (83.1 +/- 18.9 versus 88.4 +/- 16.5 ml/m2), percentage systolic shortening (%SS) of the ischemic segment fell from 40.1 +/- 10.6% to 25.2 +/- 8.6% (p less than 0.01), and the diastolic LV pressure-radial length (P-RL) plot of the ischemic segment was shifted upward by 7.1 +/- 5.0 mm Hg for portions of the plot that overlapped with the diastolic LV P-RL plot at rest. At the end of CO, LV end-diastolic pressure rose to 20.8 +/- 7.8 mm Hg (p less than 0.01 versus at rest) and the LV end-diastolic volume index rose to 95.6 +/- 16.3 ml/m2 (p less than 0.05 versus at rest, p less than 0.05 versus after pacing). Ejection fraction and %SS of the ischemic segment fell respectively from 76.6 +/- 6.8% to 46.6 +/- 11.4% (p less than 0.01 versus at rest, p less than 0.01 versus after pacing) and from 40.1 +/- 10.6% to 6.4 +/- 8.6% (p less than 0.01 versus at rest, p less than 0.01 versus after pacing). The diastolic LV P-RL plot of the ischemic segment was shifted upward by 3.1 +/- 2.3 mm Hg for portions of the plot that overlapped with the diastolic LV P-RL plot at rest. This upward shift at the end of CO was significantly smaller (p less than 0.05) than that immediately after pacing. At the end of CO, a correlation (p less than 0.03) was observed for the ischemic segment between %SS and upward shift of the diastolic LV P-RL plot. CONCLUSIONS. The upward shift of the diastolic LV P-RL plot, which was used as an index of decreased regional diastolic LV distensibility, was larger immediately after pacing than at the end of CO. Persistent systolic shortening of ischemic myocardium seems to be a prerequisite for a decrease in diastolic distensibility of the ischemic segment because of the higher %SS of the ischemic segment immediately after pacing, and because of the correlation at the end of CO between the upward shift of the diastolic LV P-RL plot and %SS of the ischemic segment. 
A case of cardiac hydatid cyst localized on the interventricular septum and causing pulmonary emboli. Cardiac hydatid cyst is rarely encountered. In this article, a case of hydatid cyst localized in multiple organs including the ventricular septum and causing pulmonary emboli is reported. 
Lung function in former intravenous drug abusers: the effect of ubiquitous cigarette smoking. PURPOSE: To determine whether former intravenous drug abusers (IVDAs) demonstrate reductions in pulmonary function, especially in the diffusing capacity (DLCO), after adjustment for the effects of their ubiquitous smoking habit. Knowledge of baseline DLCO in this high-risk group is important in evaluating the effects of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and ensuing opportunistic infections. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Measurements of single-breath DLCO, forced vital capacity (FVC), and forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) were compared with predictive values that adjust for the effects of smoking. Patients were 98 ambulatory former IVDAs regularly attending a methadone maintenance program (62 men and 36 women; 94 current smokers, two ex-smokers, and two nonsmokers). RESULTS: When adjusted for smoking, FEV1 and DLCO were no different in the study sample than in cross sections of the general population: mean FEV1 105% predicted (men) and 97% predicted (women), mean DLCO 95% predicted (men) and 99% predicted (women). Eleven percent of the IVDAs had abnormal values for DLCO; only one subject had a value less than 50% of predicted. CONCLUSIONS: Most former IVDAs who regularly attend an ambulatory methadone program have normal DLCO values when the effects of smoking are taken into account. A decrease in DLCO in such subjects is presumptive evidence of superimposed disease, most likely related to opportunistic infections or HIV-associated malignancy or alveolitis. 
Noninvasive identification of myocardium at risk in patients with acute myocardial infarction and nondiagnostic electrocardiograms with technetium-99m-Sestamibi. BACKGROUND. Patients who have chest pain without electrocardiographic ST elevation are not candidates for thrombolytic therapy in most clinical trials. This study examined the value of technetium-99m-Sestamibi tomographic imaging to assess myocardial perfusion in patients during chest pain without ST elevation. METHODS AND RESULTS. Tc-99m-Sestamibi was injected in 14 patients who had chest pain without ST elevation, who subsequently developed enzymatic evidence of myocardial infarction within 24 hours. Tomographic imaging was performed 1-6 hours after injection. Thirteen of 14 patients showed significant perfusion defects indicative of acute myocardial infarction consistent with absent perfusion (20 +/- 15% of the left ventricle; range, 2-53%); one patient had normal images. Because of the absence of definitive electrocardiographic changes, only five patients received reperfusion therapy within 6 hours of the onset of chest pain. Regional wall motion abnormalities were present in nine of nine patients undergoing contrast ventriculography and correlated with the location of the Tc-99m-Sestamibi perfusion defect. At the time of subsequent coronary angiography, total arterial occlusion was present in 11 of the 14 patients. The infarct-related artery could be identified in 13 of the 14 patients. In six of these 13 patients, the left circumflex was the infarct-related artery. CONCLUSIONS. Patients who have chest pain without electrocardiographic ST elevation may have arterial occlusion and significant myocardium at risk. Tc-99m-Sestamibi imaging may be of benefit in identifying these patients early so that they can be considered for acute reperfusion therapy. 
Efficacy and safety of a short-term (6-h) intravenous infusion of dopexamine in patients with severe congestive heart failure: a randomized, double-blind, parallel, placebo-controlled multicenter study. Dopexamine hydrochloride is a new synthetic catechol that offers a unique profile of adrenergic and dopaminergic activity. In this multicenter, parallel design, placebo-controlled study, 45 patients with functional class III or IV chronic congestive heart failure were randomized to receive a placebo infusion or one of three different doses of dopexamine. After a 2-h dose titration sequence, patients received a 6-h constant dose infusion. During this 6-h period, dopexamine was infused at rates of 1, 2 and 4 micrograms/kg body weight per min in the low, intermediate and high dose groups, respectively. In patients receiving high dose infusion, dopexamine produced a 78% increase in cardiac index associated with a 43% decrease in systemic vascular resistance and 24% increase in heart rate (p less than 0.05 vs. placebo for all three variables). There was a trend (p = NS) toward a moderate increase in cardiac index at low and intermediate doses. In patients randomized to receive dopexamine, right atrial, systemic arterial, pulmonary artery and pulmonary capillary wedge pressures showed minimal change from baseline and did not differ statistically from the placebo response. Very few patients developed adverse reactions related to dopexamine, although five patients randomized to receive high dose and three patients randomized to receive intermediate dose dopexamine required dose reduction because hemodynamic variables exceeded arbitrary safety limits or the patients developed symptoms related to the study medication. dopexamine in higher doses effectively increases cardiac index in association with a reduction in systemic vascular resistance. Additional clinical studies are indicated to evaluate the merits of dopexamine in comparison with other inotropic and vasodilator medications. 
The treatment of mild hypertension study. A randomized, placebo-controlled trial of a nutritional-hygienic regimen along with various drug monotherapies. The Treatment of Mild Hypertension Research Group. There is no consensus for the optimal treatment program for individuals with mild hypertension, including whether treatment should emphasize life-style changes alone, such as weight loss, reduction of sodium and alcohol intake, and increased physical activity, or whether it should also include a pharmacologic component. The dilemma is accentuated by the availability of many drugs from different classes to lower blood pressure. To study the relative efficacy and safety of a combination of pharmacologic and nutritional-hygienic intervention compared with nutritional-hygienic intervention alone, a double-blind, controlled clinical trial was initiated. Nine hundred two men and women with mild hypertension (average blood pressure, 140/91 mm Hg) were randomized to receive nutritional-hygienic intervention plus one of six treatments: (1) placebo; (2) diuretic (chlorthalidone); (3) beta-blocker (acebutolol); (4) alpha 1-antagonist (doxazosin mesylate); (5) calcium antagonist (amlodipine maleate); or (6) angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (enalapril maleate). After 12 months, weight loss averaged 4.5 kg, urinary sodium excretion was reduced by 23%, and reported leisure-time physical activity was nearly doubled. Systolic and diastolic blood pressure in the group given nutritional-hygienic intervention alone (placebo) were reduced by 10.6 and 8.1 mm Hg, respectively. For participants in the five groups receiving antihypertensive medication in addition to nutritional-hygienic treatment, blood pressure reductions were significantly greater than those achieved with nutritional-hygienic treatment alone (range, 16 to 22 mm Hg for systolic and 12 to 14 mm Hg for diastolic blood pressure). Although differences among treatment groups in certain dimensions of quality of life, self-reported side effects, plasma lipid levels, and biochemical measures were observed, no consistent pattern in the differences was noted. Nutritional-hygienic therapy is an effective first-step treatment for persons with mild hypertension, and significant additional blood pressure lowering with minimal short-term side effects can be achieved by adding one of five different classes of antihypertensive agents. 
Effective aortic regurgitant orifice area: description of a method based on the conservation of mass. The natural history of aortic regurgitation is incompletely understood in part because of the lack of a simple method to estimate the defect size. A method of determining the effective regurgitant orifice area that combines Doppler catheter and Doppler echocardiographic techniques and is based on the principle of conservation of mass (the continuity equation) is described. To validate the application of the Doppler catheter system for measuring regurgitant supravalvular diastolic flow, an in vitro model of retrograde aortic flow was used. These studies indicated that measurements of supravalvular retrograde velocity with the Doppler catheter accurately reflect retrograde diastolic velocity when the aorta is less than 4.8 cm in diameter. Twenty-three patients undergoing cardiac catheterization were studied; 20 of these patients had aortic regurgitation. Retrograde supravalvular diastolic velocity was determined from a Doppler catheter positioned above the aortic valve. The effective regurgitant orifice area was calculated with use of the Doppler catheter-derived regurgitant volume and mean transvalvular diastolic velocity as determined by either catheterization or continuous wave Doppler echocardiography. The catheterization-derived regurgitant orifice area increased with the angiographic grade of as follows: 1+ (0.04 to 0.10 cm2), 2+ (0.15 to 0.49 cm2), 3+ (0.29 to 1.11 cm2) and 4+ (1.24 to 1.33 cm2). By combining Doppler catheter, echocardiographic and cardiac catheterization techniques, the effective aortic regurgitant orifice area may be estimated; this hydrodynamic area correlates with grading by supravalvular aortography. Calculation of this area provides a quantitative alternative to aortography for estimating the severity of aortic regurgitation but should be used with caution in patients with a markedly dilated aorta. 
Long-term inhibition of tumor growth by tumor necrosis factor in the absence of cachexia or T-cell immunity. The relationship between detrimental (cachectic) and beneficial (antitumor) effects of tumor necrosis factor (TNF) was studied in mice bearing murine tumors transfected to secrete human TNF. In vitro, the TNF-producing transfectants were resistant to the secreted TNF and grew at rates similar to those of untransfected cells or transfected cells that did not secrete TNF. However, tumors formed by the TNF-secreting cells in vivo remained much smaller than the nonsecreting (transfected and untransfected) tumors. This inhibition of tumor growth required only relatively low serum levels of TNF, persisted for many weeks, and was independent of T cells since it occurred in nude mice. Growth of the TNF-secreting tumors increased dramatically after treatment with anti-human TNF antibody, indicating that extracellular TNF secreted by the tumor cells was necessary for the tumor inhibition. Severe weight loss characteristic of cachexia only occurred in animals with very high serum TNF levels (250 pg/ml) and could be prevented or reversed by anti-TNF antibody treatment. These data are consistent with the existence of a therapeutic window in which persistent exposure to human TNF can lead to prolonged inhibition of tumor growth in the absence of T-cell immunity or severe weight loss and without development of resistant tumor variants. 
Acute pulmonary hypertensive crisis in a patient with primary pulmonary hypertension treated by both epoprostenol (prostacyclin) and nitroprusside. A 19-year-old girl was diagnosed as having primary pulmonary hypertension that was confirmed by right heart catheterization. Acute right heart failure was associated with syncope. Stabilization, while not achieved with intravenous epoprostenol (Prostacyclin) alone, was achieved with intravenous prostacyclin and nitroprusside. 
Intracranial metastases from malignant pleural mesothelioma. Report of three autopsy cases and review of the literature. We report three cases of brain metastases from malignant pleural mesothelioma that were seen at autopsy. We present a summarized review of 15 similar reports that were previously published. Our study included three aged male patients with a long occupational history of heavy asbestos exposure. In two patients, the metastases were discovered incidentally at autopsy, and there were no neurologic symptoms referred to before death. In the other patient, who had clinically occult mesothelioma, the intracranial tumor was discovered ante mortem: in this patient, the clinical features, as well as a computed tomographic scan, suggested a primary tumor of the brain. Interestingly, the histologic features of the latter case that were seen at autopsy depicted a spindle cell tumor that focally exhibited pseudopalisading, necrosis, vascular buds, which deceptively recalled a glioblastoma. All the three cases shared a basic sarcomatous pattern of malignant pleural mesothelioma in both primary and metastatic tumors. The immunohistochemical profile was consistent with such interpretation. It was concluded that metastases to the brain from malignant pleural mesothelioma, although rare, are not exceptional even if their clinical relevance is not prominent. They are seen concomitantly with high-grade tumors, and by mimicking a primary tumor on a clinical, instrumental, and histologic ground, they may occasionally represent a potential source of diagnostic pitfall. 
Bilateral retinal artery occlusion due to mitral valve prolapse. We report a case of bilateral retinal artery occlusion due to mitral valve prolapse. Most patients with retinal ischaemia in whom it is found have not been previously known to have it. Since it is a common condition it would seem essential that it be included in the differential diagnosis of amaurosis fugax and retinal artery occlusion if future ischaemic events are to be prevented. All patients with retinal ischaemia should have a full cardiovascular examination supplemented by echocardiography. 
Resectable gastric carcinoma. An evaluation of preoperative and postoperative chemotherapy. Patients with locoregional gastric carcinoma often die because of the low rates of curative resection and frequent appearance of distant metastases (mainly peritoneal and hepatic). To evaluate the feasibility of preoperative and postoperative chemotherapy, 25 consecutive previously untreated patients with potentially resectable locoregional gastric carcinoma received two preoperative and three postoperative courses of etoposide, 5-fluorouracil, and cisplatin (EFP). Ninety-eight courses (median, five courses; range, two to five courses) were administered. Six patients had major responses to EFP. Eighteen patients (72%) had curative resections, and three specimens (12%) contained only microscopic carcinoma. At a median follow-up of 25 months, the median survival of 25 patients was 15 months (range, 4 to 32+ months). Peritoneal carcinomatosis was the most common indication of failure. One patient died of postoperative complications, but there were no deaths due to chemotherapy. EFP-induced toxic reactions were moderate. Preoperative and postoperative chemotherapy for locoregional gastric carcinoma is feasible, and additional studies to develop regimens that could result in 5% to 10% complete pathologic responses may be warranted. 
Stunned left ventricular myocardium after exercise treadmill testing in coronary artery disease. Myocardial stunning (postischemic ventricular dysfunction) occurs in dogs after coronary stenosis following treadmill exercise. Less data are available in humans regarding development of stunned myocardium after exercise. Regional wall motion changes were evaluated in 22 patients with known coronary artery disease using 2-dimensional echocardiography and exercise treadmill testing. Wall motion was scored as 1 = normal, 2 = hypokinetic, 3 = akinetic, 4 = dyskinetic. At least 1 left ventricular segment with normal resting function developed an increase in wall motion score at 15 or 30 minutes compared with values at rest. The wall motion score in the midportion of the ventricular septum increased from 1.0 at rest to 1.6 (p less than 0.004) at 30 minutes after exercise; the basal inferior wall score worsened from 1.0 at rest to 1.9 (p less than 0.01) at 30 minutes after exercise. Coronary angiographic data in these patients revealed that left anterior descending narrowing correlated best with left ventricular septal wall motion abnormalities, whereas right coronary artery and circumflex narrowing best correlated with inferior and posterior wall motion abnormalities. Eight normal adult volunteers with no history of myocardial ischemia also underwent 2-dimensional echocardiography and exercise testing. No wall motion abnormalities were observed at any time after exercise. The present study suggests that in patients with coronary artery disease, exercise treadmill testing may induce regional wall motion abnormalities of the left ventricle that persist greater than or equal to 30 minutes after exercise, an observation consistent with the phenomenon of stunned myocardium. 
Hepatobiliary complications of polyarteritis nodosa. Although polyarteritis nodosa (PAN) may result in thrombosis or aneurysm formation in any organ in the body, hepatobiliary complications are unusual. We reviewed seven cases that demonstrated the diagnostic difficulties and therapeutic options available in the management of hepatobiliary PAN. No consistent sign that indicated the severity of hepatobiliary PAN could be identified. In cases of thrombotic PAN, acalculus cholecystitis usually could be diagnosed preoperatively. Early tissue diagnosis and aggressive intervention are required for appropriate patient treatment. If the diagnosis is unclear, a preoperative muscle or skin biopsy specimen is often helpful in establishing a tissue diagnosis of PAN, even if no obvious pathologic condition is evident. Patients who undergo celiotomy for acalculus cholecystitis or peritoneal signs of an unclear origin should have tissue specimens (gallbladder wall, liver, or omentum) submitted for pathologic study. Angiography may be diagnostic preoperatively or when results of biopsies are equivocal. In addition, early angiography can define the extent of visceral involvement and permit control by embolization of hemorrhage secondary to aneurysm rupture. Awareness of the possibilities of thrombotic, ischemic, or bleeding complications from PAN allows more aggressive and rapid management of abdominal complaints, especially in patients who are receiving immunosuppressant therapy. 
Problems and coping strategies of individuals with traumatic brain injury and their spouses. A pilot investigation is reported on the problems and coping strategies of 20 married men and 11 married women with traumatic brain injury (TBI) and their able-bodied spouses. All injured subjects experienced severe head injury at least one and a half years earlier. A structured, small-group discussion process was used to elicit a prioritized list of problems and a similar list of coping strategies. Individuals with TBI and their spouses identified problems in living as most important; loss of employment and restrictions on autonomy were reported as the most problematic. Men with TBI placed priority on controlling their anger, whereas, women with TBI were concerned with their mood disorders, particularly depression. Women with TBI and able-bodied wives of men with TBI placed high priority on the use of support groups as a coping strategy. Men placed higher priority on individualistic approaches to adjustment, such as suppression of feelings. A number of testable hypotheses resulted from the pilot study. 
Production of endothelium-derived contracting factor is enhanced after coronary reperfusion. To determine whether coronary reperfusion enhances the production of endothelium-derived contracting factor, we investigated dogs subjected to global cardiac ischemia (45 minutes) followed by reperfusion (60 minutes). Segments of reperfused and control coronary arteries were suspended in organ chambers to measure isometric force. Perfusate hypoxia caused endothelium-dependent contraction in the control and reperfused arteries. However, reperfused arteries exhibited hypoxic contraction that was significantly greater than control segments. The hypoxic contractions in both the control and reperfused arteries could be inhibited by NG-monomethyl-L-arginine (L-NMMA), the blocker of endothelial cell synthesis of nitric oxide from L-arginine. The action of L-NMMA could be reversed by L-arginine but not D-arginine. Thus, after reperfusion, augmented production of endothelium-derived contracting factor occurs by an L-arginine-dependent pathway. We hypothesize that nitric oxide produced by L-arginine metabolism combines with superoxide anion to produce the peroxynitrite anion (ONOO-), which is metabolized to endothelium-derived contracting factor or induces its synthesis. Augmented production of endothelium-derived contracting factor would favor vasospasm after reperfusion. 
Risk factors for stroke in patients with nonrheumatic atrial fibrillation: a case-control study. PURPOSE: Randomized controlled trials have demonstrated that anticoagulant therapy is very effective at preventing stroke among patients with nonrheumatic atrial fibrillation. However, these trials have reported too few strokes for powerful risk factor analysis. Observational studies may provide additional information. The purpose of this study was to identify risk factors in a larger number of patients with stroke and nonrheumatic atrial fibrillation, using case-control methodology. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We identified all patients discharged from one hospital over an 8-year period who met our case definition of nonrheumatic atrial fibrillation and ischemic stroke (n = 134), and compared them with contemporaneous control subjects who were discharged with nonrheumatic atrial fibrillation without stroke (n = 131). RESULTS: Cases and controls were similar in terms of duration of atrial fibrillation; proportion with paroxysmal atrial fibrillation; percentage with a past medical history of angina, myocardial infarction, congestive heart failure, diabetes, or smoking; and mean left atrial size. In contrast, cases were significantly older than controls (78.5 versus 74.8 years, p = 0.002) and more likely to have a history of hypertension (55% versus 38%, p = 0.0093). The relative odds for stroke was 1.91 for patients with hypertension, 1.73 for patients older than 75 years, and 3.26 for patients with both factors. CONCLUSIONS: Our analysis suggests that age and hypertension should be considered when deciding upon long-term anticoagulant therapy to prevent stroke in patients with nonrheumatic atrial fibrillation. 
Natural history of dilated cardiomyopathy in children. To assess the natural history and potential risk factors in childhood dilated cardiomyopathy, we investigated 25 patients (ages 9.6 +/- 4.4 years) who presented after they were 2 years old. All patients had symptoms of congestive heart failure and reduced contractility with a dilated left ventricle at presentation. Two factors at presentation were significantly different between patients who died less than 1 year after the presentation (n = 14) and those who survived for more than 1 year (n = 9); cardiothoracic ratio (65.1% +/- 6.8% vs 57.1% +/- 6.1%, p less than 0.01) and left ventricular ejection fraction (31.3% +/- 7.0% vs 40.0% +/- 6.2%, p less than 0.05). Irrespective of intensive medical therapy, dilated cardiomyopathy in children had a poor prognosis; the actuarial survival rate was 41% at 1 year and 20% at 3 years. Other forms of therapy should be considered in the early stages of dilated cardiomyopathy in this high-risk group. 
Immunophenotyping of lymphocytes in liver tissue of patients with chronic liver diseases by flow cytometry. Immunological factors are important in the pathogenesis of a spectrum of hepatobiliary diseases. To characterize the nature of specific immunological responses in liver disease, we determined lymphocyte changes in liver tissue and in blood using flow cytometry. A total of 113 liver biopsy specimens was collected from patients with the following diseases: 19 chronic hepatitis B; 39 chronic non-A, non-B hepatitis; 27 alcoholic liver disease; 10 hepatic malignancy; 8 autoimmune hepatitis; 6 fatty liver and 4 primary biliary cirrhosis. The lymphocytes were isolated from the liver biopsy specimens by mechanical and enzymatic methods. The lymphocyte yield was 7,901 +/- 575 cells/mg of liver tissue. The viability of lymphocytes was 97.7% +/- 0.3%. Lymphocytes were stained with four pairs of two-color mixed fluorescein-conjugated monoclonal antibodies, including T4-T8 (CD4/CD8), T11-B1 (CD2-CD20), NKH1-T8 (CD56-CD8), IL-2R1-T11 (CD25-CD2), and the ratios were determined by an Epics Profile flow cytometer. Immunophenotyping of lymphocytes in whole blood samples was simultaneously analyzed. Variability in lymphocyte yield and different patterns of lymphocyte subsets were found in the liver biopsy specimens. The yields of lymphocytes from patients with chronic non-A, non-B and autoimmune hepatitis were highest, and the lowest yield was from patients with fatty liver. Patients with primary biliary cirrhosis, fatty liver and hepatic malignancy had relatively high ratios of CD4/CD8, CD56/CD8 and CD25/CD2; whereas patients with chronic hepatitis B, autoimmune hepatitis and non-A, non-B hepatitis had lower ratios of CD4/CD8, CD56/CD8 and CD25/CD2. No difference in lymphocyte ratios between the patients with cirrhotic and noncirrhotic alcoholic liver disease was found. 
An evaluation of immunohistologic stains for immunoglobulin light chains in bone marrow biopsies in benign and malignant plasma cell proliferations. Bone marrow specimens from 226 patients with a variety of benign and malignant plasma cell proliferations were studied to assess the reliability of immunohistologic studies in their evaluation. The clonality of the bone marrow plasma cells was compared with results of serum and urine electrophoreses. Discordance was observed most frequently in cases in which a paraprotein was demonstrated, but no monoclonality was detected by immunoperoxidase (16 cases). Of these 16 cases, 9 had 5% or less bone marrow plasma cells. In only one case was the light chain class of the bone marrow plasma cells different from that of the paraprotein. If discordant cases with 5% or less plasma cells are eliminated, the overall concordance was 97%. The authors' findings indicate that immunohistologic studies for immunoglobulin light chains in Zenker-fixed decalcified bone marrow biopsy sections are reliable in the evaluation of patients with plasma cell proliferations when the marrow contains more than 5% plasma cells. 
Coronary recanalization rate after intravenous bolus of alteplase in acute myocardial infarction. The demonstration in animals that recombinant tissue-type plasminogen activator produces prolonged thrombolysis after its clearance from the circulation has prompted a few pilot studies of bolus administration in patients. Alteplase (bolus dose of 70 mg) resulted in the highest recanalization rate in our previous pilot study comparing bolus doses of 50, 60 and 70 mg of alteplase in patients with acute myocardial infarction. The aim of the present trial was to assess the efficacy and safety of the same bolus dose in a larger number of patients. A further objective was to study the angiographic reocclusion rate at 12 to 24 hours in patients who had a recanalized infarct-related coronary artery at 90 minutes and were randomized at that time to a bolus dose or an infusion for 3 hours of 30 mg of alteplase. Sixty patients with acute myocardial infarction and angiographically documented total occlusion of the infarct-related coronary artery before thrombolysis were treated within 5 hours of onset of symptoms with an intravenous 70-mg bolus dose of alteplase (or 80 mg if body weight was greater than or equal to 90 kg). Each patient received 5,000 IU of heparin intraarterially and 100 mg of aspirin by mouth before administration of alteplase. Coronary angiography was repeated 60 and 90 minutes after alteplase administration. The recanalization rate of the infarct-related coronary artery was 55% (95% confidence interval, 43 to 66%) at 60 minutes and 48% (95% confidence interval, 37 to 60%) at 90 minutes. Pretreatment levels of lipoprotein (a) were not significantly related to recanalization. 
Symptomatic intrasellar arachnoid cyst: case report. A case of a large symptomatic intrasellar arachnoid cyst with suprasellar extension is reported. A 53-year-old man was admitted because of decreased visual acuity. Magnetic resonance imaging showed a large intrasellar cyst extending into the suprasellar cistern, with compression of optic nerves. The intensity of the cyst was identical to that of the surrounding subarachnoid space on both T1-, T2-, and proton density-weighted images. Transsphenoidal surgery was performed, but subsequent refilling of the cyst required additional transcranial surgery. Analysis of the cerebrospinal fluid-like cystic fluid revealed high levels of protein and pituitary hormones. Histological study revealed that the cyst wall was composed of connective tissue and arachnoid cells, which were ultrastructurally characterized by a number of desmosomes. Diagnostic, surgical, and pathological features of intrasellar arachnoid cysts are discussed. 
Evidence of malignant features in histologically mature teratoma. A total of 33 specimens from 29 patients with residual stable teratoma and mature growing teratoma after chemotherapy was analyzed for clinicopathological and deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) flow cytometric variables, as well as the presence of proliferative antigen and tumor marker levels in an attempt to explain their clinical behavior. We compared the flow cytometric and histological data of these stable and growing teratomas, and of nonseminomatous germ cell tumors before chemotherapy. The DNA content of residual teratoma did not differ significantly from that of the primary testicular tumors (1.38 versus 1.48). Histological analysis of stable and growing teratomas revealed no significant difference but proliferative cellular nuclear antigen was expressed mainly in the epithelial component of the growing teratoma. alpha-Fetoprotein, beta-human chorionic gonadotropin and carcinoembryonic antigen were elevated in the fluid of 6 excised teratomas, while concomitant serum levels were normal. The aneuploidy and elevated cystic fluid tumor markers confirm the malignant phenotype of post-chemotherapy residual teratomas. Therefore, complete surgical removal is essential despite the benign histological appearance. 
HIV-2 infection among prostitutes working in The Gambia: association with serological evidence of genital ulcer diseases and with generalized lymphadenopathy. Three hundred and fifty-five prostitutes working in The Gambia were enrolled in a study of retroviral infections. Eight-seven (24.6%) were infected with HIV-2 only, two (0.6%) with HIV-1 only, four (1.1%) had sera showing double HIV-1/HIV-2 reactivity, and 37 (10.4%) were seropositive for HTLV-I. After allowing for socioeconomic and serological variables in a multivariate analysis, HIV-2 infection was associated with serological evidence of a previous episode of syphilis [a rapid plasma reagin (RPR) positive/Treponema pallidum haemagglutination assay (TPHA) positive; odds ratio (OR) = 2.18, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.19-3.98], with having antibodies against Haemophilus ducreyi (OR = 2.05, 95% CI = 0.89-4.70) or against HTLV-I (OR = 2.17, 95% CI = 0.91-5.19). HIV-2-seropositive prostitutes were three times more likely [17 out of 78 (22%) versus 15 out of 219 (7%), P less than 0.001] to have generalized lymphadenopathy than those who were seronegative. These data suggest that genital ulcer diseases may facilitate the transmission of HIV-2, and that HIV-2 rapidly induces the appearance of generalized lymphadenopathy in a substantial proportion of infected individuals. 
Aortic dissection type A surgery: Doppler sonography to evaluate correct carotid artery perfusion during cardiopulmonary bypass. In the surgery of acute aortic type A dissection we have employed preoperative and intraoperative Doppler sonography, to check safe and correct perfusion of the carotid arteries by the cardiopulmonary bypass before instituting cardiac arrest. Ten patients, operated upon for acute aortic type A dissection, were evaluated by means of Doppler sonography and in two patients a very abnormal flow pattern was found in the carotid arteries at the moment of aortic cross-clamping; immediate unclamping allowed temporary antegrade carotid perfusion, while the perfusion technique was readjusted. We report our experience with preoperative and intraoperative Doppler sonography, which appears to be a valuable new method of improving the surgical management of acute aortic type A dissection. 
Diagnosis and monitoring of subarachnoid hemorrhage by transcranial color-coded real-time sonography. Thirty-six patients with acute spontaneous subarachnoid hemorrhage (26 caused by rupture of an aneurysm) were examined by transcranial color-coded real-time sonography by using a 2.25-MHz ultrasound transducer. In 20 of these 26 patients (76%), the aneurysm could be identified by a characteristic abnormal blood flow pattern within the aneurysm in coronal and axial scanning planes by transcranial color-coded real-time sonography. Blood within the basal cisterns, on top of the tentorium, and within the ventricles and parenchyma was sonographically detected by increased echodensity in 75%. In addition, cerebrospinal fluid circulation disturbances and cerebral vasospasm were detected in two-dimensional B-mode images in 85% and 100%, respectively. In Doppler mode, intravascular blood flow velocity could be quantified. We conclude that transcranial color-coded real-time sonography, a new, noninvasive method for diagnosis and follow-up of patients with subarachnoid hemorrhage, allows detection of the primary vascular lesion and monitoring of complications. 
Hypotensive anesthesia for scoliosis surgery in Jehovah's Witnesses. Hypotensive anesthesia has been advocated in spinal surgery for the purpose of diminishing operative blood loss. This study evaluated its effectiveness in 12 Jehovah's Witnesses undergoing Harrington instrumentation and fusion who refused transfusion. Previous series from this institute did not use deliberate hypotension because of routinely low blood loss. Compared with matched controls operated on under normotensive anesthesia, the Jehovah's Witness patients had lower absolute blood loss but also shorter operative time. Applied linear-regression analysis demonstrated that the diminished blood loss was associated with shorter operative time (P = 0.0002) rather than lower blood pressure. The majority of blood losses in spinal instrumentation with fusion occurs with decortication. This rapid bleeding occurs at venous pressures which are unaffected by arterial blood pressure manipulation. The authors conclude that spinal surgery is possible in Jehovah's Witnesses without transfusion and that operative technique is the single most important determinant of blood loss. 
Binding and internalization of transforming growth factor-beta 1 by human hepatoma cells: evidence for receptor recycling. Cellular processing of 125I-labeled transforming growth factor-beta 1 was investigated in the human hepatoma cell lines Hep G2 and Hep 3B. Binding of 125I-transforming growth factor-beta 1 to cell surface receptors was specific, saturable and calcium-independent. Both cell lines exhibited a single class of high-affinity (Kd = 2.2 x 10(-10) mol/L) binding sites (4.5 x 10(3) for the Hep G2 cell; 1.5 x 10(3) for the Hep 3B cell) for both human and porcine transforming growth factor-beta 1. Binding was temperature dependent, time dependent and pH dependent. Cell-bound 125I-transforming growth factor-beta 1 was removed by brief exposure to acidic medium (pH less than 4) but was converted into an acid-resistant state rapidly after shifting the cells to 37 degrees C. Spontaneous dissociation of bound ligand over a 6 hr period at 4 degrees C was less than 10%. Disuccinimidyl suberate was used to covalently label 125I-transforming growth factor-beta 1 to cell-surface binding sites. Labeling of the ligand/receptor complexes was inhibited by unlabeled transforming growth factor-beta 1 but was unaffected by other growth factors. The radiolabeled complexes showed approximate molecular weights of 280,000, 85,000 and 65,000 when run on reducing sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Cell-bound 125I-transforming growth factor-beta 1 was internalized and degraded at 37 degrees C, and the products were released into the medium as trichloroacetic acid-nonprecipitable radioactivity. The lysosomotropic base chloroquine and the carboxylic ionphore monensin inhibited degradation and release of 125I-labeled products from the cells. 
A prospective, controlled analysis of endoscopic cytotechniques for diagnosis of malignant biliary strictures. We prospectively collected brushings and bile for cytology in 30 consecutive patients with bile duct strictures (17 malignant, 13 benign) who were assessed by endoscopic retrograde cholangiography. When appropriate, the cellular debris on stents that were removed from individuals who were managed with these devices was evaluated for malignant cells as well. Our aim was to assess the value of these endoscopic cytotechniques for making a diagnosis of obstructing cancer of the biliary tract. A cumulative total of 78 specimens were obtained. Overall, sensitivity was highest for stent (36%) and brush (33%) cytology, compared with results obtained from bile (6%). If the results for all methods are combined, 47% of patients with cancer (eight of 17) could be diagnosed by one or more cytological technique. There were no false-positive results (specificity, 100%). Our results show that brush and stent cytology are nearly equivalent for detecting cancer, but because a diagnosis is delayed until the endoprosthesis is removed (mean 3.4 months), the brush technique is preferred. Results for bile cytology are marginal. Specificity for these cytotechniques is high; therefore, a positive result by any method is sufficient evidence for cancer, and other invasive diagnostic procedures are unnecessary. 
Coordinate regulation of HOX genes in human hematopoietic cells. Hematopoiesis is a continuous process in which precursor cells proliferate and differentiate throughout life. However, the molecular mechanisms that govern this process are not clearly defined. Homeobox-containing genes, encoding DNA-binding homeodomains, are a network of genes highly conserved throughout evolution. They are organized in clusters expressed in the developing embryo with a positional hierarchy. We have analyzed expression of the four human HOX loci in erythroleukemic, promyelocytic, and monocytic cell lines to investigate whether the physical organization of human HOX genes reflects a regulatory hierarchy involved in the differentiation process of hematopoietic cells. Our results demonstrate that cells representing various stages of hematopoietic differentiation display differential patterns of HOX gene expression and that HOX genes are coordinately switched on or off in blocks that may include entire loci. The entire HOX4 locus is silent in all lines analyzed and almost all the HOX2 genes are active in erythroleukemic cells and turned off in myeloid-restricted cells. Our observations provide information about the regulation of HOX genes and suggest that the coordinate regulation of these genes may play an important role in lineage determination during early steps of hematopoiesis. 
Epilepsy surgery in the posterior cortex. Fourteen (74%) of 19 patients obtained a significant reduction in seizures after posterior corticectomy; 6 (32%) were seizure-free over a median follow-up of 3.7 years (range, 1 to 14 years). Surgery included limited resections of the occipital lobe in 16 patients, posterior temporal region in 11, and posterior portion of parietal lobe in 7. Surgical failure related to probable multiple areas of epileptogenesis (4 patients), or limited resections (2 patients) to preserve visual fields (2 patients) and to avoid dyslexia (1 patient). Of 14 patients without a complete hemianopia preoperatively, 6 (43%) developed a new or increased visual field deficit, 2 (14%) of which were hemianopia. Four (36%) of 11 occipital lobe resections resulted in a new or increased visual field deficit: quadrantanopia in 3 and hemianopia in 1. Visual phenomena were the most common initial ictal symptoms, occurring in 13 (68%) of the 19 patients. Twelve patients had complex partial seizures: in 2, always without warning; in 7, always following an aura, usually visual; and in 3 patients, with or without warning. Scalp electroencephalography identified the origin of most recorded seizures in 12 (63%) of the 19 patients. A principal interictal spike focus appeared in 15 patients (79%), and always correlated with the epileptogenic lobe as defined by scalp and/or subdural-recorded seizures (14 patients) or by clinical analysis and computed tomography (1 patient). 
Arterial hemorrhage after pancreatoduodenectomy. The 'sentinel bleed'. Experienced centers report reduced operative mortality after pancreatoduodenectomy for cancer, but significant complications continue to occur in as many as 25% of patients. Anastomotic disruption leads to sepsis in the pancreatic bed where major vascular structures have been exposed by regional lymphadenectomy, creating a setting for arterial erosion or ligature slough and massive hemorrhage. Dehiscence of the pancreatojejunostomy is a particular risk. We treated five patients with arterial hemorrhage after pancreatoduodenectomy, all of whom had had "sentinel" bleeding from the abdominal drains or gastrointestinal tract. Results of endoscopy were misleading in two patients. Three of five patients were saved by prompt recognition, early operation, and, in one instance, angiographic embolization. Sentinel bleeding after pancreatoduodenectomy indicates local sepsis and probable anastomotic dehiscence. Recognition of its significance and prompt response may prevent exsanguination. 
Venous haemangioma of the neck and mediastinum. A case of cervico-mediastinal venous haemangioma with diffuse upper respiratory airway involvement is reported. The lesion was considered to be an ordinary supraglottic haemangioma at first. We recommend that adult cases of laryngeal haemangioma should be carefully examined for extra-laryngeal lesions. 
Evidence for superoxide radical-dependent coronary vasospasm after angioplasty in intact dogs. BACKGROUND. Active oxygen species can influence vascular tone and platelet activation through a variety of mechanisms. This study assessed the role of the superoxide anion, the hydroxyl radical, and hydrogen peroxide in vasoconstriction and mural thrombosis after coronary artery angioplasty in intact dogs. METHODS AND RESULTS. Injury was induced by inflation of a balloon catheter 50 +/- 6% above baseline arterial diameter; dogs were followed for 2 hours before death. Epicardial coronary diameters at arteriography and extent of thrombus deposition at serial histological sections were analyzed in controls (n = 20) and in dogs pretreated with superoxide dismutase (SOD, a superoxide radical scavenger, n = 10); other dogs were pretreated with the hydrogen peroxide scavenger catalase (n = 8), the iron chelator deferoxamine (n = 6), or the hydroxyl radical scavenger 1,3-dimethyl-2-thiourea (n = 9). Angioplasty-induced injury was similar among groups. After angioplasty, control dogs exhibited localized and persistent vessel constriction, which was maximal at the initial 5 minutes (28.9 +/- 6.3% diameter decrease versus baseline). Corresponding arterial diameters of SOD-treated dogs were 24-69% larger (95% confidence interval, p less than 0.001) than controls at 5 minutes and, on average, 32% larger than controls thereafter (p less than 0.01). Vasoconstriction was not prevented by the other treatments. The SOD dose used accounted for inhibition of zymosan-stimulated blood cytochrome c reduction versus baseline (7 +/- 3 versus 30 +/- 6 nmol/min/10(6) cells, respectively, p = 0.003); such inhibition occurred in no other group. Prevalence of mural thrombosis was similar among all groups, but large thrombi (greater than 15% of lumen area) were absent in SOD-treated dogs, contrary to control group (p = 0.028); other groups were similar to control. In the absence of injury, SOD alone induced no change in coronary diameter, coronary blood flow, or platelet aggregation. CONCLUSIONS. These data provide evidence implicating the superoxide radical in the genesis of vasoconstriction after coronary angioplasty in vivo. Such effects seem to be independent of its conversion to hydroxyl radicals and availability of hydrogen peroxide or catalytic iron complexes. 
Valproate in the treatment of persistent chronic daily headache. An open label study. Thirty patients with persistent chronic daily headache, unresponsive to various combinations of pharmacological and nonpharmacological treatment were selected for an open label study using divalproex sodium. All patients had normal liver function tests. After a baseline observation period of 1 month, patients were given divalproex sodium 1000 to 2000 mg per day, for a period of 3 months. Blood valproic acid levels were kept between 75 and 100 mcg/ml. Liver function studies and blood ammonia levels were obtained periodically. Based on weekly headache index, headache-free days, dysfunctional days and patients' general well-being rating and physicians' global assessment, two thirds of the patients improved significantly. The common side effects included weight gain, tremor, hair loss and nausea. Liver functions were unaffected by treatment. The possible mechanism of action of valproate in headache is discussed. Valproate appears to be a worthwhile addition to the prophylactic treatment of chronic recurrent headache. 
Sequential administration of recombinant human interleukin-2 and dacarbazine in metastatic melanoma: a multicenter phase II study. Twenty-five assessable patients with metastatic melanoma have been entered in a multicenter phase II study of two induction cycles of human recombinant interleukin-2(IL2), 18 x 10(6) IU/m2/d continuous intravenous (IV) infusion on days 1 to 5 and days 12 to 17. Dacarbazine (DTIC), 850 mg/m2 IV bolus was given on day 26. The cycle was repeated at 5 weeks. Maintenance therapy was scheduled 3 weeks after the completion of induction treatment, consisting of IL2, 18 x 10(6) IU/m2/d for 5 days alternating with DTIC, 850 mg/m2 IV every 3 weeks, for a total of 18 weeks. Six patients responded (24%); two complete and four partial. Stable disease was seen in five patients. None of the six patients with more than two sites of metastases responded. Maximum response was observed in the first 3 months of treatment. Progression-free periods of 6 months and longer were seen in the two complete responders (8 and 17+ months), in two of the four partial responders (7 and 12+ months), and in three of the five patients with stable disease (9+, 15, and 17+ months). Toxicity included fever, skin rash, fatigue, anorexia, and diarrhea in most patients. Two patients had a weight gain of more than 10%. Eight patients needed intensive care for the observation and treatment of a myocardial injury (one patient), ventricular tachycardia (one), hypotension and oliguria (four), and sepsis (two). Sequential treatment with IL2 and DTIC appears to be effective but not clearly better than could be expected of IL2 alone. 
Total parenteral nutrition-induced steatosis: reversal by parenteral lipid infusion. Prolonged use of total parenteral nutrition (TPN) may be associated with hepatic complications, primarily steatosis and cholestasis. A case is reported of an 18-year-old woman with chronic idiopathic intestinal pseudo-obstruction syndrome who was on prolonged home parenteral nutrition without lipid supplementation and developed steatosis. This finding was reversed by addition of lipid emulsion, at a dose of 0.5 g/kg/day, to the parenteral nutrition solution. The lack of lipid supplementation as a possible cause of steatosis, as well as other mechanisms of liver steatosis associated with TPN, are discussed. 
Case-control study of leukaemia and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma in children in Caithness near the Dounreay nuclear installation [published erratum appears in BMJ 1991 Apr 6;302(6780):818] OBJECTIVE--To examine whether the observed excess of childhood leukaemia and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma in the area around the Dounreay nuclear installation is associated with established risk factors, or with factors related to the plant, or with parental occupation in the nuclear industry. DESIGN--Case-control study. SETTING--Caithness local government district. SUBJECTS--14 cases of leukaemia and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma occurring in children aged under 15 years diagnosed in the area between 1970 and 1986 and 55 controls matched for sex, date of birth, and area of residence within Caithness at time of birth. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES--Antenatal abdominal x ray examination; drugs taken and viral infections during pregnancy; father's occupation; father's employment at Dounreay and radiation dose; distance of usual residence from the path of microwave beams, preconceptional exposure to non-ionising radiation in the father; and other lifestyle factors. RESULTS--No raised relative risks were found for prenatal exposure to x rays, social class of parents, employment at Dounreay before conception or diagnosis, father's dose of ionising radiation before conception, or child's residence within 50 m of the path of microwave transmission beams. Results also proved negative for all lifestyle factors except an apparent association with use of beaches within 25 km of Dounreay. However, this result was based on small numbers, arose in the context of multiple hypothesis testing, and is certainly vulnerable to possible systematic bias. CONCLUSION--The raised incidence of childhood leukaemia and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma around Dounreay cannot be explained by paternal occupation at Dounreay or by paternal exposure to external ionising radiation before conception. The observation of an apparent association between the use of beaches around Dounreay and the development of childhood leukaemia and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma might be an artefact of multiple testing and influenced by recall bias. 
Use of i.v. radionuclide total body arteriography to evaluate arterial bypass shunts--a new method--a review of several cases. Currently, Doppler ultrasound and contrast angiography are the main imaging procedures being used to evaluate arterial bypass shunts. IV radionuclide total body arteriography (TBA) is another useful imaging procedure for evaluation of bypass shunts. The authors reviewed 33 patients, 19 women and 14 men, ranging in age from forty-three to eighty-five, who had TBA done after arterial bypass surgery. Ten patients had multiple shunts and 5 had multiple follow-up studies. In total there were 80 shunts, including 43 femoropopliteal, 16 axillofemoral, 1 axillopopliteal, 13 crossover femorofemoral, and 7 aortofemoral shunts. Sixty-two of the 80 shunts were patent, 14 were occluded, and 4 had partial occlusion. The results were confirmed by Doppler studies, contrast angiograms, and/or surgical exploration without false positives or false negatives. Since the radiotracer used was 99mTc-labeled red blood cells, a MUGA study can also be performed immediately following TBA in the same injection. Twenty-eight patients had gated cardiac blood pool studies (MUGA) done; 16 had abnormal wall motion and diminished ventricular function. TBA requires only a single IV injection of radiotracer (less than 1 cc) in the upper limb. The imaging times for total body arterial and perfusion images are seventy seconds and five minutes respectively. Both total body arterial and perfusion images clearly demonstrated the entire course of shunts (single or multiple); underlying and coexisting arterial abnormalities, e g, occlusive disease (27 patients), or aneurysm (3 patients); and related perfusion changes in the extremities. TBA has unique features. It permits a complete, excellent visualization of the bypass graft without the hazard of contrast media injection. It is a simple and a virtually noninvasive procedure, particularly useful for preoperative workups and postoperative follow-ups. 
Temporarily implanted urethral coil stent for the treatment of recurrent urethral strictures: a preliminary report. A new urethral stent developed for use in recurrent urethral strictures is presented. This metallic coil is self-expanding when released from its introducing catheter. The stent was used in 18 patients with recurrent strictures necessitating frequent dilation or urethrotomy. The stent is introduced under fluoroscopic guidance after internal urethrotomy or simple dilation. Strictures of 5 to 60 mm. were treated successfully with this device. All strictures were distal to the external sphincter. No serious complications attributed to the device were recorded. When necessary, the stent could be repositioned either under fluoroscopic control or endoscopically. This device can hold the stenotic area of the urethra open for long intervals allowing for complete healing. Even after 6 months the stent is not covered with urethral epithelium and does not become incorporated into the urethral wall. It can be removed easily without an operation by simple manipulation. The large internal caliber permits passage of endoscopes up to 17F in patients who require cystoscopy. The device can be removed before transurethral resections and then a new stent can be inserted at the end of the procedure. Mean followup of our patients with the stent indwelling was 8 months (range 4 to 11 months). Followup after removal of the stent (6 patients) was 3 to 8 months (mean 5 months). The patients voided well during followup and were fully continent. No incrustations were noted in the removed stents even after 6 months and no stent became obstructed due to tissue proliferation or incrustation. In 1 patient the stricture recurred after 3 months and a new stent was inserted. Urine sterilization was obtained in 7 patients with infected urine after relatively short courses of antibiotics. This stent seems to be a promising tool for the nonoperative treatment of recurrent urethral strictures. 
Mother and child. Trauma in pregnancy. The role of the emergency physician in optimizing outcome for the maternal and fetal victims of trauma is pivotal. Knowledge of the anatomic and physiologic changes of pregnancy aid in understanding the nuances of care of the pregnant trauma patient. Both catastrophic and noncatastrophic trauma can be managed with confidence and expertise by recalling the maternal and fetal pathophysiologic responses to trauma. Burns and electrical injuries carry significant fetal risks, which may be minimized by rapid and knowledgeable emergency care. 
Cilioretinal artery occlusion in young adults with central retinal vein occlusion. Ten patients, all younger than 50 years of age, had a temporal cilioretinal artery occlusion associated with a nonischemic central retinal vein occlusion. On fluorescein angiography, the cilioretinal artery eventually filled in all but one eye. The cilioretinal artery showed pulsations on fluorescein angiography in five eyes. The central retinal vein occlusion eventually resolved and the fundus assumed a normal appearance in all nine of the followed cases. Eight of nine eyes that underwent follow-up examination had final visual acuity of 20/30 or better. The occlusion of the central retinal vein produces an elevation of intraluminal capillary pressure because the central retinal artery continues to pump blood into the retina. Because the perfusion pressure of the cilioretinal artery is lower than the central retinal artery, it becomes relatively occluded. The prognosis for these patients is generally good unless the entire parafoveal capillary net is affected by the cilioretinal artery that is occluded. 
Perilymphatic fistula: analysis of free amino acids in middle ear microaspirates. High-performance liquid chromatography was used to determine 19 free amino acid concentrations in perilymph, serum/plasma, and red blood cell intracellular fluid. Significant differences were found between perilymph and these fluids. Free amino acid analysis was then used to quantitatively analyze middle ear microaspirates in order to test the hypothesis that perilymph is a potential source of clear fluid in perilymphatic fistulas (PLF). Fourteen unknown samples from patients with visually identified PLF, including patients with no identifiable otic capsule defect, were studied. Six samples on amino acid pattern analysis were correlated most similarly with perilymph (rrho greater than 0.95). Four of these six samples were scored on the basis of quantitative amino acid values as similar to perilymph. However, three samples of clear fluid were more similar to serum/plasma than to perilymph on both amino acid pattern and quantitative amino acid score analysis. These results objectively suggest perilymph as a potential source of clear fluid in some patients with a diagnosis of PLF. Not all clear fluid observed in the middle ear, however, is potentially perilymph. 
Predictors of clinical response in hirsute women treated with spironolactone. OBJECTIVE: To examine the clinical efficacy of low dose spironolactone in hirsute women. DESIGN: Retrospective. SETTING: Outpatient endocrinology clinic. PATIENTS: One hundred nine consecutive women prescribed 75 to 100 mg/d spironolactone for at least 4 months in whom adequate follow-up data were available. RESULTS: Hirsutism improved in 72% of the women. Women with regular menses, whether or not they used oral contraceptives (OCs), had the highest response rate to spironolactone (78%), whereas women with irregular menses who did not use an OC had the lowest response rate (55%). Favorable responses were associated with increased severity of hirsutism (P = 0.04) and lower serum dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate levels (P = 0.05). Responders and nonresponders did not differ significantly in age (P = 0.10), duration of hirsutism (P = 0.14), pretreatment serum testosterone (T) (P = 0.48), or body mass index (P = 0.11). However, when each parameter was divided into subsets, trends toward decreasing response were observed with increasing age, duration of hirsutism over 15 years, and increasing serum T level. CONCLUSION: Low-dose spironolactone improves hirsutism in a majority of hirsute women, irrespective of age, severity or duration of hirsutism, menstrual status, or serum hormone levels. 
Quantitative analysis of basal dendrites of prefrontal pyramidal cells after chronic alcohol consumption and withdrawal in the adult rat. The effects of chronic alcohol consumption and withdrawal on the organization of the basal dendrites of layer III pyramidal cells of the prelimbic cortex were studied in groups of rats fed on alcohol for 6 or 18 months, and in a group fed for 12 months, then switched to water for a further 6 months (withdrawal group). Three-dimensional analysis of the dendritic arborizations showed an age-dependent increase in several dendritic parameters, but a net stability was found in the metrical parameters between alcohol-fed and respective control rats. Conversely, a dendritic impoverishment occurred in the withdrawal group. The linear density of dendritic spines remained stable in all groups studied. Together with the previously found marked loss of the neurons after alcohol consumption and withdrawal, these findings point to a decrease in the available targets for afferents and therefore to the presence of probable functional alterations as a consequence of those in the connectivity patterns of the prelimbic area occurring under these conditions. 
Endometriosis in episiotomy scar with anal sphincter involvement. Report of a case. A case of endometriosis in an episiotomy scar with involvement of the external anal sphincter is presented. The clinical, operative, and pathologic findings are reported. The question of etiology and treatment is discussed, and the literature is reviewed. Wide excision of the ectopic endometrial tissue with primary reconstruction of the external sphincter was curative, and the functional result was excellent. It is suggested that this treatment policy should be recommended for these cases. 
Aortic dissection resulting from tear of transverse arch: is concomitant arch repair warranted? Forty-seven patients with aortic dissection resulting from a primary tear located in the transverse aortic arch underwent surgical treatment. Twenty-six patients had acute type A, 7 had acute type B, 7 had chronic type A, and 7 had chronic type B aortic dissections. Of the 33 patients with acute dissections, 11 (7 acute type A and 4 acute type B) underwent concomitant arch repair with an operative (less than or equal to 30 days) mortality rate of 55% (35% to 73%, +/- 1 asymmetric 70% confidence limit) (2 of 7 acute type A and 4 of 4 acute type B). Concomitant arch repair was omitted in 22 patients with acute dissections (19 acute type A and 3 acute type B); the operative mortality rate was 41% (29% to 54%) (7 of 19 acute type A and 2 of 3 acute type B) (p = not significant versus arch repair). The overall survival rate for those with arch repair was 45% +/- 15% (+/- 1 standard error of the estimate) at 4 years, compared with 43% +/- 11% for patients without arch repair (p = not significant). Considering the type of dissection, the 4-year survival estimate for patients with acute type A dissections who underwent arch repair (5 hemiarch and 2 total arch) was 71% +/- 17% (versus 44% +/- 12% for acute type A patients without arch repair). There were no survivors among the 4 patients with acute type B dissections who had an arch repair (1 hemiarch and 3 total arch), whereas patients with acute type B dissections who did not undergo concomitant arch repair had a 4-year survival estimate of 33% +/- 27% (p = not significant versus arch repair). Four other patients with acute type B dissections resulting from an arch tear were managed medically and tended to have a slightly better prognosis (2-year survival estimate of 75% +/- 22% versus 14% +/- 13% for all surgically treated acute type B patients), but again this difference was not statistically significant. Multivariate analysis of the 47 surgical patients revealed that advanced age (p = 0.0008), preoperative dissection complications (p = 0.02), and other coexistent medical problems (p = 0.03) were the only significant, independent determinants of overall mortality. Initial arch repair was not a significant predictor. Nine percent (2/22) of patients with acute type A dissections who initially underwent isolated ascending aortic replacement required subsequent arch replacement; 1 died after reoperation.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS). 
The eosinophilia-myalgia syndrome: the Los Alamos Conference. On June 12 and 13, 1990 the Los Alamos National Laboratory in cooperation with the New Mexico Department of Health and Environment, the Centers for Disease Control (CDC), the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), and the National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases of the National Institutes of Health (NIH) hosted a conference on the eosinophilia-myalgia syndrome. Fifty presentations covered a variety of important issues which are summarized herein. 
Interleukin-7 differentiates a subgroup of acute lymphoblastic leukemias. The bone marrow stromal cell-derived growth factor interleukin-7 (IL-7) is known to stimulate growth of normal human B-cell precursors. In the present report, we have examined the effect of IL-7 on neoplastic B-cell precursors. Leukemic cells from 20 patients with common acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) were highly purified by removing contaminating T cells and monocytes by rosetting with immunomagnetic beads. IL-7 markedly reduced the DNA synthesis in leukemic cells from three patients. This inhibition of DNA synthesis was accompanied by maturation of the cells, as demonstrated by the induced expression of the differentiation antigens CD19, CD20, CDw75, and surface mu-chain, and a decreased expression of terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase. By examining G1 parameters, such as MYC, 4F2, and transferrin-receptor levels analyzed by flow cytometry as well as RNA and the cell cycle regulated antigen Ki67, it appeared that the cells were inhibited late in G1. Leukemic cells from the majority of the cases (12 of the 20 patients) responded to IL-7 with enhanced DNA synthesis without detectable maturation, as has been reported for their normal counterparts. Low molecular weight B-cell growth factor greatly potentiated the IL-7-induced growth stimulation of these cells. Thus, we have shown that IL-7 is capable of inhibiting proliferation of leukemic cells isolated from a subgroup of ALLs, and that this growth inhibition is accompanied by maturation of the cells. 
Magnesium inhibits the hypertensive but not the cardiotonic actions of low-dose epinephrine. Intravenous magnesium supplementation is often used to control cardiac arrhythmias and coronary artery vasospasm resulting from disturbances of magnesium homeostasis after coronary artery bypass surgery. Many such patients also require inotropic drug support of depressed myocardial function. However, increased serum magnesium concentrations directly depress cardiac contractility in animals and may interfere with catecholamine actions. To determine whether small intravenous doses of magnesium sulfate (MgSO4) interfere with the cardiotonic actions of epinephrine, we examined the hemodynamic effects of MgSO4 and epinephrine infusion in 17 cardiac surgical patients on their 1st postoperative day in a prospective, controlled study. In 11 patients, infusion of MgSO4 (7-mg.kg-1 bolus followed by 10 mg.kg-1.h-1 as a continuous infusion) increased serum magnesium concentrations by 44% (mean +/- standard error of the mean [SEM] of 0.8 +/- 0.1 to 1.2 +/- 0.1 mM; P less than 0.01) but had no significant effect on heart rate; mean arterial, central venous, or pulmonary arterial occlusion pressures; or cardiac output. Epinephrine infusion (30 ng.kg-1.min-1) significantly increased cardiac index (2.7 +/- 0.1 to 3.1 +/- 0.21.min-1.m-2; P less than 0.05); this effect was not altered by MgSO4 administration (n = 11). However, MgSO4 significantly blunted epinephrine's hypertensive action and prevented a significant increase in mean arterial pressure during concurrent MgSO4-epinephrine administration. Six placebo control patients were given two sequential infusions of epinephrine separated by a placebo infusion to rule out an effect of time on the hemodynamic response to epinephrine. Mean arterial pressure and cardiac index responses to epinephrine were identical before and after placebo infusion. 
Diagnostic importance of the radiographic density of noncalcified breast masses: analysis of 91 lesions. Radiographic density is considered an important feature in the evaluation of noncalcified breast masses, yet no studies assessing its value have been published. The radiographic densities of 91 biopsy-proved, nonfatty, noncalcified breast masses were evaluated by three mammographers. The density determinations made by each observer were compared with the histologic outcome for the 51 benign and 40 malignant lesions. With the kappa statistic, interobserver agreement was relatively poor (0.22 to 0.49), and intraobserver agreement for one expert mammographer was 0.50. When the majority opinion of the mammographers was used, sensitivity was 48%, specificity was 80%, and both positive and negative predictive values were 66%. As a solitary feature in lesion analysis, mammographic density is difficult to assess and is of limited value for the prediction of the benign or malignant nature of noncalcified breast masses. 
Retrograde suction decompression of an ophthalmic artery aneurysm using balloon occlusion. Technical note. A large ophthalmic artery aneurysm was ligated using a modification of the retrograde suction technique described by Batjer and Samson. Temporary proximal occlusion of the internal carotid artery was accomplished with a double-lumen balloon catheter, and distal occlusion was performed with a temporary clip. The aneurysm was collapsed by gentle aspiration through the distal lumen of the balloon catheter. This greatly facilitated dissection and clip ligation of the aneurysm. 
Patterns in visual interpretation of coronary arteriograms as detected by quantitative coronary arteriography. In part 1 of a three-part study, 14 novice readers and 6 experienced cardiologists interpreted phantom images of known stenosis severity. No difference between the interpretations of experienced and novice readers was detectable. Visual estimates of "moderately" severe stenosis were 30% higher than actual percent diameter stenosis. In part 2 of the study, visual interpretation of percent diameter stenosis from 212 stenoses on 241 arteriograms was compared with quantitative coronary arteriographic assessment. The visual analysis overestimated disease severity in arteries with greater than or equal to 50% diameter stenosis (except for right coronary lesions) and underestimated severity in all arteries with less than 50% diameter stenosis. Of the 241 arteriograms, 40 had quantitative and visual analysis of all three coronary arteries for assessment of significant disease. In only 62% of the cases did visual and quantitative methods agree on the presence of severe disease; visual estimates diagnosed significantly (p less than 0.05) more three-vessel disease. In part 3 of the study, comparison of percent diameter stenosis by visual estimate with quantitative coronary arteriographic assessment before and after balloon angioplasty of 38 stenoses showed that visual interpretation significantly (p less than 0.001) overestimated initial lesion severity and underestimated stenosis severity after angioplasty. 
Headache syndromes as detected by configural frequency analysis. Data on headache symptoms obtained in two samples (N = 422 and 304) by means of questionnaires were subjected to configural frequency analysis (CFA). This not widely-known method tests whether certain symptom combinations appear more often or less often than expected by chance. In both samples symptom combinations corresponding to the syndromes of migraine with aura, migraine without aura and tension headache did indeed occur with significant frequency. The same clear-cut symptom patterns appeared when patients with preceding visual disturbances were excluded from analysis. These results seem to lend strong support to a categorical model of headache, rather than to the concept of headache as a spectrum. 
Phenytoin-induced hemocytophagic histiocytosis indistinguishable from malignant histiocytosis. We have reported a case of phenytoin-induced hemocytophagic histiocytosis indistinguishable on clinical and histopathologic grounds from malignant histiocytosis. We emphasize the need to investigate for microbiologic causes and drug ingestion, even if the diagnosis of malignant histiocytosis is plausible. We think that reactive and malignant histiocytosis are not really two distinct entities with different etiologies, but a continuum of host responses to several insults with different degrees of aggressiveness depending on the host immune status. 
Radiologic findings of clonorchiasis. Clonorchiasis is a trematodiasis caused by chronic infestation of liver flukes, Clonorchis sinensis. The adult flukes reside in the medium-sized and small intrahepatic bile ducts and, occasionally, in the extrahepatic bile ducts, gallbladder, and pancreatic duct. The result is mechanical obstruction, inflammatory reaction, adenomatous hyperplasia, and periductal fibrosis. Signs and symptoms are usually mild and nonspecific, but heavy infestation results in obstructive jaundice. The disease has a close relationship with recurrent pyogenic cholangitis and cholangiocarcinoma. In this article, the radiologic findings, including cholangiography, sonography, and CT of clonorchiasis are reviewed in light of the pathophysiology of the disease. The relationship to recurrent pyogenic cholangitis and to cholangiocarcinoma is discussed. 
An immunoinhibitory cell wall glycoprotein (mannan) from Trichophyton rubrum. Trichophyton rubrum causes 90% of chronic dermatophyte infections. Most patients with widespread chronic T. rubrum infection fail to express a delayed hypersensitivity reaction to intradermally injected trichophytin. We propose that cell-mediated immunity to T. rubrum may be suppressed in chronic infections by the mannan cell wall component of the fungus. The proposed suppressive effect of T. rubrum mannan on cell-mediated immunity was tested by measuring the ability of extracted mannan to inhibit lymphoproliferative responses of human mononuclear leukocytes to antigens, mitogens, and an anti-T-cell receptor antibody (anti-CD3) in vitro. Mannan was found to be highly antigenic in two of five donors and weakly antigenic in the other three. Despite its antigenic property, mannan exhibited a dose-related ability to inhibit lymphoproliferation stimulated by other agents including 1) antigens from Candida albicans, T. rubrum, and tetanus toxoid (ID50 = 250 micrograms/ml); 2) anti-CD3 antibody (ID50 = 250 micrograms/ml); and 3) Phaseolus limensis mitogenic lectin (ID50 = 64 micrograms/ml). Mannan added to cultures later than 24 h after initiation had no inhibitory influence, but culture of cells with mannan for a period of 24 h prior to the addition of stimulus enhanced the inhibitory effect of the glycoprotein. Lymphoproliferation in response to recombinant interleukin-2 (IL-2) was not inhibited. The influence of time of addition of mannan and the failure of mannan to inhibit IL-2-stimulated lymphoproliferation demonstrate that the suppressive effect of mannan must be pharmacologic rather than cytotoxic. The observed ability of T. rubrum cell wall mannan to suppress cell-mediated immune function in vitro may provide an important clue to a mechanism enabling the fungus to avoid elimination in chronically infected patients. 
Polycystic kidneys, pancreatic cysts, and cystadenomatous bile ducts in the oral-facial-digital syndrome type I. Oral-facial-digital syndrome type I is a group of X-linked dominant conditions, lethal in utero in male individuals. Internal anomalies are less well documented than are external findings. We report a case of typical phenotype and absent family history of kidney disease in a 15-year-old white girl (46,XX) who died of renal failure and massive cerebral hemorrhage. At necropsy, the kidneys were greatly enlarged but of fairly normal shape. The cortex was replaced by thin-walled spherical cysts, 0.5 to 2.0 cm in diameter; the majority of the smaller cysts were located deep in the cortex, and the medulla contained lesser numbers of larger cysts. No distal urinary tract obstruction was present. Microdissection revealed cysts and diverticula located in all segments of the nephrons and collecting ducts. Uninvolved nephrons showed diffuse hypertrophy. These findings were correlated with immunoperoxidase stains using peanut lectin, Lotus tetragonolobus agglutinin, antibodies to cytokeratins, stage-specific embryonic antigen-1, Tamm-Horsfall protein, and epithelial membrane antigen. Other visceral anomalies included biliary cystadenomatous proliferation in the liver and pancreatic cysts. The renal changes are similar to those of autosomal dominant (adult-type) polycystic disease. 
Effect of the tibial cut on subsidence following total knee arthroplasty. In 33 total knee arthroplasties (TKAs) using instrumentation designed to cut the tibia with 0 degree posterior slope, ten tibial components demonstrated at least 2 mm of tibial component subsidence. These subsided components were implanted onto tibiae with an average of 8 degrees +/- 2 degrees difference between the preoperative, anatomic posterior slope and their postoperative posterior slope. The remaining 23 components, without subsidence, were implanted onto tibiae cut within 2 degrees +/- 2 degrees of their anatomic slope. To help understand these clinical observations, a laboratory study was performed to compare the load carrying capacity and the stiffness of tibial subchondral bone following two types of tibial cuts: one made perpendicular to the long axis of the tibia and the other made parallel to the articular surface of the tibia. Mock tibial baseplates mounted on paired cadaver tibiae were loaded in compression and force displacement curves were recorded. Tibiae cut parallel to the surface exhibited 40% greater load carrying capacity and 70% greater stiffness than the paired tibiae cut perpendicular to the long axis. The biomechanical data of this study indicated that cutting the tibia perpendicular to the long axis results in weaker bone that may be inadequate to support a tibial component. This may explain the higher incidence of clinical subsidence if the tibial cut is not made approximately parallel to the anatomic slope. 
Finapres: a noninvasive device to monitor blood pressure. Often, obstetric patients are not evaluated in preliminary studies during the development of new medical devices. The purpose of this study was to compare the Finapres digital probe with oscillometric and arterial line devices for recording blood pressures in low- and high-risk pregnant women. A total of 38 women were studied, including 24 with pregnancy-induced hypertension, two with chronic hypertension, two with cardiac disease, and ten who had no risk factors but requested epidural catheter placement. The comparison of Finapres or oscillometric recordings with direct arterial values confirmed that systolic recordings were imprecise for both devices (r = 0.80 and r = 0.64, respectively). Diastolic recordings (Korotkoff sound, phase 4) from the Finapres were accurate compared with the arterial values (r = 0.84). The Finapres performed at least as reliably as the oscillometric monitor in assessing blood pressure in our pregnant population and provided continuous measurements. When very accurate systolic recordings are needed, arterial catheter placement may be necessary. 
Some perspectives on peptic ulcer. In this article, the author comments on the following topics: whether peptic ulcer is a disease or just the sign of another process; whether the crater has a multifactorial origin; the ubiquity of Helicobacter pylori and the conclusion that a specific strain will doubtless prove to be the cause of some, but not all, ulcers; the inherent definitional problem of "nonulcer dyspepsia"; and the controversy over how much gastric acid needs to be reduced to speed the healing of peptic ulcer. 
Hepatocyte proliferation in stepwise development of experimental liver cell cancer. Cell proliferation is the most central and key phenotypic property of cancer including hepatocellular carcinoma. Hepatocyte proliferation is central not only at the late steps in carcinogenesis, the cancer, but at the earliest known step, initiation. Compensatory or regenerative hepatocyte proliferation is essential to initiation with chemical carcinogens but primary hyperplasia is ineffective. During promotion, hepatocyte proliferation is the major change seen as clonal proliferation to generate nodules occurs. During progression, autonomous hepatocyte proliferation balanced by cell loss makes its appearance. This continues in a balanced fashion with only a slight excess of proliferation over loss until the earlier steps in malignancy at which time the balance is disrupted. 
Splenosis: an unusual cause of intraabdominal hemorrhage. A 31-year-old female presented to the emergency department with an acute onset of severe abdominal pain. She developed hypovolemic shock from an intra-abdominal bleed. At laparotomy she was found to be bleeding from two areas of splenosis on the uterine ligament. The patient had sustained a ruptured spleen 22 years prior and had no symptomatology from her areas of splenosis. A short review of splenosis is presented. 
Streptokinase and recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (rt-PA) are equally effective in treating acute myocardial infarction. In recent trials, patients with myocardial infarction who received either recombinant tissue-type plasminogen activator (rt-PA) or streptokinase showed essentially no difference in the amount of myocardial salvage, in mortality reduction, or in the incidence of bleeding complications. These findings thus failed to fulfill the expectation that rt-PA would be twice as effective as streptokinase as a thrombolytic agent. The basis for this mistaken prediction was an unfortunate overemphasis on an inadequate surrogate endpoint, namely, the patency or reperfusion rate at 90 minutes after the start of therapy. Using the 90-minute patency or reperfusion rate as an endpoint has several serious limitations. First, it is an observation made at only one point in time during a dynamic process that may change even during the infusion proper. Second, a single view at 90 minutes completely disregards the possibility of subsequent reocclusion which often occurs within 1 hour after treatment. Third, an image at 90 minutes is more a reflection of the speed of thrombolysis than of whether lysis will eventually occur; the pace of clot lysis depends on both the agent used and the age of the thrombus. Fourth, lysis at 90 minutes is of minimal relevance for myocardial salvage unless observed within the time frame when infarction size can be limited significantly, which is generally less than 4 hours between symptom onset and the time that reperfusion is accomplished. Fifth, a stable state of vessel patency is meaningful for mortality reduction even if stabilization occurs after completion of the infarction. Such "late," but lasting, patency is a critical component of the "open vessel" principle and explains, at least in part, the survival benefit that accrues to patients treated even 24 hours after the onset of symptoms. There is currently no evidence that rt-PA has a more beneficial effect on survival or function than does streptokinase or any other plasminogen activator used in treating acute myocardial infarction; nor is there any evidence that patients who receive rt-PA therapy show a decreased incidence of bleeding complications compared with those who receive streptokinase, despite the relative fibrinogen-sparing attribute of rt-PA. Given the poor predictive value of the 90-minute angiogram for ultimate clinical advantage of one agent over another, studies that are limited to this endpoint are of marginal use in evaluating treatment regimens used in mortality studies. The best evidence to date indicates that streptokinase and rt-PA are of equivalent value for survival after acute myocardial infarction, a conclusion that can be justifiably challenged only with a valid mortality study. 
Successful transcatheter embolization of pseudoaneurysm associated with pancreatic pseudocyst. Hemorrhage into a pancreatic pseudocyst is a rare event, but is the most rapidly lethal complication of chronic pancreatitis. Visceral-vessel aneurysms are an unexpectedly common finding in arteriography of patients with chronic pancreatitis. This case report describes bleeding from an anterior superior pancreaticoduodenal artery aneurysm, caused by chronic pancreatitis. The aneurysm was successfully treated by embolization with a steel coil. 
Concealed rhythms by double ventricular parasystole. Electrocardiograms taken from 11 patients in sinus rhythm with ventricular ectopic rhythms from two different foci were analyzed to find the number of sinus beats, S, between the ectopic rhythms (S values). Three out of 11 patients had the S values typical for concealed ectopic rhythms. One of them had concealed bigeminy of 2n-1 form that occasionally shifted to 2n form. Following the shift, S values of 2n-1 form were always achieved by the occurrence of double ventricular ectopic rhythms in succession. Concealed trigeminy of 3n and 3n-2 form was seen in the other two patients. Double ventricular ectopic rhythms had bizarre abnormal QRS complexes of two different morphologies and were inscribed in opposite directions. Ectopic rhythms in each case had parasystolic characteristics. These observations suggest bifocal automaticity as a mechanism for bidirectional ventricular tachycardia. 
Cerebral vasculopathy associated with collateralization resembling moya moya phenomenon and with anti-Ro/SS-A and anti-La/SS-B antibodies. We describe a 48-year-old, previously healthy, anti-Ro/SS-A and anti-La/SS-B antibody positive black woman with negative risk factors for atherosclerosis, who developed mental status and personality changes over a 6-12-month period, and progressive cortical blindness over a 2-week period. Angiographic and computed axial tomographic studies of the brain demonstrated multiple large areas of infarction correlating with stenosis and occlusions of the internal carotid and posterior cerebral arteries. Moya moya-like findings were prominent radiographically. Results of angiographic, computed tomographic, and magnetic resonance imaging studies were interpreted as being compatible with large, medium, and small vessel disease, most likely a vasculitis. 
Myocardial and aerobic requirements for an upper body exerciser: implications for cardiac rehabilitation. To assess the cardiorespiratory, hemodynamic, and electrocardiograph (ECG) responses to an upper body exercise device, we studied ten cardiac men (mean age +/- SD = 58.0 +/- 6.5 years) who performed three five-minute exercise bouts at metronome settings of 20, 50, and 80 clicks per minute. Operation of the device involved shuttling a plastic buoy on two 6-m waxed ropes between two persons. Aerobic requirements were generally appropriate for arm training, corresponding to mean values of 5.3, 7.0, and 10.1 ml.kg-1.min-1 at the three progressive metronome settings. Perceived exertion (Borg, 6 to 20 scale) at these work rates was 8.3, 10.4, and 14.6, whereas average heart rate and systolic blood pressure responses were 77, 85, and 114 beats.min-1 and 145, 158, and 175 mmHg, respectively. Continuous ECG monitoring during upper body exercise revealed no significant ST-segment depression or serious arrhythmias. The device appears to be a safe and effective complement to a cardiac exercise training program. 
Carcinoma and DNA aneuploidy in Crohn's colitis--a histological and flow cytometric study. Twenty four patients with longstanding colonic Crohn's disease were examined prospectively with colonoscopy and multiple biopsy sampling in order to detect histological dysplasia or abnormal aneuploid DNA content, or both. Biopsy specimens were taken from 10 predetermined locations in the colon and rectum. No patient had definite dysplasia but three displayed DNA aneuploidy (12.5%), and one of these subsequently developed a carcinoma (Dukes' C at operation) in the ascending colon. No concomitant dysplasia was detected but the carcinoma as well as other parts of the mucosa were DNA aneuploid. It is concluded that dysplasia is rare in patients with Crohn's colitis, but findings of DNA aneuploidy warrant vigilance in follow up as this may indicate impending carcinoma. Further prospective studies are needed before the predictive value of DNA aneuploidy can be determined and before general recommendations of colonoscopic surveillance, as in longstanding ulcerative colitis, can be made. 
Ocutome lensectomy: results and complications. We describe the results and the complications encountered in 69 lensectomies performed via a limbal approach with the Ocutome vitrectomy instrument, in which it was the intention at surgery to maintain the integrity of the posterior capsule. After operation 87% improved in visual acuity, and 68% achieved 6/12 or better. The main early complications encountered were perioperative rupture of the posterior capsule and iris damage. The main late complications were postoperative thickening of the posterior capsule, retinal detachment, and bullous keratopathy. Of the eyes in which the posterior capsule remained intact after operation 17% developed thickening of the posterior capsule to a degree that required capsulotomy over a mean follow-up period of 50 months. 
Avascular necrosis of bone in children undergoing allogeneic bone marrow transplantation. Avascular necrosis of bone (AVNB) is reported in two children after allogeneic bone marrow transplantation. Preparation therapy for transplantation included cyclophosphamide and total body irradiation. Corticosteroids, cyclosporine A, and methotrexate were used for graft-versus-host-disease prophylaxis. The possible role of combination therapy in development of AVNB is discussed, but a direct relationship with single agents was not found. However, an early diagnosis is important to institute conservative treatment and prevent irreversible damage to affected joints. Magnetic resonance imaging was found to be more sensitive than plain radiography in early detection of AVNB. 
Cerebral dural sinus thrombosis. Cerebral dural sinus thrombosis is an unusual syndrome in which a patient presents with a severe headache that may be associated with diverse neurologic and physical findings. The case of a 31-year-old woman with headache, vomiting, generalized tonic-clonic seizure, and subsequent dense hemiplegia is presented. The patient was diagnosed as having a cerebral dural sinus thrombosis, but only after the diagnosis was missed initially. The syndrome may be difficult to detect because it can mimic several other entities. There are several known or suspected predisposing factors. The syndrome, diagnostic modalities, and therapeutic options are reviewed. 
Isradipine, a calcium antagonist, in the control of hypertension following coronary artery-bypass surgery. Arterial hypertension is common after coronary artery-bypass grafting (CABG) surgery and may lead to postoperative complications. Therefore, the effects of the calcium antagonist isradipine were studied in 10 postoperative CABG patients who had a mean arterial pressure (MAP) above 100 mm Hg. Isradipine, given as a continuous infusion, reduced MAP to the range of 85 +/- 5 mm Hg in all patients within 15 min. Systemic vascular resistance fell and cardiac output increased in all patients. A slight increase in heart rate was seen in some, but not all, patients. There were no adverse effects. In conclusion, isradipine appears to be a useful agent in the treatment of postoperative hypertension following CABG surgery. 
Pulmonary vascular distensibility of arterial, middle, and venous regions in newborn lambs. The pulmonary circulation in the adult is characterized by being relatively distensible, but whether the newborn lung shares this feature is less certain. We perfused isolated lungs treated with indomethacin from lambs of four ages (less than 1, 2-4, 12-14, and 30-32 days) to determine the effects of increasing left atrial pressure on the pulmonary vascular pressures measured by vascular inflow and outflow occlusion. An index of pulmonary vascular distensibility was assessed by comparing the slope of the pulmonary vascular pressure at the upstream end of a region as a function of the pressure at the downstream end of the region. A vascular distensibility index (VDI) of 1 indicates a rigid nondistensible system, whereas a VDI less than 1 indicates some degree of distensibility. During normoxia, lungs from all age groups were relatively indistensible as determined by VDI for the total vasculature (VDItotal) as well as for the different regions based on occlusion pressures (VDIarterial, VDImiddle, and VDIvenous). There were significant effects of age on the VDItotal, with decreases in the normoxic values occurring over the first 12-14 days of age, indicating an increase in pulmonary vascular distensibility. Only the VDIvenous was similarly affected by increasing neonatal age. Hypoxia significantly reduced the VDItotal in these same age groups. In addition, hypoxia, which increased the pressure gradients of the arterial and middle regions, significantly increased the VDIarterial in the youngest and oldest age groups but significantly decreased the VDImiddle at all ages by approximately 50%. In summary, we observed age-related changes in the vascular distensibility of the pulmonary circulation, with the VDItotal decreasing with increasing postnatal age. 
Congenital malignant melanoma of the eye. Twenty-three cases of congenital malignant melanoma have previously been reported. Here the authors report the first case of a congenital malignant melanoma arising in the eye. A newborn girl had a large pigmented ocular tumor, hepatomegaly, and multiple pigmented skin and choroidal lesions. The histopathologic diagnosis was of a malignant melanoma with hepatic metastases. The skin and choroidal lesions were considered to be congenital melanocytic nevi. The most plausible pathogenetic link between these two conditions was that the malignancy had arisen as a second-hit mutation within a choroidal congenital melanocytic nevus. Despite widespread metastases the baby, treated by surgery and chemotherapy, survives in good health, aged 2 years, 10 months. 
Association of nm23-H1 allelic deletions with distant metastases in colorectal carcinoma. A prospective study analysed the prognostic value of nm23-H1 allelic deletions in colorectal cancer. Of 21 patients with no evidence of distant metastases at initial operation, 11 showed nm23-H1 allelic deletions (including 1 homozygous deletion); 10 had no nm23-H1 deletions. After median follow-up of 25 months, distant metastases had developed in 8 of 11 (73%) patients with nm23-H1 deletions but in only 2 of 10 (20%) without nm23-H1 deletions (p less than 0.03). Tests with probe YNZ 22.1, near p53, showed no significant association with distant metastases. nm23-H1 may be, or may be located near, a late-acting suppressor gene in colorectal carcinoma, in which deletions may have prognostic value. 
Suppression by traumatic brain injury of spontaneous hemodynamic recovery from hemorrhagic shock in rats. The effects of brain trauma on cardiovascular and endocrine responses to hemorrhage were investigated. Forty anesthetized rats were randomly assigned to one of four groups of 10 rats each: a control group (Group C): a group with induction of hemorrhage at 16.2 ml/kg/10 min (Group H); a group with fluid-percussion brain injury at a peak pressure of 1.7 atm and an impulse duration of 25 msec (Group T); and a group receiving hemorrhagic shock following brain trauma (Group TH). Group C and T rats showed no significant alterations in cardiovascular function. At the end of hemorrhage there were no significant differences between Groups TH and H in the nadirs of mean arterial blood pressure (MABP) (mean values +/- standard error of the mean: 42 +/- 2 vs. 40 +/- 4 mm Hg) and stroke volume index (SVI) (0.61 +/- 0.11 vs. 0.66 +/- 0.10 ml/bt/kg); however, 1 hour post-hemorrhage recovery was blunted in Group TH compared to Group H (MABP 56 +/- 4 vs. 65 +/- 3 mm Hg; cardiac index 182 +/- 15 vs. 220 +/- 15 ml/min/kg; and SVI 0.71 +/- 0.06 vs. 0.81 +/- 0.06 ml/bt/kg). Since the two groups showed no significant differences in heart rate, preload (central venous pressure), and afterload (systemic vascular resistance), the reduced cardiac index recovery in Group TH is believed due to the attenuation of cardiac contractile performance. The Group TH preparation potentiated hormonal responses to hemorrhage with significantly higher epinephrine and aldosterone levels than in Group H. Brain trauma enhanced the norepinephrine response to hemorrhage, even at an injury level that by itself did not result in an increase in this hormone. Group TH rats also had significantly lower blood pH and HCO3 levels. The data suggest that brain trauma suppresses MABP and cardiac index recovery after hemorrhage mainly by inhibiting cardiac contractile performance, probably due to high catecholamine levels and severe metabolic acidosis. 
Fine-needle aspiration biopsy of thyroid nodules. A cost-effective diagnostic plan. Fine-needle aspiration biopsy is a safe and accurate method for diagnosing thyroid nodules. Personnel who have experience with the aspiration technique and with the cytologic classification of specimens are crucial to accurate results. One important advantage of using fine-needle biopsy to initially screen patients with nodules is that it can save substantially on healthcare resources. 
Return of interdigestive motor complex after abdominal surgery. End of postoperative ileus? Gastrointestinal mechanical activity was studied in 13 patients after different surgical procedures in a fasted and fed state and after pharmacological stimulation. Mechanical activity was recorded by means of a multi-pressure sensor probe placed intraoperatively into the jejunum. Abdominal surgery abolished normal motility only for a short period of time. The time for the reappearance of regular recurring activity fronts varied with the type of the surgical procedure from 3 hr after cholecystectomy to the sixth postoperative day after colon resection. The fed pattern occurred after the first postoperative interdigestive motor complex in all experiments. Stimulation was observed with ceruletide, which induced contractile activity in the small intestine during postoperative ileus. No coordinated caudad propagating activity was observed. The postoperative interdigestive motor complex did not correlate in time with the first passage of flatus and stool in our patients. Thus, the restoration of motility in the small intestine did not coincide with the clinical relief from the so-called "physiological" postoperative ileus. 
The medial temporal lobe memory system. Studies of human amnesia and studies of an animal model of human amnesia in the monkey have identified the anatomical components of the brain system for memory in the medial temporal lobe and have illuminated its function. This neural system consists of the hippocampus and adjacent, anatomically related cortex, including entorhinal, perirhinal, and parahippocampal cortices. These structures, presumably by virtue of their widespread and reciprocal connections with neocortex, are essential for establishing long-term memory for facts and events (declarative memory). The medial temporal lobe memory system is needed to bind together the distributed storage sites in neocortex that represent a whole memory. However, the role of this system is only temporary. As time passes after learning, memory stored in neocortex gradually becomes independent of medial temporal lobe structures. 
Dysfunction of the beta- and alpha-adrenergic systems in a model of congestive heart failure. The pacing-overdrive dog. The functional integrity of the beta- and alpha-adrenergic stimulatory pathways in a rapid ventricular pacing model of congestive heart failure in dogs was investigated; normal dogs served as controls. Total beta-adrenergic receptor density was 35% lower (p less than 0.01) in the pacing-overdrive dogs, and the beta-adrenergic receptor-mediated stimulation of adenylate cyclase (Vmax) was found to be 68% and 72% lower (p less than 0.01) in the left and right ventricles of the paced dogs. In addition, the basal adenylate cyclase activity was found to be 56% and 68% lower (p less than 0.01) in the left and right ventricles of the failing heart. Similarly, the Vmax of 5'-guanylylimidodiphosphate (GppNHp) and forskolin stimulation of adenylate cyclase activity was significantly lower, 70% and 55%, respectively (p less than 0.01), in both ventricles of the paced dogs. However, although the concentration yielding half-maximal velocity for beta-agonist and GppNHp stimulation of adenylate cyclase was similar in both groups, that for forskolin stimulation of the enzyme was significantly increased (p less than 0.01). Pertussis toxin-mediated ADP-ribosylation of membranes from control and failing hearts revealed a significant decrease in the inhibitory guanine nucleotide binding protein content (48 +/- 9%, p less than 0.01) in the hearts of the paced dogs. Moreover, although the pertussis toxin treatment increased the basal and the forskolin-stimulated adenylate cyclase activity in both normal and failing heart membranes, the adenylate cyclase activity remained significantly depressed in the failing heart after pertussis toxin treatment (p less than 0.01). Consistent with the depressed adenylate cyclase activity, mechanical studies on isolated papillary muscles and trabeculae revealed a decrease in baseline total tension (from 7.0 +/- 0.7 to 3.8 +/- 0.4 g/mm2, p less than 0.01) and dT/dt (from 26 +/- 8 to 13 +/- 1 g/mm2/sec, p less than 0.01) in the pacing-overdrive model. Tension generation and dT/dt observed in the paced dogs in response to increasing concentrations of forskolin demonstrated a rightward shift in the dose-response curve and a decrease in maximal forskolin stimulation (p less than 0.01). Similarly, maximal tension and dT/dt in the presence of isoproterenol was significantly lower than in the normal dogs (p less than 0.01). The decrease in beta-adrenergic responsiveness was accompanied by a decrease and rightward shift in alpha 1-adrenergic responsiveness (increase in tension was 1.1 +/- 0.1 g/mm2 in paced dogs versus 2.1 +/- 0.1 g/mm2 in controls, p less than 0.01).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS). 
No effect of zidovudine on hepatitis B virus replication in homosexual men with symptomatic HIV-1 infection. Zidovudine triphosphate inhibits the hepatitis B virus (HBV) DNA polymerase (DNAp) in vitro. Serial measurements of serum HBV DNAp activity and HBV DNA were made in 14 consecutive male homosexual patients starting zidovudine for symptomatic HIV-1 infection. Median duration of treatment was 15 weeks (range 2-72). In the 13 patients with detectable DNAp/DNA pre-treatment, no significant change in either measure of viral replication was observed during the first 16 weeks of treatment compared with the 13 weeks prior to treatment. The lack of response may be due to the opposing effect of immunosuppression, or to a failure of in vivo activity. 
Growth prognosis and growth after menarche in primary hypothyroidism. The long term growth of 20 girls and nine boys with juvenile primary hypothyroidism was studied until they reached final height. At diagnosis the girls had a mean age of 8.8 years (range 3.0-13.0); mean bone age was 5.4 years. The mean age of the boys at diagnosis was 9.5 years (range 3.7-14.2); mean bone age was 6.3 years. The patients were treated with thyroxine 100 micrograms/m2/day and serum thyroxine concentrations were maintained in the normal range. During treatment the rate of skeletal maturation exceeded the change in chronological age. Initial mean height SD score for bone age before treatment in the girls was +0.59 and after 11 years of treatment fell to -0.55 Mean height SD score for bone age in the boys decreased from +1.6 to -0.87 during treatment. In the girls the onset of puberty was 1.2 years later than the normal population but the duration of puberty was reduced. Mean age (SD) of menarche was 13.8 (1.7) years. The pattern of growth in girls with treated hypothyroidism was abnormal as growth continued after menarche, at a time when normal girls have almost stopped growing. During the second year after menarche our patients still had a mean growth velocity of 4.1 cm/year. Our data suggest that juvenile primary hypothyroidism results in a permanent height deficit. In addition, there is a loss of the normal harmony between growth and sexual maturation in girls, despite adequate treatment, in that growth continues for much longer after menarche than in normal girls. 
Intraperitoneal hemorrhage from hepatocellular carcinoma: emergency chemoembolization or embolization. From 1982 to 1990, 38 patients with intraperitoneal hemorrhage from hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) underwent treatment with emergency embolization with or without anticancer drug and iodized oil. Before emergency embolization, 24 patients had a serum total bilirubin value of 3.0 mg/dL or less (group A) and 14 patients had hyperbilirubinemia, with a serum bilirubin level greater than 3.0 mg/dL (group B). Successful hemostasis was achieved in all patients. The mean length of survival was 165 days in group A and 13 days in group B. A significant correlation (P less than .00003) between serum bilirubin level and prognosis was obtained. While tumor thrombus in the portal vein made the prognosis poor, there was no significant difference in prognosis between groups with and without tumor thrombus (P = .145). Emergency embolization is an effective treatment in patients with intraperitoneal hemorrhage from HCC. The prognosis for patients with HCC depends on the serum bilirubin level before embolization. 
Racial (black-white) differences in serum lipoprotein (a) distribution and its relation to parental myocardial infarction in children. Bogalusa Heart Study. BACKGROUND. The value of lipoprotein (a) [Lp(a)] in the prediction of coronary artery disease risk very early in life remains to be established in different racial groups. METHODS AND RESULTS. Serum Lp(a) distribution and its relation to parental histories of myocardial infarction were examined in 2,438 children (8-17 years old) from a biracial community. Parental myocardial infarction was used as a surrogate measure of future risk of disease in the offspring. Lp(a) levels averaged 1.7-fold higher in blacks than in whites (p less than 0.0001). A small but significant sex difference (females greater than males, p less than 0.05) was seen in both races. Race was the only independent variable that contributed appreciably (9%) to the variability of Lp(a) in serum. White children with parental myocardial infarction (n = 90) had increased levels of Lp(a) compared with those without parental myocardial infarction (22.4 versus 17.1 mg/dl, p less than 0.01). Furthermore, among white children, the prevalence of parental myocardial infarction was higher in those with Lp(a) levels of more than 25 mg/dl than in those with values of 25 mg/dl or less (9.5% versus 5.4%, p less than 0.01). In contrast, the relation of Lp(a) to parental myocardial infarction was not seen in black children. No associations were observed between parental myocardial infarction and serum levels of any of the lipids or lipoprotein cholesterol classes in children of either race. CONCLUSIONS. Serum Lp(a) levels may prove valuable in the assessment of coronary artery disease risk early in life among white populations. These findings also emphasize the need to evaluate the atherogenic potential of Lp(a) in different racial groups. 
Brucella meningoencephalitis associated with cerebrospinal fluid shunt in a child: case report. Brucella meningoencephalitis is rare in young children. We describe a patient who developed Brucella meningoencephalitis at the age of 20 months while he had a ventriculoperitoneal shunt in situ for treatment of hydrocephalus. This patient was treated with streptomycin and rifampicin. The shunt was left in situ, and all the clinical and laboratory test abnormalities subsided with this management. We propose that in a patient with Brucella meningoencephalitis, the cerebrospinal fluid shunt system can be left in situ and treatment with appropriate combination of antibiotics should prove to be successful. 
Posterior chamber IOL implantation with suboptimal posterior capsular support. A posterior chamber intraocular lens (PC/IOL) was implanted in 24 patients with suboptimal posterior capsular support due to preoperative or intraoperative rupture of the posterior capsule or zonules in which at least six clock hours of peripheral zonular support remained. The PC/IOLs were implanted, with ciliary sulcus haptic placement, with special attention to sulcus fixation of the haptics over the zone of residual zonular support. All of the IOLs have remained centered after a mean follow-up 10.5 months. We conclude that a PC/IOL can be successfully implanted and its position maintained if at least six clock hours of peripheral zonules remain. 
Anti-V region antibodies as "almost clonotypic" reagents for the study of cutaneous T cell lymphomas and leukemias. Despite recent advances in the understanding of normal T lymphocyte immunobiology, there has been little progress in characterizing the non-HTLV cutaneous T-cell lymphomas and leukemias (CTCL) Mycosis Fungoides and Sezary syndrome. The two major impediments to in vitro studies of these malignancies have been the contamination of CTCL cells with normal T cells and the inability to induce a vigorous proliferative response or establish long-term cultures with standard T-cell mitogens. The ideal reagent for identifying CTCL cells in a given patient would be tumor specific. Although a monoclonal antibody to the clonotypic antigen receptor on CTCL cells would approach this ideal, it is not currently feasible to generate such antibodies for each CTCL patient. As a compromise, we chose to test an "almost clonotypic" reagent by examining whether monoclonal antibodies directed at the variable (V) region of the T-cell antigen receptor could be applied to CTCL. We identified three Sezary patients, who by standard T-cell phenotype and Southern blot analysis for clonality had a virtually pure peripheral blood population of leukemic cells (PBL). We then screened the PBL of these patients with a panel of seven commercially available monoclonal anti-V region antibodies and found one patients' cells reacted greater than 99% with alpha V beta 5. The other patients' cells were non-reactive. In addition, we utilized a solid-phase system to cross-link V beta 5 on the one CTCL patients' PBL cells, and found that they proliferated vigorously in the presence of 10 units of IL-2 and IL-4. Parallel cultures have been maintained for one month by restimulation twice a week. These findings suggest that anti-V region antibodies should prove useful for investigating the immunobiology of CTCL. 
Roentgenographic dimensions of the upper airway in snoring patients with and without obstructive sleep apnea. The purpose of this study was to examine whether a simple test, such as routine roentgenographic views of the upper airway, is useful in identifying anatomic narrowing of the airway in patients with sleep apnea. To accomplish this, we prospectively studied a group of 117 patients (95 male and 22 female subjects) referred for evaluation of heavy snoring and possible obstructive sleep apnea. All patients had full nocturnal polysomnography, including measurements of snoring. Lateral view of the airway obtained after swallowing contrast material was used to measure pharyngeal diameters at three sites along the airway. All measurements were performed with the patients standing and supine. We used three different definitions of sleep apnea (apnea/hypopnea index of 10, 20, and 40), and compared airway diameters between the apneic and nonapneic snorers. Only when sleep apnea was defined as greater than 40 apneas plus hypopneas per hour of sleep was there a significant difference in airway diameter at the tip of the palate and 1 cm distal to it between apneic and nonapneic snorers. Both groups of patients demonstrated a significant reduction in the retropalatal distance on assumption of the supine posture. Stepwise, forward, multiple linear regression analysis showed that the retropalatal distance and airway diameter at the tip of the palate and 1 cm distal to it were significant predictors of snoring, but not apnea. We conclude that (1) airway diameters account for some of the variability in snoring, and (2) they do not differentiate between apneic and nonapneic snorers. 
Liver function tests abnormalities in patients with inflammatory bowel disease receiving artificial nutrition: a prospective randomized study of total enteral nutrition vs total parenteral nutrition. Liver and biliary abnormalities are well-known complications of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). It has been suggested that using total parenteral nutrition (TPN) may further impair liver function in these patients; this seems not to be so with total enteral nutrition (TEN). However, prospective trials comparing the incidence of liver function test (LFT) abnormalities with either TPN or TEN have not been carried out. Twenty-nine IBD inpatients with normal LFT, randomized to receive either TEN with a polymeric diet or isocaloric, isonitrogenous "all-in-one" TPN because of protein-energy malnutrition and/or severe disease, were included in the study. Sixteen patients (five with ulcerative colitis and 11 with Crohn's disease) received TEN, and 13 patients (eight ulcerative colitis and five Crohn's disease) were on TPN. All patients were on systemic steroids, and nine of them were on oral metronidazole. Both groups were homogeneous regarding age, sex, diagnosis, disease activity, nutritional status, daily nutrient supply, and days on artificial nutrition. Serum albumin levels significantly increased with TEN (32 +/- 1 to 38.2 +/- 1.6 g/liter, p less than 0.01), but not with TPN (32.1 +/- 2.2 to 33.9 +/- 1.4 g/liter, NS). Clinical improvement occurred in both groups of patients as shown by the change in the disease activity indexes. In all cases, measurements of serum alkaline phosphatase, serum bilirubin, aspartate aminotransferase, alanine aminotransferase, and gamma-glutamyltransferase were performed weekly. There were no significant differences in the initial LFT between both groups. 
Superoxide dismutase in psoriasis, squamous cell carcinoma and basal cell epithelioma: an immunohistochemical study. Monoclonal antibodies against human Cu,Zn-superoxide dismutase (SOD) and Mn-SOD were used to stain frozen sections of normal and abnormal human skin. In normal human epidermis, the Cu,Zn-SOD antibody almost exclusively stained the basal cells. Mn-SOD antibody weakly stained the whole of the epidermis but more predominantly the basal cell layer. In psoriasis, Cu,Zn-SOD antibody mainly stained the basal cells of the lowest parts of the elongated rete ridges. Basal cells corresponding to the tip of the dermal papillae were weakly stained. Mn-SOD staining was considerably decreased in the psoriatic epidermis. In squamous cell carcinoma, staining with both Cu,Zn-SOD and Mn-SOD antibodies was decreased, and single cells positive for Cu,Zn-SOD were scattered throughout the tumour nests. In basal cell epithelioma, Cu,Zn-SOD staining was intense and diffusely distributed throughout the tumour nests, while Mn-SOD staining was absent. 
Time trends in incidence rates of acute, non-traumatic extremity ischaemia: a population-based study during a 19-year period. Time trends in the occurrence of acute limb ischaemia were studied from 1965 to 1983 in a defined geographical area in Sweden. Data were obtained from a computerized register which covers all instances of inpatient care for a population of 1.3 million. Analysis based on 5394 first admissions for acute arterial occlusion revealed that the annual number increased by 2.7 per cent yearly in women and 3.9 per cent in men whereas the age-adjusted incidence remained stable for women and increased by 2.6 per cent yearly for men. A study of 1189 patients who underwent surgical procedures showed that the annual number of embolectomy procedures increased 7.6 per cent for females and 8.6 per cent for males. The corresponding age-adjusted incidence rose annually by 3.0 per cent for women and by 7.5 per cent for men. The introduction of the Fogarty catheter and an increasing interest in vascular surgery may have contributed to the increasing rates of operations during the period of study. 
Trypanosoma cruzi: a carbohydrate epitope defined by a monoclonal antibody as a possible marker of the acute phase of human Chagas' disease. An IgM monoclonal antibody (MAb) against a carbohydrate epitope present in Trypanosoma cruzi trypomastigote excretory-secretory antigens and expressed by different developmental stages of the parasite (epimastigote, trypomastigote and intracellular amastigote) was linked to a solid phase matrix and used as an antigen-capture antibody. Human serum complexes containing the epitope were then detected by using specific secondary antibodies against human immunoglobulin isotypes. Results of detection of IgM, IgG, and IgA serum complexes (SC) containing a T. cruzi polypeptide epitope showed that SC could be detected in 69% of the 13 Chagasic acute phase sera studied with IgG, in 84% with IgM, and in 75% with IgA. Only 16% (IgG-SC), 8% (IgM-SC), and 10% (IgA-SC) of chronic sera from 50 patients were positive. No patients with toxoplasmosis or rheumatoid factor were positive. Of the 11 leishmaniasis sera studied, four had IgG-SC, two had IgA-SC, and five had IgM-SC. Of the eight Yanomamo Indians infected by Onchocerca volvulus, three were found to have IgG-SC, two had IgM-SC, and two had IgA-SC. Thirteen sera from healthy individuals living in an endemic area were also studied. One subject had IgG IgM and IgA-SC. The results presented in this study show for the first time, the specific detection of IgM, IgG, and IgA immune complexes using a MAb against T. cruzi. The presence of the epitope in association with IgM antibodies in sera from patients with the acute phase of the disease suggests that this antigen(s) carrying the epitope that reacts with the MAb could be a marker(s) of active infection. In addition, the specificity of the serum complex capture assay allowed the detection of Chagas' disease in two different endemic areas (Argentina and Venezuela). 
Primary tracheojejunal shunt operation for voice restoration following pharyngolaryngoesophagectomy. A primary tracheojejunal shunt operation was performed for voice restoration following pharyngolaryngoesophagectomy with free jejunum reconstruction for advanced hypopharyngeal cancer. A fistula was created between the membranous part of the trachea and the lower part of the transplanted jejunum. The membranous part of the trachea was tubed to construct the tracheojejunal shunt. All three patients who had the tracheojejunal shunt operation retained phonatory function. Pitch formation was seen in the voice waveform with use of the tracheojejunal shunt. No leakage was seen at all during deglutition and a swallowing function was obtained in all patients who had the tracheojejunal shunt. 
Late potentials are unaltered by ventricular filling pressure reduction in heart failure. Exacerbation of heart failure may increase susceptibility to arrhythmias. Therefore tests to assess the risk of arrhythmia, performed after hemodynamic improvement, may be of limited value. To determine whether hemodynamic improvement alters ventricular late potentials detected by signal-averaged ECG, we studied 27 consecutive patients with dilated heart failure (left ventricular ejection fraction 0.20 +/- 0.06, 15 with coronary artery disease) before and 3 +/- 2 days after tailored vasodilator and diuretic therapy reduced ventricular filling pressures. QRS duration, terminal QRS amplitude (root mean square [RMS]), and low-amplitude (less than 40 microV) signal (LAS) duration were determined by an automated algorithm from the vector magnitude of the QRS high-pass filtered at 25 Hz and at 40 Hz. Despite marked decreases in pulmonary capillary wedge (27 +/- 7 to 16 +/- 5 mm Hg, p less than 0.001) and right atrial (13 +/- 7 to 7 +/- 4 mm Hg, p less than 0.001) pressures and a 20% increase in cardiac output, there was not a significant change in QRS duration, RMS, or LAS. Before and after therapy late potentials, defined as abnormal QRS duration RMS, or LAS, were present in 14 (52%) patients with filtering at 25 Hz and in 22 (81%) patients with filtering at 40 Hz. The signal-averaged ECG after hemodynamic improvement predicted the results during exacerbation of heart failure in all patients. Thus in patients with advanced heart failure the signal-averaged ECG obtained after hemodynamic improvement reflects the findings during exacerbation of heart failure. 
A novel cyclin encoded by a bcl1-linked candidate oncogene We have previously identified a candidate oncogene (PRAD1 or D11S287E) on chromosome 11q13 which is clonally rearranged with the parathyroid hormone locus in a subset of benign parathyroid tumours. We now report that a cloned human placental PRAD1 complementary DNA encodes a protein of 295 amino acids with sequence similarities to the cyclins. Cyclins can form a complex with and activate p34cdc2 protein kinase, thereby regulating progress through the cell cycle. PRAD 1 messenger RNA levels vary dramatically across the cell cycle in HeLa cells. Addition of the PRAD1 protein to interphase clam embryo lysates containing inactive p34cdc2 kinase and lacking endogenous cyclins allows it to be isolated using beads bearing p13suc1, a yeast protein that binds cdc2 and related kinases with high affinity and coprecipitates kinase-associated proteins. Addition of PRAD1 also induces phosphorylation of histone H1, a preferred substrate of cdc2. These data suggest that PRAD1 encodes a novel cyclin whose overexpression may play an important part in the development of various tumours with abnormalities in 11q13. 
Use of the perforated balloon catheter to infuse marker substances into diseased coronary artery walls after experimental postmortem angioplasty. A perforated balloon catheter was used in human coronary arteries after postmortem angioplasty had been performed. The catheter used has a standard angioplasty balloon with a pattern of laser-produced holes, 25 microns in size, which generate streams of fluid under pressure. Studies of the routes by which marker substances enter diseased arterial tissue when infused by the perforated balloon after experimental angioplasty are described. A colored marker dye entered the new crevices and dissection planes created by the angioplasty, but did not extend greater than 2 cm either proximal or distal to the perfused segment. Horseradish peroxidase entered tissue not only from the lumen and adventitia as occurs with its infusion into normal tissue with the perforated balloon, but also extended from new crevices and dissection planes created by the angioplasty. Platelet aggregation, coagulation and cell proliferation, the likely causes of restenosis after angioplasty, originate in the sites of greatest tissue disruption and blood stasis. These postmortem studies suggest that active drugs are delivered to the arterial wall in a manner likely to be effective in preventing these events. 
Acquired Brown's syndrome associated with hypogammaglobulinemia. We describe a 10-year-old girl with hypogammaglobulinemia who presented initially with painless progressive diplopia on right upward gaze and associated tenderness in the area of the superior oblique tendon (Brown's syndrome). She was given prednisone (40 mg/day) with gradual improvement of her symptoms. Prednisone was tapered and her symptoms remained unchanged for 10 months. She then experienced rapid deterioration. Prednisone was reinstituted with similar improvement and then therapy was switched to naproxen. She remains with only slight diplopia on extreme upward gaze. 
Improving results in the treatment of gastric cancer: an 11-year audit. Of 280 patients presenting to one hospital with gastric cancer between 1975 and 1985, 97 (35 per cent) did not undergo surgery and 29 per cent (54 out of 183) of those who did had no resection performed. The 30-day operative mortality rate in the study period was 15 per cent (28 out of 183) but in the subsequent 4-year period this fell to 7 per cent (5 out of 69). The survival rate correlated significantly with depth of invasion but not with tumour site or degree of differentiation. The incidence of early gastric cancer in this series was 5 per cent but the 5-year survival rate in this group was 52 per cent suggesting that the true incidence might be even lower. The overall 5-year survival rate in our area 20 years ago was only 5.2 per cent but in this series it was 11 per cent overall and 24 per cent after resection, and with actuarial correction 15 per cent overall and 28 per cent after resection. The continuing improvement in operative mortality rates and in 5-year survival rates gives grounds for optimism, but the disease must be diagnosed earlier if this improvement in outlook is to continue. 
gamma-Hydroxybutyrate: a health-food product producing coma and seizurelike activity. Sixteen cases of adverse effects due to a new health-food product, gamma-hydroxybutyrate (GHB), were reported to the San Francisco Bay Area Regional Poison Control Center in the 5-month period from June to October 1990. Cases have also been reported in eight other states. Adverse effects included coma (four patients) and tonic-clonic seizurelike activity (two patients). Doses ranged from 1/4 teaspoon to 4 tablespoons. Acute symptoms resolved within 7 hours. GHB was investigated as an anesthetic agent during the 1960s until seizures and lack of analgesia precluded its use. It was recently introduced in the health-food market as a food supplement for body builders with claims of anabolic effects by stimulating growth hormone release. GHB remains under investigational new drug status with the Food and Drug Administration and is illegal for over the counter sale. The Food and Drug Branch of the California Department of Health Services has prohibited further sale of this product in California as have health departments in Florida and South Carolina; however, new cases continue to be reported. Health professionals should be aware of the potential health hazards of GHB. 
Constitutive expression of multiple growth factor genes by melanoma cells but not normal melanocytes. In a panel of metastatic melanoma cell lines we found steady-state mRNA transcripts for multiple growth factors including basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF), platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF)-A, PDGF-B, transforming growth factor (TGF)- beta 1, TGF- alpha, melanoma growth-stimulating activity (MGSA), interleukin (IL)-1 alpha, and IL-1 beta but not insulin-like growth factor (IGF)-1 or IGF-2. Expression of growth factor genes was constitutive because prior to RNA extraction melanoma cells were maintained in a chemically defined culture medium free of exogenous growth factors. Each of four cell lines had an individual pattern of expression of either two, four, five, or seven growth factors; however, all cell lines shared expression of the bFGF gene. Two strains of normal melanocytes expressed TGF- beta 1 but not bFGF, PDGF, TGF- alpha , or MGSA mRNA at detectable levels. We tested growth-modulatory effects of the growth factors most frequently expressed by melanoma cells (bFGF, TGF- alpha, TGF- beta, PDGF). None of these stimulated melanoma cell growth consistently, whereas exogenous, acid-activated TGF- beta inhibited melanoma growth at concentrations greater than 10 ng/ml, suggesting that bioactive TGF- beta may represent a physiologic growth inhibitor. Neither neutralizing antisera to PDGF or TGF- alpha nor a monoclonal antibody to the epidermal growth factor (EGF)-receptor inhibited melanoma cell growth. Our results indicate that multiple growth factors are expressed simultaneously and constitutively by melanoma cells but not normal melanocytes in culture. Expression of bFGF is a common feature underscoring the significance of bFGF as an autocrine factor for melanoma cells as described earlier. Secreted PDGF and TGF- alpha are apparently not involved in or not essential for autocrine growth stimulation of melanoma cells. 
Events in the Cardiac Arrhythmia Suppression Trial (CAST): mortality in the entire population enrolled [published erratum appears in J Am Coll Cardiol 1991 Sep;18(3):888] To test the hypothesis that suppression of ventricular arrhythmias by antiarrhythmic drugs after myocardial infarction improves survival, the Cardiac Arrhythmia Suppression Trial (CAST) was initiated. Suppression was evaluated before randomization during an open label titration period. Patients whose arrhythmias were suppressed were randomized in the main study and those whose arrhythmias were partially suppressed were randomized in a substudy. Overall survival and survival free of arrhythmic death or cardiac arrest were lower [corrected] in patients treated with encainide or flecainide than in patients treated with placebo. However, the death rate in patients randomized to placebo therapy was lower than expected. This report describes the survival experience of all patients enrolled in CAST and compares it with mortality in other studies of patients with ventricular arrhythmias after myocardial infarction. As of April 18, 1989, 2,371 patients had enrolled in CAST and entered prerandomization, open label titration: 1,913 (81%) were randomized to double-blind, placebo-controlled therapy (1,775 patients whose arrhythmias were suppressed and 138 patients whose arrhythmias were partially suppressed during open label titration); and 458 patients (19%) were not randomized because they were still in titration, had died during titration or had withdrawn. Including all patients who enrolled in CAST, the actuarial (Kaplan-Meier) estimate of 1-year mortality was 10.3%. To estimate the "natural" mortality rate of patients enrolled in CAST, an analysis was done that adjusted for deaths that might be attributable to encainide or flecainide treatment either during prerandomization, open label drug titration or after randomization. Because the censoring procedure excluded patients treated with encainide or flecainide after randomization, the mortality estimate will be less than the unadjusted mortality estimate of 10.3%. 
Left-sided pleural effusion secondary to splenic vein thrombosis. A previously unrecognized relationship. The association of left-sided pleural effusion and subcapsular splenic hematoma was reported in 1980. We describe a patient in whom a left-sided pleural effusion resulted from splenic vein thrombosis, a relationship not previously reported. Splenectomy was performed, demonstrating the spleen to be enlarged and hemorrhagic. The pleural effusion did not recur after splenectomy. The three effusions due to splenic hematomas reported previously cleared only after splenectomy, suggesting splenectomy may be necessary to prevent reaccumulation. We propose possible pathophysiologic mechanisms and recommend that splenic vein thrombosis be considered in the differential diagnosis of unexplained left-sided pleural effusions. 
Adrenal carcinoma presenting as a lesion resembling cutaneous angiosarcoma. A case is reported of adrenal carcinoma presenting as an angiosarcoma-like metastasis in the scalp. Adrenal carcinoma is a rare tumor, and it metastasizes to skin rarely. The authors discuss the features of this tumor that led to a diagnosis of angiosarcoma and the means by which such a metastasis may be distinguished from vascular tumors. 
Outcome of patients who were admitted to a new short-stay unit to "rule-out" myocardial infarction. For emergency room patients with a low probability of acute myocardial infarction, we established a new short-stay coronary observation unit, a 2-bed nonintensive care unit with telemetry monitoring adjacent to the emergency room. Of 512 consecutive admissions to the coronary observation unit, 425 (83%) were discharged home without evidence of acute myocardial infarction or serious complications (mean length of stay, 1.2 days; median length of stay, 1 day); 87 (17%) were transferred to other hospital beds. The rate of acute myocardial infarction was 3%. No deaths and only 1 serious complication occurred in the coronary observation unit. At 6 month follow-up, the cardiac survival rate was 99% for patients sent home directly from this unit. It is concluded that the coronary observation unit is safe and adequate for ruling out acute myocardial infarction in a defined subset of patients. Short-stay units, however, encourage early discharges which, when premature, may miss patients who are at risk of having complications shortly thereafter. Strategies such as mandatory but expeditious predischarge stress testing to encourage early but not premature discharge may augment the efficiency of coronary observation units. 
Necrotizing fasciitis and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. We have presented a case of fulminant necrotizing fasciitis that occurred after excessive NSAID intake with granulocytopenia. This case parallels those previously reported as outlined in the above discussion. We concur with previous investigators who have concluded that NSAIDs should be used with caution in patients with phlebitis or apparently benign inflammatory cutaneous lesions. 
Preservation of pulsatile luteinizing hormone release during postpartum lactational amenorrhea. To evaluate the pulsatile mode of immunoactive LH release during physiological lactational amenorrhea, we withdrew blood samples at 10-min intervals for 24 h from breastfeeding women (n = 9) at both 3 weeks and 3 months postpartum. Nonlactating women (n = 7) were sampled similarly in the early follicular phase of the normal menstrual cycle. Objective LH pulse analysis revealed that the mean frequencies of pulsatile LH release were similar at both times postpartum and in menstruating young women. By 3 months postpartum, mean serum PRL concentrations had declined 50%, and serum LH peak areas doubled. In contrast, LH interpulse interval, peak duration, and maximal, incremental, and fractional LH pulse amplitude did not change significantly. When deconvolution analysis was used to assess pituitary responses to two pulses of exogenous GnRH at 3 months (vs. 3 weeks) postpartum, we found significant increases in maximal LH secretory rates and the total mass of LH secreted. There was no change in the duration or timing of the evoked LH secretory burst and/or the estimated half-life of endogenous LH. In summary, during lactational amenorrhea, pulsatile LH release occurs at a mean frequency no different from that in the normal early follicular phase. As hyperprolactinemia wanes, there is increased pituitary responsiveness to exogenously administered GnRH and a doubling of spontaneous serum LH concentration peak areas. Such amplitude changes are consistent with the hypothesis of increased endogenous GnRH drive (e.g. augmented GnRH secretion per burst and/or increased pituitary responsiveness to available GnRH) during recovery of the postpartum hypothalamopituitary-ovarian axis. 
Rapid changes of atrial natriuretic peptide concentration during percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty. In 34 patients undergoing routine coronary angioplasty, concentrations of atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP), plasma renin (PR), and plasma aldosterone (PA) were estimated before, during, and after vessel occlusion and were correlated with hemodynamic changes. For the group as a whole, averaged right atrial pressure rose significantly (p less than 0.001) from 4.4 +/- 1.8 mm Hg at baseline to 6.7 +/- 3.0 mm Hg during vessel occlusion, and average right atrial ANP concentrations increased significantly (p less than 0.005) from 50.1 +/- 18.8 pg/ml to 59.7 +/- 21.4 pg/ml during balloon inflation. Data analysis of subgroups did not show any differences in right atrial pressure elevations between patients with left anterior descending artery (LAD) or right coronary artery (RCA) disease; ANP elevation was significant only in patients with LAD occlusion (p less than 0.001). In individual patients no statistically significant correlations were found to be present between changes in right atrial pressures and changes in atrial ANP concentrations. During vessel occlusion, PR dropped from 0.86 +/- 1.11 ng/ml/hr to 0.65 +/- 0.85 ng/ml/hr (p less than 0.001) in all patients, and PA decreased from 63.0 +/- 50.9 ng/ml to 52.2 +/- 43.4 ng/ml (p less than 0.01). Our data support the concept that, although an increase in right atrial pressure leads to ANP release in the majority of patients, atrial pressure and stretch are not the only regulatory factors of ANP release in humans. 
Primary ankylosing spondylitis, psoriatic and enteropathic spondyloarthropathy: a controlled analysis. Within our ankylosing spondylitis (AS) population (n = 1331), 85% (n = 1128) had primary AS (1 degree AS), 9% (n = 121) had psoriatic AS (PsAS) and 6% (n = 82) enteropathic AS (IBDAS). In an attempt to explore further the relationship between 1 degree AS and the secondary spondyloarthritides, we evaluated 121 consecutive patients with PsAS and 82 with IBDAS, as well as 202 controls with primary disease. The patients were matched for sex and age at review PsAS:48.1 (SD 11.3) years vs 1 degree AS:48.4 (SD 11.5), and IBDAS:46.0 (SD 12.7) vs 1 degree AS:45.9 (SD 12.7). The sex distribution for IBDAS (M:F, 1:1), was significantly less (p less than 0.001) than that for PsAS (M:F, 3.5:1) or 1 degree AS (M:F, 2.4:1). Overall, compared to 1 degree AS the PsAS and IBDAS tended to have greater disease severity as defined by e.g., (1) those taking non-steroidal antiinflammatory drugs, 86 vs 72% (p less than 0.01) and 71 vs 60% (p less than 0.05), respectively; (2) decreased spinal mobility (scale 0-8) 5.0 (SD 2.0) vs 4.4 (SD 2.3); p = 0.029 and 4.9 (SD 2.0) vs 3.9 (SD 2.4); p = 0.024, respectively; and (3) PsAS resulted in a higher AIMS pain score; 4.9 (SD 2.5) vs 4.0 (SD 2.4): p = 0.042. By contrast, peripheral joint involvement, number of total hip replacements and capacity for employment were similar in all 3 groups. In conclusion (1) among the AS population the prevalence of 1 degree AS, PsAS and IBDAS is 90, 6 and 4%, respectively. 
Chronic wounds and delusions of parasitosis in the drug abuser. Plastic surgeons are routinely consulted about the care of difficult or chronic wounds. Most of these wounds have a physiologic basis and are treated according to basic wound-healing principles. Patients with factitious wounds are difficult to treat and present diagnostic dilemmas. We present a case and review of the literature of drug-induced delusions of parasitosis to inform plastic surgeons of this important entity and for consideration in the differential diagnosis of chronic wounds. 
Usefulness of transesophageal echocardiography in the diagnosis of conditions mimicking aortic dissection. Between September 1987 and April 1989, forty patients suspected to have aortic dissection were evaluated by transesophageal echocardiography. Aortic dissection was identified in 18 patients. This study evaluated the ability of transesophageal echocardiography in the assessment of the 22 patients in whom aortic dissection was not found. A range of pathologic conditions was diagnosed in these patients. Five patients had ischemic heart disease when they were initially seen. Among the remaining 17 only one patient had a normal aorta. Aortic disease was present in the other 16 patients with aortic dilatation in 10. Atheromas were detected in seven patients with concomitant aortic dilatation in five of them. An extrinsic aortic mass was present in two patients. Transesophageal echocardiography correctly identified an anastomotic leak at the site of left coronary artery implantation in a patient with a recent Bentall procedure, and a large mobile clot within the proximal descending aorta in a patient with blunt chest trauma. These findings obviated the need for other tests in 15 patients and led to surgery in four with no ancillary tests performed in three of them. Thus transesophageal echocardiography has an important role in assessing patients with suspected dissection. Aortic disease is common even in patients in whom aortic dissection is excluded, and some of the conditions can be just as life-threatening as dissection. Transesophageal echocardiography not only reliably identifies dissection but can also detect luminal and extraluminal diseases not adequately visualized by other modalities. 
Tegmental dehiscence and brain herniation into the middle ear cleft. The tegmen tympani may occasionally be breached by herniation of the temporal lobe with or without dural cover. The clinical presentation may be obvious with CSF otorrhoea but less so with apparent middle ear effusion, CSF rhinnorrhoea, conductive hearing loss, recurrent meningitis or intracranial sepsis. Diagnosis requires suspicion of the condition, which may be aided by radiological imaging. Surgical repair is to be recommended: various techniques are available but bone enveloped by fascia placed by subtemporal approach is preferred. The features of this problem are highlighted by four cases. 
Prospective evaluation of unilateral adrenal masses in patients with operable non-small-cell lung cancer. Although adrenal metastases are frequently noted with non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) at autopsy, their incidence in patients with operable NSCLC is unclear. We prospectively assessed consecutive patients with otherwise operable NSCLC for the incidence and histology of unilateral adrenal masses. Assessment included blood chemistries, lung function tests, bronchoscopy, chest x-ray, bone scan, and computed tomography (CT) of the head, chest, and upper abdomen. Of 246 patients with otherwise operable NSCLC, 10 (4.1%) had a unilateral adrenal mass. Unilateral adrenal masses were needle-aspirated under CT control. If cytology was nondiagnostic, adrenalectomy was performed. Four (40%) of 10 patients had adrenal metastases proven by needle aspiration. Of the six (60%) patients with benign unilateral adrenal masses, one was demonstrated by needle aspiration. In the other five patients, a nondiagnostic needle aspiration led to adrenalectomy, which yielded two adenomas, two hyperplastic nodules, and one hemorrhagic cyst. There was no significant difference between the patients with benign and metastatic unilateral adrenal masses with respect to patient age or stage and size of adrenal mass. Patients with benign unilateral adrenal masses underwent curative resection of their NSCLC and had significantly prolonged survival compared with patients with metastatic unilateral adrenal masses treated with chemotherapy (P = .037). Median survival of patients with benign and metastatic unilateral adrenal masses was greater than 30 months and 9 months, respectively. In conclusion, the presence of unilateral adrenal masses in patients with otherwise operable NSCLC should not preclude thoracotomy without pathologic proof of metastatic disease. 
Palliation of malignant tracheal strictures using silicone T tubes. The use of silicone T tubes for intubation of malignant tracheobronchial strictures may provide some degree of palliation of this distressing condition. It was used in seven patients with malignant lesions and two with benign strictures (resulting from tracheal trauma and lung transplantation). Four patients (two with cancer) are still alive and well with the tube in position. All patients noted improvement in dyspnoea and stridor. The main problems were tube migration (one patient), tracheo-oesophageal fistula (one patient), and blockage of the tube by tumour (two patients) or encrusted secretions (three patients). Airway patency was restored when the tube was blocked by cleaning or by laser resection of the tumour. With careful supervision and education of the patient intubation can give useful palliation to patients with distressing upper airways obstruction. 
Self-referred mammography patients: analysis of patients' characteristics. Among mammography patients, a small but growing group of highly motivated women refer themselves directly for screening without the suggestion of their physicians. We surveyed 485 patients during a 3-month period to study how self-referred mammography patients differ from physician-referred patients. Self-referred patients were more likely than physician-referred patients to have a family income of more than $30,000 per year, to be college graduates, and to consider their health as good or excellent. A large percentage of self-referred patients performed other health-promoting practices, but were not significantly more likely to do these than were physician-referred patients. Women who referred themselves were more likely to have a friend with breast cancer and to believe that cancer could be cured. They expressed much less worry about radiation exposure and were more likely to consider $50.00 an appropriate charge for a screening mammogram. By far, the greatest motivator for self-referred patients was health promotion and disease prevention. Self-referred mammography patients tend to be wealthier, more education, and less concerned about the cost and radiation dose of mammography when compared with physician-referred mammography patients. 
Genotypic analysis of diffuse, mixed cell lymphomas. Comparison with morphologic and immunophenotypic findings. Malignant lymphoma, diffuse, mixed small and large cell type, as defined in the Working Formulation, is heterogeneous both morphologically and immunophenotypically and, in some cases, clonality may be difficult to determine. Because gene rearrangement analysis has been shown to be a sensitive method for determining clonality, the authors genotyped 20 cases and compared the results with histologic and immunophenotypic findings. Immunophenotypic studies demonstrated that all lesions were composed predominantly of T cells. In addition, in eight cases either a monoclonal B-cell population (five lesions) or an aberrant immunophenotype (two T, one B) was detected, supporting a malignant diagnosis. In seven of these eight lymphomas, genotypic analysis confirmed the presence of a population of clonal cells. One case with an abnormal T-cell phenotype was germline. In 12 cases the immunophenotypic results were uncertain (i.e., no clonal population or abnormal immunophenotype was identified). Genotypic analysis provided evidence of clonality in eight. In four cases with uncertain immunophenotypic results, a clonal population also could not be identified with the use of Southern blot analysis. Thus, the authors conclude that gene rearrangement analysis is a valuable tool in the study of diffuse mixed cell lymphomas and is complementary to immunophenotypic studies. In addition, the authors analyzed the major breakpoint region of the bcl-2 protooncogene on chromosome 18, either by Southern blot analysis and/or with the polymerase chain reaction. The authors identified the t(14;18)(q32;q21) translocation in seven B-cell lymphomas, five of which were not considered to be of follicular center cell type on the basis of morphologic findings. These results suggest that the histologic spectrum of follicular center cell lymphomas is greater than is appreciated in the literature. 
Direct myocardial revascularization without extracorporeal circulation. Experience in 700 patients Between May 1978 and March 1990, 700 patients were operated on with direct coronary surgery without extracorporeal circulation (ECC): 529 (76 percent) were male and 171 (24 percent) were female. The average age was 64 years (range, 35 to 86 years), 454 (65 percent) had unstable angina, 163 (23 percent) had stable angina, 51 (7 percent) had postmyocardial infarction angina, and 32 (5 percent) had acute myocardial infarction at the moment of the operation. In this series of patients, all branches of the coronary arteries were bypassed; the mammary artery was used in 40 percent of the cases, the average bypass per patient was 2.2 (range, 1 to 5), and 26 percent had associated disease of high risk to undergo ECC. The morbidity was 4 percent and the mortality for this series of patients was 1 percent; the probability of survival at seven years was 90 percent. This experience shows us that this surgery is an alternative in the treatment of coronary disease, especially for aged patients with associated disease, in some cases of acute transmural infarction, and also for patients who need coronary angioplasty. Also, it can improve the relation cost/benefit in coronary surgery. 
Clues and pitfalls in stereotactic biopsy of the central nervous system. We present a 6-year experience on 307 stereotactic biopsy specimens of the central nervous system using Leksell's and Talairach's systems independently and either Leksell or Sedan needles. Patients with deep cerebral lesions (basal ganglia, parasellar, pineal, or third ventricle), those located in highly functional areas or those poorly defined on imaging studies, as well as candidates for brachytherapy, were selected. Smear examination during surgery was a routine procedure followed by conventional histologic methods. Ages ranged from 8 months to 81 years (mean, 33.64 years). The series comprised 258 tumors, 28 nonneoplastic cases, and 21 nondiagnostic samples. Of the 258 tumors, 179 were supratentorial, 28 were infratentorial, 36 were of the pineal area, and 15 were from sellar and suprasellar regions. Results of the histologic examination showed the following: astrocytic tumors, 148 (57.36%); oligodendroglial, 25 (9.68%); ependymal, six (2.32%); primitive neuroectodermal tumors, 17, including 14 pineoblastomas (5.45%) and three medulloblastomas (1.16%), seven lymphomas (2.71%), seven meningiomas (2.71%), four schwannomas (1.55%), eight craniopharyngiomas (3.10%), 12 germinomas (4.65%), and 20 metastases (7.78%). Nontumoral cases included six arteriovenous malformations, six pyogenic lesions, seven infarcts, two hematomas, one multiple sclerosis plaque, one Fahr, one progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy, one tuberculosis, one cysticercosis, and one Chagas' encephalitis. Awareness of the cerebellar granular layer in infratentorial targets as well as glial reaction around craniopharyngiomas is essential to avoid misdiagnosis. Difficulties were basically differential diagnosis between well-differentiated astrocytomas vs glial reaction, as well as poorly differentiated neoplasms vs metastases. 
Functional results after total or near total glossectomy with laryngeal preservation. Locally advanced tongue cancer is a devastating disease for which there are limited therapeutic options that will result in a high rate of cure while preserving function. To determine the oncologic effectiveness of total or near total glossectomy with laryngeal preservation and the possibility of speech and swallowing rehabilitation following treatment, we reviewed our experience with 27 patients treated between 1982 and 1989. Twenty-four patients were eligible for 2-year follow-up and their disease-specific survival was 51%. Swallowing was achieved initially in 18 patients (67%), while 12 had successful long-term deglutition (44%). Oral communication was accomplished in 25 patients (92%). Significant aspiration occurred in three patients and was severe enough to require interval laryngectomy in two patients. The role of laryngeal suspension, palatal augmentation prosthesis, and videofluoroscopy as rehabilitation adjuncts for the total glossectomy patient are described. 
Effect of primary-stage feline immunodeficiency virus infection on subsequent feline calicivirus vaccination and challenge in cats. The effect of experimental primary-stage feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV) infection on feline calicivirus (FCV) vaccination and challenge in cats was studied. Clinical signs of acute FCV disease were more widespread in the cats which were infected with FIV than in those which were not. FIV infection also prolonged shedding of FCV, with more of the FIV-infected cats becoming chronic carriers. Although vaccination induced protection against acute FCV disease, this was to a lesser degree in FIV-infected cats. Vaccination by itself also appeared to enhance long-term virus shedding. There was evidence of an impaired anamnestic FCV-neutralizing antibody response in FIV-infected cats following FCV challenge. 
Congenital atresia of left main coronary artery: proposed mechanism for severe disabling angina in a patient with non-atherosclerotic single right coronary artery--a case report. A patient with progressive disabling angina was found to have a single right coronary artery with atresia of the left main coronary artery, and absence of any obstructive coronary disease. The patient required aortocoronary by-pass surgical reconstruction of a left main coronary artery to control her angina. Possible mechanisms for the development of her anginal pain are briefly discussed. 
Clinical effects of allopurinol on intractable epilepsy. We studied the clinical efficacy of allopurinol as add-on therapy in 31 patients with intractable epilepsy. When administered for a short time, allopurinol was effective in 17 patients (55%); 8 were seizure-free, 8 had 75% decrease in seizure frequency, and 1 had greater than 50% decrease. Allopurinol was most effective in patients with localization-related epilepsy, especially in secondarily generalized tonic-clonic seizures. Allopurinol was not as effective in patients with Lennox syndrome or West syndrome, or in severe myoclonic epilepsy in infants. When allopurinol was administered greater than 1 year, its initial effectiveness continued in 8 of 14 patients who exhibited initial improvement. In 2 of the remaining 6 patients, the initial improvement disappeared during the course of treatment but control was regained by increasing the dosage of allopurinol. Mild side effects were observed in 4 patients (13%): drowsiness in 3 and abdominal pain in 1. Allopurinol may be a useful antiepileptic drug (AED), and a double-blind placebo-controlled trial should be performed. 
Coronary angiography after thrombolytic therapy for acute myocardial infarction. PURPOSE: To review the status of emergency, urgent, routine, and selective angiography after intravenous thrombolytic therapy. DATA SOURCES: Relevant English-language articles published from January 1985 to July 1990 were identified through MEDLINE. STUDY SELECTION: For emergency angiography, four major randomized studies were reviewed and data from nine studies that incorporated rescue coronary angioplasty were pooled for meta-analysis. For urgent angiography, two controlled trials were reviewed. Comparisons of routine and selective angiography were done using data from two dedicated, large-scale, controlled trials and the ancillary findings of four other studies of reperfusion that incorporated angiography. DATA EXTRACTION: The review emphasizes the findings from multicenter, randomized, controlled trials. DATA SYNTHESIS: Emergency coronary angiography is done primarily in preparation for primary or rescue angioplasty; the value of rescue angioplasty has yet to be assessed in a randomized trial, but technical success and reocclusion improve significantly after therapy with nonspecific plasminogen activators compared with relatively specific agents (success rate, 86% compared with 75%, respectively; P = 0.03; reocclusion rate, 10.9% compared with 26.8%, respectively; P less than 0.001). Urgent coronary angiography has value for treating recurrent ischemia, but patients who develop this complication after thrombolysis are likely to have a suboptimal outcome despite aggressive care. Studies support the use of either selective or routine angiography in uncomplicated patients after thrombolytic therapy; either approach is acceptable, but the former is more practical and may prove to be cost effective. CONCLUSIONS: Optimal follow-up for patients with evolving myocardial infarction who receive thrombolysis may incorporate coronary angiography at various stages. Although our ability to noninvasively detect reperfusion, reocclusion, or viable but ischemic myocardium is limited at present, available data may assist in selecting a catheterization strategy. 
Imaging of vascular complications associated with renal transplants. Vascular complications associated with renal transplants are a significant cause of graft dysfunction. The most common complications are arterial and venous stenoses and thromboses and intrarenal and extrarenal arteriovenous fistulas and pseudoaneurysms. Although angiography is the imaging gold standard for the diagnosis of these disorders, Doppler sonography, scintigraphy, and occasionally CT are capable of detecting them. An awareness of the different imaging appearances of each complication will aid in their early detection and treatment. In this review, we present this information and provide a perspective on the relative roles of these techniques in the detection of vascular complications from renal transplants. 
Acquired immunodeficiency syndrome with disseminated toxoplasmosis presenting as an acute pulmonary and gastrointestinal illness. Encephalitis due to the protozoan Toxoplasma gondii has emerged as a common cause of central nervous system disease in patients with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome. Extraneural disease is less common and more difficult to diagnose. We report a case of widely disseminated toxoplasmosis that presented as acute gastrointestinal and pulmonary disease in a patient without a prior diagnosis of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome. The diagnosis of toxoplasmosis was made only at autopsy. Antemortem diagnosis of disseminated T gondii infection requires a high degree of clinical suspicion and the prompt utilization of appropriate diagnostic testing. Since toxoplasmosis is a potentially treatable opportunistic infection, diagnosis allows the swift institution of anti-Toxoplasma therapy. 
Randomized dose-searching phase ILE/II trials of fractionation in radiation therapy for cancer. This article describes a new design, phase ILE/II dose searching, used in four prospective, randomized, multicenter clinical trials of escalating total doses of hyperfractionated radiation. This design combines an experimental protocol with a statistical application of ranking and selection theory. Its purpose was to identify (within a certain margin of error) a dose that achieved the highest rate of clinical response from a set of doses that were tolerable in terms of both acute (within 90 days) and late (more than 90 days) toxic effects (LE). We calculated the number of patients required to reliably test toxicity under various assumptions. To determine the maximum tolerated total dose for hyperfractionated radiation, we randomly assigned patients with tumors that responded to radiation therapy in a dose-dependent manner from four body sites (lung, upper respiratory and digestive tract, bladder, and brain) to one of three regimens receiving total doses (D1, D2, or D3) differing by increments of 4.8 Gy. All patients received two fractions of 1.2 Gy each (separated by 4-6 hours) daily 5 days a week. The lowest total dose was set at the level considered tolerable with standard once-a-day radiation therapy. We tested tumor responses and late toxic effects of higher doses by assigning patients to these three regimens until acute effects and early estimates of late effects were found to be acceptable for the highest dose D3; thereafter, regimen D1 was closed, and additional patients were assigned to D2, D3, and D4 (an escalated total dose greater than D3 by an increment of 4.8 Gy). The assignment of patients was performed in a weighted manner (1:1:2), so that greater numbers were assigned to the highest dose regimen (whether D3 or D4) to allow rapid evaluation of the feasibility of the highest dose. 
Functional significance of an overlapping consensus binding motif for Sp1 and Zif268 in the murine adenosine deaminase gene promoter. The murine adenosine deaminase (ADA) gene has a (G + C)-rich promoter that can support diverse tissue-specific gene expression. By using deletion and mutation analyses, we have identified a cis-acting "repressor" element located immediately upstream of the proximal Sp1 binding site in the ADA gene promoter. This repressor element was localized to a binding site for the immediate-early, serum-responsive, DNA binding factor Zif268. This Zif268 binding site partially overlaps a binding site for the general transcription activator Sp1. Disruption of the Zif268 binding site without disturbing the Sp1 binding motif abolished Zif268 binding and resulted in significantly elevated promoter function. Conversely, disruption of the proximal consensus Sp1 binding motif without disturbing the Zif268 binding site resulted in a loss of Sp1 binding at that region and greatly reduced promoter activity. Our results suggest that one function of Zif268 may be to down-regulate this type of mammalian gene promoter by competing with Sp1 for binding to the overlapping binding motif. 
N-myc genomic content and DNA ploidy in stage IVS neuroblastoma. DNA ploidy and N-myc genomic content were analyzed in a series of stage IVS neuroblastomas by flow cytometry and Southern blot hybridization, respectively. Of the 12 stage IVS neuroblastomas studied, nine were aneuploid (DNA index [DI] greater than 1), two were diploid (DI = 1), and one was not assessable for DNA content due to insufficient tumor material. N-myc gene amplification was present in two of 12 tumors. None of the aneuploid tumors exhibited N-myc amplification. Among the aneuploid neuroblastomas, the DIs were between 1.27 and 1.60, ie, in the near-triploid range. The follow-up from diagnosis ranged from 1 to 41 months (mean, 20 months). The nine neuroblastomas with near-triploid DNA content were free of disease at the end of the follow-up period. In contrast, a rapid and fatal tumor progression was observed for the three neuroblastomas with N-myc amplification and/or diploidy. Although involving only a limited series, these results strongly suggest that the combined analysis of DNA ploidy and N-myc genomic content could predict clinical outcome in stage IVS neuroblastoma and should help to identify patients for whom a more aggressive therapy is required. 
Report of a hidden case of overfeeding. Nutritional support is essential to the care of the critically ill patient, but complications of overfeeding can occur. Precise metabolic measurement by indirect calorimetry can detect problems of nutrition and allow adjustment in caloric intake. This case study illustrates the complications of carbon dioxide retention and inability to wean from mechanical ventilation with subsequent prevention of further complications. 
Management of renal cell carcinoma with vena caval thrombi via cardiopulmonary bypass and deep hypothermic circulatory arrest. Cardiopulmonary bypass with deep hypothermic circulatory arrest allows safe and effective removal of renal tumors with extensive thrombi involving the vena cava under controlled circumstances without permanent side effects. The technique averts extensive dissection of the inferior vena cava and occlusion of major vessels while providing up to 60 minutes of safe operating time in a bloodless field and complete visibility of the interior of the vena cava. Adjunctive procedures for tumor excision or cardiac revascularization can be performed at the same time without increased operative risk. 
Melanosis coli: a case report in a trauma patient and review of the literature. Melanosis Coli (MC) is a benign pigmentation disorder of the colon occasionally diagnosed at endoscopy. The authors report a case of M. coli in a patient with a gunshot to the abdomen, in whom the entity produced an interesting clinical picture, and a review of the literature on this condition. 
Dental implants placed in a patient with multiple myeloma: report of case A 69-year-old male, under active treatment for multiple myeloma, fractured his left maxillary second premolar palatal abutment tooth and requested treatment because his upper partial denture no longer fit. Several other teeth were deemed hopeless, and construction of a maxillary complete denture presented problems. There are general contraindications regarding dental implant surgery in the terminally ill patient; however, in this case, the patient wished to maximize his quality of life and opted to undergo implant surgery. With close management, the treatment was successful. 
Effects of substance P on norepinephrine release from vascular adrenergic neurons in spontaneously hypertensive rats. This study was performed to investigate the role of substance P in the vascular adrenergic transmission in hypertension. In perfused mesenteric vasculatures prepared from spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR, 7 to 10 weeks old) and age-matched Wistar-Kyoto rats (WKY), we have examined the effects of substance P on vascular responsiveness as well as on norepinephrine release from the vascular adrenergic neurons. In preliminary studies with normotensive Wistar rats, pressor responses and endogenous norepinephrine release during electrical nerve stimulation were inhibited by substance P in a dose-dependent manner. However, vasoconstrictor responses to exogenous norepinephrine were not affected by the peptide. In SHR, the stimulation-evoked pressor responses and norepinephrine release were enhanced compared with WKY. Alternatively, the suppression of these responses by substance P was significantly less in SHR than in WKY. These results demonstrate that substance P could have a modulatory effect on noradrenergic activity and cause a decrease in stimulation-evoked norepinephrine release from the vascular adrenergic neurons. The attenuated reduction of pressor responses and norepinephrine release by substance P in SHR might suggest insufficient regulation of vascular adrenergic transmission by the peptide in hypertension. 
Control of acute lower respiratory illness in the developing world: an assessment of vaccine intervention. The major bacterial and viral causes of morbidity and death due to acute lower respiratory infection (ALRI) in the developing world are amenable to control by vaccines. Initially, full use of measles, pertussis, and diphtheria vaccines, in appropriately scheduled programs, can make an immediate contribution to the reduction of severe respiratory infection. Emerging technologies offer the promise of vaccines against bacterial and viral respiratory pathogens that are suitable for infants and children in developing countries. These technologic advances include the use of protein-polysaccharide conjugates of endemic serotypes for Haemophilus influenzae and Streptococcus pneumoniae vaccines and new approaches to the use of purified protein components or attenuated live virus with respiratory syncytial virus and paramyxovirus vaccines. Such vaccines should soon be available for evaluation in developing countries. It is timely to embark upon a program of development, evaluation, and worldwide deployment of vaccines for the control of ALRI. 
Electrophysiological effects of left ventricular hypertrophy. Effect of calcium and potassium channel blockade. BACKGROUND. To define the arrhythmogenic effects of left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) in the intact heart, we carried out a detailed electrophysiological assessment in our previously validated feline aortic-banding model and then tested the effects of agents that blocked either the slow inward calcium or voltage-dependent potassium channel. METHODS AND RESULTS. We measured intraventricular and interventricular conduction times, excitability thresholds, ventricular effective refractory periods, and monophasic action potential duration at several sites in cats with LVH as well as in concurrent control (sham-operated) cats. In addition, we assessed vulnerability to ventricular arrhythmia using direct measurement of ventricular fibrillation (VF) thresholds and by standard techniques of programmed stimulation. Despite finding no difference between LVH and sham-operated cats in mean values for several electrophysiological parameters, the former group was significantly more vulnerable to VF, with more spontaneous VF and lower VF thresholds. Compared with the sham controls, LVH cats also had a greater dispersion of effective refractory period (35 +/- 11 versus 12 +/- 4 msec, p less than 0.01) and monophasic action potential duration at 90% repolarization (69 +/- 25 versus 39 +/- 7 msec, p less than 0.02). Verapamil had no significant effect on these electrophysiological parameters, nor did it affect VF threshold. However, risotilide, an inhibitor of the voltage-dependent potassium channel, narrowed dispersion of the effective refractory period and monophasic action potential duration concomitant with a marked reduction in ventricular vulnerability. CONCLUSIONS. LVH has a pronounced effect on dispersion of refractoriness and repolarization and renders the ventricle more vulnerable to fibrillation. Blockade of the voltage-dependent potassium channel, but not the slow inward calcium channel, narrows the dispersion of recovery of excitability and protects against VF. 
Antihypertensive effects of isradipine and captopril as monotherapy or in combination. The antihypertensive effects of isradipine and captopril were studied in 140 patients (70 men) with mild-to-moderate hypertension, aged 26 to 74 years, in a double-blind, randomized, between-patient comparative trial. Initial treatment started with 1.25 mg isradipine twice daily or 12.5 mg captopril twice daily. If normotension was not achieved after four weeks, doses were increased to 2.5 mg twice daily or 25 mg twice daily, respectively. If the maximum dose as monotherapy did not result in normotension, captopril (12.5 mg or, if necessary, 25 mg twice daily) was added to regimens of the isradipine-treated patients or isradipine (1.25 mg or, if necessary, 2.5 mg twice daily) was given in addition to the captopril-treated patients. After 24 weeks of active treatment, systolic blood pressure was significantly reduced (P less than .001) with isradipine (from 168 +/- 18 to 144 +/- 14 mm Hg) and with captopril (from 168 +/- 20 to 143 +/- 10 mm Hg). Diastolic blood pressure also fell significantly (P less than .001) in both groups (isradipine: from 105 +/- 5 to 84 +/- 5 mm Hg; captopril; from 105 +/- 4 to 85 +/- 4 mm Hg). With isradipine as monotherapy, diastolic blood pressure was normalized in 49% of patients compared with 56% with captopril as monotherapy (P = NS). Combining both drugs resulted in an increased rate of normalization (to 87%). The results indicate that combined treatment with a calcium antagonist and an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor is effective in lowering blood pressure and is well tolerated during long-term therapy. 
Compensatory hypertrophy and adaptation in the cortical collecting duct. The cortical collecting duct (CCD) undergoes hypertrophy and functional adaptation following reduction of renal mass. The nature and mechanisms of these changes have been investigated using microperfusion of isolated CCD from rabbit remnant kidneys. By 1 week after reduction of renal mass, tubule hypertrophy and increased sodium transport are fully developed. The transport adaptations are specific or selective, since bicarbonate transport in these CCD is unchanged. Mineralocorticoids may play an important role in the hypertrophy and increased sodium transport, since plasma aldosterone increases early after reduction of renal mass. Also, adrenalectomy abolishes the changes in size and sodium transport, even with supplementation of aldosterone to unstressed physiologic levels. Epidermal growth factor also has immediate effects on CCD sodium transport; however, the direction of the effect is opposite--an inhibition of transport. 
Perilymph fistula--a diagnostic dilemma. A retrospective series is presented of 51 cases operated on for suspected perilymph fistula. In 26 ears a fistula was identified at surgery. A positive fistula test was found to strongly indicate a perilymph fistula but was more often negative than positive in surgically demonstrated fistula ears. Other vestibular tests were found to be of little value in the pre-operative diagnosis. Ears with a surgically demonstrated fistula and sensorineural hearing loss had either flat or downward-sloping audiograms. Difficulties in diagnosing a perilymph fistula at tympanotomy are discussed. At follow-up, vestibular symptoms were found to be eliminated or improved in 96 per cent of cases with surgically demonstrated fistulae and in 68 per cent of cases in which no fistula was detected at tympanotomy but hearing improved significantly in only one ear (4 per cent) of the former group and in five ears (20 per cent) of the latter group. 
Does the presence of a measurable blood alcohol level in a potential organ donor affect the outcome of liver transplantation? The widespread application of hepatic transplantation has created a tremendous demand for donor organs. An assessment of donor parameters is thought to be important in selecting good donors; however, the criteria utilized have not been standardized. This study was performed to determine the effect of a measurable donor blood alcohol level on graft survival. Fifty-two patients who underwent orthotopic liver transplantation at the University of Pittsburgh were included in the study. Twenty-five patients received liver grafts from donors having a blood alcohol level between 0.04 and 0.4 g/l with a mean of 0.17 g/l. Twenty-seven patients received a liver graft from a donor who had no measurable blood alcohol. There were no differences between these two groups of donors regarding the time of initial hospitalization until the time of donation. Graft failure within the first 30 days was 24% for those receiving an organ from an alcohol-positive donor as compared with 22.2% in those receiving an organ from an alcohol negative donor. The recipient mortality rate was 16% and 11%, respectively. No relationships between the donor blood alcohol level and organ performance, frequency of primary graft nonfunction, or number of episodes of acute cellular rejection were evident. Based upon these data, the presence of a measurable blood alcohol level in a donor should not mitigate against organ donation. 
A novel approach to analysis of transcriptional regulation in human cells: initial application to melanocytes and melanoma cells. An assay system for transcriptional profile analysis of cultured eukaryotic cells has been developed to simultaneously handle multiple samples in a rapid, sensitive, and internally controlled manner. The methodology incorporates a microtiter plate assay system, a rapid cell-harvest enzyme-assay technique, and the bacterial reporter genes beta-glucuronidase and beta-galactosidase. We demonstrate, using beta-actin and SV40 (late) transcription promoting sequences, that this technically refined microtiter-triton-lysate (MTL) assay methodology can readily differentiate between the transcriptional states of human melanocytes before and after pharmacologic stimulation and malignantly transformed versus normal cell environments. Differences in the transcriptional environments are revealed by the relative expression of transcription element probes. The transcriptional activity ratio of the beta-actin compared to the SV40 late transcription promoting sequences was approximately 1:2 in primary cultured melanocytes, 2:1 in 12-0-tetradecanoyl phorbol-13-acetate (TPA)-treated melanocytes and 1:4 in the Tang melanoma cell line. Because this MTL assay methodology can accommodate a panel of transcription element probes, we anticipate that the resultant transcriptional profiles will prove useful in deciphering the diverse transcriptional changes that occur within normally regulated and malignantly transformed cells. 
Intestinal manifestations of invasive diarrheas and their diagnosis. Data from studies of 916 children with diarrhea, including 122 from whom shigellae were isolated, and data on patients affected in an epidemic due to Shigella dysenteriae type I were analyzed to determine whether a diagnostic clinical profile of shigellosis could be identified. Blood and/or mucus in stool, increased frequency of stool, abdominal pain, rectal tenesmus, and fever were noted more frequently in patients with shigellosis. The diagnostic confirmation of shigellosis depends on the isolation of the organism, but in the clinical situation early initiation of appropriate antibiotic therapy can be based on clinical judgment that utilizes local perceptions regarding dysentery. 
Histopathology and immunohistochemistry of the caecum in children with the Trichuris dysentery syndrome. Caecal biopsy specimens from Jamaican children with the Trichuris dysentery syndrome (TDS) and age matched Jamaican controls were investigated by immunohistochemistry and by light microscopy. Biopsy specimens from all children (with TDS and controls) showed a mild to moderate increase in inflammatory cells. Except in the vicinity of the worm, where the epithelium was flattened, there was no other epithelial abnormality. Compared with controls, children with TDS had increased IgM lamina propria plasma cells and decreased intraepithelial T cells. There was also an increase in crypt epithelial cell proliferation. Lamina propria T cells (both activated and non-activated) were no more common in children with the Trichuris syndrome than controls. Epithelial cell HLA-DR and VLA-1 expression (which are increased in other colitides) were the same in both groups. Despite the presence of large worm burdens and chronic dysentery, therefore, only minor changes were seen in the caecal mucosa of children with TDS. 
Analysis of prognostic factors in men with metastatic prostate cancer. Uro-Oncology Group of Northern Alberta. We determined the influence of the extent of disease on bone scan, serum testosterone, patient age, performance status, method of initial diagnosis, Gleason grade, clinical stage at diagnosis, serum acid phosphatase, serum prostate specific antigen (PSA) and primary hormonal treatment on survival. The clinical and hormonal data were obtained when the presence of metastatic disease was established and treatment was to be initiated in 162 men with metastatic prostate cancer. Mean followup was 16 months (range 1 to 105 months). A total of 70 men (43.2%) died of the metastatic disease during the evaluation period. Log rank analysis revealed that only serum testosterone (p = 0.035) and extent of disease on bone scan (p = 0.003) significantly affected over-all survival. A trend (p = 0.068) towards decreased survival was observed with increasing values of PSA. Increasing values of acid phosphatase positively correlated with extent of disease on bone scan but was not a significant independent prognostic factor. Patient age, performance status, clinical stage, method of initial diagnosis, Gleason grade and type of hormonal treatment did not significantly influence survival. Upon using multivariate Cox analysis, only extent of disease on bone scan was significantly correlated with over-all survival (p less than 0.014). PSA may also be influential but longer duration of followup will be necessary. We conclude that extent of disease on bone scan is the most important prognosticator of the analyzed factors and that serum testosterone may be of value. 
Differential effects of transforming growth factor-beta 1 and phorbol myristate acetate on cardiac fibroblasts. Regulation of fibrillar collagen mRNAs and expression of early transcription factors. Cardiac fibroblasts are responsible for synthesis and deposition of fibrillar collagen types I and III. Transforming growth factor-beta 1 (TGF-beta 1) has been proved to increase collagen biosynthesis in various systems, both in vivo and in vitro. We have investigated the effect of TGF-beta 1 on collagen gene expression in cultured cardiac fibroblasts and have compared this effect with that of a mitogenic agent, phorbol myristate acetate (PMA). The regulation of collagen types I and III gene expression was examined by using cDNA probes to rat alpha 2 (I) and mouse alpha 1 (III) procollagens. Quiescent cultured cardiac fibroblasts from rabbit heart were treated with TGF-beta 1 (10-15 ng/ml) and PMA (200 ng/ml). After 24 hours of treatment with TGF-beta 1, the abundance of mRNA for pro-alpha 2 (I) and pro-alpha 1 (III) collagens was increased by 112% (p less than 0.001) and 97% (p = 0.05), respectively, in treated fibroblasts compared with untreated cells. However, PMA-treated cells showed an opposite response: a 42% (p = 0.01) decrease in mRNA levels for pro-alpha 2 (I) collagen was observed. Immunofluorescent staining of cardiac fibroblasts in culture with anti-type I collagen antibody showed that alterations in mRNA levels led to altered collagen synthesis: cellular collagen was relatively increased in TGF-beta 1-treated cells and significantly diminished in PMA-treated cells. The abundance of mRNA for pro-alpha 1 (III) collagen was not affected by PMA treatment. 
Skeletal muscle degradation and nitrogen wasting in rats with chronic metabolic acidosis. 1. Chronic metabolic acidosis is associated with impaired growth and negative nitrogen balance, suggesting that it promotes endogenous protein catabolism. 2. Skeletal muscle is the major repository of body protein and is a potential target for stimuli of protein catabolism. 3. This study in vivo examines the effects of chronic metabolic acidosis on the relationship between growth, nitrogen disposal and skeletal muscle catabolism in the rat. 4. Growth, nitrogen utilization and acquisition of body mass were significantly impaired in acidotic animals compared with pair-fed controls. 5. Total nitrogen excretion was significantly increased in acidotic rats despite decreased urea production. The time course of this response to acidosis was synchronous with that of accelerated protein catabolism in skeletal muscle. 6. It is proposed that metabolic acidosis impairs growth by stimulating skeletal muscle protein catabolism. It is suggested that this forms part of a co-ordinated multi-organ homoeostatic response to acidosis, skeletal muscle and down-regulated urea production supplying the nitrogen required for renal ammoniagenesis. 
Improvement of outcome for infants of birth weight under 1000 g. The Victorian Infant Collaborative Study Group. The two year outcome of extremely low birth-weight (ELBW) infants (birth weight 500 to 999 g), born in the state of Victoria over two distinct eras, 1979-80 and 1985-7, were compared. In the 1979-80 era, 25.4% of the ELBW infants survived to 2 years of age; only 12.5% of liveborn ELBW infants survived to 2 years with no neurological disabilities. In the 1979-80 era, ELBW infants born outside the level III centres in the state were significantly disadvantaged in both mortality and neurological morbidity. By 1985-7, the two year survival rate of ELBW infants rose significantly from 25.4% to 37.9%. By 1985-7, the proportion of ELBW infants who survived to 2 years free of neurological disabilities increased from 12.5% to 26.2%. Despite the improved survival, the absolute number of 2 year old children survivors with severe neurological disabilities remained constant at 8/year in both eras. By 1985-7, fewer ELBW infants were born outside the level III centres, their survival rate remained lower, but the severe neurological disability rate in survivors was no longer significantly higher. There has been a concomitant improvement in both survival and reduction in neurological morbidity. 
CT, MRI, and autopsy findings in brain of a patient with MELAS. Brain autopsy findings in a 14-year-old patient with mitochondrial myopathy, encephalopathy, lactic acidosis, and strokelike episodes were compared with those of computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Pathologic examinations revealed extensive laminar necrosis bordered by gliotic tissues throughout the cerebral cortices. Moderate losses of myelin and fibrous gliosis were also observed in the subcortical and deep white matter. These lesions were demonstrated as low-density areas on CT and as high-signal areas on T2-weighted MRI. MRI revealed the lesions more distinctively and precisely than CT. Neither CT nor MRI could reveal abnormalities in the basal ganglia, including vascular proliferation and calcium deposits in the blood vessels. 
Effect of hyaluronic acid on postoperative intraperitoneal adhesion formation and reformation in the rat model. The local application of 0.25% or 0.4% HA before the induction of a measured laser injury on the rat uterine horn was associated with a significant reduction (P less than 0.05) in postoperative IP adhesions when compared with the group of animals pretreated with the diluent vehicle PBS or received no pretreatment. However, 0.4% HA, when applied in a similar manner, was ineffective in reducing reformation of adhesions after microsurgical adhesiolysis. 
Gaucher disease: heterologous expression of two alleles associated with neuronopathic phenotypes. To investigate the molecular basis for the distinct neuronopathic phenotypes of Gaucher disease, acid beta-glucosidases expressed from mutant DNAs in Gaucher disease type 2 (acute) and type 3 (subacute) patients were characterized in fibroblasts and with the baculovirus expression system in insect cells. Expression of the mutant DNA encoding a proline-for-leucine substitution at amino acid 444 (L444P) resulted in a catalytically defective, unstable acid beta-glucosidase in either fibroblasts from L444P/L444P homozygotes or in insect cells. This mutation was found to be homoallelic in subacute neuronopathic (type 3) Gaucher disease. In comparison, expression of the mutant cDNA encoding an arginine-for-proline substitution at amino acid 415 (P415R) resulted in an inactive and unstable protein in insect cells. This allele was found only in a type 2 patient with the L444P/P415R genotype. The substantial variation in the type 3 phenotype (L444P homozygotes) suggests the complex nature of the molecular basis of phenotypic variation in Gaucher disease. Yet, the association of neuronopathic phenotypes with alleles producing severely compromised (L444P) or functionally null (P415R) enzymes indicates that the effective level of residual activity at the lysosome is likely to be a major determinant of the severity of Gaucher disease. 
Human papillomavirus type 16 DNA in ocular and cervical swabs of women with genital tract condylomata. Human papillomavirus type 16 is associated with dysplasias and carcinomas of the conjunctiva and of the uterine cervix. To explore the relationship between cervical and ocular human papillomavirus infection, we examined DNA from bilateral limbal swabs and cervical swabs from 17 women (age range, 17 to 46 years; median, 31.7 years) with biopsy-proven human papillomavirus-related cervical dysplasia who had a normal ocular surface. Using polymerase chain reaction, we identified human papillomavirus 16 DNA in one or both eyes of 13 (76.5%) patients, six (46.2%) of whom had demonstrable human papillomavirus 16 DNA in cervical swabs as well. It thus appears that human papillomavirus 16 is present in the conjunctivae of some patients with human papillomavirus-related genital warts who have no ocular manifestations of infection. Although autoinoculation of conjunctiva may be the source of some ocular human papillomavirus, data suggest that other modes of transmission to the eye also exist. Additional study of the epidemiologic characteristics of ocular human papillomavirus, a widely prevalent virus known to be associated with dysplasias/atypias and cancer, is warranted. 
Deglutition syncope with coexistent carotid sinus hypersensitivity. A 63-year-old man had symptomatic deglutition-induced atrioventricular (A-V) block. There was also a coexistent mixed type carotid sinus hypersensitivity presenting as A-V block. No A-V nodal dysfunction was revealed during electrophysiologic studies. The vasodepressor response to carotid massage implies a central vagal hyperresponsiveness, which can also explain the cardioinhibitory responses to swallowing and carotid sinus massage, both possibly unmasked by posterior myocardial infarction. 
Tracking of elevated blood pressure values in adolescent athletes at 1-year follow-up. Resting blood pressures were measured in 467 adolescents during preparticipation physical examinations for high school sports. Fifty-seven of the athletes (12.2%) had significantly elevated blood pressures. Forty-three (79.6%) of 54 subjects demonstrated significantly and persistently elevated blood pressures at 1-year follow-up. A family history of hypertension was positively associated with elevated blood pressures in 46 (80.7%) of 57 subjects compared with controls (23/410 [5.6%]). Consistent with previous studies, subjects with elevated blood pressures had a greater body weight (94.5 +/- 25.7 kg) compared with normotensive subjects (75.2 +/- 14.0 kg). Subjects with elevated blood pressures engaged in heavy resistance weight training (three times a week or more) more often (41/57 [71.9%]) than normotensive subjects (65/410 [15.8%]). These data support the idea that blood pressures measured during routine preparticipation physical examinations for high school sports are a useful tool in screening for elevated blood pressure in adolescents. 
Seminoma of the testis in a patient with 48,XXYY variant of Klinefelter's syndrome. We believe this is the first reported case of seminoma in a patient with the 48,XXYY variant form of Klinefelter's syndrome. Moreover, the seminoma in this patient occurred in a normally descended testis. We report this case because patients with 48,XXYY Klinefelter's syndrome are often confined to institutions, where the diagnosis of testicular tumor may not be recognized as readily. 
From chimney sweeps to oncogenes: the quest for the causes of cancer. Over the past 200 years, a bewildering array of chemical, physical, and viral agents has been identified that can cause cancer, but the mechanisms involved are only now becoming clear. In the leukemias and lymphomas, it appears that the activation of cellular oncogenes is important. The genes involved are present in all normal cells and are often associated with cell growth and regulation. When activated, they act in a dominant fashion to cause a cell to express the malignant phenotype. There is increasing evidence that in solid tumors, a more important mechanism may be the loss of a suppressor gene. The classic example is retinoblastoma, in which the retinoblastoma gene has been cloned and is also found to be associated with several other common cancers including sarcomas and small cell lung cancer. It is likely to be one of a family of such genes. It may well be that the activation of one or more oncogenes or the loss of one or more suppressor genes, or both, is required for a tumor to progress from initiation through promotion to a metastasizing malignancy. 
Influence of changes in arterial carbon dioxide tension on the electroencephalogram and posterior tibial nerve somatosensory cortical evoked potentials during alfentanil/nitrous oxide anesthesia. The effects of variation of arterial CO2 tension (PaCO2) on the electroencephalogram (EEG) and posterior tibial nerve somatosensory cortical evoked potentials (PTN-SCEP) during opioid/N2O anesthesia have not been well documented. We studied the effects of hypocapnia (PaCO2 approximately 23 mmHg) and hypercapnia (PaCO2 approximately 50 mmHg) during steady-state alfentanil/N2O anesthesia in 16 patients. EEG and PTN-SCEP were recorded continuously, while PaCO2 was altered in 15-min intervals by varying the inspired CO2 concentration. Hypocapnia caused significant increases in power in the delta, theta, and beta bands (P less than 0.01), with the greatest increase observed in the alpha band. Relative power increased in the alpha band but remained unchanged in the delta, theta, and beta bands. Median frequency and 95% spectral edge frequency were unaltered during hypocapnia. In contrast, hypercapnia caused a significant decrease of power in the alpha and beta bands, whereas delta and theta power remained unchanged. This was reflected in a significant decrease of the 95% spectral edge frequency, from 8.9 (6.7-11.6) to 7.0 (5.6-8.6) Hz. All EEG parameters returned to normal upon restoration of normocapnia. There was a significant negative correlation between power in the alpha band and end-tidal CO2 in all patients (r = 0.47 to -0.89). PTN-SCEP latencies and amplitudes were not significantly different from control values during hypocapnia and hypercapnia. It is concluded that variations in PaCO2 within the limits 20-50 mmHg produce substantial changes in the EEG power spectrum, especially in the alpha band (8-12 Hz), but do not alter PTN-SCEP. 
Gastric antral vascular ectasia: a problem of recognition and diagnosis. Gastric antral vascular ectasia ('water melon stomach') is a poorly documented cause of occult upper gastrointestinal blood loss. We describe a case which emphasises the clinical and pathological difficulties that can be encountered in making this elusive diagnosis. 
A historic case of visual agnosia revisited after 40 years. In one of the seminal works on visual agnosia, Adler (1944, 1950) presented the case of a 22-yr-old woman who sustained carbon monoxide cerebral toxicity in the Cocoanut Grove nightclub diaster of 1942. We located this patient 40 yrs after injury and performed a detailed reevaluation. The patient demonstrated persistent deficits in visual recognition, characterized most prominently by defective recognition of elemental shape and form, associated with alexia, prosopagnosia, visuospatial disorientation and impaired visual imagery. Visual acuity, colour recognition, writing ability and verbal intelligence were relatively preserved. Isolated bilateral occipital injury was demonstrated by CT and MRI scanning. On comparison with previously reported cases, our results support the hypothesis that carbon monoxide toxicity can induce a visual agnosia of the apperceptive type with well defined characteristics, seldom seen with other types of cerebral injury. Prognosis for long-term recovery is poor. 
Clinical implications of combined hypogastric and profunda femoral artery occlusion. From 1983 to 1990, nine patients with combined hypogastric (HA) and profunda femoral arterial (PFA) occlusive disease presented with five nonhealing hip disarticulations, three nonhealing above-the-knee amputations, perineal necrosis in six patients, buttock necrosis in four patients, visceral ischemia in two patients, and lumbosacral spinal ischemia in one patient. Obviously some patients had more than one regional complication. Five patients died from complications of HA/PFA ischemia. Survivors included two patients who required a hemipelvectomy, one patient who required an axillary-to-hypogastric artery bypass graft for stump salvage, and one patient who survived despite lumbosacral paralysis and complete cystectomy. The 56% mortality and 100% morbidity emphasize the critical significance of combined hypogastric/profunda femoral artery circulatory compromise. Efforts should be made to preserve or re-establish the HA and/or PFA circulation whenever possible. A hemipelvectomy may be required to allow the wounds to finally heal. Furthermore, the certainty of an above-the-knee amputation healing is not present in these patients; therefore, a hemodynamic assessment of the healing potential of an above-the-knee amputation is required. 
Atrial fibrillation associated with autonomic dysreflexia in patients with tetraplegia. Atrial fibrillation is an arrhythmia characterized by disorganized atrial depolarizations and an irregular ventricular response. Most patients with atrial fibrillation have underlying cardiac pathology. This paper presents the cases of three patients with high-level spinal cord injury and symptoms of autonomic dysreflexia who developed atrial fibrillation without any cardiac or metabolic disease that would predispose them to this. The paper proposes that autonomic dysreflexia might predispose a patient to atrial fibrillation by altering the pattern of repolarization of the atria, making the heart susceptible to a reentrant type of arrhythmia. High-level spinal cord injured patients may be at increased risk for the development of atrial fibrillation, an arrhythmia which, if left untreated, can increase the incidence of an embolic cerebrovascular accident that could further impair the patient's functional status. 
Duration of ST segment depression after exercise-induced myocardial ischemia is influenced by body position during recovery but not by type of exercise. To assess whether the duration of ischemic ST segment depression after exercise can be modified by changes in body position during recovery or with different types of exercise, 18 patients with chronic stable angina, positive exercise test results, and documented coronary artery disease were prospectively studied. Every patient underwent testing with three different exercise protocols: (1) Bruce (Bruce-standing recovery), (2) abrupt onset of exercise (abrupt), and (3) modified Bruce protocol preceded by a 10-minute warm-up period (warm-up). After exercise test patients recovered in a sitting position. In addition, all patients performed a fourth exercise (Bruce protocol), but this time they recovered in the supine position (Bruce-supine recovery). Time and heart rate-blood pressure product at 1 mm ST segment depression were similar for Bruce-standing recovery, abrupt, and Bruce-supine recovery protocols (5.1 +/- 2, 4.4 +/- 2, and 5.2 +/- 2 minutes and 20.8 +/- 4, 21.3 +/- 4, and 20.4 +/- 4 beats/min x mm Hg x 10(-3), respectively. Heart rate and heart rate-blood pressure product at peak exercise did not differ in Bruce-standing recovery, abrupt, and Bruce-supine recovery. Maximal ST segment depression was -2.0, -1.9, and -2.0 mm with Bruce-standing recovery, abrupt, and Bruce-supine recovery exercise, respectively, and -1.5 mm with warm-up exercise (p less than 0.05). Duration of ST segment depression into recovery was significantly prolonged after Bruce-supine recovery exercise (9.4 + 5 minutes) compared with Bruce-standing recovery, abrupt, and warm-up protocols (6.8 + 3, 5.9 + 4, and 5.0 + 3 minutes, respectively; p less than 0.05). 
Treatment of experimental suprachoroidal hemorrhage with subconjunctival injection of tissue plasminogen activator: a negative report. Suprachoroidal hemorrhage was created in 10 albino rabbit eyes. Five eyes were treated with subconjunctival injections of 40,000 IU of tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) daily for 6 days; five eyes served as controls. It took approximately the same amount of time for the suprachoroidal hemorrhages to clear in both the control and treatment eyes. We conclude that subconjunctival injection of tPA does not accelerate the clearance of suprachoroidal hemorrhage. 
A phase I study of high-dose ifosfamide and escalating doses of carboplatin with autologous bone marrow support. The dose-limiting toxicity in two separate phase I trials of the high-dose single agents ifosfamide and carboplatin was renal insufficiency at 18 g/m2 and hepatic and ototoxicity at 2,400 mg/m2, respectively. In this phase I study, 16 adults were treated with ifosfamide at 75% of the single-agent maximum-tolerated dose (MTD) (12 g/m2) and escalating doses of carboplatin (400 to 1,600 mg/m2) to determine the nonhematologic dose-limiting toxicity and the maximum-tolerated dose of the combination. Both drugs as well as mesna for uroprotection were given by continuous infusion over 4 days with an additional day of mesna (total dose per course, 15 g/m2). Autologous bone marrow support was stipulated for subsequent dose levels once granulocytes remained less than 500/microL for more than 14 days in two of three to five patients entered at a given dose level. Autologous bone marrow support was used at doses above the 400 mg/m2 carboplatin dose level. At the maximum-tolerated dose level of 1,600 mg/m2 of carboplatin, renal toxicity precluded further dose escalation. Of the five patients entered at this dose level, reversible creatinine elevation greater than 2 mg/dL (median peak, 2.6 mg/dL) was observed in three patients, and irreversible renal failure occurred in an additional patient (peak creatinine, 6.9 mg/dL. Transient gross hematuria appeared more common with the combination than with ifosfamide alone. Two patients developed severe somnolence and confusion associated with a rising creatinine. There were two complete (CRs) and four partial responses (PRs) in 14 heavily pretreated assessable patients (including four partial or complete responses in eight assessable patients with advanced refractory sarcoma, and one CR in two patients with germ cell carcinoma). Carboplatin and ifosfamide appear to have overlapping renal toxicity. Nevertheless, carboplatin and ifosfamide can be combined at 80% and 75% of the single-agent maximum-tolerated doses, respectively, with acceptable nonhematologic toxicity. Ifosfamide and carboplatin are an attractive core combination for further studies in the treatment of sarcoma, germ cell, ovarian, and lung carcinomas. 
New concepts in treatment of chronic persistent asthma. Using a stepwise protocol to control inflammation. Asthma continues to cause unacceptably high rates of disability and death, largely because the severity of disease is underestimated and patients are inadequately educated about their disease. When patients understand what happens during an asthma attack and its aftermath, they are more likely to notice important symptoms and to start or increase self-treatment appropriately. Physicians are responsible for teaching patients how to avoid precipitating factors and for discussing and writing down a self-treatment plan to follow in specific circumstances. The British Thoracic Society has suggested a stepwise protocol for drug treatment of asthma. Each patient must be evaluated individually and started at the appropriate step. 
Allogeneic bone marrow transplantation as therapy for primary induction failure for patients with acute leukemia. The survival of patients with acute leukemia who do not achieve a remission with primary therapy is very poor. High-dose chemoradiotherapy followed by allogeneic bone marrow transplantation (BMT) has been shown to be effective therapy for patients with acute and chronic leukemia. Therefore, we determined the long-term disease-free survival of patients who did not achieve a remission and were then treated with high-dose therapy and bone marrow allografting from matched sibling donors. Twenty-one patients (median age, 28 years) who did not achieve a remission with induction chemotherapy were subsequently treated with allogeneic BMT. After BMT, 90% achieved a complete remission. Six died of complications of the therapy, and six patients relapsed between 27 and 448 days after BMT. Nine patients (43%; median age, 25 years) are alive between 556 and 4,174 days after BMT. The cumulative probability of disease-free survival at 10 years is 43%. This study suggests that allogeneic BMT can be an effective therapy to achieve long-term control of acute leukemia, even in those patients who do not achieve a remission with primary therapy. 
Does tremor pace repetitive voluntary motor behavior in Parkinson's disease? In patients with Parkinson's disease and in normal subjects, the influence of tremor on repetitive voluntary movement was investigated in the index finger by comparing frequency of isometric force tremor with frequency of voluntary alternating isometric contractions. Tremor frequency, measured over the range from 0 to 70% maximum voluntary force, usually increased with force. The tremor frequency band was lower and more often overlapped with the upper voluntary frequency range in patients than in normal subjects. Normal subjects could accurately produce voluntary contractions at all cue frequencies from 1 to 5 Hz. Patients could produce auditory-paced frequencies of 1 and 2 Hz, but at higher cue frequencies, their voluntary contractions were often faster or slower than the cue. The faster or "hastened" voluntary frequencies were within the tremor frequency band, whereas the slowed voluntary frequencies were below it. Maximal voluntary frequency was often greater than the lowest but always less than the highest tremor frequency. It is concluded that parkinsonian tremor may pace voluntary repetitive movements to go faster than intended with the highest tremor frequency being an upper limit for voluntary frequency. Similar mechanisms may underlie the hastened repetitive vocal responses that were also observed in the parkinsonian patients. 
Nonhealing leg ulcers: a manifestation of basal cell carcinoma. Seven patients with basal cell carcinomas presenting as nonhealing ulcers are reported. The importance of considering malignancy and taking biopsy specimens of leg ulcers that fail to respond to treatment is emphasized. 
Potassium depletion exacerbates essential hypertension. OBJECTIVE: To determine the effect of potassium depletion on blood pressure in patients with essential hypertension. DESIGN: Double-blind, randomized, crossover study, with each patient serving as his or her own control. SETTING: Clinical research center at a university hospital. PATIENTS: Twelve patients with hypertension. INTERVENTIONS: Patients were placed on 10-day isocaloric diets providing a daily potassium intake of either 16 mmol or 96 mmol. The intake of sodium (120 mmol/d) and other minerals was kept constant. On day 11 each patient received a 2-litre isotonic saline infusion over 4 hours. MEASUREMENTS: Blood pressure; urinary excretion rates for sodium, potassium, calcium, and phosphorous; glomerular filtration rate; renal plasma flow; and plasma levels of vasoactive hormones. MAIN RESULTS: With low potassium intake, systolic blood pressure increased (P = 0.01) by 7 mm Hg (95% CI, 3 mm Hg to 11 mm Hg) and diastolic pressure increased (P = 0.04) by 6 mm Hg (CI, 1 mm Hg to 11 mm Hg), whereas plasma potassium concentration decreased (P less than 0.001) by 0.8 mmol/L (CI, 0.4 to 1.0 mmol/L). In response to a 2-litre isotonic saline infusion, the mean arterial pressure increased similarly on both diets but reached higher levels on low potassium intake (115 +/- 2 mm Hg compared with 109 +/- 2 mm Hg, P = 0.03). Potassium depletion was associated with a decrease in sodium excretion (83 +/- 6 mmol/d compared with 110 +/- 5 mmol/d, P less than 0.001). Plasma renin activity and plasma aldosterone concentrations also decreased in patients during low potassium intake, but concentrations of arginine vasopressin and atrial natriuretic peptide, glomerular filtration rate, and renal plasma flow were unchanged. Further, low potassium intake increased urinary excretion of calcium and phosphorus and of plasma immunoreactive parathyroid hormone levels. CONCLUSION: Dietary potassium restriction increases blood pressure in patients with essential hypertension. Both sodium retention and calcium depletion may contribute to the increase in blood pressure during potassium depletion. 
Effect of inspiratory muscle fatigue on breathing pattern during inspiratory resistive loading. The purpose of this study was to determine whether induction of either inspiratory muscle fatigue (expt 1) or diaphragmatic fatigue (expt 2) would alter the breathing pattern response to large inspiratory resistive loads. In particular, we wondered whether induction of fatigue would result in rapid shallow breathing during inspiratory resistive loading. The breathing pattern during inspiratory resistive loading was measured for 5 min in the absence of fatigue (control) and immediately after induction of either inspiratory muscle fatigue or diaphragmatic fatigue. Data were separately analyzed for the 1st and 5th min of resistive loading to distinguish between immediate and sustained effects. Fatigue was achieved by having the subjects breathe against an inspiratory threshold load while generating a predetermined fraction of either the maximal mouth pressure or maximal transdiaphragmatic pressure until they could no longer reach the target pressure. Compared with control, there were no significant alterations in breathing pattern after induction of fatigue during either the 1st or 5th min of resistive loading, regardless of whether fatigue was induced in the majority of the inspiratory muscles or just in the diaphragm. We conclude that the development of inspiratory muscle fatigue does not alter the breathing pattern response to large inspiratory resistive loads. 
Benign and malignant tumors in patients with acromegaly. Growth hormone and its principal mediator insulinlike growth factor I are known promoters of normal growth. To determine whether excessive secretion of growth hormone is associated with an increased occurrence of benign and of malignant tumors, we studied records of 87 patients with acromegaly seen in the Lahey Clinic Medical Center (Burlington, Mass) from 1957 to 1988 and compared the rate of tumor occurrence with a control group of patients with pituitary tumors (198) and with findings from a cancer registry. Patients with acromegaly had a 2.45-fold increased rate of malignant tumors (95% confidence interval, 0.98 to 5.04) compared with findings from the tumor registry. Female patients had a higher rate than male patients. The rate of carcinoma of the thyroid was excessive and previously underscribed, but the rate of carcinoma of the colon was not increased as reported by others. Among benign lesions, goiters, predominantly nodular, were seen in 25% of patients in addition to a large number of mesenchymal lesions. 
Superior vena caval obstruction in patients with gut failure receiving home parenteral nutrition. Clinical suspicion and venographic conformation were used to diagnose 15 cases of superior vena caval obstruction (SVCO) in 107 home parenteral nutrition (HPN) patients over 379 cumulative years of HPN (3.9 cases/100 patient-years). Patients with SVCO had been on HPN a mean of 51.5 months and had used 6.2 (range 1-50) central catheters, including short- and long-term, before SVCO was diagnosed. The frequency of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) with SVCO was approximately the same as that in our general HPN population. Positive blood cultures were present immediately preceding the diagnosis of SVCO in 40% (six of 15) of cases. Atypical line placements were noted in two cases. The most common management strategies employed were conversion to enteral feedings in five patients and placement of a new catheter directly into the right atrium by thoracotomy in another five patients. Two of the five with right atrial catheters experienced a postpericardiotomy syndrome (fever, pericardial rub, and pulmonary infiltrates) that responded promptly to indomethacin. The most significant long-term sequela of SVCO was the need for a left jugular vein to right atrial appendage bypass in one patient with chronic venous congestion from her SVCO. Once the SVCO is confirmed, systemic heparinization provides immediate antithrombotic effect and minimizes the risk of pulmonary embolism. The use of streptokinase may result in rapid thrombolysis. 
Differential diagnosis of cystic neoplasms of the pancreas by fine-needle aspiration. Fine-needle aspiration biopsy of pancreatic lesions is becoming widespread. Pathologists need to be familiar with the cytologic features of pancreatic tumors, of which cystic neoplasms are a distinct subset. Of our 31 pancreatic aspirates diagnostic of neoplasia, six were diagnosed as cystic by radiographic imaging. These cases were compared. Similar symptoms were experienced by all of these patients, although those with malignant tumors lost the most weight. Loss of border definition, ascites, and liver metastases were the only radiologic clues to malignancy. Each entity had distinguishing cytologic features. These cases illustrate the importance of knowing the clinical, radiologic, and cytologic features of pancreatic cystic neoplasms to arrive at a preoperative diagnosis and determine proper treatment. 
Pulmonary dysfunction in advanced liver disease: frequent occurrence of an abnormal diffusing capacity. PURPOSE: Abnormalities in pulmonary function have been reported in association with chronic liver disease of varied etiology. The aim of this study was to better define the frequency and nature of these abnormalities in patients who were being evaluated for liver transplantation. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We performed a battery of pulmonary function tests and chest radiographs in 116 consecutive patients (50 men, 66 women; aged 19 to 70 years, mean 44.6 years) with severe advanced liver disease who were hospitalized specifically for evaluation for possible orthotopic liver transplantation and were able to perform technically satisfactory tests. In 17 patients, quantitative whole-body technetium-99m macroaggregated albumin perfusion scanning was also performed for assessment of possible right-to-left shunting through intrapulmonary vascular dilatations. RESULTS: The most commonly affected test of lung function was the single-breath diffusing capacity for carbon monoxide (DLCO), which was abnormal in 48%, 45%, and 71% of patients who never smoked, former smokers, and current smokers, respectively. Ventilatory restriction was noted in 25% of all patients, airflow obstruction (reduced ratio of forced expiratory volume in 1 second to forced vital expiratory volume in 1 second to forced vital capacity) in only 3%, and a widened alveolar-arterial oxygen gradient in 45%. Diffusion impairment was accompanied by a restrictive defect in only 35% of the patients and by an abnormally widened alveolar-arterial oxygen gradient in 60%. When diffusion impairment was accompanied by an oxygenation defect, it was also associated with a significantly increased right-to-left shunt fraction (mean 24.9%) assessed from quantitative whole-body perfusion imaging. On the other hand, isolated diffusion impairment unaccompanied by significant hypoxemia (noted in approximately a third of the patients with a reduced DLCO) was not associated with evidence of significant intrapulmonary shunting (mean right-to-left shunt fraction 6.7%). CONCLUSIONS: Most patients with advanced liver disease have one or more types of abnormality in lung function, a reduced DLCO being the single most common functional defect. Mechanisms accounting for the abnormality in gas transfer may include intrapulmonary vascular dilatations, diffuse interstitial lung disease, pulmonary vaso-occlusive disease, and/or ventilation-perfusion imbalance. 
Migraine headaches. Once the definitive diagnosis of migraine has been formulated, the physician has many options available for abortive and prophylactic therapy. Nonpharmacologic modalities, including behavioral modification methods such as biofeedback training, may also be considered. Migraine does not necessarily have to disrupt the lives of those afflicted. The patient with mixed headache presents a more difficult diagnostic and therapeutic problem. These patients can also be helped when the disorder is identified, and inpatient therapy for these patients may be required. 
Successful treatment of hepatosplenic candidiasis with a liposomal amphotericin B preparation. The case of a granulocytopenic patient with acute undifferentiated leukaemia and hepatosplenic candidiasis who was refractory to conventional deoxycholate amphotericin B (AmpB) and 5-flucytosine therapy is reported. He experienced severe AmpB-related side-effects, and was subsequently successfully treated with a pharmaceutical preparation of AmpB (5.7 g) entrapped in sonicated liposomes, composed of lecithin, cholesterol and stearylamine in a molar ratio of 4:3:1. Three months later, during maintenance chemotherapy, liposomal AmpB (5.1 g) was reinstituted due to the finding of biopsies positive for Candida albicans at bronchoscopy. After healing of the patient's fungal infection a left upper lobe resection was performed, which showed advanced fibrosis with signs of inflammation, but no evidence of fungal disease. Since no acute side-effects and only moderate hypokalaemia were observed, it appears that liposomal AmpB is superior to conventional AmpB treatment in granulocytopenic patients with hepatosplenic candidiasis and unbearable therapy-related side-effects. 
Incidence of heterotopic ossification after total hip replacement: effect of the type of fixation of the femoral component. The incidence and severity of heterotopic ossification after sixty-five consecutive primary uncemented total hip replacements were compared with those after seventy consecutive primary hybrid total hip replacements (consisting of an uncemented acetabular component and a cemented femoral component). All patients had had the arthroplasty because of osteoarthrosis. The sex distribution, prevalence of bilateral disease of the hip, and frequency of previous operations were similar in both groups. All of the operations were performed by one surgeon who used the same operative approach. Preoperative, immediate postoperative, and six-month follow-up radiographs were reviewed for all patients. For 90 per cent of the hips, radiographs that were made after a minimum follow-up of one year were also reviewed. In the group of patients who had an uncemented femoral component, there was a statistically significant increase in the frequency of heterotopic bone and in its severity. Either none or only class-I ectopic bone developed in 74 per cent of the hips in the hybrid group, compared with 40 per cent of the hips in the uncemented group (p less than 0.005). In contrast, class-III or IV heterotopic ossification was evident in 13 per cent of the hips in the uncemented group (p less than 0.005). None of the patients in the hybrid group needed reoperation for excision of ectopic bone, but four (6 per cent) of the patients in the uncemented group needed such a reoperation because of severe limitation of motion. 
Transduodenal exploration of the common bile duct in patients with nondilated ducts. Exploration of the small common bile duct can be technically difficult and is associated with a significant risk of ductal injury or late stricture, or both. Transduodenal common duct exploration after sphincteroplasty (TCDE/S) is an alternative method of duct exploration that avoids choledochotomy. Cholecystectomy followed by TCDE/S was performed upon 28 patients with nondilated ducts and suspected choledocholithiasis. Common duct stones were retrieved in 17 patients. Failure to retrieve stones in the remaining 11 patients was attributed to either false-positive results of cholangiography, forceful passage of stones into the duodenum during the initial insertion of a Fogarty catheter through the cystic duct or a false-negative finding at duct exploration. There was no perioperative mortality. Two patients had asymptomatic postoperative hyperamylasemia. One patient had postoperative pancreatitis, hyperbilirubinemia and cholangitis that resolved with antibiotic therapy by the eighth postoperative day. Other complications included wound infection, delayed gastric emptying, pneumonia and otitis media. The over-all morbidity rate was 28.6 per cent. Long term follow-up was obtained in all 28 patients. All patients in the follow-up group are free of recurrent biliary tract disease. TCDE/S appears to be a safe and effective method of exploring the nondilated common bile duct. 
Measurements of regional cerebral blood flow and blood flow velocity in experimental intracranial hypertension: infusion via the cisterna magna in rabbits. Cerebral blood flow velocity, as measured in the intracranial segment of the internal carotid artery by transcranial Doppler sonography via the transorbital route, and regional cerebral blood flow and volume in corresponding cortical areas, as measured by the hydrogen clearance technique, were recorded for eight New Zealand White rabbits subjected to infusion via the cisterna magna to elevate intracranial pressure. In the lower range of autoregulation, that is, at perfusion pressures between 80 and 40 mm Hg and even lower, the changes in cerebral blood flow velocity and cerebral blood flow showed a strong correlation (0.86) under conditions of standard pCO2 (PaCO2 = 35 +/- 2 mm Hg). Autoregulation was exhausted at 40 mm Hg, and the cerebrovascular resistance was minimal. Below this perfusion pressure, the cerebral blood flow and volume dropped sharply, whereas the cerebrovascular resistance gradually increased, indicating that, despite the maximally dilated resistance vessels, intracranial hypertension causes vascular resistance to increase, possibly via blocking of the venous outflow. Our results confirmed that noninvasive and easily (even at bedside) applicable measurements of changes in cerebral blood flow velocity could be a substitute for the cumbersome and expensive isotope measurements of cerebral blood flow in patients with intracranial hypertension. 
Endoscopic surgery of the vidian nerve. Preliminary report. The anatomy, surgical technique, and difficulties of endoscopic vidian neurectomy are described. The procedure was carried out on 12 patients: 8 had resistant secretomotor rhinopathy and 4 had recurrent nasal polyposis. This technique is a minor surgical procedure with symptomatic relief and minimal postoperative morbidity. 
Implications for research and policy in the treatment of hypertension. Medical considerations. Hypertension, or high blood pressure, is a disease and a risk factor. Cardiovascular risk is directly proportional to the level of blood pressure. Current therapeutic approaches include the classical medical model of detection, evaluation, and drug treatment of high-risk patients who have elevated blood pressure and also a less-well-studied population approach that seeks to manipulate environmental variables in large groups of subjects to reduce blood pressure and subsequent cardiovascular risk. Future research should center on more precise delineation of cardiovascular risk, evaluation of alternative environmental manipulations to reduce blood pressure, enhanced understanding of the pathophysiological mechanisms of hypertension, better matching of antihypertensive drug therapy to pathophysiology, development of new drugs that not only lower blood pressure but also provide additional benefits with minimal side effects, and finally, investigations to further our understanding of the behavioral aspects of the physician-patient encounter, as well as studies on compliance and other issues that influence therapeutic outcome. 
A randomized trial to evaluate the risk of gastrointestinal disease due to consumption of drinking water meeting current microbiological standards. BACKGROUND: This project directly and empirically measured the level of gastrointestinal (GI) illness related to the consumption of tapwater prepared from sewage-contaminated surface waters and meeting current water quality criteria. METHODS: A randomized intervention trial was carried out; 299 eligible households were supplied with domestic water filters (reverse-osmosis) that eliminate microbial and chemical contaminants from their water, and 307 households were left with their usual tapwater without a filter. The GI symptomatology was evaluated by means of a family health diary maintained prospectively by all study families over a 15-month period. RESULTS: The estimated annual incidence of GI illness was 0.76 among tapwater drinkers compared with 0.50 among filtered water drinkers (p less than 0.01). These findings were consistently observed in all population subgroups. CONCLUSION: It is estimated that 35% of the reported GI illnesses among the tapwater drinkers were water-related and preventable. Our results raise questions about the adequacy of current standards of drinking water quality to prevent water-borne endemic gastrointestinal illness. 
Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma presenting as a primary tumor of the liver: presentation, diagnosis and outcome in eight patients. We report the diagnostic, prognostic and therapeutic features of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma in eight patients in whom the disease was seen as a primary tumor of the liver. This series illustrates the variety of situations in which lymphoma might be diagnosed: (a) abdominal pain and hepatomegaly (three cases), (b) incidental finding at evaluation of a patient with cirrhosis (two cases), (c) secondary neoplasm after treatment for Hodgkin's disease (one case) and (d) complication of AIDS (two cases). In most cases, clinical and/or radiological features were nonspecific. However, the combination of the following features must be considered as suggestive: occurrence of an apparently primary hepatic tumor in an immunocompromised patient, absence of the usual serum tumor markers and increased serum lactic dehydrogenase activity. The final diagnosis was based on histological examination of specimens obtained by ultrasonically guided liver biopsies or at surgery. All cases belonged to unfavorable histological subtypes. Immunohistochemical findings on paraffin-embedded sections demonstrated the B-lymphocyte lineage of the seven tumors available for study. In the three patients without coexisting disease, complete remission was obtained by surgery alone or combined with chemotherapy. In the two patients with coexisting cirrhosis, outcome was rapidly unfavorable, with death occurring less than 3 mo after diagnosis. Among the three immunocompromised patients, two experienced a rapid unfavorable outcome, and the remaining one was in complete remission after surgery and chemotherapy. In conclusion, primary non-Hodgkin's lymphoma of the liver arising in patients without coexisting disease has a slow progression and might be successfully treated by surgery. 
The epidemiologic importance of dysentery in communities. This paper explores the epidemiologic importance of dysentery with use of several community studies that demonstrate its prevalence and incidence as well as its association with pathogens, nutritional status, persistent diarrhea, and death. Results of these studies showed that while watery diarrhea was most prevalent in children aged 6-11 months, the prevalence of dysentery peaked between 18 and 23 months of age. Severely stunted children were found to have significantly prolonged episodes of dysentery. Shigella and persistent diarrhea were more frequent in children with dysentery than in those with nonbloody diarrhea. A striking feature was that watery diarrhea, dysentery, persistent diarrhea, and malnutrition each account for less than 5% of all deaths among children aged less than 5 years. However, persistent diarrhea in association with malnutrition causes 13% of deaths in children aged 0-4 years and 27% of deaths in those aged 1-4 years. These data suggest that a more balanced strategy for diarrheal control is required simply because most diarrheal deaths occur among malnourished children with prolonged diarrhea, which is mainly due to dysentery. Results of the studies also suggest that methods to control dysentery in the community should focus on improved hygiene and antimicrobial treatment with use of appropriate algorithms. Recognition of the synergism between dysentery and persistent diarrhea accompanied by malnutrition is crucial in formulating effective programs for control of diarrhea. 
Embolic abscesses in hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia. Hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia is an inherited disorder in which patients may have multiple telangiectases and arteriovenous fistulas in the skin and internal organs. Patients can suffer from a variety of serious clinical complications, including abscess formation. We report two patients in whom neurologic symptoms developed from embolic abscesses, one for whom this complication was fatal. The reported incidence and microbiologic features of this complication are similar to that of endocarditis in patients with valvular heart disease. We believe that patients with hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia should receive similar antibacterial prophylaxis for procedures placing them at risk for bacteremia. 
Cutaneous T-cell lymphoma in patients with human immunodeficiency virus infection The development of cutaneous T-cell lymphoma is unusual in individuals with human immunodeficiency virus type 1 infection. We present four patients with cutaneous T-cell lymphoma and human immunodeficiency virus type 1 infection. Immunophenotyping of lymph node tissue in three of these patients revealed a predominance of T-suppressor cells. Possible causes for the development of cutaneous T-cell lymphoma in the presence of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 infection are discussed. 
Splenic abscesses due to Mycobacterium tuberculosis in patients with AIDS. Among 60 patients with AIDS seen at our institution, two had splenic abscesses due to Mycobacterium tuberculosis without pulmonary tuberculosis. In both cases splenic abscess was the first manifestation of AIDS; the patients had prolonged fever and had lost weight and experienced malaise; slight hepatomegaly was noted in both instances and peripheral lymphadenopathy in one. Chest radiography gave normal results in one case and showed hilar lymphadenopathy in the other. Ultrasonographic findings were characteristic: homogeneous hepatomegaly and splenomegaly, with multiple filling defects of variable size. Diagnosis required splenectomy in one case and biopsy of cervical lymph nodes in the other. In both cases Ziehl-Neelsen staining gave positive results; M. tuberculosis grew from a culture of splenic tissue of one patient and from a culture of lymph nodal tissue of the other. There was a rapid response to antituberculous therapy. Splenic tuberculosis seems to be a distinct extrapulmonary entity in patients with AIDS. Ultrasonographic images are useful for diagnosis and follow-up. 
The clinical spectrum of hypocalcaemia associated with bone metastases. Malignancy-related hypocalcaemia has received less attention in the literature than the opposite perturbation, hypercalcaemia. Only, scarce and contradictory data exist about hypocalcaemia associated with bone metastases (BMH). We have reviewed the clinical records of 155 patients with bone metastases of solid tumours, 122 of which were followed during the whole course of the disease until death. The frequency of hypocalcaemia ranged from 5 to 13%, depending on the formula used to correct calcium values for protein concentration. BMH was almost exclusively limited to patients with osteoblastic metastases. The frequency of BMH among patients with prostate carcinoma was 13-27%, depending on the formula used. Only two of 60 patients with lytic bone lesions presented hypocalcaemia, and in both cases it was rather mild. The development of hypocalcaemia did not seem to imply a worse prognosis, at least in patients with carcinoma of the prostate. Thus, the prevalence of BMH appears to be higher than is usually considered. Adequate attention should be given to this disorder because of the potentially deleterious effects on several organ systems. 
Thalassaemia trait and myocardial infarction: low infarction incidence in male subjects confirmed. A total of 4401 subjects admitted to the Medical Division of St Camillo Hospital in Comacchio (Ferrara, Italy) over a period of 7 years were prospectively evaluated in order to determine whether the heterozygous beta-thalassaemic (HBT) could be considered as a protective factor against the occurrence of acute myocardial infarction (AMI). Of the total patient sample, 3954 subjects were non beta-thalasaemics (NBTs), and 447 subjects were heterozygous beta-thalassaemics (HBTs). AMI was diagnosed in 384 patients, of whom 17 individuals were HBTs and 367 subjects were NBTs. The prevalence of HBTs in this group was significantly lower than expected (4.43%, P less than 0.0001). Furthermore, an analysis by sex showed that this lower prevalence could be attributed to male patients. Moreover, only in male subjects was a significant negative correlation observed between AMI and HBT. The mean age at which AMI occurred in male HBTs was significantly higher than in male NBTs (72 +/- 2.69 vs. 63 +/- 0.7 years, P less than 0.05), while no differences were found in the mean age at which AMI occurred between HBT and NBT female subjects. This study demonstrates that the thalassaemic trait may afford some protection against the occurrence of AMI in men. 
Regional cerebral blood flow following resuscitation from hemorrhagic shock with hypertonic saline. Influence of a subdural mass. After severe hemorrhage, hypertonic saline restores systemic hemodynamics and decreases intracranial pressure (ICP), but its effects on regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) when used for resuscitation of experimental animals with combined shock and intracranial hypertension have not been reported. We compared rCBF changes (by radiolabeled microsphere technique) after resuscitation from hemorrhage with either 0.8 or 7.2% saline in animals with and without a right hemispheric subdural mass. We studied 24 mongrel dogs anesthetized with 0.5% halothane and 60% nitrous oxide. In group 1 (n = 12), hemorrhage reduced mean arterial pressure (MAP) to 45 mmHg for 30 min. In group 2 (n = 12), ICP was increased and maintained constant at 15 mmHg, whereas hemorrhage reduced MAP to 55 mmHg for 30 min (cerebral perfusion pressure [CPP] approximately 40 mmHg in each group). After the 30-min shock period, 6 animals in each group received one of two randomly assigned resuscitation fluids over a 5-min interval: 1) 7.2% hypertonic saline (HS; sodium 1,232 mEq.l-1, volume 6.0 ml.kg-1); or 2) 0.8% isotonic saline (SAL; sodium 137 mEq.l-1, volume 54 ml.kg-1). Once fluid resuscitation began, ICP was permitted to vary independently in both groups. Data were collected at baseline (before subdural balloon inflation in group 2), midway through the shock interval (T15), immediately after fluid infusion (T35), and 60 and 90 min later (T95, T155). In groups 1 and 2, ICP was significantly less in animals resuscitated with HS compared to those receiving SAL (P less than 0.05). 
A randomized clinical trial of alprazolam versus progressive muscle relaxation in cancer patients with anxiety and depressive symptoms. A randomized nonblinded study was performed in three cancer centers to test over a 10-day period the efficacy of (1) a triazolobenzodiazepine, alprazolam, 0.5 mg three times a day and (2) use of a behavioral technique in which patients were trained in progressive muscle relaxation at an initial session with a behavioral psychologist and then asked to listen at home to an audiotape of the session three times a day. Of 147 cancer patients who met entry levels of distress and completed the study, uncontrolled for site or disease stage, 70 were randomized to drug, 77 to relaxation. Four measures of anxiety and depression were used: Covi, Raskin, Affects Balance, and Symptoms Checklist-90 (SCL-90). Results showed that both treatment arms resulted in significant (P less than .001) decrease in observer and patient-reported anxious and depressed mood symptoms. Although both treatment arms were effective, patients receiving the drug showed a slightly more rapid decrease in anxiety and greater reduction of depressive symptoms. These findings confirm efficacy of both alprazolam and relaxation to reduce cancer-related anxiety and depression. As safe, inexpensive, and effective interventions, physicians should consider their use in cancer patients experiencing anxiety and depressive symptoms. 
Detection and localization of prolonged epicardial electrograms with 64-lead body surface signal-averaged electrocardiography. BACKGROUND. Prolonged, fractionated ventricular electrograms often are detectable after myocardial infarction and are a marker for an arrhythmia-prone state. QRS late potentials detected on the body surface with signal-averaged electrocardiography (SAECG) are thought to arise from the diseased tissue that generates prolonged ventricular electrograms and as such are also a marker for arrhythmias. A limitation of the current SAECG technique is that recordings are obtained from only three bipolar lead pairs. Because late potentials probably arise from multiple small sources in the heart, more extensive sampling of the body surface may contribute additional information to the SAECG. The present study investigates the additional sensitivity of SAECG using 64 body surface leads in detecting prolonged epicardial electrograms and examines its use in determining the epicardial location of prolonged electrograms. METHODS AND RESULTS. Dogs were studied before and 5-10 days after either lateral left ventricular (n = 13) or right ventricular (n = 8) myocardial infarction. Greater prolongation of signal-averaged QRS duration was detected with 64-lead SAECG (postinfarction QRS duration, 100.3 +/- 16.3 msec) than with three-lead SAECG (postinfarction QRS duration, 89.4 +/- 10.1, p = 0.0005). Nineteen of the 21 dogs (90%) had prolonged epicardial electrograms detected over the infarct. The correlation between epicardial electrogram duration and signal-averaged QRS duration calculated from individual leads was much better for 64-lead SAECG (r = 0.88, p less than 0.0001) than for three-lead SAECG (r = 0.53, p = 0.01), and the difference was most marked in cases with longer electrogram durations (more than 100 msec). Local late potential maxima on the thorax after lateral left ventricular infarction were located to the left and inferior compared with those after right ventricular infarction (p = 0.006). CONCLUSIONS. SAECG with more extensive recording from the body surface using 64 leads detects greater QRS prolongation than three-lead SAECG, and the longer QRS durations detected correspond to the duration of prolonged epicardial electrograms. Body surface location of late potentials corresponds to the epicardial location of the prolonged electrograms. This application of body surface mapping techniques to SAECG may permit more sensitive detection of arrhythmia-prone states and may aid in identifying arrhythmia sources. 
Role of intraoperative enteroscopy in obscure gastrointestinal bleeding of small bowel origin. Intraoperative enteroscopy was performed in 12 patients (median age 68 years) with obscure gastrointestinal bleeding probably of small bowel origin, six of whom were men. All the patients were evaluated by routine haematological, coagulation and biochemical profiles, upper and lower gastrointestinal endoscopies, visceral angiography and/or isotope scanning. All the patients were anaemic. Visceral angiography was useful on three of the 12 occasions on which it was used and isotope scanning was valuable on eight of the 11 occasions it was used. Nine patients had undergone previous laparotomy. Enteroscopy was performed successfully in all cases, with fresh blood and discrete vascular lesions being the chief findings (10 of 12 cases). Segmental resections (n = 8) and local resections (n = 2) were performed in ten patients, with two patients having more than one laparotomy for rebleeding. Five patients developed postoperative complications and there was an operative death and one late death. Three of the ten surviving patients experienced further rebleeding. Intraoperative enteroscopy is now an essential adjunct to laparotomy for gastrointestinal bleeding which has been localized to the small bowel before operation. 
Prevention of stroke and brain damage with calcium antagonists in animals. In a rat model of embolic stroke (permanent occlusion of the left middle cerebral artery [MCAO]), various 1,4-dihydropyridine calcium antagonists have been shown to attenuate brain damage and the resultant functional impairment when administered after MCAO. Dose-response curves reveal that isradipine is one of the most potent and efficacious representatives of this class of compounds, reducing the infarct size by more than 60%. These results suggest that isradipine, when administered shortly after stroke onset, may have beneficial effects in patients suffering from brain ischemia. When isradipine is used to normalize the high blood pressure in spontaneously hypertensive rats, it will, in addition, also protect the brain from damage engendered by a subsequent stroke. This is not the case if blood pressure is controlled with a calcium antagonist which does not cross the blood-brain barrier, suggesting that the brain protection seen with isradipine is not due to blood pressure normalization. Isradipine, when used as an antihypertensive, appears to have an additional beneficial effect within the brain itself. As high blood pressure is a major risk factor for stroke, such an additional benefit with isradipine would be particularly valuable in antihypertensive therapy. 
A prospective genetic study of complete and partial hydatidiform moles. Two hundred two hydatidiform moles were classified by pathologic features and ploidy into partial or complete moles. Further classification was made by using genetic polymorphism, the diagnosis being refined by deoxyribonucleic acid technology. Among 51 partial hydatidiform moles, 44 triploids, two tetraploids, and one diploid were identified. Informative triploid partial hydatidiform moles had one maternal and two paternal sets of chromosomes, the likely origin being dispermy. Among 149 complete hydatidiform moles, one was haploid, one was triploid, and 105 were shown to be diploid or androgenetic; 39 of these were proved homozygous, indicating duplication of the male genome, whereas heterozygous origin by dispermy was likely in 13. The locus-specific minisatellite deoxyribonucleic acid probes were particularly useful for the identification of heterozygous complete hydatidiform moles. None of the patients with partial hydatidiform moles had development of a gestational trophoblastic tumor. No difference was detected in the frequency of requirement for chemotherapy between patients with homozygous or heterozygous complete hydatidiform moles. 
Pharmacokinetics, immune response, and biodistribution of iodine-131-labeled chimeric mouse/human IgG1,k 17-1A monoclonal antibody. Pharmacokinetics, immunogenicity, and biodistribution of a 131I-labeled mouse/human chimeric monoclonal antibody (C-17-1A) was studied in six metastatic colon cancer patients. Pharmacokinetics obtained from serum radioactivity or chimera concentration were identical after 5 mCi of 131I-C-17-1A with mean alpha half-lives of 17.6 +/- 2.3 and 19.7 +/- 2.9 and mean beta half-lives of 100.9 +/- 16.1 and 106.4 +/- 14.1 hr, respectively. HPLC analysis documented the monomeric chimeric 17-1A without evidence of immune complexes or free 131I. None of the patients developed antibody after 131I-chimeric 17-1A exposure. Radiolocalization occurred in known areas of disease greater than 4 cm in all patients. The half-life of total-body radioactivity was 58 +/- 7 hr by whole-body counts and 64 +/- 13 hr by urine measurements. Whole-body and bone marrow dose estimates ranged from 0.75-1.03 and 0.76-1.05 rad/mCi, respectively. These studies confirm the prolonged circulation and reduced immunogenicity of chimeric 17-1A versus murine 17-1A. Marrow radiation exposure using antibodies with prolonged circulation is a critical factor in planning for radioimmunotherapeutic applications. 
Immunogenetic susceptibility for post-schistosomal hepatic fibrosis. In 19 children with hepatic fibrosis as the result of continued schistosomiasis mansoni and 20 children without hepatic fibrosis, the following studies were carried out: HLA antigen typing for 30 antigens, immune response of T lymphocytes to schistosome antigen by measuring DNA synthesis evidenced by 3H-thymidine uptake, and measurement of total OKT3+, OKT4+, and OKT8+ cells using monoclonal antibodies. Patients with hepatic fibrosis were mostly high responders in contrast with those without fibrosis. High immune response and susceptibility to post-schistosomal hepatic fibrosis were associated with a high frequency of A2 and B12 antigens and a lack of DR2 antigens, while low response was associated with the presence of the DR2 antigen. The T4+:T8+ ratio showed increased suppressor proportions in patients with low immune response and/or with no hepatic fibrosis. We suggest an immunogenetic susceptibility for post-schistosomal hepatic fibrosis, probably controlled by HLA-linked genes via the suppressor T cells. 
Predictors of intracranial carotid artery atherosclerosis. Duration of cigarette smoking and hypertension are more powerful than serum lipid levels. The effect of cigarette smoking on intracranial internal carotid artery atherosclerosis (ICAS) was studied by obtaining cigarette smoking histories and data on other potential predictors, including serum lipid estimations, for consecutive patients undergoing carotid arteriography. The duration of cigarette smoking was the most significant independent predictor of the presence of ICAS. Other independently significant predictors of ICAS were hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and current systolic blood pressure. The interaction of diabetes and duration of smoking was a significant negative predictor. In patients for whom serum lipid values were available, lower levels of apolipoprotein A-I were associated with a higher risk of having ICAS. However, the effect of apolipoprotein A-I as a predictor of the presence of ICAS was far outweighted by the effects of duration of smoking and hypertension. 
The influence of contamination of culture medium with hepatitis B virus on the outcome of in vitro fertilization pregnancies. Heat-inactivated human serum is added to the culture medium used for in vitro fertilization and other forms of assisted conception. Because one batch of pooled serum contained hepatitis B virus, an epidemic occurred among women participating in the treatment program. Seventy-nine women had serologic proof of hepatitis B infection. This incident gave the opportunity to study the effect of hepatitis B virus on pregnancy outcome and the newborn. The situation is unique because the preimplantation embryo was exposed to hepatitis B virus or the pregnancy was complicated by a (sub)clinical infection. Twenty-four women were or became pregnant while having an acute hepatitis B infection. Five pregnancies ended in abortion. The remaining 19 pregnancies ended in the birth of 24 children. No evidence for any harmful effect of exposure to hepatitis B virus in the embryonic or fetal period on the newborn could be found. 
Extensive hepatic granulomas associated with peripheral T-cell lymphoma. A case of T-cell lymphoma presenting with marked hepatosplenomegaly and extensive hepatic granulomas is described. A 55-yr-old female experienced long-term liver damage showing histological triaditis with atypical lymphoid cell infiltration and erythrophagocytosis. The patient developed marked hepatosplenomegaly and eventually died of respiratory failure. Neither systemic lymphadenopathy nor hematological disorder was noted until her death. Autopsy revealed small atypical lymphoid cells positive for T-cell marker, as well as extensive infiltration of generalized organs, including the liver, spleen, and lungs. As a result of diffuse proliferation of atypical lymphoid cell admixed with variable reactive cells, mainly at the T-zone, the lymph nodes underwent effacement of normal architecture; however, the peripheral sinuses and the fibrous capsule remained relatively well preserved. These histological features were consistent with a diagnosis of peripheral T-cell lymphoma (PTL). It is interesting to note that there were numerous epithelioid granulomas admixed with a small number of atypical lymphoid cells within the hepatic parenchyma. The atypical lymphoid cells may be responsible for the granulomatous reaction in the liver. To our knowledge, there have been no other reported cases of PTL that presented with numerous epithelioid granulomas confined to the liver. 
Pregnancy and childbearing in a population with biologic valvular prostheses. Long-term performance of biological prostheses and course of pregnancy, labor, and delivery were evaluated in women less than 35 years of age. Between 1975 and 1987, 87 female patients received a porcine (n = 86) or pericardial valve (n = 1); the mean patient age was 26.8 years, with a range of 8 to 35 years. A total of 17 of these patients experienced 37 pregnancies. A total of 25 babies were delivered, of which 19 were babies of normal birth weight born at term and six were born prematurely (two of these were stillborn). There were six spontaneous abortions and five therapeutic abortions. The mean time from primary operation to first delivery was 29 months. Of the 17 pregnant patients, 14 were in normal sinus rhythm and three were in atrial fibrillation. One of those in fibrillation had a therapeutic abortion while receiving warfarin therapy, and another was successfully delivered of her neonate after 7 months of warfarin therapy. The remaining 15 patients were treated through 35 pregnancies without anticoagulants or antiplatelet agents. Of the total population of 87 patients, 32 (36.8%) were treated for valve-related complications. Structural valve deterioration occurred in eight patients (47.1%) of the pregnancy group and 10 patients (14.3%) of the nonpregnancy group (p less than 0.05). The freedom from structural valve deterioration at 10 years was 23.3% +/- 14% for the pregnancy group and 74.2% +/- 8.5% for the nonpregnancy group (p less than 0.05, age as a determinant, p not significant). There were eight valve-related deaths (1.5%/patient-year). Reoperation was performed in 59% of the pregnancy group and 19% of the nonpregnancy group, primarily for structural valve deterioration manifested as valvular obstruction from aggressive calcification (p less than 0.05). The freedom from reoperation at 10 years parallels freedom from structural valve deterioration (20.3% +/- 12.4% and 64.3 +/- 9.1% for the pregnancy and nonpregnancy groups, respectively, with p less than 0.05; with age added as a determinant, p not significant). The overall reoperative mortality was 8.7% (two patients). The biologic prostheses afforded successful pregnancy without fetal wastage or congenital anomalies and without significant maternal morbidity or mortality. 
Mechanisms of platelet activation: thromboxane A2 as an amplifying signal for other agonists. Thromboxane (Tx) A2 is a product of cyclooxygenase catalyzed metabolism of arachidonic acid. It is formed via prostaglandin (PG) endoperoxide intermediates (PGG2 and PGH2) by a specific synthase. PGH2 appears to exert the same biologic effects as TxA2. The cDNA for a TxA2 receptor has been cloned from a human placental library. Although pharmacologic and biochemical studies suggest the presence of multiple isoforms, this remains to be confirmed at the molecular level. A hydropathy plot of the deduced amino acid sequence of the available clone suggests that it has 7 transmembrane spanning domains, typical of a G protein linked receptor. Pharmacologic studies imply that Tx receptors in platelets are linked to phospholipase C activation via pertussis toxin insensitive G proteins. Candidates include the 42 kD Gq and the 60 kD Ge. TxA2 acts as an amplifying signal for platelet agonists and the response to this eicosanoid is tightly regulated. Mechanisms include rapid hydrolysis of the agonist to the inactive TxB2, autoinactivation of Tx synthase, rapid homologous TxA2 receptor desensitization due to receptor-G protein uncoupling, coincidental sensitization to counterregulatory Gs linked receptor systems and stimulation of prostacyclin formation by TxA2. Due to its role as an amplification signal in platelet activation, inhibition of Tx synthesis and action is an effective mechanism for preventing platelet-dependent vascular occlusion. Aspirin is of proven efficacy in this regard. Tx synthase inhibitors and antagonists are under clinical investigation. 
Risk factors for stroke in patients with nonrheumatic atrial fibrillation: a case-control study. PURPOSE: Randomized controlled trials have demonstrated that anticoagulant therapy is very effective at preventing stroke among patients with nonrheumatic atrial fibrillation. However, these trials have reported too few strokes for powerful risk factor analysis. Observational studies may provide additional information. The purpose of this study was to identify risk factors in a larger number of patients with stroke and nonrheumatic atrial fibrillation, using case-control methodology. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We identified all patients discharged from one hospital over an 8-year period who met our case definition of nonrheumatic atrial fibrillation and ischemic stroke (n = 134), and compared them with contemporaneous control subjects who were discharged with nonrheumatic atrial fibrillation without stroke (n = 131). RESULTS: Cases and controls were similar in terms of duration of atrial fibrillation; proportion with paroxysmal atrial fibrillation; percentage with a past medical history of angina, myocardial infarction, congestive heart failure, diabetes, or smoking; and mean left atrial size. In contrast, cases were significantly older than controls (78.5 versus 74.8 years, p = 0.002) and more likely to have a history of hypertension (55% versus 38%, p = 0.0093). The relative odds for stroke was 1.91 for patients with hypertension, 1.73 for patients older than 75 years, and 3.26 for patients with both factors. CONCLUSIONS: Our analysis suggests that age and hypertension should be considered when deciding upon long-term anticoagulant therapy to prevent stroke in patients with nonrheumatic atrial fibrillation. 
The relationship of pain and deformity of the rheumatoid foot to gait and an index of functional ambulation. We evaluated the relationships among pain, structural deformity of the foot, 4 variables of gait, and an index of functional ambulation in 31 patients with rheumatoid arthritis. We saw significant correlations between the ambulation index and all gait variables (p less than 0.005). For the group as a whole, pain in the foot did not correlate with structural deformity. However, when patients were grouped according to the relative preponderance of pain or deformity and duration of disease, we found correlations between the sites of pain and deformity. Pain in the lower extremity, and the knee or hindfoot separately, showed correlations with functional ambulation. Foot deformity did not correlate with functional ambulation at all. Foot pain correlated well with velocity and especially stride length (p less than 0.005), and not as well with cadence and double stance time. Fewer correlations were seen between foot deformity and gait. In general, hindfoot disease was associated with greater impairment of gait and mobility than forefoot disease. 
Effect of intravenous infusion of atriopeptin 3 on immediate renal allograft function. Thirty-eight recipients of nineteen pairs of cadaveric kidneys were entered into a double-blind randomized study in which one recipient received a 12-hour intravenous infusion of Atriopeptin III (AP-3), a synthetic analogue of atrial natriuretic factor, commencing at release of the vascular clamps, and the other received a placebo infusion. In an initial dose ranging study, successive groups of six kidneys (3 pairs) were randomized to receive each of 0.0125, 0.025, 0.05 micrograms/kg/min AP-3 or placebo. Thereafter 20 kidneys (10 pairs) received 0.1 micrograms/kg/min or placebo. There was no discernable effect of AP-3 on allograft creatinine clearance or sodium excretion either when the highest dose of AP-3 was considered alone or when all doses were considered together. Averaged creatinine clearance over the period 0 to 24 hours after transplantation was 20.1 +/- 14.7 ml/min in patients receiving active treatment and 18.2 +/- 13.7 ml/min in those receiving placebo. Thus, despite the documentation of a protective effect of atrial natriuretic factor in animal models of renal ischemia, it is unlikely that intravenous infusion of AP-3 in this dose range will be of benefit in improving immediate renal allograft graft function. 
Effect of dietary ethanol on gallbladder absorption and cholesterol gallstone formation in the prairie dog. Dietary ethanol has been reported to protect against cholesterol gallstone formation. Because enhanced gallbladder absorption of water is important in cholesterol cholelithiasis, we examined the hypothesis that ethanol acts by inhibiting the absorptive function of the gallbladder. Eighteen adult male prairie dogs were fed a lithogenic liquid diet containing 0.4% cholesterol. Half of the animals received 30% of total calories as ethanol, whereas their pair-fed controls received equicaloric amounts of maltose-dextrin. After 3 months, the gallbladders were inspected for gallstones and crystals, and gallbladder and hepatic bile were analyzed. Cholesterol stones and crystals were present in all nine controls. None of the alcohol-fed animals had stones, but four had cholesterol crystals. Gallbladder cholesterol, phospholipids, and total calcium were significantly decreased in alcohol-fed animals. In both gallbladder and hepatic bile, the cholesterol saturation index was significantly lower in alcohol-fed animals, as was the ratio of trihydroxy to dihydroxy bile salts. The ethanol-supplemented diet produced a significant decrease in the absorption of water by the gallbladder as indicated by changes in the gallbladder bile to hepatic bile ratios of the total bile salt concentration (7.29 +/- 1.25 versus 3.84 +/- 0.56; p less than 0.05) and the total calcium (3.37 +/- 0.24 versus 2.43 +/- 0.29; p less than 0.05). These findings indicate that the protective effect of ethanol may be related to its ability both to inhibit gallbladder absorption of water and to alter the composition of biliary lipids. 
High protein intake promotes the growth of hepatic preneoplastic foci in Fischer #344 rats: evidence that early remodeled foci retain the potential for future growth. The effects of successive administration, withdrawal and readministration of high protein diets (20% casein) on the promotional growth, remodeling and regrowth of aflatoxin B1-induced preneoplastic liver lesions (foci) were examined. Weanling male Fischer 344 rats were given 10 intragastric doses of aflatoxin B1 at a level of 250 micrograms/kg body weight over a 2-wk dosing period (initiation). The subsequent 12-wk period was subdivided into four feeding periods, each lasting 3 wk (promotion). Two groups of rats were fed either a 20 or 5% casein diet during all four periods; additional groups were alternately fed these diets in different sequences. Switching from the high protein diet to a low protein diet (5% casein) resulted in marked remodeling (regression) of the growing lesions to a response level similar to that in animals that did not receive the initial promotional stimulus of high protein feeding. However, refeeding the high protein diet caused significant reappearance of these lesions. The restimulated development of these remodeled lesions far exceeded lesion growth in animals receiving only the late promotional stimulus of high dietary protein. Thus, these data suggest that a second occurrence of high protein feeding promotes the growth of remodeled foci, thus demonstrating their potential for future promotional growth. 
Difference in mortality between patients treated with captopril or enalapril in the Xamoterol in Severe Heart Failure Study The double-blind, placebo-controlled, multinational trial Xamoterol in Severe Heart Failure randomized 290 patients treated with captopril and 217 treated with enalapril to xamoterol or placebo. At the end of the 100-day follow-up period, the cumulative probability of survival in patients with coronary artery disease or with dilated cardiomyopathy decreased in the captopril group (90.3%) when compared with the enalapril group (97.2%). The excess mortality in the captopril group could not be related to the indexes of the severity of heart failure, such as baseline exercise duration, functional class, cardiothoracic ratio, ejection fraction or dose of diuretic drugs. Furthermore, the excess in mortality was seen in all subsets of patients examined as well as across countries. Examination of the dosing regimen used, however, suggests that insufficient daily dosage of captopril or the inadequate schedule of administration, or both, might be responsible for different degrees of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibition between the enalapril and captopril groups and hence for the difference in mortality. It is important in future clinical trials to determine to what extent complete circadian angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibition is necessary to provide the full benefit of this therapy in heart failure. 
A comparison of the effects of ipratropium bromide and metaproterenol sulfate in acute exacerbations of COPD. Thirty-two patients presenting with acute exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease were entered into the following double-blind, crossover study. First (time 0), patients inhaled either ipratropium bromide (54 micrograms) or metaproterenol sulfate (1.95 mg) via a metered dose inhaler (MDI) attached to a device (Inspirease) (phase 1). After 90 minutes, they inhaled whichever of the two medications they had not received in phase 1. This is referred to as phase 2. Pulmonary function (FEV1 and FVC) was measured at time 0, and at 30, 60, and 90 minutes following phase 1 treatment, and at 30, 60, and 90 minutes following phase 2 treatment (120, 150, and 180 minutes from the start of the study). Arterial blood gas samples (n = 20) were obtained at entry into the study and 30 and 90 minutes after phase 1 medication. The groups did not differ in age, degree of airway obstruction, hypoxemia, or theophylline usage at the start of the study. In phase 1, at 90 minutes, pulmonary function in both groups significantly and similarly improved. For ipratropium, FEV1 improved from 0.62 +/- 0.08 L to 0.88 +/- 0.11 L (p less than 0.01) and for metaproterenol FEV1 improved from 0.69 +/- 0.06 to 0.92 +/- 0.09 L (p less than 0.01). There was no further improvement with phase 2 treatment for either group. Thirty minutes after inhaling ipratropium, there was a small but significant rise in PO2 (5.8 +/- 3.0 mm Hg; p less than 0.05) while metaproterenol inhalation resulted in a 6.2 +/- 1.2 mm Hg decline in PO2 (p less than 0.05). These changes were not sustained at 90 minutes. We concluded that for acute exacerbations of COPD, both ipratropium and metaproterenol are effective medications when administered via an MDI attached to a device (Inspirease). However, ipratropium may be a safer choice as it initially did not cause a decline in blood oxygenation. 
Effect of superoxide dismutase on infarct size and postischemic recovery of myocardial contractility and metabolism in dogs The effects of superoxide dismutase treatment on infarct size, postischemic recovery of contractile function and tissue content of high energy phosphates were examined in a canine model of myocardial ischemia and reperfusion. Ischemia was induced by thrombotic occlusion of a coronary artery and reperfusion was achieved by intravenous thrombolysis. Average duration of ischemia was 90 min. Fifty closed chest anesthetized dogs were randomized to receive either superoxide dismutase (34,000 IU/min intravenously) or placebo, starting approximately 30 min before and continuing for 30 min into the reperfusion phase. Left ventricular ejection fraction and regional segmental shortening of the postischemic area were calculated from contrast angiograms after 4 h, 48 h and 1 week of reperfusion. Tissue content of high energy phosphates was determined from transmural biopsy after 4 h and 1 week. Infarct size was measured by planimetry of dye-stained heart slices. In the superoxide dismutase and placebo-treated groups, respectively, the mortality rate was 25% and 16%, collateral flow 20 +/- 10 and 23 +/- 18 ml/min per 100 g, area at risk 25 +/- 6% and 26 +/- 7% of the left ventricle and infarct size 28 +/- 19% and 36 +/- 27% of the area at risk. Multiple regression analysis failed to show any beneficial effect of superoxide dismutase treatment on infarct size. Left ventricular ejection fraction, regional segmental shortening of the postischemic area and tissue content of high energy phosphates recovered to a similar extent and at a similar rate in both treated and placebo groups up to 1 week after reperfusion. Thus, in this model of coronary occlusion and reperfusion superoxide dismutase treatment is of no benefit. 
Endoscopic therapy for early colon cancer: the strip biopsy resection technique. Strip biopsy is an endoscopic tissue resection technique in which a lesion and its surrounding tissues are first elevated using physiological saline. The saline solution is injected into the submucosa at the site of the lesion with the help of needle forceps. A snare is placed around the elevated tissue, which is then resected endoscopically by electrocoagulation. The specimen obtained includes both submucosal and mucosal tissues. The authors used this technique to resect a total of 71 lesions of the colon. They were classified histologically as 21 adenocarcinomas, 46 adenomas, 3 metaplastic polyps, and 1 juvenile polyp. All lesions were confirmed to be entirely intramucosal by histological examination. The strip biopsy technique permits resection of tissue down to the submucosal layer regardless of the morphological type of the lesion. This suggests that strip biopsy is an effective new form of endoscopic treatment for early colon cancer. 
Millipore analysis of valvular fluid in sterile valve malfunctions. Malfunctions of sterile shunts may result from valvular dysfunction. The cerebrospinal fluid shunt valves of 14 patients were excised during surgery for sterile shunt malfunctions. In 6 patients, the malfunction was due specifically to a valve malfunction. Cerebrospinal fluid from each valve was passed through a millipore filter, which was then stained using either hematoxylin and eosin or periodic acid-Schiff. The stained millipore filters were examined by a neuropathologist who was unaware of the cause of the shunt malfunction. Although inflammatory cells were detected in all cases, the patients with valve malfunctions were found to have numerous macrophages and giant multinucleated reactive cells within their valves, while cerebrospinal fluid from valves that had been removed during shunt revisions for reasons other than a malfunctioning valve contained only rare mononuclear cells or macrophages. No valve contained erythrocytes, fibrinous matter, neural or glial tissue, or choroid plexus. The possible causes of valve malfunction, including infection and allergic reactions, are discussed. All patients did well after simple replacement of the valve. 
Comparison of long-term survival of 1986 consecutive patients with breast cancer treated at the National Cancer Institute of Milano, Italy (1971 to 1972 and 1977 to 1978). Long-term survival of 1986 consecutive patients with infiltrating duct carcinoma of the breast treated at the National Cancer Institute of Milano (Italy) in two periods of time (1971 to 1972 and 1977 to 1978) was comparatively evaluated to verify if the evolving concepts in the management of breast cancer had an impact on survival. The authors found that 10-year survival of our patients increased from 59.4% of the first period of time to 65% of the second (P = 0.005). Both node-negative (N-) and node-positive (N+) patients had an improvement of survival rates at 10 years of the same magnitude: 6.8% and 5.9% respectively. Taking into consideration both the maximum diameter of the primary tumor and the status of axillary nodes it was found that in (1) both N- and N+ patients with a primary tumor of no more than 2 cm in greatest diameter, the improvement of survival was not statistically significant; and (2) both N- and N+ patients with a primary greater than 2 cm in maximum diameter had a better chance of survival in the second time period. 
Intravascular stents in the management of superior vena cava syndrome. Superior vena cava syndrome can be effectively palliated with the use of intravascular stents. Adjunctive modalities which may be utilized prior to stent placement are thrombolytic therapy and balloon angioplasty. Six patients with an underlying malignancy were treated with these modalities. Complete resolution of symptoms occurred in five patients, and partial resolution occurred in the sixth. Two of the patients who had initial, complete resolution of symptoms had recurrences. One involved rethrombosis of the superior vena cava which occurred twice and required percutaneous thrombectomy, and the second involved restenosis requiring a percutaneous transluminal angioplasty of the SVC just distal to the stent. Both of these patients with second procedures, again, had complete resolution of symptoms. Intravascular stents are a valuable additional treatment of superior vena cava syndrome. 
Grading diabetic retinopathy from stereoscopic color fundus photographs--an extension of the modified Airlie House classification. ETDRS report number 10. Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study Research Group. The modified Airlie House classification of diabetic retinopathy has been extended for use in the Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study (ETDRS). The revised classification provides additional steps in the grading scale for some characteristics, separates other characteristics previously combined, expands the section on macular edema, and adds several characteristics not previously graded. The classification is described and illustrated and its reproducibility between graders is assessed by calculating percentages of agreement and kappa statistics for duplicate gradings of baseline color nonsimultaneous stereoscopic fundus photographs. For retinal hemorrhages and/or microaneurysms, hard exudates, new vessels, fibrous proliferations, and macular edema, agreement was substantial (weighted kappa, 0.61 to 0.80). For soft exudates, intraretinal microvascular abnormalities, and venous beading, agreement was moderate (weighted kappa, 0.41 to 0.60). A double grading system, with adjudication of disagreements of two or more steps between duplicate gradings, led to some improvement in reproducibility for most characteristics. 
Linkage of a gene causing familial amyotrophic lateral sclerosis to chromosome 21 and evidence of genetic-locus heterogeneity [published errata appear in N Engl J Med 1991 Jul 4;325(1):71 and 1991 Aug 15;325(7):524] BACKGROUND. Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis is a progressive neurologic disorder that commonly results in paralysis and death. Despite more than a century of research, no cause of, cure for, or means of preventing this disorder has been found. In a minority of cases, it is familial and inherited as an autosomal dominant trait with age-dependent penetrance. In contrast to the sporadic form of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, the familial form provides the opportunity to use molecular genetic techniques to localize an inherited defect. Furthermore, such studies have the potential to discover the basic molecular defect causing motor-neuron degeneration. METHODS AND RESULTS. We evaluated 23 families with familial amyotrophic lateral sclerosis for linkage of the gene causing this disease to four DNA markers on the long arm of chromosome 21. Multipoint linkage analyses demonstrated linkage between the gene and these markers. The maximum lod score--5.03--was obtained 10 centimorgans distal (telomeric) to the DNA marker D21S58. There was a significant probability (P less than 0.0001) of genetic-locus heterogeneity in the families. CONCLUSIONS. The localization of a gene causing familial amyotrophic lateral sclerosis provides a means of isolating this gene and studying its function. Insight gained from understanding the function of this gene may be applicable to the design of rational therapy for both the familial and sporadic forms of the disease. 
Syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion in cancer of the head and neck. The syndrome of inappropriate secretion of arginine vasopressin (AVP) known as the syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion (SIADH) is characterized by hyponatremia that results from water retention attributable to persistent AVP release. It may occur in a variety of malignant and nonmalignant lesions, with small cell or oat cell carcinoma of the lung by far responsible for the largest number of these cases. Cancer of the head and neck may be a rare cause of SIADH, and only a few such cases have been reported. We describe four patients with advanced cancer of the head and neck region with coexisting SIADH. Diagnosis and treatment are reported and the literature is reviewed. The possible occurrence of SIADH in the head and neck surgical practice should be kept in mind. Since SIADH is usually transient, water restriction and parenteral sodium chloride may be sufficient in overcoming the acute phase. 
Spontaneous contrast in the pericardial sac caused by gas-forming organisms. Purulent pericarditis is a life-threatening disease associated with a variety of microorganisms. The case presented herein has unusual manifestations of contrast echoes on two-dimensional echocardiography. To our knowledge, this is the first reported case of pericarditis caused by gas-forming group D Streptococcus and Klebsiella pneumoniae with pyopericardium, resulting in contrast echoes on the two-dimensional echocardiographic image. 
Validating studies for panic disorder in patients with angiographically normal coronary arteries. This article describes validating studies for diagnosing panic disorder in some patients with angiographically normal coronary arteries (NCA) and chest pain. Psychiatric interviews of 94 such patients showed that 34% met the diagnostic criteria for panic disorder. Further studies showed that NCA patients with panic disorder were more disabled at 3.5-year follow-up, had more relatives with panic disorder, were more likely to suffer from major depression, and were more likely to respond to 35% CO2 challenge with panic symptoms. Because panic disorder is highly disabling but responds well to psychological and pharmacologic treatments, screening NCA patients in the cardiology population for this disorder is recommended. 
Recurrence and treatment of urinary bladder cancer after failure in radiotherapy. One hundred fifty-five patients with urinary bladder cancer who were not suitable for radical surgery were treated with full-course radiotherapy, 6600 cGy in 9 weeks, split-course. After the treatment recurrences were observed in 94 patients (60%), 49 (53%) were treated with transurethral surgery and intravesical cytostatics, local surgery, systemic cytostatics, or palliative radiotherapy. The median survivals for the patients were 33, 10, 4, and 2.4 months, respectively. The outcome of treatment for radiotherapy failures was related to the nature of the failure, ureteric obstruction, the recurrence rate, and the mode of treatment. Shrinkage of the bladder was observed in 15 patients (16%). The occurrence of bladder shrinkage was related to the increase in frequency of recurrences and of different types of treatments. 
Immunohistochemical evaluation of uveal melanocytic tumors. Expression of HMB-45, S-100 protein, and neuron-specific enolase. The authors compared the immunohistochemical reactivity of 13 uveal nevi and 20 uveal melanomas for HMB-45, S-100 protein, and neuron-specific enolase (NSE) in formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded sections. All 33 of the lesions were positive for HMB-45. The false-negative rates for S-100 protein and NSE were 21% and 18%, respectively. If only strongly positive reactions were considered, more than 50% of the tumors would be interpreted as negative for S-100 protein and NSE. Nevi stained with less intensity than melanomas using all three antibodies. The expression of HMB-45 appeared to be greater in active nevi than in inactive nevi. There was a weak association between S-100 protein reactivity and the ability of the uveal melanomas to metastasize (P = 0.1); however, the standard deviation of nucleolar area was a much better predictor (P = 0.02). These results indicate that pathologists will find HMB-45 to be a useful tool in differentiating uveal melanoma from nonmelanocytic tumors. 
Prevention of thromboembolic disease following total knee arthroplasty. Epidural versus general anesthesia. Seventy-two patients were randomized into a prospective clinical trial to evaluate the effects of epidural (EA) versus general anesthesia (GA) on the incidence of thromboembolic disease (TED) following total knee arthroplasty (TKA). Males received aspirin 650 mg po bid and females low-dose warfarin daily to maintain the prothrombin time at 15 to 16 seconds for pharmacologic prophylaxis against TED. Thirty-four patients had EA and 38 GA for their primary TKA. Contrast venography and ventilation-perfusion scanning were performed on the sixth, seventh, and eighth postoperative days, and these were interpreted in a blinded fashion. The mean age of the 45 males and 27 females was 64 years (range, 42-84 years). There were no significant differences between the two groups with respect to hematocrit, operative time, blood loss, number of units transfused, or hospital stay. Twelve of the 34 patients (35%) receiving an EA and 10 of the 38 patients (26%) receiving GA developed TED, an overall incidence of 31% (p greater than 0.05) Fifty-three percent of the clots were located in the popliteal vein above the trifurcation or more proximal. However, the incidence of proximal vein thrombosis was significantly less in patients receiving an EA (46%) rather than a GA (64%). The incidence and distribution of clots was not affected by the type of pharmacologic prophylaxis, gender, or use of methylmethacrylate. Ten percent of the patients had a positive scan by strict criteria and were thought to have a pulmonary embolism (PE). In patients with a femoral vein clot, the incidence of PE was 67%. One bleeding complication occurred in a patient who took double the appropriate warfarin dose. 
Management of bleeding liver tumours in Hong Kong. A retrospective study was undertaken of 41 patients diagnosed as having suffered spontaneous liver rupture over a 4-year period to identify the clinical features, treatment and outcome of this complication in an area in which hepatocellular carcinoma is endemic. Two patients were excluded with a revised diagnosis of haemorrhagic malignant ascites. Of the remaining 39 patients, 37 bled from ruptured hepatocellular carcinoma, one from peliosis hepatis and multiple liver cell adenomas, and one from a malignant hepatic epithelioid haemangioendothelioma. Analysis showed that 59 per cent of patients were in shock on admission and that all but two of the 37 patients with ruptured hepatocellular carcinoma were men with cirrhosis. The association with cirrhosis was significantly higher than in a series of 45 patients with hepatocellular carcinoma undergoing elective resection during the same period (P less than 0.05). Treatment consisted of supportive care only in two patients, angiographic embolization in four, emergency liver resection in 11 of whom six died, hepatic artery ligation in 12 of whom eight died, and suture and/or packing in eight of whom six died. One patient died at laparotomy and in another patient bleeding was successfully arrested by intratumoural injection of absolute alcohol. Because of the high operative mortality of emergency surgery in these poor risk patients, prospective evaluation of emergency angiographic embolization is required. 
Autonomic dysfunction in alcoholic cirrhosis: relationship to indicators of synthetic activation and the occurrence of renal sodium retention. We investigated the occurrence of alcoholic autonomic dysfunction in patients with alcoholic cirrhosis in order to define its prevalence and relationship to renal sodium retention. Forty-seven alcoholics and 16 age-matched normal subjects were evaluated. Thirty-seven patients had liver disease (13 with and 24 without ascites), and 10 patients had normal hepatic function. Autonomic nervous system function was ascertained by skin sudomotor responses and the response of blood pressure and plasma norepinephrine concentration to upright tilt (sympathetic nervous system function), and by heart rate responses to deep breathing, Valsalva maneuver, and upright tilt (parasympathetic and sympathetic nervous system function). Heart rate responses to deep breathing and Valsalva maneuver were diminished, and skin sudomotor responses were significantly worse, in alcoholics than in control subjects. Alcoholic patients also had significantly lower supine mean arterial pressure (93 +/- 10 vs. 116 +/- 8 mm Hg, p less than or equal to 0.0001), and significantly greater increases in arterial pressure during passive upright tilt, than control subjects (mean increase 6.5 +/- 6.6 vs. 0.1 +/- 1.6 mm Hg, p = 0.0003). All of these findings were present to similar degrees in patients with and without liver disease and in cirrhotic patients with and without ascites. Supine heart rates, however, differed among the groups evaluated. Heart rate was significantly greater in patients with cirrhosis than in alcoholic patients without liver disease (83 +/- 11 vs. 71 +/- 13 bpm, p = 0.006), and in patients with ascites than in patients without ascites (88 +/- 12 vs. 80 +/- 10 bpm, p = 0.04). Plasma norepinephrine concentration was elevated in most patients with cirrhosis and was significantly higher in patients with ascites than in patients without ascites (789 +/- 238 vs. 388 +/- 185 pg/ml, p less than 0.0001; nl range: 65-320 pg/ml). Autonomic nervous system function is similarly impaired in alcoholics with and without liver disease. Patients with cirrhosis also have increased heart rate and elevated plasma norepinephrine concentration, abnormalities that are most pronounced in patients with sodium retention. Their is uncertainty as to the stimulus for norepinephrine release, and its source, in these patients. However, the similarity of supine blood pressure in patients with and without ascites and the occurrence of orthostatic hypertension rather than orthostatic hypotension following upright tilt suggest that arterial underfilling is not responsible. 
Hypogonadotropic hypogonadism and temporal lobe epilepsy. The concomitant finding of hypogonadotropic hypogonadism and temporal lobe epilepsy raises the issue of whether or not these entities are related. The case presented herein is one such example. The possible pathophysiologic basis of infertility and temporal lobe epilepsy is reviewed. 
Atrial fibrillation associated with autonomic dysreflexia in patients with tetraplegia. Atrial fibrillation is an arrhythmia characterized by disorganized atrial depolarizations and an irregular ventricular response. Most patients with atrial fibrillation have underlying cardiac pathology. This paper presents the cases of three patients with high-level spinal cord injury and symptoms of autonomic dysreflexia who developed atrial fibrillation without any cardiac or metabolic disease that would predispose them to this. The paper proposes that autonomic dysreflexia might predispose a patient to atrial fibrillation by altering the pattern of repolarization of the atria, making the heart susceptible to a reentrant type of arrhythmia. High-level spinal cord injured patients may be at increased risk for the development of atrial fibrillation, an arrhythmia which, if left untreated, can increase the incidence of an embolic cerebrovascular accident that could further impair the patient's functional status. 
Reaction of human non-collagenous polypeptides with coeliac disease autoantibodies. We identified and purified six human noncollagenous protein molecules that specifically bind to serum IgA from patients with coeliac disease, and which as a combination can act as true antigen to reticulin antibodies. In affinity chromatography, the purified human protein molecules removed antibodies against reticulin and endomysium from serum samples of coeliac disease patients. We postulate that an autoimmune mechanism operates in generating the jejunal damage in gluten-sensitive enteropathy and that the human protein molecules described here act as self-antigens in the disease. 
Stress-induced elevations of gamma-aminobutyric acid type A receptor-active steroids in the rat brain. A 3 alpha-hydroxy A-ring-reduced metabolite of progesterone, 3 alpha-hydroxy-5 alpha-pregnan-20-one (allopregnanolone), and one of deoxycorticosterone (DOC), 3 alpha,21-dihydroxy-5 alpha-pregnan-20- one (allotetrahydroDOC), are among the most potent known ligands of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) receptors designated GABAA in the central nervous system. With specific radioimmunoassays, rapid (less than 5 min) and robust (4- to 20-fold) increases of allopregnanolone and allotetrahydroDOC were detected in the brain (cerebral cortex and hypothalamus) and in plasma of rats after exposure to ambient temperature swin stress. Neither steroid was detectable in the plasma of adrenalectomized rats either before or after swim stress. However, allopregnanolone, but not allotetrahydroDOC, was still present in the cerebral cortex (greater than 3 ng/g) after adrenalectomy. These data demonstrate the presence of allopregnanolone and allotetrahydroDOC in brain and show that acute stress results in a rapid increase of these neuroactive steroids to levels known to modulate GABAA receptor function. 
Granulomatous peritonitis and appendicitis of food starch origin. Two patients with food starch granulomatous reactions, one a necrotising granulomatous peritonitis after the perforation of a gastric ulcer and the other a non-necrotising granulomatous appendicitis, are described. The possibility of food starch induced inflammation must be considered in the differential diagnosis of granulomatous diseases of the gastrointestinal tract. 
Early spontaneous hematoma in cerebral infarct: is primary cerebral hemorrhage overdiagnosed? We identified 15 patients (63 +/- 8 years) in whom CT showed no bleeding within 6 hours of stroke onset but showed ganglionic or lobar hemorrhage less than 18 hours later, without visible underlying infarct (early spontaneous intra-infarct hematoma [ESIH]). No patient had antithrombotic therapy or a coagulation disorder, but eight had hypertension. The second CT was prompted by rapid worsening (in 10) or because the first CT was not available (in five). Prior transient ischemic attacks, silent infarcts on CT, and a potential cardiac source of embolism were more common in patients with ESIH than in 200 patients with primary cerebral hemorrhage (PCH) admitted during the same period. Distal occlusions were present in four of five patients who underwent intracranial studies within the first 2 days. Most of these patients probably had embolism with early and extensive bleeding in the ischemic area. Our findings suggest that ESIH may be under-recognized, while PCH may be overdiagnosed. 
Temper tantrums. Temper tantrums are a normal response to anger and occur commonly in the child between one and four years of age. They arise from the child's thwarted efforts to exercise mastery and autonomy. Tantrums occur more frequently in the active, determined child who has abundant energy. Parenting practices that may encourage tantrums include inconsistency, unreasonable expectations, excessive strictness, overprotectiveness and overindulgence. Boredom, fatigue, hunger or illness may reduce the child's tolerance for frustration. Management consists of teaching the parents to understand the underlying meaning of tantrums and to modify parental behaviors that may perpetuate or accentuate the problem. Temper tantrums are best handled by ignoring the outburst, offering nurturance to the child after the tantrum has subsided and helping the child learn to express negative feelings in more acceptable ways. 
Importance of bile acid structure in amelioration of griseofulvin-induced murine protoporphyric hepatopathy. This study investigated the effects of bile acid structure on griseofulvin-induced murine hepatopathy and explored the mechanism(s) of cholestasis in this model of protoporphyria. Mice were fed pulverized chow with cholate, chenodeoxycholate, or ursodeoxycholate, with or without griseofulvin. After 1 to 4 weeks, bile flow, bile acid excretion and composition, biliary protoporphyrin excretion, hepatic protoporphyrin contents, liver histology, and griseofulvin plasma concentrations were determined. Additionally, bile acid absorption was measured. Griseofulvin induced a progressive increase in liver weight, hepatic protoporphyrin content, and histopathologic evidence of cholestasis. Biliary protoporphyrin excretion increased and pigmented gallbladder microliths developed. Bile flow and bile acid excretion fell in relation to liver weight but not in relation to body weight. Cholic acid augmented biliary protoporphyrin excretion, markedly reduced hepatic protoporphyrin content, and obviated the development of intrahepatic biliary thrombi. Ursodeoxycholate and chenodeoxycholate both reduced biliary protoporphyrin excretion. This was associated with bile acid compositional changes, particularly a fall in cholic acid. Although histopathologic abnormalities were not altered, these bile acids reduced hepatic protoporphyrin contents. Bile acid treatments with griseofulvin all increased bile flow and bile acid excretion relative to controls, but differences in the relationship of bile flow to bile acid structure on protoporphyrin disposition. They document biliary excretion as the principal mode of cholic acid amelioration of griseofulvin-induced hepatopathy. They also suggest distinctive roles for griseofulvin and protoporphyrin in the generation of the cholestasis. 
The hypotensive activity of Crotalus atrox (western diamondback rattlesnake) venom: identification of its origin. Viperidae snakes belonging to the genus Crotalus, subfamily Crotalinae, include the species durissus terrificus, durissus durissus, adamanteus, atrox, cerastes, horridus, molossus, scutulatus, viridis and others. All of them, except for the first 2, are found in North America. Crotalus atrox, or diamondback rattlesnakes, live in the southwest United States and in Mexico. This paper describes the fractionation of C. atrox venom in order to isolate and identify its hypotensive agents. 
A controlled trial comparing foscarnet with vidarabine for acyclovir-resistant mucocutaneous herpes simplex in the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome. The AIDS Clinical Trials Group. BACKGROUND AND METHODS. Most strains of herpes simplex virus that are resistant to acyclovir are susceptible in vitro to both foscarnet and vidarabine. We conducted a randomized trial to compare foscarnet with vidarabine in 14 patients with the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) and mucocutaneous herpetic lesions that had been unresponsive to intravenous therapy with acyclovir for a minimum of 10 days. The patients were randomly assigned to receive either foscarnet (40 mg per kilogram of body weight intravenously every 8 hours) or vidarabine (15 mg per kilogram per day intravenously) for 10 to 42 days. In the isolates of herpes simplex virus we documented in vitro resistance to acyclovir and susceptibility to foscarnet and vidarabine. RESULTS. The lesions in all eight patients assigned to foscarnet healed completely after 10 to 24 days of therapy. In contrast, vidarabine was discontinued because of failure in all six patients assigned to receive it. The time to complete healing (P = 0.01), time to 50 percent reductions in the size of the lesions (P = 0.01) and the pain score (P = 0.004), and time to the end of viral shedding (P = 0.006) were all significantly shorter in the patients assigned to foscarnet. Three patients had new neurologic abnormalities while receiving vidarabine. No patient discontinued foscarnet because of toxicity. Although initial recurrences of herpes simplex infection after the index lesion had healed tended to be susceptible to acyclovir, acyclovir-resistant infection eventually recurred in every healed patient, a median of 42.5 days (range, 14 to 191) after foscarnet was discontinued. CONCLUSIONS. For the treatment of acyclovir-resistant herpes simplex infection in patients with AIDS, foscarnet has superior efficacy and less frequent serious toxicity than vidarabine. Once the treatment is stopped, however; there is a high frequency of relapse. 
Rapid localization of indium-111-labeled inhibited recombinant tissue plasminogen activator in a rabbit thrombosis model. The thrombus localizing properties of indium-111-recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (111In-rt-PA) have been investigated in an effort to achieve prompt and accurate detection of thrombi. Unlike previous studies with rt-PA, the active plasminogen catalytic site was permanently inhibited with peptides of chloromethyl ketone so that the radiotracer binds to fibrin without causing fibrinolysis. Thrombi were created in the external jugular vein of 14 male New Zealand white rabbits followed by injection of 111In-rt-PA. The agent cleared rapidly in vivo with a half-time of 4.6 min. The thrombus: blood ratio in nonheparinized rabbits (n = 7) was 6.39 +/- 0.86. The ratio in heparinized rabbits (n = 4) was 3.11 +/- 0.23. Thrombi were clearly visible in the planar images of both groups 1 hr postinjection. The combination of rapid thrombus localization and positive images, especially in the presence of anticoagulation, suggests that further work is warranted with rt-PA thrombus imaging. 
Occurrence of resting tremor in Parkinson's disease. Several previous studies have noted that resting tremor (RT) is absent in 10% to 30% of idiopathic Parkinson's disease (IPD) patients. We report our 22-year observations in 47 pathologically verified parkinsonian patients. In all the IPD cases with median follow-up of 3.7 years, RT was noted on at least one evaluation. Among other parkinsonian syndrome variants characterized by widespread subcortical pathology with median follow-up of 2.86 years, RT was seen in 31% of the cases. Our data indicate that the sites typically involved in IPD are sufficient to produce RT. 
Diagnosis and management of purulent pericarditis. Experience with pericardiectomy. Twelve cases of purulent pericarditis seen over 6 years are described. Staphylococcus aureus was the most common causative organism (six patients), and a respiratory infection was the most common preceding illness. The chest radiograph and echocardiogram were useful pointers to the diagnosis, but the electrocardiogram was not reliable. Antibiotics, surgical drainage, and pericardiectomy were used in all 12 cases. There was one death (8.3%), which occurred in a patient who was seen late. A review of the literature dealing with the diagnosis and management of this condition is presented. The importance of early diagnosis before a significant degree of cardiac tamponade occurs is noted. Although there is general agreement that surgical drainage is mandatory, the approach, methods of drainage, and extent of pericardial resection have been the subject of some discussion, and at least seven techniques are available. We conclude that pericardiectomy has a definite place in the management of purulent pericarditis. 
Recurrence of hepatitis C virus infection after orthotopic liver transplantation. Identification of the hepatitis C virus--the main cause of posttransfusion and sporadic non-A, non-B hepatitis--and the development of a diagnostic serological test have allowed us to study possible recurrence of this type of hepatitis after liver transplantation. Six of 34 consecutive transplant recipients were found to have had antibodies to hepatitis C before transplantation. All six patients had possible exposure to hepatitis C through blood transfusion or intravenous drug use. Five of the six patients were positive for antibodies to hepatitis C after 1 yr of follow-up. Two of these patients had clinical and histological evidence of acute viral hepatitis in their allografts. In one patient this led to hepatic injury and dysfunction of two successive grafts. In contrast, none of the twenty-eight patients who were seronegative for hepatitis C virus antibodies before transplantation has converted to seropositivity after transplantation despite perioperative blood transfusions. These results suggest that hepatitis C diagnosed serologically recurs in a minority of transplant recipients and that de novo seroconversion must be uncommon. 
Fingerstick glucose determination in shock. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the accuracy of fingerstick glucose measurements in severely hypotensive patients. DESIGN: Prospective, nonrandomized comparison study. SETTING: Emergency department in a university hospital. PATIENTS: Twenty-five severely hypotensive patients (systolic blood pressure less than or equal to 80 mm Hg) and 39 normotensive patients. MEASUREMENTS: Simultaneous fingerstick reagent strip glucose, venous reagent strip glucose, and laboratory glucose values were compared. Data were analyzed using error-grid analysis. RESULTS: In hypotensive patients, the mean fingerstick glucose values were significantly lower than the values obtained either by venous reagent strip or laboratory glucose measurements. Fingerstick glucose values in the hypotensive group were 67.5% of laboratory glucose values, and were significantly lower than the values obtained in the normotensive group (91.8%, P less than 0.001). Only 36% of the hypotensive patients had fingerstick glucose values within the acceptable range of 20% of the laboratory glucose value. Thirty-two percent of hypotensive patients were incorrectly diagnosed as hypoglycemic (glucose less than 3.89 mmol/L [70 mg/dL]); 2 of these patients were actually hyperglycemic (glucose greater than 11.10 mmol/L [200 mg/dL]). Venous reagent strip measurements accurately reflected laboratory glucose values in both hypotensive and normotensive patients. CONCLUSIONS: Fingerstick glucose testing does not accurately represent venous glucose levels in severely hypotensive patients. If fingerstick glucose testing is relied on for these patients, errors in clinical management may be made. Venous reagent strip glucose testing correlates well with laboratory glucose measurements and should be the preferred method for rapid assessment of glucose level in critically ill patients with severe hypotension. 
Tinnitus suppression by cochlear implants. The beneficial effects of cochlear implants on tinnitus have been noted in several studies, but few detailed appraisals of the phenomenon have been made. Six patients fitted with the UCSF/Storz cochlear implant device were studied. The effects of use of the implant device on tinnitus were monitored, and suppression of tinnitus was tracked throughout periods of stimulation and poststimulation. Tinnitus was effectively suppressed in five of six patients with the device on and with noise input, and reduction of perceived tinnitus loudness occurred in four of six with the device on but without acoustic input to the speech processor. Unilateral stimulation frequently resulted in bilateral tinnitus suppression. These studies reveal that profound tinnitus suppression is obtained by patients using their cochlear implants. Further work is required to quantify the optimal mode of stimulation, but these findings suggest that tinnitus sufferers may ultimately benefit from development of electrical stimulation tinnitus suppression devices. 
Successful treatment of hepatosplenic candidiasis with a liposomal amphotericin B preparation. The case of a granulocytopenic patient with acute undifferentiated leukaemia and hepatosplenic candidiasis who was refractory to conventional deoxycholate amphotericin B (AmpB) and 5-flucytosine therapy is reported. He experienced severe AmpB-related side-effects, and was subsequently successfully treated with a pharmaceutical preparation of AmpB (5.7 g) entrapped in sonicated liposomes, composed of lecithin, cholesterol and stearylamine in a molar ratio of 4:3:1. Three months later, during maintenance chemotherapy, liposomal AmpB (5.1 g) was reinstituted due to the finding of biopsies positive for Candida albicans at bronchoscopy. After healing of the patient's fungal infection a left upper lobe resection was performed, which showed advanced fibrosis with signs of inflammation, but no evidence of fungal disease. Since no acute side-effects and only moderate hypokalaemia were observed, it appears that liposomal AmpB is superior to conventional AmpB treatment in granulocytopenic patients with hepatosplenic candidiasis and unbearable therapy-related side-effects. 
Localization of metallothionein in hair follicles of normal skin and the basal cell layer of hyperplastic epidermis: possible association with cell proliferation. Metallothionein is a low-molecular-weight metal-binding protein. Although it is inducible by a variety of agents and ubiquitously present in many tissues, its physiologic functions are still not clear. The present study was undertaken to determine the possible functions of metallothionein in both the proliferation and differentiation of epidermal keratinocytes. Metallothionein was detected immunohistochemically in hair matrix cells of the bulb and cells of the outer root sheath of anagen hair follicles, but not in dermal papillae in normal skin in the back of mice. In hyperplastic epidermal tissue, induced by either a phorbol ester tumor promoter or cholera toxin, the basal cells of the interfollicular epidermis stained strongly for metallothionein. Elevated expression of mRNA of the metallothionein gene was also demonstrated when the skin was stimulated by agents that induced hyperplasia. Papillomas produced by two-stage carcinogenesis protocols also stained for metallothionein. These observations suggest that metallothionein is involved in the proliferation of epidermal keratinocytes. 
Syndrome X and hyperventilation. The cardiorespiratory responses to exercise and forced hyperventilation were measured in 17 unselected patients with syndrome X (angina, positive exercise test, normal coronary arteriogram, no other cardiovascular disease) and compared with those in 15 healthy subjects. Forced hyperventilation produced hypocapnia and metabolic alkalosis but no chest pain or electrocardiographic change. Patients with syndrome X showed reduced maximum oxygen consumption with an increased respiratory exchange ratio at peak exercise, confirming that exercise was limited by skeletal muscle perfusion--and thus that the increase in cardiac output with exercise is limited in syndrome X as in heart failure. Arterial carbon dioxide tension (PCO2) homoeostasis during exercise was normal but the ventilatory cost of carbon dioxide excretion was increased in syndrome X (as in heart failure). End tidal PCO2 measurements correlated only poorly with arterial PCO2 in individual patients with syndrome X, providing a possible explanation for previous reports, based on end tidal PCO2 of inappropriate hyperventilation. Patients with syndrome X did not show inappropriate hyperventilation but they did show hyperventilation that was appropriate to maintain normal arterial PCO2 in the face of reduced cardiac reserve. 
Postoperative sepsis: reexplore or observe? Accurate indication from diagnostic abdominal paracentesis. OBJECTIVE: To determine if postoperative diagnostic abdominal paracentesis is a useful clinical tool in the abdominal evaluation of the critically ill septic patient. DESIGN: Retrospective review. SETTING: Surgical ICU patients in a Veterans Administration medical center. PATIENTS: Ten patients were studied from a total of 1,053 patients admitted to the surgical ICU between September 1985 and May 1989. INTERVENTIONS: Diagnostic abdominal paracentesis performed by the open or closed approaches. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Results are presented in three patient groups (A, B, and C): Group A (n = 4) had positive diagnostic abdominal paracentesis. Abdominal causes for the sepsis were found at reexploration. One of these four patients survived. Group B (n = 3) had negative diagnostic abdominal paracentesis. No abdominal septic source was found at reexploration; all three patients died. In group C (n = 3), diagnostic abdominal paracentesis was negative, patients were not reexplored, and all survived. Diagnostic accuracy correlated with three variables: a) the gross appearance and smell of the fluid, b) WBC count greater than 5000 or less than 500/mm3, and c) Gram stain demonstrating bacterial organisms. CONCLUSIONS: Diagnostic abdominal paracentesis proved accurate, reliable, simple, safe, and rapid in evaluating the abdomen in the postoperative septic patient. The use of this procedure should be considered in postoperative septic patients in whom an abdominal source for the sepsis needs to be excluded. 
A single intravenous infusion of gamma globulin as compared with four infusions in the treatment of acute Kawasaki syndrome BACKGROUND. Treatment of acute Kawasaki syndrome with a four-day course of intravenous gamma globulin, together with aspirin, has been demonstrated to be safe and effective in preventing coronary-artery lesions and reducing systemic inflammation. We hypothesized that therapy with a single, very high dose of gamma globulin would be at least as effective as the standard regimen. METHODS. We conducted a multicenter, randomized, controlled trial involving 549 children with acute Kawasaki syndrome. The children were assigned to receive gamma globulin either as a single infusion of 2 g per kilogram of body weight over 10 hours or as daily infusions of 400 mg per kilogram for four consecutive days. Both treatment groups received aspirin (100 mg per kilogram per day through the 14th day of illness, then 3 to 5 mg per kilogram per day). RESULTS. The relative prevalence of coronary abnormalities, adjusted for age and sex, among patients treated with the four-day regimen, as compared with those treated with the single-infusion regimen, was 1.94 (95 percent confidence limits, 1.01 and 3.71) two weeks after enrollment and 1.84 (95 percent confidence limits, 0.89 and 3.82) seven weeks after enrollment. Children treated with the single-infusion regimen had lower mean temperatures while hospitalized (day 2, P less than 0.001; day 3, P = 0.004), as well as a shorter mean duration of fever (P = 0.028). Furthermore, in the single-infusion group the laboratory indexes of acute inflammation moved more rapidly toward normal, including the adjusted serum albumin level (P = 0.004), alpha 1-antitrypsin level (P = 0.007), and C-reactive protein level (P = 0.017). Lower IgG levels on day 4 were associated with a higher prevalence of coronary lesions (P = 0.005) and with a greater degree of systemic inflammation. The two groups had a similar incidence of adverse effects (including new or worsening congestive heart failure in nine children), which occurred in 2.7 percent of the children overall. All the adverse effects were transient. CONCLUSIONS. In children with acute Kawasaki disease, a single large dose of intravenous gamma globulin is more effective than the conventional regimen of four smaller daily doses and is equally safe. 
Natural history and effectiveness of aspirin in asymptomatic patient with cervical bruits. The Asymptomatic Cervical Bruit Study Group. We report a multicenter study in progress involving a prospective follow-up of asymptomatic patients with cervical bruits. The project consists of two components. All patients meeting clinical criteria for eligibility undergo duplex ultrasonography at the time of entry into the study. Those with a carotid stenosis of 50% or greater are enrolled in a randomized placebo-controlled trial of aspirin. All other patients are followed up in a natural history study, also involving biannual clinical and duplex ultrasonographic examinations. Both clinical and anatomic outcomes are assessed. The project consists of a 3-year accrual phase and a 3-year follow-up phase with completion planned for May 1994. Total anticipated enrollment is 588 patients. 
Severe late postsplenectomy infection. In all, 1490 patients underwent splenectomy in Western Australia between 1971 and 1983, giving 7825 person years exposure. Thirty-three patients developed severe late postsplenectomy infection (septicaemia, meningitis or pneumococcal pneumonia requiring hospitalization) and three developed overwhelming postsplenectomy infection. The incidence and mortality rates of severe late postsplenectomy infection were 0.42 and 0.08 per 100 person years exposure respectively and for overwhelming postsplenectomy infection the incidence and mortality rates were 0.04 per 100 person years exposure. There were 628 splenectomies after trauma, giving 3922 person years exposure. Eight patients developed severe late postsplenectomy infection of whom one had overwhelming postsplenectomy infection. Following trauma, the incidence of severe late postsplenectomy infection was 0.21 per 100 person years exposure, with the incidence and mortality rates of overwhelming postsplenectomy infection being 0.03 per 100 person years exposure. Patients undergoing splenectomy have a 12.6-fold increased risk of developing late septicaemia compared with the general population. Splenectomy following trauma gives an 8.6-fold increased risk of late septicaemia. The majority of severe late postsplenectomy infections did not occur within the first 2 years and 42 per cent of severe late postsplenectomy infections occurred greater than 5 years after splenectomy. The low incidence of severe late postsplenectomy infection and overwhelming postsplenectomy infection makes statistical evaluation of the effectiveness of prophylactic antibiotics, vaccination and splenic repair most difficult. 
Risk of neoplasia and malignancy in "dominant" thyroid swellings. OBJECTIVE--To determine the risk of neoplasia and malignancy in "dominant" thyroid swellings. DESIGN--Prospective analysis during six years. SETTING--Thyroid clinic serving the Grampian region. PATIENTS--574 consecutive patients presenting with a discrete thyroid swelling, of whom 179 (31%) were classified clinically as having a dominant area of enlargement within a multinodular gland. RESULTS--After clinical and cytological assessment 77 dominant swellings were excised. Of the excised swellings, 45 were non-neoplastic and 32 neoplastic, including 11 malignant lesions. The minimum incidence of neoplasia and malignancy in all 179 dominant swellings was therefore 18% and 6% respectively. CONCLUSION--Dominant thyroid swellings should be regarded with greater clinical suspicion than has been traditional. 
Idazoxan treatment in progressive supranuclear palsy. To confirm the preliminary report that increases in norepinephrine neurotransmission improve motor performance, we administered the investigational drug idazoxan (IDA) to nine patients with progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP) according to a double-blind crossover protocol. There were seven women and two men, whose mean age was 70 years and mean duration of illness 4 years. All had an advanced parkinsonian syndrome, supranuclear ocular motor palsies, and poor responses to dopaminergic drugs. During administration of 40 mg tid of IDA, the total score and the motor subscale score of the United Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale significantly decreased. Features that improved most included mobility, balance, gait, and measures of digital dexterity. There were no significant changes in any measure during placebo administration. Corticobulbar manifestations and eye movements were not significantly improved during treatment. Side effects of IDA included transient hypertension, tachycardia, action tremor, flushing, and sweating, but none was so severe that any patient withdrew from the study. Among the few attempted treatments of PSP, IDA is the first medication shown in a double-blind study to improve aspects of motor function. 
Clinical characteristics of acromegalic patients whose pituitary tumors contain mutant Gs protein. Activating mutations in the gene for the alpha-chain of Gs, the stimulatory regulator of adenylyl cyclase, have been identified in human GH-secreting pituitary tumors. Using the polymerase chain reaction and allele-specific oligonucleotide hybridization, we screened 25 GH-secreting tumors for the presence of the activating mutations. We also reviewed the clinical charts of the patients from whom the tumors were removed. Of 25 tumors, 10 (40%) contained activating mutations. Patients in the mutation-positive group came to surgery with smaller tumors and had lower GH levels. The activating mutations identify a subgroup of GH-secreting pituitary tumors that probably arise from a shared oncogenic mechanism. 
Peak expiratory flow rate and the acute chest syndrome in homozygous sickle cell disease. The peak expiratory flow rate (PEFR) was studied in 20 matched pairs of children with homozygous sickle cell disease with either no episodes or six or more episodes of acute chest syndrome. The pairs were carefully matched for height and a highly significant reduction in PEFR was observed in children with multiple episodes of acute chest syndrome. Lateral and anteroposterior chest diameters and chest circumference correlated with PEFR but did not differ between index and control cases. The most likely cause of the reduced PEFR in children with multiple episodes of acute chest syndrome is an accumulating pulmonary fibrosis that decreases lung compliance. 
Induction of the protooncogene c-fos and recovery of cytosolic adenosine triphosphate in reperfused liver after transient warm ischemia: effect of nitrone free-radical spin-trap agents. Ischemia and reperfusion stimulate several adenosine triphosphate (ATP)-dependent processes involving release of substances including free radicals. This cellular response is mediated through receptors responsive to transcriptional products of gene expression; c-fos acts as a transcriptional factor involved in the regulation of genes associated with cellular proliferation and differentiation. We hypothesized that nitrone free-radical spin traps promote restoration of cytosolic ATP during reperfusion and prevent c-fos induction. Four control rats had no ischemia. Global hepatic ischemia was induced in 19 rats in four groups: saline solution, phenyl-N-tert-butyl nitrone (PBN), alpha 1-pyridyl-N-oxide N-tert-butyl nitrone (POBN), and 5,5-dimethyl-1-pyrroline-N-oxide (DMPO). ATP and intracellular pH were measured at intervals before, during, and after ischemia. At 90 minutes of reperfusion, liver c-fos mRNA was measured. A fourfold elevation of c-fos occurred in the saline-treated group (p less than 0.001). PBN and POBN groups did not differ from the saline group. DMPO resulted in significantly less induction of c-fos than did NS. ATP depletion and recovery in all treatment groups was similar to that of the saline group. We conclude that (1) nitrone spin traps do not prevent c-fos induction or alter the pattern of ATP recovery after hepatic ischemia and reperfusion and (2) c-fos induction is not necessary for restoration of ATP, but the rate of ATP restoration is inversely related to c-fos induction. 
Anaesthesia-free extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy in patients with renal calculi. Modern extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy can be performed with combined ECG and respiratory triggered shock wave release. Disconnecting the ECG triggering increases the risk of ventricular arrhythmias, including potentially malignant ones. The aim of this study was to assess the relationship of any sympatho-adrenal excitation as a possible explanation for the occurrence of cardiac arrhythmia. Plasma catecholamine levels were assessed in 5 patients during and after 50 min of anaesthesia-free extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy for the treatment of calculi in the upper pole of the left kidney. Venous blood sampling showed no significant increase in catecholamines (epinephrine, norepinephrine and dopamine) during or after treatment. The heart rate and arterial blood pressure were measured simultaneously and showed no significant increase when shock waves were released during ECG triggering. However, when disconnecting the ECG-triggering mode, the incidence of ventricular extrasystoles on Holter monitoring became more apparent during respiratory triggered shock wave release only, although there was no rise in plasma catecholamine levels. These data suggest that cardiac arrhythmias are related to direct and accidental mechanical stimulation of the heart rather than to any sympatho-adrenal discharge during shock wave release. 
Intracisternal recombinant tissue plasminogen activator after aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage. Fifteen patients undergoing surgery within 48 hours of aneurysm rupture were administered recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (rt-PA) directly into the basal subarachnoid cisterns after minimal surgical clot removal and aneurysm clipping. Preoperatively, 13 patients had diffuse or localized thick subarachnoid blood clots on computerized tomography (CT), and two had diffuse thin clots. The rt-PA was given as a single intraoperative injection of 7.5 mg (one patient), 10 mg (nine patients), or 15 mg (five patients). Postoperative cisternal drainage was employed in three patients. All patients except one demonstrated partial to complete cisternal clot clearance on CT scans within 24 hours after surgery. The patient who showed no clot reduction was the only patient in this series to develop symptomatic vasospasm and was the only fatality, dying 8 days after rupture. No vasospasm was seen on follow-up cerebral angiography in six of the 14 responding patients, and mild-to-moderate arterial narrowing was seen in at least one major cerebral artery in the remaining eight patients. Severe angiographic vasospasm was not seen, although the patient who died did not undergo repeat angiography. There was one major complication early in the series which seemed clearly related to treatment, and that was a large extradural hematoma occurring within several hours of craniotomy. Intrathecal fibrinolytic treatment appears effective in clearing subarachnoid clot and reducing vasospasm, and may be associated with acceptable risks if given to patients with large-volume subarachnoid hemorrhages at high risk for severe vasospasm. 
Coronary atherosclerotic plaques with and without thrombus in ischemic heart syndromes: a morphologic, immunohistochemical, and biochemical study. We investigated incidence, severity, and distribution of coronary atherosclerosis, acute thrombosis, and plaque fissuring in ischemic heart disease (both unstable-acute syndromes and chronic ischemia) and in nonischemic controls. We also studied the structural, immunohistochemical, and biochemical profile of plaques, with and without thrombus, including morphometry, immunophenotyping of inflammatory infiltrates, cytokine presence, and ultrastructural features. Critical coronary stenosis was almost the rule in both acute and chronic ischemic series (greater than 90%) whereas it reached 50% in control subjects. Thrombosis was principally characteristic of unstable-acute ischemic syndromes (unstable angina, 32%; acute myocardial infarction, 52%; cardiac sudden death, 26%) but was also found in chronic ischemia (stable angina, 12%; ischemic cardiomyopathy, 14%) and in control subjects (4%). Plaque fissuring without thrombus occurred in low percentages in lipid-rich, severe eccentric plaques in most series. Major differences were found between pultaceous-rich versus fibrous plaques rather than between plaques with or without thrombus. Pultaceous-rich plaques were frequent in sites of critical stenosis, thrombosis, and ulceration. Inflammatory infiltrates, i.e., T cells, macrophages, and a few beta cells, mostly occurred in lipid-rich, plaques unrelated to thrombus. In adventitia, infiltrates were a common finding unrelated to any syndrome. Necrotizing cytokines such as alpha-TNF were immunohistochemically detected in macrophages, smooth muscle, and intimal cells and detected by immunoblotting in 67% of pultaceous-rich plaques, either with or without thrombus. Immune response mediators such as IL-2 were also expressed in analogous plaques but in a minor percentage (50%-40%). Media were extensively damaged in severely diseased vessels with and without thrombus. Ultrastructural study showed that the fibrous cap was either highly cellular or densely fibrillar. Intimal injury with collagen exposure was often associated with platelet adhesion, whereas foamy cell exposure was not. In conclusion, investigated parameters were essentially similar in plaques, both with and without thrombus, whereas major differences were found between pultaceous-rich and fibrous plaques. Since platelets adhere to exposed collagen and not to foam cells, the type of exposed substrates could play a major role in thrombosis. 
Gastroesophageal reflux, as measured by 24-hour pH monitoring, in 509 healthy infants screened for risk of sudden infant death syndrome. Continuous long-term esophageal pH monitoring has become the preferred test to quantify acid gastroesophageal reflux. Because reflux to a limited extent is physiologic, the determination of optimal thresholds to separate normal from abnormal reflux is mandatory. Esophageal pH was measured during 24 hours in 509 healthy thriving infants, aged 3 days to 1 year, using a glass microelectrode with an external reference electrode connected to a portable recorder. Percentiles of the four parameters studied (reflux index or percent of the investigation time with a pH less than 4, number of episodes with a pH less than 4 during 24 hours, number of episodes lasting greater than 5 minutes, the duration of the longest episode (in minutes) are presented. A percentile curve of the reflux index regarding the age distribution shows that the normal range for the reflux index during the first 12 months of life is about 10% (95 percentile), decreasing from 13% at birth to 8% at 12 months. Application of an age-related percentile curve offers a close-to-reality possibility of data interpretation and illustrates that there is inevitably an overlap of data between normal and abnormal populations, because reflux is a phenomenon occurring to some extent in every human being. 
Role of nitric oxide in renal medullary oxygenation. Studies in isolated and intact rat kidneys. We investigated the role of the endothelial-derived relaxing factor nitric oxide (NO) in the homeostasis of O2 supply to the renal medulla, a region normally operating on the verge of hypoxia. Sensitive Clark-type O2 microelectrodes were inserted into renal cortex and medulla of anesthetized rats. The inhibitor of NO formation, L-NG-monomethylarginine (LNMMA), while increasing blood pressure and reducing renal blood flow, decreased medullary pO2 from 23 +/- 3 mmHg to 12 +/- 3 (P less than 0.001), with no change in the cortex. These responses were promptly reversed by L-arginine, which bypasses the LNMMA blockade. In isolated rat kidneys, LNMMA reduced perfusion flow without altering glomerular filtration rate, and augmented deep medullary hypoxic injury to thick ascending limbs from 68 to 90% of the tubules (P less than 0.02). These changes were prevented by L-arginine. Nitroprusside had a protective effect upon thick limb injury. Finally, in a previously reported model of radiocontrast nephropathy (1988. J. Clin. Invest. 82:401), LNMMA increased the severity of renal failure (final plasma creatinine from 2.3 +/- 2 mg% to 3.4 +/- 3, P less than 0.005) and the proportion of damaged thick limbs (from 24 +/- 6% to 53 +/- 9, P less than 0.01). Nitrovasodilatation may participate in the balance of renal medullary oxygenation and play an important role in the prevention of medullary hypoxic injury. 
Intrarenal hemodynamics in patients with essential hypertension. Intrarenal hemodynamics were estimated clinically in essential hypertension. Two-week studies were performed in 30 patients with essential hypertension who were given a regular sodium diet in the first week and a sodium-restricted diet in the second week. Intrarenal hemodynamic parameters such as afferent arteriolar (preglomerular) resistance, efferent arteriolar resistance, and glomerular hydrostatic pressure were calculated from renal clearances and plasma total protein concentration measured on the last day of the regular sodium diet. Calculations were based on Gomez's equations with the assumption that the gross filtration coefficient of glomerular capillaries was normal. The increase in afferent arteriolar resistance (8,100 +/- 500 dyne.sec.cm-5) was significantly correlated with an elevation in mean arterial pressure (120 +/- 2 mm Hg), whereas glomerular pressure (56 +/- 1 mm Hg) and efferent arteriolar resistance (2,500 +/- 100 dyne.sec.cm-5) remained normal. The renal function curve (pressure-natriuresis relation) was drawn by plotting urinary sodium excretion on the y axis as a function of mean arterial pressure on the x axis, both of which were measured on the last 3 days of each week. The extrapolated x intercept (107 +/- 2 mm Hg) of the renal function curve was strongly correlated in a 1:1 fashion with the sum of the arterial pressure drop from the aorta to the renal glomeruli plus the opposing pressures against glomerular filtration at glomeruli (r = 0.7, p less than 0.001) on the regular sodium diet, suggesting that the difference between mean arterial pressure on the regular sodium diet and the extrapolated x intercept represented the effective filtration pressure across the glomerular capillaries on the regular sodium diet. 
Identity of rearranged LINE/c-MYC junction sequences specific for the canine transmissible venereal tumor. The canine transmissible venereal tumor is a naturally occurring neoplastic disease that affects the external genitalia of both sexes and is transmitted during coitus. Cytogenetic and immunologic studies demonstrated that tumors from different parts of the world are very similar, suggesting that they are transferred from one animal to another by the transplantation of viable cells. We found that the c-MYC oncogene was rearranged in this tumor by the insertion of a transposable genetic element sequence (known as LINE, long interspersed element) 5' to the first exon. The amplification of a DNA segment located in the junction of the LINE genome and c-MYC upstream sequences enabled the testing of the similarity of transmissible venereal tumor samples collected independently in different parts of the world. Oligonucleotide primers flanking the LINE/c-MYC junction were used to amplify a 340-base-pair segment and nested primers amplified a 280-base-pair segment. A fifth oligonucleotide used as a probe contained the actual junction sequence. All of the tumors analyzed revealed the existence of the specific bands, which were absent in normal canine DNA samples. The amplified segments obtained from all of the tumors analyzed were identical in size and nucleotide sequence, suggesting transmission of the original rearranged cell itself, as opposed to independent events of LINE insertion in a "hot spot.". 
Short-term oral zinc supplementation does not improve chronic hepatic encephalopathy. Results of a double-blind crossover trial. The effect of short-term oral zinc supplementation (zinc sulfate 600 mg/day) on hepatic encephalopathy, was assessed in a double-blind, crossover trial. Fifteen cirrhotic patients with stable, chronic hepatic encephalopathy were randomized to receive either oral zinc or a placebo for 10 days. Following a two-week washout period, these were crossed over to the alternate treatment. Conn's index, which comprises the evaluation of the mental state, asterixis, number connection test, EEG record, and plasma ammonia, was used to score the degree of hepatic encephalopathy, both at the beginning and end of each treatment period. Serum zinc was significantly raised after oral zinc administration and reached the levels observed in cirrhotics without hepatic encephalopathy. Despite this, however, no modification in the parameters included in Conn's index were observed. In conclusion, this study failed to confirm that short-term oral zinc supplementation improves chronic hepatic encephalopathy. 
Lymphoepithelioma-like carcinoma of the lung. Historically lymphoepithelioma was a term used to describe an undifferentiated mucosal carcinoma with a lymphocytic component arising only from the nasopharynx, although recently, lymphoepithelioma-like carcinoma has been found to occur as a primary tumor of the lung. Thus far, five patients have been documented as having this rare anatomical presentation. The patient that is being presented is the latest case of lymphoepithelioma-like carcinoma of the lung and will be compared clinically and histologically with the other four cases. The case is presented in order to discuss optimal methods of diagnoses and treatment for this condition. 
Helicopter transport of the patient with acute burns. Helicopter transportation of acutely injured or ill patients has become common practice at most major medical centers. However, its specific effectiveness in the transportation of acute-condition patients with burns has never been critically assessed. This study, for the period 1984 through 1988, evaluated the use of the helicopter for transportation of acute-condition patients with burns to a regional burn center for a rural area. It is concluded that helicopter transport within a 180-mile radius in a non-hospital-based system is not appreciably faster than is ambulance transport, and does not clinically benefit most burned patients. Consideration such as safety, cost, and working space are discussed. It is recommended that at least one of three criteria be met before helicopter transfer is considered for patients with burns: the surface area involved should be enough to require a formal fluid resuscitation, an inhalation injury should be present or suspected, or there should be a possible need for an escharotomy. 
Chemotherapy with 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) and cisplatin or 5-FU, cisplatin, and vinblastine for advanced non-small cell lung cancer. A randomized phase II study of the cancer and leukemia group B. Two hundred forty-seven patients with previously untreated nonresectable non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) were entered in a prospective, randomized Phase II trial. Response assessment was possible in 232 patients, and 237 patients were evaluable for survival. Thirteen partial responses (11%) and 5 regressions (4%) of evaluable disease were obtained for the 116 patients treated with 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) and cisplatin (C) (95% confidence interval [CI], 8.5% to 21.5%). The median time to progression was 2.2 months and the median survival time was 4.6 months for 5-FU plus C. Twenty-three partial responses (20%) and 4 regressions (3%) of evaluable disease were obtained for the 116 patients treated with 5-FU, C, and vinblastine (V) (95% CI, 15.3% to 30.7%). The median time to progression was 2.8 months and the median survival time was 5.6 months for 5-FU, C, and V. The 5-FU and C doses were equivalent in the two treatment regimens. Sixteen of 85 patients (19%) with a performance status of 0 and 18 of 103 patients (17%) with a performance status of 1 responded, whereas only 2 of 44 patients (5%) with a performance status of 2 or greater responded (P = 0.009). Patients who had received locoregional radiation therapy had a lower overall response rate then those in the no prior radiation therapy group (P = 0.028). The median survival time for patients with a performance status of 0 or 1 was 6.3 months compared with 1.9 months for patients with a performance status of 2 or greater (P less than 0.001). Performance status also appeared to be a significant factor for time to progression. More frequent and severe leukopenia, fever, genitourinary (GU) toxicity, and pulmonary toxicity was reported with 5-FU, C, and V. There were three treatment-related deaths with 5-FU, C, and V and one treatment-related death with 5-FU plus C. Grade III/VI myelotoxicity was not influenced by prior radiation therapy or performance status. Neither regimen is active enough to be considered as standard therapy for advanced NSCLC. 
Type I human T cell leukemia virus tax protein transforms rat fibroblasts through the cyclic adenosine monophosphate response element binding protein/activating transcription factor pathway. The Tax oncoprotein of the type I human T cell leukemia virus (HTLV-I) activates transcription of cellular and viral genes through at least two different transcription factor pathways. Tax activates transcription of the c-fos proto-oncogene by a mechanism that appears to involve members of the cAMP response element binding protein (CREB) and activating transcription factor (ATF) family of DNA-binding proteins. Tax also induces the nuclear expression of the NF-kappa B family of rel oncogene-related enhancer-binding proteins. We have investigated the potential role of these CREB/ATF and NF-kappa B/Rel transcription factors in Tax-mediated transformation by analyzing the oncogenic potential of Tax mutants that functionally segregate these two pathways of transactivation. Rat fibroblasts (Rat2) stably expressing either the wild-type Tax protein or a Tax mutant selectively deficient in the ability to induce NF-kappa B/Rel demonstrated marked changes in morphology and growth characteristics including the ability to form tumors in athymic mice. In contrast, Rat2 cells stably expressing a Tax mutant selectively deficient in the ability to activate transcription through CREB/ATF demonstrated no detectable changes in morphology or growth characteristics. These results suggest that transcriptional activation through the CREB/ATF pathway may play an important role in Tax-mediated cellular transformation. 
Management of persistent or recurrent urinary incontinence after placement of artificial urinary sphincter. A rational systematic approach is presented in the evaluation of 14 men with persistent or recurrent urinary incontinence after placement of the AMS800 artificial urinary sphincter. Mechanical malfunctions, including device leaks and control assembly malfunctions, may often be discovered with physical examination and radiographic evaluations. Nonmechanical malfunctions, such as cuff erosion, inadequate cuff compression and functional urethral atrophy, can be diagnosed with perfusion sphincterometry, urethroscopy and a filling cystometrogram, all combined in 1 simplified technique. With the presented algorithm the over-all success rate after 1 revision was 82%. Mechanical malfunctions appear to have a better revision rate of success than nonmechanical malfunctions (100% versus 71.5%, respectively). 
A phase II study of mitoxantrone, etoposide, and thiotepa with autologous marrow support for patients with relapsed breast cancer. To further improve the effect of high-dose chemotherapy in the treatment of locally advanced and metastatic breast cancer, we sought to develop a second active high-dose noncross-resistant regimen to use in tandem with our customary high-dose regimen of cyclophosphamide, etoposide, and cisplatin (CVP). We performed a phase II trial of high-dose mitoxantrone 30 mg/m2, etoposide 200 mg/m2 every 12 hours x 6, and thiotepa 250 mg/m2 x 3 days (MVT) in 31 patients with heavily pretreated metastatic breast cancer and one with locally advanced chemotherapy-refractory breast cancer. These patients were ineligible for high-dose CVP chemotherapy because of the amount of prior treatment and poor-response status. Of the 32 patients, 14 responded to cycle 1, did not experience any grade 4 toxicity, and received a second cycle of MVT. Overall, seven of 31 patients achieved a complete response (CR; 23%). Four of the 14, who were partial responders to the first cycle, achieved a CR after the second cycle. The overall response rate was 19 of 31 (61%) with an overall median freedom from progression of 4 to 5 months and an overall median survival of 9 months. Toxicity consisted primarily of mucositis (grade 3 or 4 in 69%). The results indicate that high-dose MVT produces significant activity, even in heavily pretreated patients. Administration of a second cycle of high-dose therapy with MVT increased the CR rate, and the morbidity and mortality from the second cycle were not greater than that for the first cycle. Because of the high incidence of grade 3 or 4 mucositis with this regimen, we are currently completing a follow-up study of high-dose mitoxantrone and thiotepa alone. 
Ibopamine in chronic congestive heart failure: hemodynamic and neurohumoral effects. Ibopamine is a dopamine-like drug that shows mainly vasoactive properties, predominantly acting on dopamine1-(DA1-) and DA2-adrenoceptors. Ibopamine increases cardiac output, reduces peripheral vascular resistance, and increases renal blood flow, exerting a lesser effect on preload parameters. This hemodynamic improvement is also present even after relatively long-term treatment. There is no evidence of pharmacologic tolerance. In relation to DA2-activation, ibopamine modulates the neurohumoral consequences of heart failure with decreases in plasma renin activity and aldosterone and norepinephrine plasma levels, an effect that can be beneficial in the long-term treatment of heart failure patients. 
Paroxysmal kinesigenic choreoathetosis with abnormal electroencephalogram during attacks. An 18-year-old man with paroxysmal kinesigenic choreoathetosis (PKC) showed rhythmic electroencephalographic (EEG) discharges of 5-Hz spikes over the entire scalp during episodes. The EEG findings in this case suggest that PKC may have an epileptogenic basis. 
Quantitation of vascular outflow by measurement of impedance. One of the most important determinants of graft patency is the degree and character of vascular outflow. This study was designed to evaluate input impedance as a functional assessment of the outflow bed of vascular grafts. Four distinct outflow environments were created for external jugular vein conduits in 42 New Zealand white rabbits. Vein grafts (n = 14) were fashioned as end-to-side common carotid interposition bypass grafts. Arteriovenous fistulas (n = 15) were created by side-to-side anastomosis of the distal common carotid artery and linguofacial vein. Arteriovenous fistulas with outflow obstruction (n = 7) were fistulas with a metal clip partially obstructing the distal outflow channel (1 mm lumen). Vein graft/arteriovenous fistula combinations (n = 6) consisted of a vein graft and arteriovenous fistula in series. Pressure and flow in the external jugular vein were measured, and input impedance spectra were calculated by Fourier methods. By use of a PC-based acquisition and processing system, impedance results for 20 cardiac cycles could be obtained in approximately 10 minutes. The results revealed that vein grafts typically demonstrated high resistance to steady state flow (Rin = 235 +/- 50 x 10(3) dyne . sec/cm-5) and steadily decreasing impedance to pulsatile flow resulting in a characteristic impedance (Z0; average of fourth to tenth harmonics) of 35.5 +/- 8.0 x 10(3) dyne . sec/cm-5. Phase angle values were usually negative, especially at low harmonics (first harmonic phase angle = -1.11 +/- 0.10 radians) indicating that flow led pressure. In contrast, arteriovenous fistula Rin was minimal (6.3 +/- 1.4 x 10(3) dyne . sec/cm-5; p less than 0.05 compared to vein graft, and the impedance was flat across the frequency spectrum (Z0 = 8.5 +/- 1.5 x 10(3) dyne . sec/cm-5; p less than 0.05) with pressure and flow nearly in phase (first harmonic phase angle = -0.05 +/- 0.10 radians). Creation of outflow obstruction in arteriovenous fistulas resulted in significantly elevated Rin (136 +/- 41 x 10(3) dyne/sec . cm-5; p less than 0.05 compared to arteriovenous fistula and Z0 (23 +/- 9 x 10(3) dyne . sec/cm-5, p less than 0.05).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS). 
Serum concentrations of tumour necrosis factor alpha in childhood chronic inflammatory bowel disease. Serum tumour necrosis factor alpha (TNF alpha) concentrations were measured by enzyme linked immunoadsorbent assay in 31 normal children and during 65 episodes of clinical remission and 54 episodes of relapse in 92 children with chronic inflammatory bowel disease. An appreciable rise in TNF alpha was found only in children in relapse of ulcerative colitis and colonic Crohn's disease. The group of children with small bowel Crohn's disease in relapse did not show increases of TNF alpha above control concentrations, despite an equivalent rise in disease indices. Height velocity was depressed in children with relapse of large bowel Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis compared with the equivalent condition in remission. The impairment of growth velocity was significantly greater in relapse of large bowel Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis than in small bowel Crohn's disease alone, although for the subgroups in stage 1 puberty (prepubertal) the differences were not significant. Inadequate growth in chronic inflammatory bowel disease is currently ascribed to inadequate nutrition and TNF alpha may contribute to this through its cachexia inducing effects. It may, in addition, diminish pituitary growth hormone release. These results suggest that production of TNF alpha may be associated with growth failure in relapse of colonic inflammatory bowel disease.
