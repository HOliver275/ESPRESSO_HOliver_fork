Pathophysiological role of augmented atrial natriuretic polypeptide gene expression in DOCA-salt hypertension. Effects of atrial natriuretic polypeptide monoclonal antibody. To elucidate the pathophysiological significance of endogenous atrial natriuretic polypeptide (ANP) in hypertension, we investigated the biosynthesis and secretion of ANP in deoxycorticosterone acetate (DOCA)-salt hypertensive rats and also examined the effect of passive immunization with monoclonal antibody raised against alpha-rat ANP on the development of hypertension in DOCA-salt rats. The plasma ANP level in DOCA-salt rats was significantly elevated in comparison to control rats. While the atrial ANP concentration in DOCA-salt rats was not significantly altered, the atrial level of ANPmRNA in DOCA-salt rats was two-fold higher than that in control rats. These results suggest the augmented biosynthesis of ANP in the atrium and the oversecretion of ANP from the heart in DOCA-salt rats. The levels of ANP and ANPmRNA in the ventricle of DOCA-salt rats exhibited significant increases, compared with those in control rats, suggesting the induction of ANP gene expression in the ventricle of DOCA-salt hypertensive rats under pre/after overload. Weekly intravenous administrations of monoclonal antibody with high affinity for alpha-rat ANP significantly augmented the rise in blood pressure of DOCA-salt rats. These results support the hypothesis that the augmented secretion of ANP is one of the defensive mechanisms to counteract high arterial pressure in this model of hypertension. 
A life-threatening sexually transmitted Haemophilus influenzae in septic abortion: a case report. Haemophilus influenzae infections of the genitourinary tract are rare. A case of a life-threatening Haemophilus influenzae bacteremia associated with a septic abortion is presented. Sexual transmission of bacteria after orogenital contact is proposed as a possible source of this uncommon infection. 
Poikilothermia in man: pathophysiology and clinical implications. Poikilothermia, the inability to maintain a constant core temperature independent of ambient temperature, markedly influences both the mental and physical function of affected patients; furthermore, prolonged hypothermia can induce numerous complications. To establish the pathophysiology of thermoregulation underlying poikilothermia in man, we compared 4 women with acquired poikilothermia, with 9 female control subjects. The activity of the main thermoregulatory effector mechanisms was assessed in a thermoneutral environment, and during subsequent cold stress and heat exposure. At thermoneutrality the patients had a significantly lower rectal temperature and resting metabolic rate compared with the controls; no patient showed peripheral vasoconstriction or shivering. Cooling revealed markedly reduced peripheral vasoconstriction in 3 patients and failure of the metabolic response in 2 patients; unlike controls, no patient exhibited shivering. Heat challenge revealed severely reduced capacity for heat dissipation in all patients. We conclude that in patients with poikilothermia, the mechanisms for both heat conservation and heat dissipation are seriously attenuated. Careful monitoring of the core temperature and adequate measures to maintain normothermia are of great importance in patients with poikilothermia in order to provide adequate treatment, improve the quality of life, and prevent serious complications. 
Alternating sequential intracarotid BCNU and cisplatin in recurrent malignant glioma. The authors entered 43 patients with recurrent malignant glioma in a trial of alternating sequential intracarotid BCNU and cisplatin. Protocol design was alternating courses of BCNU (2 doses, 300 to 400 mg each) and cisplatin (2 doses, 150 to 200 mg each) each at 4-week to 6-week intervals. Eight of 40 patients (20%) evaluable after the first course of BCNU showed partial or minor response. Only 18 patients were evaluable after the first course of cisplatin, and 5 were evaluable after the second course of BCNU. Median survival was 9 months (range, 2 weeks to 6 years). Cerebral or ocular toxicity unique to this method of chemotherapy administration and failure to show clinical improvement were the most common reasons for removal from study. Because of the high attrition rate, the authors were unable to determine a meaningful response to alternating sequential BCNU and cisplatin or to test the clinical degree of cross-resistance to these agents in human malignant glioma. 
Regulation of prolactin gene expression in a DMBA-estrogen-induced transplantable rat pituitary tumor. A new transplantable rat pituitary tumor was induced in F344 female rats with dimethylbenz(a)anthracene and estrogen (MtT/F-DMBA) and studied for 20 serial transplant generations. The tumor grew without estrogen supplements in female rats by the second transplant generation. Sensitivity to estrogens, as indicated by a prolonged latency period for tumor development, was seen at the 20th, but not the 5th transplant generation. MtT/F-DMBA tumors expressed prolactin (PRL), growth hormone (GH), and adrenocorticotropin (ACTH) mRNAs. A decrease in the percentage of cells expressing PRL mRNA, PRL protein, and in the number of secretory granules per cell occurred with serial transplantation. S-100 protein-positive folliculostellate cells were present in the hyperplastic pituitary but not in the transplantable tumors. Estrogen treatment at the 20th transplant generation prolonged the tumor latency period, increased the number of cells expressing PRL mRNA greater than 5-fold by in situ hybridization analysis (14 +/- 2% versus 77 +/- 5%), increased PRL secretion (132 +/- 40 ng/ml versus 3762 +/- 890 ng/ml), and increased the number of cytoplasmic secretory granules per cell. These results indicate that hyperplastic pituitary and true pituitary neoplasms differ in their ability to grow readily after transplantation. The presence of S-100 protein-positive folliculostellate cells, which are present in hyperplastic but not in neoplastic pituitary tissues, may serve as a morphologic marker to separate hyperplastic and neoplastic rat pituitary tissues. Transplantable tumors remained responsive to estrogen with expression of a more differentiated phenotype, including an increased number of cells expressing PRL mRNA and increased numbers of PRL secretory granules. 
Extracranial vertebral artery dissection following tonic clonic seizure. A 34 year old woman developed cerebral infarction, following a tonic-clonic seizure. A vertebral artery dissection was demonstrated and may have been caused by arterial trauma during the seizure. This cause of morbidity following convulsive seizures may have been overlooked in the past and needs to be recognised in view of the potential benefits of anticoagulation. 
Endorectal sonography in the evaluation of rectal and perirectal disease. Endorectal sonography initially was developed for evaluation of the prostate and now has been adapted for evaluation of rectal and perirectal disease. We used endorectal sonography to evaluate a spectrum of diseases, including primary and recurrent rectal carcinoma, metastases, villous adenoma, leiomyosarcoma, endometriosis, sacrococcygeal teratoma, chordoma, retroperitoneal cystic hamartoma, pelvic lipomatosis, diverticulitis, and perirectal abscess. The technique has been useful in localization of perirectal abscesses and in sonographically guided biopsy of perirectal masses. Knowledge of normal sonographic anatomy of the rectum is essential in the evaluation of rectal and perirectal disease. In this essay, we describe the technique of endorectal sonography and illustrate the sonographic findings in a variety of diseases. 
Intraocular tolerance to silicone oils of different specific gravities. An experimental study. Different methylphenylsilicone (MPS) and fluorosilicone (FS) oils having a higher specific gravity than water were investigated as vitreous replacements. Their intraocular tolerance in vitrectomized aphakic rabbit eyes was evaluated for periods of up to 4 months and compared to that of regular polydimethylsilicone oil (PDMS). Weakly fluorinated FS and weakly phenylated MPS showed a presumably toxic effect on the retina. As compared to highly fluorinated FS, highly phenylated MPS showed better intraocular tolerance; however, inflammatory reaction was slightly more extensive than in eyes filled with PDMS. 
Acute-phase response of human hepatocytes: regulation of acute-phase protein synthesis by interleukin-6. Human hepatocytes in primary culture were used as a model system to investigate the mechanism(s) involved in the induction of the acute-phase response in human liver. Hepatocytes were incubated with increasing amounts of recombinant human interleukin-1 beta, recombinant interleukin-6 and tumor necrosis factor-alpha. Synthesis of C-reactive protein was studied at the mRNA and protein levels. Only recombinant interleukin-6 was capable of inducing C-reactive protein-mRNA and C-reactive protein-protein synthesis. Also, fibrinogen and alpha-1-antitrypsin synthesis measured by immunoprecipitation with specific antisera increased in a dose-dependent, time-dependent manner, whereas albumin synthesis decreased to about 50% of controls. Maximal effects were observed at 100 to 300 units of recombinant interleukin-6/ml culture medium after 20 hr of incubation. Although the synthetic glucocorticoid dexamethasone slightly modulated the effect of recombinant interleukin-6, it was not an absolute requirement for the induction of acute-phase protein synthesis in human hepatocytes. In pulse-chase experiments it was shown that the time course of the disappearance of the acute-phase proteins from the cells and their appearance in the medium is not influenced by recombinant interleukin-6. This finding suggests that recombinant interleukin-6 exerts its regulatory effect on acute-phase protein synthesis at the pretranslational level. 
Long-term diet modification and platelet activity. Platelet activity was assessed in a sub-sample of 56 participants in the MRC Diet and Reinfarction Trial (DART). Men whose diets contained a high ratio of polyunsaturated to saturated fatty acids (a P:S ratio of greater than 0.5) showed reduced secondary platelet aggregation to adenosine diphosphate (ADP) in platelet-rich plasma (PRP), and diminished platelet aggregation to ADP in whole blood. A trend of reduced secondary platelet aggregation to ADP with increasing dietary eicosapentaenoic acid was noted, but this was not statistically significant. The results of this study and the MRC Diet and Reinfarction Trial suggest a mediatory role for platelet activity in the relationship between diet and ischaemic heart disease. 
Elective cholecystectomy and carcinoma of the gallbladder. The incidence of carcinoma of the gallbladder has been reputed to be approximately 1.5 per cent among those who undergo surgery for chronic cholecystitis. The incidence at Cabrini Medical Center coincides rather well with that from other studies but has shown a marked decline, 21.5 per cent, within recent years. A report from the American Cancer Society projects an even greater decline to 0.65 per cent in the incidence of this almost incurable disease within the next 1-2 years. The decrease in the incidence of cancer of the gallbladder is attributed to the great increase in the performance of elective cholecystectomy for chronic cholecystitis among people 50 years of age or younger, before they have reached the age when carcinoma of the gallbladder is most prevalent. Early surgery is advocated not only as an effective and safe form of therapy but also as a valuable preventive measure. 
Dichotic asymmetries in aging and alcoholic subjects. It has been suggested that certain cognitive changes found both with aging and with chronic alcoholism are accompanied by alterations in hemispheric functional asymmetries. One prevalent view states that these well-delineated cognitive changes are directly related to a selective disruption of right hemisphere function. The present study tested this hypothesis using dichotic listening measures of functional asymmetry. Both alcoholics and older nonalcoholics evidenced patterns of cognitive preservation and impairment similar to those seen in patients with known right hemisphere dysfunction. Nevertheless, dichotic listening findings did not reveal any selective effect on the right hemisphere, as previously proposed. The dichotic studies supported the view that both hemispheres are affected by aging and alcoholism. Patients with right hemisphere lesions demonstrated characteristic and predictable changes in dichotic asymmetries, illustrating the reliability of the dichotic measures as indices of hemispheric function. 
Ischemic colitis associated with dextroamphetamine use. Ischemic colitis can be caused by a variety of medications including a number of sympathomimetic agents. We report the case of a 47-year-old narcoleptic man who had abdominal pain and rectal bleeding. The clinical, radiographic, and histologic findings supported the diagnosis of ischemic colitis associated with oral dextroamphetamine use. 
Mortality in a cohort of long-term users of hormone replacement therapy: an updated analysis. OBJECTIVE--To reexamine the mortality experience of a cohort of long-term users of hormone replacement therapy (HRT) in comparison with that reported previously for the same cohort of women, paying particular attention to cardiovascular mortality, deaths from breast and endometrial cancer, and deaths attributed to suicide or suspected suicide. DESIGN--Longitudinal cohort of 4544 long-term users of HRT amongst whom mortality is being monitored prospectively in comparison with expected rates in the female population of England and Wales (taking account of age and calendar period). SUBJECTS--4544 women, all of whom were recruited from specialist menopause clinics around Britain and had taken at least one year's continuous HRT at the time of recruitment to the study. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES--All cause mortality, cardiovascular mortality, deaths from female cancers, deaths attributed to suicide or suspected suicide. RESULTS--Overall mortality (based on 236 deaths over the entire study period from recruitment to December 1988) remained significantly lower than expected on the basis of national rates (relative risk (RR) 0.56, 95% confidence limits (CL) 0.47-0.66). When specific causes were considered, the only mortality ratios greater than unity were for injury, poisoning and violence (1.54, 95% CL 1.02-2.06), and for suicide and suspected suicide ('suicide') (2.40, 95% CL 1.68-3.11). Comparison of the ratios for the 112 additional deaths with those obtained in our previous analysis revealed that one of the few ratios to show any increase was that for breast cancer mortality. This rose from a significant deficit of 0.55 (95% CL 0.28-0.96) in the earlier period to 1.00 (95% CL 0.55-1.45) in the later period. There was also a suggestion of an increase in breast cancer risk with increasing duration since first use of HRT. Most of the other cause-specific ratios were very similar over the two periods. The ratio of death from all circulatory diseases was notably lower in the later analysis (RR 0.37, 95% CL 0.15-0.58) than in the earlier analysis (0.51, 95% CL 0.36-0.69), as were all of the subcategories of cardiovascular death. The mortality ratio for cancer of the ovary and uterine adnexa fell from 1.12 in the previous analysis to 0.63 (95% CL 0-1.41). The mortality ratio for 'suicide' also decreased, but was only slightly lower in the later period. As before, however, there was evidence of a relatively high prevalence of prior psychiatric problems amongst the recent 'suicide' deaths, suggesting that the excess of deaths from 'suicide' may be a manifestation of selection. CONCLUSION--These data are consistent with a beneficial effect of HRT on cardiovascular diseases, although updated information comparing progestogen-opposed and -unopposed treatment is not available. The increase in breast cancer mortality contrasts with the pattern for all other specific causes examined; taken together with the suggestion of an increase in breast cancer mortality with increasing interval since first exposure to HRT, this finding is somewhat worrying. 
Arthrofibrosis in acute anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction. The effect of timing of reconstruction and rehabilitation. Arthrofibrosis is a potential complication of acute ACL reconstruction. Arthrofibrosis prevents the patient from regaining full range of motion, particularly the terminal 5 degrees of full extension, postoperatively. We did a retrospective study of 169 acute ACL reconstructions in a population of young athletes (average age, 22 years). We sought to determine the optimal time to perform acute ACL reconstruction with respect to arthrofibrosis and the effects of an accelerated versus conventional rehabilitation program. The short-term results were evaluated by range of motion measurements and 13 week Cybex scores. Patients whose ligaments were reconstructed within the 1st week after injury (Group I) had a statistically significant (P less than 0.05) increased incidence of arthrofibrosis (limited extension, scar tissue) over patients who had ACL reconstruction delayed 21 days or more (Group III). At 13 weeks after the reconstruction procedure, Group III patients scored an average of 70% (compared to 51% for Group I, P less than 0.05) on the Cybex evaluation. They also showed a trend toward more flexion of the knee as well as near full extension. Patients who had an ACL reconstruction between 8 and 21 days after injury (Group II) had a similar incidence of arthrofibrosis as Group I when they followed a conventional rehabilitation program postoperatively. However, only a small number of cases (approximately 4%) of Group II patients who followed an accelerated postoperative rehabilitation program had any arthrofibrosis--an observation we also made in the Group III patients. 
Mortality in patients treated with flecainide and encainide for supraventricular arrhythmias. In a recent clinical trial, the class Ic antiarrhythmic drugs encainide and flecainide were found to be associated with an increased mortality risk in patients with new myocardial infarction and ventricular arrhythmias. The purpose of this study was to assess whether an increased mortality risk also accompanied the use of these drugs to treat patients with supraventricular arrhythmias. Data were obtained from the respective pharmaceutical sponsors on the mortality observed with each drug in United States and foreign protocols enrolling patients with supraventricular arrhythmias. Mortality in the encainide population (343 patients) and the flecainide population (236 patients) was compared with that in a research arrhythmia clinic, the Duke population (154 patients). Nine deaths occurred in the combined encainide-flecainide population and 10 deaths occurred in the Duke population; the follow-up periods averaged 488 days and 1,285 days, respectively. The 6-year survival functions of these 2 populations, estimated by the Kaplan-Meier technique, did not differ significantly (p = 0.62). The hazard ratio for the combined encainide-flecainide population relative to the Duke population was estimated to be 0.6 with a 95% confidence interval of 0.2, 1.7. These descriptive comparisons did not demonstrate any excess mortality when flecainide and encainide were used in patients with supraventricular arrhythmias. 
Malignant colorectal strictures in Crohn's disease. One hundred thirty-two of 980 patients (13.5%) with Crohn's disease (CD) involving the colon, admitted to The Mount Sinai Hospital between 1959 and 1985, developed 175 colonic strictures. Thirty-three patients developed more than one stricture. The frequency was twice as great in colitis (19%) as in ileocolitis (11%). Ten malignant strictures were identified in nine patients (three ileocolitis, six colitis). One of these patients had three strictures (two malignant, and one benign), and two had two strictures (one malignant and one benign). The frequency of cancer in patients with stricture (6.8%) was higher than in those without stricture (0.7%, six of 848, p less than 0.001). There were no differences in clinical symptoms between patients with benign and malignant stricture. Seventeen of 165 benign strictures (10.3%) were long, extending over more than one anatomical segment of colon, but all 10 malignant strictures were short (p less than 0.0001). The age at the diagnosis of stricture was higher in the nine patients with malignant stricture than in the 123 patients with benign stricture (mean age 57.2 vs. 41.4 yr, respectively, p less than 0.01). The proportion of strictures that were malignant increased with duration of disease from 3.3% with less than 20 yr of CD, to 11% with CD of 20 yr or more. All nine patients with malignant stricture were treated surgically, and four of the nine died of colon cancer during a mean follow-up of 4.3 yr. Prognosis was worse in six other nonstricture cancers in this series, with five colon cancer deaths during mean follow-up of 1.6 yr. In view of the high rate of malignancy, 6.8% in this series, colonoscopy with biopsy is essential in Crohn's disease patients with colonic strictures, and surgery must be considered when a stricture cannot be fully assessed during colonoscopy. 
AAEM case report #3: myasthenia gravis. Reported here are the electrodiagnostic findings in a patient with myasthenia gravis who had dysarthria, dysphagia, and dyspnea. The use of repetitive nerve stimulation and single fiber electromyography studies for the evaluation of patients suspected of myasthenia gravis is reviewed. 
Intraspinal neurothekeoma (nerve sheath myxoma). A report of two cases. Neurothekeomas (nerve sheath myxomas) are rare benign cutaneous tumors. The authors describe two spinal intradural cases that show histologic, immunohistochemical, and electron microscopic features identical to their cutaneous counterparts. The authors' findings suggest histogenesis from Schwann's cells or undifferentiated nerve sheath precursor cells. Neurothekeomas in unusual locations should be differentiated from myxoid neurofibromas, perineuriomas, and soft tissue myxomas. 
Secondary systemic amyloidosis: response and survival in 64 patients. From 1956 through 1989, 38 men and 26 women were seen at the Mayo Clinic with biopsy-proven AA. The underlying disorder was rheumatic disease in 42, infectious disease in 11, inflammatory bowel disease in 6, and other causes in 5. All patients were symptomatic at the time of diagnosis. Fifty-eight of the 64 patients had proteinuria or renal insufficiency. Fourteen also had significant symptoms of gastrointestinal amyloid, and 6 had amyloid goiter. None of the patients had symptomatic cardiac involvement, and only 3 had palpable hepatomegaly. Renal, gastric, rectal, fat, and marrow biopsies were positive for amyloid in 100%, 94%, 82%, 58%, and 46% of tested patients, respectively. The median survival of the entire group was 24.5 months. Thirty-five of the 47 deceased patients died as a direct result of their amyloidosis, primarily from complications of renal failure. Nine were successfully treated and had regression of the disease. Two with bronchiectasis responded to long-term cyclic antibiotic therapy, as did 1 patient with osteomyelitis. One patient with inflammatory bowel disease responded to surgical resection, and 1 with familial Mediterranean fever responded to colchicine. Four patients with rheumatic disease were treated with cyclophosphamide (in 2) and methotrexate (in 2), with complete resolution of their renal disease. All 9 successfully treated patients are alive, with a median follow-up of 58 months. Statistical analysis revealed that creatinine values greater than or equal to 2.0 mg/dl (P less than 0.003) and a serum albumin value less than 2.5 g/dl (P less than 0.02) were associated with a poorer survival. The single strongest variable associated with poor survival was a serum creatinine level greater than 2 mg/dl at presentation, with a median survival of 11.2 months compared to patients with a creatinine level less than 2.0 mg/dl, with a median survival of 56.9 months. 
Disruption of human circadian and cognitive regulation following a discrete hypothalamic lesion: a case study. We report a patient with rostral hypothalamic damage that significantly disrupted temporal patterning of the sleep-wake cycle, body temperature, and cognitive and behavioral functioning. The findings suggest that the suprachiasmatic region of the hypothalamus is important for the circadian control of human behavior, and that circadian organization may be essential for normal cognitive functioning. 
Incremental prognostic value of exercise hemodynamic variables in chronic congestive heart failure secondary to coronary artery disease or to dilated cardiomyopathy. To determine the prognostic value of hemodynamic variables at rest and during exercise, 49 patients with chronic congestive heart failure undergoing hemodynamic evaluation at rest and during symptom-limited exercise were followed for 1 year. One-year mortality rate was 33%. On univariate analysis, nonsurvivors differed significantly from survivors in pulmonary arterial wedge pressure at rest (22 +/- 10 vs 15 +/- 10 mm Hg; p = 0.01) and during exercise (32 +/- 9 vs 24 +/- 9 mm Hg; p = 0.003), stroke work index at rest (19 +/- 6 vs 25 +/- 9 g-m/m2; p = 0.03) and during exercise (20 +/- 7 vs 32 +/- 14 g-m/m2; p = 0.001) and exercise-induced increment in stroke work index (0.5 +/- 0.4 vs 7 +/- 8 g-m/m2; p = 0.004), but not with respect to left ventricular ejection fraction, exercise duration, peak oxygen consumption or peak left ventricular hydraulic power. Patients with a peak exercise stroke work index less than 20 g-m/m2 had a 66% mortality rate compared with a mortality rate of 13% in patients with a peak exercise stroke work index greater than 20 g-m/m2 (p = 0.0001). Multiple logistic regression analysis identified pulmonary arterial wedge pressure at rest and peak exercise stroke work index as the only independent predictors of mortality. A receiver-operating characteristic curve analysis revealed that peak exercise stroke work index provided significant incremental prognostic information over the resting hemodynamic variables. 
Significance of silent myocardial ischemia during exercise testing in patients with diabetes mellitus: a report from the Coronary Artery Surgery Study (CASS) Registry. To evaluate the significance of ischemic ST depression without anginal chest pain during exercise testing among patients with diabetes mellitus, the data on 45 such patients from the Coronary Artery Surgery Study registry were analyzed. These patients (group 1, silent ischemia) were compared with 37 diabetic patients with both ischemic ST depression and chest pain (group 2, symptomatic ischemia), with 31 diabetic patients without ischemic ST depression or chest pain (group 3, no ischemia), and with 429 patients without diabetes who had silent ischemia during exercise testing. All patients had documented coronary artery disease (CAD) (greater than 70% diameter narrowing). The 6-year survival among patients with silent ischemia was worse in diabetic than nondiabetic patients (59 vs 82%, respectively, p less than 0.001). By contrast, the 6-year survival among patients without ischemia was similar among diabetic and nondiabetic patients (93 vs 85%, respectively, p = 0.476). Among diabetic patients, survival at 6 years with medical treatment was 59% for group 1, 66% for group 2 and 93% for group 3 (p = 0.008). Survival among subsets of patients with diabetes and silent ischemia (group 1) based on the extent of CAD and left ventricular function ranged from 100 to 32% (p = 0.093). The survival of the 45 patients with diabetes mellitus and silent ischemia (group 1) treated medically was compared with that of 28 patients receiving coronary artery graft bypass surgery. 
Histopathologic features of the L-tryptophan-related eosinophilia-myalgia (fasciitis) syndrome Study of 18 biopsy specimens in 11 patients with L-tryptophan-related eosinophiliamyalgia (fasciitis) syndrome showed hyaline sclerodermoid changes. Dermal scleroderma was found in eight of nine punch biopsy specimens and eight of nine excisional biopsy specimens. Fascial scleroderma was found in eight excisional biopsy specimens. One specimen obtained by excision had no fascia present. Eleven biopsy specimens showed edema of the dermis, and 13 showed dilated lymphatic structures; thus, the clinical picture of edematous sclerosis was confirmed. Mucinous fasciitis was present in five excisional biopsy specimens, in conjunction with a large number of macrophages in four. Dermal mucinosis was present in 11 biopsy specimens. Lymphocytic and macrophage inflammation was minimal in 14 biopsy specimens and pronounced in only 4. Plasma cells were present in eight cases. Eosinophils were present in substantial numbers in three biopsy specimens and only occasionally in four. Eosinophilic spongiosis was observed in one patient. Lymphocytic inflammation was noted around a single muscle spindle and around large nerve trunks in three patients. No relationship was established between these pathologic features and the duration or dose of tryptophan, prednisone treatment, or duration of symptoms. Pathologic features of the L-tryptophan syndrome consist of hyaline sclerodermoid collagen in the dermis, the septa, and the fascia. Edema, focal mucinosis, and macrophage inflammation may be features that identify this event. 
Energy expenditure and substrate metabolism measured by 24 h whole-body calorimetry in patients receiving cyclic and continuous total parenteral nutrition. 1. Twenty-four hour energy expenditure and its components, i.e. 'basal metabolic rate', activity energy expenditure and diet-induced thermogenesis were measured, using continuous whole-body indirect calorimetry, in patients receiving total parenteral nutrition while in remission from Crohn's disease (weight 51.9 +/- 9.9 kg, body mass index 19.2 +/- 2.0 kg/m2). 2. Total parenteral nutrition was infused continuously over 24 h in four subjects and cyclically, between 22.00 and 10.00 hours, in eight subjects. Twenty-four hour energy expenditure (6.83 +/- 1.10 MJ/24 h) was lower than total energy intake (10.09 +/- 1.63 MJ/24 h), resulting in a positive energy balance (3.26 +/- 1.42 MJ) in all subjects. Repeated measurements of resting energy expenditure in the continuously fed subjects (5.82 +/- 1.11 MJ/24 h) did not change significantly at different times of day (coefficient of variation 2.2-6.6%). In contrast, in cyclically fed subjects, resting energy expenditure was 24.2 +/- 9.0% higher towards the end of the 12 h feeding period than the 'basal metabolic rate', which was measured just before the start of the feeding period. 3. Diet-induced thermogenesis, calculated as the increment in resting energy expenditure above 'basal metabolic rate' over the 24 h period (adjusted for the reduction in energy expenditure during sleep), was found to be 0.60 +/- 0.29 MJ or 6.1 +/- 3.1% of the energy intake. 4. The energy cost of activity (activity energy expenditure) in the continuously fed patients, calculated as the difference between 24 h energy expenditure and the integrated 24 h measurements of resting energy expenditure, was 0.88 +/- 0.53 MJ, i.e. 12.9 +/- 5.9% of the 24 h energy expenditure. 5. The non-protein non-glycerol respiratory quotient exceeded 1.0 for varying periods of time (0.5-17 h) in 11 subjects, indicating net lipogenesis from carbohydrate. 6. The results demonstrate favourable rates of deposition, during intravenous feeding, of both energy and nitrogen over a 24 h period in patients recovering from an episode of Crohn's disease. The efficacy of these commonly used total parenteral nutrition regimens in these patients is related to three features that are absent in normal healthy individuals, namely a low basal metabolic rate, a low activity-related energy expenditure and prolonged periods of lipogenesis from carbohydrate. 
Clinical course and outcome in class IC antiarrhythmic overdose. 120 cases of class IC antiarrhythmic overdose, including propafenone, flecainide, ajmaline and prajmaline overdose, were evaluated with respect to clinical course, therapy and outcome. Whereas drug overdose in general has an overall mortality of less than 1%, intoxication with antiarrhythmic drugs of class IC was associated with a mean mortality of 22.5%. Nausea, which occurred within the first 30 minutes after ingestion, was the earliest symptom. Spontaneous vomiting probably led to self-detoxication in about half the patients. Cardiac symptoms including bradycardia and, less frequently, tachyrhythmia occurred after about 30 minutes to 2 hours. Therapeutic measures included administration of activated charcoal, gastric lavage and a saline laxative, catecholamines, and in some patients, hypertonic sodium bicarbonate, insertion of a transvenous pacemaker and hemoperfusion. Fatal outcome was mainly due to cardiac conduction disturbances progressing to electromechanical dissociation or asystolia. Resuscitation, which had to be performed in 29 patients, was successful in only two of them. No correlation was found between fatal outcome, the type of antiarrhythmic, and ingested dose. Since a specific treatment is not available and resuscitive procedures including sodium bicarbonate and insertion of a pacemaker are of limited therapeutic value, early diagnosis and primary detoxification are most important for prevention of fatal outcome. 
Antepartum testing in the hypertensive patient: when to begin. Antepartum testing has been recommended for patients whose pregnancies are complicated by hypertension. Although this is considered accepted practice, there are little data available to help the clinician know when to start testing. To help answer this question in patients with chronic hypertension and nonproteinuric pregnancy-induced hypertension, we reviewed the results of all antepartum tests between 1976 and 1987 in patients with these diagnoses. The primary mode of surveillance in the majority of our patients was the contraction stress test. We determined when patients first had positive contraction stress test results and when intervention occurred because of an abnormal antepartum test result. There were a total of 917 patients tested with these diagnoses. Fifty-three (5.8%) of these patients had at least one positive contraction stress test result. Twenty-two patients were delivered of infants before 35 weeks' gestation because of abnormal antepartum test results. Those with early intervention (less than 35 weeks' gestation) could not be differentiated from those with later intervention (greater than or equal to 35 weeks' gestation) by maternal age, diastolic blood pressure, or systolic blood pressure at the time of testing. The majority of patients who were delivered of infants before 35 weeks' gestation had a concomitant diagnosis of systemic lupus erythematosus, intrauterine growth retardation, diabetes mellitus, or superimposed preeclampsia. On the basis of when compromise was evident, patients with these diagnoses may require testing to be started as early as the fetus is considered viable. However, in those without these diagnoses, the clinician may delay the beginning of testing until 33 weeks' gestation without significant risk of pregnancy loss before testing. 
Socioeconomic status and survival from soft-tissue sarcomas: a population-based study in northern Italy. BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Differential prognosis among cancer patients according to socioeconomic status (SES) has been reported. We analyzed survival from soft tissue sarcomas (STS) according to different SES indicators. METHODS: We followed up all the adult patients with a new diagnosis of STS occurring between 1.1.1981 and 31.12.1983 in an area of Northern Italy (N = 86). RESULTS: The overall three-year survival rate was 57 percent. After adjustment for confounders, both low education and blue collar jobs were negatively associated with survival. CONCLUSIONS: The results suggest that patients of low SES have a poorer prognosis for STS. 
Fine-needle aspiration in recurrent tonsillitis. The incidence of tonsillitis that is unresponsive to penicillin therapy is leading to concern. This phenomenon has been linked to a change in the core tonsil bacteria, in particular beta-lactamase production. To date, the only way to identify the presence of these resistant microbes is at tonsillectomy. In this prospective study, we performed fine-needle tonsil aspiration in 34 patients (mean age, 7.6 years) before tonsillectomy. The bacteriologic nature of the aspirate was compared with that obtained from culturing the tonsillar surface (in situ) and core of the resected tonsils. The bacteriologic findings of the aspirate corresponded closely with those of the tonsil core (qualitative and quantitative comparison), while the superficial swab was of limited value in predicting the core bacteria. Based on this study, tonsil fine-needle aspiration may have a place in the treatment of recurrent tonsillitis. 
Prophylaxis of stress ulcer bleeding. A meta-analysis. Recent studies have reported upper gastrointestinal tract bleeding in 5-25% of intensive care unit (ICU) patients with severe stress despite the use of antacids and/or H2-antagonists. To evaluate the efficacy of this regimen, a meta-analysis of all prospective studies on the prevention of stress bleeding, available from the international literature, was conducted. Only macroscopically visible bleeds were considered. Because alkalinization of the gastric juice has been incriminated in facilitating gastric and pulmonary colonization, agents with little or no influence on the gastric pH have been increasingly investigated in stress bleeding prophylaxis. The meta-analysis was therefore extended to determine the efficacy of two newer substances, pirenzepine and sucralfate, in preventing macroscopically visible stress bleeding, as well as their influence on pulmonary infections and mortality. Antacids and H2-antagonists proved to be significantly superior to untreated controls, with the tendency in favor of antacids administered in short intervals as compared to H2-antagonists. Pirenzepine and sucralfate were significantly superior to H2-antagonists, and sucralfate was as effective as an adequate antacid regimen. Patient groups treated with antacids or H2-antagonists showed a significantly higher risk for the development of nosocomial pneumonia. The most significant differences was found in long-term ventilated patients compared with patients treated with sucralfate. In the same patient group, antacids and H2-antagonists also showed a significantly higher mortality rate than sucralfate. 
Single-dose versus fractionated-dose dactinomycin in the treatment of Wilms' tumor. Preliminary results of a clinical trial. The Brazilian Wilms' Tumor Study Group. A clinical trial was conducted by the Brazilian Wilms' Tumor (WT) Study Group to compare the single-dose (60 micrograms/kg x 1 day) administration of dactinomycin (AMD) with the standard fractionated dose (15 micrograms/kg/d x 5 days) used in the US National WT Study. Except for the AMD administration, treatment for all patients followed that of the latter study. Patients were randomized to receive either of the two AMD regimens in the schedules most appropriate for their stage and histologic condition. One hundred seventy-six children with WT entered the study until December 1988. No significant differences in overall or relapse-free survival distributions were observed between treatment arms using data for all patients or data stratified by disease stage. Two-year survival rates were 83.0% and 85.3% for patients receiving the fractionated and single doses of AMD, respectively. Survival distributions could also be compared once patients with protocol violations were excluded. The overall 2-year survival rates were 89.7% and 88.6% and the relapse-free 2-year survival rates were 78.2% and 76.1% for the fractionated and single AMD doses, respectively. Altered liver function was seen in three patients who received fractionated dose and in four patients who received the single AMD dose. Acute toxicity was observed in only one patient of the fractionated-dose group and in zero of the patients of the single-dose group. At the closing date, patients assigned to the simplified AMD regimen had accumulated 1840 days less of hospital stay than those treated by the standard regimen. 
Differential expression of CD24-related epitopes in mycosis fungoides/Sezary syndrome: a potential marker for circulating Sezary cells. In the hematopoietic system, the B-cell associated antigen CD24 is expressed at high density on B cells, B-cell precursors, and B-cell malignancies as well as at low density on peripheral blood polymorphonuclear leukocytes. The 42-Kd sialoglycoprotein has not been previously demonstrated to be expressed on T cells, thymocytes, or T-cell malignancies. We identified three patients with mycosis fungoides/Sezary syndrome that showed low density expression of the CD24-related epitope recognized by antibody BA-1 on circulating T cells. All three patients had Sezary cells by morphologic assessment and clonal T-cell populations in the peripheral blood by gene rearrangement studies. In two of these patients, indirect immunofluorescence with a panel of six anti-CD24 monoclonal antibodies demonstrated reactivity for two of six antibodies in one case and only one of six antibodies in the other. The biologic significance of CD24-related epitope expression on circulating T cells in mycosis fungoides/Sezary syndrome is unclear. However, these findings suggest that differential, low density expression of CD24-related epitopes (BA-1+, OKB2-) may be a useful phenotypic marker for identifying circulating Sezary cells. 
A randomized clinical study of a calcium-entry blocker (lidoflazine) in the treatment of comatose survivors of cardiac arrest. Brain Resuscitation Clinical Trial II Study Group BACKGROUND. Abnormalities of cellular calcium homeostasis have been implicated in the pathophysiology of postischemic encephalopathy. Calcium-entry-blocking drugs inhibit the influx of calcium into cells and have been shown to mitigate postischemic encephalopathy in animal models. METHODS. Five hundred twenty patients with cardiac arrest who remained comatose after the restoration of spontaneous circulation were randomly assigned to receive three doses of lidoflazine, an experimental calcium-entry blocker, or a placebo and were followed for six months. Four patients were lost to follow-up. Treated patients received an intravenous loading dose (1 mg per kilogram of body weight) of lidoflazine and two subsequent doses (0.25 mg per kilogram) 8 and 16 hours after resuscitation. The investigators were blinded to treatment assignment. RESULTS. There was no statistically significant difference between the lidoflazine group (n = 259) and the placebo group (n = 257) in the proportion of patients who died during the six-month follow-up (82 vs. 83 percent), who survived with good cerebral recovery (15 vs. 13 percent), or who survived with severe neurologic deficit (1.2 vs. 1.9 percent). Analysis of the best level of recovery achieved at any time during follow-up also did not show a difference between the treatment groups: 24 percent of those given lidoflazine and 23 percent of those given placebo recovered good cerebral function (normal or only moderately disabled cerebral performance) at some time. CONCLUSIONS. The administration of lidoflazine after cardiac arrest was not found to be beneficial. Our data do not support the routine use of this calcium-entry-blocking drug in comatose survivors of cardiac arrest. 
Role of endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography after orthotopic liver transplantation. Twelve of 178 (7%) liver transplant patients underwent endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) after transplantation. The indications for ERCP were persistent or late onset cholestasis, recurrent cholangitis, and suspected biliary leaks or strictures. The time between transplantation and ERCP ranged from 44 to 330 days (median 153 days). Biliary complications diagnosed by ERCP included biliary sludge in the form of casts, calculi, or debris (n = 7); bile leaks (n = 2); a biliary stricture (n = 1), and complete biliary obstruction (n = 1). One patient had a normal cholangiogram after transplantation. Biliary sludge was detected by ultrasound before ERCP in only one of six patients. Eight patients underwent endoscopic papillotomy, followed by clearance of biliary sludge in four and dilatation of a biliary stricture in one. Two patients bled after papillotomy but neither required surgical intervention. At a median follow up of 1.2 years (range 0.5-2.8 years), nine patients are well and three have died. ERCP provides both accurate diagnosis of biliary complications after liver transplantation and treatment that obviates the need for additional surgery in selected patients. 
Gastric carcinoids and their precursor lesions. A histologic and immunohistochemical study of 23 cases. A histologic and immunohistochemical study was carried out in 23 unselected nonantral gastric carcinoids and their precursor lesions classified according to Solcia et al. None of the patients showed Zollinger-Ellison syndrome. Two variants of carcinoids showing distinctive pathologic and pathogenetic characteristics were identified on the basis of presence or absence of associated chronic atrophic gastritis type A (A-CAG). Chronic atrophic gastritis type A was found in 19 cases showing either single or multiple neoplasms, tumor extension limited to the mucosa or submucosa, consistent endocrine cell precursor changes in extratumoral mucosa, and consistent hypergastrinemia and/or G cell hyperplasia. Associated precursor lesions were only hyperplastic in all but two cases with single carcinoids whereas they were also dysplastic in all but one case with multiple carcinoids. The four tumors arising in nonatrophic mucosa were all single, more aggressive, and not associated with extratumoral endocrine cell proliferations or with signs of gastrin hypersecretion. Tumor cells were diffusely immunoreactive for chromogranin A and synaptophysin but usually negative for chromogranin B or HISL-19. Scattered serotonin cells were found in ten carcinoids. They were more frequent in infiltrating than in intramucosal tumors as were the less represented pancreatic polypeptide cells whereas the reverse was found for alpha-subunit-containing cells. These results are of relevance for tumor pathogenesis and may provide the rationale for a less aggressive therapeutic approach in the patients. 
Changing the American diet. Impact on cancer prevention policy recommendations and program implications for the American Cancer Society [editorial] In 1984, the American Cancer Society (ACS) determined that a substantial proportion of new cancer cases could be avoided if seven dietary guidelines were followed. Education programs were developed for the general public, young people, and the mass media. In 1989, a Working Group of the Society reviewed the guidelines and found them to be valid, the only change being to combine two of them. This paper summarizes recent dietary recommendations of other health authorities, describes progress in meeting ACS dietary recommendations, analyzes the barriers to and opportunities for dietary improvement, and proposes new leadership opportunities for the Society. Concern is expressed that the current guidelines lack the clarity and specificity needed for public education, and that they are inconsistent with recent dietary recommendations of other authorities such as the US Department of Health and Human Services and the National Academy of Sciences. Revisions to the ACS Dietary Recommendations and implications for ACS programs are proposed. 
Comparison of transrectal prostate digital aspiration and ultrasound-guided core biopsies in 99 men. We compared digital transrectal needle aspiration and transrectal core prostate biopsies obtained with ultrasound guidance in 99 men. Both procedures were effective in identifying prostate cancer; complete sensitivity was 94 percent for aspiration and 90 percent for core biopsy. Aspiration confirmed 87 percent of 38 known cancers and 94 percent of 81 cancers overall, compared with 82 percent and 90 percent with core biopsies. The greatest number of cancers was found when both procedures were considered (95% of known and 98% of all cancers). Grading of both specimens was performed but was not equivalent. Unsatisfactory or inconclusive results by either procedure often obtained when cancer was present. We suggest digital transrectal needle aspiration as a first means of identifying most palpable prostate lesions. Transrectal core biopsies guided by ultrasonography should be used when suspicion of cancer cannot be confirmed by aspiration and when there is no palpable lesion (but clinical suspicion of cancer). 
Nutrition and hypertension prevention. Hypertension has been related to both obesity and a high salt intake. Evidence for the associations of blood pressure with body weight and dietary salt intake is summarized. In both adolescents and adults correlations between blood pressure and weight are highly significant, and in longitudinal studies change in blood pressure over time is correlated with change in weight. Correlations between salt intake and blood pressure are less striking, and the results of trials of modest salt restriction demonstrate a small but significant effect on blood pressure. Individuals vary in their susceptibility to salt, and hypertensive individuals are more responsive than normotensive individuals. Dietary deficiencies of potassium and calcium may amplify the effect of a high salt intake on blood pressure. Animal models provide compelling evidence for a genetic component to salt sensitivity of blood pressure. In two hypertension prevention trials, change in blood pressure was more convincingly related to change in weight than to change in dietary salt. Avoidance of obesity, or weight reduction in overweight individuals, should be key strategies for hypertension prevention. Avoidance of salt excess is also appropriate, although currently available trial data do not justify a recommendation of rigorous salt restriction for the entire population. 
Intravascular ultrasound assessment of lumen size and wall morphology in normal subjects and patients with coronary artery disease. BACKGROUND. Necropsy studies demonstrate that coronary artery disease (CAD) is frequently complex and eccentric. However, angiography provides only a silhouette of the vessel lumen. Intravascular ultrasound is a new tomographic imaging method for evaluation of coronary dimensions and wall morphology. Few data exist regarding intravascular ultrasound in patients with CAD, and no data exist for subjects with normal coronaries. METHODS AND RESULTS. We used a multielement 5.5F, 20-MHz ultrasound catheter to examine eight normal subjects and 43 patients with CAD. We assessed the safety of coronary ultrasound and the effect of vessel eccentricity on comparison of minimum luminal diameter by angiography and ultrasound. Normal and atherosclerotic wall morphology and stenosis severity were also evaluated by intravascular ultrasound. The only untoward effect was transient coronary spasm in five patients. At 33 sites in normal subjects, the lumen was nearly circular, yielding a close correlation between angiographic and ultrasonic minimum diameter (r = 0.92). At 90 sites in patients with CAD, ultrasound demonstrated a concentric cross section; correlation was also close (r = 0.93). However, at 72 eccentric sites, correlation was not as close (r = 0.77). For 41 stenoses, correlation between angiography and ultrasound for area reduction was moderate (r = 0.63). In normal subjects, wall morphology revealed a thin (0.30 mm or less) intimal leading edge and subadjacent sonolucent zone (0.20 mm or less). Patients with CAD exhibited increased thickness and echogenicity of the leading edge, thickened sonolucent zones, and/or attenuation of ultrasound transmission. CONCLUSIONS. These data establish that intravascular ultrasound is feasible and safe and yields luminal measurements that correlate generally with angiography. Differences between angiographic and ultrasound measures of lumen size in eccentric vessels probably reflect the dissimilar perspectives of tomographic and silhouette imaging techniques. Intravascular ultrasound provides detailed images of normal and abnormal wall morphology not previously possible in vivo. 
Epstein-Barr virus-associated peripheral T-cell lymphoma of activated CD8 phenotype. Two childhood cases are reported of peripheral T-cell lymphoma; the neoplastic cells expressed activated CD8 (T8) phenotype and contained Epstein-Barr viral (EBV) DNA. Both patients had an aggressive and rapid clinical course despite chemotherapy. Elevated titers of antibodies to EBV-viral capsid antigen (greater than 640) and early antigen (greater than 10) were found in both patients. Histology revealed pleomorphic immunoblastic lymphoma with extensive necrosis in one case and an angioimmunoblastic lymphadenopathy-like pattern containing Reed-Sternberg-like giant cells in the other. Southern blot hybridization studies showed clonal rearrangement of the T-cell-receptor beta gene in both cases, and a cytogenetic study on one case revealed clonal structure abnormality involving chromosomes 1, 6, 7, 10, and 19. Analysis of the tumor DNA showed a high copy number of EBV genome per cell compared with that of Raji and Marmoset B 95.8 lines; the study for human T-cell leukemia virus type I was negative. The EBV genome was found by in situ hybridization in the tumor nuclei in both cases. In addition to Burkitt's lymphoma, T-cell lymphoma of the helper phenotype, and Hodgkin's disease, EBV can contribute to the development of CD8-positive aggressive T-cell lymphoma. 
An extensive transbasal approach to frontal skull-base tumors. Technical note. Lesions in the base of the frontal fossa have conventionally been approached extra- and intradurally through a bilateral frontal craniotomy. However, when the lesion is large or deeply situated, wider bilateral retraction of the frontal lobes is required to obtain a sufficiently large operative field. The authors describe a new operative approach for huge tumors at the frontal skull base, employing an en bloc bilateral osteotomy of the orbital roofs and frontal sinus. This procedure, which is a modification of the transbasal approach described by Derome and Guiot, is termed the "extensive transbasal approach." The advantages of this technique over conventional operative approaches are described. 
The effect of high-dose steroids on MRI gadolinium enhancement in acute demyelinating lesions. Gadolinium (Gd) enhancement of brain lesions by MRI is a marker of active blood-brain barrier damage secondary to an inflammatory process. We studied the effects of high-dose (1,000 mg/d) intravenous (IV) methylprednisolone (Mp) for 4 to 8 days on Gd-enhancing lesions in seven patients with acute demyelinating diseases and compared pretreatment brain MRIs with studies obtained 1 to 4 days after treatment. Five patients had complete suppression, and two had significant suppression of Gd enhancement following treatment. In addition, six of seven patients had Gd-enhancing lesions that explained their clinical signs; in five of six of these patients, suppression of the Gd-enhanced lesions temporally correlated with clinical improvement. Thus, short courses of high-dose IV Mp suppress Gd enhancement in acute demyelinating lesions, and this correlates with clinical improvement. 
Gold weight lid load as a secondary procedure. This paper discusses the use of gold weight lid load as a secondary procedure. By using three representative patients, I emphasize the following points: First, the dominance of the eye must be determined so that postoperative changes in the eyelid height can be anticipated. Second, in order to obtain an accurate weight of the implant needed, the restrictive effect on the eyelid from the previous surgery (a tarsorrhaphy or an encircling band) must first be eliminated. Third, to ensure the best result and the patient's comfort, lacrimal function, Bell's phenomenon, and levator function must be assessed. 
Radiofrequency current catheter ablation of accessory atrioventricular pathways. Tachyarrhythmias mediated by an accessory atrioventricular pathway and which are refractory to drug therapy have been treated surgically with variable success. Early results of direct-current catheter ablation were encouraging but were associated with complications such as barotrauma and the need for a general anaesthetic. We have investigated the endocardial application of radiofrequency current which is a potentially safer technique. Of 105 patients with an accessory atrioventricular pathway, 79 were located on the left side of the heart and 32 on the right side. Accessory pathway conduction was permanently abolished in 93 (89%) patients. Complications developed in 3 patients: thrombotic occlusion of a femoral artery, arteriovenous fistula formation at the site of groin puncture, and left ventricular rupture with cardiac tamponade after direct-current shocks. There were no deaths from the procedure. We conclude that radiofrequency current catheter ablation is both effective and safe for patients with symptomatic tachyarrhythmias mediated by accessory atrioventricular pathways. 
Differentiation of HL-60 cells into cells with the osteoclast phenotype. The osteoclast is the unique multinucleated cell that is responsible for bone degradation in both physiological and pathological circumstances. However, knowledge of the lineage of this inaccessible cell, the nature of its precursors, and the regulation of its formation and activation is limited and controversial. Here we show that the human promyelocytic cell line HL-60 has the potential, under the appropriate culture conditions, to differentiate into cells that have morphological and functional characteristics of osteoclasts, including multinucleation, presence of tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase activity, cross-reactivity with monoclonal antibodies that preferentially recognize osteoclasts, and capacity to resorb bone and respond to calcitonin. The multinucleated cells also contain high affinity receptors to calcitonin, in contrast to wild-type undifferentiated HL-60 cells. These data suggest that osteoclasts share a common precursor with hematopoietic cells. These undifferentiated and differentiated HL-60 cells should provide a unique model for study of the cell biology of human osteoclast differentiation, allowing molecular biological and biochemical studies heretofore not possible. 
Cancers of the maxillary sinus. Maxillary sinus cancers are rare as compared with cancers of other sites. Because the onset is insidious, they are at an advanced stage at diagnosis and therefore present a therapeutic challenge for local control. Traditionally, treatment has been surgery or irradiation, or a combination of the two. Local control and survival, however, remains poor. Numerous chemotherapeutic agents have shown activity against squamous cell cancers of the head and neck. In several studies the use of either neoadjuvant or concurrent chemotherapy has improved local control and survival when compared with historical controls. Randomized studies are needed to confirm the benefit of chemotherapy over the standard forms of surgical and radiation therapy. 
Oral monomorphic adenomas. Monomorphic adenomas of the oral cavity have a predilection for the anterior mouth, particularly the upper lip. Two of the monomorphic adenomas, the inverted ductal papilloma and the canalicular adenoma, are biologically benign, but unfamiliarity with their histopathologic appearance can lead to a misdiagnosis of malignancy. The clinical and pathologic features of each are presented. 
Patterns of blood-brain barrier breakdown in inflammatory demyelination. The evolution of the changes in the blood-brain barrier (BBB) in chronic relapsing experimental allergic encephalomyelitis (CREAE), a model of immune-mediated demyelination, has been studied by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI); gadolinium-DTPA (Gd-DTPA) was used to detect BBB breakdown by both quantitative and qualitative techniques. Animals with acute EAE were examined for comparison. In animals with CREAE an approximately linear relationship was found between the mean number of lesions enhancing with Gd-DTPA seen per MRI slice and the severity of clinical disability at relapse. In addition, a direct relationship was seen between the duration of clinical relapse and the duration of enhancement with Gd-DTPA for lesions associated with the relapse. Lesions studied in animals having entered a progressive phase of disease showed the most sustained BBB breakdown. These observations suggest that BBB breakdown is important in the development of clinical signs in inflammatory demyelination. In CREAE, areas of focal enhancement with Gd-DTPA could usually be clearly defined at a time of clinical relapse. In slices free of focal lesions, no abnormal Gd-DTPA leakage could be detected using a quantitative method. In contrast, in acute EAE no focal lesions were visible, but significant leakage was detected by measurement. No change was found in T2 relaxation times in CREAE or acute EAE. The pattern of BBB breakdown in inflammatory demyelination evolves from a diffuse shortlived disturbance in acute EAE to a more focal and prolonged breakdown in animals with chronic relapsing and progressive disease. The broad similarities in the pattern of BBB breakdown seen in CREAE and multiple sclerosis support the hypothesis that the initial vascular changes in the human disease are due to inflammation which could be mediated immunologically. 
Prospective quality-of-life analysis after palliative photoablation for the treatment of malignant dysphagia. Forty patients were treated for the relief of malignant dysphagia by using laser photoablation. Their quality of life was assessed before the start of treatment and at monthly intervals until death. Two methods were used, a physician's assessment (QL index) and a patient's self-assessment, the linear analogue self-assessment (LASA). There was significant correlation between assessments done at different times by different physicians (QL index rs, 0.786; P less than 0.001; LASA rs, 0.865; P less than 0.001). The correlation coefficient of the QL index and the LASA score with the patient's dysphagia grade was 0.459 and 0.336, respectively. The patient's swallowing ability, QL index, and LASA all were improved significantly at some time after laser therapy. The mean survival was 16 weeks with 58% of patients dying at home, 28% in the hospital, and 18% in a hospice. It was concluded that laser photoablation improves the overall quality of life in patients with malignant dysphagia. 
Postradiation lower motor neuron syndrome presenting as monomelic amyotrophy. Monomelic amyotrophy developed 16 months, nine and 12 years after irradiation of the lumbosacral spinal cord for seminoma in one patient and for Hodgkin's disease in two others. In two patients, involvement was clinically limited to one leg, with a subacute course followed by plateau in the first case and with progressive worsening in the second one. In the third patient, the course was progressive with involvement of the other lower limb occurring five years later. From clinical and electrophysiological data, it seems probable that the disease process was a result of a selective injury to the lower motor neuron in the lower spinal cord. 
KTP laser stapedotomy: is it safe? Recent published concerns about the potential for visible light lasers to injure the inner ear have led to differing conclusions. While one has advised cautious application of a visible light laser, another eschewed visible light lasers in favor of the CO2 laser. Others have anguished over the efficacy of stapes surgeons as numbers of suitable candidates for otosclerosis surgery decline. In three years' experience with the KTP-532 laser, 80 primary and revision stapedotomies have been completed by this author. The author's experience with low morbidity and high air-bone gap closure rates are presented. The absence of apparent cochlear injury suggests that properly used KTP laser systems are safe. Competitive results were obtained with less than prolific numbers of stapes surgeries. 
Prostacyclin production and mediation of adenylate cyclase activity in the pulmonary artery. Alterations after prolonged hypoxia in the rat. Prostacyclin is a critical mediator of structure and function in the pulmonary circulation, causing both the inhibition of vascular smooth muscle growth and vasodilation via the stimulation of adenylate cyclase. To examine the potential role of alterations in prostacyclin production or mechanism of action in chronic hypoxic pulmonary hypertension, we determined the effects of prolonged (7 d) in vivo hypoxia on in vitro prostacyclin synthesis and mediation of adenylate cyclase activity in rat main pulmonary arteries. In control arteries prostacyclin production exceeded that of prostaglandin (PG) E2 by 25-fold, with 42% originating from the endothelium. Studies utilizing indomethacin revealed that endogenous prostaglandins mediate at least 69% of basal adenylate cyclase activity. Prostacyclin-stimulated enzyme activity was enhanced by exogenous GTP, indicating that this is a receptor-mediated process involving G protein amplification. Comparable dose-related responses to prostacyclin and PGE2 suggest that these agents may activate a common receptor. After 7 d of in vivo hypoxia there was a 2.7-fold increase in in vitro prostacyclin production, with equivalent increases in synthesis in the endothelium and vascular smooth muscle. However, despite this increase there was no change in basal adenylate cyclase activity, and this was associated with attenuated sensitivity of the enzyme to prostacyclin stimulation. Concomitant diminution of the response to beta-adrenergic stimulation, with previously-demonstrated beta receptor downregulation and unaltered postreceptor-mediated activity, suggests that the blunted response to prostacyclin is due to receptor downregulation. Parallel studies of the thoracic aorta indicated that these changes are specific to the pulmonary artery. It is postulated that attenuation of the response of adenylate cyclase to prostacyclin may contribute to the structural changes and hypertension observed in the pulmonary vasculature of the rat with chronic hypoxia. 
Effects of tissue-type plasminogen activator and anisoylated plasminogen streptokinase activator complex on mortality in acute myocardial infarction. An overview of eight randomized controlled trials of tissue-type plasminogen activator (Alteplase or Duteplase) and 10 of anisoylated plasminogen streptokinase activator complex (Anistreplase) showed that the odds of early death were reduced by 29% by tissue-type plasminogen activator and 46% by anisoylated plasminogen streptokinase activator complex, with overlapping 95% confidence intervals. Although the beneficial effects of both agents are consistent and are strengthened when all the trials are considered together, the available data do not permit comparisons of the relative efficacy of these two agents with each other or with streptokinase. 
Clinical patterns and associated conditions in chronic uveitis. We determined the relative frequencies of the different types of chronic uveitis, and the possible associated conditions, among 400 consecutive patients with chronic uveitis examined during the years 1982 through 1988. Of the 400 patients, 183 (45.75%) had anterior uveitis, 98 (24.5%) ahd panuveitis, 61 (15.3%) had intermediate uveitis, and 58 (14.5%) had isolated posterior uveitis. Only four of the 98 patients with panuveitis (4.1%) were considered idiopathic after a comprehensive examination, whereas 94 of the 183 patients with anterior uveitis (51.4%) were similarly classified. We found an associated condition in 242 of the 400 patients of the study group (60.5%). Of these 242 patients, 61 had Behcet's disease, which constituted the most frequently encountered associated condition in this study. Of the 61 patients with Behcet's disease, 58 had panuveitis and constituted 59.2% of the panuveitis group. Of the 61 patients with intermediate uveitis, 17 (27.9%) had a concurrent disease. An associated condition was found in 95% and 96.2% of patients with unilateral and bilateral panuveitis, respectively, but in none of the patients with unilateral intermediate uveitis. Environmental, cultural, or genetic factors may be accountable for the differences discovered between our findings and those of previously published studies from the United States and England with respect to relative frequencies of some of the associated diseases in patients with chronic uveitis. 
Postprandial hypotension: microneurographic analysis and treatment with vasopressin. To clarify the mechanism of postprandial hypotension (PPH), we made microneurographic analyses of patients with PPH and 10 healthy controls by recording multi-unit vasoconstrictive impulses of muscle sympathetic nerve activity (MSNA) directly from the tibial nerve fascicles during a glucose tolerance test. Oral intake of 75 grams glucose in 225 ml of water produced significant and prolonged hypotension in all patients and an increase in MSNA in all healthy subjects. Insulin and glucose responses were not significantly correlated with arterial blood pressure reduction. PPH was prevented by an infusion of vasopressin (0.3 U/min) given before glucose intake. These results suggest that PPH is caused by the lack of sympathetic compensation for the systemic hypotensive stress of splanchnic blood pooling that occurs after food ingestion, and that prior treatment with vasopressin reduces the portal venous flow by constricting the splanchnic vessels in patients with PPH. 
Cardiac pacemaker in high spinal cord injury. Bradycardia followed by cardiac arrest is well documented as a complication of acute injury to the cervical spinal cord. This life-threatening bradycardia is attributed to an imbalance in the autonomic nervous system resulting from dissociation of the parasympathetic from the sympathetic responses during the stage of spinal shock. A patient with a C2 complete quadriplegia secondary to birth trauma who experienced symptomatic bradycardia, continuing for 21 months after injury despite intensive medical management, is reported. Clinical improvement followed insertion of a cardiac pacemaker. Possible etiologies for the continuation of abnormal bradycardia episodes after the resolution of spinal shock are discussed. Cardiac pacemaker implantation is advocated for patients with high cervical spinal cord injuries and continuing symptomatic bradycardia not responding to medical measures. 
Costal fringe. Costal fringe consists of a bandlike pattern of venous telangiectases along the anterolateral costal margins. It is a common and easily recognized entity, usually seen in elderly men. Association with underlying disease is not well established. To assess the frequency of costal fringe in a healthy young adult population, we examined 1523 active duty Air Force personnel (1203 men and 320 women) between the ages of 17 and 34 years. All subjects were human immunodeficiency virus seronegative; none had known hyperestrogenic or other disease states. Costal fringe was present in only three individuals, all men, a frequency of 0.2%. Costal fringe is a rare finding in healthy young adults. 
Branched-chain-enriched amino acid solutions in patients with liver failure: an early example of nutritional pharmacology. The use of BCAA in the treatment of hepatic failure has been controversial. Even in retrospect, it is difficult to know why this controversy existed and why it has been so emotional, except for the fact that such a treatment modality has flown in the face of conventional therapy of hepatic encephalopathy, and also, probably more importantly, directly attacked some of the cherished notions of the nature of hepatic encephalopathy. Time and distance have allowed some of the controversy to die down, and as time has elapsed it has become clear that at least in the area of nutritional support of patients with hepatic failure, BCAA are the preferred alternative to treat patients who are otherwise protein intolerant. A recent unbiased review using the techniques of meta-analysis has concluded that the BCAA are efficacious for the treatment of patients with hepatic encephalopathy. Since this manuscript was completed another study has been reported. In this study, it was notable that those patients treated with oral BCAA became neurologically normal, a finding which the authors found very striking. 
Comparative evaluation of chenodeoxycholic and ursodeoxycholic acids in obese patients. Effects on biliary lipid metabolism during weight maintenance and weight reduction. Obesity is a condition associated with an increased frequency of gallstone disease. This study attempted to evaluate the comparative effects of two gallstone-dissolving agents, chenodeoxycholic acid and ursodeoxycholic acid, on bile acid metabolism and biliary lipid secretion in obese subjects in order to identify the bile acid of choice in preventing and treating gallstone disease in obesity. Twenty obese subjects (greater than 120% ideal body wt) were randomly treated with ursodeoxycholic acid (10 mg.kg-1.day-1.1 mo-1) and then with chenodeoxycholic acid (15 mg.kg-1.day-1.1 mo-1) or with chenodeoxycholic acid first and then with ursodeoxycholic acid. Patients 1-10 were studied while eating an unrestricted weight-maintenance diet, whereas patients 11-20 were eating a 1080-kcal/d hypocaloric diet. Biliary lipid composition, cholesterol saturation index, and biliary bile acid pattern were evaluated in all subjects before and after each treatment period; in subjects 6-10 and 16-20, biliary lipid secretion rates and bile acid pool size were also evaluated. Both ursodeoxycholic acid and chenodeoxycholic acid decreased cholesterol outputs and cholesterol saturation index. However, during the weight-maintenance period the decrease induced by chenodeoxycholic acid was not significant. Biliary cholesterol outputs and cholesterol saturation index were always lower during ursodeoxycholic acid administration than during chenodeoxycholic acid therapy. Ursodeoxycholic acid levels during ursodeoxycholic acid administration and chenodeoxycholic acid levels during chenodeoxycholic acid administration increased in bile to 50% and 77%, respectively, of total bile acid levels. Bile acid pool size remained unchanged during chenodeoxycholic acid administration and was significantly reduced by ursodeoxycholic acid administration during the weight-reduction period. In conclusion, ursodeoxycholic acid in obese subjects seems more effective than chenodeoxycholic acid, at least during weight maintenance, in reducing cholesterol saturation of bile. This effect is related to a significant decrease of biliary cholesterol output. 
Insulin attenuation of vasoconstrictor responses to phenylephrine in Zucker lean and obese rats. Recent data from this laboratory indicate that insulin resistant obese Zucker rats exhibit hypertension associated with exaggerated in vitro vascular reactivity to phenylephrine, serotonin, and KCl, and we have found insulin to attenuate vascular reactivity responses to these agonists. Accordingly, in the present study we evaluated the possibility that exaggerated vascular reactivity responses in obese Zucker rats may result from insulin resistance and a consequent failure of insulin to attenuate vasoactive responses. Thoracic aortae were isolated from male 16 week old lean and obese Zucker rats, and replicate helical strips from each animal were suspended in a muscle bath under a resting tension of 1.4 g in the presence or absence of insulin (0.1 mU/mL) for 1 h. The insulin was then washed out, and vascular reactivity responses to phenylephrine were determined. The obese rats exhibited greater reactivity to phenylephrine (ED50:1.10 +/- 90 X 10(-8) v 7.57 +/- 0.88 X 10(-10) mol/L in lean and obese rats, respectively, P less than .025). Insulin caused a significant attenuation of the contractile response in both the lean and obese aortae. However, lean rats exhibited a markedly greater attenuation than the obese rats (46.0 +/- 17.0 v 17.8 +/- 7.5% attenuation in the lean and obese rats, respectively, P less than .01). These data suggest that increased vascular reactivity responses in obese Zucker rats may result from their insulin resistant state and, consequently, a diminished ability of insulin to attenuate vasoconstrictor responses. 
Stimulation of protein synthesis in human tumours by parenteral nutrition: evidence for modulation of tumour growth. Eighteen patients with localized colorectal carcinoma were randomized to receive intravenous nutrition or to be fasted during the 24 h before surgery. Protein synthesis, an index of tumour growth, was then measured by the incorporation of [13C]leucine into tumour protein immediately before surgery. The mean (s.e.m.) rate of tumour protein synthesis in patients receiving nutrition (42.7(3.5) per cent per day) was 89 per cent higher than the rate in the fasted group (22.6(1.9) per cent per day) (P = 0.002). As tumours consist of a variety of different cell types, in vitro rates of protein synthesis were measured in malignant cells isolated from colorectal tumours and cultured with autologous serum obtained from the patient in either the fasted or the fed state. There was a mean increase of 81 per cent in protein synthesis when fed rather than fasted serum was used (P less than 0.02), indicating that the malignant cells themselves respond to nutrient supply. This increase in tumour protein synthesis provides the first evidence in vivo that the exogenous supply of nutrients can modulate the rate of growth of a human tumour. 
A pathophysiological interpretation of unresponsiveness to spironolactone in a stepped-care approach to the diuretic treatment of ascites in nonazotemic cirrhotic patients. It has been hypothesized that the magnitude of proximal sodium reabsorption affects the response to aldosterone antagonists in nonazotemic cirrhotic patients with ascites. To verify this hypothesis, we evaluated intrarenal sodium handling by lithium clearance in 51 nonazotemic ascitic cirrhotic patients and in 23 controls who were maintained on the same low-sodium diet (80 mmol/day). Seven of 51 cirrhotic patients underwent spontaneous diuresis, whereas 44 required diuretic treatment. Treatment was started with spironolactone at a dose of 150 mg once daily. The dose was increased to 300 mg and then to 500 mg once daily if no response ensued. Cirrhotic patients who did not experience ascites mobilization with 500 mg spironolactone were then treated with a combined diuretic regimen that included spironolactone at a fixed dose (500 mg once daily) and furosemide at an initial dose of 50 mg once daily. The dose was increased to 100, 150 and 200 mg once daily if no response was noticed. Response to diuretic treatment was defined as body weight loss greater than 700 gm every 3 days until ascites became clinically undetectable. Nonresponders (43%) to spironolactone showed lower sodium fractional excretion (0.34% +/- 0.28% vs. 0.80% +/- 0.50%; p less than 0.001) because of a lower fractional sodium delivery to the distal tubule (18.2% +/- 5.8% vs. 23.4% +/- 7.2%; p less than 0.025) than responders. 
The effect of sodium hyaluronate on the outcome of trabeculectomy. The outcome of trabeculectomy with the use of sodium hyaluronate was investigated in 99 trabeculectomies and compared with the results achieved in an earlier series of trabeculectomies without the use of sodium hyaluronate. The use of sodium hyaluronate facilitated performance of the surgery and tended to reduce the severity of postoperative shallow anterior chamber and intraoperative bleeding. It remains to be shown whether it also may prevent lens opacity increase. 
Prevalence of primary fibromyalgia in the Finnish population. OBJECTIVE--To obtain descriptive epidemiological data on fibromyalgia and its components in a representative sample of the Finnish population. DESIGN--Cross sectional study of 8000 Finns aged 30 or more invited for screening and a main examination for musculoskeletal disorders and other major disorders. SETTING--A mobile clinic. POPULATION--7217 subjects who attended the screening phase; 3434 subjects positive on screening who attended the main examination for musculoskeletal disorders. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES--Musculoskeletal, mental, and other symptoms detected by interview and questionnaire; results of standardised clinical examination of the musculoskeletal system; operational definition of fibromyalgia; mortality at 10 years. RESULTS--The prevalence of fibromyalgia was low (54 cases; 0.75%) and related to age (peak prevalence at 55-64 years), female sex (twice as prevalent in women), occupation (no cases among 1596 white collar professionals), level of education (strong inverse gradient), and high levels of physical stress at work. No significant associations were found with body mass index, smoking, or mental stress at work. The prevalence of fibromyalgia was sensitive to even minor modifications of the definition. Fibromyalgia was strongly coincident with many other disorders, especially musculoskeletal conditions. Fibromyalgia did not predict mortality. CONCLUSION--Descriptive epidemiological data offer little support for the concept of fibromyalgia. 
Comparison of postoperative complications between saphenous vein and IMA grafts to left anterior descending coronary artery. Considerable controversy exists regarding relative morbidity associated with the saphenous vein graft (SVG) and internal mammary artery (IMA) graft in patients undergoing myocardial revascularization. As a part of the cooperative study on use of antiplatelet drugs for graft patency, operative and postoperative data were prospectively collected on 1,150 patients who underwent either SVG (n = 656) or IMA anastomosis (n = 494) to the left anterior descending coronary artery. There were no differences in baseline characteristics of patients, distribution of randomization among treatment groups, and total number of distal anastomoses performed between the two groups. The aortic cross-clamp time, cardiopulmonary bypass duration, operative time, and chest tube drainage were greater (p = 0.0001) in the patients with IMA grafts compared with SVG. However, there was no difference in the operative mortality rate, the amount of blood and blood products received, the reoperation rate for control of postoperative bleeding, and incidence of wound complications between the two groups. The early and 1-year patency rates for the IMA were slightly but not significantly better than the SVG patency rates (92.8% versus 90.1% for 1-year patency; p = 0.309). In conclusion, use of IMA is associated with a longer operative time as well as increased postoperative bleeding compared with the SVG. It, however, does not increase operative mortality or postoperative morbidity. 
Immunoreactive endometritis. A benign polyclonal lymphoid proliferation of the endometrium which bears morphological resemblance to the malignant lymphoma is found among women with bleeding disturbances. Seven previous cases have so far been reported in the literature. A retrospective examination of 11,648 endometrial specimens revealed 287 examples of chronic endometritis (2.5%) of which 29 displayed lymphoid proliferation. We found no evidence of malignant haematologic disorder after a median observation of 68 months and no positive association with prior or present infectious disease. Histological follow-up of ten patients showed that changes could persist for up to 12 months. We name this benign condition 'immunoreactive endometritis'. 
The effect of enteric-coated aspirin on the morning increase in platelet activity. In vitro platelet aggregability to adenosine diphosphate (ADP) and epinephrine increases in the morning, as does the frequency of myocardial infarction. A single-blind, randomized, cross-over study of 15 healthy males was conducted to determine: (1) if other measures of platelet activity show a morning increases and (2) if aspirin eliminates any increases in platelet activity detected. Subjects received 325 mg of enteric-coated aspirin (ECA) or placebo. During placebo therapy,platelet thromboxane A2 production (following collagen stimulation) increased significantly after the subjects got up, as did platelet aggregability to ADP, epinephrine, and collagen. ECA markedly reduced baseline platelet thromboxane A2 production and eliminated the increase after the subjects got up. It also abolished biphasic aggregation in response to epinephrine and ADP (thereby eliminating the morning increase in aggregability to these agents), lengthened collagen lag time, reduced synergistic aggregation to combined agonists, was effective on day 2, and did not alter increases of tissue plasminogen activator that occurred following the subjects' arising. If aspirin prevents myocardial infarction by its antiplatelet action, as seems likely, the preferential reduction of morning infarction observed in the Physicians' Health Study, and the demonstration that aspirin eliminates the morning increase in platelet activity, suggest that the morning increase in myocardial infarction is due in part to a concurrent relatively modest increase in platelet activity. 
Independent risk factors for hepatocellular carcinoma in French drinkers. The aim of this study was to assess whether markers of hepatitis B virus or hepatitis C virus infection are independent risk factors for hepatocellular carcinoma in drinkers after adjustment for three known risk factors: cirrhosis, age and male sex. Among 2,015 consecutive drinkers admitted, hepatitis C virus antibodies were found by sensitive radioimmunoassay in 1,259. The following five factors have been identified and ranked as risk factors for hepatocellular carcinoma in unidimensional and regression analysis: cirrhosis (p less than 0.001), age (p less than 0.001), male sex (p less than 0.001), presence of HBsAg (p less than 0.001) and presence of hepatitis C virus antibodies (p less than 0.03). Among drinkers with cirrhosis, the patients with hepatocellular carcinoma were older (64 +/- 11 yr vs. 56 +/- 9 yr; p less than 0.001), were more often male (93% vs. 65%; p less than 0.0001) and had higher prevalence of HBsAg (9% vs. 2%; p = 0.02) and hepatitis C virus antibodies (41% vs. 26%; p = 0.02). A simple algorithm permitted us to identify a high-risk population of drinkers: the male cirrhotic patient older than 50 yr. The relative risk of hepatocellular carcinoma in this selected population was 17.7 (95% confidence interval = 9.0 to 37.5; p less than 0.0001). From a pragmatic point of view, the detection of HBsAg or hepatitis C virus antibodies, although independently associated with hepatocellular carcinoma, is not useful in increasing the diagnostic value of this algorithm because of the poor sensitivity of these tests. The weak relationships observed between hepatitis C virus antibodies and hepatocellular carcinoma needs confirmation by more accurate tests. 
The modified buccal musculomucosal flap method for cleft palate surgery. We have reported previously on a palatoplasty method, called the T-shaped musculomucosal buccal flap method, for the primary repair of a cleft palate. This method has been used on more than 90 patients, and satisfactory outcomes have resulted in terms of maxillar development, the prevention of fistulation, and verbal functions. However, 14.3 percent of these patients exhibited a velopharyngeal incompetence that showed no potential improvement through training. In the majority of these patients, the entire raw surface of the oral cavity side could not be covered with a buccal musculomucosal flap, and as a result, postoperative contraction of the soft palate occurred. Thus a new surgical method has proven effective in which both buccal musculomucosal flaps are used as an oral lining, the nasal mucosa having been extended by Z-plasty. We have performed 25 operations using this new method and have observed no postoperative contractions of the soft palate, notwithstanding two cases (8.0 percent) of postoperative fistulation. 
Primary seminoma of the seminal vesicle: report of a case. We report on the clinical and histological findings of a primary extragonadal germ cell tumor that was proved to be a seminoma of the seminal vesicle. The patient had left ureteral obstruction at diagnosis. The testes were normal on physical and ultrasound examination, and the retroperitoneum was free of tumor. There was no recurrence 8 months postoperatively. 
Carcinoid tumors: the relationship between clinical presentation and the extent of disease. In this study the relationship between the initial clinical presentation and the extent of tumor progression was determined in a group of 31 patients with carcinoid tumors. The proportion of patients with symptomatic tumors was similar to those patients with carcinoid tumors that were incidentally found (55% versus 45%; SE = 0.089). Symptoms were caused by metastatic tumor in nine (30%) of the patients and by local effects of the primary tumor in eight (26%) of the patients. The patients with symptoms had a significantly increased frequency of metastatic disease, even when the symptoms were due to the primary tumor, compared to patients with no symptoms (76% versus 7%; p less than 0.001). Tumor size was related to the presence of symptoms and metastases. Symptoms were most common when the size of the primary tumor was greater than 1.0 cm (p less than 0.005), although the rate of metastases increased when primary tumors were 2.0 cm and larger (p less than 0.01). These results indicate that the presence of symptoms or a primary tumor 2.0 cm or larger are associated with an increased risk of metastatic disease in patients with carcinoid tumors. These patients should be treated with wide resection of the primary tumor and its lymphatic drainage. 
PUVA-induced lymphomatoid papulosis in a patient with mycosis fungoides. The occurrence of lymphomatoid papulosis in patients with cutaneous lymphoma, particularly mycosis fungoides, has been described in medical literature. A 68-year-old woman affected by mycosis fungoides in the plaque stage noticed that multiple papulonodular lesions of lymphomatoid papulosis developed suddenly after a few sessions of PUVA therapy. The PUVA induction of lymphomatoid papulosis was confirmed by the appearance of new lesions after a second cycle of PUVA exposure on a limited area of the body. Complete regression of all PUVA-induced lymphomatoid papulosis lesions was achieved within a few weeks with oral prednisone and topical steroids. During the entire treatment the patches and plaques of mycosis fungoides persisted unchanged. 
Primary gastric mantle zone lymphoma. A report of two cases. We report two cases of primary gastric mantle zone lymphoma. Histologic examination revealed numerous lymphoid vague nodules in the mucosa and submucosa of the resected stomach. The neoplastic cells in these nodules were slightly larger than small lymphocytes and had more or less cleaved nuclei. Immunostaining on paraffin-embedded sections showed that the neoplastic cells in the nodules of these cases were LN-1- and LN-2+ and had monotypic immunoglobulin (IgM-lambda and IgM-kappa, respectively). Immunostaining on frozen tissue specimens showed that the neoplastic cells or nodules were positive for surface IgM, surface IgD, alkaline phosphatase, and DRC-1. One third to two thirds of the cells were Leu-1+ (CD5+). These results indicated that these cases were primary gastric mantle zone lymphoma. More attention should be paid to primary gastric mantle zone lymphoma because this disease might be erroneously diagnosed as either pseudolymphoma or reactive lymphoid hyperplasia of the stomach. 
Multiple sclerosis: histopathologic and MR and/or CT correlation in 37 cases at biopsy and three cases at autopsy. The authors retrospectively reviewed the cases of 40 patients with biopsy- or autopsy-proved inflammatory demyelination consistent with multiple sclerosis (MS); each patient underwent magnetic resonance (MR) and/or computed tomographic (CT) imaging. In review of the 32 MR and 30 CT examinations, three predominant radiologic patterns were apparent: (a) relatively small homogeneous lesions with no or minimal diffuse enhancement; (b) hypoattenuating lesions on CT scans and hypointense lesions on short-TR MR images, with a contrast material-enhanced, isoattenuating or isointense ring; and (c) lesions that were more infiltrative and ill defined, with mixed attenuation and signal intensity and scattered enhancement. A common radiologic feature was lack of mass effect or edema in white matter surrounding even large lesions. In all but four patients the lesions were classified as active by using both histologic and clinical criteria. Histologically active lesions had various radiologic appearances; however, in all contrast-enhanced studies they demonstrated some form of enhancement. Inactive lesions were homogeneously hypoattenuating on CT scans, hypointense on short-TR MR images, and hyperintense on unenhanced, long-TR MR images. 
Recognition of gonadotroph adenomas in women BACKGROUND. Pituitary adenomas that arise from the gonadotroph cells are being recognized with increasing frequency in men, but they are still rarely recognized in women. This rarity could be the result of an actual difference in occurrence or of greater difficulty in recognition. The tumors are usually recognized in men more than 50 years old, but elevated serum gonadotropin levels in women of that age could be produced by normal gonadotroph cells. METHODS. Because the stimulation of follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), luteinizing hormone (LH), and the beta subunit of LH (LH beta) by thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH) is a characteristic of gonadotroph adenomas in men, we administered TRH to 16 women with apparently nonsecreting pituitary macroadenomas and measured serum FSH, LH, LH beta, and the glycoprotein hormone alpha subunit every 15 minutes for 90 minutes before and 90 minutes after. The results were compared with the responses in 16 healthy women matched for age and in 10 women with macroadenomas secreting prolactin, growth hormone, or corticotropin. The tumors from 12 of the women with nonsecreting adenomas were cultured, and the secretion of FSH, LH, and LH beta in culture was determined. RESULTS. Eleven of the 16 women with apparently nonsecreting adenomas had significant increases in serum LH beta in response to TRH, 3 had FSH responses, and 4 had LH responses. None of the 16 healthy women and none of the 10 women with secreting macroadenomas had LH beta, FSH, or LH responses to TRH. Ten of the 12 adenomas that were cultured secreted readily detectable amounts of FSH, LH, and LH beta, and their secretion in vitro correlated with the patients' responses to TRH in vivo. CONCLUSIONS. Most apparently nonsecreting pituitary macroadenomas in women arise from gonadotroph cells. The majority of these can be recognized, even in postmenopausal women, by the serum LH beta responses to TRH, and some can be recognized by the responses of serum FSH and LH. 
Experimental model of colon cancer: recurrences after surgery alone or associated with intraperitoneal 5-fluorouracil chemotherapy. The liver is the most frequent site of metastases in colon cancer. No good animal model has been available to help improve the treatment of liver metastases or their prevention after resection of a primary colon cancer. The aim of this study was to develop a model of colon cancer induced by azoxymethane in the rat and to study the outcome after surgical resection alone or in association with intraperitoneal chemotherapy (5-fluorouracil (5-FU). Three hundred male Wistar rats received subcutaneous azoxymethane (10 mg/kg body weight/week) for 12 weeks. Eighty-three rats with isolated colon cancer underwent total colectomy; 40 of these rats with no metastases were randomized into two groups: surgery alone or surgery plus 5-FU (5 mg/kg body weight/day) for 5 days after surgery. Thirty rats were able to be evaluated. At autopsy, peritoneal carcinomatosis and liver metastases were more frequent in the control group than after adjuvant treatment with 5-FU (27.7 percent vs. 0, P less than 0.05; and 22.2 percent vs. 0, P less than 0.05, respectively). The rates of peritoneal and hepatic recurrence after resection of the primary cancer indicate that the model mimics the natural history of human colon cancer. In this model, 5-FU reduced the rate of peritoneal carcinomatosis and liver metastases but did not influence survival. 
New pathologic observations in juvenile onset parkinsonism with dystonia. A patient with hereditary juvenile onset parkinsonism with dystonia died at age 39. There were Lewy bodies and regionally selective neuronal damage in the substantia nigra pars compacta. These changes closely resemble those seen in Parkinson's disease, and emphasize the selective vulnerability of the ventral tier of the pars compacta in these degenerations. 
The role of the right hemisphere in emotional communication. Previous research has established that patients with right hemisphere damage (RHD) are impaired in the comprehension of emotional prosody and facial expression. There are several explanations for this impairment. It may reflect defective acoustic and visuospatial analysis, disruption of nonverbal communicative representations, or a disturbance in the comprehension of emotional meaning. In order to examine these hypotheses, we asked RHD patients, left hemisphere damaged patients (LHD) and normal controls (NC) to judge the emotional content of sentences describing nonverbal expressions, and sentences describing emotional situations. We found that RHD subjects performed normally in their ability to infer the emotion conveyed by sentences describing situations. However, RHD patients were impaired in relation to both LHD and NC in the capacity to judge the emotional content of sentences depicting facial, prosodic, and gestural expressions, suggesting a disruption of nonverbal communicative representations. 
Focal nodular hyperplasia of the liver: assessment with contrast-enhanced TurboFLASH MR imaging. Twenty-two patients with 25 cases of focal nodular hyperplasia (FNH) proved with pathologic study were imaged with a TurboFLASH (fast low angle shot) sequence combined with bolus administration of gadolinium tetraazacyclododecanetetraacetic acid (DOTA), spin-echo (SE) T2-weighted sequences, and postcontrast T1-weighted sequences. FNH-liver signal-difference-to-noise ratios were quantified; the features of the central scar were qualitatively analyzed. On SE T2-weighted images, all FNHs were hyperintense; in two cases the central scar exhibited a high signal intensity associated with hypointense areas corresponding to fibrous tissue within the branches of the scar. Unenhanced TurboFLASH images always demonstrated the FNHs as hypointense and always depicted the central scar as a hypointense area within the lesion. After bolus injection, arterial enhancement of FNH was clearly seen, and in 10 of 25 lesions, enhancement within the scar was seen 40-80 seconds after injection. Both unenhanced and enhanced TurboFLASH sequences produced the best signal-difference-to-noise ratios in comparison with T2-weighted images. 
Flexible sigmoidoscopy screening for asymptomatic colorectal disease in patients with and without inguinal hernia. Several studies have evaluated the diagnostic value of flexible sigmoidoscopy for screening asymptomatic patients before hernia repair. All have shown a 16% to 28% incidence of neoplastic (malignant or premalignant) lesions. None of these studies compared a similar group of asymptomatic patients without hernia to determine whether the incidence is increased in patients with hernias. We reviewed 87 consecutive cases of male surgical patients without hernia or any anorectal disease who had flexible sigmoidoscopy between June 1986 and December 1989 (group 1) and compared them with a group of hernia patients that we previously reported (group 2). Patients with stool positive for occult blood were excluded from this study. Examinations in both groups were done under the direct supervision of an attending surgeon (W.W., C.S.C., or J.K.). No significant difference was noted between group 1 and group 2 in mean age (mean 65.6 vs 59.7 years), rate of normal findings (68% vs 63%), and incidence of neoplastic lesions (14% vs 22%). All patients tolerated the procedure well, and there were no complications. 
Inhibition of neutral endopeptidase (EC 3.4.24.11) leads to an atrial natriuretic factor-mediated natriuretic, diuretic and antihypertensive response in rodents. 1. Atrial natriuretic factor is metabolized by neutral endopeptidase (atriopeptidase; EC 3.4.24.11) in vitro. Inhibitors of this enzyme have been reported to prolong the half-life of atrial natriuretic factor in vivo and to potentiate the renal and haemodynamic effects of exogenous atrial natriuretic factor. 2. (+/-)-Candoxatrilat, a selective neutral endopeptidase inhibitor, potentiated the natriuretic and diuretic response to volume loading in anaesthetized rats. Part of the response to volume loading and the potentiation by (+/-)-candoxatrilat was prevented by a polyclonal atrial natriuretic factor antiserum. The diuretic and natriuretic responses evoked by hydrochlorothiazide were not altered by the antiserum. 3. (+/-)-Candoxatrilat reduced systolic blood pressure of one-kidney deoxycorticosterone acetate-salt hypertensive rats for over 5 h. This response was abolished by pretreatment with atrial natriuretic factor antiserum. 4. These data demonstrate that the neutral endopeptidase inhibitor (+/-)-candoxatrilat has natriuretic/diuretic and antihypertensive effects in rodents, and that these effects are mediated via endogenous atrial natriuretic factor. 
Clinical use of ultrasound biomicroscopy. The authors have developed a method of obtaining images of cross-sections of the intact anterior globe at microscopic resolution. High-frequency ultrasound transducers (50-100 MHz) have been developed and incorporated into a clinical B-scan device capable of producing images in the living human eye to a depth of approximately 4 mm at an axial and lateral resolution approaching 20 microns. Clinical use of this instrument is no more difficult than conventional immersion ultrasonography. The authors' results in a series of 14 clinical cases have shown that this method can provide information unavailable from any other imaging technique. Anterior segment tumors difficult to define with conventional ultrasound can be measured and the extent of invasion determined. Differentiation of tissue on the basis of internal acoustic characteristics is aided by the very fine backscatter speckle patterns at these frequencies. Pathology behind anterior segment opacities can be imaged in detail and the ability to image angle structures in cross-section allows a new quantitative method of gonioscopy. The ability to define the relationship of the iris, posterior chamber, zonules, ciliary body, and lens is potentially helpful in understanding mechanisms of glaucoma. Ocular structures can be measured with increased accuracy. Clinical ultrasound biomicroscopy (UBM) has shown significant potential as an aid in diagnoses of ocular disease. 
Multicenter comparison of once- and twice-daily isradipine to hydrochlorothiazide for the treatment of hypertension in elderly patients. After 8 weeks of isradipine, a twice-a-day dihydropyridine calcium channel blocker, 49% of elderly patients showed a complete response (sitting diastolic blood pressure less than or equal to 85 mm Hg) and 36% showed a partial response (sitting diastolic blood pressure decrease greater than or equal to 10 mm Hg) for an 85% total response rate. Hydrochlorothiazide gave a complete response in 36% of the patients and a partial response in 33%, for a 69% total response rate (p less than 0.0046). Because elderly subjects have reduced clearance for many drugs, we determined how those who responded to twice-a-day administration would respond to once-a-day administration. After 4 weeks of isradipine administered once a day, 54% of the patients showed a complete or partial response, whereas 38% of the patients who were changed to placebo showed a response. In contrast, 82% of patients receiving hydrochlorothiazide once a day showed a response, whereas 60% of patients who were changed to placebo showed a response. These data indicate that the standard formulation of isradipine was not effective when administered once a day. 
Tuberculous bronchial stenosis: CT findings in 28 cases. Bronchial stenosis is a complication of tuberculous parenchymal or lymph node disease and may adversely affect its treatment. Findings on plain radiographs may be nonspecific or simulate malignancy. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the role of CT in diagnosing this abnormality. We reviewed the findings in 28 patients who underwent CT to evaluate bronchial stenosis proved by bronchoscopy. Eighteen had evidence of tuberculosis on bronchial biopsy. In the other 10 the biopsy findings were nonspecific, but tuberculous lesions were elsewhere in the thorax. Twelve patients (43%) had CT findings of concentric bronchial stenosis, uniform thickening of the bronchial wall, and involvement of a long segment of the bronchi. In 14 patients (50%), CT showed obliteration of bronchial outlines by adjacent lymphadenopathy, parenchymal consolidation, and absence of intraluminal air. In two patients, the abnormality was not visible on CT. Our experience shows that CT is useful for identifying bronchial stenosis caused by tuberculosis. However, the findings vary, and in more than half of the patients concentric narrowing and uniform thickening of the bronchi are not seen. 
Magnetic resonance imaging evaluation of focal computed tomography abnormality in epilepsy. Sixty-seven patients with epilepsy and isolated enhancing computed tomography (CT) scan lesion were studied with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Fifty-six patients (83.5%) had partial seizures and 11 (16.4%) had generalized seizures. Four distinct groups were identified by MRI: nonspecific 16 cases (23.8%), tuberculoma 38 cases (56.7%), cysticercosis 12 cases (17.9%), and abscess 1 case (1.4%). Patients in the non-specific group had lesions that were hyperintense on T2 images and hypointense or isointense on T1 images. Such lesions resolved completely in 5 months with serial MRIs while the patients were receiving antiepileptic drugs (AEDs). Virologic studies, including cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) serology, are suggested for patients with such MRI lesions. 
Differences in hypertension prevalence among U.S. black and white women of childbearing age. Hypertension and its sequelae complicate pregnancy and can result in poor perinatal outcomes. Overall, U.S. blacks are more likely to be hypertensive than whites, but the degree to which this is true among women of childbearing age (including teenagers) is unknown. Using data from the second National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES II), the authors describe hypertension prevalence rates for 422 black and 2,700 white reproductive-age women. The authors present observed data and also predicted prevalence rates derived by modeling the odds of hypertension using logistic regression statistical techniques. They find that black-white differences in hypertension prevalence are negligible among teenagers, but they are pronounced in the older reproductive ages. They estimate that twice the proportion of black women relative to white are hypertensive during pregnancy. Their results suggest that differential rates of hypertension between black and white women may contribute to the persistent excess infant mortality among blacks, but conclusive results cannot be determined from these data. These data are also valuable for the design and evaluation of screening, intervention, and followup programs for hypertensive disease among young women. 
Early difference in the endocrine profile of long and short lactational amenorrhea. The endocrine profiles associated with long and short lactational amenorrhea were assessed in a longitudinal study in which morning blood samples were drawn in 48 women from the first postpartum month until the recovery of ovulation and in a cross-sectional study in which the samples were drawn throughout 24 h at the end of the third postpartum month in 10 fully nursing and amenorrheic women. PRL, LH, FSH, estradiol (E2), progesterone, cortisol, and dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate were measured. In both studies we detected a smaller PRL increase in response to suckling (P less than 0.001) and higher E2 levels (P less than 0.001) in nursing women who ovulated within 6 months postpartum compared to those in women who did not. Such differences were observed early after delivery when all women were fully nursing and amenorrheic. These results suggest some probable sources of variability in the duration of lactational amenorrhea in our population. The greater PRL response to suckling associated with longer amenorrhea may be due to higher sensitivity of the breast-hypothalamus-pituitary system or a stronger suckling stimulus in this group. Differences in plasma E2 levels between longer and shorter periods of amenorrhea may reflect dissimilar endogenous production, intake, or clearance of estrogens. 
Evaluating quality, cost-effective health care. Vascular database predicated on hospital discharge abstracts. This population-based study examines all carotid endarterectomies (CE) performed by all surgeons in a single state over a 10-year period. The methodology is designed to determine morbidity rate, mortality rate, cost, and length of stay, as well as to understand the effect of pre-existing chronic disease, physician, and hospital volume on these outcome variables. The data source consisted of hospital discharge abstract data uniformly collected on all admissions (N = 5.9 million) to acute care hospitals in the state. In the decade 1979 to 1988, 11,199 patients underwent CE. Mortality rate from CE was 2.1%, and the postoperative stroke rate was 3.7% over this period. High physician volume decreased the mortality rate (p less than 0.05) and stroke rate (p less than 0.01) by 50% and significantly (p less than 0.001) reduced hospital cost and length of stay independent of patient complexity. Examination of cost data, adjusted for inflation, showed a decrease in mean cost for CE over the decade. Thus physicians are providing better care for less hospital dollars. Both patient and payor outcome is improved by concentrating CE patients in the hands of high-volume surgeons. Although the data suggests this trend is already evolving, the pace of this evolution can be expected to increase as payors recognize that regionalization of this procedure lowers costs. 
Chronic periaortitis presenting as common bile duct obstruction. The case of a 67 year old woman is reported who presented with cholestatic jaundice and was found to have, in addition, an inflammatory abdominal aortic aneurysm. Only at necropsy did histopathology show chronic periaortitis as the aetiology of a pancreatic head mass which, during life, mimicked a pancreatic neoplasm obstructing the bile and pancreatic ducts. 
Artificial liver. State of the art. If an effective hepatic assist system existed, it could serve as a bridge to transplantation. Most of the patients waiting for liver transplantation have chronic liver insufficiency but are not in hepatic coma. Various hepatic assist systems have been used to salvage patients with acute liver insufficiency. Most attempts have been disappointing. The methods used have included plasma exchange, plasma adsorption, double filtration, cryofiltration, thermofiltration, the combination of plasma exchange and amino acid hemodialysis, and others. For patients with chronic liver disease with moderate liver function impairment and limited to one or only a few areas of metabolic abnormality, a hepatic assist might allow the life of the patient to be maintained temporarily. The application of hepatic assist methods for chronic liver disease patients treated at the Cleveland Clinic has been encouraging. One of the patients who suffered from sclerosing cholangitis has maintained a near-normal life for almost five years by 170 plasma treatments. This is in spite of the fact that, at the onset of treatment, the patient was nearly comatose. Unfortunately, this patient did not wish to receive a liver transplantation. Based upon this experience, the concept of a bridge to transplantation approach to hepatic assist devices appears feasible. In addition, it is speculated that hepatic assistance during the early recovery stage of liver transplantation and during mild episodes of rejection may be useful. 
Concomitant lymphangioma and arteriovenous malformation of the orbit. An 8-year-old girl had an orbital-adnexal lymphangioma and ipsilateral orbital and middle cranial fossa arteriovenous malformations. High-resolution magnetic resonance image scanning, orbital ultrasonography, and digital subtraction angiography were used for diagnosis and preoperative assessment. Complications related to this vascular neoplasm included amblyopia, acute hemorrhage with proptosis, exposure keratitis, cosmetic deformity, and recurrent preseptal cellulitis. The girl was treated with both embolization and orbital surgery for recurrent hemorrhage and proptosis. We postulated that the coexistence of a lymphangioma and arteriovenous malformation represents an unusual and extensive maldevelopment of vascular embryogenesis. 
Sarcoma in Paget disease of bone: clinical, radiologic, and pathologic features in 22 cases. The clinical, radiologic, and histologic features of 22 cases of Paget sarcoma were reviewed to determine in which patients with Paget disease these tumors are most likely to develop and what radiologic findings suggest the diagnosis. Clinical findings at presentation included pain and/or a mass (11 patients), pathologic fracture (seven), and neurologic symptoms (four). Survival time in 20 patients ranged from 5 days to 2.5 years. Two patients were lost to follow-up: one at 2 years and one at 8 years. There were 16 high-grade osteosarcomas, three chondrosarcomas, two fibrosarcomas, and one malignant fibrous histiocytoma. The most common site was the femur. Tumors also were observed in unusual sites. In one case of multifocal osteosarcoma, the tumor involved only pagetic bone. In 15 patients, Paget disease was polyostotic, clinically significant, and had been documented previously. In four patients, a sarcoma developed near the site of a fracture that had occurred between 2 months and 15 years previously. All cases showed radiologic evidence of a destructive lesion; other findings included a mass and evidence of tumor mineralization. Periosteal reaction was not observed. All but one tumor developed in a site of osteoblastic or mixed osteoblastic and lytic Paget disease. Our results suggest that sarcomas can develop in any part of any bone affected by Paget disease but are more likely to occur with advanced disease and to present with a destructive lesion without periosteal reaction. 
Determination of the c-MYC DNA-binding site. The carboxyl terminus of the protein encoded by the c-MYC protooncogene has similarity to the helix-loop-helix family of DNA-binding proteins and recognizes a six-nucleotide-long DNA sequence. We have used in vitro-translated c-MYC protein to further define its DNA-binding specificity. The hexanucleotide originally identified is necessary for DNA binding by c-MYC, but not sufficient; the c-MYC target site is a 12-nucleotide-long palindrome. This site is present within regulatory regions of genes that are expressed during cell growth. Point mutations within the helix-loop-helix motif of c-MYC abolish DNA-binding and transforming activities, indicating that c-MYC acts as a DNA-binding protein to transform cells. c-MYC may transform cells by activating transcription of genes required for cell division. 
Clinical and inflammatory responses to exogenous tachykinins in allergic rhinitis. Our purpose was to characterize the tachykinin receptor type involved in nasal obstruction to exogenous substance P in rhinitic patients. We also attempted to assess biochemical and cellular events associated with this response. Nasal challenges were performed in seven patients with allergic rhinitis. They received increasing doses (10 to 80 nmol) of substance P, of neurokinin A, of the N-terminal fragment of substance P, substance P(1-9), and of saline on 4 different days separated by 14 days. Nasal airway resistance (NAR) increased in a dose-dependent manner on substance P. Maximal increase reached 4.5-fold basal NAR. Response to neurokinin A was significantly lower (less than 2-fold basal NAR). No effect was observed on substance P(1-9) and saline. This order of activity [substance P much greater than neurokinin A greater than substance P(1-9) = saline] indicates an NK1 receptor-mediated mechanism inducing local vasodilation. No histamine release was found after any of the four challenges. Proteins significantly increased in nasal lavage fluid on both substance P and neurokinin A, whereas substance P(1-9) and saline had no effect. The percentage of albumin increased in nasal lavage fluid from 30 to 50% of total proteins on substance P and neurokinin A, indicating microvascular leakage. Polymorphonuclear cells significantly increased from 9 to 36% on substance P, from 13 to 49% on neurokinin A, and from 13 to 55% on substance P(1-9). Eosinophils increased in five patients on substance P (from 0.1 to 5% for the group), in three patients after neurokinin A, and in two after substance P(1-9). 
Laser treatment of benign cutaneous vascular lesions. Benign cutaneous vascular lesions have been treated with a wide array of modalities. Lasers are a comparatively new form of treatment for cutaneous blood vessel abnormalities. Initially, results following laser treatment were disappointing, primarily because of widespread thermal injury to surrounding normal tissue. Recent developments in laser technology and the introduction of the tunable dye laser offer the ability to selectively target laser energy at specific chromophores such as oxyhemoglobin. The technique of selective photothermolysis provides successful treatment of benign vascular lesions with minimal damage to adjacent structures. 
Excessive sweating: an uncommon sign of basilar artery occlusion. Excessive sweating of the face and, to a lesser degree, of the thorax and limbs, occurred after basilar artery occlusion in a 15 year old Saudi boy. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed a limited bilateral paramedian infarction of the rostral ventral pons. Basilar artery occlusion in children and adolescents is a rarity. Excessive sweating following such a stroke is rare in any age group. Clinico-anatomical correlations are discussed. 
Twelve-lead electrocardiographic evaluation of ischemia during percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty and its correlation with acute reocclusion. The sensitivity of the surface 12-lead electrocardiogram and that of standard (limb-lead) monitoring for the detection of ischemia during percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty were compared in 115 patients. The purpose was to identify the electrocardiographic leads that provide the most sensitive indicators of coronary ischemia during percutaneous transaluminal coronary angioplasty and to evaluate the "ischemic fingerprint" that is obtained with 12-lead electrocardiogram during balloon inflation as a predictor of abrupt reocclusion after successful percutaneous transaluminal coronary angioplasty procedures. During balloon inflations of 30 seconds, ischemia was detected in 61 of 145 vessels (42%) by limb-lead monitoring alone versus 130 of 145 vessels (90%) by 12-lead electrocardiography (p less than or equal to 0.001). In the nine patients (7.8%) who experienced abrupt reocclusion within 24 hours, the electrocardiogram during chest pain after percutaneous transaluminal coronary angioplasty was identical to that obtained during percutaneous transaluminal coronary angioplasty ("ischemic fingerprint"). None of the six patients who had chest pain after percutaneous transaluminal coronary angioplasty without evidence of abrupt reocclusion reproduced their ischemic fingerprint. The suggested optimal leads for monitoring ischemia are as follows: left anterior descending coronary artery, V2, and V3; circumflex artery, V2, and V3; and right coronary artery, III and aVF. 
Schwannoma of the brachial plexus mimicking an apical lung tumor. Primary tumors of the brachial plexus are unusual. We describe a patient with a large schwannoma of the lower trunk of the brachial plexus that had the radiologic appearance of an apical lung mass. Use of a posterior subscapular approach as well as intraoperative nerve action potential recording permitted resection with spared function. 
Analysis of septic morbidity following gunshot wounds to the colon: the missile is an adjuvant for abscess. Over a 7-year period, 151 patients with gunshot wounds to the colon surviving beyond 24 hours were managed. The bullet was retained in the body in 66% and exited in 34%. Thirty-four (23%) developed major septic complications (diffuse peritonitis, 21%; intraperitoneal abscesses 24%; and extraperitoneal abdominal abscesses, 56%). The septic complication rate was 26% in the bullet-present group compared with 16% in the remainder (p less than 0.15). The increased septic rate in those with bullets present was the result of abscesses developing around the retained missile. That group with missile abscesses had a lesser degree of injury as measured by the abdominal trauma index compared with the other patients with septic complications (p less than 0.001). Fifteen (79%) of the 19 patients with missile and missile track abscesses had them develop in the psoas muscle. These abscesses occur by fecal contamination of the muscle following inoculation by the bullet, which passes through the large bowel. Computed tomography-guided and operative drainage tend to fail if the foreign body is not removed. Computed tomography-guided or operative drainage should be successful in draining missile track abscesses when the bullet has exited the patient. 
Pediatric approach to the diagnosis and management of otitis media. The diagnosis of otitis media is complicated by confusing terminology and a disease continuum with overlap between clinical entities. The patient's history often reveals determinants of otitis media chronicity and recurrence. Certain laboratory tests, including tympanocentesis for middle ear fluid culture, may be useful in treatment decisions. Although seven antimicrobial drugs are useful in treating acute otitis media, certain drugs are more useful in specific cases. There are several medical treatment options for chronic otitis media with effusion and for preventing recurrent acute otitis media. 
Prognostic implications of the localization of carcinoma in the head of the pancreas. Between 1974 and 1989, 411 patients with pathologically and anatomically proven carcinoma of the head of the pancreas underwent endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP). According to the localization of the tumor, these patients were divided into those with a cranially, centrally (periductally), caudally, or indeterminately localized tumor. In cranially localized tumors, extrahepatic metastases and vessel invasion were absent or resectable in 53% and 46%, respectively. The tumor was resectable in 41% of cases. If a patient with a cranially localized tumor could not be operated curatively for secondary reasons, the prognosis was better than for tumors with another localization. If there was unresectable vessel invasion and the tumor was not resectable, the 0% survival rate was reached at 33 months. Of the curatively operated patients, 26% were alive at 36 months after the start of complaints. Of the centrally or periductally localized tumors, there were no liver metastases in 73%. Extrahepatic metastases and vessel invasion were absent or resectable in 57% and 53%, respectively. The tumor was resectable in 48% of cases. If there was unresectable vessel invasion or the tumor was unresectable, the 0% survival rate was reached after 18 months. These tumors have maximal chances at curative resection. Of the curatively operated patients, 31% were alive at 36 months after the start of complaints. In caudally localized tumors, there were liver metastases in 59%, unresectable other abdominal metastases in 93%, unresectable vessel invasion in 91%, and the tumor was unresectable in 96%. In patients with an unresectable vessel invasion or an unresectable tumor, the 0% survival rate was reached after 33 months; 3% of these patients were operated curatively. Indeterminately localized tumors had liver metastases in 77%, unresectable extrahepatic metastases in 90%, unresectable vessel invasion in 95%, and the tumor was unresectable in 91%. Only one of the 44 patients (2%) could be operated curatively. 
Determinants of 2-year outcome after coronary angioplasty in patients with multivessel disease on the basis of comprehensive preprocedural evaluation. Implications for patient selection. The Multivessel Angioplasty Prognosis Study Group. BACKGROUND. To assess the likelihood of intermediate-term event-free survival (freedom from death, coronary artery bypass surgery, and myocardial infarction) in patients with multivessel coronary disease undergoing coronary angioplasty, 350 consecutive patients from four clinical sites were carefully evaluated and followed for 22 +/- 10 months. METHODS AND RESULTS. Eight clinical variables were evaluated at the clinical sites, and 23 angiographic variables describing the number, morphology, and topography of coronary stenoses were evaluated at a core angiographic laboratory. Most patients had Canadian Cardiovascular Society class III or IV angina (72%), two-vessel coronary disease (68%), and well-preserved left ventricular function (mean ejection fraction, 58 +/- 12%; range, 18-85%). Follow-up was complete in 99% of patients. At 2 years, event-free survival was 72%, overall survival was 96%, freedom from bypass surgery was 82%, and freedom from nonfatal myocardial infarction without surgery was 96%. Sequential Cox proportional hazards regression analyses allowing stepwise entry of variables prospectively coded as simple, as of intermediate complexity, or as complex found event-free survival to be independently predicted by low Canadian Cardiovascular Society angina class, no diabetes, no proximal left anterior descending stenoses, and the sum of stenosis simplified risk-territory scores of 15 or less. In the absence of class IV angina and these risk factors, 2-year event-free survival was 87% and overall survival was 100%. In the presence of two or more of these risk factors, event-free survival was less than 50%. CONCLUSIONS. Recognition of risk factors for poor long-term outcome in this setting may improve clinical decision making and provide a framework on which to base meaningful subgroup analyses in randomized trials assessing the efficacy of coronary angioplasty. 
Percutaneous biopsy of left adrenal masses: prevalence of pancreatitis after anterior approach. Acute pancreatitis is an unusual but recognized complication of percutaneous aspiration biopsy of the pancreas. As the pancreatic tail is located anterior to the left adrenal gland, percutaneous biopsy of a left adrenal mass via the anterior approach may result in needle passage through the tail of the pancreas with subsequent potential development of pancreatitis. To evaluate this risk, we retrospectively reviewed 48 CT-directed percutaneous aspiration biopsies of left adrenal masses done between 1984 and 1989 at two institutions. Positioning of the patient, the course of the needle, the number of needle passes, and the size of the needle were analyzed. Thirty-three (69%) of 48 biopsies of a left adrenal mass were performed by using the anterior approach. The pancreas was traversed by one or more needles in 32 of 33 cases. Biopsies were performed with 20- to 22-gauge needles, and the number of needle passes varied widely. The medical records of the 33 patients in whom the anterior approach was used also were reviewed for complications. Acute pancreatitis, which required 11-13 days of hospitalization, developed in two patients (6%). None of the other 31 patients suffered a complication. We conclude that the pancreatic tail is routinely traversed by the biopsy needle when biopsy of a left adrenal mass is done via the anterior approach and that severe acute pancreatitis can occur as a result. 
Effects of allergy and age on responses to salbutamol and ipratropium bromide in moderate asthma and chronic bronchitis. The bronchodilating responses to 400 micrograms salbutamol and 80 micrograms ipratropium bromide were studied in 188 patients with chronic bronchitis (n = 113) or asthma (n = 75) and mild to moderate airflow obstruction (forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1) above 50% but below 2 SD of predicted value) in a crossover study on two days a week apart. Both the patients with asthma and the patients with chronic bronchitis varied considerably in their responses to the salbutamol and the ipratropium bromide. The mean increase in FEV1 in the subjects with asthma was higher after salbutamol (0.371 or 18% of the prebronchodilator value) than after ipratropium bromide (0.26 1 or 13%). In chronic bronchitis there was no difference between the increase in FEV1 after salbutamol (0.161 or 7%) and after ipratropium bromide (0.191 or 8%). When patients were categorised into those with a better response to salbutamol 400 micrograms and those with a better response to ipratropium bromide 80 micrograms, patients with chronic bronchitis responded better in general to ipratropium bromide whereas asthmatic patients responded better to salbutamol. The response pattern was also related to allergy and age, allergic patients and patients under 60 being more likely to respond better to salbutamol 400 micrograms than non-allergic patients and older patients, who benefited more from ipratropium bromide 80 micrograms. The response pattern was not related to sex, smoking habits, lung function, bronchial reactivity, respiratory symptoms, or number of exacerbations during the preceding year. 
Cinematics and sticking of heart valves in pulsatile flow test. The aim of the project was to develop laboratory test devices for studies of the cinematics and sticking behaviour of technical valve protheses. The second step includes testing technical valves of different types and sizes under static and dynamic conditions. A force-deflection balance was developed in order to load valve rims by static radial forces until sticking or loss of a disc (sticking- and clamping-mould point) with computer-controlled force deflection curves. A second deflection device was developed and used for prosthetic valves in the aortic position of a pulsatile mock circulation loop with simultaneous video-cinematography. The stiffness of technical valve rims varied between 0.20 (St. Jude) and about 1.0 N/micron (metal rim valves). The stiffness decreased significantly with increasing valve size. Sticking under pulsatile flow conditions was in good agreement with the static deflection measurements. Hence, valve sticking with increasing danger of thrombus formation is more likely with a less stiff valve rim. In the case of forces acting perpendicularly to the pendulum axis, the clamping mould-point of the valve can be reached, followed by disc dislodgement. 
Erdheim-Chester disease. Case report with autopsy findings. Erdheim-Chester disease is a rare pathologic entity characterized by symmetrical radiodensities in the metaphyseal and the diaphyseal portions of the long bones. Fibrosis, osteoblastic cortical bone deposition, and fibroxanthomatous granulomas with lipid-laden macrophages and multinucleated giant cells, which have a particular tropism for connective and adipose tissues, are the pathologic hallmarks. To our knowledge, 27 cases have been reported in the literature since the entity was first described in 1930. Protean clinical features range from a focal and asymptomatic process to a multisystemic infiltrative disease. We describe the clinical course of a new case and review the extensive pathologic findings at autopsy, including those demonstrated by light and electron microscopy and cytochemical and immunocytochemical studies. 
5-lipoxygenase inhibitory activity of zileuton. Zileuton [N-(1-benzo[b]thien-2-ylethyl)-N-hydroxyure] inhibited 5-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid synthesis by rat basophilic leukemia cell 20,000 x g supernatant and rat polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMNL) (IC50 = 0.5 and 0.3 microM) respectively. It also inhibited leukotriene (LT)B4 biosynthesis by rat PMNL (IC50 = 0.4 microM), human PMNL (IC50 = 0.4 microM) and human whole blood (IC50 = 0.9 microM). Inhibition of human PMNL LTB4 biosynthesis was removed readily by a simple wash procedure. At concentrations up to 100 microM, the compound produced little or no inhibition of several related enzymes, such as platelet 12-lipoxygenase, soybean and rabbit reticulocyte 15-lipoxygenase and sheep seminal vesicle cyclooxygenase. At p.o. doses from 0.5 to 5 mg/kg in the dog, zileuton produced a rapid and sustained inhibition of ex vivo blood LTB4 biosynthesis which correlated with the pharmacokinetic behavior of the compound. In a similar ex vivo study in the rat, the compound displayed an p.o. ED50 of 2 mg/kg. Zileuton was highly effective in preventing 6-sulfidopeptide LT formation in the rat peritoneal cavity triggered by an antigen-antibody reaction with an ED50 of 3 mg/kg. In experimental models of inflammation, zileuton significantly reduced arachidonic-acid induced mouse ear edema (ED50 = 31 mg/kg) and also attenuated inflammatory cell accumulation in the rat pleural Arthus reaction. The effectiveness of this compound for preventing LT formation in vitro, ex vivo and in vivo suggests its utility for preventing the pathophysiological effects of the LTs and other 5-lipoxygenase products in animals and in humans. 
Long-term soft-tissue effects of biliary extracorporeal shock waves: an animal study. Although delayed effects of renal extracorporeal shock-wave lithotripsy (ESWL) have been reported, the long-term soft-tissue effects after biliary ESWL have not been investigated. We report soft-tissue effects seen up to 1 year after biliary extracorporeal shock waves were administered to 18 Yucatan pigs. The gallbladder received 4000 electromagnetic shock waves from a Siemens Lithostar overhead module. Blood samples were drawn from each pig for hematologic, coagulation, and biochemical profiles immediately before and then at prescribed time intervals after administration of shock waves. Autopsy and histopathologic examination of the gallbladder and surrounding organs were performed. Kidneys and adrenal glands also were examined in five pigs followed up for 1 year. There were no gross or microscopic abnormalities in 11 animals, including all five animals in the 1-year group in which kidneys and adrenal glands also were normal. One animal (3-week group) had two 2-mm foci of parenchymal necrosis in the right lobe of the liver, probably related to ischemia after shock-wave therapy. Transient rise in liver and pancreatic enzyme levels was seen in most animals after administration of shock waves. The levels returned to normal within 2 months in all but one animal. We conclude that biliary ESWL with the Lithostar Plus does not produce long-term histologic evidence of organ damage in Yucatan pigs. 
Thyroid cancer and multiple primary malignancies in Israel. The exact risk of multiple primary neoplasms in patients with thyroid cancer is difficult to ascertain from the data available in the literature. Three thousand seventy-two patients with thyroid cancer, listed in the Israel Cancer Registry during a 16-year time span, were studied to determine the true incidence of another primary cancer. Ninety-two cases were reported as having an additional primary cancer. The prevalence of multiple primary malignancies was 3%. The frequency was higher among patients of European rather than of Asian or African origin. The second primary cancers in order of decreasing frequency were of the breast, lung, colorectum, head and neck, and lymphoma/myeloma. Most of the deaths were due to the additional cancer. The 5-year survival rate was highest for head and neck and lowest for lung cancer patients. These results emphasize the need for greater awareness of the possibility of developing additional cancers, and indicate the need to incorporate strategies for the prevention, early detection, and treatment of multiple primary neoplasms. 
Active HSV-1 immunization prevents the cocarcinogenic activity of HSV-1 in the oral cavity of hamsters. Previous investigations have demonstrated that herpes simplex virus (HSV) increased the oral carcinogenic activity of 7,12-dimethylbenz[a]anthracene (DMBA) probably by enhancing the DMBA-induced amplification and overexpression of c-erb-B-1 proto-oncogene in hamster buccal pouch epithelium. The present study investigated the effect of active type 1 HSV (HSV-1) immunization on the development of oral cancer induced by HSV-1 and DMBA, alone or in combination, in the hamster buccal pouch. The results were similar to our previous report in that HSV-1 significantly enhanced the oncogenic effect of DMBA, and the numbers of pouches harboring tumor nodules and the numbers and sizes of tumors developed by topical DMBA were significantly increased by HSV-1 inoculation to the site of the DMBA application. Although HSV-1 immunization did not alter the carcinogenic activity of DMBA in animals receiving topical DMBA in combination with mock inoculation, it prevented the cocarcinogenic effect of HSV-1 in animals receiving topical DMBA in conjunction with HSV-1 inoculation. These data indicate that active HSV-1 immunization completely obstructs the co-oncogenic effect of HSV-1 in the oral cavity of hamsters. 
Adrenal carcinoma presenting with postmenopausal vaginal bleeding. A 63-year-old woman presented with a 3-day history of vaginal bleeding. Pelvic examination and ultrasound revealed bilateral atrophy of the ovaries and a uterus of 8.8 x 3.3 x 4.0 cm. Serum estradiol (E2) was 300 pg/mL. Cushing syndrome was diagnosed biochemically, and computed tomography of the abdomen revealed a 5-cm left adrenal mass and tumors in the liver and lung. A pathologic diagnosis of metastatic adrenal carcinoma was made after surgery. This case demonstrates that adrenal carcinoma can produce high E2 levels in a postmenopausal woman, leading to uterine enlargement and vaginal bleeding. Adrenal carcinoma should therefore be included in the differential diagnosis of postmenopausal vaginal bleeding. 
Neurologically normal patients with suspected postpoliomyelitis syndrome: electromyographic assessment of past denervation. Patients with neurologic signs consistent with previous poliomyelitis have been shown to have electrodiagnostic evidence of widespread denervation, often in clinically normal muscles thought to have been uninvolved by poliomyelitis. Eight percent of patients seen in our postpoliomyelitis clinic had no abnormalities on neurologic examination or with conventional electrodiagnostic studies to corroborate history of poliomyelitis. Seventeen patients were studied, subtle electrodiagnostic evidence of denervation was sought. Measurements of fiber density and analysis of turns and amplitude showed no abnormalities in nine patients. Five patients had borderline elevated fiber density. Analysis of turns and amplitude showed mild neurogenic changes in two patients and borderline changes in three patients. These findings were disparate, with isolated abnormalities in individual muscles. It was concluded that (1) there is a group of patients whose histories of poliomyelitis are uncertain, and (2) the lack of clear evidence for previous denervation after extensive electrodiagnostic testing is a valid means for excluding the diagnosis of postpoliomyelitis syndrome. 
Complications of bladder neck suspension procedures. Typical genuine stress urinary incontinence is the result of an anatomic defect, with most procedures designed to restore the support of the proximal urethra and bladder neck. Complications associated with these procedures have been presented to help facilitate an understanding of their etiology and prevention. Careful attention to patient selection, history and physical examination, and surgical detail can prevent most of these complications. 
Pain causes in 200 patients referred to a multidisciplinary cancer pain clinic. Causes of pain were analysed in 200 patients referred to a specialized cancer pain clinic. Pain caused by tumour growth was found in 158 patients, pain secondary to cancer or its treatment in 116 patients and pain unrelated to cancer in 33 patients. Visceral involvement (74 cases), bone metastases (68 cases), soft tissue invasion (56 cases) and nerve/plexus pressure or infiltration (39 cases) were the most frequent causes of pain due to tumour growth. Myogenic pain (68 cases) was the most frequent cause of secondary pain. The patients presented with a multitude of different combinations of causes of pain, the majority having at least two separate causes. Since pain treatment in cancer patients should be determined by its aetiology, a detailed analysis of the pain condition in each patient should form the basis for a rational therapy. 
Deep venous thrombosis in the surgical intensive care unit. The ICU patient population is at a high risk for the development of deep venous thrombosis leading to a potentially fatal pulmonary embolism. It is vital to appreciate this risk and apply appropriate prophylaxis. Constant vigilance is required, as deep venous thrombosis and pulmonary emboli can develop and progress despite standard prophylactic measures. In unstable patients, more aggressive prophylaxis may be warranted, including the use of inferior vena cava filters. A high index of suspicion and a low threshold for screening and diagnostic testing will allow earlier recognition and treatment of this lifethreatening condition. Treatment decisions are based on clinical suspicion, diagnostic examination results, and the potential complications of difficult treatment modalities. 
Hypopharyngeal lipoma as a cause for sudden asphyxial death. Lipomas of the hypopharynx are uncommon tumors that are rarely life threatening. When positioned in the hypopharynx, asphyxia may be the result of the tumor size or sudden displacement into the oropharynx. We present a case of a large hypopharyngeal lipoma, review the literature, and discuss mechanisms by which these lesions may cause sudden asphyxial death. 
Aortitis caused by Mycobacterium fortuitum. Aortic valve replacement was complicated by sternal wound infection with Mycobacterium fortuitum. The wound was treated with debridement and antibiotic therapy. Five months later the patient developed fever, and blood cultures yielded M fortuitum. At surgery, aortitis with pseudo-aneurysm formation was encountered. Mycobacterium fortuitum grew from the aortic lesion. This is the first report of M fortuitum causing aortitis, although this organism is known to infect sternal wounds and mediastinum. Mediastinal infection can progress despite a normal wound appearance. Its manifestations may be delayed and may include infections of the aorta as well as of the sternum and mediastinum. 
Acute exacerbation of bronchial asthma in children associated with afternoon weather changes. We studied the effect of the weather on acute exacerbations of bronchial asthma in children by comparing records of 8,657 admissions for five acute respiratory diseases (3,064 for asthma) with concurrent meteorologic data. These diseases were classified according to their interrelations and distinct meteorologic patterns into two groups: (1) acute asthma and acute laryngitis, which are correlated with the afternoon gradients of air temperature, heat content (the thermal energy of the ambient air), and modified heat content factor (the energy required to heat the air water vapor to the ambient temperature), but not correlated with the absolute values of air temperature and water content: and (2), bronchopneumonia/pneumonia and upper respiratory infections, which are correlated only with the absolute values of the meteorologic parameters (air temperature, water content, heat content, and modified heat content factor), but not with their afternoon gradients. Admissions for bronchiolitis revealed an age-related pattern: up to 1 yr they resembled Group 2 and from 1 to 2 yr, Group 1. It follows that the admission rates of acute exacerbation of bronchial asthma in childhood are linked both to the afternoon weather gradients and to some of the acute respiratory infections. 
Magnetic resonance imaging of central nervous system lesions in patients with lupus erythematosus. Correlation with clinical remission and antineurofilament and anticardiolipin antibody titers. Clinical, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and serologic studies were performed on 11 patients with diffuse central nervous system (CNS) systemic lupus erythematosus and 8 patients with focal CNS lupus. MRI of patients with diffuse clinical disease showed symmetrically distributed areas of increased signal intensity in the subcortical white matter; these resolved after treatment with high-dose methylprednisolone. These patients' sera contained elevated levels of antineurofilament antibodies. Patients with focal CNS lupus had areas of increased signal intensity and atrophic changes in regions corresponding to the major cerebral vessels. These MRI abnormalities did not improve after treatment with high-dose steroids. The sera of patients with focal CNS lupus had elevated levels of cardiolipin and lupus anticoagulant but normal levels of antineurofilament antibody. Our findings suggest that results of a combined clinical, MRI, and serologic evaluation of patients with CNS lupus may predict the response of patients to high-dose steroid therapy. 
Endemic giardiasis and municipal water supply. To test the hypothesis that endemic giardiasis may be transmitted by unfiltered municipal water supplies, the incidence of laboratory-confirmed giardiasis was studied in a natural experiment due to the arrangement of the public water supply of Dunedin, New Zealand. The incidence rate ratio was 3.3 (90% CI = 1.1, 10.1) for the population receiving unfiltered (microstrained) water relative to that using sand filtered water. In a parallel case-control study of incident cases, the odds ratio for giardiasis and unfiltered (microstrained) water supply was 1.8 (90% CI = 0.5, 6.9). 
Changes of zero-stress state of rat pulmonary arteries in hypoxic hypertension. Zero-stress state of the main pulmonary arteries, from the main trunk to a vessel with a lumen diameter approximately 60 microns, was determined in 25 normal control and 38 hypoxic pulmonary hypertensive rats. Pulmonary hypertension was induced by placing the rats in a hypoxic chamber with 10% O2-90% N2 at atmospheric pressure. The zero-stress state of each vessel was obtained by first cutting the vessel transversely into a series of rings and then cutting each ring radially, whereupon the ring opened into a sector, which is characterized by an opening angle defined as the angle subtended between two lines originating from the midpoint of the inner wall (endothelium) to the tips of the inner wall. Whereas the pulmonary blood pressure increased monotonically during the development of pulmonary hypertension, the opening angle followed a different course; e.g., the values (means +/- SD) of the opening angle at the pulmonary trunk at times 0 (control) and 2, 12, 28, 96, 144, 240, 480, and 720 h after exposure to hypoxia are, respectively, 294 +/- 30 degrees, 378 +/- 24 degrees, 385 +/- 12 degrees, 374 +/- 11 degrees, 246 +/- 63 degrees, 267 +/- 49 degrees, 193 +/- 19 degrees, 195 +/- 83 degrees, and 239 +/- 38 degrees. Trends at other places on the artery are similar, but the magnitudes differ. In this period of time, intimal edema and thickening were found. The intima media thickened rapidly from 48 to 240 h and then more slowly from 240 to 720 h. Adventitia thickened later; its thickness exceeded that of the intima media at approximately 96 h. Thus the changes of zero-stress state of the pulmonary arteries are seen to be related to the nonuniform remodeling of the vessel wall as revealed by the edema, blebs, and thickening of different layers. 
Metal wear and tissue response in failed titanium alloy total hip replacements. Thirteen total hip replacements with titanium alloy femoral components required revision for loosening at an average of two years after implantation. At revision the soft tissues around the implant were darkly stained and a proliferative membrane had invaded the cement-bone interface. The femoral components showed polishing of parts of their shot-blasted surfaces. Histology showed a fibroblastic reaction with abundant titanium lying free and within histiocytes, and a scanty foreign-body giant-cell reaction. Surface analysis of the removed femoral components and chemical analysis of the excised tissues is described. Tissue reaction in response to the metal-wear debris may have contributed to the early failure of these implants. 
Measurement of tumour protein synthesis in vivo in human colorectal and breast cancer and its variability in separate biopsies from the same tumour. 1. A method is described for measuring the rates of protein synthesis in vivo in human colorectal and breast tumours by the intravenous injection of L-[1-13C]leucine as a 'flooding dose'. 2. The incorporation of isotope into colorectal tumour protein was measured in six patients, whose tumours were biopsied after the injection. Fractional rates of protein synthesis were calculated from the enrichment of leucine in protein and the average free leucine enrichment in plasma. The range of rates obtained was 17.2-33.9%/day, with a mean rate (+/- SEM) of 22.5 +/- 2.6%/day. 3. Tumour protein synthesis rates were also measured in 15 patients with breast cancer. The range of rates obtained was 5.3-15.9%/day, with a mean rate (+/- SEM) of 10.3 +/- 0.8%/day. These rates are significantly lower than those obtained with colorectal tumours (P less than 0.001). 4. In 9 of the breast cancer patients, protein synthesis was measured in multiple random biopsies taken from the same tumour. The mean (+/- SEM) difference between the highest and lowest rates in biopsies from the same tumour was only 1.1 +/- 0.3%/day. Only 13% of the variation in protein synthesis between separate tumours could be explained by sampling error because of variation within the tumour itself, the remainder being genuine variation between individual tumours. 
Germ-line deletions of mtDNA in mitochondrial myopathy. mtDNA encodes subunits of the electron transport chain and is exclusively maternally inherited in mammals. It has been suggested that mtDNA might be the site of some of the mutations causing a group of human disorders called the "mitochondrial myopathies," because these may both be (1) accompanied by defects in the electron transport chain and (2) display a maternal pattern of inheritance. However, all of the deletions and duplications of mtDNA which occur in these patients have been sporadic, apart from families in whom affected members all carry different deletions suggesting a mutant autosomal dominantly inherited nuclear gene with de novo deletions in each individual. We present the first evidence for the presence of deleted mtDNAs in the germ line in these disorders. The patient carries a higher level of deleted mtDNAs than do his relatives, corresponding to severity of symptoms and consistent with a predicted dosage effect. "Selfishness" of deleted mtDNAs is probably one of the factors over and above random segregation of a small number of "founder" mtDNAs (the bottleneck hypothesis) which may be invoked to explain the usual distribution of mtDNAs in different tissues of patients with mtDNA deletions. 
Actuarial analysis of the occurrence of remissions following thymectomy for myasthenia gravis in 400 patients. The role of thymectomy in the treatment of myasthenia gravis (MG) was analysed in 400 patients affected with generalised MG operated on between 1974-83, and prospectively followed up for five years after surgery. The occurrence of stable remission (SR) (that is, complete clinical drug-free remission that remains stable for all the subsequent follow up) was the endpoint of survival analyses and the distribution of SR time (SRT, that is, the interval from thymectomy to the occurrence of SR) was assessed by actuarial and Cox multivariate analyses. SRT distribution after surgery showed a slow progressive increase of cumulative SR rate that could both be ascribed to a delayed effect of thymectomy as well as reflect the natural history of MG, itself characterised by an increasing probability of spontaneous remission with time. SRT distribution was similar after stratification for all variables studied except when patients without thymoma were stratified for the need for immunosuppressive treatment in addition to thymectomy. Patients without thymoma who did not require additional immunosuppressive therapy (n = 130) had the highest SR rate occurring in the two years after thymectomy, and differed from patients treated with immunosuppressive drugs who showed the highest SR rate five years after surgery. Actuarial analysis has therefore identified a subgroup of patients where SR, occurring in the first years after surgery, is more likely to be ascribed to thymectomy than merely reflect the natural course of the disease. 
Impact of blood pressure and antihypertensive treatment on incipient and overt nephropathy, retinopathy, and endothelial permeability in diabetes mellitus. Diabetic nephropathy is the main cause of the increased morbidity and mortality in insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM) patients. Elevated blood pressure accelerates and effective blood pressure reduction with beta-blockers and/or angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors delays the progression of nephropathy and reduces albuminuria. All previous reports dealing with the natural history of diabetic nephropathy demonstrated a cumulative death rate between 50 and 77% 10 yr after onset of nephropathy. Effective antihypertensive treatment reduced the cumulative death rate to 15-20% 10 yr after onset of nephropathy. Recent randomized control studies indicate that ACE inhibition may delay and even prevent the development of diabetic nephropathy in normotensive IDDM patients with persistent microalbuminuria. Several cross-sectional and prospective studies suggest an association between elevated blood pressure and the development and progression of diabetic retinopathy. Furthermore, carotid insufficiency or other causes of unilaterally or bilaterally reduced retinal blood flow (pressure) diminish the development of diabetic retinopathy. Diabetic retinopathy is characterized by abnormal leakage of fluorescein through the blood-retinal barrier, an abnormality that can be reversed during antihypertensive treatment. It is well documented that elevated blood pressure, poor metabolic control, and diabetic microangiopathy independently enhance the endothelial leakage of plasma proteins in diabetes mellitus. A link between capillary hypertension, increased extravasation of plasma proteins, and the development and progression of diabetic microangiopathy has been suggested. Blood pressure reduction diminishes the extravasation of plasma proteins. The above results strongly support the case for early and effective treatment of arterial blood pressure elevation in diabetes. 
Successful radioimmunotherapy for lung metastasis of human colonic cancer in nude mice. The potential for radioimmunotherapy as an adjuvant treatment for early disseminated colonic cancer was investigated in an experimental lung metastasis model. Nude mice receiving intravenous injection with a suspension of human colonic cancer cells (GW-39) developed multiple (10-100) tumor nodules throughout the lungs, and more than 50% of the animals died of extensive tumor involvement within 5-10 weeks. Groups of eight or nine animals bearing 7-day-old tumor transplants were treated with a single intravenous injection of radioiodinated agents: either 0.15 or 0.30 mCi of whole IgG of the NP-4 murine monoclonal antibody (MAb) against carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) or 0.15 or 0.30 mCi of whole IgG of Immu-31, an anti-alpha-fetoprotein (anti-AFP) MAb. Treatment of animals with 0.15 or 0.30 mCi of 131I-labeled NP-4 IgG 7 days after injection of tumor cells resulted in survival for 23 weeks after tumor implantation in four of eight and seven of nine animals, respectively. Microscopic examination revealed that over 90% of the lung tumor colonies had no evidence of surviving cells. Animals treated with 0.30 mCi of anti-AFP, an irrelevant MAb, survived 4 weeks longer than controls. Toxicity was evident in four of the 17 animals given 0.30 mCi of NP-4 IgG (specific) or anti-AFP IgG (irrelevant) MAb. These animals died within 1-3 weeks after radioantibody injection, suggesting that death was related to the radiation dose. None of the animals given 0.15 mCi of 131I-MAb died within this period. 
Differential pathophysiology of bacterial translocation after thermal injury and sepsis. Bacterial translocation (BT) occurs transiently after thermal injury and may result from an ischemic intestinal insult. To evaluate continued intestinal ischemia in the ongoing BT associated with sepsis after injury, rats were randomized to (1) 30% burn injury with Pseudomonas wound infection (BI), (2) BI + fluid resuscitation (BI + Fluid), (3) BI after allopurinol pretreatment to inhibit xanthine oxidase (BI + Allo), or (4) BI after azapropazone pretreatment to inhibit neutrophil degranulation (BI + Aza). On postburn days (PBD) 1, 4, and 7, animals were studied for evidence of BT and intestinal lipid peroxidation. BI + Fluid, BI + Allo, and BI + Aza significantly (p less than 0.05) reduced rates of BT and ileal lipid peroxidation acutely after thermal injury (PBD 1) compared to BI. All four groups had equally high rates of BT associated with the onset of sepsis (PBDs 4 and 7), without evidence of further intestinal lipid peroxidation. These data indicate that the chronic gut barrier failure associated with sepsis after injury occurs independently of continued intestinal ischemia. 
Intestinal ischemia associated with cardio-pulmonary-bypass surgery: a life threatening complication. Intestinal ischemia following open heart surgery is rare but nevertheless extremely dangerous and the causes are still unclear. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the factors influencing the occurrence and outcome of patients with this complication. At our institution between 1985 and 1989 1712 patients underwent open heart surgery and 4 female patients suffered from intestinal ischemia. The early mortality was 2.5% for the whole group and 100% for the group with intestinal ischemia. All these 4 patients were elderly and had a history of hypertension and hyperlipoproteinemia. Three of the four patients with intestinal ischemia had various risk factors for thromboembolic events such as pre-existing occlusive arterial disease and cardiac dysrhythmias or had a complicated postoperative course. In two patients an enormous increase in serum lactate to over 10 mmol/l occurred prior to the intestinal ischemia. We therefore consider advancing age, female gender and a susceptibility for thromboembolic events as important risk factors for the development of intestinal ischemia. A serum lactate over 10 mmol/l should lead to an aggressive diagnostic and therapeutic approach including exploratory laparotomy. 
Non-invasive assessment of perioperative myocardial cell damage by circulating cardiac troponin T. Troponin T is a unique cardiac antigen which is continuously released from infarcting myocardium. Its cardiospecificity as a marker protein might be particularly useful in assessing myocardial cell damage in patients undergoing cardiac surgery. Therefore, circulating troponin T was measured in serial blood samples from 56 patients undergoing cardiac surgery and in two control groups--22 patients undergoing minor orthopaedic surgery and 12 patients undergoing lung surgery by median sternotomy. In both control groups no troponin T could be detected, whereas activities of creatine kinase were raised in all 12 lung surgery controls and activities of the MB isoenzyme were raised in five of the 12 patients in the lung surgery group and in four of the 22 patients in the orthopaedic surgery group, respectively. All the patients undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting (n = 47) and cardiac surgery for other reasons (n = 9) had detectable concentrations of troponin T. Five patients had perioperative myocardial infarction detected as new Q waves and R wave reductions. In these five patients troponin T release persisted and serum concentrations (5.5-23 micrograms/l) reached a peak on the fourth postoperative day. In the 51 patients without perioperative myocardial infarction serum concentrations and the release kinetics of troponin T depended on the duration of cardiac arrest. In patients in whom aortic cross clamping was short troponin T increased slightly on the first postoperative days; in patients with longer periods of aortic cross clamping troponin T concentrations were higher and remained so beyond the fifth postoperative day. 
Development of sustained achlorhydria in a patient with the Zollinger-Ellison syndrome treated with omeprazole. Spontaneous remission of gastric acid hypersecretion in the Zollinger-Ellison syndrome occurs rarely. This study shows the development of gastric secretory mucosal atrophy resulting in achlorhydria and loss of pepsin secretion in a 63-year-old woman with the Zollinger-Ellison syndrome. Reduced secretion began soon after starting treatment with omeprazole, and achlorhydria became complete 6 months later. The patient remains well with normal endoscopy results and is achlorhydric 4 years after the start of treatment and 34 months after stopping omeprazole. She was not colonized with Helicobacter pylori until 36 months after developing achlorhydria. Serum gastrin has increased from 1000 to between 5000 and 12,500 ng/L (pg/mL), was not suppressible by gastric acidification, and was not associated with G-cell hyperplasia. She also has a normal Schilling test and normal immunoglobulins, and lacks antibodies to parietal cells or H+, K(+)-ATPase. Moderate enterochromaffinlike cell hyperplasia is apparent for the first time on the latest biopsy sample. 
Tumor-infiltrating CD3- NK cells are more effective than CD3+ T cells in killing autologous melanoma cells. We have studied the phenotype and functional activity of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TIL) derived from eight human melanomas cultured for up to 60 d in the presence of recombinant IL-2. In the early period of the cultures, TIL were predominantly T cells of CD8+ phenotype and contained 10-30% of CD3- cells. Four of the five early TIL cultures tested in a cytotoxicity assay displayed a degree of MHC-unrestricted lysis on a series of autologous and allogenic melanoma cell lines as well as the K562 natural killer-sensitive target. With longer periods of time in culture, all TIL lines showed a decrease in lytic activity that was associated with the loss of CD3- cells. Thus, most of the killing of short-term TIL cultures appeared to be mediated by CD3- natural killer cells, whereas CD3+ T cells were found to be weak anti-tumor effectors. Even though the CD3+ T cells were not cytotoxic on K562 targets, their lytic activity (even weak) against melanoma cells appeared to be non-MHC restricted, and was blocked by anti-CD3 antibodies. In addition, cytotoxicity of the CD3+ TIL cultures was compared to that of a CD3-/NKH1+ cell line purified from peripheral blood. It was found that natural killer cells were much more potent than CD3+ TIL on the melanoma cell lines tested. 
Mycotic aortic aneurysm infected by Clostridium septicum--a case history. The authors describe a sixty-seven-year-old hypertensive, diabetic man with a mycotic abdominal aortic aneurysm infected with Clostridium septicum. The patient had colonic polyps but no malignant disease. They could find only one other report of a mycotic aneurysm infected with C. septicum. In that case, as in most other cases of C. septicum bacteremia, the patient had gastrointestinal cancer. Their case suggests that treatment for a clostridial infection should be considered in patients with known gastrointestinal disease, signs and symptoms of sepsis, and abdominal pain. Conversely, patients known to have a C. septicum infection should be evaluated for gastrointestinal lesions. 
Oncogene expression in the liver tissue of patients with nonneoplastic liver disease. The expression of cellular oncogenes in nonneoplastic human liver tissue was examined to determine if there was a correlation between oncogene expression and physiologic regeneration in liver disease. Human liver tissue specimens from 70 patients with various histologic findings from almost normal to cirrhosis were examined (using northern blot analysis) for the expression of nine cellular oncogenes. With c-K-ras, four RNA bands (5.6-kilobase [kb], 2.1-kb, 1.5-kb, and 1.2-kb RNA species) were detected in all liver tissue examined. Expression of c-fos was also detected in a few samples examined when 50-micrograms samples of total RNA were applied. Other oncogenes such as H-ras, myc, erbB, raf, fms, fes, and myb were not detected. These results indicate that particular oncogene(s) may not be highly expressed during liver regeneration in human liver disease, or that populations of regenerating hepatocytes may be too small to show significant elevations of oncogene expression. The new finding of a constant expression of c-K-ras in human liver tissue suggests that it is linked to essential hepatocellular function rather than carcinogenesis. 
Ischemic colitis associated with dextroamphetamine use. Ischemic colitis can be caused by a variety of medications including a number of sympathomimetic agents. We report the case of a 47-year-old narcoleptic man who had abdominal pain and rectal bleeding. The clinical, radiographic, and histologic findings supported the diagnosis of ischemic colitis associated with oral dextroamphetamine use. 
Inflammatory complications following penetrating cardiac trauma. Two cases with pericardial and myocardial inflammatory complications following penetrating cardiac trauma are presented. A high index of suspicion with liberal usage of echocardiography, serial electrocardiograms, and careful patient follow-up will preclude this diagnostic oversight. 
Extramedullary blast crisis in chronic myelogenous leukemia. Demonstration of T-cell lineage and Philadelphia chromosome in a paraspinal tumor. A case of chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) with penetrance of the Ph1 molecular alteration into the T-cell lineage of a paraspinal tumor is reported. The T-cell nature of the paraspinal tumor was documented by immunochemical study and genotyping. The Philadelphia chromosome was also detected by genotyping in the same tumor cell population. To the authors' knowledge, this is the first case of extramedullary T-cell blast crisis in CML demonstrated in an extranodal tumor. The clinical significance of detecting extramedullary blast crisis, and the theories for the scarcity of T-cell transformation in CML are discussed. 
Heterotopic bone formation in thermal burns. Heterotopic bone is a rare complication of burns. The factors to be considered in its development are the percentage of burn, the location of burn, the length of bed confinement, osteoporosis, superimposed trauma, and genetic predisposition. Characteristically, heterotopic bone develops between one and three months after the acute burn. It may continue to proliferate as long as there are open wounds but it tends to regress once the burn wound has healed. If it has bridged a joint it may be surgically excised after the burn has healed. The more extensive the heterotopic bone the poorer the prognosis for restoration of motion after excision. Prevention of heterotopic bone appears to be linked in part to early mobilization of the patient and recovery from the postburn hypermetabolic and catabolic state. 
Economic considerations that influence health policy and research. Cardiovascular conditions account for more medical costs than any other diagnostic category in the United States. Increasingly, economic constraints will shape policy related to health care and research. Hypertension is the most common cardiovascular condition, and despite low unit health care costs, the aggregate costs are considerable. However, the unit and aggregate costs of the complications of hypertension are fourfold greater and, in this economic perspective, aggressive approaches are warranted to prevent complications. Treatment and research strategies should be identified that could have considerable potential economic impact. Several strategies are suggested as a prospective guide to policy development. Economic considerations will be important and should be incorporated in the planning of hypertension care and research. 
Peptic ulcer disease: absence of antibodies stimulating the histamine sensitive adenylate cyclase of gastric mucosal cells. The possible presence of parietal cell stimulating antibodies was examined in sera from 57 patients with relapsing ulcer disease. The sera were obtained at the time of symptomatic relapse and all patients had ulcers confirmed by endoscopy. A sensitive assay based on adenosine 3':5' cyclic monophosphate (cAMP) production in isolated porcine gastric mucosal cells was used as a measure. cAMP production increased up to four hours of incubation and was histamine responsive; an approximately 20-fold increase was found with histamine 10(-4) mol/l. Sera from both patients and healthy control subjects showed some inhibitory effect on basal cAMP production compared with incubation in medium only, whereas immunoglobulin preparations had a weaker non-specific effect. No stimulation was found when the patients' sera and immunoglobulins (up to a concentration of 6 mg/ml) were examined. These results suggest that gastric acid hypersecretion in duodenal ulcer disease is not an effect of histamine receptor stimulating antibodies. The data thus argue against a recent hypothesis that severe chronic ulcer disease in some patients has an autoimmune origin. 
Use of life-sustaining care for the elderly. Advanced age has been proposed as one criterion for limiting the use of life-sustaining medical treatment, but very little is known about current practices. We retrospectively studied utilization rates of intensive care (IC) and cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) in admissions to a university hospital over 1 year (n = 9,998), to test whether these treatments are used more selectively for elderly patients. Overall utilization rates did not vary by age. However, among 524 terminal admissions, IC was used for 63% of patients age 35-74 but for only 50% of patients 75 and older (P less than 0.01). Among elderly patients, nursing home residence, diagnosis of advanced malignancy, severe chronic illness, and older age were independent predictors of withholding IC prior to death. Despite more selective use, survival rates were lower for elderly than for younger patients receiving IC (88% vs 78%, P less than 0.001). CPR showed similar but non-significant trends. Intensive care is being used less frequently prior to death for elderly patients, based on diagnosis and functional status as well as chronologic age. 
IgA nephropathy in non-cirrhotic portal hypertension. Renal glomerular changes are a well recognised complication of cirrhosis and are frequently characterised by mesangial IgA deposition. We report a patient with non-cirrhotic portal hypertension who developed IgA nephropathy and a nephrotic syndrome with renal histological changes classically associated with cirrhosis. Splenectomy with resection of a splenic artery aneurysm resulted in remission of the nephrotic syndrome. This case illustrates the factors which contribute to the pathogenesis of IgA nephropathy in liver disease. 
A new coaxial needle for pre-operative localization of breast abnormalities. A new coaxial needle, containing a retractable anchoring wire with a helical tip, has been developed for purposes of mammographic and sonographic localization of non-palpable suspicious breast abnormalities before surgical excision. The helically shaped tip provides the needle with a number of potential advantages over other currently available localization needles. During in vitro comparisons with other needles quantitative and qualitative evidence was obtained to suggest that the new needle can be expected to have improved anchoring capability, be deflected less by tough fibrous tissue interfaces and be more visible sonographically. The anchoring wire can also be retracted and repositioned. Preliminary clinical experience with the needle was consistent with these expectations. 
Effects of acidic fibroblast growth factor on normal and ischemic myocardium. We sought to determine the effects of acidic fibroblast growth factor (FGF) on ischemic and normal myocardium and to determine whether direct application of acidic FGF to the heart could promote angiogenesis. Eighteen dogs underwent placement of an ameroid constrictor on the left anterior descending coronary artery (LAD). Three weeks later, a left internal mammary artery (IMA) pedicle was positioned over the LAD territory, with a sponge saturated with acidic FGF (n = 12) or saline (n = 4) interposed between the pedicle and the heart. Polytetrafluoroethylene fiber or collagen I sponges were used to deliver the acidic FGF. Weekly angiography of the IMA was performed in all dogs, but significant IMA to coronary collaterals were not demonstrable in any dog. Eight dogs had histological evidence of subendocardial infarction in the LAD territory (five acidic FGF, three control, p = NS). Striking smooth muscle cell hyperplasia was present in arterioles and small arteries exclusively in areas of subendocardial infarction in all of the acidic FGF-treated dogs but in none of the control dogs (p less than 0.05). Noninfarcted myocardium appeared normal in all dogs. In two additional dogs, ameroid constrictors were not placed on the LAD, such that acidic FGF-treated sponges were placed on normally perfused myocardium of the LAD territory. Histological evaluation of those hearts revealed normal myocardium, without evidence of myocardial infarction or smooth muscle cell hyperplasia. Thus, when acidic FGF is delivered to the myocardium via an epicardial sponge in dogs whose coronary flow is compromised, acidic FGF does not cause an angiogenic response in viable myocardium but causes vascular smooth muscle cell hyperplasia in areas subjected to ischemic injury. 
Sleep apnea in infants who succumb to the sudden infant death syndrome. Previous studies have shown the frequency of respiratory pauses to be altered in groups of infants at risk for the sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS). In this study, we assess the frequency of apneic pauses during quiet sleep and rapid eye movement sleep in control infants and infants who subsequently died of SIDS. Sleep states were identified in 12-hour physiological recordings of SIDS victims and matched control infants, and the number of respiratory pauses from 4 to 30 seconds in duration was computed for quiet sleep and rapid eye movement sleep. SIDS victims 40 to 65 days of age showed significantly fewer apneic pauses than did age-matched control infants across the two sleep states. Fewer short respiratory pauses accounted for most of the reduction in number of apneic events in the SIDS victims during both sleep states. During the first month of life, SIDS victims did not differ significantly from control neonates on this measure. The finding that this respiratory difference exists during the second month of life, just before the period of maximal risk for SIDS, but not earlier, may have implications for the etiology of SIDS deaths. 
Multidrug resistance (mdr1) gene expression in adult acute leukemias: correlations with treatment outcome and in vitro drug sensitivity. Resistance to multiple chemotherapeutic agents has been related to the production of P-glycoprotein, a trans-membrane drug efflux pump that is encoded by the multidrug resistance (MDR) gene mdr1. To investigate whether mdr1 could be involved in clinical resistance to chemotherapy in acute leukemias, we have analyzed retrospectively the RNA from adult acute leukemia cells by slot-blot hybridization with a human mdr1 probe. Units of mdr1 expression were defined by reference to drug-sensitive human sarcoma and K562 leukemia cell lines (1 U) and the highly resistant doxorubicin selected leukemia cells K562/R7 (50 U). We studied 41 adult patients with acute leukemias: 5 acute lymphoblastic leukemias, 23 acute myeloid leukemias, and 13 secondary leukemias or blast crisis of chronic myelogenous leukemia. Expression of 10 U or more of mdr1 was found in 6 of 31 (19%) leukemias at diagnosis, versus 5 of 10 (50%) after relapse from therapy, P = .06. The complete remission rate and in vitro sensitivity to daunorubicin were both correlated with low expression (1 U, v 2 U or more) of mdr1. Among 36 evaluable attempts to induce remission, the complete remission rate was 67% (8 of 12) for patients with undetectable or minimal mdr1 expression (1 U), versus 29% (7 of 24) in patients with 2 U or more of expression, P = .03. In vitro resistance to daunorubicin or other MDR-related drugs was associated with expression of 2 U or more of mdr1 in 11 of 11 cases, while specimens that were sensitive to these agents were negative for mdr1 expression in 5 of 11 cases, P = .03. These data suggest that mdr1 expression contributes to chemoresistance in acute leukemia. Determination of mdr1 gene expression may be useful in designing therapy for patients with leukemia. 
The effect of trisomy 18 on transverse cerebellar diameter. The transverse cerebellar diameter was measured in 19 fetuses with trisomy 18. Eleven of the cerebellar measurements (57.9%) were greater than 2 SD below the mean for the patient's gestational age. If fetal biometry rather than last menstrual period were used to determine gestational age, four of the 19 (21.0%) cerebellar measurements were greater than 2 SD below the mean. Both intrauterine growth retardation and intrinsic central nervous system abnormalities associated with trisomy 18 appeared to affect cerebellar size. 
Endometriosis of the terminal ileum simulating the clinical, roentgenographic, and surgical findings in Crohn's disease. A 38-yr-old nulliparous female presented with endometriosis of the terminal ileum which mimicked the clinical, roentgenographic, and surgical findings of Crohn's disease. The patient presented with diarrhea, right lower quadrant pain, fever, and significant weight loss. At surgery, the terminal ileum was inflamed, indurated, thickened, and angulated. Ileal endometriosis may be expected to simulate Crohn's disease, because intestinal endometriosis frequently produces local bowel inflammation, adhesions, stricture, and angulation. Ileal endometriosis should be carefully considered in the differential diagnosis of Crohn's disease in menstruating females who are nulliparous and have dysmenorrhea, dyspareunia, dyschezia, menometrorrhagia, or other perimenstrual symptoms. It is important not to mistake endometriosis for Crohn's disease because endometriosis has a different therapy. 
Relationship of regional fat distribution and obesity to electrocardiographic parameters in healthy premenopausal women. Abdominal obesity is an independent cardiovascular risk factor. The coexistence of abdominal obesity and electrocardiographic abnormalities may facilitate the development of cardiac arrhythmias and sudden death. We determined the relationship of body fat distribution and obesity to ECG indices in 27 obese premenopausal women on an isocaloric diet. Intra-abdominal fat distribution was assessed by computerized tomography, and obesity was assessed by hydrostatic weighing. The PR, QRS, and QTc intervals, the P and QRS axes, and the P-QRS angle were determined from a resting electrocardiogram. Cardiovascular risk profile was assessed by systolic and diastolic blood pressure and plasma cholesterol and triglyceride levels. Increased deposition of intra-abdominal fat was significantly associated with prolongation of the QTc interval independent of obesity and other cardiovascular risk factors. The prolongation of the QTc interval seen with increasing intra-abdominal fat distribution may enhance susceptibility to cardiac arrhythmias. These subjects should have electrocardiographic monitoring during periods of weight loss achieved by intensive regimens. 
Intrapericardial OK-432 instillation for the management of malignant pericardial effusion. Ten patients with malignant pericardial effusion were treated with intrapericardial injection of OK-432 (penicillin-treated and heat-treated lyophilized powder of the substrain of Streptococcus pyogenes A3). After intrapericardial insertion of a catheter, a maximal volume of pericardial fluid was withdrawn with cytologic confirmation of malignancy. Five or 10 Klinische Einheit (KE) (KE is a unit used to express the strength of a preparation) of OK-432 diluted in 20 ml of saline was injected into the pericardial space in seven and three patients, respectively. It was repeated in case of reaccumulation. Seven patients were treated only once and the remaining three required a second treatment. Complete control of pericardial effusion was achieved in all patients for an average of 329 days (range, 54 to 790 days). Fever and chest pain were experienced in six and five patients, respectively, but were controlled with antipyretics. Two of three patients who received 10 KE of OK-432 experienced hypotension that was successfully controlled with vasopressor drugs with or without reaspiration of pericardial fluid. Rapid reactive reaccumulation of the pericardial fluid was thought to be a cause of hypotension. A follow-up computed tomography (CT) scan was performed in seven patients and a thickened pericardium was noticed in five; no patients had constrictive pericarditis. These results suggest that intrapericardial administration of 5 KE of OK-432 is an effective and safe treatment for malignant pericardial effusion. 
Increased risk of myelodysplasia and leukaemia after etoposide, cisplatin, and bleomycin for germ-cell tumours. Among the cytostatic drugs only the alkylating agents have been firmly established as being leukaemogenic. This report describes 4 cases of acute myeloid leukaemia and 1 of myelodysplasia occurring in a cohort of 212 patients with germ-cell tumours treated with etoposide, cisplatin, and bleomycin. The mean cumulative risk of leukaemic complications was 4.7% (SE 2.3) 5.7 years after start of etoposide-containing chemotherapy, and, compared with the risk in the general population, the relative risk of overt leukaemia was 336 (95% CI 92-861). No leukaemias were detected in a previous cohort of 127 patients with germ-cell tumours treated with cisplatin, bleomycin, and vinblastine. The increased risk of leukaemia was most probably due to etoposide alone or in combination with cisplatin or bleomycin, since other published work has also not revealed an excess of leukaemias among patients with germ-cell tumours treated with only cisplatin, bleomycin, and vinblastine. The risk of leukaemia was dose related since all 5 patients with leukaemic complications were among the 82 who had received a cumulative dose of more than 2000 mg/m2 etoposide, whereas no leukaemias were observed among 130 patients who had received up to 2000 mg/m2 (p = 0.004). 3 of the leukaemic patients had balanced chromosome translocations affecting bands 11q23 and 21q22. These translocations, and perhaps also other balanced aberrations, seem to be characteristic of myelodysplasia and acute leukaemia occurring after therapy with cytostatic agents acting on DNA-topoisomerase II. 
Gamma imaging with negatively charge-modified monoclonal antibody: modification with synthetic polymers Antimyosin Fab has been modified to carry highly negatively charged synthetic polymers containing DTPAs (DTPA-PL) as chelating agents, of starting molecular weights 3.3 and 17 kD. The immunoreactivities of the modified antibodies were unaffected by the modification procedure. The isoelectric points (PI) of unmodified antimyosin (AM) Fab (PI range 7-9, Mr = 52kD) were changed to PIs predominantly between 4 and 5 (Mr = 59 kD for DTPA-PL3.3kD-AM-Fab and 67kD for DTPA-PL17kD-AM-Fab). These AM-Fab preparations were tested for specific target localization and visualization in vivo in an experimental canine model of acute myocardial infarction. The charge-modified 111In-labeled AM-Fab preparations showed enhanced target (necrotic myocardium) visualization within 30 min of intravenous infusion and decreased background activity in normal myocardium (mean %ID/g +/- s.e.m., 0.0076 +/- 0.0006, n = 164, and 0.0056 +/- 0.0004, n = 92, for 111In-DTPA-PL3.3kD- and DTPA-PL17kD-AM-Fab respectively) relative to conventional 111In-DTPA-AM-Fab (0.0263 +/- 0.0037, n = 135) (p less than 0.001) or radioiodinated AM-Fab (0.0098 +/- 0.0006, n = 256) (p less than or equal to 0.001). Furthermore, the concentration of negatively charged 111In-labeled antimyosin Fab decreased in non-target organs such as the liver and kidneys. In diagnostic and therapeutic applications, charge-modified macromolecules may improve target localization and reduce non-target organ activity. 
Abnormal pattern of luteinizing hormone pulsatility in women with epilepsy. Dysfunction of the hypothalamic-pituitary-ovarian axis in epileptic females has been suggested in the latest years. To further elucidate this issue, we assessed reproductive endocrine function in 10 normally cycling, drug-free epileptic women and in 5 normal controls, evaluating the basal hormonal profile and luteinizing hormone (LH) pulsatility in the midfollicular phase. Luteinizing hormone pulse frequency was significantly higher in epileptic women with a consequent reduction of the LH interpulse interval. We suggest that epilepsy may interfere with the functional activity of the gonadotropin-releasing hormone pulse generator. The pathogenetic mechanisms for this phenomenon may be the spreading of paroxysmal activity within the hypothalamic areas or, alternatively, a neurotransmitter dysfunction giving rise both to the seizure disorder and to the abnormal LH pulsatile pattern. 
Oral contraceptives and reproductive system cancer. Benefits and risks. Large epidemiologic studies conducted to date in the United States and abroad have not demonstrated any statistically significant increase in the overall incidence of breast cancer among women who used oral contraceptives (OCs). The cumulative risk of breast cancer among women less than 60 years of age is clearly not related to OC use, although the incidence of breast cancer in certain subgroups of premenopausal women who used OCs may be increased and warrants monitoring. Evidence of a latency period in the development of breast cancer among OC users is not convincing. Studies to date have indicated that the risk of invasive cervical cancer appears to be unaffected by OC use. The data on cervical intraepithelial neoplasia are inconclusive and fraught with confounding variables. There is unequivocal evidence that OC use reduces the incidence of other reproductive system cancers, notably ovarian and endometrial. 
Seizures caused by nontraumatic parenchymal brain hemorrhages. Seizures occurred in 15% of patients with parenchymal brain hemorrhage (early in 12% and delayed in 3%). Seizures were most frequent with lobar hemorrhages and uncommon with deep subcortical hemorrhages. Lobar hemorrhages in the frontal, parietal, or temporal region were more commonly associated with seizures, whereas occipital hemorrhages were not. Seizures were most common if the hemorrhage was due to an aneurysm, angioma, or neoplasm and less common if hypertensive or spontaneous. If the patient had recurrent seizures or developed delayed seizures, CT showed that the hemorrhage evolved to a hypodense appearance; if the seizure did not recur, CT showed that the hemorrhage evolved to an isodense appearance. 
Evaluation of optic nerve sheath fenestration in pseudotumor cerebri using automated perimetry. Evaluation of the efficacy of optic nerve sheath fenestration in pseudotumor cerebri has been hindered by a lack of quantitative indicators of visual function before and after treatment. Nine patients (14 eyes) were treated who had pseudotumor with optic nerve sheath fenestration, in whom automated perimetry was used as a major parameter in the decision to undertake surgery and in evaluating the results. Visual field results demonstrated significant improvement in this group of patients. Seven of 8 eyes with total loss less than 1500 dB had improvement or no further deterioration. Using results of the last preoperative examination as baseline, it was found that six of the eight had improvement over 150 dB. In one patient, a slight deterioration occurred postoperatively. Those eyes with total loss above 1500 dB demonstrated stabilization of fields postoperatively. Statistical analysis of total loss preoperatively and postoperatively for this group of patients demonstrated significant improvement for five of the six comparisons investigated. Average preoperative total loss and average postoperative total loss were not significantly different. Comparisons of results of the last preoperative examination to those of the first postoperative and most recent follow-up examinations, and evaluation of average total loss postoperatively showed significant improvement had occurred. Results of the first postoperative examination and those of the most recent follow-up examination showed significant improvement from the average preoperative total loss. 
Interaction between T cell receptor beta chain and immunoglobulin heavy chain region genes in susceptibility to insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus. Despite some reports of an association between insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM) and a BglII RFLP in the T cell receptor beta chain (TCRB) constant region, results of several recent studies, including our own, have failed to support such an association. However, we here report evidence for an IDDM-TCRB relationship which is dependent on immunoglobulin heavy-chain-region genes. We analyzed 198 unrelated diabetics and 84 normal siblings (maximum one sibling per diabetic) typed for the BglII TCRB RFLP and Gm immunoglobulin allotypes Glm(1), Glm(2), G2m(23), and G3m(5), which identify the four common Gm haplotypes. The BglIII TCRB genotype frequencies were significantly different between diabetics positive and negative for G2m(23) (P = .017) and G3m(5) (P = .021) but were not different between normal siblings positive and negative for those allotypes (P = .94 and P = .77, respectively). Thus, there were significant interactions between TCRB, Gm, and IDDM for two of the four immunoglobulin allotypes examined. We have previously reported interactions between HLA, Gm (particularly G2m(23)), and IDDM and postulate that the TCRB-Gm-IDDM and HLA-Gm-IDDM interaction effects may be functionally related. 
Comparing clinical information with claims data: some similarities and differences How well can hospital discharge abstracts be used to estimate patient health status? This paper compares information on comorbidity obtained from hospital discharge abstracts for patients undergoing prostatectomy or cholecystectomy at a Winnipeg teaching hospital with clinical data on preoperative medical conditions prospectively collected during an Anesthesia Follow-up study. The diagnostic information on cardiovascular disease, respiratory disease, and metabolic disorders showed considerable agreement, ranging from 65 to over 90% correspondence across the two data sets. Certain conditions noted by the anesthesiologist were often absent from the claims data; cardiovascular disease was recorded in the clinical data but absent from the claims for 31% of prostatectomy and 17% of cholecystectomy cases. Such patients were less likely to have been assigned a high score on the ASA Physical Status measure or to have high-risk diagnoses on the hospital file. Similar findings resulted from comparing the two sources in their ability to predict such adverse outcomes as mortality and readmission to hospital: the anesthesia file generally included less serious comorbidity. 
Effects of caffeine on tobacco withdrawal. Smoking cessation increases caffeine blood levels, and this has been hypothesized to cause some of the symptoms of tobacco withdrawal (e.g., anxiety and insomnia). To test this hypothesis, 10 coffee drinkers who smoked cigarettes were entered into a completely within-subjects experimental design in which the effects of caffeine dose (0, 50, and 100 mg/coffee serving) and smoking status (smoking versus abstinence) were examined over a 4-day period. Self-reported and observed measures of tobacco withdrawal, caffeine withdrawal, and intoxication, as well as psychomotor tasks and vital signs, were completed daily; blood was drawn at the end of each period. Temporary abstinence produced typical withdrawal symptoms but did not significantly increase caffeine blood levels. Caffeine did not increase the severity of symptoms but did decrease the severity of withdrawal-induced hunger. These findings suggest that, in the absence of increased blood levels, caffeine does not increase the severity of tobacco withdrawal. 
Angiography is useful in detecting the source of chronic gastrointestinal bleeding of obscure origin. The treatment of patients with chronic gastrointestinal bleeding can be a frustrating diagnostic challenge. In the past 10-15 years, a variety of new diagnostic procedures (e.g., fiber-optic endoscopy, scintigraphy, and double-contrast barium studies) have become available to examine these patients. Despite these new procedures, a small number of patients continue to bleed without a defined cause. We sought to evaluate the role of visceral angiography in patients with chronic gastrointestinal bleeding in whom findings on an extensive noninvasive workup have been normal. Between 1983 and 1990, we obtained angiograms on 36 such patients. The cause of bleeding was established by angiography in 16 patients (44%). In 11 of these 16, angiography revealed only a structural abnormality without active bleeding. Twenty patients had normal angiographic findings. No angiograms were false-positive, but three were false-negative (8%). No complication occurred as a result of the angiographic procedures. Our experience shows that visceral angiography can provide a positive diagnosis in a significant number of patients with chronic gastrointestinal bleeding of obscure origin in whom all other diagnostic measures have been unrevealing. Despite improvements in noninvasive diagnostic techniques, angiography still remains an important tool for examining this group of patients. 
Thoracoabdominal aneurysm resection after previous infrarenal abdominal aortic aneurysmectomy. Thoracoabdominal aneurysms in 51 patients were repaired over 5 years ending in February 1991. Fourteen (27%, 14 of 51) patients had a prior infrarenal aneurysm resection (PRA); their data are analyzed separately. The average age of patients who had undergone PRA was 67 years (range: 56 to 86 years). The mean aneurysm diameter was 8.6 cm (range: 5 to 12 cm), and the mean time interval between initial aneurysm surgery and subsequent resection of the thoracoabdominal aneurysm was 8.5 years (range: 2 to 17 years). Three patients in the PRA group were operated on emergently, two because of clinical evidence of rupture; the other patients underwent elective repair. Early mortality (30 days) in the PRA group was significantly related to age (72 years or older versus younger than 72 years: 75% versus 10%, p = 0.04), proximal extent of aneurysm (above diaphragm versus below diaphragm: 50% versus 0%, p = 0.05), ruptured aneurysm (ruptured versus nonruptured: 100% versus 16%, p = 0.06), and a cardiac history of myocardial infarction (57% versus 0%, p = 0.03), congestive heart failure (66% versus 0%, p = 0.01), or arrhythmia (80% versus 0%, p = 0.005). Similar results were seen with the entire group of patients with thoracoabdominal aneurysms except that the proximal extent of the aneurysm was not related to mortality. These results demonstrate that thoracoabdominal aneurysm resection after prior infrarenal aneurysmectomy is not associated with increased mortality or morbidity. 
Closure of a tracheoesophageal fistula by bronchoscopic application of fibrin glue and decontamination of the oral cavity. A tracheoesophageal fistula was successfully closed with a fibrin adhesive applied by means of a fiberoptic bronchoscope, instead of by esophagoscopy. To facilitate closure of the fistula, the technique was combined with decontamination of the oral cavity, to avoid bacterial contamination. The procedure is proposed as an alternative to surgery for critically ill patients. 
Usefulness of excitable gap and pattern of resetting in atrial flutter for determining reentry circuit location. Clinical and experimental data show that type I atrial flutter is due to a reentry mechanism with an excitable gap. To define the location of the reentry circuit of atrial flutter, width of excitable gap, poststimulation cycle and pattern of reset after premature stimulus were analyzed in 18 patients during atrial flutter at multiple atrial sites (high, lateral, posterior and septal right atrium, and coronary sinus). The pattern of reset was defined as flat or increasing whether the return cycle remained unchanged or prolonged with increasing prematurity. Shorter values of the excitable gap were found at the coronary sinus (33 +/- 8 ms) and high right atrium (30 +/- 10 ms) than at the posterior (43 +/- 9 ms) or septal right atrium (45 +/- 11 ms). Intermediate values (36 +/- 8 ms) were measured at the lateral right atrium. Poststimulation cycle, corrected for atrial flutter cycle length, was shorter in the posterior (6 +/- 7 ms) and septal right atrium (5 +/- 7 ms) than in the coronary sinus (35 +/- 9 ms), and the high (23 +/- 10 ms) and lateral right atrium (15 +/- 9 ms). A flat pattern of resetting occurred more frequently at the septal (18 of 18 patients) and posterior right atrium (15 of 18) than at the lateral (8 of 18) and high right atrium (2 of 17), and was never observed at the coronary sinus. Atrial flutter was successfully terminated by overdrive atrial pacing in 15 of 18 patients, and termination was more easily obtained from the septal and posterior right atrium. 
Chronic posttraumatic aortic pseudoaneurysm. Recognition before rupture. Few patients survive transection of the aorta caused by blunt trauma. However, among those who do are a small number who go on to live with an unrecognized pseudoaneurysm that may rupture at any time. Because these aneurysms may be mistaken for more common disease processes, such as hilar adenopathy, atherosclerotic aneurysm, or neoplasia, the authors describe radiographic findings that suggest the correct diagnosis. 
Depression in spouses of chronic pain patients: the role of patient pain and anger, and marital satisfaction. Although several studies have shown that spouses of chronic pain patients may experience clinically significant depressive symptoms few studies have comprehensively examined the role of both patient and spouse-related factors in the development and maintenance of this emotional distress. Twenty-nine married male chronic benign low back pain patients and their spouses were recruited in order to examine the role of patient, spouse, and marital factors in spouse depressive symptomatology. The results indicated that 28% percent of the spouses in the sample reported significantly depressed mood. A 2-stage regression analysis was employed that revealed 3 significant predictors of spouse's depressed mood, namely patient's average pain; patient's reported levels of anger and hostility, and the spouse's level of marital satisfaction. These findings are discussed in terms of their implications for clinical interventions for pain patients and their families. 
Blood leukotrienes in headache: correlation with platelet activity. Platelet hyperactivity, one of the commonest findings associated with migraine, has been related to increased release of biologically active substances such as catecholamines and arachidonic acid metabolites, which seem to play a role in the pathogenesis of migraine. In this study, in vitro platelet aggregation tests were performed on samples from patients with different types of headache. The presence of platelet hyperactivity was clearly demonstrated in 11 patients with classical migraine between attacks, but not in 4 patients between attacks of common migraine. Nevertheless, the presence of a marked platelet hyporesponsivity was found during the attack phase of both classical and common migraine. No difference in platelet aggregability was found between attack and post-attack phases in 5 patients with cluster headache. Blood leukotrienes were analyzed in 8 patients with classical migraine and in the 5 patients with cluster headache. During the attack phase of classical migraine both LTC4 and LTB4 were present in the peripheral blood, while the post-attack phase was characterized by the disappearance of LTC4 and the presence of LTB4 and its transisomer delta 6-trans-LTB4. Blood leukotrienes were constantly absent during both phases of cluster headache. Incubation of normal platelets with LTC4 or delta 6-trans-LTB4 was followed by inhibition of platelet response to epinephrine. delta 6-trans-LTB4, at higher concentrations, induced the opposite effect. A possible role of blood leukotrienes in the changes occurring in platelet aggregability during the different phases of classical migraine, is discussed. 
Expression of brain natriuretic peptide gene in human heart. Production in the ventricle. To elucidate the expression of the brain natriuretic peptide gene in the human heart, we have measured brain natriuretic peptide mRNA levels in hearts using the Northern blot hybridization method. Brain natriuretic peptide mRNA was present with a size of approximately 0.9 kb in the ventricle as well as in the atrium. The brain natriuretic peptide mRNA level in the ventricle was 52% of that in the atrium, whereas the atrial natriuretic peptide mRNA level in the ventricle was approximately two orders of magnitude lower than that in the atrium. Taking atrial and ventricular weights into account, the total amount of brain natriuretic peptide mRNA in the ventricle represented 77% of that in the whole heart. These results demonstrate that most of brain natriuretic peptide mRNA occurs in the ventricle, in contrast with atrial natriuretic peptide mRNA, which is present mainly in the atrium, indicating that the ventricle is a major production site of brain natriuretic peptide. 
Stress failure in pulmonary capillaries. In the mammalian lung, alveolar gas and blood are separated by an extremely thin membrane, despite the fact that mechanical failure could be catastrophic for gas exchange. We raised the pulmonary capillary pressure in anesthetized rabbits until stress failure occurred. At capillary transmural pressures greater than or equal to 40 mmHg, disruption of the capillary endothelium and alveolar epithelium was seen in some locations. The three principal forces acting on the capillary wall were analyzed. 1) Circumferential wall tension caused by the transmural pressure. This is approximately 25 dyn/cm (25 mN/m) at failure where the radius of curvature of the capillary is 5 microns. This tension is small, being comparable with the tension in the alveolar wall associated with lung elastic recoil. 2) Surface tension of the alveolar lining layer. This contributes support to the capillaries that bulge into the alveolar spaces at these high pressures. When protein leakage into the alveolar spaces occurs because of stress failure, the increase in surface tension caused by surfactant inhibition could be a powerful force preventing further failure. 3) Tension of the tissue elements in the alveolar wall associated with lung inflation. This may be negligible at normal lung volumes but considerable at high volumes. Whereas circumferential wall tension is low, capillary wall stress at failure is very high at approximately 8 x 10(5) dyn/cm2 (8 x 10(4) N/m2) where the thickness is only 0.3 microns. This is approximately the same as the wall stress of the normal aorta, which is predominantly composed of collagen and elastin. The strength of the thin part of the capillary wall is probably attributable to the collagen IV of the basement membranes. The safety factor is apparently small when the capillary pressure is raised during heavy exercise. Stress failure causes increased permeability with protein leakage, or frank hemorrhage, and probably has a role in several types of lung disease. 
Chylothorax after childbirth. We report a case of chylothorax which appeared in a mother after childbirth. Disruption of the thoracic duct occurred with the high intrathoracic pressures generated by the Valsalva maneuver used by the patient during labor to "push." No evidence of other trauma or malignancy were found and the patient did well after use of total parenteral nutrition, thoracotomy with thoracic duct ligation, and pleurodesis. 
Stereotactic radiosurgery for arteriovenous malformations of the brain. Stereotactic radiosurgery successfully obliterates carefully selected arteriovenous malformations (AVM's) of the brain. In an initial 3-year experience using the 201-source cobalt-60 gamma knife at the University of Pittsburgh, 227 patients with AVM's were treated. Symptoms at presentation included prior hemorrhage in 143 patients (63%), headache in 104 (46%), and seizures in 70 (31%). Neurological deficits were present in 102 patients (45%). Prior surgical resection (resulting in subtotal removal) had been performed in 36 patients (16%). In 47 selected patients (21%), embolization procedures were performed in an attempt to reduce the AVM size prior to radiosurgery. The lesions were classified according to the Spetzler grading system: 64 (28%) were Grade VI (inoperable), 22 (10%) were Grade IV, 90 (40%) were Grade III, 43 (19%) were Grade II, and eight (4%) were Grade I. With the aid of computer imaging-integrated isodose plans for single-treatment irradiation, total coverage of the AVM nidus was possible in 216 patients (95%). The location and volume of the AVM were the most important factors for the selection of radiation dose. Magnetic resonance (MR) imaging was performed at 6-month intervals in 161 patients. Seventeen patients who had MR evidence of complete obliteration underwent angiography within 3 months of imaging: in 14 (82%) complete obliteration was confirmation being 4 months (mean 17 months) after radiosurgery. The 2-year obliteration rates according to volume were: all eight (100%) AVM's less than 1 cu cm; 22 (85%) of 26 AVM's of 1 to 4 cu cm; and seven (58%) of 12 AVM's greater than 4 cu cm. Magnetic resonance imaging revealed postirradiation changes in 38 (24%) of 161 patients at a mean interval of 10.2 months after radiosurgery; only 10 (26%) of those 38 patients were symptomatic. In the entire series, two patients developed permanent new neurological deficits believed to be treatment-related. Two patients died of repeat hemorrhage at 6 and 23 months after treatment during the latency interval prior to obliteration. Stereotactic radiosurgery is an important method to obliterate AVM's, especially those previously considered inoperable. Success and complication risks are related to the AVM location and the volume treated. 
HMB-45 immunohistochemical staining of conjunctival melanocytic lesions. HMB-45 is a monoclonal antibody recently described as being highly specific for melanocytic proliferations of the skin and in metastases of melanotic lesions. To determine a possible role for HMB-45 in ophthalmic pathology, 45 conjunctival lesions, including 23 melanomas, were analyzed using immunohistochemical techniques with anti-S-100 and HMB-45 as primary antibodies. Nineteen (82.6%) of the melanomas exhibited HMB-45 positivity, and 19 (82.6%) contained S-100 protein, with concordance of all but two cases. Seven cases of primary acquired melanosis were studied; one (33%) of three with atypia was HMB-45 positive, as were two (50%) of four without atypia. Among nevi, 1 (9.1%) of 11 showed faint staining with HMB-45. Fifteen conjunctival epithelial dysplasias were negative with HMB-45. At present, HMB-45 appears to offer no great advantage over S-100 protein in the analysis of conjunctival melanomas. Its role in the distinction of benign from atypical or malignant junctional melanocytic proliferations remains unclear. 
Evaluation of dipyridamole-Doppler echocardiography for detection of myocardial ischemia and coronary artery disease. Doppler assessment of left ventricular filling and ejection during dipyridamole stress may supplement wall motion analysis for detection of myocardial ischemia and coronary artery disease (CAD). Thirty-four patients taking no cardioactive therapy were studied using intravenous dipyridamole (0.6 mg/kg) during 2-dimensional and pulsed Doppler echocardiography. Twelve patients had normal coronary arteries (group 1) and the remainder, who had significant CAD, were divided into groups 2 (n = 11) and 3 (n = 11). Only subjects in group 2 developed myocardial ischemia manifest as reversible regional asynergy and ST-segment depression. Heart rate increased (16 +/- 9 beats/min, p less than 0.01) and mean blood pressure decreased (-5 +/- 8 mm Hg, p = not significant) uniformly across groups. Exaggerated hyperkinesia of normally contracting wall segments was the common response to dipyridamole infusion in patients with CAD. The respective mean percent changes in peak early diastolic velocity, peak atrial velocity, their ratio and ejection peak velocity, and mean acceleration for groups 1 (20, 42, -13, 20 and 23%), 2 (22, 32, -2, 10 and 14%) and 3 (23, 33, -6, 16 and 18%) were similar. Comparisons between normal patients and those with CAD and between groups 2 and 3 revealed no significant differences in the effect of dipyridamole on any variable. However, a decrease in both peak velocity and mean acceleration of left ventricular ejection was seen in 3 of 4 group 2 patients who developed severe ischemia. Dipyridamole-Doppler echocardiography is insensitive for detection of CAD and appears unable to identify myocardial ischemia unless this is severe. Hemodynamic changes and compensatory wall motion induced by dipyridamole may explain these findings. 
Bile duct diverticula and webs: nonspecific cholangiographic features of primary sclerosing cholangitis. Biliary tree diverticula and webs are considered by several authors to be specific cholangiographic features of primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC). Our experience suggested that these findings can be seen in patients without PSC. The purpose of this study was twofold: to establish whether diverticula and webs are indeed specific for PSC and to assess whether PSC can be accurately diagnosed without reference to diverticula or webs. We retrospectively reviewed 861 consecutive ERCP studies and found 32 cases of webs and/or diverticula. Using accepted cholangiographic, clinical, and histologic criteria, we diagnosed PSC in nine patients and excluded it in 21, with two instances of uncertain diagnoses. Webs and diverticula seen in PSC were cholangiographically indistinguishable from those in the group without PSC. All 21 patients without PSC had other biliary abnormalities, and were grouped by the predominant abnormality or finding believed to be associated with diverticulum or web formation: common duct stones or cholangitis (n = 11 patients), postoperative stricture (n = 4), bile duct stent and balloon dilatation (n = 3), malignant stricture (n = 2), and choledochoduodenostomy (n = 1). To assess cholangiographic diagnosis of PSC in these patients, a blinded reviewer studied the radiographs of the 30 patients with diverticula and/or webs who had confirmed diagnoses. By using established radiologic criteria alone (ignoring diverticula and webs), the correct diagnosis was made in 27, yielding a sensitivity of 89% and specificity of 91%. We conclude that the presence of diverticula and/or webs on a cholangiogram is a nonspecific finding and may be due to inflammation or trauma to the bile duct wall. Further, PSC can be distinguished from other abnormalities on the basis of findings other than diverticula and webs. 
Complications following external beam radiation therapy for prostate cancer: an analysis of patients treated with and without staging pelvic lymphadenectomy. We reviewed the treatment morbidity associated with definitive high energy external beam radiotherapy in 289 consecutive patients with clinically localized prostate cancer (stages A2 to C) treated from 1984 to 1988 inclusively. All patients were treated with 18 mv. photon beams via a 4-field box technique. Radiation doses ranged from 5,858 to 6,900 cGy., with a mean dose of 6,456 cGy. and a median dose of 6,400 cGy. A total of 65 patients underwent extraperitoneal pelvic staging lymphadenectomy before radiotherapy. Complications noted in 42 patients were mild (generally trivial) in 23 and moderate in 19 (6.6%). There were no severe complications. The actuarial incidence of moderate complications was 9% at 5 years. Only 6 patients experienced symptoms for longer than 6 months. The risk of complications was not increased in patients who had undergone prior lymph node dissection, and only 2 of 65 had mild lymphedema, which resolved in both cases. We conclude that high energy external beam radiation for prostate cancer can be delivered with a low risk of serious complications, even in patients who have undergone extraperitoneal staging pelvic lymphadenectomy, provided the patients are treated to limited fields with high energy photons and at doses limited to 6,800 cGy. or less. 
Liesegang rings developing within intraperitoneal endometriotic implants. A case report. Liesegang rings are acellular, laminated structures that have been reported to accompany a variety of necrotizing and hemorrhagic tissue processes. Although most frequently seen in the kidneys and synovium, they can be present in other tissues. Liesegang rings are of importance because they are frequently confused by pathologists with helminth ova and nematodes, which they resemble. A case of Liesegang rings was associated with intraperitoneal endometriotic implants, with which the rings appeared to have originated. 
Autosomal recessive lethal infantile cytochrome C oxidase deficiency. Three bedouin children with mitochondrial myopathy due to cytochrome c oxidase deficiency presented with progressive muscle weakness, failure to thrive, proximal renal tubular acidosis, and lactic acidemia leading to death. Two died by age 5 months and one by age 16 months. Cytochrome c oxidase was markedly reduced in skeletal muscle extracts of all three. Three other children of the same family with most probably the same metabolic aberration are also described. We suggest an autosomal recessive inheritance for this lethal mitochondrial myopathy. 
Rapid development of vitamin K deficiency in an adolescent boy receiving total parenteral nutrition following bone marrow transplantation. In this case report the development of a vitamin K deficiency in a neutropenic adolescent receiving parenteral nutrition following bone marrow transplantation is described. The parenteral nutrition solution did not provide vitamin K and the patient had been receiving oral antibiotics prior to and during use of the intravenous feeding. Oral intake was minimal. Standard adult oral and intravenous multivitamin preparations for use in individuals older than 11 years do not routinely contain this vitamin. The function of vitamin K and causes for development of a deficiency are reviewed. Recommended intakes and guidelines for supplementation are also discussed. 
Risk factors for type-1 reactions in borderline leprosy patients. Type-1 or reversal reactions are the major cause of nerve damage and disability in leprosy. We wished to determine whether there were any clinical or laboratory markers that identified patients with an increased risk of type-1 reaction. 42 (31%) of 136 Nepalese borderline leprosy patients (97 male, 39 female; age range 7-73 years) had a type-1 reaction during the first 2 years of multi-drug therapy. Before therapy, 41 (98%) of the 42 patients were seropositive for antibodies to one of three mycobacterial antigens. Seropositivity for IgM antiphenolic-glycolipid-1 (PGL-1) antibodies, but not IgG anti-lipoarabinomannan or anti-Mycobacterium leprae 35 kDa protein antibodies, was significantly associated with subsequent manifestation of a type-1 reaction (p less than 0.001). The concentration of IgM anti-PGL-1 antibodies in serum was significantly higher in patients in whom a type-1 reaction developed. The risk attributable to anti-PGL-1 seropositivity was independent of leprosy class, skin smear positivity, and the presence of other anti-M leprae antibodies (adjusted odds ratio = 8.7, p less than 0.001). In the 87 patients who had a lepromin test, anti-PGL-1 seropositivity and lepromin reactivity were significant independent risk factors for subsequent reaction. 78% of patients with positive lepromin reactivity and IgM anti-PGL-1 antibodies had type-1 reactions. Patients with these risk factors should be carefully monitored during antimicrobial therapy to permit early initiation of anti-inflammatory treatment thus minimising permanent nerve damage and resultant disability. 
Propranolol in prevention of recurrent bleeding from severe portal hypertensive gastropathy in cirrhosis. The two main causes of gastrointestinal bleeding in cirrhosis are oesophageal varices and portal hypertensive gastropathy (PHG). Rebleeding from varices can be prevented by beta-blockers, but it is not clear whether these drugs effectively reduce rebleeding from PHG. 54 cirrhotic patients with acute or chronic bleeding from severe PHG took part in a randomised, controlled trial to investigate the efficacy of propranolol in prevention of rebleeding from PHG. 26 patients were randomised to receive propranolol daily at a dose that reduced the resting heart rate by 25% or to 55 bpm (20-160 mg twice daily), throughout mean follow-up of 21 (SD 11) months. 28 untreated controls were followed-up, with the same examinations, for 18 (13) months. The actuarial percentages of patients free of rebleeding from PHG were significantly higher in the propranolol-treated patients than in the untreated controls at 12 months (65% vs 38%; p less than 0.05) and at 30 months of follow-up (52% vs 7%; p less than 0.05). Propranolol-treated patients had fewer episodes of acute bleeding than controls (0.010 [0.004] vs 0.120 [0.040] per patient per month). Multivariate analysis showed that absence of propranolol treatment was the only predictive variable for rebleeding. Actuarial survival was slightly higher in the propranolol group than in the controls, but the difference was not significant. Thus, long-term propranolol treatment significantly reduces the frequency of rebleeding from severe PHG, and may improve the prognosis of cirrhotic patients with this disorder. 
Rice solution and World Health Organization solution by gastric infusion for high stool output diarrhea. We sought to determine the efficacy of three different types of treatment in children with acute diarrhea who, during the oral rehydration period, had high stool output (greater than 10 mL/kg per hour). Sixty-six children, aged 1 to 18 months, with an average stool output of 22.6 mL/kg per hour were randomly distributed into three groups: group 1 received a rice flour solution, group 2 received the World Health Organization rehydration solution by gastric infusion, and group 3 continued to receive this solution orally. In all three groups, a decrease in stool output was observed, with the higher decrease observed in group 1 patients. Such a decrease facilitated rehydration of all 22 patients in group 1 (100%) in 3.3 +/- 1.5 hours, 16 (73%) in group 2 in 4.3 +/- 2.1 hours, and 15 (69%) in group 3 in 4.9 +/- 2.0 hours. No complications were observed. These data indicate that the rice flour solution is effective in children with high stool output diarrhea. 
New technique of esophageal exclusion for chronic esophageal perforation. A new technique of near-total esophageal exclusion was used successfully in the treatment of 2 patients with chronic thoracic esophageal perforation and continuing sepsis. The most striking point of this technique is the use of cervical T-tube esophagostomy with the lower arm of the T tube circumfixed by chromic catgut tie to prevent swallowing of saliva. Whereas most of the previously reported procedures of cervical esophageal diversion require subsequent esophageal reconstruction, this technique is simple and effective and does not require a second operation. 
Chronic pain: a PET study of the central effects of percutaneous high cervical cordotomy. We have studied 5 patients with unilateral, severe chronic pain due to cancer before and after percutaneous, ventrolateral cervical cordotomy to investigate the central effects of the procedure. The aim was to identify the functional anatomical correlates of abolishing unilateral nociceptive input to the brain. Patients were investigated by positron emission tomography using C15O2 to evaluate cerebral blood flow. Comparisons were made between the patients with unilateral pain before cordotomy and normal volunteers. These demonstrated significantly less blood flow in 3 out of 4 of the individual quadrants of the hemithalamus contralateral to the side of pain (P less than 0.01-0.05). These differences were abolished by cordotomy. Comparison of the patients before and after cordotomy showed a significant decrease in blood flow in the dorsal anterior quadrant of the thalamus contralateral to the side of pain (P less than 0.05) which was normalised after cordotomy. There were no significant changes in the prefrontal or primary somatosensory cortex. We conclude that chronic pain results in a decrease of synaptic activity at thalamic level either from decreased activity in neurones projecting to that region and/or attenuated local neuronal firing. We have demonstrated no secondary remote effects in cortex, indicating the importance of subcortical mechanisms in central responses to chronic pain. 
Conservative management of breast fibroadenomas. Is it conservative or radical management to excise all fibroadenomas of the breast, especially in women less than 30 years old? Once a definite diagnosis is established by physical examination, fine-needle aspiration cytologic testing, and mammography, is it prudent to monitor women with small fibroadenomas (less than 4 cm in diameter)? We reviewed 498 cases of biopsy-proved fibroadenomas and 17 cases of phyllodes tumors (by biopsy) seen at Los Angeles County/University of Southern California Medical Center from 1986 to 1989. Analysis of patient age and measured tumor size in 203 fibroadenomas and 10 phyllodes tumor specimens revealed similar ranges for both tumors. The mean values were 28.5 years and 2.3 cm for fibroadenomas and 44 years and 3.8 cm for phyllodes tumors. No cases of coincident carcinoma within a fibroadenoma or of metastatic malignant phyllodes tumors were present in this review. As an alternative to excising all breast tumors, cytologically diagnosed fibroadenomas can be monitored, because they have no intrinsic premalignant potential and tend to regress with time. All breast tumors that rapidly increase in size should probably be excised at any age. 
Total parenteral nutrition increases mortality after hemorrhage OBJECTIVES: To determine the effect of total parenteral nutrition (TPN) and different enteral feeding formulas on survival and liver function following hemorrhage in rats. DESIGN: Prospective randomized controlled study. SETTING: Laboratory of a large university-affiliated medical school. SUBJECTS: Sixty-seven male Sprague-Dawley rats weighing 350 to 450 g. INTERVENTIONS: Jugular and gastroduodenal feeding catheters were inserted in animals 1 day before hemorrhage, and animals were started on one of six different fluid or nutritional regimens: TPN, iv saline, an enteral amino acid-based formula (AA) (Vivonex-TEN), an enteral peptide-based formula (PEP) (Reabilan-HN), an enteral intact-protein based formula (PRO) (Osmolite-HN), or enteral saline. A catheter was inserted in the tail artery and animals were hemorrhaged 5 mL/kg at baseline and 1 hr later. Animals were returned to their cages and observed for survival. Liver function was determined by measuring circulating bile acid levels at baseline and 24 hr after hemorrhage. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Mortality was significantly increased in animals receiving TPN (63%) and AA (24%). Mortality was 13% in animals receiving PRO and 0% in animals receiving PEP and saline. Liver function deteriorated in all animals after hemorrhage except the PEP group. CONCLUSIONS: TPN and AA increased mortality in animals after hemorrhage. PEP was associated with zero mortality and protection of liver function after hemorrhage. 
Comparative trial of cefprozil vs. amoxicillin clavulanate potassium in the treatment of children with acute otitis media with effusion. A total of 137 children with acute otitis media with effusion were randomly allocated to treatment with cefprozil (30 mg/kg/day divided into two equal doses), an investigational cephalosporin or amoxicillin clavulanate potassium (40 mg/kg/day divided into three equal doses) for 10 days. The most common pathogens obtained from middle ear cavities by tympanocentesis were Streptococcus pneumoniae (33%), Haemophilus influenzae (19.6%) and Moraxella catarrhalis (8.3%). Patients were scheduled for follow-up visits at midtreatment, at end of therapy and at 30 days. Of the 137 children 122 were evaluable. Five of 60 patients (8.3%) treated with cefprozil and 14 of 62 patients (22.5%) treated with amoxicillin clavulanate potassium were considered therapeutic failures because of persistence of symptoms and/or isolation of the original pathogen or superinfection (P = 0.05). Rates of relapse, reinfection and persistent middle ear effusion as documented by tympanogram were comparable in both groups. When persistent middle ear effusion was analyzed by pneumatic otoscopy, 64 of 103 affected ears (62.1%) treated with cefprozil and 80 of 105 affected ears (76.1%) treated with amoxicillin clavulanate potassium were abnormal (P = 0.04). Loose stools were more common in children treated with amoxicillin clavulanate potassium than in children treated with cefprozil (P = 0.0004). Based on the efficacy results from this study, the lower gastrointestinal side effects and the convenience of twice-a-day dosing, we believe that cefprozil in a dosage of 30 mg/kg/day divided every 12 hours represents a potential alternative for the treatment of acute otitis media with effusion in children. 
Are malignant melanoma patients at higher risk for a second cancer? This study tests whether malignant melanoma (MM) patients are at higher risk of having an unrelated second cancer by comparing the observed incidence of a second cancer in a given population of MM patients with the expected number in an age-matched and sex-matched group of healthy people followed for a similar period. The analysis was based on the person-years method in which the main consideration is the follow-up period after the diagnosis of MM. Of 370 patients with histologically confirmed MM, 27 (7.3%) had a second noncutaneous invasive cancer, diagnosed either simultaneously (within 6 months, five patients) or after the diagnosis of MM (22 patients). The follow-up period for the entire MM group was 1253 person-years, a period during which the expected number of cancer cases in the normal population, according to the Israel Cancer Registry, was 6.6. The observed-expected ratio or the relative risk (RR) was 4.1 (P less than 0.01). After excluding the five patients with simultaneous diagnosis of MM and a second cancer, analysis of the remaining 22 patients in whom MM definitely preceded the second cancer showed an RR of 3.3 (P less than 0.01). For the entire group, there were nine patients with breast cancer, five with head and neck cancer (two with thyroid and three with oral cavity cancer), five with gynecologic cancer (one with uterine and four with ovarian cancer), five myeloproliferative malignancies (one with lymphoma, three with chronic lymphocytic leukemia, and one with myeloma), three gastrointestinal carcinomas (two with colon and one with stomach cancer), and two soft tissue sarcomas. When the differential analysis according to gender and age was done, it was found that the RR was higher for women (5.5, P less than 0.01) than for men where the RR was 2.2 (P less than 0.05). Differential analysis for various age groups showed that the trend for second cancer was consistent in all age groups, with a slight increase in the younger ones. None of the variables of MM, such as location of the primary tumor, level of invasion, or stage, were predictive for a second cancer. Furthermore, the RR for a second cancer did not relate significantly with the treatment given to the MM patient. Concerning the type of second cancer, it was found that the RR was especially high for breast cancer--6.6. These data indicate that MM patients may be at higher risk for having a noncutaneous invasive cancer compared with the general population. 
Sezary syndrome in a patient with hairy cell leukemia in remission. A 65-year-old man was evaluated for pancytopenia in March 1979, and found to have hairy cell leukemia (HCL). Treatment with splenectomy and subsequently interferon produced temporary remissions. In July 1985, the patient began intravenous deoxycoformycin (DCF) therapy, and after 1 year complete peripheral blood and bone marrow remission was achieved. Fourteen months after cessation of therapy, the patient developed a skin rash and was found to have cutaneous T-cell lymphoma and Sezary syndrome. Morphologic study of the hairy cells (HC) in the peripheral blood at presentation and the Sezary cells was distinct by light and electron microscopic study. Immunophenotyping of peripheral blood mononuclear cells showed clearly that the HC were of B-cell origin (CD20+, sIg+), whereas the lymphoid population at second presentation was T-cell (CD3+, CD4+, HLA-DR-). Clonal rearrangement of T-cell antigen receptor beta-chain gene was detected by Southern analysis of the Sezary cell population, whereas immunoglobulin heavy and light chain genes remained in germ line configuration. This is the first case of Sezary syndrome developing in a patient previously treated for HCL where studies have confirmed distinct B-cell and T-cell origin of the two neoplasms. The authors suggest that treatment and disease-related immunosuppression are possible etiologic factors in the development of this second lymphoid neoplasm. 
Fractures of the spine in diffuse idiopathic skeletal hyperostosis. Fractures of the spine in diffuse idiopathic skeletal hyperostosis (DISH) have rarely been reported. Only four cases could be found in the world literature. Eight new cases with nine fractures are reported in this study. The critical features are the frequent delays in diagnosis (three of eight patients) and the high rate of immediate and delayed neurologic deficit (seven of eight patients). Two fracture patterns occurred in this group. The first type occurred through the midportion of an ankylosed segment of the spine and involved the vertebral body (five fractures). The second type occurred at the top or bottom of a fused segment (four fractures). The latter were disk disruptions or odontoid fractures. This is a marked difference from spinal fractures in ankylosing spondylitis, in which the majority are transdiskal fractures. The difference can be explained on the basis of the different pathology of these two disease processes. Careful evaluation of patients with DISH who sustain trauma is critical. Treatment of this rare injury should be early stabilization of the spine to avoid complications of nonunion, deformity, neurologic injury, and death. 
Right ventricular infarction: recognition and assessment of its hemodynamic significance by two-dimensional echocardiography. To evaluate the ability of two-dimensional echocardiographic indexes to determine the hemodynamic significance of the right ventricular infarction, 24 patients with electrocardiographic evidence of right ventricular infarction were studied. Hemodynamic significance was defined as a jugular venous pressure greater than 17 cm H2O or a right atrial pressure greater than 13 mm Hg. Patients with hemodynamically significant right ventricular infarctions (group I, n = 9) had a 56% incidence of hypotension (blood pressure less than 90 mm Hg) with a mean systolic blood pressure of 93 +/- 23 mm Hg, whereas patients with nonhemodynamically significant right ventricular infarctions (group II, n = 15) had no hypotension and a mean systolic blood pressure of 121 +/- 18 mm Hg (p less than 0.01). The ratio of right atrial to pulmonary capillary wedge pressure was 1.1 +/- 0.6 in group I and 0.6 +/- 0.2 in group II (p less than 0.05). Echocardiography demonstrated right ventricular free wall motion abnormalities in seven patients in group I and in 10 patients in group II. The descent of the right ventricular base was 0.7 +/- 0.2 cm in group I, 1.3 +/- 0.4 cm in group II, and 2.0 +/- 0.2 cm in a group of 20 normal control patients (p less than 0.001 for all comparisons). The respiratory caval index (percentage of collapse of the inferior vena cava with inspiration) was 22% +/- 11% in group I, 45% +/- 15% in group II, and 64% +/- 17% in the control subjects (p less than 0.05 for all comparisons). 
Etiology of cerebral vasospasm in primates. A primate model was used to determine whether oxyhemoglobin (OxyHb), methemoglobin (MetHb), or bilirubin is likely to be responsible for cerebral vasospasm following subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH). Forty cynomolgus monkeys were randomly assigned to one of five groups. On Day 0, each animal underwent angiography followed by right craniectomy and placement of an Ommaya reservoir with its catheter adjacent to the right middle cerebral artery (MCA). The animals received intrathecal injections twice a day for 6 days of one of the following solutions: mock cerebrospinal fluid (CSF); OxyHb; MetHb; bilirubin; or supernatant fluid from an incubated mixture of autologous blood and mock CSF. On Day 7, angiography was repeated and the animals were killed. Comparison of angiograms obtained on Day 0 and Day 7 of the experiment showed significant vasospasm of the right MCA and the right anterior cerebral and internal carotid arteries in the animal groups that had received OxyHb or supernatant fluid. There was a smaller reduction in diameter of the same vessels in the bilirubin group (not statistically significant), while no effects were observed in the groups receiving MetHb or mock CSF. Electron microscopy of the right MCA's gave results consistent with the angiographic findings. One monkey in the OxyHb group developed a delayed-onset right MCA infarction. These data suggest that OxyHb is the cause of cerebral vasospasm following SAH. 
Renal sensitivity to endothelium-derived-relaxing-factor-mediated vasodilatation in the spontaneously hypertensive rat. 1. The sensitivity of the kidney to endothelium-derived-relaxing-factor-mediated vasodilatation has been investigated in the spontaneously hypertensive rat and the Wistar-Kyoto normotensive rat using an isolated perfused rat kidney model. 2. No difference in the slope, ED50 or maximum of the concentration-response curves for the endothelial-dependent vasodilators A23187, a calcium ionophore, and acetylcholine could be demonstrated between kidneys obtained from the spontaneously hypertensive and the Wistar-Kyoto normotensive rats. 3. No difference in the slope or the ED50 of the concentration-response curve for the endothelial-independent vasodilators, atrial natriuretic factor and sodium nitroprusside, could be demonstrated between kidneys obtained from the spontaneously hypertensive and the Wistar-Kyoto normotensive rats. However, in the spontaneously hypertensive rats, the maximum vasodilator response to atrial natriuretic factor, but not to sodium nitroprusside, was increased. 4. The perfused kidney from the spontaneously hypertensive rat also showed an increase in the maximum but not in the slope or ED50 of the concentration-response curve for vasoconstriction induced by the alpha 1-adrenoceptor agonist methoxamine. 5. The involvement of endothelium-derived relaxing factor in mediating the renal vasodilator response to A23187 and acetylcholine was confirmed in experiments performed in perfused kidneys obtained from normotensive Wistar rats. 6. It is concluded that the sensitivity of the kidney to endothelium-derived-relaxing-factor-mediated vasodilatation is not modified in the spontaneously hypertensive rat. This does not, however, exclude a role for the synthesis of endothelium-derived relaxing factor in the maintenance of blood pressure in the spontaneously hypertensive rat. 
Significance of atherosclerotic changes of the ascending aorta during coronary bypass surgery with intraoperative detection by echography. Intraoperative echographic studies of the ascending aorta were carried out on 100 of 222 patients having primary coronary bypass surgeries between May 1987 and December 1988. The purpose of this study was to investigate the feasibility of echographic study in evaluating the nature of atherosclerotic disease of the ascending aorta and its incidence and relationship to perioperative cerebrovascular complications in coronary bypass surgery. It was possible to obtain clear echographic images of the aortic wall in these 100 patients which were divided into two groups according to the degree of the degenerative process. Three of 13 patients (23%) (Group II) with severe atherosclerotic changes, suffered perioperative cerebrovascular complications, and early surgical mortality in 2 patients (15%) was caused by cerebrovascular complications. These complications were not seen in 87 patients with less than moderate atherosclerotic changes (Group I). 
Facial nerve monitoring by monopolar low constant current stimulation during acoustic neurinoma surgery. Electrophysiological characteristics of monopolar low constant current stimulation, and evoked facial muscle responses to such stimulation, were evaluated in 34 cases of acoustic neurinoma. Our study, using stimulus parameters of 0.1-ms-duration pulse wave with 0.5-0.6 mA intensity, revealed that extent of spreading current depends on the current intensity, being about 1 mm from the electrode with 0.5-0.6 mA, and insulation of the electrode prevented the current from spreading through the cerebrospinal fluid, giving a reliable amount of current to the tissue. Evoked facial muscle responses to facial nerve stimulation in the internal auditory meatus and over the pons were analyzed and revealed the following: (1) The responses to stimulation in the internal auditory meatus showed no amplitude attenuation throughout the operation. (2) The responses to stimulation over the pons gradually decreased in amplitude as tumor dissection from the nerve proceeded, especially in large tumors. (3) Anatomical continuity of the nerve was obtained in 100% of small, 91.7% of medium, and 88.2% of large tumors. Our data show that monopolar low constant current stimulation is effective in obtaining the precise anatomical orientation of the facial nerve during tumor removal. 
Hypertrophy of clitoral hood: presenting sign of neurofibromatosis in female child. Although clitoral involvement with neurofibromatosis is rare, all cases previously reported have described clitoral hypertrophy due to neurofibromas of the clitoral corpora. We report on a patient who had localized enlargement of the prepuce only, with no evidence of neurofibromatous infiltration. In all cases, diagnosis of clitoromegaly requires basic chromosomal and endocrinologic evaluation. However, recognition of its association with neurofibromatosis due to either neurofibromas of the genitalia or localized genital hypertrophy may spare the patient an unnecessary or invasive evaluation. Because of an association with urinary tract neurofibromas, the patient with genital involvement should have cystoscopy. Clitoroplasty with sparing of the neurovascular bundle and glans is the preferred method of management of the enlarged clitoris. 
Rapid improvement in a patient with leukocytoclastic vasculitis with secondary mixed cryoglobulinemia treated with cryofiltration. A patient with leukocytoclastic vasculitis (LCV) with secondary mixed cryoglobulinemia was treated by cryofiltration in an effort to stop the progression of the disease despite the use of high dose prednisone. Three cryofiltration procedures within one week were performed on this patient. Clinical assessments made through the course of this therapy and the followup period showed excellent response. Peripheral blood mononuclear cell transformation functions (MNC-TF) were evaluated at the pre-1st and post-2nd cryofiltration treatment. MNC-TF pretreatment were significantly suppressed. Post-2nd cryofiltration, MNC-TF were improved. Our study demonstrates that cryofiltration is a safe and effective treatment of a patient with LCV with secondary mixed cryoglobulinemia, without requiring plasma replacement products. 
Electromechanical dissociation in newborns treated with extracorporeal membrane oxygenation: an extreme form of cardiac stun syndrome. OBJECTIVE: To recognize cardiac stun syndrome and electromechanical dissociation in patients receiving extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO), and to define patients at risk. DESIGN: Retrospective review. SETTING: Tertiary neonatal ICU. PATIENTS: Four newborn patients with cardiorespiratory failure who developed signs of cardiac stun syndrome and electromechanical dissociation early in the ECMO course. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Initially, these patients had metabolic acidosis, chest roentgenograms showing pulmonary granularity and moderate cardiomegaly, and symptoms of severe respiratory distress. Cardiac dysfunction was apparent after ECMO was begun, with poor perfusion, pale color, narrow pulse pressure, and tachycardia despite normovolemia. Within 1 to 2 hrs, electromechanical dissociation occurred manifested by the absence of pulse pressure, palpable pulse, cardiac sounds, and apical impulse while on 50% to 70% bypass. All patients survived. INTERVENTIONS: Patients received ECMO, calcium gluconate, sodium bicarbonate, and dobutamine. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with cardiac stun syndrome have symptoms similar to severe respiratory distress syndrome, and may require ECMO support. In the ECMO patient, cardiac stun syndrome and electromechanical dissociation can be confused with low circuit volume, pneumothorax, or cardiac tamponade. Early recognition of electromechanical dissociation may improve care and outcome. Cardiac stun syndrome can be treated successfully with ECMO. 
Second operation after the failure of previous resection for epilepsy. We present our surgical experience with second operations in 15 patients with recurrent intractable partial seizures after resection for epilepsy. The interval from the first operation until the first recurrence of seizures ranged from 1 day to 7 months (mean, 62 days). The interval between the first and second operations ranged from 3 months to 12 years (mean, 38 months). Detailed video-electroencephalographic interictal and ictal recording was performed in all patients (invasive electrodes were used in 11 patients). Ictal onset was shown to be remote from the zone of previous resection in 3 of 15 cases (all 3 extratemporal and in the ipsilateral hemisphere). Recurrent seizures arose from the area of previous extratemporal resection in 2 of 15 patients, and from the area of previous temporal resection in 10 of 15 patients. Both cases of extratemporal recurrences and 3 of the 10 cases of temporal lobe recurrences in the area of previous resection were associated with residual unresected structural lesion. Of the 10 patients with local temporal recurrence, 6 had proven epileptogenicity in the residual mesial structures, and 4 had residual epileptogenicity in the unresected lateral temporal lobe. The patients have been monitored for 8 to 82 months (mean, 18 months) after the second operation: 7 patients (47%) have remained seizure-free and another 5 (33%) have achieved a reduction in seizure frequency of more than 90%. There was no mortality or significant morbidity in this series. We conclude that the extent and distribution of residual epileptogenicity after failed epilepsy surgery are highly variable. 
Immune dysfunction in children after corrective surgery for congenital heart disease. OBJECTIVE: To study the effect of open- and closed-heart surgery on the immune status of infants and children. DESIGN: Prospective study. Data collected before anesthesia and surgery and 2 and 24 hrs after surgery. SETTING: Operating room and pediatric ICU in a children's hospital. PATIENTS: Children undergoing surgery for correction of congenital heart disease (age 3 months to 12 yrs). A total of 31 patients were studied (open-heart surgery, n = 25; closed-heart surgery, n = 6). MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Increased neutrophil counts and lymphopenia were observed after both open- and closed-heart surgery. Serum levels of the complement components C3 and C4 were depressed after open-heart surgery, but not after closed procedures. The percentage of T3+ and T4+ lymphocytes, proliferative responses of the lymphocytes and serum immunoglobulin (Ig)G and IgM were decreased from preoperative levels after open-heart surgery. The percentage of T8+ lymphocytes and serum IgA levels did not change. Intraoperative variables and postoperative severity of illness (Pediatric Risk of Mortality score) did not correlate with immune suppression. CONCLUSIONS: The immune system is affected after pediatric cardiac surgery, particularly after open-heart surgery. 
Hypoprothrombinemia and hemorrhage in a surgical patient treated with cefotetan. For 4 days before surgical repair of a diverticulitic colovesical fistula and for 6 days after, a 63-year-old man was treated with 2 g of intravenous cefotetan disodium every 12 hours for associated urosepsis with bacteremia. Postoperatively, the patient followed a diet of intravenous nutrition only. Uneventful convalescence was interrupted by signs of sudden major blood loss, accompanied by prolonged prothrombin time. After stabilization with packed red blood cells, fresh plasma, crystalloids, and parenteral vitamin K, laparotomy revealed a huge intra-abdominal clot, which was evacuated. This case illustrates the risk of unexpected hypoprothrombinemia and hemorrhage in a cefotetan-treated surgical patient who demonstrated none of the usual comorbid conditions generally described in patients with antibiotic-induced hypoprothrombinemia. Like cefamandole nafate, cefoperazone sodium, moxalactam disodium, and other cephalosporins containing the methylthiotetrazole side chain, cefotetan appears to pose an unusual risk of major bleeding. 
Prolongation of the pharmacologic effect of intrathecal meperidine by the use of a lipid solution of it. The possibility of prolonging the effect of intrathecally injected meperidine by the use of a lipid solution was examined in this study. An aqueous solution of 5% meperidine HCl, 250 micrograms/kg, and an equimolar solution of meperidine dissolved in iophendylate (Pantopaque) were injected subarachnoidally in two groups of rabbits (n = 9 in each) with chronically implanted catheters in the subarachnoid space at the level of L7-8. The effect of each injection was assessed by evaluation of the pain threshold in the animal's hind limbs and of the degree of motor blockade produced. The duration of analgesia and of motor blockade were significantly longer when the lipid solution was used. Six of nine animals that received the aqueous solution of 5% meperidine HCl exhibited temporary signs of agitation (i.e., biting of hind limbs). None of the animals given the lipid solution of the drug did. The findings are attributed to the slow release of meperidine from the lipid phase that serves as a drug depot in the cerebrospinal fluid. The approach presented is suggested as a basis for the development of lipid solutions that might prolong the duration of spinal analgesia produced by a single intrathecal injection. 
Long-term maintenance treatment of reflux esophagitis with omeprazole. Prospective study in patients with H2-blocker-resistant esophagitis. Thirty-four patients with H2-blocker-resistant reflux esophagitis subsequently healed by 40 mg omeprazole daily entered a maintenance study with 20 mg omeprazole. In 31 evaluable cases the observation period was at least 12 months (mean 24 months). Esophagitis remained in remission in two thirds of patients despite dose reduction. Relapses of esophagitis occurred in 10 cases within six months, which rapidly healed by increasing the omeprazole dose to 40 mg. No further recurrence with 20 mg omeprazole was found later than six months. Peptic strictures primarily requiring repeated dilatation in six patients during healing with omeprazole did not reappear while on omeprazole maintenance. Major side effects that could be attributed to omeprazole were not observed. Gastrin levels remained within or slightly above the normal range in the vast majority. It is concluded that omeprazole maintenance treatment in severe reflux esophagitis is an effective and safe therapy. 
Lipid and lipoprotein profiles relate to peak aerobic power in spinal cord injured men. The relationship between peak VO2 and serum lipids, lipoproteins, and apolipoproteins was assessed in nine traumatic spinal cord injured (SCI), active, male volunteers. Mean (SD) age, height, and weight were 30.6 (11.6) yr, 171.1 (11.3) cm, and 74.2 (12.5) kg, respectively. Peak VO2 (X = 2.13 l.min-1) was assessed by a graded arm-crank test to maximum, percent body fat (X = 28.7%) by densitometry, and lipid profile by measures of serum triglycerides, total cholesterol (TC), high and low density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C and LDL-C, respectively), apolipoproteins (apoA-1, apoB), and various ratios of lipids, lipoproteins, and apolipoproteins. Significant inverse relationships emerged between peak VO2 and TC/HDL-C (r = -0.86; P less than 0.01), apoB/apoA-1 (r = -0.75; P less than 0.05), triglycerides (r = -0.73; P less than 0.05), and LDL-C/HDL-C (r = -0.72; P less than 0.05). Direct correlations (P less than 0.05) were demonstrated between peak VO2 and apoA-1/apoB (r = 0.71) and HDL-C/apoA-1 (r = 0.64). The present results indicate that, for active, mid-to-lower thoracic SCI men, the putative atherogenic and antiatherogenic lipid, lipoprotein, and apolipoprotein indices are significantly related to peak VO2 in a manner similar to that described for the able-bodied. These findings indicate the relevance of aerobic fitness assessment in planning CHD prevention strategies for the SCI. 
Potentiating effect of ribavirin on the in vitro and in vivo antiretrovirus activities of 2',3'-dideoxyinosine and 2',3'-dideoxy-2,6-diaminopurine riboside. 2',3'-Dideoxyinosine (DDI) and 2',3'-dideoxy-2,6-diaminopurine riboside (ddDAPR) are potent and selective inhibitors of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) replication in MT-4 cells. They are also inhibitory to the transformation of C3H/3T3 cells by Moloney murine sarcoma virus (MSV). In vivo, they are only marginally effective in delaying MSV-induced tumor formation, and mortality associated therewith in newborn NMRI mice. When combined with ribavirin, DDI and ddDAPR become much more effective in inhibiting MSV and HIV replication in vitro and MSV-induced tumor formation in vivo. These observations point to the potential role of ribavirin in potentiating the anti-HIV activity of DDI in AIDS patients. 
Steroid-induced weakness in patients with primary brain tumors. Clinically significant steroid myopathy (SM) occurred in 23 (10.6%) of 216 adult patients with primary brain tumors who received 2 or more continuous weeks of daily dexamethasone therapy. SM occurred over a wide range of peak and cumulative doses of dexamethasone as well as a wide range of periods of continuous treatment. This was not an entirely random event, however, as two-thirds of the patients developed their weakness during the 9th through the 12th week of continuous dexamethasone treatment. The risk of developing SM was significantly lower in patients taking phenytoin than in patients who were not taking anticonvulsants. The only other patient or treatment factor associated with SM was a possible direct correlation with the appearance of a cushingoid body habitus. In this retrospective review, the occurrence of SM had a significant negative impact on the quality of life of all affected individuals. As expected, patients who tolerated a reduction in their steroid dose improved, while other patients suffered the combined effects of tumor progression and worsening myopathy. Substituting a nonfluorinated glucocorticoid for dexamethasone is probably advisable if neuro-oncology patients affected by SM cannot be weaned from the steroids. 
GABA antagonism reverses hypoxic respiratory depression in the cat. We assessed the role of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) as a potential causative agent of hypoxic respiratory depression by monitoring the response of the phrenic neurogram to systemic infusion of the GABA antagonist bicuculline (0.01 mg.kg-1.min-1) under control conditions and during isocapnic brain hypoxia produced by CO inhalation in separate groups of anesthetized, glomectomized, vagotomized, paralyzed, and ventilated cats with blood pressure held constant. The maximum effect of bicuculline in subseizure doses in control cats was to increase minute phrenic activity to 151 +/- 14% of preinfusion values. Infusion was continued until seizure activity was seen in the electroencephalogram. A 53% decrease of arterial O2 content resulted in a marked reduction of both peak phrenic amplitude and phrenic firing frequency to 16 and 64% of control values, respectively. Infusion of bicuculline while the level of hypoxia was maintained constant restored both peak phrenic amplitude and phrenic firing frequency to prehypoxic levels. The maximum effect of bicuculline was to increase minute phrenic activity to 123 +/- 13% of the prehypoxic value. These results suggest that although GABA has only a modest role in determining the output of the control phrenic neurogram, a significant portion of the phrenic depression that occurs during hypoxia can be attributed to inhibition of respiratory neurons by GABA. 
Factor XI deficiency in Ashkenazi Jews in Israel. BACKGROUND AND METHODS. Severe factor XI deficiency, which is relatively common among Ashkenazi Jews, is associated with injury-related bleeding of considerable severity. Three point mutations--a splice-junction abnormality (Type I), Glu117----Stop (Type II), and Phe283----Leu (Type III)--have been described in six patients with factor XI deficiency. Clinical correlations with these mutations have not been carried out. We determined the relative frequency of the mutations and their association with plasma levels of factor XI clotting activity and bleeding, analyzing the mutations with the polymerase chain reaction and restriction-enzyme digestion. RESULTS. The Type II and Type III mutations had similar frequencies among 43 Ashkenazi Jewish probands with severe factor XI deficiency; these two mutations accounted for 49 percent and 47 percent, respectively, of a total of 86 analyzed alleles. Among 40 of the probands and 12 of their relatives with severe factor XI deficiency, patients homozygous for Type III mutation had a significantly higher level of factor XI clotting activity (mean [+/- SD] percentage of normal values, 9.7 +/- 3.8 percent; n = 13) than those homozygous for Type II mutation (1.2 +/- 0.5 percent, n = 16) or compound heterozygotes with Type II/III mutation (3.3 +/- 1.6 percent, n = 23), as well as significantly fewer episodes of injury-related bleeding. Each of these three groups had a similarly increased proportion of episodes of bleeding complications after surgery at sites with enhanced local fibrinolysis, such as the urinary tract, or during tooth extraction. CONCLUSIONS. Type II and Type III mutations are the predominant causes of factor XI deficiency among Ashkenazi Jews. Genotypic analysis, assay for factor XI, and consideration of the type and location of surgery can be helpful in planning operations in patients with this disorder. 
Unilateral aortofemoral bypass: a safe and effective option for the treatment of unilateral limb-threatening ischemia. To determine whether unilateral aortofemoral (AUF) bypass is a safe and effective option for the treatment of unilateral limb-threatening ischemia in patients with aortic or bilateral iliac occlusive disease, we reviewed the results of 42 AUF bypasses performed using polytetrafluoroethylene grafts in patients operated on for limb salvage; 11 (26%) of the patients also underwent femoropopliteal or femorodistal (FP/D) bypasses. The indications for surgery were tissue necrosis or ulceration in 18 (43%) patients and rest pain in 17 (40%) patients. The 5-year primary graft patency and limb salvage rates for AUF bypass were 74% and 84%, respectively. The perioperative mortality rate was 5%. There were no significant differences in the primary graft patency or limb salvage rates in patients who underwent AUF bypass with or without FP/D bypass. Only 3 of 41 (7%) AUF bypass patients required subsequent femorofemoral bypass. We conclude that: (1) AUF bypass is a safe and effective surgical option in patients with unilateral limb-threatening ischemia and aortic or bilateral iliac occlusive disease; (2) the routine performance of an aortobifemoral or axillobifemoral bypass in patients with unilateral limb-threatening ischemia may be unnecessary; and (3) AUF bypass facilitates the combined inflow and infrainguinal operations that are frequently required for limb salvage in these patients. 
Lithotripsy versus cholecystectomy for management of gallstones. A decision analysis by Markov process. Extracorporeal shock-wave lithotripsy is a new treatment method that effectively distintegrates radiolucent gallstones and is associated with a low complication rate. Using the model of a Markov process for decision analysis, survival and costs under four possible strategies to treat gallstones were compared: expectant management with cholecystectomy (EC) or lithotripsy (EL) reserved for symptomatic gallstones; prophylactic cholecystectomy (PC) or lithotripsy (PL) for all gallstones. Life expectancy for the different strategies varies by few days. Only if high annual rates of pain and complication occurred in subjects with silent gallstones would both prophylactic procedures marginally increase life expectancy. Prophylactic cholecystectomy then would be more cost-effective than prophylactic lithotripsy. Expectant strategies remain much cheaper than prophylactic management over a broad range of probability values and procedural costs. Expectant use of lithotripsy costs less than cholecystectomy. A low success rate of lithotripsy would raise the direct costs of lithotripsy above those of cholecystectomy but leave total costs of both strategies in the same order of magnitude. Lithotripsy appears to be a feasible alternative to treat symptomatic but not asymptomatic gallstones. 
Restricted V gene usage in T-cell lymphomas as detected by anti-T-cell receptor variable region reagents. Monoclonal antibodies reactive with variable regions of the human T-cell receptor (TCR) may be used to detect populations of T lymphocytes with restricted V gene usage. The authors have studied a series of 44 T-cell lymphomas with a panel of seven reagents reactive with four different TCR beta-chain variable region families. The authors found that, with this limited panel, restricted V gene usage of the neoplastic cells could be demonstrated in 29% of TCR-positive lymphomas. Whereas this is somewhat higher than expected, no preferential use of specific families could be demonstrated. An additional, unexpected finding was that most large cell T-cell lymphomas did not express TCR despite the presence of cytoplasmic CD3. The findings indicate that with a somewhat expanded panel it should be feasible to demonstrate restricted V gene usage as an indicator of clonality in a majority of T-cell lymphomas in a manner similar to the application of anti-immunoglobulin subclass antibodies in the diagnosis of clonal B cell proliferations. 
Severe neurologic toxicity induced by cyclosporine A in three renal transplant patients. Cyclosporine A (CyA) is a potent immunosuppressive agent that is used in organ transplantation and in a variety of immunological diseases. It has a variety of adverse side effects, some of which can be serious and even life-threatening. CyA-associated neurotoxicity is generally mild, consisting of fine tremor. However, more complex neurologic abnormalities, including motor spinal cord and cerebellar syndromes, have rarely been described in bone marrow and liver transplant patients. Renal transplant patients have been spared from such CyA-induced toxicity. In this report, three renal transplant patients are described who developed complex and severe neurologic toxicity in the setting of therapeutic blood levels of CyA, which was completely reversible on discontinuation of the drug. No patient had a prior history of neurological or psychiatric dysfunction and there was no evidence of known psychoactive substance abuse. The toxicity was manifested as flaccid hemiparesis in one and dementia in a second patient. The third patient developed a previously unreported Guillain-Barre-like syndrome consisting of an ascending motor neuropathy. One patient developed reversible lesions involving the cerebral white matter. Whereas similar complex neurologic syndromes have been confined to patients who are intensely immunosuppressed, often debilitated, and have toxic levels of the drug, these three patients serve to emphasize that complex neurotoxicity can occur in stable patients who have therapeutic levels of CyA. Given the use of CyA in an ever-expanding list of disease processes, an appreciation of these potential neurologic syndromes is of paramount importance. At present, CyA-induced neurologic disease remains a diagnosis of exclusion. 
Palliation of proximal malignant biliary obstruction by endoscopic endoprosthesis insertion. For four years up to December 1987, 190 patients (median age 73 years) with proximal malignant biliary obstruction were treated by endoscopic endoprosthesis insertion. Altogether 101 had cholangiocarcinoma, 21 gall bladder carcinoma, 20 local spread of pancreatic carcinoma, and 48 metastatic malignancy. Fifty eight patients had type I, 54 type II, and 78 type III proximal biliary strictures (Bismuth classification). All patients were either unfit or unsuitable for an attempt at curative surgical resection. A single endoprosthesis was placed initially, with a further stent being placed only if relief of cholestasis was insufficient or sepsis developed in undrained segments. The combined percutaneous-endoscopic technique was used to place the endoprosthesis when appropriate, after failed endoscopic endoprosthesis insertion or for second endoprosthesis placement. Full follow up was available in 97%.Thirteen patients were still alive at the time of review and all but one had been treated within the past six months. Initial endoprosthesis insertion succeeded technically at the first attempt in 127 patients, at the second in 30, and at a combined procedure in a further 13 (cumulative total success rate 89% - type I: 93%; type II: 94%; and type III: 84%). There was adequate biliary drainage after single endoprosthesis insertion in 152 of the 170 successful placements, giving an overall successful drainage rate of 80%. Three patients had a second stent placed by combined procedure because of insufficient drainage, giving an overall successful drainage rate of 82% (155 of 190). The final overall drainage success rates were type I: 91%; type II: 83%; and type III: 73%. The early complication rates were type I: 7%; type II: 14%; and type III: 31%. 
The role of ultrasound in evaluation of patients with elevated maternal serum alpha-fetoprotein: a review. Accumulated experience with the sonographic detection of spina bifida and its associated fetal cranial changes indicates that nearly all these fetuses may be identified by ultrasound examination alone. A review of data from multiple centers shows that a complete and detailed, normal ultrasound is an appropriate basis for a reduction of at least 95% in the maternal serum alpha-fetoprotein (MSAFP)-based risk for neural tube defects. The use of this adjusted risk in patient counseling before amniocentesis may lower the rate of the procedure with no significant loss of diagnostic sensitivity. Among patients with elevated MSAFP, the rate of abnormal cytogenetic findings in fetuses with no abnormalities detected at ultrasound appears to be near 0.61%. Furthermore, the spectrum of abnormal cytogenetic results appears to differ from that associated with increased maternal age, in that the incidence of sex chromosome abnormalities is higher and that of Down syndrome is lower. 
Metabolic aspects of protection by glycine against hypoxic injury to isolated proximal tubules. To clarify the roles of butyrate and acylglycine formation in hypoxic proximal tubule cell injury and protection by glycine and to test the contribution of iodoacetate-suppressible metabolism to protection, (1) it was determined whether protection by glycine is fully expressed when glucose, lactate, alanine, and butyrate are replaced by alpha-ketoglutarate as the sole substrate for the tubules, (2) butyrate metabolism and acylglycine formation were directly measured in control and hypoxic preparations, and (3) it was assessed whether injury produced by iodoacetate, a potent inhibitor of glycolytic metabolism, is subject to protection by glycine. Susceptibility to hypoxic injury in medium with alpha-ketoglutarate as the sole substrate was similar to that seen in medium containing glucose, lactate, alanine, and butyrate. Tubules in alpha-ketoglutarate medium showed high degrees of protection by glycine against injury produced by 30-min of hypoxia, by iodoacetate alone, and by iodoacetate combined with hypoxia. Protection did not require preservation of cell ATP or glutathione. In glucose-lactate-alanine-butyrate medium, butyrate, measured by gas chromatography, was rapidly metabolized by oxygenated tubules and fully accounted for basal rates of oxygen consumption. Butyrate utilization stopped during hypoxia. Neither aspect of butyrate metabolism was altered by glycine. Formation of acylglycines was assessed by gas chromatography/mass spectroscopy. In preparations treated with glycine, butyrylglycine was detected under both oxygenated and hypoxic conditions; the quantities, however, were small and no other acylglycines were found. These observations indicate that protective effects of glycine are independent of short-chain acylglycine formation and glycolytic metabolism. 
Clostridial mycotic aneurysm of the suprarenal abdominal aorta. Clostridial mycotic aneurysms are unusual. We therefore record a fatal case of a ruptured clostridial mycotic aneurysm of the suprarenal aorta which developed several weeks after the resection of a segment of gangrenous small bowel. 
Low serum levels of alpha-interferon, gamma-interferon, and interleukin-2 in alcoholic cirrhosis. The existence of cellular immune deficit in alcoholic cirrhosis, together with the role of alpha- and gamma-interferon and interleukin-2 in the immune system, led us to compare serum levels of these immune system mediators in a group of 40 patients with alcoholic cirrhosis classified according to Child-Pugh's grade of severity of liver disease and 23 healthy volunteers. Serum levels of alpha-IFN, gamma-IFN, and IL-2 were significantly depressed in alcoholic cirrhotics, with no significant differences between the different degrees of hepatic damage. The results suggest a profound alteration in the immune system of alcoholic cirrhotics, which may contribute to the development of the disease and the accompanying immune system deficit. 
Antithrombotic therapy for deep arterial injury by angioplasty. Efficacy of common platelet inhibition compared with thrombin inhibition in pigs. BACKGROUND. Platelet-thrombus formation is a complication of arterial wall deep injury by balloon angioplasty that may lead to acute arterial occlusion and may contribute to restenosis. METHODS AND RESULTS. Because common platelet-inhibitor drugs with a heparin bolus (100 units/kg) may be effective in inhibiting platelet-thrombus formation after arterial angioplasty, these were compared with a bolus of heparin alone (control), the specific thrombin inhibitor hirudin (1.0 mg/kg), and saline (hirudin control) in normal pigs after angioplasty of the common carotid arteries. In the presence of deep arterial wall injury (injury exposing the media), indium-111-labeled platelet deposition (x 10(6)/cm2) was 68.8 +/- 12.3 and 48.1 +/- 16.9 in the control animals. This was significantly reduced by pretreatment with low-dose aspirin (1 mg/kg/day), by high-dose aspirin (20 mg/kg/day) plus dipyridamole, and especially by thrombin inhibition with hirudin. Treatment regimens with aspirin alone (20 mg/kg/day), dipyridamole alone, or sulfinpyrazone were ineffective. Likewise, the incidence of mural thrombosis was 75% and 80% in deeply injured arteries of controls and was significantly reduced to 46% with aspirin plus dipyridamole, 25% with low-dose aspirin, and 0% with hirudin. The incidence of mural thrombosis was unchanged with high-dose aspirin (69%), dipyridamole (90%), or sulfinpyrazone (92%). This mural thrombosis could not be identified by angiography. In the presence of mild injury (deendothelialization), platelet deposition was low (less than 10 x 10(6)/cm2, a single layer) and was not changed by any therapy, including hirudin. CONCLUSIONS. These therapies do not affect platelet adhesion to deeply or mildly injured artery. These data suggest a greater role for thrombin inhibition than with thromboxane or cyclooxygenase inhibition in the pathogenesis of platelet-rich mural thrombosis after deep injury during angioplasty. Antithrombotic therapy for arterial thrombosis by thrombin inhibition appears promising. 
Dual effects of N-ethylmaleimide on ethanol-induced gastric lesions in rats. The effects of N-ethylmaleimide (NEM), a sulfhydryl (SH) blocker, on ethanol-induced gastric lesions were investigated in rats by varying the route of administration. Oral administration of acidified ethanol (60% ethanol in 150 mM HCl, 1 ml) produced hemorrhagic bandlike lesions in the gastric mucosa. Pretreatment of the animals with orally administered NEM (0.1-10 mg/kg) dose-dependently inhibited these lesions (the inhibition was over 80% at 1 mg/kg or greater), and the effects were partially reversed by indomethacin (5 mg/kg, subcutaneous). However, when NEM (10 mg/kg) was given subcutaneously, this agent significantly worsened the lesions. Intragastrically applied NEM produced a dose-dependent reduction of the transmucosal potential difference (PD) and the mucosal nonprotein SH levels, an increase of the volume of gastric contents, and an inhibition of gastric motility, while these parameters remained unaltered after subcutaneous administration of the agent. The microvascular permeability in the mucosa was significantly increased by both oral and subcutaneous administration of NEM (10 mg/kg) but remained unchanged in response to lower doses of orally administered (less than 3 mg/kg). These results suggest that NEM given orally is cytoprotective to the stomach against ethanol, probably by acting as a mild irritant and due to dilution of an irritant and inhibition of gastric motility (muscle relaxation), but when given subcutaneously it aggravates the lesions by unknown mechanisms. 
Salmonella meningitis and infection with HIV. Patients infected with HIV demonstrate increased susceptibility to serious infections with non-typhoidal salmonellae. However, no cases of salmonella meningitis have been reported in this population. We now report three cases of salmonella meningitis which occurred in a population of 1800 patients with AIDS or AIDS-related complex at our hospitals. The incidence of meningitis complicating salmonella infection in our HIV-infected population appears to be much higher than that reported in non-AIDS patients (7.5 versus 0.15%). All had cerebrospinal fluid parameters consistent with bacterial meningitis, and two of three revealed organisms on cerebrospinal fluid Gram stain. Two presented with a fulminant illness and died despite therapy; the third developed a brain abscess associated with a relapse of meningitis. Salmonella meningitis should be considered as a cause of acute neurological deterioration in patients at risk for HIV-related disease. Relapses may occur, and mortality is high. 
Early and late geometric changes after carotid endarterectomy patch reconstruction. This study examines the degree and location of vessel wall geometric changes after carotid endarterectomy-vein patch reconstruction. The external diameters of the proximal common carotid, common carotid bulb, and internal carotid arteries were measured during operation with a caliper after 349 carotid endarterectomies. There were 309 saphenous vein reconstructions, 31 synthetic patch reconstructions, and 9 primary closures. One or more B-mode ultrasound studies with cross-sectional views for common and internal carotid cursor measurements were performed from 3 months to 5 years after operation. The intraoperative-to-postoperative common carotid diameters were unchanged for the three types of reconstructions. The internal carotid diameters increased 20% to 30% for both the vein and synthetic patched arteries. This dilation was present at 3 and 6 months and progressed slightly over 5 years. Wall thickening greater than or equal to 1 mm was present in 62% of the carotid endarterectomies, with concentric stenosis in 3% and eccentric stenosis in 59%. Eccentric stenosis was present at 3 to 6 months, located on the endarterectomized posterior-medial wall of the common and internal carotid arteries, was always less than 50%, and changed very little over 5 years. No aneurysms or internal carotid occlusions were identified. Carotid endarterectomy-vein patch reconstruction results in early, mild, nonaneurysmal dilation of the internal carotid patched segment, frequent mild eccentric restenosis, and rare hemodynamically significant concentric restenosis. 
Gastroesophageal reflux in the older child: presentation, response to treatment and long-term follow-up. Much attention has been focused on the natural history of gastroesophageal reflux (GER) in neurologically normal infants which generally resolves by two years of age. In contrast, little is known of the outcome of GER diagnosed in normal older children. The charts of 32 children (21 males) without neurologic or esophageal anatomic abnormalities, age 3.5 to 16 years (mean = 9.8) at the time of diagnosis, were reviewed. Diagnosis was based on suggestive presenting symptoms and evaluation of prolonged intraesophageal pH monitoring. Esophagitis was diagnosed by histologic criteria in 16 of the 32 patients. Medical treatment consisted of prokinetic agents (metoclopramide, bethanechol) and H2-receptor antagonists. After a one to eight year follow-up period (mean +/- SD - 3.4 +/- 2.1), the symptoms in 13 children had resolved or were sufficiently improved to discontinue medication. In 13 patients, symptoms were improved but medication was required for adequate control. Four children were symptomatic without improvement in spite of medical therapy and two others required fundoplication for continued severe symptoms and refractory esophagitis. In summary, less than 50% of otherwise normal older children with GER undergo spontaneous resolution of marked improvement in symptoms and the remainder require continued long-term medical and/or surgical management. 
Neurofibrillary tangles in dementia pugilistica are ubiquitinated. Ubiquitin, a protein thought to be involved in the ATP-dependent non-lysosomal degradation of abnormal proteins, has already been identified as a component of neurofibrillary tangles in Alzheimer's disease. We have examined ubiquitin immunoreactivity in a unique collection of brains from 16 ex-boxers including 11 with dementia pugilistica. Neurofibrillary tangles of dementia pugilistica were labelled with an affinity purified antiserum to ubiquitin, and BF10, a monoclonal antibody to a neurofilament epitope. 
Information and referral service usage among caregivers for dementia patients. Questionnaires were mailed to 257 callers of a toll-free telephone "helpline" specializing in Alzheimer's disease and related dementing illnesses; 125 (48.6%) were completed and returned. On the average, 3.94 requests for information were made per call. The most common requests concerned services delivered to the home, general information about dementia, information about adult day care, and support group information. Results indicated that a telephone-based information and referral helpline is useful in disseminating knowledge about resources to caregivers of older community-residing adults with cognitive impairment. 
Effect of intrathoracic pressure on plasma arginine vasopressin levels. Abdominal distention during pneumoperitoneum results in a marked increase in plasma arginine vasopressin levels, which has been ascribed to an increase in intrathoracic pressure. Because of this relationship, tense ascites could contribute to nonosmotic release of antidiuretic hormone, to the development of hyponatremia, and eventually to further ascites formation. The effect of pneumoperitoneum, thoracocentesis, and paracentesis on plasma arginine vasopressin levels was studied in three groups of patients, and the mechanism by which these maneuvers may induce these changes was investigated. Patients with pleural effusion, pneumothorax, or ascites showed a significant increase in plasma arginine vasopressin levels, and thoracocentesis or paracentesis resulted in a decrease in these levels. Plasma vasopressin levels increased significantly during pneumoperitoneum, as did intrathoracic and atrial pressures; the atrial transmural pressure gradient declined. However, no changes in plasma levels of norepinephrine, aldosterone, and renin activity were observed during pneumoperitoneum. Changes in plasma arginine vasopressin levels correlated with the changes in intrathoracic and atrial pressures and transmural pressure gradient. The authors conclude that increased intrathoracic pressure is associated with an increase in plasma arginine vasopressin levels and propose that ascites could be a factor promoting vasopressin release by acting on intrathoracic volume receptors in decompensated cirrhotics. 
Pyoderma gangrenosum associated with systemic lupus erythematosus: response to pulse steroid therapy. Pyoderma gangrenosum in a 35-year-old woman with long-standing systemic lupus erythematosus was treated with pulse steroid therapy. Significant improvement in the ulceration and control of the lupus erythematosus occurred. The unusual association of these disorders is reviewed, and the efficacy of pulse therapy in the treatment of refractory cases of pyoderma gangrenosum is discussed. 
Magnetic resonance imaging signs of optic nerve gliomas in neurofibromatosis 1. We reviewed the magnetic resonance images of four children with neurofibromatosis 1 and orbital optic gliomas. The images showed double-intensity tubular thickening characteristic of perineural arachnoidal gliomatosis, elongation of the nerves, and downward kinking of the nerves in the midorbit. We believe these findings typify the orbital gliomas in patients with this disease. 
Importance of histologic condition and treatment of pediatric cerebellar astrocytoma. Histologic classification and treatment of pediatric cerebellar astrocytomas is an area of controversy. At the Medical College of Wisconsin, 34 patients less than 15 years of age (median, 7.3 years of age) with cerebellar astrocytomas were seen from 1965 to 1988. Effect of histologic condition and treatment on overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS) was analyzed. Progression was defined as radiographic evidence of an enlarging mass and/or signs and symptoms indicative of advancing disease. Histologic material was reviewed and classified by the system of Winston and Gilles. Twenty-eight patients had glioma A tumors, and six patients had glioma B tumors. For patients with glioma A (n = 28), 5-year actuarial OS rate was 100%. For patients with glioma B (n = 6), 5-year actuarial OS rate was 41%. PFS rate was 66% and 0% for patients with glioma A and glioma B, respectively. The poorer PFS for patients with B histologic tumors was statistically significant (P less than 0.001). The median time to progression was 36 months and 23 months for patients with glioma A and B, respectively. Patients were retrospectively divided into total resection and observation, total resection and irradiation, subtotal resection and observation, and subtotal resection and irradiation groups, which were composed of 12, 2, 3, and 17 patients, respectively. Five-year actuarial OS rates were 100%, 50%, 50%, and 100%, respectively. PFS rates were 60%, 50%, 33% and 58%, respectively. These data support the Gilles classification as a prognostic tool because patients with B tumors had a higher incidence of disease progression and accounted for all deaths. Postoperative irradiation after subtotal resection seems to be beneficial, but additional investigation, ideally with a prospective randomized trial, will be necessary to firmly establish this. 
One gram of aspirin per day does not reduce risk of hospitalization for gallstone disease. Data from 4524 patients in a randomized, controlled trial of aspirin were analyzed to determine if aspirin reduced the risk for hospitalization for gallstone disease. Aspirin at a dose of 1000 mg/day did not reduce the risk of hospitalization for gallstones. Hospitalization rates for gallstone disease were consistent with national rates, and the data confirmed previous associations of gallstone disease with age, elevated serum triglycerides, obesity, and female gender. 
Retrograde coronary venous administration of recombinant tissue-type plasminogen activator: a unique and effective approach to coronary artery thrombolysis. Recent studies of interventional therapy by way of the coronary venous system have demonstrated that it can protect acutely ischemic myocardium. To evaluate the efficacy of coronary venous retroinfusion compared with systemic intravenous administration of recombinant tissue-type plasminogen activator (rt-PA), 14 dogs were studied with a copper coil-induced thrombus in the left anterior descending coronary artery. The rt-PA (24,000 fluorescence units/kg) was administered continuously, either intravenously (n = 8) or retrogradely (n = 6), for 30 min beginning 60 min after coronary occlusion. Thrombolysis was determined by repetitive coronary angiography. All dogs were killed 3 h after termination of rt-PA infusion and infarct size was measured by the triphenyltetrazolium chloride staining technique. Complete thrombolysis occurred in five of the six dogs in the retroinfusion group and four of the eight dogs in the systemic intravenous infusion group. Partial lysis was achieved in two dogs treated by intravenous infusion. Lysis did not occur in one dog treated with retroinfusion and in two dogs treated with intravenous infusion. Time to thrombolysis was 13.4 +/- 2.3 min in the retroinfusion group versus 27.8 +/- 4.8 min in the intravenous group (p less than 0.001). Myocardial functional recovery in the ischemic zone measured by two-dimensional echocardiography 60 min after reperfusion was significant only in the retroinfusion group (p less than 0.05). 
Conventional versus thrombolytic therapy in spontaneous (effort) axillary-subclavian vein thrombosis. Effort axillary-subclavian vein thrombosis in young patients has produced long-term disability because of the failure of the thrombosed vein to recanalize. Ten consecutive patients treated in our institution were analyzed. All patients were diagnosed by venography. Four patients received thrombolytic therapy. Three of these had complete resolution and one had partial resolution of the symptoms and thrombus, that was confirmed by venography and duplex imaging. The remaining six patients were treated with conventional anticoagulant therapy. Three of these patients had no resolution, one had complete resolution of both symptoms and thrombus, and two had only partial resolution of symptoms but no resolution of thrombus. Thrombolytic therapy appears to be superior to anticoagulation in the dissolution of symptoms in effort vein thrombosis and should be considered in its management if the diagnosis is made early. 
Multidrug resistance (mdr1) gene expression in adult acute leukemias: correlations with treatment outcome and in vitro drug sensitivity. Resistance to multiple chemotherapeutic agents has been related to the production of P-glycoprotein, a trans-membrane drug efflux pump that is encoded by the multidrug resistance (MDR) gene mdr1. To investigate whether mdr1 could be involved in clinical resistance to chemotherapy in acute leukemias, we have analyzed retrospectively the RNA from adult acute leukemia cells by slot-blot hybridization with a human mdr1 probe. Units of mdr1 expression were defined by reference to drug-sensitive human sarcoma and K562 leukemia cell lines (1 U) and the highly resistant doxorubicin selected leukemia cells K562/R7 (50 U). We studied 41 adult patients with acute leukemias: 5 acute lymphoblastic leukemias, 23 acute myeloid leukemias, and 13 secondary leukemias or blast crisis of chronic myelogenous leukemia. Expression of 10 U or more of mdr1 was found in 6 of 31 (19%) leukemias at diagnosis, versus 5 of 10 (50%) after relapse from therapy, P = .06. The complete remission rate and in vitro sensitivity to daunorubicin were both correlated with low expression (1 U, v 2 U or more) of mdr1. Among 36 evaluable attempts to induce remission, the complete remission rate was 67% (8 of 12) for patients with undetectable or minimal mdr1 expression (1 U), versus 29% (7 of 24) in patients with 2 U or more of expression, P = .03. In vitro resistance to daunorubicin or other MDR-related drugs was associated with expression of 2 U or more of mdr1 in 11 of 11 cases, while specimens that were sensitive to these agents were negative for mdr1 expression in 5 of 11 cases, P = .03. These data suggest that mdr1 expression contributes to chemoresistance in acute leukemia. Determination of mdr1 gene expression may be useful in designing therapy for patients with leukemia. 
Reduction of central nervous system ischemic injury by monoclonal antibody to intercellular adhesion molecule. Activated leukocytes appear to be directly involved in potentiating ischemic central nervous system (CNS) injury. Adhesion of leukocytes to endothelium is essential for their migration and requires the binding of adhesion receptors of the leukocyte (CD 18) to an intercellular adhesion molecule (ICAM) on endothelium. Monoclonal antibodies to an ICAM can block leukocyte adhesion and transendothelial migration. To determine the efficacy of anti-ICAM antibody treatment in preserving neurological function after CNS ischemia, two animal models were used. A 1-mg/kg dose of anti-ICAM was given to rabbits 30 minutes before induction of ischemia either in the spinal cord using temporary aortic occlusion or in the brain using intra-arterial microspheres. In this study, treatment with anti-ICAM produced a significant reduction in neurological deficits in the reversible spinal cord ischemia model but not in the irreversible brain ischemia model. This protective effect supports the active role of leukocytes in CNS reperfusion ischemic injury and offers potential for future therapy. 
Extraperitoneal approach for repair of inflammatory abdominal aortic aneurysm. Inflammatory abdominal aortic aneurysms are characterized by dense perianeurysmal fibrosis involving the adjacent organs. Attempts to isolate the aneurysm can lead to operative injuries of these structures, thus increasing the rates of complications and mortality. In the last 12 years 45 patients with inflammatory abdominal aortic aneurysms underwent aneurysm resection at the Department of Vascular Surgery of the University of Rome. The aneurysm was resected through a standard, midline transperitoneal approach in 39 patients, through a thoracophrenolaparotomy in two patients, and through a left-flank extraperitoneal approach in the last four patients. The extraperitoneal approach simplified aneurysm dissection and aortic clamping with no cases of postoperative morbidity or death. In addition, we reviewed the CT scan findings of 12 patients surgically treated for inflammatory abdominal aortic aneurysm. The amount of fibrosis in the anterior wall of the aneurysm was greater than in the left posterolateral aspect (p = 0.008). We conclude that the left-flank extraperitoneal approach is the most anatomically advantageous route for repair of inflammatory abdominal aortic aneurysm. 
Renal colic. Utility of the plain abdominal roentgenogram. We conducted a retrospective cohort study of 85 consecutive symptomatic patients to evaluate the sensitivity, specificity, and predictive value of plain abdominal roentgenography (PAR) compared with clinical evaluation alone in diagnosis and treatment of renal colic. With a positive intravenous pyelogram and/or actual stone retrieval used as the gold standard, 72 patients had documented stones. The calculated sensitivity and specificity for PAR were 58% (95% confidence interval, 47% to 69%) and 69% (95% confidence interval, 44% to 94%), respectively. In this population with a stone prevalence of 85%, the positive predictive value of PAR was 91%. A clinical scoring system based on signs and symptoms fared as well as PAR (sensitivity, 73%; specificity, 46%; and positive predictive value, 88%). The strategy of clinical scoring followed by selective use of intravenous pyelography was more cost-effective than strategies using PAR. We conclude that the PAR has low sensitivity and specificity and improves the predictive value only marginally, and its routine use is not cost-effective. 
Rapidly progressive acute retinal necrosis secondary to herpes simplex virus, type 1. A systemically healthy 22-year-old man presented with unilateral acute retinal necrosis (ARN) that featured diffuse retinal whitening throughout the posterior retina, exudative retinal detachment, and a visual acuity of no light perception. Diagnostic vitrectomy revealed necrotic retinal cells containing intranuclear inclusions visible with light microscopy. On electron microscopy, viral particles consistent with a herpes family virus were detected. Culture of the vitrectomy specimen showed herpes simplex, type 1 (HSV 1) and rising convalescent serum ELISA titers to HSV 1 confirmed a recent infection. This case of ARN is unusual for its severity, early macular involvement, and development of exudative retinal detachment. In addition, it represents one of the few reported cases in which HSV 1 has been confirmed by both vitreous culture and serum titers as the etiologic agent. A review of the literature suggests that posterior segment inflammatory conditions secondary to HSV 1 can be associated with exudative retinal detachment, a clinical finding that may help differentiate such conditions from other infectious causes of chorioretinitis. 
Hemorrhage and intracranial hypertension in combination increase cerebral production of thromboxane A2. BACKGROUND AND METHODS: To determine the effects of reduced cerebral perfusion pressures produced by hemorrhage alone or in combination with intracranial hypertension on thromboxane A2 (TxA2) production, we undertook a randomized study in 38 anesthetized, mongrel dogs. Animals were subjected to 30 mins of hemorrhagic shock with normal (group 1) or increased (group 2) intracranial pressure (ICP). Group 1 animals (n = 22) were hemorrhaged to reduce cerebral perfusion pressure to 40 mm Hg for 30 mins. In group 2 (n = 16), cerebral perfusion pressure was reduced by the combination of less severe hypotension and intracranial hypertension (20 mm Hg). Cerebral and systemic hemodynamic measurements were recorded, including cerebral blood flow (sagittal sinus outflow method); ICP; cerebral perfusion pressure; and arterial and cerebral venous concentrations of TxB2 (double-antibody radioimmunoassay technique), the major metabolite of TxA2. Data were obtained at baseline and at the beginning and end of the 30-min shock period. RESULTS: Hemorrhagic shock significantly (p less than .05) decreased cerebral blood flow in both groups. At the beginning of the shock period, cerebral blood flow was higher in group 1 than in group 2 (p less than .05) and venous-arterial differences in TxB2 increased significantly (p less than .05) in group 2, but not in group 1. At the end of the 30-min shock period, venous-arterial levels of TxB2 remained significantly (p less than .05) higher in group 2. CONCLUSIONS: Increased cerebral production of TxA2 during hypotension accompanied by intracranial hypertension may contribute to the severity of neural damage produced by the combination of head trauma and shock. 
Choleriform syndrome and production of labile enterotoxin (CT/LT1)-like antigen by species of Salmonella infantis and Salmonella haardt isolated from the same patient. Isolates of Salmonella infantis from the stool and blood and an isolate of Salmonella haardt from the stool of a patient with choleriform diarrhea produced labile enterotoxin (CT/LT1)-like antigen. Genetic and molecular experiments indicated that the production of CT/LT1-like antigen was chromosomally encoded. 
A case of chronic GM1 gangliosidosis presenting as dystonia: clinical and biochemical studies. Clinical and biochemical studies are reported on a 32-year-old man with GM1 gangliosidosis who presented with a slowly progressive dystonia that began when he was aged 7 years and eventually became almost totally incapacitating at the age of 35. There was only mild intellectual deterioration, but myoclonus, seizures and macular cherry-red spots were never observed. Proton-density and T2-weighted MRI scans showed symmetrical hyperintense lesions of both putamina. No increase of GM1 ganglioside was found in plasma or cerebrospinal fluid, and the metabolism of GM1 ganglioside in cultured skin fibroblasts from the patient was also almost normal, although the residual activity of GM1 ganglioside beta-galactosidase activity was only 10% of normal. These findings suggest that impaired GM1 ganglioside metabolism is not present systemically as it is in the infantile and juvenile types of the disorder, but is mainly confined to the central nervous system in chronic GM1 gangliosidosis. 
Eosinophil activation on biologic surfaces. Production of O2- in response to physiologic soluble stimuli is differentially modulated by extracellular matrix components and endothelial cells. Production of O2- in response to FMLP, TNF, IFN-gamma, platelet activating factor, LPS, substance P, and PMA by human eosinophils in suspension and in contact with polystyrene ELISA plastic (PL) or biologic surfaces was studied. Monolayers of human endothelial cells (HEC) or PL coated with FCS, fibronectin, laminin, collagen types I and IV, fibrinogen, or fibrin were used as biologic surfaces. Only PMA and FMLP stimulated O2- generation by eosinophils in suspension. Eosinophils residing on HEC monolayers, either untreated or treated with LPS, were unresponsive to all stimuli except PMA. PMA induced O2- generation by eosinophils on all surfaces; FMLP on all surfaces but HEC monolayers; TNF and platelet-activating factor only on PL, fibrinogen, and fibrin; LPS and substance P only on PL. PMA was equally effective on eosinophils on surfaces and in suspension, whereas the effect of FMLP was greater on eosinophils on surfaces than on eosinophils in suspension. IFN-gamma was ineffective on any of the surfaces tested. These results indicate that biologic surfaces may profoundly affect the ability of eosinophils to respond with a respiratory burst to physiologically relevant soluble stimuli, the effect varying according to the nature of both the stimulus and the surface. Since the respiratory burst generates products of oxygen reduction that are toxic to several tissue components, it follows that biologic surfaces may modulate eosinophil-induced tissue injury. 
Exacerbation of partial seizures and onset of nonepileptic myoclonus with carbamazepine. A child had two to three generalized tonic-clonic (GTC) seizures per week unresponsive to phenobarbital (PB) and valproate (VPA). Interictal EEG demonstrated left occipital spikes. When carbamazepine (CBZ) therapy was started, he developed very frequent (4-6/day) complex partial seizures (CPS) characterized on ictal EEG by focal right temporal lobe discharges. The seizure exacerbation, which was associated with development of nonepileptic, multifocal myoclonus, resolved 24 h after CBZ was discontinued. The exacerbation occurred with therapeutic CBZ serum levels, but may have been related to the toxic levels of carbamazepine-10, 11-epoxide (CBZE). 
Immunohistochemical evidence of immune responses to tumor-associated antigens in lymph nodes of colon carcinoma patients. The authors investigated by immunohistochemical study the drainage of three tumor-associated antigens in unaffected regional lymph nodes of colon cancer patients. The study was conducted using monoclonal antibodies (MoAb) directed against different epitopes of the tumor-associated glycoprotein, TAG-72 (CC-49, CC-83, B72.3), of the carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) (COL-4, COL-12), and of the colon-associated antigen, CAA (anti-CAA). The authors detected immunohistochemical reactions of MoAb CC-49 and anti-CAA with antigen-presenting cells (APC), such as peritumoral and sinus macrophages and lymphatic endothelial cells and with specific areas of germinal centers in lymph nodes draining 11 of 24 colorectal carcinomas studied. The corresponding primary tumors expressed the TAG-72 and CAA antigens. No immunostaining was detectable in lymph nodes using the anti-CEA MoAb, even when the primary tumors strongly expressed the specific epitopes. In germinal centers of regional lymph nodes, the immunostaining was often distributed at the periphery with a characteristic crescentic or circular pattern, which strongly suggested the exposure of the specific epitopes defined by MoAb CC-49 and anti-CAA on follicular dendritic cells. This would indicate that these epitopes are selectively recognized and presented to germinal center B-cells. This phenomenon may have clinical and diagnostic implications. 
Effects of immediate postoperative enteral nutrition on body composition, muscle function, and wound healing. Thirty-two patients undergoing bowel resection were randomized to receive either immediate postoperative nasojejunal feeding with full strength Osmolite solution for 56 hours (n = 16) or routine postoperative hypocaloric fluids and gradual reintroduction of diet (n = 16). Body composition changes were measured at 14 days after operation with in vivo neutron activation analysis, the wound healing response by subcutaneous implantation of Gortex tubes, and muscle function by grip strength, maximum ventilatory volume, and stimulation of the ulnar nerve at the wrist. Postoperative fatigue up to 3 months after operation was assessed using a 10-point analogue. Successful immediate enteral nutrition was established in 12 of the 16 patients. Enterally fed patients had a mean daily caloric intake of 1179 +/- 388 kcal/d (mean +/- SD) over the first 4 postoperative days compared with 382 +/- 71 kcal/d for the controls (p less than 0.0001). The amount of hydroxyproline accumulating in the Gortex tubes was also significantly greater (2.5 +/- 1.1 nmol/g tube vs 1.5 +/- 0.8 nmol/g tube; p less than 0.02). However, the amount and composition of the weight lost was not significantly different. Muscle function was not preserved, and postoperative fatigue occurred to an equal extent in both groups. Complications were similar in both groups, except for a preponderance of bowel obstructions in the controls. The time to passage of first flatus and first bowel motion, although shorter in the fed group, did not reach significance (p = 0.07). We conclude that immediate enteral nutrition is feasible and results in an improved wound healing response. 
A double-blind study of the speed of onset of analgesia following intramuscular administration of ketorolac tromethamine in comparison to intramuscular morphine and placebo. A double-blind, randomised, parallel group, placebo-controlled study was performed in 85 patients to compare the speed of onset of analgesia following the intramuscular administration of a single dose of 30 mg of ketorolac tromethamine, 10 mg of morphine or placebo. A new, sensitive, method was used to measure the latency of analgesia. The onset of analgesia was defined by the time taken for the pain intensity score to reach a specified percentage of the baseline value. Twenty-five percent of patients achieving a 50% reduction in baseline pain intensity score appears to be the most appropriate parameter to assess the speed of onset of analgesia of ketorolac and morphine in the postoperative setting. Paired comparison demonstrated that ketorolac had a significantly faster onset of analgesia (p = 0.03) when compared to placebo, whilst comparison of morphine to placebo analgesic latency (p = 0.06) just failed to reach significance. There was no significant difference between the analgesic onset time of ketorolac and morphine (p = 0.73). Intramuscular ketorolac and intramuscular morphine have comparable analgesic onset times in the postoperative pain context. However, the sensitive method of measuring onset of analgesia described, highlights the slow onset of analgesia when analgesics of known efficacy are given by the intramuscular route in the postoperative period. More attention should be given to the speed of onset of analgesia in future assessments of analgesics. 
Intensive chemotherapy induction followed by interferon-alpha maintenance in patients with Philadelphia chromosome-positive chronic myelogenous leukemia. In a pilot study, 32 patients with Philadelphia chromosome-positive chronic myelogenous leukemia were treated with intensive chemotherapy induction followed by interferon-alpha (IFN-A) maintenance. Intensive chemotherapy consisted of three cycles of daunorubicin 120 mg/m2 on day 1, cytarabine 80 mg/m2 daily for 10 days, vincristine 2 mg on day 1, and prednisone 100 mg daily for 5 days (DOAP). Maintenance therapy with IFN-A at a doses of 3 x 10(6) to 5 x 10(6) units/m2 daily was adjusted according to counts and toxicity. The outcome of patients was compared with a matched historic population of 64 patients treated with IFN-A alone. Overall, 60% of patients had a cytogenetic response (partial or complete) with induction chemotherapy, but only eight (25%) had a sustained cytogenetic response with IFN-A maintenance. After a median follow-up of 67 months, the 6-year survival rate of the 32 patients was 58%, compared with 36% for the matched historic group (P = 0.084). The incidence of lymphoid blastic transformation in the two groups was 25% and 48%, respectively (P = 0.10) and durable cytogenetic responses, 25% and 19%, respectively (P = 0.48). In summary, the addition of intensive chemotherapy induction to IFN-A maintenance does not improve the survival rate, incidence of lymphoid blastic transformation, or incidence of durable cytogenetic response compared with the results achieved with IFN-A therapy alone. 
Hepatitis B and human immunodeficiency virus infection in street youths in Toronto, Canada. Hepatitis B and human immunodeficiency virus are transmitted by venereal contact or by the sharing of used needles during drug use. A questionnaire was administered to street youths admitting to prostitution and to a group denying prostitution, as well as to sexually active adolescents who lived with their family and were attending an adolescent medical clinic. The age, gender, race, number of sexual partners, condom use, illicit drug use, anal intercourse and admission to prostitution were recorded for each of the subjects. Serology was obtained for hepatitis B markers and human immunodeficiency virus antibody. Multiple regression analysis was performed to determine the factors which might predict hepatitis B serologic status. A single subject, who admitted to prostitution, was found to be human immunodeficiency virus-seropositive. Seven of 43 (16%) admitted prostitutes compared with 1 of 44 (2%) other street youth and none of 27 controls demonstrated anti-hepatitis B surface antibodies. The higher rate of seropositivity in admitted prostitutes was statistically significant (P less than 0.0097). Two seropositive prostitutes had IgM hepatitis B core antibody suggesting recent infection. Two factors, number of partners (P less than 0.0007) and practice of anal intercourse (P less than 0.05), were identified in the multiple regression analysis as predictive of seropositivity. Thus adolescents who live on the street are at increased risk for becoming infected with hepatitis B virus. The difficulty in ensuring vaccine coverage in this population would support calls for including hepatitis B vaccination as part of childhood immunization. 
A population-based study of ocular abnormalities in premature children aged 5 to 10 years. We studied the prevalence of ocular abnormalities in 528 children born prematurely (less than 1,501-g birth weight, less than 33 weeks' gestational age, or both) in Stockholm County from 1976 to 1981. The control group consisted of 1,047 randomly selected full-term children. Through various searches of the ophthalmic records from the period of 1981 to 1986 of Stockholm County, we found that 134 of the 528 premature children (25.4%) and 121 of the 1,047 full-term children (11.5%) had needed ophthalmic care for different reasons. The prevalence of ocular abnormalities was much higher in premature children than in full-term children: reduced visual acuity of 20/33 or worse in the best eye (21 of 528 [4.0%] and one of 1,047 [0.1%]); myopia (33 of 528 [6.3%] and 18 of 1,047 [1.8%]); anisometropia of 1 diopter or greater (31 of 528 [5.9%] and 15 of 1,047 [1.5%]); strabismus (52 of 528 [9.9%] and 22 of 1,047 [2.1%]); and nystagmus (13 of 528 [2.4%] and one of 1,047 [0.1%]). Children with birth weight less than 1,000 g had the highest rates of ocular abnormalities. We conclude that visual and oculomotor development of premature children should be carefully examined. 
Prolonged relief of neuralgia after regional anesthetic blocks. A call for further experimental and systematic clinical studies. Thirty-eight consecutive patients with neuralgia after peripheral nerve injury were treated with one or two series of peripheral local anesthetic blocks. All patients experienced an initial total relief of ongoing pain for 4-12 h. Evoked pain (hyperalgesia or allodynia), which occurred in 17 patients, was blocked simultaneously with the spontaneous pain. In 18 patients the analgesia outlasted the conduction block and there was a period of complete pain relief of 12-48 h in 13 patients and of 2-6 days in the other 5. In 8 patients there was a second phase of analgesia of 4 h to 6 days duration occurring within 12 h of pain recurrence. Thus, mono- or biphasic prolonged complete analgesia occurred in 25 out of 38 patients. A prolonged analgesia may be the result of a central action of the local anesthetic at the spinal level after intra-axonal incorporation and centripetal axoplasmic transport. To test this hypothesis, an experimental study with [3H]lidocaine was performed in 6 rats. The radioactive local anesthetic was injected into one hind limb foot with the other side serving as a control. Tissue samples from the peripheral nerve, nerve root and the lumbosacral spinal cord segment were analyzed for radioactivity using a scintillation counter technique at various time intervals after the [3H]lidocaine injection. There was a low grade of activity in all samples and no difference between the test side and the control side. Thus these experiments provided no evidence in support of this hypothesis. Various alternative peripheral and central mechanisms are discussed. Further studies specifically directed to these alternatives and with longitudinal controls are prompted. 
Menstrual cycle factors related to increased gastric contractile response to tube feeding. Evidence exists that the ovarian hormones have a modulating effect on gastrointestinal (GI) motility, yet details are sketchy and little attention has been paid to the effect that fluctuating hormone levels might have on women who are receiving enteral feedings. This study compared gastric motility indices in response to tube feedings at two points in the menstrual cycle, concurrently measured ovarian hormone levels, and described three potentially related factors (ie, GI symptoms, uterine cramping pain, reports of daily stressors). Intragastric motility responses to enteral feedings were obtained on 28 women (aged 19-37) during menses and midfollicular phases of two menstrual cycles. Intragastric pressure changes were monitored by an open-tipped cannula method at rest, during and after tube feeding (Ensure, 240 ml at 8 ml/min). Serum estradiol and progesterone levels were measured by radioimmunoassay. Women completed a daily diary of symptoms and stressors throughout the two menstrual cycles. Results showed that intragastric pressure amplitudes and frequencies were higher at menses compared with midfollicular recordings. At menses, prefeeding and feeding gastric pressure amplitudes were positively correlated with uterine cramping pain and GI symptoms (ie, nausea). At menses, postfeeding contraction frequencies were also correlated with uterine cramping pain. At midfollicular phase, progesterone levels correlated with gastric motility indices; number of stressors indirectly correlated with gastric motility indices. These data suggest that gastric responses to enteral feeding are influenced by menstrual cycle phase. 
Randomized study of interleukin 2 (IL-2) alone vs IL-2 plus lymphokine-activated killer cells for treatment of melanoma and renal cell cancer. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of a continuous-infusion interleukin 2 (IL-2) regimen for patients with metastatic melanoma and renal cell cancer. To investigate the contribution of adoptively transferred lymphokine-activated killer cells, patients were randomized to receive either IL-2 alone or IL-2 plus lymphokine-activated killer cells. Twenty-three patients with renal cell carcinoma and 20 with melanoma were entered into the protocol. There were no objective responses noted in the 38 assessable patients (20 with renal cell carcinoma, 18 with melanoma). Most patients demonstrated progressive disease following one 31-day cycle of weekly continuous-infusion IL-2. Grade I and II toxic reactions, including fever, rash, anorexia, and weight gain, were common and treated symptomatically. Significant in vivo stimulation of lymphokine-activated killer and natural killer cell activity was noted in most patients. This continuous-infusion IL-2 regimen with or without lymphokine-activated killer cells was ineffective in the treatment of melanoma and renal cell carcinoma. 
MRI following severe perinatal asphyxia: preliminary experience. In 30 children suffering from severe perinatal asphyxia an attempt was made to determine the early prognostic signs of severe hypoxic-ischemic brain injury with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Ten early (1-4 days of age), 16 intermediate (2-4 weeks of age), and 38 late MRI (older than 1 month of age) procedures were performed on a 2.35 T MR-system. Severe cerebral necrosis was suspected by T2 hyperintensity of the white matter, with blurred limits to the cortex in early MRI, and was confirmed by T1 hyperintensity of the cortex in intermediate MRI. Severe cerebral necrosis was established at 3 months of age. Of the 11 children with this pattern (group A), 8 had severe and 3 had moderate cerebral palsy on subsequent examination. Thirteen children (group B) had normal late MRI scans; none developed severe cerebral palsy or marked mental retardation. Two children (group C) had focal ischemic lesions. Four children had intracranial hemorrhage (group D). Groups A and B did not differ in the severity of their perinatal histories and findings, suggesting that MRI during the first 3 months is of significant prognostic value. 
Haemodynamic changes during the apnoea test for diagnosis of brain death. Haemodynamic responses to the apnoea test for the diagnosis of brain death were investigated in nine patients with severe head injury or cerebrovascular disease. To prove apnoea, the ventilator was disconnected for ten minutes and oxygen was insufflated to avoid hypoxaemia. No respiratory movement was seen in any patient. Ten minutes after disconnecting the ventilator, PaCO2 was increased to 78 +/- 3 mmHg and pH was reduced to 7.17 +/- 0.02. Adequate oxygenation was maintained in all patients. Cardiac output increased from 4.8 +/- 0.7 to 5.7 +/- 0.8 L.min-1 (P less than 0.05), and mean pulmonary artery pressure increased from 11 +/- 1 to 17 +/- 2 mmHg (P less than 0.01). However, mean arterial pressure, heart rate, pulmonary artery wedge pressure and right atrial pressure did not change. Plasma catecholamines were measured in three patients. Plasma norepinephrine concentrations increased in all three patients but the changes in plasma epinephrine were minimal. These circulatory responses to acute hypercapnia were less than those reported in awake volunteers and in patients during general anaesthesia. However, since plasma norepinephrine concentration increased during the test, some sympathoadrenal response, probably of spinal origin, was present, and may have prevented the direct depressant circulatory effects of acute hypercapnia. In conclusion, the apnoea test did not produce haemodynamic disturbances when respiratory acidosis was limited to a pH 7.17 +/- 0.02 and PaCO2 60-80 mmHg. 
Respiratory and circulatory analysis of CO2 output during exercise in chronic heart failure. BACKGROUND. The output of carbon dioxide (VCO2) is controlled by both hemodynamics and ventilation. To understand VCO2 in patients who have chronic heart failure (CHF), we studied 14 patients who had New York Heart Association functional class III failure by measurements of hemodynamics, ventilation, and arterial and venous blood gases at rest and at 50 W of cycle ergometry exercise. METHODS AND RESULTS. Fick principle analysis of VCO2 showed that because of a limited increase in cardiac output, CHF patients widened their venoarterial CO2 content difference from 4.9 +/- 3.5 ml/dl at rest to 11.1 +/- 4.0 ml/dl with exercise (p less than 0.05). This increase in CO2 content difference was achieved with no change in venous CO2 content (from 54.3 +/- 3.3 ml/dl at rest to 54.5 +/- 4.8 ml/dl at exercise, p = NS); however, there was a decrease of arterial CO2 content (from 49.4 +/- 3.7 ml/dl at rest to 43.4 +/- 2.3 ml/dl with exercise, p less than 0.05). Modeling of the CO2 tension-content relation showed that there would have been a small, nonproportional increase of venous CO2 content as venous CO2 tension increased from 43.2 +/- 1.8 mm Hg at rest to 55.3 +/- 4.2 mm Hg during exercise (p less than 0.05); however, the development of metabolic acidosis during exercise entirely blunted the increase of CO2 content. In contrast, both the shape of the tension-content relation and the acidosis of exercise further influenced the decrease of arterial CO2 content as arterial CO2 tension decreased from 37.0 +/- 2.9 mm Hg at rest to 32.0 +/- 3.4 mm Hg during exercise (p less than 0.05) as a result of excess ventilation. CONCLUSIONS. In CHF patients during exercise, the circulatory limitations imposed by a low cardiac output on VCO2 are compensated by a widened venoarterial CO2 content difference. The content difference is not widened through an increase of venous CO2 content but rather by a decrease of arterial CO2 content caused by arterial hypocapnia and metabolic acidosis. 
Involvement of thin afferents in carpal tunnel syndrome: evaluated quantitatively by argon laser stimulation. The thin afferent nerves were tested quantitatively by determining the thresholds of warmth and pricking pain to argon laser stimulation and by measuring the brain potentials related to pricking pain. In 27 patients with electrophysiologically verified carpal tunnel syndrome these parameters were measured from fingers 3 and 5 on both hands. All patients had had sensory symptoms ranging from 3 months to 25 years. Both the thresholds were elevated (P less than 0.05) at finger 3 compared to measurements from finger 5, and compared to finger 3 in a group of 39 controls. Four patients with symptoms for more than 7 years had thresholds below the control values. The power of the pain-evoked brain potentials elicited from finger 3 was lower (P less than 0.05) compared to finger 5, and compared to the control group (P less than 0.01). No correlations were found between the measured parameters and the clinical electrophysiological investigation. The findings support previous assumptions that chronic low-force compressions cause impairment of intraneural microcirculation, and hence can affect the function of the thin afferents. 
Examination of spinal cord in diseases of the craniocervical junction and high cervical spine. A simple necropsy technique for the removal of the craniocervical junction was devised: a relatively small specimen comprising part of the clivus, the foramen magnum, and cervical vertebral canal is removed in one piece with the medulla and spinal cord inside, and examined systematically after fixation. This method, used in a series of patients with chronic craniocervical instability, allows both good clinicopathological correlations to be made and histological changes in the lower medulla or upper cervical cord segments to be related to sites of extrinsic compression. 
Non-Hodgkin's lymphomas of nasal cavity and paranasal sinuses. An immunohistochemical study. The authors studied the immunophenotype of nine sinonasal lymphomas using a panel of monoclonal antibodies that react with fixed, paraffin-embedded material (EMA, CAM 5.2, CD45, CD37 [MB-1], MB-2, L-26, CDw75 [LN-1], CD45RA [4 KB-5], CD43 [MT-1], and CD45RO [UCHL-1]). There were seven men and two women, with a mean age of 64 years (range, 9-89 years) and median age of 56 years. Three tumors were limited to the nasal cavity, and the other six had multiple sites of involvement, including the nasal cavity (five), antrum (six), ethmoid (two), orbit (two), and hard palate (one). Histologically, one was a lymphoblastic lymphoma (LBL), one was small cleaved-cell lymphoma (SCCL), three were mixed-cell lymphomas (MCLs), and four were large cell lymphomas (LCLs). Four cases were T-cell lymphomas (one SCCL, three MCLs), four were B-cell neoplasms (four LCLs), and one was of uncertain lineage (LBL). Angioinvasion, coagulative necrosis, and epitheliotropism were seen in the T-cell lymphomas. Extranasal dissemination was seen in four cases: one LBL that involved the lymph nodes, skin, and testes 15 months after diagnosis; one B-LCL that involved the skin 9 months after diagnosis; and one B-LCL and one T-MCL that involved the gastric mucosa and lung simultaneously with nasal presentation. This study shows a higher predominance of B-cell lymphomas in the sinonasal region than previously reported in Oriental populations. However, the T:B ratio of these lymphomas is still greater than that observed for primary lymph node-based neoplasms. 
The role of serotonin (5HT2) receptor blockade in myocardial reperfusion injury: effects of LY53857 in a canine model of myocardial infarction. The potential protective effects of serotonin receptor antagonism during the process of acute myocardial infarction were studied in anesthetized male dogs, which were subjected to a 90-min left circumflex coronary artery occlusion followed by 5 h of reperfusion. Either vehicle (0.9% NaCl) or the serotonin (5HT2) receptor antagonist LY53857 was infused i.v. at a dose of 0.5 mg/kg, followed by a constant infusion of 2 mg/kg/min beginning 5 min before left circumflex coronary artery occlusion and continuing throughout the duration of the ischemia and subsequent reperfusion. Verification of functional 5HT2 receptor antagonism in the circulating blood of the LY53857-treated dogs was monitored throughout the experiments by periodic assessment of ex vivo platelet reactivity to exogenous serotonin. After 5 h of reperfusion, the hearts were excised and analyzed utilizing histochemical staining with triphenyltetrazolium, which demarcates myocardial infarct size and anatomical area of myocardium at risk of infarction. There was not a significant reduction of infarct size with LY53857 treatment: control infarct/area at risk = 38.6 +/- 4.7%, n = 9 LY53857 infarct/area at risk = 33.4 +/- 3.8%, n = 6. Similarly, when myocardial infarct size was analyzed as a function of myocardial collateral blood flow, there were no significant effects of drug treatment on the relationship between collateral blood flow and infarct size. The effects of 5HT on neutrophil activation were determined by measuring the potential ability of 5HT to enhance the chemotactic peptide-induced production of superoxide. 5HT did not activate human neutrophils in vitro and LY53857 had no effect on neutrophil superoxide production. 
Anomalous coronary arteries arising from the aorta associated with sudden death in infancy and early childhood. An autopsy series. Anomalous coronary arteries arising from the aorta are a recognized cause of myocardial ischemia and sudden death. Death has been precipitated by exercise in most cases. We present the results of an autopsy study in which sudden and unexpected deaths associated with coronary anomalies were found in three children (less than 2 years of age). In two cases, death was not associated with exercise. In two case, the myocardium was morphologically normal, and in the third case, there was an extensive recent anterior myocardial infarct with a background of established fibrosis. Coronary artery anomalies may be easily overlooked in this age group because of small vessel size and difficulty in dissection; this is particularly so when there are normally placed ostia. One consequence of this is potential for confusion with sudden infant death syndrome. 
Regular ventricular rhythms in patients with symptomatic paroxysmal atrial fibrillation. Paroxysmal atrial fibrillation is a grossly irregular tachycardia. Forty-nine patients with paroxysmal atrial fibrillation who were taking a variety of antiarrhythmic medications including the class IC agents propafenone and flecainide were followed up for a median of 371 days with use of transtelephonic electrocardiogram (ECG) monitoring to document symptomatic rhythms. Eighteen patients had 96 episodes of regular tachycardia; the cumulative incidence rate was 25% at 6 months, 33% at 1 year and 41% at 18 months. Eighty of the 96 episodes occurred with a heart rate less than or equal to 180 beats/min and could have been explained by atrial flutter with 2:1 block. However, nine patients had a total of 16 episodes with a rate greater than 180 beats/min that were probably not due to atrial flutter with block; the cumulative incidence rate of these fast regular tachycardias was 14% at 6 months, 17% at 1 year and 25% at 18 months. QRS duration during the first episode of regular tachycardia was significantly longer in patients taking a class IC drug (median 105 vs 90 ms, p less than 0.001 Wilcoxon rank sum test). In contrast to drug therapy with amiodarone or the combination of digoxin and verapamil, the QRS duration of regular tachycardias during class IC therapy was directly related to the tachycardia heart rate (Spearman's rank, p less than 0.01). All episodes of fast, regular tachycardias with a QRS duration greater than 120 ms occurred in patients taking a class IC drug. Clinicians treating patients with paroxysmal atrial fibrillation should expect a substantial incidence of regular tachycardia in addition to atrial fibrillation. 
Intraosseous vascular malformations of the orbit. Intraosseous vascular malformations are rare benign tumors involving the bones of the orbit. The diagnosis should be considered when a patient presents with an enlarging mass fixed to bone in the upper face, and the characteristic x-ray appearance should be looked for on plain films. Treatment is local excision of the bone containing the tumor and immediate reconstruction with autogenous bone. 
Conjunctival cysts in anophthalmic orbits. Five out of 149 patients (3%) who received an intraorbital implant to prevent or treat the disfiguring symptoms associated with the postenucleation socket syndrome developed intraorbital conjunctival cysts. All five patients had received a secondary implant two 14 months previously. After excision of the cysts four patients required additional surgery for lack of conjunctiva and/or recurrent cyst formation. The clinical findings, mechanism of development, and management of this rare but serious complication of socket surgery are described. 
Respiration-deficient cells are caused by a single point mutation in the mitochondrial tRNA-Leu (UUR) gene in mitochondrial myopathy, encephalopathy, lactic acidosis, and strokelike episodes (MELAS). MELAS (mitochondrial myopathy, encephalopathy, lactic acidosis, and strokelike episodes) is a major subgroup of heterogeneous mitochondrial diseases. For identifying a mutation in the mitochondrial gene, we isolated, from the same muscle tissue from a patient with MELAS, cell lines with distinctly different phenotypes: one was respiration-deficient, and the other was apparently normal. Compared with the normal cells, only one A-to-G nucleotide transition at nucleotide 3243 in the tRNA-Leu (UUR) gene was found in whole mtDNA of the respiration-deficient cells. This mutation was also found in eight patients, from unrelated families, who had MELAS in a heteroplasmic manner but was not found in control individuals. Therefore, the single point mutation causes the functional abnormality in the respiratory chain of mitochondria. 
Epidermal growth factor-related transforming growth factors in the urine of patients with hepatocellular carcinoma. To characterize epidermal growth factor-related transforming growth factors in the urine of patients with hepatocellular carcinoma, gel filtration with Bio-Gel P-30 was performed in seven hepatocellular carcinoma patients and seven sex-matched and age-matched healthy controls. Distinct profiles of soft agar growth assay in the hepatocellular carcinoma patients and the normal controls were seen. Three peaks (A, B and C) in the urine were examined. Peak C in most hepatocellular carcinoma patients was higher than that in healthy controls. Similar profiles were detected with epidermal growth factor radioreceptor assay and cellular DNA synthesis assay. This result might indicate that transforming growth factors with low molecular weight were found in the urine of hepatocellular carcinoma patients. An exceptional HCC patient had an additional peak (A') that corresponded to the high molecular weight protein. We concluded that there were transforming growth factors with functional activity in the urine of patients with hepatocellular carcinoma. 
Functional and phenotypic analysis of lymphocytes in head and neck cancer. We compared the phenotype and antitumor effector function of lymphocytes obtained from tumor tissues, lymph nodes, and the peripheral blood of patients with head and neck cancer. Freshly isolated tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes were deficient in CD4+ T cells in comparison with lymph node lymphocytes (LNL) and peripheral blood lymphocytes. A significantly higher CD4/CD8 ratio observed in LNL vs tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes and peripheral blood lymphocytes was attributable to both a significant enrichment in CD4+ T cells as well as a decrease in CD8+ T cells. The percentage of natural killer cells (CD3-CD56+) was uniformly low in both tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes and LNL. In patients with cervical metastases, LNL contained an increased proportion of CD16+ cells. Tumor-involved lymph nodes were not enriched in the CD8+C11b+ subset of T "suppressor" lymphocytes compared with uninvolved lymph nodes. Also, tumor-involved lymph nodes had significantly fewer CD4+ T cells than did uninvolved lymph nodes. In comparison with peripheral blood lymphocytes, freshly isolated tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes and LNL were depleted of cytotoxic effector cells, as indicated by low or absent cytotoxic activity against tumor cell targets. The ability to generate lymphokine-activated killer cells was significantly reduced in LNL in comparison with peripheral blood lymphocytes. In patients with head and neck cancer, depressed local and regional antitumor responses are associated with a deficiency of functional cytotoxic effector cells rather than an increase in suppressor T lymphocytes. 
Survival after neonatal myocardial infarction. These are case reports of two children with structurally normal hearts and with normal coronary arteries, who survived myocardial infarction in the early neonatal period. They are only the third and fourth reported survivors of neonatal myocardial infarction and the first in which hypercholesterolemia is postulated to have played an important role. The most likely cause of the myocardial infarction was thrombosis or thromboembolism. Changes in hemostatic function associated with hypercholesterolemia may be relevant. 
Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation in the treatment of neonatal respiratory failure. We report 18 consecutive neonates with severe respiratory failure due to pulmonary hypertension treated with extracorporeal membrane oxygenation. Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation was begun at 52 +/- 36 hours of age with an arterial partial pressure of oxygen (PO2) of 36 +/- 14 mm Hg despite maximal pharmacologic and ventilator support (inspired fraction of oxygen [FiO2], 0.99 +/- 0.03; respiratory rate, 98 +/- 31/min; and positive inspiratory pressure, 54 +/- 11 cm of water). With initial flows of 130 +/- 17 mL/kg per minute, ventilator settings were reduced to the following: FiO2, 0.30; respiratory rates, 15/min; and positive inspiratory pressure, 24 cm of water. Support using extracorporeal membrane oxygenation was gradually reduced to 22% of initial flows and arterial blood samples showed pH 7.48 +/- .05, PO2 of 106 +/- 27 mm Hg, and PCO2 of 36 +/- 5 mm Hg just prior to decannulation. After 107 +/- 45 hours, extracorporeal membrane oxygenation was stopped and infants were extubated 61 +/- 53 hours (median, 46 hours) afterward. There was one death (94.4% survival rate); all survivors were discharged and underwent a follow-up examination at 1 to 27 months of age. Complications included two intracranial hemorrhages (one death and one asymptomatic), one patent ductus arteriosus requiring ligation on extracorporeal membrane oxygenation, and chronic lung disease in one patient. In selected neonates, extracorporeal membrane oxygenation allows for resolution of pulmonary hypertension, results in improved survival, and is associated with a low incidence of chronic lung disease. Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation should be considered in the treatment of severe respiratory failure. 
Self-expandable stainless steel endoprostheses for treatment of malignant bile duct obstruction. The Wallstent biliary endoprosthesis is a mesh of stainless steel that is delivered percutaneously over a 7-French catheter but expands to achieve a 1-cm lumen when released across a bile-duct stricture. The small transhepatic track required makes insertion easier, less painful, and probably safer when compared with plastic stents, and the large internal lumen reduces the rate of occlusion by encrusted bile. Wallstent endoprostheses were inserted under local anesthesia in 41 consecutive patients with malignant obstructive jaundice. Biliary drainage was considered the treatment of choice in all of these patients. The diagnosis was based on biopsy results in 32 patients and on radiologic appearances in nine. The patients were followed up in outpatient clinics for 16 months and had repeated radiologic examinations only if they had symptoms suggesting stent occlusion. No cases of hemobilia due to damaged hepatic vessels occurred. Two patients had septicemia treated with antibiotics. Three patients had recurrent jaundice due to growth of tumor below or above the stents. Endoprosthesis migration was not seen. No cases of stent occlusion due to encrustation of bile occurred. The median survival of patients was 105 days (range, 10-545 days). Our experience shows that Wallstent endoprostheses can be inserted with little discomfort for the patient and with relatively few complications. They provide good palliation in patients with malignant obstructive jaundice. 
Bronchial reactivity and allergy-promoting factors in monozygotic twins discordant for allergic rhinitis. Bronchial reactivity was studied twice in eight monozygotic twin pairs discordant for allergic rhinitis with pollen hypersensitivity, during the winter season (all eight pairs) and during the pollen season (seven pairs). On both occasions, the allergic twins showed significantly higher reactivity than their nonallergic siblings. The results indicate that moderate allergic rhinitis is associated with increased bronchial reactivity. This increased reactivity is an acquired trait; however, bronchial reactivity is not constantly increased in pollen rhinitis and may be normal even during the pollen season. The symptoms of allergic rhinitis usually started in childhood before the separation of the siblings. We could not demonstrate any major differences in exposure to allergens or airway irritants between the siblings. The allergic twins tended to have lower birth weight and insufficient weight increase just after birth. 
A novel enzyme immunoassay for serodiagnosis of Helicobacter pylori infection. Helicobacter pylori has recently been implicated as an etiologic agent of gastroduodenal disorders. Comparing the antibody to H. pylori in the sera of patients with that of normal controls by Western blot analysis, a unique antibody was detected in the sera of patients, which reacted with the 25-kilodalton antigen of H. pylori. On the other hand, monoclonal antibody CP3 prepared in the authors' laboratory also recognized the 25-kilodalton antigen of H. pylori. Whether the serum antibody of the patient recognized the CP3 antigen purified by monoclonal antibody CP3 was then examined. Western blot analysis showed that the patient's serum reacted strongly with the affinity-purified CP3 antigen. Using monoclonal antibody CP3, an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay to detect CP3 antibody in sera was established. In patients with chronic gastritis and gastric ulcers, the titer of CP3 antibody was significantly higher than in normal controls and correlated with the histological grade of antral gastritis. The detection of CP3 antibody in sera is useful in the diagnosis of chronic gastritis and gastric ulcer associated with H. pylori infection and also in evaluation of the grade of gastritis. 
Comparison of exercise radionuclide angiography with thallium SPECT imaging for detection of significant narrowing of the left circumflex coronary artery. Although quantitation of exercise thallium tomograms has enhanced the noninvasive diagnosis and localization of coronary artery disease, the detection of stenosis of the left circumflex coronary artery remains suboptimal. Because posterolateral regional wall motion during exercise is well assessed by radionuclide angiography, this study determined whether regional dysfunction of the posterolateral wall during exercise radionuclide angiography is more sensitive in identifying left circumflex disease than thallium perfusion abnormalities assessed by single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT). One hundred ten consecutive patients with CAD were studied, of whom 70 had a significant stenosis of the left circumflex coronary artery or a major obtuse marginal branch. Both regional function and segmental thallium activity of the posterolateral wall were assessed using visual and quantitative analysis. Left ventricular regional function was assessed objectively by dividing the left ventricular region of interest into 20 sectors; the 8 sectors corresponding to the posterolateral free wall were used to assess function in the left circumflex artery distribution. Similarly, using circumferential profile analysis of short-axis thallium tomograms, left ventricular myocardial activity was subdivided into 64 sectors; the 16 sectors corresponding to the posterolateral region were used to assess thallium perfusion abnormalities in the left circumflex artery territory. Qualitative posterolateral wall motion analysis detected 76% of patients with left circumflex coronary artery stenosis, with a specificity of 83%, compared with only 44% by qualitative thallium tomography (p less than 0.001) and a specificity of 92%. Whereas quantitation of thallium activity increased the sensitivity for detecting left circumflex coronary artery stenosis to 80% with a specificity of 55%, it did not achieve statistical significance when compared with qualitative wall motion analysis. 
Paraganglioma of the cauda equina: case report with magnetic resonance imaging description. The case of a 35-year-old white man with a cauda equina syndrome is presented. Magnetic resonance imaging confirmed the diagnosis, and radiation treatment successfully treated the condition. 
Relation of risk factor levels in young adulthood to parental history of disease. The CARDIA study BACKGROUND. The relation between self-reported parental disease and risk factor levels was examined in 2,637 black and 2,478 white men and women aged 18-30 years at the Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults (CARDIA) Study baseline examination (1985-1986). METHODS AND RESULTS. The prevalence of parental disease (at least one parent) in white versus black participants was 44% and 56% for hypertension, 47% and 44% for obesity, 16% and 13% for myocardial infarction, 11% and 17% for diabetes, and 6% and 10% for stroke, respectively. Among these young adults, parental hypertension was associated with higher sex- and age-adjusted systolic and diastolic blood pressure levels. Parental myocardial infarction was associated with higher plasma cholesterol, higher blood pressure levels, and lower high density lipoprotein cholesterol levels in white participants. Parental diabetes was associated with higher fasting blood glucose and insulin levels in all race-sex groups and with higher triglycerides and lower high density lipoprotein cholesterol in black participants only. Parental history of obesity was related to less favorable age- and sex-adjusted lipid levels in white participants and higher blood pressure levels in black participants. Parental history of stroke was associated with higher systolic blood pressure levels in black participants. In general, these differences across family history were predicted only in part by obesity. The prevalence of more than one disease reported in parents occurred more frequently than would have been expected due to chance alone. CONCLUSIONS. These associations between parental disease and risk factors in their adult children probably reflects the impact of both environmental and genetic factors. Parental history may be a useful marker for high risk individuals. 
Noninvasive estimation of the instantaneous first derivative of left ventricular pressure using continuous-wave Doppler echocardiography BACKGROUND. The complete continuous-wave Doppler mitral regurgitant velocity curve should allow reconstruction of the ventriculoatrial (VA) pressure gradient from mitral valve closure to opening, including left ventricular (LV) isovolumic contraction, ejection, and isovolumic relaxation. Assuming that the left atrial pressure fluctuation is relatively minor in comparison with the corresponding LV pressure changes during systole, the first derivative of the Doppler-derived VA pressure gradient curve (Doppler dP/dt) might be used to estimate the LV dP/dt curve, previously measurable only at catheterization (catheter dP/dt). METHODS AND RESULTS. This hypothesis was examined in an in vivo mitral regurgitant model during 30 hemodynamic stages in eight dogs. Contractility and relaxation were altered by inotropic stimulation and hypothermia. The Doppler mitral regurgitant velocity spectrum was recorded along with simultaneously acquired micromanometer LV and left atrial pressures. The regurgitant velocity profiles were digitized and converted to VA pressure gradient curves using the simplified Bernoulli equation. The instantaneous dP/dt of the VA pressure gradient curve was then derived. The instantaneous Doppler-derived VA pressure gradients, instantaneous Doppler dP/dt, dP/dtmax, and -dP/dtmax were compared with corresponding catheter measurements. This method of estimating dP/dtmax from the instantaneous dP/dt curve was also compared with a previously proposed Doppler method of estimating dP/dtmax using the Doppler-derived mean rate of LV pressure rise over the time period between velocities of 1 and 3 m/sec on the ascending slope of the Doppler velocity spectrum. Both instantaneous Doppler-derived VA pressure gradients (r = 0.95, p less than 0.0001) and Doppler dP/dt (r = 0.92, p less than 0.0001) correlated well with corresponding measurements by catheter during systolic contraction and isovolumic relaxation (pooled data). The Doppler dP/dtmax (1,266 +/- 701 mm Hg/sec) also correlated well (r = 0.94) with the catheter dP/dtmax (1,200 +/- 573 mm Hg/sec). There was no difference between the two methods for measurement of dP/dtmax (p = NS). Although Doppler -dP/dtmax was slightly lower than the catheter measurement (961 +/- 511 versus 1,057 +/- 540 mm Hg/sec, p less than 0.01), the correlation between measurements by Doppler and catheter was excellent (r = 0.93, p less than 0.0001). The alternative method of mean isovolumic pressure rise (896 +/- 465 mm Hg/sec) underestimated the catheter dP/dtmax (1,200 +/- 573 mm Hg/sec) significantly (on average, 25%; p less than 0.001). CONCLUSIONS. The present study demonstrated an accurate and reliable noninvasive Doppler method for estimating instantaneous LV dP/dt, dP/dtmax, and -dP/dtmax. 
Marked differences in immunocytological localization of [3H]estradiol-binding protein in rat pancreatic acinar tumor cells compared to normal acinar cells. [3H]Estradiol can bind to a specific protein in normal rat pancreatic acinar cells. Electron microscopic immunocytochemical analysis has shown this protein to be localized primarily in the rough endoplasmic reticulum and mitochondria. Rat exocrine pancreatic tumor cell lines, whether grown in tissue culture (AR42J) or as a tumor mass after sc injection into rats (DSL-2), lacked detectable amounts of this [3H]estradiol-binding protein (EBP), as determined by the dextran-coated charcoal assay. Furthermore, primary exocrine pancreatic neoplasms induced with the carcinogen azaserine contained little or no detectable [3H]estradiol-binding activity. However, electron immunocytochemical studies of transformed cells indicated the presence of material that cross-reacted with antibodies prepared against the [3H]EBP. The immunopositive reaction in transformed cells was localized almost exclusively in lipid granules. Such lipid organelles in normal acinar cells, although present less frequently than in transformed cells, have never been observed to contain EBP-like immunopositive material. Presumably, the aberrant localization of EBP in these acinar tumor cells results in loss of function of this protein, which in normal pancreatic acinar cells appears to exert a modulating influence on zymogen granule formation and the process of secretion. 
Tissue-plasminogen activator for pulmonary embolism resulting in shock: two case reports and discussion of the literature. Two patients with significant relative contraindications to fibrinolysis, and with refractory shock caused by acute pulmonary embolism, who were successfully treated with recombinant tissue-type plasminogen activator (rt-PA) are reported. The role of rt-PA in the management of pulmonary embolism is discussed, and pertinent literature is reviewed. 
Noninvasive radiological diagnosis of renal vein thrombosis in renal transplantation. Thrombosis of the allograft renal vein is a rare complication of renal transplantation. Of 557 consecutive renal transplants performed between January 1, 1985 and November 30, 1989, 3 cases occurred for an over-all incidence of 0.4%. In 2 cases the diagnosis was made preoperatively with renal scintigraphy and duplex Doppler sonography. No graft was salvaged, despite timely diagnosis in 2 patients. We conclude that the diagnosis of renal vein thrombosis in the renal allograft recipient should be suspected clinically and by the radiographic findings of absent perfusion on renal scintigraphy, and the detection of an arterial signal, albeit abnormal, on duplex Doppler sonography. When diagnosed, nephrectomy appears to be the only treatment. 
Na+ transport in hypertension. Several different lines of argument lead to the conclusion that the Na+ ion is important in hypertension. These include dietary and epidemiological studies, studies on the isolated cells and tissues of hypertensive subjects, and the association of the genetic predisposition to hypertension with abnormalities of cellular Na+ handling. In isolated cells, the most convincing abnormalities have been shown in the Na+ pump, where there is also evidence of a circulating inhibitor of the pump in essential hypertension, although the nature of the agent is still uncertain. The genetic association between essential hypertension and Na+ transport is best represented by alterations in Na(+)-Li+ countertransport in hypertensive subjects and their near relatives, although interpretation is rendered more complex by the influence of nongenetic factors on this system. The demonstrated differences between hypertensive and nonhypertensive subjects in the cellular handling of Na+ have not been integrated into a totally convincing explanation of the ultimate mechanism of the condition. Attention has focused on the possible mechanisms whereby an increase in intracellular Na+ may increase the concentration of cytosolic Ca2+ in the vascular smooth muscle, which is presumed to be a necessary precondition to a chronically elevated peripheral vascular resistance. 
Therapeutic benefits of calcium channel blockers in cyclosporine-treated organ transplant recipients: blood pressure control and immunosuppression. Cyclosporine has dramatically improved the success rates for all forms of organ transplantation. However, its use is complicated by the frequent occurrence of hypertension and reversible nephrotoxicity. The iatrogenic hypertension induced by cyclosporine resembles a low-renin, salt-sensitive form of essential hypertension, which is often controlled with salt restriction and therapies counteracting renal salt acquisition, e.g., diuretics and calcium channel blockers (CCBs). CCBs may also counteract the direct vasoconstrictive effects of cyclosporine, as well as the effects of other vasoconstrictors, such as endothelin or thromboxane, that may be stimulated by cyclosporine. Additionally, CCBs may potentiate the immunosuppression of cyclosporine, yet minimize nephrotoxicity. We demonstrated that the in vitro combination of verapamil and cyclosporine had an additive inhibitory effect on the activation and function of human peripheral blood mononuclear cells in several assays of the afferent and efferent limbs of immunologic responses. This additive immunosuppression was not likely to have been related to these drugs' effects on interleukin-2 (IL-2) circuitry, since no additive inhibition of IL-2 production or IL-2 responsiveness was found. There was some additive inhibition of IL-2 receptor expression at the higher concentrations of verapamil and cyclosporine that were tested. Although the combination of verapamil and cyclosporine additively inhibited mitogen-induced 45Ca uptake, the inhibitory effect of cyclosporine appears to be due to an inhibition of lymphocyte activation rather than direct inhibition of calcium flux through the slow calcium channel, suggesting that the two drugs do not have additive effects in depressing the transmembrane flux of calcium. More recently, we have demonstrated that the inactive enantiomer of verapamil, which does not block the slow calcium channel, has identical immunosuppressive capabilities as the active enantiomer. Thus, the antiproliferative effect of verapamil is probably slow-calcium-channel independent and may represent the ability of the drug to interfere with muscarinic, alpha 1-adrenergic, or even opiate receptors on lymphocytes or to block lymphocyte potassium channels. An even better possibility is that verapamil may diminish necessary precursor molecule uptake into lymphocytes, since both the inactive and active isomeric forms of verapamil are capable of diminishing thymidine, uridine, and leucine incorporation into stimulated lymphocytes--necessary for DNA, RNA, and protein synthesis, respectively. These in vitro observations may have clinical applicability, as early studies demonstrate reduced rejection rates of cyclosporine-treated transplant patients receiving CCBs. Consequently, CCBs are important medications to be considered for use in cyclosporine-treated organ transplant recipients. 
Beneficial effect of long-term beta blockade after acute myocardial infarction in patients without anterograde flow in the infarct artery. Previous studies have shown that long-term survival after acute myocardial infarction (AMI) is improved by beta-adrenergic blockade and anterograde flow in the infarct artery. This study was done to assess the influence of beta blockade on mortality in survivors of AMI without anterograde flow. Over 9.5 years, 113 subjects (87 men and 26 women, aged 26 to 66 years) with AMI and no anterograde flow in the infarct artery and no disease of the other arteries were medically treated for 48 +/- 28 (mean +/- standard deviation) months. Forty-six patients received long-term beta blockade (group I), whereas 67 did not (group II). The groups were similar in age, sex, cardioactive medications, left ventricular performance and infarct artery. Of the 46 group I subjects, 1 (2%) died of cardiac causes; in contrast, 20 (30%) of the group II patients died of cardiac causes (p = 0.007 compared with group I). Thus, in survivors of AMI without anterograde flow in the infarct artery, mortality is markedly reduced by long-term beta blockade. 
Intensive sequential chemotherapy with mitoxantrone and continuous infusion etoposide and cytarabine for previously treated acute myelogenous leukemia. Intensive sequential chemotherapy with mitoxantrone, 12 mg/m2/d on days 1 through 3, etoposide, 200 mg/m2/d as a continuous infusion on days 8 through 10, and cytarabine, 500 mg/m2/d as a continuous infusion on days 1 through 3 and 8 through 10 was administered to 72 patients aged less than 60 years with previously treated acute myelogenous leukemia (AML). Forty patients had refractory AML (nonresponse to prior therapy, early first relapse, or multiple relapse) and 32 had late first relapse. Sixty-one percent of patients, with a 95% confidence interval (CI) ranging from 49% to 72%, achieved complete remission (CR), including 45% (CI: 30% to 62%) of refractory patients and 81% (CI: 64% to 93%) of late first relapse patients. Twenty-nine percent of patients (CI: 19% to 41%) did not respond to therapy and 10% (CI: 4% to 19%) died from therapy-related toxicity. Median duration of aplasia was 30 days. Nonhematologic WHO grade 3 or more toxicity included sepsis (57% of patients), vomiting (10%), mucositis (35%), diarrhea (7%), skin rash (6%), and hyperbilirubinemia (11%). Postinduction therapy was attempted in 36 of 44 CR patients: 16 of them received a second course of the same regimen, 7 received maintenance chemotherapy, 4 underwent autologous bone marrow transplantation (BMT), and 9 allogeneic BMT. At a median follow-up of 20 months, 23 of the 44 complete remitters have relapsed, 1 to 14 months after achievement of CR, including 19 of 31 patients not undergoing BMT. Median survival is 7 months with 16% (CI: 4% to 28%) projected survival at 47 months. Median disease-free survival is 6 months with 21% (CI: 3% to 39%) of CR patients projected to remain disease-free at 46 months. Twenty-six percent (CI: 13% to 43%) of the evaluable patients who did not receive transplantation had inversion of CR duration. Among patients younger than 50 years, there was no significant difference in disease-free survival between patients receiving postinduction chemotherapy and those receiving BMT. We conclude that this chemotherapy regimen is highly efficient and could be used as first-line therapy in young patients with AML. 
Effect of systemic fibrinogen depletion on intraabdominal abscess formation. Deposition of fibrin within the peritoneal cavity is an integral host response to local infection. To directly assess the role of fibrin deposition in the pathogenesis of intraabdominal abscess formation, the ability to induce abscesses in fibrinogen-depleted mice was examined. We hypothesized that systemic defibrinogenation with ancrod would limit the availability of fibrinogen for deposition within the peritoneal cavity and would therefore impair intraabdominal abscess formation. A gelatin capsule containing 50% sterile feces plus Bacteroides fragilis 1 x 10(9) CFU was inserted IP into control or defibrinogenated mice. System defibrinogenation resulted in alteration of the character of abscess formation, as manifested by reduced abscess size and degree of purulence. Abscesses were significantly smaller (0.18 +/- 0.02 gm [n = 29] vs. 0.09 +/- 0.02 gm [n = 11], p less than 0.01) and less purulent (p less than 0.001) in the ancrod-treated mice than in control animals, despite equal numbers of bacteria in the abscesses recovered from both groups. The effect of ancrod was specific for defibrinogenation, because IP repletion with fibrinogen reversed the ancrod effect on abscess size. In addition to its local effects, systemic fibrinogen depletion resulted in a significant elevation in mortality following IP infection (1 of 30 control animals vs. 10 of 23 ancrod-treated animals, p less than 0.01). However, this was not due to an increase in the magnitude of the B. fragilis bacteremia. These studies demonstrate that fibrin deposition contributes to the pathogenesis of purulent abscess formation and that systemic depletion of fibrinogen may alter host susceptibility to the consequences of infection. 
Role of gastric colonization in the development of pneumonia in critically ill trauma patients: results of a prospective randomized trial. Critically ill trauma patients were entered in a prospective, randomized trial to determine the role of gastric colonization in the development of pneumonia. Trauma patients admitted to the SICU were randomized to receive antacids (n = 27), continuous IV cimetidine (n = 32), or sucralfate (n = 30). Quantitative nasogastric tube (NGT) cultures were obtained biweekly and correlated with gastric pH, the incidence of pneumonia, and the incidence of pneumonia caused by an organism previously isolated from the stomach (percentage of gastric source of pneumonia--% GSP). Patients receiving antacids had a significantly greater pH than those receiving cimetidine (5.6 +/- 1.03 vs. 4.7 +/- 1.03; p = 0.006). However, there was no significant difference between the overall incidence of pneumonia, the percentage of NGT isolates greater than 10(6)/ml, or the % GSP. The gastric bacteriology of the three subgroups was nearly identical, with Candida albicans, Enterococci, and beta-hemolytic Streptococci being the most frequently isolated organisms. Gastric growth of organisms preceding their appearance in the blood occurred in 5 of 89 (5.6%) patients. These results suggest that 1) in trauma patients, the incidence of pneumonia is not increased by the use of stress ulcer prophylactic agents that elevate gastric pH; 2) increases in gastric pH progressively increased the number of intragastric bacteria but this did not correlate with an increased incidence of % GSP; and 3) while organisms in the upper intestinal tract may be pathogens for pneumonia, they are uncommonly a source of bacteremia in seriously injured patients. 
Iliofemoral venous thrombectomy followed by percutaneous closure of the temporary arteriovenous fistula. Iliofemoral venous thrombosis treated by anticoagulants alone almost invariably results in postthrombotic sequelae with deep venous reflux alone or combined with an outflow obstruction. This study evaluates the result of iliofemoral venous thrombectomy with temporary proximal arteriovenous fistula (AVF) performed on 48 consecutive patients. In 10 patients the thrombus extended in the inferior vena cava, and the thrombectomy was combined with inferior vena cava interruption. The AVF closed spontaneously in 8 of 48 patients (patency rate, 84%). An attempt to close the AVF by placing a detachable balloon percutaneously under radiographic control was made 6 to 12 weeks later (success rate, 87%; complications, rare). A preclosure arteriovenography of the femoro-iliaco-caval segment revealed 34 of 38 segments open (patency rate, 89%). Four patients had severe stenosis of the iliac segment, and a transvenous percutaneous dilatation was successfully performed in three of the four patients, keeping the fistula. At AVF closure 4 weeks later the arteriovenography showed sustained dilatation in only two patients. Thirty-seven patients were followed for 3 to 48 months (median, 24 months) and 30 of 37 patients (81%) who had no symptoms were not using compression stockings. Doppler investigation revealed patent and competent femoral and popliteal veins and normal photoplethysmography in 56% of the patients. Four iliac veins were occluded (patency rate, 88%). No recurrence of fistula had occurred. Venous iliofemoral thrombectomy seems to better preserve valve function. The percutaneous balloon closure of the AVF has decreased the complication rate, facilitated venographic evaluation of the result, and made possible the performance of percutaneous interventions under the protection of the AVF. 
Occupational carpal tunnel syndrome in Washington State, 1984-1988. BACKGROUND: There are no published population-based studies of occupational carpal tunnel syndrome (OCTS) using a strict case definition. Most studies are either industry specific or present patient self-report of symptoms. METHODS: We conducted a population-based incidence study of OCTS using the Washington State Workers' Compensation database. Incident OCTS claims were identified with paid bills for physician reported ICD codes 354.0 and 354.1. RESULTS: There were 7,926 incident OCTS claims identified for the years 1984-1988, which yields an industry-wide incidence rate of 1.74 claims/1,000 FTEs. The mean age (37.4 years) and female/male ratio (1.2:1) in this population differ from those reported in nonoccupational carpal tunnel studies (mean age, 51 years; female/male ratio, 3:1). The female-specific OCTS incidence rate increased significantly during the study period. The highest industry specific OCTS rates were found in the food processing, carpentry, egg production, wood products, and logging industries. CONCLUSION: Demographic differences and industry-specific rates consistent with workplace exposures suggest that OCTS is distinct from CTS occurring in nonoccupational settings. Workers' compensation data proved useful in identifying high risk industries. 
Obesity and hypertension. There is a close association of obesity with hypertension through mechanisms not now understood. Hypertension occurs frequently in industrialized societies where weight gain with advancing years is a common feature and is rare in primitive societies where weight and age are negatively correlated. Hemodynamically, obesity is characterized by an expanded blood volume and increased cardiac output. Hypertension results if/when systemic vascular resistance fails to decrease as cardiac output increases. When calorie restriction leads to weight loss, both blood volume and cardiac output decrease; when the blood pressure falls, this is because peripheral resistance is unchanged. Weight-loss programs are helpful for the obese hypertensive because when hypertension is mild, blood pressure often (but not always) normalizes. Also, weight loss has been shown to decrease antihypertensive drug requirements. Interest in obesity-associated hypertension focuses on hyperinsulinemia/insulin resistance as causative factors. Although the evidence is tempting, it is far from conclusive and it seems likely that the mechanism of this type of hypertension is as multifactorial as those of other types. 
Recognizing early Parkinson's disease. Differential diagnosis of Parkinson's disease should cover not only the classic disorder described by James Parkinson in 1817 (paralysis agitans) but also numerous other idiopathic and secondary disorders that have varying degrees of parkinsonian features. Because treatment options can vary greatly among mimicking disorders and differ from those effective for Parkinson's disease, a prompt, accurate diagnosis is essential. Physicians can distinguish between these often-overlapping disorders by differentiating primary from secondary parkinsonism and by classifying primary syndromes into disorders with prominent tremor and those without. 
Maternal plasma level of endothelin is increased in preeclampsia. Endothelin is a potent vasoconstrictor that is reportedly increased in conditions characterized by endothelial damage. Maternal plasma endothelin levels were compared between 27 women with preeclampsia (23 without and 4 with the hemolysis, elevated liver enzymes, and low platelet count syndrome) and 14 women with normotensive pregnancies. The mean +/- SEM plasma endothelin values were significantly higher in patients with preeclampsia uncomplicated by the hemolysis, elevated liver enzymes, and low platelet count syndrome (5.48 +/- 0.30 fmol/ml vs 3.86 +/- 0.28, p less than 0.001). In addition, the preeclamptic group with the hemolysis, elevated liver enzymes, and low platelet count syndrome had significantly higher endothelin levels than those without the syndrome (8.30 +/- 1.62 fmol/ml vs 5.48 +/- 0.30, p less than 0.05). There was no correlation between plasma endothelin values and either systolic or diastolic blood pressure. We conclude that plasma endothelin levels are significantly increased in women with preeclampsia and particularly in those with the hemolysis, elevated liver enzymes, and low platelet count syndrome, suggesting an association with widespread endothelial damage. 
Prostaglandin F2 alpha and indomethacin in hepatogenic pulmonary angiodysplasia. Effects on pulmonary hemodynamics and gas exchange. We treated a 68-year-old man with cirrhosis of the liver associated with moderate hypoxemia. Contrast-enhanced echocardiography revealed late opacification of the left ventricle, and pulmonary perfusion imaging with 99mTc macroaggregated albumin showed evidence of a significant uptake in both lungs and in the liver, spleen, and kidneys. Right cardiac catheterization revealed pulmonary hypotension, low pulmonary vascular resistance, and high cardiac output. We administered prostaglandin F2 alpha intravenously (0.2 microgram/kg/min for 30 minutes) and indomethacin orally (75 mg/day for three days). There was some degree of resolution of the hypoxemia and increases in both pulmonary arterial pressure and pulmonary vascular resistance. These findings suggest that the pathophysiology of hepatogenic pulmonary angiodysplasia is a reversible intrapulmonary vascular dilatation. These conditions can to some extent be modulated by vasoactive substances such as prostaglandins or other eicosanoids. 
Aneurysm or occlusive disease--factors determining the clinical course of atherosclerosis of the infrarenal aorta. Atherosclerosis of the infrarenal aorta results in distinct clinical entities--aortoiliac occlusive disease (AOD) and abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA). Although loss of collagen has been implicated in AAA, collagen accumulation plays a role in AOD. In vivo collagen-gene expression can be assessed using complementary DNA for collagen types I and III alpha-chains. The purpose of this study is to compare total collagen (type I + III) and collagen types I and III messenger RNA in AAA, AOD and normal aorta. Specimens were collected from the infrarenal aorta during operation for AOD (n = 7), AAA (n = 7), autopsy, or organ procurement (normal; n = 7). Northern transfer analysis of total RNA was used to compare mRNA levels for type I and III collagen. After preliminary extraction, specimens were hydrolyzed for hydroxyproline analysis used to calculate total collagen (type I + III). Relative levels of type I (pro-a1[1]) mRNA were greater in both AOD (0.77 +/- 0.35) and AAA tissue (0.94 +/- 0.24; p = 0.6) than in normal aorta (0.02 +/- 0.03). Type III (pro-a1[III]) mRNA levels were also greater in AOD (2.52 +/- 0.19; p = 0.09) and AAA tissue (3.15 +/- 1.3) than in normals (0.97 +/- 0.47). Total collagen concentration was increased in AOD (45.6% +/- 3.1% dry weight; p less than 0.05) but not AAA tissue (27.8% +/- 4%) when compared to normal aorta (34.7% +/- 2.3%). Collagen type I and III gene expression is greater in older, diseased aorta, yet collagen accumulated only in AOD. This implies a similar synthetic response in both AOD and AAA. Thus, proteolytic degradation in AAA appears to determine collagen content and possibly the clinical course of the atherosclerotic process. 
Vascular trauma as a result of therapeutic procedures for the treatment of malignancy. Twenty-two iatrogenic vascular injuries caused by resection of tumors with local recurrences or adjuvant chemotherapy were treated over a 42-month period in 11 female and 8 male patients with cancer (58% had documented metastases). Sixteen of 22 vascular injuries were caused by intraarterial administration of chemotherapy (8 emboli; 8 direct catheter trauma), and six were caused by resection of tumors with local invasion. The injuries were extremity ischemia (15 extremities in 13 patients), pseudoaneurysm (4), expanding hematoma (3 injuries in 2 patients). Twenty-two surgical repairs included bypass of severely damaged arteries in five, embolectomy in five, interposition grafts in three, pseudoaneurysm resection and primary repair in three, primary repair of three vascular injuries, and one patch angioplasty. Leg amputation was required in two patients. Seventeen of 19 patients had successful vascular repairs with resolution of preoperative indications for vascular repair without intraoperative or postoperative deaths. Long term follow-up (mean, 17 months) showed no recurrence of vascular problems; however, two patients died of metastatic cancer at 6 and 24 weeks after vascular repair. This study supports an aggressive approach to the management of vascular injuries caused by therapeutic interventions for malignancy despite the presence of metastatic disease.
