Maffucci's syndrome associated with intracranial enchondroma and aneurysm: case report. Maffucci's syndrome is a rare, congenital mesodermal dysplasia combined with dyschondroplasia and hemangiomatosis. Enchondromatous involvement of the skull bones is rare in this syndrome. A rare case of Maffucci's syndrome associated with enchondroma at the skull base, left internal carotid artery aneurysm, and goiter is reported. Two other previously reported cases of Maffucci's syndrome with associated aneurysms and the present case suggest that Maffucci's syndrome may be associated with aneurysm. 
Myotonia and neuromuscular transmission in the mouse. The role of neuromuscular transmission and acetylcholine receptors in the phenotypic expression of hereditary myotonia was reinvestigated in two mutants of the mouse, ADR (adr/adr) and MTO (adrmto/adrmto). Three neuromuscular blockers, curare, flaxedil, and alpha-bungarotoxin, did not prevent mechanical myotonia of EDL and soleus muscles from the two mutants. Furthermore, electrical myotonia was demonstrated in isolated ADR muscle fibers devoid of nerve endings. We conclude that neither release nor reception of acetylcholine are important for the mechanism of myotonia in mouse mutants. The previously described suppression of myotonic aftercontractions by high concentrations of curare (Muscle & Nerve 1987;10:293-298) could not be reproduced; rather, a prolongation of aftercontractions was found. The other drugs had no significant effect on myotonic aftercontractions. Because neuromuscular transmission is not involved in human myotonias, this result supports the use of myotonic mice as a model, at least for recessive generalized myotonia (Becker). 
Accuracy of computer-interpreted electrocardiography in selecting patients for thrombolytic therapy. MITI Project Investigators. A prehospital computer-interpreted electrocardiogram (ECG) was obtained in 1,189 patients with chest pain of suspected cardiac origin during an ongoing trial of prehospital thrombolytic therapy in acute myocardial infarction. Electrocardiograms were performed by paramedics 1.5 +/- 1.2 h after the onset of symptoms. Of 391 patients with evidence of acute myocardial infarction, 202 (52%) were identified as having ST segment elevation (acute injury) by the computer-interpreted ECG compared with 259 (66%) by an electrocardiographer (p less than 0.001). Of 798 patients with chest pain but no infarction, 785 (98%) were appropriately excluded by computer compared with 757 (95%) by an electrocardiographer (p less than 0.001). The positive predictive value of the computer- and physician-interpreted ECG was, respectively, 94% and 86% and the negative predictive value was 81% and 85%. Prehospital screening of possible candidates for thrombolytic therapy with the aid of a computerized ECG is feasible, highly specific and with further enhancement can speed the care of all patients with acute myocardial infarction. 
In vivo measurements of the fraction of dose of bleomycin labeled with cobalt 57 delivered to human tumors. Concentrations of bleomycin labeled with cobalt 57 (Co-bleo) over time were measured in vivo in 17 patients with 32 sites of lymphoma and 18 patients with lung tumors after administration of the same dose of bleomycin. There were marked variations in individual tumor drug concentrations even among tumors with the same histologic type, indicating that the tumor concentration of this drug in individuals cannot be predicted from the administered dose. Also, tumor concentration could not be predicted from the area under the concentration over time curve (AUC) of Co-bleo in the blood; there was no correlation (r = 0.53) between the AUC and the concentration in the tumor at any point in time between 30 minutes and 8 hours after injection. There was no significant difference in the percent of the injected dose per milliliter (%ID/ml) which was delivered to the tumor when low and high amounts of bleomycin were administered to the same patient. Also, a good correlation (r = 0.88) between the %ID/ml over time was found when injection of low and high doses of bleomycin were compared. The results indicate that using quantitative single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) and a labeled tracer dose it is possible to predict what fraction of the dose of a chemotherapeutic drug will concentrate in an individual patient's tumor in vivo. They also show that, for bleomycin, escalation of dose will result in a proportional increase of tumor concentration. This increase depends on individual properties of tumors which can be measured quantitatively in vivo by SPECT and are expressed as percent of %ID/ml of tumor tissue. 
Miosis and internal ophthalmoplegia as a manifestation of partial seizures. We present a patient whose only physical manifestation of a partial sensory seizure was bilateral pupillary constriction and internal ophthalmoplegia. The onset and offset of each attack corresponded distinctly with an electroencephalographic discharge of the left temporo-occipital region. We propose involvement of a cortical pupillary constrictive center in the temporal-occipital area. 
Non-Menkes-type copper deficiency with regression, lactic acidosis, and granulocytopenia. A 2-year-old girl with granulocytopenia developed fever followed by truncal ataxia and progressive neurologic regression. CT demonstrated symmetric low-density areas in the cerebral white matter. Sural nerve biopsy revealed axonal degeneration. Blood lactate levels were high, and serum levels of copper and ceruloplasmin and urinary excretion of copper were low. Cultured skin fibroblasts showed normal copper uptake. Treatment with oral copper administration normalized serum copper and ceruloplasmin levels, blood lactate levels, and granulocyte count. However, copper levels in the CSF were still low, and the patient showed no clinical improvement. We speculated that copper transport across the intestinal wall and across the blood-brain barrier was impaired. 
Risk factors for candidemia in patients with acute lymphocytic leukemia. Between 1983 and 1987 the overall incidence of candidemia at the Institut Gustave Roussy, a tertiary care referral hospital for patients with cancer, increased from 0.1% (7 of 6,801) to 0.32% (24 of 7,515) (P = .009). Because acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL) was the most common underlying disease in patients with candidemia, risk factors for candidemia were analyzed in this subset of patients. A case-control study comparing the eight ALL patients who had candidemia with 18 ALL control patients revealed that previous bacteremia, prolonged neutropenia, prolonged fever, prolonged administration of antimicrobial agents, treatment with multiple antimicrobial agents, and a relatively high concentration of Candida organisms in stool were significant risk factors for candidemia. In a logistic regression analysis, however, only receipt of vancomycin and/or imipenem was identified as an independent risk factor for candidemia. Further analysis showed that administration of vancomycin promoted proliferation of Candida organisms in the gastrointestinal tract and that this proliferation was associated with an increased risk of candidemia. 
The effects of alcohol on the female brain: a neuropathological study. This quantitative neuropathological study compared the brains of seventeen alcoholic females with twenty non-alcoholic female controls. There was a significant (P less than 0.001) increase in the pericerebral space value (control 9.5; alcoholic 16.3) indicating shrinkage of the brain. Cerebral grey and white matter volumes were determined morphometrically. There was a significant decrease in the cerebral white matter volume (P less than .02) in the alcoholics. The cerebral grey matter volume was unchanged. These changes parallel those described previously in male alcoholics. Further studies will be necessary to establish the relative severity of the brain damage in males and females. 
Perirenal lipoma versus renal cell carcinoma. Pure renal and perirenal lipomas are rare. They arise from renal cortex, capsule, or perirenal tissue, and may be difficult to distinguish from renal adenocarcinomas. We report on a patient who presented with a renal mass that had the radiologic findings suggestive of a renal cell carcinoma, but proved to be a simple lipoma. 
Natural history of recurrent urinary tract infections in women. To evaluate the natural history of uncomplicated urinary tract infections in women, we observed 51 infection-prone women in a standardized fashion for a median of 9 years. During intervals when patients were not receiving antimicrobial prophylaxis, infections occurred at an average rate of 2.6 per patient-year, but the rate varied widely from patient to patient (range 0.3-7.6 episodes per year). Seventy-three percent of the observed episodes were symptomatic, with an 18:1 ratio of cystitis to pyelonephritis episodes. Infectious episodes were strikingly clustered, and rates of infection decreased in the winter months. Antimicrobial prophylaxis was highly effective in preventing acute cystitis, asymptomatic bacteriuria, and acute pyelonephritis, even when used for as long as 5 years. The proportions of infecting strains resistant in vitro to ampicillin (19%-32%) and nitrofurantoin (5%-18%) were unchanged over the 15-year observation period, while resistance to trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole increased in the last 5 years of the study. 
Effect of enalapril on survival in patients with reduced left ventricular ejection fractions and congestive heart failure. The SOLVD Investigators BACKGROUND. Patients with congestive heart failure have a high mortality rate and are also hospitalized frequently. We studied the effect of an angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibitor, enalapril, on mortality and hospitalization in patients with chronic heart failure and ejection fractions less than or equal to 0.35. METHODS. Patients receiving conventional treatment for heart failure were randomly assigned to receive either placebo (n = 1284) or enalapril (n = 1285) at doses of 2.5 to 20 mg per day in a double-bind trial. Approximately 90 percent of the patients were in New York Heart Association functional classes II and III. The follow-up averaged 41.4 months. RESULTS. There were 510 deaths in the placebo group (39.7 percent), as compared with 452 in the enalapril group (35.2 percent) (reduction in risk, 16 percent; 95 percent confidence interval, 5 to 26 percent; P = 0.0036). Although reductions in mortality were observed in several categories of cardiac deaths, the largest reduction occurred among the deaths attributed to progressive heart failure (251 in the placebo group vs. 209 in the enalapril group; reduction in risk, 22 percent; 95 percent confidence interval, 6 to 35 percent). There was little apparent effect of treatment on deaths classified as due to arrhythmia without pump failure. Fewer patients died or were hospitalized for worsening heart failure (736 in the placebo group and 613 in the enalapril group; risk reduction, 26 percent; 95 percent confidence interval, 18 to 34 percent; P less than 0.0001). CONCLUSIONS. The addition of enalapril to conventional therapy significantly reduced mortality and hospitalizations for heart failure in patients with chronic congestive heart failure and reduced ejection fractions. 
Percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty in the elderly: early and long-term results. The immediate and long-term efficacy of coronary angioplasty in the elderly was determined by studying 752 patients greater than or equal to 65 years old and comparing patients greater than or equal to 75 years old with those 65 to 74 years old. The oldest patients were more highly symptomatic, were more likely to be in heart failure, had more multivessel disease and were more likely to undergo multivessel dilation. The immediate success rate of angioplasty was higher in the oldest patients (92.8% versus 82%) (p = 0.0003). The hospital mortality rate was also higher (6.2% versus 1.6%) (p less than 0.001). Long-term overall survival was high. However, long-term event-free survival was lowest in the oldest patients, and recurrent severe angina was particularly common. Thus, in very elderly patients, coronary angioplasty is usually successful, but extra caution is warranted; also, long-term relief from angina is less common than in younger patients. 
Patients with a high defibrillation threshold: clinical characteristics, management, and outcome. Of 125 patients prepared to receive implantable cardioverter-defibrillators (ICDs) with the patch-patch configuration of the difibrillating electrodes, 23 (18%) had high (greater than or equal to 25 joules) defibrillation thresholds (DFTs). These patients had lower left ventricular ejection fractions (27 +/- 12 vs 34 +/- 13; p less than 0.03) and a higher incidence of previous heart surgery (47% vs 19%; p less than 0.01) than patients with normal DFTs but did not differ in age, type of heart disease, incidence of concomitant heart surgery, or use of antiarrhythmic medication. Defibrillators were implanted in 18 of these 23 patients, 12 during the initial surgery and six after repeat DFT testing 2 weeks later. After 22 +/- 11 months of follow-up, four patients with ICDs died (two suddenly, and two of nonsudden cardiac causes). Two patients without ICDs died of nonsudden cardiac causes. Appropriate shocks were received by five patients (29%) including both who died suddenly later. A high DFT may be more common than previously stated. It is associated with poor ventricular function and previous heart surgery. Repeated DFT testing may be useful in some patients. A high DFT does not preclude successful ICD shocks, but other therapies may provide better results. 
Calcium oxalate microcalcifications in the breast. Calcium oxalate calcifications can be difficult to detect with routine histologic procedures. In the reported case, microcalcifications that were evident with radiography of the specimen and of the paraffin blocks could not be detected with light microscopy. Polarized light microscopy, however, revealed the calcifications to be calcium oxalate crystals. Use of polarized light microscopy may resolve radiologic-pathologic discrepancies in such cases. 
Effect of a new monoclonal antibody, TA-2, that inhibits lymphocyte adherence to cytokine stimulated endothelium in the rat. An important event in the migration of lymphocytes out of the blood is their adherence to endothelial cells (EC). In inflammatory sites cytokines activate EC and promote lymphocyte EC adherence and migration. Small peritoneal exudate lymphocytes (sPEL) preferentially migrate from the blood to cutaneous delayed-type hypersensitivity reactions and to sites injected with IFN-gamma, IFN-alpha/beta, and TNF-alpha, rather than to peripheral lymph nodes. The basis of this migration is sPEL adherence to cytokine-activated EC. To study this adhesion mAb to rat sPEL were screened for inhibition of sPEL adherence to IFN-gamma-stimulated EC. One mAb, TA-2, inhibited IFN-gamma-stimulated adherence to EC by 60%. This antibody had no effect on the baseline adherence of sPEL to unstimulated EC. Treatment of sPEL, but not EC, with TA-2-inhibited adhesion. TA-2 also inhibited adhesion to EC activated with mIL-1 alpha, TNF-alpha, and LPS, and the adhesion of spleen T cells to activated EC. The TA-2 Ag was expressed on virtually all lymph node, spleen, and sPEL lymphocytes but sPEL expressed two to three times higher levels than lymph node lymphocytes, and the highest levels were found on CD4+ and CD45R- memory T cells. TA-2 immunoprecipitated a group of four polypeptides with molecular mass of 150, 130, 83, and 66 kDa. Finally, TA-2 inhibited sPEL adhesion to TNF-alpha and IL-1 stimulated human umbilical vein EC to the same extent as an anti-human VCAM-1 mAb, and combinations of TA-2 and anti-VCAM-1 were not different from treatment with either antibody alone. Thus, TA-2 appears to recognize rat VLA-4 based on immunoprecipitation, immunofluorescence, and lymphocyte EC studies. VLA-4 mediates the adhesion of rat lymphocytes to rat microvascular EC stimulated with IFN-gamma, mIL-1 alpha, TNF-alpha, and LPS. VLA-4 is important in the increased adhesion of sPEL to EC and the enhanced sPEL migration to inflammation may in part be explained by increased expression of VLA-4 on these cells. 
The significance of circulating cells carrying t(14;18) in long remission from follicular lymphoma Peripheral blood mononuclear cell fractions from 15 patients in continuous clinical remission from follicular lymphoma for longer than 10 years were examined for cells carrying the t(14;18) translocation using the polymerase chain reaction (PCR). The assay used was able to detect one positive cell in approximately 5 x 10(5) cells (a single 14q+ molecule in 2.5 micrograms DNA). Cells positive for t(14;18) were found in six of eight patients initially presenting with stage III or IV disease, compared with zero of seven of those with stage I or II disease (P less than .05). In two cases 14q+ junction regions were also successfully amplified from formalin-fixed biopsy material obtained at presentation 12 and 17 years previously. In both, sequence analysis demonstrated that the cells circulating in remission belonged to the original clone. These results indicate that cells bearing t(14;18) frequently persist in the peripheral blood in long remission of advanced follicular lymphoma and question the value of their presence as a predictor of relapse. 
Prevention of adult heart disease beginning in childhood: intervention programs. Multiple strategies are available to affect children's cardiovascular health. From clinic-based high-risk counseling to broad-based school or community programs, intervention strategies are being developed and tested to find the most effective means of changing the risk factors of youth to assure a healthier future for our children. Since adoption of new behaviors is improved by consistent messages from multiple sources, a concerted effort is needed. The involvement of health professionals, educators, community organizations, industry, and government together will be important to support the adoption of healthy lifestyles for succeeding generations. Intervention through cardiovascular health promotion for school children may well be the future direction for preventive cardiology. 
A new surgical classification system for shoulder-girdle resections. Analysis of 38 patients. A new, six-stage surgical classification system is described for shoulder-girdle resections for patients being treated by limb-sparing procedures for bone and soft-tissue tumors. The classification is based upon current concepts of oncological surgery, the structures removed, the type of resection performed, and the relationship of the resection to the glenohumeral joint, and it indicates the increasing surgical magnitude of the procedure. Data from 38 patients with an average follow-up period of 4.6 years (range, two to 8.4 years) were analyzed. Thirty-two tumors were in bone and six in soft tissue. Eighty-seven percent (33 of the 38 tumors) were malignant. Twenty-four lesions were located in the proximal humerus and 14 in the scapula. The system permitted classification of all shoulder girdle resections done in this study's institutions. The classification is proposed as a means of establishing a uniform terminology in the comparison of such data. 
Antibiotic prophylaxis of wound infections in skin surgery A controlled prospective study of 2165 outpatients undergoing skin surgery was performed to evaluate the utility and the effects of several antibiotic schedules for prophylaxis of wound infections. The patients were divided into four groups. Twenty-three of the 541 group A patients, given no antibiotics, had wound infections. Eight of the 542 group B patients, given systemic antibiotics from immediately after surgery until the third day, had wound infections. Four of the 540 group C patients, treated only with local sterile antibiotic powder sprinkled into the wound during surgery, had wound infections develop, and only one infection occurred in the 542 group D patients given systemic antibiotics from 2 days before surgery until the second day after surgery. This last schedule was the best for prophylaxis of wound infections in contamination-prone regions. Local antibiotic administration is a simple method for prevention of infections in routine skin surgery. 
Coexistent hemangioblastoma and arteriovenous malformation of the cerebellum. Case report. A case of cerebellar hemangioblastoma and coexistent arteriovenous malformation (AVM) is presented. Angiography displayed the AVM, but histological examination revealed a coexisting hemangioblastoma. Various theories concerning the etiology of this condition are discussed. 
PET study of carbon-11-PK 11195 binding to peripheral type benzodiazepine sites in glioblastoma: a case report. The utility of the peripheral type benzodiazepine site ligand 11C-PK 11195, for imaging human glioma in conjunction with Positron Emission Tomography, relies on a high specific binding of the tracer to tumoral peripheral type benzodiazepines sites. In a patient with glioblastoma, we found that 11C-PK 11195 binding was two-fold higher in the tumor than in normal gray matter and that 30% of tumoral binding could be displaced by a large excess of unlabeled drug. These findings suggest that tumoral retention of the ligand is due, in part, to specific binding. 
Myocardial lactate dehydrogenase and its isoenzyme activities in transplanted human hearts. Lactate dehydrogenase and its heart (H) and muscle (M) subunit activities were studied in right ventricular endomyocardial biopsies from eight transplanted human hearts and compared with five chronically failing hearts and six normal human hearts from brain-dead liver/kidney donors. Of the 17 transplant biopsies (taken 5-95 weeks postoperatively), only two showed histologic signs of chronic rejection: They were excluded from the group analysis. A higher proportion of the M subunit of lactate dehydrogenase (M%) was found in the transplanted and the chronically failing hearts than in the normal hearts, presumably reflecting increased myocardial anaerobic glycolytic stress. In the early post-transplantation period, M% was higher in the transplanted than in the chronically failing hearts. Thereafter M% gradually fell, but had not reached normal levels 1-2 years after transplantation. During that time it was similar to the values in the chronic-failure hearts. In the two biopsies with chronic rejection, M% was nearly twice as high as in contemporaneous biopsies showing mild or no rejection. Monitoring of enzymatic adaptation from endomyocardial biopsies may be of clinical interest. 
Transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation decreases lower esophageal sphincter pressure in patients with achalasia. Vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP) is believed to be an inhibitory neurotransmitter responsible for lower esophageal sphincter (LES) relaxation. In patients with achalasia the concentration of VIP and the number of VIP-containing nerve fibers are reduced or absent. It has been suggested that the response to low-frequency transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) may be mediated by a nonadrenergic noncholinergic pathway in which the release of VIP is responsible for the smooth muscle relaxation. The present study was designed to evaluate the effect of TENS on LES pressure and on VIP plasma concentrations in six patients with achalasia (five female, one male). TENS was performed daily during one week for 45-min sessions with a pocket stimulator that delivered low-frequency pulses (6.5 Hz), at 10 pulses/sec of 0.1-msec duration at intensities of 10-20 mA until rhythmic flexion of the fingers was obtained without producing pain. LES pressure and VIP levels were obtained before TENS, after the first 45-min session, and after a week of daily stimulation. After 45-min, TENS produced a significant reduction (P less than 0.01) in LES resting pressure from the mean value 56 +/- 6.4 mm Hg to 42.3 +/- 6.4 mm Hg; with LES relaxation improvement from 50.6 +/- 3% to 63.1 +/- 3.2% (P less than 0.01). After one week of daily TENS, an additional reduction in LES resting pressure (40.3 +/- 4 mm Hg) was observed (P less than 0.01). 
Epibulbar choristoma and microphthalmia: a report of two cases. The simultaneous ipsilateral presence of an epibulbar choristoma and microphthalmia has rarely been reported. We present two such cases, one of which is associated with bone formation, and we consider a possible pathogenetic mechanism. 
Inflammatory pseudotumor of the choroid plexus in Sjogren's disease. We report an unusual case of inflammatory pseudotumor of the choroid plexus of the right lateral ventricle, manifesting as an intraventricular mass and causing unilateral hydrocephalus in a 48-year-old man who suffered from Sjogren's disease and subacute cutaneous lupus erythematosus. The lesion obliterated the normal choroidal architecture by a mixed chronic inflammatory process that was associated with reactive connective tissue changes. Immunohistochemical studies showed no light-chain restriction in the cells, and residual islands of transthyretin-positive epithelial cells were identified, implicating the choroid plexus origin of the mass. 
An economic evaluation of lovastatin for cholesterol lowering and coronary artery disease reduction. The costs and benefits of cholesterol lowering in the primary prevention of coronary artery disease (CAD) were considered using lifetime lovastatin therapy as the intervention model for adults between 35 and 55 years of age. The analysis projected the benefits of CAD risk reduction using estimates from the Framingham Heart Study. The chosen analytic perspective was that of the patient. For average-risk men with total serum cholesterol levels between 5.69 and 9.83 mmol/liter (220 and 380 mg/dl), the cost per life-year saved ranged from $9,000 to $106,000, whereas for average-risk women, the cost ranged from $35,000 to $297,000 (1989 U.S. dollars). In high-risk men (with smoking habit and hypertension), the cost per life-year saved values ranged from 6,000 to $53,000, whereas in high-risk women the cost per life-year saved values ranged from $19,000 to $160,000. The results were more favorable than those found in previous studies of alternate medication therapies for hypercholesterolemia. Even using conservative parameter assumptions, at least 800,000 Americans aged 35 to 55 years are at sufficiently high risk for CAD, so that the net cost of lovastatin therapy can be favorably compared with other widely used medical interventions. 
Effect of age on use of thrombolytic therapy and mortality in acute myocardial infarction. The MITI Project Group. The findings in 3,256 consecutive patients hospitalized for acute myocardial infarction were tabulated to assess the history, treatments and outcome in the elderly; 1,848 patients (56%) were greater than 65 years of age, including 28% who were aged greater than or equal to 75 years. The incidence of prior angina, hypertension and heart failure (only 3% of patients less than 55 years of age had a history of heart failure compared with 24% greater than or equal to 75 years old) was found to increase with age. Twenty-nine percent of patients less than 75 years of age were treated with a systemic thrombolytic drug compared with only 5% of patients older than 75 years. Mortality rates increased strikingly with advanced age (less than 2% in patients less than or equal to 55, 4.6% in those 55 to 64, 12.3% in those 65 to 74 and 17.8% in those greater than or equal to 75 years). Both the incidence of complicating illness and a nondiagnostic electrocardiogram (ECG) increased with age. In a multivariate analysis of outcome in older patients (greater than or equal to 65 years), adverse events were related to both prior history of heart failure (odds ratio 3.9) and increasing age (odds ratio 1.4 per each decade of age). Outcome was not improved by treatment with thrombolytic drugs, but these agents were prescribed to only 12% of patients greater than 65 years of age, thereby reducing the power for detecting such an effect. 
Resection of intrinsic tumors from nondominant face motor cortex using stimulation mapping: report of two cases. We report two right-handed patients who underwent resection of intrinsic glial tumors from the nondominant hemisphere, face motor cortex. Both patients underwent preoperative assessment with computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging localizing the tumor in the inferior region of the Rolandic cortex. With the patients under general anesthesia and without muscular paralysis, the tumor volume was determined by intraoperative ultrasound and resective surgery accomplished with the aid of cortical and subcortical stimulation mapping techniques. Radical resection of the tumor from the face motor cortex was achieved in both patients. A transient contralateral facial weakness and apraxia were noted in each patient, and this resolved within 6 to 8 weeks following surgery. Removal of intrinsic tumors involving the nondominant face motor cortex may be safely achieved using brain mapping techniques to localize inferior Rolandic cortex and avoid resection of the hand motor cortex and descending subcortical motor pathways. Permanent disability will be prevented due to the bilateral representation of face motor function at the neocortical level. However, due to language localization in cortical zones contiguous with the dominant hemisphere, face motor cortex, we do not recommend resection of this region. 
Transfusion-related chronic liver disease in sickle cell anemia. The medical records and liver biopsies of nine sickle cell patients with chronically elevated liver function tests were retrospectively reviewed to determine the etiology of chronic liver disease. There were eight women and one man with a mean age of 30 yr. All patients had hemoglobin SS. Eight patients were referred for elevated aminotransferases and one for an elevated alkaline phosphatase. Hemosiderosis was present in all of the biopsies. Two patients had cirrhosis. Chronic hepatitis was noted in two patients, and five patients had cholestasis. Two patients had serologic markers demonstrating HBV exposure but no patients were HBsAg positive. Erythrophagocytosis, sinusoidal dilatation, and Kupffer cell hyperplasia were present in all of the liver biopsies. Transfusion-related causes were the most common significant pathologic findings in our patients, and appeared to be the etiologies of chronic liver disease in sickle cell patients. 
Sinus bradycardia related to temporomandibular joint surgery. The carotid artery lies in close relationship to the temporomandibular joint (TMJ). Manipulation of the mandible during TMJ surgery has been observed in several cases to be directly associated with the development of sinus bradycardia as the joint is distracted during arthrotomy and arthroplasty procedures. We report several cases and discuss differential diagnosis of sinus bradycardia associated with positional changes of the TMJ. This report emphasizes the importance to the surgeon and to the anesthesiologist of recognition of this cardiac phenomenon, mediated through the trigeminovagal reflex, to appropriately manage the patients during TMJ surgery. 
Resection of the inferior vena cava or intraluminal vena caval tumor thrombectomy during retroperitoneal lymph node dissection for metastatic germ cell cancer: indications and results. A total of 42 patients underwent inferior vena caval resection (40) or intraluminal tumor thrombectomy (2) during retroperitoneal lymph node dissection for bulky abdominal metastatic nonseminomatous germ cell cancer (7% of all post-chemotherapy retroperitoneal lymph node dissection cases). The 3 indications for vena caval resection included tumor clearance (38%), vena caval scar occlusion (14%) and vena caval tumor thrombus (48%). En bloc vena caval resection to achieve tumor clearance was justified by subsequent nodal pathology (cancer in 63% of the specimens and teratoma in 31%). Vena caval resection in the presence of scar occlusion was de facto required by virtue of its incorporation in the specimen. Vena caval resection or thrombectomy is indicated for intraluminal tumor thrombus because thrombus pathology (cancer 35%, teratoma 45% and fibrosis 20%) reflected nodal pathology in 71% of the patients with cancer, 78% with teratoma and 100% with fibrosis. The complications of vena caval resection were generally transitory. The 71% survival rate justifies this intensive surgical approach because these patients had exhausted all chemotherapy options. 
Effects of embolus size on hemodynamics and gas exchange in canine embolic pulmonary hypertension. We examined the effects of different-sized glass-bead embolization on pulmonary hemodynamics and gas exchange in 12 intact anesthetized dogs. Pulmonary hemodynamics were evaluated by multipoint pulmonary arterial pressure (Ppa)/cardiac output (Q) plots before and 60 min after sufficient amounts of 100-microns (n = 6 dogs) or 1,000-microns (n = 6 dogs) glass beads to triple baseline Ppa were given and again 20 min after 5 mg/kg hydralazine in all the animals. Gas exchange was assessed using the multiple inert gas elimination technique in each of these experimental conditions. Embolization increased both the extrapolated pressure intercepts (by 6 mmHg) and the slopes (by 5 mmHg.l-1.min.m2) of the linear Ppa/Q plots, together with an 80% angiographic pulmonary vascular obstruction. These changes were not significantly different in the two subgroups of dogs. However, arterial PO2 was most decreased after the 100-microns beads, and arterial PCO2 was most increased after the 1,000-microns beads. Both bead sizes deteriorated the distribution of ventilation (VA)/perfusion (Q) ratios, with development of lung units with higher as well as with lower than normal VA/Q. Only 100-microns beads generated a shunt. Only 1,000-microns beads generated a high VA/Q mode and increased inert gas dead space. Hydralazine increased the shunt and decreased the slope of the Ppa/Q plots after 100-microns beads and had no effect after 1,000-microns beads. We conclude that in embolic pulmonary hypertension, Ppa/Q characteristics are unaffected by embolus size up to 1,000 microns. 
Anterograde amnesia with fornix damage following removal of IIIrd ventricle colloid cyst. Two patients developed anterograde amnesia following the apparently uncomplicated transcallosal-transventricular removal of a colloid cyst. Damage to the fornical columns was demonstrated on CT and MRI scans, whilst other memory related structures were entirely normal. Longitudinal neuropsychological evaluation, over 12-24 months, has revealed a very similar pattern of deficit in the two cases: verbal memory has remained persistently impaired whilst nonverbal anterograde memory has improved to some degree. Formal tests of remote public (famous faces and events) and personal autobiographical memory have supported the clinical impression that neither patient has a temporally extensive retrograde amnesia. These findings address the role of the fornix, and the dissociation of memory processes in humans. 
Hypertension in blacks: clinical overview. Although the decline in stroke and other cardiovascular morbid and mortal events has been occurring since the 1940s, the steeper decline since 1968 has been attributed to improved hypertension awareness, treatment, and control. However, in spite of this encouraging trend from the population in general, surveys from the 1970s and our more recent survey from the Maryland Hypertension Program indicate that hypertension control among blacks remains unacceptably poor, particularly in view of the high prevalence. Of special concern are black men, who have the highest prevalence of any group and the poorest control rate (see Tables 6-1 through 6-4). According to Gillum and Gillum, "High rates of non-compliance with follow-up and drug therapy seriously compromised the efforts of community-wide programs. Indeed, non-compliance with therapeutic or preventive health advice is now the major barrier to effective hypertension control in the United States." Impediments to ideal hypertension control in black communities can be divided into three categories 1. Severity of hypertension in blacks. 2. Barriers related to the medical care system, including inadequate financial resources (see also Chapter 5), inconveniently located health care facilities, long waiting times, and inaccessibility to health education, specifically as it relates to hypertension. 3. Barriers related to the social, psychosocial, and sociopolitical environment, which include problems of underemployment, unemployment, racism, and strained racial relationships. In summary, one could say that, in spite of generally improved hypertension control in the United States, the group that has the worse problems (blacks, especially males) is not benefiting as much as the general population. The strategy for treating black patients with hypertension is little different from that applied to all other patients. However, consideration must be given to the patients' lifestyle. The cultural differences in diet especially must be taken into account. Finally, economic considerations must always be an important component in managing black hypertensive patients. For a detailed discussion of treatment alternatives, see Chapter 11. 
Increase in atherosclerosis and adventitial mast cells in cocaine abusers: an alternative mechanism of cocaine-associated coronary vasospasm and thrombosis. Coronary vasospasm has been implicated as a cause of myocardial ischemia and sudden cardiac death in cocaine abusers. However, the mechanism or mechanisms remain unknown. Autopsy records (n = 5,871) from the medical examiner's files at Baltimore, Maryland and northern Virginia were examined and 495 persons (8.4%) were identified with positive toxicologic findings for cocaine. Of these, six subjects (1.2%) had total thrombotic occlusion, involving primarily the left anterior descending coronary artery. The mean number of adventitial mast cells per coronary segment and the degree of atherosclerosis were determined. These observations were compared with findings in age- and gender-matched subjects who died from cocaine overdose and in patients who had sudden cardiac death (acute thrombosis) without a history of illicit drug abuse. There were significantly more mast cells in subjects with cocaine-associated thrombosis than in the other groups. The number of mast cells showed a significant correlation with the degree of cross-sectional luminal narrowing (r = 0.68) in subjects with cocaine-associated thrombosis but not in subjects with sudden death due to thrombosis (r = 0.34, p less than 0.03). Subjects with cocaine-associated thrombosis also had significant coronary atherosclerosis without plaque hemorrhage (five had one or more vessels with greater than 75% cross-sectional area luminal narrowing) despite a mean age of 29 +/- 2 years. These findings suggest that adventitial mast cells may potentiate atherosclerosis and vasospasm, thrombosis and premature sudden death in long-term cocaine abusers. 
Transesophageal Doppler echocardiography of pulmonary venous flow: a new marker of mitral regurgitation severity. Pulmonary venous flow varies with different cardiac conditions. Flow patterns in response to mitral regurgitation have not been well studied, but flows may vary enough to differentiate among different grades of regurgitation. Accordingly, pulmonary venous flow velocities were recorded in 50 consecutive patients referred for outpatient (n = 26) or intraoperative (mitral valve repair; n = 24) echocardiographic examination for mitral regurgitation. Recordings were made of right and left upper pulmonary veins with pulsed wave Doppler transesophageal echocardiography. Mitral regurgitation was graded from 1+ to 4+ by an independent observer using transesophageal color flow mapping. The results of cardiac catheterization performed 5 weeks earlier in 43 of the patients were also graded for mitral regurgitation by an independent observer. Pulmonary venous flow patterns, the presence of reversed systolic flow and peak systolic and diastolic flow velocities were compared with the severity of mitral regurgitation indicated by each technique. Of the 28 patients with 4+ regurgitation by transesophageal color flow mapping, 26 (93%) had reversed systolic flow. The sensitivity of reversed systolic flow in detecting 4+ mitral regurgitation by transesophageal color flow mapping was 93% and the specificity was 100%. The sensitivity and specificity of reversed systolic flow in detecting 4+ mitral regurgitation by cardiac catheterization were 86% and 81%, respectively. Discordant flows were observed in 9 (24%) of 38 patients; the left vein usually showed blunted systolic flow and the right showed reversed systolic flow. In 22 intraoperative patients, there was "normalization" of pulmonary venous systolic flow after mitral valve repair in the postcardiopulmonary bypass study compared with the prebypass study after the mitral regurgitant leak was corrected. 
Excision of exposed cartilage for management of Mohs surgery defects of the ear. Cartilage of the ear is often exposed during Mohs surgical procedures. Fenestration of the cartilage with a skin punch has been recommended to stimulate granulation tissue where the perichondrium has been destroyed. This article describes an alternative method--the excision of a window through the exposed cartilage, fully exposing the perichondrium on the other side of the cartilage. This promotes the rapid healing by second intention or provides a vascular bed for immediate skin grafting. Also, aggressive excision of nonviable cartilage helps prevent chondritis or perichondritis. 
Prognostic significance of a predischarge exercise test in risk stratification after unstable angina pectoris The prognostic significance of exercise testing was compared with clinical and electrocardiographic (ECG) variables in a prospective study of 107 patients with unstable angina discharged from the hospital on medical therapy. During a follow-up period of 12.8 +/- 1.4 months, 10 patients (9%) had a nonfatal myocardial infarction (n = 8) or died (n = 2) and 22 (20%) were readmitted with recurrent unstable angina. The relation between 20 clinical, ECG and exercise test variables and the risk of adverse outcome (death, nonfatal myocardial infarction or recurrent unstable angina) was analyzed using both univariate and multivariate (logistic regression) analysis. Univariate predictors of adverse outcome included diabetes mellitus, evolutionary T wave changes, T wave changes on the preexercise ECG and low maximal rate-pressure product during exercise. Independent predictors of adverse outcome in multivariate analysis included diabetes mellitus, evolutionary T wave changes after admission, rest pain during hospitalization, ST depression during exercise and low maximal rate-pressure product. A predictive model constructed using the regression equation and all independent predictors stratified patients into high and low risk groups (41% and 5% risk of adverse outcome, respectively). The result of a predischarge exercise test adds independent prognostic information to clinical and ECG data in medically treated patients with unstable angina and could be used in combination with clinical and ECG data to identify patients at risk of adverse events. 
The glucocorticoid hormone signal transduction pathway in mice homozygous for chromosomal deletions causing failure of cell type-specific inducible gene expression. Wild-type newborn mice are characterized by the ability of certain liver-specific genes encoding various enzymes and mapping on different chromosomes to respond to glucocorticoid induction. Newborn mice homozygous for deletions at and around the albino locus on chromosome 7 fail to develop this competence for hormone-inducible gene expression even through they do show normal constitutive expression of the same genes. Studies of the glucocorticoid hormone signal transduction pathway reported here show identical expression of glucocorticoid receptor mRNA and protein in deletion homozygotes and normal littermates. Furthermore, the receptor interacts normally with the 90-kDa heat shock protein hsp90. Elevated glucocorticoid hormone levels in newborn deletion homozygotes, most likely resulting from their stressed condition, provide an explanation for the reduced binding activities of receptors reported previously. The elimination of receptors and hormones as direct targets of the chromosomal deletion effects suggests that the failure of inducible gene expression might reside in defective competence of the affected structural genes to respond to the hormonal stimulus. 
Platelet antiaggregate activity. Calcium ions act as a second messenger to platelet agonists, with increases in intracellular calcium bringing about changes in shape, aggregation, and release reactions. Changes in platelet function have been reported previously in migraine sufferers and there is evidence that hyperaggregability occurs during a migraine attack. It was decided to assess platelet aggregation with platelet-rich plasma (PRP) from nicardipine-treated migraine sufferers because dihydropyridine derivatives are known to inhibit adenosine diphosphate (ADP)- and epinephrine-induced aggregation. Aggregation induced by 1.4 mumol/L arachidonic acid was similar in PRP from control subjects and untreated migraine sufferers, whereas 1 or 2 mumol/L ADP-induced aggregation was lower in PRP from migraine sufferers. Treatment with 20 mg of nicardipine three times daily for 2 months significantly (p less than 0.05) increased 2 mumol/L ADP-induced aggregation. It is concluded that nicardipine was acting either on migraine pathogenic mechanisms or directly on the platelets. 
Detection of Epstein-Barr virus sequences in Hodgkin's disease by the polymerase chain reaction. The authors examined paraffin-embedded lymph node biopsies from 65 cases of Hodgkin's disease for the presence of Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) DNA, using the highly sensitive polymerase chain reaction technique. Overall 40% of the cases were positive for EBV DNA; there were no statistically significant differences in the frequency of EBV positivity among the different subtypes of Hodgkin's disease. These results are in agreement with those of previous studies that employed less sensitive detection techniques and suggest that EBV either is present in pathologic tissues only in some phases of the evolution of Hodgkin's disease or is a pathogenetic factor involved in only a portion of cases. 
A comparison of the KTP/532-laser tonsillectomy vs. traditional dissection/snare tonsillectomy. This study compared tonsillectomy by potassium-titanyl-phosphate (KTP/532) laser with tonsillectomy by traditional dissection and snare. Eighty-three consecutive patients who were candidates for a tonsillectomy were randomly assigned to one of four groups in a prospective study. The four treatments were bilateral traditional dissection/snare tonsillectomy, bilateral KTP/532-laser tonsillectomy, left laser tonsillectomy and right dissection/snare tonsillectomy, and left dissection/snare tonsillectomy and right laser tonsillectomy. Intraoperative comparisons were made between the two methods with regard to blood loss and operating time. Postoperatively bleeding and healing time were also recorded. A questionnaire answered on a daily basis assessed the patient's pain. Disadvantages of the KTP/532 tonsillectomy included increased cost, increased total operating time as a result of increased setup time and laser malfunctions, delayed healing, and no statistically significant improvement in level of pain. The sole advantage associated with the KTP/532 laser tonsillectomy was decreased blood loss, which may be significant for patients with a coagulopathy. 
Dipyridamole thallium scanning in the evaluation of coronary artery disease in elective abdominal aortic surgery. Dipyridamole thallium scanning was routinely performed on 68 consecutive patients who presented for elective aortic surgery. All 68 patients were judged by clinical assessment to be at low risk for perioperative cardiac complications. In addition, 42 of 68 patients had a history of myocardial infarction, stable angina, or abnormal echocardiographic findings (group 1). Twenty-six of 68 patients did not have a history of myocardial infarction, angina, or abnormal echocardiographic findings (group 2). In group 1, 34 of 4 patients had positive results on dipyridamole thallium scanning, and 15 of these patients were found to have critical coronary artery disease on subsequent cardiac catheterization; nine underwent immediate coronary artery bypass grafting, and six had their coronary artery disease treated medically and their vascular operations cancelled. The remaining 27 patients in group 1 underwent elective operations, with six (22%) of 27 sustaining postoperative cardiac complications. None of the group 2 patients was found to have critical coronary artery disease. All patients in group 2 underwent aortic operation without cardiac complication. Routine dipyridamole thallium scanning detected a 22% (15 of 68) incidence of critical coronary artery disease overall. There was a 36% (15 of 42) incidence of critical coronary artery disease in group 1 patients vs 0% in group 2 patients (95% confidence interval, 21% to 50%). We conclude that the use of dipyridamole thallium scanning in low-risk patients for cardiac screening prior to elective aortic operations is beneficial in selected patients who have a history of myocardial infarction, angina, or abnormal echocardiographic findings, but is not necessary in patients with no history of coronary artery disease. 
Adhesion formation after ovarian electrocauterization on patients with polycystic ovarian syndrome. The rate of adhesion formation after ovarian electrocauterization has been described in two selective and unselective groups of patients with PCOS. The rate of this complication in the selective group was 0 from 16 ovaries and in the unselective group (5/25). However, the rate of major adnexal adhesion in the unselective group was 1 from 25 ovaries. 
Human fetal hepatocytes respond to inflammatory mediators and excrete bile. Under strict observation of the ethical guidelines of the 1975 Declaration of Helsinki Human Research Committee, primary hepatocyte cultures were prepared from second-trimester fetal liver specimens. We have shown for the first time that fetal hepatocytes have the capacity to produce an acute-phase response on treatment with inflammatory mediators. Addition of interleukin-6 to the cultures resulted in strong induction of C-reactive protein and alpha-1-antichymotrypsin expression, whereas albumin expression was repressed. In contrast to interleukin-6, transforming growth factor-beta did not induce C-reactive protein expression. However, as in adult hepatocytes, fetal cells responded to transforming growth factor-beta by reduced albumin synthesis. We were able to show by virtue of fluorescein excretion into sealed clefts that fetal hepatocytes have the functional capacity to form bile. Our findings indicate that second-trimester hepatocytes can be regarded as fairly mature liver cells. 
Aminoglycoside toxicity--a survey of retinal specialists. Implications for ocular use. Surveyed members of the Retina, Macula, and Vitreous Societies reported 93 cases of macular infarction they believed to be related to administration of gentamicin sulfate; five, to administration of amikacin sulfate; and three, to administration of tobramycin sulfate. Most cases of infarction after administration of gentamicin occurred in eyes that received an intravitreous injection of 0.4 mg after vitrectomy, but a surprisingly high number, 17, occurred after injection of 0.1 or 0.2 mg, doses that are considered safe by many ophthalmologists. Four additional cases of infarction occurred in eyes that did not undergo vitrectomy after injection of 0.1 or 0.2 mg. Four of the five cases related to administration of amikacin occurred after intravitreous injection of 0.4 mg, and one of these four occurred in an eye that did not undergo vitrectomy. Twenty-three cases of macular infarction occurred in eyes that were treated with prophylactic subconjunctival injections of aminoglycosides after routine ocular surgery. Responses from this survey suggest that aminoglycoside-induced retinal infarction is widely recognized and more common than indicated from the small number of cases reported in the literature. The role of aminoglycosides in the prophylaxis of ocular infections and the management of endophthalmitis should be reevaluated. 
Cerebrovascular regulation and neonatal brain injury. Neuropathology occurring as a result of hemodynamic injury occurs in up to 25% of preterm newborns of less than 1,500 gm birth weight and in a much smaller, but nonetheless meaningful, proportion of more mature infants. Abnormalities in cerebrovascular regulation have been proposed as major contributing factors to both ischemic and hemorrhagic injuries in the newborn brain. In this review we explore several factors that play a role in cerebrovascular regulation in the immature brain and relate them to what is known about vascular regulation in the mature brain and to the types of pathology that occur in the newborn brain. One goal in this "decade of the brain" should be to increase our basic and clinical knowledge about the cerebrovasculature of the newborn in order to enhance our ability to predict and prevent perinatal brain injury. 
Emergency intubation for paralysis of the uncooperative trauma patient. The impact of paralysis followed by intubation was studied in patients who had been traumatized and subsequently admitted to Lehigh Valley Hospital Center. Trauma admission records between January 1987 and June 1988 were reviewed. Fifty-seven patients, intubated for control of agitation and combativeness, were divided into high injury severity (HIS) and low injury severity (LIS) subgroups using admission trauma (TS) and injury severity scores (ISS). Thirty-eight (70%) were classified as HIS and 19 (30%) as LIS. All HIS patients had significant injuries diagnosed following paralysis with intubation (PWI). Mortality in the HIS group was 9%. The LIS subgroup was compared to a randomly selected group of similarly injured blunt trauma patients who did not require PWI. There were significant differences (P less than 0.05) in age, hospital cost, hours per day of nursing care, and percent of patients with an ETOH level greater than 100 mg%. Emergency paralysis with intubation is an effective method for controlling the uncooperative, combative, seriously injured patient. However, patients with low injury severity who require restraint have higher costs and require more care if they are paralyzed and intubated than if they are not. 
Ultrasonography in the diagnosis of gynecologic disorders. Ultrasonographic examination is being used with progressively greater frequency as an aid in diagnosis of gynecologic disorders but too often without consideration of whether information other than that obtained from clinical examination is needed and whether ultrasonography can supply it. The size, number, and position of pelvic masses and, in some instances, the type of tumor can be identified, but it is not often necessary when operation is clearly indicated. Ultrasonographic screening for diseases of the reproductive organs has been proposed, but its use for this purpose is limited and it is not cost-effective. It should be used as an adjunct to clinical diagnosis, not as a primary diagnostic procedure. 
Molecular genetic considerations in osteosarcoma. Osteosarcoma tumorigenesis is consistent with a model by which tumorigenesis results if both alleles at the retinoblastoma susceptibility locus (RBI) are altered. Additional genetic evidence strongly suggests that another obligate event in osteosarcoma tumorigenesis is the homozygous alteration of another gene, p53. Both the RB1 gene and p53 have been proposed to act as tumor-suppressor genes, suggesting that, in this instance, tumorigenesis is the result of the loss of gene function of these two genes, rather than a gain of function. 
Risk factors for acute non-A, non-B hepatitis in the United States and association with hepatitis C virus infection. The Centers for Disease Control conducted intensive surveillance for acute non-A, non-B hepatitis in four sentinel counties over a 7-year period. Testing for antibody to hepatitis C virus was performed with the newly developed enzyme immunoassay. The incidence of non-A, non-B hepatitis remained relatively stable (average, 7.1 cases per 100,000, but there were significant changes in disease transmission patterns. The proportion of patients with a history of blood transfusion declined from 17% to 6%, but the proportion with a history of parenteral drug use increased from 21% to 42%. The proportion of patients with histories of sexual exposure (6%), household exposure (3%), occupational exposure to blood (2%), or hemodialysis (0.6%) did not change over time. Antibody to hepatitis C virus was found in 45% of patients within 6 weeks of onset of illness and in 68% of patients followed up for at least 6 months. Patients with no history of transfusions were just as likely to be positive for antibody to hepatitis C virus as patients with transfusion-associated hepatitis, indicating that hepatitis C virus is the major causative agent of all non-A, non-B hepatitis in the United States. 
Update on functional anatomy and pathology of human eustachian tube related to otitis media with effusion. New anatomic and histopathologic information regarding the eustachian tube and its surrounding structure as well as possible mechanisms of opening and closing function and dysfunction are discussed in this article. In the past two decades, much light has been shed on the relationship between anomalies of the eustachian tube and the pathogenesis of otitis media with effusion. Now that a technique for obtaining specimens for any histopathologic study that includes the temporal bone as well as the eustachian tube is available, it is hoped that, by harvesting and examining a large number of such specimens, more information will be gained about the relation between eustachian tube pathology and eustachian tube dysfunction, particularly as it relates to otitis media effusion. Only in this way can the clinical management of otitis media be improved. 
Nucleolar organizer regions in vascular and neoplastic cells of human gliomas. The number of nucleolar organizer regions in vascular cells and neoplastic cells of human gliomas was counted by a combined staining technique: one-step silver colloid method for nucleolar organizer region-associated argyrophilic protein (AgNOR) and periodic acid-Schiff staining for basement membrane of vascular components. The number of AgNORs (mean +/- SD) in the vascular and neoplastic cells of various tumors tested was as follows: benign astrocytoma (Grade 2, n = 4), 1.52 +/- 0.07 and 1.80 +/- 0.13, respectively; anaplastic astrocytoma (Grade 3, n = 7), 1.98 +/- 0.23 and 2.87 +/- 0.50; and glioblastoma multiforme (Grade 4, n = 11), 2.05 +/- 0.29 and 3.13 +/- 1.13. AgNOR scores in vascular cells of benign astrocytomas, anaplastic astrocytomas, and glioblastomas were significantly higher than those of vascular cells in normal brain tissue without neoplastic alteration (1.26 +/- 0.05; n = 3; P less than 0.01, P less than 0.001, and P less than 0.001, respectively). Moreover, the AgNOR scores of vascular cells in high-grade gliomas (Grades 3 and 4) were significantly higher than those in low-grade gliomas (Grade 2) (P less than 0.01). These results indicate that the proliferative activity of both vascular and neoplastic cells in gliomas increased as histological malignancy advanced, and that the quantification of AgNORs was useful in evaluating proliferative activity in vascular cells as well as in assessing the malignancy of neoplastic tissues. 
Immunoblotting and culture positive endocarditis. Serum samples from patients with endocarditis due to Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus agalactiae, Streptococcus lactis and a "nutritionally" variant streptococcus were immunoblotted against antigenic extracts from all five species. In S mutans endocarditis there was an endocarditis specific pattern of IgM against bands of 220, 200, and 190 kilodaltons. In S pneumoniae IgM against antibody of a molecular weight greater than 150 kilodaltons was specific to endocarditis. In S agalactiae IgM against bands at 82, 71, and 66-67 kilodaltons was endocarditis specific. In S lactis endocarditis specific IgM was present against antigenic bands at 105, 66, 61 and 58 kilodaltons. With the "nutritionally" variant streptococcus it was impossible to distinguish between cases of endocarditis and controls. 
Acquired progressive lymphangioma. Acquired progressive lymphangioma is rare and can histologically mimic well-differentiated angioendothelioma. In a 9-year-old boy with acquired progressive lymphangioma, we demonstrated that the neoplasm consists of at least a vascular component and a smooth muscle component. The presence of type IV collagen around many vascular channels suggests that an intermediate stage of differentiation between blood vessels and lymphatics may be present. Our findings indicate that acquired progressive lymphangioma is most likely a complex hamartoma composed of vascular channels and smooth muscle. 
Brachial plexus anesthesia in pediatric patients. Between 1980 and 1988 at our institution, brachial plexus anesthesia (BPA) was used in 109 pediatric patients who underwent 142 surgical procedures on an upper extremity, including 134 axillary blocks. Most patients older than 6 years of age had their blocks and surgical procedures with moderate sedation. The success rate was high--92.4% of axillary blocks and 100% of other blocks were adequate for surgical intervention in patients who required only intravenous sedation. The postoperative course in the BPA group was compared with that in 109 age-matched control subjects who underwent 188 procedures on an upper extremity during general anesthesia (GA). Admission to the recovery room after anesthesia occurred less frequently in the BPA group than in the GA group (27.5% versus 91.0%; P less than 0.01). Furthermore, nausea and vomiting were less frequent in the BPA group than in the GA group (P less than 0.01). Outpatients in the BPA group were less likely to require narcotic analgesics before dismissal than were those in the GA group (12% versus 31%; P less than 0.05). Admission of outpatients was infrequent in both groups (2% for BPA and 9% for GA). No significant difference was noted in 24-hour postoperative narcotic requirements between the BPA and GA groups. 
Massive evisceration: a complication following sacrospinous vaginal vault fixation. This report describes a spontaneous vaginal vault prolapse in association with massive evisceration following sacrospinous vaginal vault fixation. Careful attention to surgical technique is critical to the success of the operation. In particular, good apposition of the vaginal vault to the sacrospinous ligament and adequate repair of an enterocele should avoid this complication. 
Hip disarticulation: factors affecting outcome. Hip disarticulation, especially in patients with peripheral vascular disease, has been associated with high morbidity and mortality rates. This report describes patient characteristics that influence the clinical outcome of hip disarticulation. The medical records of all patients undergoing hip disarticulation from 1966 to 1989 were reviewed for surgical indication, perioperative wound complications, and postoperative deaths. Fifty-three patients underwent hip disarticulation for limb ischemia (10), infection (12), infection and ischemia (14), or tumor (17). The overall incidence of wound complications was 60%, and no significant differences were found among the groups. Prior above-knee amputation and urgent/emergent operations were significantly associated with increased wound complications (p less than 0.05). The overall mortality rate was 21%, ranging from 0% (tumor) to 50% (ischemia) and differed significantly among the groups (p less than 0.02). Mortality was significantly associated with urgent/emergent operations (p less than 0.01). Age, diabetes mellitus, and previous inflow procedures did not influence mortality rates. The presence of limb ischemia influenced mortality rates to a greater extent than did infection, and a history of cardiac disease was statistically predictive of death. Wound complications frequently accompanied hip disarticulation, regardless of operative indication, and were significantly increased by urgent/emergent operations and prior above-knee amputation. Hip disarticulation can be performed with low mortality rates in selected patients. Both limb ischemia and infection substantially increase operative mortality rates. 
Benefit of a stroke unit: a randomized controlled trial. In a randomized controlled trial we compared the clinical outcome of acute stroke patients, 110 of whom were allocated to treatment in a stroke unit and 110 to treatment in general medical wards. No significant difference existed between these groups with regard to sex, age, marital status, medical history, or functional impairment on admission. Outcome was measured at 6 and 52 weeks after the stroke by the proportion of patients at home, the proportion of patients in an institution, the mortality, and the functional state. After 6 weeks 56.4% of the patients randomized to the stroke unit and 32.7% of the patients randomized to the general medical wards were at home (p = 0.0004), and after 52 weeks 62.7% and 44.6%, respectively, were at home (p = 0.002). After 6 weeks 36.3% of the patients from the stroke unit and 50.0% from the general medical wards were in an institution (p = 0.02); after 52 weeks 12.7% and 22.7%, respectively, were institutionalized (p = 0.016). After 6 weeks mortality was 7.3% for the stroke unit group and 17.3% for the general medical wards group (p = 0.027). After 52 weeks mortality was 24.6% for the stroke unit group and 32.7% for the general medical wards group (difference not significant). Functional state was significantly better for patients treated in the stroke unit after both 6 and 52 weeks. We conclude that care of patients with acute stroke in a stroke unit improves clinical outcome compared with treatment in general medical wards. 
Cost and quality trade-offs in the treatment of hypertension. The cost-effectiveness of treatment for hypertension is positively related to the level of pretreatment blood pressure and to the level of success in achieving patient adherence to prescribed medical regimens. Opportunities to improve the cost-effectiveness of treatment include limiting treatment to patients with well-documented sustained increases in blood pressure, giving higher priority to the treatment of patients with diastolic blood pressures of 100 mm Hg and above, and relying on lower-cost medications if clinical responses to treatment permit. In patients with mild hypertension, a comparison of strategies for initiating pharmacological treatment that takes into account potential side effects as well as the costs of medications indicates a difference of $270/patient-yr between the least and most expensive alternatives. Whether the additional costs of more expensive treatment strategies are "worth it" depend on any additional health benefits actually conferred. Moreover, higher-cost strategies may have negative influences on patients' decisions to adhere to prescribed regimens or to continue in treatment. Cost is a particular problem for the treatment of chronic conditions like hypertension because of inadequate insurance coverage for medications, especially for the poor. 
Acupuncture in angina pectoris: does acupuncture have a specific effect? To overcome the methodological problems of blinding the patients and the acupuncturist in acupuncture trials, 33 patients with stable angina pectoris, who were randomized to either genuine or sham acupuncture, received electroacupuncture by another acupuncturist, and the change in skin temperature was recorded. It was found that the change in skin temperature correlated significantly with the degree of improvement following both genuine and sham acupuncture. Fourteen patients with no decrease in skin temperature exhibited a significantly better response to acupuncture than 19 patients who showed a decrease in skin temperature (G II). In the former group, there was a 15% median improvement in exercise tolerance (G II 0%), a 67% improvement in anginal attack rate (G II 38%), and an 84% improvement in nitroglycerine consumption (G II 50%). A significant correlation was found between the duration of disease and the effect of acupuncture. It is concluded that both genuine and sham acupuncture have a specific effect on some angina pectoris patients in addition to the effect of pharmacological therapy. 
Nasal positive pressure ventilation in patients with acute respiratory failure. Difficult and time-consuming procedure for nurses. Intubation and mechanical ventilation are well-established techniques in the management of patients with acute respiratory failure; however, there are situations in which these procedures cannot be used safely for various reasons. A recently described noninvasive technique, nasal positive-pressure ventilation (NPPV), has been developed for home ventilation of certain patients with chronic ventilatory insufficiency. We hypothesized that NPPV could be used in selected patients in whom intubation and mechanical ventilation were clearly indicated, but not immediately possible, or even contraindicated. Six patients were treated with NPPV during an episode of acute respiratory failure and enrolled in a prospective study. We found that NPPV was successful in avoiding intubation, but only in the three patients suffering from a restrictive pulmonary disorder, whereas the procedure was unsuccessful in patients with obstructive disorders. Moreover, in every patient, acute NPPV was very time-consuming for the nursing staff: in patients with restrictive disorders, a nurse had to monitor a patient submitted to NPPV during 41 +/- 9 percent of the duration of ventilation and during 91 +/- 9 percent of the NPPV time in patients with obstructive disorders. We conclude that acute NPPV may be attempted in selected patients with acute respiratory failure, predominantly patients with restrictive respiratory disorders, but that this procedure is very time-consuming for nurses. 
Emergency esophagogastrectomy for treatment of hydrochloric acid injury. Eight patients with severe hydrochloric acid injury of the esophagus and stomach had early esophagogastrectomy. Four patients survived and 6 to 8 weeks later underwent successful substernal colon replacement. The value of early diagnosis and subsequent aggressive surgical management of patients who have ingested hydrochloric acid is stressed. 
Treatment of refractory chronic Lyme arthritis with arthroscopic synovectomy. Of 20 patients who underwent arthroscopic synovectomy for refractory chronic Lyme arthritis of the knee, 16 (80%) had resolution of joint inflammation during the first month after surgery or soon thereafter, and they have remained well during the 3-8-year followup period. Three of these 16 patients who were more disabled preoperatively, still had mild functional limitation at long-term followup. The remaining 4 patients (20%) had persistent or recurrent synovitis. We conclude that arthroscopic synovectomy is effective in treating chronic Lyme arthritis in patients in whom the disease does not respond to antibiotic therapy. 
Ultrasonography in the diagnosis of acute appendicitis. Ultrasonography with graded compression was performed in 525 patients with clinical signs of acute appendicitis. Of 207 patients with surgically proven appendicitis the inflamed appendix (diameter greater than or equal to 6 mm) had been visualized sonographically in 177 (86 per cent). The score for non-perforated appendicitis (91 per cent) was higher than for perforated appendicitis (55 per cent). Twenty-four patients in whom an inflamed appendix was seen on ultrasonography did not undergo surgery because of rapidly subsiding symptoms ('abortive appendicitis'). Four of these 24 developed recurrent appendicitis warranting surgery. Two underwent elective appendectomy and 18 have remained symptom-free. Of 155 patients with a subsequently confirmed alternative condition, ultrasonography made the correct diagnosis in 140: bacterial ileocaecitis (69), mesenteric lymphadenitis (eight), gynaecological conditions (34), urological conditions (eight), caecal diverticulitis (six), perforated peptic ulcer (six), Crohn's disease (two) and miscellaneous conditions (seven). Of 139 patients in whom no definite diagnosis was made ultrasonography showed no abnormalities in 138. In four patients a false positive sonographic diagnosis of appendicitis was made and in two patients with appendicitis an alternative condition was incorrectly diagnosed. During the last 3 years of the study the negative appendicectomy rate was 7 per cent and delay beyond 6 h after admission occurred in only 2 per cent of patients with surgically proven appendicitis. When used to complement the clinical diagnosis ultrasonography improves the diagnostic accuracy and patient management in those suspected of having acute appendicitis. 
Lactose intolerance. Pinpointing the source of nonspecific gastrointestinal symptoms. Lactose intolerance is a common condition that can cause nonspecific gastrointestinal symptoms. A reliable diagnosis cannot be made on the basis of the patient's history. The breath hydrogen test is simple, noninvasive, accurate, and inexpensive and is the diagnostic method of choice. In addition to traditional dietary restriction of lactose, treatment may consist of alterations in dietary fat content or caloric density to reduce symptoms and use of dairy products or additives that provide lactase activity. 
Comparison of speech perception abilities in deaf children with hearing aids or cochlear implants. The speech perception abilities of deaf children with a single- or multi-channel cochlear implant are compared with those of deaf children who derive substantial benefit from conventional hearing aids. The children with hearing aids have unaided pure-tone thresholds ranging from 90- to 110-dB HL through at least 2000 Hz, and aided thresholds of 30- to 60-dB HL. The group data show that the speech perception scores of the subjects with hearing aids were significantly higher than those of the subjects with implants on a range of speech perception measures. Although a few subjects with implants achieved scores as high as those who used hearing aids, the majority did not. Even though the children with implants receive substantial benefit from their devices, they continue to have limited auditory perception abilities relative to their peers who derive benefit from conventional hearing aids. The data highlight the importance of establishing hearing aid benefit in potential candidates for implant. 
Intermittent ischemia potentiates intestinal reperfusion injury. We hypothesized that even brief periods of reperfusion interjected between ischemic episodes would increase tissue injury. Studies were performed in a rat small intestine preparation in which metabolic, hemodynamic, and histologic responses to ischemia have been well characterized. Animals were subjected to a total of 30 or 45 minutes of complete intestinal ischemia. Flow interruption was continuous (C, single episode) or intermittent (I, two or three episodes of 15-minute ischemia separated by 5 minutes of reperfusion). In some experiments 5-minute reperfusions were performed with arterial blood depleted of leukocytes (IL). This additional perturbation was included to determine the role of neutrophils that have been strongly implicated in reperfusion injury. In all three protocols histologic sections were obtained after each ischemic insult and after 1 hour of reperfusion with arterial blood. Villous histology was graded in a blinded fashion with 1 = normal and 5 = severe injury. No significant differences were found between groups in immediate postischemic histologies before reperfusion. After 1 hour of reperfusion, intermittent episodes of ischemia were associated with significantly worse histologic injury than that seen with comparable durations of continuous ischemia (30 min: I, 4.4 +/- 0.5 vs C, 2.7 +/- 0.4; 45 min: I, 4.9 +/- 0.2 vs C, 2.8 +/- 0.3). However, if 5-minute reperfusions were with leukopenic blood, this effect was markedly reduced (30 min IL, 3.4 +/- 0.3; 45 min IL, 3.6 +/- 0.2). Even short periods of reperfusion during an ischemic insult greatly increased mucosal injury. 
Immunohistochemical analysis of estrogen receptors, progesterone receptors, Ki-67 antigen, and human papillomavirus DNA in normal and neoplastic epithelium of the uterine cervix. To investigate the relationship between the sex steroid receptor (estrogen receptor [ER] and progesterone receptor [PR]) status and the cell proliferation kinetics during the menstrual cycle in normal and neoplastic epithelium of the uterine cervix, immunohistochemical localization of ER, PR, and cell proliferation-associated antigen, Ki-67, was investigated in 35 normal cervical specimens, 3 condylomas, 26 cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) samples, and 22 invasive squamous carcinoma samples. The presence of human papillomavirus (HPV) DNA was also studied. In the normal cervix, basal cells were usually ER positive, PR negative, and Ki-67 negative throughout the menstrual cycle. Parabasal cells were ER positive and PR negative in the follicular phase, but ER negative and PR positive, and Ki-67 positive in the luteal phase, and Ki-67-positive cells increased in number in the luteal phase. In contrast, PR positivity was observed in the cells of condyloma (2 of 2 cases), CIN (19 of 26 cases), and invasive squamous carcinoma (13 of 22 cases) irrespective of the menstrual phase. Moreover, most neoplastic cells containing HPV DNA type 16/18 were ER negative, whereas several lesions containing HPV DNA type 31/33/35 were weakly ER positive. Many Ki-67-labeled cells were observed in the neoplastic lesions. These results suggest that reduced ER expression and increased PR expression are associated with the proliferation of normal cervical squamous epithelium, and this proliferation-related receptor status, which is probably induced by HPV infection, is usually expressed in neoplastic cervical squamous cells. 
Maintenance treatment of duodenal ulceration: ranitidine 300 mg at night is better than 150 mg in cigarette smokers. Two hundred patients received either ranitidine 150 mg or 300 mg at night for 18 months to prevent duodenal ulcer relapse. Recurrence rates were lower in patients receiving the higher dose of ranitidine (3.1% v 9.7%, p = 0.78; 6.5% v 16.7%, p = 0.037; and 8.9% v 17.0%, p = 0.121 at six, 12, and 18 months respectively). In patients receiving ranitidine 150 mg, recurrences were significantly more common in smokers than non-smokers after 12 and 18 months, while in patients receiving ranitidine 300 mg recurrence rates were similar in smokers and non-smokers. Ranitidine 300 mg at night abolishes the adverse effect of smoking observed during maintenance treatment with ranitidine 150 mg at night and may therefore be an appropriate maintenance dose for smokers who relapse during standard dose maintenance treatment. 
Primary cardiac sarcomas. In marked contrast to benign cardiac tumors, primary cardiac sarcomas occur infrequently. Moreover, there is no uniform approach to treating such patients, and the benefits of postoperative chemotherapy are unclear. Between 1964 and 1989, 21 patients with primary cardiac sarcomas underwent surgical resection alone (n = 7), chemotherapy alone (n = 1), or combined operation and postoperative chemotherapy based on adriamycin (n = 13). Twenty-four operations were performed on 20 patients with relief of symptoms in all. Eleven patients had complete resection. Operative mortality was 8.3% (2/24). Histology and originating chamber(s) included angiosarcoma (n = 7; 6/7 in right atrium, 1 in left atrium), malignant fibrous histocytoma (7; all in left atrium), fibrosarcoma (2; 2/2 in left atrium), rhabdomyosarcoma (2; 1 in left atrium, 1 in right ventricle), leiomyosarcoma (2; 1 in left atrium, 1 in left ventricle); and one undifferentiated sarcoma (right atrium). Overall actuarial survival was 14% at 24 months after resection. Patients with complete resection had a median survival of 24 months compared with only 10 months in all other patients (p = 0.035). Postoperative chemotherapy did not enhance survival in patients with incomplete resection. At this time, aggressive and complete surgical resection seems to offer the best hope for palliation and survival in an otherwise fatal disease. 
Decreased serum growth hormone-binding protein in patients with liver cirrhosis. The recently characterized GH-binding protein (GH-BP) has an amino acid sequence identical to the extracellular domain of the GH receptor. Serum GH-BP reflects the amount of GH receptors, and the liver seems to be their main source. To evaluate the effect of liver disease on GH-BP, 52 patients with liver cirrhosis were studied. Serum GH-BP was measured by a binding assay with dextran-coated charcoal separation. Levels of GH-BP were correlated against the clinical state, assessed by Pugh's score. The GH-BP of 31 Pugh's class A patients was 9.7 +/- 0.5%/50 microL serum, and that of 21 Pugh's class B and C patients was 7.2 +/- 0.5%/50 microL serum compared to 11.3 +/- 0.5%/50 microL serum in age-matched controls. GH-BP correlated negatively with Pugh's score and serum bilirubin, and positively with serum albumin. It did not correlate with serum liver enzymes or serum insulin-like growth factor-I. Scatchard analysis of GH binding to the GH-BP revealed similar binding affinities in Pugh's A, B, and C patients and controls. The binding capacity in cirrhosis was significantly lower than that in controls. We conclude that serum GH-BP is controlled mainly by the liver and can provide an additional measure of disease severity in liver cirrhosis. 
Teaching intubation skills using newly deceased infants. This prospective study was designed to (1) test the hypothesis that the majority of families of newly dead infants in a tertiary neonatal intensive care unit would consent to their infants' being intubated for teaching purposes, (2) determine factors related to family consent, and (3) determine the effects of participation on resident physicians and respiratory therapists. Family consent for intubation was requested following 44 (80%) of the 55 deaths that occurred during the 10-month study period. Of these requests, 32 (73%) were granted. Proportionately more white than black families consented and consent was positively related to autopsy permission. Fifty-three (75%) of 71 trainees completed a mailed questionnaire after their first intubation experience. Although each respondent found the experience helpful, many reported mixed feelings categorized as doubt about participating, apprehension and discomfort, respect for the body, appreciation for the opportunity, a sense of achievement, and feelings of comfort knowing that consent had been obtained. These findings confirm our initial hypothesis and suggest that (1) newly dead infants can be a valuable resource for teaching intubation skills, and (2) others considering a similar approach need to be aware of and sensitive to trainees' feelings. 
Reflex anal dilatation: effect of parting the buttocks on anal function in normal subjects and patients with anorectal and spinal disease. Anal dilatation in response to gentle parting of the buttocks has been advocated as a sign of sexual abuse in children, but nothing is known of the physiology of this response or its existence in normal subjects, in patients with spinal disease, and in patients with a weak sphincter and whether it can be elicited after training. To answer these questions we investigated the effect of parting the buttocks on anal function. Combined anal manometry and electromyography was conducted in six normal subjects (five men, one woman, aged 19-53 years), in 18 patients with faecal incontinence (three men, 15 women, aged 30-80 years), and in seven paraplegic patients (six men, one woman, aged 25-36 years), in four of whom the posterior sacral roots had been cut. Parting the buttocks in normal subjects reduced the pressure in the anal canal from 102 (20) to 14 (3) cm H2O (mean (SEM), p less than 0.00001), but did not cause the anus to gape. This drop in pressure was associated with increased electrical activity in the external anal sphincter. Normal subjects could consciously relax the external anal sphincter and reduce the anal pressure but not so as to result in anal gaping during traction on the buttocks, even after anal dilatation. Stimulation of the anal lining by moving a probe in and out of the anal canal increased the activity of the external anal sphincter, raising anal pressures. Paraplegic patients who had lost conscious control of their external sphincters showed anal gaping when the buttocks were parted. 
Blood warming: current applications and techniques. Active blood warming is a recent practice and arises out of conflicting needs. On the one hand, the safety and preservation of blood require refrigerated storage and delivery up to the moment of transfusion. On the other hand, modern methods of very rapid transfusion in resuscitation would cause clinically dangerous hypothermia if unmodified, ice-cold blood were to be so transfused. These needs must be reconciled in the interest of adequate patient care--hence the need for blood warming. Nevertheless, blood warming creates risks of its own and should not be used without justifying clinical indications. Within limits that extend somewhat above normal body temperature, the application of heat does no harm to stored RBC, a fact that is not reflected in current standards for blood warmers. Bearing in mind the human tendency to "stretch" standards and the fallibility of mechanical devices, caution is always wise. But perhaps the time has come for reconsideration of the present upper limit of 38 degrees C. Many varieties of blood warmers are available in the US, but none at this time is based on electromagnetic activity. The most common systems now in use are in-line warmers, most of which are not adequate for the type of rapid-transfusion systems currently available. Countercurrent in-line blood warmers and the method of rapid warm saline admixture can both be used successfully for rapid, massive transfusions. Blood warming is seldom necessary or desirable for elective transfusions at conventional rates, even for patients with cold autoagglutinins. 
Echinococcus granulosus cysts in the liver: management with percutaneous drainage. Twenty-one hepatic Echinococcus granulosus cysts (maximal diameter, 7.5 cm +/- 4.0) in 12 patients were aspirated and irrigated with hypertonic (20%) saline under sonographic guidance. All patients had signs and symptoms of a hepatic mass caused by the cysts, which had a prominent fluid component that appeared anechoic or hypoechoic, with marked enhancement of back wall echoes. The amounts of cyst fluid aspirated and of hypertonic saline used were 190 mL +/- 240 and 120 mL +/- 90, respectively. Separation of the endocyst from the pericyst and nonviability of scoleces were observed in all cysts. Mean hospital stay was 4.0 days +/- 3.4. Serial sonographic examinations revealed high-level echoes in the cyst cavity (heterogeneous echo pattern), which ultimately became uniformly echogenic (pseudotumor). After follow-up of 14.0 months +/- 5.5, maximal cyst diameter decreased to 4.1 cm +/- 3.1 (P less than .001). One patient died of unrelated causes; the remaining 11 patients experienced relief of symptoms and a decrease in liver span. 
Reduction of canine myocardial infarct size by a diffusible reactive oxygen metabolite scavenger. Efficacy of dimethylthiourea given at the onset of reperfusion. A number of scavengers of reactive oxygen metabolites reduce myocardial injury when given before ischemia and reperfusion, but few, if any, have proven to be effective when given near the onset of reperfusion. This is particularly true when infarct size is measured after at least 48 hours of reperfusion, when the full extent of myocardial damage has become apparent. Dimethylthiourea (DMTU) is an extremely diffusible, potent scavenger of hydroxyl radical, hydrogen peroxide, and hypochlorous acid, with a long half-life of 43 hours. Sixteen chloralose-anesthetized dogs underwent 90 minutes of left anterior descending coronary artery (LAD) occlusion followed by 48 hours of reperfusion. Collateral flow was measured by radioactive microspheres. Infarct size and risk area were measured by a postmortem dual-perfusion technique using triphenyl tetrazolium chloride and Evan's blue dye. In eight dogs, therapy with DMTU (500 mg/kg i.v.) was given during the last 15 minutes of ischemia and the first 15 minutes of reperfusion. In eight control dogs, the same volume of 0.9% saline was given during the last 15 minutes of ischemia through the first 15 minutes of reperfusion. Infarct size as a percent of risk area was reduced in the DMTU-treated group compared with the saline-treated controls (DMTU = 42 +/- 4% versus saline = 59 +/- 4%, p less than 0.01). 
Mucosal IgA recognition of Helicobacter pylori 120 kDa protein, peptic ulceration, and gastric pathology. The gastric IgA response to Helicobacter pylori was examined in 100 dyspeptic patients by means of immunoblotting of supernatants from antral biopsy and gastric mononuclear cell cultures. 76 of 78 patients with chronic gastritis, 2 of 8 with reactive gastritis, and 1 of 14 subjects with normal mucosa showed positive responses. Of patients with chronic gastritis, 75%, 83%, 97% and 76%, respectively, showed responses to the 120 kDa, 90 kDa, 61 kDa, and 31 kDa proteins. None of the 19 patients with chronic gastritis who did not recognise the 120 kDa protein had peptic ulcers, whereas 25 of 57 with positive recognition had peptic ulcers (p less than 0.001). Mucosal recognition of the H pylori 120 kDa protein was also positively associated with the activity of gastritis (polymorph infiltration) (p less than 0.002) and with the extent of surface degeneration (p less than 0.01). These findings suggest that 120-kDa-positive strains of H pylori have pathogenic features associated with active gastritis and peptic ulceration. Infection with 120-kDa-negative strains may explain why peptic ulceration develops in only a proportion of subjects infected with H pylori. 
Surgical cure of cardiac arrhythmia. 1969. The first surgical procedure undertaken for the intended purpose of curing a patient with recurrent tachycardia was performed by Sealy in 1968, and the report of that operation was published in The Annals of Thoracic Surgery in 1969. The first attempted accessory bundle ablation was successful, marked the beginning of cardiac arrhythmia surgery, and has set the standard against which other methods of arrhythmia control must be measured. 
Traumatic esophageal rupture: unusual cause of acute mediastinal widening. We have presented the case of a 32-year-old man who sustained blunt trauma to the chest in a motor vehicle accident. Plain roentgenograms showed a widened mediastinum and pneumomediastinum, and an esophagogram with water-soluble contrast material showed an esophageal laceration at the T-4 level. 
Prognostic factors in invasive bladder carcinoma in a prospective trial of preoperative adjuvant chemotherapy and radiotherapy Clinical and pathologic factors were analyzed in 40 patients with localized muscle-invasive bladder carcinoma treated in a prospective bladder-preserving program consisting of transurethral tumor resection, neoadjuvant chemotherapy (methotrexate, cisplatin, and vinblastine [MCV]), and 4,000 cGy radiotherapy with concurrent cisplatin. Patients with biopsy-proven complete response after chemotherapy and 4,000 cGy radiation received full-dose radiotherapy (6,480 cGy) with cisplatin. Cystectomy was recommended to patients with residual disease. Distant metastasis rate was associated with tumor stage and size: 0% in T2 patients, 39% in T3-4 patients (P = .035), 6% for tumors less than 5 cm, and 59% for tumors greater than or equal to 5 cm (P = .002). Risk of bladder tumor recurrence was higher in patients with tumor-associated carcinoma in situ (CIS; 40%) than those without CIS (6%; P = .075). Papillary tumors and solid tumors both had similar treatment outcomes. By multivariate analysis, tumor stage T2 (P = .04) and absence of CIS (P = .03) were significant predictors of complete response; CIS was predictive of local bladder recurrence (P = .07); and tumor size (P = .03), response after chemoradiotherapy (P = .02), and vascular invasion (P = .08) were associated with distant metastasis. Six of eight local bladder tumor recurrences were superficial tumors. The low actuarial distant metastasis rate of T2 patients (0% at 3 years), the 3-year actuarial overall survival rates for T2 (89%) and T3-4 (50%) patients, and the similar treatment outcomes for papillary versus solid tumors are encouraging when compared with published historical controls. These results provide preliminary evidence (median follow-up, 30 months) that the current chemoradiotherapy regimen may have beneficial effects in the treatment of muscle-invasive bladder carcinoma. The true efficacy of neoadjuvant chemotherapy remains to be proven by ongoing randomized trials. 
Anaesthetic-induced ventricular tachyarrhythmia in Jervell and Lange-Nielsen syndrome. A four-year-old deaf girl with a history of convulsions developed polymorphous ventricular tachycardia during induction of anaesthesia. The arrhythmia reverted to sinus rhythm spontaneously. Post-anaesthetic ECG showed marked prolongation of the QTc interval (570-690 msec). Deafness and prolonged QTc interval in association with microcytic-hypochromic anaemia confirmed the diagnosis of the Jervell and Lange-Nielsen syndrome. This case report highlights the potentially lethal complication of halothane anaesthesia in patients with long QTc interval syndrome. 
N-(fluorenyl-9-methoxycarbonyl) amino acids, a class of antiinflammatory agents with a different mechanism of action [published erratum appears in Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A 1991 Mar 15;88(6):2612] Several members of a series of N-(fluorenyl-9-methoxycarbonyl) amino acids were found to possess a broad spectrum of antiinflammatory activity. The compounds were active against oxazolone dermatitis in mice and adjuvant arthritis in rats, models in which activated T lymphocytes are implicated. The compounds also inhibited T-lymphocyte activation in vitro, assessed by using the mixed lymphocyte reaction. The compounds inhibited the reversed passive Arthus reaction in rats and arachidonic acid-induced dermatitis in mice, models in which leukocyte infiltration is responsible for the inflammatory reaction. More complete evaluation was made of one compound, N-(fluorenyl-9-methoxycarbonyl)leucine (NPC 15199). On histologic examination after arachidonic acid administration, NPC 15199 was found to block recruitment of neutrophils into the inflammatory site. The compound was not a general myelotoxin. Prolonged treatment of animals did not alter bone-marrow progenitor number or the numbers of circulating white blood cells. Further, several white cell functions were not inhibited in vitro, including neutrophil respiratory burst and macrophage phagocytosis. NPC 15199 was effective in blocking antigen arthritis in rabbits and was effective in a therapeutic protocol, reversing oxazolone edema. These studies suggest that N-(fluorenyl-9-methoxycarbonyl) amino acids may be valuable therapeutic agents for inflammatory diseases. 
10 year review of invasive aspergillosis detected at necropsy. Between 1980 and 1989, 32 cases of invasive aspergillosis were identified out of 2315 consecutive necropsies, an incidence of 1.4%. The incidence in immunosuppressed "high risk" patients was 10.7%. Twenty out of 32 cases showed spread beyond the lungs, with the brain the most common site. There was an increase in cases in the second half of the decade, attributable to the start of a liver transplantation programme. Liver transplant recipients and patients with haematological malignancies were at significantly greater risk of acquiring aspergillosis than kidney transplant recipients or those with solid malignancies treated with chemotherapy. There was also a greater risk of haematogenous dissemination in liver transplant recipients than in all other groups, and this was significantly associated with the use of high dose steroids as anti-rejection treatment. Aspergillus was isolated during life in only eight cases, which indicates a continuing need for and emphasises the value of necropsy. 
Antibodies to cytoplasmic sequences of cloned liver growth hormone (GH) receptors recognize GH receptors associated with tyrosine kinase activity. GH stimulates tyrosyl phosphorylation of GH receptors in 3T3-F442A fibroblasts, and highly purified GH receptor preparations exhibit tyrosine kinase activity. Paradoxically, however, the GH receptor cloned from liver exhibits no sequence similarity to receptors with known signal transduction mechanisms, including those exhibiting ligand-activated tyrosine kinase activity. These observations raise the possibility that there are two kinds of receptors for GH: the first represented by the cloned liver GH receptor, and the second by a tyrosine kinase-containing GH receptor. To inquire into the possibility of two distinct GH receptors, we determined whether the cloned liver GH receptor shares structural similarities with the tyrosine kinase-associated GH receptor. When the cloned rabbit liver GH receptor is expressed in human kidney 293 cells, it migrates with a mol wt appropriate for the tyrosine kinase-associated GH receptor, despite the calculated mol wt of the cloned GH receptor being 60,000 smaller than that of the tyrosine kinase-associated GH receptor. The recognition of tyrosine kinase-associated GH receptor by antipeptide antibodies to three different epitopes on the cytoplasmic domain of the cloned liver GH receptor was also tested. Tyrosyl phosphorylated [125I]human GH-receptor complexes were prepared by immunoprecipitation with phosphotyrosyl-binding antibody; this subpopulation of GH-receptor complexes was recognized by all three antipeptide antibodies. The antibodies also recognized similarly isolated tyrosyl phosphorylated GH-receptor complexes, which had been further phosphorylated in solution on tyrosyl residues upon addition of [gamma 32P] ATP. Furthermore, highly purified GH receptors prepared by sequential immunoprecipitation using phosphotyrosyl-binding antibody and any one of the three antipeptide antibodies incorporated 32P into tyrosyl residues upon the addition of [gamma 32P] ATP. These results provide evidence that tyrosine kinase-associated GH receptors share sequence similarity in the cytoplasmic domain with the cloned liver GH receptor. The cloned GH receptor and the tyrosine kinase-associated GH receptor, therefore, are likely to be the same receptor or related receptor isoforms. 
Malignant potential of the cryptorchid testis. A follow-up study of 224 male patients from Rochester, Minnesota, diagnosed with cryptorchidism during the period from 1935 through 1974 was conducted to assess the frequency of subsequent testicular neoplasms. Age-specific rates for testicular neoplasm in this community were used to estimate an expected number for comparison with that observed. Two malignant testicular neoplasms have occurred in this cohort; thus, the standardized morbidity ratio was 11.4 (95% confidence interval, 1.4 to 41.1). Of the 158 patients born in the community, 11% were known to have birth weights of less than 2,500 g, approximately twice the expected occurrence. Increased risks were also noted for inguinal hernia, hypospadias, Down's syndrome, cleft lip or palate (or both), clubfoot, and congenital heart disease, for which the standardized morbidity ratios were 3.6, 4.7, 17.8, 11.3, 11.7, and 2.7, respectively. The increased risk for malignant neoplasms observed in this cohort of patients with cryptorchidism is consistent with that found in earlier studies. 
An analysis of sequential physiologic changes in hypoxic cor pulmonale during long-term oxygen therapy. Physiologic changes were studied retrospectively in 37 patients with hypoxic cor pulmonale who died during long-term oxygen therapy (LTOT). The subjects were assessed during periods of clinical stability for each year on LTOT. At the onset of treatment, their mean age (+/- SEM) was 60.0 +/- 1.3 years, and at the time of death, they were aged 65.0 +/- 1.3 years. The median duration of LTOT was five years. For each year leading up to death, mean values of FEV1, PaO2, and PaCO2 were obtained. A rate of decline of FEV1 of 73 +/- 10 ml/yr was observed, and this was accompanied by a decline in PaO2 of 0.47 +/- 0.01 kPa/yr. Patients died with a mean FEV1 of 0.55 +/- 0.04 L and a PaO2 of 5.1 +/- 0.2 kPa. A small rise in PaCO2 occurred, on average 0.25 +/- 0.09 kPa/yr, throughout the study, but accelerating in many cases during the three years before death. Hypoxic cor pulmonale appears to be associated with a rapid deterioration in airway function, a steady decline in PaO2, and a slow rise in PaCO2 during the years leading up to death. These physiologic changes measured in a stable clinical state while breathing air appear to occur in spite of LTOT. The LTOT may merely prevent death from episodes of severe hypoxemia while the pathophysiologic changes in the lung progress. Hence the benefit to be expected from LTOT is only temporary. Generally, those patients with lower levels of FEV1 will obtain diminishing clinical benefit, inversely related to the severity of airflow obstruction at the time of commencement of LTOT. 
Non-infective verrucous endocarditis in a patient with 'primary' antiphospholipid syndrome. A 27-year-old women with 'primary' antiphospholipid syndrome, who developed a haemodynamically significant non-infective verrucous endocarditis is reported. Her mother suffered from antiphospholipid syndrome associated with systemic lupus erythematosus. A pathogenetic role of antiphospholipid antibodies in heart valve lesions is suggested. 
Homozygous prion protein genotype predisposes to sporadic Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease [published erratum appears in Nature 1991 Aug 8;352(6335):547] The human prion diseases, Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD) and Gerstmann-Straussler syndrome (GSS), are neurodegenerative diseases that are unique in being both infectious and genetic. Transmission of both diseases and the animal spongiform encephalopathies (for example, scrapie and bovine spongiform encephalopathy) to experimental animals by intracerebral inoculation with brain homogenates is well documented. Despite their experimental transmissibility, missense and insertional mutations in the prion protein gene are associated with both GSS and familial CJD, demonstrating that the human familial cases are autosomal dominant diseases. More than 80% of CJD cases occur sporadically, however, and are not known to be associated with mutations. Here we report that 21 of 22 sporadic CJD cases and a further 19 of 23 suspected sporadic CJD cases are homozygous at the polymorphic amino-acid residue 129; 51% of the normal population are heterozygous at this site. We argue that homozygosity predisposes towards sporadic CJD and that this directly supports the hypothesis that interaction between prion protein molecules underlies the disease process. 
Radiation therapy for primary carcinoma of the extrahepatic biliary system. An analysis of 63 cases. From 1976 to 1988, 63 patients received radiation therapy for primary cancers of the extrahepatic biliary system (eight gallbladder and 55 extrahepatic biliary duct). Twelve patients underwent orthotopic liver transplantation. Chemotherapy was administered to 13 patients. Three patients underwent intraluminal brachytherapy alone (range, 28 to 55 Gy). Sixty patients received megavoltage external-beam radiation therapy (range, 5.4 to 61.6 Gy; median, 45 Gy), of whom nine received additional intraluminal brachytherapy (range, 14 to 45 Gy; median, 30 Gy). The median survival of all patients was 7 months. Sixty patients died, all within 39 months of radiation therapy. One patient is alive 11 months after irradiation without surgical resection, and two are alive 50 months after liver transplantation and irradiation. Symptomatic duodenal ulcers developed after radiation therapy in seven patients but were not significantly related to any clinical variable tested. Extrahepatic biliary duct cancers, the absence of metastases, increasing calendar year of treatment, and liver transplantation with postoperative radiation therapy were factors significantly associated with improved survival. 
Correlation of the antiproliferative effect and the Mx-homologous protein induction by IFN in patients with malignant melanoma. The human interferon-induced intracellular protein homologous to the murine Mx-protein has recently been identified by means of a specific monoclonal antibody. Three of six melanoma cell lines elicited this intracellular human Mx-homolog upon incubation with IFN-alpha or IFN-gamma, yet all six melanoma cell lines tested were susceptible to the antiproliferative effect of IFN-alpha and IFN-gamma. Compared per antiviral unit, IFN-gamma had weaker Mx-inducing but stronger antiproliferative activity than IFN-alpha. These data suggest that the IFN-induced Mx-homologous protein is not involved in the antiproliferative action of IFN on malignant melanoma cell lines. Furthermore, 51 patients with advanced malignant melanoma were treated thrice weekly with 10 x 10(6) IU rIFN-alpha-2b and 6 x 10(6) nIFN-alpha, respectively. Nine of the 51 patients experienced systemic objective tumor responses (3 complete response, 6 partial response), but had Mx concentrations in their mononuclear cells equal to the Mx levels of non-responders during IFN-alpha therapy. Therefore, the level of Mx-homologous protein induced during IFN therapy is not a predictive marker for an antitumor response in malignant melanoma. 
A preliminary report of ticarcillin and clavulanate versus triple antibiotic therapy in children with ruptured appendicitis. Standard therapy for childhood ruptured appendicitis includes combination antibiotic therapy with ampicillin, gentamicin and clindamycin. Complicated dosing schedules and the possibility of aminoglycoside toxicity make alternatives desirable. One such alternative is Timentin (a combination agent of ticarcillin disodium and clavulanate potassium). This agent has a more convenient dose schedule than standard therapy and eliminates the possibility of aminoglycoside ototoxicity and nephrotoxicity. It is active in vitro against most pathogens associated with ruptured appendicitis in children. The preliminary results of an ongoing prospective, open label, randomized trial comparing ticarcillin and clavulanate with ampicillin, gentamicin and clindamycin in childhood ruptured appendicitis are reported herein. While further evaluation is necessary, we have found single agent therapy with ticarcillin and clavulanate to be equivalent in safety and efficacy to standard combination therapy. Also discussed are the relative merits of immediate versus delayed primary closure of the abdominal wound after appendectomy. 
Spondyloepiphyseal dysplasia congenita. Caesarean section under epidural anaesthesia. Spondyloepiphyseal dysplasia congenita is a rare condition with several features of concern to the anaesthetist. The patients are of extremely short stature and the presence of kyphoscoliosis may lead to significant respiratory impairment. Cervical vertebral body changes can result in spinal cord compression and laryngotracheal stenosis may be present. The management of such a patient presenting for elective Caesarean section under epidural anaesthesia is described. 
Peripheral odontogenic fibroma: a clinicopathologic study. The clinicopathologic features of 30 cases of peripheral odontogenic fibroma are reviewed. The age distribution is wide (11 to 76 years), and there is a slight predilection for males. The majority of the lesions (93%) occurred in blacks on the attached gingiva, and with equal frequency in the maxilla and mandible. Size varied between 1 and 3 cm in diameter. One case recurred after 14 months. Histologically, the lesions are nonencapsulated and poorly delineated. The amount of odontogenic epithelium varies considerably and consists usually of small islands or strands, although larger follicles are sometimes present. In one case the epithelial cells had a clear cytoplasm, whereas in another it was granular and eosinophilic. Origin from the surface oral mucosa can sometimes be seen. The connective tissue component is usually cellular, but collagenous, myxomatous, and mixed forms occur. Calcifications were present in 22 cases and consisted of tissue interpreted as either dentinoid, cementum, bone, or dystrophic calcific material. 
Early constrictive pericarditis and anemia after Dressler's syndrome and inferior wall myocardial infarction. Early constrictive pericarditis and anaemia developed in a 52 year old man after he had an inferior wall myocardial infarction complicated by Dressler's syndrome. Total pericardiectomy at the time of coronary artery bypass surgery resulted in complete resolution of signs and symptoms. 
Spontaneous hepatic copper accumulation in Long-Evans Cinnamon rats with hereditary hepatitis. A model of Wilson's disease. Long-Evans Cinnamon (LEC) rats, an inbred strain of a mutant rat isolated from Long-Evans rats, develop hereditary hepatitis. To elucidate the role of copper metabolism in the development of the hepatitis in LEC rats, we examined the copper concentration in the tissues and serum levels of copper and ceruloplasmin. Copper concentration in the liver of LEC rats was over 40 times that of normal Long-Evans Agouti (LEA) rats, while the serum ceruloplasmin and copper concentrations in LEC rats decreased significantly. The hepatocytes of LEC rats show steatosis in cytoplasm and pleomorphism of mitochondria, resembling the histologic features of the liver in Wilson's disease. These findings suggest that the hereditary hepatitis in LEC rats is closely associated with copper toxicity, and may be dealing with a rat form of Wilson's disease. Thus the LEC rats will provide a unique and useful animal model for clarifying the mechanism and for developing treatment strategies for Wilson's disease and other abnormal copper metabolism in humans. 
Dietary fiber and bowel function in tube-fed patients. In tube-fed patients, dietary fiber is often used to manage constipation/diarrhea. Dietary fiber consists of water-soluble and insoluble plant compounds that are resistant to digestion by small-bowel enzymes but are fermented to varying degrees by colonic bacteria. Many physiologic effects of fiber may be related to the degree of fermentation. Few controlled studies of fiber-containing tube feedings have been performed. These studies have limitations and are nondefinitive as to whether fiber prevents or controls constipation/diarrhea. Constipation in tube-fed patients has not been shown to respond to mixed soluble/insoluble fiber in the few studies performed to date. Likewise, fiber may be of only limited benefit in controlling diarrhea in acute illness because of such factors as stress or medication. Fiber does play a role in maintaining gut integrity in all patients, whether they have diarrhea or not. Fiber may be recommended as part of a standard tube-feeding regimen to help assure gut mucosal integrity but not specifically to treat constipation/diarrhea. Further studies are necessary before the role of fiber in the management of constipation/diarrhea in tube-fed patients is determined. 
Interrelationship of blood transfusion, non-A, non-B hepatitis and hepatocellular carcinoma: analysis by detection of antibody to hepatitis C virus. To clarify the relationship between hepatitis C virus infection and the development of hepatocellular carcinoma as sequelae of non-A, non-B posttransfusion hepatitis, 231 patients with chronic non-A, non-B hepatitis (96 with chronic hepatitis, 81 with cirrhosis and 54 with hepatocellular carcinoma) were analyzed for antibody to hepatitis C virus and were compared with 125 patients with chronic hepatitis B (50 with chronic hepatitis, 46 with cirrhosis and 29 with hepatocellular carcinoma). Antibody to hepatitis C virus was detected in 89.6%, 86.4% and 94.4% of patients with non-A, non-B hepatitis-related chronic hepatitis, cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma, respectively, compared with 6%, 17.4% and 34.5% with similar diseases related to hepatitis B. A history of transfusion was documented in 52%, 33% and 42% of anti-hepatitis C virus-positive cases of chronic hepatitis, cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. The mean intervals between the date of transfusion and the date of diagnosis of anti-hepatitis C virus-positive chronic hepatitis, cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma were 10, 21.2 and 29 yr, respectively. In 21 patients with transfusion-associated hepatocellular carcinoma, anti-hepatitis C virus was present in each serial sample available for testing, including samples obtained up to 14 yr before the diagnosis of hepatocellular carcinoma. These data suggest the slow, sequential progression from acute hepatitis C virus-related non-A, non-B hepatitis through chronic hepatitis and cirrhosis to hepatocellular carcinoma and support a causal association between hepatitis C virus and hepatocellular carcinoma. 
Efficient management of adrenal tumors. A retrospective analysis was carried out on 121 patients with primary adrenal tumors operated on at 2 Vancouver hospitals between the years 1970 and 1990. The purpose of the study was to identify discriminating factors between the various diagnoses in order to minimize both the time and the cost of the investigative process. There were 57 cortical adenomas, 35 pheochromocytomas, 15 carcinomas, 8 cases of cortical hyperplasia, and 6 miscellaneous tumors. The mean time from the onset of symptoms to diagnosis of those patients presenting with an identifiable syndrome was 48.3 months. Those with a hypertensive syndrome presented significantly later than those with Cushing's syndrome (57.7 months versus 22.8 months, p less than 0.01). There was a significant delay in diagnosis in those patients with hypertension on the basis of an aldosteronoma as compared with those with hypertension secondary to a pheochromocytoma (75.4 months versus 36.1 months, p = 0.02). Cortical carcinomas were significantly larger than benign cortical tumors (12.7 cm versus 5.5 cm). No malignant neoplasm measured less than 5 cm in diameter. Diagnostic sensitivity for intravenous pyelogram (IVP) was 59%, for ultrasound 71%, for venography 50%, for meta-iodobenzylguanidine (MIGB) (pheochromocytoma only) 80%, and for angiography 70%. However, for those patients with adrenal carcinomas, angiography was positive in 100% of cases. Computed tomography (CT) was the most sensitive localizing investigation with a sensitivity of 98%. While other localizing techniques were less sensitive than CT, they may still play a useful role in selected situations. Factors causing delay in diagnosis and the role of the various imaging modalities are discussed. 
Epicardial coronary artery tone and reactivity in patients with normal coronary arteriograms and reduced coronary flow reserve (syndrome X) The vasomotor response of proximal and distal angiographically normal coronary artery segments was studied in 12 patients with syndrome X, 17 age- and gender-matched patients with chronic stable angina and 10 control subjects with atypical chest pain and a normal coronary arteriogram. Ergonovine (300 micrograms by intravenous injection) and isosorbide dinitrate (1 mg by intracoronary injection) were administered to all patients. Computerized coronary artery diameter measurement (angiographically normal segments only) was carried out before and after the administration of ergonovine and nitrate. Baseline intraluminal diameters (mean +/- SEM) of proximal and distal coronary segments were not significantly different in control subjects and patients with syndrome X or coronary artery disease (proximal 2.88 +/- 0.19, 3.01 +/- 0.13 and 2.86 +/- 0.13 mm; distal 1.57 +/- 0.09, 1.70 +/- 0.10 and 1.61 +/- 0.06 mm, respectively). With ergonovine, proximal segments constricted by 10 +/- 2%, 7 +/- 2% and 11 +/- 3% and distal segments by 12 +/- 3%, 14 +/- 3% and 14 +/- 2% in control subjects and patients with syndrome X or coronary artery disease, respectively (p = NS). With isosorbide dinitrate, proximal coronary segments dilated by 11 +/- 2%, 10 +/- 2% and 8 +/- 2% (p = NS) and distal segments by 15 +/- 2%, 11 +/- 3% and 13 +/- 2% (p = NS) in control subjects and patients with syndrome X or coronary artery disease, respectively. Within groups, constriction in response to ergonovine and dilation in response to nitrate were not significantly different in proximal and distal segments. 
Safety of alcohol after viral hepatitis. To test the validity of the generally held belief that moderate consumption of alcohol during convalescence from acute viral hepatitis adversely affects outcome, 87 adults recovering from acute viral hepatitis (hepatitis A in 36, hepatitis B in 34, hepatitis non-A, non-B in 17) were studied. Criteria for entry to the study attempted to ensure that no patient was a chronic hepatitis B carrier. Patients were randomised either to a moderate alcohol intake, or to continued complete abstention. Drinkers consumed 26 g alcohol daily (mean) and none remained abstinent. At 3 months all patients were well, with normal liver function tests. There were no significant differences between the two groups at anytime. The findings suggest that moderate alcohol intake during convalescence from acute viral hepatitis does not seem to be harmful. 
Involvement of the retinoblastoma gene in primary osteosarcomas and other bone and soft-tissue tumors. The retinoblastoma (Rb) gene, thought by some to be associated with tumor formation of retinoblastoma as a recessive human oncogene, was investigated in 57 cases using DNA and RNA from primary osteosarcomas and other bone and soft-tissue tumors. Eight of 23 osteosarcoma cases (35%) showed structural alterations of the Rb gene. Three of the eight demonstrated homozygous deletions, and the remaining five cases showed heterozygous deletions. Seven out of eight cases represented deletion of a 7.5-kb HindIII fragment. Northern blot analysis of five cases of osteosarcoma showed that four demonstrated no detectable Rb gene transcription, and one case had a truncated 3.5-kb fragment with a faint 4.7-kb band. In the other 34 cases of bone and soft-tissue tumors, two cases of three malignant fibrous histiocytomas showed an Rb gene abnormality by Southern blot analysis. These results strongly suggest that Rb gene alteration is pertinent to the tumorigenesis of most osteosarcoma cases and some other bone and soft-tissue tumors. 
Identification of alloimmunized patients: use of radiolabeled allogeneic platelet kinetic measurements and platelet antibody tests. In a group of stable, nonthrombocytopenic leukemia patients awaiting bone marrow transplantation, results of paired allogeneic radiolabeled platelet kinetic measurements were correlated with the results of several different platelet and lymphocytotoxic antibody tests to determine which parameters could be used to identify patients who were alloimmunized to platelets. Seven patients with acute leukemia who had been transfused during induction therapy were used as the test group, and, as a control group, five untransfused patients with chronic myelogenous leukemia were also studied. Concurrent fibrinogen survival measurements were performed in all patients to assess whether hemostatic factor consumption (ie, disseminated intravascular coagulation) was present. Allogeneic platelet survival measurements were reduced from normal in all 12 study patients. In 8 of 12 patients, fibrinogen and platelet survival measurements were comparably reduced, suggesting disease-related platelet consumption. In four heavily transfused patients with acute leukemia, allogeneic platelet survivals were markedly reduced to less than or equal to 2.1 days, compared with the 3.5- to 7.4-day platelet survival measurements found in the other eight patients. The disproportionately short platelet survivals compared with fibrinogen survival measurements in these four patients, combined with documented positive antibody tests to their donors' platelets in the three patients with evaluable tests, suggested that these patients had become alloimmunized to platelets because of their prior transfusions. There was substantial concordance between the two radiolabeled allogeneic donor platelet survival measurements performed in each of these patients, suggesting that host rather than donor factors have a major influence on transfusion outcome (r = .93, P less than .001). The platelet cross-match tests, using the radiolabeled protein Staph A assay combined with the IgG enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay test, had the best correlation with the posttransfusion recovery and survival of the donors' platelets. 
Comparison of IgG antibody profiles by immunoblotting in patients with acute and previous Toxoplasma gondii infection. The IgG antibody profile to Toxoplasma gondii proteins of less than 37 kilodaltons in sera from patients with acute and previous infection was studied by immunoblotting. Bands at 28, 29, and 36 kilodaltons were more common in acute infection (10 out of 10, nine out of 10, and nine out of 10, respectively) compared with previous infection (five out of 10, four out of 10, and one out of 10, respectively). The 6 kilodalton band was present in 10 out of 10 sera from patients with acute infection and five out of 10 sera from those with previous infection. A new observation is a doublet of bands of 22-25 kilodaltons present only in sera from patients with acute infection. This doublet may be a more reliable indicator of acute infection than the 6 kilodalton band. 
Effect of enteral nutrition on exocrine pancreatic function. Twelve patients with chronic pancreatitis underwent a pancreatoduodenectomy in which the pylorus was preserved. The effects of parenteral and enteral nutrition on pancreatic secretion were compared. Postoperative nutrition was administered by needle-catheter jejunostomy in seven patients and by total parenteral nutrition in five patients. Pancreatic juice, drained directly from the pancreatic duct, was collected in 4-hour fractions. Volume, bicarbonate, protein, amylase, and chymotrypsin were measured. In the first two postoperative days, there was a slow increase in all measured indices. On the third postoperative day, an abrupt rise occurred, after which pancreatic secretion stabilized. No differences in exocrine pancreatic secretion were observed between the enteral and parenteral methods of feeding. 
Cytogenetic abnormalities associated with renal cell carcinoma. Cytogenetic analysis was performed on 23 renal cell carcinomas (21 sporadic and 2 associated with von Hippel-Lindau's disease). Clonal chromosomal abnormalities were found in 19 of 21 of the sporadic tumors. The most frequent abnormalities were a loss or rearrangement of material in 3p (11 of 21 cases) or an extra chromosome 7 (7 of 21 cases). Correlation between specific chromosomal abnormalities and clinical presentation was absent with the exception of trisomy 7 and -Y, which occurred only in patients more than 60 years old. An increasing number of cytogenetic abnormalities were associated with a greater likelihood of renal vein and/or capsule involvement. Both patients with von Hippel-Lindau's disease had tumors with a normal karyotype. 
Endothoracic endoesophageal pull-through operation. A new approach to cancers of the esophagus and proximal stomach. Many thoracic surgeons have expressed concern about the complications inherent in transhiatal esophagectomy without thoracotomy. The technique of endothoracic endoesophageal pull-through uses a mucosal coring of normal esophagus beyond the tumor and leaves a muscular tube through which the substitute organ is passed. Mediastinal hemorrhage, tracheal injury, and chylothorax are eliminated. 
Effect of anticoagulant on biocompatibility in membrane plasmapheresis. The effect of heparin or citrate anticoagulation on blood cellular, complement pathway and coagulation pathway was investigated in a membrane plasma exchange procedure. Two membrane plasma separators constructed of cellulose di-acetate (CA) and polyvinyl chloride (PVC) were evaluated with heparin or citrate alone for anticoagulation in a 26 year old male with myasthenia gravis. Maximum white blood cell counts decrease was 21% at 30 min for the CA with heparin while no decrease was observed for the other schemes. Platelet counts changes were comparable between heparin and citrate, while the PVC groups showed less changes than the CA groups. The CA groups, regardless of the type of anticoagulant used, indicated that complement activation occurred via the classical pathway within the module in addition to the activation via alternative pathway for the CA with heparin. In the PVC groups, complement activation was noted to occur only when heparin was used for anticoagulation. PT and PTT showed slight increases with citrate, while they were remarkably prolonged with heparin. Citrate showed less changes in cellular and humoral factors compared to heparin. CA with heparin was the most activating combination of membrane material and anticoagulant, while the PVC with citrate was the least activating combination. 
An innovative method for neuraxis radiotherapy using partial transmission block technique. Whole CNS (neuraxis) radiotherapy is an important part of therapy for certain CNS tumours which seed via the CSF. Many, if not the majority, of these predominantly young patients are cured but the neuropsychometric, neuroendocrine and growth morbidity of neuraxis radiotherapy on children by conventional methods may be considerable; patients receiving such therapy at an early age often are eventually in the educationally subnormal category. Recent radiobiological data support the concept that all aspects of CNS radiation tolerance are heavily dependent on daily fraction size. We describe a new radiotherapy technique that allows lower daily fraction sizes to be delivered to the neuraxis without prejudicing the total dose to the neuraxis or primary area and without prolonging the overall treatment time. Published radiobiological data support the concept that all the major morbidities attributed to conventional neuraxis radiotherapy will be reduced by the currently described technique without reducing tumour control rates. 
Surgical anatomy of the sacrum. A guide for rational screw fixation. Anterior sacral anatomy was studied to allow safe sacral screw placement. The study included 27 bony sacra. Intrapelvic dissections were performed. Cadaveric specimens were dissected and photographed. The position and angulation of the first sacral foramen was extremely variable. After the position of the L5 root, sacral roots, and iliac vessels, was considered, safe posterior sacral screw implantation could be assured through placement above the level of the first sacral foramen directed medially toward the promontory, parallel to the superior sacral end-plate. Complications of indiscriminate screw placement included L5-root damage, iliac vein penetration, and intractable perineal pain due to sacral root injury. Preoperative computed tomography with the scanner gantry tilted to parallel the superior sacral end-plate defined the great vessels, neural foramens, inclination of the superior sacral end-plate, and prominence of the posterior ileum. Surgical accuracy was evaluated after surgery with computed tomography. 
Facial resurfacing in xeroderma pigmentosum with monoblock full-thickness skin graft. A case of xeroderma pigmentosum with multiple skin tumors on the face that was treated with total excision and replacement of face skin except the eyelids with a monoblock full-thickness abdominal skin graft is reported. The quality and tumor-free features of the monoblock full-thickness skin graft in xeroderma pigmentosum are indicated. Despite the increased morbidity of the donor region, the radical surgical approach advocated here has improved the prognosis in the case reported. 
Comparison of dexamethasone and ondansetron in the prophylaxis of emesis induced by moderately emetogenic chemotherapy. A multicentre, randomised, double-blind, cross-over trial was done to compare the efficacy and safety of a serotonin receptor antagonist--ondansetron--and dexamethasone in the prophylaxis of acute and delayed emesis and nausea induced by moderately emetogenic non-platinum-containing chemotherapy regimens. Patients were treated as outpatients and received intravenous ondansetron 4 mg or dexamethasone 8 mg before chemotherapy and oral maintenance (ondansetron 4 mg every 6 h and dexamethasone reducing from 4 mg to 1 mg 6-hourly between days 1 and 5) for 5 days. 112 patients were treated (38 men, 73 women, 1 with no gender recorded; age range 30-73 years) and 100 were evaluable for cross-over analysis. Patients taking ondansetron or dexamethasone reported no significant difference in complete and major control of acute (83% vs 79%, p = 0.46) or delayed (82% vs 88%, p = 0.214) emesis (vomiting plus retches). Significantly more patients on dexamethasone (87%) than on ondansetron (72%) reported control of delayed nausea (days 2-5) (p = 0.003). Both drugs were well tolerated with no significant difference in the number of adverse events, and this is reflected by similar patient preference for ondansetron (40%) and dexamethasone (30%) (p = 0.244). Both drugs offer adequate out-patient control of chemotherapy-induced emesis; however, dexamethasone has an advantage in the control of delayed nausea, and also in terms of cost and resource allocation. 
Menstrual symptoms in women with pelvic endometriosis. OBJECTIVE--To investigate menstrual symptoms in relation to pelvic pathology. DESIGN--A prospective questionnaire-based study. SETTING--Aberdeen Royal Infirmary, Scotland. SUBJECTS--1250 questionnaires were sent out prior to planned admission and 1200 women (96%) brought the completed questionnaires. They comprised 598 women undergoing laparoscopic sterilization, 312 having laparoscopy because of infertility, 156 having laparoscopy because of chronic pelvic pain and 134 women undergoing abdominal hysterectomy for dysfunctional uterine bleeding. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES--The occurrence of dysmenorrhoea, menorrhagia, menstrual regularity, premenstrual spotting, deep dyspareunia and pelvic pain in women with either endometriosis and post infective pelvic adhesions or a normal pelvis. RESULTS--Menorrhagia, menstrual irregularity and premenstrual spotting occurred with equal frequency in all groups. Deep dyspareunia, pain after intercourse and recurrent pain unrelated to menstruation or coitus was more common in women with endometriosis and those with post infective pelvic adhesions than in those with a normal pelvis. Dysmenorrhoea appears to be more prevalent among women having endometriosis. CONCLUSIONS--Menstrual symptoms, while raising a high index of suspicion for endometriosis, are not entirely reliable as indicators of disease. Dysmenorrhoea is the most common reported symptom in endometriosis sufferers. Diagnostic laparoscopy should be considered before institution of treatment in women complaining of pelvic pain and menstrual symptoms. 
Increased postoperative pain and consumption of analgesics following acupuncture. Acupuncture was given to patients before (preoperative-acupuncture group, PRE-ACU, n = 25) or after (postoperative-acupuncture group, POST-ACU, n = 25) operative removal of impacted mandibular third molars. Sixty patients did not receive acupuncture and participated as a control group (CG). All patients completed a questionnaire in order to characterize state tension and stress, degrees of neuroticism, extroversion, depression and psychosomatic disorders. We also recorded intraoperative discomfort and pain intensity, postoperative pain intensity and consumption of analgesics for 72 h. The PRE-ACU was significantly more tense following surgery and found the operative procedure more unpleasant than the other two groups. The PRE-ACU further rated intraoperative pain intensity higher than the CG and experienced higher pain intensity immediately postoperatively compared with POST-ACU and CG. Of the PRE-ACU patients 15/24 needed additional local anesthesia intraoperatively while none in the POST-ACU or CG requested extra lidocaine. Postoperatively patients in both PRE- and POST-ACU reported a higher total sum of pain scores (pain intensity) and the PRE-ACU consumed more analgesics compared with the CG. A significantly larger number of patients suffering from "dry socket" (a complication during wound healing) was found in both PRE- and POST-ACU compared with the CG. No correlation was found between assessed personality characteristics and reported postoperative pain/consumption of analgesics in any group and could thus not explain the observed differences between the groups. The reason for our unexpected "negative" findings is unclear but some hypothetical explanations are discussed. 
Reduced D2 dopamine and muscarinic cholinergic receptor densities in caudate specimens from fluctuating parkinsonian patients. Binding of spiperone and 3-quinuclidinyl benzilate (QNB), both labeled with hydrogen 3 (3H), were measured in caudate tissue obtained from 8 living parkinsonian patients at the time of cerebral transplantation. This was clinically homogeneous group of patients. All remained predominantly responsive to levodopa, although with marked disability secondary to clinical fluctuations (short-duration responses) and medication-induced dyskinesias; all were receiving substantial doses of levodopa and 6 of the 8 patients were additionally receiving bromocriptine or pergolide. Binding densities of dopamine D2 receptors, as measured by [3H]spiperone binding, were reduced in this group of patients, compared to caudate specimens from autopsy control subjects. This findings may reflect medication-induced receptor downregulation. Parallel changes occurred with muscarinic cholinergic receptors; [3H]QNB binding was significantly reduced, compared to autopsy control values. This reduction of muscarinic receptors might be due to loss of nigrostriatal terminals that are known to contain muscarinic receptors. Alternatively, muscarinic receptors may have been downregulated by increased corticostriatal glutamatergic input to cholinergic cells, inferred to be present based on the prominent levodopa-induced dyskinesias. Finally, receptor deficits could have been a reflection of more widespread degenerative cerebral disease, although levodopa-refractory symptoms were generally not pronounced in these patients. 
Familial Ebstein's anomaly: a report of six cases in two generations associated with mild skeletal abnormalities. In a family of 11 persons in three generations six had Ebstein's anomaly. Five of the six showed mild skeletal anomalies--that is, restricted finger extension, with or without limitation of larger joints, and externally rotated little toes. Two other members of the family had the skeletal features without Ebstein's anomaly. The findings suggest a dominantly inherited syndrome of Ebstein's anomaly and skeletal abnormalities. The four female patients were all mildly affected whereas three of the four male patients were severely affected. 
Excimer laser-assisted femoral angioplasty: early results. The ability to ablate atheroma without generating heat makes the excimer laser wavelength a promising intraluminal technique for the treatment of arterial occlusive disease. This series reviews a preliminary experience treating patients with superficial femoral arterial disease admitted with limb-threatening ischemia or claudication. Twenty-six diseased superficial femoral arteries (5 stenotic and 21 occluded) were treated in 23 consecutive patients. Patients with claudication (18) reluctant to undergo bypass or with limb-threatening ischemia (8) at extremely high risk for surgery were included. There were 10 men and 13 women with a mean age of 67 years. A 308 nm excimer laser with an over-the-wire catheter (19) or balloon-centered end-on catheter (7) was used followed by balloon angioplasty. Twenty-four procedures were performed percutaneously, and two were performed with the vessel open in the operating room. Technical success, defined as disobliteration confirmed by angiography and greater than 0.15 increase of the ankle/brachial index, was achieved in 15 of 26. Eleven of 21 occlusions (52%) and four of five stenoses (80%) were opened. Only two of 11 lesions longer than 10 cm were successfully treated. Unsuccessful attempts (technical failure) occurred in 11 of 26 patients and resulted in four elective and one emergency femoral-popliteal bypass. Five patients were discharged with their claudication unchanged, and one had an elective amputation. Six arterial perforations with three arteriovenous fistulas occurred, all resolved without operation. No unanticipated limb loss occurred. In the 15 successful cases, the mean ankle/brachial index increase was 0.34. Seven (47%) of these 15 remain patent with a mean follow-up of 9.5 months (1.5 to 14 months). 
The transmandibular implant: a 13-year survey of its use. During the period from August 1976 until July 1989 the transmandibular implant was introduced in a total of 31 oral and maxillofacial surgery departments in the Netherlands and 1,466 patients were treated. This study includes 1,356 treated patients from 28 departments. The treatment course of 1,201 patients (89.6%) was uneventful. Of the 157 complications, 58 related to the anatomic contour of the mandible, 49 to the surgery, 25 to the prosthetic reconstruction, 8 to the psychosocial attitude of the patient, 8 to the use of medication, 5 to trauma, and 4 to the presence of a skin graft. Treatment of the complications included removal of the implant in 44 patients; in 106 patients the complication was treated satisfactorily. In the remaining 7 patients, hypesthesia was present. The reasons for the removal of the 44 implants were infection (11), operative error (5), premature loading of the implant (3), insufficient width of the mandible after a visor osteotomy (1), loss of osseointegration caused by the prosthesis (14), psychological problems (4), trauma (3), drug-related gingival hyperplasia (2), and inexplicable pain (1). The present survey shows a consistent success rate of 96.8%. 
Sinus of Valsalva aneurysm eroding into the interventricular septum. We report a case of erosion of an aneurysm of the right sinus of Valsalva into the interventricular septum. The mode of presentation, the preoperative evaluation, and the echocardiographic and nuclear magnetic resonance imaging features are presented, and the cardiac catheterization findings and surgical management of this very rare cardiac pathology are discussed. 
Some perspectives on peptic ulcer. In this article, the author comments on the following topics: whether peptic ulcer is a disease or just the sign of another process; whether the crater has a multifactorial origin; the ubiquity of Helicobacter pylori and the conclusion that a specific strain will doubtless prove to be the cause of some, but not all, ulcers; the inherent definitional problem of "nonulcer dyspepsia"; and the controversy over how much gastric acid needs to be reduced to speed the healing of peptic ulcer. 
Overlapping loss of heterozygosity by mitotic recombination on mouse chromosome 7F1-ter in skin carcinogenesis. A significant role for mouse chromosome 7 abnormalities during chemically induced skin carcinogenesis has been advanced based on previous cytogenetic and molecular studies. To determine the frequency of allelic losses at different loci of chromosome 7 in skin tumors induced in the outbred SENCAR mouse stock by a two-stage initiation-promotion protocol, we compared the constitutional and tumor genotypes of premalignant papillomas and squamous cell carcinomas for loss of heterozygosity at different informative loci. In a previous study, these tumors had been analyzed for their allelic composition at the Harvey ras-1 (Ha-ras-1) locus and it was found that 39% of squamous cell carcinomas had lost the normal Ha-ras-1 allele exhibiting 3 or 2 copies of the mutated counterpart or gene amplification. In the present study, by combining Southern blot and polymerase chain reaction fragment length polymorphism analyses, we detected complete loss of heterozygosity at the beta-globin (Hbb) locus, distal to Ha-ras-1, in 15 of 20 (75%) skin carcinomas. In addition, 5 of 5 informative cases attained homozygosity at the int-2 locus, 27 centimorgans distal to Hbb. Polymerase chain reaction analysis of DNA extracted from papillomas devoid of stromal contamination by fluorescence-activated sorting of single cell dispersions immunolabeled with anti-keratin 13 antibody revealed loss of heterozygosity at the Hbb locus, demonstrating that this event occurs during premalignant stages of tumor development. Interestingly, loss of heterozygosity was only detected in late-stage lesions exhibiting a high degree of dysplasia and areas of microinvasion. Analysis of allelic ratios by densitometric scanning of tumors that had become homozygous at Hbb but retained heterozygosis at Ha-ras-1 indicated mitotic recombination as the mechanism underlying loss of heterozygosity on mouse chromosome 7 during chemically induced skin carcinogenesis. These findings are consistent with the presence of a putative tumor suppressor gene linked to the Hbb locus in the 7F1-ter region of mouse chromosome 7, the functional inactivation of which may constitute a critical event in skin tumor progression, possibly during the malignant conversion stage. 
Human papillomavirus types 16 and 18 in adenocarcinoma of the uterine cervix. Many reports have shown a link between human papillomavirus (HPV) and cervical squamous neoplasia. However, the association of HPV with cervical adenocarcinoma has been studied less extensively. The authors evaluated the presence of HPV-DNA in 106 patients with adenocarcinoma of the uterine cervix by in situ hybridization, using 35S-labeled probes for HPV 16 DNA and HPV 18 DNA. The overall prevalence of HPV-DNA was 18% (19 of 106). HPV 16 was present in 2 (2%) cases, HPV 18 was observed in 15 (14%) cases, and both HPV 16 and HPV 18 were found in 2 (2%) cases. There was a correlation between HPV-DNA positivity and tumor stage (P less than 0.01) and tumor size (P less than 0.05), but there was no relationship between HPV-DNA positivity and tumor differentiation, proliferation (S-phase fraction), ploidy, lymph node metastases, or five-year survival rate. These results suggest that HPV 18 DNA is associated with cervical adenocarcinoma but the presence of HPV 18 has no influence on overall survival. 
Effects of hypoxaemia and bradycardia on neonatal cerebral haemodynamics. Near infrared spectroscopy has been used to assess the effects of bradycardia and hypoxia on the cerebral circulation in the premature neonate. The technique is well tolerated and can be applied in almost any infant. Continuous monitoring of changes in cerebral oxygenated, deoxygenated, and total haemoglobin is possible. Total haemoglobin is analogous to cerebral blood volume; thus information on circulatory changes as well as oxygenation state can be obtained. Twenty five babies had cerebral monitoring carried out using this technique. During episodes of hypoxia, both spontaneous and induced, impairment of haemoglobin oxygenation within the brain was detected together with an overall increase in the total mean haemoglobin concentration, which was 0.8 x 10(-2) mmol/l. Bradycardia with apnoea also led to impairment of cerebral oxygenation, and to a rapid fall in the concentration of total mean haemoglobin to 1.4 x 10(-2) mmol/l, which was followed in some cases by an increase to above the resting value on recovery of the heart rate to a mean of 0.7 x 10(-2) mmol/l. These disturbances to total haemoglobin concentration represent abnormalities of cerebral blood volume that may be implicated in the pathogenesis of neonatal cerebral injury. 
Role of combination drug therapy with a class IC antiarrhythmic agent and mexiletine for ventricular tachycardia. The combination of mexiletine and a class IC antiarrhythmic agent (encainide, propafenone or flecainide) was evaluated by electrophysiologic testing in 14 patients with a history of sustained ventricular tachycardia whose tachycardia remained inducible during therapy with the class IC drug alone. During the control drug-free state, all patients had inducible ventricular tachycardia, with a mean cycle length of 260 ms (range 190 to 400). During monotherapy with the IC agent the tachycardia remained inducible in each patient, but there was a significant increase in the cycle length to 340 ms (240 to 500) (p less than 0.001). The effective refractory period of the ventricle was not altered. Treatment with mexiletine (oral in 13 and intravenous in 1) was begun and electrophysiologic testing was repeated. Ventricular tachycardia in one patient was rendered noninducible and one patient had arrhythmia aggravation. The tachycardia in the remaining 12 patients remained inducible but its average cycle length increased further to 392 ms (340 to 460) (p = NS). Nine patients had rate slowing and the average cycle length of the ventricular tachycardia in this group was significantly increased (302 to 388 ms, p less than 0.05). The average effective refractory period was significantly increased during combination therapy (267 ms) compared with no drug therapy (235 ms) and therapy with the class IC drug alone (247 ms) (p less than 0.05). After a mean follow-up interval of 22 months, seven patients continue on the combined treatment and have no ventricular tachycardia. 
Congestive heart failure in diabetes with hypertension may be due to uncoupling of the atrial natriuretic peptide receptor-effector system in the kidney basolateral membrane. Hypertension is known to potentiate the risk of congestive heart failure (CHF) in diabetic individuals. Receptor-effector systems for atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP), which is known to regulate intracellular calcium (Ca2+), were studied in the kidney during hypertensive-diabetic cardiomyopathy in rats. Animals were divided into four groups: control, diabetic (D), hypertensive (H), and diabetic plus hypertensive (D + H). Diabetes was induced by a streptozotocin (65 mg/kg) injection and hypertension was induced by abdominal aortic constriction; studies were done at 1 and 6 weeks. Plasma ANP was increased at 1 week in the D, H, and D + H groups. There was a significant increase in the activity of Ca2+ + magnesium (Mg2+) adenosine triphosphatase (ATPase), which acts as a Ca2+ pump, in the kidney basolateral membrane from D, H, and D + H group at the 1 week study. Ca2+ + Mg2+ ATPase, on the other hand, was significantly decreased in the D + H group only at 6 weeks. This was associated with a decrease in plasma ANP, an increase in the kidney ANP receptor number, and a decrease in guanylate cyclase activity. The response of the Ca2+ pump to ANP was also attenuated. Since ANP is known to mediate its cellular effects in part by increasing Ca2+ + Mg2+ ATPase, the observed changes in the D + H group may contribute to the development of nephropathy and CHF. 
Gastrointestinal lipoma and malignancies. Twenty gastrointestinal lipomata in 18 patients are reviewed: 15 located in the colon, 3 in the distal ileum, one in the duodenum, and one in the stomach. They were found most frequently in European-born, elderly women and presented with variable abdominal symptomatology. Four lipomata were removed during endoscopy, the remainder at laparotomy, partial colectomy being performed in 10 cases. All, except 2 subserosal types, were located in the submucosa, and their average size was 2.7 cm diameter. Microscopically, none showed true encapsulation, and all were composed of mature fat cells without cellular atypia. In spite of nonspecific changes at endoscopy, one-half of the cases showed, on microscopic examination, atrophy of the overlying glands and a prominent eosinophilic and/or lymphoplasmocytic infiltration of the lamina propria. Two large subserosal lipomata were associated with Crohn's disease. In addition, in 39% of cases, malignant tumours, either single or double, were present in the gastrointestinal tract or elsewhere. Gastrointestinal "lipomata" are located in the sites of normal fatty infiltration in the elderly; these growths could be a local aging or reactive process of the intestinal wall rather than true neoplasms without any potential malignancy. However, coexistent malignancies should be carefully searched for in elderly patients with colonic lipoma. 
Acute abdomen as the first presentation of pseudomembranous colitis. Acute abdomen was the presenting manifestation of pseudomembranous colitis in six men who had previously been treated with antibiotics and presented with abdominal distention, pain, fever, and leukocytosis with absent or mild diarrhea. Plain abdominal radiographs revealed megacolon in two, combined small and large bowel dilation in three, with one of them showing volvuluslike pattern, and isolated small bowel ileus in one. Emergency colonoscopy was performed successfully in all patients and revealed pseudomembranes in five and nonspecific colitis in one. All patients had positive latex test results for Clostridium difficile, and two tested positive for cytotoxicity. All patients were treated with IV metronidazole, resulting in resolution of symptoms and abdominal findings. In addition, two patients underwent colonoscopic decompression with improvement. Endoscopically, complete resolution of the pseudomembranes occurred at 4 weeks in all cases. No patient had a recurrence. It is concluded that (a) pseudomembranous colitis may present as abdominal distention mimicking small bowel ileus. Ogilvie's syndrome, volvulus, or ischemia; (b) in such cases, emergency colonoscopy is safe and useful for diagnosis and therapeutic decompression and may obviate the need for surgery; and (c) treatment with IV metronidazole is effective. Colitis due to C. difficile should be considered in the differential diagnosis of acute abdomen in patients previously treated with antibiotics. 
Endoscopic assessment of mucosal hemodynamic changes in a canine model of gastric ulcer. In studying the side effects of sclerosants injected into the gastric submucosa in dogs (N = 7), we noted that 3 ml of absolute ethanol induced a large gastric ulceration. We describe the time course of change in the ulcer size, and suggest that such ulceration can be used for the endoscopic assessment of factors important in ulcer genesis and healing. Endoscopic reflectance spectrophotometric measurement of indices of mucosal hemoglobin concentration (IHB) and oxygen saturation (ISO2) were performed in a separate group of dogs (N = 4) with ethanol-induced gastric ulceration. We found a significant difference (p less than 0.05) in IHB and ISO2 immediately before (97 +/- 8 and 37 +/- 3, respectively) and after (138 +/- 7 and 21 +/- 5, respectively) the ethanol injection. At 24 hours after the ethanol injection, the IHB at the lesion margin (141 +/- 14) was significantly higher (p less than 0.05) than that at the adjacent mucosa (101 +/- 4), whereas the ISO2 measurements were not significantly different in these two locations, 34 +/- 2 and 31 +/- 2, respectively. We conclude that (1) injection of 3 mol of absolute ethanol into the submucosa of the canine stomach provides an animal model of gastric ulceration in which the ulcer can be examined repeatedly with the aid of the endoscope; (2) in this ulcer model, ischemia with congestion (increases IHB, decreases ISO2) precedes the development of gross mucosal ulcerations; and (3) the margin of the established ulceration in this model exhibits hyperemia (increases IHB, normal ISO2) which mimics that of a healing gastric ulcer. 
Lateral pharyngeal space abscess as a consequence of regional anesthesia. Trismus may be a complication from local anesthesia. Patients with trismus of unknown cause after dental treatment should be evaluated thoroughly. The dentist should perform a complete examination and establish a differential diagnosis to avoid missing a serious or life-threatening infection. A right lateral pharyngeal space infection developed after a general restorative procedure that involved an inferior alveolar nerve injection on the same side. The patient's severe trismus required awake intubation, incision and drainage while the patient was under general anesthesia, treatment with antibiotics and ten days of hospitalization. 
Interdependence of blood pressure and heart period regulation in mild hypertension. Blood pressure and heart period variability have been measured directly in 142 subjects with mild hypertension over 24 h. The variabilities have been expressed as the standard deviation of 2 min averages of all beats over 24 h. Baroreflex sensitivity was assessed in 102 subjects by the phenylephrine method. Blood pressure varies over a range of approximately 40% around the mean by day and by approximately 20% at night. The variability of blood pressure by day was inversely proportional to the sensitivity of the baroreflex (r = -0.33, P less than .001), while the variability of heart period was directly related to the sensitivity of the reflex (r = 0.27, P less than .01). Neither of these relationships was significant at night. An inverse relationship between heart period and blood pressure was shown by regression analysis of blood pressure and heart period averages over 24 h. The steepness of the slope of the heart period-systolic blood pressure relationship was strongly correlated with the baroreflex sensitivity (r = -0.55, P less than .001), suggesting that blood pressure variations are substantially buffered by changes in heart frequency. Thus, a more stable heart rate that results from an ineffective baroreflex is associated with a more variable systolic blood pressure. 
Bleeding after endoscopic sphincterotomy as an underestimated entity. Hemorrhage is the most frequent complication of endoscopic sphincterotomy, with a reported incidence of 2 to 9 per cent. Previous reports have generally defined this complication clinically, leaving the issue of occult bleeding after sphincterotomy essentially unaddressed. Seventy-five serial sphincterotomies were reviewed to further assess this complication. Nine patients had clinically evident hemorrhage and 27 patients had occult bleeding manifested only by a decrement in hematologic parameters, for a total postsphincterotomy bleeding rate of 48 per cent. No statistically significant risk factors for bleeding were delineated. Endoscopically recognized bleeding at the time of the sphincterotomy was 47 per cent sensitive and 85 per cent specific in predicting postprocedural bleeding. Significant delayed hemorrhage was manifest in three patients, one of whom had clinically occult bleeding. We conclude that bleeding complicates endoscopic sphincterotomy much more frequently than previously reported, although often in a clinically occult manner. Significant delayed bleeding can occur, and may not be clinically apparent. Bleeding recognized endoscopically at the time of sphincterotomy is an insensitive but relatively specific predictor of postprocedural bleeding. As use of endoscopic sphincterotomy increases, careful surveillance for hemorrhagic complications, as well as efforts to identify factors predisposing to the same, will be of increasing importance. 
Correlation between sexual abuse and somatization in women with somatic and nonsomatic chronic pelvic pain. After a comprehensive clinical and psychological evaluation, 99 women with pelvic pain of at least 6 months' duration and normal findings at laparoscopy were divided into two groups, including 47 women with probable somatic causes of pain (group 1) and 52 women without identifiable somatic abnormality (group 2). Women without identifiable somatic abnormality (group 2) were younger, had higher mean somatization scores, and reported an earlier mean age at first intercourse, a higher number of total sexual partners, and a higher prevalence of sexual abuse before the age of 20. Within group 2 (nonsomatic pain) but not within group 1, mean somatization scores were significantly higher among women with a history of sexual abuse than among women with a negative history. When analyzed as risks for nonsomatic pelvic pain, the positive predictive value of both a history of sexual abuse and a high somatization score was 78% (relative risk compared with that of women with zero or one risk factor, 2.1; p less than 0.0001). These data suggest that the psychosocial profile of women with nonsomatic pelvic pain differs from that of women with somatic pelvic pain and that previous sexual abuse is a significant predisposing risk for somatization and non-somatic chronic pelvic pain. 
Cardiovascular neural regulation explored in the frequency domain. A consistent link appears to exist between predominance of vagal or sympathetic activity and predominance of HF or LF oscillations, respectively: RR variability contains both of these rhythms, and their relative powers appear to subserve a reciprocal relation like that commonly found in sympathovagal balance. In this respect, it is our opinion that rhythms and neural components always interact, just like flexor and extensor tones or excitatory and inhibitory cardiovascular reflexes, and that it is misleading to separately consider vagal and sympathetic modulations of heart rate. In humans and experimental animals, functional states likely to be accompanied by an increased sympathetic activity are characterized by a shift of the LF-HF balance in favor of the LF component; the opposite occurs during presumed increases in vagal activity. In addition, LF oscillation evaluated from SAP variability appears to be a convenient marker of the sympathetic modulation of vasomotor activity. Although based on indirect markers, the exploration in the frequency domain of cardiovascular neural regulation might disclose a unitary vision hard to reach through the assemblage of more specific but fragmented pieces of information. 
Pancreatic-portal vein fistula with disseminated fat necrosis treated by pancreaticoduodenectomy. I have reported the case of a 62-year-old man with chronic alcoholic pancreatitis and a rare pseudocyst-portal vein fistula. Even though he experienced no abdominal symptoms, he had severe metastatic fat necrosis manifested as subcutaneous fat necrosis, polyarthritis, medullary bone necrosis, and mental status changes. Remote tissue destruction continued until relief was gained by pancreaticoduodenectomy and repair of the necrotic portal vein. Disseminated fat necrosis is a rare syndrome that can be the only presenting feature in patients with pancreatitis and pancreatic cancer. Early recognition and treatment of the underlying pancreatic disease may decrease the high morality rate associated with this syndrome. 
Direct sequencing from touch preparations of human carcinomas: analysis of p53 mutations in breast carcinomas A new technique for characterizing somatic mutations in very small samples of cellularly heterogeneous human cancer tissue was developed and tested using mutations in the p53 gene in breast carcinomas as a model system. The technique combines touch preparation of specimens to obtain homogeneous clusters of carcinoma cells free of normal cells with a nested pair of polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplifications of DNA to increase the amount of target gene sequence sufficiently to permit direct sequencing of the p53 gene. Touch preparations of fresh or previously frozen tissue from human adenocarcinomas derived from several organs were stained, and clusters of 10-50 malignant cells were transferred by pipette into microfuge tubes for PCR amplification. Exons 5-9 of the p53 gene, which contain the major mutational hot spots associated with most human cancers, were sequenced by the following steps: 1) two rounds of PCR amplification using DNA Taq polymerase and two sets of oligonucleotide primers, the second set being nested within the segment amplified by the first set and having attached T7 and SP6 phage promoter sequences, 2) transcription of the amplified DNA sequences with T7 and SP6 RNA polymerases, and 3) dideoxy sequencing of single-stranded RNA transcripts with reverse transcriptase and with additional oligonucleotide primers to achieve specificity for this unique region of the genome. The utility of this approach is illustrated by our success in detecting and analyzing point mutations in cell clusters from four of 11 primary adenocarcinomas of the human breast. 
Changing pattern of bone and joint infections due to Staphylococcus aureus: study of cases of bacteremia in Denmark, 1959-1988. Of the 15,170 cases of bacteremia due to Staphylococcus aureus that occurred in Denmark between 1959 and 1988, we review 525 cases of acute hematogenous osteomyelitis and 185 cases of septic arthritis that developed subsequent to the bacteremia and 134 cases of contiguous osteomyelitis in which the bacteremia developed secondarily. The pattern of acute infections of bones and joints has changed over the three decades studied. The frequency of secondary bone or joint infections due to S. aureus bacteremia has changed, as have the phage-type pattern and antibiotic resistance of the infective strains. The prevalence of hospital-acquired cases has increased and the age distribution of patients has changed, as is reflected in an increasing number of older patients. The localization of hematogenous osteomyelitis has shifted, and the vertebral column is now the most common site of infection. The rate of chronic cases of osteomyelitis that occur following acute hematogenous osteomyelitis has been reduced from 34% to 6%. The mortality associated with S. aureus bacteremic infections of bones or joints is low compared to that associated with other cases of S. aureus bacteremia. 
Generalized pustular psoriasis. A review of 63 cases. BACKGROUND--Sixty-three patients with generalized pustular psoriasis were hospitalized during a 29-year period. They were classified into four subgroups on the basis of onset and morphologic pattern of disease: acute (von Zumbusch), subacute annular, chronic (acral), and mixed. This division provides a better understanding of the variability of the disease and helps in choosing treatment. OBSERVATIONS--The average age at onset was 50 years; male and female patients were affected about equally. In 11 patients, flares were precipitated by localized infections. Approximately one fourth of the patients had complications; most were superinfections. The average stay in the hospital was 30 days; factors correlating with a long hospitalization were hypocalcemia, female sex, and a previous history of psoriasis vulgaris or pustular psoriasis. CONCLUSIONS--Whereas topical therapy was helpful, systemic medications were often needed. Coal tar, ultraviolet light, and psoralen-ultraviolet A may be effective; however, they must be used with caution, because they may exacerbate the disease. 
Hormone replacement therapy in general practice: a survey of doctors in the MRC's general practice research framework. OBJECTIVES--To survey current prescribing practice for hormone replacement therapy among general practitioners and to elicit their views on the role of hormone replacement therapy in the prevention of osteoporosis and cardiovascular disease; to determine whether they would participate in randomised controlled trials to evaluate the long term beneficial and adverse effects of hormone replacement therapy. DESIGN--Postal questionnaires to general practitioners throughout the United Kingdom. PARTICIPANTS--1268 general practitioners in the Medical Research Council's general practice research framework. RESULTS--1081 (85%) doctors in 220 (95%) practices responded. The doctors were currently prescribing hormone replacement therapy to an estimated 9% of their female patients aged 40 to 64, and 55% of doctors were prescribing opposed hormone replacement therapy (oestrogen plus progestogen) to more patients than a year previously. Over half the doctors would consider prescribing hormone replacement therapy for prevention of osteoporosis (670, 62%) and cardiovascular disease (611, 57%) to asymptomatic women. Overall, 79% of the doctors (851) would definitely or probably consider entering women who have had a hysterectomy into a randomised controlled trial comparing unopposed (oestrogen only) hormone replacement therapy with opposed hormone replacement therapy; 49% (524) would enter patients with a uterus into such a trial. Among a subsample, 85% (180/210) would consider entering patients without menopausal symptoms into a trial comparing hormone replacement therapy with no treatment (unopposed in patients who have had a hysterectomy, opposed in those with a uterus). CONCLUSION--There is considerable uncertainty among general practitioners as to the balance of beneficial and harmful effects of hormone replacement therapy in the long term, particularly relating to its use for prevention of osteoporosis and cardiovascular disease. Most of these doctors would be prepared to participate in randomised controlled trials to determine the long term effects of this increasingly widely used treatment. 
Coronary patency, infarct size and left ventricular function after thrombolytic therapy for acute myocardial infarction: results from the tissue plasminogen activator: Toronto (TPAT) placebo-controlled trial. TPAT Study Group Infarct size, left ventricular function and infarct-related coronary artery patency were examined in 108 patients who took part in a previously reported placebo-controlled trial of recombinant tissue-type plasminogen activator (rt-PA) in acute myocardial infarction. Coronary angiography was performed 17 +/- 0.8 h after initiation of treatment in 47 patients (group A) or at 10 days in 61 patients (group B). Both groups underwent radionuclide ventriculography 3.8 +/- 0.8 h and again on day 9 after treatment and quantitative thallium scintigraphy on day 8. In group A, the infarct-related artery was patent in 53%; these patients had a smaller global (15.1 +/- 2.5% vs. 25.7 +/- 4.7%, p = 0.029) and regional (14.7 +/- 2.5% vs. 24.1 +/- 4.7%, p = 0.044) fixed thallium defect than did those with an occluded artery. Infarct regional ejection fraction improved by 10.1 +/- 2.1% between early and late studies when the infarct-related artery was patent and by 4.8 +/- 1.4% if it was occluded (p = 0.048); changes in global and noninfarct regional ejection fraction were similar irrespective of perfusion status. Infarct regional ejection fraction and fixed thallium defect were inversely related only when the infarct-related artery was occluded (r = -0.83, p less than 0.0001). In group B, 10 day patency of the infarct-related artery was 67%; there was no difference in patency by treatment assignment or in left ventricular function or infarct size between patients with and without infarct-related artery patency. There was no evidence of an effect of rt-PA therapy beyond that expressed through coronary patency alone in either group A or group B. 
CT and pathologic predictive features of residual mass histologic findings after chemotherapy for nonseminomatous germ cell tumors: can residual malignancy or teratoma be excluded? Forty-eight patients with disseminated nonseminomatous germ cell tumors were studied retrospectively to determine whether initial pathologic features and pre- and post-chemotherapy computed tomographic (CT) features could be used to exclude malignancy or teratoma in residual masses that were excised after chemotherapy. Neither CT findings (residual mass size, attenuation, and degree of shrinkage during chemotherapy) nor type of primary testicular tumor cell was significantly correlated with malignancy or teratoma versus necrosis in residual masses. No significant correlation was demonstrated between the combined features of (a) the absence of teratoma in a histologic specimen of the primary testicular tumor and (b) greater than 90% shrinkage of masses during chemotherapy and the absence of malignancy or teratoma in residual masses as suggested in the literature. Of nine patients with both of these findings, two had malignancy and two had teratoma. Radiographic and pathologic features cannot be used to reliably exclude malignancy or teratoma in residual abdominal masses after chemotherapy for nonseminomatous testicular cancer. 
Primary soft tissue tumours of the pelvis causing referred pain in the leg. Referred pain in the leg is occasionally due to a pelvic soft tissue tumour. Among 11 patients who presented this way, one had a lymphoma, one had a benign schwannoma, and nine had soft tissue sarcomas. Most patients had undergone a variety of procedures, including laminectomy, before the correct diagnosis was established. In five cases, an accurate diagnosis was obtained by needle biopsy. The lymphoma responded to chemotherapy, and the benign schwannoma was excised. Of the nine patients with soft tissue sarcoma, six underwent marginal/intracapsular excision, three receiving supplementary radiotherapy, and two were treated by nonsurgical means. Hindquarter amputation was technically impossible or inappropriate in these cases. All those with high-grade tumours have died or have metastases. Of four patients with low-grade tumours, three have exhibited only slow disease progression. Careful judgment and a precise histopathological diagnosis are required in planning treatment for patients with pelvic soft tissue tumours causing referred pain in the leg. 
Prevalence and prognostic significance of silent and symptomatic ischemia after coronary bypass surgery: a report from the Coronary Artery Surgery Study (CASS) randomized population. The prevalence and prognostic significance of postoperative myocardial ischemia, as detected by exercise testing, were prospectively assessed in 174 patients from the Coronary Artery Surgery Study (CASS) randomized surgical population who had exercise testing before and 6 months after coronary artery bypass graft surgery. Whereas the prevalence of symptomatic ischemia significantly decreased postoperatively (52% vs. 6%, p less than 0.001), the frequency of silent myocardial ischemia did not change (30% vs. 29%). Survival at 12 years after bypass surgery based on the 6-month postoperative exercise test results was significantly better for the 112 patients with no ischemia (80%) than for the 51 patients with silent ischemia (68%) or the 11 patients with symptomatic ischemia (45%). These data show that coronary artery bypass graft surgery diminishes the overall prevalence of symptomatic but not silent ischemia and that both silent and symptomatic ischemia adversely affect the postoperative prognosis of these patients. 
Genetic predisposition to iatrogenic Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease. The spongiform encephalopathy Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD) has been transmitted to man via administration of growth hormone and gonadotropin extracted from large pooled batches of human cadaveric pituitary glands. In the UK, 1908 individuals were exposed to potentially contaminated growth hormone, of whom 6 have so far manifested CJD. Examination of the prion protein genes of all these cases and of a single case of gonadotropin-related CJD showed that 4 had the uncommon valine 129 homozygous genotype indicating genetic susceptibility to prion infection. Such genetic susceptibility may be important in the aetiology of sporadic CJD disease. 
The mast cell in health and disease. The presence of mast cells, often in an activated state or increased numbers, has been noted in various cutaneous disorders. Recent studies suggest that mast cells are of primary importance in these conditions and their presence does not merely represent a secondary event. This review focuses on atopic dermatitis, contact hypersensitivity reactions, bullous pemphigoid, fibrosing conditions, neurofibromatosis, wound healing, polycythemia vera, and psoriasis, in which there is significant evidence to indicate a pathophysiologic role for mast cells. 
Evaluation of restenosis after balloon dilatation in adult aortic stenosis by repeat catheterization. To evaluate the restenosis rate after successful balloon aortic valvuloplasty, clinical evaluation and repeat catheterization were performed in 96 patients who had undergone balloon dilatation 7 +/- 5 months earlier. Restenosis, defined as a loss of greater than 50% of the benefit in aortic valve area obtained after balloon valvuloplasty, was observed in 48% of the patients. Actuarial analysis showed that the restenosis rate was time dependent and was 80% at 15 months. However, functional improvement was observed in most of the patients with or without restenosis. The restenosis rate was not correlated with the degree of enlargement of the aortic orifice produced by the valvuloplasty procedure. Because of the high incidence of restenosis, balloon aortic valvuloplasty should be limited to patients who have a contraindication to surgery or are at high risk for surgery, or as a bridge to surgery. 
Metabolic consequences of (regional) total pancreatectomy. Little information has been reported on the metabolic characteristics of the totally pancreatectomized patient or the efficacy of medical management after radical pancreatic surgery. The prospective evaluation of 49 such patients, with 31% followed for 48 or more months, forms the basis of this report. The major immediate postoperative challenge is control of diarrhea and weight stabilization. Chronically patients have an increased daily caloric requirement (mean +/- SE, 56 +/- 1 kcal/kg), not wholly explained by moderate steatorrhea (fecal fat excretion, 16% +/- 2% of unrestricted fat intake). Despite persistent malabsorption, deficiencies in fat-soluble vitamin, magnesium, and trace element serum levels can be prevented in most patients. Pancreatogenic diabetes is characterized by (1) absence of the major glucoregulatory hormones insulin and glucagon, (2) instability, and (3) frequent hypoglycemia, with the latter parameters improving with rigorous home glucose monitoring. No patient has developed clinically overt diabetic micro- or macrovascular disease. Performance status in long-term survivors has been reasonable. However adverse chronic sequelae of the operation occur and include an unusual frequency of liver disease, characterized by accelerated fatty infiltration, and osteopenia, with an 18% reduction in radial bone mineral content noted in pancreatectomized patients studied more than 5 years after surgery. 
A method for estimating catechol estrogen metabolism from excretion of noncatechol estrogens. The relationship of catechol estrogen metabolism to disease has seldom been investigated because of analytic difficulties. Estradiol (E2) and estrone (E1) are oxidized simultaneously at either ring A or ring D, and the rate of catechol estrogen formation (r2) is reciprocally related to the rate of 16 alpha-hydroxylation (r3). The rate of ovarian estrogen production (X10) can be summarized as to metabolic outcome: X10 = r10 + r2 + r3 + r(u), where r10 is the loss of E1 and E2 in urine, and ru is the fecal and urinary loss of unknown oxidative products. Assuming a constant r(u) between subjects: constancy of the X10 concentration between subjects during similar menstrual cycle phases. In the absence of xenobiotics, r2 x r3 are reciprocally interrelated: r2 x r3 = K (an oxidation constant whose limiting factor is the biologically available estrogen at the cell surface). To the extent that r10 approximates estrogens available for cellular metabolism, the rate of catechol estrogen metabolism may be determined from (Formula; see text) From published data K = 12.4 +/- 0.8 of the standard error of the mean. Pearson correlation coefficients between actual and estimated catechol estrogen excretion in groups of subjects ranged from 0.61 to 0.97 (median, 0.88). This method has been useful for clinical investigation of the relationship of catechol estrogen metabolism to disease until better methods to measure catechol estrogen directly are available. 
An autopsy study of the incidence of lacunes in relation to age, hypertension, and arteriosclerosis. We investigated selected features of lacunes in 1,086 necropsy cases. Lacunes were found in brains from patients above the age of 40 years and were most common in brains from persons in their sixties but decreased in number in brains from older persons. The most common site of lacunes was the frontal lobe white matter, followed by the putamen, pons, parietal lobe white matter, thalamus, and caudate nucleus in descending order of frequency. By dividing the 1,086 cases into three groups according to blood pressure, we found more lacunes in the hypertensive and borderline hypertensive groups than in the normotensive group; the average number of lacunes per brain in each group was 3.61, 2.77, and 1.15, respectively. Diastolic hypertension was more closely related to the number of lacunes than was systolic hypertension. The extent of arteriolosclerosis of the medullary arteries in the frontal lobe white matter was measured and compared with the number of lacunes. There was a close correlation between lacunes and arterioloslerosis in all age groups. 
Transoral decompression evaluated by cine-mode magnetic resonance imaging: a case of basilar impression accompanied by Chiari malformation. Cine-mode magnetic resonance imaging provides simultaneous images of cerebrospinal fluid flow dynamics. A patient with a basilar impression accompanied by a Chiari malformation and von Recklinghausen's disease who underwent transoral decompression is reported. Preoperative cine-mode magnetic resonance imaging visualized an associated obstruction of cerebrospinal fluid pulsatile flow at the level of the foramen magnum. Tonsilar herniation (Chiari I malformation) and hydrocephalus were also present. Postoperatively, the obstruction of cerebrospinal fluid flow was resolved concomitant with the correction of the cervicomedullary angulation. On the basis of observations made by magnetic resonance imaging, the surgical treatment of basilar impression accompanied by Chiari malformation is briefly discussed. 
Treatment of recurrent urethral strictures using clean intermittent self-catheterisation. The treatment of urethral strictures has been greatly improved by the use of the optical urethrotome. However, there remains a group of patients with recurrent strictures for whom the alternatives remain long-term dilatation/urethrotomy or urethroplasty. Over the last 3 years we have treated 65 such patients using clean intermittent self-catheterisation as a method of self-dilatation. This has resulted in a dramatic decrease in the number of operations performed on these patients, with no significant reduction in urinary flow rate over an average follow-up period of 20 months. The method offers the possibility of long-term cure and should be offered to all all such patients, reducing still further the number of patients who require urethroplasty. 
Immunoturbidimetric assay for estimating free light chains of immunoglobulins in urine and serum. An immunoturbidimetric assay for the assessment of free kappa and lambda light chains of immunoglobulins was developed using a commercial polyclonal antiserum with reactivity towards epitopes on the light chains, which are not expressed when they are bound to heavy chains. The assay, on a centrifugal analyser, is simple and rapid. The limit of detection is 5 mg/l of free light chain, with an assay range of 5-120 mg/l, intrabatch precisions from 1.5-6.4%, and interbatch precisions from 6.5-8.9%. The assay was only slightly less sensitive than colloidal gold staining of cellulose acetate electrophoreses for the detection of Bence-Jones protein in urine. For the serial monitoring of response to chemotherapy in patients with myeloma, the assay correlated well with serum paraprotein estimates obtained by densitometric scanning of Ponceau stained cellulose acetate electrophoreses, but not with serum beta-2 microglobulin measurements, even after correction for the effects of creatinine. These assays may prove to be of use for the monitoring of tumour response in the treatment of Bence-Jones myeloma. 
Avoidance of tolerance and lack of rebound with intermittent dose titrated transdermal glyceryl trinitrate. The Transdermal Nitrate Investigators. OBJECTIVES--To investigate the efficacy of transdermal glyceryl trinitrate given continuously and with a nocturnal nitrate free period. DESIGN--Double blind placebo controlled study with two parallel limbs. SETTING--Multicentre trial. PATIENTS--52 patients randomised to receive either continuous treatment (23 patients) or intermittent treatment with an individually titrated dose (29 patients) for 14 days: both treatments were compared with placebo in a cross-over fashion. INTERVENTION--Continuous treatment with 10 mg per 24 hours of transdermal glyceryl trinitrate or intermittent transdermal glyceryl trinitrate titrated to give an arbitrary 10 mm Hg drop in systolic blood pressure (mean dose 18.2 mg) given over approximately 16 hours. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE--Treadmill exercise stress testing and ambulatory monitoring of the ST segment after 14 days' treatment. RESULTS--After 14 days' intermittent treatment resting supine and standing systolic blood pressure fell by 7.5 mm Hg (95% confidence interval 2.7 to 12.2) and 9.0 mm Hg (95% CI 3.4 to 14.5) respectively (p less than 0.01); resting heart rate was unchanged. Mean heart rate at 1 mm ST segment depression rose by 11.9 beats/min (CI 1.1 to 23.7) (p less than 0.05), mean time to onset of angina increased by 59 seconds (CI 10.8 to 108) (p less than 0.05), and total exercise duration increased by 40 seconds (p less than 0.05). These changes were not seen after continuous treatment. The frequency of ischaemic episodes was not reduced with either regimen nor was the circadian distribution of these episodes altered, in particular nocturnal episodes did not increase during intermittent treatment. CONCLUSION--Tolerance to glyceryl trinitrate was avoided by the use of individually titrated doses administered with a nocturnal nitrate free period. There was no evidence of "rebound" on ambulatory monitoring during this treatment. 
Physiologic stress and cellular ischemia: relationship to immunosuppression and susceptibility to sepsis. Multiple organ system failure secondary to infection is the most frequent cause of late mortality after hemorrhage, burns, and trauma. Although multiple immunologic abnormalities have been identified following injury, blood loss, and tissue ischemia, the mechanisms that produce these alterations in T- and B-cell function have not been completely defined. Physiologic stress and ischemia result in increased release of neuroendocrine peptides and hormones, capable of affecting normal neuroendocrine-immunologic balance and producing immunosuppression. Tissue ischemia leads to increased expression of heat shock proteins by hypoperfused cells, which can alter T-cell function. Injury also is followed by the appearance of serum immunosuppressive factors, which have been shown to inhibit T- and B-cell function. Future therapies directed at these and other cellular and molecular abnormalities initiated by tissue hypoperfusion may reverse the immunosuppressed state in critically ill patients and lead to improved outcome in this setting. 
Is routine CT scanning necessary in the preoperative evaluation of patients undergoing carotid endarterectomy? To evaluate the usefulness of CT scanning before carotid endarterectomy, a prospective study was performed on 469 consecutive patients considered for carotid endarterectomy during a 5-year period. All patients underwent carotid duplex scanning and CT scanning before carotid arteriography. Two hundred thirty-seven patients (51%) had transient ischemic attacks, 109 (23%) had a prior stroke, and 122 (26%) were asymptomatic. Results of the CT scan were abnormal in 68 (62%) of the 109 patients with stroke. Fifty-one of the 360 patients (14%) without a clinical history of stroke had an abnormal CT scan outcome. Of patients with a stroke documented by CT scanning, 27 had lacunar infarcts, and 92 had cortical infarcts; these findings did not change surgical management in any patient. CT scanning did not reveal any unsuspected infarcts or tumors. Two hundred thirty carotid endarterectomies were performed on 206 patients. Forty-seven patients (23%) in the operative group had abnormal CT scan findings, but the scan did not influence operative decisions or timing in any case. Seventy-two patients (27%) in the nonoperative group had abnormal CT scan results, but CT scan findings did not exclude any patient from arteriography or surgery. Three perioperative strokes (1.3%) occurred. CT scan findings did not correlate with postoperative neurologic complications. Cost of CT scanning was one-half million dollars in our study alone. Routine CT scanning is unnecessary before carotid endarterectomy and is not cost-effective. 
Double dissociation of short-term and long-term memory for nonverbal material in Parkinson's disease and global amnesia. A further analysis. The traditional concept of memory disorder is deficiency of the long-term (LTM) but not short-term (STM) component of memory. STM impairment with LTM sparing is seldom reported. The present study investigated STM and LTM for nonverbal material in three neurological conditions associated with memory impairment: bilateral medial temporal lobe lesions (patient H.M.), Parkinson's disease (PD) and Alzheimer's disease (AD). Subjects received 3 tests of nonverbal memory: forward block span, immediate and delayed recall of the Wechsler Memory Scale drawings, and immediate and delayed recognition of abstract designs. Compared with the normal control group, the patient groups displayed different patterns of sparing and loss of the two components of memory: in PD, only STM was impaired; in medial temporal lobe amnesia, only LTM was impaired; and in AD, STM and LTM were both impaired. The contrasting patterns of sparing and loss of STM and LTM in PD and global amnesia were present for both recognition and recall. These results provide evidence that STM and LTM are dissociable processes and are served by separate neurological systems: STM depends upon intact corticostriatal systems, whereas LTM depends upon intact medial temporal lobe systems. 
Traumatic anterior fossa cerebrospinal fluid fistulae and craniofacial considerations. Traumatic cerebrospinal fluid fistulae may present a diagnostic and treatment challenge to the head and neck surgeon. The clinical presentation may be obscured by associated injuries. This article serves as a guide in the understanding, diagnosis, and management of patients with dural fistulae of the anterior cranial fossa. 
Morphologic features and nuclide composition of infarction-associated cardiac myocyte mineralization in humans. Low dietary Mg results in Ca loading of cardiac myocytes, which increases the likelihood of myocyte calcification in the event of acute myocardial infarction (AMI), and possibly increases myocyte vulnerability to necrosis. Bloom and Peric-Golia1 previously reported an autopsy study of cases from the Washington, D.C. area (a region with low levels of Mg in the drinking water), demonstrating AMI-associated mineralization in myocytes with histologically normal nuclei and cross striations, as well as in obviously necrotic myocytes. The authors have re-examined mineralized myocytes from the same autopsy material, using electron probe microanalysis, light microscopy, and transmission electron microscopy. Microprobe analysis identified Ca and P as the nuclides composing the inorganic phase of the mineral deposits. Ultrastructurally, all Ca deposits, regardless of size or intracellular location, were composed of aggregates of needlelike hydroxyapatite crystals. The mildest form of intracellular Ca deposition was observed as small Ca deposits limited to some mitochondria of myocytes, which demonstrated intact nuclei and regular sarcomere pattern. More advanced stages of intracellular calcification, in the form of Ca deposits associated with mitochondria, Z-band regions and nuclei, were observed in other myocytes that also retained intact nuclei and sarcomeres. Massive Ca deposits were associated with myocytes which showed morphologic features of advanced necrosis, including loss of nuclei, disruption of sarcomere structure and masses of cellular debris. These observations support the theory originally proposed by Bloom and Peric-Golia1 suggesting that Ca loading of myocytes, possibly related to Mg deficiency in humans, increased vulnerability of the myocytes to subsequent AMI-associated necrosis and dystrophic calcification. In addition, the light microscopic impression of calcification of otherwise normal myocytes is contradicted by the electron microscopic identification of hydroxyapatite crystals free in the sarcoplasm, a condition unlikely to be compatible with viability. Lastly, the fact that all Ca deposits were in the form of hydroxyapatite supports the view that they were formed in a Mg-poor environment, which favors conversion of the more common amorphous form of Ca phosphate into the needlelike crystals of hydroxyapatite. 
Bacterial meningitis: T cell activation and immunoregulatory CD4+ T cell subset alteration. Meningitis is the most important cause of acquired postnatal deafness and neurologic disorders in children. To determine if cell-mediated immunity is casually related to the pathogenesis of bacterial meningitis, T cell subsets were quantitated from blood of the 29 children with clinical and bacteriologic diagnosis of Haemophilus influenzae, Streptococcus pneumoniae, and Neisseria meningitidis bacterial meningitis. The CD4+ T cells increased and CD8+ T cells decreased in patients with meningitis as compared to patient control subjects (bacterial infections without meningitis) and normal healthy control subjects. An elevated percentage of CD25+ (interleukin-2 receptors) and HLA-DR+ (immune-response gene-associated antigen) T cells were detected from all patients with meningitis. All 29 patients with meningitis had highly elevated CD4+ CD45R+ (suppressor-inducer) cells and reciprocally depressed CD4+ CDw29+ (helper-inducer) cells compared with healthy age-matched normal and patient control subjects. These findings indicate characteristic immunologic T cell abnormalities from meningitis. The abnormal increase in the CD4+ CD45R+ suppressor-inducer or "virgin" cells and expression of activation antigens on T cells may be of help in future understanding of abnormal immune reactions from bacterial meningitis. However, deficiency of the CD4+ CDw29+ helper-inducer or "memory" cells may contribute to the impaired helper function for B cell-induced protective antibody synthesis to bacterial capsular polysaccharides found in this disease. 
Androgen responses to acutely increased endogenous insulin levels in hyperandrogenic and normal cycling women. We examined androgen responses in hyperandrogenic (polycystic ovarian disease [PCOD]) and normal women after an acute endogenous insulin elevation. Standard intravenous glucose tolerance tests (IVGTTs), modified to include a tolbutamide injection 20 minutes after IVGTTs, were performed. Polycystic ovarian disease patients were studied in the untreated state, after 6 weeks of ovarian androgen suppression with leuprolide acetate, after a 6-week rest period, and after 6 weeks of antiandrogen therapy with spironolactone. Normal menstruating women were studied during the early follicular, midcycle, and luteal phases of a single cycle. An acute rise in insulin did not alter serum testosterone or androstenedione levels in PCOD or normal women. A significant rise in dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate after modified IVGTTs was found in both hyperandrogenic and normal cycling women. Although these results are not supportive of the theory that insulin acts on the ovary to stimulate androgen production, they may be because of the short time course of insulin elevation that occurs during an IVGTT. 
Hypersensitivity myocarditis. Autopsy tissue specimens of 69 cases of hypersensitivity myocarditis were studied to determine drug association, spectrum of histologic findings, distribution of infiltrates, and correlation between degree of infiltrates and cardiac symptoms. Hypersensitivity myocarditis was defined by the presence of eosinophils, a mixed lymphohistiocytic infiltrate along natural planes of separation, and an absence of fibrosis or granulation tissue in areas of infiltrate. Commonly implicated drugs were methyldopa, hydrochlorothiazide, ampicillin, furosemide, digoxin, tetracycline, aminophylline, phenytoin, benzodiazepines, and tricyclic antidepressants. Histiocytes composed the predominant cell type (in addition to eosinophils and lymphocytes). Lymphocytes were predominantly T cells in 12 cases studied immunohistochemically. Small foci of myocyte necrosis were present in 37 cases, and they correlated with the degree of infiltrate. A nonnecrotizing vasculitis was present in 28 cases. The right ventricle was involved in all but three cases. Cardiac arrhythmias or unexplained death occurred in 29 patients and did not correlate with the degree of myocardial infiltrate or presence of necrosis. Eosinophils were present in the livers of 30 of 58 patients, and their presence correlated with the degree of cardiac infiltration. A causative association between histologic findings and drugs is difficult to prove because of the common usage of many of the drugs implicated, multiple drug use, and the absence of clinical criteria of hypersensitivity. Symptoms do not appear related to the degree of infiltrate. In more than half the cases, infiltrates may be missed by endomyocardial biopsy due to focality of lesions. 
5-Fluorouracil after trabeculectomy and the iridocorneal endothelial syndrome. Nine patients (nine eyes) with iridocorneal endothelial (ICE) syndrome underwent trabeculectomy and received postoperative subconjunctival injections of 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) to enhance bleb formation (total 5-FU dose, 30-105 mg; mean, 53.8 mg). Eight eyes had undergone prior unsuccessful trabeculectomy. Four eyes had intraocular pressure (IOP) less than or equal to 21 mmHg on zero to two glaucoma medications after 6 to 54 months of follow-up (mean, 25.3 months). Five eyes required repeat surgery within 2 to 13 months and were considered failures. All five eyes that failed received a Molteno drainage implant. Progressive endothelial proliferation may explain late onset bleb failure and the relative ineffectiveness of 5-FU in this condition. 
Changes in portal blood flow consequent to partial hepatectomy: Doppler estimation. Hemodynamic changes in portal blood flow were investigated in 56 patients with hepatic tumors who underwent partial hepatectomy. Portal flow was measured with a Doppler ultrasound system before, during, and after surgery. The portal flow of patients who underwent massive hepatectomy decreased intraoperatively. The portal flow per unit of cardiac output decreased in patients who underwent massive or major hepatectomy, patients with a cirrhotic liver, and patients who had a satisfactory postoperative course. Postoperatively, the portal flow in patients with a poor clinical outcome (multiple organ failure, hepatic failure, and cardiorespiratory failure) decreased significantly. Monitoring portal hemodynamic values appears to be useful in providing an index of "hepatic functional reserve." Adequate portal flow is essential for postoperative hepatic regeneration; changes in portal hemodynamic values may be directly related to the patient's ability to survive surgery and to regain or maintain normal liver function. 
Angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors and magnesium conservation in patients with congestive cardiac failure. OBJECTIVE--To investigate whether angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors reduce diuretic induced magnesium excretion in patients in congestive cardiac failure. DESIGN--Cohort analytic study. SETTING--A London district general hospital. SUBJECTS--Thirty four patients with chronic congestive cardiac failure caused by ischaemic heart disease or cardiomyopathy selected consecutively from inpatients under the care of two consultant cardiologists. Nineteen patients (group 1) on diuretics alone were compared with 15 patients (group 2) taking diuretics plus either enalapril or captopril. All drug regimens were stable for at least three months before the study. Patients with impaired renal function (plasma creatinine greater than 120 mumol/l) were excluded. INTERVENTIONS--An intravenous loading dose of magnesium sulphate was given to minimise the variability in baseline magnesium state. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE--Total urine magnesium excretion and creatinine clearance in 24 hour urine collections. RESULTS--Plasma magnesium was similar in the two groups. However, 24 hour urine magnesium excretion was significantly lower in group 2 than in group 1. Furthermore, creatinine clearance was also significantly lower in group 2 and correlated strongly with magnesium excretion. There was no such relation in group 1. There was no difference in fractional clearance of magnesium between groups. CONCLUSION--Angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors have an important magnesium conserving action, possibly via their effect on glomerular filtration rate. 
Diagnostic x-ray procedures and risk of leukemia, lymphoma, and multiple myeloma [published erratum appears in JAMA 1991 Jun 5;265(21):2810] Exposure to diagnostic x-rays and the risk of leukemia, non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL), and multiple myeloma were studied within two prepaid health plans. Adult patients with leukemia (n = 565), NHL (n = 318), and multiple myeloma (n = 208) were matched to controls (n = 1390), and over 25,000 x-ray procedures were abstracted from medical records. Dose response was evaluated by assigning each x-ray procedure a score based on estimated bone marrow dose. X-ray exposure was not associated with chronic lymphocytic leukemia, one of the few malignant conditions never linked to radiation (relative risk [RR], 0.66). For all other forms of leukemia combined (n = 358), there was a slight elevation in risk (RR, 1.17) but no evidence of a dose-response relationship when x-ray procedures near the time of diagnosis were excluded. Similarly, patients with NHL were exposed to diagnostic x-ray procedures more often than controls (RR, 1.32), but the RR fell to 0.99 when the exposure to diagnostic x-ray procedures within 2 years of diagnosis was ignored. For multiple myeloma, overall risk was not significantly high (RR, 1.14), but there was consistent evidence of increasing risk with increasing numbers of diagnostic x-ray procedures. These data suggest that persons with leukemia and NHL undergo x-ray procedures frequently just prior to diagnosis for conditions related to the development or natural history of their disease. There was little evidence that diagnostic x-ray procedures were causally associated with leukemia or NHL. The risk for multiple myeloma, however, was increased among those patients who were frequently exposed to x-rays. 
Urological aspects of Behcet's disease. Behcet's disease, affecting mostly young males in the Mediterranean countries and Japan, is a multi-system disease with urological manifestations. In this prospective study of 100 consecutive patients with newly diagnosed Behcet's disease, we found that 89% of the males had experienced scrotal ulceration and 6% had epididymitis. We also observed sterile urethritis in 3%. Other urological abnormalities appeared to be coincidental findings. 
A randomized trial of five cisplatin-containing treatments in patients with metastatic non-small-cell lung cancer: a Southwest Oncology Group study. Six hundred eighty assessable patients with measureable stage III M1, non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) were randomized to one of five treatment arms including cisplatin, etoposide (VP-16) +/- methylglyoxal bisguanylhydrazone (MGBG; PVp, PVpM); cisplatin, vinblastine (PVe); or PVe alternating with vinblastine, mitomycin (PVeMi); or fluorouracil, vincristine, mitomycin/cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, cisplatin (FOMi/CAP). The overall response rate was 20% with 3% complete responses and 17% partial remissions. The duration of these responses was not statistically different by treatment regimen and varied from 2.7 months to 5.0 months. The overall median survival for all patients was 5.3 months and is not different by treatment. Toxicity was greater in PVpM. The similarity of results for response, duration of response, and survival does not establish the superiority of any of these platinum-based regimens for standard clinical usage. 
Did prognosis after acute myocardial infarction change during the past 30 years? A meta-analysis. Much effort has been spent to improve survival after acute myocardial infarction. To investigate how effective this effort has been, a meta-analysis was performed of studies published between 1960 and 1987 concerning mortality after acute myocardial infarction. Thirty-six studies were analyzed. They were classified with respect to deaths in the hospital and at 1 month and the 5-year mortality rate starting at hospital discharge. Mortality was assessed from all studies by comparing studies from different institutions with use of identical inclusion criteria (externally controlled studies) and by analyzing studies reporting on changes in mortality in two or more comparable patient cohorts admitted to the same institution at different time periods (internally controlled studies). Reports on clinical trials (for example, thrombolytic therapy, beta-adrenergic blockade) in acute myocardial infarction were excluded. Average overall in-hospital mortality decreased from 29% during the 1960s to 21% during the 1970s and to 16% during the 1980s. The externally controlled studies also showed a declining trend: from 1960 to 1969, 32%, from 1970 to 1979, 19% and from 1980 to 1987, 15%. The 1-month overall mortality rate decreased from 31% during the 1960s to 25% during the 1970s and 18% during the 1980s externally controlled studies. Most internally controlled studies also showed significant improvement in in-hospital and 1-month survival. In contrast, 5-year mortality after hospital discharge did not significantly decrease (33% from 1960 to 1969 and 33% from 1970 to 1979). It is concluded that in the prethrombolytic era, short-term prognosis after acute myocardial infarction has improved since 1960. 
Detection of preclinical Parkinson's disease with PET. Putamen 18F-dopa uptake of patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) is reduced by at least 35% at onset of symptoms; therefore, positron-emission tomography (PET) can be used to detect preclinical disease in clinically unaffected twins and relatives of patients with PD. Three out of 6 monozygotic and 2 out of 3 dizygotic unaffected PD co-twins have shown reduced putamen 18F-dopa uptake to date. In addition, an intact sibling and a daughter of 1 of 4 siblings with PD both had low putamen 18F-dopa uptake. These preliminary findings suggest there may be a familial component to the etiology of PD. PET can also be used to detect underlying nigral pathology in patients with isolated tremor and patients who become rigid taking dopamine-receptor blocking agents (DRBAs). Patients with familial essential tremor have normal, and those with isolated rest tremor have consistently low, putamen 18F-dopa uptake. Drug-induced parkinsonism is infrequently associated with underlying nigral pathology. 
Recent advances in the treatment of breast cancer. Multidisciplinary efforts have defined a number of prognostic factors and newer strategies to improve the outcome of patients with breast cancer. Conservative surgery has led to improved functional and cosmetic results. The development of a number of effective adjuvant regimens has led to improved survival. In patients with stage I disease, several biological characteristics of tumor have been identified that are associated with increased risk of relapse. A multimodality approach to patients with locally advanced disease and inflammatory cancer has resulted in improved survival. A number of hormonal and cytotoxic drug contaminations can palliate metastatic disease, with a small fraction of patients remaining in extended remission. Dose-intensive programs may lead to further improvements in survival of selected patients with this disease. 
Tamoxifen in premenopausal patients with metastatic breast cancer: a review. The antiestrogen tamoxifen is the most widely used hormonal therapy for breast cancer. The drug exerts its antiproliferative effects primarily through estrogen receptor (ER)-mediated mechanisms, although other cellular actions may augment tumor inhibition. Clinically, tamoxifen has been less well studied in premenopausal than in postmenopausal patients. The drug has complex endocrine effects that are dependent on the treatment duration and dose, menopausal status, and target organ. In postmenopausal women receiving tamoxifen, serum estrogen levels remain low, and the normally elevated gonadotropin levels decrease. In contrast, serum estrogen levels are strikingly elevated in many premenopausal women, and gonadotropin concentrations are either unchanged or slightly increased. Large systematic trials in metastatic breast cancer have established tamoxifen as the recommended hormonal therapy for postmenopausal women with ER-positive tumors. Tamoxifen is also an active agent for premenopausal metastatic disease, and response rates are comparable to those reported for oophorectomy. Clinical experience with tamoxifen in this younger age group, however, is more limited. Few premenopausal women (less than 400) have been included in phase II and phase III trials. Two randomized trials (total of 160 patients) comparing oophorectomy with tamoxifen do not definitively establish therapeutic equivalence, and a survival advantage for either treatment cannot be excluded. Many questions remain concerning the appropriate role for tamoxifen in premenopausal patients. Still, tamoxifen has an attractive toxicity profile, and it offers a favorable therapeutic alternative for premenopausal women with ER-positive metastatic breast cancer who wish to avoid surgical or radiation castration. 
Structure and expression of the cDNA encoding human neutrophil collagenase. We have isolated and characterized a 2.4-kb cDNA clone encoding human neutrophil collagenase (HNC), a member of the family of matrix metalloproteinases restricted to secondary granules within neutrophils. Partial amino acid sequence was used to deduce oligonucleotide probes. These probes were used to screen a human granulocyte cDNA library derived from messenger RNA (mRNA) from a patient with chronic granulocytic leukemia. Cell-free translation of RNA produced from the cDNA produced a 52-Kd protein that was recognized by anti-HNC antibody. The cDNA clone was sequenced and shown to encode a 467-residue protein whose sequence matched those regions currently known for HNC. The enzyme exhibits 58% homology to human fibroblast collagenase and has the same domain structure. It consists of a 20-residue signal peptide, and an 80-residue propeptide that is lost on autolytic activation by cleavage of an M-L bond. Other regions identified include the autolytic degradation site, the "cysteine switch" residue that is involved in latency and activation, and a putative zinc binding sequence. HNC has six potential N-linked glycosylation sites. The cDNA hybridized to a 3.4-kb mRNA in RNA from a patient with chronic granulocytic leukemia, but not to RNA from uninduced HL60 cells or HL60 cells that had been induced to undergo granulocytic or monocytic maturation with dimethyl sulfoxide or 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol 13-acetate, respectively. These results parallel those seen with lactoferrin and transcobalamin I, two other secondary granule proteins. 
Treatment of chronic pain by epidural spinal cord stimulation: a 10-year experience. Epidural spinal cord stimulation by means of chronically implanted electrodes was carried out on 121 patients with pain of varied benign organic etiology. In 116 patients, the pain was confined to the back and lower extremities and, of these, 56 exhibited the failed-back syndrome. Most patients were referred by a pain management service because of failure of conventional pain treatment modalities. Electrodes were implanted at varying sites, dictated by the location of pain. A total of 140 epidural implants were used: 76 unipolar, 46 Resume electrodes, 12 bipolar, and six quadripolar. Patients were followed for periods ranging from 6 months to 10 years, with a mean follow-up period of 40 months. Forty-eight patients (40%) were able to control their pain by neurostimulation alone. A further 14 patients (12%), in addition to following a regular stimulation program, needed occasional analgesic supplements to achieve 50% or more relief of the prestimulation pain. Pain secondary to arachnoiditis or perineural fibrosis following multiple intervertebral disc operations, when predominantly confined to one lower extremity, seemed to respond favorably to this treatment. Uniformly good results were also obtained in lower-extremity pain secondary to multiple sclerosis. Pain due to advanced peripheral vascular disease of the lower limbs was well controlled, and amputation below the knee was delayed for up to 2 years in some patients. Pain due to cauda equina injury, paraplegic pain, phantom-limb pain, pure midline back pain without radiculopathy, or pain due to primary bone or joint disease seemed to respond less well. Patients who responded to preliminary transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation generally did well with electrode implants. Notable complications included wound infection, electrode displacement or fracturing, and fibrosis at the stimulating tip of the electrode. Three patients in this series died due to unrelated causes. Epidural spinal cord stimulation has proven to be an effective and safe means of controlling pain on a long-term basis in selected groups of patients. The mechanism of action of stimulation-produced analgesia remains unclear; further studies to elucidate it might allow spinal cord stimulation to be exploited more effectively in disorders that are currently refractory to this treatment modality. 
Coronary-heart-disease risk-factor status of the Cretan urban population in the 1980s. The traditional Cretan diet has been associated with low coronary-heart-disease (CHD) mortality rates. This study reports on the prevalence of CHD risk factors among 387 Cretan bank employees. Mean cholesterol concentration has risen by 36% over 26-y; dietary intake has changed: consumption of meat, fish, and cheese has increased and consumption of bread, fruit, and potatoes has decreased. Although the percentage contribution of fat to total energy intake has decreased from 40% to 36%, there has been a reduction in monounsaturated fatty acid consumption and an increase in the consumption of saturated fatty acids whereas the consumption of polyunsaturates has not been altered. Exception for diminished physical activity, the prevalence of other risk factors (smoking, blood pressure, and body mass index) remained relatively stable over this period. These changes in the CHD risk-factor status of the Cretan urban population occurred over a period in which CHD mortality rates are reported to have increased. 
Emergency treatment of headache. Headache is a frequent presenting complaint in the emergency department. Once a diagnosis is established, and significant organic disease can be ruled out, relief of pain must be addressed. Referral for follow-up care and narcotic habituation is a recurrent problem for the emergency physician. This article discusses the differential diagnosis of headache, evaluation of the emergency room patient, and treatment of the patient with headache. 
Isradipine for treatment of acute hypertension after myocardial revascularization. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the efficacy and duration of action of iv isradipine in the control of postoperative hypertension immediately after myocardial revascularization. DESIGN: Prospective, phase 2 trial. SETTING: Surgical ICU, university hospital. PATIENTS: Twenty-one (15 male, six female) patients, ages 49 to 75 yr (mean 65 +/- 5), undergoing elective myocardial revascularization. INTERVENTIONS: Twenty-one patients with postoperative hypertension after coronary artery bypass graft surgery received iv isradipine, a new dihydropyridine calcium-channel antagonist. Mean duration of the isradipine infusion was 96.9 +/- 29 min. Mean dose of isradipine, indexed to weight, was 16.63 +/- 6.66 micrograms/kg (n = 20). MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Twenty of the 21 patients achieved satisfactory BP control. The reduction in mean arterial pressure (MAP), first noted at the 15-min point, was maximal at 1 hr when MAP decreased from 102 +/- 9 mm Hg baseline to 81 +/- 5 mm Hg (p less than .01), accompanied by a significant (p less than .01) decrease in systemic vascular resistance from 1753 +/- 339 baseline to 1180 +/- 229 dyne.sec/cm5. The CVP, pulmonary artery diastolic pressure, and pulmonary artery occlusion pressure did not change significantly. Heart rate and cardiac index increased; however, stroke volume index did not change. CONCLUSIONS: Isradipine is an acceptable agent for the treatment of hypertension in this setting. 
Value of CT in determining the need for angiography when findings of mediastinal hemorrhage on chest radiographs are equivocal. The role of CT in determining the need for angiography in patients with possible thoracic vascular injury resulting from blunt trauma is controversial. During a 24-month period, we prospectively evaluated the results of CT to screen 90 patients with a history of decelerating thoracic trauma for evidence of mediastinal hemorrhage or great vessel abnormality. All patients either had equivocally abnormal mediastinal contours on chest radiographs (64%) or had technically suboptimal chest radiographs owing to body habitus or restriction to the supine projection (36%). Patients with unequivocal signs of mediastinal hemorrhage on chest radiographs underwent immediate arteriography without prior CT. Thoracic CT was interpreted as normal in 63 (77%) patients and no further imaging was performed. Five patients had technically suboptimal CT studies, and CT scans were interpreted as equivocal in six. These 11 patients had normal arteriograms. Sixteen CT scans (18%) demonstrated evidence of mediastinal hemorrhage and/or great vessel contour abnormality. Four (27%) of 15 patients who underwent arteriography had injury to the great vessels. One patient refused to undergo angiography. In 11 patients with CT evidence of mediastinal hemorrhage, major vascular injury was not seen on arteriography. These results suggest a valuable role for CT in determining the need for arteriography to detect potential great vessel injury in patients with blunt decelerating thoracic trauma and equivocally abnormal mediastinal contours on chest radiographs. 
Percutaneous intraarterial thrombolysis in the treatment of thrombosis of lower extremity arterial reconstructions. Vascular grafts may be salvaged with thrombolytic therapy after acute occlusion as an alternative to balloon catheter thrombectomy. From October 1987 to May 1990, 15 arterial bypasses to the lower extremity (infrainguinal saphenous vein [n = 7] or expanded polytetrafluoroethylene [n = 6], and Dacron aortofemoral bifurcation graft limbs [n = 2]) were treated for 30 occulsions with intraarterial urokinase (390,000 IU to 5,808,000 IU) infused from 3 to 40 hours. The origins of 15 graft occlusions were morphologic defects (intimal hyperplasia with anastomotic or conduit stricture), pseudoaneurysm, or progression of disease distal to the graft. Two occlusions were attributed to coagulation disorders. A cause could not be identified for 13 occlusions. Patency was initially restored to all grafts with use of thrombolytic therapy, however, adjunctive surgical thrombectomy to remove persistent thrombus from the graft or outflow vessels was required after six thrombolytic infusions. One graft in the series could not be salvaged leading to below-knee amputation. Graft defects were corrected by balloon angioplasty (n = 7) or surgical revision of the conduit (n = 8). Five significant hemorrhagic complications occurred from the catheter insertion site requiring four emergent surgical procedures and resulting in the death of a fifth patient from a myocardial infarction. This technique allows chemical thrombectomy of branch arteries distal to the graft and inaccessible to a balloon embolectomy catheter, and permits diagnosis of abnormal graft morphology that may be the cause of the graft occlusion. Graft reocclusion can be expected if technical defects in the arterial reconstruction are not revised or hypercoagulable states are not treated. 
Primary malignant melanoma of the oesophagus: case report and review of surgical pathology. Primary malignant melanoma of the oesophagus is both a rare presentation for melanoma and a cause of oesophageal neoplasm. It accounts for less than 0.1% of all primary oesophageal neoplasms. It was first recognised as a primary tumour by de la Pava et al who showed the presence of melanocytes within oesophageal mucosa. This case report includes a review of the surgical pathology. Even though it is a rare lesion it must be considered as a cause of polypoidal oesophageal lesions as both its diagnosis and treatment can present problems. It is usually fatal within one year. 
Incidence and characteristics of preventable iatrogenic cardiac arrests We studied the contribution of iatrogenic illness to cardiac arrest among patients hospitalized in 1981 in a university teaching hospital. During this 1-year period, 28 (14%) of 203 arrests in which resuscitation was attempted followed an iatrogenic complication. Seventeen (61%) of the 28 patients died. The demographic characteristics of patients with iatrogenic arrest did not differ strikingly from those of other patients who arrested. However, patients with iatrogenic arrest were less likely to be in cardiogenic shock or to have suffered an acute myocardial infarction prior to arrest. They were more likely to survive to discharge from the hospital and to be taking digoxin or antiarrhythmic medication prior to arrest. Among the 28 cases of iatrogenic cardiac arrest, 18 (9% of all arrests) might have been prevented by stricter attention to the patient's history, findings on physical examination, and laboratory data. The most common causes of potentially preventable arrest were medication errors and toxic effects (44%) as well as suboptimal response by physicians to clinical signs and symptoms (28%), most frequently dyspnea and tachypnea. Rapid, appropriate response to abnormal drug levels, to electrocardiographic signs of adverse drug effects, and to signs and symptoms of congestive heart failure or toxic effects from digoxin might decrease the incidence of cardiac arrest among hospitalized patients. 
Long-term maintenance treatment of reflux esophagitis with omeprazole. Prospective study in patients with H2-blocker-resistant esophagitis. Thirty-four patients with H2-blocker-resistant reflux esophagitis subsequently healed by 40 mg omeprazole daily entered a maintenance study with 20 mg omeprazole. In 31 evaluable cases the observation period was at least 12 months (mean 24 months). Esophagitis remained in remission in two thirds of patients despite dose reduction. Relapses of esophagitis occurred in 10 cases within six months, which rapidly healed by increasing the omeprazole dose to 40 mg. No further recurrence with 20 mg omeprazole was found later than six months. Peptic strictures primarily requiring repeated dilatation in six patients during healing with omeprazole did not reappear while on omeprazole maintenance. Major side effects that could be attributed to omeprazole were not observed. Gastrin levels remained within or slightly above the normal range in the vast majority. It is concluded that omeprazole maintenance treatment in severe reflux esophagitis is an effective and safe therapy. 
Assessment of the defunctioning efficiency of the loop ileostomy. The defunctioning efficiency of the loop ileostomy has been assessed using a radioisotope and dye technique. The median defunctioning capacity in patients without episodes of fecal discharge per rectum (n = 18) was 99.99 percent and was not affected by body position or the formation of a dependent stoma. In patients (n = 4) who passed fecal material per rectum but who had no stomal retraction, the median defunctioning efficiency was 99.99 percent, and continued fecal discharge was considered to be due to mucopurulent secretion from active distal disease. In patients who passed fecal material per rectum and also had a retracted stoma (n = 4), the defunctioning efficiency was significantly reduced (median = 84.70 [31.2-99.10 percent; P less than 0.01]), owing to the overspill into the distal limb. Two patients underwent stomal revision, with an improvement in defunctioning efficiency to 99.99 percent. 
Endocrine responses to long-term administration of the antiprogesterone RU486 in patients with pelvic endometriosis. OBJECTIVE: To examine endocrine and clinical responses to long-term administration of RU486 in patients with endometriosis. DESIGN: Prospective open trial. SETTING: Faculty practice of the authors. PATIENTS, PARTICIPANTS: Six normally cycling women with endometriosis were recruited. INTERVENTIONS: Subjects received RU486 100 mg/d for 3 months. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S): Hormonal changes during RU486 were compared with control data obtained in the preceding cycle during the early follicular phase. Clinical responses were determined by patient assessment and second-look laparoscopy. RESULTS: All women became amenorrheic, and daily urinary levels of ovarian steroid metabolites remained acyclic. Mean luteinizing hormone (LH) (P less than 0.02) and LH pulse amplitude (P less than 0.05) were increased without changes in LH pulse frequency. An antiglucocorticoid effect was demonstrated by an increase in serum cortisol (P less than 0.01) and adrenocorticotropic hormone (P less than 0.05) levels. Treatment resulted in an improvement in pelvic pain in all subjects without significant change in the extent of disease as evaluated by follow-up laparoscopy. CONCLUSIONS: Daily administration of RU486 results in acyclic ovarian function and improvement in the subjective painful symptoms of endometriosis. 
Fluconazole: a new triazole antifungal agent. Fluconazole is a recently approved agent for the treatment of certain fungal infections. Based on available studies, the drug is clearly effective in oropharyngeal candidiasis in immunosuppressed hosts. Current evidence suggests it may be more efficacious than other azole drugs for oropharyngeal disease. It is probably also effective in other infections due to Candida species, but controlled studies are lacking. Fluconazole is also efficacious in the treatment of cryptococcal meningitis, but recent reports question its use as initial therapy in HIV-infected patients with this illness. The drug, however, is clearly more effective than amphotericin B in the suppression of cryptococcal meningitis in AIDS patients and is the treatment of choice in this situation. 
Hypophysectomy inhibits the synthesis of tumor necrosis factor alpha by rat macrophages: partial restoration by exogenous growth hormone or interferon gamma. We recently demonstrated that GH and interferon-gamma (IFN gamma) act in a similar manner to prime macrophages in vitro and in vivo for enhanced superoxide anion release. In this report we investigated the physiological role of the pituitary gland and GH in in vivo priming of resident peritoneal macrophages for the synthesis of tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF alpha) in vitro. Compared to normal rats, hypophysectomized animals had an 83% reduction in macrophage production of TNF alpha after in vitro stimulation with lipopolysaccharide. Sham operation had no significant effect on the ability of macrophages to secrete TNF alpha in response to lipopolysaccharide. Both native pituitary-derived porcine GH (48 micrograms/rat.9 days) and native pituitary-derived rat GH (96 micrograms/rat.9 days) more than tripled the in vitro production of TNF alpha by macrophages from hypophysectomized rats (342 and 358 vs. 112 U/mg protein for placebo-treated rats, respectively). Each of these preparations of GH also increased growth more than 6-fold in hypophysectomized rats (32 and 30 g vs. 5 g in placebo controls). Heat inactivation of native pituitary-derived porcine GH significantly reduced its in vivo ability to augment both TNF alpha synthesis by macrophages and body growth. Recombinant rat IFN gamma (2000 U/rat.9 days) more than tripled the production of TNF alpha by macrophages from hypophysectomized rats (343 vs. 112 U/mg protein). In contrast to its in vivo effects, addition of GH in vitro to macrophages from hypophysectomized rats did not prime these cells for the synthesis of TNF alpha, indicating an indirect mechanism of action for GH. To further test the biological relevancy of GH with respect to synthesis of TNF alpha, hemorrhagic necrosis of TNF alpha-sensitive murine methyl-cholanthrene-induced tumors was assessed in pituitary-intact mice. Native porcine GH (133 micrograms/mouse.7 days) significantly augmented both the necrosis to tumor ratio and the hemorrhage to tumor ratio. These findings establish the physiological relevance of the pituitary gland and GH in the priming of macrophages for TNF alpha synthesis. 
Mentally retarded individuals--a population at risk? When comparing the aging process of mentally retarded (MR) persons with the nondisabled population, researchers have established an earlier lower limit for the onset of old age for MR persons and a higher mortality rate. The reason for early senescence has not been successfully resolved, but the finding that cardiovascular disorders are the most prevalent form of disease among elderly MR persons suggests a relationship between lifestyles and higher mortality rate. Indeed, studies that evaluated the cardiovascular fitness (CVF) of MR individuals demonstrated substandard levels of fitness. The results of these studies, however, are not conclusive due to variation in test methodologies, motivational factors, and issues of test validity and reliability. Training studies which have purported to determine trainability of this population have also shown confusing results, perhaps attributed to the same protocol inconsistencies. Therefore, the purposes of this article are 1) to review previous methods of evaluating CVF of MR adults and determine whether testing methodologies invalidate the results of these studies, 2) to review training studies involving adult MR individuals and determine whether this population is capable of improving their CVF, and 3) to identify areas where further research is needed to fully describe the functional cardiovascular characteristics of MR adults. 
Case report: cisplatin-induced hemolytic uremic syndrome. Two patients developed noncardiogenic pulmonary edema (NCPE), following red blood cell transfusion in a setting of acute cisplatin nephropathy. One manifested the full picture of hemolytic uremic syndrome, the other had transient features following blood transfusion. We further reviewed the clinical records on blood transfusion for all patients with cisplatin nephropathy. A third case of (NCPE) was identified in a patient with acute renal dysfunction. However, none of the 16 patients with cisplatin-induced, mild stable chronic renal impairment had pulmonary dysfunction or other laboratory evidence for microangiopathy following transfusion. Hemolytic uremic syndrome may be a rare manifestation of cisplatin toxicity. Caution is indicated in transfusing patients with acute platinum nephropathy even in the absence of overt microangiopathy. The pathogenesis of this syndrome and the cause for NCPE is unclear. The literature is reviewed and discussed. 
Ventriculoatrial shunts for hydrocephalus and cardiac valvulopathy: an echocardiographic evaluation. A group of 20 patients with ventriculoatrial shunts placed as surgical treatment for hydrocephalus were evaluated for cardiac lesions, particularly of the tricuspid valve. Patients with histories of septic or thromboembolic events were excluded. In each patient a clinical history, complete physical examination, electrocardiogram, chest x-ray film and M-mode, two-dimensional and pulsed continuous wave and color-coded Doppler echocardiography were performed. Eight patients were found to have cardiac abnormalities including tricuspid valve insufficiency, tricuspid stenosis and insufficiency, and the catheter passing through the foramen ovale into the left atrium. These findings demonstrate that tricuspid valvular lesions are frequent in patients with ventriculoatrial shunts, and that periodic echocardiographic evaluation should be performed routinely. 
Extensive pulmonary embolism presenting as severe adult respiratory distress syndrome after surgical resection of a cornual pregnancy. A rare case of severe adult respiratory distress syndrome associated with a Po2 of 9 mm Hg after surgical resection of a cornual pregnancy at 10 weeks' gestation was treated successfully with positive end-expiratory pressure. The underlying cause, extensive pulmonary embolism, was subsequently revealed. The patient survived without residual brain damage. The possible causes of adult respiratory distress syndrome in pregnancy are discussed. 
Comparison of rubidium-82 positron emission tomography and thallium-201 SPECT imaging for detection of coronary artery disease. The diagnostic performance of rubidium-82 (Rb-82) positron emission tomography (PET) and thallium-201 (Tl-201) single-photon emission-computed tomography (SPECT) for detecting coronary artery disease was investigated in 81 patients (52 men, 29 women). PET studies using 60 mCi of Rb-82 were performed at baseline and after intravenous infusion of 0.56 mg/kg dipyridamole in conjunction with handgrip stress. Tl-201 SPECT was performed after dipyridamole-handgrip stress and, in a subset of patients, after treadmill exercise. Sensitivity, specificity and overall diagnostic accuracy were assessed using both visually and quantitatively interpreted coronary angiograms. The overall sensitivity, specificity and accuracy of PET for detection of coronary artery disease (greater than 50% diameter stenosis) were 84, 88 and 85%, respectively. In comparison, the performance of SPECT revealed a sensitivity of 84%, specificity of 53% (p less than 0.05 vs PET) and accuracy of 79%. Similar results were obtained using either visual or quantitative angiographic criteria for severity of coronary artery disease. In 43 patients without prior myocardial infarction, the sensitivity for detection of disease was 71 and 73%, respectively, similar for both PET and SPECT. There was no significant difference in diagnostic performance between imaging modalities when 2 different modes of stress (exercise treadmill vs intravenous dipyridamole plus handgrip) were used with SPECT imaging. Thus, Rb-82 PET provides improved specificity compared with Tl-201 SPECT for identifying coronary artery disease, most likely due to the higher photon energy of Rb-82 and attenuation correction provided by PET. However, post-test referral cannot be entirely excluded as a potential explanation for the lower specificity of Tl-201 SPECT. 
Treatment of snoring and obstructive sleep apnea with a dental orthosis. A dental orthosis, designed to increase the size of the upper airway by advancing the mandible, was used in 68 patients to treat snoring and varying degrees of obstructive sleep apnea. The orthosis increased the posterior airway space, as assessed by lateral cephalograms. Seven months (range 2 to 25) after beginning use, 75 percent of patients were using the orthosis regularly. Snoring, by report, was improved in all patients but one (p less than 0.001) and was eliminated in 42 percent (95 percent confidence interval 30 to 55 percent). Sleep quality and sleepiness were also reported improved. Apneas and hypopneas, measured before and after use in 20 patients with obstructive sleep apnea, were reduced from an average of 47 to 20 events per hour (p less than 0.001). Oxygenation and sleep disturbance were also improved. Apnea-hypopnea frequency was reduced with treatment to less than 20/h in 13 patients. Residual frequencies greater than 20/h were associated with higher initial frequencies of apneas and hypopneas. Side effects of orthosis use were minor, and no serious complications were observed. The dental orthosis is an effective treatment for the symptom of snoring and can also effectively treat obstructive sleep apnea of moderate severity. 
Prolactin reduction after combined therapy for prolactin macroadenomas. The ability of surgery or bromocriptine to produce endocrine control of a prolactin macroadenoma decreases as the prolactin level increases. Guidelines for the use of multimodality therapy have not been developed for tumors associated with markedly elevated prolactin levels. We reviewed the records of 21 patients with prolactin levels greater than 200 ng/ml treated by transsphenoidal surgery and postoperative radiotherapy with or without a dopamine agonist. Values before and after treatment were available for 19 patients (13 men and 6 women). The mean basal prolactin level before treatment for the entire group was 2410 ng/ml. Surgery and radiotherapy resulted in a 90% reduction and serum prolactin levels within normal limits in 0 of 7 patients, versus the combination of surgery, radiotherapy, and dopamine agonist, which resulted in a 99.5% reduction and values within the normal range in 12 of 12 patients. Spontaneous physiological improvement was not often observed. One woman and two men were able subsequently to have children. A plan for these patients is discussed. 
Stereotactic brain biopsy in the diagnosis of malignant lymphoma. Fifteen patients with cerebral involvement by malignant non-Hodgkin's lymphoma were identified, among more than 200 patients who underwent stereotactic biopsy at The Johns Hopkins Hospital. All but one of these cases were diagnosed accurately by the stereotactic biopsy procedure. In 12 of 14 patients, the material was adequate to classify the lymphoma according to the Working Formulation. Because all but one of the lesions were intermediate or high-grade neoplasms, a diagnosis of lymphoma was often possible by conventional light microscopic examination alone. Monotypic light chain expression was demonstrated by immunohistochemical techniques in six patients, and positivity for B-cell markers was observed in an additional case. In one instance, two stereotactic biopsy specimens were interpreted as being suggestive of lymphoma, but necrosis and inflammation prevented a definitive diagnosis. Nine patients had no known risk factors for cerebral lymphoma, and the diagnosis often was unsuspected clinically. 
Multivariate clinical models and quantitative dipyridamole-thallium imaging to predict cardiac morbidity and death after vascular reconstruction. Patients with peripheral vascular disease have a high prevalence of coronary artery disease and are at increased risk for cardiac morbidity and death after vascular reconstruction. The present study was undertaken to assess the value of 18 clinical parameters, of 7 clinical scoring systems, and of quantitative dipyridamole-thallium imaging for predicting the occurrence of postoperative myocardial infarction or cardiac death. Vascular surgery was performed in 125 patients. Thirteen postoperative cardiac events occurred, including 10 cardiac deaths and 3 nonfatal infarctions. Clinical parameters were not useful in predicting postoperative outcome. All 63 patients with normal scan results or fixed perfusion defects underwent surgery uneventfully, whereas 21% (13/62) of patients with reversible defects had a postoperative cardiac complication. By use of quantitative scintigraphic indexes we found that patients with reversible defects could be stratified into intermediate and high-risk subgroups with postoperative event rates of 5% (2/47) and 85% (11/13), respectively, despite intensive postoperative monitoring and antianginal medication. Thus in patients unable to complete a standard exercise stress test, postoperative outcome cannot be predicted clinically, whereas dipyridamole-thallium imaging successfully identified all patients who had a postoperative cardiac event. By use of quantification we found that patients with reversible defects can be stratified into an intermediate risk subgroup that can undergo surgery with minimal complication rate and a high-risk subgroup that requires coronary angiography. 
A randomized, controlled trial of treatment of alcoholic hepatitis with parenteral nutrition and oxandrolone. II. Short-term effects on nitrogen metabolism, metabolic balance, and nutrition. Patients with moderately severe or severe alcoholic hepatitis, described in a companion paper in this issue, had serial studies of energy and protein metabolism and elemental balances before and during treatment for 21 days with one of four randomly assigned regimens: 1) standard therapy, consisting of abstinence, a balanced, nutritionally adequate diet, and multivitamins; 2) oxandrolone (20 mg orally four times a day) plus standard therapy; 3) nutritional supplementation, consisting of 2 liters of 3.5% crystalline amino acids in 5% dextrose given by peripheral vein (PPN) plus standard therapy; and 4) a combination of the other three treatments. Dietary and intravenous intakes and weights were recorded daily, and weekly averages were calculated. Anthropometric measurements and blood studies were done weekly; blood studies included white blood cell counts and differentials, serum prealbumin, transferrin, and total protein and plasma aminograms. Four-days complete balance studies and measures of 15N,1-13C-leucine metabolism also were performed at baseline and after the treatment period. Major findings were as follows: a) Intakes of total calories and protein were significantly higher in PPN-treated than in other groups. b) All patients had positive elemental balances, both at baseline and at the end of the treatment period. However, those treated with PPN (with or without oxandrolone) had higher positive balances of nitrogen, potassium, phosphorus, and magnesium, indicating improvement in lean body mass. c) Anthropometric measurements showed no significant changes, but measures of the visceral protein compartment (serum prealbumin, transferrin, total protein, total lymphocyte count) improved significantly with time. For most of these variables, increases were significantly greater in those treated with PPN with or without oxandrolone than in the other groups. However, for prealbumin, the increase was greatest in the oxandrolone-treated group d) PPN treatment produced dramatic increases in levels of branched-chain amino acids and improvement in the ratio of plasma branched chain to aromatic amino acids. Other treatments had no effect on plasma aminograms. e) Metabolism of 15N,1-13C-leucine was normal and was not affected significantly by treatment. Therapy with PPN and/or oxandrolone was tolerated well. We conclude that PPN has favorable effects on energy and protein metabolism in florid alcoholic hepatitis; oxandrolone has lesser effects, although it may exert some additional action and particularly increases serum prealbumin levels. The results support the use of nutritional supplementation in therapy of moderately severe or severe alcoholic hepatitis. 
Reversal of a dense, persistent, holohemispheric neurological deficit after an endarterectomy of the carotid artery: case report. The role and timing of a carotid endarterectomy in the setting of an acute ischemic stroke-in-evolution remain controversial. Although computed tomographic (CT) scans typically show no abnormalities in the acute stage, it is generally agreed that a dense neurological deficit (hemiplegia) and/or multiple modality neurological disturbance (involving motor, sensory, gaze, and visual field impairment) represent contraindications to surgical intervention. We present a case of an acute right holohemispheric neurological deficit including dense hemiplegia, hemisensory loss, gaze disturbance, hemineglect, and impaired level of consciousness. This persisted for 4 days while serial CT scans showed no evidence of infarction. Angiography revealed pre-occlusive stenosis of the right internal carotid artery with sluggish antegrade flow. The anterior collaterals of the circle of Willis were impaired, and the right middle cerebral artery territory filled via the posterior communicating artery. Despite the dense neurological deficit persisting for 4 days, a carotid endarterectomy was performed. Gradual neurological improvement was noted within hours of the operation, and all neurological deficits resolved within the subsequent 3 days. This case is consistent with prolonged holohemispheric hemodynamic compromise below the threshold of neurological dysfunction, but above the threshold of tissue infarction ("idling neurons"). Features assisting in the recognition of this unusual scenario and the indications and risks of revascularization in this setting are discussed. 
William Heberden and Myron Prinzmetal: angina pectoris. The most significant accounts of angina pectoris appeared in the medical literature separated by nearly two centuries. They were Heberden's initial description of classic angina and Prinzmetal's report of the variant form. Angina pectoris represents a transient myocardial oxygen deficiency. It is usually related to atherosclerotic coronary artery disease, but there are a number of less common etiologies, most notably aortic stenosis. Stable and unstable forms exist, with stable angina being further subclassified as being of one of four patterns: classic, variant, atypical, and angina equivalent. 
The Purkinje cell and its afferents in human hereditary ataxia. The cerebellar cortex in patients with autosomal dominant and recessive ataxia was studied by Golgi impregnation and immunocytochemistry in order to gain further insight into the pathogenesis of neuronal atrophy which accompanies these disorders. Monoclonal antisera were used to visualize phosphorylated and non-phosphorylated neurofilament proteins, and a synapse-specific protein (P38; synaptophysin). Golgi stain and immunocytochemistry for non-phosphorylated neurofilament protein revealed partial or complete loss of distal Purkinje cell dendrities in the dominant cases and in one recessive case. Many preserved parallel fibres were shown by the monoclonal antibody to phosphorylated neurofilament protein. This antibody also gave strong reaction product in torpedoes. Axosomatic and axodendritic terminals on Purkinje cells were reduced in number, and loss of mossy fiber terminals was revealed by monoclonal anti-P38. The described methods provided additional morphological evidence of the heterogeneity of the hereditary ataxias. Purkinje cell atrophy progressed from loss and simplification of the dendritic tree to disappearance of the cell body. While these cells appeared to be especially vulnerable, other neurons of the molecular and granular layers were not exempt. There was evidence that at least some extracerebellar afferents, such as mossy fibers, were also affected by the disease process. 
Salvage therapy with high-dose chemotherapy and autologous bone marrow support in the treatment of primary nonseminomatous mediastinal germ cell tumors. The authors reported their experience with the use of high-dose chemotherapy and autologous bone marrow rescue (ABMR) as salvage therapy in the treatment of patients with recurrent and refractory primary nonseminomatous mediastinal germ cell tumors (PMGCT). Since 1987, the authors have treated 12 patients with PMGCT with high-dose carboplatin (1500 mg/m2 to 1800 mg/m2) and etoposide (1200 mg/m2 to 1350 mg/m2) (in two patients ifosfamide [10 g/m2] was added) with ABMR. Patients were either in second relapse or cisplatin refractory (progression within 4 weeks of last cisplatin dosing). They had received a median of two prior chemotherapy regimens (range, one to three), all had had prior cisplatin therapy, and most had failed ifosfamide-based therapy. Six patients were cisplatin refractory and of these only one achieved a partial response (PR) that was of short duration. It was planned that all patients would undergo two rounds of therapy; however, only 5 of 12 patients received two courses. The remainder had only one round of therapy either because of inadequate response (three patients) or excessive toxicity (four patients). There were four patients who died in the peritransplant period due to sepsis (two patients) or bleeding (two patients). The median survival of the group was 107 days (range, 14 days to 347 days). No patient achieved a complete remission, but there were six partial remissions, four with stable disease, and two with progressive disease. The use of high-dose carboplatin and etoposide with or without ifosfamide and ABMR was not effective in the treatment of this group of patients with PMGCT who were in second relapse or cisplatin refractory. 
Predictors of physical functioning after a cardiac event. An increased understanding of the factors that promote or hinder patients' return to optimal activity levels after a cardiac event is necessary to help them achieve this goal. Accordingly, the purpose of this study was to examine psychologic resources, depression, physical recovery, and illness severity for their relationships with subjective and objective physical functioning (exercise data). A correlational survey design was used to assess patients' (n = 46) illness responses 9 weeks after the cardiac event. Patients also participated in a symptom-limited exercise test. The findings suggested that the individual's return to greater activity levels after a cardiac illness was associated with less depression and illness severity, and higher levels of objective physical functioning, physical recovery, and self-esteem. Further, patients' objective physical functioning was associated not only with greater subjective physical functioning but also with greater levels of physical recovery and mastery. 
Electronic fetal heart monitoring, auscultation, and neonatal outcome. In a large randomized, controlled study of fetal heart rate monitoring with either continuous electronic fetal heart monitoring or auscultation at specified intervals, only one pattern of deviation in the fetal heart rate correlated significantly with neonatal neurologic examinations at 0 to 48 hours and 72 hours to 1 week: late decelerations in stage 1 and in stage 2. Other variables from labor and delivery, specifically, duration of labor after hospital admission, failure of labor to progress, number of fetal scalp pH values, and presence of meconium were important predictors of neonatal outcome in the regression analyses. The fetal heart rate deviations did contribute significantly to the percent variance accounted for in the regression analyses with neonatal outcomes of Apgar scores at 1 and 5 minutes and serial neonatal neurologic examinations. 
Hydrocortisone inhibits rat basophilic leukemia cell mediator release induced by neutrophil-derived histamine releasing activity as well as by anti-IgE. We determined the ability of hydrocortisone to inhibit rat basophilic leukemia cell mediator release induced by anti-IgE and by neutrophil-derived histamine-releasing activity (HRA-N). Serotonin release induced by HRA-N and anti-IgE was inhibited by 78 +/- 5 and 70 +/- 4%, respectively (IC50 7.5 x 10(-7)M) by hydrocortisone (10(-5)M). HRA-N does not cause arachidonic acid metabolism, however, anti-IgE induced the generation of PGD2 and leukotriene (LT)C4, and the generation of both mediators was inhibited by 10(-5)M hydrocortisone (IC50 = 4.8 x 10(-7)M, and 3.6 x 10(-9)M, respectively). Inhibition required at least 5 to 6 h of hydrocortisone exposure and was maximal after 22 h. The observed effects of hydrocortisone could be reproduced by human recombinant lipocortin-I (5 x 10(-7)M). Hydrocortisone, 10(-5)M, was a less potent inhibitor of calcium ionophore A23187-mediated serotonin release and PGD2 and LTC4 generation (inhibition of 20 +/- 2, 17 +/- 10, and 37 +/- 10%, respectively). Inasmuch as A23187-induced stimulation is not dependent on receptor coupling, the enhanced ability of hydrocortisone to inhibit IgE- and HRA-N-mediated events as compared with A23187 suggests that one possible site of action of hydrocortisone may be interruption of receptor-effector signals. In the presence of arachidonic acid, hydrocortisone-treated cells released as much LTB4 and PGD2 as control cells, however, serotonin release and LTC4 generation were inhibited 50 and 55%, respectively. Thus, these data suggest that hydrocortisone has three possible sites of action: 1) inhibition of phospholipase A2 activity, 2) inhibition of glutathione-s-transferase, and 3) inhibition of serotonin release by a third mechanism, possibly by interrupting the coupling of receptor and effector systems. 
Geographic variations in the histologic characteristics of the gastric mucosa. Histologic sections of 205 gastrectomy specimens, which were obtained for benign and malignant diseases, were reviewed. All patients were Mexican nationals. The following histologic features were recorded: intestinal metaplasia, intramucosal cysts, ciliated gastric cells, and different types of pyloric cells ("ordinary"; with granular cytoplasm; with small cytoplasmic vacuoles; with large cytoplasmic vacuoles; or with homogeneous "glassy" cytoplasm). The percentage of specimens showing intestinal metaplasia was similar in those containing gastric ulcers (42.7%) or adenocarcinomas (50.0%). Intestinal metaplasia was decreased in men 59 years of age or older and in women 69 years of age or older. Diffuse-type adenocarcinoma accounted for 90% of the gastric tumors. Only 3 of the 205 specimens (1.9%) contained intramucosal cysts, and only 1 (0.4%) showed ciliated cells. Pyloric cells with granular cytoplasm were observed in 21.2% of the specimens, and pyloric cells with small cytoplasmic vacuoles were seen in 1.9%. Pyloric cells with large vacuoles or "glassy" cytoplasm were not found in any case. These results indicate differences in the proportions of several histopathologic findings in the gastric mucosa, between Mexicans and other ethnic groups that have been investigated in previous surveys. The authors' findings support the hypothesis that different environmental factors, acting in disparate geographic regions, may account for dissimilarities in the histologic appearance of "normal gastric mucosa.". 
T-lymphocyte dysfunctions occurring together with apical gut epithelial cell autoantibodies. Gut epithelial cell autoantibodies have been considered a hallmark of autoimmune enteropathy, a disorder occurring in children with protracted diarrhea of unknown etiology. Four patients (two male and two female) with such autoantibodies were studied. Immunofluorescence analysis showed two different disjunctive staining patterns: complement-fixing apical (three of four) and cytoplasmic (the remaining fourth one), which are shown to be directed against different structures. All three patients positive for complement-fixing apical gut epithelial cell autoantibodies had abnormal T-cell responses in vitro, one of them with an immunoglobulin G2 immunoglobulin deficiency and another with an immunoglobulin A deficiency. An immunoglobulin A deficiency without T-cell alterations was also diagnosed in the cytoplasmic gut epithelial cell autoantibody-positive patient. These findings suggest that different immunologic alterations (either a T-cell abnormality or immunoglobulin deficiency) may favor the appearance of gut epithelial cell autoantibodies (complement-fixing apical or cytoplasmic, respectively). Furthermore, these autoantibodies should not be considered a specific marker of autoimmune enteropathy, because they may not always be associated with such a disease: two patients with apical gut epithelial cell autoantibodies showed no signs of intestinal lesion or diarrhea. 
Age-related complications and optimal choice of artificial heart valves in elderly patients. The use of bioprosthetic heart valves in elderly patients is presently advocated by many since implanting mechanical valves are considered to result in unacceptable rates of thromboembolism and bleeding. However the somewhat limited durability of bioprostheses has to be acknowledged since a group of elderly patients will eventually require a reoperation due to tissue failure. We have evaluated our policy to implant mechanical heart valve prostheses even in elderly patients based on the conception that we believe that anticoagulation in this group of patients can be handled with a low rate of complications. 
Massive incisional hernia: abdominal wall replacement with Marlex mesh. Marlex (polypropylene) mesh was used to replace the abdominal wall in massive incisional herniation in 50 patients. Seventeen unsuccessful attempts at primary repair had previously been made on nine patients. Patient follow-up ranged from 6 to 120 months (mean = 45 months). There was minor hernia recurrence in four (8 per cent) patients. In each instance it was due to partial detachment of the peripheral fixation of the patch. Complications were: wound infection, four (8 per cent); wound seroma, two (4 per cent); wound haematoma, one (2 per cent); and wound sinus, six (12 per cent). Complications did not necessitate removal of the patch in any case. Inadequate peripheral attachment of the patch has been the only cause of hernia recurrence and should be avoidable. 
Clinical characteristics of transient ischemic attacks in black patients. We analyzed the clinical, CT, and angiographic findings in 50 black patients with carotid transient ischemic attacks (TIAs). Thirty-two percent had TIAs lasting less than 1 hour, 26% had TIAs lasting 1 to 6 hours, and 42% had TIAs lasting 6 to 24 hours. Fifty-two percent of TIA patients had CT evidence of cerebral infarction despite complete clinical recovery. CT was abnormal in two of 16 (13%) patients with TIAs lasting less than 1 hour; however, CT was abnormal in 24 of 34 (70%) patients with TIAs lasting longer than 1 hour. Angiographic findings of extracranial carotid disease appropriate to TIA symptoms were present in 12 (24%) patients. Two patients in whom the TIA episode lasted less than 1 hour later had clinical cerebral infarction, whereas 20 patients with longer-duration TIAs developed ischemic stroke within 4 months. Of these black TIA patients, 22 (44%) developed clinical cerebral infarction. 
Bilateral spontaneous perilymph fistulae: a diagnostic and management dilemma. In this article, we present a case of bilateral perilymph fistulae. This entity is rare and always presents a diagnostic problem. Bilateral perilymph fistulae are more common in children and should be suspected when bilateral ear symptoms and congenital temporal bone radiographic anomalies are present. Previous trauma or barotrauma may be absent. When a patient manifests bilateral ear symptoms and a fistula has been identified and repaired in one ear, a second fistula should be suspected in the contralateral ear, especially if the fistula test is positive. 
Influence of dilated cardiomyopathy, myocarditis and cardiac transplantation on the relation between plasma atrial natriuretic factor and atrial pressures. To determine whether dilated cardiomyopathy, myocarditis or cardiac transplantation affect the relation between plasma immunoreactive atrial natriuretic factor (ANF) and cardiac filling pressures, right atrial plasma ANF concentration, pulmonary arterial wedge pressure and right atrial pressure were measured in patients with dilated cardiomyopathy (n = 48), dilated cardiomyopathy secondary to myocarditis (n = 20) and prior cardiac transplantation (n = 34). ANF level significantly correlated with both pulmonary arterial wedge and right atrial pressures in patients with dilated cardiomyopathy; however, the presence or absence of myocarditis did not significantly alter these relations (p = 0.88 and p = 0.33 for interaction terms, respectively). For the combined group the ANF-pulmonary arterial wedge pressure relation had a slope of 8.1 pg/ml/mm Hg (95% confidence interval (CI), 5.4 to 10.8; p = 0.0001) and the ANF-right atrial pressure relation a slope of 13.6 pg/ml/mm Hg (CI, 8.5 to 18.7; p = 0.0001). Receiver operator curve analysis identified an optimal dividing point of ANF 150 pg/ml with 100% (CI, 72 to 100%) of patients with right atrial pressure greater than or equal to 8 mm Hg having ANF greater than or equal to 150 pg/ml, but only 56% (CI, 42 to 69%) with pressure less than 8 mm Hg having ANF less than 150 pg/ml. Unlike the patients with cardiomyopathy (with or without myocarditis), cardiac transplant recipients displayed no correlation between ANF level and either pulmonary arterial wedge pressure (p = 0.50) or right atrial pressure (p = 0.29) despite similarly elevated ANF concentrations (mean +/- standard deviation 168 (83) pg/ml in transplant patients versus 185 (114) pg/ml in cardiomyopathy patients). It is concluded that left and right intracardiac pressures are important determinants of circulating ANF level unaffected by inflammation in patients with cardiomyopathy. 
Cyst of the ligamentum flavum: report of six cases. Six cases of cyst of the ligamentum flavum with compression of a lumbar nerve root are reported. All patients exhibited recurrent back pain and sciatica. Investigation included computed tomography, myelography, or both. The correct diagnosis was reached before operation in only half the patients. High-resolution computed tomography performed in the four last patients outlined the cystic lesion with its low-density center. Surgical excision was performed in all patients. Microscopic examination showed a dense fibrous cyst arising from the ligamentum flavum. The lumen contained myxoid or necrotic material, but no epithelial lining. Cysts of the ligamentum flavum must be considered in the differential diagnosis of causes of sciatica. A firm radiological diagnosis may, at present, still require myelography combined with high-resolution computed tomography. Differentiation from synovial or ganglion cysts of the spine is discussed. 
Histopathology of incipient fundus flavimaculatus. A 9-year-old boy was diagnosed with fundus flavimaculatus in his left eye. The boy's fellow eye was enucleated at 16 months of age for retinoblastoma. The authors reviewed the material submitted for histopathologic examination and found that the retinal pigment epithelial cells demonstrated increased autofluorescence and increased reactivity to periodic acid-Schiff staining. Many cells had their melanin granules displaced toward the cell apex. The retinal pigment epithelial changes are consistent with previous histopathologic findings in fundus flavimaculatus and imply that the structural changes are seen in early life. 
Head-injured patients who talk and deteriorate into coma. Analysis of 211 cases studied with computerized tomography. Of 838 patients with severe head injuries admitted since the introduction of computerized tomography, 211 (25.1%) talked at some time between trauma and subsequent deterioration into coma. Of these 211 patients, 89 (42.2%) had brain contusion/hematoma, 46 (21.8%) an epidural hematoma, 35 (16.6%) a subdural hematoma, and 41 (19.4%) did not show focal mass lesions. Thus, four of every five patients who deteriorated into coma after suffering an apparently nonsevere head injury had a mass lesion potentially requiring surgery: the mass was intracerebral in 52.3% of the cases and extracerebral in 47.6%. Patients aged 20 years or less had a 39% chance of having a nonfocal mass lesion (diffuse brain damage), a 29% chance of having an epidural hematoma, and a 32% chance of having an intradural mass lesion; patients over 40 years had only a 3% chance of having a nonfocal mass lesion, an 18% chance of having an epidural hematoma, and a 79% chance of having a intradural mass lesion. Sixty-eight (32.2%) patients died and 143 (67.8%) survived. The following were independent outcome predictors (in order of significance): Glasgow Coma Scale score following deterioration into coma, the highest intracranial pressure during the patient's course, the degree of midline shift, the type of intracranial lesion, and the age of the patient. In contrast, the mechanism of injury, the verbal Glasgow Coma Scale score during the lucid interval, and the length of time until deterioration or until operative intervention did not influence the final result. 
Transformation-dependent activation of urokinase-type plasminogen activator by a plasmin-independent mechanism: involvement of cell surface membranes. Transformed cells produce elevated levels of the urokinase-type plasminogen activator (u-PA), which has been linked with the invasive or migratory phenotype of these cells. The u-PA is secreted and normally maintained in the inactive, single-chain form (scu-PA) and it has been assumed that natural activation occurs via a plasmin-mediated cleavage converting scu-PA to the active, two-chain form (tcu-PA). We now demonstrate that secreted scu-PA in Rous sarcoma virus-transformed chicken embryo fibroblast (RSVCEF) cultures is activated by an endogenous, plasmin-independent mechanism. Normal CEFs and CEFs infected with a temperature-sensitive RSV mutant and incubated at the nonpermissive temperature do not activate scu-PA. Conditioned medium harvested from plasmin-free cultures of RSVCEFs contains active tcu-PA as determined by two independent methods. The scu-PA is progressively converted with time in culture and requires the presence of intact cells or a plasma membrane-enriched fraction. When added to RSVCEF cultures, a synthetic peptide corresponding to residues 20-41 of the growth factor domain of chicken u-PA blocks the conversion to tcu-PA, and scu-PA accumulates in the cultures. These results suggest that scu-PA is secreted by cells, becomes bound to a u-PA receptor, and is proteolytically converted to active tcu-PA by a catalytic mechanism on the surface of RSV-transformed fibroblasts. 
Early prevention of left ventricular dysfunction after myocardial infarction with angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibition [published erratum appears in Lancet 1991 May 11;337(8750):1174] Left ventricular dysfunction can be improved with angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibition started 1 week after myocardial infarction or later. To see whether earlier intervention may confer greater benefit, a double-blind study was carried out in which 100 patients with Q wave myocardial infarction, but without clinical heart failure, were randomly allocated treatment with captopril 50 mg twice daily or placebo starting 24-48 h after onset of symptoms. Left ventricular volumes were measured regularly during 3 months of treatment and after a 48 h withdrawal period by means of two-dimensional echocardiography. The placebo group showed significant increases in left ventricular end-diastolic (LVEDVI) and end-systolic (LVESVI) volume indices, with the ejection fraction unchanged. By contrast, the captopril group showed a slight but not significant rise in LVEDVI and a significant reduction in LVESVI with ejection fraction increased significantly. At 3 months there was a 4.6% difference in the change in ejection fraction from baseline between the groups (p less than 0.0001). Most of the treatment benefit was evident at 1 month and there were no changes in left ventricular volumes after 48 h withdrawal of treatment at 3 months. Heart failure requiring treatment with frusemide developed in 7 patients in each group during the study period; 3 of these (1 captopril-treated, 2 placebo-treated) had to be withdrawn from the trial with severe heart failure requiring open treatment. Thus early treatment with captopril is effective in preventing the ventricular dilatation that can occur after Q wave myocardial infarction. 
Loss of heterozygosity on the short arm of chromosome 17 is associated with high proliferative capacity and DNA aneuploidy in primary human breast cancer. Loss of heterozygosity (LOH) on the short arm of chromosome 17 (17p) was found in 27 of 52 (52%) previously untreated primary breast cancers. There was a significant correlation between this 17p allelic loss and two parameters associated with aggressive tumor behavior: high cellular proliferative fraction and DNA aneuploidy. These correlations with high cellular proliferative fraction and DNA aneuploidy were not found in tumors with LOH at nine other chromosome locations. The p53 gene, a putative tumor suppressor gene located at 17p13, was examined for aberrations to determine whether it is the target for the 17p LOH in breast cancer. Unlike other types of human cancer, there were no homozygous deletions or rearrangements of the p53 gene, and only 2 of 13 (15%) were mutated in the conserved region where mutational "hot spots" have been previously located. Therefore, we hypothesize that, in breast cancer, either loss or inactivation of gene(s) on chromosome 17p other than the p53 gene or a different mechanism of p53 gene inactivation may be responsible for the observed high labeling index and DNA aneuploidy associated with LOH at 17p. 
Transurethral resection of prostate prior to definitive irradiation for prostate cancer. Lack of correlation with treatment outcome. From 1970 through 1983, 107 patients with newly diagnosed adenocarcinoma of the prostate were treated with radiotherapy with curative intent at Duke University Medical Center. Forty-five patients (42%) underwent transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP) for diagnostic and/or therapeutic purposes prior to beginning radiotherapy. Sixty-one patients (57%) were diagnosed by needle biopsy. TURP and needle biopsy groups were comparable (age, elevated acid phosphatase, early [A2, B] and late [C, D1] disease stages, and follow-up). TURP patients were more likely to have poorly differentiated tumors and were more often given concurrent hormonal therapy. Both univariate and multivariate analyses to study the effect of TURP on patients with prostate cancer treated with radiotherapy were done. We were unable to demonstrate any adverse impact of TURP on the outcome of radiation therapy for prostate cancer. This issue remains controversial and should be addressed in a prospective, randomized trial. 
Cerebral potentials evoked by painful, laser stimuli in patients with syringomyelia. Brief cutaneous heat stimuli generated by a CO2 laser were used to elicit late somatosensory evoked cerebral potentials (SEPc) in 10 patients with syringomyelia. For comparison, early and late cerebral potentials in response to electrical nerve stimuli (SEPn) were recorded in the same session. In 8 patients with localized impairment of pain and temperature sensitivity we found complete absence of SEPc after stimulation of the affected area; in another patient with similar sensory deficits, the SEPc was grossly attenuated and delayed. In 1 patient with intact pain sensitivity but absent temperature sensitivity, a well defined SEPc could be recorded. Both early cortical SEPn and late SEPn in response to conventional nerve stimuli were normal in all patients and thus did not differentiate control and affected areas. These data indicate that alteration of SEPc correlates with altered pain sensitivity in patients with a circumscribed spinal lesion. SEPc may thus be used as a neurophysiological test in the assessment of hypalgesic dermatomes. 
The role of the transcerebellar view in the detection of fetal central nervous system anomaly. The current resolution of antenatal ultrasonography permits the sonologist to visualize and critically evaluate the cerebellum and cisterna magna. Abnormalities in the size and shape of these structures will assist the sonologist in the detection of the majority of central nervous system malformations. 
Invasive aspergillosis of the maxilla in an immunocompromised patient. Patients who are immunocompromised have a high susceptibility to infection, which can be fatal. Studies have shown that patients receiving chemotherapeutic and adjunctive medications have inhibited inflammatory response to microbes, particularly those increasing the potential for the development of invasive infection. Aspergillus is a fungus often found in the atmosphere. Colonization of Aspergillus in the upper respiratory tract is common. In the immunocompromised patient, Aspergillus flavus is found to be the most frequent fungus cultured in the maxillary sinus. Because of the depressed immunologic state of the patient, A. flavus can differentiate into hyphal forms producing toxins that destroy epithelial tissues. Penetration of Aspergillus into connective and vascular tissue produces thrombosis and ultimately necrosis of hard and soft tissue. 
Total parenteral nutrition and tumor metastasis. A major clinical concern with providing total parenteral nutrition to the tumor-bearing host is the potential to stimulate tumor growth. This study was performed to determine the effect of total parenteral nutrition on primary tumor growth and spontaneous pulmonary metastasis in Lobund rats with subcutaneous prostate adenocarcinoma (PA-III) implants. Significant acceleration of primary tumor growth and tumor metastasis occurred in animals receiving parenteral nutrition consisting of amino acids, dextrose, and lipid or standard enteral nutrition compared to control animals. This study represents the first report of stimulating tumor metastasis with specific parenteral nutrients and clearly indicates that both primary tumor growth and tumor metastasis can be altered by exogenous substrate administration. 
Peptic ulcer pathophysiology. Despite extensive research, the etiology of peptic ulcer disease remains unclear. Given the multiple processes that control acid and pepsin secretion and defense and repair of the gastroduodenal mucosa, it is likely that the cause of ulceration differs between individuals. Acid and pepsin appear to be necessary but not sufficient ingredients in the ulcerative process. It is clear that the majority of gastric ulcers and a substantial number of duodenal ulcers do not have increased gastric acid secretion. Recent research has focused more on protection and repair of the stomach and duodenum. NSAIDs cause a significant number of gastric and duodenal ulcers; this is probably due to inhibition of prostaglandin production with loss of its protective effects. In the absence of NSAIDs and gastrinoma, it appears that most gastric ulcers and all duodenal ulcers occur in the setting of H. pylori infection. Evidence is mounting in support of H. pylori as a necessary ingredient in the ulcerative process, similar to acid and pepsin. It is not known whether the bacteria or the accompanying inflammation is the more important factor in the pathophysiology. Although the pathophysiology of gastric ulcer and duodenal ulcer is similar, there are clearly differences between the two groups. Duodenal ulcer is typified by H. pylori infection and duodenitis and in many cases impaired duodenal bicarbonate secretion in the face of moderate increases in acid and peptic activity. These facts suggest the following process: increased peptic activity coupled with decreased duodenal buffering capacity may lead to increased mucosal injury and result in gastric metaplasia. In the presence of antral H. pylori, the gastric metaplasia can become colonized and inflamed. The inflammation or the infection itself then disrupts the process of mucosal defense or regeneration resulting in ulceration. A cycle of further injury and increased inflammation with loss of the framework for regeneration may then cause a chronic ulcer. Gastric ulcer often occurs with decreased acid-peptic activity, suggesting that mucosal defensive impairments are more important. The combination of inflammation, protective deficiencies, and moderate amounts of acid and pepsin may be enough to induce ulceration. Many questions remain in understanding the pathophysiology of peptic ulcer disease. The physiology and pathophysiology of mucosal regeneration and the mechanisms by which H. pylori and inflammation disrupt normal gastroduodenal function will be fruitful areas of future investigation. 
Prostaglandin-stimulated recovery of the human duodenal epithelium: effects of misoprostol on ethanol damage. This study was designed to determine whether prostaglandins can stimulate the repair of human duodenal epithelium. Ten healthy volunteers were given 50 ml 40% ethanol through an endoscope onto the duodenal mucosa 1-7 cm from the pyloric sphincter; 3 min later, misoprostol (200 micrograms) or inert vehicle (5 ml) was given locally in the same way. One and 5 h later, endoscopy was repeated to evaluate the damage. The conditions of the mucosa were evaluated by endoscopy and by scanning and transmission electron microscopy in biopsies taken at time 0 and 3 min, 1 and 5 h after ethanol. The study was double-blind with a cross-over balanced design. Three minutes after ethanol administration, the duodenal mucosa showed hyperemia with hemorrhagic lesions. Under the electron microscope, the lesions were caused by vascular engorgement or red blood cell extravasation into the submucosa; the epithelium underlining lesions showed loss of superficial cells and damage to the upper layer of the mucosa. One hour after ethanol, there was a striking difference between the two treatment groups, with a substantial recovery of the duodenal epithelium in the misoprostol-treated volunteers. Although spontaneous recovery was evident in the control group, there was also a significant difference at 5 h. Our results suggest that prostaglandins are able to stimulate the recovery of the duodenal epithelium after acute damage. 
Relation between p53 overexpression and established prognostic factors in breast cancer. The nuclear phosphoprotein p53 is expressed in all normal cells and appears to function in cell cycle regulation. Abnormally high levels of the protein are found in many different types of cancer. In breast carcinoma overexpression of p53 is associated with point mutations within highly conserved regions of the p53 gene. These altered genes encode stable p53 proteins that can be detected by standard immunohistochemical techniques unable to detect rapidly degraded wild-type protein. The level of p53 expression in 184 primary breast cancer specimens was assessed by immunohistochemical analysis and related to the following established prognostic factors for breast cancer: age, stage, metastatic involvement, concentration of estrogen and progesterone receptors, proliferative index, and HER-2/neu overexpression. Fifty (27%) of these primary breast cancer specimens had widespread overexpression of p53. Highly significant associations were found between p53 overexpression and late stage, metastatic spread, and low concentration of progesterone receptors. The presence of elevated levels of mutant p53 may itself be a prognostic factor in human breast cancer and activation of this oncogene may be important in the ability of a tumor to metastasize. 
Angiographic management of retroperitoneal hemorrhage from renal angiomyolipoma in polycystic kidney disease. Angiographic management of bilateral angiomyolipomas complicated by hemorrhage in autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease is presented. The patient had mild stigmata of tuberous sclerosis, and a family history of tuberous sclerosis and autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease. The radiographic features at diagnosis, and those present during and after embolization are described. Radiological criteria for diagnosis and successful control of bleeding with intra-arterial selective embolization are discussed. Radiographic features before, during and after embolization are exhibited. 
Combined interferon alfa and doxorubicin in the treatment of advanced cervical cancer. Interferon alfa and doxorubicin have been shown to have synergistic effects when tested in vitro with cells derived from cervical cancers. A clinical trial was designed, testing interferon alfa plus doxorubicin in patients with advanced or recurrent cervical cancers. Twenty-one patients were given interferon alfa, 10 million units per square meter intramuscularly and 10 million units per square meter intravenously over a 30-minute infusion period. One hour later 20 mg/m2 doxorubicin was given intravenously slowly over a 2-hour period. Treatments were repeated once weekly for 3 weeks. Initial response evaluation was done at week 5, and treatment was continued on an every-other-week schedule for patients showing favorable responses or stable disease. Bone marrow, hepatic, and renal toxicities were minimal. Fever and malaise were the major sources of toxicity. Of the 17 evaluable patients, six had clinical partial responses. Two of the responders have enjoyed more than 5 years' survival. This regimen is well tolerated and does have efficacy in some patients with advanced cervical cancers. 
Proteus syndrome. Ultrastructural study of linear verrucous and depigmented nevi. Proteus syndrome is a rare hamartomatous disorder characterized by multifocal overgrowths that can involve any structure of the body. Clinical manifestations include macrodactyly, hemihypertrophy, subcutaneous masses, exostosis, cerebroid thickening of palms and soles, and linear skin lesions. About 50 cases have been described, but the ultrastructural features of the linear skin lesions have not been characterized. We describe the clinical, histologic, and ultrastructural findings for a 30-year-old patient who had a mild form of Proteus syndrome with linear lesions characterized by a mixed pattern of hyperkeratosis and depigmentation. Light microscopy of the linear nevus showed acanthosis and hyperorthokeratosis. Electron microscopy revealed extensive vacuolation at the interface between melanocytes and keratinocytes, with large aggregations of densely packed granules in the intercellular space. Melanocytes showed only slight degenerative changes. An immunohistochemical study of the expression of epidermal growth factor receptors revealed no significant abnormalities. 
Causes of death in patients with tuberous sclerosis. Of the 355 patients with tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) examined at the Mayo Clinic, 49 had died (9 of causes other than TSC). We attempted to determine what pattern of organ involvement occurred most often in the 40 patients who died of TSC. One baby died of cardiac failure due to cardiac rhabdomyomas, and one child died of rupture of an aneurysm of the thoracic aorta. Eleven patients died of renal disease, which was the commonest cause of death. Ten patients died as a result of brain tumors, and four patients (who were 40 years of age or older) died of lymphangiomyomatosis of the lung. Thirteen patients with severe mental handicaps died of either status epilepticus or bronchopneumonia; in all but one of these patients, the only source of information was the death certificate. Survival curves show a decreased survival for patients with TSC in comparison with that for the general population. Patients with TSC need lifelong follow-up for early detection of potentially life-threatening complications. 
Descriptive epidemiologic study of epilepsy syndromes in a district of northwest Tuscany, Italy. To evaluate the prevalence of epilepsy syndromes in a district in Northwest Tuscany (Vecchiano, 9,952 inhabitants) we identified all suspected cases (probable epilepsy) from several information sources: files of local doctors, prescriptions of antiepileptic drugs (AEDs), hospital files from the center for epilepsy at the University of Pisa, medical files from university and hospital departments in Pisa, and files of the school doctors and social workers in the district of Vecchiano. All persons suspected of having epilepsy were examined; 51 cases of epilepsy were found, i.e., a prevalence rate of 5.1 in 1,000. During a previous study performed in the same district with the "house-to-house" method, a lower rate was found. Our study confirms that use of different epidemiologic investigational methods can produce different results. 
Future directions of laser phototherapy for diagnosis and treatment of malignancies: fantasy, fallacy, or reality? A new and highly promising adjunctive modality for the diagnosis and therapy of malignancies is under development using lasers and tumor targeting dyes. To reach the eventual goal of clinical treatment, several current "fantasies and fallacies" regarding laser applications in medicine must be identified and their problems clearly outlined. A multidisciplinary scientific approach is also required to enable the clinical practicality of this laser targeting approach. Many new dyes and laser wavelengths are being tested to improve specific tumor uptake and/or retention, lower systemic toxicity, increase tissue penetration, and identify fluorochromes with synergistic properties to further enhance laser tumoricidal effects. Rapid technological advancements in magnetic resonance imaging may now provide an extremely sensitive way to detect and monitor laser-tissue effects, and allow efficient interstitial laser phototherapy of deep and sometimes inaccessible tumors. The current and future prospectives of the emerging field of laser phototherapy are described. 
Cardiomyopathy of the aging human heart. Myocyte loss and reactive cellular hypertrophy. To determine the effects of aging on the human myocardium, 67 hearts were obtained from individuals who died from causes other than cardiovascular disease. The age interval examined was 17-90 years. Regression analysis demonstrated that the aging process was characterized by a loss of 38 million and 14 million myocyte nuclei/yr in the left and right ventricular myocardium, respectively. This loss in muscle mass was accompanied by a progressive increase in myocyte cell volume per nucleus in both ventricles. Left ventricular myocytes enlarged by 110 microns3/yr, whereas right ventricular myocytes increased by 118 microns3/yr, resulting in a preservation of ventricular wall thickness. However, the cellular hypertrophic response was unable to maintain normal cardiac mass. Left and right ventricular weights decreased by 0.70 and 0.21 g/yr, respectively. In conclusion, loss of cells and enlargement of the remaining myocytes may represent the structural basis for the reduced compensatory capacity of the aged heart and together may contribute to the development of myocardial dysfunction and failure in the elderly. 
Age-related changes in the clinical and electrophysiologic characteristics of patients with Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome: comparative study between young and elderly patients. The natural history of patients with Wolff-Parkinson-White (WPW) syndrome remains an intriguing question with respect to clinical decision-making, since serial electrophysiologic data spread over several decades in the same patient are not available in the literature. To study the age-related changes in WPW syndrome, we compared two separate groups of patients referred to this Medical Center for electrophysiologic studies because of a clinical presentation with significant arrhythmias. An elderly group of 42 patients aged 50 years or more were compared with a younger group of 51 patients aged 15 to 30 years. The groups were comparable in terms of clinical presentation, including the number of patients who had reported syncopal episodes and those requiring cardioversion of their tachyarrhythmias. Baseline electrophysiologic variables such as sinus rate; sinoatrial conduction time; corrected sinus node recovery time; AH interval; and effective refractory periods of the right atrium, atrioventricular (AV) node, and right ventricular muscle, were significantly greater in the elderly group. Similarly, the anterograde effective refractory period of the bypass tract, the shortest atrial pacing cycle length with 1:1 anterograde conduction via the bypass tract, retrograde effective refractory period of the bypass tract, the shortest ventricular pacing cycle length with 1:1 retrograde conduction via the bypass tract, the shortest consecutive preexcited R-R interval during atrial fibrillation, and the cycle length of orthodromic atrial ventricular reciprocating tachycardia were significantly greater in the elderly group. 
Focal nodular hyperplasia of the liver: MR findings in 35 proved cases. MR images of 28 patients with 35 lesions of hepatic focal nodular hyperplasia were reviewed to determine the frequency of findings considered typical of this condition (isointensity on T1- and T2-weighted pulse sequences, a central hyperintense scar on T2-weighted images, and homogeneous signal intensity). Fifteen lesions were imaged at 0.6 T with T1- and T2-weighted spin-echo (SE) pulse sequences; 20 lesions were imaged at 1.5 T with T1-weighted SE and gradient-echo pulse sequences and T2-weighted SE pulse sequences. Diagnosis of focal nodular hyperplasia was made pathologically in 25 patients, with nuclear scintigraphy in four, and with follow-up imaging in six. Only seven lesions (20%) were isointense relative to normal liver on both T1- and T2-weighted images. On T1-weighted SE images, 21 lesions (60%) were isointense relative to normal liver, 12 (34%) were hypointense, and two (6%) were hyperintense. On T2-weighted SE images, 12 lesions (34%) were isointense and 23 (66%) were hyperintense relative to normal liver. A central scar was present in 17 lesions (49%) and was hypointense relative to the lesion on T1-weighted images and hyperintense on T2-weighted images. Twenty lesions (57%) were of homogeneous signal intensity throughout the lesion, except for the presence of a central scar. All three MR imaging characteristics were present in three cases (9%). We conclude that hepatic focal nodular hyperplasia has a wide range of signal intensity on MR imaging. 
Mixed venous oxygen saturation for differentiating stable from unstable tachycardias. Current antitachycardia systems are incapable of adequately distinguishing stable from unstable tachycardias. Previously, integration of a pressure sensor or an impedance sensor, together with electrogram analysis, has been investigated as an improved method of identifying unstable arrhythmias. A mixed venous oxygen saturation sensor was investigated for differentiating stable from unstable paced and induced tachycardias in 10 patients. During rapid pacing at 600, 500, 400, 350, 300, and 250 msec cycle lengths, mixed venous oxygen saturation decreased as cycle length decreased. For any given cycle length, rapid ventricular pacing tended to result in greater mixed venous oxygen desaturation compared with atrial pacing. Mixed venous oxygen saturation decreased similarly during induced ventricular tachycardias at cycle lengths greater than 230 msec. However, ventricular tachycardias at cycle lengths less than or equal to 230 msec and ventricular fibrillation had no effect on mixed venous oxygen saturation until after termination. Subsequently, a mixed venous oxygen saturation-tiered therapy algorithm (cycle length less than or equal to 230 msec = unstable; cycle length greater than 230 msec and MVO2 greater than or equal to 6% over 30 seconds = unstable) was developed and was tested retrospectively in 113 paced and induced tachyarrhythmias in these 10 patients for detecting unstable tachycardias (defined as a decrease from baseline systolic arterial pressure of greater than or equal to 50 mm Hg at 15 seconds). The mixed venous oxygen algorithm had 93% sensitivity and 96% specificity compared with rate-only (rate greater than or equal to 170 beats/min) detection with 93% sensitivity and 71% specificity. 
Recombinant human granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor after chemotherapy in patients with acute myeloid leukemia at higher age or after relapse. To reduce critical neutropenia after chemotherapy (CT) for acute myeloid leukemia (AML) we administered recombinant human granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) to patients over the age of 65 years with newly diagnosed AML and to patients with early or second relapse. CT was 9-day 6-thioguanine, ara-C, and daunorubicin (TAD9) in newly diagnosed AML and sequential high-dose ara-C and mitoxantrone (S-HAM) for relapse. In patients whose bone marrow was free from blasts a continuous intravenous infusion of GM-CSF 250 micrograms/m2/d started on day 4 after CT. Thirty-six patients entered the study and 30 of them did receive GM-CSF. For comparison, a historical control group of 56 patients was used. Complete remission rate was 50% (18 of 36) versus 32% in controls (P = .09), and early death rate was 14% versus 39% (P = .009). Treatment with GM-CSF was not associated with major adverse events. Two patients showed a marked leukemic regrowth that was completely reversible in one patient and appeared to be GM-CSF independent in the other patient. Remission duration does not seem to be reduced after GM-CSF. Under GM-CSF the blood neutrophils recovered 6 and 9 days earlier in the TAD9 (P = .009) and S-HAM (P = .043) groups associated with a rapid clearance of infections in most patients. We conclude that GM-CSF was of therapeutic benefit to our patients and this provides a basis for larger controlled trials. 
HTLV-I-associated myelopathy in a patient with adult T-cell leukemia. Disseminated erythematous papules and plaques developed in a 60-year-old man 3 years before the appearance of neurologic manifestations. A biopsy specimen of the plaque revealed Pautrier's microabscess and a dense mononuclear cell infiltration with atypical convoluted nuclei in the papillary dermis. These cells were helper/inducer T lymphocytes that expressed the interleukin 2 receptor. The patient's white blood cell count was normal, but 1% atypical lymphocytes and a high titer of anti-human T-lymphotropic virus (HTLV)-I antibody were detected in his serum. A smoldering type of adult T-cell leukemia was diagnosed. While he was being treated with PUVA, a gait disturbance developed. A high titer of anti-HTLV-I antibody, characteristic of HTLV-I-associated myelopathy, was demonstrated in his cerebrospinal fluid. 
Venous thrombosis after long-term transvenous pacing in the Chinese. To determine the incidence of venous thrombosis after long-term transvenous pacing in the Chinese, venograms were performed in 50 consecutive Chinese patients seen at the pacemaker clinic. There were 25 women and 25 men. The mean age was sixty-six years (range thirty-two to eighty-one). The indications for pacing were complete heart block in 16 patients and sick sinus syndrome in the remainder. All pacemakers were of the single-chamber ventricular pacing type and had been implanted for a mean period of four years (range two to seven). In 27 patients the route of entry for the pacing electrode was through the cephalic vein and in the other 23 patients the subclavian veins were used. Of the 50 venograms, 1 showed partial and 1 showed total obstruction at the subclavian vein. Both patients (4%) were asymptomatic. All others (96%) were normal. The incidence of venous thrombosis was not related to the routes of entry of the pacing electrodes. All patients tolerated the procedure well and had no complications. It is concluded that the incidence of venous thrombosis after long-term transvenous pacing is extremely low in the Chinese (4%), and venograms are both safe and useful for identifying venous thrombosis related to transvenous pacing. 
The 10-y incidence of obesity and major weight gain in black and white US women aged 30-55 y. Although the prevalence of obesity in US women is well-described, data are limited on the incidence of major weight gain and obesity. We used data from the First National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey Epidemiologic Follow-up Study to estimate the 10-y incidence of major weight gain (greater than or equal to 10 kg) and obesity [body mass index (BMI, in kg/m2) greater than or equal to 29] in a cohort of US women aged 30-55 y (n = 535 blacks and 2976 whites). In women not obese at baseline, blacks were 60% more likely to become obese than whites [incidence in blacks = 15.5%, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 11.2-19.7; incidence in whites = 9.7%, 95% CI = 8.6-10.8]. This higher incidence of obesity in blacks was largely due to their higher average BMI at baseline. The incidence of major weight gain was 50% higher in blacks than in whites (in blacks, 17.3%; 95% CI = 13.6-21.0; in whites, 11.7%; 95% CI = 10.3-13.1). We estimate that in black and white women, respectively, 16% and 12% of coronary heart disease is attributed to major weight gain whereas 35% and 21% is attributed to being obese. 
Development of the pulmonary vasculature in newborn lambs: structure-function relationships. Our objectives were 1) to describe the quantitative light microscopy and ultrastructure of newborn lamb lungs and 2) to correlate hemodynamic changes during normoxia and hypoxia with the morphology. By light microscopy, we measured the percent muscle thickness (%MT) and peripheral muscularization of pulmonary arteries and veins from 25 lambs aged less than 24 h, 2-4 days, 2 wk, and 1 mo. At the same ages, lungs were isolated and perfused in situ and, after cyclooxygenase blockade with indomethacin, total, arterial (delta Pa), middle (delta Pm), and venous pressure gradients at inspired O2 fractions of 0.28 (mild hyperoxia) and 0.04 (hypoxia) were determined with inflow-outflow occlusion. During mild hyperoxia, delta Pa and delta Pm fell significantly between 2-4 days and 2 wk, whereas during hypoxia, only delta Pm fell. The %MT of all arteries (less than 50 to greater than 1,000 microns diam) decreased, and peripheral muscularization of less than 100-microns-diam arteries fell between less than 4 days and greater than 2 wk. Our data suggest that 1) the %MT of arteries determines normoxic pulmonary vascular resistance, because only arterial and middle segment resistance fell, 2) peripheral muscularization is a major determinant of hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction, because we observed a fall with age in peripheral muscularization of less than 100-micron-diam arteries and in delta Pm with hypoxia, and 3) the arterial limit of the middle segment defined by inflow-outflow occlusion lies in 100- to 1,000-microns-diam arteries. 
IgA antigliadin antibodies, cellobiose/mannitol sugar test, and carotenemia in the diagnosis of and screening for celiac disease. Serum IgA antigliadin antibodies (IgAAGA) assay, cellobiose/mannitol sugar permeability test (ST), and carotenemia were evaluated prospectively as diagnostic tests in 60 consecutive adult patients with suspected celiac disease (CD). CD was confirmed histologically in 26 patients. IgAAGA, ST, and carotenemia had a sensitivity of 65.4%, 96.2%, and 76.9%, a specificity of 97.1%, 73.5%, and 70.6%, and positive likelihood ratio of 22.2, 3.6, and 2.6, respectively. Multivariate logistic regression showed that IgAAGA and ST had a sensitivity and specificity of 96.2% and 70.6% and a positive likelihood ratio of 47.3 if both were positive. Assuming a prevalence of CD of 1:2000 in the general population, for every 89 positive IgAAGA and 549 altered ST there would be one celiac patient, whereas, if both tests were positive, the patient was certain to have CD. We conclude that, of the tests studied, IgAAGA and ST are respectively the most specific and the most sensitive and that, used together, they can diagnose CD. 
Conjunctival cysts in anophthalmic orbits. Five out of 149 patients (3%) who received an intraorbital implant to prevent or treat the disfiguring symptoms associated with the postenucleation socket syndrome developed intraorbital conjunctival cysts. All five patients had received a secondary implant two 14 months previously. After excision of the cysts four patients required additional surgery for lack of conjunctiva and/or recurrent cyst formation. The clinical findings, mechanism of development, and management of this rare but serious complication of socket surgery are described. 
GM1-gangliosidosis (genetic beta-galactosidase deficiency): identification of four mutations in different clinical phenotypes among Japanese patients. GM1-gangliosidosis is a genetic neurological disorder caused by mutations in the lysosomal acid beta-galactosidase gene. While its phenotypic expression is complex, it is usually classified as being of infantile, juvenile, or adult form, on the basis of age at onset, the rate of symptomatic progression, and severity of central nervous system involvement. We have analyzed the acid beta-galactosidase gene in 12 Japanese patients from nine families. The aim was to identify mutations in individual patients and then to examine possible correlation between the mutations and the clinical phenotypes. Northern blotting studies with a full-length human beta-galactosidase cDNA showed that the mRNA ranged from undetectable to substantially decreased in the infantile patients but was normal in quantity and size in all juvenile and adult patients. Four distinct missense mutations have been identified, each limited to the respective clinical forms within our small-size samples. In the infantile patient with decreased but detectable mRNA, a point mutation was found resulting in Arg49----Cys. In the infantile patient with nearly undetectable mRNA, mutation Arg457----Ter was identified. The mutation Arg201----Cys was found in all four of the juvenile patients, while all six adult patients were homozygous for the point mutation Ile51----Thr. The mutations found in the juvenile and adult patients alter restriction sites in the normal gene and thus are amendable to quick screening. The prediction that these mutations are responsible for the clinical disease was confirmed by no expression of the catalytic activity of the mutant proteins in the COS-I cell expression system. 
Biocompatibility of radiolucent breast implants. Current implants for breast augmentation containing silicone gel, saline, or both are radiopaque on mammographic examination and can totally obscure microcalcifications and soft-tissue masses. The effect of these implants on the detection of early breast cancers in patients who have undergone augmentation mammaplasty remains unproven and controversial. Implants filled with medium-chain triglycerides (peanut oil) are radiolucent on mammographic examination and allow visualization of both soft-tissue masses and microcalcifications. To investigate the biocompatibility of radiolucent implants, 10 cc of sterile, nonpyrogenic peanut oil was injected subcutaneously into rats using silicone gel as a control. Twenty-one rabbits had two 125-cc silicone shell implants inserted on either side of the chest wall. The right-sided shell was filled with 125 cc of sterile saline, and the left-sided shell was filled with 125 cc of sterile, nonpyrogenic peanut oil. Results were determined by both histologic and radiographic examination. Rats injected with peanut oil equivalent to 7 percent of their body weight rapidly absorbed the freely injected oil without detriment. Histologic examination of the lungs, liver, kidneys, and tissues adjacent to the injection sites demonstrated no abnormalities. There was no evidence of allergic, toxic, inflammatory, or neoplastic response. Eighteen of 21 rabbits survived more than 3 months. Radiographs showed the oil-filled implants to be radiolucent, whereas the saline-filled controls obscured the surrounding soft and bony tissues. Histologic examination demonstrated a fibrous capsule surrounding both types of implants. Histologic examination of the lungs, liver, and kidneys showed no significant abnormalities. These and previous studies have shown peanut oil to be biocompatible when freely injected either intramuscularly or subcutaneously. This study demonstrates that a radiolucent, peanut oil-filled implant is biocompatible in animals and that further long-term studies for its use in humans are merited. 
Metabolic and destructive brain disorders in children: findings with localized proton MR spectroscopy. The diagnostic potential of volume-selective proton magnetic resonance (MR) spectroscopy in vivo was evaluated in 20 children and young adults with various neurodegenerative brain disorders. All patients were examined with MR spectroscopy in conjunction with MR imaging of the brain on a whole-body imager at 1.5 T. Comparison of spectra in our patients with those of children with normal myelination (prominent signals from N-acetylaspartate [NAA], creatine/phosphocreatine, and choline) revealed a marked decrease of NAA in 12 of 17 patients with focal or generalized demyelination. In patients with Canavan disease, NAA signal intensity was markedly increased, but no choline signal was found. Increased signal intensity from lactate occurred in patients with Leigh disease, neuroaxonal dystrophy, Schilder disease, and Cockayne disease, which indicated a disturbed energy metabolism in the examined region. These results demonstrate that proton MR spectroscopy can be applied in a clinical environment to facilitate diagnosis of hereditary and acquired brain disorders in children. 
Longitudinal followup of patients with Meniere's disease. The etiology, pathophysiology, and natural history of Meniere's syndrome are poorly understood. The reported studies have had inadequate followup or insufficient numbers of patients to allow conclusions about the natural history. Our study group was 119 patients who had the classic symptom complex of episodic vertigo, tinnitus, and hearing loss in the year 1970. After initial review of these charts, follow-up information was obtained by questionnaire, telephone interview, chart review, or repeat examination, when possible, both in 1983 and in 1988, for a total followup of 18 years. In the patients with followups of at least 14 years, vertiginous episodes had disappeared completely in 50% of patients and somewhat resolved in 28%; hearing was absent in 48% and worse in 21%. Surprisingly, 43% of patients underwent surgery at some point for control of vertigo. Bilateral disease was present initially in 13% and developed subsequently in 45% of patients. Other areas reviewed included the efficacy of long-term medical treatment, frequency and severity of vertiginous attacks, and contralateral ear symptoms. 
Increased intestinal permeability in endotoxic pigs. Mesenteric hypoperfusion as an etiologic factor. Infusing pigs with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) decreases superior mesenteric artery blood flow (Qsma), suggesting that mesenteric hypoperfusion may be responsible for LPS-induced alterations in gut mucosal permeability. To test this hypothesis, we studied four groups of anesthetized swine. Group 1 animals (N = 6) were infused with LPS (250 micrograms/kg over 1 hour beginning at 60 minutes) and continuously resuscitated with Ringer's lactate (48 mL/kg per hour). In group 2 (N = 5), Qsma was decreased by 50% by means of a mechanical occluder to mimic the LPS-induced alterations in Qsma observed in group I. Group 3 (N = 5) was included to document our ability to detect ischemia/reperfusion-induced alterations in mucosal permeability; in these pigs, Qsma was decreased in steps to zero flow (at 150 to 210 minutes) and then perfusion was restored (at 210 to 270 minutes). Pigs in group 4 (N = 6) served as normal controls; these animals were resuscitated with Ringer's lactate at the same rate as in group 1 but were not infused with LPS. To assess mucosal permeability, we measured plasma-to-lumen clearances for two markers, chromium 51-labeled edetic acid monohydrate (EDTA) and urea. Loading and maintenance infusions of the markers were given intravenously, and a 20-cm isolated segment of small intestine was continuously perfused at 2 mL/min with Ringer's lactate at 37 degrees C. Results were expressed as the ratio of the clearances for the two probes (CEDTA/CUREA). In group 3, CEDTA/CUREA was 999% +/- 355% of baseline at 270 minutes. In group 1, CEDTA/CUREA was 572% +/- 235% of baseline at 270 minutes. In groups 2 and 4, however, CEDTA/CUREA did not change significantly from the baseline value over the duration of the study. These data suggest that increased mucosal permeability after LPS is due to factors other than (or in addition to) mesenteric hypoperfusion. 
Characteristics of patients resistant to antihypertensive drug therapy. In order to determine the features that characterize refractory hypertension (RH), patients aged less than 65 years in a hypertension clinic were screened. Thirty-six patients on triple drug therapy with a supine diastolic blood pressure (DBP) of greater than or equal to 5 mmHg above an identified target pressure (90-100 mmHg), or a systolic blood pressure (SBP) greater than or equal to 170 mmHg for the last 6 months (greater than or equal to 3 measurements) underwent a thorough clinical investigation. The frequency of renal artery stenosis (RAS) in the RH patients was 30%. The non-RAS patients had a low occupational status, 76% being either manual workers or unskilled non-manual workers (reference group: 42%; P less than 0.01). They were more obese (body mass index (BMI) 28.8 vs. 25.8; P less than 0.01), and had a longer duration of hypertensive disease. RH patients had a higher prevalence of non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (18 vs. 6%; P less than 0.05), and showed a higher prevalence of nervous complaints and mental distress (44% vs. 12%; P less than 0.001) and musculo-skeletal pain (39% vs. 7%: P less than 0.001). It is suggested that refractory hypertension should be investigated and treated bearing psychosocial factors in mind, concurrently with a screening for secondary hypertension. 
Transcanal infracochlear approach to the petrous apex. Computerized tomography and magnetic resonance imaging have now made it possible to reliably differentiate cholesteatoma from cholesterol granuloma of the petrous apex. The treatment for cholesteatoma is complete surgical excision when possible, whereas cholesterol granuloma needs only adequate drainage for control. A new transcanal infracochlear approach for drainage of cholesterol granuloma involving the anterior petrous apex is described. Absolute measurements from 10 cadaveric temporal bones were obtained to determine the distances between the cochlea, jugular bulb, carotid artery, and facial nerve. In all specimens the petrous apex was entered without invading the cochlea, carotid, or jugular bulb. Advantages of this technique include a more direct route to the petrous apex, dependent drainage, and preservation of the normal hearing mechanism, including the tympanic membrane. Clinical indications for this technique include failure of other treatment approaches and a high jugular bulb obstructing an infralabyrinthine approach. Experience to date shows that patients experience little difficulty from the procedure. 
Insulin pulses less effective than continuous insulin in inhibiting PEPCK mRNA levels stimulated by cAMP and dexamethasone in perifused hepatoma cells. Hepatic glucose production is stimulated in vitro twice as effectively by pulsatile as by continuous glucagon, given equivalent time-averaged doses. Efficacy studies of pulsatile insulin have yielded conflicting results. In the rat hepatoma cell line H-4-II-E-C3, insulin rapidly (t1/2 15 min) inhibits transcription of the gene and lowers mRNA levels for the gluconeogenic enzyme. PEPCK via a receptor-mediated process. We attached H-4-II-E-C3 cells to Cytodex-3 microcarriers and used a perifusion column system to test whether pulsatile insulin is more or less effective than equivalent time-averaged doses of continuous insulin. PEPCK transcription was induced by inclusion of cAMP analogue 8-(4-chlorophenyl-thio)-cAMP (0.1 mM) and dexamethasone (0.5 microM) in the perifusion medium. Three columns were exposed either to continuous, pulsatile, or no insulin. After 3 h, total nucleic acid was extracted, and mRNA(PEPCK) was measured with a sensitive-solution hybridization assay. Continuous insulin inhibited PEPCK expression in a dose-dependent fashion with EC50 1 x 10(-11) M. Equivalent time-averaged amounts of insulin delivered as pulses achieved significant inhibition but less effectively than continuous insulin. The apparent EC50 for pulsatile insulin increased from 2 x 10(-11) M to 5 x 10(-11) M as the oscillatory period was raised from 5 to 20 min, respectively. These observations suggest that insulin-mediated inhibition of PEPCK gene transcription is diminished by a pulsatile mode of administration in marked contrast to the pulse enhancement demonstrated for glucagon-mediated hepatic glucose production. 
The clinical utility of prostate-specific antigen and bone scintigraphy in prostate cancer follow-up. To assess the value of serum prostate-specific antigen (PSA) in prostate cancer follow-up, we prospectively studied 107 consecutive patients with: (1) pathologically confirmed prostate cancer; (2) definitive prostatectomy and/or radiation therapy greater than or equal to 3 mo prior to bone scanning; and (3) one bone scan and serum PSA sampling within 3 mo of each other. The mean and range of patient follow-up since definitive therapy was 1.6 and 0.5-8 yr, respectively. Abnormal bone scans were correlated with pertinent radiographs. Of 107 bone scans, 16 demonstrated metastatic bone disease. A PSA value of less than or equal to 8 ng/ml excluded bone metastases with a predictive value of a negative test of 98.5%. Without radiographic correlation, abnormal bone scans rarely represented metastases if the PSA value was less than or equal to 8 ng/ml. In summary, serum PSA concentration determines the need for follow-up bone scanning and assists in scan interpretation in patients status post definitive therapy for prostate cancer. 
Inflammatory edema induced by interactions between IL-1 and the neuropeptide calcitonin gene-related peptide. The neuropeptide calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) is a potent vasodilator with a long duration of action. CGRP is widely distributed and is present in perivascular nerves of tissues that include skin and the synovium. In this study we have investigated the possibility that CGRP can modulate the inflammatory actions of the cytokine IL-1 by using an inflammatory model in rabbit skin. The intradermal injection of IL-1 (1.4 x 10(-14) mol/site) alone stimulated little edema formation. However, when IL-1 was injected with CGRP (10(-11) mol/site), a highly significant edema was observed, and neutrophil accumulation induced by IL-1 was potentiated. These results suggest that the action of IL-1 as a potent mediator of increased microvascular permeability is only observed when skin blood flow is increased in this model. This was confirmed by experiments in which PGE2 (3 x 10(-9) mol/site) at a dose with a similar duration of vasodilator action as CGRP (10(-11) mol/site) also potentiated edema induced by IL-1. Further experiments investigated the mechanism by which IL-1 increased microvascular permeability. Edema induced by IL-1 was dependent on de novo protein synthesis and the presence of circulating neutrophils. However, selective platelet-activating factor and histamine H1 antagonists had no inhibitory effect on this response. Thus it appears that when a microvascular bed is dilated by the long-lasting vasodilator CGRP, edema induced by IL-1 is clearly observed. These results highlight a potentially important synergistic interaction between cytokines and neuropeptides in inflammation. 
Propranolol compared with propranolol plus isosorbide-5-mononitrate for portal hypertension in cirrhosis. A randomized controlled study. OBJECTIVE: To investigate whether isosorbide-5-mononitrate (Is-5-Mn) given with propranolol reduces hepatic portal pressure more than does propranolol alone in patients with cirrhosis. DESIGN: A randomized controlled trial. PATIENTS: Fifty patients with cirrhosis and esophageal varices entered and 42 completed the study. INTERVENTION: Twenty-one patients received oral propranolol at increasing doses until their resting heart rate was reduced by 25%, and 21 patients received oral propranolol (on the same schedule) plus oral Is-5-Mn, 40 mg twice a day. MEASUREMENTS: Hepatic vein pressure gradient, liver function, and splanchnic and systemic hemodynamics before and after 3 months of continuous therapy. MAIN RESULTS: At 3 months, the hepatic venous pressure gradient decreased more (P less than 0.01) in patients given propranolol plus Is-5-Mn (19%, from 18.4 +/- 3.9 to 14.9 +/- 3.8 mm Hg; 95% CI, -2.4 to -4.5 mm Hg) than in those given propranolol alone (10%, from 18.2 +/- 3.5 to 16.3 +/- 3.1 mm Hg; CI, -1.1 to -2.7 mm Hg). The hepatic venous pressure gradient decreased by more than 20% of the baseline value in 10% of patients receiving propranolol, but in 50% of patients receiving combined therapy (P less than 0.02). There were statistically significant decreases in hepatic blood flow and the intrinsic clearance of indocyanine green after propranolol therapy, but not after combined therapy. The treatments caused similar reductions in azygos blood flow and cardiac output. CONCLUSIONS: The long-term combined administration of propranolol plus Is-5-Mn reduces portal pressure more than propranolol alone without adverse effects on hepatic perfusion and liver function. Whether this greater hemodynamic effect translates into better clinical efficacy should be determined in randomized controlled trials. 
Assessment of competency: the role of neurobehavioral deficits. We present a practical set of guidelines for assessing competency in patients with cognitive deficits due to neurologic disorders such as stroke, head injury, Alzheimer disease, and multi-infarct dementia. Our focus is the evaluation of cognitive processes underlying the ability to make competent decisions, with an emphasis on the identification of areas of preserved function that may be used to bypass intellectual deficits. The assessment of the cognitive processes underlying competency involves a series of steps designed to evaluate attention, language, memory, and frontal lobe function. The examiner must first show that the patient has an adequate level of attention for participation in the further testing of specific cognitive functions; second, that the patient is able to comprehend relevant instructions, retain information long enough to evaluate it in relation to relevant recent and remote experiences, and express his or her wishes; and finally, that the patient has sufficiently intact judgment and awareness. The examiner must determine whether the patient's preserved cognitive abilities are sufficient for him or her to make an adequate judgment in relation to the specific question being asked. If cognitive function is found to be significantly impaired, the examiner should do a detailed assessment for the presence of compensatory abilities that can be used to bypass the deficits. For example, the examiner should assess whether patients who cannot speak are still able to express their wishes by pointing, using gesture, or even by drawing pictures. Unless such an assessment has been done, patients should not be considered incompetent. 
Entire ABL gene is joined with 5'-BCR in some patients with Philadelphia-positive leukemia. In four patients, the chromosome 9 breakpoint of the t(9; 22)(q34;q11) had occurred at different sites within an 8.25-kilobase (kb) region situated 5' of ABL exon 1B. Chromosome in situ hybridization and field inversion gel electrophoresis (FIGE) studies showed that ABL exons 1A and 1B were present on the Ph chromosome. Yet this large fusion gene produced an mRNA conventional for chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML). Splicing from BCR exon 3 to ABL exon 2 crossed more than 200 kb and deleted exons 1A and 1B. This breakpoint site may occur in about 10% of all CML patients. Three of our patients have pronounced thrombocytosis, and two had been diagnosed as having Ph-positive essential thrombocythemia. The platelet count of the other patient was not available. 
Value and limitations of secondary femoropopliteal bypasses with polytetrafluoroethylene. Secondary femoropopliteal bypasses with polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) grafts are widely regarded to be of questionable value. This has prompted some to abandon all attempts at secondary revascularization with PTFE and others to recommend that primary femoropopliteal bypasses be performed preferentially with PTFE grafts so that vein may be used for secondary procedures. Because we questioned both of these views, we reviewed all femoropopliteal bypasses done at our institution in the past 12 years and identified 73 secondary PTFE femoropopliteal procedures performed after a failed ipsilateral infrainguinal bypass (69 failed femoropopliteal; 4 failed femorodistal). Seventy (96%) secondary bypasses were performed for limb salvage and 3 (4%) for severe disabling claudication. Insertion of grafts to the popliteal artery was above the knee in 26 (36%) and below the knee in 47 (64%). Primary life-table graft patency at 4 years was only 38%. Forty-eight reinterventions in 34 limbs were required to restore or maintain graft patency in thrombosed or failing grafts. For thrombosed grafts, 20 interventions consisted of 9 simple thrombectomies and 11 thrombectomies with additional revision procedures (5 distal or proximal extensions, 6 patch angioplasties). Twenty-eight lesions threatening graft patency were treated by percutaneous transluminal angioplasty in 3, proximal or distal extensions in 20, and patch angioplasty in 5. As a result of these reinterventions, the overall secondary patency rate was 55% at 4 years, and the limb salvage rate was 74% at 4 years. Although aggressive follow-up and reintervention may be required, the use of secondary PTFE conduits in the femoropopliteal position is a viable option in patients undergoing limb salvage procedures who are at high risk. 
Responsiveness to phenobarbital in an adult with Crigler-Najjar disease associated with neurological involvement and skin hyperextensibility. We present the case of a 23-yr-old man who had had since birth marked and sustained unconjugated non-hemolytic hyperbilirubinemia and who had had several attacks of grand mal seizures. Analysis of serum bilirubin by diazoreactive methods showed serum levels of unconjugated bilirubin as high as 445 mumol/L that were not affected by phenobarbital administration. However, analysis of serum bile pigments by high-pressure liquid chromatography demonstrated marked decrease of unconjugated bilirubin after phenobarbital treatment (from 432.4 mumol/L to 291.0 mumol/L) associated with slight increase of bilirubin monoconjugates and disconjugates (from 0.25 mumol/L to 0.42 mumol/L). Furthermore, in the past few years the patient had exhibited striking skin hyperextensibility and diaphragm eventration. This case confirms that alkaline methanolysis-high-pressure liquid chromatography is the most reliable method for assessment of serum fraction bilirubin levels; that clinical parameters such as neurological signs do not unequivocally discriminate between type I and II Crigler-Najjar disease and that response to phenobarbital treatment remains the main diagnostic tool. 
Myocardial infarction in childhood: clinical analysis of 17 cases and medium term follow up of survivors. Between 1979 and 1989 17 patients aged two months to 12 years with acute myocardial infarction of any cause (other than after cardiac surgery) were seen at a children's hospital. Eight died from three days to three years after diagnosis (overall mortality 47%). The nine survivors, now aged 2-17 years, have been followed for one to 10 years (mean follow up five years) after infarction. The commonest causes of myocardial infarction in this series were anomalous origin of left coronary artery from the pulmonary artery (six patients (35%] and Kawasaki disease (five patients (27%]. The main symptoms of acute myocardial infarction were dyspnoea, vomiting, and difficulty feeding. Diagnosis was made in all patients by electrocardiography and confirmed by echocardiography, cardiac catheterisation, or at operation. All survivors were symptom free with excellent exercise capacity. The left ventricular ejection fraction in survivors ranged from 21% to 66%, and only one child was on regular cardiac medications. There were no cases of late sudden death. Twenty four hour Holter monitoring performed on survivors was normal (seven) or showed minor abnormalities only (one), suggesting that serious arrhythmia is rare after paediatric myocardial infarction. Myocardial infarction in children had a high early mortality; however, the incidence of serious arrhythmia was low in the survivors, who had a good exercise tolerance even when the left ventricular ejection fraction was low. 
Post stenotic aneurysm in popliteal artery entrapment syndrome. In a retrospective review of 74 cases of Popliteal Entrapment Syndrome collected over a 16 year period, 10 cases of aneurysm were found (13.5%). This represents an incidence of 26% of the 38 cases of popliteal aneurysm of any etiology seen during the same period of time. In contrast to atherosclerotic aneurysms, these aneurysms were seen in a young age group (21-30 years of age) and all were associated with popliteal entrapment. Evidence is presented to support our opinion that these aneurysms are post-stenotic in origin. We feel that young adults with symptoms of leg ischaemia and evidence of an aneurysm of the popliteal artery should be investigated for popliteal entrapment and treated before complications occur. We have found a posterior approach to be the most satisfactory method of exploring the popliteal fossa. 
Polyneuropathy induced by m-tolyl methyl carbamate intoxication. A 55-year-old woman who attempted suicide by ingesting 200 ml of m-tolyl methyl carbamate (MTMC) is reported. She was comatose for 3 days and, upon recovery, had notable paraesthesia in her lower limbs and difficulty in walking. Neurological examination revealed sensorimotor polyneuropathy. Sural nerve biopsy revealed marked axonal degeneration with a moderate decrease of myelinated fibres. 
Pseudoaneurysm of the popliteal artery as a complication of an osteochondroma. A review of the literature and a case report. False aneurysm of the femoral artery was associated with a solitary osteochondroma of the femur in a 22-year-old man. An extensive review of the literature and the problems related to diagnosis revealed that the aneurysm was apparently unique. Contrary to previous reports, computed tomography and angiography did not establish the diagnosis. The physical findings were more informative. 
Mammographic and CT findings after breast reconstruction with a rectus abdominis musculocutaneous flap. This essay illustrates the radiologic appearance of the reconstructed breast and the abdominal wall after breast reconstruction with a transverse rectus abdominis musculocutaneous (TRAM) flap. The findings are based on a retrospective study of 42 mammograms, 17 abdominal CT scans, and two CT scans each of the chest and pelvis of patients who underwent this procedure. 
Surgical management of severe aortic outflow obstruction in lesions other than the hypoplastic left heart syndrome: use of a pulmonary artery to aorta anastomosis. Between December 1985 and April 1990, 50 infants with a variety of congenital cardiac lesions other than the hypoplastic left heart syndrome underwent surgical relief of aortic outflow obstruction by creation of a pulmonary artery to aorta anastomosis. The patients were grouped anatomically by ventriculoarterial alignment. Nineteen had normally aligned great arteries (group I); 25 had transposition of the great arteries, all with a univentricular heart of left ventricular morphology (group II); and 6 had a double-outlet right ventricle (group III). All patients had either aortic stenosis with atresia, subaortic stenosis or a restrictive ventricular septal defect. Sixteen had normal arch anatomy; 34 had arch anomalies consisting of arch hypoplasia (n = 17), coarctation (n = 11), interruption of the arch (n = 4) and complex arch anomalies (n = 2). Surgery was performed at a median age of 10 days (range 2 to 184). Of the 50 infants, 33 survived. No significant difference in early survival (30 days) was noted among the groups of varying ventriculoarterial alignment (68% group I, 72% group II, 83% group III) (p greater than 0.05). Overall actuarial survival was 63% at 18 months. Analysis of actuarial survival by arch anatomy, although not statistically significant, revealed a trend toward better survival at 18 months postoperatively in infants with normal arch anatomy (81%) than in infants with arch anomalies (54%). Of the 33 survivors, 26 have proceeded to the next surgical stage, including the Fontan procedure in 8, superior cavopulmonary anastomosis in 13 and biventricular repair in 5. 
Complete infarction of the eye complicating a choroidal malignant melanoma. Infarction of malignant melanoma of the choroid has been previously reported, but infarction of the whole eye in association with infarction of melanoma is a rare event that has not been previously described. We present such a case and discuss the possible pathogenesis. 
Sudden death in infants sleeping on polystyrene-filled cushions. BACKGROUND. Infants are at risk for both the sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) and accidental suffocation. On postmortem examination, however, it is difficult to distinguish one from the other without information from the scene of death. Healthy infants are assumed to be able to turn their heads and, if not otherwise restrained, to obtain fresh air. We assessed this assumption in an investigation of infant deaths that occurred during sleep on cushions filled with polystyrene beads. METHODS. We obtained data on 25 deaths from the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission. We also used mechanical and animal models to study physiologic aspects of ventilation relevant to these results, by simulating the effects on an infant of breathing into a cushion. We measured the effects of softness, malleability (molding of the cushion about an infant's head), airflow resistance, and rebreathing of expired gases. RESULTS. All 25 study infants were prone when found dead, and at least 88 percent were face down with nose and mouth obstructed by the cushion. SIDS was the diagnosis in 19 of the 23 infants who underwent autopsy. Our findings show, however, that the cushion would have limited movement of the infant's head to obtain fresh air, and the amount of rebreathing we estimated to have occurred in the infants was lethal in a rabbit model. CONCLUSIONS. Accidental suffocation by rebreathing was the most likely cause of death in most of the 25 infants studied. Consequently, there is a need to reassess the cause of death in the 28 to 52 percent of the victims of SIDS who are found with their faces straight down. Safety regulations setting standards for softness, malleability, and the potential for rebreathing are needed for infant bedding. 
Complications of tissue plasminogen activator therapy after vitrectomy for diabetes. Human recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (25 micrograms) was injected into seven eyes of six patients who had developed massive fibrin deposition after vitrectomy surgery for diabetes. Six eyes had developed pupillary membranes and recurrence of tractional retinal detachment from fibrin membranes, and one eye had developed only a pupillary membrane. All pupillary membranes resolved within one hour of administration of tissue plasminogen activator, and five tractional retinal detachments resolved within 24 hours. All eyes developed evidence of intraocular bleeding after tissue plasminogen activator injection. Subsequently, six of seven eyes developed recurrence of fibrin accumulation and tractional retinal detachment. 
Diet and nutrition in ulcer disease. In this era of H2-inhibitors, the available evidence does not support the need to place peptic ulcer disease patients on restrictive diets. The major goal of diet is to avoid extreme elevations of gastric acid secretion and the direct irritation of gastric mucosa. In view of this, only slight modifications in the patient's usual diet are recommended. Table 1 depicts a sample menu for chronic peptic ulcer disease. Frequent milk ingestion as previously prescribed is not encouraged. This is owing to the transient buffering effect and significant gastric acid secretion effect of milk. The fat content of milk has no influence on these effects. Spices, in particular black pepper, red pepper, and chili powder, may produce dyspepsia. One study shows red chili powder to have no detrimental effect on duodenal ulcer healing. It has also been proposed that daily pepper ingestion may have a beneficial adaptive cytoprotective response. While still controversial and under evaluation, peptic ulcer patients should avoid any spice that causes discomfort, especially during exacerbation of peptic disease. Currently, studies indicate that it is prudent to avoid alcohol. This is especially true for the concentrated forms, such as 40% (80 proof) alcohol. Coffee should be avoided on the basis of its strong acid secretagogue property. Coffee can induce dyspepsia. Whether noncoffee caffeine-containing beverages (tea, soft drinks) induce peptic ulcer is unknown, but they are acid secretion stimulators. Decaffeinated coffee has an acid stimulating effect as well. It is reasonable to have peptic ulcer patients restrict decaffeinated coffee and all caffeine-containing beverages. There appears to be no evidence to restrict dietary fiber. Some fiber-containing foods may possess factors that are protective against ulcer disease. According to the Mayo Clinic Diet Manual, previously recommended small frequent feedings have not been shown to be more effective than three meals per day in the treatment of chronic peptic ulcer disease. This reference cites authorities advising against extra feedings because of increased acid secretion and unnecessary complication of eating patterns. However, some patients claim to be relieved of symptoms with more frequent feedings, especially during acute phases. Citric acid juices may induce reflux and cause discomfort in selective patients. Stomach distention with large quantities of food should be discouraged. Although there is now little role for dietary therapy, one should note that bland and ulcer diets probably are not detrimental to most persons if they are used for a short time and may have some psychological benefit.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS). 
Risk factors for gastrointestinal ulcers caused by nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) [published erratum appears in J Fam Pract 1991 Jul;33(1):16] Thirteen million individuals in the United States take nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) chronically for the relief of pain and inflammation caused by arthritis and related conditions. NSAIDs are valuable and in many cases essential to the management of arthritis pain. Long-term use of NSAIDs, however, can cause gastrointestinal (GI) ulcers and potentially life-threatening ulcer complications. Factors such as older age (greater than or equal to 60 years), a history of peptic ulcer disease, concomitant corticosterid use, cigarette smoking, alcohol use, and high dose or multiple NSAID therapy can increase the risk of GI damage and complications in the chronic NSAID user. Physician awareness of these risk factors is crucial so that the benefits and hazards of NSAID therapy in high-risk patients can be properly weighed. When the decision is made to prescribe NSAIDs, despite the presence of risk factors for NSAID-induced ulcers, patients should be closely monitored, and, in some cases, effective prophylaxis should be initiated. This is especially important since NSAID-induced gastrointestinal ulcers can be asymptomatic, causing serious ulcer complications without warning. 
Nesidioblastosis: evidence for autosomal recessive inheritance. The risk of recurrence of nesidioblastosis is unclear. Thirty patients from 28 families were studied; the marriages were consanguineous in five families. The ratio of subsequent affected to unaffected siblings was similar to that of an autosomal recessive condition and the sex ratio was close to 1. 
Isolated serum-free perfused rat kidneys release immunoreactive erythropoietin in response to hypoxia. The renal glycoprotein hormone erythropoietin (Epo) interacts with erythrocytic progenitors to stimulate their proliferation and differentiation in the bone marrow. The renal O2-sensing mechanism in the control of the synthesis of Epo is still poorly understood. Therefore, the capacity of isolated rat kidneys to produce Epo during hypoxic and anemic perfusion was studied. The kidneys were perfused at a constant perfusion pressure of 100 mm Hg with a substrate-enriched Krebs-Henseleit solution containing 60 g/liter BSA and freshly drawn human erythrocytes. Epo was measured by RIA. When the kidneys were perfused at an arterial pO2 of 720 or 150 mm Hg (hematocrit, 5%), Epo production was very low (0.1-0.2 U/g kidney within 3 h of perfusion). When the arterial pO2 was lowered to 35 or 20 mm Hg, Epo production increased to 0.4 and 0.9 U/g kidney, respectively. The release of Epo during hypoxic perfusion (pO2 35 and 20 mm Hg) was little affected by changes in the hematocrit, i.e. the O2-carrying capacity of the perfusion medium over a wide range (0-40%). These results indicate that the production of Epo in the isolated perfused kidney depends on the availability of O2 and can be modulated by changes in the arterial pO2. 
Flexible sigmoidoscopy may be ineffective for secondary prevention of colorectal cancer in asymptomatic, average-risk men. Asymptomatic men (N = 114) 50 years of age or older had screening for colorectal neoplasia with flexible sigmoidoscopy followed by colonoscopy regardless of the sigmoidoscopic result. Our study objective was to determine the prevalence of patients having isolated adenomatous polyps in a proximal colonic segment in the absence of a distal index neoplasm within reach of the sigmoidoscope. Through the combined use of sigmoidoscopy and colonoscopy, adenomatous polyps were detected in 47 of 114 individuals (41%). A total of 88 adenomas was found. Seventeen patients had isolated neoplasms in proximal colonic segments in the absence of distal adenomas. These patients represented 15% of screened subjects (17 of 114) and 20% of individuals who lacked adenomas on sigmoidoscopy (17 of 84). The majority of proximal neoplasms were small (less than 1.0 cm), tubular adenomas. Flexible sigmoidoscopy may be ineffective for screening asymptomatic men for neoplasia. However, it remains to be determined if a 20% miss rate (for those with a normal sigmoidoscopic examination) is significant and whether small proximal adenomas are worth finding. 
Temporal thresholds for neocortical infarction in rats subjected to reversible focal cerebral ischemia. We investigated the temporal threshold for focal cerebral infarction in the spontaneously hypertensive rat. The right middle cerebral artery and common carotid artery were occluded for 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, or 24 hours, and all the animals were sacrificed 24 hours after the onset of ischemia. Cortical infarct volumes and edema volumes were quantified in serial frozen sections of hematoxylin and eosin-stained tissue using image analysis. Upon occlusion, blood flow in the core of the ischemic zone, measured with laser-Doppler flowmetry, fell to a mean +/- standard deviation of 21 +/- 7% of the preocclusion baseline value (n = 26). During the first hour of ischemia, blood flow in the densely ischemic zone rose to 27 +/- 8% of baseline (n = 25). Release of the middle cerebral artery and common carotid artery occlusions rapidly restored cortical blood flow to 213 +/- 83% of baseline (n = 21). Focal ischemia of 1 hour's duration caused little or no infarction, while ischemic intervals of 2 and 3 hours produced successively larger volumes of infarcted cortex. Ischemic intervals of 3-4 hours' duration followed by approximately 20 hours of recirculation yielded infarct volumes that were not significantly different from those after 24 hours of permanent focal ischemia. The results indicate that 3-4 hours of focal cerebral ischemia in this rat model is sufficient to attain maximal infarction and suggest that recirculation or pharmacological interventions after this time will provide little benefit. 
Air esophagogram and intestinal pseudoocclusion in a patient with scleroderma. Air in the esophagus is unusual because it is collapsible. Its finding on a chest roentgenogram, particularly when not associated with a fluid level indicative of stricture, should strongly suggest systemic sclerosis (scleroderma). We describe a patient with scleroderma with intestinal pseudoocclusion and an air esophagogram. Study of chest roentgenograms of 83 patients with scleroderma, including those of 7 with pseudoocclusion, revealed no other instance of air esophagogram. This radiological sign, although rare, should suggest scleroderma and may be particularly useful in patients with "systemic sclerosis sine scleroderma.". 
Local anesthesia blocks the antiemetic action of P6 acupuncture. The incidence of postoperative illness was monitored for 6 hours in 74 women premedicated with nalbuphine, 10 mg, and undergoing short gynecologic operations of similar duration under methohexitalnitrous oxide-oxygen anesthesia. Each patient received P6 acupuncture for 5 minutes at the time of administration of premedication. In random order the site of the acupuncture had been previously infiltrated with normal saline solution in half of the patients and 1% lidocaine in the remaining patients. Postoperative emetic sequelae occurred significantly more often in those who received lidocaine compared with the group that received saline solution. This demonstrates the ability of a local anesthetic administered at the point of stimulation to block the antiemetic action of P6 acupuncture in a manner similar to that shown by others for analgesia. 
Immunolocalization of the Bcl-2 protein within hematopoietic neoplasms. The Bcl-2 proto-oncogene was discovered at the t(14;18) breakpoint found in most follicular B-cell lymphomas and some diffuse large-cell lymphomas. Bcl-2 is unique among proto-oncogenes, being localized to mitochondria and extending cell survival by blocking programmed cell death. We examined Bcl-2 protein expression in 82 hematologic malignancies and reactive lymphoid processes. All lymphomas with Bcl-2 rearrangement demonstrated high levels of Bcl-2 protein. However, most follicular and diffuse lymphomas without Bcl-2 rearrangement also displayed intense Bcl-2 staining. In these cases, mechanisms other than classic translocation may be deregulation Bcl-2. The pattern of Bcl-2 staining in follicular lymphoma is the inverse of the pattern in reactive hyperplasia, confirming a role for Bcl-2 immunolocalization in routine diagnosis. Small lymphocytic malignancies, including small lymphocytic lymphoma, mantle zone lymphoma, and chronic lymphocytic leukemia, expressed intermediate levels of Bcl-2. Bcl-2 protein varied in plasma cell dyscrasias. Bcl-2 protein levels in T-cell lymphomas reflected their corresponding stage of development. No substantial Bcl-2 was present in the Reed-Sternberg cells of nodular sclerosing Hodgkin's disease. Chronic myelogenous leukemia was strongly positive for Bcl-2, consistent with the presence of Bcl-2 in normal myeloid progenitors. Immunohistochemistry identified an expanded spectrum of hematopoietic neoplasms in which Bcl-2 may provide a cell survival advantage. 
Intestinal lymphonodular hyperplasia of childhood: patterns of presentation. In this retrospective analysis we searched for a constellation of signs or symptoms attributable to childhood lymphonodular hyperplasia (LNH). Of 147 children with documented LNH reviewed, 43% had lesions in the small bowel, and 57% in the large bowel. Children in this study presented with complaints of abdominal pain (58%) and bright red blood per rectum (32%). Physical examination revealed little except right lower quadrant (RLQ) abdominal tenderness and "fullness" in 35%. The pain was periumbilical, dull-cramping, rarely acute, and nonradiating. The hematochezia was most commonly streaky red in mucoid strands adhering to the stools, with no associated tenesmus. Three clinical patterns emerged: (a) Under 1 year of age most patients were male, with painless bleeding and pancolonic LNH. (b) Between 2 and 6 years, although the LNH was predominantly colonic, pain and bleeding occurred equally. (c) From 7 years old on, the main symptom was abdominal pain, but LNH distribution was nearly equal between the small bowel and the colon. To date, our long-term follow-up of the children with isolated LNH has revealed no sequelae. 
Gastric carcinoids and their precursor lesions. A histologic and immunohistochemical study of 23 cases. A histologic and immunohistochemical study was carried out in 23 unselected nonantral gastric carcinoids and their precursor lesions classified according to Solcia et al. None of the patients showed Zollinger-Ellison syndrome. Two variants of carcinoids showing distinctive pathologic and pathogenetic characteristics were identified on the basis of presence or absence of associated chronic atrophic gastritis type A (A-CAG). Chronic atrophic gastritis type A was found in 19 cases showing either single or multiple neoplasms, tumor extension limited to the mucosa or submucosa, consistent endocrine cell precursor changes in extratumoral mucosa, and consistent hypergastrinemia and/or G cell hyperplasia. Associated precursor lesions were only hyperplastic in all but two cases with single carcinoids whereas they were also dysplastic in all but one case with multiple carcinoids. The four tumors arising in nonatrophic mucosa were all single, more aggressive, and not associated with extratumoral endocrine cell proliferations or with signs of gastrin hypersecretion. Tumor cells were diffusely immunoreactive for chromogranin A and synaptophysin but usually negative for chromogranin B or HISL-19. Scattered serotonin cells were found in ten carcinoids. They were more frequent in infiltrating than in intramucosal tumors as were the less represented pancreatic polypeptide cells whereas the reverse was found for alpha-subunit-containing cells. These results are of relevance for tumor pathogenesis and may provide the rationale for a less aggressive therapeutic approach in the patients. 
Facial dystonia, essential blepharospasm and hemifacial spasm. Movement disorders, or dyskinesias, in the facial region may be categorized in several ways. Dystonic movement disorders in the cranial-cervical region, including essential blepharospasm, Meige syndrome and spasmodic torticollis, are characterized by uncontrollable squeezing movements in the face and neck. These disorders typically present in the fifth and sixth decades of life. Essential blepharospasm is particularly debilitating, as the involuntary eyelid closure that accompanies this condition may result in functional blindness with an otherwise normal visual pathway. Hemifacial spasm is an intermittent, unilateral, spasmodic contraction of the muscles innervated by the facial nerve. This disorder usually presents in the third or fourth decade and has a different underlying pathophysiology than the dystonias. Botulinum A toxin therapy has largely supplanted surgical intervention in the treatment of essential blepharospasm and hemifacial spasm. 
S-adenosyl-L-methionine in the treatment of patients with intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy: a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study with negative results. S-Adenosyl-L-methionine has been reported to induce beneficial effects in intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy. Because cholestasis of pregnancy has a high prevalence in Chile and a deleterious effect on fetal prognosis, we decided to verify the efficacy of S-adenosyl-L-methionine in this disease. Eighteen patients with pruritus that appeared during pregnancy and with elevated serum levels of bile salts (68.1 +/- 15.9 mumol/L; mean +/- S.E.M.) and ALT (226 +/- 50 KU/L) were enrolled in a prospective double-blind study comparing the effects of the drug with a placebo. S-Adenosyl-L-methionine, 900 mg, or placebo was administered in daily intravenous infusions for 20 days. Every 5 days liver function tests were done and pruritus was assessed using a preestablished score. No significant differences in pruritus or in serum levels of bile salts, ALT, bilirubin and alkaline phosphatases were seen during or after treatment between patients who received S-adenosyl-L-methionine (n = 9) or placebo (n = 9). No relevant adverse reactions were detected. Most patients had cesarean sections because of reasons unrelated to the therapeutic trial. All newborns had Apgar scores greater than 7 and normal postnatal development. Our patients had moderately severe to severe cholestasis of pregnancy as indicated by the onset of pruritus before wk 32 of pregnancy. Seven of nine multiparous patients had a past history of recurrent cholestasis of pregnancy. In this study, the administration of S-adenosyl-L-methionine during 20 days did not improve intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy. 
Fabry disease: detection of 13-bp deletion in alpha-galactosidase A gene and its application to gene diagnosis of heterozygotes. Polymerase chain reaction amplification of reverse-transcribed messenger RNA from a patient with Fabry disease revealed a 13-base pair deletion in the 5' region (exon 1) of alpha-galactosidase A complementary DNA. This gene rearrangement was not detected by Southern or Northern analysis. Short direct repeats were present around the breakpoints, and considered to be of pathogenetic significance. Gene diagnosis of the mother and a female cousin was successfully achieved by polymerase chain reaction amplification of genomic DNA; the former as a Fabry disease heterozygote and the latter as a normal homozygote. 
Breast conservation therapy. Severe breast fibrosis after radiation therapy in patients with collagen vascular disease. Two patients with collagen vascular disease (rheumatoid arthritis and scleroderma) had extremely poor cosmetic results after breast radiation therapy (RT). The patient with rheumatoid arthritis received 5251 cGy at 210 cGy per day, followed by a 1600 cGy iridium-192 implant boost. Between 8 and 11 months post-RT she had severe breast fibrosis, retraction, and pain that required a mastectomy for relief. The patient with scleroderma received 5040 cGy at 180 cGy per day without a boost. Between 1 and 4 months post-RT the systemic symptoms of scleroderma progressed and the breast became hard and retracted. Both rheumatoid arthritis and scleroderma are chronic systemic diseases characterized by severe inflammation and an autoimmune component. The presence of scleroderma at or before treatment should be considered a contraindication to breast RT, whereas the presence of active rheumatoid arthritis should be considered a relative contraindication. An autoimmune mechanism will be presented to explain both the fibrosis and the systemic progression of collagen vascular disease that was observed. 
Urinary pepsinogen I as a tumor marker of stomach cancer after total gastrectomy. The possibility that urinary pepsinogen I is a tumor marker of stomach cancer after total gastrectomy was examined. To decide the cutoff level of urinary pepsinogen I after total gastrectomy, urine samples from 15 patients who had undergone total gastrectomy for stomach cancer in the early or advanced stages and had been free from recurrence for more than 5 years were examined by pepsinogen I-specific radioimmunoassay. The mean concentration of urinary pepsinogen I was 17.5 +/- 7.4 ng/ml and the cutoff level of urinary pepsinogen after total gastrectomy was set at 32 ng/ml (mean + 2 SD). Twenty-two of 74 cases who had undergone total gastrectomy for stomach cancer were regarded as positive. And 20 of these 22 positive cases had definite clinical signs of recurrence of stomach cancer. There were only two false-positive cases. These results suggest that urinary pepsinogen I will be an useful tumor marker in detecting the recurrence of stomach cancer after total gastrectomy. 
Acute postinfarction septal rupture: long-term results. From 1973 to 1989, 66 patients received early surgical repair for acute postinfarction ventricular septal rupture. Mean age was 64 +/- 7 years (range, 45 to 80 years). Ventricular septal rupture occurred soon after acute myocardial infarction (3.4 +/- 4 days), and the first medical treatment occurred 6.7 +/- 7 days after onset of acute myocardial infarction. Three patients had a previous myocardial infarction. The site of the rupture was anterior in 38 patients (57%) and posterior in 28 (43%). Forty-four patients (67%) were in shock at the time of admission. Intraaortic balloon pumping was used preoperatively in 28. Operation was performed at the time of maximal efficacy of medical treatment. The same technique was used in all cases. Associated procedures included coronary bypass grafting in 5 patients and valvar operation in 5. The patients have been carefully followed up for up to 16 years. Hospital mortality was 45% (30 patients) and was cardiac related or due to acute renal failure in 25 patients (83%). No correlation could be revealed between early death and age, sex, preoperative intraaortic balloon pumping, or year of operation. Location of the ventricular septal rupture (early mortality of 57% for posterior versus 37% for anterior ventricular septal rupture) and shock at the time of admission (52% versus 32%) showed a trend toward significance (0.08 less than or equal to p less than 0.10). Response to initial active therapy has a strong predictive value (mortality of 70% in unresponsive patients versus 14% in responders; p less than 0.001). 
Endothelial modulation of vascular tone: relevance to coronary angioplasty and restenosis. The vascular endothelium importantly modulates many biochemical and physiologic properties of the vascular wall, including the release of potent vasoactive factors, maintenance of an anticoagulant state and modulation of vascular growth by the release of both proliferative and antiproliferative substances. Prominent among these endothelial roles is the production of a potent vasodilator or family of vasodilators termed the endothelium-derived relaxing factor, one of which has been identified to be nitric oxide or a closely related compound. Several diseases that commonly occur in patients undergoing coronary angioplasty alter many facets of endothelial function and may predispose to adverse clinical sequelae of angioplasty, including immediate thrombosis, restenosis and vascular spasm. Several features of the endothelium-derived relaxing factor, how it is altered by pathologic processes and how these considerations relate to the immediate and late postangioplasty periods are discussed. 
Iontophoresis versus subcutaneous injection: a comparison of two methods of local anesthesia delivery in children. The relative efficacy of local lidocaine anesthesia administered by subcutaneous injection and by iontophoresis was studied in 13 pediatric renal dialysis patients (ages 11-19 years: mean age 15.8 years). Each patient served as his own control at 3 assessment periods. Each type of anesthetic delivery method was administered to either of 2 fistula sites. Patients used visual analogue scales to rate pain, anxiety, and satisfaction for each method. Behavioral observations were made by an observer and a nurse. Paired sample t tests were used to compare the 2 drug delivery methods for patient, observer, and nurse ratings across assessment periods. There were no significant differences between methods for ratings of anxiety before or during the procedure. The injection of lidocaine was rated as more painful by the observer and nurse (with a trend for patients) than the use of iontophoresis. But, the patients and nurse rated the injection method as more effective. Iontophoresis was never rated as superior to the injection method, even after turning over control of drug delivery by iontophoresis to the patient (sessions 2 and 3). Patients were more satisfied with iontophoresis at session 2 when they took over control, but lost enthusiasm by session 3. Three subjects withdrew from the study due to cutaneous burns and prolonged anesthesia delivery time with iontophoresis. Iontophoresis appears to be effective in reducing the pain of dialysis needle insertion but requires further investigation before it can be considered a viable alternative to subcutaneous injection. 
Thrombocytosis in adults: analysis of 777 patients. A total of 777 patients with thrombocytosis, defined as a platelet count of greater than 500 x 10(9)l-1, seen in a University hospital over a 1-year period, were studied prospectively for aetiology. The most frequent causes of thrombocytosis were infection (21.9%), rebound thrombocytosis (19.4%), tissue damage (17.9%), chronic inflammatory disorders (13.1%) and malignancy (5.9%). Thrombocytosis associated with multiple causative factors, occurring simultaneously, was seen in 6.1% of cases. Thrombocytosis of greater than or equal to 1 million x 10(9)l-1 was found most frequently in patients with multiple aetiological factors occurring at the same time, in myeloproliferative disorders, or in postsplenectomy patients. 
Late recovery of function after oculomotor nerve palsy. We studied three patients who developed oculomotor nerve paresis from different causes. Each patient improved somewhat over several months, after which there was no further improvement for at least six months. Although the pareses were thought to be stable after the period of no improvement, each patient subsequently had further improvement in both motility and alignment with resolution of diplopia in primary position and in more than one of the cardinal positions of gaze. Patients with oculomotor nerve paresis may improve further after an initial period of improvement followed by several months of stability. 
Maintenance therapy in peptic ulcer disease. The maxim "once an ulcer, always an ulcer" is still an appropriate description for the chronic nature of peptic ulcer disease. The goals for treating patients with ulcer disease are to relieve symptoms, heal the acute ulcer, reduce the risk of ulcer recurrence and complications, and decrease the economic impact of this chronic disease while maintaining the patient's quality of life. Patients with documented peptic ulcer disease should be carefully evaluated and a treatment plan devised that takes into account the possible need for maintenance therapy. Risk factors that seem to reflect a high likelihood of ulcer recurrence should be identified early in all ulcer patients and attempts made to minimize or correct them in the future. Assuming that a diagnosis of peptic ulcer disease has been firmly established and an adequate period of drug treatment makes complete ulcer healing likely, a reasonable way to proceed is outlined in Figure 4. If the patient is young and generally healthy, has an uncomplicated ulcer and few risk factors favoring ulcer relapse, either no treatment or symptomatic selfcare would be reasonable. If one chooses the latter course, the patient can be given a prescription for 3 to 6 months of medication and told to take full therapy for any recurrent symptoms, continuing the treatment until symptoms are relieved. The failure of such treatment to relieve symptoms after 2 to 3 weeks, the onset of alarming symptoms such as intense pain, vomiting, or melena, or possibly the exhaustion of the 6-month supply of medication with continued mild symptoms should lead to reevaluation. Alternatively, such a patient could be managed with no therapy and seen again if ulcer symptoms recur and reevaluated for further diagnosis and treatment. Obviously, patients who are candidates for these approaches to postulcer healing management are those with a low risk for ulcer recurrence and who are likely to be compliant with follow-up advice. Accordingly, careful patient selection seems most important in prescribing symptomatic self-care or intermittent full-dose maintenance treatment. On the other hand, if the patient has had a complicated course of ulcer disease, such as bleeding, or has a significant number of risk factors that would make early ulcer relapse highly likely, it would be prudent to institute continuous maintenance therapy while working to reduce or eliminate the adverse risk factors. Any relapse of symptomatic ulcer disease during noncontinuous maintenance therapy should indicate the need for return to a continuous dosing program.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS). 
Immunodepletion of extrinsic pathway inhibitor sensitizes rabbits to endotoxin-induced intravascular coagulation and the generalized Shwartzman reaction. We have reported earlier that immunodepletion of extrinsic pathway inhibitor (EPI) sensitizes rabbits to disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) induced by infusing a low concentration of tissue factor (TF). We now describe the effect of immunodepletion of EPI in rabbits administered endotoxin. Cortisone-treated rabbits were administered anti-rabbit EPI immunoglobulin (IgG) or Fab fragments or were administered control nonimmune material before an injection of endotoxin. In four of seven rabbits administered anti-EPI, plasma EPI activity levels were reduced by 70% to 80% of initial levels for 6 to 8 hours. In these rabbits the endotoxin induced extensive DIC, as evidenced by substantial decreases in fibrinogen, factor V, factor VIII, and platelets, and gross hemorrhagic necrosis of the kidneys due to massive deposition of fibrin in the glomerular microcirculation (the generalized Shwartzman reaction). In three rabbits administered anti-EPI, plasma EPI levels were only transiently reduced. In these rabbits and in four rabbits administered nonimmune IgG or Fab, endotoxin induced minimal to moderate intravascular clotting and deposits of fibrin were not found in the glomerular capillaries. Because it is believed that TF expressed on monocytes triggers endotoxin-induced coagulation, these data are taken as evidence that EPI functions as a natural anticoagulant that can regulate factor VIIa/TF activity expressed on cell surfaces in vivo. They support a hypothesis that EPI prevents thrombotic complications that might otherwise result from exposure of blood to cytokine-induced generation of small amounts of TF on cell surfaces in many inflammatory and infectious disease states. 
Testicular plasmacytoma. A case report with immunohistochemical studies and literature review. Plasmacytomas of the testes are extremely rare tumors, especially when occurring in the absence of a previous or concurrent diagnosis of multiple myeloma. We present a case of solitary testicular plasmacytoma in a 71-year-old man who had no clinical evidence of myeloma. Immunohistochemical stains showed monoclonal cytoplasmic production of IgA-kappa within tumor cells. A summary of the other reported cases of testicular plasmacytoma is presented. Plasmacytoma of the testes, while occasionally manifesting as a solitary, primary lesion, most likely is a precocious, highly unusual manifestation of systemic multiple myeloma. 
The effect of prostacyclin on intracranial pressure in patients with acute hepatic and renal failure. Prostacyclin was administered on 20 occasions to 12 patients with fulminant hepatic failure complicated by acute renal failure prior to commencing dialysis at a dose of 5 ng/kg.min. Intracranial pressure was noted to increase during the infusion from a median of 12 mmHg (95% confidence limits 9-14) to 17 mmHg (12-25), p less than 0.01, at the same time the mean arterial blood pressure declined from 79 mmHg (65-82) to 64 (56-70), p less than 0.01, and the cerebral perfusion pressure from 62 mmHg (53-67) to 44 mmHg (41-55), p less than 0.01. The changes were greater for those patients who subsequently died from cerebral edema. Patients with fulminant hepatic and acute renal failure are at risk of dying from cerebral edema. The direct administration of prostacyclin, used for extracorporeal anticoagulation, may cause a further increase in intracranial pressure and reduce cerebral perfusion, thus resulting in patient morbidity and mortality.
