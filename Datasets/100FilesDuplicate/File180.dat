Detection of fibronectin receptor in sera: its clinical significance as a parameter of hepatic fibrosis. Pooled sera collected from cirrhotic patients was fractionated by affinity chromatography with a fibronectin receptor monoclonal antibody against the beta-subunit of fibronectin receptor. Eluates were assayed using Western immunoblotting. The relative mobility of the protein reactive with fibronectin receptor antibody was nearly identical to that of the beta-subunit of fibronectin receptor, confirming that fibronectin receptor is present in human serum. Serum levels of the beta-subunit of fibronectin receptor were analyzed by sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay in patients with various liver diseases. The serum level of fibronectin receptor (micrograms/ml) was significantly higher in patients with chronic hepatitis (inactive, 2.59 +/- 0.04; active, 3.45 +/- 0.13), cirrhosis (4.77 +/- 0.30), alcoholic liver disease (2.96 +/- 0.16) and hepatocellular carcinoma (4.71 +/- 0.49) than in normal subjects (2.11 +/- 0.08). Strong positive correlation was observed between serum levels of fibronectin receptor and histological findings, particularly in the degree of hepatic fibrosis. Immunohistochemical studies with fibronectin receptor antibody revealed that the beta-subunit of fibronectin receptor was present on the plasma membrane of hepatocytes and sinusoidal lining cells in the normal liver and was increased in fibrotic areas and on the plasma membrane of hepatocytes and sinusoidal lining cells of fibrotic liver. The serum level of fibronectin receptor in patients with chronic liver diseases may therefore be a useful marker of hepatic fibrosis. 
Occupational urticaria from welding polyurethane. An urticarial reaction associated with high fever developed in a welder on four occasions while he was welding steel profiles filled with polyurethane. The fumes emitted during pyrolysis of polyurethane and inhaled by the patient probably caused the urticarial reaction. Provocation tests with two pyrolysis products, 4,4-diphenylmethane diisocyanate and 4,4-diaminophenylmethane, were negative. This case demonstrates the difficulty in detecting the cause of urticaria induced by airborne chemicals. 
Timing of surgery during menstrual cycle and survival of premenopausal women with operable breast cancer Timing of operation in relation to menstrual phase might affect outlook in premenopausal women with operable breast cancer. We examined the records of 249 such women treated between 1975 and 1985, and compared overall and recurrence-free survival in those whose operation was 3-12 days after their last menstrual period (LMP) (group 1, n = 75) with those in whom it was 0-2 or 13-32 days after LMP (group 2, n = 174). Overall and recurrence-free survival were greatly reduced in group 1 women (p less than 0.001 for both). Actuarial survival at 10 years was 54% in group 1 versus 84% in group 2. This effect was independent of other factors, was of much the same importance as nodal status in multivariate analysis, was largely confined to histologically node-positive cases, seemed to be greater in women with small tumours (less than or equal to 2 cm), and was seen in patients with oestrogen-receptor positive and negative tumours. Thus phase of menstrual cycle at operation is of great importance for long-term outlook in premenopausal women with breast cancer. 
Cardiovascular surgery in blacks. The available information concerning cardiovascular surgery in blacks is very limited and incomplete. Those few reports that do exist seem to show that the usual indications for surgery, preoperative findings, and final results can be expected. Acquired heart disease is as important a cause of mortality in African Americans as in others and is amenable to surgical intervention. Surgical mortality is easily attributable to the usual iatrogenic variables or comorbid disease. At present it is uncertain whether the incidence of inoperable disease or problems of access to health care are responsible for the low rate of utilization by blacks. A more accurate account will become available when large-volume programs begin to report their results. 
Six-year retrospective surveillance of gastroenteritis viruses identified at ten electron microscopy centers in the United States and Canada. To identify the prevalence, seasonality and demographic characteristics of patients with viral gastroenteritis, we reviewed 6 years of retrospective data on viral agents of gastroenteritis screened by electron microscopy at 10 centers in the United States and Canada. From 52,691 individual electron microscopic observations, a virus was detected in 16% of specimens, and the yearly positive detection rate among centers ranged from 8 to 34%. Rotavirus was the agent most commonly observed (26 to 83%), followed by adenoviruses (8 to 27%, respiratory and enteric combined), and small round viruses (SRVs) (0 to 40%) which were second most common at two of the centers. Rotavirus and astrovirus detections occurred more often in the winter but seasonal trends in detection were not apparent for the other viruses. Of all astroviruses detected 64% were found in infants (less than 1 year); unlike the other agents studied SRVs were detected in a large percentage of infants (48%) and older children and adults (20%). Among hospitalized patients a majority of all astroviruses, caliciviruses and SRVs were detected 7 days or more after admission in contrast to both rotaviruses and adenoviruses which were more likely to be detected earlier. The data suggest that SRVs are common agents of gastroenteritis and may be important causes of nosocomial infections. Because of the relative insensitivity of direct electron microscopy as a screening method for SRVs, astroviruses and caliciviruses, these data probably underestimate the true prevalence of disease caused by these agents. 
High dietary linoleic acid affects the fatty acid compositions of individual phospholipids from tissues of Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar): association with stress susceptibility and cardiac lesion. For 16 wk Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) post-smolts were fed practical-type diets that contained either fish oil (FO) or sunflower oil (SO) as the lipid component. Both diets contained adequate (n-3) polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA). All the phospholipids of heart and liver from SO-fed fish had increased levels of 18:2(n-6), 20:2(n-6) and 20:3(n-6); phosphatidyl choline (PC) and phosphatidyl ethanolamine (PE) also had increased 20:4(n-6). There was a general decrease in 20:5(n-3) in the phospholipids, reflected in an increase in the 20:4(n-6)/20:5(n-3) ratio, especially in PC and PE. The fatty acid compositions of phospholipids from brain and retina were much less affected by dietary linoleate than those of heart and liver. Fish fed SO developed severe heart lesions that caused thinning of the ventricular wall and muscle necrosis. The fish fed SO also were susceptible to a transportation-induced shock syndrome that caused 30% mortality. These results establish that a diet with a low (n-3)/(n-6) ratio can cause changes in fatty acid metabolism that are deleterious to the health of salmonid fish, especially when subjected to stress. 
Evaluation of the Ca2+ distribution in aortic tissue of spontaneously hypertensive and normotensive rats [letter] In the present study, particle-induced X-ray emission (PIXE) was used to get information on the spatial distribution of Ca2+ in aortas of spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) and normotensive controls aged 1 week, 4 weeks, and 12 weeks. To differentiate changes in Ca2+ metabolism in hypertensive arteries from secondary phenomena due to the arteriosclerosis, the animals were examined in the earliest stage of hypertension. It was found that the Ca2+ content was not elevated in the aortic smooth muscle of SHR aged 1 week (n = 11), as compared to normotensive controls (n = 10) (186.8 +/- 89.9 micrograms Ca2+/g tissue v 254.0 +/- 173.3 micrograms Ca2+/g). The Ca2+ content was raised (P less than .05) in the aortic smooth muscle of SHR aged 4 weeks (n = 13), as compared to 12 WKY rats (4 weeks) (726.0 +/- 130.4 micrograms Ca2+/g tissue v 440.3 +/- 214.4 micrograms Ca2+/g) and in 17 SHR (3 months), as compared to 13 WKY rats, respectively (3390.1 +/- 729.9 micrograms Ca2+/g tissue v 1632.1 +/- 569.5 micrograms Ca2+/g). The results confirm the age-related increase in the arterial Ca2+ content in normotensive rats and demonstrate additionally that this age-related rise in arterial Ca2+ content is accelerated in SHR. 
Urinary calcium as an early marker for preeclampsia. Women who develop preeclampsia during pregnancy excrete less calcium than healthy pregnant women. Whether this reduction in calcium excretion precedes or follows hypertension is unknown. We prospectively measured urinary calcium excretion in 103 consecutive nulliparous women at risk for preeclampsia and presenting for prenatal care before 24 weeks' gestation. Serial 24-hour urine specimens were obtained at 10-24 weeks, 25-32 weeks, and 33 weeks to term. After delivery, the charts were reviewed for the presence of preeclampsia and gestational hypertension. At the first collection, patients who later developed preeclampsia excreted less urinary calcium (169 +/- 30 mg/24 hours; mean +/- standard error of the mean) than those who remained normotensive (298 +/- 15 mg/24 hours) (P less than .05); this reduction persisted throughout gestation. Using a receiver operator curve, we calculated a predictive threshold calcium value for hypertension of 195 mg/24 hours. The difference in the incidence of preeclampsia between pregnant women with calcium excretion values at or below 195 mg/24 hours (87%, 95% confidence interval 52-98%) and those with values above that level (2%, confidence interval 0.3-8%) was highly significant (Fisher exact test, P less than .0001). The 95% lower limit of relative risk for preeclampsia in patients with a calcium excretion equal to or below 195 mg/24 hours in the first collection was 9.4. These observations suggest a pathophysiologic role for altered urinary calcium excretion in women with preeclampsia that may contribute to the early identification of patients at risk for this disease. 
Manometric and radiologic investigations and biofeedback treatment of chronic idiopathic anal pain. In 12 patients suffering from chronic idiopathic anal pain, the rectosphincteric function was studied using manometric and x-ray techniques. The results of manometric investigations were compared with those obtained in 12 healthy volunteers. In all patients, the resting pressure in the anal canal was significantly higher than in control subjects. In 10 patients, defecography revealed abnormalities of the pelvic muscles. We treated the patients by using biofeedback techniques, consisting of voluntary modifications of the state of contraction of the external sphincter. In all cases, pain disappeared after a mean of eight biofeedback training sessions. When noxious manifestations had disappeared, manometry showed a significant decrease in the anal canal resting pressure. Our results indicate 1) that chronic idiopathic anal pain is associated with abnormal anorectal manometric profiles, probably resulting from a dysfunctioning of the striated external anal sphincter, and 2) that biofeedback training is an effective treatment for chronic idiopathic anal pain. 
Pathophysiology and treatment of septic shock. The mortality from septic shock continues to range between 40% to 60% despite advances in cardiovascular support and antibiotic therapy. Impairment of host defenses predisposes to the development of both severe infection and septic shock. The activation of a myriad of cellular and plasma mediators by microbial toxins produces the systemic and metabolic manifestations of sepsis. The clinical presentation includes characteristic clinical, hemodynamic, and laboratory abnormalities. Multiple organ systems are involved during septic shock, with outcome dependent on the circulatory response and the development of sequential organ failures. Initial resuscitation is directed at restoring tissue perfusion with fluids and vasoactive drugs, guided by assessment of the patient's hemodynamic status. Identification of the site of infection and choice of appropriate antibiotics are critical to the success of therapy. Newer therapeutic modalities include immunologic interventions that attenuate mediator activity and modulate the immune response. Pharmacologic therapies are also being developed that are aimed at blocking the actions of specific mediators. 
Testing the psychogenic vomiting diagnosis. Four pediatric patients. We treated four patients with chronic vomiting during childhood in whom a tentative diagnosis of psychogenic vomiting was made after an extensive evaluation. In each case, the diagnosis was reconsidered during the course of treatment, as observations about the patients and their response to interventions accumulated. In three instances, these observations did not fit those expected if the diagnosis of psychogenic vomiting was correct. This led to a reexamination of the organic evaluation and the discovery of an undiagnosed organic contribution to the vomiting. In the fourth patient, gastric emptying studies confirmed that there was a strong psychological contribution to the vomiting, and helped to more carefully define this contribution. Family and individual psychotherapy and treatment were aided by the greater clarity in diagnosis. 
Anti-tumor effect of L-methionine-deprived total parenteral nutrition with 5-fluorouracil administration on Yoshida sarcoma-bearing rats. L-methionine-deprived total parenteral nutrition (methionine-deprived TPN), infusing amino acid solution devoid of L-methionine and L-cysteine by the method of TPN as an only protein source, showed enhancement of the effect of several anti-cancer agents. In this study the combined effect of the methionine-deprived TPN with administration of 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) was examined in Yoshida Sarcoma (YS)-bearing rats, from aspects of effects on the tumor metastasis and the host animal's life span, in the following four groups treated with: methionine-deprived TPN with administration of 5-FU, methionine-deprived TPN without administration of 5-FU, L-methionine-contained TPN plus 5-FU, and L-methionine-contained TPN without 5-FU. In the first experiment, TPN was continued for 8 days in the four groups, and the anti-cancer effect of methionine-deprived TPN and administration of 5-FU based on both the growth of the primary tumor at the implanted site and the tumor metastasis was studied from the view point of pathologic findings of animals killed immediately after these treatments. In experiment 2 the survival period was examined after these treatments for 10 days with subsequent oral feeding until death. The results were as follows: proliferation of YS, transplanted subcutaneously, was markedly suppressed; particularly hematogenous metastasis, characteristic in YS, was prominently blunted then obtained an apparent longer survival period in rats treated with the methionine-deprived TPN with administration of 5-FU. 
Regional cerebral blood flow correlates of language processes in reading disability. This series of studies tests the hypothesis of abnormal left hemisphere activation in reading-disabled subjects during language task performance. First, a left superotemporal focus of activation, as measured by regional cerebral blood flow, was found to be positively correlated with task accuracy in a group of 69 normal adults. Next, that left superotemporal activation was replicated in a second group of 83 adults whose childhood reading ability was known from standardized tests given in childhood. Finally, in that latter group, childhood reading ability was also found to be inversely correlated with focal activation in a more posterior, temporoparietal area of cortex. Adult reading outcome was statistically unrelated to this finding. The results are interpreted as suggesting a trait anomaly of left hemisphere cerebral activation in adults who were dyslexic as children and as providing an existence proof of individual differences in focal cortical activation sites during constant task demands. 
Role of postoperative radiation therapy in stage IIIa non-small cell lung cancer. One hundred forty-six patients with pathological stage IIIa non-small cell lung cancer were retrospectively analyzed to determine whether postoperative radiation therapy improves survival and reduces locoregional recurrences. The survival rate of the overall group at 1, 3, and 5 years was 56%, 24%, and 17%, respectively. Regarding the type of resection and histology, we did not observe statistically significant differences. Patients with N0 and N1 disease were grouped and compared with the N2 group, and survival at 3 and 5 years was 41% and 27%, respectively, for the T3 N0-1 group and 17% and 15%, respectively, for the T3 N2 group (p less than 0.001 and p = 0.05, respectively). Eighty-six patients received postoperative irradiation (45 to 50 Gy) and 60 did not. We have not observed any improvement in survival with postoperative radiation therapy, except in those patients with N2 disease. Median survival time was 6 months for patients without irradiation and 15 months for those with irradiation (p = 0.071). According to locoregional recurrences, a slight benefit with postoperative radiation therapy was observed. 
Accidental astemizole overdose in young children. 6 cases of accidental astemizole poisoning in children have been reported to the Finnish Poison Information Center. The children were aged 1 year 7 months to 3 years 4 months and had taken doses of 2.5 to 16.7 mg/kg, at least twelve times that recommended. In 2 children the overdose was verified by measurement of drug concentrations. Despite measures to prevent drug absorption prolonged QTc-interval, a sign of cardiac toxicity, was found in all 5 children on whom an electrocardiogram was available for analysis, and severe ventricular arrhythmias developed in 1. Young children with accidental astemizole overdose should be carefully monitored in hospital. Similar precautions may be justified in cases of overdose with other selective H1-histamine receptor antagonists. 
Serum amyloid A (SAA3) produced by rabbit synovial fibroblasts treated with phorbol esters or interleukin 1 induces synthesis of collagenase and is neutralized with specific antiserum. We report that nucleic acid sequence analysis of a full-length cDNA clone for a rabbit serum amyloid A (SAA)-like protein has identified this protein as more closely related to SAA3 than to SAA1. SAA3 induced collagenase synthesis in rabbit synovial fibroblasts, and immune IgG raised against this SAA protein abrogated the induction. Using antisera to immunoprecipitate biosynthetically labeled 3H-SAA and 3H-collagenase from culture medium, we compared the levels of SAA and collagenase synthesized by cultures of rabbit fibroblasts at early passage (passages 3-6) with those synthesized by late passage cells (passage 16). Comparatively high levels of both proteins were produced constitutively by fibroblasts at low passage. With increasing passage, levels of both proteins drop so that by passage 16, constitutive production of SAA and collagenase was only approximately 15-20% that of passage 3 cells. Cells at low passage could be readily stimulated with phorbol myristate acetate (PMA) or interleukin 1 (IL-1) to synthesize increased amounts of both SAA and collagenase. In passage 5 cells treated with PMA, we detected increased SAA mRNA by 1.5 h and collagenase mRNA by 5 h. However, older passage cells were more refractory to stimulation and required longer induction times. We suggest that SAA3 may be expressed by fibroblasts at sites of acute inflammation or injury, and that elevated levels of SAA3 may signify "activated" fibroblasts which are already producing increased amounts of collagenase constitutively and which are predisposed to further stimulation. 
Haemorrhagic colitis and haemolytic-uraemic syndrome: false positive reaction with a rotavirus latex agglutination test. A stool sample from a child with haemorrhagic colitis and haemolytic-uraemic syndrome gave a positive reaction with the RotaScreen latex agglutination test in the absence of other evidence of rotavirus infection. When this test is performed on bloody specimens, positive reactions should be interpreted with caution and confirmed by other means. 
Recurrent porokeratosis. A 63-year-old man developed linear, annular and accuminate lesions which showed the histological features of porokeratosis. The lesions cleared spontaneously, recurred several months later and ulcerated, then cleared again. The spontaneous resolution and recurrence of the lesions is a hitherto undescribed pattern of porokeratosis. 
Detection of minimal residual disease in acute lymphoblastic leukemia using immunoglobulin hypervariable region specific oligonucleotide probes. To develop a sensitive and specific assay for minimal residual disease in acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), we exploited the enormous diversity of genomic sequences created by immune receptor gene rearrangements. To isolate clone-specific sequences, we first synthesized oligonucleotides that match conserved variable (VH) and joining (JH) sequences flanking the third hypervariable region (HVR3) in the rearranged immunoglobulin heavy chain (IgH) locus. In polymerase chain reactions (PCR), these primers were then used to amplify the intervening HVR3 segments from leukemic DNA samples. Of 12 B-lineage ALLs studied, ten generated one or more fragments of the size expected for HVR3 gene segments. Thus, this single pair of amplimers was sufficient to isolate HVR3 sequences from a majority of acute lymphoblastic leukemias. To verify that the amplified fragments originated from HVR3 alleles and to assess their diversity, we sequenced 7 PCR products derived from 6 leukemias. In addition to elements of recognized D segments, each of the 7 fragments contained novel VH-D and D-JH junctional sequences, including N nucleotides, not known to be present in the germline. Each sequence was unique, and allele-specific oligonucleotide probes hybridized only to HVR3 segments from which the probes were derived. Therefore, as anticipated, these HVR3 segments appeared to possess the diversity required to serve as clonal markers for leukemic populations. To demonstrate that these amplified HVR3 alleles could serve as the basis for a sensitive and specific assay to detect rare leukemic cells, we analyzed in detail one pre-B leukemia that had rearranged 2 IgH alleles. The HVR3 sequences were shown to be linked to rearranged JH-containing restriction fragments in digests of genomic DNA, establishing their origin in the leukemic cells. We synthesized oligonucleotides corresponding to the unique junctional sequences in the HVR3 segments. Using these novel amplimers in an allele-specific amplification and hybridization procedure, we showed that this assay can detect 10 leukemic cells in a background of 10(6) normal blood mononuclear cells. In contrast, the leukemic HVR3 sequences were not detected in extracts of normal or unrelated remission leukemic leukocytes. We conclude that the assay for specific IgH HVR3 sequences is a realistic strategy for detection of minimal residual disease in B-lineage ALL. 
Beware of malignant lymphoma masquerading as facial inflammatory processes. Considerable difficulty exists in diagnosing some sarcomas, lymphomas, and carcinomas that develop in the head and neck. Frequently these malignancies appear clinically as masquerading inflammatory disease processes. Recognition of these rare lesions usually occurs only after the inflammatory-like symptoms have failed to respond to conventional management, necessitating a more extensive evaluation and even repeated biopsies. The use of special stains, immunohistochemical studies, electron microscopy, and immunofluorescence techniques may still produce an inconclusive histopathologic diagnosis. This case report documents a rare extranodal malignant lymphoma of the right maxillary sinus that mimicked an odontogenic infection with superimposed chronic rhinosinusitis in a 19-year-old sailor. The cause of his chief complaint and presenting symptoms challenged the astuteness of clinicians, surgeons, and histopathologists on two continents and the high seas. Clinicians should maintain a high index of suspicion for malignancy when inflammatory-like lesions fail to respond to the usual appropriate management. Indications for early biopsy of suspect lesions and aggressive follow-up are emphasized. 
Treatment of primary fibrositis/fibromyalgia syndrome with ibuprofen and alprazolam. A double-blind, placebo-controlled study. A multidimensional evaluation of 78 patients with primary fibrositis/fibromyalgia syndrome (PFS) revealed no significant relationship between clinical measures of physical discomfort and psychological measures. This observation provided evidence against the notion that the pain of PFS has a psychological etiology. The same patients were randomized into 4 groups for treatment with ibuprofen and/or alprazolam in a randomized, double-blind, double-dummy, placebo-controlled pilot trial. Clinical improvement in patient rating of disease severity and in the severity of tenderness upon palpation was most apparent in the subgroup of patients who were receiving both ibuprofen and alprazolam. An 8-week, open-label study in which 52 patients received both drugs further documented improvement in outcome measures. These data indicate that treatment with a combination of ibuprofen and alprazolam can be beneficial for some patients with PFS. 
Assessment of the extent of jeopardized myocardium during acute coronary artery occlusion followed by reperfusion in man using technetium-99m isonitrile imaging. We tested the feasibility of technetium-99m methoxyisobutyl isonitrile (Tc-MIBI) imaging for delineating jeopardized myocardium during acute coronary occlusion and reperfusion in man. This new perfusion agent was injected in 25 patients during elective percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA) of a single-vessel left anterior descending (LAD) coronary artery stenosis. Distinct perfusion defects were present on "occlusion" images but not on "open vessel" images obtained 20 to 24 hours later in 21 patients (84%). The extent and severity of perfusion defects were significantly smaller in patients with distal versus proximal LAD occlusions (3.4 +/- 1.2 versus 5.2 +/- 1.5 segments; p less than 0.001). The only factor that was significantly related to the presence or absence of such "ischemic" perfusion defects was the absence or presence of visible collateral vessels to the LAD (p less than 0.03). The site of occlusion, presence of wall motion abnormalities, or occlusion time did not influence the results significantly. Thus the myocardial area at risk could be visualized and quantitated by Tc-MIBI imaging even after occlusion times as short as 15 seconds, but functioning collateral vessels are capable of protecting jeopardized myocardium in this setting. 
Detection of human papillomavirus DNA on routine Papanicolaou's smears by in situ hybridization with the use of biotinylated probes. Specific human papillomavirus (HPV) types have been implicated as playing a major role in the development of cervical neoplasias. HPV DNA types usually have been identified by nucleic acid hybridization assays with the use of radiolabeled probes. These techniques are sensitive and specific but are not suitable for large-scale clinical use. To detect specific HPV DNAs simply and rapidly, in situ hybridization (ISH) with the use of biotinylated HPV DNA 6/11 and 16/18 probes was done on destained Papanicolaou's (Pap) smears from 545 patients. All smears showed koilocytotic changes. HPV DNAs were demonstrated not only in cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) and atypia, but also in squamous cells with minimal nuclear changes (karyomegaly) and perinuclear halos. HPV DNA 16/18 was detected in 52% of the smears with CIN I, 44% of those with CIN II and III, 19% of those with atypia, and 4% of the minimal changes. HPV DNA 6/11 was detected in 27% of the smears with CIN I, 27% of those with atypia, and 6% of the minimal changes. HPV DNAs were also detected in smears without koilocytotic changes. Thus, ISH with the use of biotinylated probes can serve as an adjunct to Pap smears in detecting HPV infection. 
Genotypic analysis of diffuse, mixed cell lymphomas. Comparison with morphologic and immunophenotypic findings. Malignant lymphoma, diffuse, mixed small and large cell type, as defined in the Working Formulation, is heterogeneous both morphologically and immunophenotypically and, in some cases, clonality may be difficult to determine. Because gene rearrangement analysis has been shown to be a sensitive method for determining clonality, the authors genotyped 20 cases and compared the results with histologic and immunophenotypic findings. Immunophenotypic studies demonstrated that all lesions were composed predominantly of T cells. In addition, in eight cases either a monoclonal B-cell population (five lesions) or an aberrant immunophenotype (two T, one B) was detected, supporting a malignant diagnosis. In seven of these eight lymphomas, genotypic analysis confirmed the presence of a population of clonal cells. One case with an abnormal T-cell phenotype was germline. In 12 cases the immunophenotypic results were uncertain (i.e., no clonal population or abnormal immunophenotype was identified). Genotypic analysis provided evidence of clonality in eight. In four cases with uncertain immunophenotypic results, a clonal population also could not be identified with the use of Southern blot analysis. Thus, the authors conclude that gene rearrangement analysis is a valuable tool in the study of diffuse mixed cell lymphomas and is complementary to immunophenotypic studies. In addition, the authors analyzed the major breakpoint region of the bcl-2 protooncogene on chromosome 18, either by Southern blot analysis and/or with the polymerase chain reaction. The authors identified the t(14;18)(q32;q21) translocation in seven B-cell lymphomas, five of which were not considered to be of follicular center cell type on the basis of morphologic findings. These results suggest that the histologic spectrum of follicular center cell lymphomas is greater than is appreciated in the literature. 
Pathological hypertrophy and cardiac interstitium. Fibrosis and renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system. Left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) is the major risk factor associated with myocardial failure. An explanation for why a presumptive adaptation such as LVH would prove pathological has been elusive. Insights into the impairment in contractility of the hypertrophied myocardium have been sought in the biochemistry of cardiac myocyte contraction. Equally compelling is a consideration of abnormalities in myocardial structure that impair organ contractile function while preserving myocyte contractility. For example, in the LVH that accompanies hypertension, the extracellular space is frequently the site of an abnormal accumulation of fibrillar collagen. This reactive and progressive interstitial and perivascular fibrosis accounts for abnormal myocardial stiffness and ultimately ventricular dysfunction and is likely a result of cardiac fibroblast growth and enhanced collagen synthesis. The disproportionate involvement of this nonmyocyte cell, however, is not a uniform accompaniment to myocyte hypertrophy and LVH, suggesting that the growth of myocyte and nonmyocyte cells is independent of each other. This has now been demonstrated in in vivo studies of experimental hypertension in which the abnormal fibrous tissue response was found in the hypertensive, hypertrophied left ventricle as well as in the normotensive, nonhypertrophied right ventricle. These findings further suggest that a circulating substance that gained access to the common coronary circulation of the ventricles was involved. This hypothesis has been tested in various animal models in which plasma concentrations of angiotensin II and aldosterone were varied. Based on morphometric and morphological findings, it can be concluded that arterial hypertension (i.e., an elevation in coronary perfusion pressure) together with elevated circulating aldosterone are associated with cardiac fibroblast involvement and the resultant heterogeneity in tissue structure. Nonmyocyte cells of the cardiac interstitium represent an important determinant of pathological LVH. The mechanisms that invoke short- (e.g., collagen metabolism) and long-term (e.g., mitosis) responses of cardiac fibroblasts require further investigation and integration of in vitro with in vivo studies. The stage is set, however, to prevent pathological LVH resulting from myocardial fibrosis as well as to reverse it. 
Age-related complications and optimal choice of artificial heart valves in elderly patients. The use of bioprosthetic heart valves in elderly patients is presently advocated by many since implanting mechanical valves are considered to result in unacceptable rates of thromboembolism and bleeding. However the somewhat limited durability of bioprostheses has to be acknowledged since a group of elderly patients will eventually require a reoperation due to tissue failure. We have evaluated our policy to implant mechanical heart valve prostheses even in elderly patients based on the conception that we believe that anticoagulation in this group of patients can be handled with a low rate of complications. 
Needle electromyographic evaluation of patients with myofascial or fibromyalgic pain. Several past studies have evaluated the electromyographic activity of myofascial trigger points with conflicting results. This study was performed to determine whether spontaneous activity or motor unit activity was present in patients with focal myofascial pain or fibromyalgia. Using routine needle electromyographic techniques, we sampled reproducibly tender focal areas (tender points), similar tender areas with pain referral (trigger points), associated muscle bands and adjacent uninvolved musculature. Twenty-five subjects (14 females, 11 males, mean +/- SD age 43 +/- 14 years) were studied; twenty-one subjects with focal myofascial pain and four with fibromyalgia. Spontaneous fibrillatory or positive sharp wave potentials were not found in any muscle in the 25 subjects. There was no evidence of focal motor unit activity in the tender points, trigger points or associated muscle bands in either group. Motor unit recruitment was similar in all areas sampled. We conclude that no electrodiagnostic evidence of ongoing denervation or focal muscle spasm is found in association with focal myofascial pain or fibromyalgia. 
Lymphocytic hypophysitis and pulmonary sarcoidosis. Report of a case. Lymphocytic hypophysitis is one of the causes of hypopituitarism in the postpartum period. Some of these patients have been reported to have other organ-specific autoimmune diseases, and the disease is considered to be autoimmune in nature. The authors describe a unique case of lymphocytic hypophysitis in a young woman. She had hemianopia that developed three days after delivery. Computed tomography scans revealed an intrasellar mass lesion. Secretions of adrenocorticotropic hormone and growth hormone were decreased. Although no organ-specific autoantibodies were detected in her serum, OKT4-positive helper T lymphocytes were increased in peripheral blood. Pituitary biopsy at craniotomy showed typical features of lymphocytic hypophysitis. Pulmonary and eye sarcoidosis developed 11 months after the delivery. This is, to the authors' knowledge, the first case of lymphocytic hypophysitis associated with sarcoidosis in other organs. 
Deregulation of a homeobox gene, HOX11, by the t(10;14) in T cell leukemia. Molecular cloning of the t(10;14)(q24;q11) recurrent breakpoint of T cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia has demonstrated a transcript for the candidate gene TCL3. Characterization of this gene from chromosome segment 10q24 revealed it to be a new homeobox, HOX11. The HOX11 homeodomain is most similar to that of the murine gene Hlx and possesses a markedly glycine-rich variable region and an acidic carboxyl terminus. HOX11, while expressed in liver, was not detected in normal thymus or T cells. This lineage-restricted homeobox gene is deregulated upon translocation into the T cell receptor locus where it may act as an oncogene. 
Why don't all heavy snorers have obstructive sleep apnea? Patients with obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) and heavy snorers without apnea both show intrathoracic suction pressures during sleep that exceed their static upper airway closing pressures. Complete airway occlusion, however, occurs only in the former patient group. We hypothesized that the kinetic properties of the airflow would be different in these two types of patients because of differences in upper airway morphology. The pharyngeal computed tomography (CT) was used to measure the cross-sectional areas of the upper airways in 15 patients with OSA, 25 nonapneic heavy snorers, and 14 control subjects while they were awake. Nocturnal breathing was monitored with the static charge-sensitive bed (SCSB). The patients with OSA had a narrower airspace at the velopharyngeal (VP) level than the controls (p less than 0.01); the nonapneic snorers did not differ from the other groups. At the tongue base (TB) and the hyoid bone (HB) levels there was no difference between the OSA and the control groups, but the nonapneic snorers had narrower airways at both of these levels compared with control subjects (p less than 0.01) and at the hyoid bone level compared with the OSA group (p less than 0.05). The VP/HB ratio was the parameter that best distinguished the patients with OSA from the nonapneic snorers (lower in the OSA group, p less than 0.001). We suggest that airway collapse during sleep is favored by a narrow velopharynx associated with large hypopharynx. Some heavy snorers may not have an oropharyngeal collapse because the peak inspiratory suction pressure could already be damped down at the level of the relatively narrow hypopharyngeal airways. 
Risk factors for second cancers of the upper respiratory and digestive systems: a case-control study. A case-control study of determinants of multiple cancers of the upper respiratory and digestive system (URDS) was conducted using a patient cohort-nested design. We analyzed demographic and risk factor information and clinical variables related to the index cancer for 85 cases of multiple cancers and 170 controls matched on sub-site of the index cancer of the case and date of hospital admission. Follow-up information for the control group was used to infer the person-years-at-risk for the cohort of 1977 patients. URDS cancer patients experienced a 10.7 times (95% confidence interval: 8.5-13.2) higher risk of additional related cancers than the general population. Although controls had cancers of the same sites as those of cases and thus, strongly tobacco and alcohol-related, there were marked residual effects for these two risks factors. In addition, characteristics related to the extension and clinical course of the index cancer were strongly associated with the patient's risk of developing additional cancers. 
Reduction of rattlesnake-venom-induced myonecrosis in mice by hyperbaric oxygen therapy. Hyperbaric oxygen therapy (HBOT) at 1, 2, and 2.75 atmospheres absolute (ATA) was used to treat rattlesnake (Crotalus atrox) venom-induced tissue damage and edema in thigh muscles of mice. Tissue damage was evaluated by double-blind histopathologic examination: tissue edema was determined by measuring tissue water content. A total of 10 intermittent exposures to oxygen over a period of 4 days at 2 and 2.75 ATA did not influence the resolution of venom-induced tissue edema, whereas tissue damage was significantly ameliorated as compared to air-treated envenomated controls. HBOT also promoted healing in the venom-injected mice as evidenced by the presence of regenerating muscle cells. It is concluded that HBOT may limit rattlesnake venom-induced myonecrosis and promote healing in a dose-response relationship without reducing venom-induced edema. 
Intra-aortic balloon counterpulsation support in the high-risk cardiac patient undergoing urgent noncardiac surgery. Patients with a recent myocardial infarction, congestive heart failure, sever angina, or uncorrected multivessel coronary artery disease are at increased risk of cardiac complications after major noncardiac surgery. Although invasive hemodynamic monitoring and preoperative optimization of cardiac status may lead to some reduction in the rate of perioperative cardiac events, the mortality from such events remains high. We report our experience with the use of perioperative intra-aortic balloon counterpulsation in eight patients with unstable coronary syndromes or severe coronary artery disease who underwent urgent noncardiac surgery. There were no perioperative cardiac events while the intra-aortic balloon pump (IABP) was in place. There were two postoperative cardiac events (non-fatal myocardial infarction, congestive heart failure) in the first postoperative week after the IABP was removed. One patient required emergent femoral thrombectomy as a result of intra-aortic balloon counterpulsation and subsequently died of a gastrointestinal hemorrhage. Intra-aortic balloon counterpulsation should be considered as an adjunct to maintain hemodynamic stability for the high-risk cardiac patient about to undergo urgent or emergent noncardiac surgery. 
Effect of recirculation on exacerbation of ischemic vascular lesions in rat brain. Using electron microscopy, we investigated the small arteries and veins in ischemic lesions induced by occlusion of the ostium of the middle cerebral artery in 42 rats. We observed endothelial denudation in the small arteries of rats receiving occlusion for greater than 6 hours. When the occluding cylinder was removed to allow for reperfusion, however, 2 hours of occlusion was sufficient for endothelial denudation to occur. Medial smooth muscle cells seemed to be more vulnerable to ischemia than endothelial cells because ultrastructural changes in the former cells preceded endothelial denudation. Moreover, endothelial denudation definitely exacerbated vascular changes so that medial necrosis appeared to be complete beneath the denuded areas, allowing erythrocytes, platelets, and exogenous tracers to penetrate into the cytoplasm of smooth muscle cells. These arterial lesions seemed to be repaired 10 days after removal of the occluding cylinder following 2 hours of occlusion. On the other hand, small veins in the ischemic lesion did not show endothelial denudation or medial necrosis. Our study suggests that arterial changes in ischemic lesions play a role in exacerbating the brain edema caused by recirculation after ischemia. 
Cigarette smoking and flap and full-thickness graft necrosis. The association between cigarette smoking and necrosis of flaps and full-thickness grafts was analyzed in 220 patients. Review of a series of 916 flaps and full-thickness grafts revealed 44 patients in whom some degree of tissue necrosis occurred. These patients with necrosis were age and gender matched with 176 controls randomly selected from the remaining 872 patients. Current high-level smokers, that is those smoking one or more packs per day, had necrosis develop approximately three times more frequently than never smokers, low-level smokers (less than one pack per day), or former smokers (95% confidence interval, 1.2 to 8.2). Former smokers (relative risk, 1.4; 95% confidence interval, 0.6 to 3.2) and low-level smokers (relative risk, 1.1; 95% confidence interval, 0.2 to 6.1) were at a negligible increased risk for necrosis that was not significantly different from never smokers. Once tissue necrosis developed, the median percent of the visible flap or graft tissue that necrosed was approximately threefold greater among current smokers (regardless of the number of packs per day smoked) than never smokers. 
Claudication: an unusual side effect of DHE administration. DHE is effective in the treatment of acute and chronic migraine. The side effects most commonly observed are abdominal discomfort, muscle pain, diarrhea and anxiety. DHE is a dehydrogenated amino acid ergot alkaloid and, as such, causes only limited vasoconstriction; indeed, its overall effects include peripheral vasodilation. The literature is replete with reports of clinical vasospasm and claudication occurring with therapeutic doses of ergotamine. There has not been any previous description of claudication caused by DHE. This paper describes pulselessness in two patients during relatively short courses of DHE. Treatment consisted of calcium channel blockers and discontinuation of DHE. Recovery was complete. 
Antigenic differences between the endometrium of women with and without endometriosis. Serum and peritoneal fluid from 12 women with endometriosis, 4 women with uterine leiomyomata and 6 fertile women without endometriosis (controls) and serum from 4 women with adenomyosis were tested with a passive hemagglutination assay for antibodies against endometrium from all the controls, 8 patients with endometriosis and all patients with uterine leiomyomata and from implants from 8 patients with endometriosis. Serum antibody titers in patients with endometriosis or leiomyomata were significantly higher against endometrial or implant antigens from patients with endometriosis and 2 patients with leiomyomata than those against the controls' endometrium. Peritoneal fluid endometrial antibody titers failed to reflect these antigenic differences. Controls and patients with adenomyosis had low titers of endometrial antibodies in their serum or peritoneal fluid. Antigenic differences appear to exist between the endometrium of patients with endometriosis and that of controls. 
Human immunodeficiency virus infection does not alter serum transaminases and hepatitis B virus (HBV) DNA in homosexual patients with chronic HBV infection. The influence of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection on the clinical course of chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection is controversial. We followed a cohort of 64 homosexual men with persistent HBs antigenemia for a median of 24 months in the hepatitis clinic of a large urban public hospital. We divided the patients into three groups according to their immune status. Group 1 (n = 13) consisted of HIV-seropositive men with evidence of immunosuppression; group 2 (n = 17), HIV-positive patients without evidence of immunosuppression; and group 3 (n = 34), HIV-negative patients. We followed serum ALT and HBV DNA determinations. There was no difference in the demographic characteristics of the three groups. Group 1 had significantly lower levels of circulating T4 lymphocytes. We found no differences in the number and severity of episodes of HBV reactivation, serum ALT levels, or HBV DNA scores among the three groups. In each group, the percentage of patients with circulating HBV DNA was the same. We conclude that HIV infection apparently does not influence the markers of liver inflammation or HBV replication in homosexual men. 
Ossification of the cervical ligamentum flavum. A case of a 61-year-old man with ossification of the cervical ligamentum flavum is reported. The ossification was located on the left side of C3-4. The symptoms improved with laminectomy and resection. Ossification of the ligamentum flavum usually occurs in the lower thoracic spine, and is rare in the cervical region. Including the present one, only eight cases have been reported to our knowledge. The clinical features and pathogenesis are discussed. 
Revision total hip arthroplasty for aseptic failure. A review of 276 cases. The results of 276 cemented revision total hip arthroplasties performed for aseptic failure between 1977 and 1986 have been reviewed. The mean time between revision and review was 75 months (range 30 to 144). Of 220 cases available for review, 159 were assessed clinically and radiographically, and 32 by postal questionnaire. Eighteen hips required further revision, 12 for loosening, two for sepsis, two for persistent pain, and one each for fracture and recurrent dislocation. A further six hips were radiologically and symptomatically loose. Pain was mild or absent in 83%. Over half were able to walk a mile or more; 70% flexed more than 70 degrees; 15% had a flexion deformity, but in only 7% was this more than 10 degrees. The mean Harris hip score was 74. Survival at five years was 95% and at 10 years, 77%. 
Acute sternal opening after cardiac surgery in children: effect on plasma atrial natriuretic peptide. Plasma atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) was measured immediately before and 15 minutes after re-opening of the sternotomy and delayed sternal closure were performed to alleviate possible myocardial compression in 3 children. As acute re-opening of the sternotomy is a rare occurrence our sample size was necessarily small. ANP increased following the procedure in all 3 patients, and this was significant (p less than 0.02) when compared to plasma levels obtained from 9 children who underwent sternotomy prior to elective cardiac surgery. Following acute re-opening of the sternotomy there was an increase in median urine output and a decrease in median central venous pressure. Our results illustrate that it is atrial wall stress rather than intra-atrial pressure that determines release of ANP, and in addition suggest ANP may be a factor in the rapid clinical improvement following delayed sternal closure for atypical tamponade in children. 
Eosinophil-induced chronic active hepatitis in the idiopathic hypereosinophilic syndrome. A 19-yr-old man had features of chronic hepatitis with piecemeal necrosis as the sole clinical feature of the idiopathic hypereosinophilic syndrome. Liver biopsy specimens demonstrated the presence of activated eosinophils and, by immunohistochemical staining, major basic protein in areas of hepatic cell damage. The case demonstrates the clinical presentation of the idiopathic hypereosinophilic syndrome as chronic hepatitis and the association between eosinophil infiltration and degranulation with the presence of hepatocyte necrosis. 
Clinical follow-up and immunogenetic studies of 32 patients with eosinophilia-myalgia syndrome 31 patients with L-tryptophan-associated eosinophilia-myalgia syndrome (EMS) that developed during the United States outbreak in 1989 were followed up prospectively at a university hospital outpatient rheumatology clinic for 16 to 24 months from the onset of their illness. Another patient with EMS associated with L-tryptophan in 1988 was followed up for 30 months. 93% of the 28 survivors from the 1989 cohort continue to have symptoms affecting 1-4 organ systems (median 3) and 3 have died, so the disorder produces considerable morbidity and mortality. The chronic sequelae most often associated with long-term disability are sclerodermatous skin thickening (54%), sensorimotor polyneuropathy (61%), proximal myopathy (36%), and severe episodic myalgias (64%). Thrombocytopenia developed in 1 patient. HLA-class II typing revealed a non-significant trend towards an association with HLA-DR4. Early therapy with corticosteroids did not seem to prevent the development of chronic manifestations. 
Risk factors in relation to postoperative complications and mortality after total gastrectomy in aged patients. To clarify the risk factors contributing to postoperative complications in elderly patients undergoing total gastrectomy, 84 patients with primary gastric cancer were evaluated. Twenty-seven patients were older than 65 years of age; they had much more preoperative cardiac (P = 0.00003), respiratory (P = 0.0008), and multiorgan impairment (P = 0.009) than did the control group (age less than 65 yrs). Although overall morbidities (44.4% vs. 19.2%; P = 0.01) and overall septic complication rates (33.3% vs. 12.2%; P = 0.02) were higher in aged patients, no significant differences between the two groups were found in the incidence of major surgical complications (18.5% in aged patients vs. 10.5% in control groups; P = NS), serious septic (sepsis score greater than 10) complications (18.5% vs. 7.0%; P = NS) and hospital mortalities (11.1% vs. 3.5%; P = NS). In older patients the occurrence of multiorgan impairment and malnutrition was significantly related to postoperative complication rates. These results suggest that the degree of organ impairment rather than age is predictive of postoperative difficulty and should be used in assessing preoperative risk. 
Effects of acute, graded compression on spinal nerve root function and structure. An experimental study of the pig cauda equina. A well-controlled experimental model for analysis of compression-induced functional changes of the porcine cauda equina is presented. The model allows for electrophysiologic investigation of a variety of neurophysiologic changes induced by nerve root deformation. At an acute pressure threshold of 50-75 mm Hg, changes in both afferent and efferent conduction are induced. With higher compression pressure, a differential recovery in afferent and efferent conduction is seen. 
Risk of recurrence after myomectomy. The risk of recurrence of uterine myomas was analyzed in 622 patients who underwent myomectomy between 1970 and 1984 at the First Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology of the University of Milan. The cumulative 10-year recurrence rate was 27%, and this increased steadily up to the end of the observation period. Differences were not observed in frequency of recurrence by age at diagnoses or by the site of the myomas at surgery. Patients with a single myoma tended to experience a lower rate, but this finding was not statistically significant. Women who gave birth to a child after myomectomy had a 10-year recurrence rate of 15%, against 30% for those who did not; this difference was statistically significant. 
Recurrence after radiotherapy for glottic carcinoma. A series of 478 patients with T1-3N0 glottic carcinoma treated by irradiation is presented. Of these patients, 320 were previously untreated, whereas 158 patients were referred for treatment of a recurrence after receiving radiotherapy elsewhere. The primary recurrence rate in the previously untreated patients was 10%. The rate was higher in T2 and T3 tumors, poorly differentiated tumors, and in patients who were in poor general condition. Over 80% of the recurrent tumors were Stage pT3 or pT4, whereas 12% of total laryngectomy specimens showed necrosis only with no evidence of tumor. The necrosis rate in previously untreated patients was 1% for T1 tumors, 4% for T2 tumors, and 3% for T3 tumors. Of all tumors, 60% were transglottic when they recurred, whereas only 29% were confined to the glottis at recurrence. Histologic diagnosis had a high sensitivity but a low specificity, indicating that a negative histologic report is unreliable. Of patients with a recurrent primary tumor, 13% were untreatable. The 5-year survival after a primary recurrence was 39%, and the main prognostic factors were sex, T stage at recurrence, and time to recurrence. Of patients available for follow-up at 5 years 49% were alive with a larynx, 5% were alive without a larynx, 13% were dead of the original cancer, and 33% had died of other causes. In those suffering a primary recurrence, the commonest cause of death was a subsequent lymph node metastasis, followed in order of frequency by stomal recurrence and recurrence in the pharyngeal remnant. The hospital mortality rate after laryngectomy was 3%, and 30% of patients undergoing laryngectomy developed a pharyngocutaneous fistula. The recurrence rate in lymph nodes was 14% at 5 years, general condition and T stage being the only significant predictors of recurrence. Only 17% of patients had small (N1) nodes by the time the diagnosis of cervical lymph node recurrence was made, and 27% of all patients were unsuitable for treatment. Host, tumor factors, and time to recurrence were not significant predictors of survival after node recurrence. The survival rate 5 years after node recurrence was 16%, and the main cause of death in those who died was uncontrolled disease in the neck. The hospital mortality after salvage neck dissection was 4.7%. 
Increased Na(+)-H+ exchange in jejunal brush border membrane vesicles of spontaneously hypertensive rats. The spontaneously hypertensive rats and their genetically matched controls, Wistar-Kyoto, serve as models of essential hypertension. The present study was undertaken to determine whether brush border membrane vesicles obtained from jejunal enterocytes of spontaneously hypertensive rats show increased Na(+)-H+ exchange as part of a generalized membrane disorder. Brush border membrane vesicles were prepared from the jejunum of adult spontaneously hypertensive rats and Wistar-Kyoto rats using an Mg2+/ethylene glycol tetraacetic acid precipitation method. Uptake of 22Na by these vesicles was found to be into an osmotically sensitive intravesicular space rather than mere binding. Initial Na+ uptake by brush border membrane vesicles was greater in spontaneously hypertensive rats than in Wistar-Kyoto rats (P less than 0.05). Higher total and amiloride-sensitive Na+ uptake in spontaneously hypertensive rats occurred in the presence of an outwardly directed pH gradient, and uptake became statistically similar to that of Wistar-Kyoto rats in the absence of a pH gradient. Moreover, amiloride-insensitive Na+ uptake under an outwardly directed pH gradient did not differ significantly between the two groups. The enhanced Na(+)-H+ activity in spontaneously hypertensive rats is not due to altered membrane permeability to protons, as is shown by acridine orange-quenching studies. Kinetic studies for amiloride-sensitive Na+ uptake showed a greater Vmax in spontaneously hypertensive rats compared with Wistar-Kyoto rats (1.46 +/- 0.05 vs. 1.08 +/- 0.08 nmol.mg protein-1.7 s-1) but the Km values were similar in the two groups. These finding, along with similar findings previously reported in vascular smooth muscle and renal tissue of SHR, strongly suggest that an increased Na(+)-H+ exchange is related to the development of hypertension. 
Changes in lipids and lipoproteins with long-term estrogen deficiency and hormone replacement therapy. Cross-sectional data of the long-term effects of estrogens, androgens, and progestogens on lipids and lipoproteins were obtained in 556 postmenopausal women aged 24 to 85 years with follow-up for 1 to 44 years. Baseline values were obtained in 155 women from less than 1 year up to 30 years after menopause. Total cholesterol and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol tended to rise during the early postmenopausal years while high-density lipoprotein cholesterol did not change. Triglycerides were related to weight and were significantly different only between untreated women of normal weight (128.3 +/- 7.80 mg/dl) and hormone users weighing greater than 200 pounds (252.9 +/- 9.44 mg/dl), p less than or equal to 0.001. Although mean high-density lipoprotein cholesterol was lower with both C-21 progestogens (64.5 +/- 4.16 mg/dl) and C-19 progestogens (61.9 +/- 3.84 mg/dl), there were no statistically significant differences on comparison with levels in the unopposed estrogen users (67.0 +/- 3.94 mg/dl). Smoking significantly depressed high-density lipoprotein cholesterol in both hormone users (p less than or equal to 0.001) and untreated women (p less than or equal to 0.001). Added progestogens do not adversely affect lipids and lipoproteins over the long term when adequate dosages of estrogens are used. 
On pain mechanisms in cluster headache. Various possible pathophysiological mechanisms to explain the pain in cluster headache are reviewed. Several locations for the initiation of pain along the primary afferent pathways in cranial nerves are discussed, together with the local mechanisms that might be responsible. These include neurogenic inflammation of large cranial vessels, irritation of vascular pain fibres by compression of dilated vessels in bony canals, and irritative foci in or around cranial sensory ganglia. In particular, recent neuroanatomical and pharmacological findings on nociceptive innervation of the intracranial segment of the internal carotid artery are commented upon. The possibilities for referred pain to explain the location of pain is illustrated. Evidence for involvement of central pain modulatory systems in the pain production is discussed. Finally a synthesis is made of the probable peripheral and central pain mechanisms in the disease. 
Twenty-four-hour esophageal pH monitoring: the most useful test for evaluating noncardiac chest pain. STUDY OBJECTIVE: To compare the diagnostic capabilities of traditional esophageal tests (manometry and provocative testing with acid and edrophonium) and 24-hour esophageal pH monitoring in identifying an esophageal cause of chest pain. DESIGN: A prospective study of 100 consecutive patients referred by cardiologists to the esophageal laboratory for evaluation of esophageal causes of chest pain. SETTING: Tertiary-referral university hospital. METHODS: Esophageal manometry performed with 10 wet swallows of water. Acid perfusion (0.1 N hydrochloric acid) and edrophonium (80 micrograms/kg intravenously) tests were placebo-controlled with a positive study defined as replication of typical chest pain. Esophageal pH monitoring identified (1) abnormal acid exposure times in the upright, supine, or combined position, and (2) correlation between symptoms and acid reflux, i.e., symptom index. The esophagus was identified as "probably" contributing to chest pain only if the acid or edrophonium test was positive or if there was a positive correlation between symptoms and acid reflux during pH monitoring. RESULTS: Esophageal manometry was abnormal in 32 patients (32%), but patients were asymptomatic during the study. The acid perfusion test was positive in 18 of 95 patients (19%), and the edrophonium test was positive in 15 of 78 patients (19%). Abnormal acid exposure times were found in 48 patients (48%). Of the 83 patients with spontaneous chest pain during 24-hour pH testing, 37 patients (46%) had abnormal reflux parameters and 50 patients (60%) had a positive symptom index (mean positive score 56%, range 6% to 100%). CONCLUSIONS: Acid reflux is a common and potentially treatable cause of noncardiac chest pain. Traditional esophageal tests usually miss this diagnosis. Twenty-four-hour esophageal pH monitoring with symptom correlation is the single best test for evaluating patients with noncardiac chest pain. 
Long-term diet modification and platelet activity. Platelet activity was assessed in a sub-sample of 56 participants in the MRC Diet and Reinfarction Trial (DART). Men whose diets contained a high ratio of polyunsaturated to saturated fatty acids (a P:S ratio of greater than 0.5) showed reduced secondary platelet aggregation to adenosine diphosphate (ADP) in platelet-rich plasma (PRP), and diminished platelet aggregation to ADP in whole blood. A trend of reduced secondary platelet aggregation to ADP with increasing dietary eicosapentaenoic acid was noted, but this was not statistically significant. The results of this study and the MRC Diet and Reinfarction Trial suggest a mediatory role for platelet activity in the relationship between diet and ischaemic heart disease. 
An immunohistochemical study of sarcomatoid liver carcinomas. Six cases of primary hepatic carcinomas with a significant amount of sarcomatoid elements were examined by using immunohistochemical stainings. Four of the six cases were associated with ordinary hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), one with cholangiocellular carcinoma (CCC), and one with mixed HCC and CCC. Alpha-fetoprotein and alpha-1-antitrypsin were negative in sarcomatoid cells of all cases; vimentin stained positively in sarcomatoid tumor cells in two of the six cases; and cytokeratin (CK8) was detected in five cases. The CK8 was not detected in tumor cells of two cases of hepatic angiosarcoma, two of metastatic leiomyosarcomas, and one of metastatic fibrosarcoma, although vimentin stained positively in all these true sarcomas. It was concluded that sarcomatoid dedifferentiation of liver carcinomas might derive from both HCC and CCC. In addition CK8 might be an excellent marker to make a differential diagnosis of sarcomatoid cancers from true metastatic or primary sarcomas of the liver. 
Radiologic evaluation of esophageal motility: results in 170 patients with chest pain. The role of radiologic evaluation of esophageal motility in patients with chest pain has been studied rarely. Consequently, we compared the results of radiologic and manometric examinations of the esophagus in 170 patients (106 women, 64 men; mean age, 53 years) with chest pain. Manometry, used as the standard, was normal in 114 (67%) patients, and showed the following abnormal diagnoses in the remaining 56 (33%): nonspecific esophageal motility disorder in 27 (48%), nutcracker esophagus in 16 (29%), diffuse esophageal spasm in 11 (20%), and achalasia in two (4%). Radiologic specificity was 93% (106/114) and overall sensitivity only 36% (20/56). Sensitivity increased to 50% by excluding those with nutcracker esophagus, a purely manometric diagnosis. Of the 20 patients in whom nonspecific esophageal motility disorder and diffuse esophageal spasm were undetected on radiologic examination, minimal manometric criteria for diagnosis were available in 18. Our results show that radiologic recognition of normal esophageal peristalsis is excellent. However, the vast majority of patients with chest pain do not appear to have abnormal esophageal motility on radiologic evaluation. 
Relapsing transverse myelitis. Acute transverse myelitis is a monophasic disorder, the recurrence of which raises the question of multiple sclerosis (MS) or other multifocal CNS disease. We now report three patients with a previously undescribed syndrome of relapsing isolated acute transverse myelitis. Each had two to five attacks over periods of 3 to 8 years, characterized by ascending paresthesias, urinary retention, sensory loss with a thoracic or cervical level, paraparesis, hyperreflexia, and bilateral Babinski signs. MRI demonstrated areas of increased signal intensity on T2- and proton density-weighted scans and decreased signal intensity on T1-weighed scans of the cervical or thoracic spinal cord consistent with an inflammatory or demyelinating process. All patients had normal complete myelograms, oligoclonal IgG bands were consistently absent from the cerebrospinal fluid, cranial MRIs were normal, and there was no other clinical or laboratory evidence of MS, collagen-vascular disease, or active viral infection. They were treated with high doses of intravenous corticosteroids, stabilized between episodes, and had partial or complete recovery. The recognition of these three patients at a single medical center in a 1-year period suggests that relapses of acute transverse myelitis may not be rare. 
Transfer from ophthalmology to another service is a marker of high risk medical events. Of 3632 consecutive admissions to the Wilmer Ophthalmological Institute between July 1, 1987 and June 30, 1989, 27 patients required transfer to a medical or surgical service (0.74%). The major reasons for transfer included acute or decompensated cardiac disease (26%), poorly controlled diabetes mellitus (19%), acute renal failure (11%), coagulopathy, stroke, and hypertension (7% each). Only one transfer was a direct result of an anesthesia complication. The highest rates of transfers were associated with orbital (4.3%), enucleation/evisceration (3.1%), and glaucoma (2.3%) surgeries, while vitreoretinal surgery had the lowest rate of transfer (0.3%). Most of the transfers of patients with orbital disease were for management of related problems such as sinusitis or increased intracranial pressure. 
New pathologic observations in juvenile onset parkinsonism with dystonia. A patient with hereditary juvenile onset parkinsonism with dystonia died at age 39. There were Lewy bodies and regionally selective neuronal damage in the substantia nigra pars compacta. These changes closely resemble those seen in Parkinson's disease, and emphasize the selective vulnerability of the ventral tier of the pars compacta in these degenerations. 
Kindling as a model of drug-resistant partial epilepsy: selection of phenytoin-resistant and nonresistant rats. Complex partial seizures comprise the major uncontrolled seizure type in adult patients with epilepsy. Any improvement of our understanding of the mechanisms through which these seizures are often refractory to antiepileptic drugs is therefore of considerable importance. By examining the effects of the anti-epileptic drug phenytoin in a large group of kindled rats, a widely used model of complex partial seizures, animals with different sensitivity to this drug were selected. Using determination of the focal seizure threshold for evaluation of phenytoin's anticonvulsant effect, most animals (about 60%) showed variable effects in response to phenytoin. However, about 20% of the animals ("phenytoin nonresponders") showed no increase in their focal seizure threshold at repeated test trials with phenytoin, and 20% ("phenytoin responders") exhibited reproducible increases in focal seizure threshold after injection of phenytoin. Phenytoin responders and nonresponders thus selected were used for subsequent experiments. The different response of focal seizures to phenytoin was not related to differences in pharmacokinetics or location of the stimulating electrode. Although phenytoin reproducibly increased the threshold for induction of afterdischarges in responders, it did not alter severity or duration of the elicited seizure response. In contrast to phenytoin, carbamazepine induced increases in focal seizure threshold in all kindled rats. Duration of seizures and afterdischarges were significantly reduced by carbamazepine in phenytoin responders, but not in nonresponders, although plasma levels of carbamazepine were the same in both groups. The difference in response of kindled rats to phenytoin was restricted to kindled seizures, because phenytoin induced the same anticonvulsant effect on the threshold for generalized tonic electroconvulsions (determined via transauricular electrodes) in both groups of kindled rats. 
Xanthoma disseminatum: a case with extensive mucous membrane involvement. A 37-year-old man had red or brownish papules on his face, chest, and groin, where they coalesced into plaques. Endoscopic examination revealed the presence of small xanthomatous papules on the mucous membrane of the stomach. A biopsy specimen revealed a dense infiltrate of histiocytes, foam cells, Touton giant cells, and inflammatory cells. The diagnosis of non-X histiocytosis was confirmed by immunohistochemical studies of the infiltrate. 
Rhabdomyolysis and cutaneous necrosis following intravenous vasopressin infusion. A continuous IV infusion of vasopressin was administrated to a patient with cirrhosis of the liver and acute gastrointestinal bleeding from esophageal varices. In the first 24 hours, the patient developed rhabdomyolysis and cutaneous necrosis. Stopping vasopressin infusion resulted in relief of these lesions. The rarity of these complications suggests an idiosyncratic reaction of susceptible individuals that may be related to previous vascular disease or a failure in baroreceptor regulation. 
Detection of ACTH-producing bronchial carcinoid tumors: MR imaging vs CT. Adrenocorticotrophic hormone (ACTH)-producing bronchial carcinoid tumors tend to occur in the middle third of the lung adjacent to pulmonary vessels. Because they cause signs and symptoms when quite small (by virtue of their ACTH production), they may not be detected by CT. MR imaging was performed in 10 consecutive patients with surgically proved ACTH-producing bronchial carcinoid tumors in order to test the ability of MR to clarify equivocal or indeterminate findings on CT examinations. All bronchial carcinoid tumors had high signal intensity on T2-weighted and short-inversion-time inversion-recovery images, facilitating their distinction from pulmonary vasculature. In eight patients, the CT and MR images were equivalent in the detection of bronchial carcinoid tumors. In two patients, MR showed tumors in the middle third of the lung that were equivocal on CT. MR imaging may distinguish small bronchial carcinoid tumors from adjacent pulmonary vessels in the central third of the lung at a time when the CT study is nondiagnostic or equivocal. 
The hemodynamic response to hemorrhage in tumor-bearing animals. Tumor-bearing rats submitted to hypovolemia have higher mortality rates than have non-tumor-bearing control rats. To determine the mechanisms underlying this sensitivity to hemorrhage, we studied Fischer-344 rats with subcutaneous methylcholanthrene-induced sarcoma (tumor burden, 10% body weight) to determine hematologic and blood volume alterations. Subsequently we used the same animal model in an unanesthetized condition to determine the sensitivity to hemorrhage and resuscitation, as well as vascular responsiveness to vasoactive agents. The rats were separated into two groups: control and tumor-bearing rats (TBR). Sensitivity to hemorrhage and resuscitation was determined by bleeding the conscious rats (15 ml/kg) and resuscitating them with 0.9% NaCl (45 ml/kg). Vascular responsiveness was determined after injection of varying doses of phenylephrine and nitroglycerin, with continuous measurement of mean arterial pressure (MAP). Rate of increase of MAP, maximum MAP, relative increase in MAP (maximum minus baseline), rate of recovery toward baseline MAP, and duration of the response were determined. There was a significant anemia in TBR, but blood volume was similar in both groups. Baseline MAP was significantly higher in control rats (125.3 +/- 8.1 mm Hg) compared with TBR (107.5 +/- 6.0 mm Hg). After hemorrhage, MAP in TBR reached significantly lower levels than in control rats. In addition, after saline resuscitation, MAP in TBR did not return to baseline levels, whereas MAP in control rats returned to prehemorrhage MAP. With nitroglycerin, MAP decreased to lower levels in TBR than in control rats. With phenylephrine, the maximum MAP reached was significantly higher, and the response to phenylephrine was maintained for a significantly longer period in control rats compared with TBR. We conclude that TBR are more sensitive to hypovolemic events in association with decreased oxygen-carrying capacity, profound hypotension, and altered overall vascular responsiveness to sympathetic stimuli. 
Effect of infarct location on myocardial salvage assessed by technetium-99m isonitrile. To investigate the influence of infarct location on myocardial salvage, technetium-99m isonitrile was injected into 43 patients with a first myocardial infarction before early reperfusion therapy. Primary coronary angioplasty was performed in 22 patients and successful intravenous thrombolytic therapy was given to 15 patients, both within 6 h of the onset of chest pain. Patency of the infarct-related artery was confirmed by angiography in all 37 patients. In the remaining six patients (three with and three without early thrombolytic therapy) the infarct-related artery remained occluded. Single photon emission computed tomography was performed within 6 h of the administration of technetium-99m isonitrile and repeated at the time of hospital discharge. Radionuclide ejection fraction at discharge was significantly lower for patients with anterior infarction (0.41 +/- 0.12) than for those with inferior infarction (0.56 +/- 0.09, p less than 0.001). Early perfusion defect size, a measure of myocardium at risk, was greater in patients with anterior than in those with inferior infarction (52 +/- 9% vs. 18 +/- 10% of the left ventricle, p = 0.0001) as was final defect size (30 +/- 20% vs. 9 +/- 8%, p less than 0.01). The change in myocardial perfusion, an estimate of myocardial salvage, was also greater in patients with anterior infarction (24 +/- 16% vs. 10 +/- 7%, p less than 0.01). However, the proportion of jeopardized myocardium salvaged (salvage index) was not significantly different between patients with anterior or inferior infarction (0.49 +/- 0.34 vs. 0.59 +/- 0.35, p = NS). 
Comparative clinical trial of standard operative tracheostomy with percutaneous tracheostomy. OBJECTIVE: To compare percutaneous tracheostomy with conventional operative tracheostomy. DESIGN: Randomized clinical trial. SETTING: The medical and surgical critical care units of a large, tertiary-care, private hospital. PATIENTS: Twenty-five male and 21 female translaryngeally intubated patients with respiratory failure, in whom tracheostomy was indicated on clinical grounds, were randomly assigned to one of two groups. INTERVENTIONS: The 24 patients in group 1 underwent conventional operative tracheostomy, and the 22 patients in group 2 underwent percutaneous tracheostomy. One patient in group 2 required tracheostomy on three separate occasions during a prolonged hospital stay. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Patients were examined daily throughout their hospital stays for adverse events related to the tracheostomy. In all patients who survived until decannulation, plain tomography of the trachea was performed within 3 days of decannulation. Repeat physical and tomographic examinations were performed 6 and 12 wks later. Fifty-eight percent (14/24) of the operative tracheostomies were associated with at least one complication, compared with 25% (6/24) of the percutaneous tracheostomies (p less than .05, 95% confidence interval 7% to 59%). Predecannulation problems were more frequent in group 1 patients than in group 2 (46% vs. 13%, respectively; p less than .01, 95% confidence interval 9% to 57%), as were later sequelae (88% vs. 27%; p less than .05, confidence interval 26% to 96%) in survivors. Group 1 patients were more likely to have multiple complications, and their complications tended to be more serious. CONCLUSION: In this study, percutaneous tracheostomy appeared to be superior to the conventional operation. 
Generalized pustulation as a manifestation of the anticonvulsant hypersensitivity syndrome. BACKGROUND.-The anticonvulsant hypersensitivity syndrome is characterized by the development of fever, rash, lymphadenopathy, and hepatitis, and is associated with leukocytosis and eosinophilia. This article describes the unusual development of a follicular pustular eruption in two patients as a manifestation of this syndrome. OBSERVATIONS.-This pustular eruption most commonly develops on the face and scalp but may subsequently become generalized. While cultures of the pustules are negative, biopsy specimens reveal a dilated follicular infundibulum filled with neutrophils. Recognition of cutaneous pustulation as a potential manifestation of this syndrome is important, as a generalized pustular eruption developing in a febrile patient can easily be confused with an infectious process. CONCLUSIONS.-The anticonvulsant hypersensitivity syndrome may present with a follicular pustular eruption rather than the more commonly associated macular or papular rash or erythroderma. The three most commonly used anticonvulsants, phenytoin, phenobarbital, and carbamazepine, can each produce an identical hypersensitivity reaction. In addition, in vitro testing has demonstrated that approximately 80% of patients tested to all three medications had positive reactions to each. Furthermore, with in vitro testing researchers are able to predict which anticonvulsants are safe to use, thereby allowing for prospective individualization of therapy. However, this technology is not yet available for widespread use. 
Solid and cystic pancreatic tumors. Clinical, histochemical, and electron microscopic features in ten cases. Ten cases of the rare solid and cystic pancreatic tumors are presented. All except one occurred in young women (mean age, 25 +/- 9.2 years). The large neoplasms were evenly distributed across the pancreas; in one case, metastasis occurred; all other cases were free from disease after complete resection. Histologic hallmarks of solid and cystic neoplasms were papillary growth, large intracytoplasmic granules, and immunoreactivity with alpha 1-antitrypsin, alpha 1-antichymotrypsin, phospholipase A2, and neuroendocrine markers (neuron-specific enolase [NSE], synaptophysin). This suggests both endocrine as well as exocrine differentiation. 
Transesophageal echocardiography. Preliminary results in patients with traumatic aortic rupture. Eleven patients with blunt chest trauma at risk for traumatic aortic rupture underwent transesophageal echocardiography to image the descending aorta. Diagnoses were compared with the results of radiographic studies. Ten of the 11 patients underwent arch aortography, with positive results in six cases. In one patient, the results of a computed tomographic scan were interpreted as consistent with aortic rupture. The results of transesophageal echocardiography were positive for ruptured descending aorta in three of six patients with positive aortographic findings, and negative in eight patients. All three patients with positive findings had the diagnosis of ruptured descending aorta confirmed at surgery. The remaining eight patients demonstrated no aortic morbidity. These preliminary findings suggest that transesophageal echocardiography is a useful technique for the diagnosis of ruptured descending aorta following blunt chest trauma. 
Allergic fungal sinusitis: problems in diagnosis and treatment. Although first described in 1983, allergic Aspergillus sinusitis (AAS) has yet to gain wide recognition among otolaryngologists and pathologists. We have treated three patients with a history of asthma, nasal polyposis, and recurrent pansinusitis who fit the description of allergic Aspergillus sinusitis. Histopathologically, mucinous material with abundant eosinophils and Charcot-Leyden crystals ("allergic mucin") is interspersed with fungal hyphae. Immunologic characteristics include serum total immunoglobulin E (IgE) elevation, increased RAST classes, and cutaneous reactivity to molds. A retrospective analysis of the histopathology of 82 patients with chronic sinusitis was also undertaken. Eleven additional patients with classic allergic mucin were identified, but were found to be without evidence of fungal elements. The clinical features of all 14 patients are reviewed revealing the spectrum of disease. The difficulties of diagnosis and a therapeutic protocol which includes wide local debridement and postoperative use of systemic steroids are discussed. 
The use of albumin in clinical practice. The use of albumin in the clinical setting continues to generate controversy. Periodic shortages and the high cost of albumin have compelled many hospitals to develop guidelines regarding albumin administration. Our purpose is to review the human studies involving albumin. Particular emphasis will be placed on comparative trials involving albumin and the less expensive crystalloid solutions. It is hoped that this review will assist the clinician in making judgements concerning the appropriate use of albumin. 
Intraoperative monitoring of facial nerve function in cerebellopontine angle surgery. Facial nerve paralysis associated with cerebellopontine angle surgery has been reported to range up to 26% in a recent series. Various methods of intraoperatively monitoring the facial nerve have been developed to reduce the incidence of facial paralysis. We report our experience with an intraoperative monitoring technique using intramuscular EMG electrodes to detect subclinical electrical responses that were amplified and made audible to the operating surgeon after gating stimulus artifacts. A 3.6% incidence of facial paralysis in 111 consecutive cases with this intraoperative monitoring method compared with 14.5% in 207 previously unmonitored cases indicates significant reduction of this complication in cerebellopontine angle surgery (p less than 0.001). Along with this reduction in facial paralysis, an increase in the percentage of partial facial paresis was observed in the monitored group (p less than 0.05). The percentage of those with intact facial function was similar in the monitored (82.0%) and unmonitored groups (78.3%). 
Surgical management of the conal (supracristal) ventricular septal defect. Surgical management of the conal (supracristal) ventricular septal defect differs significantly from the management of the perimembranous (infracristal) ventricular septal defect. The absence of a portion of the conal septum can lead to prolapse of the right cusp of the aortic valve, which predisposes these patients to aortic insufficiency. Between January 1980 and December 1989, 36 children with conal ventricular septal defect underwent intracardiac repair. Diagnosis was by echocardiography, cardiac catheterization, and intraoperative exploration. Preoperative evaluation showed that 26 patients (72%) had aortic valve prolapse and 16 (44%) had aortic insufficiency. Pulmonary-to-systemic flow ratios ranged from 1:1 to 3.5:1 (mean 2.0:1.0). Ten patients (27%) were believed to have clinical congestive heart failure. Age at the time of operation ranged from 2 weeks to 18 years (mean 5.5 years). Operative exposure was through the pulmonary artery (26), aorta (4), right ventricle (3), or right atrium (3). Simultaneous aortic valve suspension for aortic insufficiency was performed in four patients. Operative survival was 100%. Follow-up is complete in all patients and ranges from 0.5 to 9 years (mean 4.3 years). All patients are in normal sinus rhythm. No residual ventricular septal defects have been identified. Twenty-three of 36 patients (64%) have no evidence of aortic insufficiency; 12 of 36 (33%) have trivial or mild aortic insufficiency. One patient with initial severe aortic insufficiency underwent repeat aortic valvuloplasty 3 years after ventricular septal defect closure and aortic valve suspension. No patients have required aortic valve replacement. Surgical management of the conal ventricular septal defect differs from that of the perimembranous ventricular septal defect in two critical aspects. The operative approach should be through the pulmonary artery. This allows the best exposure of the remaining conal septum and the pulmonary and aortic valve leaflets, facilitating closure of the defect without injury to the valves or conduction system. Conal ventricular septal defects should undergo early closure, regardless of shunt volume, to prevent progressive aortic insufficiency. 
Characteristics and outcomes of hospitalized older patients who develop hypocholesterolemia. OBJECTIVES: This research project was undertaken to determine the clinical characteristics, lipoprotein abnormalities, and outcomes of older hospitalized patients who develop hypocholesterolemia. METHODS: The project had two parts: (1) a retrospective, case-control study of 50 hospitalized patients greater than or equal to 65 years old whose serum cholesterol was normal on admission (greater than or equal to 160 mg/dL) and fell to less than or equal to 120 mg/dL during hospitalization; (2) a laboratory study of lipoproteins in 17 hospitalized patients greater than or equal to 65 years old whose cholesterol was normal on admission but fell to less than or equal to 120 mg/dL during hospitalization. RESULTS: Case-control Study--Nine percent of patients greater than or equal to 65 years old developed hypocholesterolemia while in the hospital, and these patients were more likely than controls to have undergone surgery and to have nothing by mouth for 5 days or longer. Cases had a longer length of stay, more complications, and were slightly more likely to die in the hospital than controls. LABORATORY STUDY--Hypocholesterolemic patients had low concentrations of all lipoproteins (VLDL, LDL, HDL), and the LDL and HDL were enriched in triglyceride and depleted of cholesterol ester. CONCLUSION: Acquired hypocholesterolemia is a common finding in hospitalized older patients and is associated with poor outcomes. Patients who became hypocholesterolemic in the hospital had both a low concentration of lipoprotein particles and abnormalities in lipoprotein particle composition. 
Clinical correlates of abnormal sensitivity to intraesophageal balloon distension. Sixty-five patients with esophageal complaints were studied to determine clinical associations with abnormal sensitivity to intraesophageal balloon distension (esophageal sensory dysfunction). Associations were examined in four categories: motility, esophageal symptoms, recent psychological symptoms, and general clinical features. A positive response to balloon distension (pain with less than or equal to 8 ml volume) was found in 29 (45%) of the subjects. This response was associated with specific findings in each category except recent psychological symptoms. A multiple logistic regression analysis indicated that an increased frequency of multipeaked waves on motility testing, presence of dysphagia, and shorter height of the subject each had an independent association with positive response to balloon distension (P less than or equal to 0.05 for each). Further comparison of subjects with sensory dysfunction, motor dysfunction, or both (sensorimotor dysfunction) indicated that subjects with the combined disorder appeared more symptomatic than those with either finding alone. These observations indicate that: (1) esophageal motor and sensory dysfunction are partially associated, but both contribute to the symptomatic state; (2) dysphagia may be representative of sensory dysfunction in some cases; and (3) subject height should be taken into consideration when interpreting balloon distension results. 
Rate and incidence of capsular contracture: a comparison of smooth and textured silicone double-lumen breast prostheses. Capsular contracture results in dissatisfaction and deformity among the 2 million women who have had silicone implants. The literature describes contracture rates as high as 74 percent. I present a comparison of rates and incidences of contracture in patients augmented with smooth and textured double-lumen silicone implants. A total of 165 "smooth" and 63 "textured" implant patients were included in this study, which spans 12 years, 1978-1990. All patients underwent bilateral aesthetic augmentation performed by the same surgeon. Of the 165 smooth implant patients, 74 (44.8 percent) experienced contractures requiring treatment. Of the 63 textured implant patients, 3 (4.8 percent) previous contracture patients experienced sudden fibrosis within 3 months. All others remained soft. It appears that deeply textured silicone surfaces delay or decrease the rate and incidence of clinical capsular contracture, at least for 2 years. 
Effects of enoximone on exercise tolerance in patients with mild to moderate heart failure. To evaluate the efficacy of enoximone on exercise tolerance in patients with mild to moderate heart failure, 33 patients underwent cardiopulmonary exercise tests before and 3 hours after placebo or after receiving 25 or 100 mg of enoximone administered randomly in a double-blind manner. The electrocardiogram was monitored and blood pressure measured every minute throughout cycle ergometer exercise testing with a ramp protocol in which the work rate increased 1 W every 6 seconds after a 4-minute 20-W warm-up. Minute ventilation, oxygen uptake (VO2), and carbon dioxide output were measured every 10 seconds in order to determine anaerobic threshold (AT) and peak VO2. Five patients were excluded from evaluation before breaking the double-blind key because of insufficient data. Heart rate increased and systolic blood pressure decreased throughout the testing only in the group taking 100 mg (n = 10). Significant increases in AT (14.4 to 16.2 ml/min/kg) and peak VO2 (20.8 to 22.9 ml/min/kg) were observed in the group taking 100 mg. The increases in AT showed a dose response, namely +0.7% in the placebo (n = 9), +6.9% in the 25-mg (n = 9) and 12.5% in the 100-mg group. The work rates at the AT point increased in the 25- and 100-mg groups. These results indicate that a single oral administration of enoximone improves exercise tolerance in patients with mild to moderate heart failure. 
Leg paresthesias induced by magnetic brain stimulation in patients with thoracic spinal cord injury. We studied the induction of leg paresthesias by magnetic stimulation of the brain in seven patients with thoracic T9-12 spinal cord injury and in four normal volunteers by delivering transcranial magnetic stimulation over scalp positions 1 cm apart with a Cadwell MES-10 magnetic stimulator and an 8-shaped magnetic coil at 100% stimulus intensity. We asked subjects to report sensations felt after each stimulus. In all normal subjects, magnetic stimulation evoked sensations described as tingling or a wave descending along the leg, usually accompanied by EMG responses in leg muscles. In three of the seven patients, stimulation evoked sensations of tingling, numbness, touch, or a wave descending along the leg, lasting up to 10 seconds and referred to different parts of the legs and toes. In the patients, sensations were felt more distally the closer the site of stimulation was to the midline. Patients with leg paresthesias had less motor reorganization in abdominal muscles than those without paresthesias. These findings suggest that portions of the cortical representation areas for body parts deafferented by a complete spinal cord injury can remain related to those body parts for up to several years. A central origin of these paresthesias is probable. 
Monoclonal anti-T cell (T12) antibody treatment of graft-versus-host disease in severe combined immunodeficiency: targeting of antibody and activation of complement on CD8+ cytotoxic T cell surfaces. We report a 6-month-old male child with severe combined immunodeficiency who received an unirradiated blood transfusion and developed acute, severe graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), for which he received monoclonal anti-T cell (anti-T12) antibody treatment. The GVHD was manifested by a confluent maculopapular rash and increased liver function tests and was documented by skin biopsy. Separation of peripheral blood mononuclear cells forming rosettes with sheep red blood cells revealed engrafted T cells having the nonrelated HLA type of the blood donor. The patient was treated with intravenous monoclonal anti-T12 in a dose of 0.3 mg/kg/day for 5 days. An in vivo effect of the anti-T12 was suggested by clinical improvement of his skin rash and return of the liver transaminases to the normal range. Moreover, human complement components, activated C3 and C4, were detected by fluorescence microscopy on the surfaces of the engrafted CD8+ lymphocytes on the skin biopsy specimens. Also, with a biotin-avadin assay, the presence of the anti-T12 was detected on these same cells. These studies document not only the in vivo targeting of monoclonal anti-T12 antibody to cytotoxic T cells producing GVHD but also the activation of complement on these cells. 
Pachymeningitis associated with a pulmonary nodule. The authors report a case of hypertrophic pachymeningitis, a rare cause of spinal cord compression. In this patient, dural inflammation was associated with a histologically identical pulmonary lesion. Such an association has not been described previously and supports the hypothesis that this disease is related to other connective tissue disorders. 
Neuropsychiatric side effects after the use of mefloquine. This study describes neuropsychiatric side effects in patients after treatment with mefloquine. Reactions consisted mainly of seizures, acute psychoses, anxiety neurosis, and major disturbances of sleep-wake rhythm. Side effects occurred after both therapeutic and prophylactic intake and were graded from moderate to severe. In a risk analysis of neuropsychiatric side effects in Germany, it is estimated that one of 8,000 mefloquine users suffers from such reactions. The incidence calculation revealed that one of 215 therapeutic users had reactions, compared with one of 13,000 in the prophylaxis group, making the risk of neuropsychiatric reactions after mefloquine treatment 60 times higher than after prophylaxis. Therefore, certain limitations for malaria prophylaxis and treatment with mefloquine are recommended. 
Recurrent severe traumatic brain injury. Series of six cases. Six of 141 persons treated for severe traumatic brain injury at the Medical College of Virginia were found to have a history of similar previous injury. These cases are presented in the context of the phenomenon of recurrent severe traumatic brain injury, which has received no systematic attention in epidemiologic studies of trauma. 
Paravermal infarct and isolated cerebellar dysarthria. A patient with isolated cerebellar dysarthria is reported. Computed tomography showed a small infarct in the left paravermal zone of the rostal cerebellum (lobulus simplex and semilunaris superior) in the territory of the medial branch of the superior cerebellar artery. This patient demonstrates the important role of this area of cerebellum in the control of voice. 
Muscle mitochondrial DNA in encephalomyopathy and ragged red fibres: a Southern blot analysis and literature review. Various mitochondrial DNA abnormalities have been described in patients with encephalomyopathies. We performed Southern blot analysis of skeletal muscle mitochondrial DNA in nine adult patients with clinical features and ragged red fibres suggesting mitochondrial dysfunction. Two patients with encephalomyopathy and two with the MERRF syndrome (myoclonus epilepsy with ragged red fibres) had the normal PvuII restriction pattern of muscle mitochondrial DNA. In contrast, mitochondrial DNA deletion was observed in two of six patients with ophthalmoplegia. One suffered from typical Kearns-Sayre syndrome and the other from isolated external ophthalmoplegia. None of these patients had affected relatives. The detection of mitochondrial DNA deletion in external ophthalmoplegia and their site and size support previously reported data. 
Results of surgery for duodenal ulcer: assessment by patients. A questionnaire was administered to 224 patients who had undergone 246 operations for duodenal ulcer to see how well this correlated with Visick grading and to provide insight into the patients' feelings about the results of their surgery. The patients were divided into three groups by Visick grade: good (grade I, n = 70), satisfactory (grades II and IIIs, n = 104) and poor (grades IIIu and IV, n = 72). The distribution of questionnaire responses in each group was statistically different (P less than 0.01). Dividing the questionnaire responses into three corresponding groups, 72 per cent of patients assigned themselves to the same group as their Visick grade. Three observations were made regarding the Visick system: recurrent ulceration is over-scored and should be included only if symptomatic; grading should acknowledge a wider range of symptoms related to ulcer disease and its treatment; only three grades are necessary. 
Decreased plasticity of glucoregulatory responses in aged rats: effects of chronic stress. These experiments were conducted to determine the effects of age and chronic stress on the ability of rats to attenuate stimulus-induced glucose and insulin responses during repeated exposure to a mild stressor. Young (5-month) and old (21-month) Fischer 344 male rats were either exposed to intermittent sessions of an escapable footshock stress for 3 months, or to no chronic stress. Afterwards, blood samples were obtained from each rat before, during, and after the first and fourth exposure to a novel motion stimulus. Between the first and the fourth exposure to the motion stimulus a pronounced attenuation of glucose and insulin responses was seen in both groups of young rats, and in old chronically stressed rats, but not in old control animals. Thus, it appears that the adverse effects of aging on plasticity of glucoregulatory response processes were significantly diminished by exposure of the animals to periodic challenges from their external environment. 
Lyme neuroborreliosis: a new sensitive diagnostic assay for intrathecal synthesis of Borrelia burgdorferi--specific immunoglobulin G, A, and M. An antibody capture enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay was developed to measure directly intrathecal immunoglobulin (Ig) G, A, and M synthesis specific for Borrelia burgdorferi. Purified, biotin-avidin-peroxidase-labeled B. burgdorferi flagella was used as test antigen. Paired cerebrospinal fluid and serum specimens from 100 patients with clinically definite neuroborreliosis and 35 control subjects with neurological diseases were examined. Significant B. burgdorferi-specific intrathecal IgG, A, and M production was found in 89%, 65% and 67% of patients with neuroborreliosis. Local synthesis of specific IgA was only seen in patients with significant local IgG synthesis. Antibody production in cerebrospinal fluid began by 2 weeks after onset of neurological symptoms. At the end of the second week specific IgM, IgG, or both, was detected in 88% of the patients. Specific IgG synthesis was present in all patients by 6 weeks after onset. Specific local IgM synthesis usually disappeared by 3 to 6 months after therapy, whereas specific IgG synthesis persisted after recovery. Even in patients with a severely altered blood-brain barrier, the assay discriminated between intrathecal antibody synthesis and antibody leakage from serum. The assay makes diagnostic measurement of B. burgdorferi-specific intrathecal antibody synthesis reliable, rapid, and accessible as a routine serological test. 
Dynamic acquisition with a three-headed SPECT system: application to technetium 99m-SQ30217 myocardial imaging. A method for SPECT data acquisition, "continuous repetitive rotation acquisition," was developed with a high-sensitivity three-headed SPECT system. The method was applied to the dynamic imaging of 99mTc-SQ30217, a new myocardial imaging agent. After acquisition and reconstruction of SPECT data every minute, projection images at arbitrary intervals were used for tomographic reconstruction to determine the best timing of SPECT imaging in 99mTc-SQ30217. Based on a comparison of several possible acquisition intervals, SPECT data acquisition within 9 min after injection is recommended because of high myocardial uptake (myocardium-to-lung ratio, 2.83 +/- 0.42 (mean +/- s.e.m.) at 3-6 min) and relatively low hepatic uptake (myocardium-to-liver ratio, 0.85 +/- 0.13 at 3-6 min). The rate constant of the clearance of 99mTc-SQ30217 from the myocardium obtained by SPECT was: k1 = 0.249 +/- 0.050 per min (average half-life = 2.8 min) and k2 = 0.012 +/- 0.004/min (average half-life = 58 min). The continuous repetitive rotation acquisition SPECT study appears useful for imaging SQ30217 with its rapidly changing myocardial distribution. 
Acute illness in maple syrup urine disease: dynamics of protein metabolism and implications for management. Acute metabolic decompensation in maple syrup urine disease (MSUD) during otherwise minor illnesses has generally been presumed to result from massive release of leucine from protein catabolism. A stable isotope method based on the continuous infusion of (2H5)phenylalanine was used to measure protein metabolism in vivo in two children with MSUD during acute illness and when well. Net protein catabolism was greater in the unwell state (0.51 and 0.40 gm/kg per 24 hours in each child, respectively) than in the basal state (0.34 and 0.32). This rate of release of leucine from protein is compatible only with a slow (several days) rather than a dramatic rise in plasma leucine levels during acute illness in MSUD. Poor oral intake leading to a relative increase in time spent in the fasting state appears to be a more important determinant of increasing leucine levels than the catabolic effect of infection in itself. These factors suggested that branched-chain amino acid restriction should be commenced at the start of minor illness in children with MSUD, and that intake of other nutrients should be maintained or increased throughout the illness. A regimen based on these concepts was used during nine episodes of minor illness in two children with MSUD. Plasma branched-chain amino acid levels remained acceptable (less than 700 mumol/L) throughout each of these episodes. Dietary supplementation of this type may reduce the risk of metabolic decompensation during acute illnesses in children with MSUD. 
Unrecognized stenosis by angiography documented by intravascular ultrasound imaging. This report documents how intravascular ultrasound imaging was used to diagnose a short "napkin-ring" stenosis that was missed by coronary angiography. Intravascular ultrasound revealed a lumen of 2.6 x 2.5 mm in diameter and 5.0 mm2 in cross-sectional area, with a residual atheroma that occluded 63% of available cross-sectional area at the stenosis. 
Failure of dithiothreitol and pronase to reveal a false-positive cryptococcal antigen determination in cerebrospinal fluid. A patient with squamous cell carcinoma of the lung and a serum rheumatoid factor (RF) of 1:1,280 had a positive cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) latex agglutination test (LAT) for cryptococcal antigen, in culture-negative, India-ink-negative CSF. Pretreatment of the sample of CSF with 2-mercaptoethanol (2-ME) ablated the antigen titer and established the presence of a false-positive LAT, whereas CSF pretreated with dithiothreitol (DTT) and pronase continued to yield a false-positive result. The differing ability of pronase, DTT, and 2-ME to eliminate interfering substances from CSF has not been previously described. Moreover, because RF is unlikely to cross the blood-brain barrier, the authors postulated that malignant disease was responsible for the patient's false-positive LAT in CSF. Hence, the authors report the case to emphasize that false-positive LAT results in CSF are unlikely to be produced by RF and to underscore the benefit of using enzymatic and sulfhydryl-reducing agents when the validity of the initial test results are in doubt. Such a procedure will optimize the chances of accurately identifying false-positive LAT results in CSF. 
Poliomyelitis-like paralysis during recovery from acute bronchial asthma: possible etiology and risk factors. A poliomyelitis-like paralytic disease during recovery from an attack of bronchial asthma is described in two young children. They presented at the age of 13 and 22 months, respectively, with acute flaccid paralysis of one or both lower limbs and preserved sensation. Cerebrospinal fluid examinations revealed mild protein elevation in both and pleocytosis in the second infant. Enteroviruses were isolated in a nasal swab and stools of the second patient. Acute onset of flaccid paralysis with absent motor action potential and normal sensory responses, detected by electrophysiologic studies, are highly suggestive of motor anterior horn cell disease in these infants. A multifactorial setup of immune suppression, stress, and neurotoxic drugs during an acute bronchial asthma attack triggered by a viral disease may render the patient vulnerable to viral invasion of the anterior horn cell with enteroviruses other than poliovirus. The overall experience of 22 patients with this serious complication is reviewed. 
Do otolaryngologist-head and neck surgeons and/or chemotherapy have a role in the treatment of head and neck cancer? We provide an update on the current status of chemotherapy in the treatment of head and neck cancer. The role of the otolaryngology--head and neck surgeon in this important clinical research is underscored. Those involved with treating patients with head and neck cancer must understand the mechanisms of clinical cancer research. Physicians in academic and community settings can be intimately involved in this treatment. 
Management of temporal bone carcinomas: a therapeutic analysis of two groups of patients and long-term followup. Fifty-one patients with squamous cell carcinomas arising within the temporal bone were subdivided into two groups. The initial group of 17 patients, seen between 1960 and 1980, were reviewed retrospectively and staged into four subgroups on the basis of initial tumor presentation and location (i.e., external auditory canal, superficial invasion, deep invasion, and tumors beyond the temporal bone). After treatment in a variety of surgical and radiotherapeutic combinations, the 5-year cure rates were: 70%, 70%, 50%, and 9%, respectively. Thirty-four patients, seen between 1980 and 1989, were placed in a new prospective protocol for combined surgery and postoperative irradiation. These patients were subdivided into the same subgroups on the basis of tumor location. The surgical procedures were formalized to be more encompassing (i.e., external canal tumors were treated by sleeve resection of the internal auditory canal and tympanic membrane, superficial invasion by superficial temporal bone resection, deep tumors by radical temporal bone resection, and those beyond the temporal bone by an infratemporal fossa approach). Radical neck dissections were performed where needed. The irradiation dosage was increased to 6250+ cGy, with a 4:1 ratio in favor of electrons for deeper penetration, and the fields were widened. At 36.6-month average followup, the cure rates were: 100%, 100%, 70%, and 65%, respectively. Six of ten patients with neck metastases at presentation had tumor recurrence or distant disease (60%). 
Modulation of splanchnic vascular sensitivity to angiotensin II. We studied whether the diminished splanchnic vascular response to angiotensin II infusion in portal hypertension could be related to elevated levels of prostacyclin (PGI2). The changes in superior mesenteric artery resistance (RSMA) and systemic vascular resistance (RSYS) during angiotensin II infusion were measured by Doppler flow probe in normal rabbits (NL) and portal hypertensive rabbits (PHT), and in NL and PHT after cyclooxygenase blockade (CO) and after CO and during continuous PGI2 infusion at 300 ng/kg/min. Angiotensin II infusion in NL caused a disproportionately greater increase in RSMA than in RSYS (p less than 0.01). In PHT, angiotensin II response of RSMA was reduced from NL (p less than 0.05). CO dramatically improved the splanchnic response to angiotensin II in PHT animals, but did not significantly alter the RSMA response in NL. PGI2 in NL, NL + CO, and PHT + CO quantitatively established the splanchnic vascular hyporesponsiveness to angiotensin II seen in PHT. We conclude that PGI2 will directly diminish splanchnic response to angiotensin II in NL, and CO will ablate differences in splanchnic response between NL and PHT to angiotensin II. This strongly implies that much of the observed decrease in angiotensin II response in PHT is mediated by PGI2 and that the differences between NL and PHT vascular response is in part the result of circulating vasodilatory substances. 
Digitally-directed transrectal biopsy using Biopty gun versus transrectal needle aspiration: comparison of diagnostic yield and comfort. A technique for digitally-directed core biopsy using the Biopty device and prospective comparison of accuracy and comfort, using this technique simultaneously with transrectal needle aspiration, are presented. To better estimate the true prevalence of carcinoma in the study population, a repeat combined procedure was performed on all subjects who did not have carcinoma confirmed on the initial core biopsies. All procedures were done by one investigator and all pathology reviewed by one senior pathologist. A total of 180 combined procedures were performed on 100 consecutive patients with palpably abnormal prostates; 30 carcinomas were detected. Digitally-directed Biopty biopsy yielded a sensitivity rate of 87 percent compared with 57 percent for needle aspiration (p less than 0.05). Using a numerical comfort scale, the Biopty device was also rated less painful than needle aspiration (p = 0.0001). The morbidity of the combined procedure was minimal, with a minor complication rate of 2.2 percent. No infections occurred. 
Left ventricular myocardial edema. Lymph flow, interstitial fibrosis, and cardiac function. We hypothesized that both acute and chronic accumulation of myocardial interstitial edema (extravascular fluid [EVF]) would compromise cardiac function. We also postulated that excess fluid within the myocardial interstitial space would potentiate interstitial fibrosis, thus further compromising function. Dogs were divided into three groups: 1) control, 2) chronic pulmonary hypertensive with right heart failure, and 3) chronic arterial hypertensive. The quantity of EVF, expressed as the unitless blood-free (wet weight-dry weight)/dry weight ratio, and interstitial fibrosis (collagen content) were determined and correlated with cardiac function at baseline and after acute elevation of coronary venous pressure and reduction of cardiac lymph flow. Control EVF was 2.90 +/- 0.20 (mean +/- SD), which increased to 3.45 +/- 0.16 after acute (3-hour) elevation of coronary sinus pressure. This EVF significantly compromised cardiac function. The EVF in chronically hypertensive dogs and in dogs with chronic right heart pressure elevations was 3.50 +/- 0.30 and 3.50 +/- 0.08, respectively. End-diastolic left ventricular interstitial fluid pressure increased from a control value of 14.9 +/- 3.1 (at EVF = 2.9) to 24.8 +/- 3.7 (at EVF = 3.5). An EVF of 3.5 produced approximately 30% reduction of the heart's ability to maintain cardiac output at a left atrial pressure of 15 mm Hg. The compromised function in these chronic models is exacerbated after acute elevation of coronary venous pressure and reduction of cardiac lymph flow. Collagen levels were elevated by at least 20% in the chronic hypertensive dogs and in the nonhypertrophied left ventricles of dogs with chronic right heart pressure elevation. 
Computed tomographic scan confirmation of paraprosthetic enteric fistula. Aortoenteric anastomotic fistulae and paraprosthetic graft infections are rare but devastating complications following aortic graft surgery. Although the incidence of these complications is reported to be less than 2%, the difficulty in diagnosis and management has led to high mortality rates and extensive morbidity. The majority of patients present with either groin infection or significant gastrointestinal tract bleeding. There is, however, a subset of patients with nonspecific clinical findings in whom routine studies are not diagnostic. Computed tomography was a useful adjunct to the diagnosis of retroperitoneal infection in these patients by demonstrating small collections of periaortic gas or "black dots." The presence of periaortic gas in each instance proved to be a specific sign of a paraprosthetic-enteric fistula, as opposed to a graft infection without intestinal communication. 
Cardiac resuscitation by extracorporeal circulation after failure of conventional CPR. After cardiac arrest, return of cardiac function and effective circulation are contingent on prompt restoration of myocardial blood flow. Because conventional closed-chest CPR has limited hemodynamic efficiency, we investigated venoarterial ECC utilizing peripheral vascular access as an alternative for cardiac resuscitation. Ventricular fibrillation was induced in domestic pigs by alternating current delivered to the endocardium of the right ventricle. Conventional closed-chest CPR was begun after 10 minutes. In each instance, precordial compression and external defibrillation failed to restore a viable rhythm. ECC was begun at 15 minutes at an average flow rate of 183 ml/kg/min. In each of eight animals, sinus rhythm was restored. In six of these eight animals, spontaneous circulation was reestablished after an average interval of 152 minutes. When epinephrine was administered concomitantly with ECC in an additional eight animals so as to maintain mean aortic pressure between 60 and 100 mm Hg, sinus rhythm and spontaneous circulation were reestablished in each pig after an average of only 23 minutes. The effects of ECC in conjunction with epinephrine were then compared with those of conventional precordial compression in conjunction with epinephrine (sham ECC). In contrast to ECC, which successfully resuscitated each of five animals, none of five sham ECC-treated animals was resuscitated by continued precordial compression and maximal doses of epinephrine (p less than 0.01). We conclude that ECC in conjunction with epinephrine emerges as a highly effective experimental intervention for resuscitation when conventional techniques of precordial compression and external defibrillation fail to reverse cardiac arrest. 
Hypertrophy of clitoral hood: presenting sign of neurofibromatosis in female child. Although clitoral involvement with neurofibromatosis is rare, all cases previously reported have described clitoral hypertrophy due to neurofibromas of the clitoral corpora. We report on a patient who had localized enlargement of the prepuce only, with no evidence of neurofibromatous infiltration. In all cases, diagnosis of clitoromegaly requires basic chromosomal and endocrinologic evaluation. However, recognition of its association with neurofibromatosis due to either neurofibromas of the genitalia or localized genital hypertrophy may spare the patient an unnecessary or invasive evaluation. Because of an association with urinary tract neurofibromas, the patient with genital involvement should have cystoscopy. Clitoroplasty with sparing of the neurovascular bundle and glans is the preferred method of management of the enlarged clitoris. 
Development of a stable Leishmania expression vector and application to the study of parasite surface antigen genes. Trypanosomatid protozoan parasites cause several important tropical diseases and have been a fertile ground for the discovery of molecular paradigms such as trans-splicing and RNA editing. Transfection-based methods for the study of these organisms have recently been developed, and we have now designed an expression vector, pX, which contains only 2.3 kilobases of Leishmania DNA and can be stably transfected with high efficiency. Genes encoding Escherichia coli beta-galactosidase or a Leishmania amazonensis protective membrane glycoprotein (GP46A/M-2) were inserted into the pX expression site and transfected into Leishmania major, where they directed the synthesis of high levels of mRNAs formed by 5' and 3' processing events occurring predominantly at the sites used by the normal transcripts. Colony assays and immunoblot analysis showed that both proteins were produced; enzymatically active beta-galactosidase comprised approximately 1% of total protein. Sizes of the GP46A protein synthesized in transfected L. major or L. amazonensis were similar and differed from the predominant L. amazonensis GP46, suggesting that the GP46A gene may encode a variant GP46 family member. Because these vectors function efficiently in pathogenic species of Leishmania, pX will facilitate the genetic analyses of parasite proteins crucial for infectivity as well as the identification of cis-acting elements mediating transcription and replication. 
The effects of cyclobenzaprine on sleep physiology and symptoms in patients with fibromyalgia. A double blind, placebo controlled, crossover design study examined overnight sleep physiology, pain, fatigue, and mood symptoms in 12 patients with fibromyalgia treated with cyclobenzaprine. Nine patients completed the study. Patients receiving cyclobenzaprine showed a decrease in evening fatigue (F = 4.7, p less than 0.05) and an increase in total sleep time (F = 4.4, p less than 0.05). Pain, including tender point count and dolorimetry, mood ratings, and alpha non-REM EEG sleep anomaly were unchanged by cyclobenzaprine. 
Primary prevention of sudden cardiovascular death in hypertensive patients. Mortality results from the MAPHY Study. In a randomized primary prevention trial including 3,234 men with mild to moderate uncomplicated hypertension, the effect of the beta-blocker metoprolol or a thiazide diuretic as an initial antihypertensive therapy was compared regarding the risk of sudden cardiovascular death during a follow-up ranging from 2.3 to 10.8 years (median of 4.2 years). Only men aged 40 to 64 years were included in the study. The randomization of patients into the metoprolol (n = 1,609) or diuretic group (n = 1,625) was performed after stratification for age, smoking habits, serum cholesterol, and systolic blood pressure. At baseline the two treatment groups were well matched. Metoprolol was given in a mean dose of 174 mg daily and the mean dose of thiazide diuretic was either 46 mg hydrochlorothiazide daily or 4.4 mg bendroflumethiazide daily. Identical blood pressure control was achieved using the fixed therapeutic schedule. Total and cardiovascular mortality were significantly lower for metoprolol than for diuretics, owing to fewer deaths from coronary heart disease and stroke. Of the cardiovascular deaths, 78% were classified as sudden cardiovascular deaths (occurred within 24 h after the onset of symptoms). There were significantly fewer sudden cardiovascular deaths in the metoprolol group compared to the diuretic group (32 v 45, P = .017). The present results suggest that initial antihypertensive therapy with metoprolol is associated with a lesser incidence of sudden cardiovascular deaths than initial diuretic treatment in uncomplicated hypertension. 
Frequency of low serum high-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels in hospitalized patients with "desirable" total cholesterol levels. Because the National Cholesterol Education Program guidelines suggest that levels of total serum cholesterol less than 5.17 mmol/liter (200 mg/dl) are "desirable," we performed a retrospective observational analysis to determine the prevalence of coronary artery disease (CAD) in patients with total cholesterol less than 5.17 mmol/liter (200 mg/dl) and the prevalence of total cholesterol less than 5.17 mmol/liter (200 mg/dl) in patients with CAD by angiography. Cholesterol levels less than 5.17 mmol/liter (200 mg/dl) were found in 1,084 of 2,535 patients (42%) having cholesterol measured on hospital admission; 690 of these 1,084 (64%) had CAD. These patients were mostly men, had a family history of premature CAD, and 60% (414 of 690) had high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol less than 0.90 mmol/liter (35 mg/dl). In a separate group of patients defined from the same admission population but having angiographically established CAD, 32% (424 of 1,197) had a total cholesterol less than 5.17 mmol/liter (200 mg/dl), 59% of whom (252 of 424) had HDL less than 0.90 mmol/liter (35 mg/dl). An analysis of persons admitted electively for angiography (to exclude any effects of hospitalization per se on serum lipids) revealed a similar proportion of persons with total cholesterol less than 5.17 mmol/liter (200 mg/dl) (35%), CAD (82%), and HDL less than 0.90 mmol/liter (35 mg/dl). 
Is large loop excision of the transformation zone (LLETZ) more accurate than colposcopically directed punch biopsy in the diagnosis of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia? In 100 women with suspected cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) attending the colposcopy clinic the histological diagnoses made from excision biopsies taken by large loop excision of the transformation zone (LLETZ) were compared with those from colposcopically directed punch biopsies taken concurrently. One unsuspected microinvasive tumour was found and the diagnosis made by LLETZ was significantly worse than that made by punch biopsy in 24 cases (24%: 95% CI 15.6 to 32.4%). LLETZ improves the accuracy of diagnosis of CIN. 
Classifying calcaneal tendon injury according to MRI findings. Magnetic resonance imaging was performed on 28 patients with suspected calcaneal tendon injury prior to treatment. None of the patients were involved in competitive sports. All underwent clinical examination, some had had ultrasound or CT scans. We identified four types of lesions: type I, inflammatory reaction; type II, degenerative change; type III, incomplete rupture and type IV, complete rupture. Thirteen of the 28 patients underwent surgery and the diagnostic findings were verified. We recommend that type I, type II and type III lesions be managed conservatively, while type IV lesions should be operated in the young and active patient. 
Improved specificity of myocardial thallium-201 single-photon emission computed tomography in patients with left bundle branch block by dipyridamole. Reduced septal uptake of thallium-201 during exercise is frequently observed in patients with left bundle branch block (LBBB) and normal coronary arteries. This may reflect normal coronary autoregulation in response to lower septal oxygen demand; thus, dipyridamole, which uniformly exploits flow reserve, would be more accurate for diagnosis of coronary artery disease (CAD). Sixteen patients with LBBB underwent exercise and dipyridamole thallium-201 single-photon emission computed tomography and coronary angiography within 3 months. Sensitivity for detection of left anterior descending CAD (greater than 50% stenosis) was 0.83 for exercise and 1.00 for dipyridamole. Specificity was 0.30 (visual) or 0.20 (quantitative analysis) for exercise and 0.80 (visual) or 0.90 (quantitative) for dipyridamole (p less than 0.05). Dipyridamole combined with quantitative analysis also improved specificity of CAD detection overall (p less than 0.01). These data demonstrate that pharmacologic vasodilation is more accurate than exercise when diagnosing CAD by myocardial perfusion scintigraphy in patients with LBBB. 
Contribution of monocytes to the decreased lymphoproliferative response to phytohemagglutinin in patients with lung cancer. Patients with lung cancer (LC) have a reduced T-cell proliferative response to phytohemagglutinin (PHA) compared with that of healthy individuals. This decreased response is a result of an inhibitory effect exerted by the monocytes as evidenced by: (1) a restoration to normal levels of the response to PHA when the peripheral blood mononuclear cells were depleted of adherent cells (AD) and (2) a dose-dependent inhibition of the response to PHA when the nonadherent cell population was co-cultured with increasing numbers of autologous AD cells. The addition of indomethacin to the cultures resulted in only a partial restoration of the response to PHA. Monocyte production of interleukin-1 from patients with LC in response to lipopolysaccharide was normal. These findings support the hypothesis that the AD cell population plays a major role in the low T-cell proliferative response to PHA in patients with LC. This suppressor effect is partially mediated by the prostaglandins released by the monocytes. 
Coronary venous retroinfusion of deferoxamine reduces infarct size in pigs. The efficacy of coronary venous retroinfusion of the iron chelator deferoxamine was studied in 24 pentobarbital-anesthetized open chest pigs with a 60 min occlusion of the left anterior descending coronary artery followed by 3 h of reperfusion. Eight retrogradely treated pigs were given 10 mg/kg body weight of deferoxamine by way of the anterior interventricular vein and eight systemically treated pigs received the same doses of deferoxamine intravenously. Drug infusions lasted for 5 min, beginning 15 min before reperfusion. Eight control pigs received systemic intravenous saline solution. Myocardial area at risk and necrotic area were assessed by the monastral blue dye and the triphenyltetrazolium chloride staining method, respectively. There were no significant differences in hemodynamics or regional myocardial function (sonomicrometry) among the groups. Infarct size expressed as percent of risk area was 73.9 +/- 13.5% in the control group, 70.6 +/- 16.4% in the systemically treated group and 48.5 +/- 21.4% (p less than 0.05) in the retrogradely treated group. In conclusion, deferoxamine significantly reduced infarct size after coronary occlusion only when given regionally by way of the coronary vein. Because there was no significant hemodynamic effect caused by deferoxamine infusion, it is suggested that this drug prevents postischemic reperfusion injury by a direct cardioprotective effect. 
Diseases that mimic multiple sclerosis. Because no one laboratory test is diagnostic of multiple sclerosis, evaluation involves careful exclusion of other possible diagnoses. Magnetic resonance imaging is a valuable tool in this process. Clues from a scan can confirm findings from the history and physical and laboratory examinations. Dr Scott compares typical findings of multiple sclerosis with those of the four diseases that are sometimes mistaken for this syndrome. 
A prefecture-wide survey of mumps meningitis associated with measles, mumps and rubella vaccine. A survey of untoward reactions, especially central nervous system reactions, after the administration of a newly introduced measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) vaccine in Gunma Prefecture, Japan, was initiated soon after 4 patients were hospitalized for aseptic meningitis. Thirty-five, 6 and 2 children developed meningitis, convulsive disorders and parotitis, respectively, within 2 months after MMR vaccination during the 8-month period extending from April to November, 1989. The time lag between MMR vaccination and meningitis ranged from 14 to 28 days in the 35 cases of meningitis. Mumps virus, isolated from the cerebrospinal fluid in 13 patients with aseptic meningitis, was characterized by determination of the nucleotide sequences of the P gene as mumps vaccine strain. The incidence of aseptic meningitis with positive mumps vaccine virus was estimated to be 0.11% (0.3% as a whole) during the 8 months from April to November and increased to 0.3% (0.7% as a whole) in September and October. We conclude that the incidence of aseptic meningitis after MMR vaccination seems to be higher than that reported previously. 
Simultaneous ipsilateral vasal and epididymal reconstruction. Injuries to the spermatic cords, sustained during childhood inguinal hernioplasty, caused unilateral testicular atrophy, multiple bilateral excurrent duct obstruction and aspermia. Simultaneous unilateral vasal reconstruction and vaso-epididymostomy resulted in satisfactory semen parameters. It is expected that vasal integrity will be maintained after multiple reconstructive procedures at different locations if further injury to the vascular supply of the excurrent duct is avoided. 
Acquired immunodeficiency syndrome in Romania. After the initial description of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) in Romania in late 1989, national AIDS case surveillance was established with a modified version of the World Health Organisation (WHO) clinical case definition. This modified case definition requires that AIDS cases have both clinical and serological evidence of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. Before December, 1989, Romania had reported 13 AIDS cases to WHO. By Dec 31, 1990, 1168 AIDS cases were reported to Romania's Ministry of Health, of which 1094 (93.7%) occurred in children less than 13 years of age at diagnosis. Of these, 1086 (99.3%) were in infants and children less than 4 years of age, and 683 (62.4%) in abandoned children living in public institutions at the time of diagnosis. By Dec 31, 1990, 493 (45.1%) mothers of children with AIDS had been located and tested, and 37 (7.5%) were positive for HIV; 423 (38.7%) cases were in children who had received transfusions of unscreened blood, and 6 (0.5%) were in children with clotting disorders. HIV transmission through the improper use of needles and syringes is strongly suspected in most of the remaining 628 (57.4%) children with AIDS, most of whom had received multiple therapeutic injections. This outbreak demonstrates the serious potential for HIV transmission in medical facilities that intensively and improperly use parenteral therapy and have poor sterilisation technique. 
Physical training and antiplatelet treatment in stage II peripheral arterial occlusive disease: alone or combined? The efficacy of physical training alone or combined with antiplatelet therapy (dipyridamole and aspirin) was studied in 30 patients with stage II peripheral arterial occlusive disease (PAOD). Patients were randomly allocated to one of the following groups: Group A--dipyridamole 75 mg three times daily and aspirin 330 mg once daily: Group B--physical exercise; Group C--physical exercise and dipyridamole 75 mg three time daily and aspirin 330 mg once daily. After six months' treatment the pain-free walking time (PFWT) and the maximum walking time (MWT) improved significantly (p less than 0.05) in all three groups. In group A the PFWT lengthened by 35% (from 101.00 +/- 34.56 to 137.32 +/- 40.50 s) and the MWT by 38% (from 150.34 +/- 55.60 to 207.26 +/- 60.67 s); in group B the PFWT lengthened by 90% (from 90.65 +/- 40.54 to 171.45 +/- 55.60 s) and the MWT by 86% (from 145.39 +/- 60.50 to 270.63 +/- 63.61 s). When physical exercise was associated with drugs as in group C, the PFWT lengthened by 120% (from 89.51 +/- 43.89 to 196.72 +/- 51.73 s) and the MWT by 105% (from 160.43 +/- 59.84 to 329.05 +/- 63.96 s). No significant variations were observed at any stage of the study in the ankle/arm pressure ratio at rest and after standard treadmill exercise, in the plethysmographic rest and peak flows, or in the transcutaneous oxygen pressure in basal conditions and in its half recovery time after an induced ischemia. The results confirm the benefits of regular exercise in stage II PAOD patients but suggest they may be enhanced by antiplatelet therapy. 
Reverse-perfused sleeve: an improved device for measurement of sphincteric function of the crural diaphragm. The sphincteric function of the crural diaphragm has been difficult to measure in humans. The authors recently reported the use of a Dent sleeve device to measure esophagogastric junction pressure during contraction of the crural diaphragm. However, the major limitation of the conventional sleeve device is its slow response rate, and sustained diaphragmatic contractions of 6-8 seconds must be induced to measure the true pressure. In this article, the principles of a reverse-perfused sleeve device and the theoretical basis for its fast response rate are reported. The reverse-perfused sleeve is validated in an in vitro model of the lower esophageal sphincter. Furthermore, in vivo studies were performed in seven healthy human subjects. Standardized Muller maneuvers and straight-leg raises were performed to induce diaphragmatic contractions. Pressure increases of 50-150 mm Hg during diaphragmatic contractions were attained in less than 1 second. The delay between the actual contraction of the diaphragm as measured by simultaneously recorded crural diaphragm electromyography and pressure recorded by the sleeve was only 0.25-0.50 seconds. Increasing the rate of infusion of the sleeve from 0.5 to 1.0 mL/min did not further improve the response rate of the reverse perfused sleeve. It was concluded that the reverse-perfused sleeve is a considerable improvement over the conventional sleeve for quantitating the sphincteric function of the crural diaphragm. The role of the crural diaphragm in reflux esophagitis may be easily investigated using a reverse-perfused sleeve device. 
Long-term effect of thrombolytic therapy on left ventricular ejection fraction after acute myocardial infarction. To assess the long-term effect of thrombolytic therapy on left ventricular (LV) systolic function, 222 patients with acute myocardial infarction treated with intravenous tissue plasminogen activator within 4 hours of symptom onset underwent assessment of LV ejection fraction (EF) by radionuclide equilibrium angiography at hospital discharge and 1 year later. Mean EF at hospital discharge (46 +/- 12) was similar to that at 1 year (45 +/- 13). Stepwise multivariate linear regression analysis identified EF at discharge and patency of the infarct-related artery before discharge as independent predictors of EF change at 1 year (p = 0.0002 and 0.003, respectively). Random assignments to invasive versus conservative treatment strategies or to early versus delayed beta-blocker therapy did not affect EF change during follow-up. No significant deterioration of EF was observed in patients with larger infarcts. However, EF decreased from 45 +/- 10 at hospital discharge to 39 +/- 12 (p = 0.005) at 1-year follow-up in a subgroup of patients with history of prior infarction. Thus, patients with acute myocardial infarction, treated with intravenous tissue plasminogen activator early after onset of symptoms, appear to have stable LV function between hospital discharge and 1 year follow-up. The change in EF between hospital discharge and 1 year can be predicted from the EF value at discharge, patency of the infarct-related artery before discharge and history of previous myocardial infarction. 
Comparison of estrogen receptor and epidermal growth factor receptor content of primary and involved nodes in human breast cancer. Estrogen receptors (ER) and epidermal growth factor receptors (EGFR) in the tumor cells of breast cancer tissues (primary tumors) and metastatic lymph nodes (involved nodes) were analyzed by immunocytochemical study in 19 patients; 12 were ER positive, and seven were ER negative. Microscopic study was used to determine the percentage of positive cells and the staining index. The percentage of EGFR-positive cells and the EGFR staining index were higher in the ER-negative primary tumors than ER-positive primary tumors. In ER-positive cases, both the number of ER-positive cells and ER content per cell was less in the involved nodes than in the primary tumors, whereas the number of EGFR-positive cells and EGFR content per cell was greater in affected nodes. On the other hand, in the ER-negative cases the number of EGFR-positive cells and EGFR content per cell remain almost unchanged between the primary tumors and involved nodes. The authors supposed a probability, in this study, that estrogen may exert inhibitory action on EGFR production through binding to ER. 
Assessment of myocardial perfusion by positron emission tomography. Positron emission tomography (PET) represents an advanced imaging technology for the noninvasive evaluation of regional myocardial blood flow. Several blood flow tracers are available, including cyclotron-produced radiopharmaceuticals such as [15O]H2O and [13N]NH3 and generator-produced rubidium-82 ([82Rb]-) and copper-62 ([62Cu]-) pyruvaldehyde-bis-(N-4-methylthiosemicarbazone) (PTSM). 82Rb and [13N]NH3 are the most commonly employed tracers for the qualitative evaluation of regional myocardial perfusion. Their use allows the accurate detection of coronary artery disease in combination with pharmacologic stress. Initial comparative studies with thallium-201 (201Tl) single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) have shown that PET has a higher diagnostic accuracy. Beyond improved diagnostic performance, the quantitative flow measurements provided by PET represent an important advance in nuclear cardiology. The radiopharmaceuticals [15O]H2O and [13N]NH3 have been applied for the noninvasive determination of regional coronary reserve. Quantification of blood flow based on tracer kinetic modeling yields blood flow values in close agreement with determinations provided by invasive procedures. The noninvasive quantification of blood flow provides a useful research and clinical tool for the objective assessment of therapeutic interventions as well as pathophysiologic alterations of regional myocardial blood flow in various cardiac diseases. 
Eosinophilic fasciitis is clinically distinguishable from the eosinophilia-myalgia syndrome and is not associated with L-tryptophan use. Induration of the skin develops in a majority of patients with the eosinophilia-myalgia syndrome associated with L-tryptophan, and bears striking clinical and histopathological resemblance to eosinophilic fasciitis (EF). These similarities have led to the suggestion that eosinophilia-myalgia syndrome and EF are the same disease. To study the relationship of eosinophilia-myalgia syndrome and EF, we ascertained the prevalence of L-tryptophan use in a cohort of patients with EF, and compared their clinical and laboratory findings to those of patients with eosinophilia-myalgia syndrome associated cutaneous involvement. None of 11 patients who were diagnosed as having EF between 1970 and 1989 used L-tryptophan containing preparations prior to the onset of their illness. Marked clinical and laboratory test differences were observed between patients with EF and eosinophilia-myalgia syndrome. Patients with eosinophilia-myalgia syndrome had a more acute onset, more severe symptoms, higher frequency of rash and of pulmonary, cardiac, gastrointestinal, neurologic, myopathic and thyroid involvement compared to patients with EF. Corticosteroid therapy resulted in improvement of cutaneous involvement in 88% of patients with EF but it was only partially successful in patients with eosinophilia-myalgia syndrome. Hospitalization and fatalities occurred only among patients with eosinophilia-myalgia syndrome. These observations demonstrate that eosinophilia-myalgia syndrome is a more severe disease with multisystemic involvement that can be clinically distinguished from EF. In contrast to eosinophilia-myalgia syndrome, EF is not associated with L-tryptophan ingestion. 
Prediction of major cardiac events after peripheral vascular surgery using dipyridamole echocardiography. Patients undergoing peripheral vascular surgery are at increased risk of postoperative cardiac complications. To evaluate the role of dipyridamole echocardiography in predicting major cardiac events, 109 unselected patients undergoing elective peripheral vascular surgery were prospectively studied. Preoperative dipyridamole echocardiograms were interpreted by an echocardiographer unaware of all clinical data. Patients were followed up until hospital discharge by research physicians without knowledge of dipyridamole echocardiography results. Outcomes were classified using strict predefined criteria by reviewers unaware of other clinical and echocardiographic data. Of the 109 patients, 9 (8%) had positive studies defined as development of new regional wall motion abnormalities or worsening of preexistent wall motion abnormalities. Of these 9 patients, 7 had postoperative events, including 3 cardiac deaths, 1 nonfatal myocardial infarction, 2 with unstable angina, and 1 with pulmonary edema. Only 1 event occurred among the 100 patients with negative studies. The sensitivity and specificity of dipyridamole echocardiography for predicting cardiac events after vascular surgery were 88 and 98%, respectively; the positive and negative predictive values were 78 and 99%. The relative risk of having a cardiac event if dipyridamole echocardiography was abnormal was 78 (95% confidence interval, 11 to 564; p less than 0.0001). If these results are extended and confirmed by other investigators, preoperative dipyridamole echocardiography may be an important screening test for patients undergoing elective peripheral vascular surgery. 
Efficacy of intraarterial heparin in maintaining microvascular patency: an experimental model. Human-grade sodium heparin was studied to determine thrombosis model patency rates between an intraarterial infusion versus an intravenous method of delivery in a rabbit model. Specific differences in patency and partial thromboplastin times were studied in each group and compared with a saline-perfused group. Three animal groups (New Zealand white rabbits) were established (total = 35 animals). Standardized femoral arterial 5-mm inversion grafts (AIG) were done in each animal in each group. The animals in the control group received intravenous saline infusion, while the two treatment groups received intravenous heparin (12 animals) or intraarterial heparin (12 animals minus 1 anesthesia death). The route of instillation of the infusate was selected at random after completing the inversion grafts. A proximal epigastric branch was utilized for access in those animals randomized to the intraarterial group. Intravenous delivery was accomplished by means of a femoral venous catheter in the vena cava. A 72-hour period of infusion was used in all animals. A dose of 45 units per hour of heparin following a 500-unit bolus was used in the intravenous group. After an identical bolus dose, 25 units per hour of heparin was administered in the intraarterial group. The control (saline group) was given 1 cc saline (in a volume equal to the heparin-dosed groups) daily for 3 days. Arterial inversion graft patency rates were assessed by direct inspection at day 5. Systemic and regional (i.e., distal to the inversion graft) partial thromboplastin times (PTT) were measured in representative control, IV, and intraarterial heparin-treated groups. Complications were recorded. 
Apheresis-elutriation program for adoptive immunotherapy with autologous activated monocytes in cancer patients. Human blood monocytes (Mo) and monocyte-derived macrophages (M phi) are known to be potent antitumor cytotoxic effector cells through activation with recombinant human interferon gamma (rIFN-gamma), bacterial muramyldipeptide or the synthetic derivative muramyltripeptide phosphatidylethanolamine entrapped in liposomes (L-MTP-PE). Large-scale generation of ex vivo activated Mo from the blood of cancer patients proved feasible. We report our experience with a fixed rotor speed counterflow centrifugation elutration (CEE) procedure using the newly available Beckman high capacity JE-5.0 rotor system that reproducibly isolates up to 1.0-1.5 x 10(9) Mo with greater than 90% purity, in suspension and functionally intact derived from peripheral blood mononuclear cell-enriched suspensions obtained by leukapheresis (LP) from healthy volunteers and cancer patients. The semiclosed, easy to handle CCE system, was adapted to a sterile technique that permitted clinical trials in adoptive monocyte immunotherapy. Freshly isolated Mo did not lose morphological or functional integrity and had no spontaneous activation. Their abilities to become activated to the cytotoxic state after 18-h stimulation with 500 U/ml rIFN-gamma or 1 microgram/ml L-MTP-PE and to differentiate into matured M phi in vitro were not altered. The system was therefore used to isolate large numbers of Mo for a phase I clinical trial of intraperitoneal immunotherapy with L-MTP-PE activated autologous Mo in nine patients with peritoneal carcinomatosis. Each patient received weekly Mo infusions (n = 5) with an intrapatient dose escalation schedule (from 10(7) to 10(9) Mo). Toxicities were mild including fever, chills and abdominal pain. There was no treatment-induced thromboembolic event or capillary leak syndrome. 
Latency and time-dependent exposure in a case-control study. Detailed historical data are elicited often from subjects in retrospective studies, yielding time-dependent measures of exposures. Investigation of a hypothesized period of latency can be made by examining disease/exposure relationships in multiple time windows, either along the age or time-before diagnosis axes. We suggest splitting the data into many time intervals and separately fitting regression models to the available data in each interval. Covariances between estimated coefficients from different intervals are empirically estimated, and used for assessing variability of specified functions of the time-specific coefficients. Alternative methods of interval formation and their consequences are discussed. We apply these methods to a French case-control study of oral contraceptive use and cervical cancer incidence, and compare the results to those of standard analyses. 
Dipyridamole 201Tl scintigraphy in the evaluation of prognosis after myocardial infarction. Dipyridamole 201Tl imaging has been proposed as an alternative to exercise ECG testing for the prehospital discharge evaluation of patients recovering from myocardial infarction. The rationale is that many postinfarction patients with exercise-induced ischemia experience later cardiac events, and the sensitivity of predischarge exercise ECG testing in patients with multivessel disease ranges from only 45% to 62%. In addition, several groups of investigators have shown the sensitivity of submaximum exercise 201Tl imaging to be less than ideal. This report summarizes the current status of dipyridamole 201Tl imaging in the period of 1-13 days after myocardial infarction. Although the number of studies performed to date is limited, the following conclusions can be drawn: dipyridamole 201Tl imaging after myocardial infarction was associated with no serious side effects, and those present could be quickly reversed with aminophylline; redistribution with dipyridamole 201Tl images definitely correlates with prognosis after uncomplicated myocardial infarction; dipyridamole 201Tl imaging is definitely useful in patients unable to exercise for a variety of reasons; and future studies are definitely indicated to further define the role of dipyridamole 201Tl imaging for assessing prognosis, especially in those patients undergoing interventional therapy after acute myocardial infarction. 
Bacterial translocation. The phenomenon of bacterial translocation, the movement of viable indigenous microorganisms across the intestinal epithelial barrier, has been recognized for almost 100 years. At the present time, the precise mechanism of microbial transport is unknown. Active epithelial uptake and phagocyte-mediated transport have been proposed as likely explanations for the extraintestinal movement of bacteria to mesenteric lymph nodes and distant organ sites. Translocation has been proposed as the pivotal process associated with intestinal origin portal sepsis in seriously ill and immunocompromised patients. While several etiologic factors can be implicated in the pathogenesis of bacterial translocation, the present clinical implications are based almost solely on studies of dogs, rats and mice. Present investigations continue to suggest a causal relationship between intestinal mucosal integrity and infection by indigenous gastrointestinal bacteria. 
Superior vena caval thrombosis detected by transesophageal echocardiography. Three patients with clinical suspicion of bacterial endocarditis, induced by either pacemaker or indwelling catheter, underwent transesophageal echocardiography. High short-axis cuts through the great vessels, however, revealed the presence of superior vena caval thrombus in all three patients. Transesophageal echocardiography is more sensitive in establishing the diagnosis of superior vena caval thrombus than surface echocardiography. Comparison of transesophageal echocardiography with other diagnostic modalities is needed in assessing its overall sensitivity and specificity. 
The symptomatic os subfibulare. Avulsion fracture of the fibula associated with recurrent instability of the ankle. Four adults who had symptomatic instability of the ankle had an associated os subfibulare. Operative exploration revealed the ossicle to represent a non-union of an avulsion fracture of the anterior talofibular ligament. These findings suggest that an os subfibulare represents an avulsion fracture that may or may not be associated with laxity of the anterior talofibular ligament, rather than being a normal variant. 
A novel enzyme immunoassay for serodiagnosis of Helicobacter pylori infection. Helicobacter pylori has recently been implicated as an etiologic agent of gastroduodenal disorders. Comparing the antibody to H. pylori in the sera of patients with that of normal controls by Western blot analysis, a unique antibody was detected in the sera of patients, which reacted with the 25-kilodalton antigen of H. pylori. On the other hand, monoclonal antibody CP3 prepared in the authors' laboratory also recognized the 25-kilodalton antigen of H. pylori. Whether the serum antibody of the patient recognized the CP3 antigen purified by monoclonal antibody CP3 was then examined. Western blot analysis showed that the patient's serum reacted strongly with the affinity-purified CP3 antigen. Using monoclonal antibody CP3, an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay to detect CP3 antibody in sera was established. In patients with chronic gastritis and gastric ulcers, the titer of CP3 antibody was significantly higher than in normal controls and correlated with the histological grade of antral gastritis. The detection of CP3 antibody in sera is useful in the diagnosis of chronic gastritis and gastric ulcer associated with H. pylori infection and also in evaluation of the grade of gastritis. 
Acute short-term memory loss from trimethyltin exposure. We report a case of organic tin exposure in a graduate chemistry student. The inhalational and transcutaneous exposure occurred following a laboratory explosion. The patient initially presented with first and second degree burns of the face and chest, and developed an acute loss of short-term memory 72 hours after exposure. The memory loss gradually improved over the course of several months. 
Chronic active Epstein-Barr virus infection and virus-associated hemophagocytic syndrome. We describe two unusual cases of Epstein-Barr virus infection that were complicated by the virus-associated hemophagocytic syndrome, predominantly involving the spleen. Both patients were young adult men who presented with fever, pancytopenia, and hepatosplenomegaly. Both had prompt symptomatic and hematologic improvement following splenectomy. Severe constitutional symptoms recurred in one patient 1 month after splenectomy, and he died of septicemia 2 months later. In both cases, there was prominent hemophagocytosis in the splenic red pulp. Some hemophagocytosis was also noted in the liver from the fatal case. Unexpectedly, no hemophagocytosis was detected in the bone marrow biopsy specimens or marrow aspirates obtained from these patients. The DNA hybridization studies detected Epstein-Barr virus genomes in spleen samples from both patients, and both patients had atypical patterns of serologic response to the virus, suggesting that a defective immune response may lead to an unrestrained viral proliferation. We conclude that there is an association between chronic active Epstein-Barr virus infection and the hemophagocytic syndrome, but that the tissue distribution of the hemophagocytosis may be variable. 
Longer relapse-free period after sucralfate than after H2-blocker treatment of duodenal and gastric ulcers. In a prospective investigation of 2,045 patients with recurrent peptic ulcer disease, the relapse-free period after acute treatment with sucralfate was evaluated over 1 year. This remission period was compared retrospectively with that achieved by previous treatment with a histamine-H2-blocker in the same patients. Only patients who had a symptomatic relapse within 1 year after H2-blocker therapy were included. Patients with no relapses within 1 year after sucralfate were assumed to have a relapse on day 366, in order to compare the two periods. In 73% of the evaluable 2,045 patients, remission after sucralfate was longer than after H2-blocker, and 23% of these patients had no symptomatic relapse at all within 1 year after sucralfate. The average relapse-free period after sucralfate was 212 days, as compared with 132 days after H2-blockers (difference = 80 days; p less than 0.0001). Elderly and nonsmoking patients and those experiencing their first recurrence, or who had a duodenal ulcer, benefited especially from acute treatment with sucralfate. It can be concluded that peptic ulcer patients with a relapse after treatment with an H2-blocker are suitable candidates for sucralfate therapy. There is a high probability that the relapse-free period after sucralfate is longer than after H2-blocker treatment in both gastric and duodenal ulcer patients. 
Endothelium-dependent responses of cerebral blood vessels during chronic hypertension. Acetylcholine produces less dilatation of pial arterioles in stroke-prone spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHRSP) than in normotensive (WKY) rats. Responses of cerebral vessels to acetylcholine and bradykinin appear to involve different mechanisms. Our first goal was to determine whether responses of pial arterioles to bradykinin are impaired in SHRSP. Diameter of pial arterioles (20-60 microns) was measured using intravital microscopy in WKY rats and SHRSP (9-12 months old). Superfusion of bradykinin (3 x 10(-7) M) dilated pial arterioles by 35 +/- 6% (mean +/- SEM) in WKY rats, but only 21 +/- 3% in SHRSP (p less than 0.05 versus WKY rats). Both nitric oxide (5 x 10(-7) M) and nitroglycerin (10(-5) M) produced similar vasodilatation in WKY rats and SHRSP. Our second goal was to determine whether alteration of postreceptor mechanisms contributes to impairment of endothelium-dependent cerebral vasodilatation in SHRSP. Calcium ionophore A23187 (10(-5) M) produced more vasodilatation in WKY rats than in SHRSP (32 +/- 8% versus 9 +/- 4%, p less than 0.05). Responses to A23187 (10(-5) M) were inhibited by indomethacin (46 +/- 13% versus 15 +/- 5%, p less than 0.05) in WKY rats, whereas responses to A23187 (10(-6) M) were potentiated modestly by indomethacin (-3 +/- 2% versus 4 +/- 2%, p less than 0.05) in SHRSP. 
Production of interleukin-1 and interleukin-6 by human keratinocytes and squamous cell carcinoma cell lines. Cultured human keratinocytes and squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) cell lines were analyzed for the presence of ribonucleic acid (RNA) transcripts for the cytokines interleukin-1 and interleukin-6 and for these proteins. This study demonstrates that both cytokines are synthesized and secreted by both normal keratinocytes and SCC lines. The rate of secretion of these cytokines can be augmented in response to a variety of stimuli including tumor necrosis factor-alpha, granulocyte-macrophage colony stimulating factor, transforming growth factor-beta and the combination of lipopolysaccharide and phorbol myristate acetate. Interleukin-1 and interleukin-6 have been reported to influence the proliferation of cultured human fibroblasts. However, these cytokines had no significant effect on the proliferation of human keratinocytes or the SCC lines tested. Although it seems unlikely that interleukin-1 or interleukin-6 could directly influence keratinocyte proliferation in vivo, the capacity of these cells to synthesize and release these cytokines supports earlier observations that keratinocytes may play an important role in augmenting an immune or inflammatory response. 
PBC 95k, a 95-kilodalton nuclear autoantigen in primary biliary cirrhosis. We have identified a novel antinuclear antibody (ANA) in the sera of patients with primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC). Sera from 22 of 50 PBC patients stained the nuclei of HEp-2 cells in a pattern of 5-20 discrete dots, on indirect immunofluorescence. Typically, the titers were higher than 1:1,280. This staining pattern was seen in only 4 of 1,240 ANA-positive samples from patients with other connective tissue diseases, and in none of the ANA-positive sera from 49 patients with other liver diseases. Sera which stained the nuclear dots bound a 95-kd polypeptide in immunoblots of HeLa nuclei and in immunoprecipitates of 35S-methionine-labeled HeLa extracts. Affinity-purified antibodies from the 95-kd protein reproduced the nuclear dot immunofluorescence staining pattern, demonstrating that this polypeptide is located in the nuclear dots. ANA of this type, therefore, occur in 44% of patients with PBC, and they appear to be specific for PBC. These antibodies bind a 95-kd protein that is discrete and is scattered throughout the nucleus. 
An evaluation of immunohistologic stains for immunoglobulin light chains in bone marrow biopsies in benign and malignant plasma cell proliferations. Bone marrow specimens from 226 patients with a variety of benign and malignant plasma cell proliferations were studied to assess the reliability of immunohistologic studies in their evaluation. The clonality of the bone marrow plasma cells was compared with results of serum and urine electrophoreses. Discordance was observed most frequently in cases in which a paraprotein was demonstrated, but no monoclonality was detected by immunoperoxidase (16 cases). Of these 16 cases, 9 had 5% or less bone marrow plasma cells. In only one case was the light chain class of the bone marrow plasma cells different from that of the paraprotein. If discordant cases with 5% or less plasma cells are eliminated, the overall concordance was 97%. The authors' findings indicate that immunohistologic studies for immunoglobulin light chains in Zenker-fixed decalcified bone marrow biopsy sections are reliable in the evaluation of patients with plasma cell proliferations when the marrow contains more than 5% plasma cells. 
The p53 tumour suppressor gene. The cell cycle is composed of a series of steps which can be negatively or positively regulated by various factors. Chief among the negative regulators is the p53 protein. Alteration or inactivation of p53 by mutation, or by its interactions with oncogene products of DNA tumour viruses, can lead to cancer. These mutations seem to be the most common genetic change in human cancers. 
Cerebral perfusion during canine hypothermic cardiopulmonary bypass: effect of arterial carbon dioxide tension Cerebral blood flow (radioactive microspheres), intracranial pressure (subdural bolt), and retinal histopathology were examined in 20 dogs undergoing 150 minutes of hypothermic (28 degrees C) cardiopulmonary bypass to compare alpha-stat (arterial carbon dioxide tension, 40 +/- 1 mm Hg; n = 10) and pH-stat (arterial carbon dioxide tension, 61 +/- 1 mm Hg; n = 10) techniques of arterial carbon dioxide tension management. Pump flow (80 mL.kg-1.min-1), mean aortic pressure (78 +/- 2 mm Hg), and hemoglobin level (87 +/- 3 g/L [8.7 +/- 0.3 g/dL]) were maintained constant. During bypass, intracranial pressure progressively increased in the alpha-stat group from 6.0 +/- 1.0 to 13.9 +/- 1.8 mm Hg (p less than 0.05) and in the pH-stat group from 7.7 +/- 1.1 to 14.7 +/- 1.4 mm Hg (p less than 0.05), although there was no evidence of loss of intracranial compliance or intracranial edema formation as assessed by brain water content. With cooling, cerebral blood flow decreased by 56% to 62% in the alpha-stat group (p less than 0.05) and by 48% to 56% in the pH-stat group (p less than 0.05). However, 30 minutes after rewarming to 37 degrees C, cerebral blood flow in both groups failed to increase and remained significantly depressed compared with baseline values. Both groups showed similar amounts of ischemic retinal damage, with degeneration of bipolar cells found in the inner nuclear layer in 67% of animals. We conclude that, independent of the arterial carbon dioxide tension management technique, (1) cerebral perfusion decreased comparably during prolonged hypothermic bypass, (2) intracranial pressure increases progressively, (3) ischemic damage to retinal cells occurs despite maintenance of aortic pressure and flow, and (4) a significant reduction in cerebral perfusion persists after rewarming. 
Blindness resulting from orbital complications of sinusitis. Loss of vision remains a potential complication of orbital infection. Appropriate evaluation and management of the patient with signs and symptoms of orbital inflammation may prevent progression to blindness. Evaluation of patients with orbital inflammation from sinusitis includes a comprehensive clinical examination and radiographic studies. Clinical examination should test for changes in visual acuity, pupillary reactivity, and extraocular motion. Computerized tomography (CT) has facilitated the diagnosis of orbital infections and aids in diagnosis. However, CT can be misleading in patients with acute orbital infections and should not be relied on to determine the need for surgical intervention. We reviewed the records of all patients admitted to Parkland Memorial Hospital from 1978 to 1988 with orbital complications resulting from sinusitis. Four of 159 patients in this group had permanent blindness. The presence of an abscess, which was ultimately found at surgical exploration, was not diagnosed by CT in any of these four patients. Clinical examination remains the most important indicator for surgical intervention in patients with orbital complications of sinusitis. We present our findings and give guidelines for surgical intervention in patients with orbital infections resulting from sinusitis. 
Prediction of subclinical tumor infiltration in basal cell carcinoma. Two thousand-sixteen basal cell carcinomas (BCCs) were documented in terms of age, anatomic location, tumor diameter, initial excision depth, safety margin, histologic type, and the position of tumor outgrowths as determined by three-dimensional histologic study of the tumor margins in paraffin sections (micrographic surgery). The extent of each subsequent excision was recorded until tumor-free tissue was reached. The results showed that BCCs have a highly irregular infiltration pattern and a predilection for small, fingerlike outgrowths whose bases occupy 1-30 degrees of the tumor circumference. When superficial extension was expressed mathematically, the resulting exponential functions varied highly significantly (P = .001) according to histologic tumor type and diameter. The resulting curves permitted very precise prediction of the probability of tumor-positive margins (ie, subtotal excision), depending on the safety margin, histologic tumor type, and tumor diameter. For example, the probability of tumor-positive margins after excision of a BCC up to 10 mm in diameter is 30% with a safety margin of 2 mm, 16% with a safety margin of 3 mm, and 5% with a safety margin of 5 mm. The probability of tumor-positive margins for fibrosing primary BCCs 10-20 mm in diameter is 48, 34, and 18% with safety margins of 2, 3, and 5 mm, respectively. Recurrent tumors have a significantly higher probability of positive margins (P = .001) than primary ones. Anatomic location and tumor age affect subclinical extension only indirectly. 
An outbreak of designer drug--related deaths in Pennsylvania 3-Methylfentanyl ("China White") is a "designer" opiate that has caused more than 100 overdose deaths in California since 1979, but that has not been associated previously with deaths east of the Rocky Mountains. During 1988, 3-methylfentanyl was identified in 16 fatal overdose cases in Allegheny County, Pennsylvania, contributing to a fourfold rise in overdose mortality during October of that year. Morphine was detected in the blood of five persons (31%) and cocaine in the blood of three persons (19%) dying of 3-methylfentanyl overdoses; these were demographically similar to 99 other fatal overdose cases investigated by the county coroner from 1986 through 1988. This documents the contribution of 3-methylfentanyl to overdose mortality in an eastern city and the use of 3-methylfentanyl with other illegal drugs. Drug abusers in the northeastern United States should be considered at risk for more "designer drug" overdose outbreaks in the future. 
Serum hepatitis B virus DNA in hepatitis B virus seropositive and seronegative patients with normal liver function. The presence of hepatitis type B virus (HBV) DNA in serum specimens from 926 apparently healthy people with normal liver functions was determined by polymerase chain reaction; 41.2% of people with positive results for HBV surface antigen (HBsAg) (94 of 228) and 95.2% of people with positive results for HBV e antigen (HBeAg) (60 of 63) were found to have positive results for serum HBV DNA. On the other hand, serum HBV DNA was found in 11.0% (77 of 698) of HBsAg-negative people and in 13% (69 of 530) of those who had positive results for serum antibodies directed against HBsAg. The results seem to suggest that HBV DNA can be found in a significant portion of apparently healthy people with normal liver function who are either seronegative for HBsAg or seropositive for antibodies directed against HBsAg. 
Posterior spinal fusion in Sotos' syndrome. Sotos' syndrome (synonym: cerebral gigantism) is the association of mental retardation, macrocephaly and prenatal onset of accelerated growth. The rapid skeletal growth may account for a 4% incidence of scoliosis. General anaesthesia using halothane or enflurane in nitrous oxide and oxygen, with opioid supplementation and labetalol to induce moderate hypotension, appeared to be a satisfactory technique for corrective spinal surgery. The potential problems are discussed, with mental retardation and sometimes aggressive behaviour contraindicating a "wake-up" test. Extradural somatosensory evoked potential monitoring is a satisfactory alternative. Hook failures seem more likely than in patients undergoing surgery for adolescent idiopathic scoliosis. 
Blood pressure (systolic and diastolic) and risk of fatal coronary heart disease Among the 356,222 men screened for the Multiple Risk Factor Intervention Trial who had no history of hospitalization for heart attack at entry, more than 2,000 coronary deaths occurred during 6 years of follow-up. With this large data set, detailed cross-tabulations clearly and simply showed the strong graded relation between blood pressure and coronary heart disease death. This risk gradient was evident in each of five age groups ranging from 35 to 57 years and for levels of diastolic blood pressure ranging from less than 75 mm Hg to greater than 115 mm Hg. Systolic blood pressure was more strongly associated with coronary heart disease death than was diastolic blood pressure, and isolated systolic blood pressure elevation was found to be an important risk factor in these middle-aged men. The risk of coronary death was increased among hypertensive men who had elevated serum cholesterol levels or who smoked cigarettes. Because less than 10% of hypertensive men had cholesterol levels in the lowest quintile (below 182 mg/dl) and were nonsmokers, a multi-intervention approach for the large majority of hypertensive persons is clearly indicated. Risks of death were also substantially increased among those hypertensive men who already had end-organ damage, emphasizing the importance of early treatment to prevent such damage. These findings have implications for the design of prevention trials and clinical practice, as it is clear that systolic as well as diastolic blood pressure should be considered in treating hypertensive patients. Additionally, treatment goals should be directed at preventing not only death but many other morbid events, clinical and subclinical, that are associated with elevated blood pressure and that are preventable with appropriate treatment. 
Non-trauma mortality in elderly women with low bone mineral density. Study of Osteoporotic Fractures Research Group. 9704 ambulatory women aged 65 years or older were prospectively studied to determine whether low bone mineral density (osteopenia) was associated with mortality. Bone mineral density was measured at entry to the study by single-photon absorptiometry. 299 women died during a mean of 2.8 years' follow-up. Osteopenia was associated with increased non-trauma mortality, probably because it is a marker for several other adverse factors. Each standard deviation decrease in proximal radius bone mineral density (0.104 g/cm2) was associated with a 1.19-fold increase in mortality (95% confidence interval 1.04-1.36), adjusted for age and duration of follow-up. Diminished bone mineral density at the proximal radius was strongly associated with deaths from stroke (relative risk = 1.74; 95% CI 1.12-2.70), an association that was not confounded by history of previous stroke, hypertension, postmenopausal use of oestrogen, thiazide diuretic treatment, diabetes mellitus, and smoking. Most deaths in women with low bone mineral density are unrelated to the occurrence of fractures-an observation that should be taken into account when estimating the need for and cost-effectiveness of bone-density screening and fracture prevention programmes. 
Is deleting the digital rectal examination a good idea? Many groups have taken the position that the digital rectal examination should be discontinued as part of the annual screening physical examination. We examined the effects of not doing a digital rectal examination on the early diagnosis of prostate cancer. The average time since a previous rectal examination increased as the stage of cancer increased. The digital rectal examination proved to be a relatively insensitive test, with 40% of stage D cancers being detected initially within 12 months of the most recent examination. Nevertheless, an annual digital rectal examination did detect a greater percentage of lower stage (and thus more localized and potentially curable) cancers when repeated within 12 months. When the last rectal examination was more than 24 months previous, cancers detected were more likely to be advanced. Without a digital rectal examination, patients would have their disease detected only by the presence of symptoms. When it was done because of symptoms, 81% of our patients had stage D cancers compared with 32% of stage B and 38% of stage C patients. Without the routine use of this examination, patients with prostate cancer would be more likely to have higher stage and less potentially curable lesions at the time of diagnosis. We conclude that the digital rectal examination remains an important part of routine annual physical examinations. 
Arterial stent placement with use of the Wallstent: midterm results of clinical experience. Self-expandable stents of the Wallstent type were used in 26 iliac and 15 femoropopliteal artery lesions of 31 patients to treat stenoses or occlusions. The indications were confined to complex lesions, including residual stenoses and dissections after percutaneous procedures or previous surgery in the iliac artery lesions, and long-segment (mean, 13.5 cm) occlusions with inadequate response to percutaneous recanalization in the femoropopliteal artery lesions. In the iliac artery group, after stent placement, 96% of the lesions were patent at a mean follow-up of 16 months (range, 6-30 months). In the femoropopliteal artery group, of 11 patients available for follow-up, only six had patent stents at 7-26 months (mean, 20 months). Four of these six patients required one to three secondary interventions. Self-expanding endoprostheses are of great value in complex iliac artery lesions where simple balloon dilation is insufficient. Stent placement for long femoral artery lesions should be performed with utmost reserve, and the extent of stent placement should be as short as possible. 
Renal cell carcinoma in young and old patients. Comparison of prognostic pathologic variables (cell type, tumor grade and stage, and DNA ploidy pattern) and their impact on disease outcome. A group of 41 young patients (age less than or equal to 40 years; mean, 35.7 years) and a group of 34 old patients (age greater than or equal to 80 years; mean, 82.4 years) who underwent operation for renal cell carcinoma between 1970 and 1986 were compared. Sex, grade, and DNA ploidy pattern distributions were similar between the groups. Granular cell and papillary cancers with lower stages at presentation were more common among the young. In patients with high-stage disease, 73 percent of the older group but none of the younger had DNA diploid tumors. Low-stage clear cell carcinoma caused cancer death only in the young. Stage I nondiploid clear cell carcinomas were associated with death (33%) only in the young. Overall, death rates seem similar for both groups but among the young most (63%) occurred with low-stage disease and a nondiploid pattern only; among the old, 88 percent occurred with high-stage disease and independent of DNA ploidy pattern. 
Complications of pregnancy and delivery in relation to psychosis in adult life: data from the British perinatal mortality survey sample. OBJECTIVE--To evaluate whether events occurring at or around the time of birth contribute to the onset of psychotic illness in adult life. DESIGN-Pregnancy and birth complications as possible causes of adult mental illness were studied in the population sample of the British perinatal mortality survey. Subsequent psychiatric admissions were independently identified through the Mental Health Enquiry and records of regional and special health authorities. Logistic regression was used to compare data on perinatal deaths with those on survivors to determine factors independently associated with perinatal death, and this equation was then used to calculate the risk of perinatal death for each survivor. SUBJECTS--16,980 people born in a single week in 1958 (the British perinatal mortality survey sample), including 252 patients admitted to psychiatric care; case notes of 235 patients were supplied. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES AND RESULTS--Patients with a schizophrenic illness (whether defined by "broad" (n = 57) or "narrow" (n = 35) diagnostic criteria) did not have a greater mean risk of perinatal death than the population in general, but there was some evidence of increased liability (relative risk 2.43; 95% confidence interval 1.17 to 5.05) for those with affective psychosis (n = 32). Specific high risk variables for affective psychosis were decreased gestation time (273.9 v 281.2 days; mean difference 7.3 days, 95% confidence interval 3.1 to 11.5; p less than 0.002) and prescription of vitamin K to the child in the first week of life (19% of patients v 5% of controls, p = 0.016). CONCLUSIONS--The findings give no support to theories that factors predicting perinatal mortality contribute significantly to causation of schizophrenic illness. Further investigation of decreased gestation length in relation to affective disorder is required. 
Coronary artery thrombolysis: comparison of approved agents. Three agents approved for the lysis of thrombi in coronary arteries--alteplase, anistreplase and streptokinase--have undergone critical clinical experimental trials in Europe and the United States. Global comparison of their efficacy shows that alteplase is slightly more effective (71 percent) in restoring patency than anistreplase (60 percent) and streptokinase (58 percent). Streptokinase and anistreplase are allergenic, and repeat administration is not feasible in the short-term, a distinct advantage for alteplase. More accurate dosing of thrombolytic agents and skillful use of aspirin and heparin improve the efficacy of thrombolytic therapy but can also increase the risk of bleeding. A recanalization rate of 90 percent or more could be achieved if the thrombolytic agent is administered within the first hour after thrombosis. Administration this soon after the development of thrombosis may be possible if the agent is given outside the hospital by practicing physicians or, perhaps, paramedics. 
Cerebrospinal fluid protein and opening pressure in idiopathic intracranial hypertension (pseudotumor cerebri). We studied the relationship between the CSF protein concentration and the degree of elevation of the CSF opening pressure in 177 patients with idiopathic intracranial hypertension (pseudotumor cerebri). There was no linear correlation between the CSF protein and opening pressure. In addition, low CSF protein (less than 20 mg/dl) was present in only 26% of the patients. Our findings fail to confirm previous reports of an inverse relationship between the CSF opening pressure and CSF protein as well as low CSF protein in these patients. 
Delayed presentation of a carotid-cavernous sinus fistula in a patient with traumatic brain injury. Carotid-cavernous sinus fistulas are rare complications of traumatic brain injury, facial trauma and postorthognathic surgery. A high level of clinical suspicion is necessary, particularly for patients who are unable to communicate, to establish the diagnosis. A case of delayed presentation of a carotid-cavernous sinus fistula after traumatic brain injury is presented. This case illustrates that early recognition of this disorder is crucial to prevent significant morbidity. 
Hydrops fetalis in the McKusick-Kaufman syndrome: a case report. McKusick-Kaufman syndrome is an autosomal recessive multiple malformation syndrome characterized by hydrometrocolpos and polydactyly. We report on a patient with McKusick-Kaufman syndrome and severe hydrops. This case illustrates the necessity of genetic evaluations for all patients with unexplained hydrops. 
Monoclonal antibody YB5.B8 identifies the human c-kit protein product. The c-kit proto-oncogene encodes a 145- to 160-Kd transmembrane tyrosine kinase, which is a member of the platelet-derived growth factor receptor family and is allelic with the murine white spotting locus (W). W mutations affect several aspects of hematopoiesis, most notably erythroid progenitors and mast cells. A monoclonal antibody, YB5.B8, had been raised against the leukemic blasts of a patient with M1-type acute myelocytic leukemia (AML) and it precipitates a 150-Kd cell surface glycoprotein from leukemic cells. The YB5.B8 epitope is expressed on mast cells, on up to 3% of normal mononuclear bone marrow cells, and it identifies a sub-group of AML patients with a poor prognosis. In view of similarities noted between the cell surface antigen identified by YB5.B8 and the c-kit protein product, we performed experiments to determine whether they are identical. c-kit RNA expression in the cell lines HEL (human erythroleukemia) and A172 (glioblastoma) was shown to parallel the expression of the YB5.B8 epitope in these lines as measured by flow cytometry. Immunoprecipitation analysis with anti-kit serum and YB5.B8 antibody indicated that the two antibodies identified proteins of identical size in HEL (155 Kd) and A172 (145 Kd) cells, and sequential immunoprecipitations with the kit and the YB5.B8 antibodies demonstrated that the two antibodies recognize the same molecule. The proteins identified by both the anti-kit and YB5.B8 antibodies displayed in vitro autophosphorylation activity in immune complex kinase assays. In addition, YB5.B8 was able to inhibit the binding of the kit ligand to HEL cells. These studies provide evidence that the YB5.B8 antigen and the c-kit protein product are identical and raise certain hypotheses regarding the role of c-kit in AML. 
Chronic periaortitis presenting as common bile duct obstruction. The case of a 67 year old woman is reported who presented with cholestatic jaundice and was found to have, in addition, an inflammatory abdominal aortic aneurysm. Only at necropsy did histopathology show chronic periaortitis as the aetiology of a pancreatic head mass which, during life, mimicked a pancreatic neoplasm obstructing the bile and pancreatic ducts. 
Subependymal giant cell astrocytoma: a clinical, pathological, and flow cytometric study. Of 345 patients with tuberous sclerosis complex evaluated at the Mayo Clinic from 1950 to 1989, 23 were identified as having brain tumors. In 20 of the 23, histological or clinical evidence showed the tumor to be a subependymal giant cell astrocytoma. A search of the Mayo Clinic tissue registry yielded 73 giant cell-containing astrocytomas and intraventricular gliomas exclusive of ependymomas. Reexamination revealed no further examples of subependymal giant cell astrocytoma in patients without features of the tuberous sclerosis complex. Considerable histological variation was observed in the 15 subependymal giant cell astrocytomas subjected to critical microscopic review. It is of note that no correlation was noted between either the histological features, such as atypia, mitoses, endothelial proliferations, necrosis, or the flow cytometric characteristics and the clinical course or the survival time of the patients. 
Drivers with untreated sleep apnea. A cause of death and serious injury. Three patients with untreated sleep apnea fell asleep while driving and caused serious automobile accidents. One person died, another became permanently paraplegic, and the three patients with sleep apnea were seriously injured in these crashes. This sequela of sleep apnea is not surprising, since subjects with sleep apnea may be poor drivers with a high accident rate and a high incidence of "near-miss" vehicular incidents. Because drivers with untreated sleep apnea may cause a large number of preventable automobile accidents, physicians have specific duties involving these drivers. First, physicians must try to identify impaired drivers with sleep apnea before they have an accident; routinely asking patients about loud snoring and hypersomnolence may help identify these impaired drivers. Second, physicians must consider the diagnosis of sleep apnea when examining patients who fall asleep while driving. Next, physicians must warn their patients with sleep apnea about the risks of driving with untreated sleep apnea. Finally, physicians must treat any seriously impaired driver with sleep apnea and keep these patients from driving until they can receive successful treatment. 
Chronic Cryptosporidium parvum infections in congenitally immunodeficient SCID and nude mice. Severe combined immune deficient (SCID) and athymic National Institutes of Health (NIH)-III (bg/nu/xid) mice were evaluated for susceptibility to Cryptosporidium parvum infections as neonates and as adults after challenge with inocula of 5 x 10(4) and 1 x 10(6) oocysts/mouse, respectively. SCID and NIH-III nude mice developed chronic infections that persisted over 12 weeks. Cryptosporidial organisms were observed in the small and large intestines of all mice. Colonization of the gallbladder and hepatobiliary duct epithelium occurred in a majority of the NIH-III nude mice and a smaller number of the SCID mice. Severe infections in both mouse strains were associated with clinical deterioration followed by death. Signs in these mice included dehydration, icterus, and emaciation. Deaths apparently resulted from hepatic dysfunction. Control mice experienced transient infections with no clinical signs. Immunodeficient mice should prove useful in studies of disease pathogenesis and in evaluating potential anticryptosporidial agents. 
Basaloid monomorphic adenomas. Monomorphic adenomas can be divided into basaloid and nonbasaloid type. With the exception of the canalicular adenoma, the basaloid monomorphic adenomas are preponderantly tumors of the major salivary glands, most often the parotid gland. The dermal analogue monomorphic adenomas, so named because of their histologic similarity to eccrine tumors of the skin, are a unique subset of the basaloid adenomas. They are often multifocal, recur frequently, may undergo malignant change, and can be part of a salivary-cutaneous tumor diathesis. 
Increased all-cause and cardiac morbidity and mortality associated with the diagonal earlobe crease: a prospective cohort study. PURPOSE: To ascertain whether the diagonal earlobe crease (ELC) is associated prospectively with future death or cardiac events over 8 years of follow-up in two sets of patients: those with known coronary artery disease (CAD) and those without evidence for CAD. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We performed a prospective, observational study of 108 patients in four cohorts (each matched for age, sex, and race, but differing in the presence or absence of both a diagonal ELC and CAD in 1979 to 1982). Follow-up information was gathered by telephone interviews, and dates and causes of death were determined by reference to death certificates (n = 48), hospital records (n = 9), or attending physician statements (n = 1). RESULTS: During 8 to 10 years of follow-up, 58 of the patients had died. Patients with ELCs had poorer survival rates than those without creases, by stratified log-rank test (p = 0.006 for the cohorts thought not to have CAD, and p = 0.058 for those with CAD). Cardiac death rates (due to acute myocardial infarction, "sudden cardiac death," or heart failure) were also higher for patients with ELCs: 8.0 versus 0.9 cardiac deaths per 100 patient-years (p less than 0.001) in patients without CAD at entry, and 11.7 versus 3.7 cardiac deaths per 100 patient-years (p = 0.008) in patients with CAD in 1979 to 1982. Cardiac event rates (cardiac death, nonfatal myocardial infarction, or coronary artery bypass surgery) were also higher in those with ELCs: 10.4 versus 1.4 events per 100 patient-years (p less than 0.001) for those without known CAD, and 15.8 versus 5.7 events per 100 patient-years (p = 0.009) for those with CAD. CONCLUSION: These results suggest that a diagonal ELC is associated with increased all-cause and cardiac morbidity and mortality. Patients with ELCs may be at higher risk for coronary events, and might be especially cautioned to control or reduce other cardiac risk factors, even if currently without diagnostic evidence of CAD. 
Intratumoral DNA content variability. A study of non-small cell lung cancer. Twenty-eight resected primary non-small cell lung carcinomas were studied for intratumoral DNA variability by flow cytometry (FCM). Three separate tissue specimens from each resected tumor were divided equally for FCM analysis and histologic evaluation. FCM analysis also was performed on fine-needle aspirates (FNAs) from the center of the resected tumor. Histologically, there were 8 squamous carcinomas, 19 adenocarcinomas, and 1 large cell carcinoma. Twenty-three tumors (82%) were aneuploid, and 5 (18%) were diploid. The DNA index in aneuploid neoplasms ranged from 0.91 to 3.30 (mean, 1.64). All 5 diploid and 19 (83%) of the (23) aneuploid neoplasms manifested intratumoral DNA stability. Four (17%) of the aneuploid tumors showed regional DNA heterogeneity expressed as additional stemlines in at least one sample. The FNA yield was sufficient in 21 cases and inadequate for complete analysis in 7 cases. In general, good correlation between FNA and tissue analysis was obtained. However, in three of the aneuploid neoplasms, FNA materials did not reveal an additional nondominant stemline, as noted in the tissue specimens. The authors attribute this finding to a dilutional factor in the aspiration material. The authors conclude that most non-small cell lung carcinomas express DNA stability; FNA provides adequate cellular material for FCM in most cases. 
Balloon angioplasty for recurrent coarctation of aorta. Immediate and long-term results BACKGROUND. As angioplasty techniques have been refined and larger low-profile balloons developed, a nonsurgical approach to recoarctation has become available. Several reports have documented both the efficacy and safety of this procedure. However, there are little data available on the long-term follow-up of these patients. This report details the initial results and long-term evaluation of both the relief of obstruction and the presence of hypertension after balloon angioplasty for recurrent coarctation. METHODS AND RESULTS. Balloon angioplasty for recurrent coarctation of the aorta was performed 29 times in 26 patients at a median age of 4 years and 9 months (range, 4 months to 29 years), with eight patients less than 1 year old. Initial surgical techniques were end-to-end anastomosis in 11 patients, subclavian flap aortoplasty in 11 patients, and patch aortoplasty in four patients. Angioplasty was performed at a median interval of 2 years and 7 months (range, 4 months to 23 years) after surgery. Mean peak systolic pressure difference across the coarctation decreased from 40.0 +/- 16.8 to 10.3 +/- 9.5 mm Hg (p less than 0.05) after the initial angioplasty, and mean diameter of the aortic lumen at the coarctation site increased from 5.8 +/- 3.5 to 9.0 +/- 4.3 mm (p less than 0.05). There was no mortality, and only one patient developed an aneurysm (4%). Three patients underwent repeat angioplasty for a pressure difference of more than 20 mm Hg. Long-term follow-up is available on 24 of 26 patients with a mean follow-up of 42 +/- 24 months (range, 12-88 months). Mean peak systolic pressure difference across the area of coarctation decreased from 40.3 +/- 17.4 before angioplasty to 8.5 +/- 8.3 mm Hg after final angioplasty (p less than 0.05) and 7.5 +/- 7.5 mm Hg at follow-up. Mean peak systolic blood pressure in the upper extremities decreased from 133.1 +/- 14.9 before angioplasty to 111.1 +/- 14.1 mm Hg at long-term follow-up (p less than 0.05). CONCLUSIONS. Balloon angioplasty should be considered the treatment of choice for relief of recurrent aortic coarctation. 
Health risks of foreign travel. Preparing adults for jaunts abroad. Preparing adult travelers for journeys abroad can be challenging and rewarding. Prevention is the cornerstone of a safe, enjoyable trip. Patient education and commonsense precautions may well prevent infection or disease. Prophylaxis for diarrhea and malaria could save one day of illness or inconvenience on an expensive trip or may save a traveler's life. And the Loa loa worm? The nurse fortunately waited until it crawled from under her cornea. Then it was gently teased from under the bulbar conjunctiva. 
Diagnosis and treatment of muscle contraction (tension-type) headaches. Acute tension-type headache is a very common condition that rarely is a problem in treatment. Chronic tension-type headache, however, is often a difficult therapeutic problem. The pathogenesis is not well understood, but both peripheral muscle contraction and central pain-modulating systems are probably involved. Therapy usually works best when multiple techniques are used, including pharmacologic, psychological, and physiologic modalities. 
Propranolol in the management of recurrent migraine: a meta-analytic review. We used meta-analytic statistical techniques to synthesize findings from studies that evaluated propranolol HCI for the prevention of recurrent migraine (2,403 treated patients). The modal migraine sufferer treated in these studies was a female, about 37 years of age, who suffered from common (rather than classical) migraines and reported a 17-year history of problem migraines. The modal treatment was 160 mg. propranolol per day. Meta-analysis revealed that, on average, propranolol yielded a 44% reduction in migraine activity when daily headache recordings were used to assess treatment outcome, and a 65% reduction in migraine activity when less conservative measures (e.g., clinical ratings of improvement, global patient reports) were used. Meta-analysis thus revealed substantial support for short-term effectiveness of propranolol. However, little information was available concerning the long-term effectiveness of propranolol. 
Increased cisplatin tissue levels with prolonged arterial infusion in the rat. Prolonged arterial infusions of cisplatin (DDP) have been effective in the treatment of regionally confined malignancies. It is unclear whether the route or schedule of DDP administration was responsible for the observed therapeutic benefit. To resolve this issue, tumor and normal tissue platinum (Pt) levels were determined in rats bearing hind-limb rat mammary tumors after intravenous (IV) and intra-arterial (IA) DDP infusions of constant dose and varying lengths. Infusions of DDP at 6 mg/kg were conducted IA over 30 minutes, and 3, 6, 24, and 48 hours and IV over 30 minutes and 48 hours. After infusion, Pt concentrations in solubilized tissue homogenates were measured by flameless atomic absorption spectroscopy. Maximum tumor Pt levels were seen after 48-hour IA infusion (29.3 micrograms Pt/mg tissue). IA infusions of 24 hours or less resulted in significantly lower Pt levels. Maximum tumor Pt concentration after IV administration was only 0.98 micrograms/mg tissue (48-hour infusion). Muscle Pt levels adjacent to the tumor were highest in the IA infused extremities, but at the 48-hour interval, were 53-fold less than tumor levels. Tumor and adjacent muscle Pt levels were not significantly different from each other after IV administration. This study provides pharmacologic evidence that lengthening the duration of IA DDP infusion increases tumor levels of Pt over that of IV or rapid IA administrations. The benefit of prolonged IA DDP infusions is dependent upon both route and schedule of drug administration. 
Acute and chronic hypothermia in a man with spinal cord injury: environmental and pharmacologic causes. It is well known that people with spinal cord injuries can develop hypothermia when exposed to an unusually cold environment. Hypothermia can also develop during inpatient rehabilitation, particularly as a side effect of certain medications. We present a patient with C4 incomplete spinal cord injury whose core body temperature was chronically subnormal, and who developed acute hypothermia on several occasions during inpatient rehabilitation. The results of tests of his autonomic function were abnormal. Acute hypothermia (core temperature approximately 34C) was induced when he was challenged with nifedipine. The serum level of phenytoin became elevated to toxic levels during two episodes of acute hypothermia, but the serum level of carbamazepine did not change appreciably. This case demonstrates that people with spinal cord injuries are at risk for hypothermia, that hypothermia can be induced by nifedipine, and that significant thermal challenges can occur during routine inpatient rehabilitation. In addition, hypothermia appears to affect the metabolism of phenytoin. 
Survival in patients with primary pulmonary hypertension. Results from a national prospective registry. OBJECTIVE: To characterize mortality in persons diagnosed with primary pulmonary hypertension and to investigate factors associated with survival. DESIGN: Registry with prospective follow-up. SETTING: Thirty-two clinical centers in the United States participating in the Patient Registry for the Characterization of Primary Pulmonary Hypertension supported by the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute. PATIENTS: Patients (194) diagnosed at clinical centers between 1 July 1981 and 31 December 1985 and followed through 8 August 1988. MEASUREMENTS: At diagnosis, measurements of hemodynamic variables, pulmonary function, and gas exchange variables were taken in addition to information on demographic variables, medical history, and life-style. Patients were followed for survival at 6-month intervals. MAIN RESULTS: The estimated median survival of these patients was 2.8 years (95% Cl, 1.9 to 3.7 years). Estimated single-year survival rates were as follows: at 1 year, 68% (Cl, 61% to 75%); at 3 years, 48% (Cl, 41% to 55%); and at 5 years, 34% (Cl, 24% to 44%). Variables associated with poor survival included a New York Heart Association (NYHA) functional class of III or IV, presence of Raynaud phenomenon, elevated mean right atrial pressure, elevated mean pulmonary artery pressure, decreased cardiac index, and decreased diffusing capacity for carbon monoxide (DLCO). Drug therapy at entry or discharge was not associated with survival duration. CONCLUSIONS: Mortality was most closely associated with right ventricular hemodynamic function and can be characterized by means of an equation using three variables: mean pulmonary artery pressure, mean right atrial pressure, and cardiac index. Such an equation, once validated prospectively, could be used as an adjunct in planning treatment strategies and allocating medical resources. 
Cervical necrotizing fasciitis of odontogenic origin. Necrotizing fasciitis is a severe soft tissue infection caused by both aerobic and anaerobic bacteria and is characterized by a rapid extension along fascial planes and by necrosis of soft tissues. The disease rarely occurs in the head and neck. Three cases of necrotizing fasciitis of the neck after a dental infection are presented. The difficulty in diagnosing the early stage of this condition in relation to other soft tissue infections of odontogenic origin in the neck is discussed. The importance of an early diagnosis followed by an appropriate combination of medical, surgical, and dental treatment is emphasized. 
Longitudinal study of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system in hypertensive pregnant women: deviations related to the development of superimposed preeclampsia. A prospective longitudinal study of 25 pregnant women (30 pregnancies) with chronic hypertension, a group prone to development of preeclampsia, was conducted to explore the relationship between the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system and the development of superimposed preeclampsia. In women with chronic hypertension in whom preeclampsia did not develop (17 pregnancies), blood pressure decreased and the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system was stimulated, beginning in the first trimester and continuing throughout pregnancy as found previously in normotensive pregnant women (n = 58). Plasma estradiol and progesterone levels also increased progressively. In women with chronic hypertension in whom preeclampsia developed (13 pregnancies), blood pressure decreased and the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system was stimulated in the first trimester as in the other groups. However, later in pregnancy significant differences were observed. Blood pressure began to rise in the second trimester. Initially the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system remained stimulated, but in the early third trimester, when preeclampsia was diagnosed, plasma renin activity and urine aldosterone excretion decreased, and atrial natriuretic factor increased. These data provide information that may be useful in the recognition of superimposed preeclampsia, and in the investigation of its pathogenesis. 
An unusual presentation of salmonellal aortitis. Our patient represents what we believe to be the first documented case of Salmonella choleraesuis aortitis presenting as a salmonellal empyema in an elderly diabetic man. Although S choleraesuis often causes septicemia, its absence should not lead one to forget the pathogenic nature of and high mortality associated with this organism. Aggressive efforts must be made to search for endovascular infection, because cures can be achieved only with surgical intervention and prolonged antibiotic therapy. 
Traumatic asphyxia and blunt cardiac injury: case report and selected review. An unusual case is described featuring traumatic asphyxia and blunt cardiac injury. An association between these is possible but not previously described. Coronary artery contusion, malignant arrhythmias, and a normal electrocardiogram were also noted and discussed. The relevant literature was reviewed. 
Insulin resistance and hypertension. While clinicians have long recognized the apparent increased prevalence of hypertension among diabetics, sophisticated epidemiological analyses begun in the early 1970s have established that hypertensive individuals are more prone to hyperinsulinemia and glucose intolerance than normotensive individuals. Subsequently, the several hypertensinogenic effects of insulin were carefully studied in a number of laboratories. Most recently, the association of these two relatively common cardiovascular risk factors, hypertension and insulin resistance, was broadened to include lipid abnormalities, namely, increased concentrations of very low density lipoprotein triglycerides and decreased concentrations of high density lipoprotein cholesterol. These abnormalities, all of which appear in association more commonly than would be expected by chance, clearly predispose affected individuals to increased cardiovascular risk. This review summarizes our current understanding of the mechanisms underlying the relations between insulin resistance and hypertension and focuses discussion on the role of insulin as a common link between them. It concludes with recommendations, based on today's knowledge, for behavioral and therapeutic interventions aimed at the prevention of increased cardiovascular risk. 
Direct mechanical ventricular actuation for cardiac arrest in humans. A clinical feasibility trial Direct mechanical ventricular actuation (DMVA) is a non-blood-contacting method of biventricular cardiac massage which may be applied expediently for total circulatory support. The purpose of this study was to assess the feasibility of DMVA application for patients suffering refractory cardiac arrest. Following informed consent, DMVA was applied in 22 patients. Vascular access for hemodynamic monitoring was possible in only 12 patients, whose outcomes serve as the basis for this report. The mean age of the patients was 48.2 +/- 4.2 years (seven men; five women). The average time from witnessed cardiac arrest to DMVA application was 81 +/- 9 minutes. Application took less than two minutes from the time of skin incision and resulted in immediate hemodynamic improvement. Systolic and diastolic blood pressures averaged 78 +/- 4 and 41 +/- 4 mm Hg, respectively, with a mean cardiac output of 3.14 +/- 0.18 L/min during a mean of 228 +/- 84 minutes of circulatory support (range, 25 minutes to 18 hours). In selected cases the device was temporarily removed for 2 to 3 minutes and open-chest cardiac massage (OCCM) performed at similar compression rates. DMVA increased arterial pressures 65 percent and cardiac output 190 percent compared to OCCM. Initial arterial pH (7.12 +/- 0.04) improved by the time the device was removed (7.24 +/- 0.05). Serum lactate levels decreased from 18.0 +/- 2.3 mumol/L to 14.9 +/- 2.9 mumol/L. Four patients were successfully defibrillated: two had inadequate cardiac function and died within 1 h, and two were successfully resuscitated, but later died from cardiac failure and respiratory insufficiency. Another patient regained normal neurologic function during DMVA and was successfully bridged to cardiopulmonary bypass for emergent coronary artery bypass grafting, but died later from myocardial infarction. There were only two complications: (1) a cardiac laceration during pericardiotomy (1/22 patients); and (2) a ventricular rupture during OCCM (1/22). No complication resulted from the device. We found DMVA to be a feasible method for acute cardiovascular stabilization in victims suffering refractory cardiac arrest. Human clinical trials employing earlier DMVA application are required to determine its resuscitative potential. 
Effects of preoperative electrical stimulability and historical factors on performance with multichannel cochlear implant. We investigated the relationship between results of preoperative transtympanic electrical promontory stimulation, duration of deafness, postoperative implanted psychophysical results, and postoperative speech and speech sound recognition as indicated by a battery of five tests. Our subjects were 10 patients implanted with the Cochlear Corporation multielectrode implant, 1 year postimplantation, with a minimum of 17 active electrodes programmed in the bipolar + 1 mode. The results indicated that preoperative promontory thresholds, the slope of the threshold function, and the duration of auditory deprivation are excellent predictors of postoperative speech and speech sound recognition in the auditory (processor alone) mode. These results have significant implications for patient selection and counseling. 
Diagnosing and treating common oral pathologies. When the physician is confronted with an oral pathologic condition in a child, the adage "common things happen commonly" should be applied. Congenital lesions such as palatal and alveolar cysts occur in almost 50% of newborns. Developmental conditions such as Fordyce granules and retrocuspid papillae are found in most children. Localized soft-tissue enlargements commonly seen in young children include the parulis, mucocele, papilloma, and inflammatory gingival tumors. In addition, soft-tissue pathologies and discomfort associated with herpesvirus infections or recurrent aphthous ulcerations often present as a chief complaint. The physician's knowledge and treatment recommendations for common oral pathologies should be an integral component to the overall medical management of infants, children, and adolescents. 
Exercise. Practical treatment for the patient with depression and chronic fatigue. Exercise should be part of everyone's lifestyle, but may be a particularly important part of the treatment of patients with depression and chronic fatigue. It will reliably and consistently decrease feelings of tiredness and despondency, although it is seldom sufficient as a sole treatment intervention for such patients. When initiating an exercise program, a baseline assessment should be followed by an exercise prescription and an appropriate degree of patient education about exercise physiology. This should be followed, in addition to other treatment interventions, by regular follow-up visits to make appropriate adjustments; provide encouragement and motivation to continue; monitor weight, body fat, and nutrition; and assess the effectiveness of the program on the underlying problem. 
Extrapleural pneumonectomy, chemotherapy, and radiotherapy in the treatment of diffuse malignant pleural mesothelioma. Malignant pleural mesothelioma has been considered a uniformly fatal disease associated with a median survival of 4 to 18 months. Extrapleural pneumonectomy alone has proved disappointing in the treatment of this disease, as have chemotherapy and radiotherapy. From 1980 to 1990, 31 patients with pleural mesothelioma underwent multimodality therapy that included extrapleural pneumonectomy with resection of the pericardium and diaphragm. The age of the patients was 53.4 +/- 8.6 years; 26 were male. All patients had the pathologic diagnosis reviewed before treatment. At thoracotomy six patients had residual (unresectable) gross disease, and in 23 there was histologic evidence of disease at the resection margin. The perioperative morbidity and mortality rates were 19% and 6%, respectively. The mean length of hospital stay for the 29 patients who survived the operation was 10.9 +/- 3.5 days. Postoperatively 26 patients received cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, and cis-platinum chemotherapy with or without radiotherapy. The survival rates were 70% at 1 year and 48% at 2 years. Trends toward improved survival in the patients with complete resections approached but did not reach statistical significance. These data suggest that this multimodality protocol can be administered with acceptable morbidity and mortality. Prospective trials are justified to further clarify the role of this approach. 
Oncogene expression and oral cancer. Cancer of the oral cavity remains a major problem in the United States as well as in many other countries, some of which record as much as 30% of all their cancers to be in the oral region. Despite numerous advances in the fields of epidemiology and etiology, little is known of the molecular basis of oral cancer. Advances in the field of oncogenes have produced a tool to study the different stages of carcinogenesis, including transition from premalignant to malignant stages. These strategies have direct relevance to oral cancer where the premalignant stage is well defined. Preliminary studies into the expression and function of oncogenes suggest abnormalities including individual and multiple amplification of three or more types of these genes. This review briefly describes the concept of oncogenes, and their possible role in the development of neoplasia and specifically on studies in oral cancer. 
Effect of antibiotics on food intake and absorption of nutrients for children with diarrhea due to Shigella. The effect of antibiotic therapy on intake of food and absorption of nutrients for 19 male children aged 1-5 years with suspected shigella infection was studied. The children were admitted to the hospital with acute diarrhea, high fever, abdominal pain, and greater than or equal to 25 red blood cells and white blood cells per high-power field in the stool. Microbiologic diagnosis was made within 48 hours of admission. On the basis of clinical and microbiologic criteria, children were classified as having mild or severe infection. Ten children with mild infection did not receive antibiotics, whereas nine children with severe infection were treated with ampicillin. After the children were rehydrated, a 72-hour balance study was carried out during the acute stage of infection with Shigella and was repeated 2 weeks after recovery. The levels of consumption of food and absorption of nutrients were estimated. During the acute stage of infection, such levels were higher for the children treated with antibiotics than for the untreated group. During the recovery phase, the levels of intake of food and absorption of nutrients were equal for both groups. Thus, children who are treated with appropriate antibiotics not only may recover from infection with Shigella more rapidly, but they also may be able to absorb nutrients more efficiently. 
Spontaneous common iliac arteriovenous fistula manifested by acute renal failure: a case report. Arteriovenous fistulas between the common iliac vessels resulting from spontaneous rupture of aneurysms are rare, with only 31 cases having been reported since 1971. Clinical diagnosis is possible when a unique set of findings is present, namely high-output cardiac failure, a pulsatile abdominal mass associated with a bruit or thrill, and unilateral arterial insufficiency or venous engorgement. Recently, with advancements in diagnostic techniques, the number of cases in which an arteriovenous fistula is found between the common iliac vessels has increased. Diagnosis can be difficult, however, as in the case of one of our patients in whom the predominant sign was acute renal failure. Other reports of renal failure or impairment in the presence of a common iliac fistula have also appeared. Awareness of this phenomenon can help the physician to establish the diagnosis when one or more of the classic signs are absent. Prompt diagnosis and surgical management have contributed to the high incidence of survival in patients with arteriovenous fistulas between the common iliac vessels. 
Insulinopenia as a risk factor in hepatectomy and its resolution by intraportal insulin administration. Insulopenia is a possible risk factor in hepatectomy, especially since insulin has been recognized to have a significant hepatotrophic effect. In the current study, insulinopenic patients were defined as those who showed abnormally low insulinogenic indexes (less than 0.6) on the oral glucose tolerance test, compared with those in 22 normal volunteers (1.16 +/- 0.57, mean +/- SD). The insulinogenic index represents the ratio of the cumulative enhancement of immunoreactive insulin (IRI) to the glucose level (delta IRI/delta glucose). Surgical outcomes were studied retrospectively in 17 insulinopenic patients who underwent hepatic resections from January 1987 to July 1988. Six of 10 patients in the major hepatic resection group showed postoperative complications, 5 of whom experienced hepatic failure resulting in hospital death. By contrast, all seven patients in the minor resection group tolerated the operations. From August 1988, intraportal insulin was prospectively administered as a posthepatectomy management technique to nine patients, eight of whom were diagnosed as insulinopenic. These patients all tolerated major hepatic resections including four hepatic vascular exclusion procedures with veno-venous bypass. In conclusion, the current study indicates that insulinopenic patients are high-risk candidates for major hepatic resection and that intraportal insulin administration has a beneficial effect on the postoperative management of these patients. 
Sugar in the reduction of incarcerated prolapsed bowel. Report of two cases. Incarcerated, prolapsed rectum, colostomies, and ileostomies, when viable, may be reduced using ordinary table sugar. The placing of sugar granules on the incarcerated bowel results in a decrease in tissue edema and spontaneous bowel reduction. The technique, case reports, and a review of the literature are herein reported. 
Modification of the Bankart reconstruction with a suture anchor. Report of a new technique. We assessed the effectiveness of a new suture anchor that has been designed to anchor sutures into a blind, straight hole drilled in bone. The strength of fixation in glenoid bone is 67 N for the No. 0 anchor and suture, and 82 N for the No. 2 device with suture. During 1988 and 1989, 32 patients underwent a modified Bankart reconstruction for recurrent anterior glenohumeral instability at two centers as part of a prospective study of this modified technique. There were no complications as a result of the technique. The four surgeons involved agreed that the suture anchor simplified the procedure. Seventeen patients have been reviewed, with more than 1 year followup. Ninety-four percent had good to excellent results according to the Bankart rating scale. There was one recurrent dislocation in a football player. 
Clinical implications of late proven patency after successful coronary angioplasty. BACKGROUND. The introduction of percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA) has changed the pattern of intervention in coronary artery disease. However, the long-term results in patients undergoing successful, elective, native-vessel PTCA are not yet fully characterized. Because the healing and subsequent proliferative response after angioplasty are time related, it was the purpose of the present study to determine the long-term outcome in patients whose dilated arteries have been demonstrated to be patent 4-12 months after successful, uncomplicated PTCA. METHODS AND RESULTS. The patients were grouped on the basis of the 4-12 month catheterization into those whose vessels were angiographically "normal" or had luminal irregularities only at the PTCA sites (396 patients), those whose vessels also had luminal irregularities elsewhere with or without PTCA site luminal irregularities (680 patients), and those with significant obstructive disease (more than 50% diameter narrowing) at sites other than the PTCA sites (426 patients). Of 1,502 such patients, long-term follow-up was available in 1,491. At the time of the original angioplasty, the normal patients had a 1.8% incidence of multivessel disease; luminal irregularity patients, 9.4%; and obstructive disease patients, 58.7%. At angiographic restudy, 16.4% of the obstructive disease patients continued to have multivessel disease. The patients were followed for the events of death, myocardial infarction, coronary surgery, and repeat PTCA. The 6-year survival rate was 95%; cardiac survival, 96%; and freedom from all events, 65%. The strongest correlate of events during follow-up was the angiographic status of the undilated segments. At 6 years, freedom from cardiac events was noted in 77% of the normal group, 61% of the luminal irregularity group, and 55% of the obstructive disease group. Diabetes and hypertension were also independent correlates of events. CONCLUSIONS. Results from the present study show that associated disease in undilated segments is a strong predictor of late events in patients after successful, uncomplicated, reatenosis-free PTCA. However, the need for further revascularization was frequent even in patients without obstructive disease. Completeness of revascularization is appropriate when possible, and limiting progression of coronary disease at sites remote from those dilated should improve on these late results. 
Eosinophiluria in atheroembolic renal disease. PURPOSE AND PATIENTS: Eosinophiluria has been reported in acute interstitial nephritis and other renal diseases, but its presence in atheroembolic renal disease (AERD) has not been previously established. AERD has been identified as a cause of acute and chronic renal failure, particularly in elderly patients with advanced atherosclerosis and in those patients who have undergone manipulation or intervention of the abdominal aorta, renal artery, or coronary artery. The definitive diagnosis is made by renal biopsy. However, many patients are too acutely ill to tolerate renal biopsy and, in recent years, peripheral eosinophilia, hypocomplementemia, and thrombocytopenia have been recognized in association with AERD. Previous studies have reported that AERD is associated with an inactive renal sediment and an absence of urine eosinophils. We reviewed our experience over a 4-year period with 24 patients with renal biopsy-proven AERD. RESULTS: Urine eosinophils were evaluated in nine patients to help determine the cause of their renal deterioration. Seven of these patients presented with evidence of vascular disease. Three patients had procedures involving manipulation of the abdominal aorta. Physical examination revealed findings of atheroembolism in three of nine patients. Overall, eight of nine patients had a positive Hansel's stain for eosinophiluria. Six of eight patients had more than 5% of their urinary white cell count as eosinophils. The reason for failure of previous studies to detect eosinophiluria in AERD is unclear but may have been related to the use of Wright's stain instead of Hansel's stain. CONCLUSION: In the evaluation of acute renal insufficiency, eosinophiluria may indicate AERD in addition to the other known causes for this finding. 
Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and the risk for chronic renal disease OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the risk for chronic renal disease associated with regular use of nonaspirin nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). DESIGN: Multicenter case-control study. PATIENTS: Patients were 554 North Carolina residents (age range, 30 to 79 years) hospitalized between 1980 and 1982 with a discharge diagnosis indicating newly diagnosed chronic renal dysfunction and a serum creatinine level consistently at or above 130 mumol/L (1.5 mg/dL). Controls were 516 persons chosen randomly by telephone screening (if younger than 65 years of age) and from listings of Medicare recipients (if 65 years of age or older), frequency-matched to patients by age, race, sex, and proximity to study hospitals. MEASUREMENTS: Data on use of prescription NSAIDs and other analgesics before 1980, other risk factors, and potential confounders were obtained by telephone interviews. Patients were classified by frequency and duration of use; daily users were those who took an NSAID for at least 360 consecutive days. MAIN RESULTS: A twofold risk for chronic renal disease was associated with previous daily use of NSAIDs (adjusted odds ratio, 2.1; 95% Cl, 1.1 to 4.1). Increased risk was predominantly limited to men older than 65 years, for whom the odds ratio for daily use was 10.0 (Cl, 1.2 to 82.7) after adjusting for use of other analgesics. In other age-sex groups, the risk associated with NSAID use tended to be increased among those with heart disease or other factors that might indicate compromised renal circulation. These findings did not result from confounding by known renal disease risk factors and were not readily explained by potential biases. CONCLUSIONS: Regular use of NSAIDs may increase the risk for chronic kidney disease in some high-risk groups. With the recent over-the-counter availability and increasing popularity of NSAIDs, the possibility of an increased risk for chronic renal disease associated with their use may warrant further scrutiny. 
The fixateur interne in the reduction and stabilization of thoracolumbar spine fractures in patients with neurologic deficit. A prospective analysis of 80 consecutive patients who underwent stabilization with the fixateur interne for thoracolumbar spine fractures with complete or incomplete paraplegia was undertaken to determine the results after bone healing. Follow-up examination at an average of 35 months (minimum, 24 months) included all 76 patients still alive. One patient died from a pulmonary embolism, and there were three other unrelated deaths. The mean wedge angle of the fractured vertebra was corrected from 17.4 degrees to 7.9 degrees and remained almost unchanged after 1 year (8.4 degrees) and 2 years, or 1 year after implant removal (8.2 degrees). Also, the wedge index showed nearly no bony loss of correction within the reduced fracture vertebra (0.61 before operation, 0.83 after operation; 0.81 at 1-year follow-up, 0.81 at 2-year follow-up, respectively). In the kyphosis angle measured by the Cobb method, however, there was a loss of 5 degrees after implant removal within the next year because of the disc space collapsed above the fractured vertebra. In this series, 70% of the cases had no formal fusion. All 29 cases of translational displacement of 4-36 mm were anatomically reduced. No neurologic or vascular complication occurred. Posterolateral fusion or transpedicular interbody fusion in the disrupted disc space is recommended. 
Somato-somatic referred pain caused by suprasegmental spinal cord tumor. Tactile stimulation of a coin-sized area in a T-2 dermatome consistently triggered a lancinating pain in the ipsilateral C-8 dermatome in a 38-year-old woman. The SEP and an MRI led to a diagnosis of a tumor at the left cervico-medullary junction, much higher than the clinically suspected level. Surgical exploration revealed an exophytic glioma, and the pain was abolished postoperatively. Ephaptic transmission at the tumor site was suspected as a pathophysiologic mechanism. 
Nasogastric feeding at home: acceptability and safety. A questionnaire was administered to 70 families with experience of home enteral nutrition. All but one patient received at least some of their feeding overnight. During 11,041 patient days of home enteral nutrition, no serious complications were seen. Sleep disturbance was common, however, and affected 59 parents and 35 children. A nocturnal cough or 'chestiness' were noted in 10 children suggesting occult gastro-oesophageal reflux. Enteral feeding disposables were not prescribable by general practitioners, and funding for the equipment was inadequate in the hospital and community. The mean time to arrange funding for equipment was eight months (range two weeks to two years). Parental views on home enteral nutrition were positive and none felt that its disadvantages outweighed the benefits. Altogether 35 children were described as being more happy and active. Given adequate preparation and continued support at home, parents can manage home enteral nutrition safely and effectively. 
The role of beta 2-microglobulin in peptide binding by class I molecules. Efficient transport of class I major histocompatibility complex molecules to the cell surface requires association of the class I heavy chain with endogenous peptide and the class I light chain, beta 2-microglobulin (beta 2M). A mutant cell line deficient in beta 2M transports low amounts of nonpeptide-associated heavy chains to the cell surface that can associate with exogenously provided beta 2M and synthetic peptide antigens. Normal beta 2M-sufficient cells grown in serum-free media devoid of beta 2M also require an exogenous source of beta 2M to efficiently bind synthetic peptide. Thus, class I molecules on normal cells do not spontaneously bind or exchange peptides. 
Neuroleptic malignant syndrome: occurrence in a child after reconstructive surgery. The occurrence of the rare but potentially fatal neuroleptic malignant syndrome must be considered by the surgeon treating a patient who develops hyperthermia, mental abnormalities, autonomic instability, and muscle rigidity after exposure to phenothiazines or other neuroleptic drugs. The dopamine agonist bromocriptine appears to be the treatment of choice in adults and seemed to be effective and well tolerated in our patient. Although the syndrome cannot be prevented, recognition is crucial, since effective general and specific therapy is available. Differentiating neuroleptic malignant syndrome from malignant hyperthermia allows early appropriate treatment with bromocriptine. 
Celiomesenteric anomaly and aneurysm: clinical and etiologic features. The development of aneurysmal disease involving the rarely encountered celiomesenteric anomaly is extremely unusual. Aneurysmal disease of the celiac or superior mesenteric arteries is itself an extremely uncommon finding, accounting for less than 10% of all visceral artery aneurysms. The existence of aneurysmal disease involving a celiomesenteric anomaly has been alluded to only briefly in two previous clinical reports. We review the case of a young woman with aneurysmal disease involving a common celiomesenteric trunk. The patient underwent excision of the aneurysm with successful vascular reconstruction. Although extremely unusual, the development of this extremely rare lesion can be predicted on the basis of specific etiologic theories. Variations in the patterns of embryologic formation of the visceral arteries account for the development of celiomesenteric anomalies, whereas atherosclerosis, medial degeneration, and infection lead to the development of most visceral aneurysms. Surgical treatment of celiac or mesenteric aneurysms is almost always indicated. Awareness of potential vascular anomalies and patterns of collateral circulation are necessary for appropriate surgical intervention. 
Thymic tumorigenesis induced by overexpression of p56lck. The lck gene encodes a membrane-associated protein tyrosine kinase (p56lck) that is believed to participate in lymphocyte-specific signal transduction pathways. To investigate the function of this molecule, transgenic mice were generated carrying the wild-type lck gene or a mutated lck gene encoding a constitutively activated form of p56lck (p56lckF505). Transgene expression in thymocytes was achieved in each case using the lck proximal promoter element. Mice expressing high levels of either p56lckF505 or p56lckY505 reproducibly developed thymic tumors. The sensitivity of thymocytes to p56lck-induced transformation suggests that disturbances in lck expression may contribute to the pathogenesis of some human neoplastic diseases. 
Nutritional support in the injured patient. After injury, the stress reaction causes hypermetabolism and consequent depletion of the body's tissues. Nutritional support should be begun early and should be given by the enteral route if possible. New developments may allow the modulation of the stress and immune responses by nutrient therapy. 
Intracerebral hemorrhage: external validation and extension of a model for prediction of 30-day survival. We report validation of a previously reported logistic regression model for predicting 30-day survival after supratentorial intracerebral hemorrhage using independent, prospectively collected data. The original model, using initial Glasgow Coma Scale score, hemorrhage size, and pulse pressure, accounted for mortality or survival at 30 days in 92% of patients in the Pilot Stroke Data Bank with a sensitivity of 0.84 and a specificity of 0.96. For external validation, the model was used to predict 30-day status for each patient in the Main Phase Stroke Data Bank for whom complete risk factor information was available. Overall, 90% of patients' outcomes were correctly predicted with a sensitivity of 0.85 and a specificity of 0.92. Two factors not collected in the Pilot Stroke Data Bank, hyperglycemia and intraventricular hemorrhage extension, were assessed to determine if they provided additional predictive information on 30-day mortality. Intraventricular hemorrhage extension contributed significant predictive information in a logistic regression, whereas hyperglycemia did not. The resulting four-factor model with an interaction term (intraventricular hemorrhage extension and Glasgow Coma Scale score) correctly classified the survival status of 94% of patients at 30 days. A more general outcome, death or failure to achieve a "good" Activities of Daily Living Score by one year, was analyzed with respect to the same four factors. The resulting model correctly classified 95% of the patients in the cohort. 
Concentration of digoxin-like immunoreactive substance in patients with preeclampsia and its relation to severity of pregnancy-induced hypertension. Digoxin-like immunoreactive substance (endoxin) was measured in pregnant patients with pregnancy-induced hypertension. The mean level was significantly higher than that in healthy control subjects (p less than 0.001). Patients with eclampsia had a significantly higher concentration than did women with preeclampsia (p less than 0.03). A positive significant correlation was found between concentration of digoxin-like immunoreactive substance and the value of the index of gestosis of von Goecke and Schwabe (p less than 0.03). Analysis of patterns during various kinds of therapy revealed that nitrendipine was most effective in lowering endoxin concentration. Although an insignificant correlation was found between maternal concentration and both birth and placental weights, the compartmental differences observed seem to suggest fetoplacental origin of this substance. 
PEEP inhibits hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction in dogs. The effects of an increase in alveolar pressure on hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction (HPV) have been reported variably. We therefore studied the effects of positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) on pulmonary hemodynamics in 13 pentobarbital-anesthetized dogs ventilated alternately in hyperoxia [inspired O2 fraction (FIO2) 0.4] and in hypoxia (FIO2 0.1). In this intact animal model, HPV was defined as the gradient between hypoxic and hyperoxic transmural (tm) mean pulmonary arterial pressure [Ppa(tm)] at any level of cardiac index (Q). Ppa(tm)/Q plots were constructed with mean transmural left atrial pressure [Pla(tm)] kept constant at approximately 6 mmHg (n = 5 dogs), and Ppa(tm)/PEEP plots were constructed with Q kept constant approximately 2.8 l.min-1.m-2 and Pla(tm) kept constant approximately 8 mmHg (n = 8 dogs). Q was manipulated using a femoral arteriovenous bypass and a balloon catheter in the inferior vena cava. Pla(tm) was held constant by a balloon catheter placed by left thoracotomy in the left atrium. Increasing PEEP, from 0 to 12 Torr by 2-Torr increments, at constant Q and Pla(tm), increased Ppa(tm) from 14 +/- 1 (SE) to 19 +/- 1 mmHg in hyperoxia but did not affect Ppa(tm) (from 22 +/- 2 to 23 +/- 1 mmHg) in hypoxia. Both hypoxia and PEEP, at constant Pla(tm), increased Ppa(tm) over the whole range of Q studied, from 1 to 5 l/min, but more at the highest than at the lowest Q and without change in extrapolated pressure intercepts. Adding PEEP to hypoxia did not affect Ppa(tm) at all levels of Q. 
Corynebacterium parvum versus bacille Calmette-Guerin adjuvant immunotherapy of stage II malignant melanoma. Two separate studies have been reported comparing Corynebacterium parvum and bacille Calmette-Guerin (BCG) as adjuvant immunotherapy for stage II melanoma patients (The Milton S. Hershey Medical Center, 48 patients; Southeastern Cancer Study Group [SECSG], 162 patients). As the criteria for patient selection and drugs used were similar, we have pooled the data to analyze the effects of these two treatments. Both studies used BCG (Tice, Chicago, IL) 3 x 10(8) live organisms per treatment by Tine technique and C parvum (Burroughs-Wellcome, Triangle Park, NC) subcutaneous at a dose of 4 mg/m2 (SECSG) or 5 micrograms/m2 (Hershey) per treatment. The only difference in these studies was the frequency of immunization, with patients in Hershey receiving 22 doses and the SECSG patients receiving 55 doses during the 2-year period of treatment. Kaplan-Meier life-table analysis for the 210 patients shows a prolonged disease-free interval for patients treated with C parvum (P = .02, two-sided Mantel procedure). In similar fashion, patients treated with C parvum had an improved survival rate (from all causes) when compared with BCG-treated patients (P = .012). An analysis of the results for the 170 patients for which the number of positive nodes was available was performed using Cox's model, with nodes as a stratification variable and with covariates of place, treatment, age, and sex. In this analysis, an observed benefit for C parvum on the disease-free interval had a P value of .37 while the benefit of C parvum on the survival times (from all causes) had a P value of .04. When the same analysis was performed using only patients aged younger than 60 years, the observed benefit of C parvum on disease-free interval had a P value of .08 and the benefit of C parvum on survival times (from all causes) had a P value of .008. 
The nigrostriatal dopaminergic system assessed in vivo by positron emission tomography in healthy volunteer subjects and patients with Parkinson's disease. A group of healthy control subjects and patients with Parkinson's disease were investigated using positron emission tomography and two tracers as indicators of different specific properties of the presynaptic dopaminergic system in caudate nucleus and putamen. The first tracer, 6-L-(18F)-fluorodopa, was used as an analog of levodopa to assess its regional brain uptake, conversion into, and retention as dopamine and further metabolites. The second tracer, (11C)-nomifensine was employed as an indicator of striatal monaminergic reuptake sites that are principally dopaminergic. We have used this tracer to assess dopaminergic nerve terminal density. In patients with Parkinson's disease, striatal uptake of both tracers was decreased, putamen being significantly more affected than caudate. Side-to-side differences of uptake in putamen, but not caudate, correlated with corresponding left-right differences of scored clinical motor performance. Both 6-L(18F)-fluorodopa and (11C)-nomifensine tracer uptake in putamen was decreased on average to 40% of normal values, suggesting that a substantial part of the cellular elements of the dopaminergic nigrostriatal system is still intact in living parkinsonian patients. This is in contrast to the generally extreme depletion of endogenous dopamine in the putamen of patients found at postmortem. Our results lend support to the search for drug treatments that protect against further nigrostriatal cell loss and that could be exhibited as soon as the disease manifests clinically. If successful, a sufficient striatal nerve terminal pool would remain so that the effectiveness of levodopa as a dopamine repletor could persist. 
Pathophysiology of cleft lip muscles following the initial surgical repair. Muscle biopsy specimens taken from the upper lip and perialar area during the time of secondary lip revision and studied by histochemical techniques demonstrate persistent connective-tissue and muscle abnormalities even at a distance from the cleft margins. Some of these changes are consistent with surgically induced denervation-reinnervation of muscle groups in the surgical field. Increased amounts of connective tissue also were found, most likely secondary to the original deformity and the subsequent surgical procedures. Both these changes may be important factors in subsequent abnormal growth and development of the underlying midfacial structures. This study also demonstrated the resolution of previously noted mitochondrial abnormalities found in the primary cleft lip patient. 
Role of echocardiography/Doppler in cardiogenic shock: silent mitral regurgitation. Two cases of cardiogenic shock and pulmonary edema due to acute, severe, silent mitral regurgitation are discussed. The mechanism for the mitral regurgitation was papillary muscle rupture in the setting of acute myocardial infarction. Echocardiography established the presence, severity, and cause of the mitral regurgitation and the associated hyperdynamic left ventricular function in the setting of cardiogenic shock. Transesophageal echocardiography is excellent for assessing the mitral valve in critically ill patients in whom transthoracic echocardiography may be inadequate or misleading. This allowed for emergency mitral valve replacement without prolonged attempts at medical stabilization. 
Role of depressive illness in the outcome of treatment of temporomandibular joint pain-dysfunction syndrome. The aim of this study was to assess the role of a depressive illness in the outcome of the treatment of patients with temporomandibular joint pain-dysfunction syndrome. One group was considered psychiatrically normal and the other had a concurrent depressive illness. The latter group was subdivided equally to produce three treatment groups: one undergoing occlusal splint therapy, one receiving antidepressant medication, and the third having a combination of occlusal splint and antidepressant therapy. The results showed clearly that there was a significant difference in response in the nonpsychiatric and combined-therapy depressed groups in comparison with the two depressed groups treated either with occlusal splint or with antidepressant therapy. The combined therapy led to resolution of the painful problem and the depression, whereas the single therapies were only partly successful in relieving the pain-dysfunction syndrome. The preexisting duration of this painful problem did not influence the response to therapy. 
Proximal rupture and intracoronary entrapment of a rotating device during low-speed rotational coronary angioplasty. While attempting to recanalize a right coronary artery obstruction by using a low-speed rotating catheter (Rotacs), proximal rupture of the catheter body occurred with entrapment of the blunt tip in the obstruction. To retrieve the device, it was necessary to severe the guiding catheter and the flexible tube of the Rotacs. At low-speed rotation the flexible segment of the catheter was then pulled back. 
Ceftazidime plus amikacin versus ceftazidime plus vancomycin as empiric therapy in febrile neutropenic children with cancer. Two antibiotic regimens, ceftazidime plus amikacin and ceftazidime plus vancomycin, were compared in a prospective, randomized clinical trial as empiric therapy in febrile granulocytopenic children with cancer. The rate of response was similar in the two groups (66% vs. 77%). The prevalence of secondary gram-negative bacteremia was higher--but not significantly higher--in the group receiving vancomycin. Adverse reactions also occurred more often in the latter group (35% vs. 4%). Mortality did not differ significantly in the two groups. Adjustment for independent predictors of response to treatment by means of multivariate analysis confirmed the lack of any remarkable difference between the responses to the two regimens. We conclude that the use of vancomycin instead of amikacin in combination with ceftazidime does not significantly improve the outcome of treatment of fever and infection in granulocytopenic children with cancer and that the use of vancomycin is associated with an increased frequency of both secondary infections due to gram-negative bacteria and adverse reactions. 
The role of behavioral research in the prevention and management of invasive diarrheas. Reduction in the prevalence of invasive diarrheal diseases can be facilitated by the development of models for systematic examination of behavioral risk factors that are associated with these illnesses. These factors include insufficient use of health care services, noncompliance with treatment, unhygienic behaviors, employment of poor feeding practices for infants and young children, and inappropriate handling of foods. Information on conditions that facilitate or constrain appropriate behaviors will assist the development of programs for the prevention and management of invasive diarrheas. 
External annular prosthesis in repair of biliary tract stricture. A surgical technique for treatment of benign intrahepatic or extrahepatic biliary stenosis is described. It is based on the use of annular prostheses of Teflon placed around the outside of the anastomotic line using appropriate surgical instruments. This procedure leaves the blood supply to the bile duct intact, achieves hermetic apposition of epithelia, and prevents leakage of bile. It eliminates the use of intraductal splints, avoids retraction of scar tissue around the anastomotic zone, and increases or maintains the internal diameter of the biliary duct on the anastomotic line. The technique has been used in 33 patients with follow-up from 1 to 10 years. Excellent results were achieved in 32 patients, with 1 patient having a poor result. The average postoperative hospital stay was only 6 days. 
Amplification of the c-erbB oncogene is associated with malignancy in primary tumours of neuroepithelial tissue. In various primary brain tumours of neuroepithelial tissue recombinant DNA techniques were used to demonstrate changes of the epidermal growth factor receptor gene, which is homologous to the c-erbB oncogene. Twenty-one of 40 grade III/IV tumours, but only 1 of 16 grade I/II tumours were found to contain amplified and/or rearranged c-erbB sequences. This highly significant difference suggest that c-erbB amplification, rearrangement, or both, are important steps in malignant transformation in a subset of patients with neuroepithelial tumours. 
Effect of immersion on residual volume of able-bodied and spinal cord injured males. This study compared residual lung volumes (RV) (oxygen dilution technique) of able-bodied (AB) and spinal cord injured (SCI) males on dry land in air (RVA) and immersed to the neck in water (RVW). The effects of significant differences in RV on calculations of body density (Db) and percent body fat (%BF) were also assessed. The subjects were eight AB, eight paraplegic (PARA), and eight quadriplegic (QUAD) males, ranging in age from 18 to 51 yr. There was a 0.99 correlation (P less than 0.001) between RVA and RVW for AB subjects but no significant correlations between RVA and RVW for the PARA or QUAD groups. RVA in the QUAD group was significantly higher than in the PARA or AB group (P less than 0.003). There were no differences in RVW among the three groups. In the QUAD group, RVA was significantly larger than RVW (P less than 0.001), but there were no significant differences between RVA and RVW for the PARA or AB subjects. Db and %BF did not differ significantly among the PARA or AB groups when calculated at RVA and RVW. However, for QUAD, both Db and %BF differed significantly (P less than 0.001) when calculated at RVA and RVW. It was concluded that, for the purpose of hydrostatic weighing, residual lung volume of quadriplegic persons should be measured with the subject immersed in water. 
Specificities of serum alpha-fetoprotein in HBsAg+ and HBsAg- patients in the diagnosis of hepatocellular carcinoma. Serum alpha-fetoprotein level is often elevated in patients with chronic liver disease and patients with hepatocellular carcinoma. One of the most difficult problems frequently encountered in practice is differentiating hepatocellular carcinoma from chronic liver disease. This study investigated the specificity and predictive value positive of serum alpha-fetoprotein at various levels in the diagnosis of hepatocellular carcinoma, using 54 patients with histologically proven hepatocellular carcinoma and 200 patients with chronic liver disease (40 patients with chronic active hepatitis and 160 patients with cirrhosis) as nontumor controls. Among 254 patients, 170 (66.9%) were HBsAg+. A wide range of overlap (from 0 to 6,400 ng/ml) in the distribution of serum alpha-fetoprotein levels between hepatocellular carcinoma and chronic liver disease patients was observed mainly among HBsAg+ patients. In contrast, the overlapping range of serum alpha-fetoprotein levels between HBsAg- patients with hepatocellular carcinoma and chronic liver disease was remarkably narrow (from 0 to 200 ng/ml). Therefore the specificity and predictive value positive of alpha-fetoprotein at a given level were significantly lower in HBsAg+ than in HBsAg- patients, especially when alpha-fetoprotein was between 25 and 200 ng/ml. The specificities of alpha-fetoprotein at 200 ng/ml and 400 ng/ml in HBsAg+ patients were 79.8% and 91.5%, respectively, whereas these specificities were both 100% in HBsAg- patients. The predictive values positive at 200 ng/ml and 400 ng/ml in HBsAg+ patients were 53.6% and 72.5%, respectively, in contrast to 100% at both levels in HBsAg- patients. The serum alpha-fetoprotein level, which showed a predictive value positive of 95% in HBsAg+ hepatocellular carcinoma patients, was 3,200 ng/ml, whereas that in HBsAg- hepatocellular carcinoma patients, was 200 ng/ml. We conclude that serum HBsAg status should be considered when serum alpha-fetoprotein is measured as an independent test to diagnose hepatocellular carcinoma, and suggest that regular serum alpha-fetoprotein determination may be more useful in HBsAg- patients with chronic liver disease for the early diagnosis of hepatocellular carcinoma than in HBsAg+ patients. 
Angiotropic large-cell lymphoma in a patient with adrenal insufficiency. Angiotropic large-cell lymphoma is a rare disorder characterized by a proliferation of malignant lymphoid cells within the lumina of small vessels. The skin and central nervous system are typically affected; however, involvement of other organs has been described. We document an unusual case of this disorder in a patient who suffered clinically significant adrenal insufficiency and subsequently died. Autopsy disclosed angiotropic large-cell lymphoma involving both adrenal glands. 
Alternating sequential intracarotid BCNU and cisplatin in recurrent malignant glioma. The authors entered 43 patients with recurrent malignant glioma in a trial of alternating sequential intracarotid BCNU and cisplatin. Protocol design was alternating courses of BCNU (2 doses, 300 to 400 mg each) and cisplatin (2 doses, 150 to 200 mg each) each at 4-week to 6-week intervals. Eight of 40 patients (20%) evaluable after the first course of BCNU showed partial or minor response. Only 18 patients were evaluable after the first course of cisplatin, and 5 were evaluable after the second course of BCNU. Median survival was 9 months (range, 2 weeks to 6 years). Cerebral or ocular toxicity unique to this method of chemotherapy administration and failure to show clinical improvement were the most common reasons for removal from study. Because of the high attrition rate, the authors were unable to determine a meaningful response to alternating sequential BCNU and cisplatin or to test the clinical degree of cross-resistance to these agents in human malignant glioma. 
Use of process evaluation to guide health education in Forsyth County's project to prevent cervical cancer. The Forsyth County, NC, Cervical Cancer Prevention Project is a 5-year public health education program designed to increase the proportion of black women in the county who are appropriately screened for cervical cancer. In this paper, the authors report on process evaluation--the procedures used to monitor the intervention and to insure that the target population was reached with a high quality, community-based health education program. A system that encompasses documentation of program activities, interviews with women in waiting rooms of primary care providers, semiannual interviews with a panel of approximately 100 women from the target population, and telephone followup with participants in direct education workshops was designed and implemented. Through October 1990, more than 2,100 interviews had been conducted. Data from these activities have facilitated continued development and refinement of educational materials, provided guidance for developing new strategies for reaching the target population, and provided continuous feedback to program managers to allow monitoring the impact of all program activities. 
The herpes simplex virus 1 segment inversion site is specifically cleaved by a virus-induced nuclear endonuclease. Nuclear extracts from several tissue culture cell lines (human, primate, and murine) contain an endonuclease that specifically cleaves sequences at the herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV-1) segment inversion site. Mapping studies identified the preferential site of cleavage as a set of tandemly repeated dodecamers, the DR2 repeats. Endonuclease levels vary according to the proliferative state of the cell; little or no activity is detectable in extracts from quiescent cells, whereas high levels are expressed in dividing cells. Also, infection of density-arrested BSC-1 cells with HSV-1 induces a substantial increase (at least 35-fold) in endonucleolytic activity, which is first detectable at about 1 hr after infection at 32 degrees C. The elevated levels of enzyme activity then persist throughout the viral life cycle. In addition to the HSV-1 DR2 repeats, certain other G+C-rich sequences with an asymmetric distribution of purines and pyrimidines on the DNA strands and with appropriate sequences and lengths are substrates for the nuclease. These data indicate that target site recognition by the enzyme is conformation specific rather than sequence specific. 
Coarctation and hypoplasia of the aortic arch: will the arch grow? Hypoplasia of the transverse aortic arch of various degrees of severity is commonly seen in infants who have coarctation of the aorta. It is more often present when the coarctation is associated with intracardiac lesions that diminish or limit forward flow in the ascending aorta and promote right to left flow through an arterial duct. The increased frequency of surgical treatment of infants with complex coarctation, which is in part related to the ability to stabilize their condition with prostaglandin E1, has posed the question of the potential for growth and development of the originally hypoplastic aortic arch after conventional repair of aortic coarctation. Review of our experience with transverse aortic arch hypoplasia, found in 33 (32%) of 102 infants undergoing coarctation repair by subclavian flap aortoplasty or classic resection and end-to-end anastomosis, revealed excellent growth of the transverse arch after repair in all patients available for linear follow-up. The currently proposed extended arch repair should be reserved for the small group of infants with transverse aortic arch to ascending aorta diameter ratios (arch indices) of less than 0.25. 
Postblepharoplasty ectropion. Prevention and management. Lower-eyelid malposition is one of the more serious complications encountered following lower-lid blepharoplasty, ranging in severity from mild lower-lid retraction to frank ectropion with marked lower-lid eversion. We define a grading system for postblepharoplasty lid malposition based on the severity of lower-lid retraction. In a critical review of 111 patients who underwent lower-lid blepharoplasty between January 1985 and January 1990, 15% were thought to have some degree of lower-lid retraction. Presence of lid laxity preoperatively and increasing amounts of skin excision at surgery were significant factors in the development of malposition. Placement of orbicularis suspension sutures tended to decrease the incidence of lid retraction. No patients had frank ectropion; however, three patients with grade 2 or 3 malposition required a secondary surgical procedure for correction. All three patients had resolution of their symptoms and good cosmetic results using standard treatment methods. A literature review and discussion of the causes, sequelae, and management of post-operative ectropion is presented as a reminder to surgeons performing blepharoplasty. Avoidance of this entity by appropriate preoperative assessment is emphasized, along with conservative operative technique. These factors combined are essential for the successful outcome of lower-lid blepharoplasty. 
Arthroscopic stapling for detached superior glenoid labrum. Superior labral tears of the shoulder involve the biceps tendon and labrum complex which may be detached, displaced inferiorly, and interposed between the glenoid and the humeral head. We have treated ten young athletes with painful shoulders due to this lesion by arthroscopic stapling. Arthroscopy at the time of staple removal, after three to six months, showed that all the lesions had been stabilised. Clinical review at over 24 months showed an excellent or good result in 80%. The two relative failures were due in one to residual subacromial bursitis, and the other to multidirectional shoulder instability. Arthroscopic stapling can restore the shoulder anatomy, and it is recommended for active adolescent athletes with this lesion. 
A prospective, randomized trial comparing combination half-dose tissue-type plasminogen activator and streptokinase with full-dose tissue-type plasminogen activator. Kentucky Acute Myocardial Infarction Trial (KAMIT) Group. BACKGROUND. The potential benefits of combination thrombolytic agents in the treatment of myocardial infarction remain uncertain. In a small pilot study, we demonstrated that combining half-dose tissue-type plasminogen activator (t-PA) with streptokinase (SK) achieved a high rate of infarct vessel patency and a low rate of reocclusion at half the cost of full-dose t-PA. METHODS AND RESULTS. We designed a prospective trial in which 216 patients were randomized within 6 hours of myocardial infarction to receive either the combination of half-dose (50 mg) t-PA with streptokinase (1.5 MU) during 1 hour or to the conventional dose of t-PA (100 mg) during 3 hours. Acute patency was determined by angiography at 90 minutes, and angioplasty was reserved for failed thrombolysis. Heparin and aspirin regimens were maintained until follow-up catheterization at day 7. Acute patency was significantly greater after t-PA/SK (79%) than with t-PA alone (64%, p less than 0.05). After angioplasty for failed thrombolysis, acute patency increased to 96% in both groups. Marked depletion of serum fibrinogen levels occurred after t-PA/SK compared with t-PA alone at 4 hours (37 +/- 36 versus 199 +/- 66 mg/dl, p less than 0.0001) and persisted 24 hours after therapy (153 +/- 66 versus 252 +/- 75 mg/dl, p less than 0.0001). Reocclusion (3% versus 10%, p = 0.06), reinfarction (0% versus 4%, p less than 0.05), and need for emergency bypass surgery (1% versus 6%, p = 0.05) tended to be less in the t-PA/SK group. Greater myocardial salvage was apparent in the t-PA/SK group as assessed by infarct zone function at day 7 (-1.9 SD/chord versus -2.3 SD/chord after t-PA alone, p less than 0.05). In-hospital mortality (6% versus 4%) and serious bleeding (12% versus 11%) were similar between the two groups. CONCLUSIONS. These results suggest that a less expensive regimen of half-dose t-PA with SK yields superior 90-minute patency and left ventricular function and a trend toward reduced reocclusion compared with the conventional dose of t-PA. 
Fibrin glue vasal anastomosis compared to conventional sutured vasovasostomy in the rat. Vasectomy reversal has become a frequently performed surgical procedure with best results obtained with the use of the operating microscope and microsurgical technique. The present study was undertaken to evaluate the use of fibrin glue ("Tisseel", Immuno U.S., Inc.) for vasovasostomy and to compare this technique to conventional sutured vasovasostomy. Utilizing 60 male Sprague Dawley rats, a conventional two layered sutured anastomosis of vasovasostomy (30 rats) was compared to a fibrin glue technique of vasal anastomosis (30 rats). The fibrin glue technique was performed with two transmural sutures, was unstented, and utilized the biological glue to seal the anastomosis. The contralateral vas of each animal underwent vasectomy and reapproximation of unligated ends so that the rate of spontaneous recanalization could be accessed. Rats were sacrificed at 24 hours, one week, four weeks, and three months postvasovasostomy. The vasal specimens were evaluated for gross patency, presence and size of sperm granuloma, mean flow rates at varying infusion pressures, tensile strength measurements and histologic studies. Combining the one and three month groups, a similar patency rate was obtained by either technique; 83% (n = 18) for the sutured group, and 90% (n = 21) for the fibrin glue group. The rate of spontaneous recanalization of the contralateral vasa in the one and three month animals was 8% (n = 38). The mean flow rates obtained at high and low infusion pressures were not statistically different for the two techniques. The tensile strength of the glue anastomosis averaged 78% of the tensile strength achieved by the conventional sutured technique. The incidence of sperm granuloma after vasovasostomy was 28% for the fibrin glue group and 61% for the sutured group. Additionally, 67% of granulomas were small (less than 3 mm.) in the glue group, compared to only 36% in the sutured group. Histology revealed similar morphological changes in the area of anastomosis with either technique. Operative time for sutured vasovasostomy averaged 24 minutes, compared to an average of 11 minutes for the glue assisted vasovasostomy. The use of fibrin glue allowed the performance of a sperm tight patent anastomosis that had the advantages of reduced incidence of sperm granuloma formation, reduced operative time, and less microsurgical skill required to perform the anastomosis. 
Long-lasting depression of the factor XII-dependent fibrinolytic system in patients with myocardial infarction undergoing thrombolytic therapy with recombinant tissue-type plasminogen activator: a randomized placebo-controlled study. In a randomized placebo-controlled study, seven patients with acute myocardial infarction allocated to intravenous treatment with 100 mg of recombinant tissue-type plasminogen activator (rt-PA) and seven patients allocated to placebo were studied during eight sampling periods before and after treatment. Seven patients with acute myocardial infarction treated intravenously with 1.5 million U of streptokinase were later studied during two sampling periods before and after treatment. The placebo group showed no significant deviations of endogenous factor XII-dependent fibrinolytic activity (p greater than 0.05). In the rt-PA group, this activity decreased significantly (p less than 0.001) after the infusion and remained depressed throughout the 1st 4 days. A significant decrease in activity (p less than 0.05) was also found in the streptokinase-treated patients. The depletion of factor XII-dependent fibrinolytic activity was not due to generation of inhibition or a depletion of factor XII, prekallikrein and plasminogen, but could be related to the proactivator of this system. It is concluded that rt-PA (and streptokinase) treatment in patients with acute myocardial infarction causes a prolonged depletion of factor XII-dependent fibrinolytic activity. This depression of endogenous fibrinolytic activity needs to be evaluated in relation to the enhanced risk of coronary reocclusion after thrombolytic therapy. 
Correlation of histology and drug response of human tumors grown in native-state three-dimensional histoculture and in nude mice. An in vitro histoculture system in which a native-state collagen-sponge gel supports the three-dimensional growth of tumor tissue has been recently developed that allows the culture and drug response assay for most every tumor type. Important features of the histoculture system include the maintenance of three-dimensional tissue architecture and the use of histological autoradiography to measure nuclear incorporation of [3H]thymidine as an endpoint. We describe in this report in vitro-in vivo correlations for drug response and tumor histology by using human tumor xenografts grown in the native-state three-dimensional histoculture system and as xenografts in nude mice. This comparison eliminates many of the confounding variables seen in most correlative clinical trials. Results demonstrate (i) a very high preservation of in vivo tissue architecture in vitro, (ii) an 86% accuracy in vitro of predicting drug resistance in vivo using suprapharmacologic doses of drugs in vitro, and (iii) an overall predictive frequency of drug resistance and sensitivity ranging from 53% for 5-fluorouracil to 78% for doxorubicin. 
Combination balloon-ultrasound imaging catheter for percutaneous transluminal angioplasty. Validation of imaging, analysis of recoil, and identification of plaque fracture. BACKGROUND. We investigated the hypothesis that an ultrasound transducer positioned within an angioplasty balloon could be used to perform quantitative assessment of arterial dimensions before and after percutaneous transluminal angioplasty (PTA) and to identify certain mechanical alterations consequent to PTA, including vascular wall recoil and the initiation of plaque fractures. METHODS AND RESULTS. A combination balloon-ultrasound imaging catheter (BUIC) that houses a 20-MHz ultrasound transducer within and halfway between the proximal and distal ends of an angioplasty balloon was used to perform PTA in 10 patients with peripheral vascular disease. Each PTA site was also evaluated before and after PTA by standard (nonballoon) intravascular ultrasound (IVUS) technique. In eight patients in whom satisfactory images were recorded with the BUIC before PTA, luminal cross-sectional area (XSA) of stenotic sites (0.10 +/- 0.01 cm2) did not differ significantly from measurements of XSA by IVUS (0.09 +/- 0.01 cm2, p = NS). Likewise, minimum luminal diameter (Dmin) measured by BUIC (0.34 +/- 0.02 cm) was similar to that measured by IVUS (0.33 +/- 0.01 cm, p = NS). In nine patients in whom satisfactory images were recorded with the BUIC after PTA, XSA measured by BUIC (0.29 +/- 0.03 cm2) did not differ significantly from XSA measured by IVUS (0.30 +/- 0.03 cm2, p = NS). Dmin measured by BUIC after PTA (0.57 +/- 0.02 cm) was also similar to Dmin measured by IVUS (0.57 +/- 0.03 cm, p = NS). After PTA, XSA and Dmin measured immediately after deflation were significantly less than balloon XSA and diameter at full inflation, indicating significant elastic recoil of the dilated site. For the nine patients in whom post-PTA images were satisfactory for quantitative analysis, including four patients in whom recoil was 39%, 46%, 50%, and 61%, percent recoil measured 28.6 +/- 7.2%. Finally, plaque fractures were identified on-line in six of 10 patients (60%); in each case, initiation of plaque fracture was observed at inflation pressures of 2 atm or less. CONCLUSIONS. The results of this preliminary human investigation indicate that an ultrasound transducer positioned within an angioplasty balloon can be used to perform quantitative and qualitative analyses of lumen-plaque-wall alterations immediately preceding, during, and immediately after PTA in patients with peripheral vascular disease. 
Effects of rapid volume expansion on the right filling pressures after prosthetic valve surgery. The effects of rapid intravascular volume expansion were studied in 12 patients, 4 to 14 years after single prosthetic heart valve replacement. The data observed showed a statistically significant mean difference before and after volume expansion of right atrial mean pressure and right ventricular end diastolic and pulmonary capillary pressures. However, right atrial and pulmonary capillary pressures equilibration was not detected. The right atrial pressure form showed abnormal variations during inspiration. Dip and plateau right ventricular diastolic pressure configuration was recorded in 6 patients after expansion, was absent in 2 and questionable in 4. A deep Y descent with an M-shaped right atrial pressure form was recorded in all 12 patients. The explanation for these phenomena is unclear. Thus, in the absence of pressure equilibration and clinical evidence of constriction, the abnormalities recorded during rapid volume expansion should be cautiously interpreted. 
Reproducibility of left ventricular myocardial volume and mass measurements by ultrafast computed tomography. Ultrafast computed tomography has been reported to be an accurate method of measuring left ventricular mass in dogs. To assess the interstudy, intraobserver and interobserver variability of left ventricular myocardial mass measurements in humans, left ventricular myocardial volume was measured three times within 24 h in 16 patients with ischemic heart disease. The mean percent difference of the mean of the three studies performed was -0.01 +/- 1.4% (range -2.9% to 3.6%). The regression analysis for the intraobserver variability at baseline was: Y = -4.33 + 1.03X; r = 0.99, SEE = 3.5 ml. The mean percent difference of the mean of the two sets of measurements performed by two independent observers was 0.28 +/- 2.1% (range -4.35% to 4.35%). The interobserver variability excluding papillary muscles at baseline study was: Y = -4.34 + 1.06X; r = 0.99, SEE = 1.5 ml. The regression analysis with versus without papillary muscles showed: Y = -8.72 + 0.97X; r = 0.96, SEE = 2.6 ml. Regression analysis to assess the variability of 24-h studies at end-systole versus end-diastole revealed: Y = 3.07 + 0.94X; r = 0.97, SEE = 1.8 ml. In conclusion, ultrafast computed tomography is a minimally invasive technique, with very low interstudy, intraobserver and interobserver variability for left ventricular myocardial volume and mass determinations in serial studies. 
Cisplatin and novobiocin in the treatment of non-small cell lung cancer. A Southwest Oncology Group study. Novobiocin, a commercially available oral antibiotic, inhibits DNA topoisomerase II in a manner shown in cell culture to enhance the cytotoxicity of alkylating agents and cisplatin. Thirty-six patients were entered on a Phase II trial using high-dose cisplatin (100 mg/m2 on days 1 and 8 for four cycles) after steady-state dosing with novobiocin (1000 mg or four 250-mg capsules every 12 hours for six doses, four of which were administered before each dose of cisplatin). One patient remains on study and cannot be evaluated for response. No complete responses were seen. Three patients (8%) had partial responses and an additional patient had an unconfirmed partial response. The median survival time of all patients was just less than 7 months. These results are comparable with those of other concurrent Southwest Oncology Group (SWOG) Phase II and III trials of high-dose cisplatin in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Novobiocin plasma levels were obtained for three patients and were approximately 50% of the optimal concentration as reported in cell culture for potentiation of cytotoxicity. It was concluded that an optimum test of novobiocin as a modulator of cytotoxicity may require the availability of an intravenous preparation. 
Perioperative morbidity and mortality of gynecologic brachytherapy. The incidence and nature of perioperative complications associated with gynecologic brachytherapy applications were determined in 462 implants performed on 327 patients with cervical, endometrial, or vaginal cancer from 1986 to 1988. Twenty-one patients (6.4%) had life-threatening complications, including cardiac (16 patients), thromboembolic (4 patients), and pulmonary (1 patient) events. Three complications (0.9%) were fatal within the first 30 days, and two patients died of delayed sequelae of perioperative complications; thus, there was an overall 1.5% mortality rate. Patients experiencing life-threatening complications tended to be older (P = 0.0002), and to have a history of cardiac disease (P = 0.0002) and an increased American Society of Anesthesiology (ASA) score (P = 0.003). Logistic analysis demonstrated that a history of cardiac disease and increased age were independent predictors of life-threatening complications (P = 0.01). Careful patient selection and intensive perioperative care of the high-risk patient may prove to substantially diminish these complications. 
Diagnostic imaging of heterotopic ossification with coexistent deep-venous thrombosis in flaccid paraplegia. Heterotopic ossification and deep-venous thrombosis can coexist. This raises potential problems because diagnosis depends heavily on imaging studies, and an ideal imaging study which will cost-effectively and noninvasively diagnose both conditions simultaneously is not readily available. A case of coexistent heterotopic ossification and deep-venous thrombosis in flaccid paraplegia is presented. In this case, deep-venous thrombosis and pulmonary embolus were diagnosed and treatment was begun without knowledge of the coexistent heterotopic ossification. Alternative imaging and laboratory diagnostic strategies are discussed. It was concluded that, at this time, clinical acumen and judicious use of traditional diagnostic alternatives is the best means of selecting appropriate treatment. Awareness of the coexistence of the two conditions are careful attention to the patient's clinical course can minimize treatment delays and resultant morbidity. 
Evaluation of the patient with stable angina following coronary artery bypass surgery. Bypass graft stenosis and occlusion are relatively common events, occurring eventually in the majority of patients who survive beyond 5 years after coronary artery bypass graft surgery. These processes, in combination with progressive native coronary artery disease, lead to recurrent angina and an increased need for medication in most patients late after surgery. Patients with unstable ischemic symptoms generally should proceed directly to coronary arteriography, whereas patients with stable angina may be candidates for noninvasive testing to evaluate their risk and the extent of myocardial jeopardy. If the initial revascularization procedure is successful, preoperative thallium 201 imaging abnormalities should be reversed. Persistent abnormalities beyond 6 months after revascularization indicate incomplete revascularization or perioperative infarction. Defects noted in the immediate postoperative period may be areas of myocardial stunning or hibernation, which can require up to 6 months to reverse. If chest pain recurs after revascularization, a normal thallium 201 perfusion pattern indicates that the symptom is probably not ischemic in nature. Thallium 201 perfusion abnormalities may precede symptoms by several months and may be the only indication of significant myocardial ischemia in patients with silent ischemia. Advanced tomographic imaging techniques, such as single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT), should theoretically improve disease detection and localization following revascularization. Practically speaking, only the left anterior descending coronary bed is well evaluated by these tomographic imaging techniques. The sensitivity and specificity of SPECT imaging for evaluation of posterior circulation abnormalities remains unacceptably low. Complexities of competitive flow and collateralization that may exist in the postoperative period make it difficult to relate perfusion abnormalities to a specific graft stenosis. However, tomographic perfusion imaging may provide useful correlative information on the functional impact of bypass graft stenoses in patients with recurrent angina who have undergone coronary angiography and in whom the angiographic indications for repeat surgery or angioplasty are not compelling. Newer tomographic and metabolic imaging techniques such as CT, NMRI, and PET remain unproven as diagnostic tests for the evaluation of unselected patient populations presenting with recurrent angina following revascularization surgery. 
Lymphocytic adenohypophysitis: an immunohistochemical study. Lymphocytic adenohypophysitis is a rare inflammatory disorder of the anterior pituitary gland. In some cases, there is evidence of concurrent autoimmune disease. We present the case of a 39-year-old woman who developed visual disturbance during the early postpartum period. Magnetic resonance imaging revealed an intrasellar mass with suprasellar extension. Study of the tumor tissue showed diffuse infiltration of the entire pituitary gland by lymphocytes and plasma cells. Immunohistochemical examination revealed that the majority of the infiltrating lymphocytes were T cells that might have modulated the immunoreaction to the anterior pituitary gland. We suggest that the disorder is related to cell-mediated immunity as well as humoral immunity. 
Changes in alpha-1 and beta-2 adrenoceptor density in human hepatocellular carcinoma. Catecholamines are involved critically in the mechanisms of liver cell proliferation by acting on hepatic alpha-1 and beta-2 adrenoceptors. To identify the role of these receptors in human hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), the density was examined of alpha-1 and beta-2 adrenoceptors with their affinity and coupling of beta-2 adrenoceptors to adenylate cyclase in HCC tissue and in nonadjacent/nontumor tissue from the same livers. Studies were also done on healthy livers from age-matched and sex-matched patients undergoing abdominal surgery for nonhepatic diseases. Twenty-two HCC had a decrease of about 72% in alpha-1 adrenoceptor density compared with their nonadjacent/nontumor tissue and a decrease of about 40% compared with healthy controls. Nonadjacent/nontumor tissue from HCC patients had a 125% increase in alpha-1 adrenoceptor density compared with healthy livers. Twenty-three of 24 HCC had an increase of about 180% in beta adrenoceptor density compared with their nonadjacent/nontumor tissue and healthy controls. Beta adrenoceptors were coupled to adenylate cyclase, as evidenced by a guanosine triphosphate-mediated right shift in (-)-isoproterenol competition isotherms and by cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) production after stimulation with (-)-isoproterenol. The HCC tissue yielded a larger increase in cAMP than nonadjacent/nontumor tissue and healthy controls. The authors conclude that a higher density of alpha-1 adrenoceptors in nonadjacent/nontumor tissue from HCC characterizes the "healthy" part of the liver in HCC patients and that an increase in beta-2 and a decrease in alpha-1 adrenoceptor densities characterize the tumor part of the liver in human HCC. 
High-affinity androgen binding and androgenic regulation of alpha 1(I)-procollagen and transforming growth factor-beta steady state messenger ribonucleic acid levels in human osteoblast-like osteosarcoma cells. Clinical observations have demonstrated a positive effect of estrogens and androgens on the maintenance of structural bone integrity. This study examines the direct effects of androgenic hormones on the osteoblast-like human osteosarcoma cell line, HOS TE85. Employing radiolabeled dihydrotestosterone (DHT), 2800 saturable, high-affinity (dissociation constant = 0.66 nM) androgen binding sites were detected per HOS TE85 cell. Androgen binding was specific in that DHT and testosterone (T) displayed significantly greater competition than the progestins, progesterone and medroxyprogesterone. The expression of androgen receptors in HOS TE85 cells was further substantiated by Northern analysis. A human androgen receptor complementary DNA probe revealed a 9.5 kilobase transcript which corresponds to the predominant human androgen receptor transcript detected in human male reproductive tissues. Androgens were also found to elicit biological responses in HOS TE85 cells. Physiological concentrations of DHT and T decreased HOS TE85 cell proliferation as assessed by cell count. This finding suggests that DHT may also play a role in osteoblast differentiation. In support of this hypothesis, treatment with T (24 h, 10 nM) enhanced the abundance of both alpha 1(I)-procollagen messenger RNA (mRNA) (5-fold) and transforming growth factor-beta mRNA (2.2 fold). The nonaromatizable androgen DHT (24 h, 10 nM) elicited an increase in the steady state concentration of alpha 1(I)-procollagen mRNA similar to the increase observed with T treatment. Thus, in addition to the recent discovery of estradiol receptors and estrogenic regulation of HOS TE85 cells, it is now evident that these osteoblast-like osteosarcoma cells also express high affinity androgen binding sites and can respond biologically to androgens. 
Membranous lipodystrophy: MR imaging appearance of the brain. Five patients with membranous lipodystrophy (lipomembranous polycystic osteodysplasia with progressive dementia) underwent magnetic resonance (MR) imaging of the brain. T2-weighted MR images showed atrophied cerebral white matter with dilated ventricles; increased signal intensity of the white matter; and decreased signal intensity of the thalamus, putamen, caudate nucleus, and cerebral cortex. Although each single finding is not specific, the combination of the above MR findings when coupled with skeletal lesions strongly suggests this rare disease. 
Cavoatrial tumor thrombectomy using cardiopulmonary bypass without circulatory arrest. Of 29 patients with inferior vena caval tumor thrombus, 14 with supradiaphragmatic extension were deemed suitable for operation. Patients (age, 7.5 to 70 years) had renal cell carcinoma (n = 8), Wilms' tumor (n = 2), transitional cell carcinoma (n = 1), and adrenal carcinoma (n = 3). Seven patients had stage III disease, and 7 patients had stage IV disease. Two patients (group A) had unresectable disease at exploratory celiotomy, 4 patients (group B) underwent tumor thrombectomy without cardiopulmonary bypass, and cardiopulmonary bypass was employed in 8 patients (group C). Three of 8 group C patients had Budd-Chiari syndrome at diagnosis. Cardiopulmonary bypass with moderate hypothermia, and inferior vena caval interruption (clip or filter), was employed in all patients. There were no perioperative deaths. Transient neurological impairment was observed postoperatively in 2 patients. Coagulopathy developed in 1 patient who had hepatic encephalopathy and Budd-Chiari syndrome preoperatively and in another patient in whom protamine could not be administered. No patient had acute renal failure requiring hemodialysis. Median survival is 41 and 17 months in groups B and C, respectively. Some authors have advocated profound hypothermia and circulatory arrest in these patients. We find that satisfactory visualization and excision can be performed with cardiopulmonary bypass and moderate hypothermia, avoiding potential renal, hepatic, neurological, and septic complications associated with circulatory arrest. 
Factors affecting the patency of stents in malignant biliary obstructive disease: univariate and multivariate analysis. To investigate the factors affecting the patency of biliary stents, we performed univariate and multivariate analyses in 370 straight stents with diameters of 10- to 12-French gauge which had been inserted singly as palliative treatment in 228 patients with malignant biliary obstructive disease. In the analysis of 226 first stents, advanced age of patients and higher serum bilirubin levels before insertion were found to be significant unfavorable factors limiting the duration of stent function. Overall, older age, male sex, no stent cleaning, and insertion on three or more occasions were significant unfavorable prognostic factors for patency. The risk of occlusion for stents inserted on three or more occasions was 2.32 times that of the first stent insertion. The median duration of patency of first, second, and subsequent stents was 177, 98, and 97 days, respectively. Diagnosis and the area of stenosis were unrelated to patency. No predictive significance of length or size of stent between 10- and 12-French gauge was found in our study. 
Failure of ciprofloxacin to eradicate convalescent fecal excretion after acute salmonellosis: experience during an outbreak in health care workers. OBJECTIVE: To determine the efficacy of ciprofloxacin therapy in eradicating convalescent fecal excretion of salmonellae after acute salmonellosis. DESIGN: Randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind trial of ciprofloxacin, with prospective follow-up of nonparticipants. SETTING: An acute care community hospital experiencing an outbreak of salmonellosis. PATIENTS: Twenty-eight health care workers developed acute infection with Salmonella java; 15 participated in a placebo-controlled trial of ciprofloxacin, beginning on day 9 after infection. INTERVENTIONS: Eight patients were randomly assigned to receive ciprofloxacin, 750 mg, and 7 patients to receive placebo; both were administered orally twice daily for 14 days. Nonparticipants who received therapy were placed on the same ciprofloxacin regimen. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Study participants had follow-up stool cultures every 3 days initially and then weekly for 3 weeks; nonparticipants were followed until three consecutive cultures were negative. All eight ciprofloxacin recipients showed eradication of S. java from stool cultures within 7 days of beginning therapy (compared with 1 of 7 placebo recipients), and their stool cultures remained negative up to 14 days after discontinuing therapy (P less than 0.01). However, 4 of 8 relapsed; their stool cultures became positive between 14 and 21 days after therapy. In addition, 3 of 3 hospitalized patients treated with ciprofloxacin who did not participate in the controlled trial also relapsed. Thus, the total relapse rate was 7 of 11 (64%; 95% CI, 31% to 89%). In 4 of these 7 patients, relapse was associated with a longer duration of fecal excretion of salmonellae than that of the placebo group. Relapse could not be explained on the basis of noncompliance, development of resistance, or presence of biliary disease. CONCLUSIONS: Despite its excellent antimicrobial activity against salmonellae and its favorable pharmacokinetic profile, ciprofloxacin at a dosage of 750 mg orally twice daily had an unacceptably high failure rate in patients with acute salmonellosis and may have prolonged fecal excretion of salmonellae. The late occurrence of relapses indicates the need to obtain stool cultures up to 21 days after therapy to document fecal eradication in acute salmonellosis. 
Insulin secretory response to secretagogues by perifused islets from chronically glucose-infused rats. Perifused islets from rats infused for 7 days with 40% glucose exhibited an altered secretory response to selected stimuli. Both phases of insulin release were blunted when 20 mM L-leucine was tested; the secretory response to a subsequent leucine stimulation was also blunted compared with the control group. The ability of 20 mM alpha-ketoisocaproate to stimulate the release of insulin was also greatly diminished in islets from glucose-infused rats. The secretory response to 50 microM tolbutamide plus 7 mM glucose by perifused islets from glucose-infused rats was 45% lower than in the control group. In addition, the response to a subsequent 10 mM glucose stimulation was lost. On the other hand, islets from glucose-infused rats responded to 20 microM forskolin plus 16.7 mM glucose with on significant change in the amount of insulin released during both phases of stimulation compared with the control group. The response to 100 nM phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate was 3.1-fold higher in islets from glucose-infused compared with saline-infused rats. The finding that chronic infusions of glucose lead to selective impairment of the secretory response to fuel stimuli and agents such as tolbutamide that act on metabolically regulated K+ channels gives support to the notion that alterations in the generation of metabolic coupling signals might be involved in the phenomenon described here. 
Obstructive dilatation of extrahepatic recipient and donor bile ducts complicating orthotopic liver transplantation: imaging and laboratory findings. Biliary obstruction in liver transplants is most commonly due to stricture at the biliary anastomosis. The native common bile duct typically is normal. We retrospectively studied 28 patients with choledochocholedochostomy anastomoses who had marked native and donor extrahepatic bile duct dilatation associated with clinical evidence of biliary obstruction. Operative cholangiograms were compared with postoperative cholangiograms obtained a mean of 50 weeks (range, 2-246 weeks) later. Mean caliber of the native common bile duct increased from 7.5 +/- 2.0 mm on operative cholangiograms to 14.8 +/- 3.9 mm on postoperative cholangiograms (p less than .001). Mean caliber of the donor common hepatic duct increased from 5.9 +/- 1.3 mm on operative cholangiograms to 12.8 +/- 3.8 mm on postoperative cholangiograms (p less than .001). Dilatation of the cystic duct remnant was seen in 15 patients. All patients had surgical revision to choledochojejunostomy with improved results of liver function studies in most cases. Diffuse dilatation of native and donor extrahepatic bile ducts may develop in liver transplant recipients. Typical features include native and donor extrahepatic ducts greater than 12 mm in diameter and a dilated cystic duct remnant on postoperative cholangiography in a patient with otherwise unexplained hepatic dysfunction. 
Patency rate of endoscopic middle meatus antrostomy. A series of 145 patients with chronic sinusitis were treated with functional endoscopic sinus surgery. Patency of the middle meatus was evaluated by actuarial life-table methods. After 24 months' follow-up, the overall patency rate of endoscopic middle meatotomy was 94.08%. Questionnaire data indicated that 91.8% of these patients were improved or asymptomatic. This preliminary study indicates that the patency rate of middle meatal antrostomy appears to be greater than that of inferior meatal antrostomy when compared to literature controls, and that a high percentage of these patients are improved by this surgery. 
Intracellular pH in human resistance arteries in essential hypertension. To investigate intracellular pH (pHi) in human resistance arteries in essential hypertension, vessels were obtained from small biopsies of skin and subcutaneous fat from 14 untreated patients, and the results were compared with those from 14 matched normotensive control volunteers. Segments of isolated resistance arteries were mounted in a myograph and loaded with the pH-sensitive fluorescent dye 2',7'-bis(2-carboxyethyl)-5(6)-carboxyfluorescein. Fluorescence signals were monitored using a series of barrier filters and chromatic beam splitters. In this way both resting pHi and the changes in pHi observed during isometric contractions initiated by agonists could be recorded. Resting pHi was not different in vessels from hypertensive patients (hypertensive, 7.24 +/- 0.06 versus control, 7.25 +/- 0.04 pH units). The application of ethylisopropylamiloride (EIPA) and 4,4'-diisothiocyanatostilbene-2,2'-disulfonic acid (DIDS) demonstrated that both Na(+)-H+ exchange and bicarbonate-dependent membrane mechanisms contributed to pHi homeostasis but that neither system was overactive in hypertension (pHi change with EIPA in vessels from hypertensive versus control subjects was -0.11 +/- 0.02 and 0.13 +/- 0.03 pH units, respectively, and pHi change with DIDS in vessels from hypertensive versus control subjects was -0.097 +/- 0.05 and -0.091 +/- 0.03 pH units, respectively). The application of norepinephrine or 125 mM K+ solution induced contraction in the arterial segments with an accompanying fall in pHi. With norepinephrine this fall was significantly attenuated in vessels from hypertensive patients. These results fail to provide evidence for raised pHi in resistance arteries in human essential hypertension, and contrary to previous reports in circulating blood cells, Na(+)-H+ exchange is not overactive in the vessels of such patients. 
Cerebrovascular abnormalities in pediatric stroke: assessment using parenchymal and angiographic magnetic resonance imaging. Three-dimensional (volume) magnetic resonance angiography is a noninvasive technique that images the intracranial and cervical arterial vasculature without contrast agents. Twenty-four children with strokes had combined parenchymal magnetic resonance imaging and magnetic resonance angiography 1 day to 4 years after acute presentation. Eight had had prior intra-arterial angiography. Eighteen magnetic resonance angiographic studies showed arterial stenosis or occlusion in the vascular distribution of magnetic resonance image-defined brain infarction and, in 7 children, in the same location as previously defined abnormalities on intra-arterial angiography. One child had a normal intra-arterial angiogram and magnetic resonance angiogram. The other 5 children with normal magnetic resonance angiographic studies included 3 with presumed embolic disease, 1 with meningitis, and 1 with Crohn's disease-related vasculitis. Collateral flow patterns could be determined in 4 children. Artifact presenting as filling defects in vessels was present in 10 studies, but did not interfere with interpretation of 8 studies. Combined magnetic resonance imaging/magnetic resonance angiography provides a screening technique to evaluate noninvasively brain parenchyma and vasculature in children with suspected large-vessel abnormalities, allowing selection for intra-arterial angiography and serial monitoring of vascular abnormalities over time and during therapeutic intervention. 
Scintigraphic measurement of regional gut transit in idiopathic constipation. In this study, total gut transit and regional colonic transit in patients with idiopathic constipation were measured scintigraphically. Eight patients with severe constipation were studied, none of whom had evidence of abnormal function of the pelvic floor. 99mTc-radiolabeled Amberlite resin particles (average diameter, 1 mm; Sigma Chemical Co., St. Louis, MO) with a mixed meal were used to assess gastric emptying and small bowel transit; similar particles labeled with 111In were ingested in a coated capsule that dispersed in the ileocecal region. These were used to quantify colonic transit. Five healthy volunteers were also studied. Two patients showed delayed gastric emptying and two had slow small bowel transit. Seven of the eight patients had slow colonic transit. In five, delay affected the whole colon ("pancolonic inertia"); in two, transit in the ascending and transverse colon was normal, but solids moved through the left colon slowly. Mean colonic transit was also measured using radiopaque markers; this technique identified the patients with slow transit, as shown by measurements of overall colonic transit by simultaneous scintigraphy. However, estimated transit through the ascending and transverse colons was considerably shorter by the radiopaque marker technique. In conclusion, idiopathic constipation is characterized by either exaggerated reservoir functions of the ascending and transverse colons and/or impairment of propulsive function in the descending colon. Particle size may influence the result of regional colonic transit tests. Transit delays in other parts of the gut suggest that, in some patients, the condition may be a more generalized motor dysfunction. 
Pain causes in 200 patients referred to a multidisciplinary cancer pain clinic. Causes of pain were analysed in 200 patients referred to a specialized cancer pain clinic. Pain caused by tumour growth was found in 158 patients, pain secondary to cancer or its treatment in 116 patients and pain unrelated to cancer in 33 patients. Visceral involvement (74 cases), bone metastases (68 cases), soft tissue invasion (56 cases) and nerve/plexus pressure or infiltration (39 cases) were the most frequent causes of pain due to tumour growth. Myogenic pain (68 cases) was the most frequent cause of secondary pain. The patients presented with a multitude of different combinations of causes of pain, the majority having at least two separate causes. Since pain treatment in cancer patients should be determined by its aetiology, a detailed analysis of the pain condition in each patient should form the basis for a rational therapy. 
The effects of induced mood on laboratory pain. Sixty-five subjects experienced 2 cold pressor immersions. Following the initial immersion, subjects participated in the Velten mood induction procedure by reading either depressive, neutral or elative statements. The sensory discriminative response to pain was measured by ratings of pain, and the affective-reactive response to pain was measured by pain tolerance. Pain tolerance, but not pain ratings, were affected by mood inductions with subjects in the depression condition shortening their tolerance times more than the subjects in the neutral condition and the subjects in the elative condition increasing their tolerance times. 
Anatomic location and variety of nonmalignant neck masses seen in surgical practice. During a 10-year interval, 189 patients, comprised of 121 females and 68 males ranging in age from 1 to 98 years, were surgically treated for nonmalignant neck masses. Nonmalignant neck masses were located in the thyroid or submaxillary gland in 60 per cent of these patients. Thyroid adenoma, reactive cervical nodes, and mixed tumor of the submaxillary salivary glands represented the three most commonly occurring nonmalignant pathologic conditions in this series. When stratified by age and sex, thyroid abnormalities, specifically thyroid adenoma, occurred most often in females of all ages. In males, reactive nodes were usually seen before 40 years of age; thereafter, tumors of the submaxillary salivary gland predominated. Most studies of nonmalignant neck masses indicate that reactive nodes are the most common condition in patients of all ages. Thyroid conditions were seen most frequently in this group of patients. The probable explanation is a tertiary referral pattern to surgeons. Patients with nonsurgical conditions were, presumably, identified and managed earlier and not referred further, and therefore did not appear in this group of patients. 
Induction chemotherapy plus radiation compared with surgery plus radiation in patients with advanced laryngeal cancer. The Department of Veterans Affairs Laryngeal Cancer Study Group. BACKGROUND. We performed a prospective, randomized study in patients with previously untreated advanced (Stage III or IV) laryngeal squamous carcinoma to compare the results of induction chemotherapy followed by definitive radiation therapy with those of conventional laryngectomy and postoperative radiation. METHODS. Three hundred thirty-two patients were randomly assigned to receive either three cycles of chemotherapy (cisplatin and fluorouracil) and radiation therapy or surgery and radiation therapy. The clinical tumor response was assessed after two cycles of chemotherapy, and patients with a response received a third cycle followed by definitive radiation therapy (6600 to 7600 cGy). Patients in whom ther was no tumor response or who had locally recurrent cancers after chemotherapy and radiation therapy underwent salvage laryngectomy. RESULTS. After two cycles of chemotherapy, the clinical tumor response was complete in 31 percent of the patients and partial in 54 percent. After a median follow-up of 33 months, the estimated 2-year survival was 68 percent (95 percent confidence interval, 60 to 76 percent) for both treatment groups (P = 0.9846). Patterns of recurrence differed significantly between the two groups, with more local recurrences (P = 0.0005) and fewer distant metastases (P = 0.016) in the chemotherapy group than in the surgery group. A total of 59 patients in the chemotherapy group (36 percent) required total laryngectomy. The larynx was preserved in 64 percent of the patients overall and 64 percent of the patients who were alive and free of disease. CONCLUSIONS. These preliminary results suggest a new role for chemotherapy in patients with advanced laryngeal cancer and indicate that a treatment strategy involving induction chemotherapy and definitive radiation therapy can be effective in preserving the larynx in a high percentage of patients, without compromising overall survival. 
Cardiac manifestations of acquired immune deficiency syndrome: a 1991 update. Cardiac involvement is being identified more often clinically and at autopsy in patients with AIDS. Recent estimates suggest that in the United States as many as 5000 patients per year may have cardiac complications resulting from HIV infection. Patients with AIDS may have pericardial, myocardial, and/or endocardial disease. Pericardial tamponade and/or constriction may be related to neoplasms, infections, or nonspecific effusions. Myocardial dysfunction may result from specific neoplastic infiltration or myocarditis. Particularly intriguing is the role of HIV-1 in the nonspecific myocarditis and dilated cardiomyopathy that occurs in patients with AIDS. As in other debilitating conditions patients with AIDS can have nonbacterial thrombotic endocarditis. Infective endocarditis may be a complication, especially in AIDS associated with intravenous drug abuse. Most patients with AIDS have no overt clinical evidence of cardiac disease. When cardiac dysfunction does develop, the signs and symptoms are often misinterpreted to be the result of noncardiac causes (pulmonary failure or infection) which can mimic heart failure. This review is intended to alert the reader to the cardiac manifestations of AIDS, which present a number of diagnostic and therapeutic challenges. 
Expression of neu protein, epidermal growth factor receptor, and transforming growth factor alpha in breast cancer. Correlation with clinicopathologic parameters. The major objectives of this study were twofold: to determine 1) if growth factors or growth factor receptors were expressed similarly or differently in a clinically well-characterized group of breast cancer patients and 2) if these phenotypic characteristics were associated with any of the commonly used prognostic parameters. Formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tumor tissue from 51 node-positive breast cancer patients were analyzed for the expression of neu, epidermal growth factor-receptor (EGF-R), and transforming growth factor alpha (TGF alpha) using immunoperoxidase staining. Positive membranous staining for neu was observed in 15 (29%) tumors. Over-expression of neu was observed in high-grade, estrogen-receptor-negative tumors (P less than 0.05). Epidermal growth factor receptor was expressed in 22 (43%) of the tumors analyzed and found to a greater degree in estrogen-receptor-negative and high-grade tumors (P less than 0.025). A significant correlation between neu and EGF-R expression was also noted. Tumors expressing membranous staining of neu had a greater than 70% chance of expressing EGF-R (P less than 0.01). Expression of TGF alpha was found in 68% of tumors and TGF alpha was detected in grade 1 and 2 tumor to a greater degree than EGF-R. The authors conclude that assaying tumors for these antigens may give additional phenotypic characteristics that can give further insight into the biology of breast cancer. 
Treatment of superior vena cava thrombosis with recombinant tissue type plasminogen activator. Thrombotic occlusion of the superior vena cava is an uncommon but serious complication of chronic indwelling venous catheters. Several reports have shown thrombolytic therapy with intravenous streptokinase or urokinase to be effective in the treatment of this condition. We report a case of superior vena cava thrombosis in a 53-year-old woman receiving chemotherapy for breast carcinoma through a subcutaneously implanted venous access catheter who was successfully treated with peripheral infusion of recombinant tissue type plasminogen activator (rtPA). 
Composition of fat in enteral diets can influence outcome in experimental peritonitis. An animal model of protracted acute peritonitis was used to study the effects on survival of different amounts and types of dietary fat. Guinea pigs (n = 132) were provided with gastrostomies and allowed to recover. Intraperitoneal osmotic pumps were then placed, allowing for effusion of viable bacteria during the next week. Three days after pump implantation, the animals were randomized to receive one of nine diets, differing only in fat content (3.5%, 14%, or 56% of total calories) and fat composition (100% Microlipid [primarily safflower oil, rich in linoleic acid], 100% MaxEPA [fish oil containing 35% omega-three fatty acids], or a 50:50 mixture of both oils). At the end of 2 weeks, survival rates were compared. Among all types of fat used, the level of fat did not affect outcome, with survival rates of 13% (6 of 45) at the low level of fat used, 30% (13 of 44) at the medium level, and 26% (11 of 43) at the high level (P greater than 0.10). However fat composition significantly influenced survival across all levels of fat, with a 39% (17 of 44) survival rate in the groups given equal amounts of Microlipid and MaxEPA, compared either to 21% (9 of 44) for the 100% Microlipid groups, or to 9% (4 of 44) for the 100% MaxEPA groups (p less than 0.05). A second experiment was performed with 58 animals fed five different mixtures of fats, all at 14% of total calories. Diets were made with fat ratios of 100:0, 75:25, 50:50, 25:75, and 0:100 Microlipid to MaxEPA. The survival rate in the 50:50 group was 83% (10 of 12), which is significantly higher than the survival rates with any of the others (p less than 0.05). It is concluded that the amount of fat in the diet does not strongly influence outcome in this model. However an equal mixture of safflower and fish oils significantly improves survival rates compared to diets made with single-oil preparations. 
Multi-infarct dementia, subcortical dementia, and hydrocephalus. The diagnostic evaluation of dementia is directed toward the identification of treatable causes. It can be facilitated by classification of the dementia into one of four categories: attentional, amnestic, cognitive, and intentional. Intentional dementia reflects dysfunction of frontal lobe systems, components of which include the frontal cortex, basal ganglia, thalamus, limbic structures, and subcortical white matter. Disorders that affect one or more of these components and produce intentional dementia include Binswanger's disease, Parkinson's disease, Huntington's disease, HIV infection, closed head injury, normal pressure hydrocephalus, neoplasms, syphilis, vitamin B12 deficiency, multiple sclerosis, and a number of uncommon degenerative and acquired syndromes. Depression may resemble intentional dementia. Guidelines for diagnosis and management are discussed. 
Achlorhydria-induced hypergastrinaemia: the role of bacteria. 1. Studies of Helicobacter pylori show that microbes can alter gastrin release. Lack of gastric acid (achlorhydria) causes hypergastrinaemia and allows bacteria to grow within the stomach. We speculated that the bacteria contribute to the rise in gastrin seen after acid inhibition, and tested the idea by comparing plasma gastrin levels during inhibition of acid secretion between germ-free and conventional rats. 2. Matched germ-free and conventional rats (n = 8 per group) received either vehicle (saline) or one of two doses of the histamine-H2-receptor antagonist loxtidine for 1 week. Gastrin was measured in cardiac blood by a specific r.i.a. 3. Plasma gastrin concentrations in germ-free and conventional rats were 59 +/- 11 pmol/l (mean +/- SEM) and 36 +/- 8 pmol/l, respectively, after vehicle, and 153 +/- 30 pmol/l and 181 +/- 27 pmol/l, respectively, after loxtidine at a dose of 10 mg day -1 kg -1, which partially inhibits acid secretion. Administration of loxtidine at a dose of 70 mg day -1 kg-1, which completely inhibits acid secretion, did not produce a significant extra rise in plasma gastrin concentration in germ-free rats (178 +/- 11 pmol/l), but further elevated plasma gastrin concentrations to 278 +/- 26 pmol/l in conventional rats (P less than 0.005 compared with germ-free rats). 4. Loxtidine produced a dose-dependent rise in the number of eosinophils in the gastric mucosa of conventional rats. 5. We conclude that partial inhibition of gastric acid secretion increases gastrin release independently of bacteria, but that bacteria are involved in the further rise in gastrin which occurs on more profound inhibition of gastric acid secretion. 
Functional complementation of ataxia-telangiectasia group D (AT-D) cells by microcell-mediated chromosome transfer and mapping of the AT-D locus to the region 11q22-23. The hereditary human disease ataxia-telangiectasia (AT) is characterized by phenotypic complexity at the cellular level. We show that multiple mutant phenotypes of immortalized AT cells from genetic complementation group D (AT-D) are corrected after the introduction of a single human chromosome from a human-mouse hybrid line by microcell-mediated chromosome transfer. This chromosome is cytogenetically abnormal. It consists primarily of human chromosome 18, but it carries translocated material from the region 11q22-23, where one or more AT genes have been previously mapped by linkage analysis. A cytogenetically normal human chromosome 18 does not complement AT-D cells after microcell-mediated transfer, whereas a normal human chromosome 11 does. We conclude that the AT-D gene is located on chromosome 11q22-23. 
Reversal of alcohol dependence and tolerance by a single administration of flumazenil. Chronic exposure to ethanol is associated with the development of tolerance to the acute effects of ethanol and a withdrawal syndrome characterized by anxiety and seizure susceptibility. In the present study we examined the ability of flumazenil (Ro15-1788), a benzodiazepine receptor antagonist, to reverse neuronal and behavioral manifestations of ethanol tolerance and dependence. A single injection of flumazenil (10 mg/kg, 14 hr before withdrawal) to mice administered a liquid diet containing ethanol for 10 days, reduced seizure severity during withdrawal from ethanol. Acute tolerance to ethanol-induced hypothermia was not sensitive to flumazenil treatment, but tolerance and diazepam-induced cross-tolerance to the ataxic effects of ethanol were reversed by a single injection of flumazenil given 2 to 26 hr before evaluation of tolerance. At a biochemical level, the ability of benzodiazepine inverse agonists (e.g., Ro15-4513) to reduce the activity of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) receptor-operated chloride channels may represent a neuronal manifestation of ethanol dependence (Buck and Harris, 1990). Flumazenil treatment of ethanol-dependent mice 14 hr before isolation of brain membrane vesicles partially reversed the augmentation of Ro15-4513 inhibition of muscimol-stimulated 36Cl- uptake in vitro. These results demonstrate that brief occupation of benzodiazepine receptors by an antagonist may reset the cellular mechanisms responsible for the development of ethanol tolerance and dependence, and support the hypothesis that increased sensitivity to benzodiazepine inverse agonists is involved in the development of ethanol dependence. 
Acne fulminans with hepatosplenomegaly and erythema nodosum migrans. Acne fulminans is a rare form of acne characterized by ulcerative nodules and associated with systemic complications. We report the case of a 17-year-old boy with cystic acne who experienced sudden onset of acne fulminans associated with fever, weight loss, hepatosplenomegaly, and erythema nodosum migrans. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first reported case of acne fulminans manifested by hepatomegaly and erythema nodosum migrans. 
Classic and vigorous achalasia: a comparison of manometric, radiographic, and clinical findings. Compared with classic achalasia, vigorous achalasia has been defined as achalasia with relatively high esophageal contraction amplitudes, often with minimal esophageal dilation and prominent tertiary contractions on radiographs, and with the presence of chest pain. However, no study using current manometric techniques has compared manometric, radiographic, and clinical findings in vigorous and classic achalasia or questioned the usefulness of making this distinction. Fifty-four cases involving patients with achalasia whose radiographic and manometric studies were performed within 6 months of each other were available for review. Patients with vigorous achalasia (n = 17), defined by amplitude greater than or equal to 37 mm Hg, and patients with classic achalasia (n = 37), defined as amplitude less than 37 mm Hg, had substantial overlap in radiographic parameters of esophageal dilation, tortuosity, and tertiary contractions. Manometric properties of repetitive waves and lower esophageal sphincter pressure and clinical aspects of chest pain, dysphagia, heartburn, and satisfactory responses to pneumatic dilation were similar in both forms of achalasia. A separate analysis of patients with mean contraction amplitude greater than 60 mm Hg revealed similar findings. It is concluded that use of amplitude as a criterion for classifying achalasia is arbitrary and of dubious value. 
Stroke rehabilitation: a model predicting return home. We undertook this study to describe the changes in functional status for patients in a rehabilitation program for acute stroke and to identify the variables that best predict discharge home. Of 282 patients, 75% were discharged home. Increases in functional status were found for all 18 activities of the Functional Independence Measure from admission to discharge. Significant predictors of discharge disposition in a logistic regression model were the admission and discharge functional status scores, length of stay, and living arrangement before the stroke. The functional status at discharge was the most important predictor. Knowledge of these predictors can contribute to more appropriate treatment and discharge planning. 
Basaloid squamous carcinoma of the hypopharynx and larynx associated with second primary tumors. Basaloid squamous carcinoma is believed to be a histologically distinct variant of squamous cell carcinoma of the neck region with 11 cases reported. Two cases arising in the pyriform fossa and vallecula are reported, both of which were associated with second primary malignant tumors: esophageal small cell carcinoma and palatal squamous cell carcinoma, respectively. The authors suggest that basaloid squamous carcinoma may be associated with a high incidence of second primary tumors in the upper gastrointestinal tract or larynx. 
Sodium-lithium countertransport and cardiorenal abnormalities in essential hypertension. The rate of red blood cell sodium-lithium countertransport is elevated only in a subgroup of patients with essential hypertension. We have therefore compared renal and cardiac function and morphology in two groups of hypertensive patients with high (n = 23) or normal (n = 22) sodium-lithium countertransport (mean +/- SEM: 0.61 +/- 0.10 versus 0.29 +/- 0.07 mmol/l red blood cells.hr). The two groups were similar in age, sex distribution, body mass index, smoking habit, duration of hypertension, and actual levels of untreated blood pressure. Hypertensive patients with elevated sodium-lithium countertransport activity showed elevated glomerular filtration rate (118 +/- 2 versus 109 +/- 2 ml/min.1.73 m2; p less than 0.001), albumin excretion rate (23 +/- 3 versus 14 +/- 2 micrograms/min; p less than 0.001), larger kidney volume (250 +/- 15 versus 203 +/- 13 ml.1.73 m2; p less than 0.01), lower lithium clearance rate (26.7 +/- 0.3 versus 28.9 +/- 0.3 ml/min.1.73 m2; p less than 0.01), and higher total body exchangeable sodium (2,716 +/- 33 versus 2,485 +/- 41 mmol.1.73 m2; p less than 0.01). Left ventricular mass index (139 +/- 6 versus 119 +/- 6 g/m2; p less than 0.05), relative wall thickness (0.39 +/- 0.05 versus 0.29 +/- 0.04 cm; p less than 0.001), and left posterior wall plus intraventricular septum thickness (2.02 +/- 0.04 versus 1.76 +/- 0.03 cm; p less than 0.05) were also higher in patients with high sodium-lithium countertransport. Hypertensive patients with normal sodium-lithium countertransport had renal and cardiac parameters similar to those of a normotensive control group (n = 21) except for a higher glomerular filtration rate and left ventricular mass index. 
Painful tic convulsif caused by a contralateral vertebral artery. The case of trigeminal neuralgia and ipsilateral hemifacial spasm--painful tic convulsif--is presented. Microsurgical exploration revealed compression of the fifth and seventh cranial nerves by a tortuous contralateral vertebral artery. Neurovascular decompression of the roots entry/exit zone completely relieved preoperative facial pain and spasm. 
Glaucoma filtration surgery: new horizontal mattress closure of conjunctival incision. We developed a conjunctival wound closure technique with the idea of decreasing the incidence of wound leak following glaucoma filtration surgery. A micropoint 9-0 nylon vascular needle is used as a running mattress suture to close the limbal conjunctiva in routine fornix-based flap trabeculectomy surgery, trabeculectomy surgery with 5-fluorouracil (5-FU), and combined cataract and trabeculectomy surgery. In a series of 52 eyes in 52 patients in which we used this technique, there have been no cases of flat anterior chamber or significant choroidal effusion, complications often occurring secondary to trabeculectomy which require further intervention. 
Oxygen-dependent lipid peroxidation during lung ischemia. The effect of alveolar oxygen tension on lung lipid peroxidation during lung ischemia was evaluated by using isolated rat lungs perfused with synthetic medium. After a 5-min equilibration period, global ischemia was produced by discontinuing perfusion while ventilation continued with gas mixtures containing 5% CO2 and a fixed oxygen concentration between 0 and 95%. Lipid peroxidation was assessed by measurement of tissue thiobarbituric acid-reactive products and conjugated dienes. Control studies (no ischemia) showed no change in parameters of lipid peroxidation during 1 h of perfusion and ventilation with 20% or 95% O2. With 60 min of ischemia, there was increased lipid peroxidation which varied with oxygen content of the ventilating gas and was markedly inhibited by ventilation with N2. Perfusion with 5-, 8-, 11-, 14-eicosatetraynoic acid indicated that generation of eicosanoids during ischemia accounted for approximately 40-50% of lung lipid peroxide production. Changes of CO2 content of the ventilating gas (to alter tissue pH) or of perfusate glucose concentration had no effect on lipid peroxidation during ischemia, but perfusion at 8% of the normal flow rate prevented lipid peroxidation. Lung dry/wet weight measured after 3 min of reperfusion showed good correlation between lung fluid accumulation and lipid peroxidation. These results indicate that reperfusion is not necessary for lipid peroxidation with ischemic insult of the lung and provide evidence that elevated PO2 during ischemia accelerates the rate of tissue injury. 
A case of progressive encephalomyelitis with rigidity and positive antiglutamic acid dehydrogenase antibodies. A 50 year old woman developed progressive encephalomyelitis with rigidity over a three year period. Her CSF contained oligoclonal bands and both her serum and CSF contained antibodies directed against GABA-ergic synapses (antiglutamic acid dehydrogenase antibodies). These antibodies have recently been described in cases of stiff man syndrome. Both disorders may be part of a clinical spectrum that has an underlying autoimmune basis. 
Familial breast-ovarian cancer locus on chromosome 17q12-q23. Familial breast cancer has been linked to the D17S74 locus on chromosome 17q. To confirm this finding and to investigate whether ovarian cancer is also linked to this locus, five large families with a hereditary predisposition to cancer of the breast and ovary were investigated. Three families were positive for linkage. For the largest family the lod score was 2.72. These findings suggest that the chromosomal region 17q12-q23, previously shown to contain a gene for early-onset breast cancer, is also associated with a proportion of hereditary ovarian cancers. 
Neuromyotonia in hereditary motor neuropathy. Two siblings with a distal motor neuropathy experienced cramping and difficulty in relaxing their muscles after voluntary contraction. Electromyographic recordings at rest revealed repetitive high voltage spontaneous electrical discharges that were accentuated after voluntary contraction and during ischaemia. Regional neuromuscular blockage with curare indicated hyperexcitability of peripheral nerve fibres and nerve block suggested that the ectopic activity originated in proximal segments of the nerve. Symptoms were improved with diphenylhydantoin, carbamazepine and tocainide. 
Trans-hydroxyl group configuration on carbons 2 and 3 of glucose. Responsible for acute inhibition of myo-inositol transport? Cultured neuroblastoma, cerebral microvessel endothelial, and retinoblastoma cells were used to examine the mechanism of acute inhibition by D-glucose of myo-inositol uptake. Acute exposure of the cells to 30 mM D-glucose caused a significant decrease in Na(+)-dependent myo-inositol uptake in all three cell types. The effect of D-glucose to acutely inhibit myo-inositol uptake was dependent on the extracellular glucose concentration and was not reversed by sorbinil. 2-Deoxy-D-glucose (30 mM), 3-O-methyl-D-glucose (30 mM), and cytochalasin B (100 microM) did not acutely inhibit myo-inositol uptake. These data suggest that the hydroxyl groups on carbons 2 and 3 of D-glucose, which in a Haworth projection appear trans to each other, are important for inhibitory activity. Other monosaccharides (30 mM) having a similar 2,3-trans-diol configuration, L-glucose, D- and L-fucose, D- and L-galactose, D- and L-xylose, and D-arabinose, all to varying degrees significantly inhibited myo-inositol uptake. In all cases, the L-isomers were more potent inhibitors of myo-inositol uptake than the corresponding D-isomers. Monosaccharides (30 mM) having hydroxyl groups on carbons 2 and 3 in a cis configuration, D-mannose, L-rhamnose, D-allose, and D-ribose, did not acutely inhibit myo-inositol uptake. Replacing the hydroxyl group with a fluorine on carbons 2 or 3 of D-glucose negated its inhibitory activity of myo-inositol uptake. In contrast, replacing the hydroxyl group with a fluorine on carbon 6 of D-glucose did not block its inhibition of myo-inositol uptake. 
Pathogenesis of edema in constrictive pericarditis. Studies of body water and sodium, renal function, hemodynamics, and plasma hormones before and after pericardiectomy. BACKGROUND. The pathogenesis of sodium and water accumulation in chronic constrictive pericarditis is not well understood and may differ from that in patients with chronic congestive heart failure due to myocardial disease. This study was undertaken to investigate some of the mechanisms. METHODS AND RESULTS. Using standard techniques, the hemodynamics, water and electrolyte spaces, renal function, and plasma concentrations of hormones were measured in 16 patients with untreated constrictive pericarditis and were measured again in eight patients after pericardiectomy. The average hemodynamic measurements were as follows: cardiac output, 1.98 l/min/m2; right atrial pressure, 22.9 mm Hg; pulmonary wedge pressure, 24.2 mm Hg; and mean pulmonary artery pressure 30.2 mm Hg. The systemic and pulmonary vascular resistances (36.3 +/- 2.5 and 3.2 +/- 0.3 mm Hg.min.m2/l, respectively) were increased. Significant increases occurred in total body water (36%), extracellular volume (81%), plasma volume (53%), and exchangeable sodium (63%). The renal plasma flow was only moderately decreased (49%), and the glomerular filtration rate was normal. Significant increases also occurred in plasma concentrations of norepinephrine (3.6 times normal), renin activity (7.2 time normal), aldosterone (3.4 times normal), cortisol (1.4 times normal), growth hormone (21.8 times normal), and atrial natriuretic peptide (5 times normal). The ratio of left atrial to aortic diameter measured by echocardiography was only minimally increased (1.29 +/- 0.04), indicating that in constrictive pericarditis the atria are prevented from expanding. The studies repeated after pericardiectomy in the eight patients showed that all measurements returned toward normal. CONCLUSIONS. The restricted distensibility of the atria, in constrictive pericarditis, limits the secretion of atrial natriuretic factor and, thus, reduces its natriuretic and diuretic effects. This results in retention of water and sodium greater than that occurring in patients with edema from myocardial disease. The arterial pressure is maintained more by the expansion of the blood volume than by an increase in the peripheral vascular resistance. 
Tumor size in endometrial cancer. Tumor size was determined in 142 patients with clinical Stage I endometrial cancer treated primarily by total abdominal hysterectomy, bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy, and lymph node biopsies between July 1979 and August 1988. Only 4% of patients with tumor size less than or equal to 2 cm had lymph node metastasis; this increased to 15% for tumors more than 2 cm and increased further to 35% when the entire uterine cavity was involved (multivariate P = 0.01). Five-year survival was 98% for patients with tumors less than or equal to 2 cm, 84% with tumors more than 2 cm, and 64% with tumors involving the whole uterine cavity (Mantel-Cox P = 0.005). For endometrial cancer patients with Grade 2 tumors and less than one-half myometrial invasion, the risk of lymph node metastasis is often considered too low to justify adjuvant pelvic radiation therapy. This intermediate-risk group is better defined by including tumor size as a prognostic factor. For this subgroup (Grade 2, less than one-half endometrial invasion) there were no lymph node metastasis associated with tumors less than 2 cm, but 18% had nodal disease when tumors were larger than 2 cm. Tumor size is an important prognostic factor that is particularly helpful in directing adjuvant radiation therapy in patients without staging lymph node biopsies. 
Isradipine in the treatment of hypertension. Some additional effects observed during a one-year study. After a placebo run-in phase of four weeks' duration, 1.25 mg or 2.5 mg isradipine twice daily orally was administered for one year to 23 patients who had been diagnosed as hypertensive. Good control of blood pressure was recorded in the majority of patients until the third month of treatment. After five months, it was necessary to add a beta-blocker to the treatment regimens of some of the patients in order to maintain the target blood pressure of 140/90 mm Hg. Patients were exercise-tested using bicycle ergometry. After three months, diastolic blood pressure was significantly lower during exercise when comparing the treatment values with those taken at the end of the placebo run-in (baseline values). Values for systolic blood pressure did not differ between treatment and baseline. These results may be explained by the decrease in peripheral vascular resistance produced by isradipine. After one year, the results were modified by the administration of the beta-blocker bopindolol (Sandonorm, Sandoz Pharma Ltd., Basle, Switzerland). Total cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and apolipoprotein B levels did not change during treatment. Triglycerides were lower after three months, but slightly higher after one year, with an average value lying within the normal range. The influence of isradipine on plasma renin activity (PRA) and aldosterone levels was followed by measuring values at rest and during exercise. It was found that PRA was higher during the first three months, then inversely inhibited to lower levels. Aldosterone levels were also increased after three months, but without a subsequent decrease. The results are compared with those obtained with diltiazem in a similar treatment regimen. 
Induction of HL60 cell differentiation by tiazofurin and its analogues: characterization and efficacy. Among inducers of myeloid differentiation for leukemic cells, tiazofurin is of special interest because its mechanism of action is known; it inhibits inosine monophosphate dehydrogenase and thus decreases the guanine nucleotide pool. Reported here are three aspects of tiazofurin induction of myeloid differentiation in HL60 human acute promyelocytic leukemia cells. First, inductive efficacy was evaluated for analogues ara-tiazofurin, xylo-tiazofurin, and selenazofurin, for dinucleotide anabolites thiazole-4-carboxamide adenine dinucleotide (TAD) and selenazole-4-carboxamide adenine dinucleotide (SAD), and for a phosphodiesterase-resistant TAD analogue, beta-methylene TAD. The results showed that the parent compounds are more effective inducers than the dinucleotide derivatives and that the selenazole analogues are more effective inducers than the thiazole compounds. Second, HL60 cell induction by tiazofurin was shown to be synergistic with that produced by the antiviral agent ribavirin. Finally, tiazofurin was found to induce expression of a phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase C-sensitive Fc gamma-receptor III (FcRIII) on HL60 cells, a feature consistent with neutrophilic, but not monocytic, differentiation. 
Plasma levels of plasminogen activator inhibitor type 1, beta-thromboglobulin, and fibrinopeptide A before, during, and after treatment of acute myocardial infarction with alteplase. Plasma levels of plasminogen activator inhibitor type-1 (PAI-1), beta-thromboglobulin (beta TG), and fibrinopeptide A (FPA) were followed over 24 hours in 30 patients treated with alteplase for acute myocardial infarction. Samples were taken at baseline (T Oh), after 90 minutes (under alteplase, no heparin, T 1.5h), after 120 minutes (under alteplase and heparin, T 2h), 30 minutes after thrombolytic therapy (T 3.5h), as well as 12 hours (T 12h) and 24 hours (T 24h) after baseline. PAI-1 antigen levels (55 +/- 9 ng/mL at T Oh, mean +/- SEM) decreased to 35 +/- 5 (T 1.5h) and 40 +/- 6 (T 2h) ng/mL under alteplase, before increasing to 84 +/- 22 (T 3.5h), 130 +/- 30 (T 12h), and 64 +/- 7 (T 24h) ng/mL after therapy, P less than .001. A high baseline PAI-1 activity (18 +/- 3 ng/mL) decreased to 2.0 +/- 0.4 (T 1.5h) and 1.7 +/- 0.2 (T 2h) under alteplase and increased to 32 +/- 5 (T 12h) and 19 +/- 3 (T 24h) ng/mL after therapy (P less than .0001). beta TG levels (339 +/- 105 ng/mL at T Oh) decreased to 203 +/- 48 (T 2h), 154 +/- 51 (T 3.5h), 187 +/- 40 (T 12h), and 142 +/- 32 (T 24h) ng/mL under heparin (P less than .01). FPA levels (34 +/- 9 ng/mL at T Oh) increased to 85 +/- 15 ng/mL under alteplase alone (T 1.5h) and normalized under heparin (11 +/- 4, 6 +/- 2, 4 +/- 2, and 3 +/- 1 ng/mL at T 2h, T 3.5h, T 12h, and T 24h, respectively). A high level of FPA at T 3.5h correlated with reocclusion (33 +/- 12 ng/mL, n = 4 v 2.9 +/- 0.5 ng/mL, n = 21, P less than .005). We conclude that plasma levels of PAI-1 antigen as well as activity markedly increase after alteplase therapy of acute myocardial infarction. The high activity of PAI-1 and decreasing beta TG levels suggest that platelets do not contribute significantly to this phenomenon. The marked increase of FPA levels under recombinant tissue-type plasminogen activator alone and its normalization under heparin emphasize the important role of concomitant anticoagulation in controlling further intravasal fibrin generation under alteplase. 
Mammography-guided stereotactic fine-needle aspiration cytology of nonpalpable breast lesions: prospective comparison with surgical biopsy results. We assessed the usefulness of fine-needle aspiration cytology (FNAC) in evaluating nonpalpable breast abnormalities by prospectively performing stereotactic mammography-guided FNAC on 100 women undergoing surgical excisional biopsy. Mammographic and cytologic diagnoses, on a scale of 1 (benign) to 4 (malignant), were assigned for each case and compared with the surgical pathologic diagnosis. Sensitivity and specificity were examined at different diagnostic cutoff points for regarding a mammographic or cytologic diagnosis as positive or negative. Of the 100 breast biopsy specimens, 70 were benign and 30 were malignant. For both mammography and FNAC, the optimal diagnostic cutoff point was between diagnosis 2 (mammography, probably benign; cytology, atypical) and 3 (mammography and cytology both suspicious for malignancy). At this cutoff point, FNAC had a sensitivity of 0.77 and specificity of 1.00, vs 0.73 sensitivity and 0.79 specificity for mammography. Pearson coefficient analysis revealed significant correlations between both mammographic and FNAC diagnoses and surgical pathology (p less than .001 for both). Our results suggest that use of mammography-guided FNAC may reduce the number of breast biopsies performed for benign lesions. 
Heterotopic bone formation after hip replacement. The influence of the type of osteoarthritis. The relationship between heterotopic bone formation and the morphological type of osteoarthritis was examined after 43 hip replacements. Of the 43 hips studied, nine were atrophic, 19 were normotrophic, and 15 were hypertrophic. The incidence of heterotopic bone formation in the atrophic type was 11%, in the normotrophic type 32%, and in the hypertrophic type 87%. The difference between each type was statistically significant (p less than 0.001). 
Compliance of adolescents with coeliac disease with a gluten free diet. A cohort of 123 patients with coeliac disease, diagnosed in the first three years of life and followed up for at least 10 years, was reevaluated during the teenage period in terms of compliance with the diet and clinical state. Mucosal structure and lymphocytes were assessed in small intestinal biopsy specimens obtained from 36 subjects, by computerised image analysis. Of these adolescents with coeliac disease, 65% were adhering to a strict gluten free diet, 11.4% were on a gluten free diet but with occasional gluten intake, and 23.6% were on a gluten containing diet. Clinical symptoms occurred more frequently in patients on a gluten containing diet, but not in patients on a semi-strict diet. Occasional intake of small amounts (0.06-2 g/day) of gluten did not produce increased concentrations of antigliadin antibodies but resulted in an appreciably increased crypt epithelial volume and expanded crypt intraepithelial lymphocyte population. 
Endoscopic injection sclerotherapy versus conservative treatment for patients with unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma and bleeding esophageal varices. We performed endoscopic injection sclerotherapy (EIS) in the treatment of 37 patients with bleeding esophageal varices due to unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). The results were compared with those in another 33 HCC patients treated only conservatively, without EIS, during the same period. A majority of both groups died within 3 weeks after treatment. Comparing the two groups, there was no significant difference in fatal bleeding (66% vs 75%), but significantly fewer of the EIS patients died of the index hemorrhage (43% vs. 83%; p less than 0.01). Also, in the absence of portal vein thrombosis, EIS significantly reduced the risk of fatal bleeding (31% vs. 73%; p less than 0.25). The mean days of survival were 32 +/- 15 (range, 2 to 320) in the EIS group and 10 +/- 14 (range, 2 to 270) in the compared group (p less than 0.001). We conclude that EIS provides temporary control of acute esophageal variceal bleeding in patients with unresectable HCC. The major factors contributing to EIS failure are the lethal propensity of the underlying disease and portal vein thrombosis. 
X-linked hypophosphatemia. Genetic and clinical correlates. X-linked hypophosphatemia is a hereditary form of rickets that results from an isolated renal tubular wasting of phosphate. The clinical features unique to this disorder, and the recent advances in our understanding of vitamin D metabolism and molecular genetics in X-linked hypophosphatemia are reviewed. Finally, a succinct critique of the controversial treatment modalities round up this review. 
Necrosis of the small intestine after resection of an abdominal aortic aneurysm. Small bowel infarction following abdominal aortic reconstruction is extremely rare, and the prognosis remains poor. This report describes a 65-year-old man with small bowel infarction after resection of an abdominal aortic aneurysm. He was successfully treated with resection of the ischemic segment from the distal duodenum to the mid-small bowel and construction of a duodenoileostomy. The postoperative course was uneventful. 
Association of Epstein-Barr virus with undifferentiated gastric carcinomas with intense lymphoid infiltration. Lymphoepithelioma-like carcinoma. Some undifferentiated gastric carcinomas with intense lymphoid infiltration have a striking resemblance to nasopharyngeal lymphoepithelioma. The authors identified eight such cases (seven patients from Japan and one from the United States) of undifferentiated gastric carcinoma (lymphoepithelioma-like carcinoma [LELC]) and examined them for Epstein-Barr (EBV) viral sequences using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and in situ hybridization (ISH) techniques. EBV was detected in seven of the eight cases by PCR, including a lymph-node metastasis. ISH that was performed in six of these cases showed EBV genomes to be uniformly present in the carcinoma cells and not present in the reactive lymphoid infiltrate or normal gastric mucosa. PCR of a polymorphic EBV locus (lymphocyte-determined membrane antigen) showed that a single genotype was present in each gastric LELC, consistent with a clonal process. These findings suggest that some undifferentiated gastric carcinomas are EBV-related and that focal EBV infection occurs before transformation. 
The use of extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy in patients with aortic aneurysms. Extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy (ESWL*) has revolutionized management of most patients with urolithiasis. The effect of ESWL on patients with an aortic aneurysm is unknown and its safety is questioned by the absence of any case reports in the urological literature. A 68-year-old man with an abdominal aortic aneurysm underwent successful ESWL using the Medstone STS 1050 lithotriptor for right renal calculi. Continuous monitoring of the aneurysm was done using real-time ultrasound during the ESWL treatment. Careful preoperative evaluation in conjunction with appropriate intraoperative and postoperative monitoring makes ESWL management of patients with associated aortic aneurysm possible. 
Arthroscopic surgery for treatment of closed lock. This study evaluates the first 51 consecutive cases treated for limitation of mandibular movement due to closed lock. Eighty joints (22 unilateral, 29 bilateral) were treated with arthroscopic surgery. The mean follow-up was 29.4 weeks, with a range of 6 to 77 weeks. These results showed an immediate improvement after arthroscopy followed by a more gradual improvement during the next 6 months, with a plateau in improvement thereafter. All cases, unilateral and bilateral, generally reached the same level of opening. 
Laser treatment of benign cutaneous vascular lesions. Benign cutaneous vascular lesions have been treated with a wide array of modalities. Lasers are a comparatively new form of treatment for cutaneous blood vessel abnormalities. Initially, results following laser treatment were disappointing, primarily because of widespread thermal injury to surrounding normal tissue. Recent developments in laser technology and the introduction of the tunable dye laser offer the ability to selectively target laser energy at specific chromophores such as oxyhemoglobin. The technique of selective photothermolysis provides successful treatment of benign vascular lesions with minimal damage to adjacent structures. 
Lipoprotein profiles in hypercholesterolemic children [published erratum appears in Am J Dis Child 1991 May;145(5):515] Atherosclerosis is a process that begins in early life. Coronary heart disease is the result of complex interactions among a variety of risk factors of which hypercholesterolemia is but one. During routine screening, 500 children were identified with total cholesterol levels above the 95th percentile of 5.2 mmol/L (200 mg/dL). Lipoprotein profiles were then performed to confirm and delineate their lipid abnormalities. A definable lipid disorder was present in 85% of such children. Abnormal lipoprotein patterns included 292 children with type IIa, 99 with type IIb, and 25 with type IV phenotypes. An abnormally low high-density lipoprotein cholesterol level of less than 0.9 mmol/L (35 mg/dL) was observed in 20 children. Only 5% of patients were identified as being hypercholesterolemic because they had high-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels above the 95th percentile of 1.8 mmol/L (70 mg/dL). Thirty-two percent of children with total cholesterol levels above 5.2 mmol/L had a family member (sibling, parent, uncle, aunt, or grandparent) with a myocardial infarction prior to 55 years of age. Data from this study support universal cholesterol testing after 3 years of age and lipoprotein profiles for those with levels above 5.2 mmol/L. 
Incidence of ultrasound-detected intrahepatic hematomas due to Tru-cut needle liver biopsy. This is a prospective study in which 120 patients with diffuse liver disease undergoing liver biopsy were followed by serial ultrasounds to determine the incidence of postbiopsy intrahepatic hematoma formation. Forty-five of the patients had a blind biopsy, while the remaining 75 patients had a biopsy performed during laparoscopy. In both groups a 2.0-mm Tru-cut needle was employed. The overall incidence of postbiopsy hematoma formation was 18.3%, with approximately the same results occurring in blind biopsy patients (20%) and laparoscopy-guided biopsy patients (17%). Only two patients had significant pain associated with the hematoma formation (one from each group), one of whom had evidence of intraperitoneal bleed and rebleed. Our results suggest that postbiopsy asymptomatic hematomas occur more frequently than had been generally thought and that laparoscopy-guided biopsy is not safer than blind biopsy. 
Splenosis presenting as a left renal mass indistinguishable from renal cell carcinoma. Splenosis following splenic trauma is a common but underdiagnosed entity before surgical exploration. In all previously reported cases the ectopic splenic tissue was distinctly separate from the kidney. To our knowledge we report the first known case in which the splenic tissue was located in direct apposition with the kidney. Using conventional imaging techniques, including renal ultrasonography, abdominal computerized tomography and selective renal arteriography, this ectopic splenic tissue appeared to be part of the left kidney and was indistinguishable from renal cell carcinoma. The pathophysiology, clinical presentation and diagnostic studies of splenosis are reviewed. 
The effects of alcohol on the female brain: a neuropathological study. This quantitative neuropathological study compared the brains of seventeen alcoholic females with twenty non-alcoholic female controls. There was a significant (P less than 0.001) increase in the pericerebral space value (control 9.5; alcoholic 16.3) indicating shrinkage of the brain. Cerebral grey and white matter volumes were determined morphometrically. There was a significant decrease in the cerebral white matter volume (P less than .02) in the alcoholics. The cerebral grey matter volume was unchanged. These changes parallel those described previously in male alcoholics. Further studies will be necessary to establish the relative severity of the brain damage in males and females. 
Failed back surgery syndrome: 5-year follow-up in 102 patients undergoing repeated operation. The indications for repeated operation in patients with persistent or recurrent pain after lumbosacral spine surgery are not well established. Long-term results have been reported infrequently, and in no case has mean follow-up exceeded 3 years. We report 5-year mean follow-up for a series of repeated operations performed between 1979 and 1983. Patient characteristics and modes of treatment have been assessed as predictors of long-term outcome. One hundred two patients with "failed back surgery syndrome" (averaging 2.4 previous operations), who underwent a repeated operation for lumbosacral decompression and/or stabilization, were interviewed by a disinterested third party a mean of 5.05 years postoperatively. Successful outcome (at least 50% sustained relief of pain for 2 years or at last follow-up, and patient satisfaction with the result) was recorded in 34% of patients. Twenty-one patients who were disabled preoperatively returned to work postoperatively; 15 who were working preoperatively became disabled or retired postoperatively. Improvements in activities of daily living were recorded, overall, as often as decrements. Loss of neurological function (strength, sensation, bowel and bladder control) was reported by patients more often than improvement. Most patients reduced or eliminated analgesic intake. Statistical analysis (including univariate and multivariate logistic regression) of patient characteristics as prognostic factors showed significant advantages for young patients and for female patients. Favorable outcome also was associated with a history of good results from previous operations, with the absence of epidural scar requiring surgical lysis, with employment before surgery, and with predominance of radicular (as opposed to axial) pain. 
Extramedullary hematopoiesis in cerebellar hemangioblastoma. Extramedullary hematopoiesis and paraneoplastic erythrocytosis are uncommon in cerebellar hemangioblastoma, and their concomitant occurrence has not been reported. In a study of 26 cases of hemangioblastoma, we found extramedullary hematopoiesis in 4 tumors; one was associated with erythrocytosis. The significance of this association and the possible histogenetic origin of extramedullary hematopoiesis in cerebellar hemangioblastoma are discussed. 
Cardiomyopathy in blacks. The intent in this chapter has been to bring to general awareness the fact that myocardial dysfunction represents a significant proportion of cardiovascular disease affecting blacks; in particular, dilated cardiomyopathy is a new frontier in cardiology, which demands an aggressive approach. At present, the prognosis is not good in the majority of cases; despite the best medical therapy, most of those with cardiomyopathy are doomed to death within a few years after the onset of congestive heart failure. Many of these are young African-American men in the prime of their lives. Cardiac transplantation offers some hope from this desperate situation, but donor shortages as well as restrictive criteria for prospective recipients and socioeconomic constraints, which may deny many blacks the opportunity to receive a transplant, make this option less than ideal. 
Pathogenesis of migraine. Endothelial cells are not just a semipermeable membrane that forms a barrier between the blood and the vascular smooth muscles. This cell system is a highly active metabolic endocrine organ. It not only produces a number of important substances in vascular and neural homeostasis but also inactivates vasoactive substances such as serotonin and bradykinin. In addition, it produces endothelin-1 and angiotensin II; more importantly in the context of migraine, endothelial cells produce the vasodilators prostacyclin and EDRF-NO, both of which are local (paracrine) hormones. The physiologic function of endothelial cells is affected by aspirin, which prevents prostacyclin formation but has little effect on normal blood pressure. From this information, one can infer that endothelial cell production of prostacyclin does not play an important part in normal cardiovascular control. On the other hand, the administration of Ng-monomethyl-L-arginine causes immediate increases in blood pressure. Because the administration of this substance inhibits the release of EDRF-NO, it appears that this paracrine endothelial hormone actively dilates the normal circulation. It is of cardinal importance that damage or flow perturbations of cell membranes of the endothelial lining of blood vessels cause an increased production of prostaglandins. However, smooth muscle cells underlying the endothelial lining also synthesize prostacyclin. This mechanism is thought to be held in reserve to reinforce local production of prostacyclin and vasodilatation when cell damage to the endothelial lining occurs and EDRF-No is not produced. Many theories for the causation of migraine have been proposed, and some have been reviewed. Those holding sway tend to ignore inconsistencies and cite supporting evidence in favor of their pet explanation only. I therefore have no hesitation to show that the best explanation at present, based on the most recent cellular evidence, explains all features of migraine and the response of migraineurs to therapy. The endothelial cell is the most likely site of the primary abnormality (Fig. 1). Although under physiologic circumstances perivascular innervation and endothelial systems closely interact in the control of vascular tone during pathologic conditions such as ischemia, the dominant role in protecting the circulation is endothelium-mediated. The biology of headache is so diverse and our ignorance sufficiently pervasive that the investigation of endothelial cell function may solve the mystery of migraine. To match the postulated crucial role of the endothelial cell in the pathogenesis of migraine, another cell would have to be ubiquitously present throughout the vasculature and not just confined to the central nervous system.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS). 
Use of bipolar endoprosthesis and bone grafting for acetabular reconstruction. Reconstruction operations for severe acetabular defects using bone grafting and a bipolar hemiarthroplasty retrospectively reviewed in 81 hips between 1983 and 1985. The most common indication was failed total hip arthroplasty. Bone grafts consisted of cancellous bone, bone blocks, and wafer-type grafts used singly or in combination. The follow-up period was 12 to 36 months postoperatively (mean, 16 months). There were 22 perioperative complications (27%) and 13 postoperative complications (16.7%). A majority of hips showed some graft resorption and component migration that worsened with time. There were four graft failures with subluxation of the component, one prosthesis dislocation, and one component disassembly. Ten hips had revision (13.3%) for a variety of reasons. Nevertheless, clinically, most patients (83%) believed the procedure had improved their condition. Reconstruction for severe acetabular defects can be achieved successfully using this technique, but long-term follow-up evaluation is needed to fully assess the role of this procedure in relation to other available options. 
Calcifying odontogenic cyst. A review of ninety-two cases with reevaluation of their nature as cysts or neoplasms, the nature of ghost cells, and subclassification. Ninety-two cases of calcifying odontogenic cyst (COC) were reviewed with special consideration of their nature as cysts or neoplasms, the nature of ghost cells, and classification on the basis of clinicopathologic features. The cases were divided into 79 (85.9%) cysts and 13 (14.1%) neoplasms. The cysts occurred as four variants: (1) nonproliferative COC (35 cases), characterized by a simple unicystic structure; (2) proliferative COC (17 cases), characterized by a cystic structure with multiple daughter cysts, extensive ghost cell formations, and marked tendency for calcification; (3) ameloblastomatous COC (11 cases), characterized by ameloblastoma-like, cyst-lining epithelium with ghost cells and calcifications; and (4) COC associated with odontoma (16 cases), which combined features of COC and odontoma. The neoplasms occurred as three variants: (1) ameloblastoma ex COC (two cases), which showed unifocal and multifocal intraluminal and intramural ameloblastoma proliferating from the COC-lining epithelium; (2) peripheral epithelial odontogenic ghost cell tumor (eight cases), which occurred in the gingiva and resembled peripheral ameloblastoma except for clustered ghost cells in the central portion of epithelial islands and the presence of juxtaepithelial dentinoid; and (3) central epithelial odontogenic ghost cell tumor (three cases). The latter showed ameloblastomatous or adenomatoid odontogenic tumor-like epithelial clusters with ghost cell formation and juxtaepithelial dentinoid. The clinical features of cystic and neoplastic variants were tabulated and described. On the basis of histopathologic features and their immunohistochemical reaction to polyclonal antikeratin antibody, it is suggested that ghost cells might be the result of coagulative necrosis. 
Expression of shared idiotypes in chronic lymphocytic leukemia and small lymphocytic lymphoma. The expression of shared idiotypes (Slds) has been studied on malignant CD5+B cells from patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) and small lymphocytic lymphoma (SLL) using a panel of 37 murine monoclonal antibodies previously demonstrated to be reactive with Slds derived from follicular B-cell lymphomas. Thirteen anti-Slds identified tumor cells from 31 of 105 (30%) CLL patients and 4 of 6 SLL patients. In comparison, the same panel of anti-Slds is reactive with 33% of follicular and diffuse B-cell lymphomas. Ten of these anti-Slds reacted with CLL cases at similar frequencies to that of the B-cell lymphomas. Two anti-Slds, which are known to react with autoantibodies, were significantly more prevalent in CLL than in B-cell lymphomas. These data confirm the presence of Slds in CLL and provide further evidence of an association between CLL and autoimmunity. The identification of a panel of antibodies reactive with a significant number of CLL and SLL patients will facilitate the application of anti-idiotype antibody therapy in these diseases.
