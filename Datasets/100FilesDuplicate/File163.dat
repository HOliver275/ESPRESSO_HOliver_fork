Primary angiosarcoma of the central nervous system. Study of eight cases and review of the literature. Angiosarcoma arising in the central or peripheral nervous system has rarely been reported. Eight patients with primary angiosarcoma of the central nervous system are described here; these included five males and three females ranging in age from 2 weeks to 72 years (mean 38 years). Of the eight neoplasms, six were located in the cerebral hemispheres and one was in the meninges; the site was unknown in the other. All patients underwent surgical resection. Five of the eight patients died, four within 4 months after surgery and one after 30 months. Two of the remaining three patients were 17 and 27 years old at the time of diagnosis and were alive at follow-up review 39 and 102 months after surgery, respectively. One patient was lost to follow-up monitoring. Microscopically, all eight tumors demonstrated a well-differentiated pattern with irregular vascular channels and intraluminal papillae; in addition, four showed poorly differentiated solid areas. Immunohistochemical staining of neoplastic cells to factor VIII-related antigen and Ulex europaeus agglutinin I was performed in five tumors and was focally positive in four. No correlation could be shown between the histological features and the growth and biological behavior of the tumors. 
Verapamil in the treatment of maternal paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia. Paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia (PSVT) is seen somewhat frequently in the emergency department but less frequently during pregnancy. Although verapamil is widely used as the drug of choice for PSVT with a narrow QRS complex in a hemodynamically stable patient, the acute IV use of verapamil during pregnancy has not been well studied. Only a limited number of case reports document its safety and efficacy in the treatment of maternal or fetal PSVT. In general, the use of medication during pregnancy requires careful assessment of both the maternal and fetal risks versus benefits and documentation of patient consent. Because it crosses the placenta, one of the major concerns with the acute use of IV verapamil centers around the drug's potential effect on fetal heart rate. The case we present describes the occurrence of PSVT on two separate occasions in a woman in the third trimester of pregnancy. In both episodes, as much as 10 mg IV verapamil was given with resulting successful conversion to normal sinus rhythm. Fetal heart monitoring during drug administration failed to show significant change in fetal heart rate. 
Meningitis from canine Pasteurella multocida following mastoidectomy. A case of Pasteurella multocida meningitis, following a mastoidectomy is presented. The association of close contact with pets, many of which harbour Pasteurella multocida as part of their normal buccal flora. This case confirms the potential benefit of taking an ear swab prior to mastoid surgery and in seeking an appropriate 'pet' history. 
Dislodgement of a vein graft thrombus by angiographic injection of native coronary artery. A case of retrograde dislodgement of thrombus in a saphenous vein graft during injection of the native right coronary artery is presented. Attention to this previously undescribed complication may allow for timely treatment with emergency surgery or thrombolysis. 
Multifactorial analysis of fertility after conservative laparoscopic treatment of ectopic pregnancy in a series of 223 patients. OBJECTIVES: To lay down the criteria to clearly define whether conservative or radical laparoscopic treatment should be adopted in cases of ectopic pregnancies (EP). DESIGN: Retrospective, noncomparative. SETTING: At the University Hospital of Clermont Ferrand and the La Pergola Clinic at Vichy from July 1974 to December 1987. PATIENTS: This study was carried out in 223 patients who had been treated laparoscopically for EP and who desired future childbearing and who were not lost to follow-up. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The measures chosen to achieve the objective included age, parity, size of hematosalpinx, volume of hemoperitoneum, tubal rupture, location, intrauterine device, ipsilateral and contralateral adhesions, and patient's previous history of salpingitis, EP, solitary tube, and tubal infertility. RESULTS: The general intrauterine pregnancy rate was 67% (149 patients) and the recurrence rate 12% (27 patients). The results according to the studied factors demonstrated that age, parity, and the type of the EP have no influence on the postectopic fertility. The history of the patient, ipsilateral adhesions, or contralateral tubal status significantly reduce the future fertility prognosis and risk of recurrence. CONCLUSIONS: From a multivariable analysis, the authors propose a scoring system to choose the most suitable treatment to preserve fertility and to reduce the risk of recurrence ranging from laparoscopic conservative treatment to laparoscopic salpingectomy with contralateral sterilization. 
Epidemiology and evaluation: steps toward hypertension treatment in the 1990s. The percentage of persons in the United States over age 65--especially over 85--is increasing more rapidly than other age groups. Two thirds of people over age 65 have blood pressure higher than 140 mm Hg systolic or 90 mm Hg diastolic. Isolated systolic hypertension (systolic blood pressure greater than 160 mm Hg with diastolic blood pressure less than 90 mm Hg) is also highly prevalent. In a number of clinical trials, treatment of diastolic hypertension in the elderly has been shown to be beneficial, although the value of treatment of isolated systolic hypertension is not yet established. The benefit of antihypertensive therapy on the incidence of stroke and heart failure has been clearly established, but prevention of the atherosclerotic complications of high blood pressure (sudden death or myocardial infarction, for example) has not been convincingly demonstrated. Since clinical trials designed to investigate this atherosclerotic complication of hypertension have relied on stepped-care regimens (diuretics and beta blockers), the question arises whether the use of different drugs might have a better effect on prevention of myocardial infarction. The basis for this supposition includes the known adverse effects of diuretics and beta blockers on electrolytes, lipid metabolism, glucose metabolism, insulin resistance, and quality of life. Hypertension treatment in the 1990s will focus on the mechanisms by which blood pressure is lowered by various antihypertensive agents, as well as individualization of drug therapy based on coexisting diseases and conditions. Emphasis will be placed on use of monotherapy whenever possible; diuretics in low doses will probably be used more frequently for second-line therapy. In recognition of their lack of adverse lipid effects and their tolerability, first-line therapy with alpha blockers, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, and calcium antagonists will become increasingly common. The goal of antihypertensive therapy will be to extend the life expectancy of hypertensive patients to that of subjects without high blood pressure; hopefully, these new treatment approaches will bring us closer to that goal. 
Successful repair of a submitral left ventricular infected pseudoaneurysm. Aneurysms of the left ventricle may be congenital or may occur after a myocardial infarction, trauma, or endocarditis. Infective endocarditis can cause destructive injury to the heart in various ways. This report describes the formation of an aneurysm of the left ventricle from trauma of a bacterial vegetation of the mitral valve. Early recognition by echocardiography and magnetic resonance imaging led to successful repair and prevented a catastrophic result. 
Lateral parabrachial nucleus and angiotensin II-induced hypertension. The objective of this study was to determine if ablation of the lateral parabrachial nucleus (LPBN) would prevent angiotensin II-induced hypertension in rats. Thirteen male Sprague-Dawley rats were studied. Bilateral electrolytic lesions in the LPBN were produced in six rats; the remaining seven rats were subjected to sham lesion surgery only. All rats were instrumented with vascular catheters and housed in metabolism cages. Daily measurements during the 16-day protocol included arterial pressure, heart rate, water intake, urine output, and urinary sodium excretion. Periodically throughout the protocol depressor responses to ganglion blockade and to blockade of V1-type vasopressin receptors also were measured. The protocol was divided into three control-period days, 10 days of continuous (24 hr/day) angiotensin II infusion (10 ng/min i.v.), and three recovery-period days. There were no significant differences between the two groups of rats for any variable during the control period. During angiotensin II infusion, sham-lesion rats exhibited a progressive increase in arterial pressure and the depressor response to ganglion blockade and a decrease in urinary sodium excretion. No other variable was significantly changed. In rats with LPBN lesions, arterial pressure was significantly increased only on days 1 and 3 of angiotensin II infusion. No other variable was affected. It was concluded that ablation of the LPBN in rats prevented sustained hypertension during intravenous infusion of angiotensin II by interfering with neurogenic pressor mechanisms normally activated by the peptide. 
Bladder and sphincter behavior in patients with spinal cord lesions. To ascertain the relationship between the clinical neurological level, and bladder and sphincter behavior, the video-urodynamic studies of 489 patients with spinal cord lesions due to a variety of causes were retrospectively analyzed. Patients were classified based on the clinical neurological level, etiology of the lesion and presence or absence of signs of sacral cord involvement. Urodynamic findings were classified as either detrusor hyperreflexia, detrusor-external sphincter dyssynergia, detrusor areflexia or normal. The results indicate that although there was a general correlation between the neurological level of injury and the expected vesicourethral function, it was neither absolute nor specific. For example, 20 of 117 cervical cord lesions had detrusor areflexia, 42 of 156 lumbar cord lesions had detrusor-external sphincter dyssynergia and 26 of 84 sacral cord had either detrusor hyperreflexia or detrusor-external sphincter dyssynergia. However, if one considers the presence of neurological abnormalities, 84% of the suprasacral cord lesions with detrusor areflexia have sacral cord signs. In contrast, all suprasacral cord lesions with no evidence of sacral cord involvement have either detrusor hyperreflexia or detrusor-external sphincter dyssynergia. The positive predictive value for positive sacral cord signs and detrusor areflexia was 87%. The positive predictive value for negative sacral cord signs and detrusor hyperreflexia/detrusor-external sphincter dyssynergia was 81%. These data suggest that the clinical neurological examination alone is not an adequate barometer to predict neurourological dysfunction and that video-urodynamic evaluation provides a more precise diagnosis for each patient. 
The submandibular triangle in squamous cell carcinoma of the larynx and hypopharynx. A 15-year retrospective analysis was carried out at the University of Illinois College of Medicine, Chicago, reviewing the tumor staging and pathology data of 239 patients treated for carcinoma of the larynx and hypopharynx requiring laryngectomy alone, laryngectomy with neck dissection, or laryngopharyngectomy and neck dissection. Surgery was the primary treatment modality in 205 of the 239 cases, with the remaining 34 having surgery to treat radiation therapy failure. Primary tumors were located within the supraglottic region, the glottic region and, less commonly, the pyriform sinus. Ninety-five of the 239 patients either presented with or developed nodal metastases following initial treatment. Of these, only two had tumors within the lymph nodes of the submandibular triangle. This data corroborates impressions that tumors of the larynx and hypopharynx rarely metastasize to the submandibular triangle and that sparing this area during neck dissection for lesions of the larynx would seem justified. 
Cardiac disturbances during the administration of taxol. The clinical development of taxol, a new antimicrotubule agent with a unique mechanism of cytotoxic action, has proceeded slowly due to serious hypersensitivity reactions (HSRs) and shortages in its supply. Nevertheless, large-scale phase II trials have been initiated as taxol has recently demonstrated impressive activity in advanced and cisplatin-refractory ovarian carcinoma. Furthermore, the incidence of HSRs has been reduced substantially with premedications and modifications in the administration schedule. However, various manifestations of potential cardiotoxicity have been observed in several patients who participated in four phase I and II studies of taxol. Asymptomatic bradycardia has occurred in a high proportion of patients, including 29% of ovarian cancer patients who were treated with maximally tolerated doses of taxol in a phase II study. More profound cardiac disturbances, including a range of atrioventricular conduction blocks, left bundle branch block, ventricular tachycardia (VT), and manifestations of cardiac ischemia, have been observed in seven of 140 patients (5%) who received taxol. Descriptions of these events are presented in this report to alert investigators to the potential for these adverse effects. Although these disturbances did not result in serious sequelae in most patients, investigators should continue to maintain a high degree of caution until precise risk factors, frequency, and clinical significance of these adverse cardiac effects are determined. 
Factors affecting the rearrangement efficiency of an Ig test gene. A rearrangement test gene, pHRD, containing the mouse IgH enhancer and the metallothionein promoter, has previously been shown to rearrange efficiently after transfection into a pre-B cell line. Experiments are now reported that assess the requirements of the DNA substrate as well as of the transfected cells for efficient rearrangement. It was found that deletion of the metallothionein promoter or substitution of the IgH enhancer by the kappa enhancer did not affect rearrangement. However, deletion of the Ig enhancer reduced the efficiency. Transfection of pHRD into stable hybrids of pre-B cells and myeloma cells resulted in a high frequency of rearrangement only if certain myeloma chromosomes were lost. Furthermore, pHRD introduced into rearrangement incompetent myeloma cells upon subsequent cell fusion with pre-B cells was rearranged only very rarely and then apparently only immediately after cell fusion. Stable pre-B cell x myeloma hybrids that retained the critical myeloma chromosomes were found to have lost VDJ recombinase activity and transcripts of the RAG-1, RAG-2 and TdT genes. It is concluded that transcription, i.e., the copying of the DNA by polymerase, is probably not required for rearrangement, but that the rearrangement substrate must be in an "open" chromatin state, such as may be provided by transcriptional factors. Furthermore, the absence of rearrangement in myeloma cells is apparently due to the continued action of an inhibitor of rearrangement. 
Effects of subsequent pregnancy on left ventricular function in peripartum cardiomyopathy. Pregnancy has been discouraged in patients with peripartum cardiomyopathy (PPCM) to avoid the risk of precipitating recurrent or progressive left ventricular dysfunction. We assessed left ventricular size and contractile function using echocardiography in four PPCM patients prior to pregnancy, during the third trimester, and a mean of 6 weeks postpartum. Left ventricular mean diameters at end diastole and at end systole prior to pregnancy (5.2 +/- 0.3 and 3.0 +/- 0.2 cm, respectively) did not change during pregnancy (5.2 +/- 0.3 and 3.1 +/- 0.2 cm). Similarly, left ventricular fractional shortening did not alter significantly during pregnancy or postpartum. Furthermore, no patient developed any symptoms or signs of left ventricular failure. All patients had normal babies, including one who had twins. We conclude that PPCM patients whose left ventricular function returns to normal may undertake further pregnancy with a normal fetal outcome and a low risk of recurrent left ventricular dysfunction. 
Smoking and mortality among older men and women in three communities. BACKGROUND. Although cigarette smoking is the leading avoidable cause of premature death in middle age, some have claimed that no association is present among older persons. METHODS. We prospectively examined the relation of cigarette-smoking habits with mortality from all causes, cardiovascular causes, and cancer among 7178 persons 65 years of age or older without a history of myocardial infarction, stroke, or cancer who lived in one of three communities: East Boston, Massachusetts; Iowa and Washington counties, Iowa; and New Haven, Connecticut. At the time of the initial interview, prevalence rates of smoking in the three communities ranged from 5.2 to 17.8 percent among women and from 14.2 to 25.8 percent among men. During five years of follow-up there were 1442 deaths, 729 due to cardiovascular disease and 316 due to cancer. RESULTS. In both sexes, rates of total mortality among current smokers were twice what they were among participants who had never smoked. Relative risks, as adjusted for age and community, were 2.1 among the men (95 percent confidence interval, 1.7 to 2.7) and 1.8 among the women (95 percent confidence interval, 1.4 to 2.4). Current smokers had higher rates of cardiovascular mortality than those who had never smoked (as adjusted for age and community, the relative risk was 2.0 [95 percent confidence interval, 1.4 to 2.9] among the men and 1.6 [95 percent confidence interval, 1.1 to 2.3] among the women), as well as increased rates of cancer mortality (relative risk, 2.4 [95 percent confidence interval, 1.4 to 4.1] among the men and 2.4 [95 percent confidence interval, 1.4 to 3.9] among the women). In both sexes, former smokers had rates of cardiovascular mortality similar to those of the participants who had never smoked, regardless of age at cessation, whereas the rates for all cancers, as well as smoking-related cancers, remained elevated among men who had once smoked. CONCLUSIONS. Our prospective findings indicate that the mortality hazards of smoking extend well into later life, and suggest that cessation will continue to improve life expectancy in older people. 
Pulmonary vascular reactivity in Fischer rats. We previously reported that Fischer (F) rat lungs developed more extensive injury when challenged with oxidants than age-matched Sprague-Dawley (SD) rat lungs. We now describe a reduced pulmonary vascular response to alveolar hypoxia and angiotensin II (ANG II) in F compared with SD rats. The comparative studies were performed with isolated lungs perfused with salt solution or blood, catheter-implanted awake rats, and isolated main pulmonary arterial rings. Isolated lungs from F rats perfused with either blood or salt solution had reduced vasoconstriction in comparison with lungs from SD rats when exposed to alveolar hypoxia or challenged with ANG II. Instrumented awake F rats had a smaller mean increase in total pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR) than SD rats (35 vs. 94 mmHg.min.l-1, P less than 0.05) when challenged with 8% oxygen. The contractile response of isolated pulmonary artery but not thoracic aortic rings to KCl and ANG II was reduced in F compared with SD rats. In addition, F rats exposed to 4 wk of hypobaric hypoxia developed less pulmonary hypertension and right ventricular hypertrophy (when corrected for the hematocrit) than SD rats. We conclude that the oxidant stress-sensitive inbred F rat strain is characterized by a lung vascular bed that is relatively unresponsive to vasoconstricting stimuli. The mechanism underlying this genetic difference in lung vascular control remains to be defined. 
Herniated cervical disk presenting as ischemic chest pain. Myocardial ischemia must be the first concern of every emergency physician in evaluating chest pain in the adult patient. Any suspicion of myocardial ischemia must be promptly evaluated and admitted. The American College of Emergency Physicians has recently published a standards document on the care of chest pain in the adult patient. The emergency physician must be familiar with this document. Once myocardial ischemia and other life-threatening causes are ruled out, one can consider that cervical disk disease may be the cause of chest pain. We present two cases of patients who presented to the emergency department with signs and symptoms consistent with cardiac ischemia. Both patients were found to have herniated cervical disks. Subsequent surgical repair completely relieved their symptoms. Evaluation of the literature shows that this entity was well described from 1950 to the 1960s. Most recent discussions do not mention disk herniation as even an infrequent cause of chest pain. If there is no life-threatening disease present, one should consider cervical disk disease. 
Obstructed central venous catheters. Restoring function with a 12-hour infusion of low-dose urokinase. Thrombotic obstruction frequently prohibits infusion through or withdrawal of blood from central venous catheters and can occur in conjunction with symptomatic thrombosis of the subclavian vein. Thirty catheters were radiographically proved to be obstructed by thrombus and had not responded to at least one instillation of 5000 units of urokinase. All catheters were treated with a 12-hour infusion of urokinase at the rate of 40,000 units/hour. The obstructing thrombus was either eliminated or reduced in size in all instances and full function was restored in all but one catheter. No bleeding complications were seen. Six patients with obstructed catheters also had symptoms of subclavian vein thrombosis. All patients with symptoms of subclavian vein obstruction became asymptomatic on anticoagulant therapy even though no attempt at dissolving the thrombus obstructing the subclavian vein was made. A 12-hour infusion of low doses of urokinase can safely salvage function of obstructed catheters that otherwise may require replacement. Patients with concomitant subclavian vein thrombosis become asymptomatic on anticoagulant therapy without need to dissolve the obstructing thrombus. 
Diabetes mellitus and localizations of obliterating arterial disease of the lower limbs. Thirty patients with intermittent claudication (IC) and treated diabetes mellitus and 30 age- and gender-matched nondiabetic claudicants underwent a vascular examination by noninvasive ultrasound methods (continuous-wave Doppler, duplex scanner). The ankle/arm systolic pressure index did not differ in the two groups. Diabetic patients with IC had more (p less than .001) non-flow-reducing stenoses (lumen reduction less than 50%) and fewer (p less than .002) flow-reducing obstructions (lumen reduction greater than 50%) of the iliac arteries than nondiabetics had. These data are consistent with a preferentially distal (below the inguinal ligament) localization of arterial stenoses in diabetic patients, whereas iliac artery diseases are relatively more severe in nondiabetics. 
A prospective evaluation of arterial intimal injuries in an experimental model. The management of arterial intimal defects remains controversial because of uncertainty concerning their natural history. We developed an experimental canine model to prospectively evaluate posterior wall intimal flaps in the superficial femoral artery. Arterial intimal flaps were constructed in 20 anesthetized dogs (40 arteries) and evaluated by arteriography, and angioscopy, and intravascular ultrasound. Postoperative patency rates at 1 (n = 20) and 3 weeks (n = 20) were compared with a control group of ten animals (n = 20, arteriotomy without intimal flap). Acute thromboses occurred in five experimental arteries with thromboses of eight additional experimental arteries at followup. Control patency was 100%, while experimental group patencies were 75% (p less than 0.05) at 1 week and 60% (p less than 0.009) at 3 weeks. All thrombosed arteries had intimal flaps with greater than 75% luminal stenosis. We conclude that intimal injuries cause arterial thromboses acutely and during subsequent followup. Intimal flaps with stenosis greater than 75% as determined arteriographically are at greatest risk for thrombosis. Angioscopy and intravascular ultrasound characterize arterial intimal defects and may delineate injuries requiring surgical or endovascular repair. 
Internal biliary drainage, parenteral nutrition, and variation in the total parenteral nutrition feeding solutions: influence on the healing of colon anastomosis in jaundiced rats. The influence of preoperative internal biliary drainage and various types of total parenteral nutrition (TPN) on the healing of a colon anastomosis in 50 jaundiced rats was investigated. Jaundice was induced by division and ligation of the common bile duct. After 5 days a colon anastomosis was made. Ten days thereafter the bursting pressure of the anastomosis was measured as an assessment of wound healing. Bursting pressures were significantly lower in jaundiced rats compared with a sham-operated nonjaundiced group. Preoperative internal biliary drainage significantly improved bursting pressure (p less than 0.001) as did preoperative TPN (p less than 0.001). In the second part of the study the influence of four different feeding solutions on the healing of a colon anastomosis was tested. Solutions with and without 20% fat emulsion and a solution with branched-chain amino acids were tested as well as glucose only. No significant differences were observed among these four groups on the parameters tested. 
Angelchik prosthesis complicates treatment of adenocarcinoma in Barrett's esophagus. Indications for use of the Angelchik prosthesis remain controversial, and many surgeons actively involved in the treatment of reflux disease have not used the device. We describe a case that illustrates difficulties associated with resection of a tumor in the presence of this prothesis. Such experience suggests that patients known to have Barrett's esophagus might be better treated with standard antireflux procedures. 
Six-year experience with a comprehensive approach to the treatment of recurrent childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL-REZ BFM 85). A relapse study of the BFM group. Between April 1985 and March 1987 130 children and adolescents up to 18 years of age with first relapse of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) were registered on the stratified and randomized multicentric trial ALL-REZ BFM 85 designed for patients pretreated with intensive front-line therapies. Stratification criteria were time and site of relapse: bone marrow (BM) relapse on or up to 6 months after stopping front-line therapy (group A), BM relapse beyond 6 months after therapy (group B), and isolated extramedullary relapse at any time (group C). Treatment consisted of alternating courses of polychemotherapy including randomly administered high- or intermediate-dose methotrexate (HDMTX:12 g/m2 as 4-hour infusion; IDMTX: 1 g/m2 as 36-hour infusion). During maintenance therapy the patients received daily oral thioguanine and biweekly intravenous (IV) MTX. The overall second complete remission (CR) rate was 92% (groups A, B, and C: 88%, 92%, and 100%), and the probability of event-free survival (EFS) at 6 years is 0.31 +/- 0.04 (groups A, B, and C: 0.18 +/- 0.05, 0.30 +/- 0.07, and 0.72 +/- 0.11). HDMTX did not prove to be superior to IDMTX, which led to premature stopping of randomization. Risk factor analyses showed early relapse, particularly BM relapse within 18 months, and T-cell phenotype to be independent predictors of poor outcome. The incidence of central nervous system (CNS) relapses following BM relapse was 19%, indicating that reprophylaxis to the CNS with IV/intrathecal (IT) MTX was insufficient. For 17 children who received bone marrow transplantation in second CR from HLA-compatible siblings the EFS was 0.53 +/- 0.12 at 5 years. Their outcome was not influenced by the above-mentioned risk factors. With the proposed treatment regimen long-lasting second remissions can be achieved in about one third of patients even after intensive front-line treatment. 
Validity of cerebrovascular mortality rates. Cerebrovascular disease (CVD) mortality rates are being increasingly used to establish a relationship with coronary heart disease risk factors. Cerebrovascular mortality rates suffer from the same general defects as coronary heart disease mortality rates but with greater diagnostic error in regard to subdivisions of CVD or stroke. These vital statistics, whether national or regional, are too inaccurate for scientific use and cannot be regarded as representing true mortality rates for any country. Moreover, clinical CVD is an inappropriate surrogate for severity of atherosclerosis, providing inexact data and allowing indeterminate overlap in epidemiologic studies. 
Tumor regulation of hepatic glutamine metabolism. Fast-growing tumors are major glutamine consumers and may alter host glutamine metabolism to benefit the tumor. Previous studies from our laboratory have demonstrated that the liver switches from an organ of glutamine balance to one of glutamine release with progressive malignant growth. However, the regulation of this change is unclear. This study examined tumor modulation of hepatic glutamine metabolism by determining the activities of glutaminase, the principle enzyme of glutamine degradation, and glutamine synthetase, the principal enzyme of glutamine synthesis. Hepatic glutamine content was also determined. Rats with a fast-growing subcutaneous fibrosarcoma (TBR) and pair-fed controls were studied at 2 and 3 weeks after tumor or sham implantation, when the tumors comprised approximately 5% and 20% of total body weight. Arterial glutamine fell with progressive tumor growth (608 +/- 26 mumol/L in controls vs 494 +/- 15 in TBR, p less than 0.005) and was not attributable to a diminished food intake. Hepatic glutamine content was increased 45% (p less than 0.01) in tumor rats at 2 weeks due in part to a 35% fall in liver glutaminase activity. At 3 weeks, glutamine synthetase activity increased by 43% (0.58 +/- 0.07 mumol/mg of protein/hr in controls vs 0.83 +/- 0.04 in TBR, p less than 0.01) whereas glutaminase remained depressed (2.68 +/- 0.12 mumol/mg of protein/hr in controls vs 2.22 +/- 0.15 in TBR, p less than 0.05) and glutamine content fell compared to 2 week tumor-bearing rats, consistent with accelerated hepatic glutamine release. Tumors may alter liver glutamine metabolism by modulating hepatic enzyme activity in order to provide circulating glutamine for the growing malignancy. 
Phase I trial of fluorouracil modulation by N-phosphonacetyl-L-aspartate and 6-methylmercaptopurine riboside: optimization of 6-methylmercaptopurine riboside dose and schedule through biochemical analysis of sequential tumor biopsy specimens. Preclinical and clinical studies demonstrate that the selective antitumor activity of fluorouracil (5-FU) is enhanced by agents which perturb certain intracellular nucleotide pools. We previously demonstrated that the combination of N-phosphonacetyl-L-aspartate (PALA), which depletes pyrimidine nucleotide pools, and 5-FU yielded a 43% response rate among 37 assessable patients with colorectal carcinoma. In preclinical tumor models, 6-methylmercaptopurine riboside (MMPR), an inhibitor of purine synthesis, elevates phosphoribosylpyrophosphate (PRPP) pools and promotes the anabolism of 5-FU to fluorinated nucleotides. In vivo, the addition of MMPR enhances the therapeutic efficacy of PALA-5-FU. In a phase I trial, we sought to determine the optimal dose and schedule of MMPR in combination with PALA (250 mg/m2 on day 1) and 5-FU (1300 mg/m2 by 24-hour infusion on day 2). MMPR (75-225 mg/m2) was given intravenously on day 1 to 27 patients with solid tumors (15 colorectal, seven breast, five other). Toxic effects were mild to moderate and included leukopenia, mucositis, nausea, or rash. Two of seven patients given MMPR at 225 mg/m2 had grade 3 diarrhea. PRPP was measured using a [14C]orotic acid 14CO2 release assay in tumor biopsy specimens obtained before and 12 hours and 24 hours after MMPR doses were given to 20 patients. The addition of MMPR elevated PRPP pools in human solid tumors. At 12 hours after treatment, two (50%) of four patients showed a twofold or greater elevation of PRPP at the MMPR dose level of 75 mg/m2; a similar elevation was observed in five (71%) of seven patients given 150 mg/m2 MMPR and in three (43%) of seven patients given 225 mg/m2 MMPR. At 24 hours after treatment, results for the respective dose levels of MMPR were two (33%) of six patients, one (20%) of five patients, and four (57%) of seven patients. Administration of the two highest MMPR dose levels appeared to result in a greater increase in tumor PRPP levels. However, toxicity was greater at the 225 mg/m2 dose level; therefore, the 150 mg/m2 dose level was favored. Tumor levels of PRPP decreased between 12 hours and 24 hours in nine (56%) of 16 patients. This time course indicates that MMPR should be administered at the beginning of the 24-hour infusion of 5-FU. 
Age-dependent increase in deleted mitochondrial DNA in the human heart: possible contributory factor to presbycardia. Cardiac function deteriorates with age, and endogenous damage to mitochondrial DNA (mt DNA) is believed to be a major contributory factor to aging. Mitochondria occupy a pivotal position in energy metabolism, and mitochondria have their own DNA, which encodes 13 subunits of the mitochondrial energy transducing system. Other subunits are encoded by nuclear DNA. DNA has been shown to have a high mutation rate, and genetic mutation might primarily be ascribed to mtDNA mutation in the energy transducing system. Recent advances in gene technology, especially in polymerase chain reactions (PCR), permit us to analyze mtDNA mutations in a small quantity of tissue. We devised rapid and accurate methods to detect mitochondrial mutations--the primer shift PCR method, PCR-Southern method, the modified primer shift PCR method, and the asymmetric PCR method. With these methods, we analyzed myocardia mtDNA in human cadavers of various ages (from 3 years old to 97 years old, mean 57 years old). The 7.4 kb deletion of mtDNA was commonly detected in elderly subjects, and the proportion of deleted mtDNA to normal mtDNA increased with age. Deleted mtDNA was observed in all subjects that were over 70 years old. The mutation was based on the directly repeated sequence: 5'-CATCAA-CAACCG-3', which exists in both the adenosine triphosphatase 6 gene and the displacement loop (D-loop) region. Replication impairment occurred at that directly repeated sequence, which caused the elimination of genomes between the adenosine triphosphatase 6 gene and the D-loop region and resulted in a 7.4 kb deletion. 
T-gamma-lymphoproliferative disorder arising in a background of autoimmune disease and terminating in plasma cell dyscrasia with primary amyloidosis. T-gamma-lymphoproliferative disorder, a syndrome of T-cell lymphocytosis with neutropenia has been described in patients with various autoimmune disorders, especially rheumatoid arthritis. We report a case of T-gamma-lymphoproliferative disorder occurring in a 42-year-old white woman with a long history of dermatitis herpetiformis and subsequent development of Coomb's positive autoimmune hemolytic anemia and polymyositis. The peripheral blood lymphocytes showed the T-suppressor cell phenotype (CD2-, CD3-, CD8-, and CD4-). DNA analysis of the peripheral blood lymphocytes revealed a T-cell receptor beta-chain gene rearrangement and an immunoglobulin heavy-chain gene rearrangement. The patient's course was marked by numerous bouts of infection. The unique factor in this patient was the development of a plasma cell dyscrasia and amyloidosis prior to death. 
Is a single quinsy an indication for tonsillectomy? There has recently been some discussion on whether a single quinsy is an indication for tonsillectomy. This paper presents a retrospective study of 36 patients who presented with a quinsy over the past 37 years but did not have interval tonsillectomy. Prolonged follow-up shows that the rate of recurrence of a quinsy can double compared to the recurrence rate under 5 years. Despite this it remains relatively low and an uncomplicated quinsy does not warrant tonsillectomy. 
Total coronary occlusion: a different animal? Provided collateralization is adequate, a chronic total coronary occlusion clinically imitates a 90% stenosis but is exempt from the risk of myocardial infarction. For angioplasty of vessels with chronic total coronary occlusion, technical difficulties and clinical risks are balanced against projected subjective benefit and amount of viable myocardium concerned. The primary success rate is approximately 65% and complications are rare because abrupt vessel reclosure may be common but is harmless. New Q wave infarction in that context has not been reported. The duration of occlusion is the most important predictor of success. The length of the occluded segment is also important. Recurrence averages 68% (21% reocclusion and 47% restenosis) and happens typically within 6 months. The high recurrence rate is due to competitive pressure exerted by collateral vessels and an often suboptimal local result. Even if the primary success rate of angioplasty in vessels with chronic total coronary occlusion can be improved by advanced technology and skill, the clinical yield will remain low compared with that of angioplasty of stenoses. Because low yield procedures must be low risk and low cost, there are definite limits to how sophisticated, risky and expensive new techniques can become. Derivatives of conventional balloon systems are likely to remain the equipment of first choice, perhaps complemented by mechanical drills. Although chronic total coronary occlusions are no clinical menace in contrast to stenoses, they frequently deserve revascularization and are the reason to select bypass surgery over angioplasty. These factors justify endeavors to improve recanalization techniques that help to refine coronary angioplasty of nontotal lesions, because total occlusion, albeit a different animal, is of the same species. 
Effects of long-term amiodarone therapy on the defibrillation threshold and the rate of shocks of the implantable cardioverter-defibrillator. The effects of long-term amiodarone therapy on the defibrillation thresholds and the rate of shocks were evaluated in 62 patients who had implantation of an automatic cardioverter-defibrillator (n = 53) or prophylactic implantation of patch electrodes (n = 9) who were survivors of sudden cardiac death (n = 34) or had refractory rapid ventricular tachycardia (n = 28). There were 53 men and 9 women, with ages ranging from 18 to 76 years (mean +/- SD, 60 +/- 12). Coronary artery disease occurred in 50 patients (80.6%), cardiomyopathy occurred in six (9.7%), valvular heart disease developed in two (3.2%), primary electrical disease developed in two (3.2%), hypertensive heart disease materialized in one (1.6%), and Ebstein's anomaly occurred in one (1.6%). The left ventricular ejection fraction varied from 10% to 75% (mean, 37 +/- 17%). All patients had failed a mean of 3.9 +/- 1.6 antiarrhythmic drugs prior to implantation of the device. Twenty-eight patients (45%) were taking amiodarone up to the time of surgery, with a mean daily dose of 406 +/- 147 mg (range 200 to 800) and for a mean duration of 6.0 +/- 6.7 months (range 1 to 36 months). The mean defibrillation threshold (DFT) was 12.0 +/- 4.4 joules (range 5 to 20) in the group taking amiodarone and was not significantly different from that of the group not taking amiodarone (n = 32) (mean DFT 12.3 +/- 5.5 joules, range 5 to 30; p = 0.77). 
Increased occurrence of arrhythmias in men with ischaemic type ST-segment depression during long-term ECG recording. Prognostic impact on ischaemic heart disease: results from the prospective population study 'Men born in 1914', Malmo, Sweden. The objective of this long-term ECG (LTER) study in 394 68-year-old men, selected at random from the general population of Malmo, Sweden, was to determine the prevalence and occurrence of cardiac arrhythmias and their impact on morbidity and mortality from IHD. According to Lown classification, 29.4% (116 men) had ventricular arrhythmia (VA) group 4-5. Serious ventricular arrhythmia (Lown group 4-5) was more common in men with asymptomatic ischaemic type ST-segment depression (STD) than in those without it (37.8% vs. 26.7%: P less than 0.05). During the mean follow-up period of 53.1 months there were seven IHD deaths (6%) among the 116 patients with VA, Lown 4-5, and nine IHD deaths (3.2%) among the 278 patients without serious VA, Lown 0-3, (P = 0.26). Six and three of these deaths, respectively, were considered to be sudden (P = 0.022). The increased cardiac event rate (fatal or non-fatal MI or deaths due to chronic IHD) associated with a serious ventricular arrhythmia disappeared when history of IHD at baseline and occurrence of STD during LTER were taken into account. The study did not provide any evidence to suggest that ventricular arrhythmia was triggered by myocardial ischaemia. Five of 9 (56%) deaths due to IHD in men with STD occurred among the 38% (37/98) of patients who belonged to Lown class 4-5. It is concluded that the prognostic information derived from LTER can be improved by combined monitoring of STD and ventricular arrhythmias. 
Restenosis 1 to 24 months after clinically successful coronary balloon angioplasty: a necropsy study of 20 patients. This report describes clinical, morphologic and histologic findings at necropsy late (range 1.6 to 24.1 months [average 8.2 months]) after clinically successful coronary balloon angioplasty in 20 patients with coronary angioplasty restenosis. Clinical evidence of restenosis occurred in 14 patients (70%), including 6 patients with sudden coronary death. Of the 20 patients, 14 (70%) had a cardiac cause of death and 6 (30%) had a noncardiac cause of death. Two major subgroups of histologic findings were observed: 1) intimal proliferation (60%), and 2) atherosclerotic plaque only (40%). Of the eight sites with atherosclerotic plaque only, six were eccentric lesions and two were concentric lesions. No morphologic evidence of previous angioplasty injury (cracks, breaks, tears) was observed in the eight patients with atherosclerotic plaque only. Proposed mechanisms for the development of intimal proliferation involve the reaction of smooth muscle cells and platelets, whereas elastic recoil of overstretched eccentric or concentric atherosclerotic lesions represents the most likely explanation for the findings in the latter subgroup. On the basis of these morphologic findings at angioplasty restenosis sites, specific treatment strategies for restenosis after coronary artery balloon angioplasty are proposed. 
Chemotherapy and radiation therapy for anal carcinoma. Survival and late morbidity. This study was performed to evaluate the survival and late morbidity rates of a widely used combined chemotherapy and radiation therapy regimen given to patients with carcinoma of the anal canal. One hundred six patients received radiation therapy (5000 cGy given by two anteroposterior-posteroanterior [AP-PA] opposed fields) and chemotherapy (mitomycin C plus 5-fluorouracil [5-FU]) from 1983 to 1989. Patients with primary tumors (n = 86) had a complete response rate of 84% and a 5-year survival rate of 72%. There was no significant difference in survival rate according to tumor stage. Patients with local recurrence (n = 20) after primary surgery had a complete response rate of 50% and a 5-year survival rate of 40%. Fifteen percent of the patients experienced late treatment-related symptoms including anal incontinence, intestinal obstruction, and chronic pelvic pain. The current treatment regimen is effective but carries a considerable risk of complications. As survival rate was independent of tumor stage, the locoregional treatment should probably be less extensive for small tumors than for advanced tumors. This strategy may reduce the late side effects for patients with small tumors without reducing the survival rate. 
Sonography of the gallbladder: significance of striated (layered) thickening of the gallbladder wall. Sonographic identification of thickening of the gallbladder wall that consists of multiple striations (alternate hypoechoic and hyperechoic layers) has been considered strong evidence of the presence of acute cholecystitis. We studied 27 patients in whom sonograms showed striated thickening of the gallbladder wall to determine the diagnostic significance of this finding. Striations were classified as focal or diffuse. Sonograms were correlated with pathologic findings in 16 patients and with clinical diagnoses and laboratory findings in 11. Patients were categorized as having cholecystitis with or without gangrene or edema of the gallbladder wall unrelated to gallbladder disease. Striated thickening of the gallbladder wall was due to cholecystitis in 10 patients, and all 10 had gangrenous changes at surgery or at pathologic examination. Striations were focal in eight of these patients and diffuse in two. Striated thickening of the gallbladder wall was due to edema of the wall unrelated to gallbladder disease in 17 patients. Causes included congestive heart failure (n = 4), renal failure (n = 5), liver disease (hepatic failure [n = 1], hepatitis [n = 6]), ascites (n = 2), hypoalbuminemia (n = 3), pancreatitis (n = 1), blockage of the lymphatic/venous drainage of the gallbladder (n = 2), and prominent Rokitansky-Aschoff sinuses (n = 1). More than one abnormality was present in five patients. Striations were focal in 11 of these patients and diffuse in six. The sonographic finding of striated gallbladder wall thickening is no more specific for cholecystitis than the observation of gallbladder wall thickening by itself, and it may occur in a variety of diseases. However, in the clinical setting of acute cholecystitis, the presence of striations suggests gangrenous changes in the gallbladder. The extent of the striations (focal or diffuse) is not useful in predicting the cause of the striated gallbladder wall thickening. 
Anastomotic recurrence of carcinoma of the colon and rectum. The value of endoscopy and serum CEA levels. The early diagnosis of anastomotic recurrence after surgery for carcinoma of the colon and rectum is difficult. Whether repeat colonoscopy and serial serum CEA measurements were useful in diagnosing early anastomotic recurrence was examined. A total of 112 patients with carcinoma of the colon and rectum who had undergone resection and anastomosis were followed with frequent colonoscopy and serum CEA measurements. Seventeen patients developed anastomotic recurrence. Fourteen patients had elevated serum CEA levels, and 15 patients had endoscopic evidence suggesting recurrence at the anastomotic site. CT scans of the abdomen and pelvis demonstrated metastatic disease in seven patients, localized anastomotic disease in six patients, and no evidence of disease in four patients. Laparotomy was then carried out in 10 patients. In eight of 10 patients, it was possible to resect localized disease. In a 3-year follow-up study, eight patients were alive, four without any evidence of recurrent disease. Repeat colonoscopy and serum CEA measurements are recommended as postoperative surveillance for carcinoma of the colon and rectum. In select cases laparotomy and resection may prolong survival. 
Significance of atherosclerotic changes of the ascending aorta during coronary bypass surgery with intraoperative detection by echography. Intraoperative echographic studies of the ascending aorta were carried out on 100 of 222 patients having primary coronary bypass surgeries between May 1987 and December 1988. The purpose of this study was to investigate the feasibility of echographic study in evaluating the nature of atherosclerotic disease of the ascending aorta and its incidence and relationship to perioperative cerebrovascular complications in coronary bypass surgery. It was possible to obtain clear echographic images of the aortic wall in these 100 patients which were divided into two groups according to the degree of the degenerative process. Three of 13 patients (23%) (Group II) with severe atherosclerotic changes, suffered perioperative cerebrovascular complications, and early surgical mortality in 2 patients (15%) was caused by cerebrovascular complications. These complications were not seen in 87 patients with less than moderate atherosclerotic changes (Group I). 
Immediate effect of vagotomy on pancreatic insulin secretion. The effect of vagotomy and gastric resection on insulin secretion was examined by the glucagon stimulated C-peptide test in gastrectomy patients (n = 11) without truncal vagotomy and in total gastrectomy patients (n = 10) with truncal vagotomy. The test was performed twice in each patient: 10 minutes after the midline incision was made and then 60 to 90 minutes later when gastric resection or total gastrectomy was completed, during the reconstructive phase of the operation. Gastric resection without truncal vagotomy was followed by a higher increase (48%) in serum C-peptide concentration caused by glucagon stimulation than total gastrectomy with truncal vagotomy (13%). There was a significant (p less than 0.05) increase in the glucagon stimulated glucose-related C-peptide concentration in patients without truncal vagotomy, whereas truncal vagotomy inhibited this increase. These results suggest that truncal vagotomy will produce a reduction in stimulated insulin secretion in humans. 
Tranexamic acid treatment of hemothorax in two patients with malignant mesothelioma. Patients with malignant mesothelioma may present with hemothorax. We used a combination of oral and intrapleural tranexamic acid to treat two patients with this severe complication. Initiation of treatment with this potent anti-fibrinolytic drug resulted in rapid reduction of bleeding and of transfusion requirements. 
Emergency management of the adult female rape victim. Estimates are that one in every six women is raped during her lifetime. The family physician must be able to evaluate and treat the rape victim in the emergency setting. A detailed history, careful physical examination, collection of medical specimens for legal purposes, assessment of the patient's psychologic state, prophylaxis of venereal disease and pregnancy counseling are required. 
Increased cell membrane arachidonic acid in experimental colorectal tumours. Tumour cell membrane fatty acid composition was investigated using an animal model of colorectal carcinogenesis. Eighty six male Wistar rats were fed experimental diets containing either 5% saturated fat or 20% saturated fat. Colorectal tumours were induced by intraperitoneal injection of azoxymethane, and control rats received saline. Animals were killed at intervals up to 26 weeks after the last injection of carcinogen for histology and lipid analysis. Cell membrane fatty acids in colonic mucosa and colorectal tumours were determined by gas liquid chromatography. Animals fed the 20% fat diet developed more carcinomas (28 cancers in 14 rats) than those fed the 5% fat diet (14 cancers in 15 rats; chi 2 = 8.03, p = 0.0046) but they did not develop significantly more adenomas (28 and 24 respectively). Cell membrane fatty acid analysis showed a considerable increase in the content of arachidonic acid (20:4, n-6) in the tumours (mean (SEM) 11.7 (1.5)%) compared with colonic mucosa (4.2 (0.4)%; p less than 0.05). Dietary fatty acid composition was also found to influence the profile of fatty acids in the colonic mucosa. This study suggests that a high saturated fat diet promotes the malignant transformation of colorectal adenomas. The colorectal tumours were characterised by an increased cell membrane arachidonic acid, the precursor of putative cancer promoting prostaglandins. 
Orifice variability of the stenotic aortic valve: evaluation before and after balloon aortic valvuloplasty. The effects of balloon aortic valvuloplasty on orifice variability of the stenotic sclerocalcific aortic valve were evaluated by hemodynamic measurements of aortic valve function in 14 patients before balloon aortic valvuloplasty, during nitroprusside infusion before valvuloplasty, 48 h after valvuloplasty and during nitroprusside infusion 48 h after valvuloplasty. Aortic valve function was assessed by aortic valve area calculations with use of the Gorlin and Cannon formulas. Nitroprusside infusion before balloon aortic valvuloplasty caused no change in mean aortic valve gradient but a significant increase in mean aortic transvalvular flow from 186 +/- 46 to 202 +/- 61 ml/s (p less than 0.05), in Gorlin aortic valve area from 0.49 +/- 0.17 to 0.53 +/- 0.21 cm2 (p less than 0.05) and in Cannon aortic valve area from 0.45 +/- 0.18 to 0.49 +/- 0.22 cm2 (p less than 0.05). Nitroprusside infusion 48 h after valvuloplasty induced no change in mean aortic valve gradient but a significant increase in mean aortic transvalvular flow from 214 +/- 61 to 254 +/- 78 ml/s (p less than 0.005), in Gorlin aortic valve area from 0.71 +/- 0.25 to 0.83 +/- 0.32 cm2 (p less than 0.01) and in Cannon aortic valve area from 0.78 +/- 0.33 to 0.88 +/- 0.40 cm2 (p less than 0.05). Forty-eight hours after valvuloplasty, nitroprusside infusion induced a larger increase (40 +/- 40 ml/s) in mean transvalvular flow than before valvuloplasty (16 +/- 27 ml/s; p less than 0.05) and a larger increase (0.12 +/- 0.14 cm2) in Gorlin aortic valve area than before valvuloplasty (0.05 +/- 0.07 cm2; p less than 0.05). 
Tissue plasminogen activator reduces brain injury in a rabbit model of thromboembolic stroke. Tissue plasminogen activator is an endogenous fibrin-specific serine protease with potent thrombolytic activity. We investigated the efficacy of tissue plasminogen activator in reducing cerebral infarct size after thromboembolic stroke in a rabbit model. Seventeen rabbits were randomized to receive either tissue plasminogen activator (2.5 mg/kg, n = 6) or vehicle control (n = 11). We controlled mean arterial pressure, hematocrit, and arterial blood gases before and after the intracarotid embolization of an autologous clot. Cerebral blood flow (cm3/100 g/min) (mean +/- SEM) was immediately reduced from 55.2 +/- 7.7 to 8.5 +/- 2.5 in the control group and from 61.8 +/- 14.8 to 10.0 +/- 3.5 in the treated group after embolization. Cerebral blood flow recovered significantly within 60 minutes of thrombolytic therapy and attained a value of 59.6 +/- 10.0 cm3/100 g/min 4 hours after embolization, whereas cerebral blood flow in control animals demonstrated only a minimal recovery to 15.3 +/- 8.9 cm3/100 g/min. Cerebral infarct size (percent of hemisphere) was reduced from 34.4 +/- 5.6% in control animals to 8.8 +/- 5.6% in treated animals (mean +/- SEM, p less than 0.01). These results suggest that tissue plasminogen activator may be efficacious in restoring cerebral blood flow and thus limiting infarct size in acute thromboembolic stroke. 
Stage T1 bladder cancer: grade is the primary determinant for risk of muscle invasion. Tumor characteristics believed to predict for deep muscle invasion after transurethral resection of superficial bladder cancer alone were analyzed in 51 patients with stage T1 (stage A) transitional cell carcinoma of the bladder. All patients were treated at Stanford University Medical Center and none had intravesical chemotherapy at any time during the median followup of 78 months. No patient had carcinoma in situ. A total of 14 patients (27%) had deep muscle invasion. None of the patients with grade 1, 5 (22%) with grade 2 and 9 (50%) with grade 3 to 4 tumors had deep muscle invasion. Comparison of the risk of muscle invasion using pathological tumor grade at diagnosis, highest grade at any cystoscopic biopsy before the diagnosis of muscle invasion or highest grade at cystoscopic biopsy immediately antecedent to the cystoscopy at which muscle invasion was diagnosed all showed similar probability of muscle invasion. Mean interval to development of muscle invasion was 6 and 12 months in the grades 2 and 3 to 4 groups, respectively. At 36 months the cumulative probability of invasion-free survival was 62% for grade 2, compared to 50% for grades 3 to 4 cancer patients (p less than 0.005, Gehan). Univariate regression analysis demonstrated grade to be the only significant factor in predicting for invasive disease (p = 0.005), with tumors in the bladder neck to be of borderline significance (p = 0.159). On multivariate logistic regression analysis, grade remained the single tumor variable predicting for invasive bladder cancer (p = 0.004). These data suggest that of routinely available data at diagnosis and during subsequent followup cystoscopic examinations, tumor grade is the most important biological predictor of progression to muscle invasive cancer. 
Efficacy of quinine for falciparum malaria according to previous chloroquine exposure. Chloroquine has been reported to antagonise the anti-parasitic action of quinine against Plasmodium falciparum in vitro. We looked for evidence of any such antagonism in vivo. In 123 Malawian children with cerebral malaria treated with parenteral quinine, the likelihood of survival and the rate of recovery were much the same in patients who had taken chloroquine and those who had not. In these circumstances we found no evidence of chloroquine/quinine antagonism. 
Influence of the ultrasonic surgical aspirator on the dura and spinal cord. An electrohistologic study. The influence of the ultrasonic surgical aspirator on the dura and underlying spinal cord was examined. Spinal-cord-evoked potential was simultaneously recorded. In a test of identical time, the degree of influence on the dura, the pia mater, and the spinal cord increased according to the increase of energy of the ultrasonic surgical aspirator. With 60% energy at 20 seconds and 80% energy at both 10 and 20 seconds, spinal-cord-evoked potential showed wave changes. In light of these results, it is suggested that in using the ultrasonic surgical aspirator on the dura, the electrohistologic safety limit be set at 60% energy and the maximum time duration at one point less than 10 seconds. 
Idiopathic trigeminal pain associated with gustatory stimuli. We present a unique case of a patient with facial pain evoked by gustatory stimuli. Pain was typically evoked by application of sucrose to the ipsilateral anterior 2/3 of the tongue, but not to the contralateral aspect. Pain was referred to the maxillary tuberosity area and, when stronger, to the infraorbital and supraorbital regions. Sucrose was most effective in eliciting pain, whilst saline, citric acid and water had a minimal effect. Spatial or temporal summation of gustatory stimuli was associated with stronger pain of longer duration and shorter latency. Some of the pain characteristics were similar to those of idiopathic trigeminal neuralgia. Thus, pain was elicited by innocuous ipsilateral stimuli, referred out of the stimulus zone, persisted beyond the period of stimulation and could be controlled with carbamazepine. We proposed a central neural mechanism for pain induction with convergence between gustatory stimuli afferents and pain pathways in the trigeminal system. 
Heart rate response to an i.v. test dose of adrenaline and lignocaine with and without atropine pretreatment. In order to evaluate the sensitivity of an adrenaline test dose for detecting intravascular injection and the effect of atropine pretreatment, 90 ASA physical status I and II patients were allocated randomly to two groups, to receive i.v. saline 1 ml (n = 46) or i.v. atropine 0.5 mg (n = 44). Five minutes later, all patients received an i.v. test dose of 2% lignocaine 3 ml with adrenaline 15 micrograms at a rate of 1 ml s-1. The groups were similar with respect to basal heart rate (HR). HR remained unchanged after saline injection, but increased slightly 5 min after atropine injection (mean 78 (SD 15) beat min-1 vs 87 (20) beat min-1 (P less than 0.05). After the test dose of lignocaine with adrenaline, HR increased significantly in both groups at 30 s, 1 and 2 min, and remained increased at 3 min in the atropine group. The maximum increase in HR was greater in the atropine group than in the saline group (31 (4) beat min-1 vs 26 (11) beat min-1 (P less than 0.05). However, when individual maximum HR changes are considered, five patients in the saline group and four in the atropine group had an increase less than or equal to 10 beat min-1, and three patients in the saline group had no change or a decrease in HR. Defining a positive result to a test dose as an increase in HR of greater than 10 beat min-1, the sensitivity of the adrenaline test dose was 83 (5.5)% in the saline group and 91 (3.5)% in the atropine group (ns). 
Radiation therapy for primary carcinoma of the extrahepatic biliary system. An analysis of 63 cases. From 1976 to 1988, 63 patients received radiation therapy for primary cancers of the extrahepatic biliary system (eight gallbladder and 55 extrahepatic biliary duct). Twelve patients underwent orthotopic liver transplantation. Chemotherapy was administered to 13 patients. Three patients underwent intraluminal brachytherapy alone (range, 28 to 55 Gy). Sixty patients received megavoltage external-beam radiation therapy (range, 5.4 to 61.6 Gy; median, 45 Gy), of whom nine received additional intraluminal brachytherapy (range, 14 to 45 Gy; median, 30 Gy). The median survival of all patients was 7 months. Sixty patients died, all within 39 months of radiation therapy. One patient is alive 11 months after irradiation without surgical resection, and two are alive 50 months after liver transplantation and irradiation. Symptomatic duodenal ulcers developed after radiation therapy in seven patients but were not significantly related to any clinical variable tested. Extrahepatic biliary duct cancers, the absence of metastases, increasing calendar year of treatment, and liver transplantation with postoperative radiation therapy were factors significantly associated with improved survival. 
Spinal cord schistosomiasis. A clinical, laboratory and radiological study, with a note on therapeutic aspects. Fourteen patients with schistosomiasis of the spinal cord are described. They fall into two groups: 7 patients had clinical and computer-assisted myelographic evidence of lesions in the conus medullaris or cauda equina, or both. The clinical picture in the remaining 7 patients was usually that of acute or subacute transverse myelitis with normal or equivocal CT myelographic appearances. Granulomas containing bilharzial ova were found in 2 female patients with conus swelling subjected to laminectomy and biopsy. In 1 of these the ova were identified as S. haematobium while in the second, unidentified bilharzial ova were found. A presumptive diagnosis of spinal cord schistosomiasis was made in the remaining 12 patients based on characteristic clinical and investigative profiles. All 13 patients tested showed evidence of bilharzial infection based on positive blood serology or the detection of bilharzial ova, or both. All but 1 patient showed at least one of the following abnormalities on CSF examination: pleocytosis, an elevated protein content and as indicated by the presence of oligoclonal IgG bands, an elevated IgG index and an increased CSF IgG synthesis rate. A CSF bilharzia enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) test, developed to indicate the presence of schistosomal infection within the theca, was found to be sensitive although not entirely specific for the diagnosis of spinal cord schistosomiasis. Eleven of the 14 patients showed rapid clinical improvement, 8 after praziquantel and corticosteroid treatment, 2 after operation and 1 spontaneously. Significant reductions in the CSF cell count, protein concentration and bilharzia ELISA titre, and in intrathecal antibody production, occurred following praziquantel and corticosteroid therapy. The CSF sugar level showed a significant rise. A reduction in conus size was observed in 3 patients when CT myelography was repeated after medical therapy. The normalization of most of the laboratory parameters after combined medical treatment with praziquantel and corticosteroids, together with clinical and radiological improvement, strengthened the presumptive diagnosis of cord schistosomiasis and supports the policy of early intensive medical treatment (as opposed to surgical therapy) for this condition when diagnosed on indirect evidence. 
Malignant melanoma in the 1990s: the continued importance of early detection and the role of physician examination and self-examination of the skin. Despite the exciting new techniques being developed to help diagnose early malignant melanoma, the current standard of care remains periodic examination of the skin. The combination of routine physician examination coupled with self-examination of the skin provides an opportunity for the identification of early malignant melanoma. Removal of such thin lesions can significantly reduce the ever-increasing mortality rate from this potentially serious form of cutaneous cancer. 
The adverse impact of cyclosporine on serum lipids in renal transplant recipients. The extent to which cyclosporine (CsA) directly, or indirectly, influences serum lipid levels in renal transplant patients treated with multiple-drug immunosuppression protocols is unclear. Indeed, patients treated with CsA have reduced corticosteroid requirements, fewer acute rejection episodes, and other differences from patients receiving conventional immunosuppression that may reduce serum lipid levels. We studied patients treated with low-dose CsA, corticosteroids, azathioprine, and Minnesota antilymphocyte globulin ([ALG] n = 205) versus conventional (three-drug) immunosuppression (n = 368) and evaluated the impact of CsA, acute rejection episodes, and other clinical parameters on serum lipids. Fasting serum lipid levels from stable patients transplanted between 1976 to 1989 were studied at 3 (n = 573), 12 (n = 565), 26 (n = 55), and 52 (n = 521) weeks posttransplant using multivariate, linear regression analysis. The incidence of acute rejection episodes was reduced by CsA, but patients with fewer acute rejection episodes in the early posttransplant period had higher serum total cholesterol (increased by .33 +/- .12 mmol/L [13 +/- 5 mg/dL] and .27 +/- .12 mmol/L [10 +/- 5 mg/dL], P less than 0.05, at 3 and 12 weeks, respectively) and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) (increased by .23 +/- .11 mmol/L [9 +/- 4 mg/dL] and .23 +/- .11 mmol/L [9 +/- 4 mg/dL], P less than 0.05). 
Squamous metaplasia in hormonally treated prostatic cancer. Significance during follow-up. A prospective study of 59 hormonally treated prostatic cancer cases was undertaken during follow-up with sequential transrectal palpation and fine-needle aspiration. At initiation of therapy patients' ages ranged from forty-eight to eighty-two years (median, 68 years). The usual follow-up interval was 6 +/- 3 months, and follow-up periods ranged from six months to one hundred twenty months (median 48 months). The cytologic findings were categorized under four cytologic response types and palpation findings under five response grades. Four different degrees of squamous metaplasia (1+, 2+, 3+, 4+) were observed in smears, depending on semiquantitative determination of squamous metaplastic cells in relation to the total amount of benign and malignant epithelial cells in the smear. There were 341 follow-up observations in which both transrectal fine-needle aspiration cytology and palpation were done. In 306 of these, cytologic findings were found to be adequate. Comparison of squamous metaplasia with cytologic response types revealed a highly significant difference between the benign state and recurrence/frank malignancy. This was also true when frequency of squamous metaplasia was compared with palpatory response grades. It was found that squamous metaplasia can be a valuable adjunct to other cytomorphologic changes such as shrinkage of tumor cell size and decrease in size of nucleoli or its disappearance, in determining response to hormonal therapy. 
Effects of lipoprotein (a) on success rate of thrombolytic therapy in acute myocardial infarction. Lipoprotein (a) [Lp(a)] and plasminogen share a high degree of homology as recently evidenced by amino acid and deoxyribonucleic acid analysis. As Lp(a) is enzymatically inactive, it has been suggested that high levels of Lp(a) may suppress the profibrinolytic activity at the cell surface and increase the risk for arteriosclerosis and thrombosis by competitive inhibition of plasminogen. The present study evaluated whether high levels of Lp(a) influence thrombolytic therapy in patients with acute myocardial infarction. Forty-one patients with acute myocardial infarction received a combination low-dose thrombolytic therapy with recombinant tissue-type plasminogen activator (rt-PA) and human single-chain urokinase-type plasminogen activator (scu-PA). This regimen did not induce plasminemia or a lytic state as indicated by well-maintained levels of fibrinogen. Coronary patency was assessed angiographically 90 minutes after initiation of treatment. Thrombolysis was successful in 30 and unsuccessful in 11 patients. Patients with high Lp(a) levels (greater than or equal to 25 mg/dl) (n = 9) responded equally well to thrombolytic therapy (8 of 9, patency 89%) as did patients with normal or low levels of Lp(a) (22 of 32, patency 70%, difference greater than 0.1). Lp(a) levels did not differ significantly between patients with successful and unsuccessful thrombolysis. Our results demonstrate that high levels of Lp(a) do not affect thrombolysis in patients with acute myocardial infarction when low-dose pharmacologic concentrations of rt-PA and scu-PA are applied in combination. 
Mechanism of cyclosporine-induced hypertension. Cyclosporine is a common immunosuppressive agent used in solid organ and bone marrow transplants and the treatment of some immunological diseases. It has been established that treatment with cyclosporine can cause a patient to develop hypertension within a few weeks of treatment. This review will examine this effect and effective ways to treat it. 
A five-year appraisal and hemodynamic evaluation of the Bjork-Shiley Monostrut valve. Two hundred forty-four Bjork-Shiley Monostrut valves were implanted in 225 consecutive patients from October 1983 to December 1988. Aortic valve replacement was performed in 90 patients, mitral valve replacement in 118, and double valve replacement in 16 patients. One patient had tricuspid valve replacement. There were 100 female patients and 125 male patients with a mean age of 54 years (range 2 to 71 years). Present data were completely available for all patients. The cumulative follow-up was 541 patient-years with a mean of 2 years, 5 months. The closing date for follow-up was July 1989, and the closing interval was 2 months. The early mortality rate was 3.1%, and the late mortality rate, 3.1%. The 5-year survival rate was 88% +/- 2.0%: 87% +/- 3.0% for aortic valve replacement, 91% +/- 3.3% for mitral valve replacement, and 75% +/- 9.6% for double valve replacement. The actuarial rates of freedom from thromboembolism at 5 years were 93% +/- 3.2% for aortic, 96% +/- 1.4% for mitral, and 94% +/- 6.1% for double valve replacement. There were no instances of structural valve deterioration. Actuarial rate of freedom from valve-related morbidity and mortality was 86% +/- 2.0% at 5 years: 86% +/- 9.5% for aortic, 87% +/- 3.3% for mitral, and 75% +/- 7.3% for double valve replacement. Effective valve areas (average) of 12 mitral and 12 aortic valve prostheses were calculated at rest and during bicycle exercise: 2.4 cm2 at rest and 2.8 cm2 during exercise in 27 mm aortic valves, 2.4 cm2 at rest and 3.0 cm2 during exercise in 25 mm aortic valves, 2.0 cm2 at rest and 2.4 cm2 during exercise in 27 mm mitral valves, and 2.6 cm2 at rest and 2.5 cm2 during exercise in 29 mm mitral valve. On the basis of our follow-up period of 5 years, we have judged the Bjork-Shiley Monostrut valve reliable, with a low incidence of valve-related morbidity and with acceptably satisfactory hemodynamic characteristics at rest and during exercise. 
Reduction in susceptibility to natural killer cell-mediated lysis of human FO-1 melanoma cells after induction of HLA class I antigen expression by transfection with B2m gene. Induction of HLA class I antigens on cultured melanoma cells FO-1 after transfection with a human or a mouse B2m gene was associated with a statistically significant reduction in their susceptibility to natural killer (NK) cell-mediated lysis. These results indicate that the structural differences between human and mouse beta 2-mu do not abolish the ability of the HLA class I molecular complex to modulate NK cell-mediated lysis of melanoma cells FO-1. The role of HLA class I antigens in the phenomenon is corroborated by the ability of anti-HLA class I MAb to enhance, although to a different extent, the susceptibility of transfected FO-1 cells to NK cell-mediated lysis. Gamma interferon (IFN-gamma) and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) significantly reduced the susceptibility to NK cell-mediated lysis of transfected FO-1 cells. Surprisingly, TNF-alpha reduced the extent of lysis more than IFN-gamma, although the latter cytokine enhanced HLA class I antigen expression more than the former one. This finding, in conjunction with a reduction in the susceptibility to NK cell-mediated lysis of untransfected FO-1 cells incubated with IFN-gamma or TNF-alpha, suggests that the two cytokines reduce NK cell-mediated lysis of transfected cells by modulating not only the expression of HLA class I antigens, but also that of other structures. Induction of HLA class I antigens and their modulation with IFN-gamma did not affect the susceptibility to lymphokine-activated killer (LAK) cell-mediated lysis of transfected FO-1 cells. Characterization of the molecular mechanism(s) underlying abnormalities in HLA class I antigen expression by melanoma cells and of the role of these molecules in the interactions of melanoma cells with various types of effector cells may suggest novel immunotherapeutic approaches to melanoma. 
Evaluation and management of stridor in the newborn. Stridor in a newborn should necessitate an immediate work-up to rule out a life-threatening airway obstruction. Three cases of newborns with stridor are presented. These cases emphasize the need for an immediate and thorough physical examination of any stridorous newborn, followed by radiologic studies and direct laryngoscopy. While other invasive procedures are frequently required for a precise diagnosis, a careful examination with special attention to the quality of the stridor often permits a more effective diagnostic approach in an atmosphere of appropriate urgency. 
Comparative evaluation of loracarbef and amoxicillin-clavulanate for acute otitis media. One hundred five infants and children with acute otitis media were randomized to therapy with loracarbef, an experimental carbacephem antibiotic, or amoxicillin-clavulanate (Augmentin), an approved drug for this disease. Ninety-two were evaluable (46 in each group). Middle ear fluid samples obtained for culture before therapy grew Haemophilus spp. in 30% of cases, pneumococci in 29% of cases, and Moraxella catarrhalis in 15% of cases. beta-Lactamase-producing bacteria were found in 37% of patients. Clinical failure occurred in four loracarbef-treated patients and one amoxicillin-clavulanate-treated patient (P = 0.361). Recurrence of acute otitis media was more common in the 2 to 3 weeks after loracarbef treatment (eight patients) than it was after amoxicillin-clavulanate therapy (three patients), but not significantly so (P = 0.197). Thus, combined failure and recurrence occurred in 12 loracarbef-treated patients and four amoxicillin-clavulanate-treated patients (P = 0.052). Gastrointestinal side effects occurred in 13 loracarbef-treated and 21 amoxicillin-clavulanate-treated patients (P = 0.13). Diaper rash was more common with amoxicillin-clavulanate (22 patients) than with loracarbef (10 patients; P = 0.016). Satisfactory results were achieved with both antibiotics, and adverse effects, although common, were minor. 
Psychosocial aspects of chronic, clinically unconfirmed vulvovaginitis Women with chronic symptoms of vulvovaginitis referred to a university vulvovaginitis clinic were assessed on psychological and social (including sexual) variables to determine whether differences existed among women with unconfirmed vulvovaginitis, women with confirmed vulvovaginitis, and healthy controls. Eighty-three consecutive women with chronic symptoms of vulvovaginitis and 32 asymptomatic control women completed clinical examinations, cultures, and the following psychological tests or questionnaires: the Brief Symptom Inventory, the Center for Epidemiologic Studies--Depression Scale, the Dyadic Adjustment Scale, a sexual behavior and response questionnaire (Campion), and a study questionnaire. Statistical analyses (chi 2 and analysis of variance) were performed on the confirmed and unconfirmed vulvovaginitis and control groups of women. Women with confirmed and unconfirmed vulvovaginitis scored higher than control women on several psychological variables, but women with unconfirmed vulvovaginitis were found to be significantly more emotionally distressed on psychological tests and to report more discomfort during sexual intercourse than both women with confirmed vulvovaginitis and healthy controls. Psychosocial inquiry is important in the clinical assessment and management of such women. 
The role of radical surgery in the management of radiation recurrent and large volume prostate cancer. Twenty-two patients seen between 1975 and 1988 were analyzed who had surgical attempts to cure locally advanced prostate cancer by exenterative procedures or salvage surgery for radiation recurrent disease. Twelve patients (Group I) underwent either a salvage cystoprostatectomy or perineal prostatectomy for radiorecurrent disease, including three patients with a Kock continent urinary diversion done in combination with the salvage operation. Five of the 12 (41.7%) recurrent disease confined to the surgical specimen and 11 of 12 (91.7%) are alive at a mean follow-up of 49 months, including four patients (25%) with a completely negative serum prostate-specific antigen (PSA) value (less than 0.2 ng/dl). All perineal prostatectomy patients are continent, and two of the three Kock pouch patients are continent. Ten of the 22 patients (Group II) had a cystoprostatectomy or exenteration for locally advanced disease that the surgeon did not think was amenable to standard radical prostatectomy. Only one of these ten patients had negative surgical margins, capsule, and seminal vesicles. Nine are alive (although only one patient has no evidence of disease) at a mean follow-up of 59 months. Morbidity was substantial with a 50% major complication rate including four patients requiring reoperation because of bleeding, abscess, bowel obstruction, or colostomy closure. Salvage procedures for radiorecurrent disease can be done safely, even with the inclusion of a continent diversion, and may be curative or provide survival benefit to carefully selected patients. Cystoprostatectomy or exenteration for locally advanced disease does not appear to be a curative endeavor for most patients and may be accompanied by significant morbidity. 
Drug-induced modification of vascular structure: effects of antihypertensive drugs. It has long been realized that hypertension causes alterations in the peripheral vasculature, with the arterial wall becoming thicker and the lumen relatively smaller. This is particularly true in small resistance arteries, but larger vessels are also affected. The precise mechanisms remain to be determined, although it is highly likely that growth-promoting autacoids are involved as well as mechanical forces. Numerous studies of hypertension in animal models and a few in hypertensive humans have tried to establish the reversibility of these changes after successful lowering of blood pressure. Too few data are available to form firm conclusions, but thiazides and hydralazine-like vasodilators appear to have only a minimal effect on the vasculature. On the other hand, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors are clearly effective, and alpha-blockers may be active. However, it is difficult to derive even tentative conclusions from the available information on calcium antagonists and beta-blockers. These results are discussed in the context of future therapeutic and investigative approaches. 
Correlation between sexual abuse and somatization in women with somatic and nonsomatic chronic pelvic pain. After a comprehensive clinical and psychological evaluation, 99 women with pelvic pain of at least 6 months' duration and normal findings at laparoscopy were divided into two groups, including 47 women with probable somatic causes of pain (group 1) and 52 women without identifiable somatic abnormality (group 2). Women without identifiable somatic abnormality (group 2) were younger, had higher mean somatization scores, and reported an earlier mean age at first intercourse, a higher number of total sexual partners, and a higher prevalence of sexual abuse before the age of 20. Within group 2 (nonsomatic pain) but not within group 1, mean somatization scores were significantly higher among women with a history of sexual abuse than among women with a negative history. When analyzed as risks for nonsomatic pelvic pain, the positive predictive value of both a history of sexual abuse and a high somatization score was 78% (relative risk compared with that of women with zero or one risk factor, 2.1; p less than 0.0001). These data suggest that the psychosocial profile of women with nonsomatic pelvic pain differs from that of women with somatic pelvic pain and that previous sexual abuse is a significant predisposing risk for somatization and non-somatic chronic pelvic pain. 
Restenosis 1 to 24 months after clinically successful coronary balloon angioplasty: a necropsy study of 20 patients. This report describes clinical, morphologic and histologic findings at necropsy late (range 1.6 to 24.1 months [average 8.2 months]) after clinically successful coronary balloon angioplasty in 20 patients with coronary angioplasty restenosis. Clinical evidence of restenosis occurred in 14 patients (70%), including 6 patients with sudden coronary death. Of the 20 patients, 14 (70%) had a cardiac cause of death and 6 (30%) had a noncardiac cause of death. Two major subgroups of histologic findings were observed: 1) intimal proliferation (60%), and 2) atherosclerotic plaque only (40%). Of the eight sites with atherosclerotic plaque only, six were eccentric lesions and two were concentric lesions. No morphologic evidence of previous angioplasty injury (cracks, breaks, tears) was observed in the eight patients with atherosclerotic plaque only. Proposed mechanisms for the development of intimal proliferation involve the reaction of smooth muscle cells and platelets, whereas elastic recoil of overstretched eccentric or concentric atherosclerotic lesions represents the most likely explanation for the findings in the latter subgroup. On the basis of these morphologic findings at angioplasty restenosis sites, specific treatment strategies for restenosis after coronary artery balloon angioplasty are proposed. 
Acute postinfarction septal rupture: long-term results. From 1973 to 1989, 66 patients received early surgical repair for acute postinfarction ventricular septal rupture. Mean age was 64 +/- 7 years (range, 45 to 80 years). Ventricular septal rupture occurred soon after acute myocardial infarction (3.4 +/- 4 days), and the first medical treatment occurred 6.7 +/- 7 days after onset of acute myocardial infarction. Three patients had a previous myocardial infarction. The site of the rupture was anterior in 38 patients (57%) and posterior in 28 (43%). Forty-four patients (67%) were in shock at the time of admission. Intraaortic balloon pumping was used preoperatively in 28. Operation was performed at the time of maximal efficacy of medical treatment. The same technique was used in all cases. Associated procedures included coronary bypass grafting in 5 patients and valvar operation in 5. The patients have been carefully followed up for up to 16 years. Hospital mortality was 45% (30 patients) and was cardiac related or due to acute renal failure in 25 patients (83%). No correlation could be revealed between early death and age, sex, preoperative intraaortic balloon pumping, or year of operation. Location of the ventricular septal rupture (early mortality of 57% for posterior versus 37% for anterior ventricular septal rupture) and shock at the time of admission (52% versus 32%) showed a trend toward significance (0.08 less than or equal to p less than 0.10). Response to initial active therapy has a strong predictive value (mortality of 70% in unresponsive patients versus 14% in responders; p less than 0.001). 
Acute traumatic cervical epidural hematoma from a stab wound. Cervical spinal epidural hematoma is an infrequent entity that usually requires emergency decompressive therapy because of rapid neurologic dysfunction. We present the case of a 34-year-old man who presented to the emergency department with minimal symptomatology after a stab wound to the neck. A computed tomography myelogram of the cervical spine revealed a cervical spinal epidural hematoma. This case illustrates an unusual presentation as well as etiology of cervical spinal epidural hematoma. 
Gastric duplication cyst. Endoscopic presentation as an ulcerated antral mass. A case of a 53-year-old man who presented with epigastric pain and weight loss is described. Endoscopy showed a smooth antral mass with what appeared to be a central overlying ulcer. Computerized tomography and upper gastrointestinal series confirmed the presence of a gastric mass. Laparotomy and local resection showed a gastric duplication comprised of two cysts, one with communication to the stomach lumen. Gastric duplication is a rare entity, especially in the adult. Though generally benign, local ulceration or fistula formation can cause symptoms and may suggest a more malignant process that warrants investigation. 
Biomechanics of fixation systems to the cervical spine. The biomechanical evaluation of a cervical spine implant must include flexural and torsional testing if it is used for stabilizing a traumatic unstable motion segment. A cadaveric model is presented that allows flexural and torsional testing of a cervical spine motion segment, measuring the tilting angle, the translation, and the torsional angle. After measuring the intact segments, in the first series, a so-called posterior instability was created and stabilized posteriorly with the hook-plate and sublaminar wiring; anteriorly with the H-plate; and with combinations of these implants. In a second series, their stabilizing effect after complete discoligamentous instability was tested. With isolated posterior instability, it was found that the flexural stability is preserved, whereas torsional stability is markedly reduced. In cases of isolated posterior instability, only hook plating alone or its combination with anterior H-plating seemed to bring about a higher torsional stability than the intact specimen. In cases of complete discoligamentous instability, only anterior H-plate and posterior hook plate procedures combined or the hook plate alone was able to guarantee both torsional and flexural stability higher than the intact spine. Exclusive posterior wiring without postoperative external immobilization in complete discoligamentous instability may result in permanent subluxation of the functional unit. Exclusive anterior H-plate fixation in complete discoligamentous instability requires additional external immobilization in the postoperative phase to prevent flexion and torsion. 
Postoperative vasospasm after antegrade mesenteric revascularization: a report of three cases. Vascular reconstruction for chronic intestinal ischemia can be accomplished by endarterectomy or aortomesenteric bypass. In our practice, antegrade bypasses from the supraceliac aorta to the celiac axis and superior mesenteric artery are currently the most frequently used techniques. Such reconstructions often use multiple or bifurcated large diameter vascular prostheses and have demonstrated excellent long-term patency. Despite these salutory results, we have noted an unusual perioperative response in three of these patients, which is the subject of this report. All three patients underwent uncomplicated elective mesenteric revascularization with grafts (diameter greater than or equal to 6 mm) originating in the supraceliac aorta. Indications for operation included (1) history of postprandial pain, (2) documentation of weight loss, and (3) angiographic evidence of advanced atherosclerotic disease with appropriate collateral development. Episodes of abdominal pain occurred 5 to 20 days after operation when normal food intake was reinstituted. In two patients immediate angiograms revealed patent grafts with diffuse mesenteric vasospasm. Treatment with intravenous hyperalimentation and nifedipine for 10 days resulted in complete resolution of symptoms. In the third patient, symptoms were totally relieved by temporary reduction in oral intake and administration of nifedipine. A later angiogram revealed a patent graft. All patients have remained asymptomatic and regained normal weight. This pattern of postrevascularization pain has not been seen in our patients undergoing revascularization with small (i.e., venous) conduits originating in the infrarenal aorta. The cause appears to be a heightened myogenic response of a "protected" vascular bed when suddenly exposed to the high perfusion pressure and blood flow of large caliber antegrade conduits. Prophylaxis with calcium channel blockers and use of smaller diameter grafts (5 mm) may avoid this disturbing syndrome. 
Immunohistological diagnosis of "plasmacytoid T cell lymphoma" in paraffin wax sections. An immunohistological study of paraffin wax embedded tissue from three cases of plasmacytoid monocyte neoplasms, using a panel of antibodies which react with fixation resistant leucocyte markers, is reported. This neoplasm was found to have a distinctive antigenic profile, being negative for CD3 and elastase, but positive for CD43 and CD68. This immunological phenotype, coupled with its characteristic morphological features, should facilitate the recognition of this rare neoplasm in routinely processed tissue. Furthermore, the term "plasmacytoid monocyte sarcoma" is proposed to designate it because it is inappropriate to refer to it as a lymphoma. As all cases have been associated with a myeloproliferative disorder (usually an acute or chronic myeloid leukaemia), these tumours probably represent the accumulation in lymphoid tissue of neoplastic cells which have differentiated along the plasmacytoid monocyte pathway. 
Migraine--why and how a cortical excitatory wave may initiate the aura and headache. A large number of clinical and neurophysiological observations are reviewed that clearly indicate that the symptoms of migraine aura result from a spread of an excitatory wave along the cortex from a primary focus. This excitation may start as a consequence of information overload to a low threshold cortical area. The transient neuronal excitation is followed by a long-lasting period of reduced cortical flow, which involves a substantial component of active constriction of resistance vessels, even persisting for several hours during the headache phase. When the excitatory wave has reached and activated free pain fiber endings in sufficiently many cortical vessels, off-branching peripheral motor endings of these fibers may become activated via axon reflexes. These motor endings may be located in cortical microvessels or in small vessels around large dural vessels. This leads to a neurogenic inflammation in the vessel walls, experienced as headache by the sufferer. The wall of dural sinuses offers a rational explanation for the beneficial effect of most medications used in migraine. 
Pelvic denervation for chronic pain associated with endometriosis: fact or fancy? The efficacy of presacral neurectomy and amputation of the uterosacral ligaments in the treatment of chronic pelvic pain has been debated for decades. These procedures used to be done mainly in women with normal pelves, but more recently they have been performed during conservative surgery for treatment of endometriosis. In the 1980s the rapid spread of laparoscopic surgery has led to an increasing number of endoscopic denervations in patients with chronic pelvic pain associated with endometriosis. However, an analysis of literature data has failed to prove that presacral neurectomy and amputation of the uterosacral ligaments are effective and did not demonstrate better results with the use of lasers rather than electrocoagulation. Moreover, no valid comparison has yet been made between laparotomy and laparoscopic methods. 
A phase II study of days 1 and 8 cisplatin and recombinant alpha-2B interferon in advanced non-small cell lung cancer. Preclinical data from studies of human lung cancer xenografts suggest that the cytotoxic effects of cisplatin are enhanced by alpha-interferon. To verify the above observations, the authors initiated a Phase II trial in advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Cisplatin was given at 100 mg/m2 during a 28-day cycle in a divided day 1 and day 8 schedule. Starting on day 1, alpha-2B interferon was administered intramuscularly at a dose of 5 million units three times a week continuously for a minimum of 2 months. Between January 1989 and September 1989, 30 patients were evaluated for response and toxicity. According to the staging system proposed by Mountain, 20 patients had Stage IV disease, 7 had Stage IIIB disease, and 3 had Stage IIIA disease. Expression of neuron-specific enolase (NSE) and Leu-7 was immunohistochemically investigated to evaluate possible relationship to treatment response. The response rate was 13.3% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.2% to 25%). The four responders showed positivity for NSE, and two of them were positive for Leu-7. An average of three cycles was given. The mean dose intensity administered was 83% of the projected dose for cisplatin and 92% of the projected dose for alpha-2B interferon. A standard scale was used to assess interferon toxicity. Hematologic, renal, and systemic side effects were not significant. In advanced NSCLC the addition of alpha-2B interferon did not increase the cisplatin-induced response rate. Further studies should be performed to determine the real value of chemotherapy response in tumors showing positive immunoreactivity for neural markers such as NSE and Leu-7. 
Gastrointestinal carcinoid tumors. Fifty-five patients were evaluated and treated for gastrointestinal (GI) carcinoid tumors at our institution from 1968 through 1988. Thirty patients had primary tumors smaller than 1 cm and were treated surgically or endoscopically by local excision, whereas 25 underwent resection with regional lymphadenectomy for larger primaries. At the time of initial treatment 17 patients demonstrated metastasis. Although 13 of these patients had primary tumors larger than 2 cm, in four patients with ileal carcinoids, the primary measured 0.8 to 1.5 cm. Serosal involvement was present in nine of 17 patients with metastasis. With a follow-up range of 3 months to 20 years, six patients have died with metastatic carcinoid tumor, two patients died without evidence of disease, 12 patients are alive with metastasis, and 35 patients are alive, free of disease. In this series three determinants for risk of metastasis in GI carcinoid tumors were evident: primary size, serosal penetration, and primary site in the small intestine. In patients with any of these risk factors, resection with regional lymphadenectomy is recommended. 
Adrenocorticotropic hormone-independent bilateral adrenocortical macronodular hyperplasia as a distinct subtype of Cushing's syndrome. Enzyme histochemical and ultrastructural study of four cases with a review of the literature. Four patients with adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH)-independent bilateral adrenocortical macronodular hyperplasia (AIMAH) were examined. All of them were men whose ages ranged from 37 to 52 years. Plasma cortisol levels were high, with a loss of diurnal rhythmicity, and plasma ACTH was undetectable. Adrenal cortisol secretion was not suppressed by dexamethasone, but it was ACTH responsive. Test results for corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) also were negative. Image analyses revealed a normal sella turcica and significantly enlarged adrenal glands, which showed enhanced uptake of isotope. Both adrenal glands in all cases were between 72 and 176 g in combined weight and were composed of, and distorted by, yellow nodules. Histologically, small cortical cells with or without lipid, occasional clear cells, and rare compact cells of the usual size were increased in number in the glandular cords. Enzyme histochemically, cortical cells showed weaker activity for 3 beta hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase and other enzymes than did usual cortisol-producing adenomas. Ultrastructurally, they had moderately to poorly developed smooth endoplasmic reticulum. Nonnodular areas of the cortex consisting of nonproliferating cells were atrophic and contained no compact cell zone. This is similar to the adrenal cortices attached to cortisol-producing adenomas. These features are unique to AIMAH and suggest the presence of a distinct subtype of Cushing's syndrome. 
Diagnosis and monitoring of subarachnoid hemorrhage by transcranial color-coded real-time sonography. Thirty-six patients with acute spontaneous subarachnoid hemorrhage (26 caused by rupture of an aneurysm) were examined by transcranial color-coded real-time sonography by using a 2.25-MHz ultrasound transducer. In 20 of these 26 patients (76%), the aneurysm could be identified by a characteristic abnormal blood flow pattern within the aneurysm in coronal and axial scanning planes by transcranial color-coded real-time sonography. Blood within the basal cisterns, on top of the tentorium, and within the ventricles and parenchyma was sonographically detected by increased echodensity in 75%. In addition, cerebrospinal fluid circulation disturbances and cerebral vasospasm were detected in two-dimensional B-mode images in 85% and 100%, respectively. In Doppler mode, intravascular blood flow velocity could be quantified. We conclude that transcranial color-coded real-time sonography, a new, noninvasive method for diagnosis and follow-up of patients with subarachnoid hemorrhage, allows detection of the primary vascular lesion and monitoring of complications. 
Correlates of postural hypotension in a community sample of elderly blacks and whites. Postural hypotension is thought to be prevalent among the elderly, but few community-based studies of this condition have been conducted. In addition, little is known about postural hypotension in blacks despite well documented racial differences in hypertension and stroke. Data on 659 elderly (greater than or equal to 60 years of age) participants in a survey of two rural, biracial townships were analyzed to describe the frequency and correlates of postural hypotension. Twelve percent of the 659 adults experienced a drop of 10 mmHg or greater in systolic blood pressure on going from sitting to standing (supine measures were not available). This degree of postural hypotension was twice as common for whites as for blacks (14.5% vs 7.5%, P = 0.01). Postural hypotension was associated with elevated sitting blood pressure and showed positive but statistically non-significant relationships with anti-hypertensive medications and leanness. The association between race and postural hypotension persisted after adjusting for these and other risk factors (OR = 2.2, 95% CI:1.2,4.0). 
Gall stone disease in African patients with sickle cell anaemia: a preliminary report from Yaounde, Cameroon. Cholecystosonography was undertaken in 90 patients with sickle cell disease aged 15 years and over. Gall stones were found in 26 (28.9%) patients. There was no sex difference, but the incidence increased with age from 13.2% at under 20 years to 75% at 30 years and over. The mean serum cholesterol and total and unconjugated bilirubin concentrations were not significantly different between patients with and without gall stones. As most (80.8%) stones were radiolucent they were probably of pigment type, containing little or no calcium, and further investigation into how they are produced is needed. Sickle cell patients with acute abdominal crisis should have gall bladder disease excluded before a diagnosis of vascular crisis is made. 
Coronary heart disease risk factor profiles in black patients with non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus: paradoxic patterns. PURPOSE: Non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM) in black Americans consists of two variants: one with insulin resistance and one with normal insulin sensitivity. This study examined whether cardiovascular disease risk factors are significantly different between the two variants. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Twenty-two black patients with NIDDM in near-normoglycemic remission who were receiving no pharmacologic therapy for NIDDM were evaluated for insulin sensitivity by the euglycemic insulin clamp, plasma insulin levels, degree of obesity, glucose metabolism, serum total, high-density lipoprotein (HDL), and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol levels, and fasting plasma triglyceride levels. RESULTS: Fifty-nine percent of these patients had normal insulin sensitivity (glucose disposal rate in response to a 1 mU.kg-1.minute-1 insulin infusion greater than 6.0 mg.kg-1.minute-1). The insulin-sensitive patients were less obese (body mass index [BMI] 26.5 +/- 0.6 versus 30.8 +/- 0.9 kg/m2) and had lower fasting plasma insulin levels (56.9 +/- 7.8 versus 88.0 +/- 6.0 pmol/L), lower serum cholesterol (4.47 +/- 0.30 versus 6.39 +/- 0.26 mmol/L), lower serum LDL cholesterol (2.77 +/- 0.31 versus 4.51 +/- 0.27 mmol/L), and lower fasting plasma triglyceride levels (0.83 +/- 0.08 versus 1.45 +/- 0.16 mmol/L) than the insulin-resistant patients. Serum HDL cholesterol was not different between the two groups and was in the high-normal range (1.31 +/- 0.08 and 1.19 +/- 0.07 mmol/L). Univariate analysis demonstrated that serum total cholesterol, LDL cholesterol, and fasting plasma triglycerides were highly correlated with insulin-mediated glucose disposal and fasting plasma insulin. The differences in insulin sensitivity and lipid profiles were independent of obesity, as they were present in six insulin-resistant and six insulin-sensitive patients matched for BMI. CONCLUSIONS: Black patients with the insulin-sensitive variant of NIDDM have a low risk factor profile for cardiovascular disease as compared with those with the insulin-resistant variant, who have a high risk factor profile. A high prevalence of the insulin-sensitive variant of NIDDM in the black population might explain the lower prevalence of angina and myocardial infarction in black patients with NIDDM as compared with white patients with NIDDM. 
Decreased adherence of interleukin 6-treated breast carcinoma cells can lead to separation from neighbors after mitosis. Interleukin 6 (IL-6) has been shown to inhibit the proliferation, but increase the motility, of wild-type ZR-75-1 human ductal breast carcinoma cells, a line of cells that resemble closely the malignant cells cultured from the ascitic effusion. IL-6-treated cells lose their epithelial character, become stellate or fusiform in shape, and migrate away from neighbors. In the wild-type ZR-75-1 cells, IL-6 causes cell-cell separation in preformed colonies as well as postmitotically. We have now investigated the action of IL-6 in clone B ZR-75-1 cells, which are morphologically distinct from wild-type ZR-75-1 cells. In the more polygonal rather than cuboidal clone B cells, IL-6 did not cause early inhibition of DNA synthesis and it caused little cell-cell separation in preformed colonies. However, IL-6 treatment markedly prolonged the interval between mitosis and readherence of daughter cells to their neighbors and the substratum. Supernatants from IL-6-treated cultures contained detached viable cells in increased numbers. Intermitotic intervals were prolonged in IL-6-treated cultures. IL-6-treated dividing breast carcinoma cells are characterized by an increased probability of separation from neighbors and the substratum. 
Visual function in patients undergoing long-term total parenteral nutrition. To evaluate the effects of long-term total parenteral nutrition (TPN) on eye function, 27 adults and 12 children in the UCLA Home TPN Clinic underwent ophthalmoscopic examination and visual-function testing. Direct inspection of the fundus showed a marked granularity of the retinal pigmented epithelium in some patients. About one-half of the children and one-third of the adults tested had at least one and usually two abnormalities in their electroretinogram. Determination of blood nutrients thought to affect vision revealed that zinc and vitamin E were within normal range. Vitamin A concentrations were above normal in 10 of 19 adults and selenium concentrations were below normal in 10 of 10 children and 17 of 21 adults tested. Linoleic and linolenic acid concentrations were low; plasma, platelet, and urine taurine concentrations were significantly lower than normal. Despite these diffuse nutrient abnormalities, only zinc and vitamin E concentrations correlated significantly with any index of visual function. 
Lymphomas in University College Hospital, Ibadan, Nigeria. The authors reviewed 508 cases of lymphoma seen during a 16-year period in University College Hospital, Ibadan, Nigeria. Hodgkin's disease was diagnosed in 95 (18.6%) patients, of which 45% had mixed cellularity type; 19%, lymphocyte predominance; 18%, nodular sclerosis; and 18%, lymphocyte depletion. The age distribution showed a single mode in the 11 to 25-year-old group. Male preponderance was more marked in children who made up 32% of the Hodgkin's disease patients. Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma occurred in 413 cases, of which 296 (71.7%) were high-grade malignancies. Burkitt's tumor occurred in 211 (41.5%) patients, 95% of whom were children, and showed a male to female ratio of 1.7:1. Compared with previous findings in this hospital, Hodgkin's disease showed increased proportions of the lymphocyte predominant and nodular sclerosing types. However, the characteristics of Burkitt's lymphoma did not change appreciably in the last three decades. 
Influence of environmental temperature on the blood pressure of hypertensive patients in Montreal. To assess the influence of environmental temperature on blood pressure, we analyzed 42,813 readings of systolic and diastolic blood pressures in recumbent and upright positions in 2,000 hypertensive patients in our clinic in correlation to noon temperature and mean daily temperature in Montreal. The sample comprised 860 men and 1140 women with an average age of 55 years. Analysis of variance showed highly statistically significant negative correlations for all blood pressure values between different noon temperature, as well as mean daily temperature, groups. The greatest difference for systolic blood pressure was 7 mm Hg, and for diastolic blood pressure it was 3 mm Hg, within the -24 degrees C to 27 degrees C temperature range. The same relationship between blood pressure and different environmental temperatures was also seen when the blood pressure recordings were divided between temperature below 0 degree C and above 0 degree C, ie, within the winter or summer months. This environmental effect may have a clinically significant impact because thermosensitivity appears to be related to hypertension. 
Increased tryptase levels in suction-blister fluid from patients with urticaria. The levels of tryptase in the suction-blister fluid from patients with chronic urticaria, urticaria pigmentosa, cholinergic urticaria, urticarial dermographism, prurigo of unknown origin, eczema, psoriasis, atopic dermatitis, and from healthy controls were studied. The blister fluid from controls contained up to 15 micrograms/l of tryptase, whereas that from patients with active urticaria contained greater than 50 micrograms/l. This study demonstrates that patients with urticaria have mast cells that readily release tryptase in both the lesional and non-lesional areas of skin. 
Nephrogenic rests in Wilms tumor patients with the Drash syndrome. The histological specimens from 12 patients with the Drash syndrome were identified from the National Wilms Tumor Study Group and reviewed for the presence of nephrogenic rests. Of 7 patients with the complete Drash syndrome 6 were evaluable for nephrogenic rests, including 5 (83%) who demonstrated intralobar nephrogenic rests. Of 5 (80%) partial Drash syndrome cases 4 (80%) were also intralobar nephrogenic rest positive. Neither group had perilobar nephrogenic rests identified. In a control population of Wilms tumor patients without the Drash syndrome only 39 of 274 (14%) with unilateral tumor had intralobar nephrogenic rests identified, whereas 26 of 92 (28%) bilateral cases had intralobar nephrogenic rests. There was a significantly higher rate of intralobar nephrogenic rests in complete and partial Drash syndrome cases than in the general Wilms tumor population (p less than 0.001). Wilms tumor patients with intralobar nephrogenic rests and the Drash syndrome present at a younger age and have a higher rate of bilaterality than rest negative Wilms tumor patients. The strong association of intralobar nephrogenic rests in the Drash syndrome approaches that found in the aniridia complex. However, in other syndromes associated with Wilms tumor, such as the Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome and hemihypertrophy, there is a high prevalence of perilobar nephrogenic rests. In view of the high incidence of intralobar nephrogenic rests in complete and partial Drash syndrome patients, it is probable that events leading to Wilms tumor in patients with the Drash syndrome occur at an early stage in nephrogenesis. 
Nonfunctioning parathyroid carcinoma. Parathyroid carcinoma is a rare clinical entity accounting for only 4 per cent of all cases of parathyroid neoplasia. Nonfunctioning parathyroid carcinoma is even rarer. Previously, virtually all patients with these lesions were treated for a nonspecific neck mass. However, in the present case, a preoperative diagnosis of nonfunctioning parathyroid carcinoma was made based on the technetium pertechnetate/thallium 201 subtraction scan. The authors report on the 14th case of nonfunctioning parathyroid carcinoma, a review of the literature, and guidelines for the preoperative and operative evaluation of neck masses suspected to be parathyroid carcinoma. 
Children with epilepsy: the effect of seizures, syndromes, and etiological factors on cognitive functioning. Overall, children with epilepsy have poorer concentration and mental processing and are less alert than age-matched controls. The relationship between cognitive functioning and epilepsy is complex, however, with widely differing degrees of intellectual impairment--ranging from minimal to severe and progressive--related to diverse types of epileptic seizures, syndromes, and etiological factors. Prolonged and frequently repeated seizures are typically associated with more severe effects on cognitive functioning, particularly if epilepsy is symptomatic, i.e., secondary to a demonstrable brain lesion. A combination of such factors may contribute to the mental deterioration seen in many children suffering from severe epilepsy. 
Phase I study of liposomal MTP-PE-activated autologous monocytes administered intraperitoneally to patients with peritoneal carcinomatosis. We have conducted a phase I study with autologous monocytes activated ex vivo and administered intraperitoneally in nine patients with peritoneal carcinomatosis. Blood monocytes were collected by leukapheresis and then purified by counterflow elutriation (up to 10(9) cells, with a purity of greater than 90%). Ex vivo activation was obtained by incubating these cells with 1 micrograms liposomal MTP-PE/10(6) monocytes for 18 hours in hydrophobic culture bags at 37 degrees C in 5% carbon dioxide humidified air. The activated monocytes were then infused in the peritoneal cavity once a week for 5 consecutive weeks through an implanted peritoneal infusion system, Port-A-Cath (Pharmacia Deltec, St Paul, MN), on an intrapatient dose-escalating schedule (10(7) to 10(9) monocytes). No severe adverse reactions occurred. Toxicity was mild, the chief acute reactions being fever (27%), chills (13%), and abdominal pain (25%). None of the side effects led to dose reduction. No consistent change in hemostatic function, liver function, or renal function was observed. Significant increases in granulocyte counts, neopterine, and acute phase reactants (fibrinogen, C-reactive protein) occurred in the peripheral blood. In vitro monocyte activation was demonstrated by the relapse of procoagulant activity and monokines (interleukin-1 [IL-1], IL-6, and tumor necrosis factor-alpha [TNF alpha]) in the supernatants of cultured monocytes. Evidence for in vivo monocyte activation was provided by the increase of these monokines in the peritoneal fluids. Kinetic studies with indium-111 (111In)-labeled activated autologous monocytes in five patients suggest that these infused monocytes may remain in the peritoneal cavity for up to 7 days. This locoregional immunotherapeutic approach seems to be encouraging in view of adjuvant therapeutic modality in ovarian cancer patients with minimal residual intraabdominal disease following second-look laparotomy. 
Cancer screening by primary care physicians. Can we explain the differences? BACKGROUND. Physicians perform cancer screening tests less often than recommended. METHODS. Forty primary care physicians were surveyed to assess their knowledge, attitudes, and experiences regarding cancer and cancer screening, and patients' medical records were reviewed to measure physicians' screening rates. RESULTS. Over 80% of physicians believed doctors should urge screening. On average, 23% of their patient visits were scheduled primarily for preventive care interventions. Screening performance scores expressed the percentage of compliance with the American Cancer Society's recommendations and demonstrated the low levels of compliance for six out of seven tests; however, there was substantial variance in performance among physicians. The best predictors of screening performance were (1) the percentage of visits scheduled primarily for prevention (mammography, and pelvic and breast examinations [P less than .05]); and (2) the number of medical journals read regularly (stool occult blood test [P less than .01], sigmoidoscopy [P less than .01], and Papanicolaou smear [P less than .02]). Also, female physicians performed more Papanicolaou smears (P less than .05) and scheduled more visits for preventive care (P less than .001). CONCLUSIONS. A small group of predictors explain large portions of the variance in cancer screening performance. 
Rehabilitation in rheumatic diseases. What's new. In the past decade, considerable change has occurred in concepts of rehabilitation in patients with rheumatic diseases. This includes approaches to functional assessment and outcome, new concepts in exercise, and new orthotics. 
Intermediate septal accessory pathways: electrocardiographic characteristics, electrophysiologic observations and their surgical implications Intermediate septal accessory pathways are located in close proximity to the atrioventricular (AV) node and His bundle, have unique features that distinguish them from typical anterior and posterior accessory pathways and have been associated with a high risk for unsuccessful pathway division and the production of complete AV block after surgery. Between July 1986 and May 1990, 4 of 70 patients (3 men and 1 woman; mean age 33 +/- 13 years) undergoing surgery for accessory pathway division were found to have an intermediate septal accessory pathway. The presenting arrhythmia was atrial fibrillation with rapid anterograde conduction over the accessory pathway in two patients and recurrent orthodromic reciprocating tachycardia in two patients. In all patients, the delta wave on the electrocardiogram (ECG) was inverted in lead V1, but two patterns of delta wave configuration were observed. In three patients (type 1 intermediate septal accessory pathway), the delta wave was upright in lead II, inverted in lead III and isoelectric in lead a VF; the transition from a negative to an upright delta wave occurred in lead V2. The fourth patient exhibited a different delta wave pattern (type 2 intermediate septal accessory pathway). The delta wave was upright in each of leads II, III and aVF; the transition from a negative to an upright delta wave occurred at lead V3. Intraoperative electrophysiologic study localized the atrial insertion of type 1 pathways to the midpoint of Koch's triangle close to the AV node. 
Septicaemia after colonoscopy in patients with cirrhosis. Two patients with ulcerative colitis and chronic active hepatitis with cirrhosis, who developed Gram negative septicaemia after colonoscopy are described. These and two similar reported cases indicate that giving prophylactic antibiotics to patients with cirrhosis undergoing colonoscopy should be considered, particularly when the cirrhosis is advanced. 
The chemoreflex control of breathing and its measurement. The chemoreflex control of breathing is described in terms of a graphical model. The central chemoreflex, the ventilatory response to carbon dioxide mediated by the central chemoreceptors, is modelled as a straight-line relation between the ventilatory response and the arterial level of carbon dioxide. The peripheral chemoreflex, the ventilatory response to carbon dioxide and hypoxia mediated by the peripheral chemoreceptors, is broken into two relations. First, a straight-line relation between the ventilatory response and the arterial level of carbon dioxide whose slope (sensitivity) increases as the oxygen level varies from hyperoxic to hypoxic. Second, a rectangular hyperbolic relation between the ventilatory response and the arterial level of oxygen with ventilation increasing with increasing hypoxia. The three ventilatory response relations (one central and two peripheral) add to produce the total chemoreflex ventilatory response which forms the feedback part of the respiratory regulator. The forward part consists of the relation between the arterial level of carbon dioxide and ventilation when ventilation is controlled (the metabolic hyperbola). The forward and feedback parts of the respiratory regulator can be combined so as to predict resting ventilation and carbon dioxide levels under a number of circumstances. Methods of measurement of these chemoreflex ventilatory responses are also described so as to illustrate the physiological principles involved in the model. 
Are demented patients with Parkinson's disease accurately reflected in prevalence surveys? A survival analysis. We re-reviewed 257 patient records previously reviewed for an incidence study of dementia in Parkinson's disease (PD) to determine the frequency, date of death, and cause of death. We posited that if disease duration is shortened when dementia occurs, then dementia may be far more common than reflected in prevalence studies. There were 17 deaths among 65 demented patients and 28 deaths among 168 nondemented patients. When we matched a subset of the nondemented patients to the demented patients by age and disease duration distributions, the demented subjects had significantly more deaths (p less than 0.02), and survival among demented subjects was decreased (p less than 0.05). Dementia was a significant predictor of death in this sample. We conclude that dementia reduces survival in patients with PD. Incidence is a much better measure of dementia in PD than prevalence because shortened duration makes it less likely to detect dementia in prevalence surveys. 
Management of nasal fractures. Fracture of the nasal skeleton is a relatively common injury. Satisfactory treatment requires appropriate skills, diagnosis, and management. Some injuries require immediate attention; others are better treated in delayed fashion. Closed reduction provides satisfactory treatment in the majority of nasal fractures; however, open reduction often is a more appropriate choice. Injuries to the nasal septum should be recognized and given proper treatment. 
Monthly pulses of vincristine and prednisone prevent bone marrow and testicular relapse in low-risk childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia: a report of the CCG-161 study by the Childrens Cancer Study Group. On study CCG-161 of the Childrens Cancer Study Group (CCSG), 631 children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) at low risk for relapse were randomized to receive monthly pulses of vincristine-prednisone (VCR-PDN ) during maintenance therapy in addition to standard therapy with mercaptopurine (6MP) and methotrexate (MTX), and either cranial irradiation during consolidation or intrathecal (IT) MTX every 3 months during maintenance. All patients received six doses of IT MTX during induction and consolidation. With a minimum follow-up time of 4.25 years, 76.7% receiving VCR-PDN were in continuous complete remission at 5 years, in contrast to 63.9% receiving GMP-MTX alone (P = .002). The difference in relapse-free survival was due primarily to bone marrow relapse (P = .0008), and in boys also to testicular relapse (P = .003). Among the nonirradiated patients, the 5-year disease-free survival (DFS) was 79.4% for patients randomized to the VCR-PDN pulses, in contrast to 61.2% for the patients randomized to receive 6MP-MTX alone (P = .0002). Among the irradiated patients, the DFS was not significantly different. Of the four combinations of maintenance and CNS therapy studied, the highest DFS was achieved with VCR-PDN pulses and maintenance IT MTX. 
Quality of life before and after orthotopic hepatic transplantation. Fifty-three nonalcoholic patients were evaluated prior to liver transplantation and again approximately 3 years after surgery using the Sickness Impact Profile and Social Behavior Adjustment Schedule. Test-retest scores reflected significant improvement across all health and psychosocial scales of the Sickness Impact Profile. On the Social Behavior Adjustment Schedule, significant improvement was observed on scales measuring disturbed behavior, social role performance, and burden. Comparisons between groups indicated that the liver transplant patients were still impaired on eight of the Sickness Impact Profile scales after transplant; however, the severity of disturbance was not considered to be clinically significant. No between-group differences were noted on the Social Behavior Adjustment Schedule. These results indicate that liver transplantation is associated with substantial improvement in life quality, although as a group, the patients undergoing this surgery do not recover to the level of functioning demonstrated by normal individuals. 
Chylothorax complicating right upper lobectomy. Chylothorax after pleuropulmonary surgery is unusual. We have described the case of a patient in whom this complication followed a right upper lobectomy. Early recognition is important to avoid potential morbidity and mortality. 
Safety and efficacy of repeat thrombolytic treatment after acute myocardial infarction. Thrombolytic treatment for acute myocardial infarction increases the risk of subsequent reocclusion of the infarct related artery. The efficacy and safety of repeat thrombolytic treatment was assessed in 31 patients treated with streptokinase (n = 13) or tissue plasminogen activator (n = 18) a median of five days (1-716) after the first infusion. The indication for readministration was prolonged chest pain with new ST segment elevation. Efficacy was assessed by infarct artery patency at angiography at a median of eight days after readministration in 22 patients and by non-invasive criteria in 23 patients (reperfusion was deemed to be likely if serum creatine kinase was not increased or reached a peak less than 12 hours after infarction). Angiography showed patency of 70% of the infarct arteries after readministration of streptokinase and of 75% after tissue plasminogen activator. The corresponding patency rates assessed noninvasively were 73% and 75%. Reinfarction was prevented in nine (29%) patients. Allergic reactions occurred in four of eight patients who received streptokinase twice (plasmacytosis and acute reversible renal failure developed in one patient). Two patients had major bleeding and two minor bleeding, all after tissue plasminogen activator, and one of them died of cerebral haemorrhage. Repeat thrombolytic treatment results in late patency rates similar to the rates after the initial administration. Allergic reactions were common in those treated twice with streptokinase. 
A prospective evaluation of hepatic resection for colorectal carcinoma metastases to the liver: Gastrointestinal Tumor Study Group Protocol 6584. We report here the results of the first multiinstitutional prospective evaluation of patients considered to have potentially resectable hepatic metastases from colorectal carcinoma. One hundred fifty-six patients were enrolled from 15 institutions. Six patients were subsequently excluded. One hundred fifty patients underwent surgery and are evaluable for analysis (median follow-up time, 3.1 years; range, 4 months to 5.1 years). Curative resection could be performed on 46% of patients (69 of 150), noncurative resection on 12% (18 of 150), while 42% were found to be unresectable (63 of 150). Thirty-day surgical mortality and morbidity rates in patients with attempted resection were 2.7% and 13%, respectively. The curative resection group was observed to have an improved median survival (37.1 months) compared with the noncurative resection group (21.2 months) and the unresectable group (16.5 months) (P less than .01). Computed tomographic (CT) scan was a poor predictor for resectability, and age was not a contraindication to curative resection. Preoperative carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) values were also a poor predictor for resectability. However, the median CEA value 61 to 180 days postsurgery was significantly higher in unresectable patients compared with median CEA levels in noncuratively and curatively resected groups (P less than .01). Our results imply that curative resection leads to an increase in median survival. Noncurative resection provides no benefit to asymptomatic patients, since unresectable and noncurative resection groups have similar life expectancies. Longer follow-up will be needed to demonstrate the ultimate impact of curative resection on survival. 
Mitotane enhances cytotoxicity of chemotherapy in cell lines expressing a multidrug resistance gene (mdr-1/P-glycoprotein) which is also expressed by adrenocortical carcinomas. P-Glycoprotein (Pgp), product of the mdr-1 gene, is a 130- to 180-kDa plasma membrane phosphoglycoprotein which mediates multidrug resistance in cell culture by increasing efflux of the natural product chemotherapeutic agents. High levels of expression of mdr-1/Pgp are found in both the normal adrenal and adrenocortical cancers. By RNA in situ hybridization the expression in adrenocortical cancer is shown to be widely distributed. The present study demonstrates that decreased drug accumulation mediated by mdr-1/Pgp can be overcome by clinically achievable concentrations of mitotane (o,p'-DDD). The increase in drug accumulation with the addition of mitotane is due at least in part to a decrease in drug efflux and results in an increase in cytotoxicity when agents of the natural product class are used. This effect is observed in cells with a broad range of mdr-1/Pgp expression, including levels comparable to those found in most adrenocortical cancers. Similar increases in drug accumulation can be demonstrated in an unselected adrenocortical cancer cell line that expresses mdr-1/Pgp. The finding that multidrug resistance mediated by mdr-1/Pgp can be reversed by mitotane provides a rational basis for exploring the use of mitotane in combination with natural product chemotherapeutic agents in adrenocortical cancer. 
Establishment and characterization of a human carcinoid in nude mice and effect of various agents on tumor growth. The authors have established a long-term tissue culture cell line (BON) derived from a metastatic human carcinoid tumor of the pancreas. The cells have been in continuous passage for 46 months. Tissue culture cells produce tumors in a dose-dependent fashion after SC inoculation of cell suspensions in athymic nude mice. BON tumors, grown in nude mice, are histologically identical to the original tumor; they possess gastrin and somatostatin receptors, synthesize serotonin and chromogranin A, and have a doubling time of approximately 13 days. The antiproliferative effects of the long-acting somatostatin analogue, SMS 201-995 (300 micrograms/kg, t.i.d.), and 2% alpha-difluoromethylornithine on BON xenografts in nude mice were examined. Tumor size was significantly decreased by day 14 of treatment with either agent and at all points of analysis thereafter until the animals were killed (day 33). In addition, tumor weight, DNA, RNA, and protein contents were significantly decreased in treated mice compared with controls. Establishment of this human carcinoid xenograft line, BON, provides an excellent model to study further the biological behavior of carcinoid tumors and the in vivo effect of chemotherapeutic agents on tumor growth. 
Xenobiotic enzyme profiles and Parkinson's disease. Xenobiotic enzymic systems have been studied in Parkinson's disease. Platelet monoamine oxidase-B activity is increased by the use of phenylethylamine but decreased by the use of dopamine as substrate. Enzymes involved with sulfur oxidation and methylation are underactive. 
Emergency medical services and the pediatric patient. III: Resources of ambulatory care centers. Ambulatory care centers have emerged as a new health care resource in many communities. Little information is available about the services that these centers offer to pediatric patients. A national survey of 254 ambulatory care centers was undertaken to determine their characteristics, including the number of pediatric patients seen, staffing patterns, and pediatric equipment and supplies available. Most clinics were located in urban areas and were within 5 miles of a hospital. They were staffed primarily by physicians who were board certified in emergency medicine, internal medicine, or family medicine. Not all centers had registered nurses on duty and few used extended-role nurses or physicians's assistants. The centers saw an average of 18 patients younger than 18 years of age per day. Some ambulatory care centers received emergency medical service and private ambulance calls and encountered serious illness such as chest pain, seizures, and anaphylaxis; the majority, however, handled mainly minor injuries and illnesses. Although most had pediatric equipment and supplies, some did not have a complete set of pediatric resuscitation equipment even though they were part of the emergency system offering care to the pediatric population. 
Associated neurologic and ophthalmologic findings in congenital oculomotor nerve palsy. Unlike acquired oculomotor nerve palsy in childhood, the congenital form is usually considered to be an isolated disorder, not associated with other neurologic or systemic disease. In a series of 14 patients with this diagnosis, 10 had associated neurologic disorders. Clinical-neuroradiologic correlation identified the brainstem as the site of the lesion in some patients. The ipsilateral pupil was involved in 12 patients and was miotic with a trace or no reaction to light on the side of the palsy in 8 of the 12 patients. In two of these eight patients, the pupil was documented to be dilated and fixed in early infancy and subsequently became miotic at several months of age, concurrent with emergence of other signs of aberrant reinnervation. Pupillary miosis as a result of aberrant reinnervation appears to be much more frequent after congenital than acquired pupillary-involving oculomotor palsy. Four patients showed better visual acuity in the paretic eye, an unexpected finding. The paretic eye appeared to have a fixational advantage if the patient had nystagmus, presumably due to asymmetric dampening of the nystagmus. Significant anisometropia and astigmatic errors in the paretic eye were present in essentially all patients. 
Combined treatment of symptomatic gallbladder stones by extracorporeal shock-wave lithotripsy (ESWL) and instillation of methyl tert-butyl ether (MTBE). Twenty-four patients with symptomatic gallbladder stones (12 radiolucent and 12 calcified) were treated by a combined approach of extracorporeal shock-wave lithotripsy (ESWL) and subsequent instillation of methyl tert-butyl ether (MTBE). The patients received a mean of 1500 +/- 185 shock-wave discharges. The mean instillation time of MTBE was 13 +/- 4.2 hr. Treatment was tolerated without major adverse effects. Within a time period of three to five days eight of 12 patients with pure radiolucent stones and four of 12 with calcified stones became stone-free. After a median follow-up of five months (range: one week to 26 months), a total of 11 patients (92%) with radiolucent stones and of eight patients (66%) of those with calcified stones were free of stones, fragments, or debris. These clearance rates appear high when compared with reports on monotherapy with ESWL or MTBE, suggesting a positive effect of a combined approach in selected patients. Two patients exhibited recurrent stones after six and seven months, respectively. 
Transpalpebral extrusion of a silicone sponge exoplant. We report an unusual case of scleral buckle extrusion in a 63-year-old woman. A 5 mm silicone sponge exoplant eroded through Tenon's capsule, conjunctiva, and full-thickness upper eyelid, traversing the tarsal plate. 
The role of endoscopic papillotomy in ascending cholangitis. The role of endoscopic papillotomy in calculous cholangitis is unclear. A retrospective review of 41 patients admitted to hospital with calculous cholangitis was carried out. There were 30 women and 11 men and their ages ranged between 49 and 98 years (mean age 77). All patients presented with abdominal pain, tenderness, chills, and fever. Clinical jaundice was present in 95 per cent of the patients. Initial endoscopic papillotomy was successful in 17 of the 41 patients. In 24 patients cholangitis persisted or recurred and further therapy was carried out. Surgery was successful in controlling sepsis in ten of the 24 patients. Repeat endoscopic papillotomy was successful in four of 13 patients. Surgery was successful in one of nine patients who had failed repeat endoscopic papillotomy. Nasobiliary drainage and percutaneous transhepatic drainage of the common bile duct after failed repeat endoscopic papillotomy was successful in only two of nine patients. Six patients died after failed repeat endoscopic papillotomy. We conclude that initial endoscopic papillotomy should be attempted in patients with calculous cholangitis. Surgical exploration of the common bile duct should then be carried out if initial endoscopic papillotomy fails to control cholangitis. 
Outcome of infants and children with dilated cardiomyopathy. A review of 81 infants and children with dilated, poorly contracting left ventricles without associated structural abnormalities was undertaken to identify risk factors for poor outcome, which could be used in selecting candidates for cardiac transplantation. Significant atrial or ventricular dysrhythmias, or both, were detected on presentation or during follow-up in 24 patients. Arrhythmias were present in only 8 of 51 survivors (16%) but were detected in 16 of 30 patients (53%) who died (p less than 0.05). Patients dying suddenly were even more likely to have had documented dysrhythmias (8 of 11, p less than 0.05). Left ventricular shortening fraction was similar in survivors and nonsurvivors (14.9 +/- 1.0% vs 15.3 +/- 1.7%). Left ventricular end-diastolic pressure in 44 patients who had cardiac catheterization averaged 20.8 +/- 1.6 mm Hg. Left ventricular end-diastolic pressure was significantly higher in patients who died than in those who survived (29.5 +/- 2.2 vs 15.0 +/- 1.6 mm Hg, p less than 0.001). Analysis of actuarial survival revealed that mortality was highest during the first 6 months after presentation (19% mortality). Survival declined more gradually thereafter and was 70% at 2 years, 64% at 5 years and 52% after 11.5 years. Age at initial presentation did not have any significant impact on survival. However, left ventricular end-diastolic pressure greater than 25 torr was associated with a significantly increased mortality rate (p less than 0.05). Early cardiac transplantation should be considered in patients with markedly elevated left ventricular end-diastolic pressure or complex atrial or ventricular arrhythmias. 
Upper abdominal cancer surgery in the very elderly. From January 1981 to December 1987, 59 major upper abdominal operations were performed on 57 patients aged 80 to 90 years at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center. Procedures for primary adenocarcinoma of the stomach, distal esophagus, pancreas, or hepatobiliary system were performed with curative intent or for palliation in 34 of 59 patients (58%) and bypass with limited or no resection in 13 of 59 patients (22%) patients. Emergency operations were performed in six (10%) patients for gastric bleeding, perforation, or outlet obstruction. Six (10%) patients underwent laparotomy for benign biliary obstruction (1), splenectomy for secondary thrombocytopenia (2), or gastrectomy for sarcoma (2) or lymphoma (1). Hospital mortality was 15% overall and 9% for major resections, 15% for bypass, and 67% for emergency procedures. Major complications occurred in 10 (20%) elective procedures. Mortality was associated with respiratory or cardiac failure while complications most commonly included arrhythmias and wound infection. Mean postoperative hospitalization was 18 days overall and 45 patients (76%) were discharged home. Median survival following major resection was 17.5 months but less than 2 months after bypass procedures. A protocol of pre-operative evaluation, intra-operative hemodynamic monitoring and postoperative intensive care has been formalized for use in elderly or poor-risk patients. 
Insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus and hypertension. Contrasting results have been reported regarding the prevalence of hypertension in insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM), showing a slightly higher or normal percentage of IDDM patients with elevated blood pressure levels than in the general population. Most of the cross-sectional and prospective studies on the prevalence of hypertension in IDDM show an association between microalbuminuria and elevated blood pressure levels. However, it is not clear whether hypertension is simply secondary to kidney damage or whether hypertension occurs with or even before the development of impaired kidney function. Patients with IDDM have a higher exchangeable body Na+ pool. Na+ retention in IDDM is accounted for by several metabolic and hormonal abnormalities such as hyperglycemia, hyperketonemia, hyperinsulinemia, altered secretion, and resistance to atrial natriuretic peptide. High blood pressure appears to be dependent, at least at some phase, on expansion of extracellular fluid volume as a consequence of defects in the renal secretion of Na+ and water. On the other hand, a tendency toward Na+ retention characterizes all patients with IDDM, whereas hypertension develops only in a subgroup of diabetic patients. One possible explanation for these findings is that a genetic predisposition plays a role in creating susceptibility to hypertension and perhaps to diabetic nephropathy independent of diabetes, even if Na+ retention can further deteriorate this susceptibility to hypertension. With regard to this issue, it has recently been suggested that the risk of kidney disease in patients with IDDM is associated with a genetic predisposition to hypertension. Furthermore, diabetic nephropathy occurs in familial clusters, because diabetic siblings of nephropathic diabetic patients show a higher frequency of diabetic nephropathy than the diabetic siblings of nonnephropathic diabetic patients. One of the possible genetic markers that could be useful to identify the diabetic patients with susceptibility to hypertension and diabetic nephropathy is the Na+(-)Li+ countertransport activity in erythrocytes. 
Sonography in the diagnosis of acute appendicitis. Acute appendicitis can be a diagnostic dilemma. The classic triad of leukocytosis, pain at McBurney's point and a history compatible with appendicitis has a diagnostic accuracy rate of only 80 percent. Ultrasonography, combined with this triad, can improve the diagnostic accuracy, decreasing the negative laparotomy rate from 20 percent to less than 10 percent. 
Source of tubercle bacilli in cervical lymph nodes: a prospective study. A prospective study searching for associated mycobacterial infection of the upper aerodigestive tract in patients with cervical tuberculous lymphadenitis (TBLN) was carried out. One hundred and thirteen patients with a clinical suspicion of cervical TBLN were included. All patients had a physical examination of the upper aerodigestive tract. Routine endoscopy and biopsy of the nasopharynx were performed. All of them had surgery to the cervical lymph node. Seventy-five patients had histologically confirmed cervical TBLN. Culture of the lymph node specimen showed Mycobacterium tuberculosis in 68 (90 per cent). In 45 (60 per cent) patients with cervical TBLN the primary foci of infection could not be found. Twenty-nine (39 per cent) had radiographic evidence of active or healed pulmonary tuberculosis. Sputum culture from two patients showed Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Five patients (six per cent) had tuberculous nasopharyngitis. In one of them (one per cent) the tuberculous nasopharyngitis was primary as no other evidence of mycobacterial infection was found. In the present study, mycobacterial infection of other parts of the upper aerodigestive tract was not found. 
Down-regulation of messenger ribonucleic acid and protein levels for estrogen receptors by phorbol ester and calcium in MCF-7 cells. Treatment of MCF-7 cells, a human mammary carcinoma cell line, with phorbol ester [12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA)] or calcium ionophore (A23187) was associated with striking effects on levels of estrogen receptor (ER) mRNA, specific binding of 17 beta-[3H]estradiol [( 3H]E2), and immunoreactive ER. TPA (10(-7) M) caused a time-dependent reduction of ER mRNA which was below the level of detection after 9 h. Similar effects of TPA appeared at levels of specific binding of [3H]E2 as well as immunoreactive ER. In contrast, TPA induced an increase in mRNA for beta-actin. Incubation of MCF-7 cells with increasing concentrations of TPA (10(-11)-10(-7) M) was associated with biphasic effects on ER mRNA and proteins. Levels of immunoreactive progesterone receptors (PR) were induced by E2 (10(-9) M) in a time-dependent manner. In the presence of TPA (10(-7) M), where ER levels were suppressed, no induction of PR was observed. Removal of TPA (10(-7) M) after 10 h (ER mRNA) or 22 h (ER proteins) of treatment was associated with a continued suppression of both mRNA and protein levels during the entire incubation period (48 h). Treatment with A23187 (2 x 10(-7) M) also caused a time-dependent down-regulation of levels of ER mRNA and proteins. These effects occurred somewhat more slowly than those of TPA. Levels of beta-actin mRNA were not changed by this treatment. These results indicate that changes in estrogen sensitivity are mediated by calcium-dependent protein kinases in human mammary carcinoma MCF-7 cells. 
Examination of cardiorespiratory changes during upper gastrointestinal endoscopy. Comparison of monitoring of arterial oxygen saturation, arterial pressure and the electrocardiogram. Critical events including hypoxaemia, arrhythmias and myocardial ischaemia may occur more frequently during endoscopic procedures than during anaesthesia. A study was undertaken to assess the cardiovascular changes and to evaluate suitable monitoring techniques to detect critical events during sedation and endoscopy. Twenty patients scheduled to undergo a prolonged endoscopic procedure which required deep sedation were studied. Continuous recordings of electrocardiogram, heart rate and arterial oxygen saturation were made and arterial pressure was recorded at one-minute intervals. The study commenced immediately before administration of sedatives, continued for the duration of the examination and for one hour following the examination. Oxygen saturation decreased in all patients during the examination to a mean of 82.9% (SD 11.9), and remained below baseline for the duration of the examination and into the recovery period. Statistically significant increases and reductions of systolic arterial pressure and rate-pressure product were found during the procedures compared with baseline values recorded before administration of sedatives. Sixteen of the 20 patients developed tachycardia during the examination. Ten patients developed ectopic foci which were supraventricular, ventricular or both in origin. Electrocardiogram changes resolved during the recovery period. Myocardial ischaemia was assessed by S-T segment depression and a significant correlation was found between S-T segment depression and hypoxaemia, although the magnitude of the S-T depression was small and may not have been detected clinically. No correlation was found between S-T segment depression and arterial pressure, heart rate or rate-pressure product. 
Pathogenesis of pulmonary edema during interleukin-2 therapy: correlation of chest radiographic and clinical findings in 54 patients. The pathogenesis of pulmonary edema that occurs during interleukin-2 therapy has often been attributed to an increase in pulmonary capillary permeability. However, renal insufficiency, fluid overload, and hypotension also develop in many patients. These manifestations of systemic toxicity may contribute to the development of pulmonary edema during therapy. Understanding the cause of pulmonary edema during interleukin-2 therapy could directly affect patients' care. Therefore, we reviewed the chest radiographs and clinical course of 54 patients who received high-dose interleukin-2 therapy and lymphokine-activated killer cells for advanced carcinoma. The type, frequency, and course over time of pulmonary abnormalities were recorded and correlated with clinical measures of renal function, fluid status, and blood pressure. Focal or diffuse parenchymal lung opacities were found on radiographs in 43 (80%) of 54 patients. Findings of interstitial pulmonary edema were most common, occurring in 76% of patients. Weight gain, hypotension, and elevation of the serum creatinine level were not associated statistically with interstitial edema. Diffuse air-space disease developed in 20% of patients. Focal consolidation, which was associated with positive central venous catheter cultures (p less than .03), developed in 28% of patients. Pleural effusion occurred in 48% of patients and was associated with all types of parenchymal disease. These data suggest that the frequent development of pulmonary edema during interleukin-2 therapy is not due to renal insufficiency, fluid overload, or hypotension, but is more likely the result of an interleukin-2-related increase in pulmonary capillary permeability. 
Identification of the viral genes responsible for growth of strains of reovirus in cultured mouse heart cells. Viral growth in specific tissue is usually required in order to lead to pathology. Two reovirus isolates (type 1 Lang and type 3 Dearing) differ in their capacity to grow in cultured mouse heart cells. The mammalian reoviruses contain a genome of 10 double-stranded RNA gene segments. By the use of 37 reassortant viruses (consisting of viruses with different combinations of genes derived from the two parents), difference in capacity of different strains to grow in heart cells was mapped to three different genes, all of which encode viral core proteins: the M1 gene (P less than 0.000044); the L1 gene (P = 0.00094); and the L3 gene (P = 0.019). Using the same set of reassortant viruses, the L1 (P = 0.00015) and L3 (P = 0.0065) genes were involved in differences of the ability of viral strains to grow in mouse L cells (fibroblasts), but the M1 gene (P = 0.12) was not. These findings suggest that the M1 gene plays an important and specific role in determining the relative capacity of certain viral strains to grow in the heart. Thus, we have identified viral genes responsible for differing growth capacity in heart muscle cells in culture. These findings provide a novel system for studies of viral myocarditis at a molecular genetic level. 
Iliopectineal bursitis: an unusual cause of iliofemoral vein compression. The iliopectineal bursa is the largest bursa in the region of the hip joint. Enlargement of the bursa occurs in several conditions and may be manifested by groin pain, a pelvic or inguinal mass, or lower extremity edema due to compression of the external iliac or common femoral vein. A case of lower extremity edema secondary to external iliac/common femoral vein compression caused by an enlarged iliopectineal bursa is presented. The pathophysiology, methods of diagnosis, and forms of therapy are discussed. 
Insulin and cardiovascular disease. Paris Prospective Study. The Paris Prospective Study is a long-term investigation of coronary heart disease (CHD) risk factors in a large population of working men. The baseline cohort included 7028 men, 6093 who had a 75-g oral glucose tolerance test with measurement of plasma insulin and glucose levels (0 and 2 h) and 125 who were known non-insulin-treated diabetic patients. After a mean follow-up of 11 yr, 126 deaths ascribed to CHD were reported. Major independent predictors of CHD death were blood pressure, smoking, plasma cholesterol level, and fasting and 2-h postload plasma insulin level. Impairment of glucose tolerance, including overt diabetes, did not rank as an independent predictor when other baseline variables were accounted for. In the subset of the baseline cohort who presented with impaired glucose tolerance or diabetes (n = 943), 26 died from CHD during the follow-up. The strongest independent predictor of subsequent CHD death in this subsample with abnormal glucose tolerance was plasma triglyceride level. In view of the accumulating evidence that hyperinsulinemia and hypertriglyceridemia generally occur in the same type of subjects, in relation to insulin resistance and central obesity, the epidemiological findings of the Paris Prospective Study and of other investigations support the hypothesis that a constellation of mild metabolic abnormalities may play a deleterious role with regard to cardiovascular disease risk. 
Resectoscopic myomectomy. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate safety and efficacy of resectoscopic myomectomy for control of menorrhagia, dysmenorrhea, and/or reproductive wastage. DESIGN: Retrospective consecutive patient follow-up. SETTING: Private practice, outpatient, hospital. PATIENTS: All patients (92) having resectoscopic myomectomy between September 1, 1986 and December 31, 1989. INTERVENTIONS: Resectoscopic myomectomy with or without concomitant procedures such as endometrial ablation. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Assessment of dysmenorrhea, menorrhagia, and reproductive outcome after surgery. RESULTS: Elimination of dysmenorrhea in 24 of 28, absence of menorrhagia in 65 of 80, and pregnancy in 10 of 13 with two abortions in a total of 11 gestations. One patient was admitted and treated with one unit of autologous blood and mechanical tamponade with an intrauterine balloon. Three cases of uterine perforation had no sequelae. One patient had mild endometritis responding to outpatient antibiotics. Two cases of leiomyosarcoma were diagnosed histologically and accounted for two of the three hysterectomies noted during follow-up. CONCLUSIONS: Resectoscopic myomectomy is a safe, effective, and relatively simple outpatient surgical procedure. 
Abundant expression of EBER1 small nuclear RNA in nasopharyngeal carcinoma. A morphologically distinctive target for detection of Epstein-Barr virus in formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded carcinoma specimens. The highly restricted expression of the Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) genome in malignancy has limited the use of EBV detection methods applicable to formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded carcinoma specimens. In EBV-transformed lymphocytes very short nonprotein coding EBV transcripts (EBERs) are expressed in much higher abundance (10(7) copies per cell) than other EBV latency transcripts. Using a 3H riboprobe, the authors demonstrated EBER1 expression in NASOPHARYNGEAL CARCINOMAS (NPCs) as well as in parotid salivary gland. Recognition of EBER1 expression was facilitated by the intensity of hybridization and its characteristic morphology (nuclear with nucleolar sparing). EBER1 expression was not demonstrated in other epithelial malignancies arising from mucosal surfaces (oropharynx, uterine cervix) from which EBV shedding has been detected. Repeat study of the NPC specimens with digoxigenin-labeled probe yielded hybridization signal with subcellular morphologic detail and without background in a 12-hour procedure. Thus the EBER1 transcript is an appropriate target for in situ hybridization detection of EBV in formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded carcinoma specimens. 
Disorders of hypopigmentation in children. The most common disorders of hypopigmentation in children are pityriasis alba, vitiligo, nevus depigmentosus, and tinea versicolor. Pityriasis alba usually presents as ill defined, scaly patches of hypomelanosis on the cheeks of children with an atopic diathesis. The face is also a favored site for vitiligo, but the distribution is periorificial, and the pigment loss is complete because of a destruction of melanocytes. Vitiligo is an acquired, progressive disorder in contrast to nevus depigmentosus, which is a stable, congenital leukoderma. The localized form of nevus depigmentosus must be distinguished from an ash leaf spot, the earliest cutaneous manifestation of tuberous sclerosis, whereas the systematized form may be confused with hypomelanosis of Ito, another neurocutaneous disorder. The lesions of tinea versicolor favor the upper trunk of adolescents, and potassium hydroxide examination of the associated scale reveals hyphal and yeast forms of P. orbiculare. Any inflammatory process in the skin such as dermatitis or psoriasis can resolve with areas of hypopigmentation. 
Effect of hemostatic agents in canine gastric serosal blood vessels. The efficacy of various sclerotherapeutic agents in the control of acute bleeding, via subserosal injection, was assessed in 10 dogs. Blood flow rate (BFR) from severed gastric serosal vessels (diameter, 1.6 to 2.2 mm) was measured for 3 min (ml/min) for a control group and the agent used. The agents tested were 5 ml of normal saline (NS), 5 ml of 3% hypertonic saline (HS), 5 ml of 1:10,000 epinephrine in NS, 5 ml of 1:10,000 epinephrine/HS, 5 ml of 1:20,000 epinephrine/HS, 2 ml of old thrombin "cocktail" (thrombin, cephapirin + 1% tetradecyl), and 2 ml of fresh thrombin cocktail (total seven). One agent was tested per dog; there were one to two dogs in each subgroup. All of the agents showed significant reduction in BFR (except old thrombin) when compared with BFR of control vessels. The reduction ranged from 30% to more than 75% after 1:10 epinephrine/HS. Complete hemostasis was achieved in up to 47% of vessels using 1:20 epinephrine/HS. Overall, the epinephrine solutions achieved the best results. No systemic effects were observed with the use of any of the agents. Histological studies showed that epinephrine caused mild tissue damage, whereas the cocktail caused significant tissue necrosis. This serosal vessel model permits comparison of the effectiveness of each agent; however, clinical extrapolation to mucosal vessels in a patient and the long-term histological changes are not known. 
Myasthenia gravis in childhood and infancy. Usefulness of electrophysiologic studies. The diagnostic yield of electrodiagnostic tests was evaluated in 21 children with myasthenia gravis (MG). Twelve children had juvenile autoimmune MG, four had neonatal MG, four had congenital MG, and one had MG with arthrogryposis. Repetitive stimulation (RS) of the ulnar nerve was performed in every patient, sometimes with sensitization by ischemia. When the RS test was negative, the spinal or facial nerve was tested. In the group with neonatal MG, the RS test disclosed a significant decrement in 75% of the patients. Among the 17 other children, the overall percentage of positive RS tests was 88%. An ulnar nerve RS test was positive in 41% of them. Sensitization of ulnar nerve RS by ischemia improved the diagnostic yield to 66%. A spinal or facial nerve RS test was positive in seven of 10 patients. These results confirmed the diagnostic value of RS, with sensitization by ischemia, when necessary, in childhood MG whenever a careful technique is provided. 
A low dose bacillus Calmette-Guerin regimen in superficial bladder cancer therapy: is it effective? Bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG) intravesical therapy represents a major advance in the treatment of superficial transitional cell carcinoma of the bladder. To date, however, the optimal treatment schedule must be defined and the toxicity related to the treatment is significant. The preliminary results of a randomized ongoing study performed to evaluate the effectiveness and relative toxicity of a low dose (75 mg.) BCG regimen in the treatment of superficial bladder cancer therapy are reported. A total of 126 patients (70 for prophylaxis of recurrent stages Ta and T1 papillary tumors and 56 for treatment of carcinoma in situ or with microinfiltration of the subepithelial connective tissue) underwent a 6-week course of 75 mg. BCG (Pasteur vaccine). An additional course was given in patients who failed to respond to the induction course. Maintenance therapy was administered in complete responders monthly for 1 year and then quarterly for 1 year. The prophylaxis group (transurethral resection plus BCG) was randomized versus transurethral resection alone (63 patients, control group). A complete response in the prophylaxis, control and therapy groups was observed in 74, 17 and 57% of the patients, respectively, while 4, 17 and 12.5%, respectively, experienced tumor progression. The additional course of therapy increased the response rate. On the contrary, previous unsuccessful intravesical chemotherapy did not affect the response rate. In regard to toxicity, irritative disturbances (27%) and fever (17%) appeared to be significantly decreased compared with the rates reported in the literature. No major complications were experienced. In conclusion, a low dose (75 mg.) Pasteur strain BCG regimen was effective as prophylaxis against recurrent superficial papillary tumors and as treatment of carcinoma in situ or with microinfiltration of the subepithelial connective tissue. Toxicity related to the treatment appeared to be low. 
Issues, goals, and guidelines in selecting first-line drug therapy for hypertension. Modern antihypertensive therapy is enriched by an explosion in drug development that makes available increasingly specific agents whose effects have advanced our understanding of pressor mechanisms. This and other research into hypertensive mechanisms has defined the clinical, pharmacological, and endocrinologic heterogeneity of human hypertension. The sum of these developments is a greatly enhanced ability to identify curable and definable causes of hypertension and to pathophysiologically stratify the remaining cases of essential hypertension. Modern treatment can be much more specific than before. When long-term drug therapy is indicated, the regimen is more likely to achieve a primary goal for each patient, that is, the fewest possible drugs in the smallest amount and in lowest frequency. Two clinically quantifiable mechanisms for long-term arteriolar vasoconstriction can be identified within the spectrum of human hypertension. The first, renin-mediated vasoconstriction, is directly related to the plasma renin level. The second, sodium-volume-related vasoconstriction, is marked by a reciprocally subnormal renin level and involves abnormal sodium retention and calcium transport. A baseline renin-sodium profile can identify the pressure of one of these two forms of vasoconstriction and therefore is the key for the diagnosis of the two curable disorders that fully express one of the two pressor mechanisms--renovascular hypertension and primary aldosteronism. Renovascular hypertension, more common than once thought, is often cured by angioplasty. It is important to diagnose these curable forms before beginning long-term drug therapy. The renin-sodium profile, used in conjunction with serum potassium and creatinine measurements, is valuable not only in screening patients for curable forms, but also for stratifying the remainder according to the pathophysiological vasoconstrictor mechanism that underlies the hypertension. Converting enzyme inhibitors or beta-blockers are, by themselves, often effective in correcting the hypertension of high- or medium-renin patients, whereas calcium antagonists, diuretic agents, or alpha-blockers alone are most effective against the low-renin form of vasoconstriction. In the large midzone of renin values, if monotherapy fails, a rational basis for combined antirenin-antisodium volume therapies can be developed. 
Animal models of fulminant hepatic failure. The six requirements for a satisfactory animal model of fulminant hepatic failure are reversibility, reproducibility, death from liver failure, a therapeutic window, a large animal model, and minimal hazard to personnel. Different models may be required to evaluate the various types of liver failure seen in man. The available models include surgical anheptic and devascularization procedures, as well as hepatotoxic drug administration using agents such as carbon tetrachloride, acetaminophen, or galactosamine. Currently combined surgical and drug models appear to provide the best model but the search for the ideal models continues. 
Epipalatus: a rare intraoral teratoma. A wide range of discrete head and neck tumors are developmental, including those termed choristoma, hamartoma, dermoid cysts, teratoid tumors, and true teratomas. In classifying various teratomas, consideration is given to the embryonal layers represented within the substance of the tumor and to their level of organizational complexity. By definition, a hamartoma is a tissue mass, present at or near the time of birth, that is benign and native to the site of origin. Growth capacity of a hamartomatous process parallels that of the host organism. A choristoma, on the other hand, is a mass of tissue that is foreign to the site of discovery and is thought to result from growth to displaced primordial tissue that is histologically normal for that tissue. 
Magnetic resonance imaging for detecting and treatment monitoring of orthotopic murine bladder tumor implants. We assessed the feasibility of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) for detection and treatment monitoring of early stage orthotopic murine bladder (MBT-2) tumor implants. Thirty mice were scheduled for imaging at six, 14, 18 and 21 days after tumor implantation. Using a volume imaging coil, MRI demonstrated very early orthotopic tumors, the detection of which would otherwise have been impossible by clinical signs only. Sequential accurate assessment of tumor size was achieved by inflation of the bladders with a fixed volume of Gadolinium-DTPA contrast. The presence of established MBT-2 intravesical tumors was confirmed by gross pathology and light microscopy of the corresponding whole mount bladder sections. Histological examination of the corresponding tumor specimens revealed the presence of transitional cell bladder carcinoma which correlated very well with the topography and depth of tumor involvement as indicated on MRI. The The mice tolerated repeated MR imaging well. Early tumors at day 14 were detectable on MRI (with serial tumor growth to day 21), with no clinical signs of disease. In a subsequent study, response to intravesical tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha) immunotherapy was monitored with serial MRI. The serial MR images from six tumor-bearing mice (three controls and three TNF-alpha treated) have been selected to illustrate the consistent findings of this study. Sequential MRI scans of TNF-alpha treated mice revealed retardation of tumor growth that correlated well with the corresponding histologic examination. The orthotopic tumor and MRI model described is ideal for preclinical evaluation of new potential intravesical chemotherapy and immunotherapy agents. 
Studies on the cellular origin of neurothekeoma: clinical, light microscopic, immunohistochemical, and ultrastructural observations. The clinical, histopathologic, and immunohistochemical features of 11 cases of neurothekeoma are reported. One case was examined by electron microscopy. The mean age of the patients was 27.1 years; the study comprised eight female and three male patients. Most lesions were nondescript papules and located on the upper part of the body, seven cases of neurothekeoma on the head. Eight cases were classified as cellular neurothekeoma on the basis of a striking fascicular pattern and three cases as myxomatous neurothekeoma because of prominent myxoid stromal change. All cellular neurothekeomas failed to express S-100 protein, whereas the three myxomatous types were strongly positive for this marker. Other than vimentin, there was no significant immunoreactivity with other immunohistochemical markers. Ultrastructural study of one case of cellular neurothekeoma was inconclusive for cell type although a perineurial origin could not be excluded. On the basis of these results, we conclude that cellular neurothekeoma differs from myxomatous neurothekeoma not only by clinical and histologic findings but also by immunoreactivity with S-100 protein. These findings also suggest the existence of two distinct subtypes of neurothekeoma and possible origin of the two variants of neurothekeoma from different cell types or at least variation in phenotypic expression of a common cell type. On the other hand, it cannot be excluded that these two variants are different stages in the natural history of neurothekeoma. 
Differences in prostaglandin metabolism in cultured aortic and pulmonary arterial endothelial cells exposed to acute and chronic hypoxia. In vivo, a marked difference in blood oxygen tension exists between the pulmonary artery and the aorta. Responses of vascular endothelial cells from these vessels to changes in ambient oxygen might be influenced by the oxygen tension to which they are continuously exposed in vivo or by their anatomic site. To explore this hypothesis, we initially studied the production of the cyclooxygenase metabolites prostacyclin and thromboxane in bovine aortic and main pulmonary arterial endothelial cells grown in 21% O2 and exposed to different degrees of acute hypoxia over a wide range of times. We found that short-term hypoxia (3% or 0% O2) rapidly and transiently activates the cyclooxygenase pathway in both cell types, with a more rapid response in bovine aortic endothelial cells. To determine whether culture in an oxygen tension similar to that to which main pulmonary arterial endothelial cells are exposed in vivo alters this response, we evaluated these cyclooxygenase metabolites in bovine aortic and main pulmonary arterial endothelial cells cultured long-term in 3% O2, both at baseline and after exposure to acute anoxia (0% O2). In both cell types, we found a decrease in prostacyclin and thromboxane synthesis at baseline and evidence of an increase in the Vmax of thromboxane synthetase following stimulation with exogenous arachidonic acid. In chronically hypoxic cells exposed to acute anoxia, there were marked differences in enzyme activity compared with that in endothelial cells maintained in 21% O2 with differences depending on the origin of the endothelial cells. In bovine aortic endothelial cells, production of neither cyclooxygenase metabolite increased; in bovine main pulmonary arterial endothelial cells, only thromboxane production increased, suggesting isolated activation of the cyclooxygenase-thromboxane synthetase pathway. These studies demonstrate that acute and chronic hypoxia have profound effects on endothelial cell cyclooxygenase metabolism and that these effects depend on the duration and degree of the hypoxic exposure and the vascular bed from which the endothelial cells are derived. 
Lupron retards proliferation of ovarian epithelial tumor cells cultured in serum-free medium. Some patients with recurrent ovarian epithelial cancer respond favorably to treatment with GnRH agonists. This effect was proposed to be mediated by suppression of pituitary gonadotropin release. The present in vitro study investigated effects of human gonadotropin (Pergonal LH/FSH, 1:1) and Lupron, a GnRH agonist, on proliferation of an ovarian cancer cell line, 2774, which is estrogen receptor negative and grows well in serum-free, defined medium. Pergonal, 10 IU/mL or 30 IU/mL, did not enhance cell proliferation, which argues against stabilization of ovarian tumors in vivo due to decreased serum gonadotropin. Lupron, 1.4 micrograms/mL and 140 micrograms/mL, retarded cell division by day 6-8 of culture, in a dose-dependent manner. Flow cytometric cell cycle phase DNA analysis demonstrated Lupron caused a reversible 5-6% increase in the portion of cells in rest phase, G0/G1, compared to controls during log growth, and a corresponding decrease in the portion of cells in DNA synthesis, S phase. However, long-term culture, 3 weeks, with Lupron failed to arrest cells in G0/G1, and experimental cultures plateaued at cell number similar to control cultures. We conclude Lupron's effect on ovarian cancer cell proliferation is independent of gonadotropin and steroid, involves a cell cycle regulatory event, and duration of benefit observed in vivo for some patients may be related to total tumor volume at the time of treatment. 
Mechanism of analgesia induced by hypnosis and acupuncture: is there a difference? Hypnosis and acupuncture can alleviate experimentally induced pain but the mechanism of analgesia remains unclear for both techniques. Experimental pain was induced by cold pressor test (CPT) in 8 male volunteers. Analgesic effect of hypnosis (HA) and acupuncture (AA) was assessed before and after double-blind administration of placebo or naloxone, in a prospective, cross-over study. We found that pain intensity was significantly lower with HA as compared with AA, both with naloxone (P less than 0.001) and placebo (P less than 0.001). Within HA or AA groups, pain scores did not differ significantly when naloxone or placebo was administered. During AA, however, pain scores were similar to control values when naloxone was given (P = 0.05) but decreased significantly with placebo (P less than 0.002). Analog scales for pain intensity and pain relief showed a good correlation (r = 0.94). Plasma levels of beta-endorphins did not change significantly in any combination. Heart rate, peripheral arterial blood pressure and skin conductance were very insensitive indices to assess pain intensity or relief, as well as intensity of acupuncture stimulation or depth of hypnotic trance. We conclude: (1) HA and AA can significantly reduce pain from CPT, and HA is more effective than AA: (2) HA and AA are not primarily mediated by the opiate endorphin system; and (3) plasmatic levels of beta-endorphins are not significantly affected by either HA or AA nor by naloxone or placebo administration. 
Mechanisms of asphyxial brain damage, and possible pharmacologic interventions, in the fetus. An examination of the cellular and molecular mechanisms of neuronal cell damage may lead to the design of pharmacologic interventions during presumed or actual fetal asphyxia. Hypoxia-ischemia in its severest form results in insufficient adenosine 5'-triphosphate production. The most important effect of this is failure of adenosine 5'-triphosphate-dependent membrane functions, which maintain ionic homeostasis, that is, ionic pumping. There is K+ efflux and Na+ influx across the cell membrane, depolarization of the cell membrane, opening of the voltage-dependent calcium channels, and entrance of Ca++ into the cell. Cytosolic Ca++ is also increased by Ca++ efflux from the mitochondria and the sarcoplasmic reticulum. Ca++ is a toxin in high cytosolic concentrations; it activates phospholipases A and C, which cause membrane breakdown and release of free fatty acids, including arachidonic acid. The membrane is damaged, lysis occurs, and the neuron dies. High cytosolic Ca++ also causes release of excitatory amino acids (especially glutamate), which overwhelm the suppressant neurotransmitters, causing seizures, increased metabolism, and aggravation of the insufficient adenosine 5'-triphosphate availability. Thromboxane A2 is generated from arachidonic acid, increasing smooth muscle tone and thereby worsening the ischemia. Cyclooxygenase activity also results in formation of oxygen-free radicals that contribute to cell membrane damage, lysis, and death. Possibilities for pharmacologic interventions include (1) calcium channel blockers and antagonists, (2) excitatory neurotransmitter blockers, (3) oxygen-free radical scavengers (e.g., superoxide dismutase), (4) cyclooxygenase or prostaglandin synthesis inhibitors, and (5) seizure suppressants (e.g., phenobarbital). Some of these treatments have been shown experimentally to limit neuronal death in the adult and fetus, and after more investigative work they may be applicable to clinical practice. 
The expression of CD22 (Leu 14) and CD11c (LeuM5) in chronic lymphoproliferative disorders using two-color flow cytometric analysis. The monoclonal antibodies (MoAbs) CD22 and CD11c recognize B-lymphocyte- and monocyte-associated antigens, respectively. Reports indicate that when these two MoAbs co-express, they represent a unique marker for hairy cell leukemia (HCL) although neither is specific for that disease. The authors evaluated the expression and diagnostic utility of CD22 and CD11C in specimens from 26 normal subjects, 29 patients, with various nonlymphoproliferative disorders (NLPDs), and 75 patients with different types of chronic lymphoproliferative disorders (CLDs) using two-color flow cytometric analysis of peripheral blood lymphocytes. Lymphocytes co-expressed CD22 and CD11c in less than or equal to 3% of the normal subjects and in less than or equal to 6% of the patients with NLPDs. These markers were expressed in greater than 10% of the lymphocytes of 46% (32/69) of the patients with B-cell CLDs: B-cell chronic-lymphocytic leukemia, 9/41; B-cell non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, 8/14; HCL, 11/11; B-cell lymphoproliferative disorder (NOS), 1/2; and B-cell prolymphocytic leukemia, 1/1. None (0/6) of the lymphocytes of patients with T-cell CLDs expressed greater than 10% CD22-positive (CD22+) or CD11c-positive (CD11c+) cells. The HCL cases demonstrated a unique CD22+CD11c+ fluorescence histogram pattern, distinct from other lymphoproliferative disorders, that was characterized by uniformly intense CD11c and CD22 fluorescence. Differences in the expression of the CD22+CD11C- and CD22+CD11C+ phenotypes between diagnostic groups were found, most notable was a paucity of CD22+CD11c+ cells in lymphocytes of patients with HCL. CD22 also had more variable expression than CD19 and HLA-DR in the cases of B-cell CLD. This study demonstrates that the CD22+CD11c+ phenotype is not unique to HCL but is a consistent feature of that disorder and that the immunofluorescence pattern of co-expression in HCL is diagnostically useful. 
Benign recurrence of a pilocytic cerebellar astrocytoma 36 years after radical removal: case report. A benign recurrence of a cerebellar juvenile astrocytoma was found in a 52-year-old woman 36 years after the initial radical removal, which was performed when she was 16 years of age. To our knowledge, this is the third detailed case report of the late benign recurrence of cerebellar astrocytoma after total removal. The problem of recurrence of cerebellar astrocytoma is reviewed. 
Recurrent mild abruptio placentae occurring immediately after repeated electroconvulsive therapy in pregnancy. We present a case in which electroconvulsive therapy was performed repeatedly in pregnancy because of severe depression with psychotic features and failure of chemical treatment. Each electroconvulsive treatment was immediately followed by uterine contractions and active uterine bleeding, possibly representing recurrent abruptio placentae occurring in association with the treatment. Transient acute episodes of maternal hypertension between 180/90 and 190/100 mm Hg, documented within minutes after application of each electroconvulsive treatment, might explain the abruptio placentae manifested by active uterine bleeding and uterine hyperstimulation. 
Long-latency neurodegenerative disease in the western Pacific. The western Pacific parkinsonism-dementia and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis complex is a prototypical neurodegenerative disorder found among inhabitants of Guam, New Guinea (Irian Jaya, Indonesia) and Japan (Kii Peninsula, Honshu). Nonviral environmental factors peculiar to the affected populations seem to play a prominent etiologic role. Although cause-effect relationships cannot be established by epidemiologic studies alone, we have shown in all three affected population groups that individuals develop the amyotrophic lateral sclerosis variant of this disorder after heavy exposure to the raw or incompletely detoxified seed of neurotoxic cycad plants. Since long periods may elapse between cycad exposure and the appearance of neurological disease in humans, cycads may harbor a "slow toxin" that causes the postmitotic neuron to undergo slow irreversible degeneration. Two cycad neurotoxins are recognized, one of which (cycasin) is known to have long-latency effects (tumorigenesis) on mitotic neurons and replicating cells in other tissues. This paper explores the possible relationship between tumorigenesis and long-latency neurotoxicity, and discusses possible biologic markers of cycad exposure and subclinical neurodegenerative disease. 
Interleukin 4 suppresses the spontaneous growth of chronic myelomonocytic leukemia cells. We studied the effects of IL-4 on the spontaneous proliferation of chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMMoL) cells in vitro. IL-4 (100 U/ml) suppressed the spontaneous DNA synthesis by approximately 50% in 5 of 8 cases examined. IL-4 (100 U/ml) also inhibited the spontaneous colony formation by CMMoL cells in a methylcellulose culture by 50-97% in all of the 10 cases in which spontaneous colonies were formed. This IL-4-mediated suppression of the growth of CMMoL cells was completely abolished by the addition of anti-IL-4 neutralizing antibodies. The spontaneous CMMoL colonies were substantially suppressed by the addition of either anti-IL-6 or anti-granulocyte/macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) antibodies to the colony assay system: the addition of both anti-IL-6 and anti-GM-CSF antibodies resulted in greater than 80% inhibition of the colony formation by CMMoL cells. On the other hand, none of anti-IL-1-beta, anti-granulocyte-CSF, anti-macrophage-CSF, or anti-tumor necrosis factor-alpha antibodies affected the CMMoL colony formation. In the supernatants from 24-h cultures of CMMoL cells, high levels of IL-6 and GM-CSF were demonstrated in 9 of 9 and 2 of 9 cases examined, respectively. IL-4 (100 U/ml) almost completely inhibited the secretion of IL-6 and GM-CSF by CMMoL cells. These observations suggest that IL-4 suppresses the spontaneous proliferation of CMMoL cells by inhibiting their production of IL-6 and/or GM-CSF, both of which could act in vitro as an autocrine growth factor for CMMoL cells. 
A cell cycle-responsive transcriptional control element and a negative control element in the gene encoding DNA polymerase alpha in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Transcription of the POL1 gene of Saccharomyces cerevisiae, which encodes DNA polymerase alpha, the DNA polymerase required for the initiation of DNA replication, has previously been shown to be cell cycle regulated. To understand how the POL1 gene senses cell cycle position, we have investigated the cis-acting elements that respond to the factors that govern cell cycle progression. In this report we demonstrate that a region of 54 nucleotides containing the repeated element ACGCGT, which conforms to an Mlu I restriction endonuclease recognition site, contains all information necessary for transcriptional activation and cell cycle responsiveness. Although oligonucleotides lacking either one or both of the repeated Mlu I sites can function as an upstream activating sequence, the presence of at least one Mlu I site stimulates expression and, moreover, is absolutely essential for cell cycle regulation. A synthetic oligonucleotide corresponding to a 19-base-pair sequence in the POL1 promoter containing one Mlu I site can function as an autonomous cell cycle-responsive upstream element (upstream activation sequence) with temporal regulation indistinguishable from that previously described for the POL1 gene. Thus, the Mlu I site is an essential part of a cis-acting element responsible for the observed periodic activation. This sequence differs from previously defined cell cycle-responsive transcriptional control elements in the yeast HO endonuclease and histone genes. We also present evidence for a negative regulatory element in the 5' flanking region of the Mlu I upstream activation sequence. 
Resolution of chronic pelvic pain after laparoscopic lysis of adhesions. Thirty women undergoing laparoscopic lysis of adhesions for the treatment of chronic pelvic pain were prospectively evaluated for the presence of a chronic pain syndrome. At follow-up, of those with chronic pain syndrome (10), four (40%) reported continued improvement or resolution of pain during daily activities of dyspareunia, whereas of those without chronic pain syndrome (20), 15 (75%) were better (p = 0.06). When these two complaints are evaluated individually, both pain during daily activities (p less than 0.05) and dyspareunia (p less than 0.05) are more likely to improve after lysis of adhesions in women without chronic pain syndrome. Prognosis was not related to the number of previous operations, adhesion score, or other physical parameters. Laparoscopic lysis of adhesions is generally worthwhile in the treatment of chronic pelvic pain, although the presence of psychosocial compromise warrants preoperative evaluation and concomitant treatment. 
Colectomy, mucosal proctectomy, and ileal pouch-anal anastomosis. A prospective trial of optimal antibiotic management. The ideal prophylactic antibiotic regimen has not been established for patients undergoing colectomy, mucosal proctectomy, and endorectal ileoanal anastomosis, a prolonged operation frequently accompanied by abdominal and pelvic contamination and associated with an infection rate up to 20%. The aim of this study was to evaluate, in a prospective, randomized, double-blind fashion, the efficacy of a short perioperative course compared to an extended postoperative course of intravenous antibiotics (cefoxitin) in patients undergoing colectomy with ileoanal anastomosis. Forty patients with ulcerative colitis or familial polyposis coli received a mechanical and oral antibiotic bowel preparation and a standard three-dose perioperative course of intravenous cefoxitin. Patients then were randomized to receive intravenous cefoxitin, 1 g every 6 hours, or placebo for 5 days. No differences in overall postoperative morbidity were observed and neither group developed intra-abdominal, pelvic, or wound infections. It is concluded that a standard three-dose perioperative course of intravenous antibiotics provides adequate prophylaxis in the prevention of infectious complications in patients undergoing colectomy, mucosal proctectomy, and ileoanal anastomosis. 
Patient activity, sports participation, and impact loading on the durability of cemented total hip replacements. Patients with either cemented surface replacements or cemented stemmed hip prostheses and who regularly participate in sporting activities or heavy labor after total joint arthroplasty are at twice the long-term risk of requiring revision surgery for loosening as patients who are less active. For patients with surface replacement total hip arthroplasty (THA), the adverse effects of activity are greatest in patients with preoperative diagnoses other than osteoarthritis, and were seen by the sixth year postsurgery. For patients with conventional stemmed prostheses, the effects of patient activity are not seen until about ten years postsurgery. For resurfacing THA for osteoarthritis, the long-term of loosening is primarily in patients who participate in high impact activities. 
Presenting features and prognosis of chronic lymphocytic leukemia in younger adults. We have analyzed 117 younger patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) (mean age, 44.5 years; SD, 4.8; range, 19 to 49; male/female ratio, 2.08) with three main objectives: (1) to see whether these patients have distinctive presenting clinical features; (2) to investigate the impact of the disease on survival; and (3) to analyze whether already well-known prognostic factors are also useful when applied to these patients. As compared with an older age population (greater than or equal to 50 years), there were no major differences in presenting features except for an increased proportion of males (2.08 v 1.21; P less than .025) and a higher hemoglobin level (13.47 +/- 2.70 g/dL v 12.84 +/- 2.77 g/dL; P less than .05) in the younger group. Median survival is 12.3 years (expected median from a control group, 31.2 years). Clinical stages, bone marrow patterns, blood lymphocyte counts, and its doubling time are all useful to separate different risk groups of patients. Whereas patients with favorable prognostic factors have a survival probability of about 80% 14 years after diagnosis, those with poor prognostic features have a median survival of less than 3 years. It is concluded that CLL in younger adults has no major distinctive presenting features and that known prognostic factors are useful to separate different risk groups of patients. These results should be of help in planning therapy for younger persons with CLL. 
Long-term efficacy and safety of terazosin alone and in combination with other antihypertensive agents. This open, multicenter phase III study was designed to assess the efficacy and long-term safety of terazosin (1 to 40 mg/day), alone or in combination with other antihypertensive drugs, in 364 patients with mild to moderate essential hypertension. Compared with baseline values, long-term terazosin monotherapy or combination therapy resulted in consistent decreases in both systolic and diastolic blood pressures, with a mean reduction in supine diastolic pressure of 12 to 14 mm Hg. The numbers of patients with controlled blood pressure at the last evaluable visit of each therapy period were as follows: terazosin alone, 106 of 245 (43%); terazosin with added diuretic, 70 of 112 (63%); diuretic with added terazosin, 47 of 88 (53%); and terazosin plus diuretic with added beta-blocker, 22 of 32 (69%). Most adverse events were mild or moderate in severity. Only pain in extremities had a higher incidence during long-term treatment (6%, 181 to 360-day period) than during initial short-term treatment (5%, 1 to 90-day period). Three of six syncopal events occurred during the initial 180 days of treatment; this 0.8% (3/364) incidence was comparable with that reported previously for short-term studies. Only one case of syncope occurred during terazosin monotherapy. Terazosin was judged to be a safe and effective long-term medication for the treatment of hypertension. 
The "make/break test" as a diagnostic tool in functional weakness. Strength was measured in four major muscle groups with a hand-held dynamometer. The "make" and "break" technique was used with and without encouragement, and fatiguability was tested in patients with organic weakness and patients with functional weakness. Patients with functional weakness could be distinguished from the other two groups by an increase in strength greater than 20% with the break compared with the make technique. Additionally they tend to show larger increases in strength with encouragement and their "fatiguability" was less. 
Enhanced detection of the t(14;18) translocation in malignant lymphoma using pulsed-field gel electrophoresis. The t(14;18) chromosomal translocation that results in the juxtaposition of the bcl-2 proto-oncogene with the heavy chain JH locus is a common cytogenetic abnormality in human lymphoma. In particular, it is seen in about 85% of follicular lymphoma (FL) and up to one-third of diffuse lymphomas (DL). The chromosome 18 breakpoints have been shown to cluster into two regions. The major breakpoint region (mbr) within the 3' untranslated region of the bcl-2 proto-oncogene accounts for approximately 60% of the cases and the minor cluster region (mcr) 30 kb 3' of bcl-2 accounts for approximately 25% of the breakpoints. Because of variability in the position of the breakpoint, detection of the t(14;18) by Southern blot analysis provides an important clonal marker for the tumor. However, conventional electrophoresis (CE) fails to detect the translocation in 15% to 25% of cases. We have applied pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) to the detection of the t(14;18) in a series of lymphoma prospectively analyzed by CE, polymerase chain reaction (PCR), and cytogenetic analysis. PFGE readily detected t(14;18) rearrangements as indicated by comigration of bands detected with probes for the mbr region (chromosome 18) and the JH locus (chromosome 14). In a series of 40 patients with FL, this method proved to be the most comprehensive for detection of the translocation compared with standard methods; in fact, in one case only PFGE was able to detect the chromosomal rearrangement. Ten percent of the FL cases were negative by all methods tested. In a separate analysis of matched tissue specimens from cases of tumor progression of FL to diffuse lymphoma, PFGE detected a common t(14;18) rearrangement confirming a clonal origin in seven of seven cases, whereas CE detected a rearrangement in only three of seven cases. Overall, PFGE was able to detect a translocation in 8 of 12 cases that were negative by CE and four of eight negative by cytogenetic analysis. In conclusion, PFGE analysis is more comprehensive than CE, PCR, and cytogenetic analysis for the detection of the t(14;18) breakpoint in tissue biopsies of malignant lymphoma. 
Small bowel tumours: yield of enteroscopy. A total of 258 patients with obscure gastrointestinal bleeding were referred for small bowel enteroscopy, a procedure which allows endoscopic evaluation of most of the small intestine. A small bowel tumour was found in 5% of patients. In 50% of patients no diagnosis could be made, but when the cause of obscure bleeding was discovered small bowel tumours were the single most common lesion in patients younger than 50 years. Small bowel tumours causing gastrointestinal bleeding may remain undetected despite extensive diagnostic evaluation. We conclude that small bowel tumours are the most common cause of obscure gastrointestinal bleeding in patients less than 50 years of age. Small bowel enteroscopy is diagnostic of small bowel tumours even when all previous diagnostic studies, including enteroclysis and angiography, are negative. 
Effect of DN-1417 on photosensitivity and cortically kindled seizure in Senegalese baboons, Papio papio. The effect of DN-1417, a thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH) analogue, on photosensitivity and cortically kindled seizures was examined in seven Senegalese baboons (Papio papio). Intravenous (i.v.) administration of 2 mg/kg had no effect on either photosensitivity or cortically kindled seizures. When this agent was administered intracisternally, both the photomyoclonic response and cortically kindled seizures were suppressed for 4-5 days. A study of the transcallosal response also showed a long-lasting attenuation of the early positive wave (P1) amplitude (peak latency, 5-10 ms) elicited by a single stimulus after cisternal injection of DN-1417. These findings are consistent with the assumption that endogenous TRH is involved in suppression of epileptic seizures. 
Comparison of extradural and intravenous diamorphine as a supplement to extradural bupivacaine. The influence of route of administration (extradural as compared with intravenous) of diamorphine 0.5 mg/hour as a supplement to extradural bupivacaine (0.125% at 15 ml/hour) was investigated in two groups of 20 patients who underwent major abdominal gynaecological surgery. Significantly more patients in the intravenous group withdrew because of inadequate analgesia (p less than 0.05). Those in the extradural group were significantly more drowsy throughout the study (p less than 0.01), but no major side effects were encountered. 
Extracranial-intracranial bypass to reduce the risk of ischemic stroke. Extracranial-intracranial (EC-IC) bypass surgery is an operative procedure in which the superficial temporal artery is anastomosed to the middle cerebral artery. The operation, first described in 1969, was employed to circumvent otherwise surgically inaccessible atherosclerotic lesions high in the internal carotid system or in the middle cerebral artery. This assessment compares the findings from 13 surgical series of EC-IC bypass (1464 patients) with those reported in the only prospective, randomized, cooperative trial of this procedure (1377 patients). Analysis of the outcomes in the 1464 patients included in the surgical series produced insufficient evidence to support a conclusion that post-EC-IC bypass stroke rates were lower than the rates of either the medically or surgically treated groups in the controlled clinical trial. In the absence of reliable, objective evidence of the existence of a group of patients in whom surgical intervention is superior to medical treatment in reducing the frequency of stroke, the results of the single controlled clinical trial, which demonstrated no benefit of bypass, must be accepted as the best evidence currently available. 
Importance of experimental models for the development of clinical trials on thromboatherosclerosis. Experimental models of vascular injury have enhanced our understanding of the pathophysiological process leading to vascular obstruction in both spontaneous and accelerated atherosclerosis. Based on experimental findings, we present and discuss a pathological classification of vascular injury or damage and its role in the pathogenesis of various vascular diseases. In addition, these animal models have provided insights into the roles of platelets and lipid metabolism in the evolution and progression of atherosclerosis and have suggested potential therapeutic applications. Thus, based on studies in the pig models, antiplatelet agents have been shown for the first time to have a beneficial effect in preventing the formation and progression of coronary atherosclerotic lesions in humans. Similarly, our findings in high density lipoprotein plasma fractions regarding inhibition and even reversal of the process of atherosclerosis in a hypercholesterolemic rabbit model have added new insights to an explosive field of lipoprotein research and provided new avenues of therapeutic strategies. our in vivo and ex vivo pig models of an extracorporeal perfusion chamber mimicking the various coronary conditions have aided in the understanding of the pathophysiology of the acute coronary syndromes and intensified our search for the ideal antithrombotic regimen in these high-risk patients. Finally, a carotid pig model of balloon angioplasty, a dog model of saphenous vein grafting, and a pig model of heart transplantation not only have provided insights into the pathophysiological process of accelerated atherosclerosis but also are allowing development of new antithrombotic and antiproliferative approaches for the prevention of these accelerated vascular diseases. In summary, we are entering an exciting era in vascular research. Significant advances in our understanding of vascular injury or damage as well as the interactions of blood cells and lipids with the vascular wall have allowed us to formulate new experimental strategies with subsequent clinical application in the prevention and progression of these vascular diseases. 
Differentiation-inducing cytokine P48 exists in a membrane-associated form. P48 is a recently described 48-kDa differentiation-inducing cytokine isolated from the culture medium of the human leukemia line Reh. P48 induces differentiation and cytolytic activity in the promyelocytic cell line HL-60, and stimulates the release of TNF-alpha and IL-1 from peripheral blood monocytes. In further studies designed to examine the biosynthesis and function of P48, surface immunofluorescence flow cytometry analysis as well as 125I surface labeling and immunoprecipitation, revealed the presence of P48 on the surface of Reh cells. Triton X-114-treated Reh cells were partitioned into detergent and aqueous phases and separated by SDS-PAGE. Western blot analysis revealed that P48 partitioned exclusively into the detergent phase, suggesting an integral membrane association. Reh cells fixed with paraformaldehyde, but not K562 or P815, were able to stimulate the release of TNF-alpha from peripheral blood monocytes in a manner similar to that of secreted P48. Isolated plasma membranes from Reh cells could also stimulate TNF-alpha release. This TNF-alpha-releasing activity could be removed from detergent solubilized Reh membranes by immunoaffinity chromatography on an anti-P48 column. This study suggests that, in addition to being secreted into the culture medium, P48 is expressed on the surface of Reh cells in a biologically active form. The membrane form of P48 may be 1) a final maturation step before secretion or 2) a cell membrane-associated form that may be analogous to the membrane forms of TNF-alpha and IL-1. 
A meta-analysis of low-dose aspirin for the prevention of pregnancy-induced hypertensive disease. BACKGROUND.--Pregnancy-induced hypertension (PIH), defined as either isolated hypertension after the 20th week of gestation or hypertension with proteinuria (preeclampsia), occurs in 5% to 15% of pregnancies and is associated with maternal and neonatal morbidity. Previous clinical trials with small numbers of patients have suggested that aspirin in doses of 60 to 150 mg/d during the second and third trimesters reduces the risk of PIH and improves maternal and neonatal outcomes. OBJECTIVE.--We performed a meta-analysis of the six published controlled trials to estimate more precisely (1) the magnitude of protection of aspirin from PIH; (2) the effect of aspirin on severe low-birth-weight infants, cesarean section, and perinatal mortality; and (3) the risk of adverse effects. METHODS.--We critically and independently evaluated study methods, assigned a quality score to each trial, and abstracted quantitative outcomes data. For each outcome, both relative risk (RR) and the number needed to be treated were calculated. RESULTS.--Among 394 subjects from six trials, the RR of PIH among women who took aspirin was 0.35 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.22 to 0.55) and the number needed to be treated was 4.4, meaning that between four and five high-risk women would need to be treated with aspirin to prevent one case of PIH. Aspirin reduced the risk of severe low birth weight among newborns by 44% (RR = 0.56; 95% CI, 0.36 to 0.88) and reduced the risk of cesarean section by 66% overall (RR = 0.34; 95% CI, 0.25 to 0.48), although the specific indications for cesarean section were generally not described. There was no effect on fetal and neonatal death (RR = 0.88; 95% CI, 0.32 to 2.46), and there were no maternal or neonatal adverse effects associated with taking aspirin. CONCLUSION.--This meta-analysis suggests that low-dose aspirin reduces the risks of PIH and severe low birth weight, with no observed risk of maternal or neonatal adverse effects. 
Relief of right ventricular angina and increased exercise capacity with long-term oxygen therapy. Long-term low-flow oxygen therapy can lead to improved exercise capacity and improved hemodynamics in selected patients with pulmonary hypertension. We report a patient who presented with severe exercise limitation and anginal chest pain that appeared to result from pulmonary hypertension and predominantly right ventricular ischemia. Acute oxygen therapy led to relief of pain but no change in exercise capacity or of pulmonary hypertension. After eight months of oxygen therapy, the patient's pulmonary hypertension was unchanged, but right ventricular hypertrophy and marked increases in exercise cardiac output and exercise capacity developed. Thus, oxygen can relieve right ventricular angina and facilitate the development of compensatory hypertrophy. 
Localization of gene for familial hypertrophic cardiomyopathy to chromosome 14q1 in a diverse US population. BACKGROUND. Familial hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, an inherited primary cardiac abnormality characterized by ventricular hypertrophy, is the leading cause of sudden death in the young. Recent application of restriction fragment length polymorphism markers has provided provocative results, with localization to chromosome 18 (Japanese studies), 16 (Italian studies), 14 (US and French-Canadian studies), and two (National Institutes of Health studies) indicating genetic heterogeneity. Interpretation remains speculative until at least one of these loci is confirmed in unrelated pedigrees by independent investigators. METHODS AND RESULTS. We studied eight unrelated families of varied ethnic origins across the United States. DNA from each individual was digested with restriction enzymes TaqI or BamHI and analyzed by Southern blots followed by hybridization with probes T cell receptor alpha (TCRA), myosin heavy chain beta, D14S25, and D14S26. Multipoint linkage analysis showed a maximum lod score of 4.3, placing the locus 10 cM from D14S26 between D14S26 and TCRA, with an odds ratio of 20,000:1 and 90% confidence limits of 12 cM proximal to D14S25 to 4 cM distal to TCRA. The probability of linkage to 14q1 was more than 99%. CONCLUSIONS. These results indicate that the loci for familial hypertrophic cardiomyopathy in our families is primarily 14q1 but does not exclude other loci in a small proportion of the families. Thus, 14q1 appears to be the locus for familial hypertrophic cardiomyopathy in a significant proportion of the US population. 
Caffeine self-administration, withdrawal, and adverse effects among coffee drinkers. Twenty-two coffee drinkers (three to seven cups per day) underwent repeated double-blind trials to test for caffeine self-administration, withdrawal, and adverse effects. Each trial consisted first of a randomized crossover period of 1 day of decaffeinated coffee and 1 day of caffeinated coffee (100 mg) to assess withdrawal and adverse effects of caffeine. Next, subjects were given 2 days of concurrent access to the two coffees. The relative use of the two coffees was used to assess caffeine self-administration. Reliable caffeine self-administration occurred in three of 10 subjects in study 1 and seven of 12 subjects in study 2. Withdrawal symptoms were headaches, drowsiness, and fatigue. The major adverse effect from self-administration was tremulousness. The occurrence of headaches on substitution of decaffeinated coffee prospectively predicted subsequent self-administration of caffeine. These results indicate that some coffee drinkers exhibit signs of a caffeine dependence, ie, they self-administer coffee for the effects of caffeine, have withdrawal symptoms on cessation, and experience adverse effects. 
Four years of North American registry home parenteral nutrition outcome data and their implications for patient management. The OASIS Registry started annual collection of longitudinal data on patients on home parenteral nutrition (HPN) in 1984. This report describes outcome profiles on 1594 HPN patients in seven disease categories. Analysis showed clinical outcome was principally a reflection of the underlying diagnosis. Patients with Crohn's disease, ischemic bowel disease, motility disorders, radiation enteritis, and congenital bowel dysfunction all had a fairly long-term clinical outcome, whereas those with active cancer and acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) had a short-term outcome. The long-term group had a 3-year survival rate of 65 to 80%, they averaged 2.6 complications requiring hospitalization per year, and 49% experienced complete rehabilitation. The short-term group had a mean survival of 6 months; they averaged 4.6 complications per year and about 15% experienced complete rehabilitation. The registry data also indicated HPN was used for 19,700 patients in 1987 with therapy growth averaging about 8% per year. This growth was chiefly from new cancer patients. The number of new patients with long-term disorders in whom HPN was initiated appeared rather constant. We conclude that these clinical outcome assessments justify HPN for long-term patients, but the utility and appropriateness of HPN for the cancer and AIDS patients remains uncertain and requires further study. Medical, social, and fiscal aspects of HPN management in long-term and short-term patients appear to involve quite separate considerations. 
Post-endarterectomy headache and the role of the oculosympathetic system. A study was carried out on headache after carotid endarterectomy. A specific type of headache, similar in its characteristics to "cluster headache", occurred on the operative side in 30% of 54 patients, whereas no such headache occurred after extra-intracranial bypass or peripheral vascular surgery. This postoperative headache was not spontaneously reported by 56% of patients unless they were specifically asked about it. Pharmacological pupillary testing performed in 37 patients revealed that a decreased oculosympathetic activity (with or without adrenoceptor supersensitivity) was constantly associated with post-endarterectomy headache. Although this same abnormality was also observed in 54% of the patients without headache, a statistically significant (p less than 0.01) higher prevalence of decreased oculosympathetic responses was found in the patients with headache. The results suggest that damage to the sympathetic plexus due to the surgical procedure is involved in the development of postoperative "cluster-like" headache. 
Improvement of psoriatic arthritis in a patient treated with bromocriptine for hyperprolactinemia. We describe a woman with psoriatic arthritis who experienced a remarkable improvement of her skin and joint disease while only taking bromocriptine therapy. She was treated with bromocriptine for primary infertility due to hyperprolactinemia. The improvement in joint symptoms appeared to parallel that of the skin. More studies are required to determine the reproducibility of this observation. 
Recovery of costal and crural diaphragmatic contractility from partial paralysis. Since the two muscles (costal and crural) that constitute the diaphragm are separate and histologically different, their individual recovery pattern from neuromuscular blockade also may be different. Therefore, we studied the recovery of force and shortening in the in vivo diaphragm from atracurium-induced neuromuscular blockade in seven pentobarbital anesthetized dogs to assess segmental differences. Transdiaphragmatic pressure (Pdi), shortening of costal and crural segments, integrated electromyogram (EMG), and tidal volume (VT) were measured during spontaneous breathing. After atracurium had reduced VT to 30% of control, breathing parameters were followed until recovered to 90% of control values. In addition, force-frequency curves generated by supramaximal tetanic stimuli of the phrenic nerve were measured. Recovery times for tidal Pdi, tidal EMG, tidal shortening, low-frequency shortening, and twitch Pdi were twice as fast as for VT (40 +/- 4 min), reflecting a slower rate of recovery of accessory inspiratory muscles. High-frequency recovery was typically slower than that of VT. During tidal breathing and tetanic stimulation, costal and crural shortening recovered simultaneously. On the other hand, comparison between costal and crural by analysis of pressure-shortening relationships showed a segmental difference (crural shortened 30% more than costal at the same Pdi), which implied reduced afterload on the crural segment. However, since shortening and pressure were linearly related during paralysis and recovery, measurements of Pdi alone can accurately reflect changes in contractile mass when heterogeneity and afterload are controlled. 
Trends in the pathophysiology and pharmacotherapy of spasticity [editorial] Spasticity develops after supraspinal or spinal lesions of descending motor systems, with obligate involvement of the corticospinal tract. Spasticity is characterized by an increase in muscle tone, which, in contrast to many other types of enhanced muscle tone, shows a marked velocity-dependent increase when the muscle is passively stretched. The pathophysiological mechanisms underlying this spastic muscle tone remain obscure. Three major causes are currently considered possible: (1) changes in the excitability of spinal interneurones; (2) receptor hypersensitivity; (3) formation of new synapses by sprouting. The latter mechanism could account for the long time course over which spastic muscle tone develops in hemiplegic or paraplegic patients, but there is no experimental evidence for this hypothesis. The electromyographic (EMG) gait analysis of patients with spasticity has thrown doubt on the common belief that the velocity-dependent increase in spastic muscle tone is evoked by stretch reflex activity and has led to the idea that spastic muscle tone resides in the muscle fibres themselves. While such a mechanism may contribute to the slowness of active movements in spastic patients, recent experiments on patients with spastic arm paresis have confirmed the classical view that the spastic muscle tone is related to the EMG activity evoked in the passively stretched muscle. This pathological EMG activity is seen during the entire range of the dynamic phase of the stretch, during which a normal muscle exhibits only an early, phasic burst at the highest stretch velocities employed. For the pharmacological treatment of spasticity, substances with different central or peripheral actions are available. Their assumed receptor actions are described, together with their main indications and side-effects. 
Fatal brainstem stroke following internal jugular vein catheterization. Neurologic complications of central venous catheterization are uncommon, and there are no reports of cerebrovascular events. We report a case of massive postoperative vertebrobasilar territory stroke following internal jugular vein cannulation due to inadvertent vertebral artery injury. Autopsy revealed thrombosis at the site of puncture wound in the right vertebral artery, with emboli present in the distal basilar artery. 
Efficient diagnosis of common complaints: a comparative study in the United States and England. BACKGROUND. The purpose of this investigation was to compare the diagnostic efficiency of American and British family and general practitioners, as measured by their utilization of health care resources and the average length of the diagnostic interval, in diagnosing common complaints. METHODS. Several hundred charts from teaching practices in the United States and England were identified by computer search and reviewed. The charts were those of patients who had presented between 1978 and 1988 with a complaint of chest pain and were subsequently diagnosed as having angina pectoris or reflux esophagitis, or who presented with a complaint of shortness of breath and were subsequently diagnosed as having heart failure or asthma. RESULTS. The results of this study, which compared teaching family medicine practices in the United States and England, suggest that American family physicians diagnose common complaints such as chest pain and dyspnea in a shorter time with fewer visits and fewer consultations than their English counterparts, but order approximately the same number of diagnostic tests. CONCLUSIONS. This study demonstrates the difficulties in interpreting international (cross-cultural) comparisons. Differences may be due to varying health care systems, economic factors, physician training, and physician practice styles, as well as patient expectations. 
Complications associated with brachytherapy alone or with laser in lung cancer. Relatively little has been reported about destruction through brachytherapy of mucosa-perforating and extraluminary tumors with probable large vessel involvement causing major hemorrhagic or fistular complications. We report 12 patients subjected to laser and brachytherapy for centrally occluding lung cancer, whom we have periodically followed up from June 1986 until they died. Although all laser procedures were free from complications, necrotic cavitation in five cases, two of which were accompanied by large bronchoesophageal fistulas, and massive fatal hemoptysis occurred in six. Minor complications included radiation mucositis (two), noncritical mucosal scarring (two), and cough (four). Characteristics that will identify patients at risk of developing fatal hemoptysis and fistulas should be better defined by imaging and endoscopic techniques. In such cases, modifying the protocol or using alternative procedures should be considered. Minor complications, such as cough, can be avoided by using topical steroid therapy (eg, beclomethasone dipropionate). 
Genetic control of immunopathology induced by Mycobacterium leprae. The pathogenesis of leprosy is almost totally attributable to the immune response of the host towards Mycobacterium leprae, a virtually non-toxic intra-cellular parasite. At one end of the leprosy spectrum are tuberculoid leprosy patients, who develop immunity but also delayed-type hypersensitivity towards M. leprae; at the other end are lepromatous leprosy patients, who lack helper T cell activity and therefore do not develop immunity, but who can nevertheless produce antibodies that may cause immunopathology due to immune complexes. A range of immunopathology is seen between these poles. 
Genital human papillomavirus infection in men. Diagnosis and treatment with a laser and 5-fluorouracil. One hundred twenty-eight consecutive men, sexual partners (for more than six months) of women treated for genital condylomata acuminata, were evaluated with colposcopy to assess the percentage of infected men among the couples. Ninety-three (73%) of the men were found to have a genital human papillomavirus infection on colposcopically directed biopsies. All but one patient were treated with outpatient colposcopically guided laser vaporization under local anesthesia (one patient with extensive condylomata required general anesthesia). Two weeks after laser surgery, 5% 5-fluorouracil cream, used in the genital area, was initiated on a weekly basis for two months and every other week for two more months. Patients were followed in the clinic with colposcopy performed every eight weeks for six months to evaluate the regimen's results. Thirty-seven (40%) of the 93 men had "clinically" apparent genital HPV infection, and 56 (60%) of the 93 had "subclinical" disease (as determined with colposcopy). The majority of the patients (87 of 93, or 94%) responded to one laser treatment followed by 5-fluorouracil cream and had no visible lesions at six months. Colposcopic evaluation of the male partners of infected women and laser surgery followed by topical 5-fluorouracil therapy appear to be safe and effective in controlling genital HPV infection. 
Sensorineural hearing loss and the Marinesco-Sjogren syndrome. Sensorineural hearing loss has not been previously reported in patients with the Marinesco-Sjogren Syndrome. Two siblings are described where hearing was initially normal but subsequently deteriorated. 
Coughing and central venous catheter dislodgement. Silastic central venous catheters are subject to dislodgement from a variety of causes. Only one occurrence of catheter dislodgement has been previously reported in connection with coughing. We report four additional cases of silastic central venous catheter dislodgement associated with forceful coughing paroxysms, alone or in combination with emesis or rectal tenesmus. Three episodes of catheter dislodgement occurred in adolescents or young adults with cystic fibrosis, who may constitute a particularly high-risk group. Dislodgement in two patients was asymptomatic. These case suggest that patients with frequent or severe paroxysms of increased intrathoracic pressure may be at higher risk of catheter dislodgement. Since dislodgement may be initially asymptomatic and can cause serious complications, a high index of suspicion for dislodgement in patients with silastic central venous catheters and coughing paroxysms is advised. 
Influence of human immunodeficiency virus infection on cell-mediated immunity in chronic D hepatitis. To determine whether the abnormalities of cell-mediated immunity described in chronic D hepatitis are associated with hepatitis D virus (HDV) infection or concomitant human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection, serologic and tissue hepatitis B virus (HBV) and HDV markers and T lymphocyte subsets were studied in serum samples from 38 patients with chronic D hepatitis, 26 of whom had HIV infection. Patients with chronic D hepatitis and HIV infection had significantly lower peripheral blood T4:T8 ratios resulting from a significant increase in T8+ (suppressor/cytotoxic) cells, while numbers of T lymphocyte subsets were normal in cases with chronic D hepatitis only. HIV+ patients showed an increase in HBV replication (identified by hepatitis B core antigen in liver and hepatitis B e antigen and HBV DNA in serum) and in HDV replication (tissue D antigen and HDV RNA) without evidence of more active liver disease. Probably the immunologic disturbances detected in chronic D hepatitis are secondary to HIV infection, do not contribute to the pathogenesis of liver injury, and are associated with increased viral B and D replication. 
DuP 753 increases survival in spontaneously hypertensive stroke-prone rats fed a high sodium diet. We studied the effects of the nonpeptide angiotensin II receptor antagonist, DuP 753, on blood pressure, body weight, plasma renin activity, sodium excretion, and mortality in male stroke-prone spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHRsp) fed a 4% NaCl diet for 12 weeks. The rise in blood pressure, due to high sodium intake, was blunted in the first 8 weeks of the study in the DuP 753-treated group; however, it started slowly to rise in the following weeks. In the untreated group, blood pressure rose steadily and it was significantly higher than that of the treated group during the whole experimental period. DuP 753-treated rats gained weight continuously during the study in contrast to the untreated group, where weight gain was arrested after 4 weeks. Plasma renin activity rose significantly after 4 weeks of treatment with DuP 753; by week 6 its values returned to baseline values and remained at these lower values until week 12. In the untreated group, plasma renin activity was not suppressed by high sodium intake after 4 weeks; it continued to rise and it was significantly elevated by 8 and 12 weeks. Survival at 12 weeks was 84% in DuP 753-treated group and 26% in the untreated group. The data demonstrate that DuP 753 decreased mortality and dramatically blunted the blood pressure rise in SHRsp fed a high sodium diet. 
Endometriosis of the terminal ileum simulating the clinical, roentgenographic, and surgical findings in Crohn's disease. A 38-yr-old nulliparous female presented with endometriosis of the terminal ileum which mimicked the clinical, roentgenographic, and surgical findings of Crohn's disease. The patient presented with diarrhea, right lower quadrant pain, fever, and significant weight loss. At surgery, the terminal ileum was inflamed, indurated, thickened, and angulated. Ileal endometriosis may be expected to simulate Crohn's disease, because intestinal endometriosis frequently produces local bowel inflammation, adhesions, stricture, and angulation. Ileal endometriosis should be carefully considered in the differential diagnosis of Crohn's disease in menstruating females who are nulliparous and have dysmenorrhea, dyspareunia, dyschezia, menometrorrhagia, or other perimenstrual symptoms. It is important not to mistake endometriosis for Crohn's disease because endometriosis has a different therapy. 
Clinical and flow cytometry characteristics of malignant pleural effusions in patients after intracavitary administration of methylprednisolone acetate. Ten patients with recurrent pleural effusions due to advanced cancer were treated by intracavitary methylprednisolone acetate (Depo-Medrol [DM], Upjohn, Kalamazoo, MI). They received one to six courses of DM (median, three courses per patient) with doses ranging from 80 to 160 mg per course. Effusion cells were cryopreserved before and during DM installation for subsequent determination of ploidy by flow cytometry. Pleural effusion in all three patients with advanced breast cancer resolved and did not reaccumulate throughout follow-up for 11+, 10+, and 8+ months. Pleural effusion in a patient with metastatic gastric cancer and in two of four patients with adenocarcinoma of unknown origin partially resolved. Altogether six of ten patients (60%) subjectively and objectively benefited from this therapy. All patients tolerated the treatment well with no local or systemic side effects. Flow cytometry showed a reduction in ploidy of effusion cells in all three patients with breast cancer, from a peak mean channel of 6C to nearly 2C after therapy. Transient reduction of ploidy was seen also in the effusion of a patient with unknown primary tumor associated with clinical improvement. The clinical and laboratory data reported offers initial evidence that DM when instilled into the pleural cavity after incomplete thoracentesis may act as effective palliative therapy either alone or in combination with other anticancer agents. 
Total hip arthroplasty following failed internal fixation of hip fractures. A retrospective review was performed on 27 consecutive patients with total hip arthroplasty (THA) following failure of internal fixation of fractures of the proximal femur. The results were comparable to primary THA in femoral neck fractures. Considerably less satisfactory results were obtained in THA in intertrochanteric fractures. Bone loss and medial displacement of the femoral shaft led to high incidence of intraoperative complications and postoperative dislocations. Extreme care must be taken to avoid fracture and penetration of the femoral shaft. Autograft, allograft, or head and neck replacement components should be available for reconstruction of the difficult cases. 
A randomized trial of amsacrine and rubidazone in 39 patients with acute promyelocytic leukemia. Thirty-nine patients with untreated acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) were randomly allocated to receive rubidazone (zorubicin) 200 mg/m2/d, days 1 to 4 plus cytarabine (Ara C) 200 mg/m2/d, days 1 to 7 (arm A, 21 patients), or amsacrine (Amsa) 150 mg/m2/d, days 1 to 4 plus Ara C 200 mg/m2/d, days 1 to 7 (arm B, 18 patients). Prophylaxis of disseminated intravascular coagulation was made by platelet transfusions and heparin. In case of leukemic resistance, patients received a second course with 2 days of rubidazone (arm A) or Amsa (arm B) and 3 days of Ara C. Patients who achieved complete remission (CR) received three consolidation courses with the two drugs used for induction and maintenance therapy for 3 years. Two patients in arm A and one in arm B were allografted in first CR. Initial characteristics were similar in both arms. In arm A, 18 patients (86%) reached CR, two had hypoplastic death, and one had leukemic resistance after two courses. In arm B, 12 patients (66%) achieved CR, two had early death (CNS bleeding, one case; ventricular fibrillation, one case), and four had resistant leukemia after two courses. The difference in CR rate between the two arms was not significant. In arm A, disease-free survival (DFS) showed a plateau at 54.3% after 34 months (95% confidence interval [CI], 32.1% to 74.9%), with eight CRs longer than 34 months. In arm B, DFS was significantly shorter (P less than .03), showing a plateau at 16.7% after 38 months (95% confidence interval, 4.7% to 44.6%), and only two prolonged CRs were seen. The difference in DFS remained significant after censoring allografted patients and patients who died in CR (one in arm A, two in arm B). Our results suggest that Amsa-Ara C combinations may be inferior to anthracycline-Ara C combinations in the treatment of APL, because they seem to provide shorter DFS and, possibly, a higher incidence of initial leukemic resistance. However, studies with larger numbers of patients are required. 
Clinical findings associated with pulmonary embolism in a rehabilitation setting. In a rehabilitation setting, pulmonary embolism is a relatively frequent and life-threatening complication. Deciding when a patient may be experiencing this condition is difficult, however, because of frequent deficits in patient communication skills (eg, aphasia and cognitive deficits) and the multisystem illnesses affecting many rehabilitation patients. We reviewed the charts of 30 rehabilitation patients transferred emergently during the years 1986 to 1988 with a diagnosis of pulmonary embolism, which was subsequently documented by ventilation-perfusion scanning. The average age of the 30 patients was 65; 63% were women and 20 (67%) had an admitting diagnosis of stroke. The most common new-onset clinical findings in the 24 hours before discharge were unusual facial skin color changes (pale, flushed, or cyanotic) (57%), chest or upper back pain (47%), tachycardia (heart rate more than 100 bpm) (40%), hypoxemia (arterial oxygen saturation less than or equal to 90%) (40%), and fever less than 101F (37%). In 63% of the patients, either anxiety, restlessness, diaphoresis, or dyspnea was also noted in the 24 hours before discharge. The data suggest that careful physician and nursing scrutiny may identify clinical signs characteristic of pulmonary embolism, and that the de novo appearance of these constellations of findings may help to select candidates for ventilation-perfusion scanning. 
Long-term survival in patients operated on for benign peptic ulcer disease. Survival rate was analysed in a cohort of 6459 patients who had undergone partial gastrectomy for benign ulcer disease and who had survived the first year after operation. The cohort was followed for 27-35 years. There was a slight but significant decrease in relative survival rate to 92 per cent (95 per cent confidence interval 87-97 per cent) 35 years after operation. No decrease in relative survival rate was observed during the first 20 years after operation. There was no difference by gender or surgical procedure, but patients operated on for gastric ulcer, compared with duodenal ulcer, and patients operated on at younger ages had a poorer relative survival rate. The effects of partial gastrectomy on survival, both overall and by diagnosis or age at operation, are probably attributable to confounding factors linked with the peptic ulcer disease rather than to the surgical procedure itself. We conclude that partial gastrectomy seems to have very little impact on survival once the patient has survived the first year after operation. 
Mineral spirits inhalation associated with hemolysis, pulmonary edema, and ventricular fibrillation. A previously healthy 42-year-old woman developed severe dyspnea, chest discomfort, and malaise several hours after prolonged exposure to concentrated vapors from mineral spirits. On the way to the hospital, she sustained a cardiopulmonary arrest; on arrival several minutes later, she was found to be in ventricular fibrillation and was resuscitated. Her hospital course included slowly resolving cardiac abnormalities, amnesia, noncardiogenic pulmonary edema, abrupt hemolytic anemia, sustained rhabdomyolysis, and other metabolic abnormalities. It is highly probable that this syndrome represented acute and near-lethal toxicity caused by the inhalational exposure to the petroleum distillate known as mineral spirits. It is important that physicians be aware of this syndrome in order to recognize it on presentation and to warn patients of the risk of such toxic exposure. 
Pituitary adenoma: correlation of half-dose gadolinium-enhanced MR imaging with surgical findings in 26 patients. Sellar magnetic resonance imaging studies obtained with half doses of gadopentetate dimeglumine (0.05 mmol/kg) were prospectively interpreted and retrospectively rated in 26 patients who subsequently underwent transsphenoidal sellar surgery for suspected pituitary adenoma. Studies included a sagittal scout view followed by a non-contrast-material-enhanced, an immediate postcontrast, and a delayed postcontrast T1-weighted image (obtained at 1.0 or 1.5 T). Ten of 11 confirmed microadenomas were identified prospectively; all were identifiable in retrospect. Macroadenomas (12 cases) were well demonstrated. The high signal intensity of the posterior pituitary and of intrasellar hemorrhage was obscured on postcontrast studies. Delayed images proved unnecessary. This prospective evaluation suggests that a half-dose study is comparable to retrospective studies in which full-dose techniques were used for detection of micro- and macroadenomas. Imaging times are reasonably short, and cost of contrast material is potentially reduced. Confirmation with larger studies is required, and careful endocrinologic and clinical follow-up of nonsurgical patients is necessary. 
Metastatic basal cell carcinoma: report of a case presenting with respiratory failure. Metastasis from basal cell carcinoma (BCC) of skin is rare. A case of a 58-year-old male presenting with increasing shortness of breath and right pleural effusion is described. Open right pleural biopsy demonstrated metastatic carcinoma consistent with BCC. Review of medical records from another hospital revealed that four years previously a recurrent BCC had been excised from the left back. One and three years prior to this excision, a skin lesion at this same site had been treated with electrocautery. Review of the skin excision slides demonstrated infiltrating BCC histologically very similar to the metastatic pleural neoplasm. The patient died two months after the pleural biopsy. At autopsy, the cutaneous BCC had not recurred and metastatic BCC extensively infiltrated the pleura bilaterally, with focal involvement of underlying lung parenchyma, subcarinal lymph nodes, diaphragm, and pericardium. 
Effect of temporary occlusion of hypogastric arteries on blood loss during radical retropubic prostatectomy. We report on a prospective, partially randomized study of 130 patients, examining the effect of temporary occlusion of the hypogastric arteries on intraoperative blood loss, perioperative blood replacement and change in preoperative to postoperative hematocrit. We observed no significant difference in any of these parameters when comparing patients who did and did not undergo intraoperative occlusion of the hypogastric arteries. These findings suggest that temporary occlusion of the hypogastric arteries during radical prostatectomy does not have a major effect on the blood loss associated with this operation. Extensive collateral circulation to the prostate and a substantial venous component of blood loss may explain these findings. Banking of 3 units of autologous blood preoperatively would have decreased the need for homologous transfusions in the majority of patients. 
A new manifestation and treatment alternative for heparin-induced thrombosis. We treated a coronary artery bypass patient whose postoperative course was complicated by heparin-induced thrombocytopenia and resultant pulmonary artery and saphenous vein graft thromboses. The pulmonary thromboemboli were found first, and pulmonary blood flow was restored with intravenously administered tissue plasminogen activator (tPA). A short time later, the vein grafts were found to be occluded, and we subsequently performed multivessel percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA) using tPA as an adjuvant to oral warfarin sodium therapy with excellent results. We conclude that heparin-induced thromboses in the pulmonary arteries are amenable to thrombolytic therapy, including tPA, whereas this regimen appears to have little effect on saphenous vein grafts. We also found that a combination of warfarin and thrombolytic therapy is an alternative regimen for heparin-intolerant patients who require PTCA. 
Seminal polyamines as agents of cervical carcinoma: production of aneuploidy in squamous epithelium. The effects of several polyamines found in seminal fluid on the cell cycle and ploidy of three cervical cell lines and of primary epithelial cells cultured from cervical biopsy specimens were monitored by fluorescent flow cytometry. The rate of cell growth did not change but there were indications of either hypodiploidy or hyperdiploidy in some cultures at certain concentrations of spermine and spermidine. An interaction of exogenous polyamines with the DNA of cervical cells was shown to occur, leading to changes in ploidy with, perhaps, the potential to induce or promote dysplasia. 
The value of class IC antiarrhythmic drugs for acute conversion of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation or flutter to sinus rhythm. In a single-blind randomized study, the efficacy and safety of intravenous propafenone (2 mg/kg body weight per 10 min) versus flecainide (2 mg/kg per 10 min) were assessed in 50 patients with atrial fibrillation or flutter. Treatment was considered successful if sinus rhythm occurred within 1 h. Conversion to sinus was achieved in 11 (55%) of 20 patients with atrial fibrillation treated with propafenone and in 18 (90%) of 20 with atrial fibrillation treated with flecainide (p less than 0.02). If atrial fibrillation was present less than or equal to 24 h, conversion to sinus rhythm was achieved in 8 (57%) of 14 patients in the propafenone group and 13 (93%) of 14 in the flecainide group (p less than 0.05). Atrial flutter was converted in two (40%) of five patients treated with propafenone and in one (20%) of five with flecainide (p = NS). Mean time to conversion was 16 +/- 10 min in the propafenone group versus 18 +/- 13 min in the flecainide group (p = NS). QRS lengthening (83 +/- 15 to 99 +/- 20 ms) was observed only in the patients treated with flecainide (p less than 0.001). Patients successfully treated with propafenone showed significantly higher plasma levels than those whose arrhythmia did not convert to sinus rhythm. Transient adverse effects were more frequent in the flecainide group (40%) than in the propafenone group (8%) (p less than 0.01). In conclusion, at a dose of 2 mg/kg in 10 min, flecainide is more effective than propafenone for conversion of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation to sinus rhythm. However, considering the propafenone plasma levels and very few adverse effects, the dose or infusion rate, or both, used in the propafenone group may not have been sufficient to achieve an optimal effect. Neither drug seems very effective in patients with atrial flutter. 
Longitudinal study of cerebral spinal fluid drainage in polyethylene glycol-conjugated superoxide dismutase in paraplegia associated with thoracic aortic cross-clamping. It has been hoped that pharmacologic prophylaxis in thoracic aortic cross-clamping may avert the unpredictable complication of spinal cord paraplegia, may avoid the mechanical difficulties associated with shunts, partial bypass, or monitoring devices, and may serve as a substitute for or as an adjunct to cerebral spinal fluid drainage. Toward this end 21 mongrel dogs were studied in four groups and underwent 60 minutes of thoracic aortic cross-clamping: group I, five with thoracic aortic cross-clamping; group II, five with thoracic aortic cross-clamping and cerebral spinal fluid drainage; group III, five with thoracic aortic cross-clamping, cerebrospinal fluid drainage and intravenous administration of a single dose (5000 units/kg) of polyethylene glycol-conjugated superoxide dismutase (PEG-SOD) given 15 to 20 minutes before thoracic aortic cross-clamping; and group IV, six with thoracic aortic cross-clamping and PEG-SOD. Paraplegia was graded by the Tarlov method at 24 hours and up to 5 days after thoracic aortic cross-clamping. The carotid and femoral artery pressures, the central venous pressure, and core temperature, taken during the experiment and at the time the dogs were killed, were found to be similar between groups. At 24 hours all dogs in group I were paraplegic; groups II and III had no paraplegic dogs (p less than 0.01), and group IV had fewer paraplegic dogs (two of six) than group I (p less than 0.05). Paraplegia was averted in all dogs treated with cerebral spinal fluid drainage, even 5 days after thoracic aortic cross-clamping. 
QTc prolongation measured by standard 12-lead electrocardiography is an independent risk factor for sudden death due to cardiac arrest. BACKGROUND. QTc prolongation has been implicated as a risk factor for sudden death; however, a controversy exists over its significance. METHODS AND RESULTS. In the Rotterdam QT Project, 6,693 consecutive patients who underwent 24-hour ambulatory electrocardiography were followed up for 2 years; of these, 245 patients died suddenly. A standard 12-lead electrocardiogram and clinical data at the time of 24-hour ambulatory electrocardiography were collected for all patients who died suddenly and for a random sample of 467 patients from the study cohort. In all patients without an intraventricular conduction defect (176 patients who died suddenly and 390 patients from the sample), QT interval duration was measured in leads I, II, and III and corrected for heart rate with Bazett's formula (QTc). In patients without evidence of cardiac dysfunction (history of symptoms of pump failure or an ejection fraction less than 40%), QTc of more than 440 msec was associated with a 2.3 times higher risk for sudden death compared with a QTc of 440 msec or less (95% confidence interval: 1.4, 3.9). In contrast, in patients with evidence of cardiac dysfunction, the relative risk of QTc prolongation was 1.0 (0.5, 1.9). Adjustment for age, gender, history of myocardial infarction, heart rate, and the use of drugs did not alter these relative risks. CONCLUSIONS. These data indicate that in patients without intraventricular conduction defects and cardiac dysfunction, QTc prolongation measured from the standard electrocardiogram is a risk factor for sudden death independent of age, history of myocardial infarction, heart rate, and drug use. In patients with cardiac dysfunction, QTc duration is not related to the risk for sudden death. 
Gadopentetate dimeglumine-enhanced chemical-shift MR imaging of the breast. Standard T1-weighted MR images enhanced with gadopentetate dimeglumine show relatively minimal enhancement of breast lesions due to the high background signal from fat in the breast. Strongly enhancing lesions may become isointense relative to the fat signal and become invisible or indistinct after contrast administration. Fat-suppressed chemical-shift imaging (CSI) combined with administration of gadopentetate dimeglumine improves lesion detection and characterization in other areas of the body where a strong lipid signal is present. We evaluated this technique in the breast. Twenty patients with mammographic lesions were studied with standard unenhanced T1- and T2-weighted images and enhanced T1-weighted images, as well as with CSI before and after administration of gadopentetate dimeglumine. The series were ranked independently for border and matrix characteristics. The border was assessed for a smooth, irregular, or spiculated margin. The matrix or internal substance was evaluated for visibility and type of enhancement, homogeneous or inhomogeneous. The enhanced CSI images were superior to all other images in the depiction of border and matrix characteristics. Of 20 patients, a corresponding mass was detected on MR in 14. In two of the 14 patients, the lesion was seen only in the enhanced CSI images. Chemical-shift artifacts on enhanced T1-weighted images obscured border detail in several cases. Enhanced CSI improves visualization of breast lesions as compared with conventional MR imaging with or without enhancement. The enhanced CSI technique produces differential enhancement between glandular tissue and lesions while suppressing the signal from fat. This improves the visualization of border and matrix characteristics and depicts lesions that otherwise might be obscured. 
Safety-belt injuries in children with lap-belt ecchymosis: CT findings in 61 patients. We have noted a complex of common injuries in children wearing lap-styled safety belts during vehicular accidents. Sixty-one children who were restrained passengers in motor vehicle crashes had linear ecchymosis across the abdomen and had CT for abdominal trauma. Thirteen children (21%) had a lumbar spine injury, and 14 children (23%) injured a hollow viscus (bowel, 12; bladder, two); five children (8%) had both spine and hollow viscus injuries. Abnormal findings on abdominal CT were recognized retrospectively in three of 13 children with lumbar spinal injury. Lateral radiographs of the spine showed lumbar spinal injury in all cases. Free intraperitoneal air was noted in on three (25%) of 12 children with bowel injury. In eight of those children, CT showed large, unexplained collections of peritoneal fluid. The presence of lap-belt ecchymosis should prompt a careful search for spine, bowel, and bladder injury. Recognition of the limitations of CT diagnosis of these injuries is important to reduce errors in interpretation. 
Achromobacter xylosoxidans. An unusual neonatal pathogen. Perinatal acquisition of a rare pediatric pathogen, Achromobacter xylosoxidans, with evidence for in utero transmission, is described. Cultures from the mother and neonate demonstrated A. xylosoxidans. An ascending bacterial infection in the mother with clinical chorioamnionitis is presented as the probable mode of transmission. Postmortem examination of the infant confirmed Achromobacter meningitis. In contrast to the current case with transmission from mother to neonate, previously published neonatal cases of Achromobacter infections indicate that nosocomial transmission of the organism is most common (79%). In addition, the literature review revealed a high mortality associated with meningitis (77%), frequent hydrocephalus, and subsequent neurologic sequelae (36%). To the authors' knowledge, this is the first documented case of maternal-fetal transfer of A. xylosoxidans. 
Complexes of activated protein C with alpha 1-antitrypsin in normal pregnancy and in severe preeclampsia. Protein C is a vitamin K-dependent regulator of blood coagulation. Activated protein C is regulated in plasma in large part by two inhibitors, protein C inhibitor and alpha 1-antitrypsin. Complexes of activated protein C with both inhibitors in plasma samples from subjects with normal or pathologic pregnancy were measured. In normal pregnancy we observed a progressive and significant increase in activated protein C/alpha 1-antitrypsin complex levels, from 9 +/- 3 ng/ml in the first trimester to 16 +/- 3 ng/ml in the third trimester, as well as an increase in alpha 1-antitrypsin plasma levels. In severe preeclampsia, but not in chronic hypertension with superimposed severe preeclampsia, there was a greater increase in activated protein C/alpha 1-antitrypsin levels (25 +/- 10 ng/ml) (p less than 0.001) and a decrease in protein C and protein C inhibitor levels as compared with normal pregnant women at similar gestational ages. These data show an increase in the activation of the protein C pathway in both normal and pathologic pregnancy and provide evidence for an enhancement of thrombin generation in severe preeclampsia compared with chronic hypertension with superimposed severe preeclampsia. 
Broncholithiasis: CT features in 15 patients. Broncholithiasis is a disorder characterized by peribronchial calcific nodal disease that either erodes into an adjacent bronchus or distorts the bronchi. The key radiologic finding is a calcified endobronchial or peribronchial lymph node. To determine the CT findings of broncholithiasis, we retrospectively reviewed the chest radiographs and CT scans of 15 patients with proved broncholithiasis. Ten patients had endobronchial nodes as proved by bronchoscopy, surgery, or lithoptysis. Broncholiths were identified on bronchoscopy in only five cases. Five patients had peribronchial nodes with associated bronchial distortion. Collimation of the CT scans varied; 1.0-cm-, 0.6-cm-, and 0.5-cm-thick sections were obtained. Three patients had both 1.0-cm- and 0.5-cm-thick sections. The calcified lymph node was identified on CT in all 15 patients. CT correctly localized six of 10 endobronchial nodes and four of five peribronchial nodes. Findings due to bronchial obstruction also were seen on CT; atelectasis (n = 11), infiltration (n = 4), bronchiectasis (n = 4), and air trapping (n = 1). An associated soft-tissue mass was not seen in any case. Difficulty in determining the relationship between lymph node and bronchus is due to volume averaging, which can be decreased by scanning thinner sections. CT can suggest the diagnosis of broncholithiasis and is useful when bronchoscopy does not show a broncholith. 
Tocainide therapy in muscle cramps and spasms due to neuromuscular disease. Significant improvement in symptoms of disabling cramps and muscle spasms was obtained in 9 patients with motor neuron diseases, tetany, and myotonic disorders who were treated with tocainide, a lidocaine analog. No significant side effects were observed except for light-headedness and fatigue in 1 patient, who also showed slight prolongation of intraventricular conduction time. Tocainide is useful in treating disabling muscle spasms and cramps associated with conditions characterized by neuromuscular irritability. This effect is probably based on stabilization of the membrane potential at various levels (motor neurons, peripheral nerve, or muscle fiber membrane). 
Headache in transient or permanent cerebral ischemia. Dutch TIA Study Group. We studied headache features in 3,126 patients with acute cerebral or retinal ischemia. Headache occurred in 18% of these patients (in 16% of all patients with transient ischemic attacks, in 18% of patients with reversible ischemic neurologic deficits, and in 19% of patients with minor strokes) and was mostly continuous in all types of attacks. Headache was present in 16% of patients with monocular visual symptoms. The occurrence of headache was not related to the mode of onset, mode of disappearance, or duration of the attack. Patients with headache more often were known to have heart disease. Headache was less frequent in patients with small deep infarcts, who were more often hypertensive, and in patients with infarcts in the anterior circulation; headache was more frequent in patients with cortical infarcts and in patients with infarcts in the posterior circulation. Patients with a relevant small deep infarct on computed tomographic scan and accompanying headache relatively often reported symptoms compatible with cortical ischemia, such as language disorders or a visual field defect. We conclude that headache is a frequent accompanying symptom in patients with acute cerebral and retinal ischemia and that the occurrence of headache is partly related to the underlying cause of the ischemic lesion. 
Arteriovenous malformation in meningothelial meningioma: case report. An unusual association of a meningioma and an arteriovenous malformation is reported. A 68-year-old man developed left homonymous hemianopsia, left hemiparesis, and gaze palsy. Magnetic resonance imaging showed a right occipital mass lesion containing multiple signal-void areas with tubular and honeycomb appearance, suggesting a marked vascular component. An angiogram showed abnormal vasculature in the mass supplied by the posterior cerebral artery and a dural arteriovenous malformation on the tentorium. Neuropathological examination after total removal of the mass revealed a meningothelial meningioma including major portions of an arteriovenous malformation that extended from the dura and leptomeninges, through the meningioma, and into the occipital lobe, where the tumor was located. 
Prognostic significance of the Karnofsky Performance Status score in patients with acute myocardial infarction: comparison with the left ventricular ejection fraction and the exercise treadmill test performance. The MILIS Study Group. The prognostic significance of functional status has not been previously studied in the setting of acute myocardial infarction. We assessed the Karnofsky Performance Status (KPS) score, a simple functional status scale that is commonly used to categorize physical ability, in 849 patients with acute myocardial infarction who were enrolled in the Multicenter Investigation of the Limitation of Infarct Size (MILIS) study. We then compared the KPS score with other predictors of prognosis in these patients. In patients who presented with acute myocardial infarction, a lower KPS score (less than 8 on a scale of 1 to 10) 3 weeks before the index infarction was associated with a higher incidence of congestive heart failure, in-hospital cardiac arrest, and mortality during hospitalization, as compared with patients with KPS scores greater than or equal to 8 (each p less than 0.001). Cumulative 1-year and 4-year mortality rates were significantly higher in patients with KPS scores less than 8, as compared with patients with KPS scores greater than or equal to 8 (42.5% vs. 12.6% at 1 year and 61.6% vs 25.1% at 4 years, respectively; both p less than 0.001). The left ventricular ejection fraction on admission was significantly lower in patients with KPS scores less than 8, as compared with those with KPS scores greater than or equal to 8 (p less than 0.019). The cumulative mortality rate was equally well predicted by low KPS score and by left ventricular ejection fraction (both p less than 0.0001). 
Cerebrovascular disease in hypertensive blacks. There is convincing evidence that all grades of persistent diastolic hypertension, especially in blacks, should be treated in order to prevent stroke and other cardiovascular complications. Studies are now in progress to gather additional information concerning isolated systolic hypertension, especially in the aged. Inasmuch as at least one half or more of stroke deaths in blacks develop as the result of hypertension, lowering blood pressure offers the perfect opportunity to reduce considerably the frequency of this devastating illness. The recent dramatic fall in U.S. stroke mortality, greatest in the black female, is a commendable achievement, but the flattening of the declining mortality curve over the past several years should be a cause for alarm and intensive investigation. 
Choroidal detachment associated with malignant choroidal tumors. The association of choroidal detachment with malignant choroidal tumors is not well recognized. The authors' experience with six cases suggests that choroidal detachment may be associated with both metastatic tumors and choroidal melanoma. In two of these cases, the choroidal or retinal detachment was so massive that echography was necessary to detect the underlying tumor. Three patients presented with painful visual loss, and three patients presented with painless visual loss or a visual field defect. In one patient, the correct diagnosis and appropriate treatment of the choroidal metastasis with external radiation relieved the patient's pain and improved visual acuity from 1/200 to 20/35. Metastatic and primary uveal malignant tumors should be added to the list of causes of choroidal detachment and can be excluded only after thorough clinical, and often echographic, examination. 
Coronary risk factors and the postbypass patient. Atherosclerosis frequently develops in SVGs during the first 10 years. This process appears related to coronary risk factors. Several studies have found an association between hyperlipidemia and atherosclerosis documented at pathology. Late changes attributed to atherosclerosis that were observed at angiography were also significantly related to elevated serum levels of total cholesterol and triglycerides. They also were found in association with diabetes, systemic hypertension, and smoking in some studies. Several clinical studies have documented an association of one or several coronary risk factors with postoperative clinical events, including recurrence of angina, myocardial infarction, heart failure, reoperation because of clinical deterioration, and survival. These factors have been shown to act alone or in combination. The most important is an abnormal lipid profile and diabetes. Smoking and hypertension were seldom found to be significant predictors when considered separately, but appear to play an important role in association with the others. Control of coronary risk factors, particularly hyperlipidemia and smoking, seems mandatory in order to prevent SVG atherosclerosis and progression of the disease in the native coronary arteries. 
Short-term effect of dynamic exercise on arterial blood pressure BACKGROUND. To quantify the duration of postexercise hypotension at different exercise intensities, we studied six unmedicated, mildly hypertensive men matched with six normotensive controls. METHODS AND RESULTS. Each subject wore a 24-hour ambulatory blood pressure monitor at the same time of day for 13 consecutive hours on 3 different days. On each of the 3 days, subjects either cycled for 30 minutes at 40% or 70% maximum VO2 or performed activities of daily living. There was no intensity effect on the postexercise reduction in blood pressure, so blood pressure data were combined for the different exercise intensities. Postexercise diastolic blood pressure and mean arterial pressure were lower by 8 +/- 1 (p less than 0.001) and 7 +/- 1 mm Hg (p less than 0.05), respectively, than the preexercise values for 12.7 hours in the hypertensive group. These variables were not different before and after exercise in the normotensive group. Systolic blood pressure was reduced by 5 +/- 1 mm Hg (p less than 0.05) for 8.7 hours after exercise in the hypertensive group. In contrast, systolic blood pressure was 5 +/- 1 mm Hg (p less than 0.001) higher for 12.7 hours after exercise in the normotensive group. When the blood pressure response on the exercise days was compared with that on the nonexercise day, systolic blood pressure (135 +/- 1 versus 145 +/- 1 mm Hg) and mean arterial pressure (100 +/- 1 versus 106 +/- 1 mm Hg) were lower (p less than 0.05) on the exercise days in the hypertensive but not in the normotensive group. We found a postexercise reduction in mean arterial pressure for 12.7 hours independent of the exercise intensity in the hypertensive group. Furthermore, mean arterial pressure was lower on exercise than on nonexercise days in the hypertensive but not in the normotensive group. CONCLUSION. These findings indicate that dynamic exercise may be an important adjunct in the treatment of mild hypertension. 
The management of geriatric hypertension in health maintenance organizations. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the quality of medical care received by Medicare enrollees with hypertension in health maintenance organizations (HMOs) compared to that received by a similar group of elderly hypertensives in a fee-for-service (FFS) setting. DESIGN: A quasi-experimental design was used to study an historical cohort of newly evaluated hypertensive patients over a 2-year period. SETTING: Medicare HMO and FFS practice settings. PARTICIPANTS: Eight Medicare HMOs and 87 FFS primary care physicians in the same communities were selected. A sample of 685 elderly hypertensive patients was studied, 336 in FFS settings and 349 in HMOs. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: An expert panel of physicians selected standards of care for the management of geriatric hypertension, and medical records were reviewed. The results showed significant differences (P less than 0.01) in recording medications (94.5% HMO versus 88% FFS) and smoking histories (75.8% HMO versus 64.7% FFS), checking orthostatic blood pressures (9.5% HMO versus 3.3% FFS), performing funduscopy (44.4% HMO versus 27% FFS), completing cardiac examinations (90.8% HMO versus 79.8% FFS), and obtaining chest x-rays (72.8% HMO versus 64.3% FFS, P less than 0.05). Treatment and follow-up were similar between the two groups, except that FFS hypertensives were more likely to have medications adjusted and electrolytes ordered. CONCLUSIONS: The results suggest that elderly hypertensives in HMOs received equal or better quality of care for most criteria compared to elderly hypertensives in FFS settings. 
Proarrhythmic response to sodium channel blockade. Theoretical model and numerical experiments. BACKGROUND. The use of flecainide and encainide was terminated in the Cardiac Arrhythmia Suppression Trial because of an excess of sudden cardiac deaths in the active treatment group. Such events might arise from reentrant rhythms initiated by premature stimulation in the presence of anisotropic sodium channel availability. Drugs that bind to sodium channels increase the functional dispersion of refractoriness by slowing (a result of the drug-unbinding process) the transition from an inexcitable state to an excitable state. It is interesting that encainide and flecainide unbind slowly (15-20 seconds), whereas lidocaine and moricizine unbind rapidly (0.2-1.3 seconds). METHODS AND RESULTS. With a computer representation of a cable with Beeler-Reuter membrane properties, we found a small (6 msec) vulnerable window that occurred 338 msec after the last drive stimulus. Premature stimuli falling within the vulnerable window resulted in unidirectional block and reentrant activation. In the presence of a slowly unbinding drug, the window was delayed an additional 341 msec, and its duration was extended to 38 msec. The delay (antiarrhythmic effect) before the onset of the vulnerable window and its duration (proarrhythmic effect) were both dependent on the sodium channel availability and the recovery process. Both effects were also prolonged when sodium channel availability was reduced by membrane depolarization. Defining the proarrhythmic potential as the duration of the vulnerable window, we found that hypothetical use-dependent class I drugs have a greater proarrhythmic potential than non-use-dependent drugs. CONCLUSIONS. The antiarrhythmic and proarrhythmic properties of pure sodium channel antagonists are both dependent on sodium channel availability. Consequently, the price for increased antiarrhythmic efficacy (suppressed premature ventricular contractions) is an increased proarrhythmic vulnerability to unsuppressed premature ventricular contractions. 
Comparison of chlorambucil and prednisone versus cyclophosphamide, vincristine, and prednisone as initial treatment for chronic lymphocytic leukemia: long-term follow-up of an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group randomized clinical trial. The Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) conducted a study in which patients with advanced chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) were randomized between a regimen consisting of chlorambucil (30 mg/m2 orally day 1) and prednisone (80 mg orally days 1 to 5) (C + P) administered every 2 weeks and a more intensive regimen of cyclosphosphamide (300 mg/m2 orally days 1 to 5), vincristine (1.4 mg/m2 intravenously [IV] day 1), and prednisone (100 mg/m2 orally days 1 to 5) (CVP) given every 3 weeks. Treatment was continued for up to 18 months to maximal response. Of the 122 eligible patients, 60 received C + P, while 62 received CVP. With a median follow-up of 7 years, there were no significant differences in survival (4.8 v 3.9 years, P = .12), complete remission (CR) rate (25% v 23%; P = .83), or duration of response (2.0 v 1.9 years; P = .78) between C + P and CVP. Toxicity was modest despite the prolonged treatment. The long median survival of 4.1 years for stage III and IV patients is superior to that usually reported. This could stem from continuing treatment to maximal response rather than an increase in intensity of therapy. These results are comparable to those reported with cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, and prednisone (CHOP) therapy by other investigators. The data suggest that intermittent C + P administered to maximal response continues to be the standard treatment approach for advanced CLL. 
Impact of changing attitudes in carotid surgery on community hospital practice. In 1985, institutional guidelines for the evaluation and performance of carotid surgery were established in our community hospital. During the 5-year period from 1985 through 1989, 159 carotid reconstructions were done. There were four major strokes (3%), one eventually resulting in death, with the second death in this series from a myocardial infarction (mortality 1%). The combined mortality/major stroke morbidity incidence was 3%. Three transient ischemic attacks (2%) postoperatively cleared promptly without residua. During the latter 1980s, an increasing number of vascular surgeons were doing less carotid surgery. Monitoring institutional quality assurance and individual surgeon performance within the community hospital is becoming a reality. Our experience with institutional guidelines for the evaluation and conduct of carotid surgery, together with an assessment of results and ongoing individual surgeon performance, is presented. Maintaining acceptable morbidity and mortality statistics can be enhanced by having a plan for assessment, management, and concurrent review. 
Clonal analysis of T-cell deficiencies in autotransplant recipients. We have used limiting dilution culture methods to determine the frequency of mitogen-responsive T cells in peripheral blood of patients after bone marrow autotransplantation, and have compared their responsiveness to that of allotransplant recipients and normal controls. Autotransplant patients were found to have low responder cell frequencies in tests for lymphokine-secreting helper function, and for IL-2 dependent proliferator and cytotoxic function. Multiple regression analysis showed that function was lower in autotransplant patients than in allorecipients, and lower in male patients for all three functional assays. Patients with clinically significant infection tended to have lower proliferative function in both transplant groups and lower cytotoxic function in the allotransplant population. Graft-versus-host disease was associated with lower T-cell function, but was present only in the allotransplant group; therefore, it cannot account for the even lower levels of function observed in the autotransplant population. Because we observe deficits in T-cell regeneration in autotransplant recipients that are even more severe than in allorecipients, we postulate that cellular immunodeficiency after bone marrow transplantation may reflect limitations in thymic-dependent repopulation rather than an effect of genetic disparity between host and donor (eg, clinical or subclinical graft-versus-host). 
Necrotizing bronchial aspergillosis in a patient receiving neoadjuvant chemotherapy for non-small cell lung carcinoma. We describe a case of necrotizing bronchial aspergillosis which developed after lobectomy following neoadjuvant chemotherapy in a 73-year-old woman with non-small cell lung cancer. The lesion was visualized and biopsied through FBS, which played a useful role for early diagnosis of this disease. Itraconazole therapy was effective and safe. 
Choriocarcinoma of the testis metastatic to the skin. A case of choriocarcinoma of the testis metastatic to the skin is reported. In this case report the primary tumor was first diagnosed by the histopathologic findings in the cutaneous biopsy of a single nodule that appeared on the chest, with both syncytiotrophoblastic and cytotrophoblastic cells in the metastatic solid tumor islands. Using peroxidase-antiperoxidase techniques, beta-human chorionic gonadotropin (beta-HCG) was positive within the cytoplasm of syncytiotrophoblastic cells. The patient was treated with orchiectomy, chemotherapy, and radiotherapy. With these measures there was a decrease of chorionic gonadotropin serum levels to normal limits and 2 years after this treatment there is no evidence of recurrence. 
Cor triatriatum dexter: recognition and percutaneous transluminal correction. Cor triatriatum dexter is a rare congenital anomaly in which an obstructive membrane is located in the right atrium. The detection usually occurs after the sequelae of systemic congestion, coagulopathy, and hepatic dysfunction have set in, leading up to a high surgical risk. A percutaneous balloon correction of cor triatriatum dexter in a patient with advanced right-sided congestive symptoms and hepatic dysfunction is presented. This efficacious method is an alternative to surgical correction and could be extended to the more common cor triatriatum sinistra. 
Renal cell carcinoma involving penis and testis: unusual initial presentations of metastatic disease. Solitary parenchymal metastases of renal cell carcinoma to the penis or testis are rare. We report 1 case of each: in one instance the patient presented with priapism and an asymptomatic primary tumor; in the other, the metastasis presented as an acute change in a long-standing hydrocele more than one year after nephrectomy. Both patients had either positive margins at resection or recurrence after resection of the metastasis. While long-term, disease-free survival has been reported after orchiectomy for isolated metastatic disease, penile involvement appears to carry a very poor prognosis. 
Intratumoral cytogenetic heterogeneity in a benign neoplasm. Cytogenetic findings are reported in a 64-year-old man who had a history of rapid growth of a mass in the left groin area. The histopathologic diagnosis of the tumor was consistent with that of a lipoma with atypia. Cytogenetic analysis was done on an incisional biopsy specimen. The initial biopsy specimen revealed, in addition to normal cells, three different clones: 46,XY,t(12;21)(q13;q21), 46,XY, t(2;12)(q11.2'1.2), t(19;20)(q13.1'3), and 47.XY,+ r. The subsequently excised specimen showed a normal male karyotype (46,XY) and a predominant clone with the karyotype, 47,XY,t(2;12)(q11.2'1.2),t(3;11)(p24'5), + r. One cell with 47,XY, + r was present. In addition, polyploid cells with large markers, rings, and a high frequency of telomeric associations were also observed. 
Possible involvement of inositol-lipid metabolism in malignant hyperthermia. Alpha-adrenoceptor stimulation may induce malignant hyperthermia (MH) in vivo. Consequently, we have investigated the effects of the alpha-adrenoceptor agonist phenylephrine and, for comparison, the effects of the beta-adrenoceptor agonist isoproterenol on inositol-lipid metabolism of malignant hyperthermia susceptible (MHS) and healthy control (MHN) swine. The experiments were performed on electrically stimulated (frequency 0.2 Hz) trabeculae isolated from the right ventricles of the hearts of MHS and MHN animals. After labelling with [3H]inositol for 6 h, different inositol phosphates were measured by high pressure liquid chromatography, including inositol 1-phosphate, inositol 1,4-bisphosphate, inositol 1,3,4-trisphosphate, inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (1,4,5-IP3) and inositol 1,3,4,5-tetrakisphosphate. After stimulation with isoproterenol, the inositol phosphate content did not increase or vary between muscle from MHS and MHN animals. In contrast, all inositol phosphates increased after stimulation with phenylephrine in both muscle types, the effects being greater in MHS than in MHN, especially as regards 1,4,5-IP3 content. As 1,4,5-IP3, a presumed second messenger, has been shown to mobilize intracellular calcium, it is concluded that an enhanced alpha-adrenergic response is involved in the development of MH. 
Usefulness of high-frequency analysis of signal-averaged surface electrocardiograms in acute myocardial infarction before and after coronary thrombolysis for assessing coronary reperfusion. The incidence of late potentials on the signal-averaged electrocardiogram before and after coronary thrombolysis was studied in 54 patients with an acute myocardial infarction of less than or equal to 5 hours' duration and with an angiographically documented total occlusion of the infarct-related coronary artery on admission. A significant (p = 0.038) 50% relative reduction in the incidence of late potentials was observed in the group of 35 patients who underwent reperfusion: from 16 of 35 (46%) before to 8 of 35 (23%) at 120 minutes after the start of thrombolytic treatment. No significant reduction was seen in the 19 patients in whom thrombolysis was unsuccessful: from 8 of 19 (42%) before to 7 of 19 (37%) afterward. Despite successful recanalization, late potentials persisted or newly developed after thrombolytic therapy in 8 of 54 patients (15%). It is concluded that successful thrombolysis reduces the incidence of late potentials on the signal-averaged electrocardiogram but that the sensitivity and specificity of this finding are not high enough to allow reliable monitoring of coronary reperfusion at the bedside. 
The use of soap and water in two Bangladeshi communities: implications for the transmission of diarrhea. Efforts to reduce the incidence of diarrheal infections in which enteropathogens are endemic have focused on education about the importance of hand washing to interrupt transmission of such organisms. Since the effectiveness of health education depends on an understanding of the recipients' ideas and customs, we studied perceptions of cleanliness and the role of soap and hand washing in two poor Bangladeshi communities, one rural and one urban. We found that ideas about cleanliness generally are not based on germ theory; cleanliness is viewed in a larger, socioreligious context of purity vs. impurity. Washing serves both physical and spiritual needs and is performed according to defined patterns that may not effectively interrupt transmission of microorganisms. Soap is regarded as a cosmetic rather than an agent for removal of microorganisms. 
Transcatheter occlusion of pulmonary arterial circulation and collateral supply: failures, incidents, and complications. Failures and complications were analyzed retrospectively in 45 patients treated with embolotherapy or occlusion of pulmonary arterial circulation. Pulmonary arterial branches were occluded with steel coils in 19 patients with pulmonary arteriovenous malformations, 17 with hemoptysis of pulmonary artery (PA) origin, and one with massive parenchymal shunt. Bronchial arterial supply to the lung was embolized with small particles in eight cases of hemoptysis and systemic to pulmonary arterial antegrade shunt secondary to chronic thromboembolism. Asymptomatic incidents included catheterization failures, vascular damage, partial occlusion, partial recanalization of the thrombus, ectopic deposition of a coil, and delayed bacterial contamination of the thrombus. A few cases of transient clinical and radiologic signs of pulmonary infarction were observed after complete occlusion of the PA and bronchial artery embolization. This complication was never observed after complete occlusion of main right or left PA, inferior right or left PA, or segmental branches. The management and prevention of these complications, the role of bronchial arterial collateral pathways, and the importance of the site of PA occlusion in the development of pulmonary infarction are discussed. 
Effect of aspirin on heterotopic ossification after total hip arthroplasty in men who have osteoarthrosis. The severity of heterotopic ossification was determined from the radiographs of eighty-three men in whom osteoarthrosis had been treated with a primary total hip arthroplasty with cement. The medical records of these patients were then reviewed, with the reviewer having no knowledge of the radiographic findings. A similar operative approach and technique had been used in all patients. There was no association between the amount of intraoperative loss of blood or the duration of the operation and the severity of formation of heterotopic bone. The over-all rate of occurrence of heterotopic ossification was 72 per cent. Of the fifty-eight patients who had received aspirin throughout their course in the hospital, two (3 per cent) had severe ectopic ossification (grade III or IV8). In contrast, twelve (48 per cent) of the twenty-five patients who had received no aspirin or in whom aspirin had been discontinued so that anticoagulation could be begun had severe heterotopic ossification. The difference in the severity of the ossification between the two groups is significant (p less than 0.0001). 
Inhibition of the metabolism of atrial natriuretic factor causes diuresis and natriuresis in chronic heart failure. Atrial natriuretic factor (ANF) is a peptide hormone secreted by the heart that is degraded in vivo by endopeptidase 24:11 (atriopeptidase). UK 69,578 is a novel atriopeptidase inhibitor that raises plasma levels of ANF in animals and normal volunteers, with associated diuresis and natriuresis. This study examines the effects of UK 69,578 in patients with mild heart failure. UK 69,578 was administered as an intravenous infusion over 20 min in a placebo-controlled, cross-over study to six patients with stable (NYHA Class 2) chronic heart failure. The atriopeptidase inhibitor was well tolerated and no side effects were encountered. Mean baseline plasma ANF was elevated at 88 pg/mL (normal less than 50), and increased 2- to 5-fold after UK 69,578 administration. Plasma ANF did not change significantly following placebo. There was a marked diuresis after UK 69,578 compared to placebo. Urinary sodium excretion doubled for 4 to 6 h, but there was no significant rise in potassium excretion. There was no increase in plasma active renin concentration during the study period. Noninvasive hemodynamic monitoring revealed no significant changes in heart rate, systemic arterial blood pressure, or echocardiographic left ventricular dimensions. However, invasive measurements using a Swan-Ganz catheter demonstrated falls in mean right atrial and pulmonary artery wedge pressures after UK 69,578. There was no change in cardiac output. Thus, inhibition of endopeptidase 24:11 by UK 69,578 results in significant elevation of plasma ANF, with associated diuresis, natriuresis and venodilatation. The compound was well tolerated in these patients with mild chronic heart failure. 
Primary central nervous system lymphoma in acquired immune deficiency syndrome. A clinical and pathologic study with results of treatment with radiation. Primary central nervous system (CNS) lymphoma occurs frequently in patients with the acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS). Seventeen patients with AIDS and biopsy-proven CNS lymphoma were treated with whole-brain radiation. At presentation, most patients were severely debilitated from previous AIDS-related illnesses. Patients generally had focal neurologic symptoms such as seizures and paralysis. Headaches and mental status changes, often noticed after hospital admission, seldom brought our patients to seek medical attention. Computed tomography (CT) scan showed low-density, contrast-enhancing, mass lesions with variable amounts of peritumor edema. Size, location, and pattern of contrast enhancement of the lesions varied. No specific pattern was seen that could be used to distinguish between CNS lymphoma, toxoplasmosis, or other CNS diseases that occur in patients with AIDS. Biopsy results showed angiocentric, high-grade, large cell tumors with frequent necrosis. Immunohistochemical analysis showed B-cell phenotype with small amounts of T-cells, presumably reactive. All patients received irradiation to the whole brain with parallel opposed fields. A variety of doses and treatment regimens were used. Mean survival was only 72 days. Survival was longer in patients with higher pretreatment Karnofsky scores. The correlation between dose and survival was not significant. At completion of therapy, most patients showed improvement in Karnofsky score and had partial improvement in neurologic symptoms. CNS lymphomas in patients with AIDS are responsive to radiation. Posttreatment CT scans showed regression of tumors. Autopsy examinations showed regression of tumors, but also showed concurrent CNS infections, AIDS encephalopathy, and radiation-induced changes within the normal CNS tissue. Opportunistic infections rather than cerebral herniation or uncontrolled lymphoma was the most common cause of death. 
Gradation of unstable angina based on a sensitive immunoassay for serum creatine kinase MB. A newly developed, highly sensitive immunoassay for creatine kinase MB isoenzyme was evaluated in 68 patients with or without different types of ischaemic heart disease. Patients were classified on the basis of clinical criteria in four groups: no ischaemic heart disease, stable angina, unstable angina, and acute myocardial infarction. Enzyme concentration in patients with stable angina was the same (even during exercise) as seen in the patients without ischaemic heart disease. Patients with unstable angina, however, could be divided into two groups. One group showed clear evidence of severe myocardial ischaemia by serial changes and higher mean values of creatine kinase MB up to 40 hours after the onset of symptoms, whereas in the remainder values were stable and resembled those seen in the patients without ischaemic heart disease. The changes in concentration correlated with signs of repetitive ischaemic episodes deduced from continuous ST segment monitoring during the first 24 hours after admission. These findings indicate that patients with unstable angina are a heterogenous group. In some, severe and prolonged ischaemia can be detected by a serological assay with high sensitivity. 
Is it time to use evoked potentials to predict outcome in comatose children and adults? OBJECTIVE: To determine the value of multimodality-evoked potential recordings in predicting outcome in comatose children. DESIGN: Prospective series and literature review. SETTING: Pediatric ICU in a university hospital. PATIENTS: Forty-one children with a Glasgow Coma Scale score of less than 8, who were admitted to the pediatric ICU between 1984 and 1989. INTERVENTIONS: Forty-one patients underwent brainstem auditory-evoked potential testing within 72 hrs of admission. Of these patients, 37 also had somatosensory-evoked potential testing at the same time. Four patients did not receive somatosensory-evoked potential testing for various nonmedical reasons. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Multimodality-evoked potential recordings were used to predict outcome in these comatose children. Outcomes were categorized as bad (death or chronic vegetative state) or good (all other outcomes). Survivor outcomes were determined at discharge and on subsequent follow-up visits from 1 to 3 yrs later. There were no false pessimistic predictions, and two false optimistic predictions in this series. A comprehensive literature review of coma outcome prediction, using multimodality-evoked potential recordings, revealed 20 series with 982 additional patients in whom the predictive errors of false optimism and false pessimism could be determined. Five cases of false pessimism and 99 cases of false optimism were identified in the 982 additional patients. If neonates are excluded, the false pessimism number is reduced to three. CONCLUSIONS: A bad outcome can be reliably predicted using multimodality-evoked potential recordings with little chance of a false pessimistic prediction. The acceptable error of false optimism occurs frequently, since patients often die of progressive neurologic and nonneurologic problems that may or may not be present at the time of the evoked potential recordings. Thus, in comatose children, multimodality-evoked potential recordings are a useful adjunct to clinical examination and other diagnostic aids in predicting outcome and in making decisions regarding the degree of intervention to offer. 
Prevention of chronic erosive streptococcal cell wall-induced arthritis in rats by treatment with a monoclonal antibody against the T cell antigen receptor alpha beta. Rats treated with an mAb (R73) against the TCR-alpha beta failed to develop chronic persistent arthritis after injection of streptococcal cell walls. Histologically, R73 mAb-treated rats had mild hyperplasia of synovial lining cells and minimal destruction of cartilage. In contrast, control-treated animals developed marked pannus formation, with pronounced infiltration of mononuclear cells and severe destruction of cartilage and subchondral bone. The preventive effect of R73 mAb on streptococcal cell wall-induced arthritis was associated with the marked depletion of alpha beta + T cells by R73 mAb. These results indicate that T cells play a crucial role in chronic erosive streptococcal cell wall-induced arthritis. 
Hypertrophy of nodules of Arantius and aortic insufficiency: pathophysiology and repair. Aortic insufficiency (AI) due to fibrosis and thickening of the nodules of Arantius in the otherwise normal aortic valve was found in 11 adults (age range, 41 to 65 years) between 1976 and 1988. Nine had concomitant mitral stenosis; 2 had coronary artery disease. In 6 patients AI was graded 3+ or greater; in 5 it was less than 3+. Correction of AI and restoration of cuspid flexibility and apposition by shaving the hypertrophied nodules was accomplished in all, with postrepair AI graded as 1+ or less. There was one hospital death, a patient who had prior mitral operation. Mean follow-up was 68 +/- 56 months. Only 1 patient had late (6 years) recurrent serious (3+) AI. Nine continued to have 1+ or less AI, based on echocardiography or catheterization (n = 6) or on physical examination performed at a mean of 74 months. We conclude that thickening of the nodules of Arantius may cause AI. Long-term correction can be accomplished by sculpturing of the involved cusps. 
The consistency of pulse frequencies and pulse patterns of transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) used by chronic pain patients. This study records the consistency of transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) pulse frequency and pulse pattern used by 13 chronic patients over a 1 year period. The results show that patients prefer specific pulse frequencies and pulse patterns unique to the individual and that they turn to such frequencies and patterns on subsequent treatment sessions. Pulse frequencies and pulse patterns were not related to the cause and site of pain, a finding consistent with previous study in this laboratory. This observation, coupled with the large variability in pulse frequencies and pulse patterns used between individuals, implies that patients prefer such frequencies and patterns for reasons of comfort which may not be related to mechanisms specific to the pain system. 
Tuberculosis of the pancreas: report of three cases. Three cases of pancreatic tuberculosis are described. The first patient presented with abdominal pain, weight loss, anorexia, vomiting, hepatomegaly, and mass in the head of the pancreas, on computerized tomographic (CT) scan. The second patient presented with low grade fever, anorexia, and weight loss, and was investigated for gallbladder disease. The third patient presented with obstructive jaundice and mass lesion in the head of the pancreas. Two patients underwent laparotomy for suspected pancreatic tumors. The findings of pancreatic disease was incidental during laparotomy in the second patient. The histopathology revealed caseating granuloma in all of them. The first patient responded well to treatment, and the second patient stopped treatment after 2 months and is well. The third patient is being followed. If malignancy can be ruled out, tuberculosis should be considered in relevant geographic areas, and a tissue diagnosis should be made. 
Myocardial infarction: assessment with an intravascular MR contrast medium. Work in progress. The effect of a new intravascular magnetic resonance (MR) contrast medium (gadolinium diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid [DTPA] polylysine) was evaluated in acute, subacute, and chronic myocardial infarctions in rats. Signal intensity (SI) was measured before and after intravenous administration of Gd-DTPA polylysine. Before administration of contrast material, chronic infarctions had lower SI than normal myocardium. With Gd-DTPA polylysine, three zones were identified in acute and subacute stages of myocardial infarction, but in the chronic stage, images demonstrated two zones. In acute and subacute infarctions, Gd-DTPA polylysine produced greater enhancement (over 60 minutes) in the peri-infarction zone than in the normal or infarcted myocardium. In chronic infarctions, Gd-DTPA polylysine had no discernible effect on the SI of the central infarction zone. Overall, it caused no significant hemodynamic effects. MR imaging with Gd-DTPA polylysine produced differential tissue enhancement in myocardial infarctions, which varied according to the age of the infarction. 
Aluminium sulphate in water in north Cornwall and outcome of pregnancy. OBJECTIVE--To determine whether the excess aluminum sulphate accidentally added to the local water supply in north Cornwall in July 1988 had an adverse effect on the outcome of pregnancies. DESIGN--Outcomes of all singleton pregnancies in the affected area at the time of the incident (n = 92) were compared with those in two control groups: pregnancies in this area completed before the incident (n = 68) and pregnancies in a neighbouring area (n = 193). SUBJECTS--Mothers in the three groups, among whom there were 13 miscarriages, five terminations of pregnancy, and 336 live births. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES--Fetal and perinatal loss, birth weight, gestation, obstetric complications, neonatal condition, and congenital defects. RESULTS--Among 88 pregnancies in women exposed to excess aluminum sulphate there was no excess of perinatal deaths (n = 0), low birthweight (n = 3), preterm delivery (n = 4), or severe congenital malformations (n = 0). There was, however, an increased rate of talipes in exposed fetuses (four cases, one control; p = 0.01). CONCLUSIONS--Because of small numbers it is not possible to say that high doses of aluminum sulphate are safe in pregnancy, but there is no evidence from this study of major problems apparent at birth. 
Acute cardiogenic pulmonary edema treated with mechanical ventilation. Factors determining in-hospital mortality. We reviewed 88 episodes of cardiogenic pulmonary edema (CPE) treated with mechanical ventilation to define the clinical features that predict in-hospital mortality. Fifty-six patients survived to hospital discharge. APACHE II scores were not helpful in prediction. Multiple logistic regression models to predict outcome were developed using variables present at the time of intubation and 24 hours later. The model at the time of intubation indicated mortality was related to systolic blood pressure less than 130 mm Hg, the presence of anterior myocardial infarction, use of calcium channel blockers, age, and absence of prior hospitalization for CPE. A model using additional variables available 24 hours later showed that mortality was related only to the need for vasopressor medication at 24 hours, and systolic blood pressure at intubation less than 130 mm Hg. The predictive power of these models was confirmed by applying them to 46 additional patients. The variables contained in these models suggest that the prognosis of patients with CPE treated with mechanical ventilation depends primarily on the severity of acute left ventricular injury. Variables relating the degree of respiratory failure, however, were not predictive of mortality. These multiple logistic regression models provide a means to compare patients with CPE for quality assessment purposes and for studies of treatment regimens, and may also provide information useful to patient and family counseling regarding the value of continued aggressive intensive care. 
Intra- and interindividual variability of glucose tolerance in an elderly population. The intra- and interindividual variability of the oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) and other risk factors was investigated in 237 subjects, aged 64-87, examined annually in the period 1971-1975. Coefficients of intraindividual variation (CVa) were calculated from individual regressions on time. The lowest CVa was found for the summary index including fasting glucose (area under the curve, AUC): 10.0 +/- 4.9%. For fasting and 30, 60, and 120 min glucose the values ranged from 12 to 18%. The CVa's were not associated with age, gender, drug use, and disease prevalence, and may also be applied to other populations. The reliability coefficient depended on the prevalence of diabetes in the population and was higher than observed in younger populations. The highest reliability coefficient was observed for AUC: 0.81. For the combined information of OGTT, reflected by AUC or by classification according to WHO criteria, the variability was comparable to that of other cardiovascular risk factors such as serum total cholesterol. 
Tolerance to intravenous nitroglycerin in patients with congestive heart failure: role of increased intravascular volume, neurohumoral activation and lack of prevention with N-acetylcysteine To better understand the mechanism of nitrate tolerance in patients with congestive heart failure, 13 patients received a 24 h infusion of nitroglycerin (1.5 micrograms/kg body weight per min) with or without N-acetylcysteine (225 mg/kg per 24 h). The infusions were separated by a 24 h nitrate-free interval. By the end of the nitroglycerin infusion, mean arterial pressure had returned to baseline values and there was a significant increase in ventricular filling pressures and systemic vascular resistance compared with values after 1 h of treatment. The simultaneous infusion of N-acetylcysteine had no effect on these changes. Although a strict fluid restriction of 1.5 liters/day was maintained for 1 week before and throughout the study, after 24 h of nitroglycerin infusion there was a significant and similar degree of hemodilution whether nitroglycerin was infused alone (9.1 +/- 4.3%) or with N-acetylcysteine (8.7 +/- 4.1%). This hemodilution corresponded to an increase in intravascular volume of 745 +/- 382 ml, most of which occurred during the 1st h. Plasma renin activity increased and plasma atrial natriuretic peptide decreased during the infusion. The results of this study suggest that nitrate tolerance is multifactorial. In addition to the previously described pharmacologic tolerance to the effect of nitroglycerin on vascular smooth muscle, a capillary fluid shift from the extravascular to intravascular space appears to be involved, especially during the 1st h of the infusion. A third mechanism, reflex neurohumoral activation, also seems to contribute to the genesis of nitroglycerin tolerance. 
A new provocative test for chronic mesenteric ischemia. A new provocative test for chronic mesenteric ischemia is described, based upon the demonstration of a fall in the intramural pH of the small bowel after introduction of a test meal into the stomach. Intramural pH (pHI) is determined indirectly by tonometry, utilizing a tonometer passed per os. Postoperative assessment of revascularization procedures is also possible by the same technique. Application of the test in an 84-yr-old woman showed good correlation between a preoperative fall in jejunal intramural pH and abdominal pain, and the absence of a fall postoperatively after successful revascularization. 
High dietary linoleic acid affects the fatty acid compositions of individual phospholipids from tissues of Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar): association with stress susceptibility and cardiac lesion. For 16 wk Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) post-smolts were fed practical-type diets that contained either fish oil (FO) or sunflower oil (SO) as the lipid component. Both diets contained adequate (n-3) polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA). All the phospholipids of heart and liver from SO-fed fish had increased levels of 18:2(n-6), 20:2(n-6) and 20:3(n-6); phosphatidyl choline (PC) and phosphatidyl ethanolamine (PE) also had increased 20:4(n-6). There was a general decrease in 20:5(n-3) in the phospholipids, reflected in an increase in the 20:4(n-6)/20:5(n-3) ratio, especially in PC and PE. The fatty acid compositions of phospholipids from brain and retina were much less affected by dietary linoleate than those of heart and liver. Fish fed SO developed severe heart lesions that caused thinning of the ventricular wall and muscle necrosis. The fish fed SO also were susceptible to a transportation-induced shock syndrome that caused 30% mortality. These results establish that a diet with a low (n-3)/(n-6) ratio can cause changes in fatty acid metabolism that are deleterious to the health of salmonid fish, especially when subjected to stress. 
Molecular heterogeneity and cellular localization of carboxypeptidase H in the islets of Langerhans. The intracellular distribution and molecular heterogeneity of carboxypeptidase H was studied in rat insulinoma tissue and isolated islets of Langerhans by a combination of immunohistochemical, ultrastructural, subcellular fractionation, and immunoblotting analyses. Immunofluorescence microscopy of islets demonstrated the presence of carboxypeptidase H in both insulin-containing B cells and glucagon-containing A cells. Quantitative ultrastructural analyses of islet B cells indicated that the enzyme was concentrated in mature insulin secretory granules, clathrin-coated condensing granules, and to a lesser extent the Golgi apparatus. Carboxypeptidase H activity was localized principally to secretory granule subfractions of insulinoma tissue, where it was present for the major part (70%) as a form which is readily solubilizable at pH values prevailing in the granule interior (5.5). This species migrated as a diffuse band of 53-57 kilodaltons (kDa) on immunoblot analysis using antisera raised against the purified native enzyme. In contrast, the insoluble form which was associated with the granule membrane at pH 5.5, migrated as a relatively compact band of 55-57 kDa. Carboxypeptidase H activity was also present in subcellular fractions which contained Golgi membranes together with elements of the endoplasmic reticulum, and in a low density secretory granule fraction which may represent immature granules. The enzyme in these compartments, like the granule membrane species, migrated as a compact 55-57 kDa band on immunoblots. Two-dimensional electrophoretic immunoblot analysis of secretory granules suggested that both membrane and soluble forms of the enzyme were glycoproteins and that the terminal glycosylation was similar in both instances. Antiserum raised against the deduced C-terminal 11 amino acids of the cloned carboxypeptidase H sequence recognized the 55-57 kDa membrane component in granules but did not react with the 53-57 kDa soluble species. A major difference between the soluble and membrane forms therefore appears to be a structural modification or proteolytic removal of the C-terminal domain in the trans-Golgi or early secretory granule compartment. The concept that proteolysis is involved is further supported by the observation that the relative proportion of the high and low mol wt forms of the enzyme in different subcellular fractions correlated with that of proinsulin and insulin, respectively. The membrane association of the 55-57 kDa form of carboxypeptidase H is disrupted at pH values of 9 and is dependent on ionic strength. This further suggests that the C-terminus of the protein may have an important role in the sorting or concentration of the enzyme in vesicular elements of the regulated pathway of secretion. 
Relation of stenosis morphology and clinical presentation to the procedural results of directional coronary atherectomy BACKGROUND. Directional coronary atherectomy has recently become available to treat coronary stenoses. This study was performed to determine the relation of patient characteristics and stenosis morphology to procedural outcome with directional coronary atherectomy to gain insight into which patients might be best treated with this device. METHODS AND RESULTS. Four hundred stenoses from 378 patients consecutively treated at six major referral institutions were analyzed. Angiographic data were assessed at a central angiographic laboratory using standardized morphological criteria and computer-assisted quantitative dimensional analyses. Procedural success was achieved in 87.8% of stenoses, and major ischemic complications (death, myocardial infarction, and emergency bypass surgery) occurred in 6.3% of patients. Lesion success and complications were closely correlated with recognized modified American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association Task Force lesion morphological criteria. Observed for type A stenoses were 93% success and 3% complication rates; for type B1 stenoses, 88% success and 6% complication rates; and for type B2 stenoses, 75% success and 13% complication rates, respectively. There were too few type C stenoses treated to analyze. Furthermore, multivariate testing demonstrated stenosis angulation (multivariate p less than 0.001), proximal tortuosity (p less than 0.001), decreased preatherectomy minimum lumen dimension (p = 0.032), and calcification (p = 0.041) to correlate independently with adverse outcome and complex, probably thrombus-associated stenoses to have a favorable outcome (p = 0.055). Operator experience (p = 0.020) and a history of restenosis (p = 0.022) also favorably influenced outcome. CONCLUSIONS. The procedural outcome of directional coronary atherectomy is highly associated with coronary stenosis morphology. Furthermore, after appropriate stratification for morphology and clinical presentation, overall atherectomy procedural outcome may be similar to that achieved with coronary angioplasty. However, specific subsets of patients may have relatively better outcome with either atherectomy or balloon angioplasty. 
Through a looking glass. A new technique to demonstrate directional hypokinesia in unilateral neglect. A line cancellation task was performed by right brain-damaged patients with neglect in two response conditions. The task was presented either in normal view or through a 90 degree angle mirror with direct view prevented. The latter decouples the direction of visual attention and of arm movement. In the mirror condition, 4 of 18 patients cancelled lines only in right hemispace which means that they directed their visual attention to the left but failed to execute movements towards contralateral hemispace--what has been termed directional hypokinesia. In contrast, 10 patients cancelled lines only in left hemispace in the mirror condition, which accords better with attention-representation deficit hypotheses. Our results support a division of the neglect syndrome according to whether perceptual or premotor deficits are predominant. 
Malignant peritoneal mesothelioma in childhood with long-term survival. A diffuse, well-differentiated, malignant peritoneal mesothelioma (MPM) developed in a nine-year-old girl. She received limited chemotherapy and radiation therapy and is alive and well without clinical evidence of disease 109 months after diagnosis. The neoplastic cells stained immunohistochemically for cytokeratin and epithelial membrane antigen but were unreactive with B72.3, anti-carcinoembryonic antigen, and anti-Leu-M1. Ultrastructurally, the tumor cells had abundant desmosomes, numerous tonofilament bundles, and variable-length microvilli. These findings confirm the mesothelial nature of the cells. Features consistent with malignancy included DNA aneuploidy by flow cytometric analysis and diffuse peritoneal involvement. The three previously described survivors with MPM were also premenarchal girls. Some MPMs in premenarchal girls have an indolent biologic behavior similar to that of low-grade peritoneal serous neoplasia or well-differentiated papillary mesothelioma in adult women. 
Valve-related complications with the Hancock I porcine bioprosthesis. A twelve- to fourteen-year follow-up study. Valve-related morbidity and mortality after heart valve replacement with the Hancock I porcine bioprosthesis has been retrospectively analyzed. From June 1974 through December 1976, 253 Hancock I bioprostheses (150 mitral and 103 aortic) were inserted in 220 selected patients who survived the operation and had follow-up until June 1989 (mean follow-up 13.5 years, with an accumulative follow-up of 2956.4 patient-years). One hundred seventeen patients had mitral valve replacement, 70 had aortic valve replacement, and 33 had combined mitral and aortic valve replacement. There were 27 thromboembolic events. The probability of being free from thromboembolism at 14 years was 81.0% +/- 7.4% for the mitral valve replacement group, 85.4% +/- 6.7% for the aortic group, and 67.1% +/- 18.4% for the mitral-aortic group. Fifteen episodes of prosthetic valve endocarditis occurred. There were 10 instances of nonstructural dysfunction (paravalvular leaks) in seven mitral valves (4.6%) and in three aortic valves (2.9%). One hundred twenty-two bioprostheses in 106 patients resulted in structural deterioration. The probability of freedom from structural deterioration at 14 years was 37.2% +/- 3.9% for the mitral group, 43.9% +/- 7.1% for the aortic group, and 30.1% +/- 8.9% for the mitral-aortic group. The logistic regression analysis between age at the time of operation and bioprosthetic life (structural deterioration-free period) demonstrates a linear regression curve (r = 0.53). There were 56 late deaths (27 patients died at reoperation). The actuarial survival rate (including hospital mortality) at 14 years was 57.2% +/- 5.4% for the entire series, with no statistically significant difference between groups. The probability of remaining free from valve-related morbidity and mortality at 14 years was 16.7% +/- 4.8% for the mitral group, 20.8% +/- 6.2% for the aortic group, and 14.0% +/- 7.0% for the mitral-aortic group. The long-term results of this series show that the clinical performance of the Hancock I porcine valve appears satisfactory during the first 6 years. The behavior of this bioprosthesis at 14 years' follow-up changes drastically, because only a minor group of patients is free from valve-related complications, justifying the restriction of its use for selected patients. 
Endothelial cell seeding. Endothelial cell seeding is the transplantation of vascular endothelial cells to denuded vascular surfaces. Seeding theoretically reduces the probability of graft or vessel thrombosis and of neointimal fibrous hyperplasia. Thus far, clinical seeding trials disclosed modest improvements in patency and the development of hyperplastic anastomotic lesions in failed grafts. Seeding inefficiency theoretically contributes to anastomotic hyperplasia. The inefficiency is linked to two steps in the seeding process, namely harvesting and cell retention. Of these, cell retention on the seeded surface is the more critical. Priorities for future research should be set first on the retention of seeded endothelium in vitro and second on improved and standardized methods of cell harvesting. 
Production and characterization of tumor infiltrating lymphocyte clones derived from B16-F10 murine melanoma. The adoptive transfer of tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (TIL) in conjunction with recombinant interleukin-2 (rIL-2) for the treatment of advanced cancer has recently been under intense investigation. Despite extensive research, the precise surface phenotype of TIL remains to be fully defined. To elucidate this unsolved problem, we established 11 TIL clones derived from rIL-2 expanded TIL obtained from B16-F10 murine melanoma tumors. These clones could be divided phenotypically into four groups: CD8 (+) T-cell clones, natural killer (NK)-cell clones, NK-like CD8 (+) T-cell clones, and double negative T-cell clones. Functionally, CD8 (+) T-cell clones demonstrated specific cytotoxic activity against B16-F10 melanoma cells, whereas NK-cell clones and double negative T-cell clones demonstrated only non-specific cytotoxic activity against NK-sensitive YAC-1 cells. NK-like CD8 (+) T-cell clones showed dual cytotoxic activity. Clones T1 [a CD8 (+) T-cell clone] and T2 [an NK-like CD8 (+) T-cell clone] which had cytotoxic activity against B16-F10 melanoma cells, demonstrated a proliferative response against immunoblotted B16-F10 melanoma antigens, whereas clones T7 (an NK-cell clone) and T10 (a double negative T-cell clone), which had no cytotoxic activity against B16-F10 cells, demonstrated no proliferative response against them. Winn assays revealed that only the CD8 (+) T-cell clone (T1) had an antitumor effect in vivo, whereas the double negative T-cell clone (T10) and NK-like CD8 (+) T-cell clone (T2) stimulated tumor growth in vivo. Adoptive immunotherapy using tumor-specific, highly cytotoxic TIL clones may represent a useful future immunotherapeutic option for the treatment of human tumors. 
Symptomatic cerebral vasospasm following tumor resection: report of two cases. The authors report two cases of symptomatic cerebral vasospasm following resection of an acoustic neuroma and a left sphenoid wing meningioma. Vascular spasm was documented by transcranial Doppler and angiography studies. Both patients responded to hypervolemic therapy. Possible mechanisms contributing to this rare complication are discussed. 
Colonic epithelial dysplasia or carcinoma in a regional group of patients with ulcerative colitis of more than 15 years duration. Colonoscopic screening for neoplasia was performed in a regional group of ulcerative colitis patients with a disease duration of greater than or equal to 15 years. A total of 121 patients, aged less than 80 years, were invited to participate, of whom 100 (83%) accepted colonoscopy, including biopsies in 15 standard locations of the entire colon, plus additional biopsies from all visible lesions. Unequivocal dysplasia was found in one patient with extensive colitis and a disease duration of 31 years. A polyp with highly differentiated adenocarcinoma was found in the sigmoid colon of a patient with intermittent rectum involvement, 37 years after the ulcerative colitis diagnosis had been made. Biopsy specimens from the remaining 98 patients showed no signs of dysplasia or cancer. Thus the frequency of pre-malignant or malignant changes is very low compared with the results of similar studies, and the rationale for general colonoscopic surveillance programmes for such patients is open to question. 
The role of alkaline phosphatase isoenzymes as tumor markers for testicular germ cell tumors. The role of serum alkaline phosphatase as a tumor marker for testicular germ cell disease was investigated in 26 patients with testicular seminoma and 13 with nonseminomatous germ cell testis tumors. Placental alkaline phosphatase-like enzyme was elevated in 50% of the stage I seminoma patients and in all patients with stages II to III disease. In addition, liver (tissue unspecific) alkaline phosphatase was elevated in 10 and 83% of the patients, respectively. Lactic dehydrogenase and beta-human chorionic gonadotropin (beta-HCG) were detected in 50 to 60% of the patients with stage I seminoma. By combining placental alkaline phosphatase-like enzyme, lactic dehydrogenase and beta-HCG, 75% of the stage I and 100% of the stages II and III seminoma patients could be identified correctly. Placental alkaline phosphatase-like enzyme in serum also occurred with nonseminomatous germ cell tumor but less frequently, while liver alkaline phosphatase was not detected at all. Thus, placental alkaline phosphatase-like enzyme and liver alkaline phosphatase were predominantly determined in the serum of patients with seminoma. In studies of tumor tissues from 31 of these patients, those with normal serum placental alkaline phosphatase-like enzyme levels had significantly lower tissue placental alkaline phosphatase-like enzyme levels than patients with elevated serum levels (p less than 0.01). Seminoma tissues showed significantly higher levels of placental alkaline phosphatase-like enzyme and liver alkaline phosphatase than nonseminomatous germ cell tumors (p less than 0.01), explaining the infrequent elevation of serum placental alkaline phosphatase-like enzyme and liver alkaline phosphatase found in patients with nonseminomatous germ cell tumors. 
Hepatitis B virus DNA in cervicovaginal cells. Hepatitis B virus DNA sequences were detected in seven (12.1%) of 58 cervicovaginal cell specimens that were obtained from pregnant women by polymerase DNA amplification assay. The presence of hepatitis B virus DNA in these cells raises the possibility that infected cervicovaginal cells may be a source through which hepatitis B virus can be transmitted from infected mothers to their newborns and between heterosexual partners. 
Noninvasive determination of left ventricular output and wall stress in volume overload and in myocardial disease by cine magnetic resonance imaging. The current study used cine magnetic resonance imaging to determine the effect of increasing severity of valvular regurgitation on systolic wall stress and to demonstrate that wall stress was disproportionately increased in relation to the severity of regurgitation in patients with myocardial disease. A total of 39 patients with predominantly mitral (n = 22) or aortic (n = 17) regurgitation with (n = 13) and without (n = 26) myocardial disease and 10 normal volunteers were examined with cine magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) at 1.5 T. Left ventricular (LV) cardiac output (CO) and peak systolic (PS) wall stress (WS) and end-systolic (ES) WS were calculated from blood pressure recordings, carotid pulse tracings, and wall thickness (h) and diameter (D) measurements obtained from cine MRI. Patients were classified into three degrees of severity according to their LV regurgitant volume (RV). Myocardial disease was defined by an ejection fraction (EF) of less than 40%. Mean LV EF was 61 +/- 3% in normal volunteers, 64 +/- 3% in patients with regurgitation, and 25 +/- 2% in patients with myocardial disease. LV CO was directly related to RV in patients without myocardial disease, whereas it was disproportionately low in relation to RV in patients with myocardial disease. PS WS was significantly higher in severe mitral and/or aortic regurgitation compared with moderate, mild, and no mitral and/or aortic regurgitation. Compared with the degree of regurgitation, PS WS was disproportionately higher in patients with myocardial disease. Thus LV CO and WS rise progressively with increasing severity of regurgitation. Disproportionately high systolic WS relative to RV indicates the presence of myocardial disease. 
QRS interval fails to predict coronary disease incidence. The Framingham Study. The Framingham Study cohort of 5209 white men and women was examined to determine the long-term incidence of manifestations of new coronary heart disease as a function of QRS interval on subjects' baseline electrocardiograms (recorded at the 9th biennial examination). Over 18 years of follow-up, age-adjusted incidence of myocardial infarction, angina pectoris, and coronary death appeared unrelated to baseline QRS prolongation in both sexes, by Cox regression. Subjects with left bundle-branch block fared no worse than those with right pattern. These relations held whether or not subjects with baseline electrocardiographic abnormalities other than intraventricular block were excluded from consideration. In sum, QRS duration is an unimportant predictor of coronary disease in this Framingham population. 
Membranous nephropathy related to hepatitis B virus in adults. BACKGROUND. The natural course of adult hepatitis B virus (HBV)-related membranous nephropathy in areas where HBV infection is endemic (characterized by vertical and horizontal transmission of HBV in early childhood) has not been fully defined. METHODS. We evaluated the clinical features, pathological findings, serologic profiles, therapeutic responses, and prognoses of 21 patients with adult-onset HBV-related membranous nephropathy. The patients were followed for a mean of 60 months (range, 12 to 108). Only patients with evidence of glomerular capillary deposition of hepatitis B e antigen (HBeAg) in a renal-biopsy specimen were included. RESULTS. The clinical features and serologic studies suggested that the patients had acquired chronic HBV infection in early childhood; moreover, other causes of membranous nephropathy had been excluded. All were seropositive for hepatitis B surface antigen and had high titers of antibody to hepatitis B core antigen at first clinical presentation. HBeAg was detected in the serum of 17 patients (81 percent), yet only 3 had even slightly increased plasma alanine aminotransferase levels. The clinical response to therapy with interferon alfa was disappointing; only one of the five patients treated had a complete remission with seroconversion to antibody to HBeAg. Contrary to reports of studies in children, spontaneous remission of the nephrotic syndrome or proteinuria was uncommon in the adults with HBV-related membranous nephropathy whom we studied. Proteinuria and HBV antigenemia persisted in untreated patients. During the follow-up period, 29 percent of the patients had progressive renal failure and 10 percent required maintenance dialysis therapy. CONCLUSIONS. The course of HBV-related membranous nephropathy in adults in areas where HBV is endemic is not benign. Regardless of treatment, the disease has a slowly but relentlessly progressive clinical course in approximately one third of patients. 
Once-daily fosinopril in the treatment of hypertension. This multicenter, dose-ranging study evaluated the antihypertensive effectiveness of once-daily administration of fosinopril sodium in 220 patients with supine diastolic blood pressure of 95-115 mm Hg. After a 4-week placebo period, patients were randomly assigned to double-blind therapy with either placebo or 10, 40, or 80 mg fosinopril once daily for 4 weeks. If treatment goals were not met, chlorthalidone 25 mg/day was added for weeks 5 to 8. Thereafter, patients could enter the long-term, open-label phase and receive 10-80 mg/day fosinopril plus chlorthalidone, if needed. After 4 weeks of monotherapy, the average decreases in supine diastolic blood pressure were 9% (10 mg), 11.5% (40 mg), and 12.5% (80 mg) compared with 6% in the placebo group. After 8 weeks, the average decreases, with or without diuretic therapy, were 12.5-18.2%, compared with 10.8% with placebo. Blood pressure continued to be well controlled, and the patients showed no evidence of tachyphylaxis or tolerance through 12-15 months of treatment. Fosinopril was well tolerated. During the short-term phase, no patient withdrew because of adverse events possibly related to fosinopril; during the long-term phase, nine of 148 patients (6.1%) withdrew for that reason. In patients with mild-to-moderate hypertension, once-daily fosinopril (40 and 80 mg) provided significant antihypertensive effects with or without diuretic therapy. The 10 mg dose was effective in some patients and may be considered a starting dose. 
The management of IIB osteosarcoma. Experience from 1976 to 1985. From 1976 to 1985, 75 IIB osteosarcomas have been treated out of a total of 98 osteosarcomas at the authors' institution. Because of the effective chemotherapy including high-dose methotrexate administered during this time period, the surgical management changed, and only ten patients out of the 75 IIB osteosarcomas required an amputation. The overall result of 76.7% of disease-free, three-year survival was equally distributed regardless of the surgical procedure. Endoprosthesis, resection with or without grafts, and rotationplasties, as well as amputations, revealed similar results. No negative influence from the limb-sparing surgery could be observed. 
Appendicitis in cystic fibrosis. Appendicitis is said to be uncommon and difficult to diagnose in cystic fibrosis. The clinical and radiological features in nine patients with cystic fibrosis who had appendicitis were studied. All but one of the patients had an appendiceal abscess at surgery. Four patients had a delay in diagnosis of greater than three days before the correct diagnosis was made. This delay may have been due to a more indolent presentation or because these patients were initially considered to have distal intestinal obstruction syndrome. Appendicitis should be considered in the differential diagnosis if a contrast enema demonstrates extrinsic compression of the caecum. Ultrasound, computed tomography, and gallium scans were found to be of limited help in our series. 
Dietary omega-3 fatty acids decrease mortality and Kupffer cell prostaglandin E2 production in a rat model of chronic sepsis. We tested the hypothesis that substitution of omega-3 fat for dietary omega-6 fat would reduce mortality and decrease Kupffer cell prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) production in a rat model of chronic sepsis. Rats were fed via gastrostomy for 12 days with isonitrogenous, isocaloric diets containing 15% of calories as either safflower oil (omega-6) or a 10:1 mixture of menhaden oil (omega-3) and safflower oil. After five days of feeding, animals received an intra-abdominal abscess of defined bacterial content. Survivors were killed on post-laparotomy day 6 in conjunction with liver perfusion and protease liver digestion for Kupffer cell isolation. Kupffer cell PGE2 production was measured by radioimmunoassay after 18 hours of cell culture and again after stimulation with 0 LPS, 10 ng/ml LPS, and 10 micrograms/LPS. Mortality was decreased in menhaden oil-fed animals compared with safflower oil-fed animals (16% vs. 35%). Kupffer cell PGE2 production was decreased in menhaden oil-fed animals at 18 hours (354 +/- 54 vs. 570 +/- 95 pg/0.1 ml; p = 0.09) and after stimulation with 10 micrograms/ml LPS (140 +/- 41 vs. 288 +/- 45 pg/0.1 ml; p = 0.03) compared with safflower oil-fed animals. 
Abdominal desmoids: CT findings in 25 patients. Desmoids are histologically benign but locally aggressive fibrous tumors. Although overall they are rare lesions, they are a common manifestation of Gardner syndrome. We retrospectively reviewed clinical records and CT scans of 25 patients with abdominal desmoids. The number, location, and CT characteristics of the lesions were recorded for each patient. Tumors were solitary in 72% of patients and multiple in 28%. Fifty percent were located in the abdominal wall, 41% in the mesentery, and 9% in the retroperitoneum. More than two thirds of the lesions had well-defined borders, with the remainder displaying an infiltrative outer margin. The majority of tumors had attenuation values equal to (47%) or greater than (41%) the attenuation of muscle on contrast-enhanced CT scans. Complications attributable to the desmoid were commonly detectable on CT (hydronephrosis occurred in 36% and small-bowel obstruction in 20%). Our results detail the spectrum of CT findings and complications caused by abdominal desmoids. 
Adrenaline injection for endoscopic haemostasis in non-variceal upper gastrointestinal haemorrhage. Over a 30-month period, 53 patients with actively bleeding non-variceal lesions of the oesophagus, stomach or duodenum were treated by endoscopic injection of 1/10,000 adrenaline. Initial haemostasis was obtained in 50 cases, and permanent haemostasis in 44. Emergency surgery for bleeding was required in nine patients overall, and there were four deaths. All lesions requiring surgery were located on the posterior wall of the duodenum or the lesser curve of the stomach, and all but one had evidence of an exposed arterial vessel. Adrenaline injection is an effective, safe and simple method of endoscopic haemostasis. 
Professional mammographic quality assessment program for a community hospital. The evaluation of mammographic interpretations is a difficult challenge for a professional quality assessment program. As most images are read by a single observer and pathologic proof is obtained only if prompted by the report or if clinical symptoms warrant surgical intervention, it is difficult to construct a meaningful quality assessment program. The authors designed a program on the basis of a mammographic coding system that allows both individual physicians and practice groups to be evaluated. The program examines mammographic reports to determine the consistency of reporting by each physician and by the entire group. In addition, the program facilitated periodic evaluation of physicians with use of test cases. The coding system provided an easy method of correlating the mammographic reports with pathology reports from biopsy specimens, allowing a more thorough examination of possible systematic errors in the evaluation of the examinations, as well as enabling calculation of the positive predictive value for the diagnosis of cancer. The professional quality assessment program can be easily implemented in a busy clinical setting to evaluate whether mammograms were read consistently and "correctly" and to provide a method of continuing education for the physicians. 
Malignant fibrous histiocytoma of the gastrointestinal tract in a patient with neurofibromatosis. Malignant fibrous histiocytoma (MFH) of the gastrointestinal tract is extremely rare. A case of MFH of the colon associated with neurofibromatosis is presented. MFH is a high-grade soft-tissue sarcoma of fibroblast cell origin with a strong propensity for metastasis and recurrence. Immunochemical markers help to differentiate MFH from other sarcomas. The most successful treatment of MFH is surgical extirpation. Adjuvant chemotherapy and radiotherapy have not been definitively shown to be of value. 
Clinical follow-up and progression of carotid atherosclerosis determined by duplex scanning in patients suffering from TIA. We investigated the clinical outcomes and the progression of the internal carotid arterial lesions of a group of patients presenting with hemispheric TIAs. The cumulative frequency of TIAs during a mean follow-up period of 40 +/- 14 months was 14%, and no relationship was found between new TIAs and the presence of known cardiovascular risk factors or plaque characteristics as determined by duplex scanning. With the exception of one patient who died of stroke, none of the patients developed a permanent neurologic deficit. The cumulative death rate was 6.5%; myocardial infarction was the most common cause (3 out of 7). Anatomic progression of plaques was determined by duplex scanning in 22% of the internal carotid arteries. No relationship between progression of these plaques and the development of new TIAs was evident. We conclude that, in this group of patients, TIAs do not inevitably lead to stroke and that TIAs are not predictable based on risk factors or plaques characteristics. 
Limb salvage surgery for bone and soft tissue sarcoma. A phase II pathologic study of preoperative intraarterial cisplatin. Preoperative therapy has been tested as part of limb salvage therapy for localized bone and soft tissue sarcoma of the extremities. The activity of cisplatin (CDDP) by intraarterial (IA) infusion was evaluated in 40 cases of which 36 were evaluable for response. All patients had high-grade sarcomas. All but 3 patients received 3 or 4 courses (24 patients received 4 courses) of CDDP at a dosage of 120 to 150 mg/m2 given over 6 hours every 2 weeks by IA infusion. Patients younger than 18 years of age received the higher dose of CDDP. Treatment was well tolerated with combination antiemetics. One patient experienced severe hearing loss with the first cycle of the higher CDDP dose. Pathologic evaluation of resected osteosarcoma showed a favorable response (90% or greater necrosis) in 8 of 20 evaluable cases and in 3 of 4 patients with malignant fibrous histiocytoma (MFH) of bone (without osteoid). In soft tissue sarcomas, minimal (50% to 89%) necrosis was seen in two of nine cases and none had 90% or greater necrosis. Patients received postoperative chemotherapy based on pathologic response, but the value of this postoperative adjuvant therapy requires further follow-up and is uncertain in this small study. IA CDDP can often cause significant tumor necrosis in patients with bone sarcomas, whereas soft tissue sarcomas are less sensitive to this therapy. 
Importance of experimental models for the development of clinical trials on thromboatherosclerosis. Experimental models of vascular injury have enhanced our understanding of the pathophysiological process leading to vascular obstruction in both spontaneous and accelerated atherosclerosis. Based on experimental findings, we present and discuss a pathological classification of vascular injury or damage and its role in the pathogenesis of various vascular diseases. In addition, these animal models have provided insights into the roles of platelets and lipid metabolism in the evolution and progression of atherosclerosis and have suggested potential therapeutic applications. Thus, based on studies in the pig models, antiplatelet agents have been shown for the first time to have a beneficial effect in preventing the formation and progression of coronary atherosclerotic lesions in humans. Similarly, our findings in high density lipoprotein plasma fractions regarding inhibition and even reversal of the process of atherosclerosis in a hypercholesterolemic rabbit model have added new insights to an explosive field of lipoprotein research and provided new avenues of therapeutic strategies. our in vivo and ex vivo pig models of an extracorporeal perfusion chamber mimicking the various coronary conditions have aided in the understanding of the pathophysiology of the acute coronary syndromes and intensified our search for the ideal antithrombotic regimen in these high-risk patients. Finally, a carotid pig model of balloon angioplasty, a dog model of saphenous vein grafting, and a pig model of heart transplantation not only have provided insights into the pathophysiological process of accelerated atherosclerosis but also are allowing development of new antithrombotic and antiproliferative approaches for the prevention of these accelerated vascular diseases. In summary, we are entering an exciting era in vascular research. Significant advances in our understanding of vascular injury or damage as well as the interactions of blood cells and lipids with the vascular wall have allowed us to formulate new experimental strategies with subsequent clinical application in the prevention and progression of these vascular diseases. 
Endogenous opiates modulate the postapnea ventilatory response in the obstructive sleep apnea syndrome. Defense of ventilatory homeostasis against recurrent hypercapnia, hypoxia, and acidosis resulting from apnea in obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (OSAS) is dependent on compensatory mechanisms operative between episodes of airway obstruction. This investigation was designed to examine whether endogenous opiate activity modulates the compensatory ventilatory response to apnea in OSAS. Polysomnography and quantitative measurement of tidal volume was performed in 12 patients with moderate to severe OSAS during a morning nap study before and after intravenous administration of 10 mg of naloxone. Apnea index was not significantly altered. There was a small but significant shortening of apneas (postnaloxone apnea duration, 91.2% of prenaloxone; p = 0.002 by ANOVA). Tidal volume of the first postapnea breath and minute ventilation extrapolated from the first two postapnea breaths, but not frequency, increased significantly after naloxone (postnaloxone first breath volume, 112.7% of prenaloxone value [p = 0.03], with a similar increase for minute ventilation, 115.1% [p = 0.007]). The volume of the first postapnea breath was correlated with the duration of the previous apnea, both before (r = 0.59, p = 0.0001) and after naloxone. Despite this, analysis of covariance with apnea duration as the covariate confirmed a significant independent increase in postapnea breath volume after naloxone (p = 0.001). Naloxone also altered sleep architecture, increasing percent time awake during the study period (prenaloxone, 36.3 +/- 15.6%; postnaloxone, 56.7 +/- 22.4%; p = 0.0003) and decreasing total sleep time and percent time in Stage 1. Furthermore, naloxone increased continuity of awake periods (mean length of awake periods increased from 27.0 +/- 8.4 to 66.0 +/- 66.6 s after naloxone, p = 0.05). 
Radiographic fallopian tube recanalization: absorbed ovarian radiation dose. Absorbed radiation dose to the ovaries during radiographic fallopian tube recanalization was estimated in 29 patients with use of thermoluminescent dosimeters placed in the vaginal fornix. With an average fluoroscopic time of 8.5 minutes +/- 5.5 and an average of 14 +/- 5 105-mm spot radiographs obtained, the average absorbed dose to the ovaries was 8.5 mGy +/- 5.6 (0.85 rad +/- 0.56). Technical guidelines for keeping patient radiation exposure to a minimum during this new interventional procedure are suggested. 
Patterns of failure in Hancock pericardial bioprostheses. A series of Hancock pericardial valve bioprostheses was reviewed for cases of primary valve failure. Thirteen mitral and 10 aortic valve explants were recovered from 21 adult patients. Mitral valves had been in place for a mean of 56.4 months, and aortic valves for 53.8 months. All valves failed with cusp tears from stents (with a mean of 1.7 for mitral valves and 2.6 for aortic valves) in a predictable pattern, suggesting that wear and stress at cusp stitch sites are important in their pathogenesis. The topography of these tears is illustrated as are the less common associates of primary failure, such as calcification, fibrosis, and thrombosis. Similarities and differences of this valve's failure compared with that of the Ionescu-Shiley pericardial valve are discussed. 
Left bronchial isomerism associated with bronchomalacia, presenting with intractable wheeze. The cause of the Williams Campbell syndrome (bronchomalacia with bronchiectasis) is controversial. A boy with bronchomalacia, bifid ribs, and left bronchial isomerism presented with intractable wheeze mimicking asthma. The combination of the abdominal, bronchial, and atrial anatomy seen in this child has been described only once previously. The coexistence of these congenital abnormalities in this boy supports a congenital cause for the Williams Campbell syndrome. The need to assess wheezy children critically is emphasised. 
Rapid thrombus dissolution by continuous infusion of urokinase through an intracoronary perfusion wire prior to and following PTCA: results in native coronaries and patent saphenous vein grafts. Even with aspirin and heparin therapy, thrombus present prior to or forming after percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA) results in significant complications. We report on 33 patients who were treated with continuous infusion of Urokinase through an intracoronary perfusion wire for 24 hr because of visible intracoronary thrombus. Seventeen native vessels (9 pre-PTCA and 8 post-PTCA) and sixteen saphenous vein grafts (12 pre-PTCA and 4 post-PTCA) were treated. All vessels were patent at the time of perfusion wire placement. Complete thrombus resolution, successful PTCA and sustained patency was seen in 31 of 33 patients. One native vessel treated post PTCA (originally occluded) re-occluded. One saphenous vein graft treated prior to PTCA showed improvement in thrombus but distal embolization with balloon inflation occurred. No significant complications related to the intracoronary infusion technique were observed. In conclusion, rapid lysis of intra-coronary thrombus can be accomplish safely using this technique and can result in improved PTCA outcome. 
Surgical treatment of the Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome by epicardial electrical ablation A new operation to eliminate accessory pathways--epicardial electrical ablation--is described. In a group of 201 patients without concomitant disease, the mortality rate was 0.5% and the overall efficacy of the operation for free wall accessory pathways, 98%. A retrospective clinical study of 44 unselected patients was performed to examine how safe epicardial electrical ablation is. The criteria for intraoperative effectiveness were disappearance of both the delta wave and retrograde conduction and inability to induce tachycardia. In the postoperative and follow-up periods, the following were reviewed: electrocardiograms; Holter monitor recordings (24 to 26 hours); release of the myocardial-specific isoenzyme of creatine kinase; intracardiac hemodynamics and myocardial contractility (radionuclide methods); selective coronary arteriograms and ventriculograms; mean work capacity (bicycle ergometer); diagnostic transesophageal electrical stimulation; and histology of the area of ablation. The main conclusion of this study is that epicardial electrical ablation is a highly efficient and safe operation for surgical elimination of parietal accessory pathways in patients with Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome. Its advantages are its technical simplicity and the opportunity to review results immediately during the operation. 
Relationship between insulin sensitivity, insulin secretion and glucose tolerance in cirrhosis. Hepatic insulin extraction is difficult to measure in humans; as a result, the interrelationship between defective insulin secretion and insulin insensitivity in the pathogenesis of glucose intolerance in cirrhosis remains unclear. To reassess this we used recombinant human C-peptide to measure C-peptide clearance in cirrhotic patients and controls and thus derive C-peptide and insulin secretion rates after a 75-gm oral glucose load and during a 10 mmol/L hyperglycemic clamp. Cirrhotic patients were confirmed as insulin-insensitive during a euglycemic clamp (glucose requirement: 4.1 +/- 0.1 mg/kg/min vs. 8.1 +/- 0.5 mg/kg/min; p less than 0.001), which also demonstrated a low insulin metabolic clearance rate (p less than 0.001). Although intolerant after oral glucose, the cirrhotic patients had glucose requirements identical to those of controls during the hyperglycemic clamp (cirrhotic patients: 6.1 +/- 1.0 mg/kg/min; controls: 6.3 +/- 0.7 mg/kg/min), suggesting normal intravenous glucose tolerance. C-peptide MCR was identical in cirrhotic patients (2.93 +/- 0.16 ml/min/kg) and controls (2.96 +/- 0.24 ml/min/kg). Insulin secretion was higher in cirrhotic patients, both fasting (2.13 +/- 0.26 U/hr vs. 1.09 +/- 0.10 U/hr; p less than 0.001) and from min 30 to 90 of the hyperglycemic clamp (5.22 +/- 0.70 U/hr vs. 2.85 +/- 0.22 U/hr; p less than 0.001). However, with oral glucose the rise in serum C-peptide concentration was relatively delayed, and the insulin secretion index (secretion/area under 3-hr glucose curve) was not elevated. Hepatic insulin extraction was reduced both in fasting and during the hyperglycemic clamp (p less than 0.001). 
Platelet-activating factor in stroke and brain injury. Platelet-activating factor, an endogenous phospholipid of proinflammatory, hemostatic, and vasoactive properties, is synthesized by neurons and in injured brain. Platelet-activating factor is released together with eicosanoids such as thromboxane A2, prostacyclin, and leukotrienes. Its effects in neurons are mediated through a specific receptor coupled to phospholipase C and phosphoinositol metabolism. The cerebrovascular effects of platelet-activating factor include disruption of the blood-brain barrier, edema formation, and vasospasm. It has also been described to possess direct toxicity to neuronal cells in culture. Discovery and development of several highly potent and selective antagonists to platelet-activating factor receptors facilitated experimental studies underscoring the role of this factor as an endogenous mediator in cerebral disorders, particularly cerebral ischemia and trauma. Significant biochemical, microvascular, functional, and behavioral recovery has been demonstrated using these antagonists in an array of experimental models of focal and global ischemia in the central nervous system (CNS). Clearly, studies of platelet-activating factor in experimental models of CNS ischemia and reperfusion injury open a new perspective on phospholipid metabolism in stroke and offer an exceptionally promising therapeutic prospect. Data supporting this factor as a mediator of specific pathological sequelae in stroke and neuroinjury are surveyed in this review. We discuss the mechanisms and significance of platelet-activating factor-mediated effects and propose directions for future studies. 
Hypertension as a causative diagnosis of patients entering end-stage renal disease programs in the United States from 1980 to 1986. Treatment of hypertension has decreased the incidence of stroke and congestive heart failure consequential to hypertension. To determine whether the incidence of hypertension as a causative diagnosis of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) is also decreasing, we examined the records of the Health Care Financing Administration (HCFA) from 1980 to 1986 regarding the causative diagnoses of patients entering ESRD programs. We found that the incidence of patients entering ESRD programs increased during the study period. Hypertension as a causative diagnosis was a constant proportion of the increase. The greatest increase occurred in patients age 55 or more years. This was strikingly true of black patients. We conclude that there has not been a decrease in the incidence of hypertension as a causative diagnosis for patients entering ESRD programs and that this may be a reflection that treatment of hypertension does not prevent the development of ESRD in some patients. We propose that prospective studies be undertaken to determine whether this is the case. 
Hyperthyroidism due to a pituitary adenoma composed of two different cell types, one secreting alpha-subunit alone and another cosecreting alpha-subunit and thyrotropin. A 37-yr-old female presented with clinical signs and symptoms of mild hyperthyroidism, high serum levels of free T4 (24.2 pmol/L), free T3 (11.7 pmol/L), and sex hormone-binding globulin (157 nmol/L) as well as measurable (by immunofluorometric assay) serum TSH concentrations (1.9 mU/L) in the absence of any known methodological interference. The above finding indicated the presence of hyperthyroidism due to inappropriate secretion of TSH, whose neoplastic origin was documented by computed tomographic scan showing a 1-cm pituitary adenoma. The diagnosis was confirmed by elevated alpha-subunit levels (9.2 micrograms/L) and alpha-subunit/TSH molar ratio (25.2) as well as absent TSH suppression after T3 administration. TRH injection (200 microgram, iv) caused impaired TSH (from 3.0 to 4.8 mU/L) and unexpectedly exaggerated alpha-subunit (from 8.8 to 18.2 micrograms/L) responses. Such a discrepancy was also observed after other dynamic tests. Double gold particle immunostaining of the adenomatous tissue removed at surgery showed that all of the cells contained secretory granules positive for alpha-subunit, while very few cells were positive for TSH beta and alpha-subunit. In conclusion, the present study demonstrates the existence of TSH-induced hyperthyroidism due to a pituitary adenoma composed of two different cell types: one secreting alpha-subunit alone and another cosecreting alpha-subunit and TSH. 
Evaluation of valvular heart disease with cine gradient echo magnetic resonance imaging. Electrocardiographic referenced repetitive gradient echo magnetic resonance imaging (cine GRE) has been used to detect and quantify valvular regurgitation. Regurgitation is recognized as a signal void in the high intensity blood pool on these images. Mitral regurgitation causes a signal void in the left atrium in systole, and aortic regurgitation produces one in the left ventricle in diastole. The specificity, sensitivity, and diagnostic accuracy of cine GRE for the detection of mitral and aortic regurgitation was greater than 0.93, 0.89, and 0.92, respectively. The severity of regurgitation has been quantified as the difference in the stroke volume between the two ventricles by measuring the volume of the blood pool, as shown in the stack of magnetic resonance tomograms. Severity has also been assessed by measuring the volume of the signal void. Finally, measurements of the volume of aortic regurgitation have recently been achieved by using velocity-encoded cine GRE. This technique provides a direct measurement of retrograde flow in the aorta during diastole. New cine GRE imaging techniques provide a noninvasive means for quantification of valvular as well as ventricular function. 
Cerebral haemorrhage in a French prospective population study. The incidence of cerebral haemorrhage was studied from a population-based stroke registry. The incidence was 12.3 per 100,000 per year in women and 13.9 per 100,000 per year in men, with a peak in the eighth decade and a male preponderance. Haemorrhages were deep seated and mostly due to hypertension. Recognised clinical characteristics of haemorrhage are acute onset, convulsion, vomiting, and disturbed consciousness. This study showed that cerebral haemorrhage may present with pure motor deficit or transient deficit preceding the stroke. The mortality was 51% in the first month, and 61% by two years. 
Cellular intermediate filament networks and their derangement in alcoholic hepatitis. Intermediate filaments are major components of most eukaryotic cells that form from the polymerization of protein subunits that are expressed in tissue and development specific fashions. The interactions of intermediate filaments with a myriad of other cellular proteins and structures give rise to a complex overall cellular architecture that is likely responsible for cellular well-being. The mature 10-nm filaments are relatively stable cellular structures, but the intermediate filaments undergo major morphological and biochemical changes, especially during mitosis, differentiation, and in response to certain drugs. Evidence exists that hepatocyte intermediate filaments (keratin filaments) are deranged in alcoholic hepatitis, an inflammatory liver disease of alcoholics and heavy spree drinkers. The classical and characteristic pathological hepatocyte inclusion bodies of alcoholic hepatitis, Mallory bodies, are composed in part of normal keratins that likely derive from the pre-existing hepatocyte intermediate filament network. It is unclear if intermediate filament network derangement in alcoholic hepatitis is directly caused by the actions of ethanol or its metabolites on intermediate filaments or their associated structures, or whether alcohol causes a cellular insult or injury elsewhere and a subsequent response (e.g., immune) causes intermediate filament network derangement. The precise mechanisms responsible for intermediate filament derangement remain to be elucidated; however, experimental data exist that support and refute several hypotheses. Hopefully, further studies will help determine a better overall understanding of the abnormalities of intermediate filaments and their relationship to the pathophysiology of alcoholic hepatitis and other diseases. 
Pleuropulmonary complications of endoscopic variceal sclerotherapy. The most common pulmonary complication of EVS is pleural effusion. The most clinically significant pulmonary complication of EVS is delayed perforation with formation of esophagopleural or esophagobronchial fistula. Pneumonia, empyema, pulmonary infarction, and atelectasis can also occur. Endoscopic variceal sclerotherapy probably does not cause ARDS, but that issue remains unsettled. Transient relative pulmonary hypertension during EVS is probably of no clinical significance, but caution is urged when sclerosing varices in a patient with borderline right heart function. 
An unusual problem during surgical removal of a broken guidewire. At operation, it proved impossible using traction alone to remove an angioplasty guidewire that was lodged in an intermediate artery. The problem was solved by passing a Teflon catheter over the wire, thus protecting the left main coronary artery while freeing the entrapped distal end of the guidewire. 
Delayed sternal closure for life-threatening complications in cardiac operations: an update. Over a 7-year-period, 25 patients had delayed sternal closure after open heart operations out of 34 patients whose sternum was not closed. The indications were extreme cardiac dilatation and uncontrollable mediastinal hemorrhage. This represented a 1.79% incidence in the overall open heart surgical experience at our unit. Sternal closure was performed at a mean of 2.64 days after the initial operation. Eighteen patients (52.9%) left the hospital alive and well, representing a 72% survival rate among patients undergoing delayed sternal closure. No mediastinal or fatal infection developed and only 1 patient had late superficial wound infection after delayed sternal closure. We conclude that delayed sternal closure is an effective method to treat severe complications after cardiac operations. 
Brain tumors occurring before 1 year of age: a retrospective reviews of 22 cases in an 11-year period (1977-1987). Congenital brain tumors have been reported infrequently and their management remains ill defined. An 11-year review (1977-1987) of all children with brain tumors with the onset of symptoms before 1 year of age was completed. Twenty-two children with the following histological diagnoses were treated: astrocytoma (7 patients), primitive neuroectodermal tumor (6 patients), papilloma or carcinoma of the choroid plexus (3 patients), malignant teratoma (2 patients), dermoid tumor (2 patients), embryonal rhabdomyosarcoma (1 patient), and chloroma (1 patient). Fifteen tumors were supratentorial in location, and 7 were infratentorial. Initial symptoms were hydrocephalus (32%), focal neurological deficit (23%), asymptomatic increase in head circumference (18%), failure to thrive (14%), and seizures (4.5%). The goal of treatment was a radical excision when possible, with primary chemotherapy in the last 6 years of the review period. Radiation therapy was the adjunct to surgery in the initial 5-year period. All patients with papillomas of the choroid plexus and dermoid lesions underwent a total resection with no recurrence. All 7 astrocytomas were supratentorial, with 6 occurring in the diencephalon. Five of the seven patients with astrocytomas survived more than 5 years. The 6 primitive neuroectodermal tumors were located equally between the supra- and infratentorial spaces. Four of the 6 infants with these tumors received chemotherapy (2 received chemotherapy alone; 2 received chemotherapy and radiation therapy) and are tumor free 2 to 9 years later. A fifth child received radiation therapy alone early in the series and survived only 4 months. The family of the other child refused adjunctive treatment. 
Bleeding esophagogastric varices. Ways to treat active episodes and prevent recurrence. Bleeding from esophagogastric varices carries a high mortality rate. Active variceal bleeding can usually be temporarily controlled medically with a combination of intravenous vasopressin and nitroglycerin, with balloon tamponade, or with endoscopic sclerotherapy. Because of the high likelihood of recurrence, long-term treatment, such as repeated sclerotherapy, propranolol therapy, or shunt surgery, is necessary. The proper selection of such measures requires consideration of the site of variceal bleeding, local availability of specialized techniques, and patient factors. Only liver transplantation reverses the liver damage and offers hope of improved long-term survival. As success at identifying high-risk patients by endoscopic features improves, propranolol or other pharmacologic prophylaxis may become an acceptable treatment. 
Nutritional management of inflammatory bowel disease. The etiology and specific treatment of Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis are unknown, and the treatment strategy for patients with inflammatory bowel disease is essentially symptomatic and supportive. The malnutrition that frequently accompanies inflammatory bowel disease is a manifestation of intestinal failure and should be vigorously corrected with total parenteral nutrition, elemental diets, or both. Evidence exists for the value of total parenteral nutrition and elemental diets as primary therapy for inflammatory bowel disease in selected patients. Judicious nutritional therapy remains a cornerstone in the adjunctive management of these patients. 
Aortic distensibility in patients with isolated hypercholesterolaemia, coronary artery disease, or cardiac transplant. The stiffness of the thoracic aorta can be assessed non-invasively. If aortic stiffness can be shown to be related to coronary heart disease, perhaps it can be used to identify which patients with hypercholesterolaemia are most likely to have atheromatous changes and thus to be selected for intensive cholesterol-lowering treatment. Hence the distensibility of the transverse aortic arch was measured by echocardiography of the aortic arch in four groups of patients--symptom-free patients with normal serum cholesterol; symptom-free patients with raised serum cholesterol; patients with coronary heart disease (all with raised serum cholesterol), and post-heart-transplant patients. In all groups distensibility fell with age. The regression slope was steeper (p less than 0.05) for patients with known coronary disease than for either of the disease-free groups, and among cardiac transplant recipients there was also a segregation of distensibility values between those with and without atheroma in their native hearts. The results indicate that aortic distensibility might be an indicator of coronary heart disease and that it might be useful in identifying which symptom-free subjects with modest hypercholesterolaemia should be treated aggressively. 
Interactions between calcium channel blockers and the anticonvulsants carbamazepine and phenytoin. We describe a retrospective analysis of the frequency of adverse interactions between calcium channel blockers and anticonvulsant drugs (phenytoin and carbamazepine) in a series of 43 patients. Ten patients receiving carbamazepine and three patients receiving phenytoin exhibited symptoms or signs of toxicity. Toxicity occurred with both diltiazem and verapamil, but not with nifedipine. These results emphasize the need for careful clinical and laboratory monitoring of patients receiving both classes of medication. 
Unique odontogenic tumor with dentinogenesis and features of unicystic plexiform ameloblastoma. A case of an atypical odontogenic tumor with features of unicystic plexiform ameloblastoma and odontoblastic differentiation with deposition of tubular dentin matrix is reported. The significance of dentinogenesis, amelogenesis, and calcification in odontogenic tumors is discussed. 
Basement-membrane thickening of the vocal cords in sudden infant death syndrome. Sudden infant death syndrome remains the leading cause of death in infants between the ages of 1 month and 1 year. Diagnosis at autopsy is usually reached by process of elimination, as no obvious cause of death is recognized. The larynges of 23 sudden infant death syndrome victims, as well as 6 infants and 3 fetuses who died of other known causes, were examined in this study. While thickening of the basement membrane of the vocal cords was apparent in all sudden infant death syndrome victims, no such finding was present in the larynges of infants and fetuses dying of other causes. Thus, it is suggested that basement-membrane thickening may serve as a diagnostic tool for identification of sudden infant death syndrome at autopsy. 
Case report of laparoscopic cholecystectomy in the third trimester of pregnancy. Laparoscopic cholecystectomy has not been reported during pregnancy. This is the first reported case of a cholecystectomy by laparoscopic technique in the third trimester of pregnancy. The patient (and her baby) had a rapid, uneventful recovery identical to that of a nonpregnant patient. 
Angiography in unstable angina. Within the last decade, it has been appreciated that the acute coronary syndromes of unstable angina, non-Q-wave, and Q-wave myocardial infarction often share a common pathogenesis based on plaque disruption and thrombosis. Such "acute" lesions frequently have a characteristic angiographic appearance with sharp overhanging edges, irregular borders, and intraluminal lucency. This review focuses on the benefits and limitations of qualitative assessment of coronary lesion morphology, with respect to the sensitivity, specificity, and prognostic significance of complex lesions and intracoronary thrombi. Angiographic findings following thrombolysis for unstable angina are discussed, as well as the possible role for thrombolytic therapy as an adjunct to angioplasty in unstable angina. 
High-molecular-weight alkaline phosphatase in serum has properties similar to the enzyme in plasma membranes of the liver. Partially purified high-molecular-weight alkaline phosphatase from serum was compared with two other forms of the enzyme from the human liver, enzyme in native plasma membranes and purified alkaline phosphatase as a hydrophilic dimer. In a high-molecular-weight form from serum and plasma membranes, and when treated with 1% (v/v) Triton X-100, alkaline phosphatase showed a major band on gradient gel electrophoresis with a mobility equivalent to 400 kD. Nondetergent-treated material from both sources did not enter the gel and was in the voided volume of a gel permeation column. Stimulation of catalytic activity by four different phospholipids and by albumin yielded similar results for high-molecular-weight alkaline phosphatase and for the enzyme in plasma membranes, but these were different from the hydrophilic form. Inhibitors of alkaline phosphatase had similar effects on all forms. Of the three forms of the enzyme, only the hydrophilic dimer did not become incorporated into liposomes or adsorb to octyl-Sepharose after solubilization with Triton X-100 and removal of the detergent. Km (substrate concentration to give half maximal velocity) values with p-nitrophenylphosphate and heat and sodium dodecyl sulfate stabilities were similar for all forms. In the high-molecular-weight form from serum and in plasma membranes, alkaline phosphatase and 5'-nucleotidase showed similar rates of release by phosphatidylinositol phospholipase C. Three preparations of phospholipase D failed to release alkaline phosphatase from either the high-molecular-weight form or from plasma membranes. Based on these similarities, it is probable that the complex of high-molecular-weight alkaline phosphatase in serum most often originates from fragments of hepatic plasma membranes. 
Stimulation of a Ca(2+)-dependent protein kinase by GM1 ganglioside in nerve growth factor-treated PC12 cells. We have investigated the ability of exogenous gangliosides to modulate nerve growth factor (NGF) signal transduction in PC12 cells. The effects of exogenous ganglioside GM1 on multiple protein kinase activities were assayed by analyzing site-specific serine phosphorylation of tyrosine hydroxylase (TyrOHase) by two-dimensional phosphopeptide mapping. In the presence of NGF, exogenous GM1 (1-10 microM) increased 32P incorporation into TyrOHase phosphopeptide T2, a Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase substrate whose phosphorylation is not normally affected by NGF treatment. In the absence of NGF, GM1 treatment had no significant effects on TyrOHase phosphorylation. The removal of extracellular Ca2+ or blockade of dihydropyridine-sensitive Ca2+ channels prevented the GM1-induced increases in 32P incorporation into phosphopeptide T2. Exogenous GM1 also potentiated K+ depolarization-induced increases in the phosphorylation of TryOHase. These results suggest that the stimulatory effects of exogenous GM1 ganglioside on NGF actions may be due to its ability to potentiate a Ca(2+)-dependent signaling pathway. 
Colonic hyperproliferation induced in rats and mice by nutritional-stress diets containing four components of a human Western-style diet (series 2). In a previous study colonic hyperplasia and hyperproliferation were induced in mice and rats by a nutritional-stress diet, based on the AIN-76A semisynthetic diet modified to contain four suggested high-risk components of the human Western-style diet: increased fat and phosphate and decreased calcium and vitamin D contents. In this study the effect of raising calcium alone to near the median level (0.22 mg/kcal) and to a high level (1.3 mg/kcal), comparable to adult human dietary intake, was tested in mice and rats while retaining the three other high-risk components. With median calcium intake the nutritional-stress diet induced hyperproliferation of epithelial cells in colonic crypts, with increased numbers of proliferating cells in crypt columns in sigmoid colon of mice (P less than 0.001) and rats (P = 0.02) and in the ascending colon of mice (P = 0.01). With high calcium intake, hyperproliferation was reduced almost to control amounts in the presence of unchanged fat, phosphate, and vitamin D. 
DNA analysis of atrial myxomas. The atrial myxoma is a primary tumor of the heart which may have an uncertain clinical course. In this study, we performed flow cytometric DNA analysis of 15 paraffin-embedded atrial myxomas and correlated DNA ploidy status and proliferative fraction with clinical findings. Twelve of 15 cases (80 percent) were diploid and the remaining three cases (20 percent) were aneuploid. Two patients with aneuploid histograms were free of tumor at the time follow-up; the third patient experienced local tumor recurrence and metastases. Five patients with diploid myxomas demonstrated an elevated (greater than or equal to 17 percent) proliferative cell cycle fraction; four of these patients experienced embolic phenomenon or tumor recurrence. This pilot study suggests that an atrial myxoma with either aneuploid DNA content or elevated proliferative fraction may be associated with aggressive biologic behavior. 
Induction of cytosolic free calcium elevation in rat vascular smooth-muscle cells by cerebrospinal fluid from patients after subarachnoid hemorrhage. The purpose of this study was to determine the effects of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) from patients with subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) on cytosolic free calcium in cultured rat vascular smooth-muscle cells using the fluorescent intracellular calcium indicator fura-2/AM. Samples of CSF were collected from 12 patients (seven with and five without vasospasm) on Days 2, 6, 11, and 16 after SAH. Control CSF samples were obtained from five patients 6 to 9 months after they had undergone successful aneurysm surgery following an SAH. All CSF samples in both the non-vasospasm and vasospasm groups, regardless of the day of sampling after the SAH, induced significantly higher transient intracellular calcium elevations when compared to levels induced by control CSF. Furthermore, the addition of 2 mM ethyleneglycol-bis (beta-aminoethylether)-N,N'-tetra-acetic acid (EGTA) caused a slight reduction in the peak height in the CSF-induced intracellular calcium rise which declined more rapidly to basal levels than those studied without EGTA. In the non-vasospasm group, the intracellular calcium concentration remained stable after SAH throughout the study period. In contrast, in the vasospasm group, this concentration was highest on Day 2 post-SAH, but sharply decreased on Day 6 and rose again on Day 11. This result correlated with the clinical signs of vasospasm in these patients. These findings indicated that the intracellular calcium elevations induced by CSF obtained after SAH were due to the combination of the influx of extracellular calcium and the mobilization of intracellular calcium from storage sites. The changes in intracellular calcium concentrations in vascular smooth-muscle cells induced by CSF obtained from patients on successive days following SAH suggest that the substances that induce this repeat calcium elevation on Day 11 post-SAH may be the key spasmogens for vasospasm after SAH. 
Role of sympathetic activity in blood pressure reduction with low calorie regimen. To investigate the effects of a low calorie regimen on sympathetic function and its relation to blood pressure response, 22 untreated obese essential hypertensive patients (50 +/- 2 years, body mass index 29 +/- 1 kg/m2) were hospitalized and a diet was prescribed of 2,000 kcal/day for 5 days (control period) followed by 800 kcal/day for 21 days without changing salt intake (8-10 g/day). The dose of intravenous phenylephrine infusion needed to elevate systolic blood pressure 20 mm Hg (CD20) and the 24-hour urinary excretion of norepinephrine (UNE) were measured. During the low calorie period, blood pressure normalized in 14 patients (responder group, 124 +/- 3/79 +/- 4 mm Hg) and eight remained hypertensive (poor responder group, 158 +/- 6/103 +/- 3 mm Hg). At the control period, blood pressure and body mass index were similar, but the responder group had higher UNE (134 +/- 15 micrograms/day) and CD20 (127 +/- 11 micrograms) than the poor responder group (89 +/- 6 micrograms/day and 79 +/- 13 micrograms, respectively). During the low calorie period, both UNE (87 +/- 15 micrograms/day) and CD20 (74 +/- 10 micrograms) decreased in the responder group; no change was seen in the poor responder group. Changes in UNE and systolic blood pressure were correlated (r = 0.6, p less than 0.05). In conclusion, suppression of sympathetic activity plays a role in blood pressure reduction during moderate caloric restriction. 
Detection of preclinical Parkinson's disease with PET. Putamen 18F-dopa uptake of patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) is reduced by at least 35% at onset of symptoms; therefore, positron-emission tomography (PET) can be used to detect preclinical disease in clinically unaffected twins and relatives of patients with PD. Three out of 6 monozygotic and 2 out of 3 dizygotic unaffected PD co-twins have shown reduced putamen 18F-dopa uptake to date. In addition, an intact sibling and a daughter of 1 of 4 siblings with PD both had low putamen 18F-dopa uptake. These preliminary findings suggest there may be a familial component to the etiology of PD. PET can also be used to detect underlying nigral pathology in patients with isolated tremor and patients who become rigid taking dopamine-receptor blocking agents (DRBAs). Patients with familial essential tremor have normal, and those with isolated rest tremor have consistently low, putamen 18F-dopa uptake. Drug-induced parkinsonism is infrequently associated with underlying nigral pathology. 
Sudden hearing loss due to AIDS-related cryptococcal meningitis--a temporal bone study. We have presented the clinical history and temporal bone findings in a patient who manifested sudden hearing loss, and who subsequently was found to have cryptococcal meningitis associated with AIDS. The histopathologic findings are similar to earlier reports in patients without AIDS. Because cryptococcal infection is so much more common in AIDS patients than in the general population, it must be considered a causative factor when presented with an AIDS patient with progressive or sudden hearing loss. This offers the patient a chance for timely and effective treatment. 
Pulmonary hypertension and polymorphonuclear leukocyte elastase after esophageal cancer operations. To evaluate the role of polymorphonuclear leukocyte (PMN) elastase in pulmonary impairment occurring after operation for esophageal cancer, 10 patients were randomized preoperatively into two equal groups. One group received a placebo infusion and the other, an infusion of the PMN elastase inhibitor ulinastatin. In the placebo group, the mean plasma PMN elastase level increased from 154 +/- 23 micrograms/L preoperatively to 449 +/- 56 micrograms/L at 6 hours postoperatively (p less than 0.01), whereas the mean plasma fibronectin concentration decreased from 490 +/- 70 micrograms/mL preoperatively to 265 +/- 81 micrograms/L on postoperative day 2 (p less than 0.01). The mean pulmonary vascular resistance increased markedly from 151 +/- 24 dynes.s.cm-5.m-2 preoperatively to 284 +/- 76 dynes.s.cm-5.m-2 at 6 hours postoperatively (p less than 0.01). In the group given ulinastatin, 150,000 units every 12 hours from the start of the operation, the mean PMN elastase value at 6 hours postoperatively was lower (275 +/- 66 micrograms/L; p less than 0.01) and the fibronectin level on postoperative days 1 and 2, higher (p less than 0.05). A lower pulmonary vascular resistance was noted into day 2 (p less than 0.05). Our results suggest that PMN elastase may participate in the development of postoperative pulmonary impairment. 
Nucleolar organizer regions in various human brain tumors. Nucleolar organizer regions (NOR's) are loops of deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) which transcribe to ribosomal ribonucleic acid (RNA) by RNA polymerase I. They possess vital significance in the ultimate synthesis of cellular proteins. A silver colloid staining technique for demonstration of NOR-associated proteins (Ag-NOR's) was applied to paraffin-embedded sections from 128 varied brain tumors and to chromosomal preparations from cultured brain-tumor cells. There was a statistically significant difference in the mean number of Ag-NOR's per nucleus between low-grade tumors (1.98/nucleus) and high-grade tumors (2.95/nucleus). It is suggested that the mean number of Ag-NOR's may represent the proliferative potential of brain tumors. Furthermore, high-grade tumors usually showed relatively large Ag-NOR's in a scattered distribution. In chromosomal preparations, the cultured cells displayed five to 12 Ag-NOR's on acrocentric chromosomes. Five of eight cell lines examined demonstrated ectopic Ag-NOR's. This simple staining technique can be easily applied to routinely processed paraffin-embedded sections and will become a useful tool for quick estimation of the proliferative potential of human brain tumors.
