3	Compensatory mechanisms in degenerative neurologic diseases. Insights from parkinsonism. In animal models of parkinsonism, the ability to lose a substantial proportion of dopaminergic neurons without behavioral deficits does not derive from other systems taking over function of the dopaminergic pathway. The surviving nigrostriatal projection increases both the rate of synthesis and the release of dopamine, as compensatory adjustments. This capacity allows at least a fivefold rise in dopamine delivery per neuron, and this enhancement is potentiated further by receptor up-regulation. Decreased reuptake, due to loss of nerve endings, may also lead to augmented occupancy of dopamine receptors, and so constitute yet another compensatory mechanism. In humans, positron emission tomography has revealed subclinical impairment of the dopaminergic nigrostriatal pathway in subjects at risk for parkinsonism caused by 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine and Lytico-Bodig (the amyotrophic lateral sclerosis-parkinsonism dementia complex of Guam). However, the separation of patients with clinically overt idiopathic parkinsonism from controls is less marked in vivo (by positron emission tomography) than in postmortem analysis (by neurochemical assay). This disparity may be attributable to the reduction in the number of nigrostriatal nerve endings, leading, in vivo, to a relative increase of extracellular dopamine because active reuptake into the nerve endings is an important mechanism for removing dopamine from the synaptic cleft. In contrast, in a postmortem setting, dopamine that is not sequestered in the storage vesicles of nerve endings is readily available for biochemical degradation during the interval between death and brain analysis. Finally, it is also possible that differences may derive, in part, from dissimilar kinetic systems for handling exogenous and endogenous levodopa. 
1	Further evaluation of radical surgery following radiotherapy for advanced parotid carcinoma. A series of 30 patients who have been treated for advanced carcinoma of the parotid gland using radiotherapy followed by radical surgery is presented. Three patients deteriorated during preoperative radiotherapy and remained unfit for surgery; the remaining 27 underwent radical parotidectomy with block dissection of the neck. Twelve patients received additional radiotherapy after operation. Of those patients undergoing surgery, three have been lost to follow-up, 17 have died and seven remain alive; the period of follow-up ranges from 3 to 133 months. Fourteen patients remained free of recurrent disease at death or when last seen, and six patients developed a local recurrence at a medium period of 10.5 (range 3-36) months after surgery. For all 30 patients, the cumulative proportion surviving for 5 years was 30 per cent. 
3	Benign intracranial hypertension after ciprofloxacin administration. Many drugs, including antibiotics, have been implicated in the aetiology of benign intracranial hypertension. We report the development of benign intracranial hypertension after the use of ciprofloxacin in a teenager with cystic fibrosis. 
3	Treatment of spasticity with botulinum toxin: a double-blind study. We studied the effect of botulinum-A toxin on spasticity of the leg adductors in 9 patients who were either chair-bound or bed-bound with chronic stable multiple sclerosis. We injected botulinum toxin (400 mouse units) or placebo into the adductor muscles in a randomized, crossover, double-blind design. Two physicians, who were unaware of the treatment order, used an objective rating scale and independently assessed the patients; interobserver correlation was excellent (r = 0.93-0.81). We found that botulinum toxin produced a significant reduction in spasticity (p = 0.009) and a significant improvement in the ease of nursing care (p = 0.009). There were no adverse effects during this short-term trial. This is the first demonstration of the beneficial effect of botulinum toxin on focal spastic muscle contractions. 
2	Detection and direct sequencing of hepatitis B virus genome by DNA amplification method. Hepatitis B virus (HBV) DNA was detected with amplification by the polymerase chain reaction method. Cloned HBV DNA equivalent to one virus genome (3 x 10(-6) pg) was detectable by ethidium bromide staining after 50 cycles of polymerase chain reaction. By applying this method, presence of HBV DNA was studied in 23 hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg)-positive and 11 HBsAg-negative sera from patients with chronic liver disease. Hepatitis B virus DNA was positive in 8 of 8 hepatitis B e antigen (HBeAg)-positive, in 2 of 2 HBeAg- and anti-HBe-negative, and in 12 of 13 anti-HBe-positive sera. Hepatitis B virus DNA was undetectable in all HBsAg-negative sera even with amplification. To confirm specificity, the amplified product was directly sequenced. Sequences around 122nd and 160th codon of HBs gene, which determines subtypes d/y and w/r, respectively, were analyzed. The results were compatible with recent reports regarding the relation between HBV subtypes and HBV DNA sequence at those codons. Hepatitis B virus DNA could be detected at the level of one virion by gene amplification method, and its sequence could be determined by direct sequencing in a few days. 
1	Serum erythropoietin levels in patients receiving intensive chemotherapy and radiotherapy. To investigate the potential role of recombinant human erythropoietin (rhEpo) in patients receiving intensive cytotoxic therapy, we measured the endogenous levels of Epo in 31 patients undergoing bone marrow transplantation (BMT). Seventeen patients underwent allogeneic BMT and 14 underwent autologous BMT. On average, 10 +/- 4 units of red blood cells (RBCs) were transfused per patient. The mean RBC transfusion requirement of the autologous BMT patients was significantly greater than that of the allogeneic recipients (12 +/- 3 v 8 +/- 4, P less than .01), although both groups were maintained at comparable hematocrits. Epo levels were measured by radioimmunoassay (RIA). For each patient, baseline serum Epo levels were determined at time of admission to the hospital. Subsequent samples were collected within 24 hours of completing chemotherapy and/or radiotherapy, and on days 7, 14, and 28, after BMT. Hematocrits (Hcts) were measured daily. All patients had an initial serum creatinine less than or equal to 1.5 mg/dL. Despite considerable differences in absolute Epo levels among individuals, a characteristic pattern was observed. Following admission to the hospital and initiation of cytotoxic therapy, the average Hct decreased and the average Epo level initially increased. The mean serum Epo levels peaked on day 7 post-BMT (284 +/- 190 mU/mL) and fell steadily thereafter. While the average Hcts on day 7 and on day 28 post-BMT were not significantly different (28 +/- 4.6% v 29 +/- 3.3%, respectively), the average serum Epo levels decreased fourfold (P less than .01) during this same period. Moreover, day 28 post-BMT mean Epo levels were inappropriately low (P less than .05) when compared with a reference population with bone marrow failure and normal controls who had not received cytotoxic therapy. We conclude that the endogenous Epo response appears to be blunted during the 3 to 4 weeks immediately post-BMT. Therefore, clinical trials assessing the efficacy of the administration of rhEpo in the treatment of anemias associated with cytotoxic therapy are warranted. 
4	A prospective study of the incidence and natural history of femoral vascular complications after percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty. Over a 14-month period patients undergoing 144 percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty procedures were evaluated for the presence of complications at the femoral puncture site. After percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty each patient was examined by a surgeon, and then a color-flow duplex scan of the groin was obtained. On the initial scan eight pseudoaneurysms, three arteriovenous fistulas, one combined arteriovenous fistula-pseudoaneurysm, and one thrombosed superficial femoral artery were detected for a major vascular complication rate of 9%. Pseudoaneurysm formation was associated with the use of heparin after removal of the arterial sheath. Seven pseudoaneurysms (initial extravascular cavity size range 1.3 to 3.5 cm) were followed with weekly duplex scans, and all thrombosed spontaneously within 4 weeks of detection. The three patients with isolated arteriovenous fistulas were each followed for at least 8 weeks, and the arteriovenous fistulas persisted. Early surgical intervention for postcatheterization femoral pseudoaneurysms is usually unnecessary as thrombosis often occurs spontaneously. We would advocate an operative approach for pseudoaneurysms that are symptomatic, expanding, or associated with large hematomas. Iatrogenic femoral arteriovenous fistulas should be considered for elective repair, but this may be delayed for several weeks without adverse sequelae. 
1	Sacral plexus injury after radiotherapy for carcinoma of cervix. A 42-year-old woman developed lower extremity weakness and sensory loss 1 year after external and intracavitary radiotherapy for Stage IB carcinoma of cervix. She has been followed for 5 years posttreatment, and the neurologic abnormalities have persisted, but no evidence of recurrent carcinoma has been found. We believe this to be a rare case of sacral plexus radiculopathy developing as a late complication after radiotherapy. Suggestions are made for improving the radiotherapy technique to prevent this complication in future cases. 
5	Comparison of sublingual captopril and nifedipine in immediate treatment of hypertensive emergencies. A randomized, single-blind clinical trial. Sublingual captopril (25 mg) was compared with sublingual nifedipine (10 mg) to determine their effectiveness and safety in the treatment of hypertensive emergencies. In nine of 10 patients who received sublingual captopril, mean (+/- SD) systolic blood pressure and diastolic blood pressure dropped from 245 +/- 39 to 190 +/- 25 mm Hg (P less than .0025) and from 144 +/- 8 to 115 +/- 8 mm Hg (P less than .001) at 50 minutes, respectively. The hypotensive effect of the drug was maintained for a mean of 4 hours. In six of nine responders to sublingual captopril, blood pressure-lowering effect was associated with a clear improvement of end-organ failure within 60 minutes. There were no side effects, including a dangerous fall in blood pressure or reflex tachycardia. Sublingual nifedipine lowered diastolic blood pressure and systolic blood pressure in eight of 10 patients. The hypotensive effect of nifedipine was more rapid than that of captopril (10 vs 20 minutes for diastolic blood pressure and 20 vs 30 minutes for systolic blood pressure, respectively), but no difference was observed in the time or in the magnitude of peak hypotensive effect between the two treatments, nor was a difference observed in the duration of hypotensive effect. In six of eight responders to nifedipine therapy, a clear improvement of symptoms and signs of end-organ failure was observed within 60 minutes. In three patients, minor side effects were observed. We conclude that sublingual captopril effectively and safely lowers arterial blood pressure in patients with hypertensive emergencies. 
5	Labetalol and MRI as initial medical and diagnostic modalities in a marfanoid patient with expanding ascending aortic aneurysm. Marfan syndrome is a hereditable disorder of connective tissue that causes several distinct cardiovascular abnormalities, including aortic regurgitation, dissection, and aneurysm. These cardiac manifestations can be identified with echocardiography, computer tomography, and angiography. Standard treatment of an acute hypertensive crisis in Marfan syndrome uses propranolol and sodium nitroprusside. This patient with Marfan syndrome whose case is reported herein presented with chest pain, hypertensive crisis, and aortic insufficiency; labetalol was used successfully to treat the acute hypertensive crisis and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was used to differentiate between aortic dissection and an expanding aortic aneurysm. This report is unique in that labetalol was used to control the hypertensive crisis in Marfan syndrome and MRI was used as the initial diagnostic modality in an emergency setting. 
3	The standardized assessment of argyrophilic nucleolar organizer regions in meningeal tumors. Tissue markers of cellular proliferation have been recently utilized as prognostic indicators in tumors of the central nervous system. Nucleolar organizer regions represent transcriptionally active sites of ribosomal deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) and can be identified by a simple argyrophilic technique. The authors describe a standardized approach to the assessment of these argyrophilic nucleolar organizer regions in meningeal tumors. Twenty-five meningiomas were classified histologically into benign, atypical, or malignant groups. In addition, two hemangiopericytomas and one leptomeningeal melanoma were examined. Appropriate sections were silver stained and argyrophilic nucleolar organizer regions were counted in 200 nuclei. The mean argyrophilic nucleolar organizer region count was statistically different (p less than 0.001) between benign tumors (245 +/- 156, 1.23/cell), atypical tumors (497 +/- 135, 2.49/cell), and malignant tumors (921 +/- 59, 4.61/cell). The count for recurrent meningiomas (544 +/- 76) was also statistically different (p less than 0.02) from non-recurrent tumors (329 +/- 183). The standardized assessment of argyrophilic nucleolar organizer regions can be easily performed by any surgical pathology laboratory without specialized equipment and, in meningeal tumors, may be useful as an independent indicator of biological behavior. 
4	Mixed connective tissue disease with arterial thrombosis, antiphospholipid antibodies and heparin induced thrombocytopenia. We report a patient with mixed connective tissue disease (MCTD) who presented with thrombosis of the right femoral artery in association with antiphospholipid antibodies (aPL). When treated surgically and with heparin prophylaxis, she developed heparin induced thrombocytopenia and thrombosis which necessitated amputation of a lower limb. Thus our patient developed 2 separate groups of autoantibodies associated with thrombotic events. Our case highlights an association between thrombosis, aPL and MCTD. Furthermore, it emphasizes a need for intensive monitoring when hypercoaguable individuals with connective tissue disorders are treated with heparin. 
5	Continuous postoperative regional analgesia by nerve sheath block for amputation surgery--a pilot study. A pilot study of continuous postoperative regional analgesia by nerve sheath block for lower limb amputation is presented. At the time of exposure of sciatic or posterior tibial nerve trunks during above- or below-knee amputations in 11 patients with ASA physical status III or IV, a catheter was introduced directly into the transected nerve sheath for continuous infusion of 0.25% bupivacaine at a rate of 10 mL/h for 72 h. Effective amputation stump analgesia was obtained, significantly reducing the need for on-demand narcotic analgesics during this time to a mean dose equivalent of 1.4 mg of morphine compared with a retrospective control group who received the equivalent of a mean dose of 18.4 mg of morphine (P less than 0.0001). No complications related to the technique were observed. A follow-up of the group receiving continuous postoperative regional analgesia for up to 12 mo showed a total absence of phantom pain despite the presence of preoperative limb pain. 
5	The significance of Leu 8 negative T cells in lymphoid skin infiltrates: malignant transformation, selective homing or T-cell activation? The expression of Leu 8 was studied on skin biopsies from a large group of patients with benign and malignant skin disorders and correlated with the expression of T-cell differentiation antigens and activation markers. The effect of in vitro stimulation of peripheral blood T cells and T-cell subsets on the expression of Leu 8 antigen was also determined. In all the skin diseases studied an inverse relationship was found between the proportions of cells expressing Leu 8 and HLA-DR. A deficiency of Leu 8 positive cells was not specific for mycosis fungoides, but was also found in several reactive dermatoses. Stimulation of peripheral blood cells with phytohaemagglutinin (PHA), concanavalin A (Con A), and anti-CD3-PMA resulted in a considerable decrease of Leu 8 antigen expression on day 3 in both CD4+ and CD8+ T cells. These data suggest that the low proportion of Leu 8+ T cells in mycosis fungoides and several reactive skin disorders is not related to malignant transformation or selective homing of Leu 8- T cells, but probably results from local T-cell activation. 
5	Bronchoalveolar lavage findings in a patient with the organic dust toxic syndrome. A previously healthy student developed the organic dust toxic syndrome after unloading a grain silo for one day. Bronchoalveolar lavage seven days later showed a total cell count six times normal with 70% lymphocytes. This suggests that the previously described acute neutrophil influx into the alveolar spaces in this syndrome is rapidly replaced by a lymphocyte dominated infiltration. 
5	Proximal placement of the acetabular component in total hip arthroplasty. A long-term follow-up study. A retrospective review was undertaken of thirty-seven hips (thirty-four patients) that had had a complex cemented total hip arthroplasty. In these hips, circumstances had necessitated that the center of the hip be placed farther proximally, as measured from the interteardrop line, than the anatomical position that is normally used. The mean duration of clinical and roentgenographic follow-up was eleven years (range, seven to seventeen years), and the mean age of the patients was fifty-one years (range, sixteen to seventy-three years). Most of these hips had a major deficiency or defect of the acetabular bone stock, or both. Of the six acetabular components (16 per cent) that became loose and were followed for ten years, only one needed revision. Because this study was aimed specifically at assessment of the acetabular component, if the femoral component alone needed revision, the final clinical rating that was used was the one obtained after the femoral revision. Thirty-one hips (84 per cent) were rated as having a good or excellent result; they had an average Harris hip-rating score of 43 points preoperatively and 93 points postoperatively. Thirty-three of the thirty-seven acetabular components were not substantially displaced laterally as compared with the anatomical location that is normally used. Our findings suggest that, when circumstances dictate, proximal positioning of the acetabular component without lateral displacement can give an acceptable result in cemented total hip-replacement procedures. 
5	Regional cardiac adrenergic function using I-123 meta-iodobenzylguanidine tomographic imaging after acute myocardial infarction. The effect of acute myocardial infarction (AMI) on regional cardiac adrenergic function was studied in 27 patients mean +/- standard deviation 10 +/- 4 days after AMI. Regional adrenergic function was evaluated noninvasively with I-123 meta-iodobenzylguanidine (MIBG) using a dedicated 3-detector tomograph. Four hours after its administration, there was reduced MIBG uptake in the region of infarction, 0.38 +/- 0.31 counts/pixel/mCi x 103 compared with 0.60 +/- 0.30 counts/pixel/mCi x 103 and 0.92 +/- 0.35 counts/pixel/mCi x 103 in the zones bordering and distant from the infarct area, respectively, p less than 0.001. In all patients, the area of reduced MIBG uptake after 4 hours was more extensive that the associated thallium-201 perfusion defect with defect scores of 52 +/- 22 and 23 +/- 18%, respectively, p less than 0.001. After anterior wall AMI, the 4-hour MIBG defect score was 70 +/- 13% and the degree of mismatch between myocardial perfusion and MIBG uptake was 30 +/- 9% compared with 39 +/- 17 and 21 +/- 17% after inferior AMI, p less than 0.001 and p = 0.016, respectively. The 4-hour MIBG defect score correlated inversely with the predischarge left ventricular ejection fraction, r = -0.73, p less than 0.001. Patients with ventricular arrhythmia of greater than or equal to 1 ventricular premature complexes per hour, paired ventricular premature complexes or ventricular tachycardia detected during the late hospital phase had higher 4-hour MIBG defect scores, 62.5 +/- 15.0%, than patients with no detectable complex ventricular ectopic activity and a ventricular premature complex frequency of less than 1 per hour, 44.6 +/- 23.4%, p = 0.036. 
3	Dorsal rhizotomy for children with cerebral palsy: support for concepts of motor control. The results from selective dorsal rhizotomy research suggest that therapists need to question some common clinical assumptions about movement dysfunction. The rationale for performing a selective dorsal rhizotomy is based on the clinical assumptions that spasticity is the underlying cause of disordered movement and that reducing or eliminating the spasticity will improve movement. This article reviews the literature related to movement dysfunction, the effects of selective dorsal rhizotomy, and the evidence for disordered motor control in children with spastic cerebral palsy. Selective dorsal rhizotomy appears to reduce spasticity and increase joint range of motion. Abnormal movement patterns, however, persist after the spasticity is reduced. Well-coordinated movement patterns are acquired slowly and appear to be related to an intense period of physical therapy. I argue that these results provide evidence that the presence of spasticity alone is an insufficient explanation for abnormal movement patterns. I propose that physical therapists redirect their efforts from developing methods for reducing spasticity to developing adequate assessment, treatment, and measurement techniques for assessing motor control in children with cerebral palsy. I believe we can maximize the functional potential of children with cerebral palsy by identifying problems related to motor control and applying sound principles of motor learning to treatment. 
1	Nonsquamous tumors of the head and neck in the geriatric population. Thyroid tumors, salivary gland tumors, and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma are described. Psychosocial issues involving the geriatric patient are discussed. Case reports of a number of geriatric tumor patients are included. 
1	Acute hypercalcemic crisis after an open heart operation. Acute hyperparathyroidism developed in a previously normocalcemic 64-year-old woman during the first week after a coronary operation. Prolonged QT interval in the electrocardiogram and hypercalcemia were documented on the fourth postoperative day. Neck exploration on the fifth postoperative day revealed a lower right parathyroid adenoma. Parathyroidectomy resulted in rapid and dramatic improvement of the clinical picture and normalization of laboratory values. 
4	Reduction of mortality, sudden death and non-fatal reinfarction with beta-adrenergic blockers in survivors of acute myocardial infarction: a new hypothesis regarding the cardioprotective action of beta-adrenergic blockade. Beta-adrenergic blockers have been shown definitely to reduce the incidence of total mortality, cardiovascular mortality, sudden death and nonfatal reinfarction in survivors of an acute myocardial infarction. The mechanisms to explain this protective action of beta blockers have never been elucidated conclusively, and include the antiarrhythmic and myocardial oxygen demand-reducing effects of the drugs. An antithrombotic mechanism has also been suggested. However, beta blockers have relatively weak antiplatelet activity, suggesting that their antithrombotic effects may be related to prevention of coronary artery plaque rupture and the subsequent propagation of an occlusive arterial thrombus rather than direct anticoagulant action. The therapeutic ability of beta blockers to attenuate the hemodynamic consequences of catecholamine surges, may protect a vulnerable atherosclerotic plaque from fracture, thereby reducing risk of coronary thrombosis, myocardial infarction and death. 
1	Surgical management of nonparasitic cystic liver disease. We report clinical features, surgical management, recurrences, and follow-up study of 12 patients with simple hepatic cyst, 11 patients with polycystic liver disease, and 19 patients with cystadenoma who were surgically treated over a 25-year period. The median age of patients was 48 years, and 37 women and 5 men were in the series. The most common presenting symptom and physical finding were chronic abdominal pain and tenderness in the right upper quadrant. The most commonly associated disease was polycystic kidney disease, which was an associated finding in 5 of the 11 patients with polycystic liver disease (45%). The most valuable diagnostic studies in all groups were computed tomography and ultrasonography. The location of the disease was bilobar in patients with polycystic liver disease, with a right lobe predominance in 18% of patients. The right lobe was also predominant in 83% of patients with simple hepatic cyst and 58% of patients with cystadenoma. Of all solitary cystic lesions in the left lobe, 75% of them were cystadenomas. Of the 66 surgical procedures performed, aspiration was associated with a failure rate of 100%; partial excision, a failure rate of 61%; and total excision and liver resection, a failure rate of 0%. Orthotopic liver transplantation was performed in three patients and was associated with two early deaths. Partial excision relieved symptoms in three patients (43%) with polycystic liver disease. Total excision, enucleation, or liver resection with cyst(s) is the treatment of choice for non-parasitic cystic lesions of the liver. 
5	Changes in ventricular fibrillation threshold during the development of perinephritic hypertension. Established hypertension is associated with enhanced susceptibility to life-threatening arrhythmias. However, little is known about the effects of the development of hypertension on the electro-physiological properties of the heart. To study this relationship, dogs were chronically instrumented for recording mean arterial pressure and conducting cardiac electrical testing during right ventricular pacing using an intracavitary bipolar catheter. In normotension, ventricular fibrillation threshold was determined under alpha-chloralose anesthesia, after which perinephritic hypertension was induced by wrapping one kidney in silk followed by contralateral nephrectomy. During serial testing of the same animals, ventricular fibrillation threshold was significantly increased early in the development of hypertension (2 to 3 weeks after renal wrapping), but found to be significantly reduced at 6 to 7 weeks after renal wrapping. The increase in ventricular fibrillation threshold was eliminated by cholinergic blockade. 
1	Gonadotroph adenoma of the pituitary mimicking a prolactinoma. In a 41-year-old woman with mild hyperprolactinemia and amenorrhea, preoperative hormonal and neuroradiological findings suggested the diagnosis of a macroprolactinoma. She underwent transsphenoidal surgery since the tumor size had not changed in spite of bromocriptine administration for 5 months. Consequently, this case was diagnosed as a female-type gonadotroph adenoma on the basis of its characteristic ultrastructural features including a honeycomb Golgi complex, even though endocrinological and immunohistochemical findings were not those of a typical gonadotroph adenoma. 
4	Intravascular stents. General principles and status of lower-extremity arterial applications. The two major types of intravascular stents are balloon expandable and self-expanding. Many animal and, more recently, clinical studies have begun to delineate the real and potential roles of stents. Although the ideal intravascular stent does not exist, it is possible to identify characteristics of the hypothetical ideal stent. Iliac and femoropopliteal arterial applications of metallic stents are reviewed. Stents have proved useful in postangioplasty elastic recoil, in some cases of postangioplasty restenosis, and in angioplasty-induced dissection. Their role in primary angioplasty procedures is still uncertain, although in iliac angioplasty the immediate hemodynamic effects of angioplasty plus stenting are superior to those of angioplasty alone. It is clear that metallic stents have not solved the problem of postangioplasty restenosis, as restenosis still occurs in a significant number of cases. This problem is particularly evident in the femoropopliteal stent procedures, in which angiographic restenosis (more than 50% single diameter stenosis) at 6 months after treatment has occurred in approximately 30% of cases. The existence of poststenting restenosis, which often involves the stented segment, underscores the need for better drug regimens in angioplasty and for better understanding of the intimal fibrocellular proliferative response of the vessel wall to injury. Although potentially very useful, biodegradable stents are still a dream whose realization will demand the development of better materials. 
3	Status of cochlear implantation in children. American Academy of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery Subcommittee on Cochlear implants. The cochlear implant is a medical device, part of which is placed surgically, that uses electrical stimulation to provide hearing. For almost a decade, investigational studies have been ongoing to define its safety and efficacy in profoundly deaf children. During this period, more than 500 children aged 2 through 17 years have been implanted with either a single-electrode or multielectrode device. Extensive auditory, speech, educational, and psychologic testing has been performed before and after implantation. Results show that the cochlear implant provides auditory detection over much of the speech signal. Compared with the preimplant period, there is significant improvement in auditory discrimination and speech production skills. Limited open-set word and sentence recognition is possible for at least some children. Complications with the device have been minimal. The cochlear implant can provide sound to deaf children unable to benefit from hearing aids. The complex assessment, rehabilitation, and parent counseling should be performed by centers with the multidisciplinary staffs necessary to provide effective care for patients with this specialized auditory prosthesis. 
4	Aspergillus terreus endophthalmitis in a patient with chronic lymphocytic leukemia. A 65-year-old woman with a 7-year history of chronic lymphocytic leukemia presented with acute visual loss, pain, and redness in her right eye. Results of stains and cultures of anterior chamber fluid were negative. Neurologic problems, bronchopulmonary pneumonia, recurrent skin lesions, and a low-grade fever developed. Progressive respiratory distress ensued, and the patient died 1 month after presentation. Cultures from antemortem sputum and skin samples were positive for Aspergillus terreus. Postmortem histologic results showed extensive A terreus invasion of the posterior vitreous, retina, choroid, and anterior optic nerve. This organism was also found in histologic sections from the right adrenal gland, left kidney, thyroid, urinary bladder, right lung, skin, esophagus, sputum, vessels of the myocardium, and brain. To our knowledge, A terreus endophthalmitis has not been reported previously. 
5	Predicting treatment outcome in nocturnal enuresis. A presenting sample of 127 consecutive referrals to a community based enuresis clinic were evaluated after treatment with baseline behavioural recording and the enuresis alarm. Almost one in five became dry after baseline recording only while 81 of 96 (84%) enuretics who used the alarm achieved the initial dryness criterion. Successful outcome was associated with the absence of adverse environmental factors and psychiatric disorders in the child. A logistic regression procedure enabled a risk score to be created so that successful outcome could be predicted. Psychiatric disorder in the child, family stress, and the degree of concern shown by the child emerged as the most important prognostic factors in the treatment of enuresis. The favourable success rates with baseline recording and the enuresis alarm confirm the role of conditioning treatment at the forefront of management of enuresis and the risk score allows outcome to be predicted for the first time. 
4	Does percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty accelerate atherosclerotic lesions? Recent reports have suggested that angioplasty may cause or accelerate coronary arterial stenoses secondary to traumatic injury. Ninety-four coronary angiograms performed in a 1 yr period were reviewed in patients who had successful coronary angioplasty 6 to 30 mo (mean 10.7) prior to restudy. Restenosis was found in 43 of 140 dilated lesions (31%) and in 41 of 94 patients (44%). Thirty-three (35%) patients had new or progressive lesions outside the angioplasty site. New or progressive lesions occurred with similar frequency in the arteries that did not have angioplasty (23/155 = 15%) as in the arteries that did (13/127 = 10%; chi-square n.s.). In the arteries which underwent angioplasty, new or progressive lesions occurred as commonly proximal to the PTCA site (7/14, 50%) as distal (6/13, 46%). New or progressive lesions occurred in 29% of patients with concomitant restenosis, and 40% of those without restenosis (chi-square n.s.). No clinical, angiographic, or procedural factors distinguished patients with new and progressive lesions in target vessels from those without these lesions in target vessels. Patients with progressive lesions anywhere in the coronary tree were more likely to have had a shorter duration of anginal symptoms before angioplasty and a family history of coronary disease when compared with patients without progressive atherosclerosis. In conclusion, new and progressive lesions outside the angioplasty site occur after the procedure but appear unrelated to the restenosis process or traumatic injury by angioplasty instrumentation. 
3	Short-term memory and sentence comprehension. An investigation of a patient with crossed aphasia. The relationship between short-term memory impairment and sentence comprehension is explored in a right-handed patient with a focal temporoparietal lesion of the right hemisphere. The general clinical profile, as well as characteristics of the patient's immediate memory for word lists, suggests the occurrence of a 'mirror image' crossed aphasia. Detailed analysis of the patient's ability to repeat and to comprehend sentences, however, indicates some important differences between this case and previously reported patients with short-term memory impairment. It is suggested that these differences, which may be related to an unusual pattern of neuroanatomical organization of cognitive functions, involve symptom dissociations with implications for models of normal language/memory interactions. 
3	Gross motor patterns in children with cerebral palsy and spastic diplegia. Rolling, sitting, and crawling patterns were motoscopically analyzed in 72 children with cerebral palsy and spastic diplegia; the relation between these patterns and the severity of the locomotive disability was studied. In rolling, trunk rotation and elbow support were difficult for the most severely diplegic children. When sitting, most patients had a between-heel sitting pattern in which the thighs were adducted and the knees were flexed. When crawling, the reciprocal thigh movements were insufficient and accompanied by lateral bending of the trunk in many patients. In the more impaired patients, the thighs supported the weight in flexion and did not move reciprocally. Creeping on the elbows without reciprocal leg movements was demonstrated in the most severely affected children after 2 years of age. 
1	4-Hydroperoxycyclophosphamide purging of breast cancer from the mononuclear cell fraction of bone marrow in patients receiving high-dose chemotherapy and autologous marrow support: a phase I trial. We designed an ex vivo bone marrow treatment for breast cancer patients receiving high-dose chemotherapy and autologous bone marrow support (ABMS), using 4-hydroperoxycyclophosphamide (4-HC), an active derivative of cyclophosphamide with known activity against breast cancer. This phase I bone marrow purging trial used ficoll-separated mononuclear cells (MNC) (devoid of granulocytes and RBCs), as opposed to the buffy coat. Twenty-five patients with metastatic breast cancer were studied. Patients received three cycles of the Adriamycin (doxorubicin; Adria Laboratories, Columbus, OH), fluorouracil, and methotrexate (Duke AFM) regimen, followed by marrow harvest. An MNC fraction of marrow was prepared and treated with 4-HC in concentrations of 20 micrograms/mL (four patients), 40 micrograms/mL (four patients), 60 micrograms/mL (nine patients), or 80 micrograms/mL (eight patients) and cryopreserved. Patients then received high-dose systemic cyclophosphamide, cisplatin, and carmustine, followed by infusion of the purged marrow. The study end point was marrow engraftment, defined as WBC count greater than 1,000 cells per microliter. At the first three dose levels (20, 40, and 60 micrograms/mL 4-HC), there was no significant delay in time to engraftment (19, 20, and 23 days, respectively) compared with the unpurged historical controls (17 days). At 80 micrograms/mL, engraftment was significantly delayed compared with the lower concentrations (P = .027), and further escalation of 4-HC was not attempted. A significant correlation was observed between the time of leukocyte engraftment and the 4-HC concentration (P = .017). With a methylcellulose-based tissue culture assay, we demonstrated a statistically significant correlation between the colony-forming unit-granulocyte-macrophage (CFU-GM) content in the purged marrow and the days to engraftment. Ninety-five percent of patients responded clinically to the entire program, 55% of them completely. Longer follow-up is required to assess the ultimate benefit of intensive therapy on long-term survival. 
4	Use of pulmonary artery catheters in patients with acute myocardial infarction. Analysis of experience in 5,841 patients in the SPRINT Registry. SPRINT Study Group This study analyzes the use of PAC in a registry comprising 5,841 hospitalized patients with AMI. A total of 371 patients received PAC. In-hospital mortality was higher in patients with CHF who received PAC, while there was no difference in patients with cardiogenic shock or persistent hypotension. Mortality in patients receiving PAC was higher irrespective of the presence or absence of "pump failure." A separate analysis of discharge summaries of 364 patients with CHF showed that PAC was used more frequently in sicker patients and that when severity of CHF was assessed, no difference in mortality was found in patients with mild or moderate CHF. We conclude that while a higher in-hospital mortality is found in patients receiving PAC, this excess is likely related to difference in severity of CHF, which had not been assessed in every individual. It is unlikely that PAC increases mortality. 
3	Contingent Negative Variation in migraine. The Contingent Negative Variation (CNV) is an event-related slow potential. It was recorded in healthy volunteers (n = 8) and in patients suffering from migraine without (n = 12) or with (n = 5) aura, during one (CNV1) and three second (CNV3) foreperiods in a forewarned reaction time task. CNV1 was recorded at the vertex while CNV3 was recorded at multiple electrode sites to assess topographical differences. Seven out of twelve migraine patients without aura had increased CNV1 amplitudes. CNV3 amplitudes were increased as well, but only at electrode positions C3 and C4 and not at Fz. CNV3, which allows for analysis of both an early and a late CNV component, could improve the discrimination of migraine without aura beyond that of CNV1. In migraine with aura all CNV parameters were at control levels, confirming previous results. The data obtained are discussed in terms of arousal, activation and stress and the "biobehavioral model of migraine" (Welch, 1986). 
1	Myocarditis or acute myocardial infarction associated with interleukin-2 therapy for cancer. The hearts of eight patients aged 22 to 67 years (mean, 41 years) who died during or within 4 days of interleukin-2 (IL-2) based immunotherapy for treatment of renal cell carcinoma or melanoma were studied at necropsy. Death resulted from combined cardiorespiratory failure in two patients, sepsis in four patients, acute myocardial infarction in one patient, and myocarditis in one patient. Transmural left ventricular necrosis was present in one of the two patients with significant atherosclerotic coronary artery narrowing. Noninfectious myocarditis was present in five patients: the inflammatory infiltrate was lymphocytic in four and composed of a mixture of eosinophils and lymphocytes in one. Although treatment-related deaths associated with high-dose IL-2 therapy are uncommon (1.5% in 652 consecutive patients), the potential for significant myocardial ischemia or myocarditis exists, and careful monitoring for arrhythmias or myocardial failure is warranted. 
2	Hepatic cyst associated with Peutz-Jeghers syndrome. A solitary hepatic cyst, associated with Peutz-Jeghers syndrome, is described. To our knowledge, this association has not been previously reported. A developmental anomaly or hamartomatous nature of this lesion is suggested. Knowledge of this association may be helpful in the clinical diagnosis of this benign entity. 
3	The management of mid-face fractures with intracranial injury. Recent advances have radically changed the management of facial fractures. CT scanning, extensive exposure, and rigid plate fixation in the setting of the trauma center have permitted early operation with improved results. A subset of patients with facial fractures will also have intracranial injuries (ICI). We sought to identify parameters associated with an increased risk for ICI. We also sought to examine the safety and limits of early craniofacial repair in patients with intracranial injuries. Of 114 mid-face fractures treated over a 1-year period, 43 (38%) had a concomitant ICI. The majority, 36 (84%), were from motor vehicle accidents (MVA). Frontal sinus and orbitoethmoid fractures were at the highest risk for ICI, although orbitozygomatic fractures caused by MVAs also had a surprisingly high incidence of ICI. Our results show that early craniofacial repair can be performed safely with appropriate general surgical and neurosurgical support. 
1	Endoscopic and radiographic evaluation of the murine colon. Endoscopic and radiographic techniques have not been widely applicable in the evaluation of chemically induced murine colon cancer. The authors investigated methods of cleansing the rat colon and refined endoscopic and radiographic techniques. They compared total colonoscopy (TC) and air-contrast (ACBE) and single-contrast barium enema (SCBE) findings with those obtained at necropsy in rats with 1,2-dimethylhydrazine (DMH)-induced colon cancer. Gastrograffin enemas with bisacodyl suppositiories showed complete evacuation of solid feces. Sprague-Dawley rats treated with DMH had their colons cleansed and then underwent TC (5.0-mm Olympus bronchoscope) and either SCBE or ACBE. Colonoscopy and ACBE were equally sensitive (81.5% and 76.3%, respectively), although SCBE was significantly insensitive in identifying lesions (P less than 0.001). This study demonstrates that: (1) mechanical cleansing of the rat colon is feasible, (2) TC and barium radiology can be done routinely after mechanical cleansing, and (3) TC and double-contrast BE are sensitive in identifying colon lesions. These techniques will provide a means for manipulation of murine tumors and in vivo surveillance. 
5	Cytomegalovirus neuropathy in acquired immunodeficiency syndrome: a clinical and pathological study. We have observed typical cytomegalovirus cytopathology associated with multifocal inflammatory and necrotic lesions of peripheral nerve in biopsy specimens from 4 patients who developed a rapidly progressive, multifocal neuropathy late in the course of human immunodeficiency virus infection. The inflammatory infiltrates, which contained numerous polymorphonuclear cells, were associated with mixed, axonal, and demyelinative lesions of nerve fibers. One of these patients improved on treatment with DHPG (9-[2-hydroxy-l(hydroxymethyl) ethoxymethyl] guanine) and remains stable after 18 months. The other 3 died soon after the onset of the neuropathy. In another patient with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome, who developed a severe, predominantly motor neuropathy of the lower limbs, the nerve biopsy did not reveal cytomegalovirus inclusions, but the neurological deficit improved on treatment with DHPG. The patient died from cachexia 2 months later; numerous cytomegalovirus lesions were found in the spinal cord at the time of postmortem examination. The multifocal necrotic endoneurial nerve lesions with polymorphonuclear cell infiltration we describe may help identify cytomegalovirus neuropathy when characteristic inclusions are not present in the biopsy specimen. 
4	Efficacy of thrombolysis in infrainguinal bypass grafts. The initial outcome of a consecutive series of 43 intra-arterial urokinase infusions for thrombosed infrainguinal grafts in 37 patients was analyzed. There was an 88% (38/43) technical success rate (complete clot lysis) and a 74% (32/43) clinical success rate. Complications occurred in 10 patients (23%) and were related to bleeding in four patients (9%). Patient age, graft age, location, material, and the duration of occlusion did not significantly influence the initial outcome, although there was a trend toward a higher bleeding complication rate among grafts less than or equal to 1 month of age at the time of thrombolysis. A second group of 43 infrainguinal grafts successfully recanalized using regional infusions of thrombolytic agents were followed for long-term patency. This group included 32 grafts successfully treated with urokinase and 11 grafts recanalized with streptokinase. By life-table analysis there was a 55.6% 1-year patency, which fell to 42.4% at 4 years. Vein grafts had significantly (p = 0.01) better long-term patency than prosthetic grafts (69.3% versus 28.6% at 30 months). Grafts with flow-limiting lesions identified and corrected by angioplasty or surgery also had significantly (p = 0.01) better long-term patency than those without such lesions (79.0% versus 9.8% at 2 years). Based on the results of our study compared with a survey of long-term results following secondary surgical procedures for thrombosed infrainguinal grafts, thrombolysis can be recommended in several circumstances. Thrombolysis is indicated for thrombosed vein grafts or when thrombus is present in distal runoff vessels. Thrombosed prosthetic grafts should be replaced by autogenous vein grafts whenever possible. 
1	Pancreatic secretory trypsin inhibitor stimulates the growth of rat pancreatic carcinoma cells. Pancreatic secretory trypsin inhibitor was examined for growth-promoting activity on five cell lines using standard cell culture techniques. One cell line, AR4-2J, derived from a rat pancreatic acinar cell carcinoma, responded with significantly increased incorporation of [3H]thymidine and colony formation. Pancreatic secretory trypsin inhibitor stimulated the incorporation of [3H]thymidine in liquid culture; the maximal increase was 61 +/- 10% above control (P less than 0.001) and was seen at a concentration of 10(-9) mol/L. Using a soft agarose clonogenic assay, pancreatic secretory trypsin inhibitor also consistently stimulated (3 assays) colony formation: the peak activity occurred at a concentration of 10(-10) mol/L which caused a 150 +/- 55% (mean +/- SE, P less than 0.05) increase above control. Aprotinin had no effect on the growth of AR4-2J cells and pancreatic secretory trypsin inhibitor did not bind to the epidermal growth factor receptor. AR4-2J cells were shown to produce pancreatic secretory trypsin inhibitor. The study raises the possibility that pancreatic secretory trypsin inhibitor provides autocrine stimulation of tumor cell growth. 
2	Characterization of a rat pancreatic secretory protein associated with pancreatitis. A new protein was purified from the pancreatic juice of rats with acute pancreatitis. That protein, not detectable in control animals, was called "pancreatitis-associated protein." It was first observed 6 hours after induction of experimental pancreatitis with taurocholate or cerulein, reached maximal levels of 45 micrograms/mg protein in zymogen granules and 1.8 micrograms/mg protein in pancreatic tissue during the acute phase (48 hours), and disappeared during recovery (day 5). It was never detected in spleen, liver, kidney, heart, or lung. The detection limit of the assay system was 12 ng/mg protein, so that pancreatitis-associated protein levels increased at least 100-fold in pancreatic tissue during the acute phase. The molecular weight (12,000) and isoelectric point (8.2) were determined by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis. Subcellular fractionation and immunoelectron microscopy showed that the protein was synthesized on the rough endoplasmic reticulum and stored in zymogen granules before being secreted, similar to other pancreatic secretory proteins. Immunoblotting and two-dimensional gel electrophoresis revealed that the same protein was synthesized upon induction of pancreatitis by cerulein infusion, by retrograde injection of bile acids, or pancreatitis induced by pancreatic surgery. The pancreatitis-associated protein is therefore an acute-phase protein that differs from other proteins of that family because of its exocrine nature. 
5	Postoperative adhesion development after operative laparoscopy: evaluation at early second-look procedures. Operative Laparoscopy Study Group. To assess the issue of the frequency and severity of adhesion reformation and de novo adhesion formation after operative laparoscopy, this multicenter collaborative report of early second-look procedures after operative laparoscopy was initiated. Sixty-eight subjects underwent operative laparoscopic procedures including adhesiolysis, followed by a second operative procedure within 90 days. The total mean adhesion score decreased from 11.4 +/- 0.7 at the initial operative procedure to 5.5 +/- 0.4 at the second-look procedure, a decrease of 52%. At the time of the second-look procedure, 66 of 68 women (97.1%) had pelvic adhesions. Adhesion reformation occurred in 66 of 68 women and at 230 of 351 sites (66%) at which adhesions were lysed. Despite this high incidence of adhesion reformation, de novo adhesion formation after operative laparoscopy occurred in only 8 of 68 women (12%) and at 11 of 47 available sites in these 8 women. We conclude that adhesion reformation is a frequent occurrence after operative laparoscopy; however de novo adhesion formation appears to occur much less frequently. 
2	Autologous implant of peritoneal mesothelium in rabbits and man. With the purpose of studying peritoneal physiology, original biopsy methods were devised and human and rabbit peritoneal mesothelial cells cultured and characterized. It was then decided to verify whether these cells could be implanted autologously during peritoneal dialysis in cases of acute loss of mesothelial surface. Staphylococcal peritonitis was induced in 12 rabbits and after 4 days of antibiotics, 6 of them were autoimplanted with cultured mesothelial cells, previously marked in 3 cases with thymidine (H3TdR). Implanted rabbits sacrificed after 3 and 6 days showed taking of the new mesothelial cells both by direct morphological observation and by autoradiography. Four uremic CAPD patients recovering from severe peritonitis were implanted with 300 million of their own peritoneal mesothelial cells, previously cultured and frozen. Morphological signs of taking were evident by laparoscopy and from peritoneal biopsies performed 3 and 6 days after implant. The fact that such implants are possible may have interesting applications in medicine and surgery. 
3	Learning a unimanual motor skill by partial commissurotomy patients. A series of motor tests on four Chinese partial commissurotomy patients is reported. The single-stage commissurotomy in all four patients included the anterior commissures and two-thirds or four-fifths section of the corpus callosum with sparing of the splenium. There was no demonstrable ability to transfer hand posture in these patients. This was the major evidence for functional deconnexion. A newly learned task of one-hand knotting revealed right hand impairment in all four patients. There was no dyspraxia in the right hand for over-learned object-handling tasks in these patients. It is suggested that there might be right hemisphere specialisation for the initial acquisition of unimanual object-handling skills and that the spared callosal fibres in the splenium alone are insufficient to mediate task control under these conditions. This is supported by the finding that one of these patients, who was the only one who had a right parietal lesion, was unable to perform the newly learned task with either hand. 
5	Quantitative structural analysis of peripheral airways and arteries in sudden fatal asthma. The peripheral airways and the adjacent muscular pulmonary arteries were studied by morphometric methods in the autopsy lungs of six asthmatic subjects who died suddenly during an asthma attack, and they were compared with those of six control subjects who died of other causes and had no history of respiratory diseases. Bronchioles of asthmatic subjects had an increased amount of lumen occlusion (p less than 0.01), smooth muscle thickness (p less than 0.001), and inflammatory infiltrate (p less than 0.001), and both mononuclear cells and eosinophils contributed to this increased inflammation. The muscular pulmonary arteries adjacent to occluded and inflamed bronchioles did not have the morphologic features of chronic hypoxia, as shown by the normal medial and intimal thickness, but they had an important inflammatory process in their walls that was particularly marked at sites adjacent to airways. Although the functional significance of these findings is unknown, they may be responsible in part for the gas exchange abnormalities observed in acute severe asthma. 
5	Unfading acral microlivedo. A discrete marker of thrombotic skin disease associated with antiphospholipid antibody syndrome. Small erythematous or cyanotic lesions on the hands and feet of four patients with antiphospholipid antibodies are described. These discrete lesions outline capillaries and do not disappear when pressure is applied. The histologic features are identical to those described in skin thrombotic syndrome associated with antiphospholipid antibodies, that is, microthrombi in dermal vessels without inflammation. In addition to indicating antiphospholipid antibodies in apparently healthy patients, this sign could be a marker of risk for large-vessel thrombosis. 
1	Levamisole and 5-fluorouracil therapy for resected colon cancer: a new indication. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the benefits and risks of postoperative treatment with levamisole plus 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) in patients with colon cancer. DESIGN: Computerized searches of MEDLINE and CANCERLIT were performed, and the reference list of each retrieved article was checked. Only randomized trials of therapy with levamisole alone or combined with 5-FU for colon cancer without distant metastases were included. The studies were then evaluated with the use of four criteria. RESULTS: We reviewed six randomized trials, of which three satisfied our criteria. Two studies demonstrated a significant improvement in the survival rate with levamisole plus 5-FU among patients with colon cancer and pathologically confirmed metastases to adjacent lymph nodes (Dukes' stage C). A subgroup analysis in another study demonstrated a similar benefit. The toxic effects of the drugs were generally mild. The three other studies showed no difference in survival rates between the treatment groups; however, the samples were too small to detect a clinically or statistically important difference. CONCLUSIONS: Because many patients with colon cancer will suffer a relapse we recommend that they be offered the opportunity to participate in clinical trials of adjuvant therapy. For those with stage C disease not entering a clinical trial levamisole plus 5-FU is appropriate adjuvant therapy. 
4	Concordance for dyslipidemic hypertension in male twins. Sixty cases of dyslipidemic hypertension were identified in the 1028 middle-aged, white, male twin participants in the first examination of the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute Twin Study (1969 to 1973). The prevalence of dyslipidemic hypertension was similar by zygosity but proband concordance was three times greater in monozygotic than dizygotic twins (0.44 [seven concordant and 18 discordant pairs] vs 0.14 [two concordant and 24 discordant pairs]), suggesting a genetic effect on the condition. Low high-density lipoprotein cholesterol level was the most common lipid abnormality in concordant pairs. Mortality from ischemic heart disease was significantly higher in individuals with dyslipidemic hypertension. Obesity and glucose intolerance were closely associated with the syndrome. Moreover, within the 18 discordant monozygotic twin pairs, the twins with dyslipidemic hypertension had gained significantly more weight as adults and were significantly heavier than their unaffected cotwins. Thus, although genetic factors may influence development of dyslipidemic hypertension, nongenetic, potentially modifiable aspects of obesity are also closely related to expression of this clinically important syndrome. 
4	Circulating heart-reactive antibodies in patients with myocarditis or cardiomyopathy [corrected and republished with original paging, article originally printed in J Am Coll Cardiol 1990 Oct;16(4):839-46] Heart-reactive antibodies are commonly observed in patients with myocarditis or cardiomyopathy. Such antibodies may be important in the pathogenesis of these disorders, yet the specific antigens recognized have not been studied systematically. This report characterizes circulating heart autoantibodies from patients with myocarditis (n = 17) or idiopathic cardiomyopathy (n = 71) and from healthy volunteers (n = 15). Indirect immunofluorescence demonstrated that high titer (greater than or equal to 1:20) immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibody activity occurred in 59% of the myocarditis samples, 20% of the cardiomyopathy samples and none of the normal samples. All samples were tested by Western immunoblotting for IgG activity against a normal human heart extract. The number of antigens recognized by each sample was enumerated and the molecular weight of each antigen estimated; the prevalence of reactivity against antigens in selected molecular weight classes was determined. There was no difference in the mean number of heart antigens recognized by serum from each group. For most weight classes, prevalence either did not differ significantly among the various groups or subgroups or was greatest among samples from healthy volunteers. Prevalence of reactivity with 190 to 199 kilodalton (kd) antigens was greatest (p less than 0.05) among low titer serum samples from patients with myocarditis. High titer cardiomyopathy serum differed from normal serum by an increased (p less than 0.05) prevalence of antibodies to 40 to 49 and 100 to 109 kd antigens. These results suggest that western immunostaining may ultimately contribute substantively to identifying patients with myocarditis or cardiomyopathy. 
2	Pancreatic duct abnormalities in gall stone disease: an endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatographic study. This study was carried out to assess pancreatic duct abnormalities in gall stone disease. Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatograms of 50 patients with gall stone disease were analysed and the results compared with those obtained in 33 patients investigated for cholestatic jaundice who were found to have a normal biliary tree (control group). Abnormal pancreatograms were obtained in 24 (48%) patients with gall stone disease and in only two (6%) in the control group; the differences were statistically significant (chi 2 = 14.3; p less than 0.001). The patients in the control group showed mild abnormalities as did those in the gall stone group. The frequency of various abnormalities were: mild 16 (32%), moderate five (10%), and severe three (6%). Pancreatic duct abnormalities were more severe and occurred more frequently in patients with gall stones who had stones in the biliary tree than in patients with a normal biliary tree (postcholecystectomy patients, 55% v 25%) but the difference between the two groups just failed to be significant (chi 2 = 3.34). In conclusion, nearly half of all patients with gall stone disease have pancreatic duct abnormalities and in 16% these were severe enough to be labelled as chronic pancreatitis. 
1	Lactation following conservation surgery and radiotherapy for breast cancer. A 38-year-old woman with early stage invasive breast cancer was treated with wide excision of the tumor, axillary lymph node dissection, and breast irradiation. Three years later, she gave birth to a normal baby. She attempted breast feeding and had full lactation from the untreated breast. The irradiated breast underwent only minor changes during pregnancy and postpartum but produced small amounts of colostrum and milk for 2 weeks postpartum. There are only a few reports of lactation after breast irradiation. These cases are reviewed, and possible factors affecting breast function after radiotherapy are discussed. Because of scant information available regarding its safety for the infant, nursing from the irradiated breast is not recommended. 
5	Molecular biology of circulatory shock. Part III. Human hepatoblastoma (HepG2) cells demonstrate two patterns of shock-induced gene expression that are independent, exclusive, and prioritized. During shock and resuscitation, parenchymal cells of solid organs are exposed to a rapidly changing microenvironment, which may include a reduced oxygen tension and an increased concentration of certain cytokines including tumor necrosis factor alpha and interleukin-1. In vivo experiments that testedl iver biopsied from pigs undergoing cardiogenic shock and resuscitation demonstrated several patterns of gene expression. To study the independent and additive influences of hypoxia and of cytokines in vitro, human hepatoblastoma (HepG2) cells were perturbed by hypoxia/reoxygenation (H/R), by heat shock, and by the cytokines interleukin-1 and tumor necrosis factor alpha alone and in combination. H/R induces new patterns of protein synthesis and secretion that are indistinguishable from those induced by heat shock and independent of the acute-phase response mediated by the cytokines. The H/R (heat-shock) response has priority over and will extinguish gene expression supported by the cytokines. This previously unrecognized hierarchy of stress gene expression could well form the molecular basis of shock-related cell and organ failure. 
5	Antropyloric muscle thickness at US in infants: what is normal? The authors reviewed the ultrasonographic (US) images and medical records of 145 consecutive infants who were seen for evaluation of the upper gastrointestinal tract because of chronic vomiting and/or regurgitation. At US, the antropyloric muscle of each patient was measured in the midlongitudinal plane. On the basis of this measurement, the patients were divided into the following categories: group 1 (1-2 mm; 99 patients), group 2 (greater than or equal to 3 mm; 40 patients), and group 3 (2- less than 3 mm; six patients). Patients in group 1 were considered to have normal antropyloric muscle thickness, those in group 2 had abnormal thickness, and those in group 3 had muscle thickness that was not definitely normal or abnormal. The final clinical diagnoses for all of the infants in the three groups confirmed the authors' initial impressions that antropyloric muscle thickness of less than 2 mm was anatomically normal, muscle measuring 3 mm or greater was abnormal and diagnostic for pyloric stenosis, and muscle from 2 to less than 3 mm was abnormal but not specifically diagnostic for pyloric stenosis. Two of the six patients in group 3 eventually were diagnosed as having pyloric stenosis; thus, the authors believe that only those patients with antropyloric muscle less than 2 mm thick should be considered unequivocably normal. 
5	Central nervous system involvement in patients with facial palsy due to borrelial infection. Patients with a peripheral facial palsy due to an underlying Ixodes-borne borreliosis often have cerebrospinal fluid findings indicating meningeal involvement. The aim of the present study was to identify signs of CNS involvement by means of brain-stem evoked response audiometry (BSER) in patients with a facial palsy due to borreliosis, as well as in patients with a facial palsy of unknown aetiology. Bell's palsy. Abnormalities in BSER were found to be significantly more common along the borrelial patients. Furthermore, a reversal of these abnormalities following treatment with benzyl-penicillin was found in the majority of patients with borreliosis. The results of the present study emphasize the importance of diagnosing and treating an underlying borreliosis in patients with a peripheral facial palsy. 
5	Push-enteroscopy for diagnosis of patients with gastrointestinal bleeding of obscure origin. Push-enteroscopy using a disinfected colonoscope was performed on 39 patients with gastrointestinal bleeding of obscure origin. Our results show that: (1) A high percentage of patients (38%) have pathological lesions responsible for bleeding located in the distal duodenum and proximal jejunum, which are readily detected by push-enteroscopy. (2) Duodeno-jejunal arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) are the most common cause for bleeding, and these lesions can be conveniently cauterized through the endoscope. (3) An efficient sequence of steps for diagnosis of patients with this problem includes push-enteroscopy when the initial EGD and colonoscopy are normal followed by small bowel radiography. Mesenteric angiography and intraoperative enteroscopy can be reserved for patients with severe bleeding when push-enteroscopy and small bowel radiography are negative. We conclude that push-enteroscopy has an important role to play in the early assessment of patients with gastrointestinal bleeding of obscure origin. 
4	Effects of exercise on myocardial catecholamine content and ischemic injury in dogs with gradual coronary occlusion. The effects of exercise on catecholamine content and the extent of myocardial damage in dogs with Ameroid constrictor occlusion of the left circumflex coronary artery were determined. Tissue samples from both the anterior and posterior walls of the left ventricle were obtained for determination of catecholamine content, and the rest of the ventricles were processed for histologic examination. When subjected to treadmill exercise for 40 days after surgery, obstructed animals performed significantly less exercise than sham-operated animals and showed significantly higher percentages of ischemia and necrosis in the left ventricle than sedentary, obstructed, sham-operated, or control dogs. Levels of norepinephrine and epinephrine in the posterior wall of the left ventricle were significantly lower than in the other groups. Our data show that exercise in this well-known model of chronic coronary artery stenosis produced deleterious effects on the myocardium and suggest a marked heterogeneity of catecholamine stores in the myocardium that may have important functional and electrophysiologic consequences. 
4	Analysis of programmed stimulation methods in the evaluation of ventricular arrhythmias in patients 20 years old and younger. The purpose of this study was to systematically evaluate programmed ventricular stimulation in patients less than 21 years of age undergoing electrophysiologic testing. A standardized protocol was applied in 55 consecutive patients (mean age 14 years) with the following clinical presentations: sustained ventricular tachycardia (VT) (n = 17); ventricular fibrillation (VF) (n = 7); syncope with heart disease (n = 10); nonsustained VT (n = 6); and syncope with an ostensibly normal heart (n = 15). The stimulation protocol consisted of 1 and 2 ventricular extrastimuli during sinus rhythm, followed by 1 to 4 (S2, S3, S4, S5) extrastimuli during pacing at 2 ventricular sites. Of the 17 patients with sustained VT, 12 had induction of the arrhythmia (sensitivity = 71%). Overall, 18 of 55 patients had inducible sustained VT, with this response significantly enhanced by use of S4 or S5 protocols (p = 0.02). Although no syncope patients with an ostensibly normal heart had inducible sustained VT, 7 had polymorphic nonsustained VT in response to ventricular stimulation. The mean number of extra-stimuli preceding the induction of nonsustained or sustained VT or VF did not differ. The induction of VF in 5 cases during this study was preceded in each case by extrastimuli intervals less than or equal to 190 ms. Thus, data indicate that aggressive stimulation protocols appear to be required for induction of sustained VT in most young patients, nonsustained polymorphic VT as a response to aggressive programmed stimulation is of uncertain significance, and that coupling intervals less than or equal to 190 ms may correlate with the induction of VF. 
3	Differential effect of oncotic pressure on cerebral and extracerebral water content during cardiopulmonary bypass in rabbits. To study the effect of oncotic pressure on brain water content during cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB), 14 anesthetized New Zealand White rabbits underwent 60 min of nonpulsatile CPB at normothermia. Animals were grouped according to the composition of the circuit priming fluid. Group 1 animals (n = 7) received a priming fluid (6.5% hydroxyethyl starch in 0.72 N NaCl; 323 +/- 13 mOsm/kg [mean +/- SD]) that maintained normal colloid oncotic pressure (COP) during CPB (19.0 +/- 1.5 mmHg). Group 2 animals (n = 7) received a priming fluid (0.9 N NaCl; 324 +/- 23 mOsm/kg) that led to a hypooncotic state (COP = 6.2 +/- 1.2 mmHg). Blood chemistries and hemodynamics were recorded every 15 min during CPB. Animals were given additional priming fluid and sodium bicarbonate during CPB to maintain a circuit flow of 85 ml.kg-1.min-1 and arterial pH greater than 7.35. There were no significant differences between groups 1 and 2 with respect to temperature, central venous pressure, mean arterial pressure, PaO2, PaCO2, plasma sodium concentration, or osmolality at any time during CPB, although osmolality increased in both groups. After 60 min of bypass, animals were killed and organ water contents were determined by wet/dry weight ratios. A separate group of nine similarly prepared and anesthetized animals that did not undergo cannulation or CPB also underwent measurement of plasma chemistries and tissue water contents and served as nonbypass controls (group 3). Brain and kidney water contents were unaffected by oncotic pressure, whereas duodenum and skeletal muscle had significantly greater water content (P = 0.003 and P = 0.008, respectively) after hypooncotic CPB. 
4	Spectrum of hemodynamic changes in cardiac tamponade. To investigate the pathophysiology of cardiac tamponade, the hemodynamics of 77 consecutive patients with greater than 150 ml of pericardial effusion were studied. Patients were classified into 3 groups based on the equilibration of intrapericardial with right atrial and pulmonary arterial wedge pressures (mm Hg): group I (n = 16), intrapericardial pressure was less than right atrial and pulmonary arterial wedge pressures; group II (n = 13), intrapericardial pressure was equilibrated with right atrial but not pulmonary arterial wedge pressures; group III (n = 48), intrapericardial pressure was equilibrated with right atrial and pulmonary arterial wedge pressures. Pericardiocentesis produced the following changes: group I--significant (p less than 0.03) decreases in intrapericardial pressure (7 +/- 2 mm Hg), right atrial pressure (3 +/- 2 mm Hg), pulmonary arterial wedge pressure (2 +/- 2 mm Hg), and the inspiratory decrease in arterial systolic pressure (3 +/- 4 mm Hg) but no significant change in cardiac output; group II--significant (p less than 0.02) decreases in intrapericardial pressure (11 +/- 5 mm Hg), right atrial pressure (6 +/- 4 mm Hg), pulmonary arterial wedge pressure (4 +/- 5 mm Hg), and inspiratory decrease in arterial systolic pressure (8 +/- 7 mm Hg), and increase in cardiac output (1.1 +/- 1.2 liters/min); group III--significant (p less than 0.001) decreases in intrapericardial pressure (16 +/- 7 mm Hg), right atrial pressure (9 +/- 4 mm Hg), pulmonary arterial wedge pressure (8 +/- 5 mm Hg), inspiratory decrease in arterial systolic pressure (17 +/- 11 mm Hg), and increase in cardiac output (2.8 +/- 1.5 liters/min). The changes after pericardiocentesis in all parameters were significantly (p less than 0.05) greater in group III than in groups I or II except for the change in right atrial pressure, which was not significantly different in groups II versus III. The changes after pericardiocentesis indicate pericardial effusion caused the greatest abnormalities in group III but also caused significant abnormalities of pressure and flow in group II and of pressure alone in group I. 
5	Middle cerebral artery flow velocity waveforms in fetal hypoxaemia. In 81 small-for-gestational age fetuses (SGA) colour flow imaging was used to identify the fetal middle cerebral artery for subsequent pulsed Doppler studies. Impedence to flow (pulsatility index; PI) was significantly lower, and mean blood velocity was significantly higher, than the respective reference ranges with gestation. Fetal blood sampling by cordocentesis was performed in all SGA fetuses and a significant quadratic relation was found between fetal hypoxaemia and the degree of reduction in the PI of FVWs from the fetal middle cerebral artery. Thus, maximum reduction in PI is reached when the fetal PO2 is 2-4 SD below the normal mean for gestation. When the oxygen deficit is greater there is a tendency for the PI to rise, and this presumably reflects the development of brain oedema. 
5	Venomous snakebite in eastern Ecuador. Treatment outcome of 294 hospitalized victims of snakebite injuries in Eastern Ecuador are reported, documenting high rates of morbidity and mortality. One or more major complications occurred in 25% of patients. Complications included blood loss severe enough to require transfusion (29 patients), abscess (26 patients), intracranial hemorrhage (15 patients) and major tissue loss (10 patients). Sixteen patients died, yielding a mortality rate of 5.4%. Death resulted from intracranial hemorrhage in 12 patients and from sequelae of hypovolemic shock in 4 patients. 
5	Pressure measurements from biliary and pancreatic segments of sphincter of Oddi. Comparison between patients with functional abdominal pain, biliary, or pancreatic disease. Using a minimally compliant infusion system and a triple-lumen pressure recording catheter, we obtained endoscopic manometric measurements from both the common bile duct and pancreatic duct segments of the sphincter of Oddi (SO) in 58 patients. Fifteen patients (ages 27-69) had the diagnosis of functional abdominal pain, 19 patients (ages 30-76) had partial biliary obstruction, and 24 patients (ages 15-80) had idiopathic acute recurrent pancreatitis. Resting ductal pressure was similar in the common bile duct and pancreatic duct in all patient groups. In the group with functional pain, basal SO pressure was similar, whether obtained from the common bile duct or pancreatic duct sphincteric segment. Eight of 19 patients with partial biliary obstruction had elevated basal SO pressure. Five of these eight patients had elevated basal SO pressure confined exclusively to the common bile duct segment of the sphincter, while three patients had elevated basal SO in both segments. Conversely seven of 24 patients with acute recurrent pancreatitis had an elevated basal SO pressure, with five patients having pressure elevation only in the pancreatic duct segment while two patients had abnormal basal SO pressure in both segments. We conclude that selective cannulation of the common bile duct and/or the pancreatic duct during manometric study of the SO is necessary in order to diagnose segmental SO dysfunction responsible for partial biliary obstruction or episodes of acute recurrent pancreatitis. 
2	Stomal adenocarcinoma in Crohn's disease. Malignant change occurring at the site of a stoma in two patients with proved Crohn's disease is described. Patients with ulcerative colitis have an increased risk of colonic malignancy and Crohn's disease is also associated with both small and large bowel carcinoma. Most previous reports of stomal carcinoma have been associated with ulcerative colitis although Crohn's disease seems to carry a greater risk of associated small bowel carcinomas. This is the first report of stomal carcinoma complicating Crohn's disease. Epithelial dysplasia is associated with gastrointestinal carcinomas in both ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease and a dysplasia-carcinoma sequence has been suggested as the origin of these tumours. In both our patients with stomal adenocarcinoma, dysplasia was identified in adjacent tissues, which suggests a similar mechanism. Malignant change should be suspected if epithelial dysplasia is discovered in a biopsy specimen from the mucosa of an ileostomy in Crohn's disease, and this risk is increased if the dysplasia is of a high grade. 
5	Endosonography of peri-anal and peri-colorectal fistula and/or abscess in Crohn's disease. Transcolorectal endosonography (ES) was performed in 36 patients with Crohn's disease suspected clinically to have a fistula or abscess. A hypoechoic or anechoic duct-like lesion immediately adjacent to the anorectal lumen compatible with a fistula was found in 32 patients. A communication between the fistulous tract and adjacent structures such as the skin, anal canal, or vagina was detected in all 32 patients. An anechoic cavity adjacent to or communicating with the fistula was visualized in 29 of the 36 patients. A fistula was visualized in the remaining seven patients with no evidence of an abscess. This anechoic cavity compatible with an abscess was surgically confirmed in 14 of 17 patients. We judged the extent and configuration of the abnormalities to be more clearly visualized by ES when results were compared with fistulography in five patients. There were no ES complications, and we conclude that ES is the preferred diagnostic procedure in patients with peri-rectal pathology because of the low risk of bacterial dissemination and low incidence of patient discomfort. Utilizing ES after non-surgical treatment was successful in 19 patients for documentation of the response to therapy. 
3	Botulinum treatment of childhood strabismus. Four hundred thirteen children ranging in age from 2 months to 12 years were treated for strabismus by botulinum injection of extraocular muscles. An average of 1.7 injections per patient was given. Follow-up at an average of 26 months after the last injection (minimum, 6 months) was available on 362 children (88%). The frequency of correction of 10 prism diopters (PD) or less in various groups of strabismus cases was: all 362 cases, 61%; all esotropia, 66%; infantile esotropia, 65%; and exotropia, 45%. Smaller deviations (10-20 PD) were more frequently corrected (73%) than were larger deviations (20-110 PD, 54%). The frequency of correction to 10 PD or less of previously operated cases was not different from that of unoperated cases. There was no globe perforation, amblyopia, or visual loss produced by the injection treatment in this series. 
2	Association of Escherichia coli HEp-2 adherence patterns with type and duration of diarrhoea. 373 (59%) out of 636 faecal specimens obtained during the first 2 years of life of 72 Mexican children yielded adherent Escherichia coli (HEp-2 cells). Strains with localised adherence were significantly associated with acute non-bloody diarrhoea, whereas strains with aggregative adherence were significantly associated with persistent diarrhoea. Half the strains with localised adherence were not enteropathogenic E coli serotypes nor did they hybridise with an enteropathogenic E coli adherence factor DNA probe. All strains with localised adherence gave a positive fluorescent actin staining (FAS) assay, irrespective of serotype. One-third of children colonised by aggregative strains had bloody diarrhoea. Isolation of strains with diffuse adherence was not related to type or duration of diarrhoea but was generally associated with isolation of another pathogenic organism. 
5	Atonic pupil: an unusual complication of cataract surgery. Eight cases of atonic pupil, an unusual complication following cataract surgery, are presented. Six of the eyes involved had intracapsular cataract extraction and anterior chamber intraocular lens implantation; one case underwent extracapsular cataract extraction with a posterior chamber intraocular lens implantation; the other had an extracapsular procedure with no implant. The etiology is unknown, but we believe the most likely one is that the sodium hyaluronate used in all these patients caused a temporary reduction of the iris blood supply by mechanical factors or by a vasoconstriction induced by some toxicity of the material that produced a lesion on the iris sphincter. 
5	Enantiomers of oxybutynin: in vitro pharmacological characterization at M1, M2 and M3 muscarinic receptors and in vivo effects on urinary bladder contraction, mydriasis and salivary secretion in guinea pigs. The major side effects of racemic oxybutynin (OXY), which is used in the treatment of urinary incontinence are dry mouth (xerostomia) and blurred vision (mydriasis). Highly purified enantiomers of OXY [(R)OXY, (S)OXY] were compared with the racemate both in vitro in functional studies and in vivo in guinea pigs to evaluate their pharmacological action relative to their adverse effects. The affinity of (R)OXY and (S)OXY for different muscarinic receptor subtypes was determined using field stimulated rabbit vas deferens (M1) and guinea pig atria (M2) or bladder (M3) strips. Stereoselective antimuscarinic effects [(R)OXY greater than or equal to (R/S) OXY much greater than (S)OXY] were evident at all three receptor subtypes; the isomeric ratio [(S)OXY/(R)OXY] ranged from 12 to 88. Both (R)OXY and (R/S)OXY were slightly more selective (2-4-fold, P less than .01) for M1 and M3 relative to M2 muscarinic receptors. Stereoselectivity was also evident in vivo for volume-induced urinary bladder contractions as measured by cystometrogram parameters [(S)OXY/(R)OXY approximately 21], mydriasis [(S)OXY/(R)OXY approximately 136] and salivary gland secretory responses [(S)OXY/(R)OXY approximately 30]. The absolute potencies of (R)OXY or (R/S)OXY for mydriasis and salivation were similar to those for inhibition of intravesical bladder pressure. Also, (R)OXY and (R/S)OXY equipotently antagonized cholinergic-mediated CNS effects in mice. Collectively, the data suggest that the activity of (R/S)OXY resides predominantly in the (R)-enantiomer. However, it appears that (R)OXY may offer no significant pharmacological advantage over (R/S)OXY in terms of its principal therapeutic and side effect profile. 
2	Spinal epidural abscess: an unusual complication of a duodenal ulcer. A 50-year-old man had several months of progressively worse low-back pain associated with constitutional symptoms and a history of retroperitoneal tumor and bleeding duodenal ulcer. Initial evaluation suggested a lumbar spine tumor, but myelography confirmed the presence of an epidural abscess. Further evaluation revealed a duodeno-spinal fistula at the site of the previous duodenal ulcer, which proved to be the cause of the abscess. 
5	Cytomegalovirus colitis in AIDS: presentation in 44 patients and a review of the literature. As part of a double-blind, placebo-controlled study of ganciclovir in cytomegalovirus (CMV) colitis, the clinical characteristics of 44 patients enrolled at one center were analyzed in detail. All were homosexual men who had CMV on colonic biopsy. CMV colitis was the index diagnosis for acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) in 11 (25%) of the 44 patients. All had diarrhea, but it was intermittent in 13 patients (30%). Bleeding was uncommon, but 35 patients (80%) were febrile (median temperature of 38.9 degrees C). Weight loss was reported by 39 patients (89%), among whom the median loss was 6.8 kg. Endoscopy revealed normal colonic mucosa but CMV on biopsy in 11 patients (25%). Colonoscopic biopsies positive for CMV were found only in the cecum in 7 (39%) of 18 patients. Most patients (54%) had received zidovudine before the diagnosis of CMV colitis. The median time to the development of CMV colitis after the diagnosis of AIDS was 16 months in those patients who had received zidovudine and 3 months in those who had not (p less than 0.02). We conclude that CMV colitis can present early in AIDS and often with such nonspecific signs as fever, intermittent diarrhea, weight loss, and hematochezia. Importantly, it can appear normal on colonoscopy and occurs frequently only in the right colon, necessitating full colonoscopy and multiple biopsies for accurate diagnosis. 
5	Metastatic tumors of the umbilicus: a review 1830-1989. Umbilical metastases from known and unknown primary cancers are rare. The eponym "Sister Mary Joseph's nodule" has been used by generations of physicians. The first reports of this clinical sign were from Walshe in 1846. A review of the literature revealed 265 cases from then until 1989. Only 85 cases of umbilical metastasis from unknown primary tumors were found. This review should help us to focus on the common and uncommon primary sites in the diagnosis of patients with this finding. A single case report and the work-up for the hidden primary tumor are described. 
2	Effects of indomethacin on hepatogenic pulmonary angiodysplasia. A patient had liver cirrhosis associated with marked hypoxemia. With administration of indomethacin (75 mg/day for six days), PaO2 was elevated up to 50 mm Hg from 44 mm Hg. At that time, dynamic pulmonary perfusion imaging revealed a plateau time course curve of MAA uptake in the lungs, as compared with findings obtained during the state of severe hypoxemia without indomethacin. These observations suggest that part of hepatogenic pulmonary angiodysplasia is a functional vasodilatation that is presumably modulated by vasoactive substances, such as prostaglandins and/or other eicosanoids. 
1	Ring neutrophils in plasma cell dyscrasia. Sporadic reports in the medical literature concern the significant incidence of neutrophils with ring-shaped nuclei in myeloproliferative disorders. We report our first encounter with ring neutrophils in patients with lymphoproliferative disorders. A significant incidence of ring neutrophils was observed in all of 20 patients with multiple myeloma and in nine of 10 patients with monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance. The mean percent of ring neutrophils was 9.5% (range, 1.0% to 28.0%) in patients with multiple myeloma, which was significantly greater than in those with monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance or in healthy controls. In multiple myeloma, the incidence of ring neutrophils in the pretreatment phase was greater than that in the remission phase. A great deal of overlap was noted between multiple myeloma in the remission phase and monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance. The incidence of ring neutrophils seemed to vary according to disease stage. Ring neutrophils may reflect abnormal granulopoiesis in plasma cell dyscrasias. 
5	Comparative studies of DU-PAN-2, carcinoembryonic antigen, and CA19-9 in the serum and bile of patients with pancreatic and biliary tract diseases: evaluation of the influence of obstructive jaundice. The levels of DU-PAN-2 antigen, carcinoembryonic antigen, and CA19-9 in serum and bile of patients with pancreatic and biliary tract diseases were measured. The sensitivities (true positive) of DU-PAN-2 in serum to pancreatic carcinoma (64%) and to biliary tract carcinoma (62%) were similar to those of CA19-9 in serum (69% and 72%, respectively). Nine of 18 (50%) patients with CA19-9-negative pancreatic carcinoma tested positive for DU-PAN-2. The sensitivities of CEA to pancreatic carcinoma (56%) and to biliary tract carcinoma (52%) were lowest. The measurement of these antigens in bile seemed to be of little diagnostic value in differentiating between malignant and benign diseases. False positives of these three assays occurred frequently in patients with benign pancreatic or biliary tract disease coupled with obstructive jaundice. After percutaneous transhepatic biliary drainage, serum DU-PAN-2 and CA19-9 levels returned to normal ranges in patients with benign diseases, but not in patients with carcinoma of the pancreas or of the biliary tract. Serum CA19-9 and DU-PAN-2 antigens are useful tumor markers for pancreatic and biliary tract carcinomas. Longitudinal assays of these antigens may be useful for the differential diagnosis of patients with obstructive jaundice. 
1	Ph-negative chronic myeloid leukemia: molecular analysis of ABL insertion into M-BCR on chromosome 22. Leukemic cells from a patient with Ph-negative chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) had a normal karyotype. M-BCR was rearranged and chromosome in situ hybridization showed an ABL insertion between 5' and 3' M-BCR on an apparently normal chromosome 22. The association of 5' BCR and 3' ABL at the 5' junction of the chromosome 9 insert was typical of that found for the BCR-ABL fusion gene in other patients with the standard t(9;22) and CML. With an M-bcr-3' probe, we cloned and characterized a 3' junction fragment. Field inversion gel electrophoresis and chromosome in situ hybridization studies using a probe isolated from genomic DNA 5' of the junction showed that 3' M-BCR was joined to a region of chromosome 9q34 rich in repetitive sequences and lying some distance 3' of ABL. The chromosome 9 insert was at least 329 kilobases long and included 3' ABL and a larger portion of chromosome 9q34. Our results allowed us to exclude transposon- or retroviral-mediated insertion of ABL into chromosome 22. Instead, we favored a two-translocation model in which a second translocation reconstituted a standard t(9;22)(q34;q11) but left the chromosome 9 insert, including 3' ABL, in chromosome 22. 
1	Immunoreactivity and receptor expression of insulinlike growth factor I and insulin in human adrenal tumors. An immunohistochemical study of 94 cases. Using immunoperoxidase methods, 94 human adrenal tumors were examined for evidence of immunoreactivity and receptor expression of insulinlike growth factor I (IGF-I) and insulin. The frequency of IGF-I in adrenocortical carcinomas was significantly higher than that in adenomas of the adrenal glands. The adrenocortical carcinomas showed strong intensity of staining for IGF-I, IGF-I receptors, and insulin receptors. A significant correlation between immunoreactivity and receptor expression of both IGF-I and insulin was found only in the adrenocortical carcinomas. The adrenocortical adenomas with Cushing's syndrome and pheochromocytomas, more than adrenocortical adenomas with Conn's syndrome, also stained strongly for insulin receptors. Thus the IGF-I and insulin probably play a role in the growth of adrenocortical carcinoma tissues, possibly through autocrine mechanisms. The expression of insulin receptors in adrenocortical adenomas in the presence of Cushing's syndrome and pheochromocytomas may be associated with functions. 
4	The erythrocyte sedimentation rate in congestive heart failure. BACKGROUND AND METHODS. Physicians have long believed that the erythrocyte sedimentation rate is low in patients with congestive heart failure, but this concept is based on a misinterpretation of the results in a single report published in 1936. To reevaluate this concept in the modern era, we measured the sedimentation rate in 242 patients who were referred for treatment of chronic heart failure. RESULTS. The sedimentation rate was low (less than 5 mm per hour) in only 24 patients (10 percent) but was increased (above 25 mm per hour) in 50 percent. Patients with low or normal sedimentation rates (less than or equal to 25 mm per hour) had more severe hemodynamic abnormalities than patients with elevated rates: lower cardiac index (mean +/- SEM, 1.7 +/- 0.1 vs. 2.0 +/- 0.1 liters per minute per square meter of body-surface area) and higher mean right atrial pressure (mean +/- SEM, 12 +/- 1 vs. 9 +/- 1 mm Hg) (both P less than 0.0001). New York Heart Association functional class IV symptoms were present in 66 percent of the patients with a low or normal sedimentation rate, as compared with 42 percent of those with elevated rates (P less than 0.0001). After one to three months of therapy, patients whose sedimentation rates decreased showed little hemodynamic or clinical response to treatment, whereas both cardiac performance and functional status improved in patients whose rates increased (P less than 0.02 for the comparison between groups). The sedimentation rate was correlated with the plasma fibrinogen level (r = 0.64, P = 0.0025), and changes in the sedimentation rate during treatment were correlated inversely with changes in mean right atrial pressure (r = -0.57, P = 0.0002). During long-term follow-up, patients with low or normal sedimentation rates had a worse one-year survival than patients with elevated rates (41 vs. 66 percent, P = 0.01). CONCLUSIONS. These data indicate that the erythrocyte sedimentation rate is correlated with the severity of illness in patients with chronic heart failure. Because of its lack of discriminatory power, however, the test is of limited value in the clinical management of this disorder. 
5	Effect of dipyridamole (Persantin) on blood flow and patency of aortocoronary vein bypass grafts. The effect of dipyridamole was investigated in 360 patients undergoing coronary bypass surgery. They were randomly allocated to receive dipyridamole (100 mg orally q.i.d. for 2 days preoperatively, 5 mg/kg body weight/24 h i.v. peroperatively and 100 mg orally q.i.d. for 1 year postoperatively) or placebo. Withdrawn from the study were 48 patients on dipyridamole and 57 on placebo. Cardiovascular and/or cerebrovascular events or need for anticoagulant treatment were the reasons for withdrawal in 22 (13%) of the dipyridamole, and 34 (18%) of the placebo group. Logistic regression analysis of risk factors influencing graft patency showed significant relation to peroperatively measured coronary blood flow. A positive trend of treatment was observed (p = 0.08). Vein graft blood flow measured during bypass surgery (245 patients) was significantly greater in the dipyridamole group (p less than 0.01). The occlusion rate was lower in vessels with peroperative blood flow greater than 30 ml/min (vein-marginal p less than 0.01, vein-dexter p less than 0.05, vein-diagonal 0.05 less than p less than 0.1). Dipyridamole increases coronary blood flow and graft patency following coronary bypass surgery. 
2	Jejunal immunoglobulin and antigliadin antibody secretion in adult coeliac disease. We compared the local intestinal immunoglobulin (Ig) secretion in six adult patients with coeliac disease and nine control subjects by perfusion of a small bowel segment under an occluding balloon and analysis of the perfusion fluid for the content of Ig and secretory component. The results were compared to the number of Ig-containing plasma cells in the test segment. There was, respectively, a two-fold and a fivefold increase in jejunal secretion rates of IgA (both monomeric and polymeric) and IgM in patients with coeliac disease compared with control subjects. The high IgA and IgM secretion rates parallel the increase of Ig-containing plasma cells in the lamina propria. In contrast, the IgG plasma cell density increase was barely significant in patients with coeliac disease and did not result in a high IgG secretion rate. The jejunal secretion rate of secretory component was significantly increased in patients with coeliac disease and no free dimeric IgA was present in the jejunal fluid. Antigliadin-IgA was detected in the serum and jejunal fluid of the six patients with coeliac disease. Antigliadin-IgA, however, was almost entirely polymeric IgA linked to secretory component in jejunal fluid, whereas 61% was dimeric IgA not linked to secretory component in serum. This result, combined with a raised secretory component secretion rate with no evidence of secretory component saturation, suggests that serum and intestinal antigliadin IgA might be of different origins in coeliac disease. 
3	Total knee arthroplasty in patients after patellectomy. Twenty-six total knee arthroplasties (TKAs) were evaluated in 22 patients who had had a patellectomy. Fourteen knees (12 patients) had a primary TKA, and 12 patients had a revision TKA. Two patients in the revision group, whose prostheses failed, were from the primary TKA group. The mean follow-up time was 8.5 years in the primary TKA group and 7.6 years in the revision TKA group. A group of 14 control knees with patellae was randomly generated but matched for prosthesis, diagnosis, surgeon, age, and time of surgery. This group was similarly evaluated with an average follow-up time of 6.9 years. The primary TKA group had seven knees that were rated as good or excellent, two as fair, and three as poor. The control group had a significantly higher average rating than the primary TKA group. In this group, there were 12 good or excellent knees, three fair, and none poor. Postoperative pain, flexion contracture, extension lag, and range of motion all contributed significant information to the final score, whereas other variables (walking, function, strength, and instability) did not contribute any additional information. Although higher overall scores may have been expected if the patients had patellae, the results during the follow-up examination were satisfactory and justified TKA in these patients. In general, however, patients without patellae may be at a higher risk for failure of the prosthesis, as seen in five patients having primary TKA and another ten patients with failed TKA requiring revision. 
1	Non-AIDS-associated Kaposi's sarcoma (classical and endemic African types): treatment with low doses of recombinant interferon-alpha. In the treatment of the classical and endemic African forms of Kaposi's sarcoma (KS), radiation therapy and chemotherapy have been widely used with varying degrees of success and morbidity. We here report our preliminary experiences with low doses of recombinant interferon alfa-2b (rIFN alpha-2b) in the treatment of these types of KS, non-linked to the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS). Ten consecutive patients (eight patients with classical and two with endemic KS) with a median age of 62 years were treated long-term with 5 X 10(6) units of rIFN alpha-2b (Introna) given subcutaneously three times weekly for at least 6 months. Of the 10 patients, six presented with cutaneous disease only, and four had additional visceral involvement. After 6 months of treatment, seven of the 10 patients had a major response of the cutaneous lesions, and three patients showed stable skin diseases. Of the four patients with additional visceral disease, one patient showed a complete regression of an intramyocardial tumor involving the right atrium and ventricle, whereas in the three other patients stabilization of the visceral lesions with marked symptomatic improvement occurred. On the whole, the long-term results over a median duration of 12 months (range, 7 to 30) are also satisfactory: IFN-alpha continued to control KS in all patients. The treatment was generally well tolerated; no serious side effects were observed. Our preliminary data suggest that low-dose rIFN alpha-2b regimens are effective in classical and endemic African KS. However, further studies are needed to establish the exact role for IFN-alpha as alternative to radiation and chemotherapy. 
1	Zinc and copper in breast cancer. A joint study in northern Italy and southern France. The relationship between breast cancer and two trace elements, zinc (Zn) and copper (Cu), was investigated by means of an hospital based case-control study at Milan (Italy) and Montpellier (France). Variables concerning dietary intake of Zn and Cu (in Milan) and their blood levels (both in Milan and Montpellier) were measured. Dietary intake, evaluated through a questionnaire of the dietary history type, and blood levels of Zn and Cu were measured in 261 cases and 261 controls. Cu blood level showed a contradictory tendency in the two samples (higher in controls in Milan, higher in cases in Montpellier), which tended to lessen after adjustment for related variables. No odds ratios (OR) in the different quantiles, nor X2 for trend reached statistical significance. A sharp difference was evidenced on the opposite with regard to Zn blood values in cases and controls. In both samples Zn mean values are significantly higher in cases than in controls, and the difference remains significant in the two samples even after adjustment for related variables. The pooled OR computed from the two samples, after adjustment for known risk factors and related variables, reaches in the fourth quartile a value of 9.5 (CI: 4.9-18.2). Dietary intake of the two minerals (measured only in Milan sample) showed no difference between cases and controls, but a stronger relationship between dietary and blood Zn was evidenced in cases with respect to controls. The authors suggest that the higher Zn level in cases might be related with an higher incorporation of Zn in cancer cases and that the same mineral might play a possible role in tumor growth promotion. 
3	Visual recovery in patients with optic neuritis and visual loss to no light perception. We reviewed the records of 151 patients with optic neuritis examined over an eight-year period. Of these patients, 12 developed visual acuity of no light perception during the first episode of optic neuritis in the affected eye. Eight of the 12 patients recovered visual acuity of 20/40 or better. Of these, five patients had visual acuity of 20/20 or better, one had visual acuity of 20/25, one had visual acuity of 20/30, and one had visual acuity of 20/40. Four of the 12 patients recovered peripheral visual fields but had dense central scotomas and visual acuity of less than 20/400. Dyschromatopsia persisted after visual recovery in 11 of 12 patients. 
4	Single photon emission computed tomography with thallium-201 during adenosine-induced coronary hyperemia: correlation with coronary arteriography, exercise thallium imaging and two-dimensional echocardiography The feasibility, safety and diagnostic accuracy of single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) with thallium-201 imaging during adenosine-induced coronary hyperemia were evaluated in 53 patients with and 7 without coronary artery disease proved by coronary angiography. Adenosine was infused intravenously at a dose of 0.14 mg/kg body weight per min for 6 min and thallium was injected at 3 min. Adenosine caused an increase in heart rate (68 +/- 12 at baseline versus 87 +/- 18 beats/min at peak effect, p less than 0.0001) but no change in blood pressure. The sensitivity and specificity were 92% (95% confidence intervals 81% to 98%) and 100% (95% confidence intervals 59% to 100%), respectively; 20 (61%) of 33 patients with multivessel coronary artery disease were also correctly identified. In 30 patients, the predictive accuracy of adenosine thallium imaging was slightly higher than that of exercise SPECT thallium imaging (90% versus 80%, p = NS) (95% confidence intervals 72% to 97% and 61% to 92%, respectively). In 25 patients, two-dimensional echocardiography during adenosine infusion disclosed a new wall motion abnormality in 2 (10%) of 20 patients with coronary artery disease; 80% of these patients had reversible thallium defects (p less than 0.001). Side effects were mild and transient; aminophylline was used in only three patients. Thus, adenosine SPECT thallium imaging provides a high degree of accuracy in the diagnosis of coronary artery disease. The results are comparable with those of exercise SPECT thallium imaging. Most reversible defects in the adenosine study are not associated with any transient wall motion abnormality. 
3	Analysis of programmed stimulation methods in the evaluation of ventricular arrhythmias in patients 20 years old and younger. The purpose of this study was to systematically evaluate programmed ventricular stimulation in patients less than 21 years of age undergoing electrophysiologic testing. A standardized protocol was applied in 55 consecutive patients (mean age 14 years) with the following clinical presentations: sustained ventricular tachycardia (VT) (n = 17); ventricular fibrillation (VF) (n = 7); syncope with heart disease (n = 10); nonsustained VT (n = 6); and syncope with an ostensibly normal heart (n = 15). The stimulation protocol consisted of 1 and 2 ventricular extrastimuli during sinus rhythm, followed by 1 to 4 (S2, S3, S4, S5) extrastimuli during pacing at 2 ventricular sites. Of the 17 patients with sustained VT, 12 had induction of the arrhythmia (sensitivity = 71%). Overall, 18 of 55 patients had inducible sustained VT, with this response significantly enhanced by use of S4 or S5 protocols (p = 0.02). Although no syncope patients with an ostensibly normal heart had inducible sustained VT, 7 had polymorphic nonsustained VT in response to ventricular stimulation. The mean number of extra-stimuli preceding the induction of nonsustained or sustained VT or VF did not differ. The induction of VF in 5 cases during this study was preceded in each case by extrastimuli intervals less than or equal to 190 ms. Thus, data indicate that aggressive stimulation protocols appear to be required for induction of sustained VT in most young patients, nonsustained polymorphic VT as a response to aggressive programmed stimulation is of uncertain significance, and that coupling intervals less than or equal to 190 ms may correlate with the induction of VF. 
4	Nonsurgical treatment of Histoplasma endocarditis involving a bioprosthetic valve. Endocardial involvement associated with disseminated histoplasmosis has been infrequently documented, especially among patients with prosthetic valves. The therapeutic approach to these patients is also not yet clearly defined. A 54-year-old man with prosthetic valve endocarditis due to histoplasmosis was successfully treated with amphotericin B. A review of the literature suggests that the optimal form of therapy is likely a combination of surgical replacement of the involved valve and high dose amphotericin B. Successful therapy with amphotericin B alone may, however, be achieved if surgery is not a viable option. 
2	Effects of common illnesses on infants' energy intakes from breast milk and other foods during longitudinal community-based studies in Huascar (Lima), Peru. To assess the effects of common infections on dietary intake, 131 Peruvian infants were observed longitudinally. Home surveillance for illness symptoms was completed thrice weekly, and food and breast-milk consumption was measured during 1615 full-day observations. Mean (+/- SD) energy intakes on symptom-free days were 557 +/- 128 kcal/d (92.4 +/- 26.5 kcal.kg-1.d-1) for infants aged less than 181 d and 638 +/- 193 kcal/d (77.7 +/- 25.7 kcal.kg-1.d-1) for infants aged greater than 180 d. Statistical models controlling for infant age, season of the year, and individual showed significant 5-6% decreases in total energy intake during diarrhea or fever. There were no changes with illness in the frequency of breast-feeding, total suckling time, or amount of breast-milk energy consumed. By contrast, energy intake from non-breast-milk sources decreased by 20-30% during diarrhea and fever, and the small decrements in total energy consumption during illness were explained entirely by reduced consumption of non-breast-milk foods. 
5	Complications of general anesthesia for Nd:YAG laser resection of endobronchial tumors. We studied the incidence and mechanisms of cardiovascular complications and postoperative respiratory insufficiency associated with GA and Nd:YAG laser endobronchial tumor resection. The records of 73 patients undergoing 87 procedures were reviewed. Preoperative status, anesthetic methods and perioperative complications were analyzed by multiple regression to determine predictors of outcome. Twenty-three percent of patients had greater than 90 percent mainstem bronchus obstruction. Longer serum elimination half-life of relaxant drug was significantly correlated with longer duration of mechanical ventilation after neuromuscular blockade reversal. Cardiovascular complications were noted in 24 procedures and often required therapeutic intervention. Variables predicting cardiovascular complications included longer duration of GA and increasing age. Perioperative respiratory and cardiovascular complications are common after GA for Nd: YAG laser resection. Short-acting neuromuscular relaxants, careful assessment prior to postoperative extubation, limiting duration of GA and cardiovascular monitoring are recommended when implementing GA for Nd: YAG laser resection of endobronchial tumors. 
3	No confirmation of visual evoked potential diagnostic test for migraine. We have attempted to replicate the results of studies on a diagnostic test reported to have 90% sensitivity and 89-96% specificity for migraine. The technique is based on peak-to-peak measurements of fast background electroencephalographic activity during a visual evoked potential (VEP) study. VEP latencies and amplitudes did not differ significantly, and showed substantial overlap, between a group of eight migraine patients and ten age-matched healthy controls. We could not recognise previously described fast activity or measure it objectively by peak-to-peak measurements. We cannot confirm that measurement of fast wave activity in the VEP background is useful in diagnosis of migraine. 
5	Hypothermia. Safe and efficient methods of rewarming the patient. Hypothermia, a relatively common problem in the winter months, can cause significant morbidity. It presents in a variety of situations and affects a wide age range. Diagnosis requires a high index of suspicion, because the symptoms, which are primarily related to the central nervous system, are not distinctive. Appropriate management requires accurate measurement of core body temperature. Treatment is centered on rewarming the patient safely and efficiently while providing other supportive measures. Care should be taken to avoid arrhythmias. Simple precautions greatly reduce the risk of hypothermia. 
1	Gonadoblastoma in an anatomically normal man: a case report and literature review. Gonadoblastoma, a rare gonadal neoplasm, presents most frequently in phenotypic female or phenotypically male patients with dysgenetic gonads or undescended testes. To date, only 2 cases of gonadoblastoma have been reported in anatomically normal male patients with scrotal testes. Both of these patients presented with testicular masses and germ cell tumors. We report a case of a genotypically and phenotypically normal, fertile man with descended testes who on evaluation for chronic orchialgia had a gonadoblastoma unaccompanied by a germ cell neoplasm. The tumor was nonpalpable and was initially discovered on scrotal ultrasound. 
3	Hyponatraemia secondary to an inappropriately high release of antidiuretic hormone in cardiac tamponade. A spontaneous intrapericardial haemorrhage caused cardiac tamponade in a 29 year old paraplegic man who was being treated with warfarin. The associated persistent hyponatraemia, which was believed to be caused by an inappropriately high release of antidiuretic hormone, rapidly resolved after pericardiocentesis. 
4	Lower extremity arterial disease in systemic lupus erythematosus. Lupus vasculitis primarily affects microvascular circulation, and large-vessel thrombosis is a rare complication of this disease. Large-vessel occlusive disease in systemic lupus erythematosus is most likely related to hypercoagulability in addition to immune complex-mediated endothelial damage. We describe the 11th and 12th patients reported to have systemic lupus erythematosus and macrovascular occlusive disease of the lower extremities. Our experience and a review of the literature suggest that, while aortoiliac disease is amenable to bypass or endarterectomy, infrainguinal disease is rarely correctable surgically, and amputation becomes necessary in most of these patients. 
3	A clinical triad to diagnose paraneoplastic retinopathy. Two elderly men developed photosensitivity and light-induced glare, transient visual symptoms, and progressive visual loss several months before small cell carcinoma of the lung was discovered. Both patients had impaired visual acuity and color vision, ring scotomas, and attenuated retinal arteriole caliber. Electroretinography demonstrated abnormal cone and rod-mediated responses. Antiretinal antibodies were identified in their serum. Their visual sensory function improved following therapy with immunosuppressive agents. The triad of photosensitivity, ring scotomatous visual field loss, and attenuated retinal arteriole caliber should alert one to a paraneoplastic disorder affecting the retina. 
4	Spontaneous myocardial ischemia and the signal-averaged electrocardiogram. The effects of transient myocardial ischemia on the signal-averaged electrocardiogram were investigated in 13 patients with coronary artery disease and spontaneous angina undergoing 3-channel ambulatory electrocardiography. Ischemia was seen as ST elevation in 2 patients or ST depression in 11; it was anterior in 5 patients, inferior in 4 and undefined in 4. Signal-averaged electrocardiograms with noise levels less than or equal to 1 microV were obtained from Holter tapes during 54 of 61 ischemic attacks recorded in the study group (88%), and compared with 54 tracings recorded within 60 minutes of the index attacks. Baseline tracings were normal in 8 patients (62%), showed a long QRS duration in 2 (15%), and both a long QRS duration and a late potential in the remaining 3 (23%). Comparison of recordings at baseline and during ischemic attacks revealed no significant changes in signal-averaged electrocardiographic parameters. Absence of significant differences was also noted when analysis was performed according to the type of ischemic attacks (associated with ST elevation [n = 14] or ST depression [n = 40]), their location (anterior [n = 21] or inferior [n = 23]), their duration (greater than 10 minutes [n = 29] or less than or equal to 10 minutes [n = 25]), and their magnitude (greater than 2 mm [n = 18] or less than or equal to 2 mm [n = 36]). It is concluded that spontaneous transient myocardial ischemia, independent of its type, location, duration and magnitude, does not generate a substrate for late potentials on the signal-averaged electrocardiogram. 
4	Coronary vascular remodeling and myocardial fibrosis in the rat with renovascular hypertension. Response to captopril. Progressive myocardial fibrosis, including the accumulation of collagen within the adventitia of intramyocardial coronary arteries, is seen in the hypertrophied rat myocardium secondary to renovascular hypertension (RHT) and has been held responsible for alterations in myocardial diastolic stiffness. This study was undertaken to test the hypothesis that this presumptive angiotensin-aldosterone mediated fibrosis and its functional consequences could be favorably altered by an antihypertensive oral dose (50 mg/kg/day) of the angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor captopril. Three groups were studied: control; untreated RHT for 8 weeks; treated RHT, with captopril started 48 h before banding and continued for 8 weeks. Interstitial collagen volume fraction and perivascular collagen area (morphometry), the fibrillar nature of collagen (picrosirius polarization), and the end diastolic stress-strain relation of the intact left ventricle were examined in each group. In comparison to untreated animals with RHT, we found that captopril, begun prior to banding, attenuated interstitial and perivascular fibrosis and prevented hypertrophy and the rise in diastolic stiffness 8 weeks later. Thus, an adverse accumulation of collagen in the interstitium and around intramyocardial coronary arteries, and its functional consequences in the rat with RHT, can be prevented by captopril. Other ACE inhibitors may have similar salutary effects, but remain to be evaluated. The pathogenetic origin of myocardial fibrosis in RHT requires further investigation, but appears to be related to the angiotensin-aldosterone system. 
5	Lymphoedema/hypercalcaemia syndrome mediated by parathyroid-hormone-related protein. A 24-year-old woman presented with a cryptogenic, hypercalcaemic syndrome with metastatic pulmonary calcification and leg and massive breast enlargement and bilateral chylous pleural effusions compatible with a generalised lymphatic abnormality. The patient's serum parathyroid hormone-related protein concentration was very high at a time when she was significantly hypercalcaemic, implying that the hypercalcaemia was mediated by this protein. 
5	Elevation of the petrous bone caused by hyperplasia of the occipital bone presenting as hemifacial spasm: diagnostic values of magnetic resonance imaging and three-dimensional computed tomographic images in a bone anomaly. A case of elevation of the petrous bone due to hyperplasia of the occipital bone presenting as hemifacial spasm is reported. A 44-year-old man sought treatment for twitching of the buccal muscles on the right side that progressed rapidly in severity within 2 weeks of the onset. The anatomical details of the petrous and occipital bones were delineated clearly by computed tomographic scans of a bone window level. Details of the brain stem were shown by magnetic resonance images. The bone anomaly was displayed more realistically by three-dimensional computed tomographic reconstructions. The faithful representation of structures with these radiological studies should be mandatory, to prepare the surgical planning of such a complicated bone anomaly. 
2	Dysphagia following fundoplication: "slipped" fundoplication versus achalasia complicated by fundoplication. Failure to obtain preoperative esophageal manometry in patients being considered for antireflux surgery can result in immediate persistent postoperative dysphagia due to a missed diagnosis of achalasia. We describe the clinical assessment and management of a case of delayed postoperative dysphagia due to a "slipped" fundoplication, which is contrasted with three patients with immediate postoperative dysphagia due to a missed diagnosis of achalasia. Surgical revision was required to correct the "slipped" fundoplication, and pneumatic dilatation was successfully used in two of three cases of achalasia complicated by fundoplication. Careful preoperative esophageal evaluation with manometry is essential to rule out the presence of a primary esophageal motor disorder. 
5	Was CEPOD right? This retrospective study found that the long-term (greater than 6 months) postoperative survival in ASA 4E and 5E patients was 41% and 21% respectively, in 1986. This supports the Confidential Enquiry into Peri-operative Deaths' recommendation that life-saving surgery should not be withheld from patients who present in so serious a condition that they are unlikely to survive surgery. 
5	Cognitive deficits in children: adaptive behavior and treatment techniques. Impaired cognitive functioning impedes the development of age-appropriate adaptive behavior, thus adding to the burdens of many children with epilepsy. Detailed neuropsychological assessment can identify the underlying ability-related impairments that contribute to the adaptive behavior deficiencies evidenced, particularly in the home and school settings. This information can serve as the basis for a multidisciplinary treatment plan tailored to individual needs. Ideally, the need for such a treatment plan should be perceived early in childhood, so that it can be developed and applied preventively. The same remedial principles also apply in older children and are here set out in detail. 
4	Symptomatic pericardial effusion in lung cancer patients: the role of fluid cytology. During the years 1975-1988, twenty lung cancer patients with symptomatic pericardial effusion were treated conservatively at our center. Echocardiography demonstrated small pericardial effusion in 2 patients, medium size effusion in 3 patients and large amount of fluid in 15 patients. Fifteen patients developed cardiac tamponade; in three of these patients, this was the presenting manifestation of lung cancer. Pericardiocentesis resulted in prompt, though temporary, symptomatic relief in all patients. Fluid cytology demonstrated suspected malignant cells in 2 patients and malignant cells in 13 patients. Based on cytology, the diagnosis of adenocarcinoma was established in six patients, small cell carcinoma in three patients, and epidermoid carcinoma in one patient. All patients were dead within 9 months from the time of diagnosis of pericardial effusion; 17 died within less than 3 months. It is concluded that pericardial effusion in lung cancer is indicative of rapid tumor progression and short survival. Fluid cytology provides an immediate and accurate means of diagnosis. 
4	Occlusion of the brachial artery by thrombus dislodged from a traumatic aneurysm of the anterior humeral circumflex artery. The successful treatment of a brachial artery occlusion caused by a chronic embolizing aneurysm of the anterior humeral circumflex artery is described. In the case of embolizing axillary artery aneurysms, the best therapy is resection of the aneurysm followed by distal thromboembolectomy and vascular reconstruction by a saphenous vein segment. Prosthetic material should be reserved as a second choice. In this particular case successful therapy consisted of ligation of the anterior humeral circumflex artery proximal and distal to the aneurysm, resection of the aneurysm, and transcubital thromboembolectomy. 
3	Reinforcement of incontinent stools in the treatment of encopresis. In this paper, fecal incontinence and constipation were treated in two mentally retarded individuals using a novel intervention wherein incontinent stools were first rewarded in order to increase the frequency of bowel movements. This intervention was implemented only after more traditional pediatric and behavioral treatments were unsuccessful. The reinforcement of incontinent stools procedure resulted in an increase in both the frequency and the number of continent stools for both individuals. Hypotheses regarding the failure of previous treatments and the success of the current treatment are discussed as well as directions for future research. 
1	Repeat hepatic resection for primary and metastatic carcinoma of the liver. During the last 15 years, 19 patients underwent repeated hepatic resections for malignant lesions of the liver. The first hepatic resection had been performed four to 40 months earlier for treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma (nine patients) or hepatic metastases (ten patients), eight of which were of colorectal origin. Repeat resection was an extensive hepatectomy in six, a segmentectomy in six and a local excision in seven. In one patient, three wedge resections and, finally, hepatic transplantation were subsequently performed after an initial extended right lobectomy. The operative mortality rate was 5.2 per cent. The three year actuarial survival rate was 64 per cent after the second resection. 
3	Magnetic resonance imaging of facial nerve neuromas. Facial nerve neuromas are uncommon tumors often confused with other tumors of the temporal bone and cerebellopontine angle. Radiologically, it may be impossible to differentiate an intracanalicular facial nerve neuroma from an acoustic neuroma. We present three case reports of facial nerve neuromas arising within the internal auditory canal to show the important magnetic resonance imaging features of these tumors. One tumor extended into the cerebellopontine angle, middle cranial fossa, and middle ear. Another filled the internal auditory canal and extended through the cerebellopontine angle to the brain stem. The third occurred in a patient who had neurofibromatosis as well as numerous other intracranial tumors. We feel that gadolinium-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging provides the most useful information in the preoperative assessment of this disorder. 
3	Work and power in gait of stroke patients. Biomechanical analysis of the work and power patterns involved in gait provides insight into the nature of gait deficits and suggests methods for improvement. The purpose of this study was to describe the work and power characteristics during gait for both limbs of hemiplegic patients, and to determine the work and power variables related to self-selected speeds of walking. The gait of 30 ambulatory adults between the ages of 47 and 79 years was studied using two-dimensional cinematography and force-plate data in a link-segment model. About 40% of the positive work required for walking was performed by the muscles of the affected side. Major contributors were the ankle plantar flexors, hip flexors, and hip extensors. The results suggest interdependence between the limbs and between muscle groups of the same limb; a need for further research is indicated. 
5	Chromosome 15 uniparental disomy is not frequent in Angelman syndrome. Genetic imprinting has been implicated in the etiology of two clinically distinct but cytogenetically indistinguishable disorders--Angelman syndrome (AS) and Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS). This hypothesis is derived from two lines of evidence. First, while the molecular extents of de novo cytogenetic deletions of chromosome 15q11q13 in AS and PWS patients are the same, the deletions originate from different parental chromosomes. In AS, the deletion occurs in the maternally inherited chromosome 15, while in PWS the deletion is found in the paternally inherited chromosome 15. The second line of evidence comes from the deletion of an abnormal parental contribution of 15q11q13 in PWS patients without a cytogenetic and molecular deletion. These patients have two maternal copies and no paternal copy of 15q11q13 (maternal uniparental disomy) instead of one copy from each parent. By qualitative hybridization with chromosome 15q11q13 specific DNA markers, we have now examined DNA samples from 10 AS patients (at least seven of which are familial cases) with no cytogenetic or molecular deletion of chromosome 15q11q13. Inheritance of one maternal copy and one paternal copy of 15q11q13 was observed in each family, suggesting that paternal uniparental disomy of 15q11q13 is not responsible for expression of the AS phenotype in these patients. 
1	Spindle cell carcinoma of the lung. A clinicopathologic study of three cases. Two cases of monophasic spindle cell carcinomas and one case of adenosquamous carcinoma with the spindle cell component located in the lower respiratory tract are presented. In the biphasic tumor, areas of transition from carcinoma to sarcomatous spindle cells were clearly found. The two monophasic tumors and the spindle cell component of the biphasic tumor were histologically characterized by sheets of spindle cells. However, by electron microscopic and immunohistochemical study, several features of squamous epithelial differentiation were found in the spindle cell areas of all cases. Keratin and vimentin were, in various degrees, coexpressed in all the cases. Therefore, it is supposed that the spindle cell component displays a spectrum of phenotypes originating from squamous cell carcinoma, and monophasic spindle cell carcinoma is considered as a kind of the extreme phenotype of squamous cell carcinoma pretending mesenchymal differentiation. 
1	IL-2-PE40 prevents the development of tumors in mice injected with IL-2 receptor expressing EL4 transfectant tumor cells. A number of different immunotherapeutic reagents are currently being developed to target IL-2R for the treatment of leukemia, graft rejection, and certain autoimmune diseases. Previously, we have shown that IL-2-PE40, a chimeric protein composed of human IL-2 linked to the N-terminus of a truncated form of Pseudomonas exotoxin (PE), could effectively kill a variety of cell lines in vitro expressing either low, intermediate, or high affinity IL-2R. Here, we demonstrate that IL-2-PE40 can successfully retard or prevent the growth of a lethal ascites tumor or a solid tumor composed of EL4J murine thymoma cells transfected with the p55 murine IL-2R. The transfected line, EL4J-3.4, expresses 1,000 to 3,000 high affinity IL-2R. Survival extension in the ascites model was achieved by initiating treatment either after 4 to 6 h or within 5 days post-tumor injection in both athymic nude and C57BL/6 mice. Similarly, the growth of an aggressive s.c. solid tumor could also be inhibited. Extension of survival was not achieved either by using the truncated toxin alone not attached to IL-2 or by using an IL-2-PE40Asp553 mutant lacking a functional toxin. Survival extension was not caused by IL-2 activated NK or other host effector mechanisms as IL-2-PE40 was unable to prevent the receptor-negative EL4J parental line from forming a lethal ascites or a solid tumor. Thus, IL-2-PE40 is a potent, specific cytolytic reagent that may prove useful in the arsenal of anti-IL-2R immunotherapeutics. 
5	Small bowel enteroscopy and intraoperative enteroscopy for obscure gastrointestinal bleeding. Intraoperative endoscopy (IOE) is accepted as the ultimate diagnostic procedure for completely evaluating the small bowel in patients with obscure gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding. Small bowel enteroscopy (SBE) has been reported useful in the nonsurgical evaluation of the small intestine in these patients, but findings may be limited because of incomplete small bowel intubation and a lack of tip deflection. Twenty-three patients underwent 25 SBE exams and subsequently had 25 IOE exams during surgical exploration for continued bleeding. Patients' bleeding histories averaged 2 yr, with an average transfusion requirement of 27 units. Findings on IOE were the same as with SBE in 17/22 (77%) of examinations. We conclude that SBE and IOE are comparable in depth of insertion and ability to detect small vascular ectasias. Both procedures missed pathology due to limited visibility and the evanescent nature of ectasias. Long-term success in abolishing bleeding with these combined techniques can be expected in 55% of these patients. SBE should precede surgery, since the finding of diffuse ectasias precludes any benefit from operative intervention. 
5	Peripheral opioid receptors mediating antinociception in inflammation. Evidence for activation by enkephalin-like opioid peptides after cold water swim stress. This study utilized inhibitors of the enzymatic degradation of enkephalins to investigate the possibility that this class of opioid peptides contributes to the stress-induced antinociception seen in inflamed peripheral tissues of rats with Freund's complete adjuvant-initiated unilateral hind paw inflammation. Following a 1-min cold water swim stress, rats previously injected in both hind paws with vehicle showed a transient elevation of paw pressure threshold, which was much greater in inflamed than in noninflamed paws and returned to control levels within 15 min. This preferential antinociception was significantly pronounced and prolonged in rats previously injected bilaterally with a cocktail of the enkephalinase inhibitors thiorphan (0.2 mg intraplantar) and bestatin (0.2 mg intraplantar). The enhancement of stress-induced antinociception by thiorphan/bestatin was dose-dependently antagonized by tertiary naloxone (0.125-2 mg kg-1 s.c.). Evidence for a peripheral site of action of enkephalin-like peptides in this model was provided by the antagonism of the actions of thiorphan/bestatin by quaternary naltrexone (10-20 mg kg-1 s.c.). Systemic administration of the orally active enkephalinase inhibitor SCH 34826 (5-40 mg kg-1 i.p.) was also able to dose-dependently potentiate the preferential stress-induced antinociception in a naloxone (1 mg kg-1 s.c.) reversible manner. 
5	Volvulus of the colon. The charts of all patients with colonic volvulus at the University of Louisville Hospitals between 1983 and 1988 were reviewed. A total of 45 patients were identified, and there were 17 with cecal volvulus and 29 with sigmoid volvulus (1 had both). Two-thirds of the patients were either demented, bedridden, or used constipating drugs. Initial nonoperative decompression was achieved in 26 of 29 patients with sigmoid volvulus but in only three of nine patients in which it was attempted with cecal volvulus. Two of these recurred, and 16 of the 17 cecal volvulus patients underwent operation. One-third of the sigmoid volvulus patients had at least one recurrent episode on the index admission. Fourteen of the 29 had an operation, and half of these patients died following surgery. Fifteen sigmoid volvulus patients chosen to be treated with successive nonoperative treatment had no mortality. Mortality was higher following emergent (4 of 5) than elective (2 of 9) operation for sigmoid volvulus, and one of three died after operation for a successfully decompressed first episode. Mortality for nonoperative reduction of an early recurrence was zero of four patients, while operative mortality for recurrence was two of seven (all had successful preoperative deflation). There was no mortality or recurrence in four patients with cecal volvulus treated by cecopexy alone, but all three patients died in whom tube cecostomy was performed. Two of nine patients died following right hemicolectomy. These data suggest that if an elective operation is to be performed for sigmoid volvulus, it should be done following one or more recurrences and that nonoperative decompression can be safely performed on successive occasions. 
5	Use of auscultation to follow patients with mitral systolic clicks and murmurs. Mitral systolic clicks and murmurs together with associated symptoms constitute a major reason for cardiologic referral. Although echocardiography with Doppler study enables characterization of the mitral valve apparatus and quantification of regurgitation, its use has resulted in an overemphasis of the technical diagnosis of mitral valve prolapse and an undervaluation of diagnosis based on physical examination. To determine the clinical significance of an auscultatory classification of mitral systolic clicks with or without precordial systolic murmurs, 1 consultant's medical records of 291 patients with these signs were reviewed. Based on initial auscultatory findings, patients were divided into: (1) single or multiple apical systolic clicks with no murmur (n = 99); (2) single or multiple apical systolic clicks and a late systolic murmur (n = 129); and (3) single or multiple apical clicks and an apical pansystolic murmur or murmur beginning in the first half of systole (n = 63). The average duration of patient follow-up was 8 years (range 1 to 30). The prognosis was excellent for patients from all 3 classes. Two cardiac-related deaths occurred: 1 each from classes 1 and 2. Mitral valve surgery was performed in 3 class 2 patients (2%) and in 2 class 3 patients (3%). No patients developed endocarditis during follow-up. Palpitations, with varying anxiety overlay, constituted a major indication for cardiologic referral in all 3 classes. Auscultatory findings were valuable to the physician for explanation and relief of patient anxiety. For patient management, use of an auscultatory classification may be preferable to the technically generated term "mitral valve prolapse.". 
4	Hemodynamic effects of diltiazem during vasoconstrictor pulmonary hypertension in sheep. Calcium channel blockers have been effective as pulmonary vasodilators in patients with pulmonary hypertension. The current study therefore compared the effects of prostaglandin E1, an effective pulmonary vasodilator, with the effects of the water-soluble calcium channel blocker diltiazem during pulmonary hypertension in sheep. Pulmonary hypertension was produced by continuous intravenous administration of U46619 to halothane-anesthetized sheep. Prostaglandin E1 decreased pulmonary artery pressure 29%, decreased pulmonary vascular resistance (Rp) 57%, and did not affect the ratio of pulmonary to systemic vascular resistance (Rp/Rs). Diltiazem decreased pulmonary artery pressure 15%, decreased Rp 50%, and did not affect Rp/Rs. When 0.33 mL/kg polyethylene glycol-ethanol vehicle (the vehicle used for nifedipine administration in a prior study) was administered during diltiazem infusion, pulmonary artery pressure increased 19%, Rp increased 72%, and Rp/Rs increased 29%. These results indicate that diltiazem is an effective pulmonary vasodilator and suggest that the previously reported unfavorable results of nifedipine may have been due to the vehicle used for nifedipine administration. 
5	Menstrual function and eating behavior in female recreational weight lifters and competitive body builders. A group of 103 female weight lifters (WL) and 92 control (C) women answered a survey concerning eating behavior and attitudes (including the Eating Disorder Inventory) and menstrual function. The incidence of menstrual dysfunction, defined as oligomenorrhea plus amenorrhea, was significantly higher for the WL (30%) than for the C (13%) not on contraceptive pills. Only 2% of the women had amenorrhea. The incidence of dysfunction was highest for the subset of 12 WL who had competed in at least one body building competition (COMP); 86% of the COMP not on birth control pills had menstrual dysfunction (P less than 0.05). More WL than C reported missing at least one menstrual period during the last year (P = 0.06). WL scored significantly higher than C on the Drive for Thinness subscale of the Eating Disorder Inventory (EDI). Fifteen percent of the WL and 9% of the C achieved the criteria on this subscale for being weight preoccupied (P greater than 0.05). Significantly more WL than C responded that they were terrified of becoming fat (WL 56%, C 38%), were obsessed with food (WL 47%, C 30%), used laxatives for weight control (WL 14%, C 1%), and claimed that they had been anorexic in the past (WL 17%, C 5%). Examination of the answers of COMP revealed several items that were significantly different from the remainder of the WL. For example, 42% used to be anorexic, 67% were terrified of becoming fat, and 50% experienced uncontrollable urges to eat. 
1	Atopy and primary lung cancer. Histology and sex distribution. Atopy, defined as the ability to develop IgE antibodies to commonly encountered allergens under conditions of normal exposure, has an inherited component with pleiotropic effects. An inverse relationship between the occurrence of atopy, allergy-related diseases, and cancers at specific sites has been reported. The familial association of primary lung cancer is most evident among women, nonsmokers, and those with adenocarcinomas. In order to determine whether the relationship between a lower prevalence of atopy among patients with lung cancer compared to control subjects was consistent between histologic cell types, we used seven common allergens to allergy prick skin test 209 community control subjects (46 women), 109 cases with primary squamous cell carcinoma of the lung (25 women), and 67 patients with primary adenocarcinomas of the lung (23 women). We have confirmed earlier reports of an inverse relationship between atopy and lung cancer risk. In analyses focusing on sex and histologic cell type, we found that women with adenocarcinomas were an exception and were as likely to be atopic as control subjects. The evidence does not support a protective role for atopy among these women. 
4	High- versus standard-dose megestrol acetate in women with advanced breast cancer: a phase III trial of the Piedmont Oncology Association. One hundred seventy-two patients with advanced breast cancer were randomized to receive oral standard-dose megestrol acetate (MA), 160 mg/d or high-dose MA, 800 mg/d. All but two patients had one prior trial of tamoxifen therapy for either metastatic disease (74%) or as adjuvant treatment (26%). Pretreatment characteristics were similar for both arms. High-dose MA resulted in a superior complete plus partial response rate (27% v 10%, P = .005), time to treatment failure (median, 8.0 v 3.2 months, P = .019), and survival (median, 22.4 v 16.5 months, P = .04) when compared with standard-dose therapy. These differences remained significant after adjustment for other covariates. Thirty-four patients were given high-dose MA after failure of standard-dose MA treatment, and none responded. Weight gain was the most distressing side effect, with 13% of standard-dose and 43% of high-dose patients gaining more than 20 lbs. Four major cardiovascular events occurred in patients receiving high-dose treatment and one in patients given standard doses. Other toxicity was modest. High-dose MA may represent a significant improvement in secondary endocrine therapy for advanced breast cancer patients refractory to initial endocrine treatment, but its use on a regular basis should be reserved until these results are confirmed by other clinical trials. 
5	Axillosubclavian vein thrombosis produced by retrosternal thyroid. Several causes of axillosubclavian vein thrombosis have been described. Trauma to the subclavian vein by pacemaker wires or central venous lines as well as the so-called effort thrombosis have been recognized as frequently diagnosed precipitating factors. A patient is herein presented with thrombosis of the subclavian vein caused by a giant substernal thyroid compressing the innominate vein. 
5	Endoscopic sclerotherapy for control of bleeding varices in children. Thirty-three children with esophageal varices due to portal hypertension underwent injection sclerotherapy over a period of 6 yr. Thirty-one completed the sclerotherapy course, and the varices were eradicated in all. In nine, the procedure was performed as an emergency because of continued bleeding and, in each case, a gastric fundal varix was the source of the blood loss. Sclerotherapy successfully controlled the bleeding in four of these, whereas five required surgical underrunning of the fundal varix. After surgery, these five continued sclerotherapy until the esophageal varices were eradicated. Complications included transient pyrexia (39%), retrosternal discomfort (30%), esophageal ulceration (18%), and esophageal stricture (12%). Rebleeding before initial eradication of the varices occurred in 12 patients but, thereafter, was very uncommon and always small in amount. Esophageal varices recurred after initial eradication in 33% of cases but were easily sclerosed with further injections. This study demonstrates that sclerotherapy is effective in reducing bleeding frequency in children with portal hypertension, but emphasizes the need for regular follow-up endoscopy after initial eradication of esophageal varices. 
5	Urogenital dysfunction after abdominoperineal resection for carcinoma of the rectum. The long-term urogenital dysfunctions in 46 of 104 surviving patients submitted to abdominoperineal resection for rectal carcinoma between 1972 and 1986 were collected and assessed. Urinary retention was present in 41 percent of the men and 35 percent of women, while incontinence was present in 10 percent of men and 29 percent of women. Impotence was reported by 59 percent of the males, all sexually active before surgery. Dyspareunia was present in 50 percent of the women in the study. The possibility of treating prostatic hypertrophy concurrently with abdominoperineal resection in selected cases to avoid urinary retention is discussed. The limited number of responders to the survey may interfere with the global statistical significance. 
5	Pelvic pain: lessons from anatomy and physiology. Pelvic pain is often a difficult differential diagnosis in the emergency department. For physiologic reasons, pain in the pelvis is difficult to localize to a specific organ, and pelvic peritonitis is hard to recognize. On the other hand, differences in types of pain can be very useful in arriving at a correct diagnosis. The clinician must learn to recognize superficial and deep somatic pain, and differentiate between various types of visceral pain which originate from inflammation, ischemia, or colic. A review of the anatomy and physiology of pelvic pain helps identify some of the problems as well as potential aids in approaching the patient with pelvic pain. 
5	Retained bile duct stones in a patient with Billroth II gastrectomy: extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy and papillary dilatation via T tube. A postoperative T tube cholangiogram after cholecystectomy in a 62 year old patient showed two retained calculi of 14 mm diameter each. Endoscopic sphincterotomy was not possible because of previous Billroth II gastrectomy. The stones were disintegrated by electromagnetically generated extracorporeal shock waves. The T tube was replaced by a balloon catheter and the papilla of Vater was dilatated allowing passage of stone fragments. We conclude that retained bile duct stones can be removed without sphincterotomy or percutaneous extraction by extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy and papillary dilatation. This method should be considered especially in patients with Billroth II gastrectomy. 
3	Extrapulmonary pneumocystosis: clinical features in human immunodeficiency virus infection. Pneumocystis carinii infection is reported with increasing frequency as a cause of disease outside of the respiratory tract in patients with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. Extrapulmonary pneumocystosis is not limited to patients in any discrete risk group for HIV infection. Patients with HIV infection who develop extrapulmonary pneumocystosis frequently do not have concurrent P. carinii pneumonia. Signs and symptoms of extrapulmonary pneumocystosis are nonspecific but when present are frequently referable to the tissues or organs involved. Extrapulmonary pneumocystosis can be diagnosed by examination of tissue biopsies from affected sites using standard histologic techniques. Therapy with antimicrobial agents used to treat P. carinii pneumonia has been effective in some patients. An association between use of aerosolized pentamidine for prevention of P. carinii pneumonia and development of extrapulmonary pneumocystosis has been suggested but remains unconfirmed. Other factors such as the use of zidovudine and duration of immunodeficiency may also be important to the pathogenesis of extrapulmonary pneumocystosis. Further studies are needed to better identify risk factors that may predispose patients to the development of extrapulmonary pneumocystosis. 
3	Opiates suppress carrageenan-induced edema and hyperthermia at doses that inhibit hyperalgesia. This study determined whether opiates alter vascular components of inflammation (hyperthermia, edema and plasma extravasation) in addition to the suppression of hyperalgesia. Rats were administered carrageenan into one hind paw and saline into the other hind paw, followed by i.p. injection of morphine (0.2-5.0 mg/kg) or saline at 60 min, and testing at 90 min after hind paw injections. Morphine produced a dose-dependent reduction in carrageenan-induced hyperalgesia (17-53%), hyperthermia (39-53%) and edema (24-36%). Morphine treatment did not alter the temperatures of the contralateral saline-injected paws, indicating that opiate suppression of hyperthermia was not confounded by alterations in systemic body temperature or blood flow. The opiate effects on inflammation were stereospecific since levorphanol (1 mg/kg), but not dextrorphan (1 mg/kg), suppressed carrageenan-evoked hyperalgesia, hyperthermia and edema. Pre-treatment with naltrexone (1.5 mg/kg) blocked the effects of a 5 mg/kg dose of morphine sulfate on hyperalgesia, hyperthermia and edema. In a separate study, i.v. injection of morphine sulfate (2 mg/kg) reduced plasma extravasation by 41% (P less than 0.01). Morphine administration resulted in significantly greater increases in paw withdrawal latencies in the inflamed (38-139%) than the contralateral, saline-treated paws (4-19%). The results indicate that opiates exert a moderate, though significant, reduction in the vascular signs of inflammation in addition to their reduction of hyperalgesia. The mechanisms for this vascular effect involve inhibition of both vasodilation (as indicated by a decrease in hyperthermia) and inhibition of vascular permeability. In addition, opiates exhibit enhanced antinociceptive effects in inflamed paws, even when compared to uninjured paws in the same animal. 
1	Hepatitis B virus integration in hepatitis B virus-related hepatocellular carcinoma in childhood. In Taiwan, hepatocellular carcinoma is one of the major malignancies in children between 5 and 14 yr of age. We studied the status of hepatitis B virus DNA in the hepatocellular carcinoma and nontumorous liver tissues of eight children with positive serum HBsAg and maternal HBsAg. The hepatocellular carcinoma tissues from five of the eight children showed integration of hepatitis B virus DNA into host cellular DNA sequences. A pattern of single-site integration in four children and a multiple-site integration pattern in one child were demonstrated. In the remaining three children, hepatitis B virus DNA could not be demonstrated in the tumor tissues. Using subgenomic fragments of the hepatitis B virus genome as probes, we found that the X gene fragment and the surface antigen gene fragment were the most conserved sequences. The single-site integration of hepatitis B virus DNA in childhood hepatocellular carcinoma may have hit the critical region, resulting in insertional mutagenesis and early development of hepatocellular carcinoma. With a short incubation period and less exposure to environmental carcinogens during early life, childhood hepatocellular carcinoma may provide a good model to study the carcinogenic potential of hepatitis B virus. 
5	A patient-oriented approach to perilymph fistula. The subject of perilymph fistula is controversial in part because the preoperative diagnosis of perilymph fistula is difficult. Patients suffering auditory and vestibular symptoms secondary to perilymph fistula, therefore, present a dilemma to the practicing physician. In some instances, patients with auditory and vestibular symptoms in the absence of perilymph fistula will be subjected to middle ear exploration without benefit, while in other instances patients with auditory and vestibular symptoms secondary to perilymph fistula will be denied surgical treatment. Auditory and vestibular symptoms are a quality of life issue. Therefore, in an effort to provide care of the highest quality the patient must be actively involved in the decision process. Such involvement can be meaningful only after the patient is carefully counseled as to the pros and cons of surgery, as well as the alternatives. A prognostic paradigm based on the personal experience of one of us (W.L.M.) with perilymph fistula patients is described and is used in patient consultation in an effort to facilitate decision making. 
2	Prospective study of early detection of hepatocellular carcinoma in patients with cirrhosis. We prospectively monitored 140 cirrhotic patients for the development of hepatocellular carcinoma for 6 yr, using periodical screening by high-resolution convex-array ultrasonography and alpha-fetoprotein. Twenty-eight patients were positive for HBs antigen, 26 patients had received blood transfusions and were negative for HBs antigen and 26 patients had a history of heavy drinking. We detected hepatocellular carcinoma in 40 patients during this period. The overall cumulative incidence of hepatocellular carcinoma in the 6 yr was 39%; the cumulative incidence was 59% in patients with HBsAg, 53% in patients who had had blood transfusions and were negative for HBsAg and 22% in patients who had a history of heavy drinking and who were without HBsAg. Detection of the carcinoma in 85% of these 40 patients was based on results of ultrasonography. Twenty-six of the patients (65%) had a small hepatocellular carcinoma of 2 cm or less. alpha-Fetoprotein levels were lower than 100 ng/ml in 56% of these 40 patients. Patients with cirrhosis are at high risk of developing hepatocellular carcinoma, especially patients with HBsAg or with a history of blood transfusion who are negative for HBsAg. Periodic monitoring by use of ultrasonography in particular is recommended for early detection of hepatocellular carcinoma. 
1	Transformation-associated alterations in interactions between pre-B cells and fibronectin. Marrow stromal elements produce as yet uncharacterized soluble growth factors that can stimulate the proliferation of murine pre-B cells, although close contact between these two cell types appears to ensure a better pre-B cell response. We have now shown that freshly isolated normal pre-B cells (ie, the B220+, surface mu- fraction of adult mouse bone marrow) adhere to fibronectin (FN) via an RGD cell-attachment site, as shown in a serum-free adherence assay, and they lose this functional ability on differentiation in vivo into B cells (ie, the B220+, surface mu+ fraction). Similarly, cells from an immortalized but stromal cell-dependent and nontumorigenic murine pre-B cell line originally derived from a Whitlock-Witte culture were also found to adhere to fibronectin (FN) via an RGD cell-attachment site. Moreover, in the presence of anti-FN receptor antibodies, the ability of this immortalized pre-B cell line to proliferate when co-cultured with a supportive stromal cell line (M2-10B4 cells) was markedly reduced (down to 30% of control). This suggests that pre-B cell attachment to FN on stromal cells may be an important component of the mechanism by which stromal cells stimulate normal pre-B cell proliferation and one that is no longer operative to control their more differentiated progeny. Two differently transformed pre-B cell lines, both of which are autocrine, stromal-independent, tumorigenic in vivo, and partially or completely differentiation-arrested at a very early stage of pre-B cell development, did not bind to FN. In addition, anti-FN receptor antibodies were much less effective in diminishing the ability of these tumorigenic pre-B cells to respond to M2-10B4 cell stimulation, which could still be demonstrated when the tumorigenic pre-B cells were co-cultured with M2-10B4 cells at a sufficiently low cell density. Analysis of cell surface molecules immunoprecipitated from both the nontumorigenic and tumorigenic pre-B cell lines by an anti-FN receptor antibody showed an increase in very late antigen (VLA) alpha chain(s) in both tumorigenic pre-B cell lines and a decrease in the beta 1 chain in one. Interestingly, all of the pre-B cell lines expressed similar amounts of messenger RNA for the beta 1 chain of the FN receptor. These results suggest that alteration of FN receptor expression on pre-B cells may represent a mechanism contributing to the outgrowth of leukemic pre-B cells with an autocrine phenotype and capable of stromal cell-independent, autonomous growth. 
4	Uses and limitations of transthoracic echocardiography in the assessment of atrial septal defect in the adult. Two-dimensional and color Doppler echocardiography accurately detected the presence of an atrial septal defect (ASD) in 47 of 50 adults (mean age 40 years) confirmed by surgery or cardiac catheterization, or both. It correctly categorized all patients with ostium secundum and ostium primum ASD but misdiagnosed 3 of 5 patients with surgically proven sinus venosus ASD. The shunt flow volume across the ASD was calculated with the standard Doppler equation, and assuming the ASD to be circular correlated with shunt flow volume obtained by cardiac catheterization (r = 0.74). The maximum width of the color flow signals moving across the ASD was taken as its diameter. Mean flow velocity was determined either by placing a pulsed Doppler sample volume parallel to the flow across the ASD as visualized by color Doppler or by color M-mode examination, which allowed determination of flow velocities using a previously validated method that incorporates a computer analysis of pixel color intensity. The pulmonary to systemic blood flow ratio obtained by color-guided conventional Doppler interrogation of the left and right ventricular outflow tracts correlated poorly with cardiac catheterization results (r = 0.38). In patients with associated tricuspid regurgitation, the peak systolic pulmonary artery pressure obtained by color Doppler-guided continuous-wave Doppler correlated well with that obtained at cardiac catheterization (r = 0.89). The maximum color Doppler jet width of the flow across the ASD poorly correlated with ASD size estimated at surgery (r = 0.50). 
2	Interferon antibodies may negate the antiviral effects of recombinant alpha-interferon treatment in patients with chronic hepatitis B virus infection. In a randomized controlled trial of recombinant alpha-2a interferon for chronic hepatitis B, interferon antibodies developed in 21 (39%) of 54 Chinese adults who received IFN. No correlation was observed between sex, age, pretreatment serum ALT level or liver histological findings and the development of interferon antibodies. Antibodies were significantly more likely to develop in patients who received lower doses (2.5 or 5 MU/m2) of alpha-2a interferon than in those who received a higher dose (10 MU/m2): 53% vs. 11% (p = 0.006). The development of interferon antibodies appeared to reverse the initial antiviral response to treatment, with reappearance of hepatitis B virus DNA in serum in 12 patients and HBeAg in three patients. Sustained clearance of HBeAg was achieved in only one (5%) patient but was achieved in seven (21%) patients without interferon antibodies. The mere presence of interferon antibodies did not preclude an antiviral response to interferon therapy, but patients with high titer neutralizing antibodies were less likely to respond. These findings suggest that interferon antibodies may negate the antiviral effects of alpha-2a interferon. A higher incidence of interferon antibodies in Chinese vs. white patients with chronic hepatitis B may contribute to the poorer antiviral response in Chinese patients. 
5	Relationship of ischemic heart disease to sudden death. A clinicopathological synthesis is presented of the relationship of ischemic heart disease to sudden cardiac death. The immediate pathophysiological process responsible for sudden cardiac death is a lethal arrhythmia, usually ventricular fibrillation. Although significant coronary atherosclerosis is present in most cases of naturally occurring sudden death, available evidence indicates that several mechanisms can be operative in the pathogenesis of the fatal event. These are (1) acute myocardial infarction in a minority of cases; (2) myocardial ischemia, without infarction, which is initiated either by (a) an exertion-induced increase in myocardial oxygen demand or (b) an acute coronary event often involving plaque degeneration and platelet aggregation; and (3) a primary arrhythmia, usually resulting from altered electrical conduction in the setting of a previous myocardial infarction. 
1	Prolonged administration of oral etoposide in patients with relapsed or refractory small-cell lung cancer: a phase II trial. Twenty-two patients with recurrent small-cell lung cancer (SCLC) were treated with single-agent etoposide 50 mg/m2/d by mouth for 21 consecutive days. Eleven patients had received previous chemotherapy with cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, and vincristine (CAV) or etoposide (CAE) or both (CAVE). Four of the latter patients also received salvage treatment with cisplatin and etoposide (EP). Nine patients had been treated with EP as induction therapy, while two patients had received high-dose cyclophosphamide, etoposide and cisplatin (HDCEP). Altogether, 18 patients had received previous intravenous etoposide. The median time off chemotherapy was 4.5 months (range, 1 to 28.9 months). Ten patients (45.5%; 95% confidence interval [CI], 27% to 65%) achieved a complete or partial response. Responses were most common in patients who had responded to previous chemotherapy and who had not received any treatment in the 90 days before initiation of oral etoposide. Median response duration was 4 months (range, 1.5 to 9.5 months) and median survival was 3.5+ months (range, 1.0 to 15+ months). Leukocyte and platelet nadirs were 1,800/microL and 160,000/microL, respectively, during cycle 1 of treatment and occurred between days 21 and 28. Overall, total leukocyte count decreased to less than 1,000/microL during 10 of 56 cycles (18%). Five patients required six hospitalizations for neutropenia and fever. There were two toxic deaths due to sepsis. Platelet counts less than 50,000/microL occurred in 14 cycles (25%). Alopecia developed in all patients; gastrointestinal toxicity was uncommon. This schedule of etoposide administration warrants further study in combination with other active agents in previously untreated patients with SCLC. 
1	Low diacylglycerol values in colonic adenomas and colorectal cancer. The biochemical events that make colonic epithelial cells proceed along the adenoma-carcinoma sequence are not well understood. The phosphoinositol signal transduction pathway is involved in the regulation of cell growth and differentiation. To determine its role in colonic neoplasias we performed mass measurements of its second messenger sn-1,2-diacylglycerol in biopsy specimens from normal mucosa and neoplasias of the colon. Normal colonic mucosa was also investigated in patients without colonic abnormalities (n = 10). Compared with pooled diacylglycerol values from five colonic sites (100%), values in patients with a normal colon were highest in the ascending colon (120 (5)%, p less than 0.05) and lowest in the rectum (81 (5)%, p less than 0.01). Absolute diacylglycerol values in patients with normal colons (2.62 (0.16) nmol/mg protein) were not significantly different from those found in the normal mucosa of patients with colorectal neoplasias (2.45 (0.17) nmol/mg protein). Both colonic adenomas (n = 15) and colorectal carcinomas (n = 14) showed significantly decreased diacylglycerol values compared with the adjacent normal mucosa of each patient (72 (4)%, p less than 0.001, and 71 (4)%, p less than 0.001 respectively). The appreciable decrease in mass diacylglycerol values clearly distinguishes adenomas and carcinomas of the colon from the surrounding normal mucosa. This finding suggests that profound metabolic changes of the phosphoinositol signal transduction pathway occur early in the adenoma-carcinoma sequence and may be important in colonic carcinogenesis. 
3	Reversible hearing loss from cerebellopontine angle tumors. We report two patients who presented with a dramatic recovery from severe sensorineural hearing loss after total surgical removal of cerebellopontine angle tumors (meningioma and jugular foramen neurinoma). The factors that differentiate these "non-acoustic tumors" in relation to the prognosis for hearing are discussed. A surgical approach that maintains the labyrinthine structure and preserves the arachnoid membrane of the superior cerebellopontine angle cistern during tumor removal is stressed. 
3	Lateral medullary infarction: prognosis in an unselected series. We describe the acute and long-term prognosis in 43 patients with lateral medullary infarction (LMI) collected from a population-based stroke registry from 1982 to July 1988. Mean age was 63.9 years and median time of follow-up was 33 months. In the acute phase, 5 patients (11.6%) died from respiratory and cardiovascular complications and 2 new strokes occurred, both in the posterior circulation. During follow-up, recurrent vertebrobasilar territory strokes occurred in only 2 patients (a rate of 1.9% per year). The mechanisms of stroke were vertebral artery (VA) branch occlusion, causing a medial medullary syndrome, and basilar artery thrombosis propagating from a contralateral, distal VA stenosis. In the acute phase of LMI, respiratory and cardiovascular events, presumably caused by autonomic dysfunction related to the lateral medullary lesion, are the major hazards. Recurrent posterior circulation strokes were uncommon during follow-up. 
1	Nephron-sparing surgery for renal cell carcinoma with venous involvement. A nephron-sparing operation recently has been shown to provide extended survival free of disease in selected patients with localized renal cell carcinoma, particularly for tumors of lower stage. To define better the role of conservative surgical treatment in more locally advanced renal cell carcinoma we reviewed 9 patients with venous tumor involvement in solitary functioning kidneys who underwent a nephron-sparing operation. Complete tumor resection with adequate preservation of renal function was accomplished in all cases. Of the 9 patients 5 had no evidence of disease 7 to 93 months (mean 33.2 months) postoperatively. The remaining 4 patients died of metastatic renal cell carcinoma 17 to 47 months (mean 35.5 months) postoperatively, 2 of whom had concomitant local recurrences in the renal remnant. Based on previously reported results of total nephrectomy for renal cell carcinoma with venous involvement and the morbidity associated with renal replacement therapy, we believe that a nephron-sparing operation is a viable option in the management of these patients. 
2	Hepatocellular carcinoma within siderotic regenerative nodules: appearance as a nodule within a nodule on MR images. Large regenerative nodules in cirrhotic livers may accumulate iron and develop internal iron-poor foci of hyperplasia or malignancy. Magnetic resonance examinations were performed on 23 patients with biopsy-proved cirrhosis. A "nodule-within-nodule" appearance was noted in two patients. This appearance consisted of markedly low intensity of a large nodule on gradient-echo images, with one or two internal foci that were isointense to the liver. Each of the large nodules was 2 cm in diameter, and each of the internal foci was less than 1 cm. Serum alpha-fetoprotein levels were normal in both patients. Aspiration biopsy performed in one patient failed to show malignancy, but histologic confirmation of hepatocellular carcinoma was obtained eventually in both cases. The nodule-within-nodule sign, which reflects the unique histopathology of hepatocellular carcinoma in large siderotic regenerative nodules, is strongly suggestive of early hepatocellular carcinoma, even if serologic markers and biopsy results do not support this diagnosis. 
1	Phase I study of repeated cycles of high-dose cyclophosphamide, etoposide, and cisplatin administered without bone marrow transplantation Forty-two patients with advanced malignancy judged unlikely to respond to standard treatment received high-dose combination chemotherapy with cyclophosphamide, etoposide, and cisplatin in a phase I trial. Twenty-two of these patients who had at least a partial response (PR) to the first cycle of therapy received a second cycle, and eight patients received three or more cycles of therapy. Bone marrow replacement was not used. The maximum-tolerated doses (MTDs) were cyclophosphamide 2.5 g/m2 on days 1 and 2; etoposide 500 mg/m2 on days 1, 2, and 3; and cisplatin 50 mg/m2 on days 1, 2, and 3. Hematologic toxicity was not dose-limiting by study design. Recovery to an absolute granulocyte count above 100/microL occurred at a median of 9 days from onset (range, 3 to 23 days) at the MTD. Recovery was delayed after the third cycle. Only one patient on his third cycle failed to recover peripheral blood counts and died of sepsis an day 43. Hematologic toxicity was not dose-dependent. Nonhematologic toxicities included emesis, fatigue, alopecia, diarrhea, and anorexia and were generally well tolerated. The dose-limiting toxicities were fatal pulmonary or cardiac toxicities in five of nine patients treated at the highest dose level. Patients likely to do well can be selected by tumor type, response to prior therapy, and performance status. Nine of 36 assessable patients had a complete response (CR) and 13 a PR for a response rate of 61%. Five patients (12%) remain alive and free of disease at 15 to 32 months. Repeated cycles of dose-intensive combination therapy can produce long-term disease-free remissions in patients with refractory tumor types. The toxicity of the regimen is acceptable if patients are carefully selected. 
5	Pancreatic ascites presenting in infancy, with review of the literature. We report a 4-month-old boy with massive ascites in whom a diagnosis of pancreatitis was made on a raised ascitic amylase level after two inconclusive laparotomies. He developed a pseudocyst which was managed with repeated percutaneous needle aspirations, nutrition being maintained intravenously. Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) demonstrated a congenital intra-pancreatic cyst. He thrived after operation drainage for recurrent pseudocyst, but repeat ERCP shows that the cyst in the head of the pancreas remains. Pancreatic ascites is rare in children and diagnosis is frequently delayed. A third of reported cases in childhood present in the first year of life. A search for the underlying cause should include an ERCP to demonstrate abnormalities of the pancreaticobiliary ducts. 
1	Partial reversibility of cisplatin nephrotoxicity in children. To evaluate the long-term renal toxicity of cisplatin, 40 children who had been without treatment at least 18 months (range 18 months to 7 years) were observed. In all the children, glomerular filtration rate (GFR) was estimated from the plasma clearance of chromium 51-labeled ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid, both at the end of treatment and at a median follow-up of 2 years 6 months after treatment was stopped (range 18 months to 7 years). In 21 children, serum magnesium level was also measured at follow-up. Median age at diagnosis was 15 months (range 13 days to 13 years 8 months), and median cumulative doses of cisplatin was 500 mg/m2 (range 120 to 1860 mg/m2). In 22 of 24 children with an end-of-treatment GFR of less than 80 ml/min per 1.73 m2, the median improvement in GFR at follow-up was 22 ml/min per 1.73 m2 (range 2 to 56 ml/min per 1.73 m2). Hypomagnesemia was found in 6 of 21 children and was independent of GFR. No significant correlation was found between improvement in renal function and total cisplatin dose, age, gender, tumor type, or associated nephrotoxic medication. We conclude that most children have some recovery from cisplatin glomerular toxicity, especially if damage is not severe, but that hypomagnesemia may persist. 
5	Epidemiology of acute respiratory infections in young children from Thailand. A prospective evaluation of the epidemiology and presentations of acute respiratory infections in children younger than 5 years of age admitted to Children's Hospital Bangkok (1988 to 1989) was supported by the World Health Organization. There were 226 patients with the inclusion criteria: 1 to 5 years of age; duration of illness less than 2 weeks; no prior antibiotic therapy; and low socioeconomic status. The disease categories included: croup, 19 cases; bronchiolitis, 60 cases; and pneumonia, 147 cases. Pathogens isolated were: respiratory syncytial virus (40); parainfluenza III (1); influenza B (1); and adenovirus (1); bacterial infections were proved in 23 cases. No significant differences in clinical features between bacterial and viral pneumonia were found. Interstitial radiographic patterns were more common in viral pneumonia whereas alveolar patterns were more common in bacterial pneumonia. However, 91% of mixed radiographic patterns (interstitial and alveolar) in chest films were from viral pneumonia. 
3	Serum aldolase isozyme levels in patients with cerebrovascular diseases. A subunit specific radioimmunoassay was developed for the quantification of human aldolase A, B, and C. The method used was a double antibody radioimmunoassay using radioiodinated purified aldolase A, B, or C subunits as the ligand, specific chicken antibodies to aldolase isozymes and rabbit antibodies to chicken IgG. The Iodogen method was used for iodination of the purified isozyme subunits in this study. Human brain tissue contained similar concentrations of aldolase A and aldolase C, and a smaller amount of aldolase B, which was the main isozyme of liver tissue. Levels of serum aldolase A were greater than 203 ng/ml, the upper limit of normal, in six of 24 patients with cerebral infarction and in 11 of 31 patients with cerebral hemorrhage. Nine of 24 patients with cerebral infarction and 16 of 31 patients with cerebral hemorrhage had serum aldolase C levels greater than 4.1 ng/ml, the upper limit in normal sera. These data suggest that serum aldolase C may be a more specific and sensitive marker of cerebrovascular diseases than aldolase A. We also demonstrated that serial measurement of serum aldolase C in patients with cerebrovascular diseases might be useful in estimating prognosis, since serially increasing serum aldolase C levels during the course of these diseases were correlated with a high mortality rate. 
4	Diagnostic value of maximal exercise tidal volume. Though breathing pattern is frequently analyzed during clinical exercise testing, there is little information regarding its usefulness in the differential diagnosis of impaired exercise tolerance. This study tested the hypothesis that differences in peak tidal volume during exercise between patients with different cardiorespiratory diseases are related largely to differences in severity of respiratory mechanical impairment (vital capacity), not to differences in disease state. Patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, restrictive lung disease, bronchial asthma, and heart disease (mitral valve disease or left ventricular dysfunction) were studied. Subjects selected had one and only one of the above diagnoses. All subjects performed maximal (symptom-limited) incremental exercise on a cycle ergometer. Multiple linear regression of all subjects (n = 30) in all four groups showed a significant correlation between VTmax and VC: VTmax = 0.55, VC -0.09 L (r = 0.827, p less than 0.0001). The VTmax/VC (x 100) was (mean +/- SD) 44 +/- 15, 54 +/- 11, 56 +/- 11, and 54 +/- 12 for the COPD, RLD, BA and HD patients respectively. There was no significant difference between any of the groups. We concluded that differences in VTmax between different patients are related largely to differences in VC (ie, differences in severity of respiratory mechanical impairment), not to differences in disease state. Measurement of VTmax or the VTmax/VC ratio has little value in the differential diagnosis of exertional dyspnea. 
1	Hodgkin's disease in association with human immunodeficiency virus infection. Pathologic and immunologic features. Six patients with Hodgkin's disease (HD) and demonstrable serum antibodies to human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and two additional patients with HD belonging to HIV-associated high-risk groups but with negative HIV serology were studied. All patients were men and ranged in age from 21 to 45 years. The HIV risk factors included homosexuality (6), intravenous drug abuse (2), and hemophilia A (1). All patients had high pathologically determined stage (one Stage III and seven Stage IV), and bone marrow involvement was observed in five patients with the initial diagnosis of HD based on marrow biopsy in two cases. Four cases were histologically subclassified as mixed cellularity (MC) and three as nodular sclerosis (NS); one patient underwent only bone marrow biopsy and was not subclassified. Histologically all cases were characterized by numerous Reed-Sternberg cells and variants, and with the exception of one case, all had a distinctive decrease in the proportion of reactive background lymphocytes compared with what is usually expected in MC or NS Hodgkin's disease (relative lymphocyte depletion). Flow-cytometric immunophenotypic studies done on cell suspensions from diagnostic lymph node biopsies in four cases showed decreased CD4:CD8 ratios (mean = 1.4) compared with expected values of 4 to 6. The relative lymphocyte depletion observed histologically is probably a reflection of the decreased tissue CD4:CD8 ratios, and this impairment of host immune response may be related to the observed high stage in all eight cases. Patients with high stage HD and the described histologic and immunologic features should be evaluated for the presence of HIV infection. 
1	Treatment of cutaneous T cell lymphoma with a combination of low-dose interferon alfa-2b and retinoids. In a pilot study the therapeutic effect and side effect profile of low-dose interferon alfa-2b in combination with a retinoid for the treatment of cutaneous T cell lymphoma were evaluated. Seven patients (four women, three men) with histologically confirmed cutaneous T cell lymphoma were included. Four patients had received therapy previously. The treatment schedule consisted of 2 million U of interferon alfa-2b administered subcutaneously three times per week and oral 13-cis-retinoic acid, 1 mg/kg/day, with subsequent dose reduction in case of response. The combination therapy produced two complete and two partial remissions. Responses were maintained by continuous therapy for up to 15 months even after dose reduction of both agents by 50%. Side effects were negligible and did not result in discontinuation of treatment in any patient. 
5	Accumulation and pepsin solubility of collagens in the bowel of patients with Crohn's disease. The collagen content of resected strictured intestine, with and without fistulas, from patients with Crohn's disease has been compared with that in macroscopically normal intestine removed from the same patients and from others without inflammatory bowel disease. Collagen content per unit wet or dry weight of tissue was significantly increased in all grossly diseased tissue whether fistulated or not. Although there was a significant increase in collagen types I, III, and V in diseased tissue, the relative proportions of major collagen types extracted by limited pepsin digestion were similar for both Crohn's and non-Crohn's intestine (type I, 65 to 70 percent; type III, 25 to 30 percent; type IV, 2 to 3 percent; and type V, 2.5 to 3 percent). CNBr digestion of pepsin insoluble material showed a similar relative abundance of types I and III, indicating no major change in collagen type distribution between older (insoluble) and more newly synthesized collagen. There was no evidence of the presence of type I trimer collagen. Type VI collagen, although not quantitated, was observed in 70 percent of intestinal specimens. The proportion of total collagen solubilized by pepsin treatment was significantly greater in both grossly diseased and macroscopically normal Crohn's bowel compared with non-inflammatory bowel disease bowel. These findings suggest that there are disturbances of collagen metabolism in Crohn's intestine, which account for the stricturing process and which may predate gross pathologic changes. 
3	An objective comparison of intrathecal lidocaine versus fentanyl for the treatment of lower extremity spasticity. The reduction of spasticity after administration of intrathecal fentanyl, 35 micrograms, and intrathecal lidocaine, 50 mg, was compared with preinjection spasticity levels in ten subjects with central nervous system disease or injury. Spasticity was objectively assessed by an electronic instrument that simultaneously measures degrees of extension and force during passive knee extension. Duration of spasticity relief and adverse effects were recorded. Both drugs equally reduced spasticity and increased the range of motion. There were no supraspinal side effects from the fentanyl, whereas three subjects became hypotensive after receiving lidocaine. The reduction of spasticity with intrathecal fentanyl lasted at least 3 h. The authors postulate that fentanyl reduced spasticity by an effect on spinal pathways. Intrathecal fentanyl should be considered as an alternative to lidocaine for diagnostic blocks in patients with spasticity. 
3	Parkinsonian tremor loses its alternating aspect during non-REM sleep and is inhibited by REM sleep. Non-REM sleep transforms the waking alternating Parkinsonian tremor into subclinical repetitive muscle contractions whose amplitude and duration decrease as non-REM sleep progresses from stages I to IV. During REM sleep Parkinsonian tremor disappears while the isolated muscle events increase significantly. 
3	Evidence of serum-protein leakage across the blood-brain barrier in the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome. Lesions of the central nervous system (CNS) in 23 patients with the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) were compared with control cases for the presence of serum protein by immunoperoxidase staining. A sensitive immunostaining kit in conjunction with rabbit antisera to human serum, albumin, immunoglobulins and complement component 3c was used to demonstrate specific immunoreactivity in paraffin-embedded sections. Most AIDS patients with CNS lesions had serum protein immunoreactivity in some neurons, glial cells (including astrocytes), gliomesenchymal cell nodules, vascular endothelial cells, inflammatory cells or microvascular walls. Cases with the most necrosis tended to have the least immunostaining. Immunoreactivity for IgG and fixed complement in anatomically intact or morphologically altered neural cells may indicate cellular lesions and potential cellular necrosis beyond the damage indicated by routine studies alone. Part of this immunoreactivity might represent a humoral autoimmune response. 
5	Surfactant replacement therapy with a single postventilatory dose of a reconstituted bovine surfactant in preterm neonates with respiratory distress syndrome: final analysis of a multicenter, double-blind, randomized trial and comparison with similar trials. The Surfactant-TA Study Group. The effects of a single dose of surfactant TA were assessed in premature neonates (birth weight 750 to 1749 g) with respiratory distress syndrome (RDS) in a multicenter, double-blind, randomized clinical trial. Only neonates with surfactant deficiency and without ultrasonographic evidence of intracranial hemorrhage greater than or equal to grade II were enrolled. Fifty-four patients received surfactant (100 mg of phospholipid per kilogram of body weight) and 46 patients received an air placebo within 8 hours of life. Treatment with this surfactant resulted in a significant reduction in the severity of RDS with a concomitant increase in the proportion of neonates with mild disease. The frequency of pulmonary interstitial emphysema and of pneumothorax was significantly lower in treated neonates compared with control neonates (2% vs 26%, P = .0008, and 7% vs 39%, P = .0004, respectively). The frequency of intracranial hemorrhage was significantly lower in the surfactant group compared with the control group (20% vs 54%, P = .0008) and was also reduced for the smallest neonates in the surfactant group (13% vs 73%, P = .00008). When categorized according to severity of intracranial hemorrhage and severity of bronchopulmonary dysplasia, the surfactant group was at a significant advantage (adjusted Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel X2 = 10.72, P less than .001 and X2 = 4.43, P = .036, respectively). The proportion of neonates surviving without intracranial hemorrhage and/or bronchopulmonary dysplasia was 63% in the surfactant group vs 26% in the control group (P = .0004); as for the smallest neonates, it was 58% in the surfactant group vs 4% in the control group (P = .0002). There were no differences between the groups with respect to the frequency of patent ductus arteriosus (46% vs 37%), pulmonary hemorrhage (6% vs 7%), necrotizing enterocolitis (0% vs 2%), sepsis (4% vs 2%), retinopathy of prematurity (13% vs 22%), or death (15% vs 22%). It is concluded that treatment with the single-dose surfactant regimen used in this study reduces the severity of respiratory distress during the 48 hours after treatment and decreases the major pulmonary morbidity and intracranial hemorrhage in premature neonates with RDS. Further studies are needed to determine whether (1) treatment at birth or as soon as after RDS is diagnosed and (2) the use of multiple dose of this surfactant would result in any additional benefits. 
5	Spontaneous infarction of placental chorioangioma and associated regression of hydrops fetalis. We report a case of a large chorioangioma diagnosed prenatally with concomitant meconium peritonitis and hydrops fetalis in the second trimester. Spontaneous regression of the tumor occurred, associated with some resolution of the fetal hydrops and delivery near term with good neonatal outcome. 
2	The prevalence of gallstone disease in very old institutionalized persons. We present the results of a study that was undertaken at a large geriatric nursing home to assess the prevalence of gallstone disease in very old institutionalized persons. One hundred seventeen residents underwent ultrasound examination of the gallbladder. Two thirds of 82 women and half of 35 men had gallstone disease. When stratified for age, 80% of women and men over the age of 90 years were positive for the disease. In summary, the prevalence of gallstone disease in our very old nursing home population was found to be unexpectedly high. 
5	Antimigraine treatment for slit ventricle syndrome. Slit ventricle syndrome is characterized by chronic or recurring headaches associated with subnormal ventricular volume in patients who have undergone shunt treatment for hydrocephalus. There appear to be at least three pathophysiological mechanisms that cause this syndrome: 1) intermittent shunt malfunction; 2) intracranial hypotension; and 3) paroxysms of increased intracranial pressure in the presence of normal shunt function. To treat seven patients with slit ventricle syndrome caused by paroxysms of elevated intracranial pressure, we successfully used antimigraine therapy rather than standard calvarial expansion procedures. None of these patients has required shunt revision or calvarial expansion during a mean follow-up period of 2 years. The symptoms of slit ventricle syndrome may be a form of "acquired" migraine in shunt patients. We suggest that, in clinically stable patients with normal shunt function, treatment against migraine may stabilize symptoms resulting from paroxysms of increased intracranial pressure. Such treatment may prevent unnecessary shunt revisions and/or calvarial expansion procedures. 
3	Increased serotoninergic and noradrenergic activity in hepatic encephalopathy in rats with thioacetamide-induced acute liver failure. Functional changes of various neurotransmitter systems have been implicated in the pathogenesis of hepatic encephalopathy. In this study the role of brain monoaminergic neurotransmitter systems in hepatic encephalopathy was investigated in rats with thioacetamide-induced acute liver failure. Concentrations of serotonin, dopamine, noradrenaline and of their metabolites 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid, dihydroxyphenylalanine (following inhibition of dihydroxyphenylalanine-decarboxylase), dihydroxyphenylacetic acid, homovanillic acid and 3-methoxy-4-hydroxyphenyl-glycol, were measured in the cerebral cortex, striatum and hippocampus by high performance liquid chromatography with electrochemical detection. In hepatic encephalopathy concentrations of 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid were increased in all three brain areas (196%, 204% and 264% of saline-treated controls, p less than 0.01), and concentrations of serotonin were increased in the frontal cortex (121%, p less than 0.01). In the frontal cortex and hippocampus of encephalopathic rats dopamine levels were increased (157% and 289%, p less than 0.05), and levels of noradrenaline (53% and 46%, p less than 0.05) were decreased associated with increased 3-methoxy-4-hydroxyphenylglycol levels (173% and 206%, p less than 0.05). The extent of these changes correlated with the stage of hepatic encephalopathy. In hepatic encephalopathy dihydroxyphenylalanine accumulation was increased in the hippocampus and unchanged in the cerebral cortex. Dopamine, noradrenaline, dihydroxyphenylacetic acid and homovanillic acid concentrations were unchanged in the striatum. The results of this study indicate that hepatic encephalopathy in thioacetamide-induced acute liver failure in rats is associated with neurochemical changes, suggesting an increased activity of the noradrenergic and serotoninergic neurotransmitter systems. 
4	In vivo technetium-99m S12 antibody imaging of platelet alpha-granules in rabbit endothelial neointimal proliferation after angioplasty. To examine the specificity of technetium-99m monoclonal antibody (S12) imaging for identifying activated platelets at interventional injury sites in atherosclerotic rabbit arteries, subgroups of unheparinized rabbits (n = 39) underwent serial percutaneous transluminal aortic angioplasty (PTA) procedures (with or without intravascular stent placement) followed by in vivo and then ex vivo gamma camera imaging, scanning, and immunoelectron microscopy to determine the intravascular loci of S12 Fab' antibody binding. Despite angiographic vessel patency, image-derived ratios of in vivo S12 binding in injured versus uninjured vascular segments were significantly increased (p less than 0.05) after one PTA (1.3 +/- 0.17, n = 7), PTA twice at 6-week intervals (1.4 +/- 0.22, n = 7), and PTA plus stent placement (1.6 +/- 0.28, n = 7) compared with control experiments (1.1 +/- 0.13, n = 7). Ex vivo imaging of blood-free excised aortas confirmed S12 localization at PTA (2 +/- 0.4, n = 3) and PTA plus stent placement (5 +/- 3.8, n = 7) sites (both p less than 0.05 versus controls). S12 antibody uptake decreased significantly (p less than 0.05) at 1 week after PTA plus stent placement in vivo (1.1 +/- 0.10, n = 4) and ex vivo (1.6 +/- 0.7, n = 3). Electron microscopic studies confirmed dense platelet, fibrin, and red blood cell deposition in regions of acute injury, with endothelial neointimal proliferation at 1 week after PTA. Immunoelectron microscopic studies confirmed specific in vivo S12 binding (22:1 versus nonrelevant IgG) at sites of alpha-granule GMP-140 expression in activated platelets. Therefore, S12 studies may be useful to localize sites of platelet-derived mitogen release at arterial PTA injury sites. 
2	Cerulein-induced pancreatitis in the ex vivo isolated perfused canine pancreas. Infusion of supramaximal doses of the cholecystokinin analog cerulein is well established as an in vivo technique for inducing experimental pancreatitis in small animals. An attempt was made to simulate this model and initiate pancreatitis in the ex vivo isolated perfused canine pancreas. Control preparations gained minimal weight (mean 8.3 +/- 5.1 gm), demonstrated no edema accumulation, and did not develop hyperamylasemia (mean 1342 +/- 790 units) after 4 hours of perfusion. Electron microscopy after 4 hours of perfusion remained normal. Intraarterial cerulein infusion produced significant weight gain (mean 27.6 +/- 12.3 gm; p less than 0.001), edema formation, and marked hyperamylasemia (mean 26,838 +/- 21,341 units; p less than 0.001) after 4 hours of perfusion. During the 4-hour perfusion, electron microscopy of cerulein preparations demonstrated depletion of zymogen granules, condensing vacuole formation, and basolateral exocytosis. Pretreatment of cerulein preparations with the free radical scavengers superoxide dismutase and catalase and the iron chelator deferoxamine did not modify the pancreatitis. Continuous infusion of the nonpeptide cholecystokinin antagonist L364,718 reduced cerulein-induced weight gain (4.3 +/- 3.4 gm; p less than 0.001) and hyperamylasemia (9392 +/- 6718 units; p less than 0.05). We conclude that cerulein pancreatitis in the ex vivo isolated perfused canine pancreatic preparation is identical physiologically, biochemically, and morphologically with that seen in intact animals. 
4	Pseudo pre-excitation with concertina effect in idioventricular tachycardia. The concertina effect is a phenomenon where the QRS complexes reflect alternating phases of gradual widening and narrowing. This is most commonly due to ventricular pre-excitation, and the changes in QRS morphology are due to variability of the ventricular zone that undergoes pre-excitation. This presentation reflects a case where the concertina effect is due to an idioventricular tachycardia at a rate nearly identical to the sinus rate. Variable degrees of ventricular fusion therefore occur, and the concertina effect ensues, in relation to slight variations of the sinus cycle. 
2	Acute and chronic stress in duodenal ulcer disease. Acute and chronic life event stressors were objectively assessed in a sample of duodenal ulcer patients and community controls. Stress was assessed on two dimensions, "personal threat" and "goal frustration." Chronic stressors (those of 6 months' duration or more) involving high goal frustration were significantly and independently associated with the onset and relapse of duodenal ulcers, as were acute events of high immediate but transient personal threat. 
1	Alterations in opioid parameters in the hypothalamus of rats with estradiol-induced polycystic ovarian disease. The distribution and density of selectively labeled mu-, delta-, and kappa-opioid binding sites were examined by in vitro radioautography in the hypothalamus of normal, estradiol valerate (EV)-injected, and estradiol (E2)-implanted female rats. Hypothalamic beta-endorphin concentration was also examined by RIA in these three groups of animals. Quantitative analysis of film radioautographs demonstrated a selective increase in mu-opioid binding in the medial preoptic area of EV-treated, but not of E2-implanted rats. However, both these estrogenized groups exhibited a reduction in the density of delta-opioid binding in the suprachiasmatic nucleus. Statistically significant changes between either estrogenized groups were not observed for kappa-opioid binding. Results on the hypothalamic concentration of beta-endorphin indicated a marked reduction in EV-injected animals with respect to controls. In contrast, the E2-implanted animals exhibited beta-endorphin concentrations similar to controls. The present results confirm the increase in opioid receptor binding previously reported in the hypothalamus of EV-treated rats and further demonstrate that this increase is confined to the medial preoptic area and exclusively concerns mu-opioid receptors. The concomitant reduction in beta-endorphin levels observed in the same group of animals suggests that the observed increase in mu-opioid binding could reflect a chronic up-regulation of the receptor in response to compromised beta-endorphin input. Given the restriction of this effect to the site of origin of LHRH neurons and the demonstrated inhibitory role of opioids on LHRH release, it is tempting to postulate that such up-regulation could lead to the suppression of the plasma LH pattern that characterizes polycystic ovarian disease in the EV-treated rat. 
5	Intravenous immunoglobulin treatment in patients with chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy. Clinical and laboratory characteristics associated with improvement. Of 52 patients fulfilling the criteria of chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy, 20 (38%) did not improve after intravenous immunoglobulin treatment, two (4%) had a short-lasting improvement and subsequent infusions had no effect, nine (17%) reached a spontaneously or therapeutically induced complete remission, and 21 patients (40%) needed intermittent infusions to maintain improvement. All patients who improved initially had symptoms that significantly interfered with life-style. After treatment, 90% of these patients were independent in their daily activities. Significantly associated with improvement were disease duration of less than 1 year, progression of weakness until treatment, absence of discrepancy in weakness between arms and legs, areflexia of the arms, and slowed nerve conduction velocity of the motor median nerve. The probability of improvement if all these features are present in 93%. 
4	Myocardial temperature during cardiac operations: influence on right ventricular function. Maintenance of right heart integrity is frequently neglected during coronary operations. Right ventricular dysfunction sometimes limits the success of the surgical procedure, however. In addition to the use of cardioplegic solutions, myocardial hypothermia during ischemic cardiac arrest seems to be an important factor for guaranteeing right ventricular performance thereafter. This study was designed to measure myocardial temperature in patients with coronary artery disease who have significant stenosis of the right coronary artery in comparison with those who do not have stenosis of the right coronary artery and to evaluate the influence of myocardial temperature on right ventricular hemodynamics after cardiopulmonary bypass. Right ventricular function was assessed by thermodilution technique, which allows measurement of right ventricular ejection fraction, right ventricular end-diastolic volume, and right ventricular end-systolic volume. Right ventricular temperature differed significantly between the two groups, with the lowest value of 15.1 degrees +/- 1.8 degrees C in the group without stenosis of the right coronary artery and a value of 22.2 degrees +/- 2.1 degrees C in the group with stenosis of the right coronary artery. Left ventricular and septal temperatures were without group differences within the investigation period. Right ventricular hemodynamics were impaired only in the group with stenosis of the right coronary artery with a decrease in right ventricular ejection fraction from 44.2% to 34.1% immediately after termination of bypass and an increase in right ventricular end-diastolic volume index (+38%) and right ventricular end-systolic volume index (+70%). Cardiac index decreased only in this group, too (-22.5%). Analysis of covariance revealed a significant correlation only between changes in right ventricular ejection fraction, right ventricular end-diastolic volume, and right ventricular end-systolic volume and the course of right myocardial temperature. It is concluded that right ventricular hypothermia is more difficult to achieve in patients with a diseased right coronary artery. Constant myocardial hypothermia, however, seems to be important in guaranteeing right ventricular function, which easily can be evaluated by the thermodilution technique. 
1	Cytomegalovirus infections in bone marrow transplant recipients given intensive cytoreductive therapy. Cytomegalovirus (CMV) infections were studied in 785 bone marrow transplant recipients given intensive cytoreductive therapy. CMV excretion occurred in 24%, viremia in 9%, seroconversion in 40%, and overall active infection in 47%. CMV disease was much less common. Retinitis, enteritis, and pneumonitis occurred in only one, five (less than 1%), and 55 (7%) of the patients, respectively. Allograft recipients were more likely to develop CMV disease than were autograft patients (P = .0001) despite comparable rates of active CMV infection. CMV disease was rare after primary infection in both autograft and allograft recipients (0 and 1%, respectively). In contrast, CMV disease occurred in 16% of seropositive allograft recipients. Among allograft recipients, risk factors for CMV pneumonitis were seropositivity, age greater than 10 years, and acute graft-vs.-host disease, while the use of cyclosporine as prophylaxis against graft-vs.-host disease was protective. Although active infection rates did not decrease, the rates of CMV pneumonitis in allograft recipients during successive years declined significantly (P less than .001). 
4	Effect of epinephrine and lidocaine therapy on outcome after cardiac arrest due to ventricular fibrillation. One hundred ninety-nine patients with out-of-hospital cardiac arrest persisted in ventricular fibrillation after the first defibrillation attempt and were then randomly assigned to receive either epinephrine or lidocaine before the next two shocks. The resulting electrocardiographic rhythms and outcomes for each group of patients were compared for each group and also compared with results during the prior 2 years, a period when similar patients primarily received sodium bicarbonate as initial adjunctive therapy. Asystole occurred after defibrillation with threefold frequency after repeated injection of lidocaine (15 of 59, 25%) compared with patients treated with epinephrine (four of 55, 7%) (p less than 0.02). There was no difference in the proportion of patients resuscitated after treatment with either lidocaine or epinephrine (51 of 106, 48% vs. 50 of 93, 54%) and in the proportion surviving (18, 19% vs. 21, 20%), respectively. Resuscitation (64% vs. 50%, p less than 0.005) but not survival rates (24% vs. 20%) were higher during the prior 2-year period in which initial adjunctive drug treatment for persistent ventricular fibrillation primarily consisted of a continuous infusion of sodium bicarbonate. The negative effect of lidocaine or epinephrine treatment was explained in part by their influence on delaying subsequent defibrillation attempts. Survival rates were highest (30%) in a subset of patients who received no drug therapy between shocks. We conclude that currently recommended doses of epinephrine and lidocaine are not useful for improving outcome in patients who persist in ventricular fibrillation. 
5	Management of penile gunshot wounds. The management of 10 cases of penile gunshot wounds treated at Henry Ford Hospital from 1982 to 1986 is reviewed. All patients were assaulted by low velocity weapons (handguns). Eight patients had associated injuries, predominantly to the genital region (thigh, pubis, and scrotum). There were 5 urethral injuries; 4 were treated with primary repair, the remaining patient underwent delayed repair, complicated by severe urethral strictures requiring reoperation. Blood at the urethral meatus was suggestive of urethral injury but microscopic hematuria was not. Five penile injuries did not involve the urethra and were treated by debridement and primary wound closure with no immediate or delayed complications. In dealing with these injuries we recommend a high index of suspicion for urethral and regional organ injury and primary urethral closure if at all possible. 
2	Induction of arthritis in rats by aqueous suspensions of mycobacteria without the use of oil. We report for the first time the induction of arthritis by an aqueous, rather than an oil, suspension of killed tubercle bacilli. This was accomplished in the highly susceptible dark Agouti strain of rats, by intraperitoneal injection during the healing phase of chemically induced peritonitis. The same procedure (injection after the induction of peritonitis) augmented the incidence of arthritis produced by bovine type II collagen and Freund's complete adjuvant. Enhanced delivery of antigen from the peritoneal cavity to regional lymph nodes in the postinflammatory state was responsible for this increase in the induction of arthritis. 
5	Cardiac pathology in 470 consecutive forensic autopsies. Cardiovascular disease continues to be the single most common generic cause of sudden and unexpected deaths. Atherosclerotic coronary heart disease and acute myocardial infarction are the most prevalent forms of fatal cardiac disease observed at autopsy. Other cardiac lesions are frequently listed as causes of death, but the prevalence of such lesions as incidental findings in the general population is unknown. In this study, 470 consecutive forensic autopsies were evaluated for minor and major anomalies. The most frequently observed major congenital finding was floppy mitral valve (5%). Tunneled coronary arteries, considered minor congenital findings, were seen in 29%. Atherosclerotic coronary heart disease was the most common major acquired finding, observed in 16% of cases. Of the 470 hearts, only 8% were considered normal. 
1	Common skin lesions of the elderly. The elderly patient can present with a variety of skin lesions of the head and neck. This article is designed to acquaint the otolaryngologist-head and neck surgeon with normal skin morphology and with the changes that occur with aging and sun exposure. Common benign and malignant skin lesions of the aging patient are discussed. 
4	Effects of nitroprusside on transmitral flow velocity patterns in extreme heart failure: a combined hemodynamic and Doppler echocardiographic study of varying loading conditions. To explore the mechanisms of change of left ventricular diastolic filling associated with preload and afterload reduction, the influence of nitroprusside on the transmitral flow velocity pattern, pulmonary capillary wedge pressure and left ventricular pressure interaction was studied in 11 patients with end-stage heart failure. Pulsed Doppler echocardiographic recordings of mitral inflow were obtained with simultaneous high fidelity left ventricular and phase-corrected pulmonary capillary wedge pressure recordings before and during levels of nitroprusside infusion. With nitroprusside, left ventricular systolic and end-diastolic pressures decreased by 14% and 41% (p less than 0.05, p less than 0.05), respectively, and cardiac output increased by 67% (p less than 0.05). The pulmonary capillary wedge-left ventricular crossover pressure decreased by 41% (p less than 0.05), but the time constant of isovolumetric left ventricular pressure decrease T was insignificantly changed. Isovolumetric relaxation time and acceleration and deceleration times of the early diastolic filling wave were significantly prolonged with nitroprusside infusion (p less than 0.05, p less than 0.05 and p less than 0.05, respectively). Peak early diastolic filling velocity was maintained (65 +/- 11 to 62 +/- 13 cm/s, p = NS) in spite of the decreased absolute crossover pressure. Changes in peak early diastolic filling velocity correlated weakly with changes in the crossover pressure (r = 0.48, p less than 0.05) and correlated better with the crossover to left ventricular minimal pressure difference (r = 0.78, p less than 0.05). Peak early diastolic filling velocity appears to be most affected by the early diastolic pulmonary capillary wedge to left ventricular pressure difference rather than the absolute pulmonary capillary wedge pressure. The lack of peak flow velocity change during nitroprusside infusion could be explained by either the associated decrease in left ventricular minimal pressure or downward shift of left ventricular diastolic pressure by the same amount as the decrease in pulmonary capillary wedge pressure. This may reflect a reduction of external constraint to ventricular distensibility produced by a reduction in filling volume in patients with a markedly dilated ventricle. Thus, a prolonged early diastolic filling period and preserved peak early diastolic filling velocity in spite of decreased left ventricular filling pressure and constant relaxation rate are associated with the beneficial effects of nitroprusside on left ventricular function in patients with severe congestive heart failure. 
1	Hormonal dependency of cerebral meningiomas. Part 1: Female sex steroid receptors and their significance as specific markers for adjuvant medical therapy. Female sex steroid receptors were examined in 50 human cerebral meningiomas. For estrogen receptors, high-affinity binding sites (dissociation constant (Kd): 0.05 to 0.2 nM) were found in the cytosolic fraction with a capacity of less than 4 fmol/mg protein in 10 meningiomas using a dextran-coated charcoal (DCC) assay. In the same cytosolic fraction, the solid-phase enzyme immunoassay revealed only one cytosol with a positive colorimetric reaction equal to 5 fmol/mg protein. However, in the nuclear compartment, none of the tumors stained positively for estrogen receptors with immunohistochemical techniques. In addition, the most convincing evidence for the absence of estrogen receptors was obtained by in situ hybridization using an oligonucleotide probe complementary to a fraction of the human receptor messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA). In none of the 50 meningiomas was the expression of estrogen mRNA coding for the estrogen receptor detected. For progesterone receptors, high-affinity binding sites (Kd: 0.3 to 2.6 nM) were found in 49 of the 50 tumors using a DCC assay. In the same cytosols, solid-phase enzyme immunoassay revealed that each tumor was positive for progesterone receptors. However, in the nuclear compartment, only five tumors had partially positive staining for progesterone receptors with immunohistochemical techniques. Within the confines of this study, it is concluded that: 1) the estrogen receptor is generally absent in meningioma tissue, and 2) the progesterone receptor is mainly absent in the nuclear compartment, leading to the conclusion that the cytosolic progesterone receptor may be an inactive form. This study suggests that female sex steroid receptors are not primarily involved in the proliferative rate of cerebral meningiomas and that they are of no current significance as markers for adjuvant medical therapy of most meningiomas. 
3	Pseudopsammomatous meningioma with elevated serum carcinoembryonic antigen: a true secretory meningioma. Case report. A sphenoid-wing meningioma in a 60-year-old woman was accompanied by elevated serum carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) levels, which returned to normal after removal of the tumor. Light microscopic examination revealed a secretory meningioma containing numerous pseudopsammoma bodies and a prominent vascular pattern. Immunohistochemical analysis showed the tumor cells and pseudopsammoma bodies to be CEA-positive. This case illustrates the possibility that secretory meningioma may be associated with clinically detectable secretion of CEA. The report also documents the rare occurrence of elevated serum CEA in a primary benign intracranial tumor. 
2	Mesenteric blood flow in patients with diabetic neuropathy. We examined flow velocities in the superior mesenteric artery and celiac artery in normal controls (group C, n = 11), diabetic patients (group D, n = 8), and diabetic patients with clinically evident autonomic neuropathy (group DN, n = 6) to further define the usefulness of duplex examination in the evaluation of the mesenteric circulation in normal and disease states. By use of a 3 MHz duplex scanner, peak systolic velocity, peak diastolic forward velocity, end-diastolic forward velocity, and peak diastolic reverse velocity were measured in centimeters per second before and after a standardized meal. The vessels' diameters in centimeters were also measured. After the meal peak diastolic reverse velocity disappeared in all patients. The average vessel diameter in the superior mesenteric artery (0.7 cm) and celiac artery (0.8 cm) did not change. Flow velocities in the celiac artery were not significantly altered by the meal. In the control group, peak systolic velocity in the superior mesenteric artery increased 38%, peak diastolic forward velocity rose 66%, and end-diastolic forward velocity increased by 70%. In the diabetic nonneuropathic group the changes were 15%, 98%, and 100%, respectively. These changes were statistically significant (p less than 0.01). On the other hand, the patients with diabetic autonomic neuropathy presenting a picture of gastroparesis did not exhibit the expected increases in postprandial velocities. Moreover, this alteration in blood flow velocity, although similar to that encountered in patients with intestinal angina, did not appear to be due to occlusive arterial disease on the basis of clinical examination and B-mode scanning. 
3	Spongiform encephalopathy transmitted experimentally from Creutzfeldt-Jakob and familial Gerstmann-Straussler-Scheinker diseases. A comparison was made of the effects of experimental intracerebral inoculation into marmosets of brain homogenates from a case of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD) and from a member of the Wo. family with cerebral amyloid and spongiform encephalopathy--the Gerstmann-Straussler-Scheinker (GSS) syndrome. All the inoculated marmosets developed spongiform encephalopathy (SE) after incubation times of 20-23 months in the CJD group and 25-32 months in the GSS group. Subsequent passage from 1 affected animal in each group resulted in SE developing after 17 months incubation. In every animal inoculated with CJD or GSS material and in the 2 passage experiments the most severely affected region of the brain was the thalamus which in all cases was almost totally occupied by vacuoles. Other grey matter masses were less severely and less consistently affected. Vacuolation was observed in the cerebellar granule cell layer as well as in the molecular layer and the brain stem was finely vacuolated in all cases. There were only minor and inconsistent differences between the disease transmitted from CJD compared with GSS and some differences between the original transmissions and the SE caused by passaged inocula. Severe astrocytic gliosis accompanied the spongiform changes but no amyloid was identified in any of the marmosets with experimentally transmitted disease. The pathogenesis of the spongiform change in the thalamus was studied in a series of marmosets by light and electron microscopy 3-22 months after the intracerebral inoculation of CJD or GSS homogenates and was compared with controls. Dilated irregularly-shaped cisternae and the large complex vacuoles typical of SE, present in abundance after 18 and 22 months incubation, were considered most probably to be derived from cisternae of neuronal smooth endoplasmic reticulum. 
1	Six years' audit of laboratory workload and rates of referral for colposcopy in a cervical screening programme in three districts OBJECTIVE--To determine laboratory workload and rates of referral for colposcopy in a three district cervical screening programme during 1983-9 to assess the feasibility of accommodating call up of all women at risk, recall at three year intervals (now five year intervals), and investigation of women with all degrees of abnormality. DESIGN--Analysis of computerised screening histories dating back to 1977 of women screened in the Avon cervical screening programme. SETTING--Three district health authorities covering the population of Bristol and Weston-super-Mare, comprising 800,000 people, of whom 250,000 were female residents aged 20 to 64. SUBJECTS--196,977 Women aged 20 to 64 screened in cervical screening programme since 1983. RESULTS--Laboratory workload devoted to follow up of women with abnormalities increased sharply between 1987-8 and 1988-9, with increases of 54% (from 2075 to 3196) in the number of smears for follow up of severe dyskaryosis and invasive cancer, 40% (from 1925 to 2695) for mild and moderate dyskaryosis, and 49% (from 1793 to 2677) for borderline change. The increases were partly explained by the introduction in April 1988 of protocols for follow up and investigation based on guidance in an intercollegiate working party report. The proportion of women with mild and moderate dyskaryosis who were recommended for referral for colposcopy increased steadily from 9.9% in 1983-4 to 79.9% in 1988-9, and for borderline change the proportions were 3.5% and 13.6% respectively. Of all women tested in 1988-9, referral for colposcopy was recommended in 3%. CONCLUSIONS--The increase in laboratory follow up work identified, if it continued, could result in half of existing laboratory capacity in Avon being devoted to follow up work by 1993, with little prospect of maintaining call, recall, and quality control. Investigation of all women with minor cytological abnormalities is neither justifiable nor sustainable and will undermine the benefits of screening by increasing the rate of false positive results and the financial costs. 
1	The relationship between bone morphogenetic protein and neoplastic bone diseases. The monoclonal antibody against bovine bone morphogenetic protein was used for demonstration of bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) in neoplastic bone diseases. The avidin-biotin-peroxidase complex method demonstrated that BMP mainly exists in the cytoplasm of tumor cells of osteosarcoma and chondrosarcoma. Immunostaining showed that a majority of osteosarcomas and all of the chondrosarcoma cells contained a large quantity of BMP. Conversely, none of the fibrosarcomas showed positive staining. Thus, it was possible to differentiate osteosarcomas from fibrosarcomas by immunostaining. In fibrous dysplasia of bone, BMP was abundant in the fibrocellular tissue that had osteogenic activity. In contrast, fibrous tissue of ossifying fibroma showed weak positive staining; only the osteoblasts rimming the bone showed a positive reaction. Immunostaining showed that BMP was also detected in other neoplastic bone diseases such as osteoma, chondroma, and other tumors. 
3	Effect of nicardipine on somatosensory evoked potentials in patients with acute cerebral infarction. We evaluated the effect of nicardipine, a calcium channel blocker, on somatosensory evoked potentials (SEP) in 26 patients with acute cerebral infarction. Post treatment, 58% (15/26) of the N20 and P25 latencies were prolonged in the affected hemispheres; 8% (2/26) were shortened; and 35% (9/26) did not change. The mean N20 and P25 latencies were significantly prolonged two hours post treatment in the affected hemisphere (N20, P less than 0.01, P25 P less than 0.01). Nicardipine (Ni) had no effect on SEP components in the intact hemispheres. Seventy five per cent of the 12 patients with hypertension had a decrease in blood pressure (BP) after taking nicardipine, but there were no undesirable side effects or worsening of neurological signs. Our study demonstrates that nicardipine prolongs the latencies of short-latency components of SEP in the affected hemisphere after acute ischaemic stroke and also decreases BP. These observations suggest that nicardipine therapy might impair neuronal function in the ischaemic zone. 
5	Retinal sensitivity in acute hypoglycemia. We measured retinal threshold sensitivity via automated computerized static perimetry in predetermined meridians in euglycemic diabetic subjects and in the same subjects during insulin-induced hypoglycemia. During periods of reduced blood glucose levels, decreased retinal sensitivity, most marked in temporal meridians, was observed. 
1	Indomethacin responsive hypercalcaemia associated with a renal sarcoma. An infant presented with a non-metastatic renal spindle cell sarcoma and hypercalcaemia, which resolved after treatment with indomethacin. There was in vivo and in vitro evidence that hypercalcaemia was mediated by circulatory prostaglandins. 
5	Techniques of adjustable suture strabismus surgery. Adjustable sutures allow eye muscle positions to be changed following strabismus surgery, when the patient is awake and able to cooperate in muscle balance testing. Bow-tie-knot and sliding-handle sutures can be adjusted within 24 hours after surgery. Scleral traction sutures, which can be used to fix the globe to periorbital tissues during postoperative healing, can be adjusted for up to 14 days after surgery. We describe these techniques as well as an adjustable loop suture for conjunctival closure. 
4	Management of hypertension and cardiovascular risk. Blood pressure reduction in hypertensive patients is a surrogate for the real therapeutic goal of reducing the risks consequent to hypertension. This surrogate is convenient but its use may have important therapeutic implications. Results of treatment with new antihypertensive agents, data from clinical trials, and insights into underlying mechanisms are reviewed. The overall success of antihypertensive therapy has been undeniable, but has reduced minimally the frequency of atherosclerosis and coronary events; metabolic disarray resulting from the agents used, especially thiazides and beta blockers, may have contributed to this. Electrolyte abnormalities predispose to malignant arrhythmias and sudden death during myocardial infarction. Left ventricular hypertrophy, a chief risk factor for coronary events, arrhythmias, and heart failure, responds selectively to antihypertensive agents. Similarly, progression of renal injury may be sensitive to the agents used. Obesity and hypertension frequently coexist. Evidence is growing that atherogenic abnormalities common in obese patients, such as insulin resistance, also occur in the nonobese patient and are sensitive to the antihypertensive agent selected. 
3	Diphenylhydantoin-induced hypogammaglobulinemia in a patient infected with human immunodeficiency virus. A case is reported of reversible panhypogammaglobulinemia in a human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected patient. Onset and resolution were temporally correlated with initiation and termination, respectively, of diphenylhydantoin therapy for a possible seizure. A rapid alteration in peripheral T-cell subpopulations was also noted in association with diphenylhydantoin administration. This case is compared with previous reports of diphenylhydantoin-associated hypogammaglobulinemia in non-HIV-infected patients. In addition, the case is discussed with regard to possible deleterious effects associated with the use of diphenylhydantoin as therapy for HIV-associated seizures or as an antiretroviral agent in HIV disease. 
5	Platysma myocutaneous flap for repair of hypopharyngeal strictures. Hypopharyngeal strictures, either isolated or in conjunction with laryngeal and esophageal strictures, can occur following lye ingestion. Extensive stricture formation requires reconstruction to create a functional funnel system that empties below the cricoid. Esophageal replacement is not a substitute for adequate hypopharyngeal reconstruction. The pectoralis major muscle is often inadequate, because it yields too much bulk and often leads to continued aspiration. The platysma myocutaneous flap for hypopharyngeal reconstruction has not been previously reported. The inferiorly based platysma myocutaneous flap was used in two of our patients with lye burns, and bilateral superiorly based flaps were used in one. All are able to eat normally and have no significant stenosis. The platysma myocutaneous flap is a relatively simple and reliable alternative that is within the capability of every head and neck surgeon. 
5	Hydromyelic hydrocephalus. Correlation of hydromyelia with various stages of hydrocephalus in postshunt isolated compartments. The clinical features and pathophysiology of specific forms of hydromyelia are analyzed in this report together with the chronological changes of associated hydrocephalus. Nine patients were studied; all had hydromyelia with varying degrees of associated hydrocephalus. Clinically applicable classification systems were used to evaluate the progression of hydrocephalus (Stages I to IV) and to define the compartment isolated after shunting in the previously communicating cerebral ventricles (Types I to IV). Four patients had Stage IV disease (holoneural canal dilatation); one had Stage II and four had Stage I disease (both Stages I and II with supratentorial hydrocephalus). All patients were initially treated by ventriculoperitoneal shunting at an average age of 9.9 years. Five patients had progressive spinal symptoms before or after treatment of their hydrocephalus. Two patients had Type III isolation (an isolated rhombencephalic ventricle) with a functioning ventricular shunt; ventriculography confirmed a communication between the fourth ventricle and the hydromyelia, and both patients improved after placement of a shunt in the fourth ventricle. The remaining patients had Type IV isolation (isolated central canal dilatation) with a functioning ventricular shunt. This study indicates that in some cases the pathophysiology of hydromyelia is closely related to associated hydrocephalus. A new concept of the development of an isolated compartment after shunting is proposed to explain the progression of hydromyelia in these cases. 
5	Orchiectomy versus oestrogen in the treatment of advanced prostatic cancer. The primary clinical efficacy of orchiectomy and the combination therapy of intramuscular polyoestradiol phosphate 80 mg monthly and oral ethinyl oestradiol 0.15 mg daily was evaluated by progression and cancer mortality rates in a series of 277 prostatic cancer patients representing part of the Finnprostate study. After a follow-up of 5 years there was a significant difference between the groups in terms of progression rate and prostatic cancer deaths. The oestrogen combination was more effective in delaying progression of the disease. The overall mortality rate was similar in both groups. About one-third of the patients were alive after 5 years. 
5	Mitral valve prolapse. When is it serious? Mitral valve prolapse can best be diagnosed with careful clinical evaluation, including dynamic auscultation. Treatment consists of reassurance, pharmacotherapy for troublesome symptoms, and careful monitoring for signs of complications. Most complications can be either prevented or treated. 
4	Afibrinogenemia and hypobetalipoproteinemia in a kindred. A 3-year-old boy with minor bleeding problems had no plasma fibrinogen measured by both clottable assay and immuno-precipitation. Low normal fibrinogen levels were present in the mother and father. Markedly decreased plasma cholesterol and apolipoprotein B levels were found in the father, proband's brother, and the paternal side of the kindred. The proband and his mother had normal plasma total cholesterol and apolipoprotein B levels. These findings are compatible with autosomal dominant transmission of hypobetalipoproteinemia and autosomal recessive transmission of afibrinogenemia. Two members of the father's family had plasma cholesterol levels below the fifth percentile but elevated levels of fibrinogen (6.0 and 4.4 g/L). Both have symptomatic coronary heart disease. Finding coronary heart disease with very low cholesterol but elevated fibrinogen levels is consistent with fibrinogen levels being an independent risk factor for coronary heart disease. 
1	Chylothorax as presenting manifestation of adenocarcinoma with probable gastric primary. Chylothorax is an unusual complication of various malignant neoplasms, generally lymphomas. The few reported cases of chylothorax with gastric and other abdominal malignancies have involved large abdominal masses with prominent adenopathy and chylous ascites. We describe a patient in whom chylothorax was the presenting manifestation of an adenocarcinoma with probable gastric primary, developing prior to any clinical or radiologic evidence of tumor. 
5	Biliary and gut function following shock. The aim of this study was to characterize the alterations in gallbladder and intestinal function after hemorrhagic shock and blood reperfusion in opossums. Animals were subjected to a shock of 30 mm Hg of arterial blood pressure for 60 minutes and resuscitated with blood reinfusion. Gallbladder epithelial ion transport, gallbladder motility in vitro and in vivo, gastrointestinal motility, and flora of the stomach and small bowel were studied 2 and 24 hours after shock. Changes at 2 hours included decreased gallbladder contractility in vitro and decreased emptying in vivo, loss of coordination with intestinal motor activity, decrease in frequency of intestinal electrical slow waves, and reduced duration of the intestinal migrating motor complex cycle. By 24 hours, gallbladder epithelial permeability was increased and in vitro contractility remained reduced but the in vivo functions showed partial recovery. Gastrointestinal flora was not affected by these changes. These data demonstrate that hemorrhagic shock and reperfusion affect digestive motility. The early timing of the alterations observed and the partial recovery 24 hours post shock suggest an ischemia-hypoxia mechanism of injury. 
3	Giant hemangioma of the liver with pain, fever, and abnormal liver tests. Report of two cases. In conclusion, we report the cases of two patients with large hemangiomas of the liver, abdominal pain, increased ESR and fibrinogen, increased serum alkaline phosphatase and gamma-glutamyltransferase activity, and normal white blood cell counts. Clinical and biochemical abnormalities disappeared after surgical resection. Increased ESR and fibrinogen are probably related to thrombosis within the tumor. This mode of presentation may suggest a diagnosis of hepatocellular carcinoma. 
5	Nausea, vomiting, and retching. Although nausea, vomiting, and retching have plagued mankind since antiquity, limited attention has been given to the three symptoms as separate entities. Although knowledge of symptom occurrence is essential to practice, nurses must focus on patients' response or distress to the occurrence of symptoms. The differentiation of symptom occurrence and symptom distress of nausea, vomiting, and retching is critical to the management and self-care demands of patients and the enhancement of their quality of life. Basic research on patterns of these individual symptoms and their components promises to provide a more progressive and fruitful approach to the patient response to these symptoms. 
3	Fungal meningitis. Fungal meningitis tends to be a subacute or chronic process; however, it may be just as lethal as bacterial meningitis if untreated. There are many similarities between the pathogenic fungi. Most of the fungi are aerosolized and inhaled, and initiate a primary pulmonary infection which is usually self-limited. Hematogenous dissemination may follow the initial infection, with subsequent involvement of the CNS. Rarely, trauma or local extension provides the route to CNS infection. The host is frequently, although not always, immunosuppressed. The hyphae of molds generally cause focal disease with hemorrhagic necrosis secondary to vascular thrombosis. The yeasts tend to cause a more diffuse process with the base of the brain being primarily affected, such that hydrocephalus is seen as a frequent complication of chronic disease. Diagnosis may be difficult, as the CSF may be normal, with negative smears and sterile cultures, although more often there is at least one abnormality indicating disease. Serologies (if available, depending on the fungus) may point towards the proper diagnosis, as may a careful travel history. Currently, amphotericin B is still the drug of choice in most situations; however, the newer azole antifungal agents offer great promise, especially in the treatment of cryptococcal meningitis. The precise role of such agents will remain unclear until appropriate large-scale studies of their effectiveness have been completed. The treatment of the unusual CNS mycoses will continue to be based on clinical experience, and reports of the use of new azoles in these diseases need to be critically evaluated. 
1	Malignant melanoma and pigmented lesions: a diagnostic and management dilemma. We document two cases of malignancy occurring at the site of partially removed benign nevi. Because of the difficulty in clinical diagnosis and the uncertainty in its behavior, we propose that any recurring melanocytic nevus expanding beyond the original surgical scar be re-excised and the specimen carefully analyzed to ensure complete removal. 
2	Safe performance of difficult laparoscopic cholecystectomies. Laparoscopic cholecystectomy has been advocated for the treatment of uncomplicated symptomatic gallstone disease, but has not been widely advocated for the management of more complicated gallbladder disease such as acute cholecystitis, previous surgery, or common duct stones. During the last 9 months, 360 patients underwent laparoscopic removal of their gallbladder. A total of 138 had a complicated presentation, making surgery more difficult. This article discusses the management of these patients with acute cholecystitis, previous surgery, or common duct disease. Using the described techniques, there were no complications or mortality. Laparoscopic management of difficult gallbladder problems is safe and effective. 
4	Prognostic importance of the serum magnesium concentration in patients with congestive heart failure. Magnesium abnormalities are common in patients with congestive heart failure but the clinical and prognostic significance of an abnormal serum magnesium concentration in this disorder has not been investigated. Therefore, the relation between serum magnesium concentration and the clinical characteristics and long-term outcome of 199 patients with chronic heart failure was evaluated. The serum magnesium concentration was less than 1.6 mEq/liter in 38 patients (19%), within the normal range in 134 patients (67%) and greater than 2.1 mEq/liter in 27 patients (14%). Patients with hypomagnesemia had more frequent ventricular premature complexes and episodes of ventricular tachycardia than did patients with a normal serum magnesium concentration (p less than 0.05). Even though the two groups were similar with respect to severity of heart failure and neurohormonal variables, patients with a low serum magnesium concentration had a significantly worse prognosis during long-term follow-up (45% versus 71% 1 year survival, p less than 0.05). Patients with hypermagnesemia had more severe symptoms, greater neurohormonal activation and worse renal function than did patients with a normal serum magnesium concentration but tended to have fewer ventricular arrhythmias. Hypermagnesemic patients had a worse prognosis than did those with a normal magnesium concentration (37% versus 71% 1 year survival, p less than 0.05). In conclusion, the measurement of serum magnesium concentration provides important clinical and prognostic information in patients with chronic heart failure. 
4	Cardiovascular and hormonal effects of calcitonin gene-related peptide in congestive heart failure. The effects of infusing human alpha-calcitonin gene-related peptide were studied in eight patients with congestive heart failure, five normal rabbits and five rabbits with adriamycin-induced cardiomyopathy. In patients with heart failure, calcitonin gene-related peptide caused a dose-dependent increase in cardiac output and decrease in pulmonary and systemic vascular resistance and pulmonary artery pressure. The systemic blood pressure and right atrial and pulmonary wedge pressures decreased only at the highest infusion rate (16 ng/kg per min). Heart rate remained unchanged. Plasma epinephrine increased (p less than 0.05), whereas aldosterone, atrial natriuretic peptide and prolactin concentrations decreased (p less than 0.05). Plasma norepinephrine, renin activity, cortisol and growth hormone concentrations remained unchanged. In both groups of rabbits, the drug decreased blood pressure and increased cardiac output and heart rate. There was a significant increase in renal blood flow (p less than 0.05). The peptide did not affect the contraction amplitude of human and rabbit ventricular myocytes. These findings suggest that calcitonin gene-related peptide is a vasodilator in the rabbit and humans with little direct effect on ventricular myocardium. This peptide may be useful in some forms of heart failure. 
3	White matter hyperintensities in dementia of Alzheimer's type and in healthy subjects without cerebrovascular risk factors. A magnetic resonance imaging study. T2-weighted (0.5 T) magnetic resonance images were used to study the prevalence of subcortical white matter hyperintensities (WMHIs) in 22 patients with dementia of Alzheimer's type (DAT), 20 age-matched older healthy control subjects, and 10 younger healthy control subjects. Exclusionary criteria for all groups included cerebrovascular risk factors. All subjects had Hachinski Ischemic Index scores of less than 2 and computed tomographic scans showing no infarct. The WMHIs were classified as periventricular WMHIs or deep WMHIs and graded 0 through 3 (0 indicated absent, and 3, severe). For the group with DAT and older control subjects, periventricular WMHIs and deep WMHIs were graded 2 or 3 in fewer than 17% and 27% of subjects, respectively, whereas in the younger control subjects, all ratings were grade 1 or less. Serum cholesterol and systolic blood pressure values, although within the normal range, were elevated significantly in older control subjects when compared with those in younger control subjects. No significant differences in WMHI ratings, blood pressure, cholesterol, or triglyceride levels were found between patients with DAT and age-matched control subjects. Systolic blood pressure levels correlated with the severity of periventricular WMHIs only in older control subjects. Age correlated with periventricular WMHIs and deep WMHIs within both the older control subjects and the patients with DAT. There was no significant correlation between WMHIs and the severity of dementia in the group with DAT. These results suggest that, in subjects screened for cerebrovascular risk factors, WMHIs are rare and occur with identical frequency in patients with DAT as in age-matched healthy control subjects. 
5	Unusual presentation of recurrent Wegener's granulomatosis. A 65-year-old woman presented with recurrent Wegener's granulomatosis following two years of immunosuppressive therapy and three years of complete remission. At her initial presentation, she had a characteristic x-ray picture showing multiple nodules with total resolution of these findings at three months. Five years later, at the time of clinical relapse, her chest x-ray film showed bilateral diffuse infiltrative disease. This change in radiologic presentation upon relapse of Wegener's has not previously been reported. Other unusual features include diffuse infiltrates as the pulmonary presentation and the long interval between cessation of therapy and relapse. We review the radiologic manifestations of Wegener's granulomatosis. 
3	Whither short-course chemotherapy for tuberculous meningitis? Short-course chemotherapy is well established for the treatment of pulmonary tuberculosis but not for extrapulmonary disease. We present a series of 35 cases in which chemotherapy for tuberculous meningitis was given for a period of less than 2 years. Short-term therapy was associated with recrudescence of tuberculous meningitis and, in some cases, with the development of deep cerebral infarcts and permanent neurological deficits. We think short-term chemotherapy for tuberculosis of the central nervous system is inadequate. 
4	Ventricular ectopy: significance and management. Ventricular ectopy is a normal variant of cardiac rhythm, and its significance in an individual is related to cardiac risk factors and the presence or absence of heart disease. Although there is good evidence in many forms of heart disease that complex VEBs indicate a high risk of death, treatment of asymptomatic VEBs with antiarrhythmic drugs has not been shown to improve survival and may be hazardous. Treatment should be directed at the underlying heart disease. Those with heart disease and severe symptoms resulting from VEBs will often require electrophysiological assessment as to specific antiarrhythmic therapy. Those without heart disease can usually be managed by reassurance and do not require antiarrhythmic drugs. 
3	Turner's syndrome, fibromuscular dysplasia, and stroke. We report a 43-year-old woman who presented with a right frontoparietotemporal ischemic stroke. She had been diagnosed with Turner's syndrome during childhood and had a history of chronic estrogen therapy. Cerebral angiography showed lesions characteristics of fibromuscular dysplasia involving the right internal carotid and right vertebral arteries. We are not aware of any previous reports describing an association between fibromuscular dysplasia and Turner's syndrome. Although chronic estrogen therapy cannot be ruled out as a cause of this patient's stroke, we suggest a possible etiologic relation between these two entities. 
1	Evaluation of hepatocellular carcinoma aggressiveness by a panel of extracellular matrix antigens. Invasion and metastasis requires a series of interactions between malignant cells and the extracellular matrix (ECM). Antigen markers that relate to these interactions were evaluated for prognostic correlation in human hepatocellular carcinoma. Basement membrane type IV collagen (cIV), type IV collagenase (cIVase), laminin, and laminin receptors (LRs)--all ECM antigens previously proposed to be modulated in association with tumor aggressiveness--were immunohistochemically investigated in 30 cases of hepatocellular carcinomas (HCCs). The pattern of antigen expression was correlated with 1) 36 months' clinical follow-up and 2) the pathologic grade. As a means of estimating the proliferation fraction, an additional antigen, Ki67, was also studied in this series. There were major differences in the distribution of cIV and laminin, and in the quantity of cIVase-, LR-, and Ki67-positive cells associated with grade and prognosis. A smaller quantity of cIV and laminin and a higher number of cIVase-, LR-, and Ki67-positive cells were detected in the poorly differentiated compared with the well-differentiated HCCs. The tumors with lower immunoreactivity for cIV and laminin components accompanied by a higher number of cIVase-, LR-, and Ki67-positive cells fall into a group with the poorest overall survival (P less than 0.006). The panel of antigens is proposed as a useful prognostic tool for evaluating HCC tumor aggressiveness. 
3	Double-blind comparison of topical lignocaine-prilocaine cream (EMLA) and lignocaine infiltration for arterial cannulation in adults. In a double-blind, double-dummy study, the efficacy of topical 5% EMLA cream was compared with that of lignocaine infiltration in alleviating the pain of arterial cannulation. Forty unpremedicated adults were allocated randomly to four groups to receive EMLA cream alone, EMLA and 0.9% saline infiltration, EMLA and 1% lignocaine infiltration or placebo cream and 1% lignocaine infiltration. Following arterial cannulation, pain was assessed by the patient using a visual analogue score and by an independent observer using a four-category verbal rating score. Significantly lower pain scores were observed in all patients receiving EMLA compared with those receiving placebo cream and lignocaine infiltration by both patient (P less than 0.01) and observer (P less than 0.001) assessments. There were no significant differences between the three EMLA groups. 
4	Effects of brief coronary occlusion and reperfusion on porcine coronary artery reactivity. The loss of coronary vasodilator reserve after ischemia-reperfusion may be due to endothelial injury, and this vascular dysfunction may contribute to functional alterations observed after ischemia. To determine whether endothelial dysfunction occurs after relatively brief periods of moderate low-flow ischemia in vivo, open-chest swine were subjected to 15 minutes of critical, subtotal left anterior descending coronary artery occlusion (80%) followed by 60 minutes of reperfusion. Serial measurements of regional coronary flow were made with the radiolabeled microsphere technique. After 60 minutes of reperfusion, the left anterior descending coronary artery was excised together with a section of the normally perfused left circumflex coronary artery to examine in vitro the relaxations to the endothelium-dependent dilators ADP and bradykinin and to the endothelial-independent dilators sodium nitroprusside and adenosine. Contractions to serotonin in quiescent rings were also examined. Endocardial and transmural blood flows recovered to preocclusion levels within 60 minutes of reperfusion, as did the epicardial-to-endocardial ratio. Vascular responses in isolated, reperfused left anterior descending coronary artery rings were significantly different from responses in control left circumflex coronary artery rings. Endothelium-dependent relaxations to adenosine diphosphate and bradykinin were significantly depressed in the left anterior descending coronary artery rings compared with left circumflex coronary artery rings (p less than 0.05). Serotonin-induced contractions were significantly greater in occluded-reperfused left anterior descending than in left circumflex coronary arteries (p less than 0.05). Relaxations to adenosine and sodium nitroprusside were not significantly different between the two groups. 
4	Studies of controlled reperfusion after ischemia. XXIII. Deleterious effects of simulated thrombolysis preceding simulated coronary artery bypass grafting with controlled blood cardioplegic reperfusion. This study tests whether simulated thrombolysis before controlled reperfusion (i.e., simulated coronary artery bypass) causes reperfusion injury that obviates the benefits of subsequent controlled reperfusion and results in unnecessary ventricular arrhythmias. Fifteen dogs underwent acute occlusion of the left anterior descending coronary artery. In 10 dogs we simulated thrombolysis after 1 hour of ischemia (delivering 10% to 15% of control flow at 5 ml/min), followed 1 hour later by either normal blood reperfusion at systemic pressure (to simulate percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty) in five dogs or regionally controlled blood cardioplegic reperfusion on bypass in five others to simulate coronary bypass. In five dogs ischemia was prolonged to 2 hours, and the initial reperfusate was blood cardioplegic solution on total vented bypass (to simulate primary coronary bypass). All hearts receiving simulated thrombolysis (100%) after 1 hour of ischemia had reperfusion-induced ventricular fibrillation. All hearts treated by simulated angioplasty recovered regional contractility (56% of control systolic shortening), whereas there was no (0%) recovery of spontaneous contractility after subsequent blood cardioplegic reperfusion, and only two (40%) dogs had contractile reserve capacity (6% +/- 49%). Conversely, surgically controlled blood cardioplegic reperfusion without preceding low-flow normal blood reperfusion after 2 hours of ischemia resulted in no ventricular arrhythmias (0%; p less than 0.05 versus simulated coronary artery bypass after simulated thrombolysis), 72% +/- 7% (p less than 0.05 versus simulated coronary artery bypass after simulated thrombolysis) recovery of regional contractility (ultrasonic crystals), and 114% +/- 11% (p less than 0.05 versus simulated coronary artery bypass after simulated thrombolysis) recovery of contractile reserve with calcium chloride stimulation. We conclude that controlled reperfusion (simulating coronary artery bypass) with blood cardioplegic solution produces immediate functional recovery and avoids the ventricular fibrillation that follows simulated thrombolysis despite the need for prolonged ischemic time. Preceding controlled reperfusion by normal blood reperfusion (simulated thrombolysis) shortens the ischemic time but nullifies immediate functional recovery possible by simulated coronary bypass and produces unnecessary arrhythmias. 
5	Complete jejunoileal necrosis due to torsion of the superior mesenteric artery. We have reported a case of small-bowel volvulus in which complete jejunoileal necrosis resulted from torsion of the superior mesenteric artery. This case was unusual not only because of the extent of necrosis but also because primary small-bowel volvulus is rare in adults. Despite nearly total small-bowel resection, the patient continues to do well 6 months postoperatively. 
4	Cardiac arrest due to spontaneous coronary artery dissection in a patient with coronary ectasia--a case report. Spontaneous coronary artery dissection is a rare event and only in a few patients has the diagnosis been angiographically confirmed during life. A spontaneous dissection of the right coronary artery was detected as a cause of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest in a patient with coronary artery ectasia. 
5	Reproduction of transfusion-related acute lung injury in an ex vivo lung model Leukoagglutinins are implicated in transfusion-related acute lung injury (TRALI). In the present study, severe lung vascular leakage was reproduced by application of a leukoagglutinating antibody of anti-5b specificity in an ex vivo lung model. The antibody originated from a multiparous donor-plasma, observed to cause noncardiogenic edema during transfusion therapy. Heated full plasma (anti-5b-titer 1/128) or purified immunoglobulin G fraction was used for the studies. Ex vivo isolated rabbit lungs were perfused with albumin buffer, and human granulocytes (PMN) were admixed to the recirculating perfusate. In presence of anti-5b antibody plus 5b-positive PMN plus rabbit plasma as complement-source, severe lung edema occurred after a latent period of 3 to 6 hours. Pulmonary artery pressure was only transiently and moderately increased, and the leakage reaction could be traced back to a several-fold increase in lung vascular permeability. In contrast, no vascular leakage was noted in lungs perfused in the absence of anti-5b antibody, PMN, or rabbit plasma. Moreover, no permeability increase occurred on use of 5b-negative PMN. This reproduction of TRALI in an ex vivo lung model corroborates the role of leukoagglutinating antibodies in initiating PMN-dependent respiratory distress and suggests a contribution of concomitant complement activation. 
2	Failure of hepatitis B immunization in liver transplant recipients: results of a prospective trial. Twenty patients with advanced liver disease, in need of transplantation, were given three injections of 20 micrograms and three injections of 40 micrograms hepatitis B vaccine to see if an antibody response could be obtained. Only 20% of patients developed measurable anti-HBs. One who failed to develop anti-HBs developed chronic hepatitis B after exposure to her infected sexual partner. Type of liver disease in the native liver, age, sex, sexual preference, timing of immunization (before or after transplantation), and dosage of hepatitis B vaccine did not seem to explain the lack of immunologic response to hepatitis B vaccine. It is presumed that immunosuppression, both from the underlying disease and from immunosuppressive medications, best explains our findings. Liver transplantation patients infrequently benefit from hepatitis B vaccine. It is possible that other vaccines given to prevent viral and bacterial illness may also fail to elicit immunologic response in such patients. 
1	Pathological observations of intrahepatic peribiliary glands in 1,000 consecutive autopsy livers. III. Survey of necroinflammation and cystic dilatation. Pathological changes and significance of intrahepatic peribiliary glands, hitherto poorly recognized intrahepatic elements, have been evaluated in our laboratory. In this report, we surveyed necroinflammatory and cystic changes of the peribiliary glands in 1,000 consecutive autopsy livers because these two changes coexisted frequently in the same liver. The necroinflammatory change was found in 228 livers (22.8%) and the cystic change in 202 livers (20.2%), and 103 cases showed both changes in the same liver. The necroinflammatory change was frequently found in intrahepatic cholangitis and extrahepatic biliary obstruction with bacterial infection, suggesting that biliary bacterial inflammation extends into these peribilary glands. This change was also frequent in systemic infection or septicemia without biliary bacterial infection, implying that the peribiliary glands were also damaged in such conditions without direct infection. The cystic change was frequent in livers with portal hypertension or obstruction, adult polycystic disease and necroinflammation of the glands, suggesting that the cystic change of the glands could occur as the result of the disturbance of intrahepatic circulation or as the result of inflammatory destruction of the glandular conduits. Some of peribiliary cysts may be of congenital origin. Dysfunction related to these pathological changes in the glands may diminish seromucous secretion and cause alterations in hepatic bile composition. The cystic change of the glands may retard bile flow by compressing bile duct lumina. 
4	Hyperresponsiveness of the extrathoracic airway in patients with captopril-induced cough It has been suggested that cough from captopril may originate from an increased sensitivity of receptors in the extrathoracic airway (EA). To explore this hypothesis, we assessed the responsiveness of EA and bronchi and the cough sensitivity to inhaled histamine in nine hypertensive patients with captopril-induced cough (group 1) during treatment and one month after withdrawal of the drug treatment. Nine patients who were asymptomatic while receiving captopril (group 2) and nine patients receiving no current treatment (group 3) served as controls. The EA responsiveness was assessed by using the maximal midinspiratory flow (MIF50) as an arbitrary index of EA constriction and was expressed as the histamine concentration causing a 25 percent decrease in MIF50 (PC25MIF50). PC15FEV1 was the index of bronchial responsiveness and PCcough (dose causing five or more coughs) was that of cough sensitivity. Airway hyperresponsiveness (EA-HR or BHR) was diagnosed when PC25MIF50 or PC15FEV1 were 8 mg/ml or lower. Patients with captopril-cough, as compared with controls, had significantly lower values of PC25MIF50, PC15FEV1, and PCcough; EA-HR and BHR were found, respectively, in seven and three of these patients and in none of the control subjects. In all the patients of group 1, cough and EA-HR resolved after withdrawal of captopril treatment, while BHR persisted in one. PC25MIF50, PC15FEV1, and PCcough were all significantly improved. Our findings suggest that cough during captopril therapy may originate from receptors in the EA. 
3	Brain protection: physiological and pharmacological considerations. Part I: The physiology of brain injury. Ischaemia, whether focal or global in nature, produces a sequence of intracellular events leading to increased cell permeability to water and ions including Ca++. There is a loss of cellular integrity and function, with increased production of prostaglandins, free radicals, and acidosis with lactate accumulation. These events may be exacerbated by glucose administration. Pharmacological agents aimed at alleviating ischaemic injury could be directed at decreasing cerebral metabolic requirements for oxygen, improving flow to ischaemic areas, preventing Ca+(+)-induced injury, inhibition of free radical formation, lactate removal, inhibition of prostaglandin synthesis, and prevention of complement-mediated leukocyte aggregation. Part I of this paper describes some of the pathophysiological events leading to ischaemic brain injury. Part 2 of this paper will consider the current agents available for brain protection. 
3	Nerve-muscle involvement in a large family with mitochondrial cytopathy: electrophysiological studies. Thirteen patients with mitochondrial cytopathy were investigated. They represent different generations, ages, stages, and severities of the disease. All were assumed to have the same metabolic defect. The disease is a multisystem disorder with a metabolic defect located at complex 1 in the respiratory chain. Clinically, the disorder gives symptoms such as hearing loss, retinal pigmental degeneration, ataxia, cardiomyopathy, muscular fatiguability and neuropathy. The patients were investigated with nerve conduction studies, concentric needle EMG, SFEMG, and macro EMG examinations. Neurophysiologic studies revealed signs of myopathy in both the younger members and in those with slight muscular symptoms. In the more advanced stages, neuropathic changes of the axonal type were seen as well. Macro EMG was interpreted as indicating muscle fiber membrane abnormalities in the early stages. Single fiber EMG studies indicate that this metabolic defect does not disturb neuromuscular transmission. 
4	Intraocular pressure increases with fenoldopam, but not nitroprusside, in hypertensive humans. Fenoldopam mesylate stimulates adenyl cyclase in porcine ocular trabecular meshwork and raises intraocular pressure in humans. To clarify whether this results from direct activation of the dopamine-1 receptor or indirectly from baroreflex sympathetic stimulation after blood pressure reduction, intraocular pressure was measured in 14 patients with accelerated/malignant hypertension, randomized between intravenous fenoldopam or sodium nitroprusside. Intraocular pressure was measured with a Perkins tonometer, before and at the twentieth minute of each dose increment. In seven patients with a mean blood pressure of 232/131 mm Hg treated with fenoldopam, intraocular pressure increased in a dose-dependent fashion, from 16 +/- 1 to 20 +/- 2 mm Hg (p less than 0.005). In contrast, seven patients with a mean blood pressure of 225/134 mm Hg treated with sodium nitroprusside exhibited no change in intraocular pressure (15 +/- 1 versus 14 +/- 1 mm Hg) despite similar blood pressure reduction. Increases in heart rate were not significantly different. Rates of urinary excretion of norepinephrine plus epinephrine increased significantly relative to baseline (p less than 0.05) but were not different between groups. These data suggest that the increase in intraocular pressure with fenoldopam results from specific activation of the dopamine-1 receptor and is not caused by baroreflex sympathetic stimulation. Because dopamine-1 receptors may modulate intraocular pressure, dopamine-1 receptor blockers might be useful therapy for glaucoma. 
4	The prevalence of retinal vascular abnormalities in children and adolescents with essential hypertension. We studied 97 children and adolescents with essential hypertension by evaluating photographs of the optic fundus and fluorescein angiography. Photographs were examined for the presence of arteriolar narrowing, tortuosity, and arteriovenous nicking. Intraobserver and interobserver variability in determination of abnormalities was low with agreement of 75% for narrowing, 90% for tortuosity, and 100% for arteriovenous nicking. The prevalence of abnormalities was 41% (95% confidence interval, 31% to 50%) for arteriolar narrowing, 14% (95% confidence interval, 19% to 21%) for tortuosity, and 8% (95% confidence interval, 5% to 11%) for arteriovenous nicking. Of 97 patients, 50 (51%) had one or more abnormality. Retinal abnormalities are relatively common in young patients with essential hypertension. 
1	Importance of sampling method in DNA analysis of lung cancer. Lung carcinomas are characterised by considerable histological variation within the tumour. The possible effects of this morphological heterogeneity on the estimation of tumour ploidy were investigated. Multiple tissue blocks were systematically taken from 20 lung tumours and analysed by flow cytometry. The routine, archival paraffin wax embedded diagnostic blocks from these cases were also analysed. Nineteen (95%) of the tumours were shown to contain aneuploid stemlines by systematic sampling, but if only one of these systematic tissue blocks had been taken from each case the incidence of DNA aneuploidy could have been as low as 45%. Only 15 (75%) tumours were aneuploid when all the routine archival blocks were analysed, but by specifically selecting tumour areas from the archival material the accuracy of this method was increased to 90%. It is concluded that tumour sampling methods are of primary importance in assessing the DNA content of lung tumours. Routine paraffin wax embedded archival tissue provides a suitable source of material for this purpose, provided that "turnover" selection is carried out. 
5	Ondansetron: a new entity in emesis control. Nausea and vomiting are serious problems for patients receiving cancer chemotherapy. Dopamine receptor and cholinergic receptor antagonism have been the target mechanism for agents used to combat drug-induced nausea and vomiting; more recently, blockade of serotonin receptors has been used for this indication. Current therapies are limited by extrapyramidal adverse effects, as well as drowsiness, sedation, respiratory depression, and cardiac effects. Ondansetron is an investigational serotonin antagonist that has documented effectiveness for cancer chemotherapy-induced emesis. Ondansetron appears to be well tolerated, with the possible exception of headaches and transient increases in liver enzymes. No extrapyramidal toxicities have been reported with this agent. While ondansetron looks promising, further studies are needed to fully define its role as an antiemetic. 
3	Visceral perception in health and functional dyspepsia. Crossover study of gastric distension with placebo and domperidone. The symptoms of functional dyspepsia are still unexplained. To evaluate the possible role of abnormal visceral perception, we studied the symptomatic responses and the pressure variations during progressive gastric distension in 10 female healthy control subjects (mean age 33.6 years) and in 10 female patients with functional dyspepsia (mean age 35.2 years). A rubber balloon was positioned 4 cm below the lower esophageal sphincter (LES) and inflated with progressively larger volumes of air by steps of 50 ml; pressures at the gastric fundus and at the LES were continuously recorded by perfused manometric catheters. Each subject was studied on two separate occasions after randomized double-blind administration of either placebo or 20 mg of domperidone. Symptomatic responses and the manometric data were analyzed at the time of the initial recognition of distension (bloating step) and at the time of reporting pain or up to a maximum of 700 ml of balloon inflation (pain or 700-ml step). On placebo, the volumes of gastric distension were more than two times lower in patients than in control subjects at the bloating step (185 +/- 32 ml vs 470 +/- 40 ml, P = 0.001) and at the pain or 700-ml step (265 +/- 54 ml vs 600 +/- 34 ml, P less than 0.005), while the pressure gradients (pressure at inflation steps minus baseline pressure before beginning inflation) were not statistically different between the two groups. 
3	Histopathologic correlation of magnetic resonance imaging signal patterns in a spinal cord injury model. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) provides a noninvasive method of monitoring the pathologic response to spinal cord injury. Specific MR signal intensity patterns appear to correlate with degrees of improvement in the neurologic status in spinal cord injury patients. Histologic correlation of two types of MR signal intensity patterns are confirmed in the current study using a rat animal model. Adult male Sprague-Dawley rats underwent spinal cord trauma at the midthoracic level using a weight-dropping technique. After laminectomy, 5- and 10-gm brass weights were dropped from designated heights onto a 0.1-gm impounder placed on the exposed dura. Animals allowed to regain consciousness demonstrated variable recovery of hind limb paraplegia. Magnetic resonance images were obtained from 2 hours to 1 week after injury using a 2-tesla MRI/spectrometer. Sacrifice under anesthesia was performed by perfusive fixation; spinal columns were excised en bloc, embedded, sectioned, and observed with the compound light microscope. Magnetic resonance axial images obtained during the time sequence after injury demonstrate a distinct correlation between MR signal intensity patterns and the histologic appearance of the spinal cord. Magnetic resonance imaging delineates the pathologic processes resulting from acute spinal cord injury and can be used to differentiate the type of injury and prognosis. 
4	Effective endothelialization of polyurethane surfaces. Response to shear stress and platelet adhesion. Biomer and Mitrathane are thromboresistant polyurethane ureas that are suitable for coating artificial valves. Degeneration of the surface coatings, however, does occur over time, and in experimental animal studies adherent thrombi have been observed as a complication. In this study, morphometric techniques applied to scanning electron microscopy were used to assess whether vascular endothelial cells harvested from jugular veins of fetal lambs could be grown to confluence on these polyurethane surfaces, whether the monolayer would remain intact under conditions of shear stress (104 dynes/cm2), and whether this would result in decreased platelet adherence of sheep platelets relative to nonendothelialized surfaces. The results have shown that both Biomer and Mitrathane could be endothelialized: 88.8 +/- 5.1% of the Biomer surface consisted of intact confluent endothelial cells, as did 95.45 +/- 1.7% of the Mitrathane surface. After 6 hr of shear stress, a significant reduction in this feature was observed (p = 0.02), but both materials still maintained a high percentage of confluent endothelial cells (78.65% for Biomer and 85.58% for Mitrathane). After 48 hr of shear stress, however, the percent confluence was similar to control values, which suggested new cell growth. Endothelialized Biomer compared with Mitrathane had fewer adherent single platelets, or small or large aggregates (p = 0.001, p = 0.01, and p = 0.05, respectively); this feature was not affected by shear stress. Whereas endothelialization of the surface clearly decreased platelet adherence on Mitrathane (p = 0.01), only a trend was seen with Biomer. These studies therefore show that endothelialization of these polyurethane surfaces is feasible. 
3	"Frontal lobe" utilization behavior associated with paramedian thalamic infarction. Disinhibited, exaggerated responses to objects and environmental cues (utilization behavior) occur predominantly with frontal lobe damage. We report a striking example associated with paramedian thalamic infarction suggesting a thalamofrontal component to environmental interactions that require inhibition, self-monitoring, and cognitive flexibility. 
2	Ondansetron compared with high-dose metoclopramide in prophylaxis of acute and delayed cisplatin-induced nausea and vomiting. A multicenter, randomized, double-blind, crossover study. OBJECTIVE: To compare the efficacy and side effects of ondansetron with those of high-dose metoclopramide in treating acute and delayed cisplatin-induced nausea and vomiting. DESIGN: Randomized, double-blind, crossover trial. SETTING: Conducted at two university hospitals, a cancer institute, and six community hospitals. PATIENTS: Of 125 patients, 95 were evaluable for the acute phase and 79 for the delayed phase. Major reasons for not being evaluable were no second course (14 patients), protocol violation (5 patients), and change in cisplatin dose (3 patients) for the acute phase, and rescue medication on day 1 (7 patients), protocol violation (3 patients), and inadequate data (4 patients) for the delayed phase. INTERVENTIONS: All patients received cisplatin, 50 to 100 mg/m2 body surface area (median, 75 mg/m2); none had previously received chemotherapy. Thirty minutes before the cisplatin administration, ondansetron was given intravenously over 15 minutes, at a loading dose of 8 mg followed by a continuous infusion of 1 mg/h for 24 hours. Metoclopramide was given at a loading dose of 3 mg/kg body weight, followed by a continuous infusion for 8 hours (4 mg/kg). For the delayed phase (days 2 through 6), the first oral dose was given as soon as the infusion was completed; the oral dose consisted of either metoclopramide, 20 mg three times daily, or ondansetron, 8 mg three times daily for another 5 days. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: In the acute phase, a major or complete response was seen in 72% of the ondansetron-treated and 41% of the metoclopramide-treated patients (P less than 0.001). Nausea was significantly better controlled among the ondansetron-treated patients (P = 0.04). In the delayed phase, no statistically significant difference was seen between ondansetron- and metoclopramide-treated patients. Nausea was significantly better controlled with metoclopramide (P = 0.016). CONCLUSIONS: Ondansetron is significantly more effective than metoclopramide in preventing acute nausea and vomiting. In the delayed phase, the results of both drugs were disappointing, although metoclopramide's effect on delayed nausea was superior. Patients preferred ondansetron. 
5	Follicular neoplasms of the thyroid in men older than 50 years of age. A DNA flow cytometric study The clinical behavior of follicular neoplasms of the thyroid in elderly men can be difficult to predict on histologic grounds alone. To assess the usefulness of DNA flow cytometry in predicting the metastatic potential of these tumors, the authors studied 44 primary and metastatic follicular neoplasms of the thyroid by DNA flow cytometry of paraffin-embedded tissue. The neoplasms were obtained from 44 men ranging in age from 50 to 79 years (mean, 60). There were 29 follicular adenomas, 11 primary follicular carcinomas (neoplasms with capsular and/or vascular invasion), and 4 metastatic follicular carcinomas. Follow-up information was available on 40 of the 44 patients. The mean follow-up was 114 months. Twenty-five of the 29 follicular adenomas had a diploid DNA content, 2 (7%) were tetraploid, and the DNA histograms on 2 were not interpretable. All patients with follicular adenomas had no evidence of disease (NED) at last follow-up. Eight of the 11 primary follicular carcinomas were diploid. Six of these patients had NED, one died with carcinoma at 82 months, and no follow-up was available on one. Three (27%) of the primary follicular carcinomas were aneuploid or tetraploid. Two of these patients had NED, and the third died with carcinoma 84 months after diagnosis. Two of the four metastatic follicular carcinomas were diploid and two (50%) were aneuploid or tetraploid. One of the two patients with diploid metastatic follicular carcinomas died with carcinoma, as did one of the two patients with aneuploid metastatic follicular carcinomas. These results suggest the following: (1) follicular carcinomas are more likely to be aneuploid or tetraploid than are follicular adenomas; (2) follicular neoplasms without capsular or vascular invasion may include a small number of aneuploid or tetraploid tumors; and (3) DNA ploidy does not add to the prognostic value of histologic studies alone. 
1	Changes in surgical treatments: the example of hysterectomy versus conization for cervical carcinoma in situ. From 1969 through 1985, 4584 women in the state of New Mexico were diagnosed with carcinoma in situ of the cervix. Of these women, 65.5% underwent hysterectomy while 31.1% had a conservative therapy (primarily conization). Over the 17-year period, there was a steady increase in the percentage of women receiving conservative therapies, from 11.8% in 1969 to 50.3% in 1985. Younger women, unmarried women and American Indian women were more likely to receive conservative therapy. This marked shift in therapeutic approach occurred during a time of apparent controversy as to the optimal treatment for cervical carcinoma in situ, and illustrates a rapid change in surgical practice in the absence of any controlled trials comparing the two major treatment modalities. 
5	Prochlorperazine and transdermal scopolamine added to a metoclopramide antiemetic regimen. A controlled comparison. Cisplatin-induced nausea and vomiting occurs both acutely and over a prolonged period of time. These symptoms may be incapacitating and are frequently given as a reason to discontinue therapy. We compared prochlorperazine and transdermal scopolamine when added to a standardized metoclopramide antiemetic regimen. Twenty-seven patients receiving cisplatin at 100 mg/m2 were randomly assigned to one of the two treatment arms. Patients were observed during chemotherapy and answered a standard questionnaire 24-26 hours later. Among similar treatment groups no differences were seen regarding the number of emetic events, level of nausea, degree of sedation or overall acceptability of one treatment arm or another. While not superior to prochlorperazine, transdermal scopolamine is a useful antiemetic agent and can be combined with metoclopramide in an attempt to reduce cisplatin-induced nausea and vomiting. Further evaluation of this approach is needed. 
4	Myocardial protein turnover in patients with coronary artery disease. Effect of branched chain amino acid infusion. The regulation of protein metabolism in the human heart has not previously been studied. In 10 postabsorptive patients with coronary artery disease, heart protein synthesis and degradation were estimated simultaneously from the extraction of intravenously infused L-[ring-2,6-3H]phenylalanine (PHE) and the dilution of its specific activity across the heart at isotopic steady state. We subsequently examined the effect of branched chain amino acid (BCAA) infusion on heart protein turnover and on the myocardial balance of amino acids and branched chain ketoacids (BCKA) in these patients. In the postabsorptive state, there was a net release of phenylalanine (arterial-cardiac venous [PHE] = -1.71 +/- 0.32 nmol/ml, P less than 0.001; balance = -116 +/- 21 nmol PHE/min, P less than 0.001), reflecting protein degradation (142 +/- 40 nmol PHE/min) in excess of synthesis (24 +/- 42 nmol PHE/min) and net myocardial protein catabolism. During BCAA infusion, protein synthesis increased to equal the degradation rate (106 +/- 24 and 106 +/- 28 nmol PHE/min, respectively) and the phenylalanine balance shifted (P = 0.01) from negative to neutral (arterial-cardiac venous [PHE] = 0.07 +/- 0.36 nmol/ml; balance = 2 +/- 25 nmol PHE/min). BCAA infusion stimulated the myocardial uptake of both BCAA (P less than 0.005) and their ketoacid conjugates (P less than 0.001) in proportion to their circulating concentrations. Net uptake of the BCAA greatly exceeded that of other essential amino acids suggesting a role for BCAA and BCKA as metabolic fuels. Plasma insulin levels, cardiac double product, coronary blood flow, and myocardial oxygen consumption were unchanged. These results demonstrate that the myocardium of postabsorptive humans is in negative protein balance and indicate a primary anabolic effect of BCAA on the human heart. 
4	The role of peripheral capacitance and resistance vessels in hypotension following hemodialysis. The arterial pressure (AP) response to hemodialysis was studied with echocardiography and strain gauge plethysmography in 17 patients with end-stage renal disease; mean AP was unchanged in seven (group A) and was reduced by more than 10 mm Hg in 10 patients (group B). Following dialysis, body weight decreased and heart rate increased equally in both groups. Ejection fraction did not change in the two groups. Left ventricular end-diastolic volume fell by 13 +/- 10% in group A and by 24 +/- 16% in group B. Cardiac index (CI) fell in group B, but remained unchanged in group A. Systemic vascular resistance (SVR) did not change in both groups. The change in mean AP before and after dialysis was significantly correlated with that in Cl (r = 0.49, p less than 0.05), but not with that in SVR. Calf venous pressure-volume curves were not different between the two groups before dialysis. Hemodialysis shifted the curve toward the volume axis for group B but not for group A. These results suggest that hypotension following dialysis is mainly due to the fall in cardiac output, in which increases in venous distensibility play an important role. 
4	Echocardiographic evaluation of cardiac structure and function in elderly subjects with isolated systolic hypertension One hundred four participants in the Systolic Hypertension in the Elderly Program (SHEP) trial (mean age 71 +/- 6 years) were examined by Doppler echocardiography to gain information on the cardiac structural and functional alterations in isolated systolic hypertension. Participants had a systolic blood pressure greater than 160 mm Hg with diastolic blood pressure less than 90 mm Hg and were compared with 55 age-matched normotensive control subjects. Left ventricular mass index was significantly higher in the participants than in the normotensive subjects (103 +/- 28 versus 87 +/- 23 g/m2, p = 0.0014) and 26% of the participants met echocardiographic criteria for left ventricular hypertrophy compared with 10% of normotensive subjects. Left atrial index was also greater in participants than in normotensive subjects (2.26 +/- 0.32 versus 2.11 +/- 0.24 cm/m2, p = 0.005) and 51% of participants had left atrial enlargement. Doppler measures of diastolic filling were significantly different between the two groups, with peak atrial velocity higher (76 +/- 17 versus 69 +/- 17 cm/s, p = 0.02) and ratio of peak early to atrial velocity lower (0.76 +/- 0.23 versus 0.86 +/- 0.22, p = 0.0124) in participants. There was no correlation between left ventricular mass index and Doppler measures of diastolic function, but relative wall thickness correlated significantly with peak atrial velocity (r = 0.22, p = 0.016) and peak early to peak atrial velocity ratio (r = 0.24, p = 0.007). There was no difference in M-mode ejection phase indexes of systolic performance (shortening fraction and peak velocity of circumferential fiber shortening) between the two groups. 
4	Femur fracture with limb shortening causing occlusion of a polytetrafluoroethylene femoral popliteal graft. Traumatic occlusion of lower extremity polytetrafluoroethylene arterial grafts is exceedingly rare. We report a patient who suffered a supracondylar femur fracture resulting in shortening of her right lower extremity with kinking and thrombosis of her above-knee polytetrafluoroethylene arterial graft. This is the first report in the English language of prosthetic graft occlusion as a result of traumatic limb shortening. The graft thrombus was successfully lysed by use of intraarterial urokinase, and the kink was repaired by graft resection and reanastomosis. The mechanism of injury and treatment are discussed. 
1	Migration stimulating activity in serum of breast cancer patients. An assay to measure the ability to stimulate migration of fibroblasts into collagen gel was carried out on serum from treated and untreated breast cancer patients and from healthy controls. Migration stimulating activity was found in the serum of 10 (83%) of 12 untreated breast cancer patients immediately before surgical resection of the primary tumour and in 9 (75%) of them 4 days after resection; in 13 (93%) of 14 patients 1-13 years after tumour resection who had received adjuvant treatment; and in 2 (10%) of 20 healthy women matched for age. The migration stimulating activity in cancer patients' serum was indistinguishable from the migration stimulating factor produced in vitro by fetal and cancer patient skin fibroblasts in its behaviour in various biochemical fractionation procedures. The presence of this activity in the serum of treated breast cancer patients clearly distinguishes it from other oncofetal proteins, which all seem to be produced by tumours. 
5	Treatment of condyloma acuminatum with three different interferon-alpha preparations administered parenterally: a double-blind, placebo-controlled trial. One hundred seventy-eight patients were enrolled in a placebo-controlled trial to evaluate three interferon-alpha preparations administered parenterally for the treatment of condyloma acuminatum. When all interferon groups were combined and compared with placebo, interferon recipients had greater rates of complete, 75%, 50%, and 25% lesion resolution than did placebo recipients (P = .21, P = .14, P = .02, and P = .02, respectively). Rates of lesion resolution were higher among women than among men, and women were more likely than men to respond to interferon. Virologic measurements in paired lesion biopsies did not correlate with interferon treatment or disease outcome. Although interferon toxicity was observed frequently, no participant withdrew from the study because of side effects, and dosage alterations were not required. Parenterally administered interferon-alpha is more effective than placebo in treating condyloma acuminatum, although rates of complete response are low. Different regimens, including combination therapy, should be evaluated for treatment of this common sexually transmitted disease. 
5	Diurnal fluctuations of arterial ketone body ratio in normal subjects and patients with liver dysfunction. To explore the metabolic aspects of chronic liver disease, diurnal changes of arterial ketone body ratio (acetoacetate/3-hydroxybutyrate), reflecting hepatic mitochondrial redox potential, were investigated in normal subjects, patients with chronic liver disease (Child's class A or B), and patients with hepatic failure (Child's class C). Ketone body ratio in normal subjects increased after breakfast from 0.96 to 2.00, after lunch from 2.17 to 2.38, and after dinner from 1.23 to 2.55 with blood glucose level ranging from 103 to 141 mg/dL (5.7 to 7.8 mmol/L). By contrast, the ketone body ratio in the Child A or B group changed little and remained within a range of 0.70-1.35 despite a large change in blood glucose level from 102 to 176 mg/dL (5.7 to 9.8 mmol/L). Ketone body ratio in Child's class C remained near or below 0.4 with no response to glucose administration, despite a marked elevation in blood glucose level. These results indicate that hepatic mitochondrial redox potential undergoes diurnal changes in sharp response to meals in normal liver function but that these fluctuations are absent in patients with liver damage (Child's class A, B, and C). Furthermore, it remains at low levels in severe liver failure (Child's class C). It is also suggested that hepatic mitochondrial redox potential plays an important role in the regulation of blood glucose levels. 
5	Late postoperative episodic and constant hypoxaemia and associated ECG abnormalities. Twenty-two patients without cardiopulmonary disease and undergoing elective major abdominal surgery were monitored continuously with a Holter tape recorder and a pulse oximeter on one night before operation and the first two nights after operation (23:00 to 07:00), without oxygen therapy. Mean heart rate increased 16 beat min-1 (P less than 0.001) and mean oxygen saturation (SaO2) decreased 2.6% (P less than 0.001) after operation. Episodic oxygen desaturation to less than 80% occurred in four patients before operation, but in 13 patients after operation (P less than 0.05). ECG abnormalities were observed in 10 patients before operation and in 16 patients after operation (ns). Individual maximum ST depression was more pronounced after than before operation (P less than 0.05). Episodic desaturation was related closely to tachycardia in six patients before operation and one patient after operation; before operation to atrioventricular block in one patient, and after operation to ST depression in two patients. Mean SaO2 on the second night after operation correlated with total dose of opioid for pain relief (rs = -0.48; P less than 0.05), and postoperative decrease in SaO2 correlated with postoperative increase in heart rate (rs = -0.43; P less than 0.05). No patient had postoperative cardiac complications indicating treatment. 
5	Late potentials and inducible ventricular tachycardia in surgically repaired congenital heart disease. We compared signal-averaged electrocardiography with invasive electrophysiological study in patients after surgical repair of congenital heart disease to determine if potentially useful correlations exist between the two methods for assessment of risk for ventricular tachycardia. Thirty-one patients (age, 1-49 years; mean, 10.6 years) with congenital heart disease repaired with right ventriculotomy or postrepair right bundle branch block (77% postoperative tetralogy of Fallot) who had electrophysiological study were studied with signal-averaged electrocardiography. Patients were classified by electrophysiological study results as having no inducible ventricular tachycardia, nonsustained ventricular tachycardia, or sustained ventricular tachycardia. Signal-averaged electrocardiograms were examined for the duration of low-amplitude (less than or equal to 40 microV) QRS signal, duration of total QRS, and root-mean-square voltage of the terminal 40 msec of the QRS. Low-amplitude terminal root-mean-square voltage of 100 microV or less had 91% sensitivity and 70% specificity for ventricular tachycardia inducible by electrophysiological study. Similar sensitivity but less specificity were seen using the criterion of 20 msec or more total low-amplitude QRS signal (initial plus terminal) or using total QRS duration of 128 msec or more. There was a weaker association between terminal low-amplitude QRS signal of 15 msec or more and inducible ventricular tachycardia. 
5	Experimental models of temporal lobe epilepsy: new insights from the study of kindling and synaptic reorganization. Temporal lobe epilepsy is a common localization-related epileptic syndrome characterized by complex partial seizures, ictal and interictal epileptic discharges arising from limbic structures of the temporal lobe, and association with hippocampal sclerosis. Temporal lobe epilepsy may follow perinatal injury and febrile convulsions, may be progressive, and frequently becomes refractory to standard antiepileptic therapy. The neurobiology that underlies these features of temporal lobe epilepsy is not known. Recent studies in experimental models have provided new insights that may help clarify the relationship of seizures, hippocampal sclerosis, and temporal lobe epilepsy. Observations from the study of the hippocampus with kainic acid-induced lesions, the kindling model, and other experimental models of epilepsy have demonstrated that seizures induce structural and electrophysiologic alterations in hippocampal pathways that may lead to increased excitability and could play a role in the development and progression of temporal lobe epilepsy. These alterations include mossy fiber synaptic reorganization, induction of NMDA-mediated synaptic transmission, and progressive hippocampal neuronal loss induced by brief kindled seizures. Some of the structural alterations induced by kindling have also been observed in the human epileptic temporal lobe, raising the possibility that mechanisms operative in kindling may play a role in the pathogenesis of hippocampal sclerosis and in the syndrome of human temporal lobe epilepsy. 
5	Analysis of alterations in the retinoblastoma gene and tumor grade in bone and soft-tissue sarcomas. We examined 43 sporadic bone and soft-tissue sarcomas for molecular genetic alterations affecting the retinoblastoma susceptibility gene Rb-1 (also known as RB1). The gene was altered in 6 of 14 sporadic osteosarcomas and in 5 of 29 other bone and soft-tissue sarcomas. Rb-1 messenger RNA (mRNA) transcripts were detected in normal tissues and benign lipomas, but they were absent or altered in each of the 19 sarcomas we examined. To examine the association of deletions in the Rb-1 gene with tumor grade, we correlated the DNA alterations in the Rb-1 gene with clinical data for 36 patients. The Rb-1 gene was altered in 40% of high-grade bone and soft-tissue tumors, but not in low-grade bone tumors and in only one low-grade, soft-tissue sarcoma. Overall, 10 of 25 high-grade sarcomas had detectable alterations of the Rb-1 gene compared with only 1 of 11 low-grade tumors. 
5	Recurrent childhood myoglobinuria. Recurrent heritable childhood myoglobinuria is a potentially fatal entity (mortality up to 35%) in which prompt diagnosis and treatment are critical. Sixty childhood cases have been reported between 1910 to 1988, most with undiagnosed etiologies. We have studied an additional 40 cases referred to CPMC (1980-1988), suggesting that this condition is largely underdiagnosed or unreported. We have found important differences between the childhood and adult-onset cases. Of 77 cases of adult-onset recurrent myoglobinuria, 45% have been diagnosed biochemically. In contrast, only 30% of the 60 childhood cases from the literature have been diagnosed; 11 with CPT deficiency and 7 with various glycolytic defects, and only 5 of our 40 childhood cases have been diagnosed, all with CPT deficiency. The 100 combined childhood cases can be divided into an exertional group (type I) with exertion as the leading precipitating factor (46 literature and 10 CPMC cases), a toxic group (type II) with infection and/or fever as the primary precipitant (14 literature and 23 CPMC cases), and 7 undefined cases. The type I group resembles the adult-onset group in which exercise is also the leading precipitating factor. There is a slight female predominance (male/female = 1:1.3) in the toxic group vs. a marked male predominance in the exertional and adult groups (4:1). Only 4 of 37 cases (11%) of the toxic group are diagnosed (all with CPT deficiency) vs. 19 of 56 cases (34%) of the exertional group (12 CPT, 7 glycolytic) and 45% of the adult group. The toxic group is also differentiated by a higher mortality rate and by the presence of additional clinical features, including ictal bulbar signs (8 of 18), encephalopathy (4 of 19), and seizures (2 of 7), as well as persistent cardiac abnormalities, developmental delay (4 of 17), and dysmorphic features (2 of 9). These clinical characteristics clearly differentiate the childhood from the adult cases and suggest the presence of more generalized disease processes and different biochemical etiologies. A study of the heritable causes of myoglobinuria is important because identification of the biochemical defect may elucidate the pathogenetic mechanism of the myoglobinuria and facilitate the development of rational treatment strategies aimed at circumventing or correcting the metabolic block. 
4	Kawasaki disease: echocardiographic features in 91 cases presenting in the United Kingdom. Ninety-one patients with Kawasaki disease were examined by cross sectional echocardiography between 1980 and 1988. In the 75 patients evaluated during the acute phase of the illness (the first month), the first echocardiographic examination was carried out at a mean time of 16 days (range 5-30) and coronary arterial lesions were seen in 21 (28%). Two patients with medium sized aneurysms had myocardial infarctions, and one died. Coronary arterial lesions persisted in 17 (23%) patients, most often in younger children. The remaining 16 patients were examined from one month to four years after their acute illnesses, and this group did not have coronary arterial abnormalities. Seven patients with coronary artery lesions have reached school age and require regular echocardiographic examination and exercise electrocardiography. Selective coronary arteriography may be indicated in some patients to identify coronary artery stenosis, which the Japanese experience has shown may progress for several years after the acute illness. 
5	Hemodynamic benefit of maintaining atrioventricular synchrony during cardiac pacing in critically ill patients. OBJECTIVE: To determine the hemodynamic effects of maintaining atrioventricular synchrony during emergency cardiac pacing in critically ill patients. DESIGN: Prospective, within patient double-blind study. SETTING: ICU or coronary care unit patients in a university hospital. PATIENTS: Forty (23 cardiac surgery, ten acute myocardial infarction, and seven general intensive care) seriously ill patients with severe symptomatic bradycardia. INTERVENTION: Initial randomization of patients to receive either a pacing mode where atrioventricular synchronization was maintained (atrioventricular pacing: atrial demand, atrioventricular sequential, atrioventricular universal) or a mode of pacing where atrioventricular synchrony was not preserved (ventricular demand pacing). MEASUREMENTS and MAIN RESULTS: The cardiac output increased from a mean of 4.5 +/- 1.7 L/min (95% confidence intervals: 4.0 to 5.0 L/min) during ventricular demand pacing to 5.3 +/- 1.7 L/min (95% confidence intervals: 4.9 to 5.9 L/min) during atrioventricular pacing (p less than .0001) despite trivial decreases in CVP from 14 +/- 4 mm Hg (95% confidence intervals: 13 to 15 mm Hg) to 13 +/- 5 mm Hg (95% confidence intervals: 12 to 15 mm Hg) and pulmonary artery occlusion pressure from 18 +/- 5 mm Hg (95% confidence intervals: 16 to 20 mm Hg) to 17 +/- 5 mm Hg (95% confidence intervals: 15 to 18 mm Hg). At the same time, mean arterial pressure (MAP) increased from 74 +/- 15 mm Hg (95% confidence intervals: 64 to 79 mm Hg) to 83 +/- 15 mm Hg (95% confidence intervals: 80 to 88 mm Hg) and left ventricular stroke work index from 22 +/- 10 g.m/m2 (95% confidence intervals: 19 to 25 g.m/m2) to 30 +/- 11 g.m/m2 (95% confidence intervals: 26 to 33 g.m/m2). There was no significant change in mean pulmonary artery pressure, pulmonary vascular resistance index, or systemic vascular resistance index. CONCLUSION: When cardiac pacing is required in critically ill patients, maintaining atrioventricular synchrony increases stroke volume, cardiac output, and MAP apparently with minimal effects on preload and afterload. 
3	Hoarseness as the sole presenting symptom of foramen magnum meningioma. Foramen magnum tumours are rare. They may present with bizarre symptoms and mimic many conditions. We report a presentation with the sole complaint of hoarseness, never previously described in the literature. Voice returned to normal after surgical removal of the foramen magnum meningioma. 
3	The natural history of non-arteritic anterior ischaemic optic neuropathy. Seventy one patients with non-arteritic anterior ischaemic optic neuropathy were studied retrospectively. Sixty three (89%) were followed to the end of the study or death, mean follow up time was 5.3 years. Whilst twenty (28%) had diabetes or hypertension, in thirty nine (55%) no predisposing condition was identified. In those who had monocular disease at presentation (68), subsequent involvement of the second eye occurred in seventeen (25%), seven within the first year. Nineteen patients died within the study period. Of these, nine died from myocardial infarction and four from cerebrovascular disease. This is a significant increase above figures calculated from the Office of Population Census and Surveys (p less than 0.001 for all causes, p less than 0.002 for myocardial infarction and cerebrovascular disease). Such an increase in mortality has not been previously reported, and implies that this condition carries a more sinister systemic prognosis than is frequently supposed. 
5	Death and functional outcome after spontaneous intracerebral hemorrhage. A prospective study of 166 cases using multivariate analysis Using death and functional status as end points, we prospectively analyzed the outcome 6 months after spontaneous intracerebral hemorrhage in 166 patients admitted to an acute-care stroke unit on the first day of their stroke. Seventy-one patients (43%) died, 69 (42%) had a satisfactory outcome, and 26 (16%) had a poor functional outcome. Early (30-day) survival was correlated with morphologic parameters on the initial computed tomogram (hemorrhage size, midline shift, and intraventricular spread of the hemorrhage), while later (6-month) survival was correlated with age. Using logistic regression, we found five independent predictors of satisfactory outcome at 6 months: age, hemorrhage size, intraventricular spread of the hemorrhage, limb paresis, and communication disorders. Of these, age was the most important predictor by far. 
2	Glucose and fat metabolism during short-term starvation in cirrhosis. To evaluate the metabolic consequences of short-term (i.e., less than 24 hours) starvation, glucose and fat metabolism were studied in eight healthy subjects and in eight patients with stable cirrhosis after 16-hour and again after 22-hour starvation by 3-[3H]glucose and [14C]palmitate turnover and by indirect calorimetry. Although patients and controls showed significant increases in free fatty acid concentration (respectively, 48% +/- 12% and 53% +/- 17%) and turnover (55% +/- 14% and 71% +/- 21%) during short-term starvation, the values after 16- and after 22-hour starvation were higher in cirrhosis. Fat oxidation was enhanced in the patients, but did not increase during fasting in contrast to controls (increase 19% +/- 17%, P less than 0.05). Net glucose oxidation was decreased in postabsorptive cirrhotics (P less than 0.05). Although postabsorptive glucose turnover was not different from controls, starvation induced a greater decrease in glucose turnover in the patients (25% +/- 3% vs. 10% +/- 3%, P less than 0.05). This was not reflected in plasma glucose concentrations. In conclusion, the effects of starvation on glucose and fat metabolism are enhanced in cirrhosis; fasting hypoglycemia is prevented by decreased use of glucose. It remains to be established whether these changes are merely explained by defective liver function, per se. 
4	Hyperkalaemia during rapid blood transfusion and hypovolaemic cardiac arrest in children. A morbidity and mortality review documented a high occurrence of hyperkalaemia in cardiac arrests associated with rapid blood transfusion, which resulted in further study. In order to stimulate events during rapid blood transfusion and cardiac arrest, the central circulation was modeled as a linear one compartment, and used to stimulate a child who suffered a hypovolaemic cardiac arrest and was resuscitated with rapid blood transfusion (RBT). The simulation suggested that the combination of RBT and a low cardiac output state could be associated with hyperkalaemia, if the potassium concentration in the plasma fraction of the transfused blood was greater than or equal to 10 mmol.L-1. In an associated clinical study the plasma potassium concentration during cardiac arrest was documented from a retrospective review of 138 cardiac arrests in a paediatric population. Patients were divided into two groups. The RBT-group received a rapid blood transfusion during resuscitation. The non-RBT group did not receive blood during resuscitation. During cardiac arrest the plasma [K] in the non-RBT group was 5.63 +/- 2.39 mmol.L-1 compared with 8.23 +/- 1.99 mmol.L-1 in the RBT-group (P less than 0.05). The hyperkalaemia during cardiac arrest in the RBT-group could be explained as a consequence of RBT to a hypovolaemic child with a low cardiac output. 
1	Vertical partial laryngectomy: a critical analysis of local recurrence. The purpose of this study was to evaluate local recurrence following vertical partial laryngectomies in 416 patients with either T1N0M0 or T2N0M0 glottic carcinoma. Local failure was reported according to the T stage, the precise tumor location within each stage, the true vocal cord mobility, and the surgical procedure performed. No local recurrences were observed among 42 patients who underwent thyrotomy and cordectomy when the tumor was confined to the middle third of the mobile true vocal cord. Local failure occurred in 8 of 111 (7.2%) patients in whom hemilaryngectomy was performed for tumors confined to one mobile true vocal cord. There was a diverse group of lesions within each T stage that responded differently to the surgical approaches. The differences in the initial recurrence rates are discussed in terms of careful preoperative assessment and choice of surgical technique for early glottic carcinoma. 
1	Squamous cell carcinomas often produce more than a single bone resorption-stimulating factor: role of interleukin-1 alpha*. Several cultured human squamous cell carcinoma cell lines (SCC-4, SCC-12B2, SCC-12F2, EC-GI-10, and BEN) and one normal keratinocyte line (Epy-1) were investigated for the production of bone resorption-stimulating activity (BRSA). Conditioned medium (CM) from each of the six cell lines stimulated bone resorption in neonatal mouse calvariae in culture. The BRSA of SCC-12F2 and EC-GI-10 was inhibited completely by antibody to interleukin-1 alpha (IL-1 alpha), whereas the BRSA in CM from the BEN, SCC-4, SCC-12B2, and Epy-1 cell lines was only partially inhibited by anti-IL-1 alpha. Addition of indomethacin to the calvarial cultures also partially inhibited the BRSA from EC-GI-10, SCC-4, SCC-12B2, and Epy-1 cells; the BRSA from BEN and SCC-12F2 cells was inhibited completely by indomethacin. cAMP production by calvariae was determined after a 60-min incubation with CM. CM from EC-GI-10, BEN, SCC-4, and Epy-1 stimulated cAMP production by bone. Preincubation of CM from BEN, EC-GI-10, SCC-4, and Epy-1 cells with two antisera against PTH-related protein [PTHrP; one specific for two PTHrP-(1-141), the other recognizing both PTHrP-(1-40) and PTHrP-(1-141)] completely inhibited the cAMP-stimulating activity. Using specific enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays for IL-1 alpha and IL-1 beta, IL-1 alpha was measured in CM of the SCC-4, SCC-12B2, SCC-12F2, and Epy-1 cell lines. IL-1 beta was undetectable (less than 0.1 ng/ml) in CM from all cell lines. Our findings indicate that the BRSA secreted by SCC-12F2 cells can be accounted for largely or entirely by IL-1 alpha, while the activity produced by SCC-12B2 includes IL-1 alpha and another unknown factor(s). The BRSA produced by EC-GI-10, BEN, SCC-4, and Epy-1 cells includes both IL-1 alpha and PTHrP. We conclude that IL-1 alpha may be a more prevalent and biologically significant component of the BRSA produced by SCCs than previously recognized. 
5	A prospective, randomized, double-blind, crossover study to compare the efficacy and safety of chronic nifedipine therapy with that of isosorbide dinitrate and their combination in the treatment of chronic congestive heart failure We performed a prospective, randomized, double-blind, crossover study to compare the efficacy and safety of vasodilation with the calcium entry blocker nifedipine with that of isosorbide dinitrate (ISDN) and their combination as treatment for heart failure. Twenty-eight patients with New York Heart Association Functional class II or III chronic heart failure due to left ventricular systolic dysfunction were studied. All patients were maintained on a constant dose of digitalis and diuretics throughout the study. Eight weeks of therapy with nifedipine alone or in combination with ISDN resulted in a significantly higher incidence of heart failure deterioration necessitating hospitalizations and/or additional diuretics. Twenty-four percent of patients required hospitalization during nifedipine therapy and 26% required hospitalization during nifedipine-ISDN combination therapy in comparison to 0% requiring hospitalization during ISDN therapy alone. The total number of heart failure-worsening episodes was nine among patients on nifedipine, three among patients on ISDN (p less than 0.09 versus nifedipine), and 21 among patients on nifedipine-ISDN combination (p less than 0.001 versus nifedipine, p less than 0.0001 versus ISDN). Premature discontinuation of drug administration due to clinical deterioration or other side effects occurred in 29% of patients during nifedipine therapy, 5% of patients during ISDN therapy (p = 0.05 versus nifedipine), and 19% of patients during the combination therapy. A comparison of eight patients who demonstrated clinical deterioration on nifedipine with the remainder of the patients demonstrated no significant difference in left ventricular ejection fraction (0.24 +/- 0.06 versus 0.23 +/- 0.07) or maximal oxygen uptake during exercise (13 +/- 3 versus 14 +/- 2 ml/kg/min). 
5	Heterogeneity in the inheritance of alcoholism. A study of male and female twins. Genetic influence on risk for alcoholism was examined in a US treatment sample of 50 monozygotic (MZ) and 64 dizygotic (DZ) male and 31 MZ and 24 DZ female same-sex twin pairs. For the DSM-III composite diagnosis of Alcohol Abuse and/or Dependence, statistically significant MZ/DZ differences in concordance were found with male, but not female, twins. For specific diagnoses, MZ/DZ differences were found in male subjects for both Alcohol Abuse and Alcohol Dependence, while MZ/DZ differences in female subjects were found only for Alcohol Dependence. The male MZ/DZ concordance difference for composite diagnosis but not for Alcohol Dependence could be accounted for statistically by differences in age of onset between MZ and DZ probands. As with alcohol, differences in MZ/DZ concordance were found for DSM-III composite diagnoses of Other Substance Abuse and/or Dependence with male, but not female, twins. Using Epidemiological Catchment Area data to estimate the population base rates of both alcohol and other substance use disorders allowed for heritability analyses that showed genetic factors to have only a modest influence on overall risk in both sexes (heritability estimates of approximately 0.35 for male subjects and 0.24 for female subjects). However, evidence for heterogeneity in the pattern of inheritance was also found, suggesting forms of alcoholism that may be moderately to highly heritable. 
5	Prostatic-type epithelium in urinary bladder. Clinical, histologic, and immunohistochemical study. Six cases of urinary bladder mucosa with prostate-type epithelium were studied clinically, morphologically, and immunohistochemically. All patients were male with an average age of fifty-three years; most presented with painless hematuria. Histologically, two types of lesions were observed, the polypoid located in various sites of the bladder wall and the flat lesion found in the bladder neck. Both lesions shared in common a prostatic-type and transitional surface epithelium while prostatic-type glands were prominent in the polypoid lesion. The prostatic-type epithelium was confirmed immunohistochemically by detection of prostatic specific antigen and prostatic acid phosphatase. Based on specific findings we considered the metaplasia as the most reliable histogenetic aspect. 
1	Infiltration of dendritic cells in relation to tumor invasion and lymph node metastasis in human gastric cancer. The infiltration of dendritic cells determined in 210 patients with gastric carcinoma was investigated from the standpoint of tumor invasion, lymph node metastasis, and prognosis. Dendritic cell infiltration was graded as "slight" and "marked." The 39% frequency in the marked infiltration group at the mucosal stage did not change in proportion to invasion into the deeper layers. The 5-year survival rate was 60.4% in patients with marked infiltration and 38.8% in those with slight infiltration, which was statistically different (P less than 0.01). The difference in survival rates was only statistically significant in those with cancer emerging from the serosa (P less than 0.001). There was a similar incidence of lymph node metastasis between the marked and slight infiltration groups in each grade of tumor invasion. However, marked infiltration of dendritic cells prevented widespread nodal involvement beyond the primary node in cases of advanced carcinoma (P less than 0.05). These findings indicate that infiltrating dendritic cells do not prevent the spread of tumor invasion but do prevent nodal involvement; therefore, for patients with a gastric cancer emerging from the serosa, the prognosis will be good. 
1	Anti-idiotype monoclonal antibody carrying the internal image of ganglioside GM3. Murine anti-idiotype monoclonal antibodies were generated against a human IgM monoclonal antibody (L612) that recognizes ganglioside GM3 on human melanoma. Hybridomas secreting antibodies that bound specifically to L612 were selected by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay using L612 and three negative control human IgMs, including monoclonal anti-GM2 and anti-GD2 antibodies, as well as purified serum IgM, as antigen sources. GM3-binding inhibition and cell-binding inhibition assays were used to identify seven anti-idiotype monoclonal antibodies that recognized determinants located within the antigen-combining sites of L612. To determine whether these anti-idiotype monoclonal antibodies possessed the internal image of the original antigen, we immunized syngeneic BALB/c mice with one of the anti-idiotype monoclonal antibodies, 4C10, coupled with keyhole limpet hemocyanin. Sera from the immunized mice reacted strongly with an antigen-positive M12 melanoma cell line and with purified GM3. Because L612 detects and kills melanoma tumor cells in vitro and in vivo in the presence of complement without affecting normal tissues, anti-idiotype monoclonal antibodies carrying the internal image of GM3 may be an effective tool for active specific immunotherapy in patients with melanoma. 
4	Orthostatic hypotension after spinal cord injury: treatment with fludrocortisone and ergotamine. We report a case of a 28-year-old woman with C5 quadriplegia, unresponsive to conservative treatment for orthostatic hypotension. Ergotamine, daily combined with fludrocortisone, successfully prevented symptomatic hypotension. In this report, neural, renal, and hormonal blood pressure regulatory mechanisms are described. Experiences obtained from this case and the existing literature suggest that (1) in persons with quadriplegia, plasma catecholamine levels show little increase with sitting, indicating an inability to activate baroreceptor and chemoreceptor reflexes, (2) elevated plasma aldosterone and renin levels indicate a renal compensatory response to decreased renal perfusion secondary to low plasma volume and/or chronic hypotension, and (3) the net effect of ergotamine and fludrocortisone is probably a combination of plasma volume expansion and direct peripheral vasoconstriction. 
1	Incidence of cutaneous T cell lymphoma and other rare skin cancers in a defined population. Between 1970 and 1984 in Rochester, Minnesota, rare skin cancers developed in 15 local residents: cutaneous T cell lymphoma (six subjects), dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans (four), adenocarcinoma of sweat glands (two), Merkel cell carcinoma (one), liposarcoma (one), and extramammary Paget's disease (one). These cases were identified through a unique computerized retrieval system that is maintained at the Mayo Clinic for the population of Rochester, Minnesota. The annual incidences of these cancers in the Rochester population were 0.9, 0.5, 0.3, 0.2, 0.2, and 0.2 per 100,000 residents, respectively (standardized to 1980 U.S. population). To our knowledge, this is the first report of the incidences of these rare skin cancers in a well-defined population. 
1	Measuring the quality of care for the cancer patient. In recent years, the efforts to better define quality of patient care have focused on attempts to improve on the measurement of quality. These efforts raise three questions: (1) Why attempt to measure quality? (2) What is the best way to measure quality of care of the cancer patient? and (3) What must be done to achieve this? Three main reasons for measuring quality of patient care are to describe the current state, plan strategies for improvement, and implement and monitor improvements. To measure quality, both the definition of quality and the tools available for measurement must be addressed. The difficulty in developing a measurable definition of quality is achieving agreement on the measurable components of quality. The tools to measure quality have evolved to focus on monitoring of key indicators for comparative use. The utility of indicators lies in demonstrating that they have the capacity to identify opportunities for improving care. The Joint Commission is improving measurement tools through the development and testing of oncology indicators for reliability and the capacity to identify opportunities for improving care. The development and teaching of new quality improvement methods to health care professionals also is necessary. 
1	Posterior mediastinal teratoma with abdominal extension. Posterior mediastinal benign teratomas are uncommon neoplasms in infancy; nine cases have been reported so far. A one month old baby was found to have a benign posterior mediastinal teratoma infiltrating the lower oesophagus from the level of the carina through the oesophageal hiatus into the upper abdomen. Partial oesophagectomy provided a successful outcome. 
4	Late arterial hemorrhage secondary to a Greenfield filter requiring operative intervention. Retroperitoneal hematomas associated with Greenfield filters have been described and are generally characterized as clinically insignificant. We report a retroperitoneal hematoma that was associated with a Greenfield filter and that required operative intervention because of hemodynamic instability. At operation a lumbar arterial laceration apparently caused by a protruding filter prong was identified and ligated. The implications of this occurrence for filter placement indications are discussed. The potential life-threatening severity of filter-associated hematomas is emphasized. 
2	Gallbladder mucin as a pronucleating agent for cholesterol monohydrate crystals in bile. Mucin is a densely glycosylated macromolecule secreted by the gallbladder epithelium as the principal constituent of gallbladder mucus. Hypersecretion of gallbladder mucus occurs in response to a lithogenic diet in experimental animals, and mucus accumulates as a viscous gel within the gallbladder lumen before gallstone formation. In both animals and man, the initial stage of cholesterol gallstone formation, the nucleation of cholesterol monohydrate crystals, occurs within the mucus gel. Inhibition of mucus secretion with aspirin prevents gallstone formation in the cholesterol-fed prairie dog, indicating the importance of mucus in gallstone formation. Mucin contains domains that bind cholesterol and lecithin transported as vesicles in supersaturated bile. Furthermore, mucin accelerates the nucleation of cholesterol crystals in both supersaturated model and native biles. Binding of cholesterol-enriched vesicles to hydrophobic domains on the mucin protein core appears to be critical for the acceleration of cholesterol crystal nucleation by mucin. Further study of the structure and function of gallbladder mucin should help to elucidate the pathogenesis of cholesterol cholelithiasis. 
5	Fractured and retained guide-wire fragment during coronary angioplasty--unforeseen late sequelae. During a difficult coronary angioplasty, the tip of the guide wire became inadvertently wedged in a distal vessel, fractured, and retained in situ. Because of the otherwise successful nature of the angioplasty and the patient's great risk for cardiac surgery, it was elected to leave the wire fragment in place. Recurrence of symptoms led to recatheterization, which in addition to restenosis of the original angioplasty site showed diffuse narrowing of the arterial segment that contained the retained wire fragment. This occurred despite systemic anticoagulation with Coumadin in the interval between procedures. Thus retained guide wire fragments in patent coronary arteries may cause arterial narrowing despite systemic anticoagulation. 
1	Prostate specific antigen in patients with clinical stage C prostate cancer: relation to lymph node status and grade. The preoperatively drawn sera from 84 previously untreated patients who had clinical stage C prostate cancer and underwent staging pelvic lymph node dissections were sent for monoclonal Hybritech analysis to assess the usefulness of prostate specific antigen (PSA) in predicting lymph node status. Of the 84 patients 47 (56%) had positive lymph nodes at surgery. The median PSA value for all patients with nodal metastases was 11.4 ng/.ml., and for those without it was 11.2 ng./ml. Relative to Gleason score, median PSA values were 11.35 for 2-4, 12.2 for 5-7 and 10.9 ng./ml. for 8-10. Within each M.D. Anderson grade median PSA values were 10.15 for grade I, 13.2 for grade II, 12.7 for grade III and 10.5 ng./ml. for grade IV. Simultaneously drawn preoperative frozen serum samples for 28 of these patients were independently analyzed by the Yang radioimmunoassay. Comparing Hybritech and Yang methods revealed strong statistical co-association (correlation coefficient R2 = 97.36, p less than 0.00001) but neither assay was statistically associated with nodal metastasis. Although no PSA level excluded the presence of nodal disease, we suggest that a Hybritech PSA of greater than 30 ng./ml. and a Yang PSA of greater than 50 ng./ml. may serve as a weak adjunctive marker predicting nodal metastasis. 
5	Early detection of gastric cancer OBJECTIVE--To see whether investigation of dyspeptic patients aged over 40 after their first consultation with the general practitioner would increase the proportions with early and operable gastric cancers. DESIGN--Prospective study of gastric cancer in dyspeptic patients aged over 40 from a defined population. SETTING--10 General practices (six in central Birmingham, four in Sandwell); the Queen Elizabeth Hospital, Birmingham; and Sandwell District General Hospital. PATIENTS--2659 Patients aged 40 or over referred with dyspepsia. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE--Increase in early and operable gastric cancers detected in middle aged patients with dyspepsia. RESULTS--Disease was identified in 1992 patients (75%). Fifty seven were found to have gastric cancer, 36 being treated by potentially curative resection, including 15 with early cancer. CONCLUSIONS--The investigation of dyspeptic patients over 40 at first attendance can increase the proportion of early gastric cancers detected to 26% and the proportion of operable cases to 63%. Such a policy has the potential to reduce mortality from gastric cancer in the population. 
1	Somatostatin-receptor imaging in the localization of endocrine tumors BACKGROUND AND METHODS. A number of different tumors have receptors for somatostatin. We evaluated the efficacy of scanning with 123I-labeled Tyr3-octreotide, a somatostatin analogue, for tumor localization in 42 patients with carcinoid tumors, pancreatic endocrine tumors, or paragangliomas. We then evaluated the response to octreotide therapy in some of these patients. RESULTS. Primary tumors or metastases, often previously unrecognized, were visualized in 12 of 13 patients with carcinoid tumors and in 7 of 9 patients with pancreatic endocrine tumors. The endocrine symptoms of these patients responded well to therapy with octreotide. Among 20 patients with paragangliomas, 8 of whom had more than one tumor, 10 temporal (tympanic or jugular), 9 carotid, and 10 vagal tumors could be visualized. One small tympanic tumor and one small carotid tumor were not seen on the scan. CONCLUSIONS. The 123I-labeled Tyr3-octreotide scanning technique is a rapid and safe procedure for the visualization of some tumors with somatostatin receptors. A positive scan may predict the ability of octreotide therapy to control symptoms of hormonal hypersecretion. 
1	Immunohistologic properties of benign and malignant mixed tumor of the lacrimal gland. We studied the immunohistopathologic features of normal lacrimal gland, benign mixed tumor, and malignant mixed tumor of the lacrimal gland. Primary antisera were to keratin, muscle-specific actin, vimentin, and glial fibrillary acid protein. Keratin stained in occasional myoepithelial cells in normal gland, ductal epithelium in normal gland and the tumors, and occasional stromal epithelioid cells in the tumors. Muscle-specific actin stained in myoepithelium and vascular smooth muscle in normal gland and the tumors, and occasional spindle-shaped and clusters of stromal cells in the tumors. Vimentin staining was nonspecific. Glial fibrillary acid protein stained in occasional myoepithelial cells in normal gland and polyhedral stromal cells in benign mixed tumor. Our findings indicate that ductal epithelium develops into the epithelial component, and some cells in the stroma and myoepithelium develop into some cells in the stroma of benign and malignant mixed tumor of the lacrimal gland. 
5	Perforin-mediated myocardial damage in acute myocarditis. Endomyocardial specimens were obtained from 7 patients with acute myocarditis. Immunohistochemical examination of the mononuclear infiltrate showed mainly cytotoxic T lymphocytes and natural killer cells. Perforin (a pore-forming protein found in cytotoxic lymphocytes) was identified in this myocardial lymphocytic infiltrate and electron microscopy showed myocardial cell damage that may have been associated with these perforin containing lymphocytes. The results indicate that in acute idiopathic and viral myocarditis, myocardial damage may be due to the action of perforin-secreting lymphocytes. 
4	Cardiac pathology in 470 consecutive forensic autopsies. Cardiovascular disease continues to be the single most common generic cause of sudden and unexpected deaths. Atherosclerotic coronary heart disease and acute myocardial infarction are the most prevalent forms of fatal cardiac disease observed at autopsy. Other cardiac lesions are frequently listed as causes of death, but the prevalence of such lesions as incidental findings in the general population is unknown. In this study, 470 consecutive forensic autopsies were evaluated for minor and major anomalies. The most frequently observed major congenital finding was floppy mitral valve (5%). Tunneled coronary arteries, considered minor congenital findings, were seen in 29%. Atherosclerotic coronary heart disease was the most common major acquired finding, observed in 16% of cases. Of the 470 hearts, only 8% were considered normal. 
4	Effect of mitral regurgitation and volume loading on pressure half-time before and after balloon valvotomy in mitral stenosis. Doppler pressure half-time (PHT) is frequently used to assess mitral valve area (MVA), but the reliability of PHT has recently been challenged, specifically in the setting of balloon mitral valvotomy when hemodynamics have been abruptly altered. The effect of volume loading both before and after balloon mitral valvotomy on computation of MVA by Gorlin and by PHT in 18 patients with high-fidelity micromanometer measurements of left atrial and left ventricular pressure was therefore examined. Echocardiographic MVA increased from 0.91 +/- 0.15 to 1.97 +/- 0.42 cm2 after valvotomy. Volume loading produced significant increases in left atrial pressure (16 to 23 before and 12 to 20 mm Hg after valvotomy), in cardiac output (3.7 to 4.1 before and 3.9 to 4.6 liters/min after valvotomy), and in mitral valve gradient (11 to 14 before and 5 to 7 mm Hg after valvotomy). These hemodynamic changes were associated with modest but significant decreases in PHT and increases in MVA estimated by 220/PHT (0.66 to 0.81 before and 1.64 to 1.96 cm2 after valvotomy), whereas the MVA by Gorlin was not affected in a consistent fashion by volume loading (0.85 to 0.89 before and 1.66 to 1.69 cm2 after valvotomy). The correlation between Gorlin MVA and 220/PHT was only fair (r = 0.73, p less than 0.001) and was significantly poorer among patients with greater than 1+ mitral regurgitation (r = 0.72) than among those with less or no regurgitation (r = 0.79) (p = 0.001 by analysis of covariance for mitral regurgitation effect). 
1	Congenital tracheoesophageal fistula associated with carcinoma of the lung in an adult. A rare case of adult congenital H-type tracheoesophageal fistula was diagnosed. Subsequently, at operation, large cell, undifferentiated carcinoma of the right middle lobe with extension to the right lobe and adherence to the diaphragm was documented. The diagnosis, surgical intervention, and 4-year follow-up are presented. 
1	Pulmonary disease following intravesical BCG treatment. Bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG) is an attenuated strain of Mycobacterium bovis that has been used in the treatment of malignant disease for over 20 years and for the treatment of bladder cancer since 1976. Major complications of this treatment are infrequent. We report two cases of systemic illness with pulmonary manifestations after treatment with intravesical BCG. 
1	Ileal duplication cyst causing massive bleeding in a child. Intestinal duplication is a rare congenital anomaly; nonetheless, it comprises more than half of all alimentary duplication disorders. Our case report describes the hemorrhagic sequelae of this entity with surgical and pathologic findings. A review of anatomical classification, embryology, and natural history of duplication cyst follows; differentiating characteristics of duplication cyst versus Meckel's diverticulum are outlined. Intestinal duplication cyst should be considered in the differential diagnosis of GI bleeding, especially in children. 
5	Antifungal therapy and its use in surgical treatment. Modern surgery continues to make significant therapeutic advances, and a major component in the adjunctive care allowing these improved procedures is the successful use of broad-spectrum antibacterials. However, the widespread administration of potent antibacterials and the frequent use of a variety of catheters, along with an increase in the number of immune compromised patients requiring invasive procedures, have allowed deep-seated mycoses to become more common. Nosocomial fungal infections are frequent, particularly in the urinary tract and in the blood. This rise in identified fungal infections, along with frequent empiric treatment of suspected infection, has significantly increased amphotericin B therapy in surgical services in the last five years. While amphotericin B remains the standard for treatment of nosocomial mycoses, other antifungal agents are available (flucytosine, miconazole, ketoconazole and fluconazole). Despite experience with the older agents and the development of new agents, many questions remain concerning the use of currently available antifungal treatments in postsurgical patients. The following discussion attempts to summarize the magnitude of the problem, the difficulties with diagnosis and laboratory evaluations, the characteristics of the antifungal agents and particular problems with antifungal treatment in surgery. 
5	Revision total knee arthroplasty for failed unicompartmental replacement. The results in nineteen patients (twenty-one knees) who had a failed unicompartmental knee replacement followed by a revision total knee arthroplasty were evaluated. There were twelve excellent, four good, one fair, and two poor results. The interval between the unicompartmental replacement and the revision total knee arthroplasty ranged from eight months to eight years. At the time of the revision, a major osseous defect was found in sixteen knees (76 per cent). The duration of follow-up after the revision ranged from two to ten years. At the most recent follow-up examination, radiographs revealed at least one radiolucent line in thirteen knees (62 per cent). The technical difficulties associated with the revision operation are evidence that unicondylar arthroplasty is not a conservative procedure that allows a total knee arthroplasty to be done easily later. The results also do not support the argument that a revision performed after failure of a unicondylar arthroplasty is less technically demanding than one performed after a failed primary total knee arthroplasty. 
1	Osteosarcoma. Clinical features and evolving surgical and chemotherapeutic strategies. Osteosarcoma is the most common neoplasm of bone in children and adolescents. The first effective therapy became available in the early 1970s, and although controversy existed for several years regarding the relative value of aggressive multiagent chemotherapy, presently about 60% of patients with resectable primary tumors and no metastases at diagnosis will be cured. New imaging methods, including computerized tomography, magnetic resonance imaging, and radionuclide techniques, that are sensitive to changes in local tumor perfusion have improved the ability to define the extent of tumor and the response to chemotherapy, and to plan surgery. Although amputation historically has been the primary method for local tumor control, newer surgical techniques and endoprosthetic devices, coupled with effective preoperative chemotherapy, have offered less radical surgery for 50% to 80% of patients with osteosarcoma. New therapeutic agents, including ifosfamide and the immunosuppressive drug, muramyl tripeptide phosphatidylethanolamine, hold promise for improvement in the cure rate of osteosarcoma. 
2	Reversibility of hepatic fibrosis in experimentally induced cholestasis in rat. The reversibility of hepatic fibrosis was investigated in an experimental model of extrahepatic cholestasis in the rat after common bile duct ligation for 2 weeks, followed by bilioduodenal anastomosis for 3 weeks. Bile duct ligation resulted in a transitory marked elevation in the serum concentration of 5'-nucleotidase, alkaline phosphatase, and bilirubin during the first 3 days. Then these levels decreased to threefold, twofold, and 100-fold the normal values, respectively, during the following 4 weeks. Histologic examination of the liver disclosed extensive bile duct proliferation and the formation of periportal fibrosis, with only slight inflammation and necrosis. The distribution of the major components of the hepatic extracellular matrix was analyzed 2 weeks after bile duct ligation, using the indirect immunoperoxidase method. Fibrous septa were found to be strongly stained for collagens I, pro-III, III and IV, fibronectin, and laminin. The most intense staining was found in enlarged periportal areas, collagen IV and laminin being particularly abundant around newly formed bile ducts. These changes paralleled high steady-state levels of alpha 1(I) and alpha 1(IV) collagen and B2 chain laminin mRNAs. Relief of the obstruction for 2 weeks resulted in a shift in the serum concentration of 5'-nucleotidase, alkaline phosphatase, and bilirubin toward normal values. A dramatic resorption of bile duct proliferations and periportal fibrosis were observed. Three weeks after bile duct repermeabilization, immunohistochemical study showed that the pattern of distribution of extracellular matrix components was almost normal, except for collagen IV, which remained abundant in the sinusoids when compared with the normal liver. In parallel, the steady-state B2-chain laminin mRNA level became lower than in cholestatic livers, whereas alpha 1(I) and alpha 1(IV) mRNAs were almost undetectable. These results show that hepatic fibrosis induced by experimental extrahepatic cholestasis in rat disappears in less than 3 weeks after relief of bile duct obstruction, suggesting that an active degradation of matrix protein occurs, except for collagen IV in the sinusoid. 
5	Urinary retention due to sacral myeloradiculitis: a clinical and neurophysiological study. We report 5 cases of sacral myeloradiculitis presenting with transient urinary retention. Neurophysiological testing, including bulbocavernosus reflex, pudendal evoked response and external anal sphincter electromyography, was performed. Parasympathetic pelvic nerves, pudendal nerves as well as the spinal cord seem to be involved to various degrees in this infrequent disorder. 
2	Detection of active intraabdominal arterial hemorrhage: value of dynamic contrast-enhanced CT. Contrast-enhanced dynamic CT was used prospectively to diagnose and locate the site of active arterial intraabdominal hemorrhage in 18 patients. Active arterial extravasation was confirmed by angiography in five patients and by immediate surgery in nine. Two patients not undergoing surgery or angiography required multiple blood transfusions to correct rapidly falling hematocrit due to a coagulopathy. One patient died of hypovolemic shock, and autopsy confirmed a large acute retroperitoneal hematoma. Another patient with a splenic laceration and massive hemoperitoneum on CT had no active bleeding at the time of surgery, which was delayed 1 hr from the time of the CT. All patients were clinically thought to be hemodynamically stable and had systolic blood pressures greater than 110 mm Hg at the time of CT. In seven patients, hypotension developed either during (two patients) or immediately after (five patients) CT scanning, necessitating either immediate surgery or angiographic embolization. Contrast-enhanced dynamic CT is valuable in the diagnosis and localization of active arterial intraabdominal hemorrhage. Identification of the anatomic site of this potentially life-threatening hemorrhage is critical in determining whether immediate laparotomy or angiographic embolization is the preferred method of treatment. 
3	Sensory ataxic hemiparesis in thalamic hemorrhage. Ataxic hemiparesis with cerebellar-like features has been reported following infarction or hemorrhage of the thalamus. We describe five patients with incoordination and corticospinal tract signs in the limbs opposite a dorsolateral thalamic hemorrhage. In four patients the hemorrhage extended superiorly into the lateral ventricle, the adjacent paraventricular region, and the upper and medial parts of the posterior limb of the internal capsule. Instead of cerebellar dysfunction, these patients exhibited directional errors of movement that improved distinctly when performed under visual guidance. We explain the incoordination on the basis of conscious deep sensory loss in the involved limbs. Perception of light touch, painful pinprick, and temperature were preserved in all patients. We use the term "sensory ataxic hemiparesis" to distinguish these patients from those with "classic" ataxic hemiparesis and cerebellar-like features, a distinction that may be important when planning functional rehabilitation. 
3	Triiodothyronine and brain excitability. We investigated mechanisms involved in thyroid hormone action on brain excitability. The effect of acute exposure of triiodothyronine (T3) to rat hippocampal slices in vitro was studied. No significant changes could be detected in prevolley, field excitatory postsynaptic potentials (fEPSP) and population spike amplitude, while there was a minor, nonsignificant trend toward shortening of the population spike latency time. T3 had no effect on penicillin-induced epileptiform activity. There was, however, an active accumulation of radioactively labeled T3 in the slices. A rat cervaux-isole preparation was used to determine focal seizure thresholds in the visual cortex, and no acute (2-4 h) effects were demonstrated. No significant acute effects of T3 on brain excitability in the hippocampus and visual cortex was observed, despite an active accumulation of T3. Thus, the effect of T3 on brain excitability most likely is due to delayed effects. 
5	Death by smothering and its investigation. This case report provides details from an extensive death investigation, the results of which led to the certification of suicidal manner of death by means of smothering in a pillow, without additional assistance from other persons or mechanical devices. This was the death of a chronically mentally ill person who was under currently approved professional treatment. Major investigative aspects of this case were the death-scene observations of the body, elimination of the possibility of homicide, and the study and analysis of the subject's psychiatric illness. Reasons for the uncommonness of reported deaths in this category are discussed. 
4	Is baldness a risk factor for coronary artery disease? A review of the literature. A literature search identified eight articles containing data on both baldness and coronary artery disease (CAD). Three of these articles described case-control studies that showed a positive relationship between baldness and CAD when controlling for CAD risk factors. Three other case-control studies showed no such relationship, but these did not control for CAD risk factors. The results of two cohort studies were inconclusive. Insufficient data were available from these studies to analyze possible relationships between baldness and CAD risk factors themselves. Overall, the data reviewed suggest that a small risk of CAD due to baldness may exist, but this risk is smaller than that of well-known CAD risk factors such as smoking and hypertension. Future research should emphasize proper control for age and CAD risk factors. 
5	Photochemotherapy improves chronic cutaneous graft-versus-host disease. We have used oral psoralen photochemotherapy (PUVA) to treat four patients with chronic graft-versus-host disease of the skin, oral mucosa, and liver, who had responded only partially to long-term immunosuppressive therapy (prednisolone, cyclosporine, azathioprine). PUVA therapy was delivered to the entire skin but not to the oral mucosa, and immunosuppressive therapy was continued in all patients. Two patients' skin lesions improved considerably; the oral lesions healed and did not recur in one. Immunosuppressive therapy could be reduced in these two patients. One patient with sicca signs did not improve. One patient had to interrupt PUVA therapy because of side effects attributed to 8-methoxypsoralen (nausea and vomiting). No flare of acute cutaneous graft-versus-host disease was noted during PUVA therapy. Chronic graft-versus-host disease of the liver did not improve in any patient. 
5	Hematoma of the optic nerve sheath after penetrating trauma. We have presented a case involving the diagnosis and management of optic nerve sheath hematoma. Our patient's positive outcome demonstrates the usefulness of megadose steroid therapy for acute optic nerve injury. 
3	Epidural hematoma: an unusual presentation. The authors present a patient with a traumatic epidural hematoma who complained only of headache and presented to the emergency department 48 hours after a fall. Mental status and neurological examination were normal. This delayed presentation is more commonly seen when a subdural hematoma is present but may result from epidural bleeding. Delayed formation of a traumatic epidural hematoma may occur when the following are present: elevated intracranial pressure, hypovolemic shock, a concomitant mass lesion, coagulopathy, bleeding from dural or diploic veins, a dural sinus laceration, a traumatic pseudoaneurysm, or an arteriovenous fistula. Although criteria for computed tomography of patients with head injuries remain variable in the literature, delayed presentation of epidural bleeding must be considered in the differential diagnosis of posttraumatic headache irregardless of the time interval or neurological presentation. 
4	Acquired Lutembacher syndrome or mitral stenosis and acquired atrial septal defect after transseptal mitral valvuloplasty. Critical mitral stenosis in selected patients may be treated successfully with percutaneous mitral valvuloplasty. Complications of this procedure, particularly an atrial septal defect following transseptal approach, are generally of minor clinical significance. We describe a woman who initially underwent a successful percutaneous double-balloon mitral valvuloplasty via the transseptal approach. Three months later she presented with right-sided heart failure. Color Doppler echocardiography and cardiac catheterization demonstrated an atrial septal defect (ASD) as well as restenosis of the mitral valve. We conclude that significant ASDs may occur following transseptal mitral valvuloplasty with appearance of right ventricular failure and that color Doppler imaging aids in the diagnosis of this new variant of the classical Lutembacher syndrome. 
1	Detection of residual leukemia after bone marrow transplant for chronic myeloid leukemia: role of polymerase chain reaction in predicting relapse. We used the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) to detect residual leukemia-specific mRNA in blood and marrow from 37 patients in complete hematologic and cytogenetic remission after allogeneic bone marrow transplant (BMT) for chronic myeloid leukemia (CML). Our two-step PCR method involved the use of "nested primers" in the second step and could detect one K562 cell diluted into 10(5) normal cells. Elaborate measures were taken to exclude false-positive and false-negative results. In nine patients whose blood and marrow were studied simultaneously the results were concordant (two positive and seven negative). Twenty-three patients transplanted in chronic phase (CP) with unmanipulated donor marrow were studied. Blood cells from nine of these patients were studied 3 to 6 months post-BMT and six were PCR positive; three were negative on subsequent studies. Blood cells from 18 patients studied between 8 months and 8 years post-BMT were all PCR negative. Nine patients transplanted in CP with T-cell-depleted marrow cells were studied. Blood from five was positive 3 to 24 months post-BMT; blood from five was negative 3 to 6 years post-BMT. Four patients no longer in first CP were studied after BMT with unmanipulated donor marrow. Blood from all four was positive 5 to 19 months post-BMT. Based on the known clinical results of transplant in these three cohorts we conclude that PCR may be positive within 6 months of BMT in patients who can expect long-lasting remission, whereas PCR positivity later after BMT may indicate that the probability of cure is reduced. Thus, the technique may prove useful for early assessment of new transplant protocols that might inadvertently increase the risk of relapse. 
1	Human immunodeficiency virus infection of megakaryocytic cells. The human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) is capable of infecting certain cells of hematopoietic lineage, particularly monocyte-macrophages and T lymphocytes. Recently, the possibility that cells of megakaryocytic lineage are susceptible to HIV infection has been raised. We have characterized infection of the permanent megakaryocytic cell line CMK by HIV in vitro. CMK cells were easily infected by HIV type 2 (HIV-2), producing significant amounts of virus in culture. Infection appeared to be mediated by the CD4 surface antigen on CMK cells. Three different strains of HIV-1 were able to minimally infect CMK cells, suggesting there may be isolates of HIV tropic for megakaryocytes. Infection of CMK cells led to downregulation of the CD4 surface antigen but no discernable change in expression of megakaryocyte-associated proteins glycoprotein Ib and glycoprotein IIb/IIIa. These observations support the likelihood that megakaryocytes are susceptible to HIV infection, and cell lines of megakaryocytic origin may provide a useful model to study effects of the retrovirus on megakaryocyte function. 
5	The effect of surgical stress on the in vitro metabolism of thyroxine by rat liver, kidney, and brain. In man, acute stress, like extensive surgery, leads to a rapid and prolonged decrease in serum T3 concentrations. The present study was carried out to investigate the mechanisms that underly the abrupt decrease in T3-neogenesis that occurs in response to acute surgical stress. Male Sprague-Dawley rats, surgically thyroidectomized, and treated with 1.2 micrograms T4/100 g BW/day, underwent wide vertical and horizontal incisions extending into the abdominal cavity while receiving light ether anesthesia. Different dietary manipulations were performed to investigate the superimposed influence of reduced carbohydrate and caloric intake on T3-neogenesis. The metabolism of 125I T4 labeled in its outer (phenolic) ring was investigated in liver, kidney, and brain homogenates of animals killed 48 h after surgery. In liver, values for the proportion of T4 degraded and the percent generation of T3 and iodide were unaffected by laparotomy. The percent T3 generation in experiments with 25 nM T4 concentration was 3.7 +/- 1.24% (mean +/- SD) in fed control animals given free access to 5% glucose, 3.4 +/- 0.67% in unoperated controls given a restricted amount of chow and 5% glucose, and 3.8 +/- 0.67% in operated animals given free access to chow and 5% glucose. As expected, T3 neogenesis in livers from unoperated animals was significantly reduced in rats fasted for 48 h and this reduction was similar in laparotomized rats fasted for 48 h after surgery. As in the liver, no effect of laparotomy on T4 metabolism in kidney and brain homogenates was observed. Finally, serum total T4 and T3 concentrations were not affected by surgery. It is concluded that acute surgical stress in thyroidectomized T4 replaced rats does not influence T4 metabolism in liver, kidney, and brain homogenates or affect the serum T4 and T3 concentrations. Since thyroid secretion of T4 (and T3) was eliminated and careful attention was paid to caloric intake in this rat model, previously reported abnormalities in serum thyroid hormone concentrations and T3-neogenesis in various states of nonthyroidal illness in man and rat, including surgery, are probably contributed to by thyroid secretion of T4 (and T3) and caloric deprivation, especially carbohydrate. 
1	Performing screening flexible sigmoidoscopy using colonoscopes: experience in 500 subjects. There is still controversy regarding the optimal length of flexible sigmoidoscopes. We performed screening distal colon examinations using 168-cm colonoscopes in 500 asymptomatic subjects who were unsedated and had sigmoidoscopy cleansing preparation. The mean depth of penetration was 66 cm and was similar in persons in whom the examination was discontinued because of poor preparation versus those with discomfort. Polyps were detected in 87 patients, but only 5 subjects had polyps detected above 60 cm. We conclude that in a group of unsedated subjects scheduled for flexible sigmoidoscopy after a sigmoidoscopy prep, the use of instruments longer than 60 cm gives very little additional yield. 
1	Tumor cell lines established in vitro: an independent prognostic factor for survival in non-small-cell lung cancer. OBJECTIVE: To determine the relation between in-vitro establishment of tumor cell lines and survival in patients with non-small-cell lung cancer. DESIGN: Cohort study. SETTING: Single-institution tertiary care center. PATIENTS: One hundred twenty-three consecutive patients with non-small-cell lung cancer from whom a viable tumor specimen could be obtained. INTERVENTION: Tumor tissue was removed at the time of entry into a therapeutic protocol. The tumor tissue was processed in the laboratory for attempted cell-line establishment. Patients classified as potentially curable (stages I, II, and IIIA) were treated with surgical resection, radiation therapy, or a combination. Patients suitable for palliative therapy only (stages IIIB and IV) were treated with radiation therapy with or without chemotherapy. Chemotherapy was based on in-vitro drug sensitivity when available. Cell-line establishment was correlated to clinical outcome. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Univariate analysis of survival was done using the log-rank test; multivariate analysis was done by Cox modeling step-up and step-down techniques. Cell lines were established from the tumor specimens of 25 patients (20%). Those patients experienced a median survival of 7 months compared with 18 months in patients from whom cell lines could not be established (P less than 0.001). In the 61 patients with potentially curable disease, 8 patients (13%) with cell lines established had a median survival of 8 months compared with 32 months for those without cell lines established (P = 0.001). In the 62 palliative group patients, the median survival of the 17 patients (27%) from whom tumor cell lines were established was 5 months compared with 7 months for those without cell lines (P = 0.15). Multivariate analysis in both groups showed cell-line establishment to be a significant indicator of prognosis (P less than 0.0001 for curable group; P less than 0.01 for palliative group). CONCLUSION: In-vitro tumor growth is related to decreased patient survival, which in turn reflects the biologic aggressiveness of cancers giving rise to these tumor cell lines. 
5	Hemiplegia in posterior cerebral artery occlusion. We report 4 patients with hemiplegia due to a posterior cerebral artery occlusion. Associated clinical signs were aphasia, alexia or a neglect syndrome, hemianopia, and hemisensory loss. Hemiplegia was due to infarction in the lateral midbrain. The level of the occlusion in the posterior cerebral artery may be located distal to the junction with the posterior communicating artery.
